<text>Betty Friedan (; February 4, 1921 – February 4, 2006) was an American feminist writer and activist. A leading figure in the women&#x27;s movement in the United States, her 1963 book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; is often credited with sparking the second wave of American feminism in the 20th century. In 1966, Friedan co-founded and was elected the first president of the National Organization for Women (NOW), which aimed to bring women &quot;into the mainstream of American society now [in] fully equal partnership with men.&quot;

In 1970, after stepping down as NOW&#x27;s first president, Friedan organized the nationwide Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality on August 26, the 50th anniversary of the Nineteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution granting women the right to vote. The national strike was successful beyond expectations in broadening the feminist movement; the march led by Friedan in New York City alone attracted over 50,000 people.

In 1971, Friedan joined other leading feminists to establish the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus. Friedan was also a strong supporter of the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the United States Constitution that passed the United States House of Representatives (by a vote of 354–24) and Senate (84–8, with 7 not voting) following intense pressure by women&#x27;s groups led by NOW in the early 1970s. Following Congressional passage of the amendment, Friedan advocated ratification of the amendment in the states and supported other women&#x27;s rights reforms: she founded the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws but was later critical of the abortion-centered positions of many liberal feminists.

Regarded as an influential author and intellectual in the United States, Friedan remained active in politics and advocacy until the late 1990s, authoring six books. As early as the 1960s Friedan was critical of polarized and extreme factions of feminism that attacked groups such as men and homemakers. One of her later books, &quot;The Second Stage&quot; (1981), critiqued what Friedan saw as the extremist excesses of some feminists.

== Early life ==
Friedan was born Bettye Naomi Goldstein on February 4, 1921, in Peoria, Illinois, to Harry and Miriam (Horwitz) Goldstein, whose secular Jewish families were from Russia and Hungary. Harry owned a jewelry store in Peoria, and Miriam wrote for the society page of a newspaper when Friedan&#x27;s father fell ill. Her mother&#x27;s new life outside the home seemed much more gratifying.

As a young girl, Friedan was active in both Marxist and Jewish circles; she later wrote how she felt isolated from the latter community at times, and felt her &quot;passion against injustice ... originated from my feelings of the injustice of anti-Semitism&quot;. She attended Peoria High School, and became involved in the school newspaper. When her application to write a column was turned down, she and six other friends launched a literary magazine called &quot;Tide,&quot; which discussed home life rather than school life.

Friedan attended the women&#x27;s college Smith College in 1938. She won a scholarship prize in her first year for outstanding academic performance. In her second year, she became interested in poetry and had many poems published in campus publications. In 1941, she became editor-in-chief of SCAN (Smith College Associated News). The editorials became more political under her leadership, taking a strong antiwar stance and occasionally causing controversy. She graduated &quot;summa cum laude&quot; and Phi Beta Kappa in 1942 with a major in psychology. She lived in Chapin House during her time at Smith.

In 1943 she spent a year at the University of California, Berkeley on a fellowship for graduate work in psychology with Erik Erikson. She became more politically active, continuing to mix with Marxists (many of her friends were investigated by the FBI). In her memoirs, she claimed that her boyfriend at the time had pressured her into turning down a Ph.D. fellowship for further study and abandoning her academic career.

== Writing career ==

=== Before 1963 ===
After leaving Berkeley, Betty became a journalist for leftist and labor union publications. Between 1943 and 1946 she wrote for Federated Press and between 1946 and 1952 she worked for the United Electrical Workers&#x27; &quot;UE News&quot;. One of her assignments was to report on the House Un-American Activities Committee.

By then married, Friedan was dismissed from the union newspaper &quot;UE News&quot; in 1952 because she was pregnant with her second child. After leaving UE News she became a freelance writer for various magazines, including &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot;.

According to Friedan biographer Daniel Horowitz, Friedan started as a labor journalist when she first became aware of women&#x27;s oppression and exclusion, although Friedan herself disputed this interpretation of her work.

=== &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; ===

For her 15th college reunion in 1957 Friedan conducted a survey of college graduates, focusing on their education, subsequent experiences and satisfaction with their current lives. She started publishing articles about what she called &quot;the problem that has no name&quot;, and got passionate responses from many housewives grateful that they were not alone in experiencing this problem.

The shores are strewn with the casualties of the feminine mystique. They did give up their own education to put their husbands through college, and then, maybe against their own wishes, ten or fifteen years later, they were left in the lurch by divorce. The strongest were able to cope more or less well, but it wasn&#x27;t that easy for a woman of forty-five or fifty to move ahead in a profession and make a new life for herself and her children or herself alone.

Friedan then decided to rework and expand this topic into a book, &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;. Published in 1963, it depicted the roles of women in industrial societies, especially the full-time homemaker role which Friedan deemed stifling. In her book, Friedan described a depressed suburban housewife who dropped out of college at the age of 19 to get married and raise four children. She spoke of her own &#x27;terror&#x27; at being alone, wrote that she had never once in her life seen a positive female role-model who worked outside the home and also kept a family, and cited numerous cases of housewives who felt similarly trapped. From her psychological background she criticized Freud&#x27;s penis envy theory, noting a lot of paradoxes in his work, and offered some answers to women desirous of further education.

The &quot;Problem That Has No Name&quot; was described by Friedan in the beginning of the book:

The problem lay buried, unspoken, for many years in the minds of American women. It was a strange stirring, a sense of dissatisfaction, a yearning [that is, a longing] that women suffered in the middle of the 20th century in the United States. Each suburban [house]wife struggled with it alone. As she made the beds, shopped for groceries ... she was afraid to ask even of herself the silent question – &quot;Is this all?&quot;

Friedan asserted that women are as capable as men for any type of work or any career path against arguments to the contrary by the mass media, educators and psychologists. Her book was important not only because it challenged hegemonic sexism in US society but because it differed from the general emphasis of 19th- and early 20th-century arguments for expanding women&#x27;s education, political rights, and participation in social movements. While &quot;first-wave&quot; feminists had often shared an essentialist view of women&#x27;s nature and a corporatist view of society, claiming that women&#x27;s suffrage, education, and social participation would increase the incidence of marriage, make women better wives and mothers, and improve national and international health and efficiency, Friedan based women&#x27;s rights in what she called &quot;the basic human need to grow, man&#x27;s will to be all that is in him to be&quot;. The restrictions of the 1950s, and the trapped, imprisoned feeling of many women forced into these roles, spoke to American women who soon began attending consciousness-raising sessions and lobbying for the reform of oppressive laws and social views that restricted females.

The book became a bestseller, which many historians believe was the impetus for the &quot;second wave&quot; of the women&#x27;s movement in the United States, and significantly shaped national and world events.

Friedan originally intended to write a sequel to &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, which was to be called &quot;Woman: The Fourth Dimension&quot;, but instead only wrote an article by that title, which appeared in the &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot; in June 1964.

=== Other works ===

Friedan published six books. Her other books include &quot;The Second Stage&quot;, &quot;It Changed My Life: Writings on the Women&#x27;s Movement&quot;, &quot;Beyond Gender&quot; and &quot;The Fountain of Age&quot;. Her autobiography, &quot;Life so Far&quot;, was published in 2000.

She also wrote for magazines and a newspaper:
* Columns in &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot; magazine, 1971–1974
* Writings for &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, &quot;Mademoiselle&quot;, &quot;Ladies&#x27; Home Journal&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;TV Guide&quot;, and &quot;True&quot;.

== Activism in the women&#x27;s movement ==

=== National Organization for Women ===

In 1966 Friedan co-founded, and became the first president of the National Organization for Women. Some of the founders of NOW, including Friedan, were inspired by the failure of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to enforce Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964; at the Third National Conference of State Commissions on the Status of Women they were prohibited from issuing a resolution that recommended the EEOC carry out its legal mandate to end sex discrimination in employment. They thus gathered in Friedan&#x27;s hotel room to form a new organization. On a paper napkin Friedan scribbled the acronym &quot;NOW&quot;. Later more people became founders of NOW at the October 1966 NOW Organizing Conference. Friedan, with Pauli Murray, wrote NOW&#x27;s statement of purpose; the original was scribbled on a napkin by Friedan. Under Friedan, NOW fiercely advocated the legal equality of women and men.

NOW lobbied for enforcement of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Equal Pay Act of 1963, the first two major legislative victories of the movement, and forced the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission to stop ignoring, and start treating with dignity and urgency, claims filed involving sex discrimination. They successfully campaigned for a 1967 Executive Order extending the same affirmative action granted to blacks to women, and for a 1968 EEOC decision ruling illegal sex-segregated help want ads, later upheld by the Supreme Court. NOW was vocal in support of the legalization of abortion, an issue that divided some feminists. Also divisive in the 1960s among women was the Equal Rights Amendment, which NOW fully endorsed; by the 1970s, women and labor unions opposed to ERA warmed up to it and began to support it fully. NOW also lobbied for national daycare.

NOW also helped women get equal access to public places, which they sometimes did not have. For example, by the early 1950s, women were allowed inside the Oak Room and Bar during the evenings, but still barred until 3 p.m. on weekdays, while the stock exchanges operated. In February 1969, Friedan and other members of NOW held a sit-in and then picketed to protest this; the gender restriction was removed a few months later.

Despite the success NOW achieved under Friedan, her decision to pressure Equal Employment Opportunity to use Title VII of the 1964 Civil Rights Act to enforce more job opportunities among American women met with fierce opposition within the organization. Siding with arguments from the group&#x27;s African American members, many of NOW&#x27;s leaders accepted that the vast number of male and female African Americans who lived below the poverty line needed more job opportunities than women within the middle and upper class. Friedan stepped down as president in 1969.

In 1973, Friedan founded the First Women&#x27;s Bank and Trust Company.

=== Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality ===
In 1970 NOW, with Friedan leading the cause, was instrumental in the U.S. Senate&#x27;s rejection of President Richard M. Nixon&#x27;s Supreme Court nominee G. Harrold Carswell, who had opposed the 1964 Civil Rights Act granting (among other things) women workplace equality with men. On August 26, 1970, the 50th anniversary of the Women&#x27;s Suffrage Amendment to the Constitution, Friedan organized the national Women&#x27;s Strike for Equality, and led a march of an estimated 20,000 women in New York City. While the march&#x27;s primary objective was promoting equal opportunities for women in jobs and education, protestors and organizers of the event also demanded abortion rights and the establishment of child-care centers.

Friedan spoke about the Strike for Equality:

All kinds of women&#x27;s groups all over the country will be using this week on August 26 particularly, to point out those areas in women&#x27;s life which are still not addressed. For example, a question of equality before the law; we are interested in the equal rights amendment. The question of child care centers which are totally inadequate in the society, and which women require, if they are going to assume their rightful position in terms of helping in decisions of the society. The question of a women&#x27;s right to control her own reproductive processes, that is, laws prohibiting abortion in the state or putting them into criminal statutes; I think that would be a statute that we would [be] addressing ourselves to.

So I think individual women will react differently; some will not cook that day, some will engage in dialog with their husband[s], some will be out at the rallies and demonstrations that will be taking place all over the country. Others will be writing things that will help them to define where they want to go. Some will be pressuring their Senators and their Congressmen to pass legislations that affect women. I don&#x27;t think you can come up with any one point, women will be doing their own thing in their own way.
=== National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws ===
Friedan founded the National Association for the Repeal of Abortion Laws, renamed National Abortion Rights Action League after the Supreme Court had legalized abortion in 1973.

=== Politics ===
In 1970 Friedan led other feminists in derailing the nomination of Supreme Court nominee G. Harrold Carswell, whose record of racial discrimination and antifeminism made him unacceptable and unfit to sit on the highest court in the land to virtually everyone in the civil rights and feminist movements. Friedan&#x27;s impassioned testimony before the Senate helped sink Carswell&#x27;s nomination.

In 1971 Friedan, along with many other leading women&#x27;s movement leaders, including Gloria Steinem (with whom she had a legendary rivalry) founded the National Women&#x27;s Political Caucus.

In 1972, Friedan unsuccessfully ran as a delegate to the 1972 Democratic National Convention in support of Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm. That year at the DNC Friedan played a very prominent role and addressed the convention, although she clashed with other women, notably Steinem, on what should be done there, and how.

=== Movement image and unity ===
One of the most influential feminists of the twentieth century, Friedan (in addition to many others) opposed equating feminism with lesbianism. As early as 1964, very early in the movement, and only a year after the publication of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;, Friedan appeared on television to address the fact the media was, at that point, trying to dismiss the movement as a joke and centering argument and debate around whether or not to wear bras and other issues considered ridiculous. In 1982, after the second wave, she wrote a book for the post-feminist 1980s called &quot;The Second Stage&quot;, about family life, premised on women having conquered social and legal obstacles.

She pushed the feminist movement to focus on economic issues, especially equality in employment and business as well as provision for child care and other means by which both women and men could balance family and work. She tried to lessen the focuses on abortion, as an issue already won, and on rape and pornography, which she believed most women did not consider to be high priorities.

=== Related issues ===

==== Lesbian politics ====
When she grew up in Peoria, Illinois, she knew only one gay man. She said, &quot;the whole idea of homosexuality made me profoundly uneasy.&quot; She later acknowledged that she had been very square, and was uncomfortable about homosexuality. &quot;The women&#x27;s movement was not about sex, but about equal opportunity in jobs and all the rest of it. Yes, I suppose you have to say that freedom of sexual choice is part of that, but it shouldn&#x27;t be the main issue&quot;. She ignored lesbians in the National Organization for Women (NOW) initially, and objected to what she saw as their demands for equal time. &quot;Homosexuality ... is not, in my opinion, what the women&#x27;s movement is all about.&quot; While opposing all repression, she wrote, she refused to wear a purple armband as an act of political solidarity, considering it not part of the mainstream issues of abortion and child care.

But in 1977, at the National Women&#x27;s Conference, she seconded a lesbian rights resolution &quot;which everyone thought I would oppose&quot; in order to &quot;preempt any debate&quot; and move on to other issues she believed were more important and less divisive in the effort to add the Equal Rights Amendment (ERA) to the U.S. Constitution. She accepted lesbian sexuality, albeit not its politicization. In 1995, at the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, she found advice given by Chinese authorities to taxi drivers that naked lesbians would be &quot;cavorting&quot; in their cars so that the drivers should hang sheets outside their cab windows, and that lesbians would have AIDS and so drivers should carry disinfectants, to be &quot;ridiculous&quot;, &quot;incredibly stupid&quot; and &quot;insulting&quot;. In 1997, she wrote that &quot;children ... will ideally come from mother and father.&quot; She wrote in 2000, &quot;I&#x27;m more relaxed about the whole issue now.&quot;

In 2022 the board of trustees of the Peoria Public Schools school district considered renaming Washington Gifted School after Friedan, but a board member brought up comments by Friedan perceived to be discriminatory against LGBT people, and so another name, Reservoir Gifted Academy, was chosen for the school.

==== Abortion choice ====
She supported the concept that abortion is a woman&#x27;s choice, that it shouldn&#x27;t be a crime or exclusively a doctor&#x27;s choice or anyone else involved, and helped form NARAL (now NARAL Pro-Choice America) at a time when Planned Parenthood wasn&#x27;t yet supportive. Alleged death threats against her speaking on abortion led to the cancellation of two events, although subsequently one of the host institutions, Loyola College, invited her back to speak on abortion and other homosexual rights issues and she did so. Her draft of NOW&#x27;s first statement of purpose included an abortion plank, but NOW didn&#x27;t include it until the next year.

In 1980, she believed abortion should be in the context of &quot;the choice to have children&quot;, a formulation supported by the Roman Catholic priest organizing Catholic participation in the White House Conference on Families for that year, though perhaps not by the bishops above him. A resolution embodying the formulation passed at the conference by 460 to 114, whereas a resolution addressing abortion, ERA and &quot;sexual preference&quot; passed by only 292–291 and that only after 50 opponents of abortion had walked out and so hadn&#x27;t voted on it. She disagreed with a resolution that framed abortion in more feminist terms that was introduced in the Minneapolis regional conference resulting from the same White House Conference on Families, believing it to be more polarizing, while the drafters apparently thought Friedan&#x27;s formulation too conservative.

As of 2000, she wrote, referring to &quot;NOW and the other women&#x27;s organizations&quot; as seeming to be in a &quot;time warp&quot;, &quot;to my mind, there is far too much focus on abortion. ... [I]n recent years I&#x27;ve gotten a little uneasy about the movement&#x27;s narrow focus on abortion as if it were the single, all-important issue for women when it&#x27;s not.&quot; She asked, &quot;Why don&#x27;t we join forces with all who have true reverence for life, including Catholics who oppose abortion, and fight for the choice to have children?&quot;

==== Pornography ====
She joined nearly 200 others in Feminists for Free Expression in opposing the Pornography Victims&#x27; Compensation Act. &quot;To suppress free speech in the name of protecting women is dangerous and wrong,&quot; said Friedan. &quot;Even some blue-jean ads are insulting and denigrating. I&#x27;m not adverse to a boycott, but I don&#x27;t think they should be suppressed.&quot;

==== War ====
In 1968, Friedan signed the &quot;Writers and Editors War Tax Protest&quot; pledge, vowing to refuse tax payments in protest against the Vietnam War.

==== Gun violence ====
Friedan cofounded WoMen Against Gun Violence with Ann Reiss Lane in 1994.

== Influence ==
Friedan is credited for starting the contemporary feminist movement and writing a book that is one of the cornerstones of American feminism. Her activist work and her book &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; have been a critical influence to authors, educators, writers, anthropologists, journalists, activists, organizations, unions, and everyday women taking part in the feminist movement. Allan Wolf, in &quot;The Mystique of Betty Friedan&quot; writes: &quot;She helped to change not only the thinking but the lives of many American women, but recent books throw into question the intellectual and personal sources of her work.&quot; Although there have been some debates on Friedan&#x27;s work in &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; since its publication, there is no doubt that her work for equality for women was sincere and committed.

Judith Hennessee (&quot;Betty Friedan: Her Life&quot;) and Daniel Horowitz, a professor of American Studies at Smith College, have also written about Friedan. Horowitz explored Friedan&#x27;s engagement with the women&#x27;s movement before she began to work on &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot; and pointed out that Friedan&#x27;s feminism did not start in the 1950s but even earlier, in the 1940s. Focusing his study on Friedan&#x27;s ideas in feminism rather than on her personal life Horowitz&#x27;s book gave Friedan a major role in the history of American feminism.

Justine Blau was also greatly influenced by Friedan. In &quot;Betty Friedan: Feminist&quot; Blau wrote of the feminist movement&#x27;s influence on Friedan&#x27;s personal and professional life. Lisa Fredenksen Bohannon, in &quot;Woman&#x27;s work: The story of Betty Friedan&quot;, went deep into Friedan&#x27;s personal life and wrote about her relationship with her mother. Sandra Henry and Emily Taitz (&quot;Betty Friedan, Fighter for Woman&#x27;s Rights&quot;) and Susan Taylor Boyd (&quot;Betty Friedan: Voice of Woman&#x27;s Right, Advocates of Human Rights&quot;), wrote biographies on Friedan&#x27;s life and works. Journalist Janann Sheman wrote a book called &quot;Interviews with Betty Friedan&quot; containing interviews with Friedan for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Working Women&quot; and &quot;Playboy&quot;, among others. Focusing on interviews that relate to Friedan&#x27;s views on men, women and the American Family, Sheman traced Friedan&#x27;s life with an analysis of &quot;The Feminine Mystique&quot;.

Friedan (among others) was featured in the 2013 documentary &quot;&quot;, about the women&#x27;s movement.

In 2014, a biography of Friedan was added to the American National Biography Online (ANB).

== Personality ==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; obituary for Friedan noted that she was &quot;famously abrasive&quot;, and that she could be &quot;thin-skinned and imperious, subject to screaming fits of temperament&quot;.

Media focus would fall on feminists grading each other on personality and appearance, the source of Betty Friedan and Gloria Steinem&#x27;s well-documented antipathy. In February 2006, shortly after Friedan&#x27;s death, the feminist writer Germaine Greer published an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, in which she described Friedan as pompous and egotistic, somewhat demanding and sometimes selfish, citing several incidents during a 1972 tour of Iran.

Indeed, Carl Friedan had been quoted as saying &quot;She changed the course of history almost singlehandedly. It took a driven, super aggressive, egocentric, almost lunatic dynamo to rock the world the way she did. Unfortunately, she was that same person at home, where that kind of conduct doesn&#x27;t work. She simply never understood this.&quot;

Writer Camille Paglia, who had been denounced by Friedan in a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview, wrote a brief obituary for her in &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;:



== Personal life ==
She married Carl Friedan (), a theater producer, in 1947 while working at UE News. She continued to work after marriage; first as a paid employee and, after 1952, as a freelance journalist. The couple divorced in May 1969, and Carl died in December 2005.

Friedan stated in her memoir &quot;Life So Far&quot; (2000) that Carl had beaten her during their marriage; friends such as Dolores Alexander recalled having to cover up black eyes from Carl&#x27;s abuse in time for press conferences (Brownmiller 1999, p. 70). Carl denied abusing her in an interview with &quot;Time&quot; magazine shortly after the book was published, describing the claim as a &quot;complete fabrication&quot;. She later said, on &quot;Good Morning America&quot;, &quot;I almost wish I hadn&#x27;t even written about it, because it&#x27;s been sensationalized out of context. My husband was not a wife-beater, and I was no passive victim of a wife-beater. We fought a lot, and he was bigger than me.&quot;

Carl and Betty Friedan had three children, Daniel, Emily and Jonathan. She was raised in a Jewish family, but was an agnostic. In 1973, Friedan was one of the signers of the Humanist Manifesto II.

== Death ==
Friedan died of congestive heart failure at her home in Washington, D.C., on February 4, 2006, her 85th birthday.

Some of Friedan&#x27;s papers are held at the Schlesinger Library, Radcliffe Institute, Harvard University, Cambridge, Massachusetts.

== In media ==
Friedan was portrayed by actress Tracey Ullman in the 2020 FX limited series &quot;Mrs. America&quot;.

Friedan was portrayed in Season 1 Episode 7 of the HBO Max series &quot;Julia&quot;. The scene, which takes place at a Public Television gala in New York, depicts a conversation between Friedan and Julia Child, in which Friedan criticizes Child&#x27;s cooking show on WGBH, suggesting that it harms women.

A fictionalized version of her was a character in the Britney Spears jukebox musical Once Upon a One More Time as the &#x27;Original Fairy Godmother&#x27; who gives the fairytale princesses &#x27;The Feminine Mystique&#x27; to empower themselves. In the show, she is a fairy godmother who was banished from the fairytales and went to live in Flatbush to publish the book.

Friedan herself appeared in two films, including &quot;Camera Three&quot; and &quot;Happily Ever After: Fairy Tails for Every Child&quot;, in 1955 and 1995 respectively. She also narrated two television shows, &quot;Ex Libris&quot; and &quot;Bicentennial Minutes&quot;.

<doc id="253065" wikidata="Q6627609" url="?curid=253065" title="List of mayors of Minneapolis">
<text>The mayor of Minneapolis is the chief executive officer of the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota, responsible for overseeing the city&#x27;s administration. As the political and ceremonial leader of the city, the mayor also represents Minneapolis on the state, national, and international levels. The mayor&#x27;s office is located in the Minneapolis City Hall.

== History ==
Minneapolis has had a politically diverse set of mayors since its incorporation. In the years since its incorporation, the political representation in the mayoral office has shifted. The city has seen mayors from the Republican, Democratic, Democratic-Farmer-Labor, Farmer-Labor, and Socialist parties, as well as from unaffiliated backgrounds. Notable historical figures include A.A. &quot;Doc&quot; Ames, known for his multiple terms and controversial tenure, Hubert Humphrey, who later became Vice President of the United States, and Sharon Sayles Belton, the first African American and first woman to hold the office.

== Term in office ==
The term of office for Mayor of Minneapolis is four years, with no limit on the number of terms an individual can serve. The inauguration of the newly elected mayor takes place in January following the municipal election.

From 1867 to 1878 mayors were elected for a 1-year term. Beginning in 1878 the term was extended to 2 years. The term was extended to 4 years beginning in January 1982, to provide mayors with more time to achieve their programs.

The most recent election for Mayor of Minneapolis was held on November 2, 2021, and the next will be on November 4, 2025.

== Role ==

<text>The governor of Georgia is the head of government of Georgia and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s National Guard, when not in federal service, and State Defense Force. The governor also has a duty to enforce state laws, the power to either veto or approve bills passed by the Georgia Legislature, and the power to convene the legislature into special session. The current governor is Republican Brian Kemp, who assumed office on January 14, 2019.

== History of the office ==

There have officially been 77 governors of the state of Georgia, including 11 who served more than one distinct term. Georgia was one of the original Thirteen Colonies and ratified the Constitution of the United States on January 2, 1788. The early days were chaotic, with several gaps and schisms in the state&#x27;s power structure, as the state capital of Savannah was captured during the American Revolutionary War. After independence was achieved, the office was solidly Democratic-Republican until the 1830s, when the office began to be contested by Democrats and Whigs for a few decades.

It seceded from the Union on January 19, 1861, and was a founding member of the Confederate States of America on February 4, 1861. Following the end of the American Civil War, Georgia during Reconstruction was part of the Third Military District, which exerted control over governor appointments and elections. During Reconstruction, it had two Republican governors. Georgia was then readmitted to the Union on July 25, 1868, expelled from Congress for failures in Reconstruction on March 3, 1869, and again readmitted on July 15, 1870. After the end of Reconstruction and the state was allowed to govern itself again, Democrats would be the only party elected for the next 131 years.

The longest-serving governors are George Busbee, Joe Frank Harris, Zell Miller, Sonny Perdue, and Nathan Deal, each of whom served two full four-year terms; Joseph E. Brown, governor during the Civil War, was elected four times, serving seven and a half years. The shortest term of the post-revolutionary period is that of Matthew Talbot, who served 13 days after succeeding his predecessor who died in office. One man, Eugene Talmadge, died before taking office in his third distinct term, leading to a dispute in which three people claimed the office.

===Exceptions and omissions===
The revolutionary government was thrown into disarray by the capture of Savannah in 1778, which led to several governments with varying levels of influence; they would reunite in 1780. The Official and Statistical Register of Georgia ignores the Council of Safety of William Ewen in favor of Archibald Bulloch&#x27;s government, and omits the government of William Glascock and Seth John Cuthbert. The Register includes colonial governors in its numbering, listing Archibald Bulloch as the 7th governor.

=== Three governors controversy ===
In December 1946, Governor-elect Eugene Talmadge died before assuming office. Talmadge&#x27;s son, Herman, was appointed governor by the State Legislature. This was challenged by the Lieutenant Governor-elect Melvin Thompson, who maintained that the state constitution authorized him to assume the office upon the death of the governor. Outgoing governor Ellis Arnall announced that he would not relinquish the office until it was clear who the new governor was. The political turmoil that ensued became known as the &quot;three governors controversy&quot;. In January 1947, while all three governors occupied different portions of the State Capitol, Secretary of State Ben W. Fortson Jr., took the Great Seal of the State of Georgia and hid it. This prevented any of the claimants to the governorship from executing any business until the Supreme Court of Georgia could make a ruling on the rightful winner. Thompson was eventually declared &quot;acting governor&quot; until a special election could be held to fill the remainder of the original term. Herman Talmadge won the special election and served out the remaining portion of his father&#x27;s term.

== Qualifications for office ==
According to Article V, Section I, Paragraph IV of the Georgia Constitution, to be eligible for the office of governor one needs to meet the following qualifications:

*Be at least thirty years of age when sworn in
*Be a resident of Georgia for at least six years immediately preceding the election
*Be a United States citizen for at least fifteen years before the election

== Election and term of office ==

=== Historical rules ===
Under Georgia&#x27;s Rules and Regulations of 1776, considered by some to be the first constitution, the chief executive was a president chosen by the legislature every six months. This was quickly superseded by the 1777 constitution, which called for a governor to be chosen by the legislature each year, with a term limited to one year out of every three. The governor&#x27;s term was lengthened to two years in the 1789 constitution, and an 1824 amendment provided for popular election of the governor. While the 1861 secessionist constitution kept the office the same, the 1865 constitution, following Georgia&#x27;s surrender, limited governors to two consecutive terms of two years each, allowing them to serve again after a gap of four years. The Reconstruction constitution of 1868 increased the governor&#x27;s term to four years. The 1877 constitution, after the end of Reconstruction, returned the office to the provisions of the 1865 constitution. An amendment in 1941 lengthened terms to four years, but governors could no longer succeed themselves, having to wait four years to serve again. The constitution does not specify when terms start, only that the governor is installed at the next session of the General Assembly. The current constitution of 1983 allows governors to succeed themselves once before having to wait four years to serve again.

=== Modern practice ===
The current constitution of 1983 allows governors to serve two terms in office before having to wait four years to serve again. The Constitution provides as follows:&quot;There shall be a Governor who shall hold office for a term of four years and until a successor shall be chosen and qualified. Persons holding the office of Governor may succeed themselves for one four-year term of office. Persons who have held the office of Governor and have succeeded themselves as hereinbefore provided shall not again be eligible to be elected to that office until after the expiration of four years from the conclusion of their term as Governor.&quot; Ga. Const. art. V, § I, para. I.

&quot;An election for Governor shall be held on Tuesday after the first Monday in November of 1986, and the Governor-elect shall be installed in office at the next session of the General Assembly. An election for Governor shall take place quadrennially thereafter on said date unless another date be fixed by the General Assembly. Said election shall be held at the places of holding general elections in the several counties of this state, in the manner prescribed for the election of members of the General Assembly, and the electors shall be the same.&quot; Ga. Const. art. V, § I, para. II.This does mean that a governor and their lieutenant governor, if both in agreement and of enough popularity, could in theory serve an infinite number of terms each. 

== Powers, duties, and authorities ==
According to the Constitution of Georgia, the governor:

* Exercises &quot;chief executive powers&quot; and &quot;take care the laws are faithfully executed&quot;
* Serves as the commander-in-chief of the Georgia National Guard
* Serves as the commander-in-chief of the Georgia State Defense Force, a professionally trained volunteer state defense force 
* Calls the Georgia General Assembly into special session for purposes as the governor may provide by proclamation
* Exercises veto power on bills
* Issues writs of election for vacancies which occur in Congress
* May deliver a state of the state address to the General Assembly
* Suspends or removes officers under Article II, Section 3 of the Georgia Constitution (following the finding of an appointed commission)
The governor, by law, also has the authority to declare a state of emergency or disaster, suspend the collection of taxes, and generally enforce the laws of the state.

==Succession==

Originally, in the event of a vacancy, the president of the executive council acted as governor. This was changed in 1798 to the president of the senate. The 1945 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who would act as governor if that office became vacant; Article V, Section 1, Paragraph V of the Constitution of Georgia provides a plan of succession in the event of the death or incapacitation of the Governor. The first successor would be the Lieutenant Governor, followed by the Speaker of the Georgia House of Representatives.

<doc id="253068" wikidata="Q5589655" url="?curid=253068" title="Governor of Hawaii">
<text>The governor of Hawaii () is the head of government of the U.S. state of Hawaii and its various agencies and departments, as provided in the Hawaii State Constitution Article V, Sections 1 through 6. It is a directly elected position, votes being cast by popular suffrage of residents of the state.


The governor is responsible for enforcing laws passed by the Hawaii State Legislature and upholding rulings of the Hawaii State Judiciary. The role includes being commander-in-chief of the armed forces of Hawaii and having the power to use those forces to execute laws, suppress insurrection and violence and repel invasion. The lieutenant governor of Hawaii becomes acting governor upon the officeholder&#x27;s absence from the state or if the person is unable to discharge the powers and duties of the office. Historically, the Governor of Hawaii has been from either the Democratic Party of Hawaii or Hawaii Republican Party.

The current governor of Hawaii is Democrat Josh Green, who assumed the position on December 5, 2022. Hawaii was the first U.S. state to have an Asian American chief executive; George Ariyoshi served three terms between 1974 and 1986.

==Qualifications==
The governor of Hawaii is limited to two four-year terms. Inauguration takes place on the first Monday in December following a gubernatorial election. A single term ends at noon four years later. There is no lifetime limit on the number of times a governor may be elected, but a governor who has been elected to two consecutive terms must be out of office for at least one election cycle before being eligible once again for re-election. A Governor is:
* required to be at least 30 years old,
* required to have been a resident of Hawaii for five consecutive years previous to election,
* barred from other professions or paid positions during the term.

==Authority==
The governor and lieutenant governor (running together on the same ticket) are the only two elected statewide executive officers in Hawaii. All other statewide executives (attorney general, auditor, etc.) are appointed by either the governor or the state legislature.

Also, the governor of Hawaii has wide-reaching authority comparably stronger than the other governors in the Union; administrative powers are more centralized than that of most other states with little authority devolved to the counties, and unlike other states there are no local school districts. Included within the governor&#x27;s sphere of jurisdiction is the power to appoint all judges of the various courts within the Hawaiian judicial system, subject to Senatorial approval.

The state of Hawaii does not have fixed cabinet positions and departments. By law, the governor of Hawaii has the power to create their cabinet and departments as needed as long as the executive department is composed of no more than twenty bodies and cabinet members. The governor of Hawaii is also empowered to remove cabinet officers at will, with the exception of the attorney general of Hawaii, who must be removed by an act of the Hawaii State Senate.

==Residence==
The governor of Hawaii&#x27;s official residence was Washington Place, a mansion that was once a minor royal palace of Queen Liliuokalani and her husband, Prince Consort John Owen Dominis. The mansion is located across the street from the Hawaii State Capitol, where the Office of the Governor is located, and is accessed from the Capitol through underground passages beneath Beretania Street in downtown Honolulu. Befitting of its history as a former royal palace, the governors of Hawaii have entertained royal families from around the world at Washington Place including Queen Elizabeth II and Emperors Hirohito and Akihito.

In 2001, the new mansion for the governor was built on the grounds of Washington Place, after the state decided to turn Washington Place into a museum, an idea supported by then-Governor Benjamin J. Cayetano and family. This new mansion: Hale Kia Aina was completed in 2002 and Cayetano became the first governor to live in it for a few days before leaving office. His successor, Governor Linda Lingle, became the first governor to begin a term in the new mansion. Despite the building of this new mansion, Washington Place remains the official residence of the governor and is still used for state dinners and other official functions.

The 43rd and current governor is JB Pritzker, a Democrat who took office on January 14, 2019. Pritzker was re-elected in 2022 by a 12% margin.

== Qualifications ==
The term of office of governor of Illinois is 4 years, and there is no limit on the number of terms a governor may serve. Inauguration takes place on the second Monday in January following a gubernatorial election in November. A single term ends four years later. A governor is required to be:

* at least 25 years old
* a United States citizen
* a resident of Illinois for 3 years prior to election

== Succession ==

If the incumbent governor is no longer able or permitted to fulfill the duties of the office of governor, the line of succession is as follows:


== Residence ==
The governor is allowed the occupancy of the Illinois Governor&#x27;s Mansion in Springfield, the state capital. Its first occupant was Governor Joel Aldrich Matteson, who took residence at the mansion in 1855. It is one of three oldest governor&#x27;s residences in continuous use in the United States.

The governor is also given the use of two official residences on the state fair grounds, located in Springfield and DuQuoin. The official residence in DuQuoin is Hayes House. Governors have traditionally used these residences part of the year.

However, some governors, such as Rod Blagojevich, have chosen to not use the governor&#x27;s homes as their primary residence, instead commuting either by car or plane to Springfield from their home cities. Many Chicago-based governors also have done much of their business out of the governor&#x27;s office in Chicago&#x27;s James R. Thompson Center, an office building owned by the state named for former governor James R. Thompson (1977–1991), Illinois&#x27;s longest-serving governor.

<text>The governor of Indiana is the head of government of the U.S. state of Indiana. The governor is elected to a four-year term and is responsible for overseeing the day-to-day management of the functions of many agencies of the Indiana state government. The governor also shares power with other statewide executive officers, who manage other state government agencies. The governor works out of the Indiana Statehouse and holds official functions at the Indiana Governor&#x27;s Residence in the state capital of Indianapolis.

The 52nd, and current, governor is Republican Mike Braun, who took office on January 13, 2025.

The position of the governor has developed over the course of two centuries. It has become considerably more powerful since the mid-20th century after decades of struggle with the Indiana General Assembly and Indiana Supreme Court to establish the executive branch of the government as an equal third branch of the state government. Although gubernatorial powers were again significantly expanded by constitutional amendments during the 1970s, Indiana governors remain significantly less powerful than their counterparts in most other states.

==Office==

===Authority===
The governor&#x27;s powers are established in Article V of the Constitution of Indiana. Constitutionally, the governor has very limited executive authority to manage the government of the state; most exercisable powers over state agencies are held by independently elected cabinet heads.

The governor works in concert with the state legislature (the bicameral Indiana General Assembly, consisting of the Indiana House of Representatives and the Indiana Senate) and the state supreme court (the Indiana Supreme Court) to govern the state. The governor has the power to veto legislation passed by the General Assembly. If vetoed, a bill is returned to the General Assembly for reconsideration. Unlike other states, most of which require a two-thirds supermajority to override a veto, the Indiana General Assembly may override the veto with an absolute majority vote in both chambers.

One of the governor&#x27;s most important political powers is the ability to call a special session of the General Assembly. During a two-year period, the assembly can meet on its own for no more than 91 days, and this often prevents them from passing all the legislation they intend to. This can give the governor considerable influence in the body which will often compromise on issues with him in exchange for a special legislative session.

Among his other powers, the governor can call out the state defense force (the Indiana Guard Reserve) or the Indiana National Guard in times of emergency or disaster. The governor is also charged with the enforcement of all the state&#x27;s laws and the Indiana Code through the Indiana State Police. The governor also has the ability to grant a pardon or commutation of sentence of any person convicted of a crime in the state, except in cases of treason or impeachment.

In addition to constitutional powers, governors also have a considerable degree of statutory authority. Most of the authority exercised by governors on a daily basis is derived from statute, giving the General Assembly a great degree of power to expand or contract the governor&#x27;s authority. Historically, the party in control of the General Assembly would reassign control of agencies from the governor or to the governor based upon party affiliation, and the party affiliation of the cabinet heads, which at times has left the governor with no direct control over state agencies.

The governor also can influence the state court system through the appointment of judges. In Indiana, when vacancies occur on the Supreme Court, Tax Court, and circuit courts, the Judicial Nominating Commission interviews candidates and sends a list of three candidates for each vacancy to the governor, who chooses one. Circuit court judges and Superior court judges are elected in Indiana; if a vacancy occurs (such as by death or resignation) the governor may make an appointment, who holds the office until the next general election. The authority to make such appointments gives the governor considerable sway in setting the makeup of the judiciary.

The annual salary of the governor of Indiana is US$134,051 (2021). Additionally, he receives $6,000 annually for discretionary spending and expenses.

===Requirements===
To become governor of Indiana, a candidate must be a citizen of the United States and must have been a resident of the state in which they are running for the period of five consecutive years before the election. The candidate must also be at least 30 years old when sworn into office. The governor may not hold any other state or federal office during his term and must resign from any such position before being eligible to be sworn in as governor. Before taking the office, the candidate must swear an oath of office administered by the Chief Justice of the Indiana Supreme Court, promising to uphold the Constitution and laws of the United States of America and the State of Indiana.

===Term limits===
The governor serves a four-year term beginning on the date he is sworn into office; inauguration day is the second Monday in January. He remains governor until his successor takes the oath of office. The governor&#x27;s term can be shorter if he resigns, dies, becomes incapacitated or impeached. There is no limit to how many terms a governor may serve; however, the governor is limited to serving a total of eight years in any 12-year period, equivalent to two full terms. To be eligible to run for a third term, the governor would have to sit out for one election period.

===Succession===

If the governor becomes incapacitated, then the Lieutenant Governor of Indiana becomes acting governor until his recovery. Only two governors have become incapacitated during their terms, and the current precedent is that the governor&#x27;s office is to notify the lieutenant governor, who will then make the decision to become acting governor by notifying the General Assembly by letter. The governor can resume his powers and duties by sending a letter to the General Assembly notifying them that he is again capable of executing the duties of office. If the governor resigns, dies, or is impeached, tried, and convicted, then the lieutenant governor ascends as governor. If the office of the lieutenant governor is vacant, then the president pro tempore of the Senate becomes governor. If the office of Senate President Pro Tempore is also vacant, then the Senate must elect a replacement to fill the governor&#x27;s office.

===Residence and offices===
The governor maintains an office on the first floor of the Indiana Statehouse in Indianapolis, and from there he manages all of the state&#x27;s agencies that are under his jurisdiction. He shares the building with the Indiana General Assembly and the Supreme Court of Indiana. The other elected executive officers, including the attorney general and the lieutenant governor, are also located in the statehouse, but most of the state&#x27;s bureaus are located in the state office building. Traditionally, the governor lives in the Indiana Governor&#x27;s Residence, also located in Indianapolis; however, former governor Mitchell Daniels&#x27; family maintained their private home, using the Governor&#x27;s Residence only for official functions.

==History==
===Governors===

The first governor of Indiana, Jonathan Jennings, was elected in August 1816 and assumed office in December of that year. The first capital was in Corydon, and the first three governors maintained homes and offices there. The capital was moved to Indianapolis in December 1824. Governors originally served three-years terms until the constitution was replaced in 1851. The 1851 constitution extended terms to four years but banned governors from serving consecutive terms. The constitution was amended again in 1972 to allow governors to serve consecutive terms but limited them to two consecutive terms at a time.

There have been 51 governors of Indiana. 23 Republicans and 21 Democrats have each held the position. Four have died while in office; seven have resigned. Ten lieutenant governors have succeeded to become governor. James B. Ray has been the only president of the Senate &quot;pro tempore&quot; to assume the office of governor.

Jonathan Jennings was the first governor to have an attempted impeachment brought against him in response to his actions as an agent of the federal government during the negotiations of the Treaty of St. Mary&#x27;s in 1819, illegal under Indiana&#x27;s constitution. The evidence of his role was destroyed, and after two months of investigation the proceedings were dropped. The only other time was when the General Assembly attempted to bring impeachment proceedings against Governor James B. Ray for a similar action in 1826, but the action was also defeated 28–30.

Three governors were elected Vice President of the United States, two while in office.

===Power shifts===
Historically, the office of Indiana&#x27;s governor has been a weaker institution relative to the other branches of state government and also when compared to the role of governors of other U.S. states. During Indiana&#x27;s territorial period, there was a considerable resentment to the power wielded by the territorial governors, and in response the anti-governor faction, which dominated the constitutional convention, created a weak executive position. The governor was not given complete authority over the militia, his term was set at three years, and most of his actions could be overridden by the General Assembly. The position was steadily weakened by the legislature, and his power was limited further by the constitution of 1851. The governor&#x27;s authority to choose his own appointments for the state courts was removed, and the ability to appoint his own cabinet was ended. The cabinet was effectively made independent by making them elected popularly. The authority to propose budgets was revoked, and serving consecutive terms was banned. By comparison, the Supreme Court was made almost entirely independent, and the General Assembly assumed many of the powers taken from the governor.

Governors first began to assert their own power during the American Civil War as the General Assembly attempted to remove command of the militia from the governor. In response, the General Assembly was effectively suppressed, during which time the governor assumed many powers to appoint public officials, hire and remove state employees, and manage state finances. When the General Assembly reconvened with a majority sympathetic to the governor, he was permitted to continue many of his assumed powers. In 1889, the General Assembly began to reassert its authority over hiring state employees. The issued ended when the Supreme Court ruled in favor of the legislature, again returning to it final authority over hiring state employees. The legislature passed acts in 1895 that removed the last of the governor&#x27;s authority to appoint anyone to executive positions.

With the onset of the Great Depression in the 1930s, the governors again began to reassert authority. The Executive Reorganization Act was passed, returning the governor to a considerable level of appointment power. New state welfare and regulatory agencies were placed directly under the governor&#x27;s control, greatly expanding his role in running the state and creating many patronage positions. The legislature responded by trying to create a merit system for public offices, but it was largely unable to effectively enforce it given the new scope of government agencies. The battle with the governor continued until 1941 when the legislature rescinded the Executive Reorganization Act and replaced it with the State Administration Act, which placed most of the government under the control of elected commissioners and reduced the governor&#x27;s practical executive authority to commander of the militia and the executor of legislation. The matter was taken to the Indiana Supreme Court in the case of &quot;Tucker v. State&quot;. The court ruled for the first time that the governor was in fact the Chief Executive of the state, and that the legislature could pass no law that infringed upon that right. The decision was a major shift from previous court decisions and granted governors a legal basis to resist future encroachment on their powers.

During the 1970s, a series of amendments was passed under popular governors that also increased their powers. The state courts were again made appointive, but the selection of the candidates was granted to the court-dominated Indiana Judicial Nominating Commission. However, the governor was given more control over the process in which he previously had none. Another amendment removed the ban on consecutive terms, allowing Indiana&#x27;s first consecutive term governors in over one hundred years. A third amendment granted the power to prepare a budget to a State Budgetary Agency, which was run by officials appointed by the governor. The significant authority this gave the governor over the budget was the &quot;greatest transfer of power&quot; to the governor yet, according to historian and professor of political science Linda Gugin.

Despite gaining considerable power during the mid-twentieth-century, Indiana&#x27;s governor remains fairly weak compared to his counterparts in other states. He has no line-item veto authority, and the pocket veto was ruled unconstitutional. If a governor does not sign or reject a bill, it becomes law automatically. This led to a fistfight during the term of Claude Matthews, who was locked out of the House chambers to prevent him from returning a bill in time. The legislature can override a veto with a simple majority, as opposed to a supermajority that is required federally and in most other states. The legislature still exercises final control over the hiring of state employees, but given the large size of the government and the short legislative sessions, they are unable to make any considerable impact other than their continued advocacy for an expanded merit system. The cabinet is still almost entirely independent of the governor, and he has control over only half of the government&#x27;s agencies, such as the Indiana State Police and the Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles. Other large agencies, such as the Department of Administration, are under the control of the cabinet.

===Veto usage===

During the state&#x27;s early history, vetoes were seldom employed by governors primarily because they were seen as only symbolic since the General Assembly could override them with only a simple majority. Governor James Whitcomb was the first to make significant use of the power and vetoed a record of fifteen bills during a single legislative session. Roger Branigin, who presided over a hostile legislature, made the most total vetoes of any governor, returning a total of one hundred bills to the assembly. Despite the fact that vetoes are easily overridden, only around ten percent of vetoed bills are overridden. During the 1970s, for example, 117 bills were vetoed, but only eleven were overridden. Observers and historians attribute this to the short length of legislative sessions, which often do not allow enough time for a large number of bills to pass through both houses twice. Another factor is that legislators of the same party as the governor typically refuse to override his veto, even in cases where they supported the bill originally.

===General Assembly relations===

The governor&#x27;s relationship with the General Assembly has typically been the determining factor in his success at enacting his agenda, although other factors also play an important role. In most of Indiana&#x27;s history, the governor has come to power at a time in which his party controlled the assembly. Since the political parties first became dominant in 1831 and until 2010, thirty-three sessions of the legislature have been divided with different parties controlling the House and Senate. Only five sessions have occurred where the legislature was entirely controlled by the opposition party, while in ninety-eight sessions the governor&#x27;s party controlled the entire assembly.

Governors who had previously been legislators have generally had greater success in achieving their legislative goals while governor. Three speakers of the house have become governor. Governor Joseph A. Wright had the worst relations of any governor with the assembly. He twice delivered speeches to a joint session where he harangued them for what he perceived to be corruption, accusing them of taking bribes from the Bank of Indiana. The legislature responded by overriding all his anti-banking vetoes. He was so disliked by his own party that he was expelled from it after his term.

===Traits===

Except for James Whitcomb, all of Indiana&#x27;s governors have been married at the time of their election. Whitcomb married while in office. About half of the governors have been married multiple times, all due to the death of their first wives. Three governors&#x27; wives, including Whitcomb&#x27;s, died while their husbands were in office. Except for Jonathan Jennings, Thomas R. Marshall and Eric Holcomb, all of the state governors have also had children. After leaving office, Marshall adopted a young boy. Only twenty of Indiana&#x27;s governors were native to the state. Seven were born in Pennsylvania, four born in Ohio, and four born in Kentucky. Other governors have come from Michigan, Virginia, New York, and Vermont.

Territorial Governor William Henry Harrison was appointed to office at age twenty-seven, making him the youngest executive. James B. Ray, elevated at thirty-one and reelected at thirty-two, was the youngest governor to be elected to office. Evan Bayh, at age thirty-four, is the only other governor under the age of forty to be elected. James D. Williams, at age sixty-nine, was the oldest governor to be elected and died in office at age seventy-two. The average age of governors at the time of their election is fifty.

Thirty-two of Indiana&#x27;s governors have served in the military. Veteran organizations have served as a gateway for the governorship. Ira J. Chase served as leader of the Grand Army of the Republic. Paul V. McNutt, Ralph F. Gates, and George N. Craig were leaders of the American Legion, whose national headquarters is in Indianapolis. Thirty governors have been lawyers by profession, and three have been farmers. Thirty received a college education, with eleven of them having attended Indiana University. Several governors have gone on to higher office, with nine serving in the United States Senate, and three serving as Vice President of the United States.

==Gubernatorial elections==

Under the original constitution of 1816, the state held gubernatorial elections every three years. The first election was held before statehood was approved, in August 1816. Until the constitution was replaced in 1851, elections were held in October, and winners took office in December. In 1851, Indiana adopted its second and current constitution, which banned governors from serving consecutive terms and lengthened terms to four years. Elections since then have been held on Election Day in November during years divisible by four, concurrent with presidential elections. In 1972, the constitution was amended to allow governors to immediately succeed themselves. As mentioned above, the amendment limited a governor to a total of eight years in office during a 12-year period, effectively limiting them to two consecutive terms.

<doc id="253074" wikidata="Q4151335" url="?curid=253074" title="Governor of Kentucky">
<text>The governor of the Commonwealth of Kentucky is the head of government in Kentucky. Sixty-two men and one woman have served as governor of Kentucky. The governor&#x27;s term is four years in length; since 1992, incumbents have been able to seek re-election once before becoming ineligible for four years. Throughout the state&#x27;s history, four men have served two non-consecutive terms as governor, and four others have served two consecutive terms, the most recent being current governor Andy Beshear, who was re-elected to a second term on November 7, 2023. Kentucky is one of only five U.S. states that hold gubernatorial elections in odd-numbered years. 

The governor&#x27;s powers are enumerated in the state constitution. There have been four constitutions of Kentucky—adopted in 1792, 1799, 1850, and 1891, respectively—and each has enlarged the governor&#x27;s authority. Among the powers assigned to the governor in the constitution are the ability to grant pardons, veto legislation, and call the legislature into session. The governor serves as commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces and is empowered to enforce all laws of the state. The officeholder is given broad statutory authority to make appointments to the various cabinets and departments of the executive branch, limited somewhat by the adoption of a merit system for state employees in 1960. Because Kentucky&#x27;s governor controls so many appointments to commissions, the office has been historically considered one of the most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor&#x27;s influence has been augmented by wide discretion in awarding state contracts and significant influence over the legislature, although the latter has been waning since the mid-1970s.

The history of the office of Governor is largely one of long periods of domination by a single party, though different parties were predominant in different eras. Federalists were rare among Kentuckians during the period of the First Party System, and Democratic Republicans won every gubernatorial election in the state until 1828. The Second Party System began when the Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats (the predecessor of the modern Democratic Party) and National Republicans (later to become Whigs). Beginning with the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828, the Whigs dominated the governorship until 1851, with John Breathitt being the only Democrat elected during that period.

With the collapse of the Whig Party in the 1850s, Democrats took control of the governorship for the duration of the Third Party System, with Charles S. Morehead of the Know Nothing Party being the only exception. The election of Republican William O&#x27;Connell Bradley in 1895 began the only period of true two-party competition for the governorship; from Bradley&#x27;s election through 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor of Kentucky. Since 1931, only four Republicans have served as governor of Kentucky, and no Republican governor has ever been re-elected; the most recent past governor, Matt Bevin, lost re-election.

==Powers and responsibilities==

In all four Kentucky constitutions, the first power enumerated to the governor is to serve as commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s militia and military forces. In 1799, a stipulation was added that the governor would not personally lead troops on the battlefield unless advised to do so by a resolution of the General Assembly. Such a case occurred in 1813 when Governor Isaac Shelby, a veteran of the Revolutionary War, was asked to lead a band of Kentucky troops to aid William Henry Harrison at the Battle of the Thames. For his service, Shelby received the Thanks of Congress and the Congressional Gold Medal.

Among the other powers and responsibilities of the governor that appear in all four constitutions are the power to enforce all laws, the power to fill vacancies in elected offices until the next meeting of the General Assembly, and the power to remit fines and grant pardons. The power to pardon is not applicable to cases of impeachment, and in cases of treason, a gubernatorial pardon is only effective until the end of the next session of the General Assembly, which can grant a full pardon for treason. The 1891 constitution further required that, with each application for a pardon, the governor file &quot;a statement of the reasons for his decision thereon, which ... shall always be open to public inspection.&quot; This requirement was first proposed by a delegate to the 1850 constitutional convention, but it was rejected at that time. Historically, power in Kentucky&#x27;s executive has been split amongst a variety of elected positions—including Lieutenant Governor, Attorney General, Auditor of Public Accounts, Treasurer, and several commissioners—but in the late 20th century, political power has centralized in the office of Governor.

===Convening and adjourning the legislature===
The power of the governor to adjourn the General Assembly for a period of up to four months if the two houses cannot agree on a time to adjourn appears in all four constitutions. The governor is also empowered to convene the General Assembly &quot;on extraordinary occasions&quot;. Since the 1799 constitution, the governor has been permitted to call the legislature into session somewhere other than the state capital if the capital had, since the last legislative session, &quot;become dangerous from an enemy or from contagious diseases.&quot; This was an important provision in the early days of the Commonwealth, when epidemics like smallpox posed a danger to the populace. One notable example of an attempt to employ this power was in 1900 when Republican governor William S. Taylor attempted to adjourn the legislature and re-convene it in heavily Republican London, Kentucky following the shooting of William Goebel. Taylor claimed a state of insurrection existed in the capital, but defiant Democrats refused to heed the call to adjourn or to convene in London.

The 1891 constitution added a provision that the governor must specify the reason for any specially called legislative session, and that no other business could be considered during the session. There is, however, no constitutional requirement that the legislature conduct any business during the called session. In 2007, Republican governor Ernie Fletcher called the Assembly into session to consider a long list of items. The Democratically controlled House of Representatives maintained that none of the items were urgent enough that they could not wait until the regular session convened; they claimed that Fletcher was calling the session only to boost his sagging poll numbers before the upcoming election in which he faced a challenge from Democrat Steve Beshear. The House convened on the day appointed and adjourned an hour later without transacting any business.

===Veto===
Unlike the U.S. President, the governor does not have the option of a pocket veto. If the governor does not make a decision to sign or veto a bill, it automatically becomes law after 10 days. In the event that the legislature adjourns to prevent the return of a bill by veto, the bill becomes law three days after the commencement of the next legislative session unless the governor explicitly vetoes it. (With the federal pocket veto, the bill is considered vetoed after ten days if the legislature adjourns.)

The 1799 constitution contained, for the first time, the power of the governor to veto legislation; this power was substantially similar to, and probably based upon, that found in the 1792 New Hampshire Constitution and the 1798 Georgia Constitution. The 1891 constitution empowered the governor with a line-item veto, but its use was forbidden on constitutional amendments and laws related to the classification of property for tax purposes. The governor&#x27;s veto can be overridden by roll-call majority votes of both houses of the legislature; unlike in most states where a supermajority is required to override a veto.

===Budget===
Although setting the state budget is a legislative function in many states, Kentucky governors are required by statute to present a proposed biennial budget to the General Assembly for approval shortly after the beginning of its even-year sessions. The governor&#x27;s budget has often been approved with few changes, but since the Republicans took control of the state senate for the first time in 1999, approval has become a much more contentious process. The General Assembly failed to pass a budget before the end of its session in both 2002 and 2004. In both cases, the state operated under an executive spending plan drafted by the governor until the legislature could re-convene and pass a budget. In 2005 the Kentucky Supreme Court ruled that the governor had no authority to expend funds without legislative approval, and that if legislators failed to pass a budget in the future, only expenditures explicitly authorized in the state constitution could be made.

===Administration and appointments===
Although the Kentucky constitution designates the governor as the head of the executive branch of state government, it does not specify the means of carrying out that role. Empowered to nominate all constitutional officers by the state&#x27;s first constitution, that power of the office of the governor has been reduced in subsequent constitutions, as more of those offices became elective. Because the governor is not explicitly authorized by the constitution to conduct many of the functions necessary to administer the state government, the officeholder has had to rely on empowering legislation enacted by the General Assembly. With this in mind, Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark wrote in 2004 that extensive executive powers had been granted through the creation of a large number of commissions that reported to the governor:
During the past century and a half, and especially in the later 20th century, it would have been impossible for state government to operate efficiently without a broadening of executive powers. Through the years the General Assembly has created a myriad of commissions and turned them over to the governor to exercise administrative oversight. ... All of these commissions extended the influence of the governor into every phase of human life in the commonwealth, well beyond the limitations of executive power envisioned by delegates to the constitutional convention in 1891.

By 1934, the executive branch consisted of sixty-nine boards, commissions, and agencies in addition to the constitutional officers, although the members of these commissions were often the constitutional officers themselves. Governor Ruby Laffoon proposed the Administrative Reorganization Act of 1934 to organize these boards and commissions into seventeen executive departments and seven independent agencies. The General Assembly passed this legislation, giving the executive branch some semblance of structure for the first time.
Laffoon&#x27;s successor, Happy Chandler, called a special legislative session in 1936 seeking passage of another reorganization act. This act abolished several commissions and organized those remaining into ten statutory departments: Finance, Revenue, Highways, Health, Welfare, Industrial Relations, Business Regulation, Conservation, Libraries and Archives, and Mines and Minerals. The Act also created the Executive Cabinet, consisting of the constitutional officers and the heads of each of the ten statutory departments. The efficiencies created by Chandler&#x27;s reorganization allowed him to pay off more than three-quarters of the state&#x27;s $28.5 million debt. Besides effecting the reorganization of the executive branch, the Reorganization Act of 1936 also explicitly empowered the governor to appoint executive department heads and establish, combine, or divide departments as necessary. Later statutes gave the governor the power to appoint advisory committees on reorganization, appoint deputy heads of divisions, transfer employees and change their responsibilities within the executive branch, and establish general rules of conduct for executive branch members.

In the 35 years between the time of Chandler&#x27;s reorganization and the election of Wendell H. Ford as governor in 1971, the executive branch had again become unwieldy. 60 departments and 210 boards reported directly to the governor by 1972, and duplication of services between departments had created inefficiencies. On January 1, 1973, a plan that Ford had issued in late 1972 took effect, consolidating the departments reporting to him into six program cabinets: Consumer Protection and Regulation, Development, Education and the Arts, Human Resources, Safety and Justice, and Transportation. Ford continued merging departments and reorganizing the executive branch throughout 1973 to the extent that, by the end of the year, there were only three program cabinets (Development, Education and the Arts, and Consumer Protection and Regulation) and four additional departments (Human Resources, Justice, Natural Resources and Environmental Protection, and Transportation).

By 2002, the executive branch had again grown to fourteen cabinets, but had no additional departments. Shortly after his election in 2003, Governor Ernie Fletcher undertook the last major reorganization of the executive branch to date, reducing the number of cabinets to nine—Justice and Public Safety, Education and Workforce Development, Environmental and Public Protection, Transportation, Economic Development, Health and Family Services, Finance and Administration, Tourism, Arts and Heritage, and Personnel.

Because the governor controls so many appointments to commissions—approximately 2,000 according to a 1992 estimate—the office has been historically considered one of the most powerful state executive positions in the United States. Additionally, the governor is given wide discretion in awarding state contracts, further augmenting his influence. In the second half of the 20th century, attempts were made to curb the use of the governor&#x27;s appointment power for political patronage. During his second term in office, Happy Chandler issued an executive order creating a merit system that forbade the hiring or firing of state employees for political reasons; his successor, Bert Combs, pushed a new merit system through the legislature, protecting it from abolition by executive order. Despite the presence of the merit system, many governors have been criticized for abusing their appointment power. In 2005, Ernie Fletcher and several members of his administration were indicted for violating the merit system in their hiring practices; the charges were later dropped as part of an agreement with the prosecutor, Attorney General Greg Stumbo.

===Unofficial powers===
In &quot;The Kentucky Encyclopedia&quot;, Eastern Kentucky University professor Paul Blanchard writes that &quot;Many observers consider the governor&#x27;s informal powers—those derived from tradition, custom, and precedent—as important as the formal powers.&quot; Frequently the leaders of their political parties at the state level, Kentucky governors usually control the party&#x27;s delegations to state and national party conventions. Though given few powers with regard to the legislature, Kentucky governors can exercise a great deal of influence over the General Assembly, often hand-selecting the leadership of both chambers. A move toward a more independent legislature began in the last quarter of the 20th century, particularly during the administration of Governor John Y. Brown Jr. from 1979 to 1983. Brown was much less engaged in legislative affairs than his predecessors; he did not seek to influence the selection of the legislature&#x27;s leadership, and he left on vacation during one of the two legislative sessions of his term. The trend toward a coequal legislature continued under the administrations of Brown&#x27;s two immediate successors, Martha Layne Collins and Wallace Wilkinson, neither of whom was considered a strong executive.

The governor is also the most visible state officer and is the center of political attention in the Commonwealth. The official host of the state when dignitaries visit, the governor frequently delivers addresses at various dedications and ceremonies, and appears on national television with the winner of the annual Kentucky Derby. The state constitution requires the governor to address the legislature periodically regarding the state of the Commonwealth. This address, traditionally given annually, is often targeted directly at the state&#x27;s citizens as much as, or more so than, the legislature. The governor can use the address to extol the accomplishments of his or her term and lay out a specific plan for the upcoming legislative session; the contents of the address often shape the agenda of the session. The state&#x27;s media outlets devote significant coverage to the governor&#x27;s actions, and many strong governors have used the media to win support for their agendas and criticize political enemies.

==Qualifications and term==
Candidates for the office of governor of Kentucky must be at least thirty years of age and have resided in the state for at least six years preceding the general election. The residency requirement was increased from two years to six years in the constitution of 1799 and all subsequent constitutions. The 1792 constitution—the state&#x27;s first—also included an exception for candidates who had been absent from the state &quot;on the public business of the United States or of this State.&quot; The age requirement was raised from thirty years to thirty-five years in the 1799 constitution and was returned to thirty years in the 1891 constitution.

A prohibition against any person concurrently holding the office of governor and a federal office appears in the first three state constitutions, but is absent in the state&#x27;s current charter. Additionally, the 1799 constitution barred a &quot;minister of any religious society&quot; from holding the office. This language was possibly aimed at the sitting governor, James Garrard, who was an ordained Baptist minister and had frequently clashed with the legislature. The prohibition against ministers holding the office remained in the 1850 constitution, but was removed from the 1891 constitution.

In the 1891 constitution, a section was included that forbade anyone from holding any state office—including the office of governor—who had &quot;either directly or indirectly, give[n], accept[ed] or knowingly carr[ied] a challenge to any person or persons to fight in single combat, with a citizen of this State, with a deadly weapon, either in or out of the State&quot;. This provision reflected the prevalence of duelling in the South at the time. The gubernatorial oath of office states:

The governor&#x27;s term has been for four years in all four state constitutions. The governor was not term-limited in the 1792 constitution, but in the 1799 constitution, the governor was made ineligible for re-election for seven years following the expiration of his term. The provision did not apply to then-sitting governor James Garrard, who was re-elected in 1799. In the 1850 constitution, the period of ineligibility following the expiration of the governor&#x27;s term was shortened to four years, and it remained so in the 1891 constitution. In 1953, Governor Lawrence Wetherby lamented the challenges presented by the term limit coupled with biennial legislative sessions:
A Kentucky governor is elected under our constitution for four years without legal opportunity, regardless of how acceptable his program has been, to put it before the public for approval or rejection. In practical application he must successfully run the legislative gauntlet during the first hurried ninety days he is in office if he is to adopt a program and have an administration worthy of history&#x27;s harsh pen. The remaining general assembly two years hence is invariably plagued with vicissitudes common to &#x27;lame duck&#x27; tenures.

The idea of removing the gubernatorial term limit was first proposed in the 1850 constitutional convention, but was vigorously opposed by some of the state&#x27;s best known statesmen of the day, including Archibald Dixon, Garrett Davis, Benjamin Hardin, and Charles A. Wickliffe. Not until 1992 was an amendment to the state constitution passed to help ameliorate the situation by making the governor eligible to succeed himself one time before becoming ineligible for four years. Succession amendments had been proposed and defeated during the administrations of John Y. Brown Jr. and Wallace Wilkinson, but then-Governor Brereton Jones was able to see it passed because, unlike Brown and Wilkinson, he was willing to exempt the present incumbents, including himself, from the succession provision. Paul E. Patton, with victories in the elections of 1995 and 1999, was the first governor to be elected to consecutive terms since the 1992 amendment. Another constitutional amendment, passed in November 2000, called for a 30-day legislative session to be held in odd-numbered years between the longer 60-day sessions held in even-numbered years.

==Election==
In the 1792 constitution, the governor and state senators were chosen by electors, in a manner similar to the operation of the United States Electoral College. In the 1795 gubernatorial election, Benjamin Logan received 21 electoral votes, James Garrard received 17, Thomas Todd received 14, and John Brown received 1. The constitution did not specify whether election required a plurality or a majority of the electoral votes cast; in the absence of any instruction, the electors held a runoff vote, wherein most of Todd&#x27;s electors voted for Garrard, giving him a majority. The secretary of state certified Garrard&#x27;s election, though Attorney General John Breckinridge questioned the legality of the second vote and Logan formally protested it. Ultimately, Breckinridge determined that he was not empowered by the state constitution to intervene, and Logan gave up the challenge. The 1799 constitution changed the method of selecting the governor to direct election by majority vote and prescribed that, in the event of a tie vote, the governor would be chosen by lot in the Kentucky General Assembly. This provision has remained since 1799.

After the development of the party system, it became commonplace for political parties to choose their nominees for the office of governor via a nominating convention. Thomas Metcalfe was the first gubernatorial candidate chosen by a nominating convention; he was nominated by the National Republican Party at their convention in December 1827. Governor Ruby Laffoon, elected in 1931, was the last governor of Kentucky nominated by a convention. Laffoon&#x27;s lieutenant governor, Happy Chandler, pushed the legislature to mandate party primaries, which
they did in 1935. Party primaries remain required by law today. In 1992, the state constitution was amended to require candidates for governor and lieutenant governor to be nominated and elected as a ticket.

Kentucky is one of only five U.S. states to hold gubernatorial elections in odd-numbered years—commonly called an off-year election. Louisiana, Mississippi, Virginia, and New Jersey also hold off-year gubernatorial elections. The general election for governor and lieutenant governor is held on the first Tuesday after the first Monday in November. The governor and lieutenant governor are inaugurated on the fifth Tuesday after their election. This was changed from the fourth Tuesday after the election by the 1850 constitution.

==Succession==

Under Kentucky&#x27;s first constitution (1792), the Speaker of the Kentucky Senate became acting governor upon the death, resignation, or removal of the sitting governor from office, until a new election could be held. The 1799 constitution created the office of lieutenant governor, who acted as Speaker of the Senate, but was not otherwise considered a member of that body. The lieutenant governor was to become governor in the event of the sitting governor&#x27;s death, resignation, or removal from office and was to act in a gubernatorial capacity any time the governor was out of the state. Whenever the lieutenant governor became the new governor, the Senate was to elect one of its members to act as Speaker; that individual then became next in the line of gubernatorial succession. A provision of the 1850 constitution added that, if the governor&#x27;s term had more than two years remaining at the time of his death, resignation, or removal from office, a special election would be called to fill the office; the lieutenant governor would become the new governor and serve in the interim.

In the 1891 constitution, the chain of succession was extended. It mandated that, if the Senate was not in session and therefore did not have an elected Speaker, the secretary of state, or in the event of his inability to qualify, the attorney general, would become acting governor in the event of the death, resignation, or removal from office of the sitting governor and lieutenant governor. The secretary of state or attorney general would then be required to call the Senate into session to elect a Speaker, who would subsequently become governor. A 1992 amendment to the state constitution removed the provision under which the lieutenant governor became acting governor when the sitting governor was out of the state. It also relieved the lieutenant governor of his duties in the Senate and created the office of President of the Kentucky Senate, chosen from among the state senators, who presides over the Senate. The amendment also modified the chain of succession again—it is now as follows:
#Governor (Andy Beshear)
#Lieutenant Governor (Jacqueline Coleman)
#President of the Senate (if the Senate is in session) (Robert Stivers)
#Attorney General (if the Senate is not in session) (Russell Coleman)
#State Auditor (if the Senate is not in session and the Attorney General fails to qualify) (Allison Ball)

If the office devolves upon the attorney general or state auditor, that individual is required to call the Senate into session to elect a president, who would subsequently become governor.

The first instance of gubernatorial succession in Kentucky&#x27;s history occurred upon the death of Governor George Madison in 1816. Madison was extremely popular as a twice-wounded war hero. He died of tuberculosis just three weeks into his term. His lieutenant governor, Gabriel Slaughter, ascended to the governorship and immediately made two very unpopular appointments. These moves engendered much animosity toward Slaughter, and a movement began in the House of Representatives to hold a new election for governor. Leaders of the movement, including a young John C. Breckinridge, claimed that Slaughter was only the &quot;acting governor&quot; until a new governor was elected. The call for a new election failed in the House in 1815, but was approved by the House in 1817 only to fail in the Senate. Slaughter served out the rest of Madison&#x27;s term and in so doing, established the precedent that the lieutenant governor would be the permanent successor to the governor upon the latter&#x27;s death, resignation, or removal from office.

Besides Madison, four other governors have died while in office—John Breathitt, James Clark, John L. Helm, and William Goebel. All died of natural causes except Goebel, who is the only governor of any U.S. state to have been assassinated. Goebel lost the contentious 1899 gubernatorial election to William S. Taylor, but challenged the results. While the General Assembly was considering the challenge, Goebel was shot. Days later, the General Assembly decided in favor of Goebel, ousting Taylor from office and making Goebel governor. Goebel was sworn in on his sick bed and died two days later. His lieutenant governor, J. C. W. Beckham, succeeded him.

7 men have resigned the office of governor before the end of their terms—John J. Crittenden, Beriah Magoffin, John W. Stevenson, Augustus O. Stanley, Happy Chandler, Earle C. Clements, and Wendell H. Ford. 6 resigned to accept a higher office: Crittenden was appointed Attorney General of the United States and the other 5 were elected to the U.S. Senate. Only Beriah Magoffin resigned under duress. A Confederate sympathizer during the Civil War, Magoffin&#x27;s power was entirely checked by a hostile, pro-Union legislature. With the state&#x27;s government in gridlock, Magoffin agreed to resign in exchange for being able to name his successor. Lieutenant Governor Linn Boyd had died in office, and the Speaker of the Senate, John F. Fisk, was not acceptable to Magoffin as a successor. Fisk resigned as Speaker, and the Senate elected Magoffin&#x27;s choice, James Fisher Robinson as Speaker. Magoffin then resigned, Robinson was elevated to governor, and Fisk was re-elected as Speaker of the Senate.

All elected officials in Kentucky, including the governor, are subject to impeachment for &quot;any misdemeanors in office&quot;. The articles of impeachment must be issued by the House of Representatives and the trial is conducted by the Senate. If convicted, the governor is subject to removal from office and may be prohibited from holding elected office in the state thereafter. Impeached governors may also be subject to trial in the criminal or civil court system. No governor of Kentucky has been impeached.

==Compensation and residence==
Each iteration of the Kentucky Constitution has provided that the governor receive a salary. Under the first three constitutions, the governor&#x27;s salary could not be increased or reduced while he was in office; this provision was extended to all public officials in the present constitution. The governor&#x27;s salary is set by law, and is equal to $60,000 times the increase in the consumer price index between January 1, 1984, and the beginning of the current calendar year. In 2014, the governor&#x27;s salary was $186,730.

The Kentucky Governor&#x27;s Mansion is the official residence of the governor of Kentucky. The present Governor&#x27;s Mansion, constructed in 1914 and listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1972, is located at 704 Capitol Avenue in the state capital of Frankfort. It is the second building to serve as the official residence of the governor of Kentucky. The Kentucky Revised Statutes provide that &quot;[t]he Governor shall have the use of the mansion and the furniture therein and premises, free of rent, but the purchase of furniture for the mansion shall be upon the recommendation of the secretary of the Finance and Administration Cabinet&quot;.

The state&#x27;s first governor&#x27;s mansion was constructed during the gubernatorial tenure of James Garrard. According to tradition, future governors Thomas Metcalfe (a stonemason) and Robert P. Letcher (who worked at his father&#x27;s brickyard) participated in the construction of the first governor&#x27;s mansion. After the construction of the present governor&#x27;s mansion, the old governor&#x27;s mansion became the official residence of the lieutenant governor. Lieutenant governor Steve Henry vacated the mansion in 2002 so it could be renovated; following the renovation, it became a state guest house and official entertainment space for the governor. For many years, the mansion was the oldest official residence still in use in the United States. Located at 420 High Street in Frankfort, it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1971.

==History of the office==

Political parties had developed in the United States before Kentucky became a state. Because most early Kentuckians were Virginians, they naturally allied with the Democratic-Republicans, the party of Thomas Jefferson and James Madison; the latter was a cousin of George Madison, the state&#x27;s sixth governor. Political victories were few and far between for Federalists in Kentucky, and none of Kentucky&#x27;s governors were members of the Federalist Party. Military service was the most important consideration for voters in Kentucky&#x27;s early gubernatorial elections. John Breathitt, elected Kentucky&#x27;s eleventh governor in 1832, was the first Kentucky governor not to have served in the military.

The Federalist Party had died out nationally by 1820, but new party divisions were soon to form in Kentucky. The Panic of 1819 left many Kentuckians deeply in debt and without a means of repaying their creditors. Two factions grew up around the issue of debt relief. Those who favored laws favorable to debtors were dubbed the &quot;Relief Party&quot; and those who favored laws protecting creditors were called the &quot;Anti-Relief Party&quot;. While not formal political parties—members of both factions still considered themselves Democratic-Republicans—these factions defined the political dialogue of the 1820s in Kentucky. The debt relief issue began under Gabriel Slaughter, who identified with the Anti-Relief Party, but Slaughter&#x27;s two immediate successors, John Adair and Joseph Desha, were members of the Relief Party. The struggle between the two parties culminated in the Old Court – New Court controversy, an attempt by the pro-relief legislature to abolish the Court of Appeals because the court overturned some debt relief measures as unconstitutional. The controversy ended with the restoration of the Old Court over Desha&#x27;s veto in late 1826.

Although many Old Court supporters—typically the state&#x27;s wealthy aristocracy—gravitated to the National Republican Party (later to be called Whigs) that formed in the 1820s, it is inaccurate to assume the Anti-Relief Party as a whole became National Republicans and the Relief Party became Democrats. The primary factor in determining which party Kentuckians aligned with was their faith in Whig Party founder and native son, Henry Clay. From the election of Thomas Metcalfe in 1828 to the expiration of John L. Helm&#x27;s term in 1851, only one Democrat held the office of governor: John Breathitt, who died a year and a half into his term and was succeeded in office by his lieutenant governor, James Turner Morehead, a National Republican.

Following the collapse of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions gripped the state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all else, a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.

From the close of the Civil War until 1895, Kentuckians elected a series of Bourbon Democrats with Confederate sympathies as governor, including two men—James B. McCreary and Simon Bolivar Buckner—who had served in the Confederate States Army. The Democratic dominance was broken by William O&#x27;Connell Bradley, who was elected the state&#x27;s first Republican governor in 1895. Bradley&#x27;s election marked the beginning of thirty years of true, two-party competition for the governorship in the state. Between 1895 and 1931, five Republicans and six Democrats held the office of governor. Since 1931, however, the Republicans have been unable to preserve this level of parity, and in that period only four of the twenty elected governors have been from the Republican party.

<text>The governor of Louisiana (; ) is the chief executive of the U.S. state government of Louisiana. The governor also serves as the commander in chief of the Louisiana National Guard. Republican Jeff Landry has held the office since January 8, 2024.

== History ==
Louisiana ratified its first constitution in 1812. The document provided for a governor who would serve a four-year term and was responsible for appointing all non-elected state officials, making the holder of the office one of the most powerful such executives in the United States at the time. Candidates for the office were limited to white men of at least 35 years of age who held at least $5,000 worth in landed property. Popular gubernatorial elections were held, but the Louisiana State Legislature was given the responsibility of deciding the winner from among the two top-performing candidates. Governors were forbidden from holding consecutive terms. William C. C. Claiborne served as the state&#x27;s first governor.

The 1845 constitution eliminated minimum property requirements for gubernatorial candidates and ensured the governor would be chosen directly by popular vote. In 1879, governors were authorized to hold successive terms, but this was eliminated in the 1898 constitution. After the 1930s and 1940s, governors increasingly had to manage their image over mass media while their staffs grew in size. In the 1960s, governors assumed responsibility over executing federally-funded programs. In 1966, the state constitution was amended to permit governors to seek consecutive terms in office. The 1974 constitution imposed term limits on the governor and weakened the qualifications for candidates seeking the office.

== Election ==
Only qualified voters in Louisiana are eligible to be elected governor. Any candidates for the office must be at least 25 years of age and have resided in the state for the five previous years. Gubernatorial elections in Louisiana occur concurrently with the elections of other statewide officials in the year prior to the United States&#x27; next presidential election. The governor serves a four-year term and may serve no more than two terms consecutively. There are no limits on nonconsecutive terms. Winning candidates traditionally take office in public inaugural ceremonies accompanied by a speech and followed by a ball.

== Powers and duties ==
=== Executive authority and responsibilities ===
The governor is the chief executive of state government in Louisiana, though they share executive authority with other elected officials. They are empowered to request agency heads in state government to report to them on subjects relating to the operation of governmental departments. They are &quot;ex officio&quot; commander in chief of Louisiana&#x27;s armed forces—except when the guard is pressed into federal service—and are authorized to call it into service &quot;to preserve law and order, to suppress insurrection, to repel invasion, or in other times of emergency.&quot; They are empowered to grant pardons, reprieves, and commutations to convicted criminals.

=== Legislative authority and responsibilities ===
The governor is constitutionally required to report the legislature on &quot;the affairs of state, including its complete financial condition&quot; at the beginnings of their regular sessions. The constitution also obligates the governor to submit an annual operating budget proposal to the legislature as well as a &quot;five-year capital outlay program&quot; during each such session. The governor can exercise veto power over all bills passed by the legislature except proposed constitutional amendments. They have line-item veto power over appropriations bills and are constitutionally obligated to issue line-item vetoes when necessary to ensure that state government operates on a balanced budget. A veto can be overridden by a two-thirds majority vote of the legislature. The governor is also empowered to call the legislature into special session at their discretion to consider matters of their choosing.

== Vacancies and succession ==

Article 4, Section 14 of the state constitution enumerates the line of succession in the event there is a permanent vacancy in the governor&#x27;s office. The position of governor passes sequentially as follows: first to the lieutenant governor, then the secretary of state, then the attorney general, then the state treasurer, then the presiding officer of the Senate, and finally the Speaker of the House. They serve the remainder of the original governor&#x27;s term. In the event of the governor&#x27;s momentary absence from Louisiana, the constitution tasks the lieutenant governor with serving as acting governor. While there is no firm legal direction regarding temporary succession in the event both the governor and lieutenant governor are out of state at the same time, in practice the position of acting governor is passed down the line of succession enumerated for permanent vacancies.

== Office structure ==
The office of the governor is made up of several departments: Chief of Staff&#x27;s Office, Deputy Chiefs of Staff, Special Assistants to the Governor, Communications and Press, Constituent Services, Legal, Legislative Affairs, Policy, Programs and Planning, the Office of Coastal Activities, Boards and Commissions, Finance and Administration, and the Office of Elderly Affairs. There are 12 executive agencies under the governor&#x27;s purview. The appointed secretaries which lead the agencies constitute the governor&#x27;s cabinet. The governor&#x27;s compensation is determined by law. They collect an annual salary of $130,000.

== Political dynamics ==
Governors usually informally serve as the state leader of whatever political party to which they belong. In this political capacity they often raise funds for their party, recruit candidates for elections, and advocate for major policy proposals. Vetoes issued by governors of the state are typically not overturned.

<text>The governor of New Hampshire is the head of government of the U.S. state of New Hampshire.

The governor is elected during the biennial state general election in November of even-numbered years. New Hampshire is one of only two states, along with bordering Vermont, to hold gubernatorial elections every two years as opposed to every four. Currently, the state&#x27;s 83rd governor is Republican Kelly Ayotte, who has served since January 9, 2025. 

In New Hampshire, the governor has no term limit of any kind. Only two governors have served more than three terms since the 18th century (when the term was for only one year), John Lynch, who won a fourth two-year term on November 2, 2010, and Chris Sununu, who won a fourth two-year term on November 8, 2022. John Taylor Gilman had been the last governor before Lynch to serve longer than six years, serving 14 one-year terms as governor between 1794 and 1816. Gilman is one of seven governors to serve non-consecutive terms, the others being John Langdon, John Sullivan, William Plumer, Benjamin Pierce, James A. Weston, and John Gilbert Winant.

Unlike in many other states in which executive councils are merely advisory, the Executive Council of New Hampshire has a strong check on the governor&#x27;s power. The five-member council has a veto over many actions of the governor. Together, the governor and Executive Council approve contracts with a value of $5,000 or more, approve pardons, and appoint the directors and commissioners, judges, the attorney general and officers in the National Guard.

To be qualified to be governor, one must be 30 years of age, a registered voter, and domiciled in New Hampshire for at least seven years.

==Title==
Traditionally, the governors of the colonial Province of New Hampshire were titled as &quot;President of New Hampshire&quot;, beginning with the appointment of the province&#x27;s first president, John Cutt, in 1679. After independence, from 1786 to 1791, &quot;President of the State of New Hampshire&quot; was the official style of the position. The New Hampshire Constitution was amended in 1791 to replace &quot;President&quot; with &quot;Governor&quot;.

== Function ==
The Constitution of New Hampshire details the duties and powers of the governor:
* Act as a supreme executive magistrate
* Shall be responsible for the faithful execution of the laws
* When a disagreement exists between the two legislative chambers, the governor with advice of the executive council shall have the right to adjourn or prorogue the general court
* The governor may direct a session of the General Court to be held at another location within the state in cases where there is danger to the health or lives of the members
* Power to veto bills and resolutions presented to the governor by the General Court
* Nomination of all judicial officers, the attorney general, and all officers of the militia with the approval of the executive council
* Act as the commander-in-chief for all military forces of the state
* Power to pardon offenses, except those convicted by the Senate and impeached by the House
* Money issued out of the state treasury shall be by warrant under the hand of the governor and with advice of the council

==Succession==

Established by Part 2, Article 49 of the Constitution of New Hampshire.

<doc id="253082" wikidata="Q17089908" url="?curid=253082" title="Governor of New Mexico">
<text>The governor of New Mexico () is the head of government of New Mexico. The governor is the head of the executive branch of New Mexico&#x27;s state government and the commander-in-chief of the New Mexico National Guard. As noted in the governor&#x27;s seal, this gubernatorial office is a scion of the Spanish and Mexican governors of Nuevo México (1598) and the governors of the New Mexico Territory (1851). The officeholder is afforded the courtesy title of &quot;The Honorable&quot; for life. The current governor is Michelle Lujan Grisham, a Democrat, who was sworn in as the 32nd governor of New Mexico on January 1, 2019.

==History==
During the occupation of New Mexico by the United States Military starting in 1846, a military governor was appointed to oversee the area; military governors, at times, were assisted by civilian governors. In 1850, New Mexico was organized as a Territory, and the governor was appointed by the President of the United States. The office of governor was created in 1912 when New Mexico was officially admitted to the United States as the 47th state.

==Election to the governorship==
===Requirements to hold office===
Section Three of Article V of the New Mexico Constitution establishes the requirements a person must meet in order to become governor. The governor must be a citizen of the United States, be at least 30 years old, and have been a resident of New Mexico for at least five years prior to election.

===Term(s) of office===
Under Section One of Article V of the New Mexico Constitution, a governor may be elected any number of times, but not more than twice in a row. Governors serving two consecutive terms are eligible to run again after sitting out one full term.

==Relationship with lieutenant governor==
The lieutenant governor of New Mexico is elected jointly as the running mate of the gubernatorial candidate in general elections.

==Powers==
While the governor heads the Executive Branch of the New Mexico state government, the governor does not have absolute power. Other state executives, such as the lieutenant governor, the secretary of state, and the attorney general are also elected to office.
===Duties===
Responsibilities include making annual State of the State addresses to the New Mexico State Legislature, submitting the budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced. 

==Residence==
Since 1954, the Governor of New Mexico has resided in the New Mexico Governor&#x27;s Mansion. Prior to its construction, the governor&#x27;s residence was located adjacent to the New Mexico State Capitol in downtown Santa Fe. Before 1909, the governor resided in the Palace of the Governors, which is listed as a National Historic Landmark. The Palace of the Governors is the oldest continuously occupied public building in the United States.

==Line of succession==

According to Section Seven of Article V of the New Mexico Constitution, in the event of the death, resignation, removal, impeachment, absence from the state, failure to qualify, or incapacity due to illness of the governor, the lieutenant governor is the first person in the order of succession and thus serves as governor.

If there is no lieutenant governor, or that person is unable to perform the duties of governor, the Secretary of State serves as governor. If there is no Secretary of State, the President pro Tempore of the Senate serves as governor. If there is no President pro Tempore of the Senate, or if that person is unable to perform the duties of governor, then the Speaker of the House serves as governor.

<text>The governor of North Carolina is the head of government of the U.S. state of North Carolina. Seventy-five people have held the office since the first state governor, Richard Caswell, took office in 1777. The governor serves a term of four years and chairs the collective body of the state&#x27;s elected executive officials, the Council of State. The governor&#x27;s powers and responsibilities are prescribed by the state constitution and by law. They serve as the North Carolina&#x27;s chief executive and are tasked by the constitution with faithfully carrying out the laws of the state. They are &quot;ex officio&quot; commander in chief of the North Carolina National Guard and director of the state budget. The office has some powers of appointment of executive branch officials, some judges, and members of boards and commissions. Governors are also empowered to grant pardons and veto legislation.

Historically, North Carolina has had a weak governor with limited authority. Unlike most of their counterparts in the United States, the North Carolina governor lacks line-item veto power, while additional executive authority is vested in other elected officials on the Council of State. While the state has grown increasingly politically competitive since the mid-20th century, Republicans have had difficulty in winning gubernatorial elections in North Carolina, and the office has usually remained in Democratic hands. The current governor, Democrat Josh Stein, took office on January 1, 2025.

== History ==
=== Colonial antecedent ===
The office of governor is the oldest public office in the state of North Carolina. Historians trace its origins to the appointment of Ralph Lane as the governor of the Roanoke Colony in 1585. From 1622 to 1731, the Province of Carolina/Province of North Carolina had governors appointed by the colony&#x27;s lords proprietors. From then until 1774, the governors were chosen by the British Crown. The governors during these times were politically weak executives and generally conformed to the wishes of their appointers. They were aided in the execution of their office by the Governor&#x27;s Council, an advisory board of appointed officials that also collectively served as the upper house in the North Carolina General Assembly. After 1731, the councilors were chosen by the Privy Council and were responsible to the British King, further diluting the governor&#x27;s authority.

During the period of royal control after 1731, North Carolina&#x27;s governors were issued sets of secret instructions from the Privy Council&#x27;s Board of Trade. The directives were binding upon the governor and dealt with nearly all aspects of colonial government. As they were produced by officials largely ignorant of the political situation in the colony and meant to ensure greater direct control over the territory, the instructions caused tensions between the governor and the General Assembly. The assembly controlled the colony&#x27;s finances and used this as leverage by withholding salaries and appropriations, sometimes forcing the governors to compromise and disregard some of the Board of Trade&#x27;s instructions. Frequent tensions between Governor Josiah Martin—a firm supporter of the instructions—and the Assembly in the 1770s led the latter to establish a committee of correspondence and accelerated the colony&#x27;s break with Great Britain.

=== Formation and antebellum period ===
The state of North Carolina&#x27;s first constitution in 1776—adopted by the Fifth Provincial Congress—provided for a governor to be elected by a joint vote of both houses of the General Assembly to serve a one-year term. They were limited to serving no more than three terms within a six-year period. The constitution also provided for a legislatively-determined Council of State to &quot;advise the Governor in the execution of his office&quot;. From its inception, the office of governor in North Carolina was weak in its powers, largely restricted out of fear of the actions taken by British colonial governors. In practice, the Council of State limited the governor&#x27;s executive authority, as sometimes the governor was required to get their approval before taking a course of action. The governor had no power to make executive appointments except during legislative recesses and with the advice of the council.

The Fifth Provincial Congress elected Richard Caswell to serve as the independent state&#x27;s first governor pending legislative elections and the formation of the General Assembly. Caswell was sworn in on January 16, 1777. The General Assembly reelected him to the role at its first session in April. In 1835, the constitution was amended to allow for the popular election of the governor to a two-year term, thus giving the office more political independence from the legislature. The holder of the office was restricted to no more than two terms within a six-year period. Edward Bishop Dudley became the first popularly-elected governor.

=== 1868 constitution ===

In 1868, North Carolina ratified a new constitution which extended the governor&#x27;s term of office to four years but limited the holder to one term. Under the 1868 constitution, the governor&#x27;s executive power was derived from the following provision: &quot;The executive department shall consist of a governor, in whom shall be invested the supreme executive power of the State.&quot; The new constitution also granted the governor appointive powers, allowing them to appoint &quot;all officers whose offices are established by this Constitution, or which shall be created by law, and whose appointments are not otherwise provided for&quot; with the advice and consent of the Senate. The Council of State was revised to include several other popularly-elected executive officials serving &quot;ex officio&quot;. Under the constitution, the governor called and presided over the council&#x27;s meetings but was not a formal member of the body.

In 1871, Governor William Woods Holden was impeached and removed from office. Holden was the first governor in the United States to ever be removed in such a fashion and is the only North Carolina governor to have ever been impeached. In 1875, the state held a convention which ratified several amendments to the constitution, including an alteration which removed the governor&#x27;s ability to appoint officials who derived their offices&#x27; existence from state statutes. The governor was left with &quot;de jure&quot; responsibility over appointments for constitutional officers who did not have their appointments otherwise provided for, but as no such officers existed, the changes essentially stripped governors of their appointive abilities. Following litigation in state courts over contested appointive jurisdiction in the late 19th century and early 20th century, several state governors called for the restoration of their appointive powers.

=== Constitutional and legislative enhancements ===
In 1925, the Executive Budget Act was passed, designating the governor as the director of the state budget. During the tenure of Governor O. Max Gardner from 1929 to 1933, various reforms led to the centralization of governmental services and the creation of appointive offices, thus increasing the authority and importance of the governorship. In 1933 the General Assembly approved a referendum to consider amending the constitution to grant the governor veto power over legislation, but the amendment effort failed due to technical concerns.

In the 1950s and 1960s, several governors and other observers advocated constitutional reforms, including changes which would enhance governors&#x27; executive authority. These efforts culminated in legislative debates in 1970 and the ratification of a new constitution the following year The new constitution of 1971 stipulated that &quot;The executive power of the State shall be invested in the Governor&quot;, making the official unambiguously the chief executive of the state. The constitution also affirmed the governor&#x27;s role as the director of the state budget and made them a formal &quot;ex officio&quot; member of the Council of State.

In 1977, the North Carolina constitution was amended, allowing governors to pursue re-election to a consecutive four-year term in office. This amendment strengthened the political authority of the office. Following a 1995 referendum resulting in a constitutional amendment effective the subsequent year, the governor was granted veto power, becoming the last governor in the country to be given this power. Mike Easley became the first North Carolina governor to veto legislation after rejecting a bill in 2002. While institutional enhancements increased the formal power of the governorship over the course of the 20th century, this was counteracted by a corresponding rise in the legislature&#x27;s growing willingness to assert its separate desires in state policy. In 2018, the General Assembly significantly curtailed the number of appointments which could be made by the governor, dropping appointive roles from about 1,500 to 300. The incumbent governor is Josh Stein, a Democrat who assumed office on January 1, 2025.

== Election ==

As with other state officials, only registered voters in North Carolina are eligible to be elected governor. Unlike most other candidates for statewide executive office, who must be at least 21 years of age, any potential governor must be at least 30 years of age. They must also have been a citizen of the United States for at least five years and a resident of North Carolina for at least two years preceding election. The governor is elected every four years in increments proceeding from the year 1972. They serve for a four-year term and continue in office until their successor has sworn in. Contested elections for the office of governor are resolved by a majority vote of the General Assembly.

The governor&#x27;s term of office begins on January 1 of the year following their election, but they may not exercise the duties of the office until delivering and undersigning the oath or affirmation of office before a justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court. The oath, which is identical for all state officials, is prescribed by the Article VI Section 7 of the constitution. Since 1877, new governors have often sworn their oaths in public inaugural ceremonies which are accompanied by celebratory balls and parades. They typically receive the Great Seal of the State North Carolina from the outgoing incumbent in a private meeting. The governor is limited to serving two consecutive terms in office, with no limits on nonconsecutive terms. In the event the governor-elect fails to qualify for their office, the lieutenant governor-elect becomes governor. The lieutenant governor is elected at the same time as the governor but on their own ticket.

== Powers and duties ==
=== Executive authority and responsibilities ===
The powers and duties of the governor of North Carolina are derived from the Constitution of North Carolina and state statutes. The governor is the chief executive of the state and is tasked by the constitution with faithfully carrying out the laws of the state. The governor is empowered to request agency heads in state government to report to them in writing on subjects relating to executive duties. They are authorized by the constitution to reorganize executive agencies by executive order submitted to the General Assembly, which have &quot;the force of law&quot; unless expressly disapproved by the assembly. The constitution also makes them &quot;ex officio&quot; commander in chief of the North Carolina National Guard—except when the guard is placed into federal service—and authorizes them to call it into service &quot;to execute the law&quot;. They are empowered to grant pardons and commutations to convicted criminals and serve as the state&#x27;s chief representative in intergovernmental matters. They are responsible for reviewing extradition requests from other states and issuing a governor&#x27;s warrant to detain persons for extradition. The constitution makes the governor the director of the state budget. In this capacity, the governor has the responsibility of monitoring revenue and expenditures to ensure the state maintains a balanced budget and preparing budget recommendations for the General Assembly, which can disregard the proposals in creating the state budget. The governor also administers grants and loans provided by the federal government to the state.

The office has powers of appointment with regards to executive branch officials, some judges, and members of boards and commissions. As of 2024, the governor is responsible for 300 appointments. Most executive appointments are not subject to legislative consent and many appointees serve at the pleasure of the governor. Some appointments to major state boards, including the State Board of Education and the North Carolina Utilities Commission, require confirmation from either one or both houses of the General Assembly. Cabinet secretaries are subject to confirmation from the State Senate. The governor is empowered to appoint interim officials to any vacant Council of State offices aside from the lieutenant governor without legislative assent pending the next state legislative election. They also may fill vacant judicial offices unless otherwise directed by law. Some appointments to state boards are reserved for other state officials, and the governor&#x27;s ability to remove officials has been limited by courts. The constitution also allows the governor to devolve some responsibilities upon the lieutenant governor at their discretion.

=== Legislative authority and responsibilities ===

The governor is constitutionally obligated to &quot;give the General Assembly information of the affairs of the State and recommend to their consideration such measures as he shall deem expedient&quot;. Governors traditionally fulfill this requirement with a &quot;State of the State&quot; speech delivered during the legislature&#x27;s opening session, though they can also communicate this information through separate special messages. The governor signs bills passed by the General Assembly of which they approve into law and are empowered to veto bills of which they disapprove. A veto can be overridden by a three-fifths majority vote of the assembly. Legislation can also take effect without the governor&#x27;s signature if they chose not to veto it. The governor may call the General Assembly into extraordinary session after consulting the Council of State and is required to convene the assembly in specific circumstances to review vetoed legislation.

=== Other duties ===

The governor is one of 10 constitutionally-designated members of the Council of State, a collection of elected state executives, and chairs its meetings. The body has minimal constitutional duties, with its most significant responsibilities arising from statute, including approving the governor&#x27;s acquisitions and disposals of state property. The governor is tasked by the constitution with keeping the Great Seal of the State North Carolina. The constitution empowers the governor to permit the state or a local government to incur a debt without a referendum in the event of an emergency threat to public health or safety.

The governor is constitutionally required to live at the seat of state government. Since 1891, the Executive Mansion in Raleigh has served as the official residence of the governor of North Carolina and their family. Governors and their immediate family—called the &quot;first family&quot; during the executive&#x27;s tenure—serve as symbolic leaders for the state. As the ceremonial head of the state, the governor often attends official events and performs formal functions on behalf of the state, such as meeting with important persons and leading ribbon-cutting ceremonies.

==Capacity, removal, and succession==

In the event of the governor&#x27;s absence from North Carolina, or their physical or mental incapacity, the lieutenant governor is tasked with serving as &quot;Acting Governor&quot;. In the event of the governor&#x27;s death, resignation, or removal, the lieutenant governor or whoever next available in the line of succession shall assume the governorship to complete the full term to which the original governor was elected. Constitutionally, physical incapacity can only be determined by the governor themselves; they may write to the North Carolina Attorney General that they are physically incapable of performing their duties. They can resume their duties after informing the attorney general that they are physically capable. The Council of State has the ability by majority vote to call the General Assembly into an extraordinary session to consider the governor&#x27;s mental capacity. The General Assembly can declare the governor mentally incapable with a two-thirds majority vote on a joint resolution. The assembly is required to give the governor notice of this consideration and allow them to express their own opinion on their capacity before a vote.

Aside from states of mental or physical incapacity, the only other constitutional reason to remove the governor is their commission of an impeachable offense. In the event that the governor is impeached by the North Carolina House of Representatives, the chief justice of the North Carolina Supreme Court presides over the court of impeachment. The court is composed of the State Senate, with a majority of its members serving as a quorum. While the court is engaged in its proceedings, the impeached governor is temporarily suspended from their duties. A two-thirds affirmative vote of the senators present constitutes a conviction and thus removal and future disqualification from holding office.

North Carolina&#x27;s line of gubernatorial succession is by enumerated in Article III, Section 3 of the Constitution of North Carolina and General Statutes Section 147.11.1. The line of succession passes sequentially as follows: first to the Lieutenant Governor, then the President &quot;pro tempore&quot; of the Senate, then the Speaker of the House of Representatives, then the Secretary of State, then the State Auditor, then the State Treasurer, then the Superintendent of Public Instruction, then the Attorney General, then the Commissioner of Agriculture, then the Commissioner of Labor, and finally the Commissioner of Insurance.

== Office structure ==

The governor&#x27;s office is in the State Capitol, with additional office space located in the Administration Building. The offices in the Administration Building are scheduled to be temporarily relocated to the Albemarle Building before a new facility is erected adjacent to the governor&#x27;s mansion. Regional offices are located in New Bern and Asheville to reach local governments and residents in the eastern and western portions of the state, respectively. The Asheville office also oversees management of the governor&#x27;s western residence. Another office is maintained in Washington D.C. to serve as a liaison between North Carolina&#x27;s government and both the state&#x27;s congressional delegation and the federal government. The governor is provided with a security detail supplied by the North Carolina Highway Patrol. As with all Council of State officers, the governor&#x27;s salary is fixed by the General Assembly and cannot be reduced during their term of office. In 2023, the governor&#x27;s annual salary was set at $198,120, but is set to increase to $203,073 in 2024.

The secretaries which lead executive departments under the governor&#x27;s purview collectively form the state cabinet. There are 11 cabinet-level departments: Administration, Adult Correction, Commerce, Environmental Quality, Health and Human Services, Information Technology, Military and Veterans Affairs, Natural and Cultural Resources, Public Safety, Revenue, and Transportation. The governor&#x27;s office employs a senior staff, which assist the governor in their management of the cabinet and offer advice in legislative matters. As of April 2024, the governor&#x27;s office retains 65 employees under the terms of the State Human Resources Act. The governor appoints a legal counsel who advises the governor, their cabinet, and the Council of State. The counsel also provides advice regarding legal policy matters and investigates the merits of pardons and commutations. Requests for pardons and commutations are reviewed by the Clemency Office.

The Office of State Budget and Management prepares the state budget and advises the governor on budgetary affairs. The Boards and Commissions Office advises the governor on their appointments. The Communications Office employs spokespersons for the governor and prepares press releases, speeches, and public events for them. The Policy Office crafts and considers the governors&#x27; main executive and legislative policy goals. The Education Policy Office does the same with a focus on educational matters. The Office of Constituent Services fields citizen inquires and correspondence. The Office of Citizen and Faith Outreach handles matters concerning minority groups and religion. The Legislative Affairs Office acts as a liaison between the governor and the General Assembly and reports on the progression of legislation. The Governmental Relations Office serves as a liaison between the state government, local governments, and the federal government.

== Political dynamics ==
=== Political role ===
Governors usually informally serve as the state leader of whatever political party to which they belong. They often have the ability to influence the selection of other party leaders, offer endorsements to candidates, and serve as a spokesman for their organization. As a prominent elected official, the governor enjoys media attention and high levels of public recognition and wields agenda-setting authority and the ability to influence public opinion.

=== Trends in officeholders ===

Between 1877 and 1972 all of North Carolina&#x27;s governors were Democrats, with the exception of Republican Daniel L. Russell, who won a single term to office in 1896. As Republican strength grew in North Carolina after 1950, the state&#x27;s gubernatorial elections became increasingly competitive. In 1972, James Holshouser was elected as the state&#x27;s first Republican governor of the 20th century. Even so, Republicans have still had difficulty in winning gubernatorial elections in North Carolina, and the office has usually remained in Democratic hands; since Russell&#x27;s departure in 1901, 23 Democrats and three Republicans have been elected to gubernatorial office. Beginning in the latter half of the 20th century, Democratic gubernatorial candidates have regularly outperformed their presidential counterparts. Republican gubernatorial candidates have generally attempted to link their efforts with Republican presidential campaigns, while Democratic candidates have usually placed more distance between themselves and their associated presidential contenders.

The vast majority of people who have been elected Governor of North Carolina have been male, born and raised in a rural North Carolinian environment, about 50 years of age, politically experienced, attorneys, and college educated. Most have been white Christians. Bev Perdue, elected in 2008, was the first woman to serve as governor of North Carolina. Stein is the first Jew to serve as governor. As in other states, incumbents tend to win reelection. Jim Hunt was the state&#x27;s longest-serving governor with four terms in office, serving from 1977 to 1985 and 1993 to 2001.

=== Weaknesses of powers ===
North Carolina&#x27;s governor has less overall institutional power compared to governors in other states. Their veto power is weaker than that of most of their contemporaries. It can be overridden by a three-fifths majority legislative vote, slimmer than the two-thirds majority usually required in most states. Unlike governors in most states, the North Carolina governor does not have line-item veto power. They are also prohibited from vetoing joint resolutions of the legislature, local bills, and amendments to the state and federal constitutions. The separate election of other state executive officials on the Council of State and their control over executive affairs within their own jurisdictions, as well as the General Assembly&#x27;s ability to provide for some appointments to state offices, draws authority away from the governorship. By law, the governor requires the council&#x27;s approval for certain acquisitions and disposals of state property. Increasing two-party competitiveness in North Carolina from the 1970s onward and the occurrence of divided government—when the party which controls the legislature is different from that of the governor&#x27;s affiliation—have also weakened the chief executive&#x27;s political effectiveness.

<doc id="253084" wikidata="Q3773741" url="?curid=253084" title="Governor of North Dakota">
<text>The governor of North Dakota is the head of government of North Dakota and serves as the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s military forces.

The Constitution of North Dakota specifies that &quot;the executive power is vested in the governor&quot; in Section 1. Section 7 indicates that &quot;the governor is the chief executive of the state.&quot;

==Eligibility==
According to Article 5 of the constitution, to be eligible to hold an elective office as governor, a person must be a qualified elector in North Dakota, must be at least thirty years of age on the day of the election, and must have been a resident of the state for the five years preceding election to
office.

==Dates of party conventions and gubernatorial nominations==
The dates that political parties meet to nominate official candidates for state offices varies by party.

==Dates of general elections==
The dates of the general election for the office of governor are set by the North Dakota legislative assembly. Traditionally, the general election date coincides with the U.S. presidential election which is the first Tuesday of November in even years, every four years (except when the first Tuesday falls on November 1; in that case, the general election is held on November 8).

The next gubernatorial election in North Dakota is slated for November 7, 2028.

==Current governor==
The current governor of North Dakota is Republican Kelly Armstrong. He became governor on December 15, 2024.

==Governor and lieutenant governor elected together==
According to the state constitution, the governor and the lieutenant governor must be elected on a joint ballot, or single ticket. In North Dakota, each candidate for governor appears printed on the ballot with the candidate for lieutenant governor of the same political party.

A single vote is cast for both offices; no other option is available to the voter. Therefore, a voter may not choose a single candidate for governor from one political party and a single candidate for lieutenant governor from a competing party.

==Additional gubernatorial rights, responsibilities and positions==
In addition to his role leading the executive branch offices, the governor has the right to sign or veto laws and to call the Legislative Assembly into emergency session.

The governor is also, by statute, chairman of the North Dakota Industrial Commission.

==Length and dates of term==
A governor is elected by statewide popular vote to a 4-year term.

North Dakota law specifies that a regular term of an elected governor shall commence on December 15 following the November election in an even year, for a term of precisely four years, ending on December 15 four years after the inauguration of that person.

==Date of inauguration, exceptions and inaugural celebrations==
The standard date of inauguration to the office of Governor of North Dakota is December 15 following the even-year general election.

Thus, the next scheduled inauguration of the governor will be held on December 15, 2028, for the successful candidate chosen at the November 2028 general election.

Other dates for the regularly scheduled inaugurations were mandated at various times, primarily dates in late December following the general election and several in January of the year following the general election.

There have been cases where the governor of North Dakota was inaugurated on other dates, due to the vacancy of the office of governor. These have included the resignation of the governor, the death in office of a governor, and in one instance, the judicial removal because of a felony conviction of a governor (William Langer; his conviction was later overturned and he was elected to another term).

Inaugural balls and related celebrations have been most often celebrated on the dates of gubernatorial inaugurations.

Although the current governor, Kelly Armstrong, was first inaugurated on December 15, 2024, the formal inaugural celebration was held in January 2025. The decision to conduct the celebration at a later date was made to avoid interference with the busy holiday schedules of many celebrants in December.

==Gubernatorial term limits==
In November 2022, voters approved an amendment to the North Dakota Constitution that established a lifetime limit of two four-year terms for the office of governor. The amendment only applies to individuals elected after the approval of the amendment.

Previously, there was no limit to the number of terms a governor may serve, if elected.

The longest-serving North Dakota governor was William L. Guy (1961–1973), who served four terms, two being for a two-year term and two being for a four-year term, for a total of 12 years in office. John Hoeven holds the record as the second longest-serving North Dakota governor (2000–2010).

==Non-sequential terms==
It is possible for a governor to serve non-sequential terms. William Langer is the only one who has done so.

==Official residence==
The official residence of the governor is the North Dakota Governor&#x27;s Residence in Bismarck.

<doc id="253089" wikidata="Q3773752" url="?curid=253089" title="Governor of South Carolina">
<text>The governor of South Carolina is the head of government of South Carolina. The governor is the &quot;ex officio&quot; commander-in-chief of the National Guard when not called into federal service. The governor&#x27;s responsibilities include making yearly &quot;State of the State&quot; addresses to the South Carolina General Assembly, submitting an executive budget, and ensuring that state laws are enforced.

The 117th and current governor of South Carolina is Henry McMaster, who is serving his second elected term. He assumed the office on January 24, 2017, after Nikki Haley resigned to become the United States ambassador to the United Nations. He won election to full terms in 2018 and 2022. McMaster is also the state’s longest serving governor.

==Requirements to hold office==
There are three legal requirements set forth in Section 2 of Article IV of the South Carolina Constitution. A candidate for the office of governor must be: (1) at least 30 years of age and (2) a citizen of the United States and a resident of South Carolina for 5 years preceding the day of election. The final requirement, (3) &quot;No person shall be eligible to the office of governor who denies the existence of the Supreme Being&quot;, is of extremely doubtful validity in light of the 1961 Supreme Court decision &quot;Torcaso v. Watkins&quot;, which reaffirmed that religious tests for public offices violated the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. This requirement, however, has still not been removed from the Constitution of South Carolina.

==Terms of office==
Under Section 4 in Article IV of the South Carolina Constitution, the governor serves a four-year term in office beginning at noon on the first Wednesday following the second Tuesday in January following his election. Section 3 of Article IV states that no person shall be elected governor for more than two successive terms. However, there is no limit on the total number of terms as it is not a lifetime limit. The most recent governor to serve non-consecutive terms was Olin D. Johnston, who left office in 1945.

==Powers, duties, and responsibilities==
According to the South Carolina Constitution, the governor:

*Exercises &quot;supreme executive authority.&quot;
*Appoints directors to 14 cabinet agencies, but most appointments are shared with the General Assembly.
*Serves as the commander-in-chief of the South Carolina National Guard.
*Serves as the commander-in-chief of the South Carolina State Guard, which is an auxiliary of the National Guard organized for in-state homeland defense.
*Commutes death sentences to life imprisonment. 
*Calls the General Assembly to an extra session in &quot;extraordinary circumstances.&quot;
*Adjourns the General Assembly. 
*Exercises veto and a Line-item veto power on bills.
*Declares a state of emergency and oversees relief in the event of a disaster.
**Declares public schools and government offices closed during civil or weather emergencies.
*Oversees all state departments.
*Serves as the ex officio chair of the board of trustees of all state universities.
*Submits a budget proposal to the General Assembly every January.
*Delivers a state of the state address, &quot;from time to time,&quot; to the General Assembly; this is usually done in January.
*Appoints United States senators in cases of vacancy to serve until the next election.
*Appoints (or suspends) county sheriffs in cases of vacancy to serve until the next election.
*Removes elected school board officials for &quot;malfeasance, misfeasance, chronic unexcused absenteeism, conflicts of interest, misconduct in office, or persistent neglect of duty in office, or are deemed medically incompetent or medically incapacitated.&quot;

The governor is a member of the State Fiscal Accountability Authority, a state board which also includes the comptroller general, the treasurer, and the chairs of the budget committees in the General Assembly. The board oversees state spending and management of state property.

==Succession==

According to Article IV, Sections 6 and 7 of the South Carolina Constitution, and according to South Carolina law sections 1-3-120, 1-3-130 and 1-9-30, if the incumbent governor is no longer able or permitted to fulfill the duties of the office of governor, the following line of succession will be followed:

If the governor is impeached and removed from office or if the governor is temporarily disabled or absent from office, the lieutenant governor will have the powers of the governor. If the governor-elect is unable to fulfill the duties of the office of the governor, the lieutenant governor will become governor when the incumbent governor&#x27;s term expires. If there is an incumbent governor beginning a new term, but a lieutenant governor-elect, and if the incumbent governor is unable to fulfill the duties of the office of the governor, the incumbent lieutenant governor shall become governor until the inauguration date, and the lieutenant governor-elect shall become governor on that date.

The governor may temporarily transmit his powers and duties down the line of succession in cases of temporary disability. The most recent case of such transmission of power was in 2014 when Lieutenant Governor Yancey McGill, a Democrat, acted as governor while Republican Nikki Haley had surgery.

No governor has ever been impeached, but since the beginning of American Revolution in 1776, ten governors have resigned and four have died in office. Andrew Gordon Magrath, a Confederate Democrat, was forcibly removed from office by the Union Army in 1865 at the end of the Civil War. In 2009, the General Assembly considered impeachment articles against Governor Mark Sanford, but ultimately they did not pass.

==Oath of office==
&quot;I do solemnly swear (or affirm) that I am duly qualified, according to the Constitution of this State, to exercise the duties of the office to which I have been elected, (or appointed), and that I will, to the best of my ability, discharge the duties thereof, and preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of this State and of the United States. So help me God.&quot;

==History==
===Proprietary period===

Governors during the proprietary period (1670–1719) were appointed by Proprieters, and served no fixed term. Governors 1–19 served during this period.

===Royal period===
Governors of the royal period were appointed by the monarch in name but were selected by the British government under the control of the Board of Trade. Governors served as viceroy to the British monarch. The governor could appoint provincial officials or suspend their offices on his own authority, except those offices named above that were also appointed by the crown. Legislative bills required royal assent from the governor and could be rejected; he could prorogue or dissolve the Commons House of Assembly on his own authority. Governors served no fixed term, serving officially at His Majesty&#x27;s pleasure. Governors 20–30 served during this period.

===Articles of Confederation===
From 1776 to 1779, the office of governor was titled President of South Carolina and he was chosen by the General Assembly. Governors served no fixed term. John Rutledge and Rawlins Lowndes were the only two to hold the title of &quot;President.&quot; From 1779 to 1792, governors retained the title of &quot;Governor.&quot; Governors 31–37 served during this period.

===Constitution of 1790===
Governors during this period were chosen by the General Assembly and served a two-year term. Governors were ineligible to serve more than one term consecutively. This system ended after the Civil War when the Union army overthrew and imprisoned Governor Andrew Gordon Magrath; President Andrew Johnson appointed his successor. Governors 37–72 served during this period.

===Post Civil-War===
James Lawrence Orr was the first governor to be popularly elected. 
Following the state&#x27;s failure to adopt the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution, the US Congress eliminated all offices of state government. A temporary military government headed by Edward Canby was set up until new elections were held after the writing of the Constitution of 1868. All male citizens above the age of 21, regardless of race, were given the right to vote and the governor was allowed to be elected to two consecutive terms.

The election of Ben Tillman in 1890 to governor by the support of agrarian reformers forced a new constitutional convention to be held. The constitution of 1895 instituted a poll tax and also required voters to pass a literacy test. These provisions were used to effectively deny the vote to blacks. The convention also increased the governor&#x27;s powers by granting a line-item veto on the budget. Initially, the United States Supreme Court upheld the validity of legislation requiring voters to pay a poll tax, and ruled that literacy tests were not necessarily unconstitutional. In 1964, the Twenty-Fourth Amendment to the United States Constitution made it unlawful for a state to require payment of a poll tax in order to vote in a federal election, and the Supreme Court, reversing the &quot;Breedlove&quot; decision, then held that requiring the payment of a poll tax in any election was a violation of the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. Elimination of the literacy test required federal legislation, the validity of which was upheld by the Supreme Court.

Beginning in 1926 and ending in 1978, governors were elected to one four-year term, which could not be renewed for reelection consecutively. Since 1980, governors have been elected to a four-year term, which can be renewed for reelection once consecutively. Governors 72–117 have served during this period.

==Official residence==
The Governor&#x27;s Mansion, located at 800 Richland Street in Columbia, on Arsenal Hill, is the official residence of the governor of South Carolina. It was built in 1855 and originally served as faculty quarters for The Arsenal Academy which together with the Citadel Academy in Charleston formed The South Carolina Military Academy (now The Citadel); The Arsenal was burned by Sherman&#x27;s forces in February 1865 and never reopened; the faculty quarters building was the only structure to survive and became the official residence of the governor in 1868. The South Carolina Constitution in Section 20 of Article IV requires that the governor is to reside where the General Assembly convenes.

<doc id="253090" wikidata="Q2626318" url="?curid=253090" title="Governor of South Dakota">
<text>The governor of South Dakota is the head of government of South Dakota. The governor is elected to a four-year term in even years when there is no presidential election. 

The current governor is Larry Rhoden, a member of the Republican Party who took office on January 25, 2025 upon Kristi Noem&#x27;s resignation following her confirmation as Secretary of Homeland Security by the United States Senate.

==Qualifications==
Anyone who seeks to be elected Governor of South Dakota must meet the following qualifications:
*Be a citizen of the United States
*Be at least 21 years old
*Be a resident of South Dakota for at least two years as of the election

==Powers and duties==
The governor holds many powers and duties, which in many ways are similar to those held by the president of the United States: 
*The governor serves as a spokesperson for the state, promoting business and economic development interests.
*The governor is actively involved in the legislative process; they may introduce legislation, and have the power to veto bills passed by the South Dakota Legislature (though vetoes may be overridden by a two-thirds vote of each house).
*The governor oversees the executive branch, and appoints the cabinet members. The governor also appoints the members of a wide array of state boards and commissions.
*The governor is the commander-in-chief of the South Dakota National Guard.
*The governor may grant pardons to those convicted of criminal offenses under state law.
*The governor fills vacancies that occur in the state legislature, the state judiciary, and other state constitutional offices. The governor also fills vacancies in United States Senate seats from South Dakota.
*The governor is the titular head of their political party.

==History==
From 1889 to 1974, the governor served a 2-year term. Until the 1940s, the governor was allowed to serve unlimited terms; since that time, governors have been limited to 2 consecutive terms. The gubernatorial term was extended to 4 years in 1974. The governor and lieutenant governor run on a single ticket. The gubernatorial nominee must win a primary, whereas the lieutenant governor nominee is selected at a state party convention. After the convention, they run on a single ticket.

South Dakota’s first governor was Arthur C. Mellette, who was also the last governor of the Dakota Territory.

3 of South Dakota&#x27;s governors have left office before their terms expired. In 1978, Richard F. Kneip resigned from office 6 months before the expiration of his term to accept an appointment as United States ambassador to Singapore. On April 19, 1993, George S. Mickelson was killed in a plane crash near Dubuque, Iowa; Mickelson is the only South Dakota governor to die in office. Mickelson and his father, George Theodore Mickelson, are the only father-son duo to serve as governor. On January 25, 2025, Kristi Noem resigned to become the United States Secretary of Homeland Security in the Cabinet of President Donald Trump.

South Dakota&#x27;s longest-serving governor was Bill Janklow; he was the first governor to complete two four-year terms, and he did it twice, serving from 1979 to 1987 and again from 1995 to 2003. Janklow is also the only person to serve non-consecutive terms as governor.

Several governors have gone on to serve in other high offices. Coe I. Crawford, Peter Norbeck, William H. McMaster, William J. Bulow, Harlan J. Bushfield, and Mike Rounds followed their tenures as governor by serving in the United States Senate. Bill Janklow served briefly in the United States House of Representatives following his second stint as governor. Kristi Noem was South Dakota&#x27;s first female governor.

Of the 50 states, South Dakota currently holds the longest non-interrupted party control of the governorship. The Republican Party has controlled the South Dakota governorship since January 1, 1979.

<doc id="253092" wikidata="Q3773745" url="?curid=253092" title="Governor of Vermont">
<text>The governor of Vermont is the head of government of the U.S. state of Vermont. The officeholder is elected in even-numbered years by direct voting for a term of two years. Vermont and bordering New Hampshire are the only states to hold gubernatorial elections every two years, instead of every four as in the other 48 U.S. states.

There is no limit on the number of terms a Vermont governor can serve. If no candidate receives at least 50% plus one vote of all votes for governor cast in the election, the governor of Vermont is then elected by the state legislature. The incumbent Vermont governor is Republican Phil Scott. He was sworn in on January 5, 2017, becoming Vermont&#x27;s 82nd governor.

==Function==

The governor&#x27;s working offices are located in The Pavilion in the state capital of Montpelier, Vermont. The Governor&#x27;s ceremonial office, used during the legislative session of the General Assembly, is located in the Vermont State House, also in Montpelier.

The Constitution of Vermont details the powers of the governor:
*To commission or appoint all officers (&quot;except where provision is, or shall be, otherwise made by law or this Frame of Government&quot;)
*To fill all vacancies in office until the office can be filled in the manner directed by state constitution or by state law
*To correspond with other States
*To &quot;transact business with officers of government, civil and military&quot;
*To &quot;prepare such business as may appear necessary, to lay before the General Assembly.
*To grant pardons and remit fines, except for cases of treason, in which the governor may only grant reprieves until the end of the next session of the General Assembly, and for cases of impeachment, in which the governor cannot grant either reprieves or pardons
*To &quot;take care that the laws be faithfully executed&quot; and &quot;expedite the execution of such measures as may be resolved upon by the General Assembly&quot;
*To &quot;draw upon the Treasury for such sums as may be appropriated by the General Assembly&quot;
*To &quot;lay embargoes, or prohibit the exportation of any commodity&quot; for up to 30 days during a recess of the General Assembly
*To &quot;grant such licenses as shall be directed by law&quot;
*To call special sessions of the General Assembly when necessary
*To be the &quot;Captain-General and Commander-in-Chief&quot; of the &quot;forces of the State&quot; (the Vermont State Guard and Vermont National Guard), although the governor cannot &quot;command in person, in time of war, or insurrection, unless by the advice and consent of the Senate, and no longer than they shall approve thereof&quot;

The lieutenant governor of Vermont is elected separately from the governor. If the incumbent governor dies, resigns or is removed from office via impeachment, then the lieutenant governor becomes governor. The lieutenant governor is also the lieutenant general &quot;forces of the State&quot;.

Article V, Section 3 of the Virginia Constitution lists the following qualifications for a person to be elected Governor of Virginia:
* Be a citizen of the United States
* Be at least thirty years old 
* Be a resident and a registered voter in the Commonwealth of Virginia for at least five years before the election

Unlike other state governors, Virginia governors are not allowed to serve consecutive terms. They have been barred from immediate re-election since the adoption of Virginia&#x27;s second constitution, in 1830. However, a former governor is permitted to run for a second term in a future election. Only two governors since 1830, William Smith and Mills Godwin, were elected to additional terms. Smith&#x27;s second term came after Virginia seceded from the Union, while Godwin became the first ever governor in American history to be elected by both major parties when the former Democrat was elected in 1973 as a Republican. The only other governors to serve non-consecutive terms in office were Patrick Henry and James Monroe, with George William Smith serving twice as acting governor before becoming official governor.

To get on the ballot for governor of Virginia, each candidate must file 10,000 signatures, including the signatures of at least 400 qualified voters from each of the 11 congressional districts in the Commonwealth.

== Duties ==
The governor is the head of government in Virginia. At the beginning of every regular session, they must report the state of the Commonwealth to the Virginia General Assembly (both the House of Delegates and the Senate). They must convene the legislature when two-thirds of each house calls for a special session. The governor must ensure that the laws of the Commonwealth are faithfully executed by either signing, or allowing it to come into law, or vetoing, not allowing it to become law. They are responsible for the safety of the state, as they serve as commander-in-chief of the Virginia Militia.

== Powers ==

*The governor has the legislative power to submit recommendations and to call special sessions when deemed necessary.
*The governor has veto powers. All bills must be sent to the governor before becoming law. The governor may sign the bill, let it sit unsigned for seven days, after which it becomes law, or veto the legislation. After a veto, the bill returns to its house of origin and may be overridden by two-thirds of the vote in each house.
*The governor also has the power to use a line-item veto. The governor may send legislation back to the legislature with recommendations and amendments. The legislature must either approve the changes by a majority in each house or override the veto with a two-thirds majority in each house.
*The governor is commander-in-chief of Virginia&#x27;s militia forces.
*The governor may also communicate with other states and foreign powers.
*The governor has the power to fill vacancies in positions unless the position is appointed by the legislature.
*The governor may commute fines or sentences and issue pardons. The governor may also restore voting rights and overturn other political penalties on individuals.

==Succession==
Established by Article V, Section 16 of the Constitution of Virginia.

== History ==

===Colony and province===

The position of governor of Virginia dates back to the 1607 first permanent English settlement in America, at Jamestown on the north shore of the James River upstream from Hampton Roads harbor at the mouth of the Chesapeake Bay. The Virginia Company of London set up a government-run by a council. The president of the council served as a governor. The council was based in London and controlled the colony from afar. Nominally, Thomas Smith was the first president of the council, but he never left England. Edward Maria Wingfield was the first president of the council in residence in the new province, making him the first to exercise the actual authority of governing Virginia. The Virginia Company soon abandoned governance by council two years after the landing on May 23, 1609, and replacing it with a governor, John Smith (1580–1631).

In 1624, the English monarchy of King James I (1566–1625, reigned 1603–1625), in the last year of his reign, of the royal House of Stuart took control from the Virginia Company and its stockholders and made Virginia a crown colony. Governors continued to be appointed by the monarch for many years. Most often, the appointed governor would reside in England while a deputy or lieutenant governor exercised authority. The royal rule was interrupted during the English Civil War (1642–1646 / 1648–1649), after which governors were appointed by the Protectorate under Richard Cromwell (successor to Oliver Cromwell) in the interim Commonwealth of England until the English Restoration of the monarchy with King Charles II in 1660.

===Commonwealth===

Virginia became an independent sovereign state and Commonwealth during the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), with Patrick Henry (1736–1799, served 1776–1779 and 1786–1789) as its first governor (and also later sixth). From the Revolution until 1851, the governor was elected by the General Assembly of Virginia (commonwealth/state legislature). After 1851, in a democratic trend spreading across the Union, the state turned to popular elections for office holders.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), Francis Harrison Pierpont was the governor of the Union-controlled parts of the state, later of which emerged the new state in the northwest of West Virginia. Pierpont also served as one of the provisional governors during the post-war Reconstruction era. These governors were appointed by the Federal government of the President and U.S. Congress, both controlled by Radical Republicans for a decade. In 1874, Virginia regained its right to self-governance and elected James L. Kemper (1823–1895), a Democrat and temporary Conservative Party member and former Confederate general as governor. After the Radical Republican appointees of the post-war Reconstruction era, Virginia would not actually elect another regular Republican as governor until A. Linwood Holton Jr. in 1969. However, in 1881 William E. Cameron was elected governor under the banner of the Readjuster Party, a coalition of Republicans and populist Democrats. Douglas Wilder became the first elected and only the second African American Governor of any U.S. state. He served as governor from 1990 to 1994.

Since 1851, Virginia&#x27;s gubernatorial elections have been held in &quot;off-years&quot;—years in which there are no national (presidential, senatorial, or House) elections; Virginia&#x27;s gubernatorial elections are held one year after U.S. presidential elections (2001, 2005, 2009, etc.) (Most states hold gubernatorial elections either on presidential-election years or midterm-election years, when there are congressional elections.) In every Virginia gubernatorial election starting with 1977, the governor elected had been from the opposite party as the president elected by the nation in the previous year, even when Virginia had voted for the president in office, as with Bill Clinton and George W. Bush. The only exception being in 2013 with the election of Democrat Terry McAuliffe, following the re-election of President Barack Obama in 2012.

Tim Kaine was inaugurated on January 14, 2006. Due to renovations on the Capitol in Richmond, his inauguration was held in Williamsburg, making him the first governor to be inaugurated in Williamsburg since Thomas Jefferson in 1779. The current governor of Virginia is Glenn Youngkin who was inaugurated on January 15, 2022.

== Styles ==
The governor of Virginia is addressed as &quot;The Honorable&quot; but may occasionally be referred to as &quot;Excellency&quot; if ceremonially appropriate.

<doc id="253096" wikidata="Q3112727" url="?curid=253096" title="Governor of Wisconsin">
<text>The governor of Wisconsin is the head of government of Wisconsin and the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s army and air forces. The governor has a duty to enforce state laws, and the power to either approve or veto bills passed by the Wisconsin Legislature, to convene the legislature, and to grant pardons, except in cases of treason and impeachment. The position was first filled by Nelson Dewey on June 7, 1848, the year Wisconsin became a state. Prior to statehood, there were four governors of Wisconsin Territory.

The 46th, and current governor is Tony Evers, a Democrat who took office on January 7, 2019.

==Powers==
The governor of Wisconsin has both inherent powers granted by the Wisconsin Constitution and administrative powers granted by laws passed by the Wisconsin State Legislature.

===Constitutional powers===
The constitutional powers of the governor of Wisconsin are outlined in the Wisconsin Constitution at Article V, Section 4. In general, the governor ensures that the laws of Wisconsin are carried out.

====Veto power====
The governor of Wisconsin has the strongest veto power of nearly any American governor. Any bill passed by the Wisconsin State Legislature must be presented to the governor, who either signs it into law, or vetoes it. In the event of a veto, the bill is returned to the legislature, who may then vote to override the veto. In 1930, the Wisconsin Constitution was amended to give the governor line-item veto power, which allows portions of appropriations bills to be struck out without rejecting the entire bill. Governors have the power to strike out words, numbers, and even entire sentences from bills. The partial veto may still be overridden by the legislature.

In 1990 a further amendment specified that the line-item veto does not give the governor power to veto individual letters of appropriations bills, thereby forming new words. Despite this 1990 law, the strength of the governor&#x27;s veto power gave rise to the term &quot;Frankenstein veto&quot; to describe the governor&#x27;s ability to form a new bill that subverts the intent of the legislature. In 2023, Governor Tony Evers used the power to change a portion of the state budget that funded schools until the &quot;2024-2025&quot; school year to &quot;2425,&quot; increasing funding for over 400 years. 

====Other constitutional powers====
The governor is the commander-in-chief of the state&#x27;s militia. If it is deemed necessary, the governor may also convene extraordinary sessions of the state legislature; and may convene them anywhere in the state, if Madison, the state capital, is deemed unfit for the purpose due to invasion or contagious disease.

The governor may pardon, commute, or grant reprieve of sentences, except in cases of treason or impeachment. The governor must notify the Wisconsin State Legislature of these each year, along with the reasons for them. In cases of treason, the governor may suspend the carrying out of the sentence until the next session of the legislature, who then vote to grant a pardon, commutation or reprieve, or to carry out the sentence.

The governor must also &quot;communicate to the legislature, at every session, the condition of the state, and recommend such matters to them for their consideration as he may deem expedient&quot; (these annual communications are referred to as the &quot;state of the state&quot;).

===Administrative and budgetary powers===
The governor of Wisconsin, as head of the executive branch, also has administrative powers (the power to administer agencies created by the Wisconsin legislature). Since 1965, there has been an increase in executive orders to &quot;establish standards and provide uniformity to executive agency operations and programs.&quot; However, since 2011, the Wisconsin Legislature has attempted to limit the authority of administrative agencies.

The governor also appoints heads of agencies created by the legislature. This appointment power is not explicitly granted by the Wisconsin Constitution, as it is in the appointments clause of the federal constitution, with the exception of appointing judicial vacancies. Instead, the governor appoints heads of agencies by statute. The governor of Wisconsin had 307 executive appointments between 2017 and 2018.

State law requires the governor to prepare an executive budget bill. This helps the governor &quot;to pursue a legislative agenda&quot;.

==Elections and term of office==
The governor of Wisconsin is directly elected—the candidate with the most votes becomes governor. If two candidates receive an equal number of votes, which is higher than that received by any other candidate, the members of the state legislature vote between the two at their next session.

Under the original Wisconsin Constitution, governors were elected for a term of two years; in 1967, the constitution was amended to increase the term of office to four years, beginning with the governor elected in the 1970 election. There is no limit to the number of terms a governor may hold. The longest-serving governor was Tommy Thompson, from January 5, 1987, until February 1, 2001, a total of 14 years and 28 days; the shortest-serving was Arthur MacArthur Sr., from March 21, 1856, until March 25 of the same year; a total of 5 days.

Candidates for the office must be citizens of the United States and qualified voters in the state of Wisconsin.

===Removal===
The governor usually leaves office because their term ends and they have not been re-elected. But the governor may also leave office through other means. For example, the governor may resign from office. Four governors have resigned: William Barstow due to fraud allegations, Robert La Follette Sr. to take his seat in the United States Senate, Patrick Joseph Lucey to become Ambassador to Mexico, and Tommy Thompson to become United States Secretary of Health and Human Services. Additionally two governors—Louis Harvey and Walter Samuel Goodland—died while in office, and Orland Loomis, who was elected governor, died before taking office.

The governor can also be removed through an impeachment trial or through a recall election. An impeachment trial is carried out by the Wisconsin State Assembly, if a majority of its members agree to the impeachment. No governors have been removed from office through impeachment in the history of Wisconsin. However, Arthur MacArthur Sr., who, as lieutenant governor, became acting governor upon the resignation of William Barstow in 1856, was removed after the Wisconsin Supreme Court ruled that Barstow&#x27;s opponent in the previous election, Coles Bashford, was the election&#x27;s legitimate winner.

In 2012, Scott Walker became the only governor in Wisconsin history to face a recall election and was the only governor in American history to survive a recall election until Gavin Newsom also survived in the 2021 California gubernatorial recall election. He retained his seat, defeating Milwaukee mayor Tom Barrett by seven percentage points, a margin one point greater than that of the 2010 election, becoming the first governor in American history to survive a recall attempt.

===Election history===

In the 2022 gubernatorial election, over 2.6 million voters cast ballots for governor. This was the highest turnout for a gubernatorial election in state history, surpassing the 2012 recall election by 140,000 votes. There have been 44 governors of Wisconsin and 45 individual governorships. 1 governor, Philip La Follette, served non-consecutive terms. Four parties have had their candidates elected governor: the Democratic, the Whig, the Republican and the Progressive.

==Relationship with the lieutenant governor of Wisconsin==
Originally, the state constitution specified that the governor and lieutenant governor of Wisconsin were voted upon separately, but in 1967, the constitution was amended to state that they were elected together. Prior to this amendment, there were nine incidents in which the elected governor and lieutenant governor were not of the same political party.

Originally, the state constitution only said that in the event of the impeachment, removal from office, death, resignation or absence of the governor, or in the event of the governor being unfit to serve due to illness, &quot;the powers and duties of the office shall devolve upon the lieutenant governor&quot; for the remainder of the term or until the governor is able to return to office. In 1979, the constitution was amended to specify that in the event of the governor&#x27;s death, resignation or removal from office, the lieutenant governor becomes governor for the remainder of the term, but in the event of impeachment, incapacitation or absence, the lieutenant governor merely becomes &quot;acting governor&quot; until the governor can return to his duties. The original constitution also specified that in any of the aforementioned events the secretary of state would become governor if the lieutenant governorship was vacant, but after 1979 this provision, too, was amended to distinguish between &quot;governor&quot; and &quot;acting governor.&quot;

<text>Zurich Airport is the largest international airport of Switzerland and the principal hub of Swiss International Air Lines. It serves Zurich, the largest city in Switzerland, and, with its surface transport links, much of the rest of the country. The airport is located north of central Zurich, in the municipalities of Kloten, Rümlang, Oberglatt, Winkel, and Opfikon, all of which are within the canton of Zurich.

==History==
===Early years===
In the Zurich area, mixed civil and military air traffic developed from 1909 onwards at Dübendorf airfield, northeast of the city. From 1919, the airport was home to Swissair&#x27;s predecessor , and from 1932 also to Swissair. The first regular international flight service began on 1 June 1922 with an Ad Astra route to Fürth, Germany. In the early years of aviation, the Dübendorf Air Base, located around southeast of Zurich Airport, also served as the city&#x27;s commercial airfield. The need for a dedicated commercial facility led to the search for a location to build a replacement airport.

In 1939, civil air traffic had to be suspended at the outbreak of the Second World War for military strategic reasons. Although Swissair was allowed to resume scheduled air traffic in September 1940, this remained on a modest scale during the conflict.

In March 1943, the government of the canton of Zurich commissioned a study to identify possible locations to construct a major airport. In its report, a consortium of engineers and architects led by Locher &amp; Cie advised against the previously discussed expansion options at Dübendorf and instead recommended a separate civil airport in the partially forested moorland area of the armoury situated between Kloten and Oberglatt. In August 1943, the Federal Military Department declared its agreement to abandon the armoury as a matter of principle &quot;in the higher national interest&quot;.

Locher &amp; Cie submitted &quot;Project I&quot; to the Government on 31 December 1943. Four runways were planned and together with the buildings the required area was . Without the purchase of land, the project would have cost CHF 87 million. The government found the costs too high and ordered a revision. The &quot;Project II&quot; of 29 April 1944 still provided for an area of at a cost of CHF 65 million, but the government council demanded a further reduction. For &quot;Project III&quot; of 31 July 1944, CHF 54.4 million and were required. The project nevertheless met the requirements of an intercontinental airport. The Government formally approved it and submitted it to the Federal Government, strongly emphasising that the Zurich project was &quot;far superior&quot; to the also planned (and ultimately abandoned) Swiss Central Airport Utzenstorf, near Bern.

In December 1944, the responsible Federal Councillor, Enrico Celio, explicitly spoke out in favour of Zurich-Kloten, in a letter to his counterparts, as did the governments of the cantons of Eastern and Central Switzerland and Ticino a month later. The National Council and Council of States followed this view and on 22 June 1945 approved the &quot;Federal Decree on the Expansion of Civil Airports&quot;. Basel, Bern and Geneva were to receive smaller continental airports and be supported with a 30 percent share of the costs. The Zurich project was granted the status of an intercontinental airport and the highest possible subsidy rate of 35 percent.

Switzerland&#x27;s federal parliament decided in 1945 that Zürich was to be the site of a major airport, and sold of the Kloten-Bülach Artillery Garrison () to the canton of Zurich, giving the canton control of the new airfield. Construction of the airport began the following year.

Initial plans for the airport, as laid out in the Federal Government&#x27;s scheme of 1945, were centred on facilities capable of handling international airline traffic. Aircraft of up to 80 tonnes were envisaged. The primary runway was to be designed for use in all weather conditions and at night, with a -wide hard surface running to in length. Additional areas were to be provided on the shoulders for lateral protection in case of runway excursions. Additional domestic runways, between in length, were also to be built.

=== First stage of construction: civil engineering ===
On 25 February 1946, the Cantonal Council of Zürich approved a building loan of CHF 36.8 million. The cantonal referendum of 5 May 1946 resulted in a clear approval with 105,705 votes in favour and 29,372 against. &quot;Project IV&quot; never came to fruition, as it was further developed by adapting it to the ICAO standards which were changing rapidly at the time. Instead of four runways, the new &quot;Project V&quot; of 20 May 1946 provided only three. Project VI&quot; of 9 October 1946 increased the dimensions of all three runways. Finally, the slightly modified &quot;Project VII&quot; of 20 December 1947 was realised. Within three years, the design on the drawing board had completely changed from a purely grass airfield with a four-runway system without taxiways to a three-runway system with paved taxiways. The staggered design meant that it was possible to react to changes without having to impose a complete halt to construction.

Construction works finally began on 5 May 1946 with the diversion of the Altbach stream. The long West Runway 10/28 was the first runway which was opened on 14 June 1948, and on which the first Swissair Douglas DC-4 took off for London. On behalf of the canton as airport owner, Cantonal Councillor Jakob Kägi gave a speech to mark the inauguration of the new runway and the start of provisional flight operations. Shortly after, on 17 November 1948, the long blind runway 16/34 (runway with instrument landing system) was opened for operation, which was attended by the seven members of the cantonal government. In the presence of guests from politics and the media as well as representatives of the construction companies and airlines, the new airport was inaugurated, which meant that the relocation of the entire civil flight operations from Dübendorf to Kloten had already been completed and full operation could begin at the new Zurich Airport.

The long Bisen runway 02/20, which belonged to the three-runway system of 1948, was of little importance. Due to the applicable crosswind regulations at that time, the runway was designed to face the Bise to guarantee the airport&#x27;s all-weather capability. However, the ICAO increased the crosswind tolerances for aircraft in subsequent revisions to such an extent that the runway was decommissioned after just over ten years.

=== First stage of construction: structural engineering ===

The character of a provisional solution was supported – despite full operation – by the lack of buildings, especially the &quot;Flughof&quot;, which had been planned since 1946. Instead, a growing shanty town stood to the east of the reserved building site. On 27 October 1948, the canton outsourced the development, construction and operation of the buildings to the newly founded &quot;Flughafen-Immobilien-Gesellschaft&quot; (FIG), a mixed-economy public limited company in which the public sector held half of the shares (canton of Zürich 22.5%, city of Zürich 18%, &quot;Zürcher Kantonalbank&quot; 5%, city of Winterthur 3.6% and municipality of Kloten 0.9%). The FIG took over projects that had been started and was thus able to hand over the completed &quot;shipyard I&quot; to Swissair for use as early as late autumn 1948, followed by offices for Swissair&#x27;s technical departments, which were finally able to leave Dübendorf by the end of April 1949. Further workshops, the striking arched hangar and the &quot;Heating Centre I&quot; for the heat supply were completed by the end of 1949.

Based on &quot;Project V&quot;, the terminal building had already been designed as a convex building at the airport head in mid-1946. In the following four years, a total of 24 feasible airport project designs were submitted, before the FIG commissioned the construction of the airport according to plans by Alfred and Heinrich Oeschger in November 1950. At the beginning of 1951, the piling work for the terminal building began, the construction work took about two years. With the opening on 9 April 1953, the shanty town could be abandoned. The new building consisted of a central passenger wing, flanked by a restaurant and an office wing. In addition there was a spectator terrace of length.

===The first years of operation===
As had been expected the construction costs had been significantly exceeded. Several metres of raised bog were removed and backfilled with material from the Holberg; the concrete area had also increased from the originally planned 420,000 m2 to a good 611,000 m2. In addition, the former weapons range area had to be searched for unexploded bombs, of which a total of 157 were found. The costs for &quot;Project IV&quot;, estimated at CHF 59.5 million in 1946, had risen to CHF 106 million by the time the civil engineering works under &quot;Project VII&quot; were completed in July 1949. Both chambers of the Federal Assembly concluded the political review with the &quot;Federal Decree on the Payment of Additional Federal Contributions to the Construction of Zürich-Kloten Airport&quot; of 29 September 1949. The Federation contributed CHF 27.1 million and doubled its contribution to the air traffic control facilities. For its part, the Cantonal Council granted a supplementary credit on 13 February 1950. This was accepted by the voters on 7 May 1950 with 73,551 votes to 59,088 (yes share of 55.45%).

The new terminal opened in 1953 with a large air show that ran for three days. In 1947, the airport handled 133,638 passengers on 12,766 airline flights; in 1952, 372,832 passengers on 24,728 airline flights.

===Second stage of construction===
Locher &amp; Cie was commissioned in 1954 to design various project options for the second construction phase. In March 1956, the canton submitted an extended project to the Federal Council. In addition to mandatory runway extensions for the incipient &quot;jet age&quot;, the project also provided for the extension of the public facilities, which were already overused and dominated by various provisional arrangements; two finger docks were to defuse the situation. On 12 October 1956, the Federal Council recommended that Parliament approve the bill. On 19 December 1956, the Council of States approved the federal contribution of CHF 54.8 million (at a total cost of 181.8 million), and the National Council followed suit on 7 March 1957. The contribution of the canton of Zürich of CHF 74.3 million was still outstanding, the rest was to be raised by FIG and Swissair. The concrete expansion project included the extension of the blind runway to and the western runway to , as well as the extension of the buildings. Opponents described the &quot;super airport Kloten&quot; as a &quot;luxury&quot; and criticised that the canton had &quot;lost every measure&quot;. Another issue that planners had completely neglected until then was the aircraft noise. With a high turnout of 72.3%, the expansion project failed in the cantonal referendum of 23 June 1957 with 97,603 votes to 83,196 (no vote of 54.0%).

Just four days later, Zürich&#x27;s cantonal government commissioned a redimensioned expansion project. The blind runway was to be only long, the western runway 2500 m; the construction of the finger docks was abandoned. Thus the canton&#x27;s share of the project to be approved was only CHF 49.1 million. The government paid far more attention to the aircraft noise. On 6 July 1958, voters approved the project by 107,050 votes to 56,872 (yes share 65.3%), with a 65.6% share. Due to time pressure - the landing of the first jet aircraft was planned for the following year - construction work began without waiting for approval of federal funding. In December 1958 and March 1959 respectively, the National Council and the Council of States granted subsidies of 55.6 million. In 1959, BOAC started regular flight connections to Zurich with the revised &quot;Comet IV&quot;, while the airport was still a construction site.

The first buildings were completed in 1960, and the terminal building, which had been considered an attractive design, lost its symmetrical appearance. To the east, towards the former shanty town, office wing A1, office wing B and the air traffic control building were added with a connecting structure. The &quot;Fracht West&quot; building, which had been extended at short notice during construction to provide additional office space, was located somewhat off the main building. In the hangar area in the southwest, Heating Station II was put into operation and the Hangar II, which was designed for jet aircraft, was handed over to Swissair, shortly after the arrival of the Sud Aviation &quot;Caravelle III&quot; and the Douglas DC-8-32 in May 1960. Finally, in the summer of 1961, Swissair&#x27;s in-flight catering service was given a new building between the head of the airport and the hangar area.

The canton of Zürich acquired a further of land for the expansion of the civil engineering works, which lasted until the beginning of 1961 in parallel with the construction of the buildings. The apron areas were enlarged, particularly at the airport head and in the hangar area; the pier was also extended from 16 to 28 aircraft parking spaces, and buses were purchased to provide access to them. The west runway 10/28 was extended by to the west, towards Rümlang, and opened on 1 January 1961 with its new operating length of . Blind runway 16/34 was extended to the south in the direction of Opfikon and to the north in the direction of Oberglatt. At its new operating length of , it was released on 15 March 1961. By the time work was completed, the paved area at the airport covered .

===Extension of the Terminal Building===
Although virtually all the buildings of the second phase had been completed by the end of 1961, the extension of the terminal building was still at the design stage. After the passenger terminal with two finger docks had failed in the cantonal referendum, the FIG had worked out a new project until 1958. This envisaged a two-storey transverse hall on the landside of the airport, on the two main floors of which arriving and departing passengers were functionally separated. For cost reasons, the federal government demanded considerable redimensioning, which led to an open dispute about the preferred design. When the conflict, described by the media as a &quot;war of experts&quot;, threatened to escalate, President Willy Spühler invited representatives of the Federation and the cantons to a conference on 9 December 1963.

During the conference, FIG&#x27;s airport planners and the canton of Zürich prevailed against the federal government. The canton only had to make concessions for the commercial parts of the project, such as the restaurant wing. The dispatch of the Federal Council, submitted on 1 March 1965, requested a federal contribution of 23.1 million to the total costs of 129.4 million. Of this, 2.1 million was earmarked for the connection of the airport to the national road network and the preparation of a connection to the planned (but never built) Zürich underground railway. The National Council and Council of States adopted the bill in October 1965, allowing construction work to begin the following year. The motorway loop was in operation from 1968. Finally, with the opening of the last new hall wing on 1 April 1971, the extension of the terminal building was completed.

The first signs of noise mitigation for the airport were in 1972, when a night-time curfew was enacted, as well as in 1974 when new approach routes were introduced. Runway 14/32 was opened in 1976, and 16/34 began renovation.

===Attacks on El Al aircraft===
On 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) attacked El Al flight 432, firing Kalashnikov assault rifles at the Boeing 707-120B whilst it prepared for takeoff. The Shin Bet employee Mordechai Rachamim fired back with his pistol and killed the terrorist Abdel Mohsen Hassan. The three remaining assassins were each sentenced to twelve years in prison. The aircraft&#x27;s co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.

The attack marked the beginning of a discussion about airport security that had never been raised until then in Switzerland. On 21 February 1970, a parcel bomb exploded in Swissair&#x27;s Convair CV-990 on the flight SR330 (Zurich–Tel Aviv). In the crash near Würenlingen all 47 people on board were killed. Investigations revealed that a PFLP terrorist group had carried out the bomb attack. The actual target, however, had been an El Al flight from Munich to Tel Aviv, whose mail had been sent with Swissair to Zurich due to long delays. In 1970, the PFLP obtained the release of the three terrorists convicted in Switzerland and other comrades-in-arms imprisoned abroad through coordinated hijackings. Flights affected were SR 100 (Zurich–New York), TWA flight TW741, Pan Am flight PA93 and BOAC flight BA775.

===Third stage of construction===
In January 1969, the Zürich&#x27;s Cantonal Council approved a loan for preparatory work for the third stage of expansion. The project that was subsequently drawn up exceeded the previous dimensions. The plans included the extension of the existing runways, a long runway, additional taxiways, the enlargement of the pier to 47 stands, a new terminal with finger dock, two multi-storey car parks, additional technical buildings, an airport railway station and a new hangar. In addition, there were various extensions and conversions of existing buildings. The costs were estimated at CHF 777.6 million (not including the air traffic control building and railway station). Since this project was hardly different from the &quot;super airport&quot; rejected in 1957, criticism was immediately voiced again by the &quot;Protection Association of the Population around Zurich Airport&quot; (SBFZ) and the community of Höri, which was located directly in the approach corridor. The SBFZ even demanded the resumption of the central airport concept that was dropped in 1945 – instead of Utzenstorf this time in the &quot;Grosse Moos&quot;, with two runways jutting into Lake Neuchâtel.

The supporters of the Zurich airport expansion argued primarily for the economic benefit. To take the wind out of the sails of aircraft noise criticism, the government and cantonal council are drafting an aircraft noise law (including a ban on night flights), which should be submitted to a referendum at the same time as the expansion bill. After the Cantonal Council had approved both bills in July 1970, the referendum was held on 27 September 1970. The proposal for expansion was approved by 103,867 votes to 64,192 (61.8% yes), and the Aircraft Noise Act by 134,501 votes to 32,590 (80.5% yes). The following year, the Federal Assembly approved a federal contribution of 240.3 million. Construction work on the third stage also began in 1971. In 1973, Hangar III, Cargo Hall East, Car Park F and the General Aviation Centre were completed. In 1974 the &quot;Werkhof&quot; (work yard), an office building and multistorey car park E were added, in 1975 the apron, multi-storey car park B and Terminal B with finger dock, and in 1976 the Airport Plaza shopping and service centre located in multi-storey car park B.

Additional costs were incurred due to numerous adjustments to the construction project. The additional credit of 25.8 million was accepted by Zurich voters on 7 December 1975 with 178,723 to 87,303 votes (67.2% yes). The canton supplemented this credit with ordinary and extraordinary budget credits from the building department. In March 1976 the Federal Assembly approved an additional federal contribution of 39.7 million. As the centrepiece of the third stage, runway 14/32 was opened on 1 April 1976, increasing capacity by a third. In the early days, the new runway served exclusively for landing traffic. The rail link, which had been approved by parliament in 1975 in a separate federal decree, was still outstanding. As this was a project of the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB), the cost allocation differed greatly. Of the total costs of 285 million, the SBB contributed 60%, the Federation 33% and the canton of Zürich 7%. The project comprised the Zürich Flughafen railway station under Terminal B (on which construction had been underway since 1971) and a new line between Bassersdorf and Glattbrugg. After nine years of construction, the ceremonial opening of the airport line took place on 29 May 1980.

===Fourth stage of construction===
In the second half of the 1970s, the volume of traffic continued to rise sharply, so the canton of Zürich, the FIG and Swissair worked out a project for the fourth construction phase. On 28 September 1980, with 142,240 to 104,775 votes (57.6%), Zürich voters accepted a loan of CHF 48 million for civil engineering works, which were part of the forthcoming construction work.Also in 1980, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation published a new airport concept, which replaced that of 1945. The focus was now on qualitative expansion, taking into account spatial planning and environmental protection considerations.
Based on this concept, the Federal Assembly approved the &quot;Building Programme 1981–1985&quot;. This programme provided for investments of CHF 393.3 million in Zürich-Kloten, but the subsidy contribution of 10.3% was significantly lower than for the Geneva and Basel-Mulhouse airports. This was justified by the catch-up demand of the two other major Swiss airports.
The central element of the fourth stage was the finger dock in Terminal A with 13 docking positions. Also planned were a new control tower, a baggage sorting system, an additional multi-storey car park, waiting rooms and an operations centre for aircraft crews. Later, Zürich&#x27;s cantonal government also decided to renew the damaged western runway, which had to be closed for two and a half months in the summer of 1985 for this purpose. Fingerdock A was put into operation on 1 November 1985, and the new 41 m high control tower on 29 April 1986.
There were also plans to expand the airport&#x27;s cargo facilities. However, a corresponding loan of CHF 57 million was narrowly rejected in the referendum of 6 September 1987 by 106,722 to 98,663 votes (52.0% against).
The project, which was subsequently revised and approved by Zürich&#x27;s Cantonal Council in 1989, focused on more efficient use of the existing facilities, thereby enabling the handling of an additional 100,000 tonnes of freight annually.

===Fifth stage of construction (&quot;Airport 2000&quot;)===

The cantonal popular initiative &quot;for moderate air traffic&quot; submitted in January 1991 intended to limit the airport to its then status, i.e. neither to allow more aircraft movements nor to expand the infrastructure. In the vote of 26 September 1993, however, it did not stand a chance and was rejected by 235,531 votes to 112,476 (67.6%).
Nine months later, Zürich&#x27;s cantonal government submitted a proposal for a loan of CHF 873 million to the cantonal council. The fifth construction phase, known as &quot;Airport 2000&quot; and costing a total of CHF 2.4 billion, was intended to replace outdated systems and further expand existing facilities. At the heart of the project was the construction of a third terminal, Dock E &quot;Midfield&quot;, located between the three runways. The Skymetro aerial tramway, a road tunnel and underground baggage conveyors were necessary for its development. Also part of the fifth stage was the construction of the new passenger hub &quot;Airside Center&quot;. The Cantonal Council approved the project at the end of February 1995.
It cleared the last hurdle in the referendum of 25 June 1995, when it was approved by 224,668 votes to 105,859 (68.0% Yes).
After almost nine years of construction, the project was completed in 2004.

===&quot;Zürich 2010&quot; project===
The next major event for the airport was in 1999 when the Parliament of the canton of Zürich approved the privatization of Zurich Airport. The following year, Flughafen Zürich AG, trading under the brand &quot;Unique&quot;, became the new airport operator. The company dropped the brand &quot;Unique&quot; in favour of &quot;Zurich Airport&quot; and &quot;Flughafen Zürich&quot; in 2010.

On 2 October 2001, a major cash-flow crisis at Swissair, exacerbated by the global downturn in air travel caused by the September 11 attacks, caused the airline to ground all its flights. Although a government rescue plan permitted some flights to restart a few days later, and the airline&#x27;s assets were subsequently sold to become Swiss International Air Lines, the airport lost a large volume of traffic. After Lufthansa took control of Swiss International Air Lines in 2005, traffic began to grow again.

On 18 October 2001, Germany and Switzerland signed a treaty regarding the limitation of flights over Germany. Under the terms of this treaty, any incoming aircraft after 22:00 had to approach Zurich from the east to land on runway 28, which, unlike the airport&#x27;s other runways, was not equipped with an instrument landing system. A month later, at 22:06 on 24 November, an inbound Crossair Avro RJ100 using this approach in conditions of poor visibility crashed into a range of hills near Bassersdorf and exploded, killing 24 of the 33 people on board. The flight had originally been scheduled to land on runway 14 before 22:00, but it was subject to delay and was therefore diverted to runway 28.

Zurich Airport completed a major expansion project in 2003, in which it built a new parking garage, a new midfield terminal, and an automated underground people mover to link the midfield terminal to the main terminal. In November 2008 a complete renovation and rebuild of the old terminal B structure was announced. The new terminal B opened in November 2011 and provides segregated access to and from aircraft for Schengen and non-Schengen passengers. Zurich Airport handled 25.5 million passengers in 2014, up 2.5 percent from 2013.

Etihad Regional ceased on 18 February 2015 to fly two-thirds of its scheduled routes without further notice, amongst them all its services from Zurich except the domestic service to Geneva. Etihad Regional blamed the failure of its expansion on the behavior of competitors, especially Swiss International Air Lines, as well as the Swiss aviation authorities.

Following the demolition of some office buildings, the construction of the new baggage sorting facilities between the Operations Center and Terminal 1 began in spring 2018 with a total investment of CHF 500 million.

As of 2020, the marketing of all advertising space at the airport was transferred from Clear Channel to APG.

Terminal A has reached the end of its life cycle and will be completely rebuilt – including the tower of the Skyguide Air Traffic Control. The project was originally put on hold due to the COVID-19 pandemic, but was restarted in 2023 with construction to begin in 2030. The earliest expected completion is 2033. The replacement will be built largely of sustainable wood and be used for photovoltaics, thus making a major contribution to the airport&#x27;s CO2 reduction strategy.

==Corporate affairs==
The airport is owned by Flughafen Zürich AG, a company quoted on the SIX Swiss Exchange. Major shareholders include the canton of Zürich, with 33.33% plus one of the shares, and the city of Zürich, with 5% of the shares. No other shareholder has a holding exceeding 3%. Flughafen Zürich AG used the brand name &quot;Unique&quot; from 2000 until 2010.

The company has stakes in various other airports around the world.

==Infrastructure==

===Terminal complex===
The airport has three airside piers, which are known as terminals &quot;A, B&quot;, and &quot;E&quot; (also signposted as &quot;Gates A, B/D&quot;, and &quot;E&quot;). These are linked to a central air-side building called &quot;Airside Centre&quot;, built-in 2003. Alongside the &quot;Airside Centre&quot;, the ground-side terminal complex named &quot;Airport Centre&quot; comprises several buildings, and includes airline check-in areas, a shopping mall, a railway station, car parks, and a bus and tram terminal. All departing passengers access the same departure level of the &quot;Airside Centre&quot;, which includes duty-free shopping and various bars and restaurants, via airport security. They are then segregated between passengers for Schengen and non-Schengen destinations on the way to the gate lounges, with the latter first passing through emigration controls. Arriving Schengen and non-Schengen passengers are handled in separate areas of the &quot;Airside Centre&quot; and reach it by different routes, with non-Schengen passengers first passing through immigration controls. The three airside terminals are:

==== Terminal A ====
Terminal A contains gates prefixed A. It opened in 1971, and it is used exclusively by flights to and from destinations inside the Schengen Area, including Switzerland domestic flight to Geneva. Since its expansion in 1982–1985, it takes the form of a finger pier, directly connected at one end to the &quot;Airside Centre&quot;.

Terminal A was scheduled to be torn down and replaced by an entirely new facility from 2021. However, in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic the start of the project has been postponed for at least three years.

==== Terminal B ====
Terminal B contains gates prefixed B and D. It opened in 1975 and reopened in November 2011 after an extensive three-year reconstruction. Like terminal A, it takes the form of a finger pier directly connected at one end to the &quot;Airside Centre&quot;. Since reconstruction, it can accommodate both Schengen and non-Schengen flights at the same gates. Each gate has two numbers, one prefixed B and the other D, but with different passenger routes to and from the gates to separate the flows of Schengen and non-Schengen passengers.

==== Terminal E ====
Terminal E contains gates prefixed E and is also known as the midfield terminal or Dock E. It is a stand-alone satellite terminal located on the opposite side of runway 10/28 from the &quot;Airside Centre&quot;, and is situated between runways 16/34 and 14/32. It is entirely used by non-Schengen international flights and became operational on 1 September 2003. It is connected to the &quot;Airside Centre&quot; by the Skymetro, an automated underground people mover.

===Runways===
Zurich Airport has three runways: 16/34 of in length, 14/32 of in length, and 10/28 of in length. For most of the day and in most conditions, runway 14 is used for landings and runways 16 and 28 are used for takeoffs, although different patterns are used early morning and in the evenings. Zurich voters approved the extension of two runways at Zurich Airport on March 3, 2024. The extension of runway 28 by to the west and runway 32 by to the north is expected to increase safety and reduce noise pollution. The project is supported by the government of Zurich and the majority of political parties.

===Train===
Zürich Flughafen railway station is located underneath the &quot;Airport Centre&quot;. The station has frequent Zürich S-Bahn services, plus direct InterRegio, InterCity, and Eurocity services, to many places including Basel, Bern, Biel/Bienne, Brig, Geneva, Konstanz, Lausanne, Lucerne, Munich, Romanshorn, St. Gallen, and Winterthur. There are some 13 trains per hour to Zürich HB (Hauptbahnhof), Zürich&#x27;s main city centre station, with a journey time of between 9 and 13 minutes. By changing trains there, virtually all other places in Switzerland can be reached in a few hours.

===Bus and tram===
In front of the &quot;Airport Centre&quot; is the airport stop of the Stadtbahn Glattal, a light rail system that interworks with the Zürich tram system, together with a regional bus station. Both the bus station and light rail stop provide service to destinations throughout the Glattal region that surrounds the airport, with the light rail stop being served by tram routes 10 and 12. Tram route 10 also provides a link to Zürich Hauptbahnhof, albeit with a rather longer journey time than that of the railway.

===Road===
The airport is served by the A51 motorway and other main roads, which link to the airport&#x27;s road network. Drop-off areas are available by the &quot;Airport Centre&quot; whilst a total of over 14000 spaces are available in six car parks for short and long-term parking. A car hire centre is located in the terminal complex. The airport is served by a fleet of dedicated airport taxis, which operate from taxi ranks in front of the arrival areas. Alternative chauffeur driven airport limousines can be arranged.
The airport can legally be reached by bicycle on a regional highway (Flughafenstrasse and Birchstrasse) that branches off National Highway 4 (Schaffhausen - Bülach - Zurich - Luzern) just east of the airport and reaches northwestern Zurich.

==Other facilities==
===The Circle===

The Circle, a complex intended to include a medical center, a conference center, shops, restaurants, offices, and hotels, is under construction opposite the &quot;Airport Centre&quot;. In February 2009, Flughafen Zürich AG (FZAG) launched a three-stage architectural competition for &quot;The Circle at Zurich Airport&quot; development. Around of usable space for services was to be built close to the terminals on a site. Two hotels and the congress area will occupy around , which will be operated by the Hyatt Corporation. At the end of October 2011, FZAG submitted the building application to the town of Kloten, which granted the building permit on 6 March 2012. The groundbreaking ceremony for the superstructure, scheduled for the end of 2013, was postponed until the beginning of 2015. The Circle&quot; is expected to create around 5,000 new jobs, with an investment volume of around CHF 1 billion. The foundation stone was laid on 24 March 2017 and the opening is expected to take place in the first half of 2020; however, even then not all six parts of the building will be ready. In the meantime, it has been announced that the opening will take place in September 2020.

===Company headquarters===
Several companies have their headquarters on or about the airport. These include Swiss International Air Lines, Swiss World Cargo, Swiss AviationTraining, Edelweiss Air, gategroup, Helvetic Airways, Swissôtel, and Rega. Swissair and Crossair were formerly based at the airport.

==Safety and environment==
===Airport fire department===
The airport fire brigade is responsible for fire-fighting at Zurich Airport and is on standby around the clock. In the event of an emergency, the brigade must be able to reach any location on the airport grounds, an area of 880 hectares, in no more than three minutes by international standards. Their vehicles have extremely powerful engines and large-capacity tanks.

The fire service also includes an operations control centre. This not only coordinates the airport&#x27;s rescue services but also alerts the fire brigades in the northern part of the canton. A total of 77 fire brigades are deployed from the Operations Control Centre, including 2 professional and 13 base fire brigades. Likewise, the rescue service Schutz und Rettung Zürich Nord, the rescue service Spital Bülach, the rescue service Winterthur and since April 1, 2008, the rescue service of the canton of Schaffhausen are also dispatched. Other tasks of the Operations Control Centre include alerting a large animal rescue service, a personal emergency call and location system and the coordination of the emergency medical service for several municipalities.

Until 31 December 2007, the airport fire brigade was officially called the &quot;Berufsfeuerwehr Flughafen Zürich&quot; (Professional Fire Brigade), and it was constituted as the company fire brigade of Flughafen Zürich AG. On 1 January 2008, the airport fire brigade, together with the rescue service and the operations control centre, was for organizational reasons transferred to the &quot;Schutz und Rettung&quot; (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zürich.

===Refuelling dispenser, Ramp Safety, Airport Authority and Follow Me===
Vehicles that not only cross taxiways and runways reserved for aircraft on the designated roads but also use them for business purposes, must be equipped with a transponder and radio and can thus be tracked on tracking websites (e.g. Flightradar24). The transponder sign or radio name for the Follow-Me vehicles is Zebra.

In 2014, five companies were licensed for aircraft refuelling at the airport, operating 16 tankers and 28 dispensers.

===Rescue service Zurich Airport===
The rescue service at Zurich Airport was established around 1982 as the original &quot;fire-fighting ambulance&quot;. Its primary purpose was to protect fire-fighting personnel during fire-fighting operations, and secondarily to provide medical care for injured passengers. It was quickly recognised that there was also a steadily growing need for rescue services for the population outside the airport, and often neighbouring hospitals that were able to provide this service could not cope due to capacity bottlenecks, or the corresponding structures were not available in the Zürcher Unterland at the time. When the airport was privatised in 2000 to form the public limited company Unique (Flughafen Zürich AG), the rescue service was then separated from the fire service as a separate division within the Safety&amp;Security department.

In the last year of its existence in 2007, the Rescue Service at Zurich Airport carried out around 5800 missions with 36 paramedics and three trainees. The majority of the operations were carried out in the region around the airport, which at that time comprised 28 contractual communities. There were three ambulances on standby during the day and two ambulances at night, which were carried out in two shifts of twelve hours each. The teams were on duty four times a day (twice a day and twice at night). As a novelty, Zurich Airport Emergency Medical Services consistently applied the amended labor law, i.e. it was one of the few employers to fully credit the working time of twelve hours without deductions (&quot;attendance time&quot;/effective working time).

There was no permanently installed emergency medical system at the airport site. The paramedics are equipped with extended skills that allow the administration of medication according to algorithms. As part of quality control of the measures carried out, all operations were checked by the medical director. At the same time, an annual review of medication and algorithmic knowledge took place. Only after passing the written and practical test was the paramedic authorised to administer medication for another year. If an emergency physician was needed, the resources of the partner organisations REGA (helicopters) or the NEF of &quot;Schutz und Rettung Zürich&quot; could be called upon.

Project SUS After two project studies, Unique (Flughafen Zürich AG) decided in the summer of 2007 to outsource the rescue service together with the operations centre and the professional fire brigade and to sell it to the &quot;Schutz und Rettung&quot; (Protection and Rescue) department of the city of Zürich for an amount of CHF 22 million. This was also due to the needs of the city of Zürich, as its professional fire brigade in particular had problems meeting the required arrival times with long journeys to the north of the city of Zürich. At the same time, it was possible to avoid the cost-intensive construction of a new base for rescue services and fire brigades in the rapidly growing north. A comprehensive contract was drawn up for the takeover of the entire department, which will be reassessed after ten years. The outsourcing resulted in massive internal restructuring, which replaced the previous organisational form. Since January 1, 2008, the base at the airport has been known as the &quot;Wache Nord&quot;. With a strong positive operating result in 2007 and a reduced staffing level as of January 1, 2008, the catchment area of the rescue service expanded to include the northern districts of Zürich Schwamendingen, Seebach and Oerlikon.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On November 24, 1951, a Douglas DC-4 of the Israeli El Al (aircraft registration 4X-ADN) on a cargo flight from Rome with textiles on board crashed into a forest three kilometers northeast of Zurich Airport shortly before landing. Six of the seven crew members were killed.
* On 24 November 1956, an Ilyushin Il-12B of the Czechoslovak airline ČSA (OK-DBP) crashed into an agricultural area 13 kilometres after take-off from Zürich-Kloten airport, only 500 metres from the southern outskirts of Wasterkingen, probably due to engine problems. All 23 passengers and crew members died there.
* On 4 September 1963, Swissair Flight 306 experienced an in-flight fire shortly after take-off and crashed, killing all 80 people on board.
* On 18 February 1969, four armed members of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine attacked El Al flight 432 whilst it prepared for takeoff. The aircraft&#x27;s security guard repelled the attack, resulting in the death of one of the terrorists, whilst the Boeing 720&#x27;s co-pilot subsequently died of his injuries.
* On 21 February 1970, a barometrically triggered bomb exploded on Swissair Flight 330 some nine minutes after takeoff from Zurich en route to Tel Aviv and Hong Kong. All 47 occupants were killed. The bombing was attributed to the PFLP-GC.
* On 18 January 1971, an inbound Balkan Bulgarian Airlines Il-18D approached Zurich Airport in fog below the glideslope. It crashed and burst into flames, north of the airport, when both the left wingtip and landing gear contacted the ground. Seven crew members and 38 passengers were killed.
* On 24 November 1990, an Alitalia Douglas DC-9 operating Flight 404 crashed on approach to Zurich, killing all 46 passengers and crew on board.
* On 10 January 2000, a Crossair Saab 340 operating Flight 498 crashed shortly after takeoff, killing all 10 occupants. The cause of the crash was determined to have been the result of spatial disorientation and pilot errors.
* On 24 November 2001, a Crossair Avro RJ100 operating Flight 3597 crashed into hills near Bassersdorf while on approach to Zurich. Twenty-four of the 33 people on board were killed.
* On 15 March 2011, two Swiss A320s received almost simultaneous take-off clearance on the intersecting runways 16 and 28. In response to this serious incident, the Federal Office of Civil Aviation commissioned a comprehensive analysis of the operating procedures.

<doc id="253108" wikidata="Q117278" url="?curid=253108" title="Sakura Wars">
<text>is a Japanese steampunk media franchise created by Oji Hiroi and owned by Sega. It is focused around a series of cross-genre video games. The first game in the series was released in 1996, with five sequels and numerous spin-off titles being released since then. The series—set during a fictionalized version of the Taishō period—depicts groups of women with magical abilities using steam-powered mecha to combat demonic threats.

The original &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; was an ambitious title for the then-in-production Sega Saturn. The first game&#x27;s overlap of the tactical role-playing, dating sim and visual novel genres prompted Sega to classify it as a &quot;dramatic adventure&quot;, a moniker which has endured during the series&#x27; lifetime. Both Red Entertainment and Sega co-developed most of the games until 2008, when the series went on hiatus. Sega rebooted the series as sole developer because of fan demand. Recurring elements include anime cutscenes created by notable studios including Production I.G, and music by composer Kohei Tanaka.

The series has sold over 5.8 million copies as of 2022, and garnered both critical and popular acclaim. The original Sega console games have been voted among the most popular for the Saturn and Dreamcast. The &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; franchise includes numerous anime productions, manga, and other media projects such as stage shows. With the exception of &quot;So Long, My Love&quot; and &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot;, the video game series has not been released in English. Several of the anime series have been localized for English territories.

==Games==
The first installment was released on September 27, 1996. Many &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; games have been localized for markets in North America, Europe, Asia, and Australia on numerous video game consoles, personal computers (PC), and mobile phones. As of December 2019, the series includes the main installments from the 1996 &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; to the 2019 &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, as well as direct sequels and spin-offs, both released and confirmed as being in development. Most of the older games have been remade or re-released on multiple platforms.

===Main series===

The original &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; was released in 1996 for the Sega Saturn. It was ported to a number of platforms including Dreamcast, Microsoft Windows and mobile devices. A remake for the PlayStation 2 (PS2), &quot;Sakura Wars: In Hot Blood&quot;, was released in 2003. The remake includes additional voice acting, redone graphics and battle system based on later entries. Its sequel &quot;Sakura Wars 2: Thou Shalt Not Die&quot; was released for the Saturn in 1998. It was the last title developed for the platform, receiving ports to Dreamcast and Windows, and as a bundle with the first game to the PlayStation Portable (PSP).

The next entry, &quot;Sakura Wars 3: Is Paris Burning?&quot;, was released in 2001 for the Dreamcast. It was later ported to Windows, and then to the PS2 with Dreamcast-exclusive features redesigned to work on the PS2. &quot;Sakura Wars 4: Fall in Love, Maidens&quot; was released in 2002 for the Dreamcast. It was the last &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; game produced for Sega hardware, and was later ported to Windows.

The fifth game, &quot;Sakura Wars V: Farewell, My Lovely&quot;, was first released for the PS2 in Japan in 2005. It was the first mainline &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; game to be produced after Sega abandoned game console production. In North America, Europe, and Australia, the game was localized as &quot;Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love&quot; and published by NIS America for the PS2 and the Wii in 2010; this release removed the number from the title. The sixth entry is a soft reboot of the series, titled &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot; (&quot;Sakura Wars&quot; in the west). The game carries over multiple elements while featuring a new cast and action-based combat system. It was released for the PlayStation 4 (PS4) in 2019 in Asia, and 2020 worldwide.

===Spin-offs===
In addition to the main series, numerous spin-off games covering multiple genres were released. The first spin-off title was &quot;Hanagumi Taisen Columns&quot;, released for the Saturn in 1997. A sequel for the Dreamcast was released in 2000. A spin-off set just after &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; for the Game Boy Color, &quot;Sakura Wars GB&quot;, was developed by Jupiter and released by Media Factory in 2000. A direct sequel was released the following year. A small peripheral titled &quot;Pocket Sakura&quot; was also developed by Jupiter and released alongside the first Game Boy Color title.

A small group of spin-off titles were developed under the umbrella title &quot;Sakura Wars World Project&quot;. &quot;Sakura Wars Story: Mysterious Paris&quot;, a visual novel adventure set after the events of &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot;, was released in 2004 for the PS2. A prequel to &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;, &quot;Sakura Wars V Episode 0: Samurai Daughter of the Wild&quot;, was also released for the PS2 that year. The gameplay deviated from the main series in featuring hack and slash action. A Nintendo DS dungeon crawler spin-off, &quot;Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars — Because You Were There&quot;, was developed by Neverland and released in 2008, featuring the casts of all mainline games up to that point.

Other releases included fan discs, supplementary materials related to &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and its first sequel, and &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;-themed pachinko machines. Multiple mobile titles based on the series were also released, beginning in 2001 with &quot;Sakura Wars: Keitai Club&quot;. &quot;Sakura Wars Online&quot; for the Dreamcast was released in 2001 with two character packs, one themed after the Tokyo Flower Division and one after the Paris Flower Division. It operated until Sega closed down its servers in 2005.

A mobile game by Sega and Delight Works, &quot;Sakura Kakumei ~Hana Saku Otome-tachi~&quot; for iOS and Android devices was announced for a 2020 release in September. The game is set in 2011, (Taisho 100) after a great calamity 16 years earlier, a new combat revue known as B.L.A.C.K. has risen to defend the citizen of Japan from new demon hordes and unravel a deep government conspiracy. Anime studio, CloverWorks produced a short anime for streaming to promote the new game.

==Recurring elements==
===Setting and characters===
The &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series is set during a fictionalised version of the Taishō period, with the chronology currently running from 1923 (Taisho 12) to 1940 (Taisho 29). The games are set in the cities of Tokyo, Paris and New York. The setting combines real locations with fantastical events and steampunk-based technology. The central conflict of the series is between demonic forces created by the ingrained darkness in human hearts. To combat this in Tokyo, the Japanese government created a unit of steam-based mecha called Koubu powered by spirit energy. While a few men are capable of using them, women form the main combat units because of their stronger spiritual power. This group is known as the Imperial Assault Force, based in a theater and working undercover as the Imperial Theater Revue. The group to which the protagonists belong is the Flower Division (Hanagumi), the main combat troop. Other groups make cameo appearances in the story if present.

The first four games follow the military and romantic exploits of Imperial Army officer Ichiro Ogami. Originally assigned to the Imperial Assault Force in Tokyo, he later traveled to Paris and trained the newly formed Paris Assault Force before returning to Tokyo and commanding the two united Flower Divisions during the events of &quot;Sakura Wars 4&quot;. For &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;, the lead protagonist was changed to Ogami&#x27;s nephew Shinjiro Taiga, who is sent in place of Ogami to train the New York Combat Revue. The 2019 soft reboot, &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot; takes place in 1940, twelve years after an event called the &quot;Great Demon War&quot; saw the destruction of all three original Flower Divisions. New divisions were created across the world and began competing with each other, with the newly reformed Tokyo Flower Division being the main protagonists.

===Gameplay===
The gameplay of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; incorporate role-playing, dating sim and visual novel elements. This blend of genres and styles resulted in it being labeled as a new genre dubbed &quot;dramatic adventure&quot; in its marketing. The original combination of narrative and tactical role-playing gameplay was inspired by the &quot;Fire Emblem&quot; series. The gameplay is split between adventure-style segments where the player explores environments and interacts with cast members; and battle sections where choices during the adventure segments come into play. With the main female cast, the protagonist can pursue a romance. Romance options can be carried between the first four titles using save data.

Throughout the series, the games have used different battle systems. The first &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and its sequel made use of a traditional turn-based battle system on a tilted two-dimensional grid-based battlefield. Each unit has two actions from a selection of five. The sequel expanded the selection to six, and included cinematic attacks. The leader could also issue commands to the entire squad to take specific battle formations. &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot; introduced the &quot;Active &amp; Realtime Machine System&quot; (ARMS), which takes place in three-dimensional battle arenas. Under this system, units have an allotment of Action Points (AP). AP are used up by moving around the battlefield. Units can perform one of six actions, with two actions per turn as in earlier titles. Each unit has special abilities, and attack ranges based on their weaponry. For the 2019 &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, the battle system was redesigned to use action-based combat, focusing on free movement within large arenas.

Central to all the games and most spin-off titles is the &quot;Live &amp; Interactive Picture System&quot; (LIPS). During conversations with characters and key story sections, the player is faced with critical choices with an imposed time limit. The concept behind LIPS was to maintain player engagement while making narrative rather than freezing time and allowing prolonged time for thought, a trend the staff found annoying. The most basic version was established in the first &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, then later expanded into &quot;Double LIPS&quot; with the incorporation of a personality meter which could indicate a character&#x27;s feelings towards the player. Between &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; and &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;, a version called &quot;Analog LIPS&quot; was used. This allowed players to alter the intensity of a single response. It also included interacting with the character and environments. &quot;So Long, My Love&quot; expanded it further with quick time events using the control sticks and buttons. The 2019 &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; continues this use of the LIPS system, featuring Analog LIPS and new free-roaming elements. Choices made during LIPS sections directly impact character performance in battle.

==History==
===Origins and development===
In 1990, Oji Hiroi at Red Entertainment (formally Red Company) decided to create &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;. Hiroi drew inspiration from Japanese stage shows when creating the project, initially titled . Because of a lack of interest from publishers, Hiroi shelved the project until he was approached by Sega vice president Shoichiro Irimajiri to develop a new project for the Saturn. Successfully pitching his project to Irimajiri, the game began production under the title &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;. While the scenario and gameplay went through multiple redrafts, &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; always made use of a steampunk setting, a female lead and mecha combat. Development lasted three years, double the original estimate, and was Sega&#x27;s most expensive project at the time. Many within both Red Company and Sega were skeptical of the game&#x27;s success, but Hiroi remained confident. Following the critical and commercial success of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, Sega and Red Company expanded the original premise into a franchise, starting with &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot;. A recurring feature from &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot; onwards was the use of subtitles drawn from famous poetry or other types of fiction related to a game&#x27;s location or mood. A recurring poet was Akiko Yosano, whom Hiroi admired.

Following &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot;, the team moved onto the Dreamcast to develop &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot;, rebuilding the game engine and utilising the console&#x27;s functions for gameplay elements. Following the release of &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot;, Sega discontinued the Dreamcast because of declining console sales, transitioning to a software developer and publisher. Rather than move their planned next entry to the PlayStation 2, the team created a final Dreamcast entry as a celebratory title for series fans. This became &quot;Sakura Wars 4&quot;, which was completed in 10 months as opposed to the usual two year development period of other entries. The original story planned for &quot;Sakura Wars 4&quot; was moved for the team&#x27;s next entry on the PlayStation 2.

In 2005, Red Entertainment split from Sega after it bought back its majority share holding, although it continued to be involved in the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series. The next entry, &quot;Sakura Wars V&quot;, formed part of a seven-game group dubbed &quot;Sakura Wars World Project&quot;; the aim was to release these games overseas. In the event, only &quot;Sakura Wars V&quot; was published overseas as &quot;Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love&quot;, and only three of the other planned games were released. The remaining three titles were cancelled in 2008. Sega and Red Entertainment greenlit &quot;Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars&quot; in an attempt to revitalise the franchise using a new gameplay genre. In August 2008, Sega decided to end the franchise, with the final &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;-themed event being a concert that month. Red Entertainment was bought by Chinese company UltaZen in 2011, with Sega retaining the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; property. Fan demand eventually persuaded Sega to greenlight a new title in the series, which would both continue the narrative and feature a new cast.

===Staff===
All titles from 1996 to 2005 were developed by the same central team. These included writer Satoru Akahori, artists Kōsuke Fujishima and Hidenori Matsubara, director and later chief director Tomoyuki Ito, producer and later executive producer Noriyoshi Ohba, and designer Takaharu Terada. Hiroi had contributed to all the projects as a general producer. Red Entertainment co-developed the games with an internal Sega team which shifted identity over the years—originally known as CS2 R&amp;D during development of the first two &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, the team was renamed Overworks in 2000 when Sega consolidated its 9 semi-autonomous subsidiaries into six studios; they worked on the series between &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot; and &quot;Sakura Wars V: Episode 0&quot;. &quot;Sakura Wars: So Long, My Love&quot; was developed by the same team as part of Sega&#x27;s GE2 R&amp;D division, the same team which would develop &quot;Valkyria Chronicles&quot;. &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot; was developed by a team within Sega&#x27;s CS2 R&amp;D division, a newer group including Sonic Team. New team members included character designer Tite Kubo, and writers Jiro Ishii and Takaaki Suzuki, all famous names in anime and video games respectively. Hiroi remained in a supervisory role, and also wrote the theme song lyrics.

Other developers worked on the series alongside Sega and Red Entertainment, including Idea Factory, who created the Wii port of &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;; Jupiter Corporation, producers of the &quot;Sakura Wars GB&quot; duology and the &quot;Pocket Sakura&quot; peripheral; and Neverland, who developed &quot;Dramatic Dungeon: Sakura Wars&quot;. A notable feature of the series is its FMV anime sequences. The first game&#x27;s scenes were animated by Sega&#x27;s animation subsidiary, Kyokuichi Tokyo Movie (now known as TMS Entertainment). From &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot; to &quot;Fall in Love, Maidens&quot;, they were produced by Production I.G. For &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;, the scenes were primarily produced by M.S.C. In &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot;, the anime FMV sequences were produced by Sanzigen.

===Music===
The &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series features a variety of music, and frequently reuses themes. Kohei Tanaka is the chief music composer of the series. Tanaka&#x27;s first major work in the video game industry, it brought him widespread recognition. Tanaka was among the first to support Hiroi with &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, having worked with him during work on an original video animation (OVA) of &quot;Tengai Makyou: Ziria&quot;. Tanaka acted as a teacher figure for the rest of the development team. At that time, rhythm and percussion dominated Japanese popular music rather than melody. Both Tanaka and Hiroi wanted to reintroduce younger Japanese to beautiful melodies. Tanaka has been involved to some degree in most of the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; games, composing the music for all mainline entries, and several spin-off titles. A recurring theme in the series is a piece called &quot;Geki! Teikoku Kagekidan&quot;. Tanaka wrote the theme based on Hiroi&#x27;s request to combine the music of a &quot;Super Sentai&quot; opening theme with the vocal style of the title song for the film &quot;Aoi sanmyaku&quot; (1949). Versions of it were included in &quot;Sakura Wars 2&quot;, &quot;Sakura Wars 4&quot;, and the 2019 soft reboot of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;.

===Localization===
While Hiroi wanted the series to be released worldwide, nearly all games in the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series remain exclusive to Asian territories. Early efforts at localizing the series were not undertaken because of Sega&#x27;s uncertainty over whether the game&#x27;s blend of genres would find a large enough audience outside Japan to be profitable. An unspecified attempt by Sega to localize the game stalled during the concept approval stage. No official reason was ever given. The PSP ports of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot; were scheduled for the North American market, but it were canceled. It was later explained that Sony classified &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; as a text novel, which made then-future licensing for importation and translation difficult.

A Korean translation of &quot;So Long, My Love&quot; was published in South Korea by Sega in 2006. The PC CD-ROM versions of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and its sequel were localized and released in Russia by Akella in 2006 and 2008 respectively. Dysin Interactive published the PC versions of &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; to &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; in China, and &quot;Fall in Love, Maidens&quot; was released in the region by Beijing Entertainment All Technology.

The first official English release in the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series is &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;, which was translated by NIS America in collaboration with Red Entertainment and Idea Factory. The dub was produced at Bang Zoom! Entertainment, and included actors from NIS America&#x27;s localization of the &quot;Disgaea&quot; series. The team also included the Japanese voice track in the PlayStation 2 version, with a dedicated translation which preserved the original character names being created for it. The localization took two years to complete, becoming NIS America&#x27;s largest localization effort to date. For &quot;Shin Sakura Wars&quot;, Sega brought on &quot;Yakuza 0&quot; translators Inbound Games to localise the game. The localised version uses the Japanese audio with subtitles in other languages, and renames the game with the series namesake only.

==Reception and sales==
Between the series&#x27; debut in 1996 and 2010, the series has sold over 4.5 million copies worldwide. Each entry on Sega hardware rank among the best-selling titles for their respective hardware. The original &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; was an immediate success, with several stores being sold out of copies within hours of its release. &quot;Sakura Wars 2&quot; remains the best-selling title in the series, with over 500,000 copies sold on the Saturn alone, making it one of the console&#x27;s best-selling titles in Japan. &quot;So Long, My Love&quot; is the worst-selling mainline entry to date, and was a commercial failure in the West.

Japanese website 4Gamer.net described the series as a &quot;legendary&quot; property connected to Sega, citing several elements such as the anime-style presentation and blend of genres that were hardly seen in gaming at the time. Jenni Lada of TechnologyTell wrote a retrospective on the series in 2009, calling &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; &quot;an odd series [...] that defies genres&quot;. In a 1999 IGN article on the franchise following the announcement of &quot;Sakura Wars 3&quot;, journalist Anoop Gantayat described it as &quot;probably the greatest series of games to never make their way stateside&quot;, citing its unprecedented success when compared to other games on Sega hardware at the time.

The series has been popular with both journalists and fans in Japan since the first game&#x27;s release. At the inaugural CESA Awards, &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; won the Grand Award, as well as awards in the Best Director, Best Main Character and Best Supporting Character categories. &quot;Sakura Wars 2&quot; won the Packaged Work Award at the 1998 Animation Kobe event. The soundtrack album of &quot;Sakura Wars 4&quot; won in the &quot;Animation – Album of the Year&quot; category at the 2003 Japan Gold Disc Awards. Prior to release, &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; was the second most-wanted game in a &quot;Famitsu&quot; poll in 1996, coming in behind &quot;Final Fantasy VII&quot;. The first four games all appeared on a public &quot;Famitsu&quot; poll from 2006 of the 100 best games of all time. A second later poll ranked the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; games as among the best on the Saturn and Dreamcast. &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; heroine Sakura Shinguji was rated in 2009 by &quot;Famitsu&quot; as the 17th best Japanese video game character.

==Related media==

Red Company and Sega have expanded the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; series into various media. These include anime, manga, stage shows, several light novels, concerts and CD album releases of soundtracks. The latter have met with substantial commercial success. Despite a shared identity, Hiroi took care to keep each of these elements distinct and separate from each other. A dedicated themed cafe and merchandise store based in the Ikebukuro district of Tokyo, &quot;Sakura Wars Taisho Romando&quot;, opened in 1998. &quot;Taisho Romando&quot; remained open for ten years until it closed in March 2008.

A prominent feature was an annual stage show dubbed &quot;Sakura Wars Kayou Show&quot; supervised by Hiroi, for which new musical numbers were created by Tanaka. The show featured the cast reprising their roles and performing stage shows drawn from the series. Each character had songs themed after their characters. The cast, which grew to include those of later games, remained for the entire run with the exception of actress Michie Tomizawa who retired from the series and her role as character Sumire Kanzaki in 2002. Tomizawa appeared as a guest in later revival concerts. The original stage shows ran regularly from 1997 to 2006. Since then, it has seen irregular revivals with both the first cast and later additions. The stage shows were originally meant to end in 2008 along with the franchise, but fan support allowed future revivals. A stage adaptation of the 2019 game was planned to run from March 5–8, 2020 at Sogetsu Hall. However, on February 26, 2020, Sega announced that the event would not take place because of the COVID-19 pandemic. The play will now be postponed to winter 2020 with precautions to protect the spread of the virus.

Hiroi wrote a manga adaptation of the first &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, which began serialization in 2002. The original run finished in December 2008, but its popularity led to a second series continuing the narrative. Since 2003, the manga has been published as tankōbon by Kodansha. A comedy manga titled &quot;Sakura Wars: Show Theater&quot;, which featured comedy skits of characters from each main &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; location, was serialised between 2005 and 2009, and published by Kodansha in four volumes between 2006 and 2009. A manga adaptation, &quot;Shin Sakura Taisen: The Comic&quot;, began serialization in 2019 by Shueisha. It was written by Ishii, and illustrated by Koyuri Noguchi.

A spin-off manga &quot;Sakura Wars: Kanadegumi&quot; was created by Chie Shimada, based on concepts from the &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; team, and published in the shojo magazine &quot;Hana to Yume&quot; published by Hakusensha. In contrast to the main series, it was aimed at a female audience and shifted the narrative to a male harem set-up; main protagonist Neko Miyabi is assigned to the titular Kanadagumi, and develops relationships with its five male members. Originally a two-chapter special published between November and December 2011, it was expanded into a full series in February 2012. The manga ran from 2012 to 2013. Between its debut and final issue, the manga inspired both an anime short and a dedicated stage show. It was published in four tankōbon by Hakusensha between September 2012 and July 2013.

===Film and television===
Multiple anime films, television series and original video animations (OVAs) have been produced that are based either on individual &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; games or on the series as a whole. The first was an OVA, titled &quot;Sakura Wars: The Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms&quot;. The OVA was released as four 30-minute episodes from 1997 to 1998, following the cast of the first game. A second OVA series, &quot;The Radiant Gorgeous Blooming Cherry Blossoms&quot;, was released as six 30-minute episodes from 1999 to 2000, relating side stories from between &quot;Sakura Wars&quot; and the end of &quot;Thou Shalt Not Die&quot;. Further OVA series based around the characters of &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; and &quot;So Long, My Love&quot; (&quot;École de Paris&quot;; &quot;Le Nouveau Paris&quot;; &quot;Sumire&quot;; &quot;New York, New York&quot;) were released from 2003 to 2007. The OVAs were produced by Radix Ace Entertainment until &quot;New York, New York&quot; in 2007, when production shifted by Anime International Company.

An anime television series based on the first game was produced by Madhouse. The 25-episode series was broadcast on Tokyo Broadcasting System Television from April 8 to September 23, 2000. While based on the first game&#x27;s narrative and preserving Hiroi&#x27;s vision, the series changed and added in several events. A major problem was remaining faithful to the source material within a TV format. In 2001, an animated theatrical film, &quot;Sakura Wars: The Movie&quot;, was released. The film takes place between &quot;Is Paris Burning?&quot; and &quot;Fall in Love, Maidens&quot; and features new character Ratchet Altair who would later appear in &quot;So Long, My Love&quot;. The film was animated by Production I.G; production took three years and was inspired by the wish to expand the series animation beyond what the short cutscenes and OVA projects had achieved. A second anime television series, titled &quot;Sakura Wars the Animation&quot; and serving as a sequel to the 2019 &quot;Sakura Wars&quot;, premiered on April 3, 2020. It is animated by Sanzigen, which helped create the animated sequences for the game.

In North America, the first two OVA series and the television series were localised by ADV Films. &quot;École de Paris&quot; and &quot;Sumire&quot; were dubbed and released by Funimation, The film was released in North America by Pioneer Entertainment in 2003, and later by Funimation in 2013. Funimation is streaming the 2020 anime for a simulcast release in North America and the United Kingdom.

<text>The Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET) was the first wide-area packet-switched network with distributed control and one of the first computer networks to implement the TCP/IP protocol suite. Both technologies became the technical foundation of the Internet. The ARPANET was established by the Advanced Research Projects Agency (now DARPA) of the United States Department of Defense.

Building on the ideas of J. C. R. Licklider, Bob Taylor initiated the ARPANET project in 1966 to enable resource sharing between remote computers. Taylor appointed Larry Roberts as program manager. Roberts made the key decisions about the request for proposal to build the network. He incorporated Donald Davies&#x27; concepts and designs for packet switching, and sought input from Paul Baran on dynamic routing. In 1969, ARPA awarded the contract to build the Interface Message Processors (IMPs) for the network to Bolt Beranek &amp; Newman (BBN). The design was led by Bob Kahn who developed the first protocol for the network. Roberts engaged Leonard Kleinrock at UCLA to develop mathematical methods for analyzing the packet network technology.

The first computers were connected in 1969 and the Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970, development of which was led by Steve Crocker at UCLA and other graduate students, including Jon Postel and others. The network was declared operational in 1971. Further software development enabled remote login and file transfer, which was used to provide an early form of email. The network expanded rapidly and operational control passed to the Defense Communications Agency in 1975.

Bob Kahn moved to DARPA and, together with Vint Cerf at Stanford University, formulated the Transmission Control Program for internetworking. As this work progressed, a protocol was developed by which multiple separate networks could be joined into a network of networks; this incorporated concepts pioneered in the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. Version 4 of TCP/IP was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983 after the Department of Defense made it standard for all military computer networking.

Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET). In the early 1980s, the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. The ARPANET was formally decommissioned in 1990, after partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry had assured private sector expansion and commercialization of an expanded worldwide network, known as the Internet.

== History ==
=== Inspiration ===
Historically, voice and data communications were based on methods of circuit switching, as exemplified in the traditional telephone network, wherein each telephone call is allocated a dedicated end-to-end electronic connection between the two communicating stations. The connection is established by switching systems that connected multiple intermediate call legs between these systems for the duration of the call.

The traditional model of the circuit-switched telecommunication network was challenged in the early 1960s by Paul Baran at the RAND Corporation, who had been researching systems that could sustain operation during partial destruction, such as by nuclear war. He developed the theoretical model of &quot;distributed adaptive message block switching&quot;. However, the telecommunication establishment rejected the development in favor of existing models. Donald Davies at the United Kingdom&#x27;s National Physical Laboratory (NPL) independently arrived at a similar concept in 1965.

The earliest ideas for a computer network intended to allow general communications among computer users were formulated by computer scientist J. C. R. Licklider of Bolt Beranek and Newman (BBN), in April 1963, in memoranda discussing the concept of the &quot;Intergalactic Computer Network&quot;. Those ideas encompassed many of the features of the contemporary Internet. In October 1963, Licklider was appointed head of the Behavioral Sciences and Command and Control programs at the Defense Department&#x27;s Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA). He convinced Ivan Sutherland and Bob Taylor that this network concept was very important and merited development, although Licklider left ARPA before any contracts were assigned for development.

Sutherland and Taylor continued their interest in creating the network, in part, to allow ARPA-sponsored researchers at various corporate and academic locales to utilize computers provided by ARPA, and, in part, to quickly distribute new software and other computer science results. Taylor had three computer terminals in his office, each connected to separate computers, which ARPA was funding: one for the System Development Corporation (SDC) Q-32 in Santa Monica, one for Project Genie at the University of California, Berkeley, and another for Multics at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Taylor recalls the circumstance: &quot;For each of these three terminals, I had three different sets of user commands. So, if I was talking online with someone at S.D.C., and I wanted to talk to someone I knew at Berkeley, or M.I.T., about this, I had to get up from the S.D.C. terminal, go over and log into the other terminal and get in touch with them. I said, &#x27;Oh Man!&#x27;, it&#x27;s obvious what to do: If you have these three terminals, there ought to be one terminal that goes anywhere you want to go. That idea is the ARPANET&quot;.

Donald Davies&#x27; work caught the attention of ARPANET developers at Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. He gave the first public presentation, having coined the term &quot;packet switching&quot;, in August 1968 and incorporated it into the NPL network in England. The NPL network and ARPANET were the first two networks in the world to implement packet switching. Roberts said the computer networks built in the 1970s were similar &quot;in nearly all respects&quot; to Davies&#x27; original 1965 design.

=== Creation ===
In February 1966, Bob Taylor successfully lobbied ARPA&#x27;s Director Charles M. Herzfeld to fund a network project. Herzfeld redirected funds in the amount of one million dollars from a ballistic missile defense program to Taylor&#x27;s budget. Taylor hired Larry Roberts as a program manager in the ARPA Information Processing Techniques Office in January 1967 to work on the ARPANET. Roberts met Paul Baran in February 1967, but did not discuss networks.

Roberts asked Frank Westervelt to explore the questions of message size and contents for the network, and to write a position paper on the intercomputer communication protocol including “conventions for character and block transmission, error checking and re-transmission, and computer and user identification.&quot; In April 1967, ARPA held a design session on technical standards. The initial standards for identification and authentication of users, transmission of characters, and error checking and retransmission procedures were discussed. Roberts&#x27; proposal was that all mainframe computers would connect to one another directly. The other investigators were reluctant to dedicate these computing resources to network administration. After the design session, Wesley Clark proposed minicomputers should be used as an interface to create a message switching network. Roberts modified the ARPANET plan to incorporate Clark&#x27;s suggestion and named the minicomputers Interface Message Processors (IMPs).

The plan was presented at the inaugural Symposium on Operating Systems Principles in October 1967. Donald Davies&#x27; work on packet switching and the NPL network, presented by a colleague (Roger Scantlebury), and that of Paul Baran, came to the attention of the ARPA investigators at this conference. Roberts applied Davies&#x27; concept of packet switching for the ARPANET, and sought input from Paul Baran on dynamic routing. The NPL network was using line speeds of 768 kbit/s, and the proposed line speed for the ARPANET was upgraded from 2.4 kbit/s to 50 kbit/s.

By mid-1968, Roberts and Barry Wessler wrote a final version of the IMP specification based on a Stanford Research Institute (SRI) report that ARPA commissioned to write detailed specifications describing the ARPANET communications network. Roberts gave a report to Taylor on 3 June, who approved it on 21 June. After approval by ARPA, a Request for Quotation (RFQ) was issued for 140 potential bidders. Most computer science companies regarded the ARPA proposal as outlandish, and only twelve submitted bids to build a network; of the twelve, ARPA regarded only four as top-rank contractors. At year&#x27;s end, ARPA considered only two contractors and awarded the contract to build the network to BBN in January 1969.

The initial, seven-person BBN team were much aided by the technical specificity of their response to the ARPA RFQ, and thus quickly produced the first working system. The &quot;IMP guys&quot; were led by Frank Heart; the theoretical design of the network was led by Bob Kahn; the team included Dave Walden, Severo Ornstein, William Crowther and several others. The BBN-proposed network closely followed Roberts&#x27; ARPA plan: a network composed of small computers, the IMPs (similar to the later concept of routers), that functioned as gateways interconnecting local resources. Routing, flow control, software design and network control were developed by the BBN team. At each site, the IMPs performed store-and-forward packet switching functions and were interconnected with leased lines via telecommunication data sets (modems), with initial data rates of . The host computers were connected to the IMPs via custom serial communication interfaces. The system, including the hardware and the packet switching software, was designed and installed in nine months. The BBN team continued to interact with the NPL team with meetings between them taking place in the U.S. and the U.K.

As with the NPL network, the first-generation IMPs were built by BBN using a rugged computer version of the Honeywell DDP-516 computer, configured with of expandable magnetic-core memory, and a 16-channel Direct Multiplex Control (DMC) direct memory access unit. The DMC established custom interfaces with each of the host computers and modems. In addition to the front-panel lamps, the DDP-516 computer also features a special set of 24 indicator lamps showing the status of the IMP communication channels. Each IMP could support up to four local hosts and could communicate with up to six remote IMPs via early Digital Signal 0 leased telephone lines. The network connected one computer in Utah with three in California. Later, the Department of Defense allowed the universities to join the network for sharing hardware and software resources.

==== Debate about design goals ====

According to Charles Herzfeld, ARPA Director (1965–1967):

The ARPANET used distributed computation and incorporated frequent re-computation of routing tables (automatic routing was technically challenging at the time). These features increased the survivability of the network in the event of significant interruption. Furthermore, the ARPANET was designed to survive subordinate network losses. However, the Internet Society agrees with Herzfeld in a footnote in their online article, &quot;A Brief History of the Internet&quot;:

Paul Baran, the first to put forward a theoretical model for communication using packet switching, conducted the RAND study referenced above. Though the ARPANET did not exactly share Baran&#x27;s project&#x27;s goal, he said his work did contribute to the development of the ARPANET. Minutes taken by Elmer Shapiro of Stanford Research Institute at the ARPANET design meeting of 9–10 October 1967 indicate that a version of Baran&#x27;s routing method (&quot;hot potato&quot;) may be used, consistent with the NPL team&#x27;s proposal at the Symposium on Operating System Principles in Gatlinburg.

Later, in the 1970s, ARPA did emphasize the goal of &quot;command and control&quot;. According to Stephen J. Lukasik, who was deputy director (1967–1970) and Director of DARPA (1970–1975):

=== Implementation ===
The first four nodes were designated as a testbed for developing and debugging the 1822 protocol, which was a major undertaking. While they were connected electronically in 1969, network applications were not possible until the Network Control Protocol was implemented in 1970 enabling the first two host-host protocols, remote login (Telnet) and file transfer (FTP) which were specified and implemented between 1969 and 1973. The network was declared operational in 1971. Network traffic began to grow once email was established at the majority of sites by around 1973.

==== Initial four hosts ====
The initial ARPANET configuration linked UCLA, ARC, UCSB, and the University of Utah School of Computing. The first node was created at UCLA, where Leonard Kleinrock could evaluate network performance and examine his theories on message delay. The locations were selected not only to reduce leased line costs but also because each had specific expertise beneficial for this initial implementation phase:

*University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), where Kleinrock had established a Network Measurement Center (NMC), with an SDS Sigma 7 being the first computer attached to it;
* The Augmentation Research Center at Stanford Research Institute (now SRI International), where Douglas Engelbart had created the new NLS system, an early hypertext system, and would run the Network Information Center (NIC), with the SDS 940 that ran NLS, named &quot;Genie&quot;, being the first host attached;
*University of California, Santa Barbara (UCSB), with the Culler-Fried Interactive Mathematics Center&#x27;s IBM 360/75, running OS/MVT being the machine attached;
* The University of Utah School of Computing, where Ivan Sutherland had moved, running a DEC PDP-10 operating on TENEX.

The first successful host-to-host connection on the ARPANET was made between Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and UCLA, by SRI programmer Bill Duvall and UCLA student programmer Charley Kline, at 10:30 pm PST on 29 October 1969 (6:30 UTC on 30 October 1969). Kline connected from UCLA&#x27;s SDS Sigma 7 Host computer (in Boelter Hall room 3420) to the Stanford Research Institute&#x27;s SDS 940 Host computer. Kline typed the command &quot;login,&quot; but initially the SDS 940 crashed after he typed two characters. About an hour later, after Duvall adjusted parameters on the machine, Kline tried again and successfully logged in. Hence, the first two characters successfully transmitted over the ARPANET were &quot;lo&quot;. The first permanent ARPANET link was established on 21 November 1969, between the IMP at UCLA and the IMP at the Stanford Research Institute. By 5 December 1969, the initial four-node network was established.

Elizabeth Feinler created the first Resource Handbook for ARPANET in 1969 which led to the development of the ARPANET directory. The directory, built by Feinler and a team made it possible to navigate the ARPANET.

==== Network performance ====
In 1968, Roberts contracted with Kleinrock to measure the performance of the network and find areas for improvement. Building on his earlier work on queueing theory and optimization of packet delay in communication networks, Kleinrock specified mathematical models of the performance of packet-switched networks, which underpinned the development of the ARPANET as it expanded rapidly in the early 1970s.

==== Growth and evolution ====
Roberts engaged Howard Frank to consult on the topological design of the network. Frank made recommendations to increase throughput and reduce costs in a scaled-up network. By March 1970, the ARPANET reached the East Coast of the United States, when an IMP at BBN in Cambridge, Massachusetts was connected to the network. Thereafter, the ARPANET grew: 9 IMPs by June 1970 and 13 IMPs by December 1970, then 18 by September 1971 (when the network included 23 university and government hosts); 29 IMPs by August 1972, and 40 by September 1973. By June 1974, there were 46 IMPs, and in July 1975, the network numbered 57 IMPs. By 1981, the number was 213 host computers, with another host connecting approximately every twenty days.

Support for inter-IMP circuits of up to 230.4 kbit/s was added in 1970, although considerations of cost and IMP processing power meant this capability was not actively used.

Larry Roberts saw the ARPANET and NPL projects as complementary and sought in 1970 to connect them via a satellite link. Peter Kirstein&#x27;s research group at University College London (UCL) was subsequently chosen in 1971 in place of NPL for the UK connection. In June 1973, a transatlantic satellite link connected ARPANET to the Norwegian Seismic Array (NORSAR), via the Tanum Earth Station in Sweden, and onward via a terrestrial circuit to a TIP at UCL. UCL provided a gateway for interconnection of the ARPANET with British academic networks, the first international resource sharing network, and carried out some of the earliest experimental research work on internetworking.

1971 saw the start of the use of the non-ruggedized (and therefore significantly lighter) Honeywell 316 as an IMP. It could also be configured as a Terminal Interface Processor (TIP), which provided terminal server support for up to 63 ASCII serial terminals through a multi-line controller in place of one of the hosts. The 316 featured a greater degree of integration than the 516, which made it less expensive and easier to maintain. The 316 was configured with 40 kB of core memory for a TIP. The size of core memory was later increased, to 32 kB for the IMPs, and 56 kB for TIPs, in 1973.

The ARPANET was demonstrated at the International Conference on Computer Communications in October 1972.

In 1975, BBN introduced IMP software running on the Pluribus multi-processor. These appeared in a few sites. In 1981, BBN introduced IMP software running on its own C/30 processor product.

=== Operation ===
ARPA was intended to fund advanced research. The ARPANET was a research project that was communications-oriented, rather than user-oriented in design. Nonetheless, in the summer of 1975, operational control of the ARPANET passed to the Defense Communications Agency. At about this time, the first ARPANET encryption devices were deployed to support classified traffic.

The &quot;ARPANET Completion Report&quot;, written in 1978 and published in 1981 jointly by BBN and DARPA, concludes that:

==== CSNET, expansion ====
Access to the ARPANET was expanded in 1981 when the National Science Foundation (NSF) funded the Computer Science Network (CSNET).

==== Adoption of TCP/IP ====
The transatlantic connectivity with NORSAR and UCL later evolved into the SATNET. The ARPANET, SATNET and PRNET were interconnected in 1977.

The DoD made TCP/IP the standard communication protocol for all military computer networking in 1980. NORSAR and University College London left the ARPANET and began using TCP/IP over SATNET in 1982.

On January 1, 1983, known as flag day, TCP/IP protocols became the standard for the ARPANET, replacing the earlier Network Control Protocol.

==== MILNET, phasing out ====
In September 1984 work was completed on restructuring the ARPANET giving U.S. military sites their own Military Network (MILNET) for unclassified defense department communications. Both networks carried unclassified information and were connected at a small number of controlled gateways which would allow total separation in the event of an emergency. MILNET was part of the Defense Data Network (DDN).

Separating the civil and military networks reduced the 113-node ARPANET by 68 nodes. After MILNET was split away, the ARPANET would continue to be used as an Internet backbone for researchers, but be slowly phased out.

=== Decommissioning ===
In 1985, the NSF funded the establishment of national supercomputing centers at several universities and provided network access and network interconnectivity with the NSFNET project in 1986. NSFNET became the Internet backbone for government agencies and universities.

The ARPANET project was formally decommissioned in 1990. The original IMPs and TIPs were phased out as the ARPANET was shut down after the introduction of the NSFNet, but some IMPs remained in service as late as July 1990.

In the wake of the decommissioning of the ARPANET on 28 February 1990, Vinton Cerf wrote the following lamentation, entitled &quot;Requiem of the ARPANET&quot;:

=== Legacy ===
The technological advancements and practical applications achieved through the ARPANET were instrumental in shaping modern computer networking including the Internet. Development and implementation of the concepts of packet switching, decentralized networks, and communication protocols, notably TCP/IP, laid the foundation for a global network that revolutionized communication, information sharing and collaborative research across the world.

The ARPANET was related to many other research projects, which either influenced the ARPANET design, were ancillary projects, or spun out of the ARPANET.

Senator Al Gore authored the High Performance Computing and Communication Act of 1991, commonly referred to as &quot;The Gore Bill&quot;, after hearing the 1988 concept for a National Research Network submitted to Congress by a group chaired by Leonard Kleinrock. The bill was passed on 9 December 1991 and led to the National Information Infrastructure (NII) which Gore called the &quot;information superhighway&quot;.

The ARPANET project was honored with two IEEE Milestones, both dedicated in 2009.

== Software and protocols ==
=== IMP functionality ===
Because it was never a goal for the ARPANET to support IMPs from vendors other than BBN, the IMP-to-IMP protocol and message format were not standardized. However, the IMPs did nonetheless communicate amongst themselves to perform link-state routing, to do reliable forwarding of messages, and to provide remote monitoring and management functions to ARPANET&#x27;s Network Control Center. Initially, each IMP had a 6-bit identifier and supported up to 4 hosts, which were identified with a 2-bit index. An ARPANET host address, therefore, consisted of both the port index on its IMP and the identifier of the IMP, which was written with either codice_1 notation or as a single byte; for example, the address of MIT-DMG (notable for hosting development of Zork) could be written as either codice_2 or codice_3. An upgrade in early 1976 extended the host and IMP numbering to 8-bit and 16-bit, respectively.

In addition to primary routing and forwarding responsibilities, the IMP ran several background programs, titled TTY, DEBUG, PARAMETER-CHANGE, DISCARD, TRACE, and STATISTICS. These were given host numbers in order to be addressed directly and provided functions independently of any connected host. For example, &quot;TTY&quot; allowed an on-site operator to send ARPANET packets manually via the teletype connected directly to the IMP.

=== 1822 protocol ===
The starting point for host-to-host communication on the ARPANET in 1969 was the 1822 protocol, which defined the transmission of messages to an IMP. The message format was designed to work unambiguously with a broad range of computer architectures. An 1822 message essentially consisted of a message type, a numeric host address, and a data field. To send a data message to another host, the transmitting host formatted a data message containing the destination host&#x27;s address and the data message being sent, and then transmitted the message through the 1822 hardware interface. The IMP then delivered the message to its destination address, either by delivering it to a locally connected host, or by delivering it to another IMP. When the message was ultimately delivered to the destination host, the receiving IMP would transmit a &quot;Ready for Next Message&quot; (RFNM) acknowledgment to the sending, host IMP.

=== Network Control Protocol ===
Unlike modern Internet datagrams, the ARPANET was designed to reliably transmit 1822 messages, and to inform the host computer when it loses a message; the contemporary IP is unreliable, whereas the TCP is reliable. Nonetheless, the 1822 protocol proved inadequate for handling multiple connections among different applications residing in a host computer. This problem was addressed with the Network Control Protocol (NCP), which provided a standard method to establish reliable, flow-controlled, bidirectional communications links among different processes in different host computers. The NCP interface allowed application software to connect across the ARPANET by implementing higher-level communication protocols, an early example of the &quot;protocol layering&quot; concept later incorporated in the OSI model.

NCP was developed under the leadership of Steve Crocker, then a graduate student at UCLA. Crocker created and led the Network Working Group (NWG) which was made up of a collection of graduate students at universities and research laboratories, including Jon Postel and Vint Cerf at UCLA. They were sponsored by ARPA to carry out the development of the ARPANET and the software for the host computers that supported applications.

=== Network applications ===
NCP provided a standard set of network services that could be shared by several applications running on a single host computer. This led to the evolution of &quot;application protocols&quot; that operated, more or less, independently of the underlying network service, and permitted independent advances in the underlying protocols.

The various application protocols such as TELNET for remote time-sharing access and File Transfer Protocol (FTP), the latter used to enable rudimentary electronic mail, were developed and eventually ported to run over the TCP/IP protocol suite. In the 1980s, FTP for email was replaced by the Simple Mail Transfer Protocol and, later, POP and IMAP.

Telnet was developed in 1969 beginning with RFC 15, extended in RFC 855.

The original specification for the File Transfer Protocol was written by Abhay Bhushan and published as on 16 April 1971. By 1973, the File Transfer Protocol (FTP) specification had been defined () and implemented, enabling file transfers over the ARPANET.

In 1971, Ray Tomlinson, of BBN sent the first network e-mail (, ). An ARPA study in 1973, a year after network e-mail was introduced to the ARPANET community, found that three-quarters of the traffic over the ARPANET consisted of email messages. E-mail remained a very large part of the overall ARPANET traffic.

The Network Voice Protocol (NVP) specifications were defined in 1977 (), and implemented. But, because of technical shortcomings, conference calls over the ARPANET never worked well; the contemporary Voice over Internet Protocol (packet voice) was decades away.

=== TCP/IP ===
Stephen J. Lukasik directed DARPA to focus on internetworking research in the early 1970s. Bob Kahn moved from BBN to DARPA in 1972, first as program manager for the ARPANET, under Larry Roberts, then as director of the IPTO when Roberts left to found Telenet. Kahn worked on both satellite packet networks and ground-based radio packet networks, and recognized the value of being able to communicate across both. Steve Crocker, now at DARPA, and the leaders of British and French network projects founded the International Network Working Group in 1972 and, on Crocker&#x27;s recommendation, Vint Cerf, now on the faculty at Stanford University, became its Chair. This group considered how to interconnect packet switching networks with different specifications, that is, internetworking. Research led by Kahn and Cerf resulted in the formulation of the Transmission Control Program, which incorporated concepts from the French CYCLADES project directed by Louis Pouzin. Its specification was written by Cerf with Yogen Dalal and Carl Sunshine at Stanford in December 1974 (). The following year, testing began through concurrent implementations at Stanford, BBN and University College London. At first a monolithic design, the software was redesigned as a modular protocol stack in version 3 in 1978. Version 4 was installed in the ARPANET for production use in January 1983, replacing NCP. The development of the complete Internet protocol suite by 1989, as outlined in and , and partnerships with the telecommunication and computer industry laid the foundation for the adoption of TCP/IP as a comprehensive protocol suite as the core component of the emerging Internet.

=== Password protection ===
The Purdy Polynomial hash algorithm was developed for the ARPANET to protect passwords in 1971 at the request of Larry Roberts, head of ARPA at that time. It computed a polynomial of degree 224 + 17 modulo the 64-bit prime &quot;p&quot; = 264 − 59. The algorithm was later used by Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) to hash passwords in the VMS operating system and is still being used for this purpose.

== Rules and etiquette ==
Because of its government funding, certain forms of traffic were discouraged or prohibited.

Leonard Kleinrock claims to have committed the first illegal act on the Internet, having sent a request for return of his electric razor after a meeting in England in 1973. At the time, use of the ARPANET for personal reasons was unlawful.

In 1978, against the rules of the network, Gary Thuerk of Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) sent out the first mass email to approximately 400 potential clients via the ARPANET. He claims that this resulted in $13 million worth of sales in DEC products, and highlighted the potential of email marketing.

A 1982 handbook on computing at MIT&#x27;s AI Lab stated regarding network etiquette:

== In popular culture ==
* &quot;Computer Networks: The Heralds of Resource Sharing&quot;, a 30-minute documentary film featuring Fernando J. Corbató, J. C. R. Licklider, Lawrence G. Roberts, Robert Kahn, Frank Heart, William R. Sutherland, Richard W. Watson, John R. Pasta, Donald W. Davies, and economist, George W. Mitchell.
* &quot;Scenario&quot;, an episode of the U.S. television sitcom &quot;Benson&quot; (season 6, episode 20—dated February 1985), was the first incidence of a popular TV show directly referencing the Internet or its progenitors. The show includes a scene in which the ARPANET is accessed.
* There is an electronic music artist known as &quot;Arpanet&quot;, Gerald Donald, one of the members of Drexciya. The artist&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Wireless Internet&quot; features commentary on the expansion of the internet via wireless communication, with songs such as &quot;NTT DoCoMo&quot;, dedicated to the mobile communications giant based in Japan.
* Thomas Pynchon mentions the ARPANET in his 2009 novel &quot;Inherent Vice&quot;, which is set in Los Angeles in 1970, and in his 2013 novel &quot;Bleeding Edge&quot;.
* The 1993 television series &quot;The X-Files&quot; featured the ARPANET in a season 5 episode, titled &quot;Unusual Suspects&quot;. John Fitzgerald Byers offers to help Susan Modeski (known as Holly ... &quot;just like the sugar&quot;) by hacking into the ARPANET to obtain sensitive information.
* In the spy-drama television series &quot;The Americans&quot;, a Russian scientist defector offers access to ARPANET to the Russians in a plea to not be repatriated (Season 2 Episode 5 &quot;The Deal&quot;). Episode 7 of Season 2 is named &#x27;ARPANET&#x27; and features Russian infiltration to bug the network.
* In the television series &quot;Person of Interest&quot;, main character Harold Finch hacked the ARPANET in 1980 using a homemade computer during his first efforts to build a prototype of the Machine. This corresponds with the real life virus that occurred in October of that year that temporarily halted ARPANET functions. The ARPANET hack was first discussed in the episode &quot;2PiR&quot; (stylized &quot;2formula_1R&quot;) where a computer science teacher called it the most famous hack in history and one that was never solved. Finch later mentioned it to Person of Interest Caleb Phipps and his role was first indicated when he showed knowledge that it was done by &quot;a kid with a homemade computer&quot; which Phipps, who had researched the hack, had never heard before.
* In the third season of the television series &quot;Halt and Catch Fire&quot;, the character Joe MacMillan explores the potential commercialization of the ARPANET.

=== Oral histories ===
* Focuses on Kahn&#x27;s role in the development of computer networking from 1967 through the early 1980s. Beginning with his work at BBN, Kahn discusses his involvement as the ARPANET proposal was being written and then implemented, and his role in the public demonstration of the ARPANET. The interview continues into Kahn&#x27;s involvement with networking when he moves to IPTO in 1972, where he was responsible for the administrative and technical evolution of the ARPANET, including programs in packet radio, the development of a new network protocol (TCP/IP), and the switch to TCP/IP to connect multiple networks.
* Cerf describes his involvement with the ARPA network, and his relationships with Bolt Beranek and Newman, Robert Kahn, Lawrence Roberts, and the Network Working Group.
* Baran describes his work at RAND, and discusses his interaction with the group at ARPA who were responsible for the later development of the ARPANET.
* Kleinrock discusses his work on the ARPANET.
* Lukasik discusses his tenure at the Advanced Research Projects Agency (ARPA), the development of computer networks and the ARPANET.
* Frank describes his work on the ARPANET, including his interaction with Roberts and the IPT Office.

<doc id="253113" wikidata="Q2418770" url="?curid=253113" title="Fancy Lala">
<text>Fancy Lala, known in Japan as , is a magical girl anime series produced by Studio Pierrot in 1998, following an OVA released in 1988. A two-volume manga adaptation by Rurika Kasuga ran in &quot;Ribon&quot;. The original designs were created by Akemi Takada, who worked on many of the Studio Pierrot series of the 1980s. The anime series was licensed for English release by Bandai Entertainment with a dub produced in Calgary and Edmonton, Alberta, Canada by Blue Water Studios which was owned by Ocean Productions in Vancouver. This was the last magical girl anime Pierrot produced by Pierrot prior to Tokyo Mew Mew in 2002.

One day, Lala is scouted by Yumi Haneishi, the president of the talent agency Lyrical Productions, and begins the long road to stardom.

==Production==
&quot;Fancy Lala&quot; is a complete remake of an earlier Studio Pierrot OVA titled &quot;Harbor Light Story Fashion Lala Yori&quot;. It was also influenced by &quot;Mahō no Tenshi Creamy Mami&quot;, the story of a ten-year-old Japanese girl granted the power to transform who also became an idol.

==&quot;Harbor Light Story Fashion Lala Yori&quot;==
The original OVA was very different than the final series, being a retelling of &quot;Cinderella&quot;. In it, the heroine, Miho, a little girl who dreams of being a fashion designer, lives with her aunt and three cousins while her father is away on business. The aunt, who runs a dress shop, exploits Miho&#x27;s dependence and makes her perform deliveries on her bike, while spoiling her own daughters. Of the three, the two oldest are cruel and mock Miho&#x27;s dreams, but the youngest is nice to her. A local disco is holding a contest to find the next &quot;Disco Queen.&quot; Miho is too young to enter, but decides to design a dress for her cousin. When the aunt finds out, she rips up the dress. After everyone leaves, two fairies take pity on Miho and transform her into &quot;Fashion Lala,&quot; a sixteen-year-old blonde, so she can enter the contest herself. While performing, Miho&#x27;s outfit changes into her previous designs, and it seems that she wins. At the end, she returns to a happy life with her father and her two oldest cousins apologized to Miho for being cruel to her and mocking her dreams for no reason.

The heroine being named Miho and the two fairies, as well as the concept of an &quot;evil cousin&quot;, were the only things retained for the final series.

==Episode list==

==Internationalization==
&quot;Fancy Lala&quot; was licensed by Bandai Entertainment for English release in 2001, and dubbed at Blue Water Studios. The series has been released on DVD, but is only distributed in region 1 outside Japan.

<doc id="253116" wikidata="Q1140138" url="?curid=253116" title="San Francisco Municipal Railway">
<text>The San Francisco Municipal Railway( ; SF Muni or Muni), is the primary public transit system within San Francisco, California. It operates a system of bus routes (including trolleybuses), the Muni Metro light rail system, three historic cable car lines, and two historic streetcar lines. Previously an independent agency, the San Francisco Municipal Railway merged with two other agencies in 1999 to become the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA). In 2018, Muni served with an operating budget of about $1.2 billion. Muni is the seventh highest-ridership transit system in the United States, with rides in , and the second highest in California after the Los Angeles County Metropolitan Transportation Authority.

== Operations ==
Most bus lines are scheduled to operate every five to fifteen minutes during peak hours, every five to twenty minutes middays, about every ten to twenty minutes from 9 pm to midnight, and roughly every half-hour for the late night &quot;owl&quot; routes. On weekends, most Muni bus lines are scheduled to run every ten to twenty minutes. However, complaints of unreliability, especially on less-often-served lines and older (pre-battery backup) trolleybus lines, are a system-wide problem. Muni has had some difficulty meeting a stated goal of 85% voter-demanded on-time service.

All Muni lines run inside San Francisco city limits, with the exception of several lines serving locations in the northern part of neighboring Daly City, and the 76X Marin Headlands Express line to the Marin Headlands area on weekends and major holidays. Most intercity connections are provided by BART and Caltrain heavy rail, AC Transit buses at the Salesforce Transit Center, and Golden Gate Transit and SamTrans downtown.

Bus and cable car stops throughout the city vary from Metro stations with raised platforms in the subway and at the more heavily used surface stops, to small shelters to signposts to simply a yellow stripe on a utility pole or on the road surface. 70% of stops are spaced closer than recommended range of apart.

=== Name and logo ===

The system is popularly known as &quot;Muni&quot;, a shortening of the &quot;Municipal&quot; in &quot;San Francisco Municipal Railway&quot; (and not an acronym). Muni&#x27;s logo is a stylized, trademarked &quot;worm&quot; version of the word &quot;muni&quot;. This logo was designed by San Francisco-based graphic designer Walter Landor in the mid-1970s.

=== Announcements ===
To cater to the large Hispanic and Latino American and Asian American populations in San Francisco, bus announcements are in four languages: English, Spanish, Cantonese and Tagalog.

== Route names ==

Bus and trolleybus lines have number designations, rail lines have letters and the three cable car lines are typically referred to by name only (Powell-Mason, Powell-Hyde and California).

== Fares ==
Except for cable cars, cash fares are $3.00 for adults; $1.50 for seniors over 65, people with disabilities, and Medicare card holders; and free for low- and moderate-income seniors, youth aged 18 and under, and people with disabilities residing in San Francisco. Clipper card and MuniMobile fares are $2.50 for adults and $1.25 for seniors, and people with disabilities. Proof-of-payment, which fare inspectors may demand at any time, is either a Clipper card, MuniMobile, Muni Passport, or paper transfer. One fare entitles a rider to unlimited vehicle transfers for the next 120 minutes. Cable cars are $8 one way, with no transfers, unless the rider has a Muni Passport or a Muni monthly pass. As of July 2019 monthly passes cost $81 for adults ($98 with BART privileges within city limits), $40 for low-income residents (&quot;Life Line Pass&quot;), or $40 for youth, seniors and the disabled. Passes are valid on all Muni lines—including cable cars—and the $98 adult pass allows BART transit entirely within San Francisco (between Embarcadero and Balboa Park). Other passes and stickers are valid on all Muni lines, including cable cars, but not on BART (with the exception of BART-Plus ticket types).

Cable car fare is $8 per trip, with no transfers issued or accepted. &quot;Passports&quot; are folding scratch-off passes that can be purchased by mail, or at various places throughout the city; they are good on all regular-service lines without surcharge, including cable cars. As of September 2018, Passports cost $23 for a 1-day pass, $34 for a 3-day pass, or $45 for a 7-day pass, with discounts for using Clipper card or MuniMobile.

Muni has implemented a dual-mode smart card payment system known as Clipper (formerly TransLink). The transponders have been in use since at least 2004, and replaced most paper monthly passes in 2010. BART, Caltrain, Golden Gate Transit, VTA, AC Transit, SamTrans, SMART and San Francisco Bay Ferry also utilize the Clipper system.

Fares can also be paid with a mobile app called MuniMobile since 2015. The app is developed by moovel, who have built mobile ticketing apps for a number of other transit agencies such as Caltrain and TriMet. The app is planned to be deployed until around 2021 when the next generation Clipper card mobile app is planned to launch and replace agency-specific ticketing apps.

== Special service ==

Muni operates 14 express lines, 5 Rapid lines, and 12 Owl lines, which run between 1 am and 5 am. For San Francisco Giants games, additional &quot;baseball shuttles&quot; supplement N Judah and T Third service to Oracle Park.

Express lines only run during peak hours; during mornings they run towards downtown (the Financial District) and during the evening they run away from downtown. All express lines have an &quot;X&quot;, &quot;AX&quot;, or &quot;BX&quot; following the line&#x27;s number. Some lines are divided into A and B Expresses. The B Express line is shorter and has stops that are closer to downtown, while the A Express makes stops further away from downtown and will make few or no stops in the area where the B Express stops. The 8 Bayshore, as the 8X Bayshore Express, was the only Express route that ran daily until April 25, 2015, the date when it was no longer an Express route.

Rapid lines (having an R following their route number) are limited-stop services. They stop at only a subset of the stops of their corresponding &quot;standard&quot; linetypically every third stop and at transfer points.

=== Cable car system ===

Muni also operates the San Francisco cable car system, a heritage streetcar system descendant of a larger network of manually operated cable cars. The first city-owned line was acquired in 1906, although the current configuration is an amalgamation of several former lines and has operated as such since in 1952. The system was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1964 and placed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1966. There are three cable car lines being the Mason-Powell line, the California State line, and the Powell- Hyde line. Popular areas from the Embarcadero to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf are served by cable cars. In the system, there are 62 allocated stations. The system accrues five million annual riders and has always been a tourist destination as well as a convenient means for travel around the city.

=== Heritage streetcars ===
Additionally, Muni operates two heritage streetcar lines distinct from the Muni Metro: the E Embarcadero and F Market &amp; Wharves, however the former has been suspended since April 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. Formerly run for the Historic Trolley Festival, in the 1980s, regular service of heritage equipment began in 1995. Streetcars do not utilize tunnel segments and the F line utilizes infrastructure optimized for trolleybuses along Market Street (the former routing of all downtown streetcar lines before the formation of Muni Metro).

== Statistics ==
The longest Muni line is the a nighttime-only route that blends several other routes together, while the longest daytime route is the . The shortest route is the peak-hour only at , while the shortest off-peak route is the at . The steepest grade climbed by Muni vehicle is 23.1% by a diesel-electric hybrid bus on the line, 22.8% by a trolleybus on the line and 21% by a cable car on the Powell-Hyde line.

The busiest Muni bus corridor is the Geary corridor. The two major routes that operate on the corridor, the and , travel in the east–west direction along the Geary corridor, and has an average speed of only , taking over 50 minutes to travel from the Richmond District to the Transbay Terminal when operating on schedule. As of 2015, the corridor has a total of 55,270 average daily boardings, making it the second busiest transit corridor west of the Mississippi after the Los Angeles Metro Wilshire transit corridor.

At Powell and Market Streets and California and Market Streets, three types of rail gauges come within a few hundred feet of each other: Bay Area Rapid Transit&#x27;s broad gauge (which is underground in the lower level of the Market Street subway), Muni Metro&#x27;s (also underground in the upper level of the subway), and the San Francisco cable car system&#x27;s narrow gauge (at street level a few hundred feet away to the north of Market Street in both cases). The F Market and Wharves, a heritage streetcar line, which is also standard gauge, is also present here, at street level on Market Street. The rail lines, however, do not physically intersect.

===Fleet===
Muni operates about 1,200 vehicles: 550 diesel-electric hybrid buses, 300 electric trolleybuses, 250 modern light rail vehicles, 50 historic streetcars and 40 cable cars. All vehicles, except for cable cars, are wheelchair accessible.

The electricity to run all of Muni&#x27;s trolleybuses, light rail vehicles, streetcars, and the cable car powerhouse comes from the hydroelectric dam at the Hetch Hetchy Reservoir in Yosemite National Park.

All of Muni&#x27;s current internal combustion buses use diesel-electric hybrid powertrains, fueled with renewable diesel fuel made from bio-feedstock sources, including fats, oils and greases. The combination of hybrid technology and renewable diesel fuel helps reduce fuel consumption and cut vehicle emissions.

=== Performance ===

In November 1999 San Francisco voters passed Proposition E setting standards for performance of having at least an 85% on-time record In July 2012 Muni vehicles were on-time 60% of the time and in August 2012, they were on-time 57% of the time. A report conducted by the San Francisco Municipal Transport Agency in early 2013 noted that Muni was on time only 58% of the time. It delayed its customers a total of 172,195 hours and reduced the city&#x27;s economic activity by US$50 million per year. In 2013 the performance hit an all-time low of 57%, the on-time performance improved to 60% in January 2014, 60% in February 2014, and 60% in March 2014.

== Governance ==

Since the passage of Proposition E in November 1999, Muni has been part of the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency (SFMTA), a semi-independent city agency created by that ballot measure. The agency, into which Muni, the Department of Parking and Traffic, and the Taxicab Commission were merged, is governed by a seven-member Board of Directors appointed by the Mayor and confirmed by the Board of Supervisors. The acting Director of Transportation of the SFMTA since August 15, 2019 has been Thomas Maguire, appointed by the SFMTA Board as the interim replacement for Director of Transportation Edward Reiskin. On April 29, 2019, Director Reiskin announced that he would step down at the end of his contract in August 2019. On November 13, 2019, the agency announced that Jeffrey Tumlin would take over as the new director on December 16, 2019.

The day-to-day operations of Muni are overseen by the Transit division of the SFMTA, which is currently headed by Director of Transit Julie Kirschbaum.

== History ==

=== Early years ===

Muni has its origins in the period following the 1906 San Francisco earthquake. Until then the city had been served by several commercial horsecar, cable car and electric streetcar operators. Many of these had been amalgamated into the United Railroads of San Francisco (URR) company. In 1909, voters approved a municipal rail line down Geary. Three years later in 1912, the city declined to renew the franchise that bestowed cable car operator Geary Street, Park &amp; Ocean Railway the privilege of operating on Geary Street. The route was converted into a municipal electric streetcar line, the first line of Muni. (In 1912, the average speed of the city&#x27;s public transit was approximately 8.5 miles per hour – slightly faster than the average speed of 8.1 in 2007.)

Muni soon started on a large building program. On December 29, 1914, the new Stockton Street Tunnel under Nob Hill opened, allowing streetcars from downtown to go to North Beach. The new line also served the Marina District, the site of the 1915 Panama-Pacific International Exposition.

On February 3, 1918, the Twin Peaks Tunnel opened, making the southwestern quarter of the city available for development. On October 21, 1928, the Sunset Tunnel opened, bringing the N Judah streetcar line to the Sunset District. These improvements plunged Muni into direct competition with the URR on the entire length of Market Street. The two operators each operated their own pair of tracks down that thoroughfare, which came to be known as the &quot;roar of the four&quot;.

=== 1940s: The first trolleybuses ===

In 1941, Muni introduced its first trolleybus line, the R-Howard line. Trolleybuses had been running in San Francisco since 1935 but operated only by the Market Street Railway Company (MSRy), successor to the URR. By 1944, the MSR was in financial difficulties. Thus, at 5 am on September 29, 1944, Muni acquired its commercial competitor. Along with the routes and equipment, Muni adopted its competitor&#x27;s more expensive seven-cent fare. Following national trends, Muni replaced most of its rail lines with trolleybus service in the succeeding decades. A few lines with dedicated rights-of-way (including those serving the Twin Peaks and Sunset tunnels) continued as rail lines running 1940s-era PCC streetcars through the 1970s. These lines became the foundation of the Muni Metro.

During World War II, because male employees had been called to serve in the military, both MSRy and Muni hired female &#x27;motorettes&#x27; and conductors, including poet and author Maya Angelou in 1943.

=== 1970s and 1980s: Construction and reorganization ===
In the 1950s and 1960s, the regional BART system was conceived as a much more extensive system than was eventually built, with plans for express trains through San Francisco and local service within San Francisco. Because it was assumed BART would provide local rail service, investment in Muni infrastructure failed to keep pace with major urban redevelopment projects. For example, BART was intended to provide Richmond district and Western Addition service as part of its Golden Gate Bridge/Marin line. This leaves a legacy of the inadequate 38-Geary bus serving these neighborhoods.

Construction on BART&#x27;s Market Street tunnel started in 1967, with two decks tracks – the upper intended to provide local service. Major cost overruns in the BART project forced the state legislature to rescue the project in 1969: curtailing local service in San Francisco and converting the partially constructed stations into the basis of a new light-rail subway called the Muni Metro to connect the downtown stations to the Twin Peaks Tunnel and continuing along reserved tracks to St. Francis Circle. Construction on the metro began in 1970, but the project suffered from further cuts and design changes throughout the 1970s. The Muni Metro finally opened in February 1980, for one line (N-Judah), with other lines following later in 1980, but the many design compromises and piecemeal planning led to long-term operational challenges and inefficiencies.

In 1970, Muni also suffered a severe diesel bus crisis.

Muni experienced a diesel bus availability crisis in 1981–1982 when most of their diesel buses, 401 GMC and Flxible &quot;New Looks&quot; purchases in 1969, reached the end of their 12-year design life and funds for their replacement were not available. Most of the rest of the fleet were undersized 36-foot AM Generals purchased for neighborhood routes, and their use on heavier lines exacerbated conditions. The trolley bus fleet was in good order and had excess capacity at the time, so Muni improvised a few temporary services with them to help out. One such service was a trolley 14-Limited that used the abandoned trolley overhead on South Van Ness. The diesel 82-Chinatown was replaced with short runs of the 30-Stockton. But the trolleys could only go where their wires went.

Muni adopted some policies to alleviate future service issues due to an aged fleet. They would stagger bus purchases so not as large a portion of the fleet would hit retirement age at once. They would arrange for mid-life rebuilds to keep the buses more serviceable in their final years. And they would work to reduce the role of diesels in the total operation. Three trunk diesel lines were converted to trolley bus service in the next twelve years.

But these efforts have not been as successful as hoped. Out of necessity most of the fleet, 330 standard bus equivalents out of 506, were replaced in just two years in 1985–1986. (Standard bus equivalents factor the 30-foot and 60-foot into their equivalent capacity in 40-foot buses). And seven years passed without any new buses coming on board before Muni started its next full diesel fleet replacement cycle in 1999. This was fourteen years after the previous cycle instead of the twelve years that buses are designed to last. Muni is now aware that they must expect to keep diesel buses past their design life and have also found that funds granted for mid-life rebuilds require that the buses be kept longer still. As the fleet replacement cycle begins again in 2013, Muni has arranged for life-extending rebuilds of 142 buses, by count over 30% of the fleet.

In September 1982, the cable car system was shut down for 21 months for rebuilding, and subsequent massive line reorganizations occurred to provide stronger cross-town services.
In 1983, Muni temporarily ran streetcars down Market Street as part of the San Francisco Historic Trolley Festival, initially conceived of as a substitute attraction for tourists during the one summer when no cable cars would be in operation. The service became so popular that the festival was repeated for several years following. Anticipating the return of permanent streetcar service on Market Street, Muni began rehabilitating tracks in 1987, a process that culminated in the opening of the F line in 1995.

The first modern Muni shelter was installed in front of the War Memorial Opera House in 1987.

=== 1990s: the &quot;Muni Meltdown&quot; ===
The F line was reintroduced in 1995 as a heritage streetcar service. Initially designed as a temporary tourist attraction to make up for the suspension of cable car service for rebuilding, the F has become a permanent fixture. E line service, initially known as the Muni Metro Extension, started in January 1998 initially as a shuttle between Embarcadero station and Caltrain&#x27;s 4th and Townsend station.
In June 1995, the San Francisco County Transportation Authority released &quot;The Four Corridor Plan&quot;, a vision to extend Muni Metro service along four major routes in the city: Bayshore (north-south along Third from the county line to California), Geary (east-west along Geary from 48th to Market/Kearny), North Beach (extending the new north-south Bayshore line along Kearny and Columbus to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf), and Van Ness (north-south along Van Ness from 16th and Mission to Aquatic Park), with a connector downtown to transfer between the Bayshore, Geary, and North Beach corridors. These have since been implemented as a combination of light rail (T Third and Central Subway) and bus rapid transit (Geary and Van Ness) services.

During the late 1990s, with aging equipment and poor management, Muni developed a reputation for poor and erratic service. In 1996 a group called Rescue Muni representing transit riders formed to organize concerns and press for change, advocating for the successful 1999 Proposition E that formed the San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency and set service standards for Muni. In August 1998, San Francisco residents witnessed a protracted malfunction of Muni Metro after switching to an automatic train control implemented by Alcatel Transport Automation, culminating in an event that is now known as the Muni Meltdown.

Automatic control of Muni Metro light rail vehicles began on Saturday, August 22, three years behind schedule and at a cost of $70 million, three times the original estimate. Riders angry over delays confronted one driver during the Monday afternoon commute on August 24; he responded by locking himself in the driver&#x27;s compartment and refused to move the train, halting all service for half an hour. Otherwise, no delays were attributable to the new automatic control system that Monday. However, by August 26, Mayor Willie Brown was threatening to sue Alcatel. Alcatel and Muni instead blamed delays on malfunctioning train cars. In addition, a proof-of-payment fare enforcement system went into effect that week, compounding rider confusion. Finally, riders who had previously been able to secure a seat by riding in the opposite direction (outbound) to Embarcadero station were forced to disembark there because of the E/Muni Metro Extension service that had begun in January; these changes and the delays frustrated many commuters. On Friday, August 28, 67 of the 131 LRVs (55 Boeing and 12 Breda) in the Muni Metro fleet were out of service for the morning commute; Mayor Brown personally rode from Civic Center to Embarcadero in the afternoon to experience the chaos for himself. Muni riders abandoned the underground system for carpools, taxis, buses, and F-Market streetcars after LRVs were delayed and stopped with no communication as to when they would resume service; transit times from 4th and Irving to Powell swelled to 120 minutes.
On August 31, two &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; reporters staged a race: one took the train, and the other walked along Market from Civic Center to Embarcadero. The two reporters tied as both completed their trips in 23 minutes; this was an improvement compared to the previous week, at the height of the Meltdown, when the same trip on Muni Metro could take three times as long. Mayor Brown re-enacted the race as the pedestrian on September 3; this time, Muni Metro service had improved and train passengers completed the trip in just seven minutes. At the request of the &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;, a member of the executive committee for Rescue Muni tracked the length of each ride on her eight-stop daily commute to the Financial District from the Sunset that week. Four of the ten trips took longer than 40 minutes, and the best time was 15 minutes.

By the third week of operation under automatic train control, the Muni Meltdown had passed and service was uneventful, albeit with fewer LRVs than normal and with drivers onboard each train. Muni officials apologized for the rough transition and promised to continue to improve service; privately they called the Meltdown &quot;the biggest fiasco in the railway&#x27;s history.&quot;

In an effort to improve service, Muni began to replace its troublesome fleet of Boeing-Vertol light rail vehicles with newer Italian Breda light rail vehicles in late 1996. The two-decade-old fleet of Flyer trolleybuses were replaced with Electric Transit, Inc. (ETI) trolleybuses in the early 2000s. Likewise, the diesel bus fleet saw an infusion of 45 new NABI buses from AC Transit in 1999.

=== 2000s ===

Construction on a sixth light rail line from Caltrain Depot in Mission Bay to Visitacion Valley and Bayview/Hunters Point was completed in December 2006. The new line, named the T Third Street, consisted of 19 new high-platform stations at street-level.

On October 8, 2007, SFMTA&#x27;s cable car signs were awarded the AdWheel Award as the best in print promotion by the American Public Transportation Association. Nathaniel Ford, executive director of Muni, said that the &quot;marketing group has done an outstanding job making the key boarding areas more attractive and inviting for residents and our guests.&quot;

On November 15, 2007, city officials announced that they were looking into the possibility of adding double-decker buses to the Muni fleet, which would be operating mostly on the 38 Geary and the 14 Mission routes. The test period started on December 12, 2007, and ended on January 8, 2008.

On December 1, 2007, Mayor Gavin Newsom announced that the entire city fleet, including all of Muni buses, are henceforth powered with biodiesel, a combination of 80% petroleum diesel fuel and 20% biofuel, to reduce carbon emissions. Muni&#x27;s current hybrid bus fleet currently runs on biodiesel.

On July 17, 2009, a Muni LRV rear-ended another at West Portal Station. That accident injured 48 people.

On December 5, 2009, the Muni system underwent its most extensive changes in over 30 years, in an attempt by the SFMTA to reduce its budget shortfall. This involved changes to over 60% of its bus and light rail routes, including the elimination of six bus routes. Changes included reduced frequency of service, shortened or altered routes, and earlier termination of service, although a few of the busiest lines, such as the 38 Geary, saw service increases.

=== 2010s ===
The 2010s started with severe cuts to Muni service. On February 26, 2010, the SFMTA board, which oversees Muni operations, voted for Muni to undergo further extensive changes in a further attempt to reduce its budget shortfall. Months after the cuts were enacted, significant portions of the service were restored through additional funding and cutting operational costs. Further improvements were made throughout the decade, amidst changes in both city and agency leadership, with the implementation of the &quot;Muni Forward&quot; project and all-door boarding.

In 2011, Nathaniel Ford, the head executive of the SFMTA, stepped down and Ed Reiskin took his place. After the difficult cuts in 2010, city leaders cited the &quot;Transit Effectiveness Project&quot;, later rebranded as &quot;Muni Forward&quot;, as a priority for improving service on Muni. In April 2015, the SFMTA launched the implementation of Muni Forward. Service changes involve renaming routes designated as &quot;Limited&quot; to &quot;Rapid&quot;, a redesigned system map, and increased levels of service on the busiest bus routes. Infrastructure improvements include the addition of transit signal priority, bus bulbs, and bus-only lanes to more locations, and trackway repairs along the Muni Metro system. The 2010s also included the start of construction on bus rapid transit projects on Van Ness and Geary Streets and the initiation of planning for new subway extensions that would potentially reach the Marina District and Park Merced.

On July 1, 2012, Muni was the first transit agency in North America to implement all-door boarding throughout its system. The practice already existed in the Muni Metro as &quot;Proof-of-Payment&quot; and was expanded to include all bus service.

With the Breda cars approaching 20 years of use, the SFMTA announced an order in 2014 for 175 new Siemens S200 cars for its Muni Metro lines. The first of the new cars was delivered in November 2017 with plans to finish the replacement of the entire fleet by 2027. This train procurement, in addition to replacing cars on existing lines, was made in order to supply the additional service required for the Central Subway and to the Mission Bay neighborhood and Chase Center. Throughout the 2010s, Muni also procured new buses and replaced over 90 percent of its diesel bus fleet and replaced all of its aging trolleybuses, improving performance for its bus fleet.

=== 2020s ===
Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, ridership numbers had dropped 70–90% across the system. Muni Metro services, with an over 90% decline in riders, were replaced by bus bridges on March 30 to streamline sanitation procedures. By April 6, service had been eliminated on all but 17 of the agency&#x27;s then 89 routes with San Francisco Municipal Transportation Agency Director of Transportation Jeffrey Tumlin calling it &quot;the worst Muni service since 1906.&quot; Light rail service resumed briefly in August 2020 with significant route changes, but was discontinued and replaced by buses after just three days of operation (August 22–24) because two overhead wire splices failed in the subway portion of the line within 72 hours and an employee in the system&#x27;s control center tested positive for COVID-19. The splice failures in 2020 meant that passengers could be trapped for an extended period of time in an enclosed light rail car during the pandemic. A similar splice that failed in April 2019 in the Market Street subway between Powell and Civic Center disrupted services system-wide for more than 12 hours, and led Mayor London Breed to seek a replacement for Muni head Ed Reiskin. Metallurgical analysis of the failed splices (including the failed splice from April 2019) showed the materials did not meet their specified tensile strength. Some additional bus routes have started to be restored throughout Fall 2020 and into 2021 to address overcrowding and increasing ridership including new short routes on the 1-California, 5-Fulton, and 14R Mission Rapid. On September 19, 2020, the 30-Stockton was extended to Sports Basement in The Presidio to accommodate longer, 60-foot buses along the entire route. This change resulted in many complaints from Marina District residents who complained about parking removal and low ridership along the extension. On December 19th, 2020, light rail service resumed on the J Church on a surface only route. Light rail service at the T Third Street resumed on January 23, 2021 along with the temporary resumption of the 15-Third Street on a new express route.

N Judah, K/T Ingleside/Third Street, and S Shuttle subway service resumed on May 15, 2021, as did F Market &amp; Wharves historic streetcar service. M Ocean View rail service resumed on August 14, 2021.

Van Ness Bus Rapid Transit service began on April 1, 2022.

== System expansion ==

=== Muni Metro and rail service ===

Several proposals for Muni Metro and rail service expansion for Muni are undergoing planning and construction. In addition, several projects are underway to improve the effectiveness of existing lines, many as a part of the Muni Forward initiative. On February 19, 2016, Muni released a Draft Rail Capacity Study, which outlines proposed system improvements through the year 2050 and beyond. This three-tier proposal consists of enhancements that will improve system efficiency and expand the system; estimated cost is $9–16 billion. The ConnectSF planning project, a cooperation between several city agencies including Muni, identified candidate corridors for future subway and rapid transit corridor expansion. The transit strategy report from the project concluded that two new corridors should be developed: the Geary Boulevard and 19th Avenue corridor and an extension of the Central Subway to Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf.

Service improvements for the L Taraval line are under construction and projected to complete in 2024. Improvements on the J, K, and M lines have also been planned and approved, with some construction beginning in 2024. Future improvements on the N Judah line are also planned, with a long-term goal of running three-car trains on the line.

==== Central Subway ====

An underground expansion for the T line opened on November 19, 2022, after ten years of construction. Full service began on January 7, 2023. Dubbed the Central Subway, the expansion features three new underground stations at Moscone Center, Union Square, and Chinatown and one above-ground station at 4th and Brannan Streets. Construction included tunneling up to Columbus Ave and Washington Square Park, but the T line stopped at Chinatown. This project cost about $1.95 billion.

Muni is also considering a future extension into North Beach and Fisherman&#x27;s Wharf or to the Marina District and The Presidio which may be built in a third phase of the T Third project. Formal planning for the extension began in late 2018 with an Alternatives Study.

=== Buses and streetcars ===

The average speed of Muni vehicles has been slowly declining over the years due to increasing vehicular congestion and is now merely per hour. In response, Muni launched plans to make its transit vehicles move faster through the city. Muni Forward (previously called the Transit Effectiveness Project) was launched in May 2006 to take a comprehensive look at the entire Muni system and to see where service can be improved or streamlined to provide faster and more reliable service. The project was launched in a context in which twenty-five years had passed since the last comprehensive review, and travel patterns had changed, traffic congestion had increased, operating costs had risen and on-time performance had dropped since then. Under the Muni Forward project, service improvements were implemented on many lines such as the 5 Fulton and 14R Mission. Further improvements on lines such as the 28 19th Avenue, 22 Fillmore, 30 Stockton, and others are planned.

For streetcar service, extending the E Embarcadero and the F Market and Wharves into Mission Bay and the Fort Mason Tunnel is possible. Existing F Market &amp; Wharves service is planned to be improved under the Better Market Street project with a new loop at Civic Center.

Additionally, there are plans to expand trolleybus service in several parts of the city. Several extensions to existing trolleybus lines are planned, including 14-Mission service to the Daly City BART station, 6-Haight/Parnassus service to West Portal Station, 33-Ashbury/18th Street service across Potrero Hill to Third Street, 45-Union-Stockton service to the Letterman Digital Arts Center in the Presidio and 24-Divisadero service into the former Hunters Point shipyard. Other expansion plans include electrification of some diesel bus lines, with the most likely lines for conversion being the 9-San Bruno, 10-Townsend and 47-Van Ness. Electrification of the 10-Townsend line would likely be joined by an extension of the line across Potrero Hill to San Francisco General Hospital. Other lines that may be electrified are the 7-Haight-Noriega, 27-Bryant, and 43-Masonic.

<text>MPEG-4 Part 3 or MPEG-4 Audio (formally ISO/IEC 14496-3) is the third part of the ISO/IEC MPEG-4 international standard developed by Moving Picture Experts Group. It specifies audio coding methods. The first version of ISO/IEC 14496-3 was published in 1999.

The MPEG-4 Part 3 consists of a variety of audio coding technologies – from lossy speech coding (HVXC, CELP), general audio coding (AAC, TwinVQ, BSAC), lossless audio compression (MPEG-4 SLS, Audio Lossless Coding, MPEG-4 DST), a Text-To-Speech Interface (TTSI), Structured Audio (using SAOL, SASL, MIDI) and many additional audio synthesis and coding techniques.

MPEG-4 Audio does not target a single application such as real-time telephony or high-quality audio compression. It applies to every application which requires the use of advanced sound compression, synthesis, manipulation, or playback.
MPEG-4 Audio is a new type of audio standard that integrates numerous different types of audio coding: natural sound and synthetic sound, low bitrate delivery and high-quality delivery, speech and music, complex soundtracks and simple ones, traditional content and interactive content.

== Versions ==

== MPEG-4 Audio Object Types ==
MPEG-4 Audio includes a system for handling a diverse group of audio formats in a uniform manner. Each format is assigned a unique Audio Object Type to represent it. Object Type is used to distinguish between different coding methods. It directly determines the MPEG-4 tool subset required to decode a specific object. The MPEG-4 profiles are based on the object types and each profile supports a different list of object types.

==Audio Profiles==

The MPEG-4 Audio standard defines several profiles. These profiles are based on the object types and each profile supports different list of object types. Each profile may also have several levels, which limit some parameters of the tools present in a profile. These parameters usually are the sampling rate and the number of audio channels decoded at the same time.

== Audio storage and transport ==
There is no standard for transport of elementary streams over a channel, because the broad range of MPEG-4 applications have delivery requirements that are too wide to easily characterize with a single solution.

The capabilities of a transport layer and the communication between transport, multiplex, and demultiplex functions are described in the Delivery Multimedia Integration Framework (DMIF) in ISO/IEC 14496-6. A wide variety of delivery mechanisms exist below this interface, e.g., MPEG transport stream, Real-time Transport Protocol (RTP), etc.

Transport in Real-time Transport Protocol is defined in RFC 3016 (RTP Payload Format for MPEG-4 Audio/Visual Streams), RFC 3640 (RTP Payload Format for Transport of MPEG-4 Elementary Streams), RFC 4281 (The Codecs Parameter for &quot;Bucket&quot; Media Types) and RFC 4337 (MIME Type Registration for MPEG-4).

LATM and LOAS were defined for natural audio applications, which do not require sophisticated object-based coding or other functions provided by MPEG-4 Systems.

==Bifurcation in the AAC technical standard==

The Advanced Audio Coding in MPEG-4 Part 3 (MPEG-4 Audio) Subpart 4 was enhanced relative to the previous standard MPEG-2 Part 7 (Advanced Audio Coding), in order to provide better sound quality for a given encoding bitrate.

It is assumed that any Part 3 and Part 7 differences will be ironed out by the ISO standards body in the near future to avoid the possibility of future bitstream incompatibilities. At present there are no known player or codec incompatibilities due to the newness of the standard.

The MPEG-2 Part 7 standard (Advanced Audio Coding) was first published in 1997 and offers three default profiles: Low Complexity profile (LC), Main profile and Scalable Sampling Rate profile (SSR).

The MPEG-4 Part 3 Subpart 4 (General Audio Coding) combined the profiles from MPEG-2 Part 7 with Perceptual Noise Substitution (PNS) and defined them as Audio Object Types (AAC LC, AAC Main, AAC SSR).

==HE-AAC==

High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding is an extension of AAC LC using spectral band replication (SBR), and Parametric Stereo (PS). It is designed to increase coding efficiency at low bitrates by using partial parametric representation of audio.

==AAC-SSR==
AAC Scalable Sample Rate was introduced by Sony to the MPEG-2 Part 7 and MPEG-4 Part 3 standards. It was first published in ISO/IEC 13818-7, Part 7: Advanced Audio Coding (AAC) in 1997. The audio signal is first split into 4 bands using a 4 band polyphase quadrature filter bank. Then these 4 bands are further split using MDCTs with a size &quot;k&quot; of 32 or 256 samples. This is similar to normal AAC LC which uses MDCTs with a size &quot;k&quot; of 128 or 1024 directly on the audio signal.

The advantage of this technique is that short block switching can be done separately for every PQF band. So high frequencies can be encoded using a short block to enhance temporal resolution, low frequencies can be still encoded with high spectral resolution. However, due to aliasing between the 4 PQF bands, coding efficiency around (1,2,3) * fs/8 is worse than with normal MPEG-4 AAC LC.

MPEG-4 AAC-SSR is very similar to ATRAC and ATRAC-3.

=== Why AAC-SSR was introduced ===
The idea behind AAC-SSR was not only the advantage listed above, but also the possibility of reducing the data rate by removing 1, 2 or 3 of the upper PQF bands. A very simple bitstream splitter can remove these bands and thus reduce the bitrate and sample rate.

Example:
* 4 subbands: bitrate = 128 kbit/s, sample rate = 48 kHz, f_lowpass = 20 kHz
* 3 subbands: bitrate ~ 120 kbit/s, sample rate = 48 kHz, f_lowpass = 18 kHz
* 2 subbands: bitrate ~ 100 kbit/s, sample rate = 24 kHz, f_lowpass = 12 kHz
* 1 subband: bitrate ~ 65 kbit/s, sample rate = 12 kHz, f_lowpass = 6 kHz

Note: although possible, the resulting quality is much worse than typical
for this bitrate. So for normal 64 kbit/s AAC LC a bandwidth of 14–16 kHz is
achieved by using intensity stereo and reduced NMRs. This degrades audible quality
less than transmitting 6 kHz bandwidth with perfect quality.

==BSAC==
Bit Sliced Arithmetic Coding is an MPEG-4 standard (ISO/IEC 14496-3 subpart 4) for scalable audio coding. BSAC uses an alternative noiseless coding to AAC, with the rest of the processing being identical to AAC. This support for scalability allows for nearly transparent sound quality at 64 kbit/s and graceful degradation at lower bit rates. BSAC coding is best performed in the range of 40 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s, though it operates in the range of 16 kbit/s to 64 kbit/s. The AAC-BSAC codec is used in Digital Multimedia Broadcasting (DMB) applications.

==Licensing==
In 2002, the MPEG-4 Audio Licensing Committee selected the Via Licensing Corporation as the Licensing Administrator for the MPEG-4 Audio patent pool.

<doc id="253129" wikidata="Q1054283" url="?curid=253129" title="Succession of states">
<text>Succession of states is a concept in international relations regarding a successor state that has become a sovereign state over a territory (and populace) that was previously under the sovereignty of another state. The theory has its roots in 19th-century diplomacy. A successor state often acquires a new international legal personality, which is distinct from a continuing state, also known as a continuator or historical heir, which despite changes to its borders retains the same legal personality and possess all its existing rights and obligations (such as a rump state).

==Partial and universal state succession==
A state succession can be characterized as either being &quot;universal&quot; or &quot;partial&quot;. A universal state succession occurs when one state is completely extinguished and its sovereignty is replaced by that of one or more successor states. A partial state succession occurs when successor state(s) succeed only part of a state&#x27;s land and sovereignty, which continues to exist where succession has not taken place.

An example of a partial state succession is the case of the secession of Bangladesh from Pakistan. There was no challenge to Pakistan&#x27;s claim to continue to exist and to retain its membership of the United Nations: it was a continuator and not a successor. Bangladesh eventually was recognized as a new state: it was a successor and had to apply for UN membership.

An example of a universal state succession is the dissolution of Czechoslovakia. Neither part claimed any continuity: both the Czech Republic and Slovakia were new successor states.

There are cases where a state is completely extinguished or abolished without having any successor states. Cases like this occur when, for example, one state is annexed or conquered by another and ceases to exist even in nominal form (&quot;i.e.&quot;, not even a &quot;government in exile&quot; is established). The most recent case is the German Democratic Republic (East Germany), which was completely abolished after the reunification of Germany. Modern Germany is a continuation of the Federal Republic of Germany and not a successor state of East Germany.

==Rights and obligations==
Consequent upon the acquisition of international legal personality, the difficult matter of succession to treaty rights and obligations arises. Succession may refer to the transfer of rights, obligations, or property from a previously well-established predecessor state to its successor state, and can include overseas assets such as diplomatic missions, foreign-exchange reserves, and museum artifacts; and participation in treaties in force at the date of succession or international organizations. In an attempt to codify the rules of succession of states, the 1978 Vienna Convention entered into force on November 6, 1996.

==Classification of cases==
In their application to the acquisition of independence, distinctions should be drawn between different cases though the line of demarcation is not always clear:

* Bilateral and multilateral treaties necessarily give rise to different considerations.
* There are &quot;real&quot; treaties and &quot;personal&quot; treaties. Real treaties affect the territory itself, such as boundary agreements or the grant of transit rights, which can continue irrespective of the personality of the state. The new state must take over the country in the condition in which it finds it, as the parent state cannot give more than it possesses. Such treaties can be described as &quot;treaties creating purely local obligations.&quot;

==Exceptions to orderly succession==
There are several recent examples where a succession of states, as described above, has not been entirely adhered to. This is mostly a list of the exceptions that have occurred since the creation of the United Nations in 1945. In previous historical periods, the exceptions would be too many to list.

===Afghanistan===

The Taliban state in Afghanistan (the Islamic Emirate of Afghanistan) became the &quot;de facto&quot; government of nearly all the country in the mid-1990s, but the Afghan Northern Alliance was still recognised by many nations and retained the UN seat. In 2021, the Taliban again took power, but it does not have the Afghanistan UN seat, which is still held by representatives appointed by the former government.

===China===

The People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) was established in 1949 in mainland China and claimed succession from the Republic of China (ROC). The ROC&#x27;s territory was reduced to mainly the island of Taiwan, who took control from Japan in 1945, although it continues to claim control of the mainland. At the start of the Cold War the PRC was recognized by few states; the ROC continued to represent &quot;China&quot; in the United Nations and hold the permanent seat on the UN Security Council. In 1971, the PRC replaced the ROC in the UN through General Assembly Resolution 2758; this followed a trend of greater recognition for the PRC at the expense of the ROC. Although the resolution makes no mention of Taiwan, the ROC continues to be unrepresented within the United Nations but exercises sovereignty over the Taiwan Area. In addition to the Chinese mainland, the ROC also claims borderlands unclaimed by the PRC, most notably Outer Mongolia.

In Chinese history, periods of prolonged political division and dynastic transition saw the existence of more than one claimant to &quot;China&quot; at the same time. China was politically divided during several sustained periods historically, with two or more states simultaneously existing on territories associated with &quot;China&quot; and claiming to represent &quot;China&quot;. Examples include the Three Kingdoms, Sixteen Kingdoms, Northern and Southern dynasties, Five Dynasties and Ten Kingdoms periods, Warlord Era and the Chinese Soviet Republic among others. Just as the PRC and the ROC formally claim exclusive mandate over the entirety of China, historical Chinese dynasties that existed during periods of sustained political disunity often claimed exclusive Chinese politico-cultural orthodoxy at the expense of others.

During dynastic transitions, it was rare for one dynasty to end abruptly and transition smoothly to a new one, resulting in the existence of more than one entity claiming to be &quot;China&quot;. For instance, during the Ming–Qing transition, the Ming dynasty existed alongside the Qing dynasty (or Predynastic Qing) for a period before 1644. The predecessor of the Qing dynasty, the Later Jin dynasty, was established in 1616 and ruled over Northeast China whilst the Ming dynasty ruled over China proper. Following the fall of the Ming dynasty in 1644, remnants of the Ming imperial family, whose regime is known in historiography as the Southern Ming dynasty, continued to rule parts of southern China until 1662. Multiple ephemeral regimes also existed during this period, including the Shun and Xi dynasties on mainland China, and the Ming loyalist Kingdom of Tungning on Taiwan.

===Republic of Ireland===

Ireland, then called the Irish Free State, seceded from the United Kingdom under the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1922. The new state took the view that when a new state comes into being after formerly being part of an older state, its acceptance of treaty relationships established by the older state is a matter for the new state to determine by express declaration, or by conduct in the case of each individual treaty. In practice, however, the Irish regarded the commercial and administrative treaties of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland previously applying to the territory of the Irish Free State as remaining in force.

===Israel===

Israel took the view that, by virtue of its declaration of independence in 1948, a new international personality from Mandatory Palestine was created, and that it started with a clean slate, and was bound only by such of the former international obligations affecting the territory as Israel might accept.

===Kampuchea/Cambodia===

When Democratic Kampuchea led by Pol Pot was militarily displaced by the Vietnamese-backed People&#x27;s Republic of Kampuchea, the country&#x27;s United Nations seat was held by Democratic Kampuchea for many years. It is now held by the Kingdom of Cambodia.

===Korea===

When the Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea was formed in 1919, it claimed continuity directly from Korea&#x27;s pre-1910 status. When the modern Republic of Korea was formed in 1948, it claimed that it was identical to Provisional Government of the Republic of Korea and that the Provisional Government succeeded the Korean Empire. An important tenet of the modern state of Republic of Korea is that the Korean Empire&#x27;s incorporation into the Empire of Japan from 1910 to 1945 is internationally recognized as an illegal occupation.

South Korea resumed membership to international organizations such as the Universal Postal Union and re-affirmed that pre-1910 treaties were still in force.

===Ottoman Empire/Turkey===

There is some debate over whether the modern Republic of Turkey is a continuing state to the Ottoman Empire or a successor. The two entities fought on opposing sides in the Turkish War of Independence (1919–23), and even briefly co-existed as separate administrative units (whilst at war with one another): Turkey with its capital in Angora (now Ankara) and the Ottoman Empire from Constantinople (now Istanbul), but this type of scenario is also common in civil wars. The Turkish National Movement, led by Mustafa Kemal who defected from the Ottoman Army, established the modern republic as a nation-state (or new government regime) by defeating the opposing elements in the Turkish War of Independence. There remains debate about whether the conflict was a war of independence, or a civil war that led to a regime change.

The question of state succession is relevant to the issue of Armenian genocide reparations.

===Pakistan===
After Pakistan was created in 1947, it claimed that it was automatically a member of the United Nations. The United Nations Secretariat, however, expressed the following opinion:

===Soviet Union and the Russian Federation===

The Soviet Union (USSR) dissolved in 1991, which together with its Ukrainian SSR and Byelorussian SSR as separate United Nations members, co-founded the United Nations in 1945. 

The Russian Federation succeeded to the Soviet Union&#x27;s United Nations membership, including its permanent membership on the Security Council of the United Nations. Russia accounted for more than 75% of the Soviet Union&#x27;s economy, the majority of its population and 75% of its land mass; in addition, the history of the Soviet Union began in Russia with the October Revolution in 1917 in Petrograd. If there was to be a successor to the Soviet seat on the Security Council among the former Soviet republics, these factors made Russia seem a logical choice. In a letter dated 24 December 1991, the Russian President Boris Yeltsin informed the Secretary-General that the membership of the USSR in the Security Council and all other United Nations organs was being continued by the Russian Federation with the support of the nine member countries of the Commonwealth of Independent States. All Soviet embassies became Russian embassies.

Ukraine, the successor state of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic (legally) being one of the founding members of the Soviet Union, has not recognized the exclusive Russian claims to succession of the Soviet Union and claimed such status for Ukraine as well, which was stated in Articles 7 and 8 of Law on the Succession of Ukraine issued in 1991. After independence, Ukraine has continued to pursue claims against the Russian Federation in foreign courts, seeking to recover its share of the foreign property that was formerly owned by the Soviet Union.

A special case for the Baltic states had existed. An important tenet of the modern states of Estonia, Latvia and Lithuania is that their incorporation into the Soviet Union from 1940 to 1991 constituted an illegal occupation. In 1991, when each Baltic state regained its independence they claimed continuity directly from their pre-1940 status. Many other states share this view, and as such, these states were not considered either predecessor or successor states of the Soviet Union. As a consequence, the Baltic states were able to simply re-establish diplomatic relations with countries, re-affirm pre-1940 treaties still in force, and resume membership in international organizations. A similar situation applies to the Caucasus countries of Armenia, Azerbaijan and Georgia, which claimed continuity of the pre-1921 republics before being conquered by the Red Army as well as Ukraine, which as mentioned above, is the &quot;de facto&quot; successor to the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic that was founded in 1917 before its Sovietization in 1919 (see Soviet–Ukrainian War).

===Yugoslavia===

After four of the six constituent republics of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia seceded in 1991 and 1992, the rump state, renamed the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, stated it was the continuation of the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia—against the objections of the newly independent republics. Representatives from Belgrade continued to hold the original Yugoslavian UN seat—however, the United States refused to recognize it. The remaining territory of the federation was less than half of the population and territory of the former federation. In 1992 the Security Council on 19 September (Resolution 777) and the General Assembly on 22 September, decided to refuse to allow the new federation to sit in the General Assembly under the name of &quot;Yugoslavia&quot; on the theory that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia had dissolved.

The first negotiations on succession issues of the former Socialist Yugoslavia began in 1992 within the framework of the &quot;Working Group on Succession Issues&quot; of the Peace Conference on Yugoslavia. The agreement was initially prevented by the insistence of the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia that it was the exclusive legal and political continuation of Socialist Yugoslavia as well as the owner of all state property owned by the earlier socialist federal government, and that it was willing to renounce a part of it only as an act of goodwill. The Federal Republic of Yugoslavia interpreted the breakup of Yugoslavia as a process of serial secessions and not as a complete dismemberment of the earlier state, an interpretation rejected by the other former Yugoslav republics. The Badinter Arbitration Committee recommended a division of assets and liabilities based on principle of equity, referring to the 1983 &quot;Vienna Convention on Succession of States in Respect of State Property, Archives and Debt&quot; (a convention not in force which at the time was signed by only six states, including SRF Yugoslavia). This proposal was unacceptable to the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which therefore motivated the International Monetary Fund to develop an alternative key model which considered the economic power of republics and their contribution to the federal budget, which was accepted by all. The key determined participation of Federal Republic of Yugoslavia with 36.52%, Croatia with 28.49%, Slovenia 16.39%, Bosnia and Herzegovina with 13.20% and Macedonia with 5.20%. An agreement was also reached on gold and other reserves at the Bank for International Settlements, but the final conclusion was postponed by the beginning of the Kosovo War.

After the end of the NATO bombing of Yugoslavia followed next year by the overthrow of Slobodan Milošević, the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia was admitted as a new member to the United Nations on 1 November 2000. The successor states then concluded their agreement. In 2001, with the support of the international community, five countries (Slovenia, Croatia, Bosnia and Herzegovina, the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia – today North Macedonia — and the Federal Republic of Yugoslavia – today Serbia and Montenegro) signed the Agreement on Succession Issues of the Former Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia which conclusively confirmed that five sovereign equal successor states were formed upon the dissolution of the former SFR Yugoslavia. It entered into force on 2 June 2004, when the last successor state ratified it. The agreement was signed as an umbrella agreement which included annexes on diplomatic and consular properties, financial assets and liabilities, archives, pensions, other rights, interests and liabilities as well as private properties and acquired rights.

FR Yugoslavia was renamed Serbia and Montenegro in 2003, and in May 2006, Montenegro declared independence. Serbia continued to hold the federation&#x27;s seat. At the subsequent dissolution of the state union of Serbia and Montenegro (one of the five successor states), the two countries agreed on Serbian sole succession of rights and obligations of their federation.

Additionally, Kosovo, one of the constituent provinces of Yugoslavia and Serbia, declared independence in February 2008.

<doc id="253130" wikidata="Q310488" url="?curid=253130" title="Prince John of the United Kingdom">
<text>Prince John (John Charles Francis; 12 July 1905 – 18 January 1919) was the fifth son and youngest of the six children of King George V and Queen Mary. At the time of his birth, his father was heir apparent to John&#x27;s grandfather Edward VII. In 1910, John&#x27;s father succeeded to the throne upon Edward VII&#x27;s death, and John became fifth in the line of succession to the British throne.

In 1909, it was discovered that John had epilepsy. In 1916, as his condition deteriorated, he was sent to live at Sandringham House and kept away from the public eye. There, he was cared for by his governess, Charlotte &quot;Lala&quot; Bill, and befriended local children whom his mother had gathered to be his playmates. He died at Sandringham in 1919 after a severe seizure, and was buried at nearby St Mary Magdalene Church. His illness was disclosed to the wider public only after his death.

John&#x27;s seclusion was subsequently brought forward as evidence of the royal family&#x27;s inhumanity. However, contrary to the belief that he was hidden from an early age, John was a fully-fledged member of the family for most of his life, appearing frequently in public until after his eleventh birthday, when his condition became severe.

==Birth==

John was born at York Cottage on the Sandringham Estate on 12 July 1905, at 3:05 am, during the reign of his paternal grandfather, King Edward VII. He was the youngest child and fifth son of George, Prince of Wales, and Mary, Princess of Wales. He was named &quot;John&quot; despite that name&#x27;s unlucky associations for the royal family, but was informally known as &quot;Johnnie&quot;. At the time of his birth, he was sixth in the line of succession to the throne, behind his father and four older brothers. As a grandchild of the reigning British monarch in the male line, and a son of the Prince of Wales, he was formally styled &quot;His Royal Highness Prince John of Wales&quot; from birth.

John was christened on 3 August 1905 in the parish church of St Mary Magdalene at Sandringham, with the Reverend Canon John Neale Dalton officiating. His godparents were King Carlos I of Portugal; John&#x27;s uncles Prince Carl of Denmark and Alexander Duff, 1st Duke of Fife; his great-granduncle Prince Johann of Schleswig-Holstein-Sonderburg-Glücksburg; and three of his first cousins once removed, the Duke and Duchess of Sparta and Princess Alexander of Teck. John&#x27;s father stood proxy for King Carlos, Prince Carl, Prince Johann and the Duke of Fife, while John&#x27;s aunt Princess Victoria stood proxy for the Duchess of Sparta and Princess Alexander.

== Childhood and illness ==

Much of John&#x27;s early life was spent at Sandringham with his siblingsPrince Edward (known as David to the royal family), Prince Albert (Known as Bertie), Princess Mary, Prince Henry and Prince Georgeunder the care of their nanny Charlotte &quot;Lala&quot; Bill. Though a strict disciplinarian, John&#x27;s father was affectionate toward his children; John&#x27;s mother was close to her children and encouraged them to confide in her. In 1909, John&#x27;s grandaunt, the Dowager Empress of Russia, wrote to her son: &quot;George&#x27;s children are very nice... The little ones, George and Johnny are both charming and very amusing&quot;. John&#x27;s aunt Princess Alice, Countess of Athlone, described him as &quot;very quaint and one evening when Uncle George returned from stalking he bent over Aunt May and kissed her, and they heard Johnny soliloquize, &#x27;She kissed Papa, ugly old man! George V once told U.S. President Theodore Roosevelt that &quot;all [his] children [were] obedient, except John&quot;apparently because he alone, among the king&#x27;s children, escaped punishment from their father.

Though a &quot;large and handsome&quot; baby, John had become &quot;winsome&quot; and &quot;painfully slow&quot; by his fourth birthday. That same year, he had his first epileptic seizure and showed signs of a disability, probably autism or learning disabilities. When his father became king, John did not attend his parents&#x27; coronation on 22 June 1911, as this was considered too risky for his health; nonetheless, cynics said that the family feared their reputation would be damaged by any incident involving him. Although John was deemed not &quot;presentable to the outside world,&quot; the king still showed interest in him, offering him &quot;kindness and affection&quot;.
During his time at Sandringham, John exhibited some repetitive behaviours as well as regular misbehaviours and insubordination: &quot;he simply didn&#x27;t understand he needed to [behave].&quot;

In 1912, Prince George, John&#x27;s closest sibling, began St Peter&#x27;s Court Preparatory School at Broadstairs. The next summer, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that John would not attend Broadstairs the next term, and that his parents had not decided whether to send him to school at all. After the outbreak of World War I, he rarely saw his parents, who were often away on official duties, or his siblings, who were either at boarding school or in the military. He slowly disappeared from the public eye and no official portraits of him were commissioned after 1913.

== Wood Farm ==
In 1916, as his seizures became more frequent and severe, John was sent to live at Wood Farm, with Lala Bill in charge of his care. He maintained an interest in the world around him and was capable of coherent thought and expression, but with his lack of educational progress, the last of his tutors was dismissed and his formal education ended. Physicians warned that it was unlikely that he would reach adulthood.

At Wood Farm, John became &quot;a satellite with his own little household on an outlying farm on the Sandringham estate... Guests at Balmoral remember him during the Great War as tall and muscular, but always a distant figure glimpsed from afar in the woods, escorted by his own retainers.&quot; His grandmother Queen Alexandra maintained a garden at Sandringham House especially for him, and this became &quot;one of the great pleasures of [Prince John]&#x27;s life.&quot;

After the summer of 1916, John was rarely seen outside the Sandringham Estate and passed solely into Lala Bill&#x27;s care. After Queen Alexandra wrote that John &quot;is very proud of his house but is longing for a companion&quot;, Queen Mary broke from royal practice by having local children brought in to be playmates for him. One of these was Winifred Thomas, a young girl from Halifax who had been sent to live with her aunt and uncle (who had charge of the royal stables at Sandringham) in hopes her asthma would improve. John had known Winifred years earlier, before World War I. They became close, taking nature walks together and working in Queen Alexandra&#x27;s garden. John also played with his elder siblings when they visited: once, when his two eldest brothers came to visit, the Prince of Wales &quot;took him for a run in a kind of a push-cart, and they both disappeared from view.&quot;

== Death ==
John&#x27;s seizures intensified, and Bill later wrote &quot;we dared not let him be with his brothers and sister, because it upsets them so much, with the attacks getting so bad and coming so often.&quot; Biographer Denis Judd believes that John&#x27;s &quot;seclusion and &#x27;abnormality&#x27; must have been disturbing to his brothers and sister&quot;, as he had been &quot;a friendly, outgoing little boy, much loved by his brothers and sister, a sort of mascot for the family&quot;. He spent Christmas Day 1918 with his family at Sandringham House but was driven back to Wood Farm at night.

On 18 January 1919, after a severe seizure, John died in his sleep at Wood Farm at 5:30 pm. Queen Mary wrote in her diary that the news was:a great shock, tho&#x27; for the poor little boy&#x27;s restless soul, death came as a great relief. [She] broke the news to George and [they] motored down to Wood Farm. Found poor Lala very resigned but heartbroken. Little Johnnie looked very peaceful lying there.

Mary later wrote to Emily Alcock, an old friend, that:for [John] it is a great relief, as his malady was becoming worse as he grew older,&amp; he has thus been spared much suffering. I cannot say how grateful we feel to God for having taken him in such a peaceful way, he just slept quietly into his heavenly home, no pain no struggle, just peace for the poor little troubled spirit which had been a great anxiety to us for many years, ever since he was four years old.She added: &quot;The first break in the family circle is hard to bear, but people have been so kind&amp; sympathetic&amp; this has helped us much.&quot; George described his son&#x27;s death as &quot;the greatest mercy possible&quot;.
On 20 January, the &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; wrote that &quot;when the Prince passed away his face bore an angelic smile&quot;; its report also made the first public mention of John&#x27;s epilepsy. His funeral was the next day at St Mary Magdalene parish church. John Neale Dalton officiated.
Queen Mary wrote:Canon Dalton&amp; Dr Brownhill [John&#x27;s physician] conducted the service which was awfully sad and touching. Many of our own people and the villagers were present. We thanked all Johnnie&#x27;s servants who have been so good and faithful to him.Though nominally private, the funeral was attended by Sandringham House staff; &quot;every single person on the estate went and stood around the gates and his grave was absolutely covered in flowers.&quot; Queen Alexandra wrote to Queen Mary that &quot;now [their] two darling Johnnies lie side by side&quot;.

==Legacy==
Prince Edward, who was 11 years older than John and had hardly known him, saw his death as &quot;little more than a regrettable nuisance.&quot; He wrote an insensitive letter to Queen Mary, which has since been lost. She did not reply, but he felt compelled to write her an apology, in which he stated:I feel such a cold hearted and unsympathetic swine for writing all that I did ... No one can realize more than you how little poor Johnnie meant to me who hardly knew him ... I feel so much for you, darling Mama, who was his mother.In her final mention of John in her diary, Mary wrote simply, &quot;miss the dear child very much indeed.&quot; She gave Winifred Thomas a number of John&#x27;s books, which she had inscribed, &quot;In memory of our dear little Prince.&quot; Lala Bill always kept a portrait of John above her mantelpiece, together with a letter from him that read &quot;nanny, I love you.&quot; In recent years, John&#x27;s seclusion has been brought forward as evidence of the Windsors&#x27; &quot;heartlessness&quot;. According to a 2008 Channel 4 documentary, much of the existing information about John is &quot;based on hearsay and rumour, precisely because so few details of his life and his problems have ever been disclosed&quot;, and the British Epileptic Association has stated:There was nothing unusual in what [the King and Queen] did. At that time, people with epilepsy were put apart from the rest of the community. They were often put in epilepsy colonies or mental institutions. It was thought to be a form of mental illness...adding that it was another 20 years until the idea that epileptics should not be locked away began to take hold.
One author has claimed that the royal family believed that these afflictions might flow through their blood, which was then still believed to be purer than the blood of a commoner, and, as such, wished to hide as much as possible about John&#x27;s illness. Others have suggested that John was sent to Wood Farm to give him the best environment possible under the &quot;austere&quot; conditions of World War I. Another author has claimed that the royal family were &quot;frightened and ashamed of John&#x27;s illness&quot;, and yet another has claimed that John&#x27;s life is &quot;usually portrayed either as tragedy or conspiracy&quot;. At the time that Edward VIII (formerly Prince Edward) abdicated, an attempt was made to discredit Prince Albert, who had succeeded as George VI, by suggesting that he was subject to falling fits, like John. In 1998, after the discovery of two volumes of family photographs, John was briefly brought to public attention.

&quot;The Lost Prince&quot;, a biographical drama about John&#x27;s life written and directed by Stephen Poliakoff, was released in 2003.

<doc id="253137" wikidata="Q284667" url="?curid=253137" title="Electorate of Mainz">
<text>The Electorate of [[Mainz]] ( or &#x27;; ), previously known in English asMentzand by its French nameMayence, was one of the most prestigious and influential states of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. In the hierarchy of the [[Catholic Church]], the [[Elector of Mainz|Archbishop-Elector of Mainz]] was also the Primate of Germany (&#x27;), a purely honorary dignity that was unsuccessfully claimed from time to time by other archbishops. There were only two other ecclesiastical Prince-electors in the Empire: the Electorate of Cologne and the Electorate of Trier.

The Archbishop-Elector of Mainz was also archchancellor of Germany (one of the three component titular kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire, the other two being Italy and Burgundy) and, as such, ranked first among all ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, and was second only to the Emperor. His political role, particularly as an intermediary between the Estates of the Empire and the Emperor, was considerable.

== History ==

The episcopal see was established in ancient Roman times in the city of Mainz, which had been a Roman provincial capital, Moguntiacum. The first bishops before the 4th century have legendary names, beginning with Crescens. 
The first verifiable Bishop of Mainz was Martinus in 343. The ecclesiastical and secular importance of Mainz dates from the accession of St. Boniface to the see in 747. Boniface was previously an archbishop though without an assigned see, but that ecclesiastical status did not immediately devolve upon the see itself until his successor Lullus; during his reign Mainz became an archdiocese, in 781. Another early bishop of Mainz was Aureus of Mainz.

The territory of the Electorate included several non-contiguous blocks of territory: lands near Mainz on both the left and right banks of the Rhine; territory along the Main River above Frankfurt (including the district of Aschaffenburg); the Eichsfeld region in Lower Saxony and Thuringia; and the territory around Erfurt in Thuringia.

As was generally the case in the Holy Roman Empire, the territory of a prince-bishopric or archbishopric differed from that of the corresponding diocese or archdiocese, which was the purely spiritual jurisdiction of the prince-bishop or archbishop. During the early modern age, the archdiocese of Mainz (see map below) was the largest ecclesiastical province of Germany, covering Mainz and 10 suffragant dioceses.

In 1802, Mainz lost its archiepiscopal character. In the secularizations that accompanied the &quot;&quot; (German mediatization) of 1803, the seat of the elector, Karl Theodor von Dalberg, was moved to Regensburg, and the electorate lost its left bank territories to France, its right bank areas along the Main below Frankfurt to Hesse-Darmstadt and the Nassau princes, and Eichsfeld and Erfurt to the Kingdom of Prussia. Dalberg retained the Aschaffenburg area as the Principality of Aschaffenburg. In 1810 Dalberg merged Aschaffenburg, Frankfurt, Wetzlar, Hanau, and Fulda, to form the new Grand Duchy of Frankfurt in 1810. Dalberg resigned in 1813 and in 1815 the Congress of Vienna divided his territories between the Kingdom of Bavaria, the Electorate of Hesse-Kassel (or Hesse-Cassel), the Grand Duchy of Hesse and the Free City of Frankfurt.

The modern Roman Catholic Diocese of Mainz was founded in 1802 when Mainz lost its archdiocese status and its territory west of the Rhine River became a mere diocese within the territory of France. In 1814 its jurisdiction was extended over the territory of Hesse-Darmstadt. Since then it has had two cardinals and via various concordats was allowed to retain the medieval tradition of the cathedral chapter electing a successor to the bishop.

<doc id="253140" wikidata="Q704312" url="?curid=253140" title="Grand Duchy of Frankfurt">
<text>The Grand Duchy of Frankfurt was a German satellite state of Napoleonic creation. It came into existence in 1810 through the combination of the former territories of the Archbishopric of Mainz along with the Free City of Frankfurt itself.

==History==
Frankfurt lost its status as a free imperial city in 1806 with the dissolution of the Holy Roman Empire. The city was granted to the former archbishop of Mainz, Karl Theodor Anton Maria von Dalberg, and became the Principality of Frankfurt. When Dalberg was forced by Napoleon to relinquish his Principality of Regensburg to the Kingdom of Bavaria in 1810, his remaining territories of Aschaffenburg, Wetzlar, Fulda, Hanau, and Frankfurt were combined into the new Grand Duchy of Frankfurt.

Although the grand duchy was named after Frankfurt, the city was administered by French commissioners while Dalberg resided in the city of Aschaffenburg. According to the constitution of the grand duchy, upon Dalberg&#x27;s death, the state would be inherited by Napoleon&#x27;s stepson, Eugène de Beauharnais.

Dalberg abdicated in favour of Eugène on 26 October 1813, following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Leipzig. The grand duchy ceased to exist after December 1813, when the city was occupied by allied troops. While Frankfurt itself once again became a free city, most of the territory of the grand duchy was ultimately annexed by the Kingdom of Bavaria.

<text>Fúamnach, or Fuamnach, is Midir&#x27;s first wife and a witch of the Tuatha Dé Danann in the medieval Irish text &quot;Tochmarc Étaíne&quot; (&quot;The Wooing of Étaín&quot;). The text describes her as being intelligent (&quot;gáeth&quot;), cunning (&quot;trebar&quot;) and &quot;versed in the knowledge and power of the Túatha Dé Danand&quot;, explaining that her fosterfather had been the wizard druid Bresal Etarlám. She is said to be of the progeny (&quot;clann&quot;) of Béothach son of Iardanél, who is probably identical with Béothach son of Iarbonel, the father of the Túatha Dé Danann in the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;.

==Summary==

When Midir fell in love with Étaín and married her, Fúamnach got so jealous that she cast several spells on her as soon as the couple arrived in Midir&#x27;s residence in Brí Léith: 
*First, having welcomed the couple and having seated Étáin in the centre of the house, she struck her wand of scarlet rowan (&quot;cáerthann&quot;) on her, transforming her rival into a pool of water. When Étaín changed from being a pool to a worm and subsequently a beautiful scarlet fly (&quot;cuil corcrai&quot;), she joined Midir once more as his companion.
*Second, on a visit to Midir (escorted by Lug, the Dagdae and Ogmae), Fúamnach announced that she would drive Étaín away from him and employed a spell which she had learnt from her fosterfather: she conjured up a mighty wind which blew Étaín through the air for the duration of seven years, after which she came to Óengus (Mac Óc) in the Brug. He lovingly kept her with him in a specially designed, protective bower (&quot;grianán&quot;).
*Third, on discovering what had come of Étaín, Fúamnach deceived Mac Óc into coming to Brí Léith on the pretext that she desired to establish peace between them. However, as Mac Óc was on his way, Fúamnach travelled to the Brug by an alternative route and conjured up yet another wind which forced Étaín to roam another seven years without setting foot on land. Étaín finally arrived at a house in Ulster, where she fell into the cup of the (anonymous) wife of the warrior Étar. As she emptied her cup, she swallowed Étaín and miraculously gave (re-)birth to Étaín as her own daughter (the tale goes on to say that Étaín grew up and met a mysterious horseman who had been looking for her).

Fúamnach did not live long to see the fruits of her work. When Mac Óc met Midir at Brí Léith, he discovered what deceptive scheme had led him there. Mac Óc followed Fúamnach&#x27;s trail to the house of her fosterfather Bresal and there struck off her head, which he carried as a trophy back to the Brug.

==Name==
The name Fúamnach may be an adjective noun derived from &quot;fúaimm&quot; &quot;noise, sound&quot;. To cite one example, the dindsenchas poem on Nás speaks of &quot;fáidiud find-gel fúamnach Fáil&quot; (&quot;the lamentation of the fair-skinned vocal women of Fáil&quot;). The form &quot;fúaimnech&quot; is also attested as a personal name for Fúaimnech, daughter of Conn Cétchathach, who appears in the legal tract &quot;Mellbretha&quot;.

<doc id="253147" wikidata="Q7904317" url="?curid=253147" title="Electorate of Cologne">
<text>The Electorate of Cologne (), sometimes referred to as Electoral Cologne (), was an ecclesiastical principality of the Holy Roman Empire that existed from the 10th to the early 19th century. It consisted of the Hochstift—the temporal possessions—of the archbishop of Cologne, and was ruled by him in his capacity as prince-elector. There were only two other ecclesiastical prince-electors in the Empire: the Electorate of Mainz and the Electorate of Trier. The archbishop-elector of Cologne was also arch-chancellor of Italy (one of the three component titular kingdoms of the Holy Roman Empire, the other two being Germany and Burgundy) and, as such, ranked second among all ecclesiastical and secular princes of the Empire, after the archbishop-elector of Mainz, and before that of Trier.

The capital of the electorate was Cologne. Conflicts with the citizens of Cologne caused the elector to move to Bonn. The Free Imperial City of Cologne was recognized after 1475, thus removing it from even the nominal secular authority of the elector. Cologne and Bonn were occupied by France in 1794. The right bank territories of the electorate were secularized in 1803 during the German mediatization.

The electorate should not be confused with the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cologne, the area over which the archbishop exercised spiritual authority, which was larger. Even larger was the Ecclesiastical Province of Cologne, which included suffragan dioceses such as Liège and Münster (see map below).

==History==

Cologne was the ancient Roman city of Colonia Agrippina in the province of Germania Inferior, and has been a bishop&#x27;s see since Roman times. In 953, the archbishops of Cologne first gained noteworthy secular power, when Bishop Bruno was appointed as duke by his brother Emperor Otto I. To weaken the secular nobility, who threatened his power, Otto endowed Bruno and his successors in the bishop&#x27;s seat with the prerogatives of secular princes. This was the beginning of the electoral state of Cologne. It was formed from the temporal possessions of the archbishopric and included in the end a strip of territory along the left Bank of the Rhine east of Jülich, and the Duchy of Westphalia on the other side of the Rhine, beyond Berg and Mark.

By the end of the 12th century, the Archbishop of Cologne was one of the seven electors of the Holy Roman Emperor. Besides being prince-elector, he was Arch-chancellor of Italy as well, technically from 1238 and permanently from 1263 until 1803. In the Battle of Worringen (1288), the archbishop was captured by soldiers of the city and was forced to grant the city near-complete autonomy. Eventually, the archbishop moved to Bonn to escape jurisdiction conflicts with the city government. In 1475, Cologne became a Free Imperial City, independent from the archbishop. The first pogrom against the Jews was in 1349, when they were used as scapegoats for the Black Death, and therefore burnt in an &quot;auto-da-fé&quot;. Political tensions arose from issues of taxation, public spending, regulation of business, and market supervision, as well as the limits of corporate autonomy.

Long-distance trade in the Baltic grew, as the major trading towns came together in the Hanseatic League, under the leadership of Lübeck. It was a business alliance of trading cities and their guilds that dominated trade along the coast of Northern Europe and flourished from the 1200 to 1500 and continued with lesser importance after that. The chief cities were Cologne on the Rhine River, Hamburg and Bremen on the North Sea, and Lübeck on the Baltic. The economic structures of medieval and early modern Cologne were based on the city&#x27;s major harbor, its location as a transport hub and its entrepreneurial merchants who built ties with merchants in other Hanseatic cities.

During the 16th century, two Archbishops of Cologne converted to Protestantism. The first, Hermann von Wied, resigned the archbishopric on converting, but Gebhard Truchsess von Waldburg, who converted to Calvinism in 1582, attempted to secularize the archbishopric. His marriage the following February, and his refusal to relinquish the territory resulted in the election of a competing archbishop and prince-elector, Ernst of Bavaria, brother of the Wittelsbach Duke of Bavaria. In the Cologne War that followed, the pope funded Italian and Spanish mercenaries and the Catholic Bavarians also sent an army to support Ernst, while the Protestant Netherlands supported von Waldburg. The war ruined most of the Electoral economy, and many villages and towns were besieged and destroyed. The Siege of Godesberg in November–December 1583 ended with the destruction of Godesberg Castle and the slaughter of most of its inhabitants. After several more sieges, von Waldburg gave up his claim to the see and retired to Strasbourg with his wife. Ernst became archbishop–the first major success of the Counter-Reformation in Germany. Under Ernst&#x27;s direction, Jesuits supervised the reintroduction of Catholicism in the Electorate. From 1583 to 1761, the archbishopric was effectively a secundogeniture of the Bavarian branch of the House of Wittelsbach. As the archbishop in this period usually also held the Bishopric of Münster (and often the Bishopric of Liège), he was one of the most important princes of northwestern Germany.

From 1597 until 1794, Bonn was the residence the Elector, and consequently the capital of the Electorate.
After 1795, the electorate&#x27;s territories on the left bank of the Rhine were occupied by France and were formally annexed in 1801. Cologne was part of the &quot;département&quot; of Roer; Bonn was part of the &quot;département&quot; of Rhin-et-Moselle. The &quot;Reichsdeputationshauptschluss&quot; of 1803 secularized the rest of the archbishopric, giving the Duchy of Westphalia to the Landgraviate of Hesse-Darmstadt and Vest Recklinghausen to the Duke of Arenberg. Cologne was, however, reestablished as the seat of a Catholic archbishop in 1824, and is an archdiocese to the present day.

<doc id="253148" wikidata="Q7307828" url="?curid=253148" title="Reg Mombassa">
<text>Christopher O&#x27;Doherty, also known by the pseudonym Reg Mombassa, is a New Zealand-born Australian artist and musician. He is a founding member of the band Mental As Anything and member of Dog Trumpet (alongside his brother Peter O&#x27;Doherty).

==Early and personal life==
Mombassa was born Christopher O&#x27;Doherty in Auckland, New Zealand, on 14 August 1951. O&#x27;Doherty, his parents and younger brother Peter immigrated to Sydney, Australia, in 1969. He enrolled in what is now the National Art School in Darlinghurst in 1969 but left the following year. He returned again in 1975 and obtained his Diploma of Painting in 1977. Between and during his stints at college he supported himself with menial jobs such as builder&#x27;s labouring, cleaning, house painting and working on the railways. 

In 1976 he formed the rock band Mental as Anything with four fellow art school students, ostensibly to play at school parties. Although they did not initially intend to be a serious band, the Mentals, as they became known, eventually turned professional.

Mombassa is the father of comedian Claudia O’Doherty.

==Art career==

Mombassa&#x27;s artwork is in two distinctive styles. The type of artwork he designs for the Mambo fashion label is almost cartoonish and in vivid colours, incorporating religious, political and popular culture themes. He also produces landscapes and portraits, many of which are inspired by his childhood in New Zealand. His artworks can be found in the Art Gallery of New South Wales, the National Gallery of Australia and regional galleries. Patrick White, Elton John and Ewan McGregor have all purchased his work.

Mombassa&#x27;s first public showing was in a group exhibition held at Watters Gallery in Sydney in 1975 while he was still attending art college. It was at this exhibition that Patrick White purchased some works and subsequently became a patron, purchasing many others over his life. He first exhibited solo at Watters in 1986, the year he also began designing clothing for Mambo. His works were exhibited in three Mental as Anything collective exhibitions in 1982, 1990 and 1998. Further solo shows were held at Watters in 1991, 1993, 1995 and 1998. Alongside posters, record covers and merchandise for Mental As Anything and Dog Trumpet, he has designed record covers for the likes of PIL, Crowded House, Mondo Rock and Paul Kelly. He has gifted artwork to many charitable and environmental organisations including Greenpeace and The Wilderness Society.

As Mombassa&#x27;s artistic output and demand increased it prompted him to make the difficult decision to cease touring with the Mentals in April 2000. He has continued to design for Mambo and hold sellout exhibitions at Watters in 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007 and 2009.

In January 2000, a career retrospective of his work was held in Sydney at the S. H. Ervin Gallery. An 80-page catalogue was released by the National Trust to coincide with this exhibition. It also saw the release of &quot;Golden Sandals&quot; directed by Haydn Keenan, a documentary on Mombassa featuring animated versions of his artwork. In March 2007 his self-portrait was selected as a finalist in the Archibald Prize. 2 May 2007 saw the broadcast of &quot;Golden Sandals&quot; on SBS independent. One of his most famous works was &quot;Self-Portrait with Spots and Veins&quot; (2003). He was also featured on the ABC TV profile show &quot;Talking Heads&quot;. In 2009 he was featured on BBC TV&#x27;s &quot;Peschardt&#x27;s People&quot;. In November 2009 HarperCollins released a biography by Murray Waldren called &quot;The mind and times of Reg Mombassa&quot;, which includes over 200 art works.

In 2013, Mombassa was the creative ambassador for Sydney New Year&#x27;s Eve; the event featured a special one-minute display inspired by one of his paintings, and artwork of a giant blinking eye on Sydney Harbour Bridge.

==The origin of the name Reg Mombassa==
In the early days of the Mentals, the band would often invent pseudonyms for each other that combined an exotic last name with a common Australian first name. &quot;Reg Mombassa&quot; was one of the products of that amusement. He has stated in interviews that some of his earlier pseudonyms included &quot;Brett Orlando&quot; and &quot;Dorky Bladder&quot;.

==Dog Trumpet==
In 1991, Mombassa formed the band Dog Trumpet with his brother Peter O&#x27;Doherty. Since leaving the Mentals this has been his sole musical outlet. Dog Trumpet has released eight studio albums and three EPs. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Medicated Spirits&quot; was released in August 2013 and was long-listed for the Australian Music Prize Album of the Year award for 2013. Dog Trumpet released the album &quot;Great South Road&quot; in May 2020 and signed to Demon Music in 2021; and all of their albums at that time were issued on Vinyl on 29th Oct 2021. Dog Trumpet&#x27;s seventh album, &quot;Great South Road&quot;, featured the singles &quot;Gravity&quot;, &quot;Wallpaper&quot;, &quot;Lonely Death Cleaning Company&quot;, &quot;You&#x27;ve Heard it All Before&quot; and &quot;Overseas and Elsewhere&quot;. The album garnered great reviews and because of COVID19 the brothers decided to do various performances live on Facebook to promote the album.

A new single and video, &quot;F**king Idiots&quot;, was released 20 May 2022. Dog Trumpet released a further single. &quot;The Ballad of Clayton Looby&quot; on 9 September 2022, from their album, &quot;Shadowland&quot;, which was released on 4 November 2022, on vinyl, CD and digitally worldwide by the Demon Music Group. The video for &quot;The Ballad of Clayton Looby&quot;, contains footage from some of Australia&#x27;s 1970s surf films, including Alby Falzon&#x27;s &quot;Morning of the Earth&quot; and Phil and Russell Shepard&#x27;s &quot;A Winter’s Tale&quot; and Paul Witzig&#x27;s &quot;The Lost Witzig Reels&quot;. &quot;Nina Simone&quot; the third single from &quot;Shadowland&quot;, was released on 7 October 2022. A video for the title track was released on 12 December 2022

&quot;Shadowland&quot; is a distinctive blending of psychedelia, folk and blues, the album probes the perils and absurdities of human existence, kicking off with the title track &quot;Shadowland&quot;, a nervous musing on digital over-surveillance; followed by &quot;Nina Simone&quot;, a song reflecting on romance and memory. &quot;F***ing Idiots&quot; points out the shameful idiocy of our addiction to war and militarism; &quot;The Ballad of Clayton Looby&quot; is an anti-establishment ode to a larrikin surfer.

==Other music and films==
In 1987, with Peter, Martin Plaza and members of GANGgajang, Mombassa recorded a country music album credited to The Stetsons.

Mombassa has also appeared in a number of small Australian films, including &quot;Tender Hooks&quot; (1989), &quot;Strange Planet&quot; (1999) and &quot;Love&#x27;s Brother&quot; (2004).

<text>Porter&#x27;s Five Forces Framework is a method of analysing the competitive environment of a business. It draws from industrial organization (IO) economics to derive five forces that determine the competitive intensity and, therefore, the attractiveness (or lack thereof) of an industry in terms of its profitability. An &quot;unattractive&quot; industry is one in which the effect of these five forces reduces overall profitability. The most unattractive industry would be one approaching &quot;pure competition&quot;, in which available profits for all firms are driven to normal profit levels. The five-forces perspective is associated with its originator, Michael E. Porter of Harvard University. This framework was first published in &quot;Harvard Business Review&quot; in 1979.

Porter refers to these forces as the microenvironment, to contrast it with the more general term macroenvironment. They consist of those forces close to a company that affects its ability to serve its customers and make a profit. A change in any of the forces normally requires a business unit to re-assess the marketplace given the overall change in industry information. The overall industry attractiveness does not imply that every firm in the industry will return the same profitability. Firms are able to apply their core competencies, business model or network to achieve a profit above the industry average. A clear example of this is the airline industry. As an industry, profitability is low because the industry&#x27;s underlying structure of high fixed costs and low variable costs afford enormous latitude in the price of airline travel. Airlines tend to compete on cost, and that drives down the profitability of individual carriers as well as the industry itself because it simplifies the decision by a customer to buy or not buy a ticket. This underscores the need for businesses to continuously evaluate their competitive landscape and adapt strategies in response to changes in industry dynamics, exemplified by the airline industry&#x27;s struggle with profitability despite varying approaches to differentiation. A few carriers – Richard Branson&#x27;s Virgin Atlantic is one – have tried, with limited success, to use sources of differentiation in order to increase profitability.

Porter&#x27;s five forces include three forces from &#x27;horizontal competition&#x27; – the threat of substitute products or services, the threat of established rivals, and the threat of new entrants – and two others from &#x27;vertical&#x27; competition – the bargaining power of suppliers and the bargaining power of customers.

Porter developed his five forces framework in reaction to the then-popular SWOT analysis, which he found both lacking in rigor and &quot;ad hoc&quot;. Porter&#x27;s five-forces framework is based on the structure–conduct–performance paradigm in industrial organizational economics. Other Porter&#x27;s strategy tools include the value chain and generic competitive strategies.

== Five forces that shape competition ==
=== Threat of new entrants ===
New entrants put pressure on current within an industry through their desire to gain market share. This in turn puts pressure on prices, costs, and the rate of investment needed to sustain a business within the industry. The threat of new entrants is particularly intense if they are diversifying from another market as they can leverage existing expertise, cash flow, and brand identity which puts a strain on existing companies 
profitability.

Barriers to entry restrict the threat of new entrants. If the barriers are high, the threat of new entrants is reduced, and conversely, if the barriers are low, the risk of new companies venturing into a given market is high. Barriers to entry are advantages that existing, established companies have over new entrants.

Michael E. Porter differentiates two factors that can have an effect on how much of a threat new entrants may pose:
; Barriers to entry
: The most attractive segment is one in which entry barriers are high and exit barriers are low. It is worth noting, however, that high barriers to entry almost always make exit more difficult.
: Michael E. Porter lists 7 major sources of entry barriers:
:* Supply-side economies of scale – spreading the fixed costs over a larger volume of units thus reducing the cost per unit. This can discourage a new entrant because they either have to start trading at a smaller volume of units and accept a price disadvantage over larger companies, or risk coming into the market on a large scale in an attempt to displace the existing market leader.
:* Demand-side benefits of scale – this occurs when a buyer&#x27;s willingness to purchase a particular product or service increases with other people&#x27;s willingness to purchase it. Also known as the network effect, people tend to value being in a &#x27;network&#x27; with a larger number of people who use the same company. 
:* Customer switching costs – These are well illustrated by structural market characteristics such as supply chain integration but also can be created by firms. Airline frequent flyer programs are an example. 
:* Capital requirements – clearly the Internet has influenced this factor dramatically. Websites and apps can be launched cheaply and easily as opposed to the brick-and-mortar industries of the past.
:* Incumbency advantages independent of size (e.g., customer loyalty and brand equity).
:* Unequal access to distribution channels – if there are a limited number of distribution channels for a certain product/service, new entrants may struggle to find a retail or wholesale channel to sell through as existing competitors will have a claim on them.
:* Government policy such as sanctioned monopolies, legal franchise requirements, patents, and regulatory requirements.
; Expected retaliation
: For example, a specific characteristic of oligopoly markets is that prices generally settle at an equilibrium because any price rises or cuts are easily matched by the competition.

=== Threat of substitutes ===
A substitute product uses a different technology to try to solve the same economic need. Examples of substitutes are meat, poultry, and fish; landlines and cellular telephones; airlines, automobiles, trains, and ships; beer and wine; and so on. For example, tap water is a substitute for Coke, but Pepsi is a product that uses the same technology (albeit different ingredients) to compete head-to-head with Coke, so it is not a substitute. Increased marketing for drinking tap water might &quot;shrink the pie&quot; for both Coke and Pepsi, whereas increased Pepsi advertising would likely &quot;grow the pie&quot; (increase consumption of all soft drinks), while giving Pepsi a larger market share at Coke&#x27;s expense.

Potential factors:
* Buyer propensity to substitute. This aspect incorporated both tangible and intangible factors. Brand loyalty can be very important as in the Coke and Pepsi example above; however, contractual and legal barriers are also effective.
* Relative price performance of substitute
* Buyer&#x27;s switching costs. This factor is well illustrated by the mobility industry. Uber and its many competitors took advantage of the incumbent taxi industry&#x27;s dependence on legal barriers to entry and when those fell away, it was trivial for customers to switch. There were no costs as every transaction was atomic, with no incentive for customers not to try another product. 
* Perceived level of product differentiation which is classic Michael Porter in the sense that there are only two basic mechanisms for competition – lowest price or differentiation. Developing multiple products for niche markets is one way to mitigate this factor. 
* Number of substitute products available in the market
* Ease of substitution
* Availability of close substitutes

=== Bargaining power of customers ===
The bargaining power of customers is also described as the market of outputs: the ability of customers to put the firm under pressure, which also affects the customer&#x27;s sensitivity to price changes. Firms can take measures to reduce buyer power, such as implementing a loyalty program. Buyers&#x27; power is high if buyers have many alternatives. It is low if they have few choices.

Potential factors:
* Buyer concentration to firm concentration ratio
* Degree of dependency upon existing channels of distribution
* Bargaining leverage, particularly in industries with high fixed costs
* Buyer switching costs
* Buyer information availability
* Availability of existing substitute products
* Buyer price sensitivity
* Differential advantage (uniqueness) of industry products
* RFM (customer value) Analysis

=== Bargaining power of suppliers ===
The bargaining power of suppliers is also described as the market of inputs. Suppliers of raw materials, components, labor, and services (such as expertise) to the firm can be a source of power over the firm when there are few substitutes. If you are making biscuits and there is only one person who sells flour, you have no alternative but to buy it from them. Suppliers may refuse to work with the firm or charge excessively high prices for unique resources.

Potential factors are:
* Supplier switching costs relative to firm switching costs
* Degree of differentiation of inputs
* Impact of inputs on cost and differentiation
* Presence of substitute inputs
* Strength of the distribution channel
* Supplier concentration to the firm concentration ratio
* Employee solidarity (e.g. labor unions)
* Supplier competition: the ability to forward vertically integrate and cut out the buyer.

=== Competitive rivalry ===
Competitive rivalry is a measure of the extent of competition among existing firms. Price cuts, increased advertising expenditures, or investing in service/product enhancements and innovation are all examples of competitive moves that might limit profitability and lead to competitive moves(Dhliwayo, Witness 2022). For most industries, the intensity of competitive rivalry is the biggest determinant of the competitiveness of the industry. Understanding industry rivals is vital to successfully marketing a product. Positioning depends on how the public perceives a product and distinguishes it from that of competitors. An organization must be aware of its competitors&#x27; marketing strategies and pricing and also be reactive to any changes made. Rivalry among competitors tends to be cutthroat and industry profitability is low while having the potential factors below:

Potential factors:
* Competitive advantage through innovation
* Competition between online and offline organizations
* Level of advertising expense
* Powerful competitive strategy which could potentially be realized by adhering to Porter&#x27;s work on low cost versus differentiation.
* Firm concentration ratio

== Factors, not forces ==
Other factors below should also be considered as they can contribute in evaluating a firm&#x27;s strategic position. These factors can commonly be mistaken for being the underlying structure of the firm; however, the underlying structure consists of the five factors above.

=== Industry growth rate ===
Sometimes bad strategy decisions can be made when a narrow focus is kept on the growth rate of an industry. While rapid growth in an industry can seem attractive, it can also attract new entrants especially if entry barriers are low and suppliers are powerful. Furthermore, profitability is not guaranteed if powerful substitutes become available to the customers.

For example, Blockbuster dominated the rental market throughout 1990s. In 1998, Reed Hastings founded Netflix and entered the market. Netflix&#x27;s CEO was famously laughed out of the room. While Blockbuster was thriving and expanding rapidly, its key pitfall was ignoring its competitors and focusing on its growth in the industry.

=== Technology and innovation ===
Technology in itself is a rapidly growing industry. Regardless of the advanced growth, it presents its limitations; such as customers not being able to physically touch/test products. Technology stand alone cannot always provide a desirable experience for a customer. &quot;Boring&quot; companies that are in high entry barrier industries with high switching costs and price-sensitive buyers can be more profitable than &quot;tech savvy&quot; companies.

For example, quite commonly websites with menus and online booking options attract customers to a restaurant. But the restaurant experience cannot be delivered online with the use of technology. Food delivery companies like Uber Eats can deliver food to customers but cannot replace the restaurant&#x27;s atmospheric experience.

=== Government ===
Government cannot be a standalone force as it is a factor that can affect the firms structure of five forces above. It is neither good or bad for the industry&#x27;s profitability.

For instance,

* patents can raise barriers to entry 
* supplier power can be raised by union favoritism from government policies 
* failing companies reorganizing due to bankruptcy laws 

=== Complementary products and services ===
Similar to the government above, complementary products/services cannot be a standalone factor because it&#x27;s not necessarily bad or good for the industry&#x27;s profitability. Complements occur when a customer benefits from multiple products combined. Individually those standalone products can be redundant. For example, a car would be unusable without petrol/gas and a driver. Or for example, a computer is best used with computer software. This factor is controversial (as discussed below in Criticisms) as many believe it to be 6th Force. However, complements influence the forces more than they form the underlying structure of the market.

For instance, complements can

* influence barriers of entry by either lowering or raising it e.g. Apple providing set of tools to develop apps, lowers barriers to entry; 
* make substitution easier e.g. Spotify replacing CDs

A strategy consultant&#x27;s job is to identify complements and apply them to the forces above.

==Usage==
Strategy consultants occasionally use Porter&#x27;s five forces framework when making a qualitative evaluation of a firm&#x27;s strategic position. However, for most consultants, the framework is only a starting point and value chain analysis or another type of analysis may be used in conjunction with this model. Like all general frameworks, an analysis that uses it to the exclusion of specifics about a particular situation is considered naïve .

According to Porter, the five forces framework should be used at the line-of-business industry level; it is not designed to be used at the industry group or industry sector level. An industry is defined at a lower, more basic level: a market in which similar or closely related products and/or services are sold to buyers (see industry information). A firm that competes in a single industry should develop, at a minimum, one five forces analysis for its industry. Porter makes clear that for diversified companies, the primary issue in corporate strategy is the selection of industries (lines of business) in which the company will compete. The average &quot;Fortune Global 1,000&quot; company competes in 52 industries.

== Criticisms ==
Porter&#x27;s framework has been challenged by other academics and strategists. For instance, Kevin P. Coyne and Somu Subramaniam claim that three dubious assumptions underlie the five forces:
* That buyers, competitors, and suppliers are unrelated and do not interact and collude.
* That the source of value is a structural advantage (creating barriers to entry).
* That uncertainty is low, allowing participants in a market to plan for and respond to changes in competitive behavior.

An important extension to Porter&#x27;s work came from Adam Brandenburger and Barry Nalebuff of Yale School of Management in the mid-1990s. Using game theory, they added the concept of complementors (also called &quot;the 6th force&quot;) to try to explain the reasoning behind strategic alliances. Complementors are known as the impact of related products and services already in the market. The idea that complementors are the sixth force has often been credited to Andrew Grove, former CEO of Intel Corporation. Martyn Richard Jones, while consulting at Groupe Bull, developed an augmented five forces model in Scotland in 1993. It is based on Porter&#x27;s Framework and includes Government (national and regional) as well as pressure groups as the notional 6th force. This model was the result of work carried out as part of Groupe Bull&#x27;s Knowledge Asset Management Organisation initiative.

Porter indirectly rebutted the assertions of other forces, by referring to innovation, government, and complementary products and services as &quot;factors&quot; that affect the five forces.

It is also perhaps not feasible to evaluate the attractiveness of an industry independently of the resources that a firm brings to that industry. It is thus argued (Wernerfelt 1984) that this theory be combined with the resource-based view (RBV) in order for the firm to develop a sounder framework.

Other criticisms include:

* It places too much weight on the macro-environment and doesn&#x27;t assess more specific areas of the business that also impact competitiveness and profitability
* It does not provide any actions to help deal with high or low force threats (e.g., what should management do if there is a high threat of substitution?)

<text>The Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, commonly known as the U.S. Open Cup (USOC), is a knockout cup competition in men&#x27;s soccer in the United States. It is the country&#x27;s oldest ongoing national soccer competition. The competition was first held during the 1913–1914 season as the National Challenge Cup, with Brooklyn Field Club winning a trophy donated by Thomas Dewar for the promotion of American soccer. It was renamed and dedicated to North American Soccer League (NASL) and Major League Soccer (MLS) executive Lamar Hunt by the United States Soccer Federation (USSF) in 1999.

In its current format, the U.S Open Cup is contested by approximately 100 clubs from the professional leagues sanctioned by the USSF, MLS, the USL Championship and League One divisions, the National Independent Soccer Association (NISA), and MLS Next Pro – as well as amateur clubs in the earlier rounds of the tournament that qualify through their respective leagues. The overall champion is awarded $300,000 in prize money and a berth in the CONCACAF Champions Cup, while the runner-up receives $100,000, and the furthest-advancing team from each lower-division league receives $25,000.

MLS teams have dominated the competition since the league began play in 1996. No lower division team has won the Open Cup since the Rochester Rhinos in 1999, and the most recent lower division team to reach the final was Sacramento Republic FC in 2022. The most recent champions of the competition, Los Angeles FC, won their first title after defeating Sporting Kansas City in the 2024 final. From 1996 to 2023, MLS teams had participated in every Open Cup competition.

The 2022 U.S. Open Cup marked the return of the competition after the 2020 and 2021 tournaments were canceled due to the COVID-19 pandemic, ending 106 years of consecutive play.

On December 15, 2023, MLS announced that affiliated reserve teams from MLS Next Pro would be sent in place of MLS teams for the 2024 edition. U.S. Soccer subsequently denied the request, ruling that MLS teams must compete in the 2024 edition of the U.S. Open Cup.

==Format==

The competition is a single-elimination tournament that has been contested by at least 80 teams since the 2014 edition. This pool consists of the American clubs in the professional leagues, which are Major League Soccer, the league now known as the USL Championship, USL League One and National Independent Soccer Association as well as amateur teams from the Premier Development League (now USL League Two), National Premier Soccer League, the United States Adult Soccer Association, and US Club Soccer. The qualifying rounds have evolved over the years. Amateur and lower-league teams play in months leading up to the formal tournament rounds, with qualifying winners advancing to face USL clubs in geographical pairings in what most recently has been termed the &quot;second round&quot;. The winner of each match progresses to the next round and the loser is eliminated from the tournament. Most MLS clubs now enter play in the third round, played in April, matched geographically with the winners of the second round. The highest eight ranked MLS teams enter in the Round of 32 in May. Pairings in each round are done by draw within geographic areas, until a final bracket of 4 teams each in 4 geographic regions is established. After the fourth round, no new teams are introduced, leading to quarterfinals in June, the semifinal round in August, and a final match to determine the champion in September. Every match, including the final, lasts 90 minutes plus any additional stoppage time. If no clear winner has been determined after 90 minutes of normal time, 30 minutes of extra time is played. If the score is still level after extra time then the winner is decided by a penalty shoot-out.

===Qualification===
Through the 2011 edition, eight teams from each level of the American Soccer Pyramid took part in the competition proper, with each league narrowing its delegation separately in the spring before the competition officially began in the summer. In some cases, additional teams played in qualifying rounds to gain entry. One example was found with MLS clubs, as only the top six from the previous regular season received automatic bids, while the bottom U.S.-based MLS teams faced each other to qualify for the remaining two MLS slots.

Beginning in 2012, the competition was expanded from its previous 40 teams to 64, with the qualifying process radically changed. The National Premier Soccer League received six places, plus the possibility of a seventh in a playoff against a team from the amateur US Club Soccer setup. Nine clubs from the USASA earned places, as did 16 USL Premier Development League teams. Each of these organizations has its own qualifying process to determine its entrants. These 32 teams competed in the first round of the Cup, with the winners meeting all 16 USL Pro and NASL teams in the second round. The 16 U.S.-based MLS teams entered in the third round.

In 2013 the competition was expanded to 68 teams. All U.S.-based Division I, II and III teams participated in the tournament proper: 16 from Major League Soccer, six from the North American Soccer League and 12 from USL PRO. The remaining 34 spots in the tournament field were filled by amateur teams from the Adult Council category–16 from the Premier Development League, eight from U.S. Adult Soccer Association regional qualifying, eight from the National Premier Soccer League, one from US Club Soccer and one from the United States Specialty Sports Association.

The process for determining the site for the Open Cup tournament semifinals and final was changed in 2013. In past years, the sites for the final three matches of the tournament had been determined through a sealed-bid process, but in 2013 the hosts of those games were determined by a coin flip. Home teams throughout the entire tournament were determined by random selection.

Since 2008, the champion of the U.S. Open Cup has earned the right to play in the CONCACAF Champions Cup. The first team to represent the U.S. as Open Cup champion was 2007&#x27;s winner, New England Revolution.

Starting in 2016, lower-division professional clubs owned by higher-division professional clubs are no longer eligible to participate in the U.S. Open Cup. This removed the MLS reserve clubs in USL from the 2016 competition, after issues of clubs holding back players from their USL sides in 2015 in order to keep them eligible to play for the parent MLS club. Players are only allowed to play for one club in any US Open Cup season. Amateur clubs remain eligible to enter even if they are owned by professional clubs. Initially, &quot;hybrid affiliate&quot; clubs—i.e., lower-division professional clubs that are staffed but not owned by higher-division clubs—also remained eligible, but those clubs were also banned effective with the 2016 competition. This last change was proposed by the Houston Dynamo, which were the senior club to Rio Grande Valley FC Toros in the first such arrangement in the U.S. game; that arrangement ended after the 2021 season, and those two teams would be drawn against each other in 2022.

==History==
The competition dates back to 1913–1914, when it was known as the &quot;National Challenge Cup&quot;. In 1999, U.S. Soccer honored patron Lamar Hunt by changing the official title of the tournament to the &quot;Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup&quot;. The winners of the tournament were awarded the Dewar Cup, donated by Sir Thomas Dewar for the promotion of soccer in the United States in 1912, until it was retired due to poor condition in 1979. It was brought back into use by the United States Adult Soccer Association in 1997, but is now back on permanent display at the National Soccer Hall of Fame at Toyota Stadium in Frisco, Texas, and the recent winners of the tournament have been awarded a new, different trophy. Despite this, the name of each winning club is still added to the base of the original Dewar Cup.

The National Challenge Cup was the first truly national cup competition in the United States, as previous cups had been effectively relegated to regional status by the difficulties in coordination and travel caused by the size of the United States in the early 1900s. While U.S. Soccer had initially administered the competition, in 1985 they handed over management to the USASA. In 1995, U.S. Soccer resumed its administration of the competition.

Maccabee Los Angeles of California and Bethlehem Steel of Pennsylvania both won the cup a record five times, while Greek American AA of New York and Seattle Sounders FC are tied for the record for most consecutive cup victories at three. The old NASL did not participate in the Open Cup.
Since MLS&#x27; debut in 1996, MLS clubs have won the cup in all but one of those years. The Rochester Rhinos of the 2nd division A-League were surprise winners in 1999, defeating four MLS clubs, including the Colorado Rapids 2–0 in the championship match. The first professional team to win in the modern era were the Richmond Kickers of the USISL (the predecessor to the A-League, later known as the USL First Division, USL Pro, United Soccer League, and now as the USL Championship) in 1995, one year before the start of MLS. D.C. United were the first MLS team to win in 1996.

The tournament was expanded to 64 teams in 2012 with all MLS teams in the United States receiving an automatic berth; previously, MLS participants were determined through a qualifying tournament or were selected based on league standings. A rule change enacted in 2016 removed U.S. Open Cup entries for teams that were majority-owned by another team in a higher tier, which mostly affected USL Championship teams operated by MLS as reserve or developmental squads.

The first round of the 2020 edition was suspended in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The tournament was canceled entirely in August 2020, with all qualified teams automatically qualified for the following year; however, the 2021 Open Cup was canceled as well, due to schedule congestion as an effect of the pandemic. The tournament resumed in 2022 with 71 professional clubs out of a total field of 103, both modern-era records.

On December 15, 2023, Major League Soccer announced that its teams would no longer enter in the U.S. Open Cup starting in the 2024 edition, instead opting to send their MLS Next Pro teams. However, on December 20, 2023, U.S. Soccer announced that they had denied MLS the necessary waiver to allow affiliated MLS Next Pro teams to play in the tournament. A compromise announced on March 1, 2024, allowed eight MLS teams to participate with senior squads and eleven to be represented by MLS Next Pro teams; the teams participating in the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup will not send teams to the Open Cup. The eight MLS participants are defending Open Cup champions Houston Dynamo and the seven highest-ranked teams in the 2023 regular season standings who did not qualify for the Champions Cup. D.C. United will not send a representative due to their lack of a MLS Next Pro affiliate.

== Hosting ==

Through the 2010 U.S. Open Cup, U.S. Soccer used sealed bids to award home matches. From 2011, U.S. Soccer uses a simple coin toss to decide which team hosts each match for most rounds. When the draw has more than two teams involved, such as the fourth round, U.S. Soccer uses a sealed envelope system. Four envelopes are opened, the first and second are home one and two followed by away one and two. This can be modified due to teams not applying to host and previous round winners not being able to be paired against each other.

== Broadcasting ==
ESPN+ had exclusive broadcast rights for the 2019 and 2022 Open Cups. Prior to 2019, the tournament had little broadcast exposure, with the final and select matches being broadcast on ESPN networks and all other matches streamed through the USSF&#x27;s YouTube channel.

On March 1, 2022, U.S. Soccer and Turner Sports announced an 8-year exclusive multimedia rights deal for the United States men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s national teams. Cindy Parlow Cone, president of U.S. Soccer, confirmed in a separate interview that the new deal would include the Open Cup. Early round U.S. Open Cup matches will air on the Bleacher Report app and the Bleacher Report Football YouTube channel.

In 2023, CBS Sports reached an agreement to air the semifinals and final of the Cup. The semifinals aired on the CBS Sports Golazo Network, with the final on CBS Sports Network and Paramount+. In 2024, Apple TV+, via MLS Season Pass, announced an agreement to air the quarterfinals, semifinals and final of the Cup.

<text>The local churches are a Christian group which was started in China in the 1920s and have spread globally. The basic organizing principle of the local churches is that there should be only one Christian church in each city, a principle that was first articulated by Watchman Nee in a 1926 exposition of the seven churches in Asia in Revelation 1:11. The local churches do not take a name, but some outsiders referred to the group as the &quot;Little Flock&quot; as they sang from a hymnal entitled &quot;Hymns for the Little Flock&quot;.

From early on, members of this group emphasized a personal experience of Christ and the establishment of a pattern of church practice according to the New Testament. Though assemblies identifying as &quot;local churches&quot; can be found worldwide, there are no definitive statistics available on membership, partly because the largest number of members are in China. Estimates range from five hundred thousand to two million members worldwide.

==History==

===Origins===
The development of the local churches can be traced to the conversion of Watchman Nee in Fuzhou, China. Nee began to meet outside of denominations with a small group of believers in 1922. At an early age, Nee committed his life to Christian ministry and began to publish his works on the Christian faith and on church practice after moving to Shanghai in 1927.

Nee appreciated the teachings of the Plymouth Brethren, especially John Nelson Darby, and many of Nee&#x27;s teachings, including not taking a name, plural eldership, disavowal of a clergy-laity distinction, and worship centered around the Lord&#x27;s Supper, mirror that source. From 1930 to 1935, there was communication internationally between the local churches and the branch of the Plymouth Brethren Christian Church associated with James Taylor, Sr. The Taylor group of Exclusive Brethren saw the churches in China as a parallel work of God. However, Nee and other Chinese leaders disagreed with their prohibition of celebrating The Lord&#x27;s Supper with Christians outside of their own meetings. Matters came to a head when Exclusive Brethren leaders discovered that Nee had broken bread with non-Brethren Christians, including T. Austin-Sparks in London and Thornton Stearns in Hartford, during a 1933 visit to the United Kingdom and North America. After a series of letters exchanged between leaders in New York, London, and Shanghai over a two-year period, on 31 August 1935, the Exclusive Brethren in London wrote to Shanghai terminating their fellowship.

Nee&#x27;s seminal works expounding his view of local churches—&quot;The Assembly Life&quot; and &quot;Concerning Our Missions&quot;—were written against the background of his experience with the Exclusive Brethren. Nee taught that there should only be one church in every city, that Christians should meet together simply as believers living in the same city regardless of differences in doctrine or practice. Nee believed that this would eliminate divisions between Christians and provide the broadest basis upon which all believers could meet. Both Nee and Witness Lee emphasized the New Testament&#x27;s references to churches by the name of the city (for example, in Acts, the Christians in Jerusalem being referred to as &quot;the church which was at Jerusalem&quot; (NKJV), as well as other verses with the same convention, including 1 Corinthians 1:2; Revelation 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7 and 14). Since Nee and Lee taught that there should only be one church in each city, and that that city was the extent of a church&#x27;s jurisdiction, members of the local churches usually refer to their congregations as &quot;the church in (city name).&quot; According to Nee, this means that &quot;the church in her locality must be inclusive, not exclusive,” that is, it “must include all the children of God in the whole spectrum of Christian faith and practice.&quot;

Though Nee took the lead among the local churches in China, it was through one of his co-workers—Witness Lee —that the local churches spread worldwide. The two men first met in Lee&#x27;s hometown of Yantai in 1932. Two years later, Lee moved to Shanghai to work with Nee. One of Lee&#x27;s responsibilities there was the editing of some of Nee&#x27;s publications. In the following years, Nee published many works and held regular conferences and trainings for church workers. Nee, Lee and other workers established over seven hundred local churches throughout China before the Communist Revolution resulted in the establishment of the People’s Republic of China in 1949. Near the end of the Communist Revolution, Nee sent Witness Lee to Taiwan to ensure that their work would survive the political turmoil.

===Developments after 1949===
The Denunciation Movement that began in 1951 after China entered the Korean War aimed at severing Christian groups in China from foreign influence, including expelling all foreign missionaries. As a side effect of the disbanding of mission churches, the local churches experienced &quot;a spectacular rise in membership.&quot; The Denunciation Movement turned to leading Chinese Christians who would not join the Three-Self Reform Movement. Nee, who managed his family&#x27;s pharmaceutical company, was imprisoned in 1952 during the Five-Anti Campaign and died in a labor camp 20 years later. Meanwhile, the work in Taiwan led by Witness Lee had grown to more than twenty thousand members in sixty-five churches. Witness Lee visited the United States in 1958 and moved there in 1962, settling first in Los Angeles. Today there are 250 local churches in the United States with approximately 30,000 members, and local churches can be found on all six inhabited continents.
==Church meetings==
The local churches practice mutuality in their meetings based on verses such as 1 Corinthians 14:26 (&quot;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&quot;). Participants are encouraged to request hymns, make brief comments, or offer prayers or praises at will. This is particularly evident in &quot;prophesying meetings&quot; in which members speak one after another usually based on their recent learnings and experiences from their Christian walk and/or what they have studied throughout the previous week from the Bible, usually with the help of the commentary books by Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, including the periodical &quot;Holy Word for Morning Revival&quot; published by Living Stream Ministry.

==Beliefs==
The local churches believe that:
==Evaluation==
In the first decade of the 2000s, the local churches were the subject of two extensive evaluations. These evaluations were performed against the backdrop of decades of controversy (see Local Church controversies). The first was conducted by a faculty panel at Fuller Theological Seminary. After a two-year study, the Fuller panel stated, &quot;It is the conclusion of Fuller Theological Seminary that the teachings and practices of the local churches and its members represent the genuine, historical, biblical Christian faith in every essential aspect.&quot; After a six-year study, the Christian Research Institute published a 2009 special issue of their journal in December 2009 with the words &quot;We Were Wrong&quot; on the cover. In it Hank Hanegraaff, Elliot Miller, and Gretchen Passantino published their findings, which resulted in a complete reversal of earlier criticisms.

<doc id="253158" wikidata="Q584205" url="?curid=253158" title="Nontrinitarianism">
<text>Nontrinitarianism is a form of Christianity that rejects the orthodox Christian theology of the Trinity—the belief that God is three distinct hypostases or persons who are coeternal, coequal, and indivisibly united in one being, or essence (from the Ancient Greek ). Certain religious groups that emerged during the Protestant Reformation have historically been known as antitrinitarian.

According to churches that consider the decisions of ecumenical councils final, trinitarianism was definitively declared to be Christian doctrine at the 4th-century ecumenical councils, that of the First Council of Nicaea (325), which declared the full divinity of the Son, and the First Council of Constantinople (381), which declared the divinity of the Holy Spirit.

In terms of number of adherents, nontrinitarian denominations comprise a small minority of modern Christians. After the denominations in the Oneness Pentecostal movement, the largest nontrinitarian Christian denominations are the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses, , and . There are a number of other smaller groups, including Christadelphians, Church of the Blessed Hope, Christian Scientists, Dawn Bible Students, Living Church of God, Assemblies of Yahweh, Members Church of God International, Unitarian Christians, Unitarian Universalist Christians, The Way International, the Philadelphia Church of God, The Church of God International, the United Church of God, Church of God General Conference, Restored Church of God, Christian Disciples Church, and Church of God of the Faith of Abraham.

Nontrinitarian views differ widely on the nature of God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit. Various nontrinitarian philosophies, such as adoptionism and monarchianism, existed prior to the codification of the Trinity doctrine in AD 325, 381, and 431, at the Councils of Nicaea, Constantinople, and Ephesus. Nontrinitarianism was later renewed by Cathars in the 11th through 13th centuries, in the Unitarian movement during the Protestant Reformation, in the Age of Enlightenment of the 18thcentury, and in some groups arising during the Second Great Awakening of the 19thcentury.

The doctrine of the Trinity, as held in mainstream Christianity, is not present in the other major monotheistic Abrahamic religions.

==Beliefs==

Christian apologists and other Church Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, having adopted and formulated the Logos Christology, considered the Son of God as the instrument used by the supreme God, the Father, to bring the creation into existence. Justin Martyr, Theophilus of Antioch, Hippolytus of Rome and Tertullian in particular state that the internal Logos of God (Gr. &quot;Logos endiathetos&quot;, Lat. )—his impersonal divine reason—was begotten as Logos uttered (Gr. &quot;Logos prophorikos&quot;, Lat. ), the Word personified, becoming an actual person to be used for the purpose of creation.

The &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; (11th edition) states: &quot;to some Christians the doctrine of the Trinity appeared inconsistent with the unity of God. ... they therefore denied it, and accepted Jesus Christ, not as incarnate God, but as God&#x27;s highest creature by whom all else was created. ... [this] view in the early Church long contended with the orthodox doctrine.&quot; Although the Trinitarian view became the orthodox doctrine in mainstream Christianity, variations of the nontrinitarian view are still held by a relatively small number of Christian groups and denominations.

Various views exist regarding the relationships between the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
* Those who believe that Jesus is not Almighty God, nor absolutely equal to God, and not the co-eternal or co-equal with Father in everything, but was either God&#x27;s subordinate Son and Servant, the highest Angel and Son of God that eventually became a perfect Man, God&#x27;s true firstborn before ages, a perfect messenger sent from God, the greatest prophet of Israel, and the Jewish Messiah, or the perfect created human:
** Adoptionism (2nd century AD) holds that Jesus became divine at his baptism (sometimes associated with the Gospel of Mark) or at his resurrection (sometimes associated with Saint Paul and Shepherd of Hermas);
** Arianism – Arius (AD c.250 or 256–336) believed that the pre-existent Son of God was directly created by the Father, before all ages, and that he was subordinate to God the Father. Arius&#x27; position was that the Son was brought forth as the very first of God&#x27;s creations, and that the Father later created all things through the Son. Arius taught that in the creation of the universe, the Father was the ultimate creator, supplying all the materials and directing the design, while the Son worked the materials, making all things at the bidding and in the service of God, by which &quot;through [Christ] all things came into existence&quot;. Arianism became the dominant view in some regions in the time of the Roman Empire, notably the Visigoths until 589. The Third Council of Sirmium in 357 was the high point of Arianism. The Seventh Arian Confession (Second Sirmium Confession) held that both &quot;homoousios&quot; (of one substance) and &quot;homoiousios&quot; (of similar substance) were unbiblical and that the Father is greater than the Son in all things, and that the Father alone is infinite and eternal, and that the Logos is God&#x27;s true firstborn and subservient Son who was made perfect flesh for our sakes and for the glory of the Father (this confession was later known as the Blasphemy of Sirmium): &quot;But since many persons are disturbed by questions concerning what is called in Latin &quot;substantia&quot;, but in Greek &quot;ousia&quot;, that is, to make it understood more exactly, as to &#x27;coessential,&#x27; or what is called, &#x27;like-in-essence,&#x27; there ought to be no mention of any of these at all, nor exposition of them in the Church, for this reason and for this consideration, that in divine Scripture nothing is written about them, and that they are above men&#x27;s knowledge and above men&#x27;s understanding&quot;;
** Psilanthropism – Ebionites (1st to 4th centuries AD) observed Jewish law, denied the literal virgin birth and regarded Jesus as the Jewish Messiah and the greatest prophet of God only;
** Socinianism – Photinus taught that Jesus was the sinless Messiah and redeemer, and the only perfect human son of God, but that he had no pre-human existence. They interpret verses such as John 1:1 to refer to God&#x27;s &quot;plan&quot; existing in God&#x27;s mind before Christ&#x27;s birth, and that it was God&#x27;s plan that &quot;became flesh&quot;, as the perfect man Jesus;
** Unitarianism views Jesus as the son of God, subordinate and distinct from his Father;
** Many Gnostic traditions held that the Christ is a heavenly Aeon but not one with the Father.
* Those who believe that the Father, the resurrected Son and the Holy Spirit are different aspects of one God, as perceived by the believer, rather than three distinct persons:
** Modalism – Sabellius (fl. c.215) stated that God took numerous forms in both the Hebrew and the Christian Greek Scriptures, and that God has manifested himself in three primary &quot;modes&quot; regarding the salvation of mankind. He contended that &quot;Father, Son, and Spirit&quot; were different roles played by the same divine person in various circumstances in history; thus God is Father in creation (God created a Son through the virgin birth), Son in redemption (God manifested himself as Jesus for the purpose of his death upon the cross), and Holy Spirit in regeneration (God&#x27;s Spirit within the Son and within the souls of Christian believers). In this view, God is not three distinct persons, but rather one person manifesting himself in multiple ways. Trinitarians condemn this view as a heresy. The chief critic of Sabellianism was Tertullian, who labeled the movement &quot;Patripassianism&quot;, from the Latin words &quot;pater&quot; for &quot;father&quot;, and &quot;passus&quot; from the verb &quot;to suffer&quot;, because it implied that the Father suffered on the cross. It was coined by Tertullian in his work &quot;Adversus Praxeas&quot;, ChapterI: &quot;By this Praxeas did a twofold service for the devil at Rome: he drove away prophecy, and he brought in heresy; he put to flight the Paraclete, and he crucified the Father.&quot; The term homoousion (&quot;&quot;, literally &quot;same being&quot;) later adopted by the Trinitarian Nicene Council for its anti-Arian creed had previously been used by Sabellians.
* Those who believe that Jesus Christ is Almighty God, but that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are actually three distinct almighty &quot;Gods&quot; with distinct natures, acting as one divine group, united in purpose:
** Tri-theism – John Philoponus, an Aristotelian and monophysite in Alexandria, in the middle of the 6th century, saw in the Trinity three separate natures, substances, and deities, according to the number of divine persons. He sought to justify this view by the Aristotelian categories of &quot;genus&quot;, &quot;species&quot; and &quot;individuum&quot;. In the Middle Ages, Roscellin of Compiegne, the founder of Nominalism, argued for three distinct almighty Gods, with three distinct natures, who were one in mind and purpose, existing together eternally, interacting together from times past, in perfect cooperation, acting together as one divine group or godhead over the universe, in creation and redemption. And that the Logos took on a subservient role, but was equal in power and eternity with the One called Father. Roscellin said, though, like Philoponus, that unless the three persons are &quot;tres res&quot; (three things with distinct natures), the whole Trinity must have been incarnate. And therefore, since only the Logos was made flesh, the other two persons must have had distinct &quot;natures&quot;, separate from the Logos, and so had to be separate and distinct Gods, though all three were one in divine work and plan and operation. In this view, they would be considered &quot;three Gods in one Godhead&quot;. This notion was condemned by St. Anselm.
* Those who believe that the Holy Spirit is not a person:
** Binitarianism – Adherents include those people through history who believed that God is only two co-equal and co-eternal persons, the Father and the Word, not three. They taught that the Holy Spirit is not a distinct person, but is the power or divine influence of the Father and Son, emanating out to the universe, in creation, and to believers;
** Dualism;
** Marcionism – Marcion (AD c.110160) believed there were two deities, one of creation and judgment (in the Hebrew Bible) and one of redemption and mercy (in the New Testament).

===Modern Christian groups===
* Christadelphians hold the unitarian belief that although Jesus is the Son of God, this is only a relational title toward the Father who alone is truly God. Christ&#x27;s personhood, therefore, is human, not divine, (believing this to be necessary in order to save humans from their sins). The &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; terminology in the Bible is interpreted as referring to God&#x27;s impersonal power, or God&#x27;s character/mind (depending on the context).
* Church of God General Conference (Abrahamic Faith).
* The Cooneyites is a Christian sect that split from the Two by Twos in 1928 following Edward Cooney&#x27;s excommunication from the main group; they deny the Living Witness Doctrine.
* (Tagalog for &quot;Church of Christ&quot;) views Jesus as human but endowed by God with attributes not found in ordinary humans, though lacking attributes found in God. They contend that it is God&#x27;s will to worship Jesus. INC rejects the Trinity as heresy, adopting a version of unitarianism.
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses (and other Bible Student movement groups such as the Associated Bible Students) teach that God the Father is uniquely Almighty God. They believe that Jesus is God&#x27;s first and only direct creation, and that God is greater than Jesus. They contrast worship of God with relative &quot;obeisance&quot; (in the sense of &quot;homage&quot;, as to a king) to Jesus, and consider Jesus to be God&#x27;s high priest and mediator for imperfect humans. They believe that Jesus is Michael the archangel and the &quot;Angel of the Lord&quot; of Exodus, and that he left heaven to be born as a perfect human, and then resumed his pre-human identity in heaven, but exalted to God&#x27;s right hand. They do not believe that the Holy Spirit is an actual person, but consider it to be God&#x27;s divine active force. 
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church) teaches that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit are distinct beings that are not united in substance, a view sometimes called social trinitarianism. They believe the three individual deities are &quot;one&quot; in will or purpose, as Jesus was &quot;one&quot; with his disciples, and that the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit constitute a single godhead united in purpose. Latter-day Saints believe that Christ is the Firstborn of the Father, that he is subordinate to God the Father (Matthew 26:39), and that Christ created the universe. Latter-day Saints do not subscribe to the ideas that Christ was unlike the Father in substance and that the Father could not appear on earth, or that Christ was adopted by the Father, as presented in Arianism. Latter-day Saints assert that both God and the resurrected Christ have perfected glorified, physical bodies, but do not otherwise classify deity in terms of substance. While Latter-day Saints regard God the Father as the supreme being and literal father of the spirits of all humankind, they also teach that Christ and the Holy Spirit are equally divine and that they share in the Father&#x27;s &quot;comprehension of all things&quot;.
* The Members Church of God International believes in the divinity of Christ but rejects the doctrine of Trinity. 
* Oneness Pentecostalism is a subset of Pentecostalism that believes God is only one person, and that he manifests himself in different ways, faces, or &quot;modes&quot;: &quot;Father, Son, and Holy Spirit (or Holy Ghost) are different designations for the one God. God is the Father. God is the Holy Spirit. The Son is God manifest in flesh. The term Son always refers to the Incarnation, and never to deity apart from humanity.&quot; Oneness Pentecostals believe that Jesus was &quot;Son&quot; only when he became flesh on earth, but was the Father prior to being made human. They refer to the Father as the &quot;Spirit&quot; and the Son as the &quot;Flesh&quot;. Oneness Pentecostals reject the Trinity doctrine, viewing it as pagan and unscriptural, and hold to the Jesus&#x27; Name doctrine with respect to baptisms. Oneness Pentecostals are often referred to as &quot;Modalists&quot; or &quot;Sabellians&quot; or &quot;Jesus Only&quot;.
* Denominations within the Sabbatarian tradition (Armstrongism) believe that Christ the Son and God the Father are co-eternal, but do not teach that the Holy Spirit is a being or person. Armstrong theology holds that God is a &quot;Family&quot; that expands eventually, that &quot;God reproduces Himself&quot;, but that originally there was a co-eternal &quot;Duality&quot;, God and the Word, rather than a &quot;Trinity&quot;.
* Swedenborgianism holds that the Trinity exists in one person, the Lord God Jesus Christ. The Father, the being or soul of God, was born into the world and put on a body from Mary. Throughout his life, Jesus put away all human desires and tendencies until he was completely divine. After his resurrection, he influences the world through the Holy Spirit, which is his activity. In this view, Jesus Christ is the one God; the Father as to his soul, the Son as to his body, and the Holy Spirit as to his activity in the world. This view is very similar in many ways to Sabellianism, Modalism, Oneness, or Jesus Only beliefs.
* Numerous Unitarian Christian organizations exist around the world, the oldest of which is the Unitarian Church of Transylvania. An umbrella organization for these groups is the International Council of Unitarians and Universalists, though only some members and affiliates of that body consider themselves exclusively or predominantly Christian. In the United States, &quot;Unitarian&quot; often refers to members and congregations within the Unitarian Universalist Association (UUA), a non-Christian group formed in 1961 from the merger of the American Unitarian Association with the Universalist Church of America. Though both of these predecessor groups were originally Christian, the UUA does not have a shared creed and does not identify as a Christian Unitarian organization.

==History==

===Early Christianity===
Although nontrinitarian beliefs continued and were dominant among some peoples—for example, the Lombards, Ostrogoths, Visigoths and Vandals—for hundreds of years, the Trinity doctrine eventually gained prominence in the Roman Empire. Nontrinitarians typically argue that early nontrinitarian beliefs, such as Arianism, were systematically suppressed (often to the point of death). After the First Council of Nicaea, Roman Emperor Constantine I issued an edict against Arius&#x27; writings, which included systematic book burning. In spite of the decree, Constantine ordered the readmission of Arius to the church, removed the bishops (including Athanasius) who upheld the teaching of Nicaea, allowed Arianism to grow within the Empire and to spread to Germanic tribes on the frontier, and was himself baptized by an Arian bishop, Eusebius of Nicomedia. His successors as Christian emperors promoted Arianism, until Theodosius I came to the throne in 379 and supported Nicene Christianity.

The Easter letter that Athanasius issued in 367, when the Eastern Empire was ruled by the Arian Emperor Valens, specified the books that belong to the Old Testament and the New Testament, together with seven other books to be read &quot;for instruction in the word of godliness&quot;; it also excluded what Athanasius called apocryphal writings, falsely presented as ancient. Elaine Pagels writes: &quot;In AD 367, Athanasius, the zealous bishop of Alexandria... issued an Easter letter in which he demanded that Egyptian monks destroy all such unacceptable writings, except for those he specifically listed as &#x27;acceptable&#x27; even &#x27;canonical&#x27;—a list that constitutes the present &#x27;New Testament&#x27;&quot;.

Nontrinitarians see the Nicene Creed and the results of the Council of Chalcedon as essentially political documents, resulting from the subordination of true doctrine to state interests by leaders of the Catholic Church, so that the church became, in their view, an extension of the Roman Empire. Nontrinitarians (both Modalists and Unitarians) assert that Athanasius and others at Nicaea adopted Greek Platonic philosophy and concepts, and incorporated them in their views of God and Christ.

The author H. G. Wells, later famous for his contribution to science-fiction, wrote in The Outline of History: &quot;We shall see presently how later on all Christendom was torn by disputes about the Trinity. There is no evidence that the apostles of Jesus ever heard of the Trinity, at any rate from him.&quot;

The question of why such a central doctrine to the Christian faith would never have been explicitly stated in scripture or taught in detail by Jesus himself was sufficiently important to 16th century historical figures such as Michael Servetus to lead them to argue the question. The Geneva City Council, in accord with the judgment of the cantons of Zürich, Bern, Basel, and Schaffhausen, condemned Servetus to be burned at the stake for this and his opposition to infant baptism.

The &quot;Encyclopædia of Religion and Ethics&quot; describes the five stages that led to the formulation of the doctrine of the Trinity:
# The acceptance of the pre-human existence of Jesus as the (middle-platonic) Logos, namely, as the medium between the transcendent sovereign God and the created cosmos. The doctrine of Logos was accepted by the Apologists and by other Fathers of the 2nd and 3rd centuries, such as Justin the Martyr, Hippolytus, Tertullian, Ireneus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Lactantius, and in the 4th century by Arius;
# The doctrine of the timeless generation of the Son from the Father as it was articulated by Origen in his effort to support the ontological immutability of God, that he is ever-being a father and a creator. The doctrine of the timeless generation was adopted by Athanasius of Alexandria;
# The acceptance of the idea that the son of God is of the same transcendent nature (&quot;homoousios&quot;) as his father. This position was declared in the Nicene Creed, which specifically states the son of God is as immutable as his father;
# The acceptance that the Holy Spirit also has ontological equality as a third person in a divine Trinity and the final Trinitarian terminology by the teachings of the Cappadocian Fathers;
# The addition of the Filioque to the Nicene Creed, as accepted by the Roman Catholic Church.

===Following the Reformation===

By 1530, following the Protestant Reformation, and the German Peasants&#x27; War of 1524–1525, large areas of Northern Europe were Protestant, and forms of nontrinitarianism began to surface among some &quot;Radical Reformation&quot; groups, particularly Anabaptists. The first recorded English antitrinitarian was John Assheton (1548), an Anglican priest. The Italian Anabaptist &quot;Council of Venice&quot; (1550) and the trial of Michael Servetus (1553) marked the clear emergence of markedly antitrinitarian Protestants. Though the only organised nontrinitarian churches were the Polish Brethren who split from the Calvinists (1565, expelled from Poland 1658), and the Unitarian Church of Transylvania (founded 1568). 

In 1733, Voltaire&#x27;s Letters on the English listed Isaac Newton as a member of Antitrinitarians.

Nonconformists, Dissenters and Latitudinarians in Britain were often Arians or Unitarians, and the Doctrine of the Trinity Act 1813 allowed nontrinitarian worship in Britain. In America, Arian and Unitarian views were also found among some Millennialist and Adventist groups, though the Unitarian Church itself began to decline in numbers and influence after the 1870s.

==Points of dissent==
Nontrinitarian Christians with Arian or Semi-Arian views contend that the weight of scriptural evidence supports Subordinationism, the Son&#x27;s total submission to the Father, and God&#x27;s paternal supremacy over the Son in every aspect. They acknowledge the Son&#x27;s high rank at God&#x27;s right hand, but teach that the Father is still greater than the Son in all things.

While acknowledging that the Father, Son, and Spirit are essential in creation and salvation, they argue that that in itself does not confirm that the three are each co-equal or co-eternal. They also affirm that God is only explicitly identified as &quot;one&quot; in the Bible, and that the doctrine of the Trinity, which word literally meaning &quot;a set of three&quot;, ascribes a co-equal threeness to the being of the infinite God that is not explicitly scriptural.

===Scriptural support===

Critics of the Trinity doctrine argue that, for a teaching described as fundamental, it lacks direct scriptural support. Proponents of the doctrine assert that although the doctrine is not stated directly in the New Testament, it is instead an interpretation of elements contained therein that imply the doctrine that was later formulated in the 4th century.

William Barclay, a Church of Scotland minister, stated that:

The &quot;New Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; states:

Similarly, &quot;Encyclopedia Encarta&quot; states:

&quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; says:

The &quot;Anchor Bible Dictionary&quot; states:

Catholic historian Joseph F. Kelly, speaking of legitimate theological development, writes:

=== Questions about co-equal deity of Jesus ===
American Catholic priest and Trinitarian, R.E. Brown (1928–1988), wrote a journal article that sorted relevant biblical verses into three classes. He described the following block as &quot;texts that seem to imply that the title &#x27;God&#x27; was not used for Jesus&quot; and are &quot;negative evidence which is often somewhat neglected in Catholic treatments of the subject&quot;:
* , , , , , , , , , , , , , , , and ;
he lists these as &quot;texts where, by reason of textual variants or syntax, the use of &#x27;God&#x27; for Jesus is dubious&quot;:
* , Acts 20:28, , , , , , and ;
and only finds the following three as &quot;texts where clearly Jesus is called God&quot;:
* , John 1:1, and John 20:28.

The Septuagint translate (Elohim) as θεος (Theos). At Deuteronomy 6:4 (the &quot;Shema Yisrael&quot;, quoted by Jesus at ), the plural form of the Hebrew word &quot;God&quot; (&quot;Elohim&quot;) is used, generally understood to denote majesty, excellence, and the superlative. It has been stated that in the original Greek in Mark 12:29, there are no &quot;plural modifiers&quot; in that Greek word there for &quot;one&quot; (&quot;heis&quot;), but that in Mark 12 it is simply a masculine singular &quot;one&quot;. And that because of that, there is no valid reason to believe that the Hebrew word for &quot;one&quot; in Deuteronomy 6 (&quot;echad&quot;) was necessarily a &quot;plural one&quot;, rather than just simply numerical &quot;one&quot;. At Deuteronomy 6:4, the Tetragrammaton appears twice in this verse, leading Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses and certain Jewish scholars to conclude that belief in a singular (and therefore indivisible) supremely powerful God is essential to the &quot;Shema&quot;.

==== Matthew 26:39 ====
In Jesus prays with a distinction between God and himself, &quot;O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me: nevertheless not as I will, but as thou wilt.&quot;.

==== John 1:1 ====
In John 1:1 there is a distinction between God and the Logos. Non-trinitarians claim a mistranslation of the second part of John 1:1 which, when literally translated word-for-word reads &quot;and the word [logos] was with the God [ho theos].&quot; Trinitarians contend that the third part of the verse (John 1:1c) translates as &quot;and the Word was God&quot;, pointing to a distinction as subjects between God and the Logos but an equivalence in nature. Some nontrinitarians assert that the Koine Greek (&quot;kai theos ên ho logos&quot;) should be translated as &quot;and a God was the Word&quot; (or &quot;and the Word was a god&quot;). Based on their contention that the article of &quot;theos&quot; is , lacking a definite article, they believe the verse refers to Jesus&#x27; pre-human existence as &quot;a god&quot; or a divine one as distinct from &quot;the God&quot;. Nontrinitarians also contend that the author of John&#x27;s gospel could have written &quot;kai ho theos ên ho logos&quot; (&quot;and the Word was the God&quot;) if that were his intended meaning.

==== John 10:30 ====
 – Nontrinitarians such as Arians believe that when Jesus said, &quot;I and the Father are one,&quot; he did not mean that they were actually &quot;one substance&quot;, or &quot;one God&quot;, or co-equal and co-eternal, but rather that he and the Father have a &quot;unity of purpose&quot;, and that the context indicates that Jesus was saying that they were &quot;one&quot; in &quot;pastoral work&quot;. The point being that the Father and the Son were united in the divine work of saving the &#x27;sheep&#x27;. Nontrinitarian Christians also cite , wherein Jesus prayed regarding his disciples: &quot;That they may all be one, as you, Father, are in me, and I in you, that they may be in us,&quot; adding &quot;that they may be one even as we are one&quot;. They argue that the same Greek word (&quot;hen&quot;) for &quot;one&quot; throughout John 17 indicates that Jesus did not expect for his followers to literally become a single Being, or &quot;one in substance&quot;, with each other, or with God, and therefore that Jesus also did not expect his hearers to think that he and God the Father were one entity either.

==== John 10:33 ====
While Trinitarians often use John 10:33 as proof for the divinity of Jesus, unitarian critics argue that the Pharisees accusing Jesus of making himself God shouldn&#x27;t be the center of attention, when reading this passage. Instead, they emphasize that Jesus&#x27; response to the accusations in John 10:34-36 is of much greater concern. The argument being that Christ&#x27;s point there is that if the Scriptures, which can&#x27;t be broken, referred to even imperfect Jewish judges and kings as &quot;gods&quot;, in a positive sense, why shouldn&#x27;t the Messiah also, at least in some sense, who is much greater? In fact, Christ there doesn&#x27;t even directly necessarily claim to be &quot;God&quot; in the sense that the Father is, but instead claims to be the Son of God and makes a direct reference to Psalms 82:6 in which God calls his children &quot;gods&quot; without necessarily taking away from the Father&#x27;s own glory.

==== John 20:28–29 ====
John 20:28–29 – &quot;And Thomas answered and said to Him, &quot;My Lord and my God!&quot; Jesus said to him, &quot;Thomas, because you have seen Me, you have believed. Blessed are those who have not seen and yet have believed&quot;&quot;. Since Thomas called Jesus &quot;God&quot;, Jesus&#x27;s statement appears to endorse Thomas&#x27;s assertion. Nontrinitarians sometimes respond that it is plausible that Thomas is addressing the Lord Jesus and then the Father. Another possible answer is that Jesus himself said, &quot;Is it not written in your law, I said, Ye are gods?&quot; () referring to Psalm 82:6–8. The word &quot;gods&quot; in verse6 and &quot;God&quot; in verse8 is the same Hebrew word &quot;&#x27;elohim&quot;, which means, &quot;gods in the ordinary sense; but specifically used (in the plural thus, especially with the article) of the supreme God; occasionally applied by way of deference to magistrates; and sometimes as a superlative&quot;, and can also refer to powers and potentates, in general, or as &quot;God, god, gods, rulers, judges or angels&quot;, and as &quot;divine ones, goddess, godlike one&quot;. Therefore, the point being that Jesus was a power or mighty one to the Apostles, and that Jesus was made &quot;God&quot; by the Father&#x27;s permission and power, giving Jesus all authority as the risen Son of God, and as the resurrected Messiah, and as the perfect reflection of God the Father. But knowing from Christ&#x27;s other words, that He was still in submission to His Father.

==== 2 Corinthians 13:14 ====
2 Corinthians 13:14 – &quot;The Grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the sharing in the Holy Spirit be with all of you.&quot; It is argued by Trinitarians that the appearance of &quot;Father, Son, and Spirit&quot; together in Paul&#x27;s prayer for Grace on all believers, and are considered essential for salvation, that the verse is consistent with a triune godhead. Nontrinitarians such as Arians reply that they do not disagree that all three are necessary for salvation and grace, but argue that the passage does not explicitly say that all three are co-equal or co-eternal.

==== Philippians 2:5–6 ====
Philippians 2:5–6 – &quot;Have this mind among yourselves, which is yours in Christ Jesus, [or &quot;which was also in Christ Jesus&quot;,] who, though he was in the form of God, did not count equality with God a thing to be grasped&quot; (ESV). The word translated in the English Standard Version as &quot;a thing to be grasped&quot; is ἁρπαγμόν. Other translations of the word are indicated in the Holman Christian Standard Bible: &quot;Make your own attitude that of Christ Jesus, who, existing in the form of God, did not consider equality with God as something to be used for His own advantage&quot; [or &quot;to be grasped&quot;, or &quot;to be held on to&quot;]. The King James Version has: &quot;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus: Who, being in the form of God, thought it not robbery to be equal with God.&quot; Nontrinitarians make the argument that the passage is simply saying that Christ did not consider equality with God something graspable, and that better English translations make it clearer. Another point is that the original Greek had no definite article for &quot;form of God&quot;, which would mean &quot;a form of divinity&quot;, and also that the term &quot;morphe&quot; for &quot;form&quot; in Koine Greek would simply mean a general external quality or station, but not necessarily the absolute thing itself, and therefore they argue that the passage does not explicitly teach either co-equality, co-eternity, or consubstantiality.

==== Hebrews 9:14 ====
 – &quot;How much more will the Blood of Christ, who through an eternal Spirit, offered himself without blemish to God, cleanse our consciences from dead works, that we may render sacred service to the living God?&quot; Most nontrinitarians agree that the Holy Spirit had no beginning, but believe it is not an actual person. Nontrinitarians contend that it is obvious that God the Father in the passage is the One who is ultimately reached, and therefore is greater than the other two entities, and that a &quot;co-equal trinity&quot; is not explicitly taught in the passage, but only inferred.

===Terminology===

&quot;The term &#x27;Trinity&#x27; is not in the Bible&quot;, and some nontrinitarians use this as an argument to state that the doctrine of the Trinity relies on non-biblical terminology, and that the number three is never clearly associated with God necessarily, other than within the Comma Johanneum which is of spurious or disputed authenticity. They argue that the only number clearly unambiguously ascribed to God in the Bible is one, and that the Trinity, literally meaning three-in-one, ascribes a co-equal threeness to God that is not explicitly biblical.

Nontrinitarians cite other examples of terms or phrases not found in the Bible; multiple &quot;persons&quot; in relation to God, the terms &quot;God the Son&quot;, &quot;God-Man&quot;, &quot;God the Holy Spirit&quot;, &quot;eternal Son&quot;, and &quot;eternally begotten&quot;. While the Trinitarian term hypostasis is found in the Bible, it is used only once in reference to God where it states that Jesus is the express image of God&#x27;s person. The Bible does not explicitly use the term in relation to the Holy Spirit nor explicitly mentions the Son having a distinct hypostasis from the Father.

The First Council of Nicaea included in its Creed the major term &quot;homoousios&quot; (of the same essence), which was used also by the Council of Chalcedon to speak of a double consubstantiality of Christ, &quot;consubstantial with the Father as touching his Godhead, and consubstantial with us as touching his manhood&quot;. Nontrinitarians accept what Pier Franco Beatrice wrote: &quot;The main thesis of this paper is that &quot;homoousios&quot; came straight from Constantine&#x27;s Hermetic background. ... The Plato recalled by Constantine is just a name used to cover precisely the Egyptian and Hermetic theology of the &quot;consubstantiality&quot; of the Logos-Son with the Nous-Father, having recourse to a traditional apologetic argument. In the years of the outbreak of the Arian controversy, Lactantius might have played a decisive role in influencing Constantine&#x27;s Hermetic interpretation of Plato&#x27;s theology and consequently the emperor&#x27;s decision to insert &quot;homoousios&quot; in the Creed of Nicaea.&quot;

Trinitarians see the absence of the actual word &quot;Trinity&quot; and other Trinity-related terms in the Bible as no more significant than the absence in the Bible of the words &quot;monotheism&quot;, &quot;omnipotence&quot;, &quot;oneness&quot;, &quot;Pentecostal&quot;, &quot;apostolic&quot;, &quot;incarnation&quot; and even &quot;Bible&quot; itself. They maintain that, &#x27;while the word &quot;Trinity&quot; is not in the Bible, the substance or drift of the doctrine is definitely biblical, if not explicitly than at least implicitly.&#x27;

===Holy Spirit===
Nontrinitarian views about the Holy Spirit differ from mainstream Christian doctrine and generally fall into several distinct categories. Most scriptures traditionally used in support of the Trinity refer to the Father and the Son, but not to the Holy Spirit.

====Unitarian====
Groups with Unitarian theology such as Polish Socinians, the 18th–19th-century Unitarian Church and Christadelphians consider the Holy Spirit to be an aspect of God&#x27;s power rather than a person. Christadelphians believe that the phrase &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; refers to God&#x27;s power or character, depending on the context. Similarly, Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses believe that the Holy Spirit is not an actual person but is God&#x27;s &quot;active force&quot; that he uses to accomplish his will.

==== Binitarianism ====
Groups with Binitarian theology, such as Armstrongites, believe that the Logos and God the Father are co-equal and co-eternal, but they do not believe that the Holy Spirit is an actual person, like the Father and the Son. They believe the Holy Spirit is the Power, Mind, or Character of God, depending on the context. They teach, &quot;The Holy Spirit is the very essence, the mind, life and power of God. It is not a Being. The Spirit is inherent in the Father and the Son, and emanates from Them throughout the entire universe.&quot;

====Modalist groups====
Oneness Pentecostalism, as with other modalist groups, teach that the Holy Spirit is a &quot;mode&quot; of God, rather than a distinct or separate person in the godhead, and that the Holy Spirit is another name for God the Father. According to Oneness theology, the Holy Spirit is the Father operating in a certain capacity or manifestation. The United Pentecostal Church teaches that there is no personal distinction between God the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The two titles &quot;Father&quot; and &quot;Holy Spirit&quot; (as well as others) are said to not reflect separate &quot;persons&quot; within the Godhead, but rather two different ways in which the one God reveals himself to his creatures. The Oneness view of Bible verses that mention God and his Spirit (e.g. Isaiah 48:16) is that they do not imply two &quot;persons&quot; any more than various scriptural references to a man and his spirit or soul (such as in Luke 12:19) imply two &quot;persons&quot; existing within one body.

====Latter-day Saint movement====
In the LDS Church, the Holy Ghost (usually synonymous with Holy Spirit) is considered to be the third distinct member of the Godhead (Father, Son and Holy Ghost), and to have a body of &quot;spirit&quot;, which makes him unlike the Father and the Son who are said to have bodies &quot;as tangible as man&#x27;s&quot;. According to LDS doctrine, the Holy Spirit is believed to be a person, with a body of spirit, able to pervade all worlds.

Latter-day Saints believe that the Father, the Son, and the Holy Ghost are part of the Godhead, but that the Father is greater than the Son, and that the Son is greater than the Holy Spirit in position and authority, but not in nature (i.e., they equally share the &quot;God&quot; nature). They teach that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three ontologically separate, self-aware entities who share a common &quot;God&quot; nature distinct from our &quot;human&quot; nature, who are &quot;One God&quot; in the sense of being united (in the same sense that a husband and wife are said to be &quot;one&quot;), similar to Social trinitarianism.

A number of Latter Day Saint sects, most notably the Community of Christ (the second largest Latter Day Saint denomination), the Church of Christ (Temple Lot), and derived groups, follow a traditional Protestant trinitarian theology.

====Other groups====
The Unity Church interprets the religious terms Father, Son, and Holy Spirit metaphysically, as three aspects of mind action: mind, idea, and expression. They believe this is the process through which all manifestation takes place.

Groups in the Rastafari movement generally state that it is Haile Selassie who embodies both God the Father and God the Son, while the Holy (or &quot;&quot;Hola&quot;) Spirit is to be found within every human being. Rastas also say that the true church is the human body, and that it is this church (or &quot;structure&quot;&quot;) that contains the Holy Spirit.

==Relationship with mainstream Christianity==

As the Nicene Creed&#x27;s declaration of the Trinity is held as the foundational belief for mainstream Christians, nontrinitarian sects may be regarded as cults or heresies by other Christians, or accused of not being Christians at all. On the other hand, nontrinitarians may see mainstream Christians as having fallen or apostasized from the original Christian church.

===Ecumenism===
Ecumenism is a type of interfaith dialogue within Christianity based on shared essential, core beliefs. Ecumenism is usually built on the basis of shared belief in trinitarian baptism, which by definition excludes nontrinitarians. This makes it especially difficult for trinitarian and nontrinitarian churches to recognize the other side&#x27;s baptisms and communions, or for them to worship together. However, unity of action on shared community goals is easier to accomplish. 

===Heresy and apostasy===
Orthodoxy sets certain beliefs as correct, by tradition. Beliefs not within those guidelines be designated heterodox or heretical. Many nontrinitarians believe that the traditions of mainstream Christianity itself are incorrect, in a Great Apostasy foretold by Paul.

The Catholic Church has specifically designated many varieties of nontrinitarianism &quot;heresies&quot;, including Arianism, Modalism, and Tritheism. They have also specifically named Mormonism and Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses as heresies (as well as Protestantism and Calvinism).

Fundamentalist or evangelical Protestantism has also targeted some nontrinitarians as part of the Christian countercult movement. However, more cautious authors argue that strange beliefs alone are not enough to designate a &quot;cult&quot;; the group&#x27;s behavior is a more important factor.

===Specific groups&#x27; relationships with Nicene Christianity===
====Pentecostalism====
Pentecostalism has a peculiar relationship with ecumenism. There is a theological division between Oneness and trinitarian Pentecostals, and ecumenical groups within Pentecostalism tend to follow those lines. However, many Pentecostals think of ecumenism less as a need for a formal, cooperative institution between groups, and more as a spiritual experience. In addition, many Pentecostal believers are insufficiently focused on abstract theology to identify as trinitarian or nontrinitarian. 

====Mormonism====

Mormonism, particularly its largest sect, the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, has a complex relationship with mainstream Christianity, due in part to its nontrinitarianism. It also has other unusual doctrines, which lead many evangelical Christians to challenge its inclusion within Christianity.

Mormonism&#x27;s second-largest sect, the Community of Christ, is a trinitarian group and participates in a variety of ecumenical organizations, such as the National Council of Churches of Christ.

==Inter-religious dialogue beyond Christianity==

The Trinity doctrine is integral in inter-religious disagreements with the other two main Abrahamic religions, Judaism and Islam; the former rejects Jesus&#x27; divine mission entirely, and the latter accepts Jesus as a human prophet and the Messiah but not as the son of God, although accepting virgin birth. The rejection of the Trinity doctrine has led to comparisons between nontrinitarian theology and Judaism and Islam.

In an 1897 article in the &quot;Jewish Quarterly Review&quot;, Montefiore describes Unitarianism as a bridge between Judaism and mainstream Christianity, calling it both a &quot;phase of Judaism&quot; and a &quot;phase of Christianity&quot;.

In Islam, the concept of a co-equal trinity is totally rejected, with Quranic verses calling the doctrine of the Trinity blasphemous. Early Islam was originally seen as a variant of Arianism, a heresy in Orthodox and Catholic Christianity, by the Byzantine emperor in the 600s. In the 700s, many Arians in Spain considered Muhammad a prophet. In the mid-1500s, many Socinian unitarians were suspected of having Islamic leanings. Socinians praised Islam, though considering the Qur&#x27;an to contain errors, for its belief in the unity of God. Bilal Cleland claimed that &quot;an anonymous writer&quot; in &quot;A Letter of Resolution concerning the Doctrine of the Trinity and Incarnation&quot; (1693) states that Islam&#x27;s greater number of adherents and military supremacy resulted from more closely maintaining correct doctrine than mainstream Christianity.

==Arguments for the pagan origins of the Trinity==


Some nontrinitarians also say that a link between the doctrine of the Trinity and the Egyptian Christian theologians of Alexandria suggests that Alexandrian theology, with its strong emphasis on the deity of Jesus, served to infuse Egypt&#x27;s pagan religious heritage into Christianity. They accuse the Church of adopting these Egyptian tenets after adapting them to Christian thinking by means of Greek philosophy.

They say the development of the idea of a co-equal triune godhead was based on pagan Greek and Platonic influence, including many basic concepts from Aristotelian philosophy incorporated into the biblical God. As an example, they mention that Aristotle stated: &quot;All things are three, and thrice is all: and let us use this number in the worship of the gods; for, as Pythagoreans say, everything and all things are bound by threes, for the end, the middle, and the beginning have this number in everything, and these compose the number of the Trinity.&quot; However, Trinitarians have argued that the words attributed to Aristotle differ in a number of ways from what has been published as the philosopher&#x27;s original text in Greek, which omits &quot;let us use this number in the worship of the gods&quot;, and are not supported by translations of the works of Aristotle by scholars such as Stuart Leggatt, W. K. C. Guthrie, J.L. Stocks, Thomas Taylor and Jules Barthélemy-Saint-Hilaire.

Some anti-trinitarians note also that the Greek philosopher Plato believed in a special &quot;threeness&quot; in life and in the universe. In &quot;Phaedo&quot;, he introduces the word &quot;triad&quot; (in Greek τριάς), which is rendered in English as &quot;trinity&quot;. This was adopted by 3rd and 4thcentury professed Christians as roughly corresponding to &quot;Father, Word, and Spirit (Soul)&quot;. Nontrinitarian Christians contend that such notions and adoptions make the Trinity doctrine extra-biblical. They say there is a widely acknowledged synthesis of Christianity with Platonic philosophy evident in trinitarian formulas appearing by the end of the 3rdcentury. They allege that beginning with the Constantinian period, these pagan ideas were forcibly imposed on the churches as Catholic doctrine. Most groups subscribing to the theory of a Great Apostasy generally concur in this thesis.

The early apologists, including Justin Martyr, Tertullian and Irenaeus, frequently discussed the parallels and contrasts between Christianity, Paganism and other syncretic religions, and answered charges of borrowing from paganism in their apologetical writings.

===Hellenic influences===

Stuart G Hall (formerly Professor of Ecclesiastical History at King&#x27;s College, London) describes the subsequent process of philosophical/theological amalgamation in &quot;Doctrine and Practice in the Early Church&quot; (1991), where he writes:
The neo-Platonic trinities, such as that of the One, the Nous and the Soul, are not considered a trinity necessarily of consubstantial equals as in mainstream Christianity. However, the neo-Platonic trinity has the doctrine of emanation, or &quot;eternal derivation&quot;, a timeless procedure of generation having as a source the One and claimed to be paralleled with the generation of the light from the Sun. This was adopted by Origen and later on by Athanasius, and applied to the generation of the Son from the Father, because they believed that this analogy could be used to support the notion that the Father, as immutable, always had been a Father, and that the generation of the Son is therefore eternal and timeless.

The synthesis of Christianity with Platonic philosophy was further incorporated in the trinitarian formulas that appeared by the end of the 3rd century. &quot;The Greek philosophical theology&quot; was &quot;developed during the Trinitarian controversies over the relationships among the persons of the Godhead&quot;. The allegation of borrowing was raised by some disputants when the Nicene doctrine was being formalized and adopted by the bishops. For example, in the 4th century, Marcellus of Ancyra, who taught the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit were one person (hypostasis), said in his &quot;On the Holy Church, 9&quot;:

In his Introduction to the 1964 book &quot;Meditations&quot;, the Anglican priest Maxwell Staniforth discussed the profound influence of Stoic philosophy on Christianity. In particular:
Again in the doctrine of the Trinity, the ecclesiastical conception of Father, Word, and Spirit finds its germ in the different Stoic names of the Divine Unity. Thus Seneca, writing of the supreme Power which shapes the universe, states, &#x27;This Power we sometimes call the All-ruling God, sometimes the incorporeal Wisdom, sometimes the holy Spirit, sometimes Destiny.&#x27; The Church had only to reject the last of these terms to arrive at its own acceptable definition of the Divine Nature; while the further assertion &#x27;these three are One&#x27;, which the modern mind finds paradoxical, was no more than commonplace to those familiar with Stoic notions.

<text>During World War II, Operation Pastel was the U.S. deception plan scheduled to protect Operation Olympic, the planned invasion of southern Japan. Pastel would have falsely portrayed a threat of an American-led invasion against ports in China via attacks on Formosa.

One of the notional military formations that was designated for use in the deception was the fictitious XXXV Airborne Corps. The Corps formed part of Operation Pastel Two, the deception plan for Operation Olympic.

The final version of Operation Pastel incorporated notional airborne landings, using dummy parachutists similar to those used on D-Day, in the interior of Kyūshū the day before the actual landings were to take place. The two-division fictional corps that was to carry out the landings was designated XXXV Airborne Corps.

Under Operation Pastel, the first elements of the XXXV Airborne Corps, quartering parties of the notional 18th Airborne Division, were depicted as reaching Okinawa on August 15, 1945. Following this, glider pilots would reach Okinawa around August 20, 1945, followed by the troops of the real 11th (in the Philippines) and notional 18th Airborne Divisions, starting to arrive in Okinawa on September 1, 1945. On the same day, the notional corps headquarters would have been activated.

<text>Albay (IPA: ), officially the Province of Albay (; ; ᜎᜎᜏᜒᜄᜈ᜔ ᜈᜅ᜔ ᜀᜎ᜔ᜊᜌ᜔), is a province in the Bicol Region of the Philippines, mostly on the southeastern part of the island of Luzon. Its capital (and largest city) is the city of Legazpi, the regional center of the whole Bicol Region, which is located in the southern foothill of Mayon Volcano.

The province was added to the UNESCO World Network of Biosphere Reserves in March 2016.

== History ==

=== Early history ===
Long before the Spaniards arrived, Albay had a thriving civilization. Formerly called &quot;Ibat&quot;, and then &quot;Libog&quot;, Albay was once ruled by Gat Ibal, an old chief who also founded the old barangay of Sawangan, now part of the City of Legazpi. Historian William Henry Scott wrote that in the local epic called &quot;siday&quot; entitled &quot;Bingi of Lawan&quot;, an Albay datu by the name of Dumaraog went to Lawan (present-day Laoang, Northern Samar) to ask for the hands of Bingi bringing with him 100 ships. Datu Iberein came from the settlement of Lawan. He was described by Scott as a “Samar datu by the name of Iberein was rowed out to a Spanish vessel anchored in his harbor in 1543 by oarsmen collared in gold; while wearing on his own person earrings and chains.”

=== Spanish colonial era ===

In July 1569, Luis Enriquez de Guzman, a member of the expedition led by &quot;Maestro de Campo&quot; Mateo de Saz and Captain Martin de Goiti, led a group that crossed from Burias and Ticao islands and landed on a coastal settlement called &quot;Ibalon&quot; in what is now the province of Sorsogon. From this point, another expedition was sent to explore the interior and founded the town of Camalig.

In 1573, Juan de Salcedo penetrated the Bicol Peninsula from the north as far south as Libon, establishing the settlement of Santiago de Libon. Jose Maria Peñaranda, a military engineer, was made “&quot;corregidor&quot;” of the province on May 14, 1834. He constructed public buildings and built roads and bridges.

The entire Bicol peninsula was organized as one province with two divisions, Camarines in the northwest and Ibalon in the southeast. In 1636, the two &quot;partido&quot;s were separated, and Ibalon became a separate province with Sorsogon as the capital. In the 17th century, Moro slave raiders from the southern Philippines ravaged the northeastern coastal areas of the province of Albay. By the end of the 1700s, Albay had 12,339 native families and 146 Spanish Filipino families.

Mayon Volcano, in one of its most violent eruptions, destroyed the five towns surrounding its base on February 1, 1814. This eruption forced the town of Cagsawa to relocate to its present site, Legazpi.

A decree was issued by Governor-General Narciso Claveria in 1846 separating Masbate, Ticao, and Burias from Albay to form the &quot;comandancia&quot; of Masbate. Albay was then divided into four districts: Iraya, Cordillera or Tabaco, Sorsogon, and Catanduanes.

==== Philippine revolution ====
Glicerio Delgado, a condemned &quot; (insurgent), started revolutionary activities in the province. With a headquarters in the mountain of Guinobatan town, he joined the revolutionary government of Albay as a lieutenant in the infantry.

A unit of the Philippine Militia was then organized by the Spanish military authorities. Mariano Riosa was appointed major of the Tabaco Zone, which comprised all the towns along the seacoast from Albay to Tiwi while Anacieto Solano was appointed major for the Iraya Zone, which was made up of the towns from Daraga to Libon. Each town was organized into sections of fifty men under the command of a lieutenant.

During the Philippine Revolution on September 22, 1898, the provisional revolutionary government of Albay was formed with Anacieto Solano as provisional president. Major General Vito Belarmino, the appointed military commander, reorganized the Filipino Army in the province.

=== American invasion era ===
Following the Spanish–American War, the new colonial power the United States did not recognize the country&#x27;s independence, which had been declared in June 1898, and the Americans subsequently acquired direct control of the country as a de facto colony, under the terms of the Treaty of Paris (1898), over which the Filipinos had no say. During the Philippine–American War, Brigadier General William August Kobbé headed the expedition that landed at the ports of Sorsogon, Bulan and Donsol. From there, the Americans marched to Legazpi and captured it.

Although a civil government was established in Albay on April 26, 1901, Colonel Harry Hill Bandholtz, Commanding Officer of the Constabulary in the Bicol Region, said that General Simeon Ola, with a thousand men, continued to defy American authority after the capture of Belarmino in 1901. Ola was later captured with about six hundred of his men.

=== Japanese occupation era ===
Following the December 12, 1941, Japanese invasion of Legazpi during the Second World War, the Kimura Detachment of the Imperial Japanese Army occupied Albay Province. The region was defended only by the Philippine Constabulary unit under the command of Major Francisco Sandico.

During the Japanese Occupation, the military general headquarters of the Commonwealth Army of the Philippines remained active from January 3, 1942, to June 30, 1946, and the 5th Constabulary Regiment of the Philippine Constabulary was established from October 28, 1944, to June 30, 1946, and stationed in Albay. Then came the clearing operations and anti-Japanese insurgency in the Bicol Peninsula, helped by the local Bicolano resistance. Some Bicolano guerrilla groups invaded around the province of Albay during the Japanese Insurgencies between 1942 and 1944 and were supported by local Filipino troops under the Philippine Commonwealth Army and pre-war Philippine Constabulary 5th Infantry Regiments attacking the enemy soldiers of the Japanese Imperial Army. In the aftermath of three years of siege and conflicts, many Bicolano guerrillas were forced to retreat by the Japanese around the province before liberation in 1945 by Allied forces.

=== Marcos dictatorship ===

Oas, Albay, was one of the localities particularly harmed by the Dictatorship of Ferdinand Marcos; in the waning days of the dictatorship, Oas was hit by a series of political killings targeting those who dared to speak out against the abuses of the Military and against Ferdinand Marcos.

The most prominent of the victims was Clemente Ragragio, the municipal sanitation inspector of Ligao who was later also assigned to Oas. Known for his effectiveness, he had been awarded the 1983 Best Sanitary Inspector for Albay. However, this led the dictatorship&#x27;s local administrators suspecting him of being a rebel sympathizer, because his close relationship with locals in far-flung barangays allowed him to move around fearlessly, and because he expressed disagreements with the dictatorship&#x27;s governance. A killer shot him three times in front of his house in the early evening of August 21, 1985, and the government did not investigate his murder. He was later honored by having his name inscribed on the wall of remembrance at the Philippines&#x27; Bantayog ng mga Bayani (lit. Monument of Heroes), which honors the martyrs and heroes who fought to restore democracy in the wake of the Marcos dictatorship.

There is also a ritual dance named after her as it is performed to be a countermeasure against Bakunawa.; &quot;Bulan&quot;, the god of the pale moon, he is depicted as a pubescent boy with uncommon comeliness that made savage beast and the vicious mermaids (Magindara) tame. He has deep affection towards Magindang, but plays with him by running away so that Magindang would never catch him. The reason for this is because he is shy to the man that he loves. If Magindang manages to catch Bulan, Haliya always comes to free him from Magindang&#x27;s grip; &quot;Magindang&quot;, the god of the sea and all its creatures. He has deep affection to the lunar god Bulan and pursues him despite never catching him. Due to this, the Bicolanos reasoned that it is to why the waves rise to reach the Moon when seen from the distant horizon. Whenever he does catch up to Bulan, Haliya comes to rescue Bulan and free him immediately; &quot;Okot&quot;, god of forest and hunting; and &quot;Bakunawa&quot;, a gigantic sea serpent deity who is often considered as the cause of eclipses, the devourer of the Sun and the Moon, and an adversary of Haliya as Bakunawa&#x27;s main aim is to swallow Bulan, who Haliya swore to protect for all of eternity.

<text>A Scottish clan (from Scottish Gaelic , literally &#x27;children&#x27;, more broadly &#x27;kindred&#x27;) is a kinship group among the Scottish people. Clans give a sense of shared heritage and descent to members, and in modern times have an official structure recognised by the Court of the Lord Lyon, which regulates Scottish heraldry and coats of arms. Most clans have their own tartan patterns, usually dating from the 19th century, which members may incorporate into kilts or other clothing.

The modern image of clans, each with their own tartan and specific land, was promulgated by the Scottish author Sir Walter Scott after influence by others. Historically, tartan designs were associated with Lowland and Highland districts whose weavers tended to produce cloth patterns favoured in those districts. By process of social evolution, it followed that the clans/families prominent in a particular district would wear the tartan of that district, and it was but a short step for that community to become identified by it.

Many clans have their own clan chief; those that do not are known as armigerous clans. Clans generally identify with geographical areas originally controlled by their founders, sometimes with an ancestral castle and clan gatherings, which form a regular part of the social scene. The most notable clan event of recent times was The Gathering 2009 in Edinburgh, which attracted at least 47,000 participants from around the world.

It is a common misconception that every person who bears a clan&#x27;s name is a lineal descendant of the chiefs. Many clansmen, although not related to the chief, took the chief&#x27;s surname as their own either to show solidarity or to obtain basic protection or for much needed sustenance. Most of the followers of the clan were tenants, who supplied labour to the clan leaders. Contrary to popular belief, the ordinary clansmen rarely had any blood tie of kinship with the clan chiefs, but they sometimes took the chief&#x27;s surname as their own when surnames came into common use in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Thus, by the eighteenth century the myth had arisen that the whole clan was descended from one ancestor, perhaps relying on Scottish Gaelic originally having a primary sense of &#x27;children&#x27; or &#x27;offspring&#x27;.

About 30% of Scottish families are attached to a clan.

==Clan organization==

===Clan membership===
As noted above, the word &quot;clan&quot; is derived from the Gaelic word . However, the need for proved descent from a common ancestor related to the chiefly house is too restrictive. Clans developed a territory based on the native men who came to accept the authority of the dominant group in the vicinity. A clan also included a large group of loosely related &quot;septs&quot; – dependent families – all of whom looked to the clan chief as their head and their protector.

According to the former Lord Lyon, Sir Thomas Innes of Learney, a clan is a community that is distinguished by heraldry and recognised by the Sovereign. Learney considered clans to be a &quot;noble incorporation&quot; because the arms borne by a clan chief are granted or otherwise recognised by the Lord Lyon as an officer of the Crown, thus conferring royal recognition to the entire clan. Clans with recognised chiefs are therefore considered a noble community under Scots law. A group without a chief recognised by the Sovereign, through the Lord Lyon, has no official standing under Scottish law. Claimants to the title of chief are expected to be recognised by the Lord Lyon as the rightful heir to the undifferenced arms of the ancestor of the clan of which the claimant seeks to be recognized as chief. A chief of a clan is the only person who is entitled to bear the undifferenced arms of the ancestral founder of the clan. The clan is considered to be the chief&#x27;s heritable estate and the chief&#x27;s Seal of Arms is the seal of the clan as a &quot;noble corporation&quot;. Under Scots law, the chief is recognised as the head of the clan and serves as the lawful representative of the clan community.

Historically, a clan was made up of everyone who lived on the chief&#x27;s territory, or on territory of those who owed allegiance to the said chief. Through time, with the constant changes of &quot;clan boundaries&quot;, migration or regime changes, clans would be made up of large numbers of members who were unrelated and who bore different surnames. Often, those living on a chief&#x27;s lands would, over time, adopt the clan surname. A chief could add to his clan by adopting other families, and also had the legal right to outlaw anyone from his clan, including members of his own family. Today, anyone who has the chief&#x27;s surname is automatically considered to be a member of the chief&#x27;s clan. Also, anyone who offers allegiance to a chief becomes a member of the chief&#x27;s clan, unless the chief decides not to accept that person&#x27;s allegiance.

Clan membership goes through the surname. Children who take their father&#x27;s surname are part of their father&#x27;s clan and their mother&#x27;s. However, there have been several cases where a descendant through the maternal line has changed their surname in order to claim the chiefship of a clan, such as the late chief of the Clan MacLeod who was born John Wolridge-Gordon and changed his name to the maiden name of his maternal grandmother in order to claim the chiefship of the MacLeods. Today, clans may have lists of septs. Septs are surnames, families or clans that historically, currently or for whatever reason the chief chooses, are associated with that clan. There is no official list of clan septs, and the decision of what septs a clan has is left up to the clan itself. Confusingly, sept names can be shared by more than one clan, and it may be up to the individual to use his or her family history or genealogy to find the correct clan with which they are associated.

Several clan societies have been granted coats of arms. In such cases, these arms are differenced from the chief&#x27;s, much like a clan armiger. Former Lord Lyon Thomas Innes of Learney stated that such societies, according to the Law of Arms, are considered an &quot;indeterminate cadet&quot;.

===Authority of the clans (the and the )===
Scottish clanship contained two complementary but distinct concepts of heritage. These were firstly the collective heritage of the clan, known as their , which was their prescriptive right to settle in the territories in which the chiefs and leading gentry of the clan customarily provided protection. This concept was where all clansmen recognised the personal authority of the chiefs and leading gentry as trustees for their clan. The second concept was the wider acceptance of the granting of charters by the Crown and other powerful landowners to the chiefs, chieftains and lairds which defined the estate settled by their clan. This was known as their and gave a different emphasis to the clan chief&#x27;s authority in that it gave the authority to the chiefs and leading gentry as landed proprietors, who owned the land in their own right, rather than just as trustees for the clan. From the beginning of Scottish clanship, the clan warrior elite, who were known as the ‘fine’, strove to be landowners as well as territorial war lords.

===Clans, the law and the legal process===

The concept of mentioned above held precedence in the Middle Ages; however, by the early modern period the concept of was favoured. This shift reflected the importance of Scots law in shaping the structure of clanship in that the &quot;fine&quot; were awarded charters and the continuity of heritable succession was secured. The heir to the chief was known as the and was usually the direct male heir. However, in some cases the direct heir was set aside for a more politically accomplished or belligerent relative. There were not many disputes over succession after the 16th century and, by the 17th century, the setting aside of the male heir was a rarity. This was governed and restricted by the law of Entail, which prevented estates from being divided up amongst female heirs and therefore also prevented the loss of clan territories.

The main legal process used within the clans to settle criminal and civil disputes was known as &quot;arbitration&quot;, in which the aggrieved and allegedly offending sides put their cases to a panel that was drawn from the leading gentry and was overseen by the clan chief. There was no appeal against the decision made by the panel, which was usually recorded in the local royal or burgh court.

===Social ties===

Fosterage and manrent were the most important forms of social bonding in the clans. In the case of fosterage, the chief&#x27;s children would be brought up by a favored member of the leading clan gentry and in turn their children would be favored by members of the clan.

In the case of manrent, this was a bond contracted by the heads of families looking to the chief for territorial protection, though not living on the estates of the clan elite. These bonds were reinforced by &quot;calps&quot;, death duties paid to the chief as a mark of personal allegiance by the family when their head died, usually in the form of their best cow or horse. Although &quot;calps&quot; were banned by Parliament in 1617, manrent continued covertly to pay for protection.

The marriage alliance reinforced links with neighboring clans as well as with families within the territory of the clan. The marriage alliance was also a commercial contract involving the exchange of livestock, money, and land through payments in which the bride was known as the &quot;tocher&quot; and the groom was known as the &quot;dowry&quot;.
=== Clan Gatherings and Affiliations ===
Clan gatherings are a unique feature of Scottish clan culture, where members of a clan convene to celebrate their shared heritage, participate in Highland Games, and discuss clan business. These events serve as a focal point for clan members and help in preserving historical and cultural landmarks, as well as the natural environment of Scotland. Clan affiliations aren&#x27;t solely based on ancestry; people with no Scottish lineage can also be affiliated with a clan, commonly known as &quot;Clan Friends.&quot;
===Clan management===

Rents from those living within the clan estate were collected by the &quot;tacksmen&quot;. These lesser gentry acted as estate managers, allocating the &quot;runrig&quot; strips of land, lending seed-corn and tools and arranging the droving of cattle to the Lowlands for sale, taking a minor share of the payments made to the clan nobility, the &quot;fine&quot;. They had the important military role of mobilizing the &quot;Clan Host&quot;, both when required for warfare and more commonly as a large turnout of followers for weddings and funerals, and traditionally, in August, for hunts which included sports for the followers, the predecessors of the modern Highland games.

===Clan disputes and disorder===

Where the (land owned by the clan elite or &quot;fine&quot;) did not match the common heritage of the (the collective territory of the clan) this led to territorial disputes and warfare. The &quot;fine&quot; resented their clansmen paying rent to other landlords. Some clans used disputes to expand their territories. Most notably, the Clan Campbell and the Clan Mackenzie were prepared to play off territorial disputes within and among clans to expand their own land and influence. Feuding on the western seaboard was conducted with such intensity that the Clan MacLeod and the Clan MacDonald on the Isle of Skye were reputedly reduced to eating dogs and cats in the 1590s.

Feuding was further compounded by the involvement of Scottish clans in the wars between the Irish Gaels and the English Tudor monarchy in the 16th century. Within these clans, there evolved a military caste of members of the lesser gentry who were purely warriors and not managers, and who migrated seasonally to Ireland to fight as mercenaries.

There was heavy feuding between the clans during the civil wars of the 1640s; however, by this time, the chiefs and leading gentry preferred increasingly to settle local disputes by recourse to the law. After the Restoration of the monarchy in 1660, the incidents of feuding between clans declined considerably. The last &quot;clan&quot; feud that led to a battle and which was not part of a civil war was the Battle of Mulroy, which took place on 4 August 1688.

Cattle raiding, known as &quot;reiving&quot;, had been normal practice prior to the 17th century. It was also known as , where young men took livestock from neighbouring clans. By the 17th century, this had declined and most reiving was known as , where smaller numbers of men raided the adjoining Lowlands and the livestock taken usually being recoverable on payment of (information money) and guarantee of no prosecution. Some clans, such as the Clan MacFarlane and the Clan Farquharson, offered the Lowlanders protection against such raids, on terms not dissimilar to blackmail.

==Lowland clans==

An act of the Scottish Parliament of 1597 talks of the &quot;Chiftanis and chieffis of all clannis ... duelland in the hielands or bordouris&quot;. It has been argued that this vague phrase describes Borders families as clans. The act goes on to list the various Lowland families, including the Maxwells, Johnstones, Carruthers, Turnbulls, and other famous Border Reivers&#x27; names. Further, Sir George MacKenzie of Rosehaugh, the Lord Advocate (Attorney General) writing in 1680, said: &quot;By the term &#x27;chief&#x27; we call the representative of the family from the word chef or head and in the Irish [Gaelic] with us the chief of the family is called the head of the clan&quot;. In summarizing this material, Sir Crispin Agnew of Lochnaw Bt wrote: &quot;So it can be seen that all along the words &quot;chief&quot; or&quot; head&quot; and &quot;clan&quot; or &quot;family&quot; are interchangeable. It is therefore quite correct to talk of the MacDonald family or the Stirling clan.&quot; The idea that Highlanders should be listed as clans while the Lowlanders should be termed as families was merely a 19th-century convention. Although Gaelic has been supplanted by English in the Scottish Lowlands for nearly six hundred years, it is acceptable to refer to Lowland families, such as the Douglases as &quot;clans&quot;.

The Lowland Clan MacDuff are described specifically as a &quot;clan&quot; in legislation of the Scottish Parliament in 1384.

==History==

===Origins===

Many clans have often claimed mythological founders that reinforced their status and gave a romantic and glorified notion of their origins. Most powerful clans gave themselves origins based on Irish mythology. For example, there have been claims that the Clan Donald were descended from either &quot;Conn&quot;, a second-century king of Ulster, or &quot;Cuchulainn&quot;, the legendary hero of Ulster. Whilst their political enemies the Clan Campbell have claimed as their progenitor &quot;Diarmaid&quot; the Boar, who was rooted in the Fingalian or Fenian Cycle.

In contrast, the Clans Grant, Mackinnon and Gregor claimed ancestry from the Siol Alpin family, who descend from Alpin, father of Kenneth MacAlpin, who united the Scottish kingdom in 843. Only one confederation of clans, which included the Clan Sweeney, Clan Lamont, Clan MacLea, Clan MacLachlan and Clan MacNeill, can trace their ancestry back to the fifth century Niall of the Nine Hostages, High King of Ireland.

However, in reality, the progenitors of clans can rarely be authenticated further back than the 11th century, and a continuity of lineage in most cases cannot be found until the 13th or 14th centuries.

The emergence of clans had more to do with political turmoil than ethnicity. The Scottish Crown&#x27;s conquest of Argyll and the Outer Hebrides from the Norsemen in the 13th century, which followed on from the pacification of the Mormaer of Moray and the northern rebellions of the 12th and 13th centuries, created the opportunity for war lords to impose their dominance over local families who accepted their protection. These warrior chiefs can largely be categorized as Celtic; however, their origins range from Gaelic to Norse-Gaelic and British. By the 14th century, there had been further influx of kindreds whose ethnicity ranged from Norman or Anglo-Norman and Flemish, such as the Clan Cameron, Clan Fraser, Clan Menzies, Clan Chisholm and Clan Grant.

During the Wars of Scottish Independence, feudal tenures were introduced by Robert the Bruce, to harness and control the prowess of clans by the award of charters for land in order to gain support in the national cause against the English. For example, the Clan MacDonald were elevated above the Clan MacDougall, two clans who shared a common descent from a great Norse-Gaelic warlord named Somerled of the 12th century. Clanship was thus not only a strong tie of local kinship but also of feudalism to the Scottish Crown. It is this feudal component, reinforced by Scots law, that separates Scottish &quot;clanship&quot; from the &quot;tribalism&quot; that was found in Ancient Europe or the one that is still found in the Middle East and among aboriginal groups in Australasia, Africa, and the Americas.

===Civil wars and Jacobitism===
During the 1638 to 1651 Wars of the Three Kingdoms, all sides were &#x27;Royalist&#x27;, in the sense of a shared belief monarchy was divinely inspired. The choice of whether to support Charles I, or the Covenanter government, was largely driven by disputes within the Scottish elite. In 1639, Covenanter politician Argyll, head of Clan Campbell, was given a commission of &#x27;fire and sword&#x27;, which he used to seize MacDonald territories in Lochaber, and those held by Clan Ogilvy in Angus. As a result, both clans supported Montrose&#x27;s Royalist campaign of 1644–1645, in hopes of regaining them.

When Charles II regained the throne in 1660, the Rescissory Act 1661 restored bishops to the Church of Scotland. This was supported by many chiefs since it suited the hierarchical clan structure and encouraged obedience to authority. Both Charles and his brother James VII used Highland levies, known as the &quot;Highland Host&quot;, to control Campbell-dominated areas in the South-West and suppress the 1685 Argyll&#x27;s Rising. By 1680, it is estimated there were fewer than 16,000 Catholics in Scotland, confined to parts of the aristocracy and Gaelic-speaking clans in the Highlands and Islands.

When James was deposed in the November 1688 Glorious Revolution, choice of sides was largely opportunistic. The Presbyterian Macleans backed the Jacobites to regain territories in Mull lost to the Campbells in the 1670s; the Catholic Keppoch MacDonalds tried to sack the pro-Jacobite town of Inverness, and were bought off only after Dundee intervened.

Highland involvement in the Jacobite risings was the result of their remoteness, and the feudal clan system which required tenants to provide military service. Historian Frank McLynn identifies seven primary drivers in Jacobitism, support for the Stuarts being the least important; a large percentage of Jacobite support in 1745 Rising came from Lowlanders who opposed the 1707 Union, and members of the Scottish Episcopal Church.

In 1745, the majority of clan leaders advised Prince Charles to return to France, including MacDonald of Sleat and Norman MacLeod. By arriving without French military support, they felt Charles failed to keep his commitments, while it is also suggested Sleat and MacLeod were vulnerable to government sanctions due to their involvement in illegally selling tenants into indentured servitude.

Enough were persuaded, but the choice was rarely simple; Donald Cameron of Lochiel committed himself only after he was provided &quot;security for the full value of his estate should the rising prove abortive,&quot; while MacLeod and Sleat helped Charles escape after Culloden.

===Collapse of the clan system===

In 1493, James IV confiscated the Lordship of the Isles from the MacDonalds. This destabilised the region, while links between the Scottish MacDonalds and Irish MacDonnells meant unrest in one country often spilled into the other. James VI took various measures to deal with the resulting instability, including the 1587 &#x27;Slaughter under trust&#x27; law, later used in the 1692 Glencoe Massacre. To prevent endemic feuding, it required disputes to be settled by the Crown, specifically murder committed in &#x27;cold-blood&#x27;, once articles of surrender had been agreed, or hospitality accepted. Its first recorded use was in 1588, when Lachlan Maclean was prosecuted for the murder of his new stepfather, John MacDonald, and 17 other members of the MacDonald wedding party.

Other measures had limited impact; imposing financial sureties on landowners for the good behaviour of their tenants often failed, as many were not regarded as the clan chief. The 1603 Union of the Crowns coincided with the end of the Anglo-Irish Nine Years&#x27; War, followed by land confiscations in 1608. Previously the most Gaelic part of Ireland, the Plantation of Ulster tried to ensure stability in Western Scotland by importing Scots and English Protestants. This process was often supported by the original owners; in 1607 Sir Randall MacDonnell settled 300 Presbyterian Scots families on his land in Antrim. This ended the Irish practice of using Highland gallowglass, or mercenaries.

The 1609 Statutes of Iona imposed a range of measures on clan chiefs, designed to integrate them into the Scottish landed classes. Whilst there is debate over their practical effect, they were an influential force on clan elites in the long term.
The Statutes obliged clan chiefs to reside in Edinburgh for a large part of the year, and have their heirs educated in the English-speaking Lowlands. Lengthy periods in Edinburgh were costly. Since the Highlands were a largely non-cash economy, this meant they shifted towards commercial exploitation of their lands, rather than managing them as part of a social system. The costs of living away from their clan lands contributed to the chronic indebtedness that was increasingly common for Highland landowners, eventually leading to the sale of many of the great Highland estates in the late 18th and early 19th century.

During the 18th century, in an effort to increase the income from their estates, clan chiefs started to restrict the ability of tacksmen to sublet. This meant more of the rent paid by those actually farming the land went to the landowner. The result, though, was the removal of this layer of clan society. In a process that accelerated from the 1770s onward, by the early 19th century the tacksman had become a rare component of society. Historian T. M. Devine describes &quot;the displacement of this class as one of the clearest demonstrations of the death of the old Gaelic society.&quot; Many tacksmen, as well as the wealthier farmers (who were tired of repeated rent increases) chose to emigrate. This could be taken as resistance to the changes in the Highland agricultural economy, as the introduction of agricultural improvement gave rise to the Highland clearances. The loss of this middle tier of Highland society represented not only a flight of capital from Gaeldom, but also a loss of entrepreneurial energy. The first major step in the clearances was the decision of the Dukes of Argyll to put tacks (or leases) of farms and townships up for auction. This began with Campbell property in Kintyre in the 1710s and spread after 1737 to all their holdings. This action as a commercial landlord, letting land to the highest bidder, was a clear breach of the principle of .
The Jacobite rising of 1745 used to be described as the pivotal event in the demise in clanship. There is no doubt that the aftermath of the uprising saw savage punitive expeditions against clans that had supported the Jacobites, and legislative attempts to demolish clan culture. However, the emphasis of historians now is on the conversion of chiefs into landlords in a slow transition over a long period. The successive Jacobite rebellions, in the view of T.M. Devine, simply paused the process of change whilst the military aspects of clans regained temporary importance; the apparent surge in social change after the &#x27;45 was merely a process of catching up with the financial pressures that gave rise to landlordism. The various pieces of legislation that followed Culloden included the Heritable Jurisdictions Act which extinguished the right of chiefs to hold courts and transferred this role to the judiciary. The traditional loyalties of clansmen were probably unaffected by this. There is also doubt about any real effect from the banning of Highland dress (which was repealed in 1782 anyway).

The Highland Clearances saw further actions by clan chiefs to raise more money from their lands. In the first phase of clearance, when agricultural improvement was introduced, many of the peasant farmers were evicted and resettled in newly created crofting communities, usually in coastal areas. The small size of the crofts were intended to force the tenants to work in other industries, such as fishing or the kelp industry. With a shortage of work, the numbers of Highlanders who became seasonal migrants to the Lowlands increased. This gave an advantage in speaking English, as the &quot;language of work&quot;. It was found that when the Gaelic Schools Society started teaching basic literacy in Gaelic in the early decades of the 19th century, there was an increase in literacy in English. This paradox may be explained by the annual report of the Society in Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge (SSPCK) in 1829, which stated: &quot;so ignorant are the parents that it is difficult to convince them that it can be any benefit to their children to learn Gaelic, though they are all anxious ... to have them taught English&quot;.

The second phase of the Highland clearances affected overpopulated crofting communities which were no longer able to support themselves due to famine and/or collapse of the industries on which they relied. &quot;Assisted passages&quot; were provided to destitute tenants by landlords who found this cheaper than continued cycles of famine relief to those in substantial rent arrears. This applied particularly to the Western Highlands and the Hebrides. Many Highland estates were no longer owned by clan chiefs, but landlords of both the new and old type encouraged the emigration of destitute tenants to Canada and, later, to Australia. The clearances were followed by a period of even greater emigration, which continued (with a brief lull for the First World War) up to the start of the Great Depression.

===Romantic memory===
Most of the anti-clan legislation was repealed by the end of the eighteenth century as the Jacobite threat subsided, with the Dress Act restricting kilt wearing being repealed in 1782. There was soon a process of the rehabilitation of highland culture. By the nineteenth century, tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, although preserved in the Highland regiments in the British army, which poor highlanders joined in large numbers until the end of the Napoleonic Wars in 1815. The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the Ossian cycle published by James Macpherson (1736–96). Macpherson claimed to have found poetry written by the ancient bard Ossian, and published translations that acquired international popularity. Highland aristocrats set up Highland Societies in Edinburgh (1784) and other centres including London (1788). The image of the romantic highlands was further popularised by the works of Walter Scott. His &quot;staging&quot; of the royal visit of King George IV to Scotland in 1822 and the King&#x27;s wearing of tartan, resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish linen industry. The designation of individual clan tartans was largely defined in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity. This &quot;Highlandism&quot;, by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria&#x27;s interest in the country, her adoption of Balmoral Castle as a major royal retreat from and her interest in &quot;tartenry&quot;.

==Clan symbols==

The revival of interest, and demand for clan ancestry, has led to the production of lists and maps covering the whole of Scotland giving clan names and showing territories, sometimes with the appropriate tartans. While some lists and clan maps confine their area to the Highlands, others also show Lowland clans or families. Territorial areas and allegiances changed over time, and there are also differing decisions on which (smaller) clans and families should be omitted (some alternative online sources are listed in the &quot;External links&quot; section below).

This list of clans contains clans registered with the Lord Lyon Court.
The Lord Lyon Court defines a clan or family as a legally recognised group, but does not differentiate between families and clans as it recognises both terms as being interchangeable. Clans or families thought to have had a chief in the past but not currently recognised by the Lord Lyon are listed at armigerous clans.

===Tartan===


Tartans were traditionally associated with the Highland Clans and following the end of the Dress Act 1746 banning tartans from being worn by men and boys, &quot;district then clan tartans&quot; have been an important part of Scottish clans. Almost all Scottish clans have more than one tartan attributed to their surname. Although there are no rules on who can or cannot wear a particular tartan, and it is possible for anyone to create a tartan and name it almost any name they wish, the only person with the authority to make a clan&#x27;s tartan &quot;official&quot; is the chief. In some cases, following such recognition from the clan chief, the clan tartan is recorded and registered by the Lord Lyon. Once approved by the Lord Lyon, after recommendation by the Advisory Committee on Tartan, the clan tartan is then recorded in the Lyon Court Books. In at least one instance a clan tartan appears in the heraldry of a clan chief and the Lord Lyon considers it to be the &quot;proper&quot; tartan of the clan.

Originally, there appears to have been no association of tartans with specific clans; instead, highland tartans were produced to various designs by local weavers and any identification was purely regional, but the idea of a clan-specific tartan gained currency in the late 18th century and in 1815 the Highland Society of London began the naming of clan-specific tartans. Many clan tartans derive from a 19th-century hoax known as the &quot;Vestiarium Scoticum&quot;. The &quot;Vestiarium&quot; was composed by the &quot;Sobieski Stuarts&quot;, who passed it off as a reproduction of an ancient manuscript of clan tartans. It has since been proven a forgery, but despite this, the designs are still highly regarded and they continue to serve their purpose to identify the clan in question.

===Crest badge===

A sign of allegiance to the clan chief is the wearing of a crest badge. The crest badge suitable for a clansman or clanswoman consists of the chief&#x27;s heraldic crest encircled with a strap and buckle and which contains the chief&#x27;s heraldic motto or slogan. Although it is common to speak of &quot;clan crests&quot;, there is no such thing. In Scotland (and indeed all of UK) only individuals, clans, possess a heraldic coat of arms. Even though any clansmen and clanswomen may purchase crest badges and wear them to show their allegiance to his or her clan, the heraldic crest and motto always belong to the chief alone. In principle, these badges should only be used with the permission of the clan chief; and the Lyon Court has intervened in cases where permission has been withheld. Scottish crest badges, much like clan-specific tartans, do not have a long history, and owe much to Victorian era romanticism, having only been worn on the bonnet since the 19th century. The concept of a clan badge or form of identification may have some validity, as it is commonly stated that the original markers were merely specific plants worn in bonnets or hung from a pole or spear.

===Clan badge===

Clan badges are another means of showing one&#x27;s allegiance to a Scottish clan. These badges, sometimes called plant badges, consist of a sprig of a particular plant. They are usually worn in a bonnet behind the Scottish crest badge; they can also be attached at the shoulder of a lady&#x27;s tartan sash, or be tied to a pole and used as a standard. Clans which are connected historically, or that occupied lands in the same general area, may share the same clan badge. According to popular lore, clan badges were used by Scottish clans as a form of identification in battle. However, the badges attributed to clans today can be completely unsuitable for even modern clan gatherings. Clan badges are commonly referred to as the original clan symbol. However, Thomas Innes of Learney claimed the heraldic flags of clan chiefs would have been the earliest means of identifying Scottish clans in battle or at large gatherings.

<text>The House of Stuart, originally spelled Stewart, was a royal house of Scotland, England, Ireland and later Great Britain. The family name comes from the office of High Steward of Scotland, which had been held by the family progenitor Walter fitz Alan (). The name Stewart and variations had become established as a family name by the time of his grandson Walter Stewart. The first monarch of the Stewart line was Robert II, whose male-line descendants were kings and queens in Scotland from 1371, and of England, Ireland and Great Britain from 1603, until 1714. Mary, Queen of Scots (r. 1542–1567), was brought up in France where she adopted the French spelling of the name Stuart.

In 1503, James IV married Margaret Tudor, thus linking the reigning royal houses of Scotland and England. Margaret&#x27;s niece, Elizabeth I of England died without issue in 1603, and James IV&#x27;s and Margaret&#x27;s great-grandson James VI of Scotland acceded to the thrones of England and Ireland as James I in the Union of the Crowns. The Stuarts were monarchs of Britain and Ireland and its growing empire until the death of Queen Anne in 1714, except for the period of the Commonwealth between 1649 and 1660.

In total, nine Stewart/Stuart monarchs ruled Scotland alone from 1371 until 1603, the last of whom was James VI, before his accession in England. Two Stuart queens ruled the isles following the Glorious Revolution in 1688: Mary II and Anne. Both were the Protestant daughters of James VII and II by his first wife Anne Hyde and the great-grandchildren of James VI and I. Their father had converted to Catholicism and his new wife gave birth to a son in 1688, who was to be brought up as a Roman Catholic; so James was deposed by Parliament in 1689, in favour of his daughters. However, neither daughter had any children who survived to adulthood, so the crown passed to the House of Hanover on the death of Queen Anne in 1714 under the terms of the Act of Settlement 1701 and the Act of Security 1704. The House of Hanover had become linked to the House of Stuart through the line of Elizabeth Stuart, Queen of Bohemia.

After the loss of the throne, the descendants of James VII and II continued for several generations to attempt to reclaim the Scottish and English (and later British) throne as the rightful heirs, their supporters being known as Jacobites. Since the early 19th century, when the James II direct line failed, there have been no active claimants from the Stuart family. The current Jacobite heir to the claims of the historical Stuart monarchs is a distant cousin Franz, Duke of Bavaria, of the House of Wittelsbach. The senior living member of the royal Stewart family, descended in a legitimate male line from Robert II of Scotland, is Andrew Richard Charles Stuart, 9th Earl Castle Stewart.

== Background ==
The ancestral origins of the Stuart family are obscure—their probable ancestry is traced back to Alan fitz Flaad, a Breton who went to England not long after the Norman conquest. Alan had been the hereditary steward of the Bishop of Dol in the Duchy of Brittany; Alan had a good relationship with Henry I of England who awarded him with lands in Shropshire. The FitzAlan family quickly established themselves as a prominent Anglo-Norman noble house, with some of its members serving as High Sheriff of Shropshire. It was the son of Alan named Walter FitzAlan who became the first hereditary High Steward of Scotland, while his brother William&#x27;s family went on to become Earls of Arundel.

When the civil war in the Kingdom of England, known as The Anarchy, broke out between the legitimist claimant Matilda, Lady of the English, and her cousin who had usurped her, King Stephen, Walter had sided with Matilda. Another supporter of Matilda was her uncle David I of Scotland from the House of Dunkeld. After Matilda was pushed out of England into the County of Anjou, essentially failing in her legitimist attempt for the throne, many of her supporters in England fled also. It was then that Walter followed David up to the Kingdom of Scotland, where he was granted lands in Renfrewshire and the title for life of Lord High Steward. The next monarch of Scotland, Malcolm IV, made the High Steward title a hereditary arrangement. While High Stewards, the family were based at Dundonald, South Ayrshire, between the 12th and 13th centuries.

The sixth High Steward of Scotland, Walter Stewart (1293–1326), married Marjorie, daughter of Robert the Bruce, and also played an important part in the Battle of Bannockburn gaining further favour. Their son Robert was heir to the House of Bruce, the Lordship of Cunningham and the Bruce lands of Bourtreehill; he eventually inherited the Scottish throne when his uncle David II died childless in 1371.

In 1503, James IV attempted to secure peace with England by marrying King Henry VII&#x27;s daughter, Margaret Tudor. The birth of their son, later James V, brought the House of Stewart into the line of descent of the House of Tudor, and the English throne. Margaret Tudor later married Archibald Douglas, 6th Earl of Angus, and their daughter, Margaret Douglas, was the mother of Henry Stuart, Lord Darnley. In 1565, Darnley married his half-cousin Mary, Queen of Scots, the daughter of James V. Darnley&#x27;s father was Matthew Stewart, 4th Earl of Lennox, a member of the Stewart of Darnley branch of the House. Lennox was a descendant of Alexander Stewart, 4th High Steward of Scotland, also descended from James II, being Mary&#x27;s heir presumptive. Thus Darnley was also related to Mary on his father&#x27;s side and because of this connection, Mary&#x27;s heirs remained part of the House of Stuart. Following John Stewart of Darnley&#x27;s ennoblement for his part at the Battle of Baugé in 1421 and the grant of lands to him at Aubigny and Concressault, the Darnley Stewarts&#x27; surname was gallicised to &quot;Stuart&quot;.

Both Mary, Queen of Scots, and Lord Darnley had strong claims on the English throne through their mutual grandmother Margaret Tudor. This eventually led to the accession of the couple&#x27;s only child James as King of Scotland, England, and Ireland in 1603. However, this was a personal union, as the three Kingdoms shared a monarch, but had separate governments, churches, and institutions. Indeed, the personal union did not prevent an armed conflict, known as the Bishops&#x27; Wars, breaking out between England and Scotland in 1639. This was to become part of the cycle of political and military conflict that marked the reign of Charles I of England, Scotland and Ireland, culminating in a series of conflicts known as the War of the Three Kingdoms. The trial and execution of Charles I by the English Parliament in 1649 began 11 years of republican government known as the English Interregnum. Scotland initially recognised the late King&#x27;s son, also called Charles, as their monarch, before being subjugated and forced to enter Cromwell&#x27;s Commonwealth by General Monck&#x27;s occupying army. During this period, the principal members of the House of Stuart lived in exile in mainland Europe. The younger Charles returned to Britain to assume his three thrones in 1660 as &quot;Charles II of England, Scotland and Ireland&quot; - with the support of General Monck - but dated his reign from his father&#x27;s death eleven years before.

In feudal and dynastic terms, the Scottish reliance on French support was revived during the reign of Charles II, whose own mother was French. His sister Henrietta married into the French royal family. Charles II left no legitimate children, but his numerous illegitimate descendants included the Dukes of Buccleuch, the Dukes of Grafton, the Dukes of Saint Albans and the Dukes of Richmond.

== Present-day ==
The Royal House of Stuart became extinct with the death of Cardinal Henry Benedict Stuart, brother of Charles Edward Stuart, in 1807. Duke Francis of Bavaria is the current senior heir.

<doc id="253179" wikidata="Q5597739" url="?curid=253179" title="Gratz v. Bollinger">
<text>Gratz v. Bollinger, 539 U.S. 244 (2003), was a United States Supreme Court case regarding the University of Michigan undergraduate affirmative action admissions policy. In a 6–3 decision announced on June 23, 2003, Chief Justice Rehnquist, writing for the Court, ruled the University&#x27;s point system&#x27;s &quot;predetermined point allocations&quot; that awarded 20 points towards admission to underrepresented minorities &quot;ensures that the diversity contributions of applicants cannot be individually assessed&quot; and was therefore unconstitutional. It was the companion case to &quot;Grutter v. Bollinger&quot;.

==Case==
The University of Michigan used a 150-point scale to rank applicants, with 100 points needed to guarantee admission. The University gave underrepresented ethnic groups, including African-Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans, an automatic 20-point bonus towards their score, while a perfect SAT score was worth 12 points.

The petitioners, Jennifer Gratz and Patrick Hamacher, both residents of Michigan, applied for admission to the University of Michigan&#x27;s College of Literature, Science, and the Arts (LSA). Gratz applied for admission in the fall of 1995 and Hamacher in the fall of 1997. Both were subsequently denied admission to the university. Gratz and Hamacher were contacted by the Center for Individual Rights, which filed a lawsuit on their behalf in October 1997. The case was filed in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan against the University of Michigan, the College of LSA, James Duderstadt, and Lee Bollinger. Duderstadt was president of the university while Gratz&#x27;s application was under consideration, and Bollinger while Hamacher&#x27;s was under consideration. Their class-action lawsuit alleged &quot;violations and threatened violations of the rights of the plaintiffs and the class they represent to equal protection of the laws under the Fourteenth Amendment... and for racial discrimination.&quot;

Like &quot;Grutter,&quot; the case was heard in District Court, appealed to the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals, and asked to be heard before the Supreme Court.

==U.S. Supreme Court consideration==
===Issue of standing===
It has been argued by some that Jennifer Gratz lacked legal standing to bring this action. Gratz applied in 1995, three years before the University of Michigan adopted its points system. Gratz could not claim injury as a result of the points system, and thus, under traditional legal rules, Gratz lacked standing. Gratz chose not to attend the University of Michigan by declining the university&#x27;s offer to be placed on a waiting list. Every Michigan student who agreed to go onto the waiting list in the spring of 1995 was admitted to the University of Michigan for the Fall 1995 semester. However, Gratz argues that she did fill out the paperwork for the waiting list, but the University claims it got lost.

Chief Justice Rehnquist delivered the opinion of the court. The court&#x27;s majority found that Gratz and co-plaintiff Hamacher had standing to seek declaratory and injunctive relief, relying on &quot;Northeastern Fla. Chapter, Associated Gen. Contractors of America v. Jacksonville&quot;, 508 U.S. 656 (1993). Here the &quot;injury in fact&quot; necessary to establish standing in the case was the denial of equal treatment resulting from the imposition of the barrier, and not in the ultimate inability to obtain the benefit.

===Opinion of the Court===

The court held that because the university’s use of race in its current freshman admissions policy was not narrowly tailored to achieve the respondents&#x27; asserted interest in diversity, the policy violated the Equal Protection Clause.

===Dissent===
Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg dissented. Ginsburg wrote that &quot;government decisionmakers may properly distinguish between policies of exclusion and inclusion...Actions designed to burden groups long denied full citizenship stature are not sensibly ranked with measures taken to hasten the day when entrenched discrimination and its after effects have been extirpated.&quot;

<doc id="253185" wikidata="Q200339" url="?curid=253185" title="Mandarin duck">
<text>The mandarin duck (Aix galericulata) is a perching duck species native to the East Palearctic. It is sexually dimorphic - the males are elaborately coloured, while the females have more subdued colors. It is a medium-sized duck, at long with a wingspan. It is closely related to the North American wood duck, the only other member of the genus &quot;Aix&quot;. is an Ancient Greek word which was used by Aristotle to refer to an unknown diving bird, and is the Latin for a wig, derived from , a cap or bonnet. Outside of its native range, the mandarin duck has a large introduced population in the British Isles and Western Europe, with additional smaller introductions in North America.

==Taxonomy==
The mandarin duck was described and illustrated in 1727 by the German explorer Engelbert Kaempfer in his &quot;The History of Japan&quot;. He wrote: &quot;Of Ducks also there are several differing kinds, and as tame as the Geese. One kind particularly I cannot forbear mentioning, because of the surprizing beauty of its male, call&#x27;d &quot;Kinmodsui&quot;, which is so great, that being shew&#x27;d its picture in colours, I could hardly believe my own Eyes, till I saw the Bird it self, it being a very common one.&quot; In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the species in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Chinese teal&quot;. He based his hand-coloured etching on a live specimen kept by the merchant Matthew Decker on his estate at Richmond in Surrey. Decker was a director of the East India Company. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the mandarin duck with the ducks and geese in the genus &quot;Anas&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Anas galericulata&quot; and cited the earlier publications. The mandarin duck is now placed together with the wood duck in the genus &quot;Aix&quot; that was introduced in 1828 by the German ornithologist Friedrich Boie. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is the Ancient Greek word for an unknown diving bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet is from Latin &quot;galericulatum&quot; meaning a &quot;peruke&quot; or &quot;wig&quot;.

==Description==
The mandarin duck is among the more diminutive types of waterfowl, with a shorter height and smaller overall body size than the dabbling ducks, and is slightly smaller than its American wood duck relatives. The adult male has a petite, red bill, large white crescent above the eye and reddish face and &quot;whiskers&quot;. The male&#x27;s breast is purple with two vertical white bars, the flanks ruddy, and he has two orange feathers at the back (large feathers that stick up similar to boat sails). The female is similar to the female wood duck, with a grayish-lavender tone to her plumage, and a white eye-ring and stripe running back from the eye. The female is paler on the underside, has a small white flank stripe, and a pale tip to its bill.

Both the males and females have crests, but the purple crest is more pronounced on the male.Like many other species of ducks, the male undergoes a moult after the mating season into eclipse plumage. When in eclipse plumage, the male looks similar to the female but can be distinguished by its bright yellow-orange or red beak, lack of any crest, and a less-pronounced eye-stripe.

Mandarin ducklings are almost identical in appearance to wood ducklings, and very similar to mallard ducklings. The ducklings can be distinguished from mallard ducklings because the eye-stripe of mandarin ducklings (and wood ducklings) stops at the eye, while in mallard ducklings it reaches all the way to the bill.
===Mutations===
Various mutations of the mandarin duck are found in captivity. The most common is the white mandarin duck. Although the origin of this mutation is unknown, the constant pairing of related birds and selective breeding is presumed to have led to recessive gene combinations, leading in turn to genetic conditions including leucism.

==Distribution and habitat==
The species was once widespread in East Asia, but large-scale exports and the destruction of its forest habitat have reduced populations in eastern Russia and in China to below 1,000 pairs in each country; Japan, however, is thought to still hold some 5,000 pairs. The Asian populations are migratory, overwintering in lowland eastern China and southern Japan.

Specimens frequently escape from collections, and in the 20th century, a large, feral population was established in Great Britain; more recently, small numbers have bred in Ireland, concentrated in the parks of Dublin. Now, about 7,000 are in Britain. Owing to its different habitat preferences compared to native water birds, the mandarin duck appears to have had no negative impacts on native wildfowl as a result of its introduction to the UK, as it does not engage in competition with other ducks over their habitats.

Additional populations of mandarin ducks can be found on the European continent, the largest of which is in the region of Berlin. Isolated populations exist in the United States. The town of Black Mountain, North Carolina, has a limited population, and a free-flying feral population of several hundred mandarins exist in Sonoma County, California. This population is the result of several ducks escaping from captivity, then reproducing in the wild. In 2018, a single bird, dubbed Mandarin Patinkin, was seen in New York City&#x27;s Central Park.

The habitats it prefers in its breeding range are the dense, shrubby forested edges of rivers and lakes. It mostly occurs in low-lying areas, but it may breed in valleys at altitudes of up to . In winter, it additionally occurs in marshes, flooded fields, and open rivers. While it prefers fresh water, it may also be seen wintering in coastal lagoons and estuaries. In its introduced European range, it lives in more open habitat than in its native range, around the edges of lakes, water meadows, and cultivated areas with woods nearby.

==Behaviour==
Compared to other ducks, mandarins are shy birds, preferring to seek cover under trees such as overhanging willows, and form smaller flocks, but when accustomed to humans may exhibit bolder behaviour.
===Breeding===

In the wild, mandarin ducks breed in densely wooded areas near shallow lakes, marshes or ponds. They nest in cavities in trees close to water during the spring. A single clutch of nine to twelve eggs is laid in April or May. Although the male may defend the brooding female and his eggs during incubation, he himself does not incubate the eggs and leaves before they hatch. Shortly after the ducklings hatch, their mother flies to the ground and coaxes the ducklings to leap from the nest. After all of the ducklings are out of the tree, they will follow their mother to a nearby body of water.

===Food and feeding===

Mandarins feed by dabbling or walking on land. They mainly eat plants and seeds, especially beech mast. The species will also add snails, insects and small fish to its diet. The diet of mandarin ducks changes seasonally; in the fall and winter, they mostly eat acorns and grains. In the spring, they mostly eat insects, snails, fish and aquatic plants. In the summer, they eat dew worms, small fish, frogs, mollusks, and small snakes. They feed mainly near dawn or dusk, perching in trees or on the ground during the day.
===Conspecific brood parasitism===
Like many other bird species, Mandarin ducks display conspecific brood parasitism. Typically, Mandarin ducks lay their eggs in nests of their own relatives or other bird species. In the Zuojia Nature Reserve in Northeast China, 46.1% of Mandarin ducks were found to practice conspecific brood parasitism. Female ducks lay their eggs in different nests for a wide variety of reasons. For example, when there are nest limitations or there are little resources available, female ducks are more likely to practice conspecific brood parasitism. When females practice this behavior, they can benefit from a decrease in the costs from parental care and incubation. Additionally, female parasitic ducks can reduce their risks from predation. 

While there was speculation that larger clutch sizes can lead to an increase in resource competition, research has found that the number of parasite eggs had no negative influence on the success of eggs from the host. Over generations, conspecific brood parasitism can increase the net number of offsprings found within each generation. Overall, other duck species that have utilized this behavior to lay their eggs were able to increase their reproductive success by more than double.

==Threats==
Predation of the mandarin duck varies between different parts of its range. Mink, raccoon dogs, otters, polecats, Eurasian eagle-owls, and grass snakes are all predators of the mandarin duck. The greatest threat to the mandarin duck is habitat loss due to loggers. Hunters are also a threat to the mandarin duck, because often they are unable to recognize the mandarin in flight and as a result, many are shot by accident. Mandarin ducks are not hunted for food, but are still poached because their extreme beauty is prized.
==In culture==

===Chinese culture===
The Chinese refer to mandarin ducks as (), where () and () respectively stand for male and female mandarin ducks. In traditional Chinese culture, mandarin ducks are believed to be lifelong couples, unlike other species of ducks. Hence they are regarded as a symbol of conjugal affection and fidelity, and are frequently featured in Chinese art.

A Chinese proverb for loving couples uses the mandarin duck as a metaphor: &quot;Two mandarin ducks playing in water&quot; (). A mandarin duck symbol is also used in Chinese weddings because in traditional Chinese lore, they symbolize wedded bliss and fidelity. Because the male and female plumages of the mandarin duck are so unalike, is frequently used colloquially in Cantonese to mean an &quot;odd couple&quot; or &quot;unlikely pair&quot; – a mixture of two different types of the same category; for example, the drink and fried rice. Mandarin ducks featured on the flag of Weihaiwei during British rule.

===Korean culture===

For Koreans, mandarin ducks represent peace, fidelity, and plentiful offspring. Similar to the Chinese, they believe that these ducks mate for life. For these reasons, pairs of wooden-carved mandarin ducks called wedding ducks are often given as wedding gifts and play a significant role in Korean marriage.

===Japanese culture===
Similarly, in Japanese the ducks are called and are used in the phrase . In addition, the Crown Prince wears the Sokutai decorated with a pattern featuring &quot;oshidori&quot;.
