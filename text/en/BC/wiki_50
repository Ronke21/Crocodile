<text>The Brandenburg Concertos (BWV 1046–1051) by Johann Sebastian Bach are a collection of six instrumental works presented by Bach to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, in 1721 (though probably composed earlier). The original French title is Six Concerts Avec plusieurs instruments, meaning &quot;Six Concertos for several instruments&quot;. Some of the pieces feature several solo instruments in combination. They are widely regarded as some of the greatest orchestral compositions of the Baroque era.

== History ==
It is uncertain when most of the material for the Brandenburg Concertos was written. It is clear that the first movement of Concerto No. 1 (BWV 1046) was based on an introduction to Bach&#x27;s 1713 cantata &quot;Was mir behagt&quot;, and the second and last may have been as well. It also seems likely that Concerto No. 5 was the last to be written; it features a prominent harpsichord part, which is presumed to be for a new instrument ordered for Prince Leopold from the instrument-maker Michael Mietke and paid for by Bach in Berlin in 1719. Speculation regarding the composition dates of the other concertos varies, taking into account the styles of the pieces as well as the instrumentation Bach would have had available during his years prior to the date of the compiled manuscript.

In 1721, Bach compiled the six concertos, writing them almost entirely in his own hand instead of leaving the work to a copyist. He presented the collection to Christian Ludwig, Margrave of Brandenburg-Schwedt, under the title &quot;Six Concerts Avec plusieurs instruments&quot; (Six Concertos for several instruments) with a dedication dated 24 March. Translated from the original French, the first sentence of Bach&#x27;s dedication reads:

As I had the good fortune a few years ago to be heard by Your Royal Highness, at Your Highness&#x27;s commands, and as I noticed then that Your Highness took some pleasure in the little talents which Heaven has given me for Music, and as in taking Leave of Your Royal Highness, Your Highness deigned to honour me with the command to send Your Highness some pieces of my Composition: I have in accordance with Your Highness&#x27;s most gracious orders taken the liberty of rendering my most humble duty to Your Royal Highness with the present Concertos, which I have adapted to several instruments; begging Your Highness most humbly not to judge their imperfection with the rigour of that discriminating and sensitive taste, which everyone knows Him to have for musical works, but rather to take into benign Consideration the profound respect and the most humble obedience which I thus attempt to show Him.

It is likely that the performance this excerpt mentions happened during the trip Bach took to Berlin in 1719, to pay for the new Mietke harpsichord.

Bach&#x27;s titular reference to scoring the concertos for &quot;several instruments&quot; has drawn commentary. Christoph Wolff treats it as an understatement, observing that Bach used the &quot;widest imaginable spectrum of orchestral instruments. The modest title does not begin to suggest the degree of innovation exhibited in the daring combinations ... Every one of the six concertos set a precedent in its scoring, and every one was to remain without parallel.&quot; Boyd (1993) interprets it as an indication that the concertos are written in a Venetian style, &quot;with its greater opportunities for soloistic display ... &#x27;Concerti a quattro&#x27;, &#x27;Concerti a cinque&#x27; etc.&quot;, and also perhaps that Bach was indicating the number of &quot;different&quot; instruments, or that the sound was intended to evoke a larger orchestra even with only one player to a part. Heinrich Besseler has noted that the overall forces required (leaving aside the first concerto, which was rewritten for a special occasion) tallies exactly with the 17 players Bach had at his disposal in Köthen, although Wolff contradicts this: &quot;contrary to conventional wisdom, the collection does not reflect specific structure of ensembles available either to the margrave of Brandenburg or to the prince of Anhalt-Cöthen.&quot;

=== In later years ===
It is often asserted that Christian Ludwig lacked the musicians in his Berlin ensemble to perform the concertos, and that the score was left unused in the Margrave&#x27;s library until his death in 1734, but Boyd argues that the evidence does not necessarily support these assertions, and that &quot;it seems unlikely that Bach would have sent him six concertos totally unsuitable for his musicians to play.&quot; Nevertheless, the concertos were not included by name in the library inventory after Christian Ludwig&#x27;s death, and it is uncertain who they went to. The next owner we have a record of was Bach&#x27;s own pupil Johann Kirnberger, who left the collection to Princess Anna Amalia on his death, who subsequently bequeathed it to the Joachimsthal Gymnasium from which it was transferred to the Royal Library of Berlin (now the Berlin State Library) in 1914. The manuscript was nearly lost during World War II, while being transported for safekeeping to Prussia by train in the care of a librarian – the train came under aerial bombardment, and the librarian escaped from the train to a nearby forest, with the scores hidden under his coat. the manuscript remains in the Berlin State Library.

After Bach&#x27;s death only the fifth concerto received any widespread attention, probably due to the fashion for keyboard concertos; the rest were seemingly forgotten. The pieces were rediscovered by Siegfried Dehn, who found them in Princess Amalia&#x27;s library in 1849 and had them published for the first time the following year, the centenary of Bach&#x27;s death. However, this publication appears not to have spurred large numbers of performances, and those that did occur tended to adapt the instrumentation to the forces available to modern orchestras. The concertos&#x27; current place in the canon is instead owed to the advent of recording technology; the first recording of the complete set was made in 1936, directed by Adolf Busch, and the revival of interest in historically informed performance made the pieces popular for further recordings on period instruments. They have also been performed as chamber music, with one instrument per part, especially by groups using &quot;baroque instruments&quot; and historically informed techniques and practice. There is also an arrangement for four-hand piano duet by composer Max Reger.

A Karl Richter recording of Concerto No. 2 was sent into space in 1977 on the Voyager Golden Record.

In 2001, the piece came in at number 22 in the Classic 100 Original (ABC) listing. In 2007, all six of the concertos appeared on the Classic 100 Concerto (ABC) listing.

=== Concerto No. 1 in F major, BWV 1046 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 1mo à 2 Corni di Caccia, 3 Hautb: è Bassono, Violino Piccolo concertato, 2 Violini, una Viola è Violoncello, col Basso Continuo.
&quot;Instrumentation&quot;: two corni da caccia (natural horns), three oboes, bassoon, violino piccolo, two violins, viola and basso continuo (harpsichord, cello, viola da gamba and/or violone)

The &quot;Brandenburg Concerto&quot; No. 1, BWV 1046.2 (BWV 1046), is the only one in the collection with four movements. The concerto also exists in an alternative version, Sinfonia BWV 1046.1 (formerly BWV 1046a), which appears to have been composed during Bach&#x27;s years at Weimar. The Sinfonia, which lacks the third movement entirely, and the Polacca (or Poloinesse, polonaise) from the final movement, appears to have been intended as the opening of the cantata &quot;Was mir behagt, ist nur die muntre Jagd&quot;, BWV 208. This implies a date of composition possibly as early as the 1713 premiere of the cantata, although it could have been used for a subsequent revival.

The first movement can also be found as the sinfonia of a later cantata &quot;Falsche Welt, dir trau ich nicht&quot;, BWV 52, but in a version without the piccolo violin that is closer to Sinfonia BWV 1046a. The third movement was used as the opening chorus of the cantata &quot;Vereinigte Zwietracht der wechselnden Saiten&quot;, BWV 207, where the horns are replaced by trumpets.

=== Concerto No. 2 in F major, BWV 1047 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 2do à 1 Tromba, 1 Flauto, 1 Hautbois, 1 Violino, concertati, è 2 Violini, 1 Viola è Violone in Ripieno col Violoncello è Basso per il Cembalo.
&quot;Concertino&quot;: natural trumpet in F, recorder, oboe, violin

&quot;Ripieno&quot;: two violins, viola, violone, cello and harpsichord (as basso continuo)

The trumpet part is still considered one of the most difficult in the entire repertoire, and was originally written for a clarino specialist, almost certainly the court trumpeter in Köthen, Johann Ludwig Schreiber. After clarino skills were lost in the eighteenth century and before the rise of the historically informed performance movement of the late twentieth century, the part was often played on the piccolo trumpet in B, and occasionally on a French horn.

The clarino does not play in the second movement, as is common practice in baroque era concerti. This is due to its construction, which allows it to play only in major keys. Because concerti often move to a minor key in the second movement, concerti that include the instrument in their first movement and are from the period before the valved trumpet was commonly used usually exclude the trumpet from the second movement.

The first movement of this concerto was chosen as the first musical piece to be played on the Voyager Golden Record, a phonograph record containing a broad sample of Earth&#x27;s common sounds, languages, and music sent into outer space with the two Voyager probes. The first movement served as a theme for &quot;Great Performances&quot; in the early-to-mid 1980s, while the third movement served as the theme for William F. Buckley Jr.&#x27;s &quot;Firing Line&quot;; a revival featuring Margaret Hoover also used the first movement.

Recent research has revealed that this concerto is based on a lost chamber music version for quintet called &quot;Concerto da camera in Fa Maggiore&quot; (Chamber Concerto in F major), whose catalogue number is BWV 1047R. It is similar to the orchestral version, in that the trumpet, flute, oboe and solo violin parts are the same, but the orchestra part has been arranged for basso continuo (or piano) by Klaus Hofmann. This reconstructed quintet arrangement is also the very first piano reduction of the 2nd Brandenburg Concerto ever published by Bärenreiter Verlag (Product Number BA 5196).

=== Concerto No. 3 in G major, BWV 1048 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 3zo à tre Violini, tre Viole, è tre Violoncelli col Basso per il Cembalo.
&quot;Instrumentation&quot;: three violins, three violas, three cellos, and harpsichord (as basso continuo)

The second movement consists of a single measure with the two chords that make up a &#x27;Phrygian half cadence&#x27; and although there is no direct evidence to support it, it is likely that these chords were meant to surround or follow a cadenza improvised by the harpsichord or a solo violin player. Modern performance approaches range from simply playing the cadence with minimal ornamentation (treating it as a sort of &quot;musical semicolon&quot;), to cadenzas varying in length from under a minute to over two minutes. Occasionally, other slow movements from Bach pieces, such as the Largo from the Sonata for Violin and Continuo in G, BWV 1021 and the Largo from the Sonata for Violin and Obbligato Harpsichord in G major, BWV 1019, are substituted for the second movement as they contain an identical &#x27;Phrygian cadence&#x27; as the closing chords. 

The outer movements use the ritornello form found in many instrumental and vocal works of the time. The first movement can also be found in reworked form as the sinfonia of the cantata &quot;Ich liebe den Höchsten von ganzem Gemüte&quot;, BWV 174, with the addition of three oboes and two horns.

This concerto is the shortest of the six.

=== Concerto No. 4 in G major, BWV 1049 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 4to à Violino Principale, due Fiauti d&#x27;Echo, due Violini, una Viola è Violone in Ripieno, Violoncello è Continuo.
&quot;Concertino&quot;: violin and two recorders (described in the original score as &quot;flauti d&#x27;echo&quot;).

&quot;Ripieno&quot;: two violins, violas, violone, cellos and basso continuo (harpsichord and/or viola da gamba)

The violin part in this concerto is extremely virtuosic in the first and third movements. In the second movement, the violin provides a bass when the concertino group plays unaccompanied.

It has been debated what instrument Bach had in mind for the &quot;fiauti d&#x27;echo&quot; parts. Nowadays these are usually played on alto recorders, although transverse flutes are sometimes used instead: it is also theorised Bach&#x27;s original intent may have been the flageolet. In some performances, such as those conducted by Nikolaus Harnoncourt, the two recorders are positioned offstage, thus giving an &quot;echo&quot; effect.

Bach adapted the 4th Brandenburg concerto as a harpsichord concerto, BWV 1057.

=== Concerto No. 5 in D major, BWV 1050 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 5to à une Traversiere, une Violino principale, une Violino è una Viola in ripieno, Violoncello, Violone è Cembalo concertato.
&quot;Concertino&quot;: harpsichord, violin, flute

&quot;Ripieno&quot;: violin, viola, cello and violone

The harpsichord is both a concertino and a ripieno instrument. In the concertino passages the part is obbligato; in the ripieno passages it has a figured bass part and plays continuo.

This concerto makes use of a popular chamber music ensemble of the time (flute, violin, and harpsichord), which Bach used on its own for the middle movement. It is believed that it was written in 1719, to show off a new harpsichord by Michael Mietke which Bach had brought back from Berlin for the Köthen court. It is also thought that Bach wrote it for a competition at Dresden with the French composer and organist Louis Marchand; in the central movement, Bach uses one of Marchand&#x27;s themes. Marchand fled before the competition could take place, apparently scared off in the face of Bach&#x27;s great reputation for virtuosity and improvisation.

The concerto is well suited throughout to showing off the qualities of a fine harpsichord and the virtuosity of its player, but especially in the lengthy solo cadenza to the first movement. It seems almost certain that Bach, considered a great organ and harpsichord virtuoso, was the harpsichord soloist at the premiere. Scholars have seen in this work the origins of the solo keyboard concerto as it is the first example of a concerto with a solo keyboard part.

An earlier version, BWV 1050a, exists, and has many small differences from its later cousin, but no major difference in structure or instrumentation. It is dated ca. 1720–21.

=== Concerto No. 6 in B-flat major, BWV 1051 ===
Title on autograph score: Concerto 6to a due Viole da Braccio, due Viole da Gamba, Violoncello, Violone e Cembalo.
&quot;Instrumentation&quot;: two viole da braccio, two viole da gamba, cello, violone, and harpsichord

The absence of violins is unusual, but it is also found in a cantata written at Wiemar &quot;Gleichwie der Regen und Schnee vom Himmel fällt&quot;, BWV 18.
Viola da braccio means the normal viola, and is used here to distinguish it from the viola da gamba. The viola da gamba was already an old-fashioned instrument when Bach compiled the Brandenburg Concertos in 1721: one reason for using it may have been the interest which his employer, Prince Leopold, had in the instrument. Nikolaus Harnoncourt speculated that Prince Leopold wished to play with his orchestra and that Bach&#x27;s provision of such music was somehow related to the fact that he was looking for jobs elsewhere. By upsetting the balance of the musical roles, he would be released from his servitude as Kapellmeister.

The two violas start the first movement with a vigorous subject in close canon, and as the movement progresses, the other instruments are gradually drawn into the seemingly uninterrupted steady flow of melodic invention which shows the composer&#x27;s mastery of polyphony. The two violas da gamba are silent in the second movement, leaving the texture of a trio sonata for two violas and continuo, although the cello has a decorated version of the continuo bass line. In the last movement, the spirit of the gigue underlies everything, as it did in the finale of the fifth concerto.

<text>Fort McHenry is a historical American coastal pentagonal bastion fort on Locust Point, now a neighborhood of Baltimore, Maryland. It is best known for its role in the War of 1812, when it successfully defended Baltimore Harbor from an attack by the British navy from Chesapeake Bay on September 13–14, 1814.

The fort was built in 1798 and was used continuously by U.S. armed forces through World War I and by the United States Coast Guard in World War II. It was designated a national park in 1925, and, in 1939, was redesignated a U.S. National Monument.

During the War of 1812, an American storm flag, , was flown over Fort McHenry during the British bombardment of the fort. The flag was replaced early on the morning of September 14, 1814, with a larger American garrison flag, . The larger flag signaled American victory over the British in the Battle of Baltimore.

The sight of the ensign inspired Francis Scott Key to write the poem &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot; that was later set to music in the song &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;, which was later known and designated as &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, the national anthem of the United States.

==History==
===18th century===
Fort McHenry was built on the site of the former Fort Whetstone, which was used to defend Baltimore from 1776 to 1797. Fort Whetstone stood on Whetstone Point in the residential and industrial area of present-day Locust Point in Baltimore, which juts into the opening of Baltimore Harbor between the basin at the present-day Inner Harbor and Northwest branch on the north side and the Middle and Ferry (now Southern) branches of the Patapsco River on the south side.

The Frenchman Jean Foncin designed the fort in 1798, and it was built between 1798 and 1800. The new fort&#x27;s purpose was to improve the defenses of the increasingly important Port of Baltimore from future enemy attacks.

The new fort was a bastioned pentagon, surrounded by a dry moat—a deep, broad trench. The moat would serve as a shelter from which infantry might defend the fort from a land attack. In case of such an attack on this first line of defense, each point, or bastion could provide a crossfire of cannon and small arms fire.

Fort McHenry was named after early American statesman James McHenry (1753–1816), a Scots-Irish immigrant and surgeon-soldier. He was a delegate to the Continental Congress from Maryland and a signer of the United States Constitution. Afterwards, he was appointed United States Secretary of War (1796–1800), serving under Presidents George Washington and John Adams.

===19th century===
====War of 1812====
Beginning at 6:00 a.m. on September 13, 1814, British warships under the command of Vice Admiral Alexander Cochrane continuously bombarded Fort McHenry for 25 hours. The American defenders had 18-, 24- and 32-pounder () cannons. The British guns had a range of , and the British rockets had a range, but neither guns nor rockets were accurate. The British ships were unable to pass Fort McHenry and penetrate Baltimore Harbor because of its defenses, including a chain of 22 sunken ships, and the American cannons. The British vessels were able to fire their rockets and mortars at the fort only at the weapons&#x27; maximum range. The poor accuracy on both sides resulted in very little damage to either side before the British, having depleted their ammunition, ceased their attack on the morning of September 14. Thus the naval part of the British invasion of Baltimore had been repulsed. Only one British warship, a bomb vessel, received a direct hit from the fort&#x27;s return fire, which wounded one crewman.

The Americans, under the command of Major George Armistead, lost four killed—one woman was cut in half by a bomb as she carried supplies to the troops—and 24 wounded, including one black soldier, Private William Williams. At one point during the bombardment, a bomb crashed through the fort&#x27;s powder magazine. However, either the rain extinguished the fuse or the bomb was a dud.

====Star-Spangled Banner====
Washington lawyer Francis Scott Key went to Baltimore to negotiate the release of Dr. William Beans, a civilian prisoner of war, and there he witnessed the bombardment from a nearby truce ship. An oversized American flag had been sewn by Mary Pickersgill for $405.90 in anticipation of the British attack on the fort. Key saw the flag emerge intact in the dawn of September 14, and he was so moved that he began to compose &quot;Defence of Fort M&#x27;Henry&quot; set to the tune &quot;To Anacreon in Heaven&quot;. It was renamed &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot; and became the United States&#x27; national anthem, and has even been translated into various languages, targeted mostly for US immigrants who later acquired American citizenship.

====Civil War====
During the American Civil War the area where Fort McHenry sits served as a military prison, confining both Confederate soldiers, as well as a large number of Maryland political figures who were criticizing then President Abraham Lincoln. The imprisoned included newly elected Baltimore Mayor George William Brown, the city council, and the new police commissioner, George P. Kane, and members of the Maryland General Assembly along with several newspaper editors and owners. Francis Scott Key&#x27;s grandson, Francis Key Howard, was one of these political detainees. Some of the cells used still exist and can be visited at the fort. Fort McHenry also served to train artillery at this time; this service is the origin of the Rodman guns presently located and displayed at the fort.

On 25 May 1861 John Merryman was arrested in Baltimore County and imprisoned in Fort McHenry. Merryman had had a role in destroying bridges in Maryland to impede the movement of Union troops. Merryman petitioned Supreme Court Chief Justice Roger B. Taney for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot;, and Taney granted the petition, demanding that Merryman appear in his courtroom the next day and sending U.S. Marshals to the fort to enforce the ruling. A famous and dramatic standoff then occurred at the gates of the fort between the Federal Marshals and General George Cadwalader, the commander of Union troops of the Fort. The commander refused to comply with the order on the grounds that he was acting under orders from President Abraham Lincoln, who had suspended habeas corpus. The court case, &quot;Ex parte Merryman&quot;, remains unresolved, and the Executive Branch continued to refuse to comply with Taney&#x27;s ruling.

===20th century===

====World War I====
During World War I, an additional hundred-odd buildings were built on the land surrounding the fort in order to convert the entire facility into an enormous U.S. Army hospital for the treatment of troops returning home from the European conflict. None of those buildings remain, while the original fort has been preserved and restored to essentially its condition during the War of 1812.

====World War II====
During World War II, Fort McHenry served as a Coast Guard base. Used for training, the historic sections remained open to the public.

====National monument====

The fort was made a national park in 1925; on August 11, 1939, it was redesignated a &quot;National Monument and Historic Shrine&quot;, the only such doubly designated place in the United States. It was placed on the National Register of Historic Places on October 15, 1966. It has become national tradition that when a new flag is designed it first flies over Fort McHenry. The first official 49- and 50-star American flags were flown over the fort and are still located on the premises.

===Today===
The fort has become a center of recreation for the Baltimore locals as well as a prominent tourist destination. Thousands of visitors come each year to see the &quot;Birthplace of the Star-Spangled Banner.&quot; It&#x27;s easily accessible by water taxi from the popular Baltimore Inner Harbor. However, to prevent abuse of the parking lots at the Fort, the National Park Service does not permit passengers to take the water taxi back to the Inner Harbor unless they have previously used it to arrive at the monument.

Several authorized archaeological digs have been conducted, and found artifacts are on display in one of the buildings surrounding the Parade Ground. These structures, as well as the Visitor Center, have numerous other exhibits as well that show the fort&#x27;s use over time.

Every September, the City of Baltimore commemorates Defenders Day in honor of the Battle of Baltimore. It is the biggest celebration of the year at the Fort, accompanied by a weekend of programs, events, and fireworks.

In 2005 the living history volunteer unit, the Fort McHenry Guard, was awarded the George B. Hartzog award for serving the National Park Service as the best volunteer unit. Among the members of the unit is Martin O&#x27;Malley, the former mayor of Baltimore and Governor of Maryland, who was made the unit&#x27;s honorary colonel in 2003.

The flag that flew over Fort McHenry, the Star-Spangled Banner Flag, has deteriorated to an extremely fragile condition. After undergoing restoration at the National Museum of American History, it is now on display there in a special exhibit that allows it to lie at a slight angle in dim light.

The United States Code currently authorizes Fort McHenry&#x27;s closure to the public in the event of a national emergency for use by the military for the duration of such an emergency.

In 2013, Fort McHenry National Monument and Historic Shrine was honored with its own quarter under the America the Beautiful Quarters Program.

On September 10–16, 2014, Fort McHenry celebrated the bicentennial of the writing of the Star-Spangled Banner called the Star-Spangled Spectacular. The event included a parade of tall ships, a large fireworks show, and the Navy&#x27;s Blue Angels

, restoration efforts began to preserve the original brick used in construction of the Fort, primarily through mortar replacement.

On August 26, 2020, when due to the COVID-19 pandemic a normal Republican National Convention could not be held, vice president Mike Pence held his acceptance speech at Fort McHenry after being nominated for a second term as vice president of the United States.

<text>A ventifact (also wind-faceted stone, windkanter) is a rock that has been abraded, pitted, etched, grooved, or polished by wind-driven sand or ice crystals. The word “Ventifact” is derived from the Latin word “Ventus” meaning ‘wind’. These geomorphic features are most typically found in arid environments where there is little vegetation to interfere with aeolian particle transport, where there are frequently strong winds, and where there is a steady but not overwhelming supply of sand.
Ventifacts can be abraded to eye-catching natural sculptures such as the main features of the White Desert National Park near Farafra Oasis in Egypt. In moderately tall, isolated rock outcrops, mushroom shaped pillars of rock may form as the outcrop is eroded by saltating sand grains. This occurs because, even in strong winds, sand grains can&#x27;t be continuously held in the air. Instead, the particles bounce along the ground, rarely reaching higher than a few feet above the Earth. Over time, the bouncing sand grains can erode the lower portions of a ventifact, while leaving a larger less eroded cap. The resulting forms thus frequently resemble fantastical stone mushrooms.

Individual stones, such as those forming desert pavement, are often found with grooved, etched, or polished surfaces where these same wind-driven processes have slowly worn away the rock. 

Ventifacts are typically of three types -
* Einkanters having one polished side (excluding the bottom part) (German word ‘ein’ means ‘one’)
* Zweinkanters having two polished sides (excluding the bottom part) (German word ‘zwei’ means ‘two’)
* Dreinkanters having three polished surface (excluding the polished surface at bottom) those meet up at sharp angles (German word ‘drei’ means ‘three’) 

When ancient ventifacts are preserved without being moved or disturbed, they may serve as a paleo-wind indicators. The wind direction at the time the ventifact formed will be parallel to grooves or striations cut into the rock. 

Ventifacts have also been discovered on Mars, where such sharp immobile rocks have caused significant damage to the wheels of the &quot;Curiosity&quot; rover. An example of a Martian ventifact was named Jake Matijevic. By analyzing its shape, it was possible to reconstruct the main wind direction which sculpted the rock.

<text>Music of Russia denotes music produced from Russia and/or by Russians. Russia is a large and culturally diverse country, with many ethnic groups, each with their own locally developed music. Russian music also includes significant contributions from ethnic minorities, who populated the Russian Empire, the Soviet Union and modern-day Russia. Russian music went through a long history, beginning with ritual folk songs and the sacred music of the Russian Orthodox Church. The 19th century saw the rise of highly acclaimed Russian classical music, and in the 20th century major contributions by various composers such as Igor Stravinsky as well as Soviet composers, while the modern styles of Russian popular music developed, including Russian rock, Russian hip hop and Russian pop.

==History==
===Early history===

Written documents exist that describe the musical culture of the Rus&#x27;. The most popular kind of instruments in medieval Russia were thought to have been string instruments, such as the gusli or gudok. Archeologists have uncovered examples of these instruments in the Novgorod region dating as early as 11th century. (Novgorod republic had deep traditions in music; its most popular folk hero and the chief character of several epics was Sadko, a gusli player). Other instruments in common use include flutes (svirel), and percussive instruments such as the treshchotka and the buben. The most popular form of music, however was singing. Bylinas (epic ballads) about folk heroes such as Sadko, Ilya Muromets, and others were often sung, sometimes to instrumental accompaniment. The texts of some of these epics have been recorded.

In the time the Tsardom of Russia, two major genres formed Russian music: the sacred music of the Orthodox Church and secular music used for entertainment. The sacred music draws its tradition from the Byzantine Empire, with key elements being used in Russian Orthodox bell ringing, as well as choral singing. Neumes were developed for musical notation, and as a result several examples of medieval sacred music have survived to this day, among them two stichera composed by Tsar Ivan IV in the 16th century.

Secular music included the use of musical instruments such as fipple flutes and string instruments, and was usually played on holidays initially by skomorokhs – jesters and minstrels who entertained the nobility. During the reactionary period of the Great Russian Schism in the 17th century, skomorokhs along with their form of secular music were banned from plying their trade numerous times, their instruments were burned and those who disagree with Alexis of Russia&#x27;s 1648 law &quot;About the correction of morals and the destruction of superstitions&quot; (&quot;Об исправлении нравов и уничтожении суеверий&quot;) were punished physically first and then were to be deported to Malorossia (modern Ukraine), but despite these restrictions, some of their traditions survived to the present day.

===18th and 19th century: Russian classical music===


Russia was a late starter in developing a native tradition of classical music due to its geographic remoteness from Western Europe and the proscription by the Orthodox Church against secular music. Beginning in the reign of Ivan IV, the Imperial Court invited Western composers and musicians to fill this void. By the time of Peter I, these artists were a regular fixture at Court. While not personally inclined toward music, Peter saw European music as a mark of civilization and a way of Westernizing the country; his establishment of the Western-style city of Saint Petersburg helped foster its spread to the rest of the upper classes. A craze for Italian opera at Court during the reigns of Empresses Elisabeth and Catherine also helped spread interest in Western music among the aristocracy. This craze became so pervasive that many were not even aware that Russian composers existed.

The focus on European music meant that Russian composers had to write in Western style if they wanted their compositions to be performed. Their success at this was variable due to a lack of familiarity with European rules of composition. Some composers were able to travel abroad for training, usually to Italy, and learned to compose vocal and instrumental works in the Italian Classical tradition popular in the day. These include ethnic Ukrainian composers Dmitri Bortniansky, Maksim Berezovsky and Artem Vedel.

The first great Russian composer to exploit native Russian music traditions into the realm of secular music was Mikhail Glinka (1804–1857), who composed the early Russian language operas &quot;Ivan Susanin&quot; and &quot;Ruslan and Lyudmila&quot;. They were neither the first operas in the Russian language nor the first by a Russian, but they gained fame for relying on distinctively Russian tunes and themes and being in the vernacular.

Russian folk music became the primary source for the younger generation composers. A group that called itself &quot;The Mighty Five&quot;, headed by Balakirev (1837–1910) and including Rimsky-Korsakov (1844–1908), Mussorgsky (1839–81), Borodin (1833–87) and César Cui (1835–1918), proclaimed its purpose to compose and popularize Russian national traditions in classical music. Among the Mighty Five&#x27;s most notable compositions were the operas &quot;The Snow Maiden&quot; (&quot;Snegurochka&quot;), &quot;Sadko&quot;, &quot;Boris Godunov&quot;, &quot;Prince Igor&quot;, &quot;Khovanshchina&quot;, and symphonic suite &quot;Scheherazade&quot;. Many of the works by Glinka and the Mighty Five were based on Russian history, folk tales and literature, and are regarded as masterpieces of romantic nationalism in music.

This period also saw the foundation of the Russian Musical Society (RMS) in 1859, led by composer-pianists Anton (1829–94) and Nikolay Rubinstein (1835–81). The Mighty Five was often presented as the Russian Music Society&#x27;s rival, with the Five embracing their Russian national identity and the RMS being musically more conservative. However the RMS founded Russia&#x27;s first Conservatories in St Petersburg and in Moscow: the former trained the great Russian composer Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky (1840–93), best known for ballets like &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, &quot;Sleeping Beauty&quot;, and &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. He remains Russia&#x27;s best-known composer outside Russia. Easily the most famous successor in his style is Sergei Rachmaninoff (1873–1943), who studied at the Moscow Conservatory (where Tchaikovsky himself taught).

The late 19th and early 20th century saw the third wave of Russian classics: Igor Stravinsky (1882–1971), Alexander Scriabin (1872–1915), Sergei Prokofiev (1891–1953) and Dmitri Shostakovich (1906–1975). They were experimental in style and musical language. Stravinsky was particularly influential on his contemporaries and subsequent generations of composers, both in Russia and across Europe and the United States. Stravinsky permanently emigrated after the Russian revolution. Although Prokofiev also left Russia in 1918, he eventually returned and contributed to Soviet music.

In the late 19th to early 20th centuries, the so-called &quot;romance songs&quot; became very popular. The greatest and most popular singers of the &quot;romances&quot; usually sang in operas at the same time. The most popular was Fyodor Shalyapin. Singers usually composed music and wrote the lyrics, as did Alexander Vertinsky, Konstantin Sokolsky, and Pyotr Leshchenko.

===20th century: Soviet music===


After the Russian Revolution, Russian music changed dramatically. The early 1920s were the era of avant-garde experiments, inspired by the &quot;revolutionary spirit&quot; of the era. New trends in music (like music based on synthetic chords) were proposed by enthusiastic clubs such as Association for Contemporary Music. Arseny Avraamov pioneered the graphical sound, and Leon Theremin invented thereminvox, one of the early electronic instruments.

However, in the 1930s, under the regime of Joseph Stalin, music was forced to be contained within certain boundaries of content and innovation. Classicism was favoured, and experimentation discouraged. (A notable example: Shostakovich&#x27;s veristic opera Lady Macbeth of the Mtsensk District was denounced in Pravda newspaper as &quot;formalism&quot; and soon removed from theatres for years).

The musical patriarchs of the era were Sergei Prokofiev, Dmitri Shostakovich, Aram Khachaturian and Alexander Alexandrov. The latter is best known for composing the Anthem of the Soviet Union and the song &quot;The Sacred War&quot;. With time, a wave of younger Soviet composers, such as Georgy Sviridov, Alfred Schnittke, and Sofia Gubaidulina took the forefront due to the rigorous Soviet education system. The Union of Soviet Composers was established in 1932 and became the major regulatory body for Soviet music.

Jazz was introduced to Soviet audiences by Valentin Parnakh in the 1920s. Singer Leonid Uteosov and film score composer Isaak Dunayevsky helped its popularity, especially with the popular comedy movie &quot;Jolly Fellows&quot;, which featured a jazz soundtrack. Eddie Rosner, Oleg Lundstrem and others contributed to Soviet jazz music.
Film soundtracks produced a significant part of popular Soviet/Russian songs of the time, as well as of orchestral and experimental music. The 1930s saw Prokofiev&#x27;s scores for Sergei Eisenstein&#x27;s epic movies, and also soundtracks by Isaak Dunayevsky that ranged from classical pieces to popular jazz. Notable film composers from the late Soviet era included Vladimir Dashkevich, Tikhon Khrennikov, Alexander Zatsepin, and Gennady Gladkov, among others.

Among the notable people of Soviet electronic music were Vyacheslav Mescherin, creator of Electronic Instruments Orchestra, and ambient composer Eduard Artemiev, best known for his scores for Andrei Tarkovsky&#x27;s films &quot;Solaris&quot;, &quot;Mirror&quot;, and &quot;Stalker&quot;.

The 1960s and 1970s saw the beginning of modern Russian pop and rock music. It started with the wave of VIAs (vocal-instrumental ensembles), a specific sort of music bands performing radio-friendly pop, rock and folk, composed by members of the Union of Composers and approved by censorship. This wave begun with Pojuschie Gitary and Pesnyary; popular VIA bands also included Tcvety, Zemlyane and Verasy. That period of music also saw individual pop stars such as Iosif Kobzon, Sofia Rotaru, Alla Pugacheva, Valery Leontiev, Yuri Antonov. Many of them remain popular to this day. They were the mainstream of Soviet music media, headliners of festivals such as Song of the Year, Sopot, and Golden Orpheus. The year 1977 saw also establishment of Moskovsky Komsomolets hit parade, the Russia&#x27;s first music chart.
Music publishing and promotion in the Soviet Union was a state monopoly. To earn money and fame from their talent, Soviet musicians had to assign to the state-owned label Melodiya. This meant accepting certain boundaries of experimentation, that is, the family-friendly performance and politically neutral lyrics favoured by censors. Meanwhile, with the arrival of new sound recording technologies, it became possible for common fans to record and exchange their music via magnetic tape recorders. This helped underground music subculture (such as bard and rock music) to flourish despite being ignored by the state-owned media.

&quot;Bardic&quot; or &quot;authors&#x27; song&quot; (&quot;авторская песня&quot;) is an umbrella term for the singer-songwriter movement that arose at the early 1960s. It can be compared to the American folk revival movement of the 60s, with their simple single-guitar arrangements and poetical lyrics. Initially ignored by the state media, bards like Vladimir Vysotsky, Bulat Okudzhava, Alexander Galich gained so much popularity that they finished being distributed by the state owned Melodiya record company. The largest festival of bard music is Grushinsky festival, held annually since 1968.

Rock music came to the Soviet Union in the late 1960s with Beatlemania, and many rock bands arose during the late 1970s, such as Mashina Vremeni, Aquarium, and Autograph. Unlike the VIAs, these bands were not allowed to publish their music, and remained underground. The &quot;golden age&quot; of Russian rock is widely considered to have been the 1980s. Censorship was mitigated, rock clubs opened in Leningrad and Moscow, and soon rock became mainstream. Popular bands of that time include Kino, Alisa, Aria, DDT, Nautilus Pompilius, and Grazhdanskaya Oborona. New wave and post-punk were the trend in 80s Russian rock.
Soviet and Russian conservatories have turned out generations of world-renowned soloists. Among the best known are violinists David Oistrakh and Gidon Kremer, cellist Mstislav Rostropovich, pianists Vladimir Horowitz, Sviatoslav Richter, and Emil Gilels, and vocalist Galina Vishnevskaya.

===21st century: modern Russian music===

Russian pop music is well developed, and enjoys mainstream success via pop music media such as MTV Russia, Muz TV and various radio stations. Right after the fall of the Iron Wall, artists, like Christian Ray, took an active political stance, supporting the first president Boris Yeltsin. A number of pop artists have broken through in recent years. The Russian duet t.A.T.u. is the most successful Russian pop band of its time. They have reached number one in many countries around the world with several of their singles and albums. Other popular artists include the Eurovision 2008 winner Dima Bilan, as well as Valery Meladze, Grigory Leps, VIA Gra, Nyusha, Vintage, Philipp Kirkorov, Vitas and Alsou. Music producers like Igor Krutoy, Maxim Fadeev, Ivan Shapovalov, Igor Matvienko, and Konstantin Meladze control a major share of Russia&#x27;s pop music market, in some ways continuing the Soviet style of artist management. On the other side, some independent acts such as Neoclubber use new-era promo tools to avoid these old-fashioned Soviet ways of reaching their fans. Russian girl trio Serebro are one of the most popular Russian acts to dominate charts outside of the European market. The group&#x27;s most known single &quot;Mama Lover&quot; placed in the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Charts, becoming the first Russian act to chart since t.A.T.u.&#x27;s single &quot; All About Us&quot;.

Russian production companies, such as Hollywood World, have collaborated with western music stars, creating a new, more globalized space for music.

The rock music scene has gradually evolved from the united movement into several different subgenres similar to those found in the West. There are youth pop rock and alternative rock (Mumiy Troll, Zemfira, Splean, Bi-2, Zveri). There are also punk rock, ska and grunge (Korol i Shut, Pilot, Leningrad, Distemper, Elisium). The heavy metal scene has grown substantially, with new bands playing power and progressive metal (Catharsis, Epidemia, Shadow Host, Mechanical Poet), and pagan metal (Arkona, Butterfly Temple, Temnozor).

Rock music media has become prevalent in modern Russia. The most notable is Nashe Radio, which promotes classic rock and pop punk. Its &quot;Chart Dozen&quot; (Чартова дюжина) is the main rock chart in Russia, and its Nashestvie rock festival attracts around 100,000 fans annually and was dubbed &quot;Russian Woodstock&quot; by the media. Others include A-One TV channel, specializing in alternative music and hardcore. It has promoted bands like Amatory, Tracktor Bowling and Slot, and has awarded many of them with its Russian Alternative Music Prize. Radio Maximum broadcasts both Russian and western modern pop and rock.

Other types of music include folk rock (Melnitsa), trip hop (Linda) and reggae (Jah Division). Hip hop/rap is represented by Bad Balance, Kasta, Ligalize, Mnogotochie, KREC and others. An experimental rapcore scene is headlined by Dolphin and Kirpichi, while Moscow Death Brigade is a relevant techno /rap/punk band, well known for its stance against racism, sexism and homophobia. Other bands like Siberian Meat Grinder shares an experimental style of music.

A specific, exclusively Russian kind of music has emerged, which mixes criminal songs, bard and romance music. It is labelled &quot;Russian chanson&quot; (a neologism popularized by its main promoter, Radio Chanson). Its main artists include Mikhail Krug, Mikhail Shufutinsky, and Alexander Rosenbaum. With lyrics about daily life and society, and frequent romanticisation of the criminal underworld, chanson is especially popular among adult males of the lower social class.

Electronic music in modern Russia is underdeveloped in comparison to other genres. This is mostly due to a lack of promotion. There are some independent underground acts performing IDM, downtempo, house, trance and dark psytrance (including tracker music scene), and broadcasting their work via internet radio. They include Parasense, Fungus Funk, Kindzadza, Lesnikov-16, Yolochnye Igrushki, Messer Für Frau Müller and Zedd (Russian-German artist). Of the few artists that have broken through to the mainstream media, there are PPK and DJ Groove, that exploit Soviet movie soundtracks for their dance remixes. In the 2000s the Darkwave and Industrial scene, closely related to Goth subculture, has become prevalent, with such artists as Dvar, Otto Dix, Stillife, Theodor Bastard, Roman Rain, Shmeli and Biopsyhoz. Hardbass, an offshoot of UK Hard House originating in Russia in the late 1990s, has spread internationally via the internet, with acts such as Hard Bass School, &amp; XS Project amassing significant followings.

The profile of classical or concert hall music has to a considerable degree been eclipsed by on one hand the rise of commercial popular music in Russia, and on the other its own lack of promotion since the collapse of the USSR. Yet a number of composers born in the 1950s and later have made some impact, notably Leonid Desyatnikov, who became the first composer in decades to have a new opera commissioned by the Bolshoi Theatre (&quot;The Children of Rosenthal&quot;, 2005), and whose music has been championed by Gidon Kremer and Roman Mints. Meanwhile, Gubaidulina, amongst several former-Soviet composers of her generation, continues to maintain a high profile outside Russia composing several prestigious and well-received works including &quot;In tempus praesens&quot; (2007) for the violinist Anne-Sophie Mutter.

The early 2000s saw a boom of musicals in Russia. &quot;Notre-Dame de Paris&quot;, &quot;Nord-Ost&quot;, &quot;Roméo et Juliette&quot;, and &quot;We Will Rock You&quot; were constantly performed in Moscow theatres at the time. The popularity of musicals was hampered by the 2002 Moscow theater hostage crisis and was only revived at the end of the decade.

2010s saw the rise of popularity of Russian hip hop, especially rap battles on the internet by artists like Oxxxymiron and Gnoyny, among others.

==Ethnic roots music==
Russia today is a multi-ethnic state with over 100 ethnicities. Some of these ethnic groups has their own indigenous folk, sacred and in some cases art music, which can loosely be categorized together under the guise of ethnic roots music, or folk music. This category can further be broken down into folkloric (modern adaptations of folk material, and authentic presentations of ethnic music).

===Adygea===
In recent years, Adygea has seen the formation of a number of new musical institutions. These include two orchestras, one of which (Russkaya Udal) uses folk instruments, and a chamber music theater.

Adygea&#x27;s national anthem was written by Iskhak Shumafovich Mashbash with music by Umar Khatsitsovich Tkhabisimov.

===Altay===
Altay is a Central Asian region, known for traditional epics and a number of folk instruments.

===Bashkir===
The first major study of Bashkir music appeared in 1897, when ethnographer Rybakov S.G. wrote &quot;Music and Songs of the Ural&#x27;s Muslims and Studies of Their Way of Life&quot;. Later, Lebedinskiy L.N. collected numerous folk songs in Bashkortostan beginning in 1930. The 1968 foundation of the Ufa State Institute of Arts sponsored research in the field.

The kurai is the most important instrument in the Bashkir ensemble.

===Buryatia===
The Buryats of the far east is known for distinctive folk music which uses the two-stringed horsehead fiddle, or morin khuur. The style has no polyphony and has little melodic innovation. Narrative structures are very common, many of them long epics which claim to be the last song of a famous hero, such as in the &quot;Last Song of Rinchin Dorzhin&quot;. Modern Buryat musicians include the band Uragsha, which uniquely combines Siberian and Russian language lyrics with rock and Buryat folk songs, and Namgar, who is firmly rooted in the folk tradition but also explores connections to other musical cultures.

===Chechnya===

Alongside the Chechen rebellion of the 1990s came a resurgence in Chechen national identity, of which music is a major part. People like Said Khachukayev became prominent promoting Chechen music.

The Chechen national anthem is said to be &quot;Death or Freedom&quot;, an ancient song of uncertain origin.

In April 2024, it was reported that Minister of Culture Musa Dadayev had been instructed by head of Chechnya Ramzan Kadyrov to restrict music to specific tempos to &quot;conform to the Chechen mentality and sense of rhythm&quot; by 1 June, banning any vocal, musical, or choreographic works not composed between 80 and 116 beats per minute (BPM). Dadayev later stated that this was meant to be guidance for the performance of traditional melodies, and was not meant to be an outright ban.

===Dagestan===
Dagestan&#x27;s most famous composer may be Gotfrid Hasanov, who is said to be the first professional composer from Dagestan. He wrote the first Dagestani opera, &quot;Khochbar&quot;, in 1945 and recorded a great deal of folk music from all the peoples of Dagestan.

===Karelia===
Karelians are Finnish, and so much of their music is the same as Finnish music. The &quot;Kalevala&quot; is a very important part of traditional music; it is a recitation of Finnish legends, and is considered an integral part of the Finnish folk identity.

The Karelian Folk Music Ensemble is a prominent folk group.

===Ossetia===
Ossetians are people of the Caucasian Region, and thus Ossetian music and dance have similar themes to the music of Chechnya and the music of Dagestan.

===Russia===


Archeology and direct evidence show a variety of musical instruments in ancient Russia. Authentic folk instruments include the Livenka (accordion) and woodwinds like zhaleika, svirel and kugikli, as well as numerous percussion instruments: buben, bubenci, kokshnik, , lozhki, rubel, treschyotka, vertushka and zvonchalka.

Chastushkas are a kind of Russian folk song with a long history. They are typically humorous or satiric.

During the 19th century, Count Uvarov led a campaign of national revival which initiated the first professional orchestra with traditional instruments, beginning with Vasily Andreyev, who used the balalaika in an orchestra late in the century. Just after the dawn of the 20th century, Mitrofan Pyatnitsky founded the Pyatnitsky Choir, which used rural peasant singers and traditional sounds.

===Sakha===
Shamanism remains an important cultural practice of the ethnic groups of Siberia and Sakhalin, where several dozen groups live. The Yakuts are the largest, and are known for their olonkho songs and the khomus, a jaw harp.

===Tatarstan===
Tatar folk music has rhythmic peculiarities and pentatonic intonation in common with nations of the Volga area, who are ethnically Finno-Ugric and Turkic. Singing girls, renowned for their subtlety and grace, are a prominent component of Tatar folk music. Instruments include the kubyz (violin), quray (flute) and talianka (accordion).

===Tuva===
Tuvan throat singing, or xoomii, is famous worldwide, primarily for its novelty. The style is highly unusual and foreign to most listeners, who typically find it inaccessible and amelodic. In throat singing, the natural harmonic resonances of the lips and mouth are tuned to select certain overtones. The style was first recorded by Ted Levin, who helped catalogue a number of different styles. These include borbannadir (which is compared to the sound of a flowing river), sygyt (similar to whistling), xoomii, chylandyk (likened to chirping crickets) and ezengileer (like a horse&#x27;s trotting). Of particular international fame are the group Huun-Huur-Tu and master throat singer Kongar-ool Ondar.

===Ukrainian music in Russia===
Although Ukraine is an independent country since 1991, Ukrainians constitute the second-largest ethnic minority in Russia. The bandura is the most important and distinctive instrument of the Ukrainian folk tradition, and was used by court musicians in the various Tsarist courts. The kobzars, a kind of wandering performers who composed dumy, or folk epics.

===Hardbass in Russia===
Hardbass or hard bass (Russian: хардбасс, tr. hardbass, IPA: [xɐrdˈbas]) is a subgenre of electronic music which originated from Russia during the late 1990s, drawing inspiration from UK hard house, bouncy techno and hardstyle. Hardbass is characterized by its fast tempo (usually 150–175 BPM), donks, distinctive basslines (commonly known as &quot;hard bounce&quot;), distorted sounds, heavy kicks and occasional rapping. Hardbass has become a central stereotype of the gopnik subculture. In several European countries, so-called &quot;hardbass scenes&quot; have sprung up,[1] which are events related to the genre that involve multiple people dancing in public while masked, sometimes with moshing involved.

From 2015 onward, hardbass has also appeared as an Internet meme, depicting Slavic and Russian subcultures with the premiere of the video &quot;Cheeki Breeki Hardbass Anthem&quot;, based on the S.T.A.L.K.E.R. series of games from GSC game world.[2]

<text>The Royal Navy is the principal naval warfare service branch of the British Armed Forces. Its assets include both commissioned warships and non-commissioned vessels. As of December 2024, there are 62 commissioned and active ships in the Royal Navy.

Of the commissioned vessels, sixteen are major surface combatants (two aircraft carriers, six guided missile destroyers and eight frigates) and nine are nuclear-powered submarines (four ballistic missile submarines and five fleet submarines). In addition the Navy possesses seven mine countermeasures vessels, twenty-six patrol vessels, two survey vessels, one icebreaker and one historic warship, . The total displacement of the Royal Navy&#x27;s commissioned and active ships is approximately 393,000 tonnes.

The Royal Navy also includes a number of smaller non-commissioned assets. The naval training vessels and &quot;Hindostan&quot; can be found based at the Royal Navy stone frigates and the Britannia Royal Naval College, respectively. Non-commissioned &quot;Sea&quot;-class workboats, procured under Project &quot;Vahana&quot;, are operated by the Royal Navy in various support, survey and training roles, replacing previous P1000 Class Picket Boat vessels. This class of vessel also incorporates an autonomous minehunting variant (known as the &quot;Arcims&quot;-class), while another autonomous vessel, &quot;Madfox&quot;, is employed in varied roles including as a testbed for autonomous combat operations. &quot;Madfox&quot; and other experimental vessels, including XV &quot;Patrick Blackett&quot; and &quot;APAC-24&quot; (a crewless Pacific 24 rigid-hulled inflatable boat), are operated by &quot;NavyX&quot;, a unit of the Royal Navy dedicated to developing, testing and accelerating the use of new high technologies. RNMB [Royal Navy Motor Boat] &quot;Apollo&quot; is another mine countermeasures boat.

Besides the Royal Navy, the Royal Fleet Auxiliary (RFA) and the Royal Marines operate their own flotillas of vessels which complement the assets of the Royal Navy. These vessels are not included in this list or the above figures. Nevertheless, combined, the Royal Navy and RFA have 73 vessels with a total displacement of about 671,000 tonnes, with the principal landing craft of the Royal Marines having an additional combined displacement of about 2,200 tonnes.

As a supporting contingent of His Majesty&#x27;s Naval Service, the civilian Marine Services operate nearly 100 auxiliary ships (including coastal logistics, tugs and research vessels) in support of Royal Navy and Royal Fleet Auxiliary operations.

In the United Kingdom, the Royal Navy operates three main bases where commissioned ships are based: HMNB Portsmouth, HMNB Devonport and HMNB Clyde. A number of commissioned vessels, belonging to the University Royal Naval Units (URNU), are stationed at various other locations around the United Kingdom.

The Royal Navy&#x27;s principal overseas base is in Bahrain. A general-purpose frigate and vessels belonging to the navy&#x27;s 9th Mine Counter-Measures Squadron are forward-deployed there. Two fast patrol boats, together with a forward-deployed River-class offshore patrol vessel, normally form part of the Gibraltar Squadron and are permanently based there. Four other River-class vessels are also forward-deployed: one in the Falkland Islands, one in the Caribbean and two in the Indo-Pacific region. Additionally, the United Kingdom maintains a Joint Logistics Support Base in Duqm, Oman.

All ships and submarines currently in commission with the Royal Navy were built in the United Kingdom, with the exceptions of icebreaker which was built in Norway and survey vessel which was substantially built in Ireland. All commissioned vessels of the Royal Navy bear the ship prefix &quot;HMS&quot;, for His Majesty&#x27;s Ship or His Majesty&#x27;s Submarine.

<doc id="247778" wikidata="Q6957992" url="?curid=247778" title="List of ship names of the Royal Navy">
<text>This is an alphabetical list of the of all ships that have been in service with the Royal Navy, or with predecessor fleets formally in the service of the Kingdom of England or the Commonwealth of England. The list also includes fictional vessels which have prominently featured in literature about the Royal Navy. Names are traditionally re-used over the years, and have been carried by more than one ship.

Altogether over 13,000 ships have been in service with the Royal Navy.

Unlike many other naval services, the Royal Navy designates certain types of shore establishment (e.g. barracks, naval air stations and training establishments) as &quot;ships&quot; and names them accordingly. These establishments are often referred to in service slang as &quot;stone frigates&quot;.

===Fictional metal RN ships===
====Pre-World War II====

* The original 1920s edition of the H. P. Gibson naval board game &quot;Dover Patrol&quot; used a number of real RN ship names, but generally attached them to different ship classes. Thus the &quot;Flagships&quot; were H.M.S. and , and the &quot;Super Dreadnoughts&quot; were H.M.S. , , &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;India&quot;, but few of these resembled the actual ships with the same names in the drawings used on the playing pieces. The &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot; were given all new &#x27;County&#x27; names: H.M.S. &quot;Surrey&quot;, &quot;Middlesex&quot;, &quot;Lancashire&quot; and &quot;Yorkshire&quot;, and the &quot;Battle Cruisers&quot; had &#x27;Town&#x27; names: H.M.S. , , , , and . &quot;Light Cruisers&quot; had animal names: , , , , , , and ; &quot;Destroyers&quot; had &#x27;Bird&#x27; names: , , , , , &quot;Seagull&quot;, and ; and &quot;Auxiliary Cruisers&quot; were given insect names: , , &quot;Firefly&quot;, , , , &quot;Mosquito&quot; and . In the revised edition of the game published after World War II, the &quot;Flagships&quot; and &quot;Vice Flagships&quot; were unnamed, but all the other names shown above were retained, including the four wholly fictional county names given to the &quot;Battleships&quot; (reclassified from &quot;Dreadnoughts&quot;).

<doc id="247779" wikidata="Q181962" url="?curid=247779" title="Augusta, Georgia">
<text>Augusta is a city on the central eastern border of the U.S. state of Georgia. The city lies directly across the Savannah River from North Augusta, South Carolina at the head of its navigable portion. Augusta, the third most populous city in Georgia (following Atlanta and Columbus), is situated in the Fall Line region of the state.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Augusta had a 2020 population of 202,081, not counting the independent cities of Blythe and Hephzibah located within the boundaries of Augusta-Richmond County. It is the 116th most populous city in the United States and the 92nd-largest metropolitan area. The process of consolidation between the city of Augusta and Richmond County began with a 1995 referendum in the two jurisdictions. The merger was completed on July 1, 1996, but it excluded the municipalities of Blythe and Hephzibah. Augusta is the principal city of the Augusta metropolitan area. In 2020 the metro area had a population of 611,000, making it the second-largest in the state (after Atlanta) and the ninth most populous urban center in the Deep South.

Augusta was established in 1736 and is named in honor of Princess Augusta of Saxe-Gotha (1719–1772), the bride of Frederick, Prince of Wales and the mother of the British monarch George III. During the American Civil War, Augusta housed the principal Confederate Powderworks. Augusta&#x27;s warm climate made it a major resort town of the Eastern United States in the early and mid-20th century. Internationally, Augusta is best known for hosting the Masters golf tournament each spring. The Masters brings over 200,000 visitors from around the world to the Augusta National Golf Club. Membership at Augusta National is widely considered to be the most prestigious in the sport of golf around the world.

Augusta lies approximately two hours away from downtown Atlanta by car via I-20. The city is home to Fort Eisenhower, a major U.S. Army base formerly known as Fort Gordon. In 2016, it was announced that the new National Cyber Security Headquarters would be based in Augusta.

==History==
=== Establishment ===
The area along the river was long inhabited by varying cultures of indigenous peoples, who relied on the river for fish, water and transportation. The site of Augusta was used by Native Americans as a place to cross the Savannah River, because of its location on the fall line.

In 1735, two years after James Oglethorpe founded Savannah, he sent a detachment of troops to explore the upper Savannah River. He gave them an order to build a fort at the head of the navigable part of the river. The expedition was led by Noble Jones, who the following year created a settlement as a first line of defense for coastal areas against potential Spanish or French invasion from the interior. Oglethorpe named the town in honor of Princess Augusta, the mother of King George III and the wife of Frederick, Prince of Wales.

Oglethorpe visited Augusta in September 1739 on his return to Savannah from a perilous visit to Coweta Town, near present-day Phenix City, Alabama. There, he had met with a convention of 7,000 Native American warriors and concluded a peace treaty with them in their territories in northern and western Georgia. During the American Revolutionary War, the Siege of Augusta resulted in the retaking the city from the British by the Americans. Augusta was the second state capital of Georgia from 1785 until 1795 (alternating for a period with Savannah, the first).

=== Development ===
Augusta developed rapidly as a market town as the Black Belt in the Piedmont was developed for cotton cultivation. Invention of the cotton gin made processing of short-staple cotton profitable, and this type of cotton was well-suited to the upland areas. Cotton plantations were worked by slave labor, with hundreds of thousands of slaves shipped from the Upper South to the Deep South in the domestic slave trade. Many of the slaves were brought from the Lowcountry, where their Gullah culture had developed on the large Sea Island cotton and rice plantations.

During the American Civil War, Augusta was home to many war industries including powder-works facilities. After the war, Augusta had a booming textile industry leading to the construction of many mills along the Augusta Canal to include Enterprise Mill, Sibley Mill, and King Mill.

The city experienced the Augusta Fire of 1916, which damaged 25 blocks of the town and many buildings of historical significance.

As a major city in the area, Augusta was a center of activities during Reconstruction and after. In the mid-20th century, it was a site of civil rights demonstrations. In 1970, Charles Oatman, a mentally disabled teenager, was killed by his cellmates in an Augusta jail. A protest against his death broke out in a riot involving 500 people, after six black men were killed by police, each found to have been shot in the back. The noted singer and entertainer James Brown was called in to help quell lingering tensions, which he succeeded in doing.

=== Hyde Park contamination ===

In 1993, an area known as Hyde Park in Augusta, Georgia, was investigated by the EPA for contamination. The investigation totaled $1.2 million. Air, groundwater, and soil were all believed to be contaminated, and people living in the area were hoping for government assistance to move away from Hyde Park. Two of five neighborhoods in Hyde Park appeared to have arsenic, chromium, and dioxin, while all five were found to have PCBs and lead. However, residents were told it was not a risk to their health unless they somehow ingested it on a regular basis. At the time the article was written, the citizens still questioned why the EPA and ATSDR (Agency for Toxic Disease Registry) did not consider these chemicals as a threat to them. Hyde Park also has higher rates of certain illnesses (such as cancer, infections, rashes) than the average in America, and the citizens question why that is not considered.

==Geography==
Augusta is located along the Georgia/South Carolina border, about east of Atlanta and west of Columbia. The city is located at (33.4700, −81.9750).

According to the United States Census Bureau, the Augusta–Richmond County balance has a total area of , of which is land and (1.42%) is water.

Augusta is located about halfway up the Savannah River on the fall line, which creates a number of small falls on the river. The city marks the end of a navigable waterway for the river and the entry to the Georgia Piedmont area.

The Clarks Hill Dam is built on the fall line near Augusta, forming Clarks Hill Lake. Farther downstream, near the border of Columbia County, is the Stevens Creek Dam, which generates hydroelectric power. Even farther downstream is the Augusta Diversion Dam, which marks the beginning of the Augusta Canal and channels Savannah River waters into the canal.

===Climate===
As with the rest of the state, Augusta has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), with short, mild winters, very hot, humid summers, and a wide diurnal temperature variation throughout much of the year, despite its low elevation and humidity. The monthly daily average temperature ranges from in January to in July; there are 53 nights with the low reaching the freezing mark, 82 days reaching or exceeding , and 5.5 days reaching annually. Extreme temperatures range from on January 21, 1985 up to on August 10, 2007, and August 21, 1983. Snowfall is not nearly as common as in Atlanta, due largely to Augusta&#x27;s elevation, with downtown Augusta being about lower than downtown Atlanta. The heaviest recorded snowfall was in February 1973 with Freezing rain is also a threat in wintertime.

===Historic districts===
There are 10 historic districts throughout the city of Augusta. The most prominent, Augusta Downtown Historic District, encompasses most of downtown Augusta and its pre-Civil War area. The Augusta Downtown Historic District was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 2004.

==Demographics==


At the 2020 United States census, there were 202,081 people, 66,838 households, and 41,517 families residing in the city. During the 2010 U.S. census, the city&#x27;s population was 195,844, up from 195,182 at the 2000 United States census.

In 2000, the city&#x27;s racial and ethnic composition was 43.72% non-Hispanic white, 49.96% African American, 0.25% Native American, 1.50% Asian, 0.11% Pacific Islander, 0.18% some other race, 1.48% multiracial, and 2.79% Hispanic or Latino of any race. By the 2020 census, its racial and ethnic makeup was 35.52% non-Hispanic white, 55.19% African American, 0.24% Asian, 1.93% Asian, 0.19% Pacific Islander, 0.44% some other race, 3.91% multiracial, and 5.58% Hispanic or Latino of any race. This reflected nationwide trends of greater diversification since the beginning of the 21st century.

==Law and government==

In 1995, citizens of Augusta and unincorporated parts of Richmond County voted to consolidate their city and county governments. Citizens of Hephzibah and Blythe, also located in Richmond County, voted against joining in the merger, which took effect January 1, 1996. The unified government consists of a mayor and ten commissioners. Eight commissioners represent single-member districts, while two are elected at-large, each to represent a super district that encompasses half of Augusta-Richmond&#x27;s population. Law enforcement in Augusta is handled by the Richmond County Sheriff&#x27;s Office which patrols the main city of Augusta and the unincorporated areas of Hephzibah and Blythe although both of these towns have their own police departments. Prior to consolidation, Augusta had a city police department and the Richmond County sheriff patrolled the unincorporated areas of the county. The consolidation charter deems the sheriff as the chief law enforcement officer of Richmond County. Augusta is one of the few consolidated city-counties in the state that retain the sheriff in a law enforcement capacity.

Despite layoffs from several companies during the U.S. economic recession and a relatively high state unemployment rate, the Augusta community has experienced a decrease in bankruptcy filings and saw a slight decrease in the unemployment rate from late 2009 to March 2011. However, these unemployment numbers were misleading as spring brought lower unemployment rates due to the Masters Golf Tournament. While unemployment fell to a two-year low of 8.3% in April 2011, unemployment rates have since risen to 9.9% as of July 2011.

The city has two airports: Augusta Regional Airport and Daniel Field. Augusta Regional Airport is served by two passenger airlines, including Delta Connection, which offers service to Atlanta, and American Eagle, which offers service to Charlotte, Dallas-Ft. Worth, and Washington D.C.

===Rail===
Until the 1960s, the city&#x27;s Augusta Union Station was a passenger rail hub, with trains arriving from the Atlantic Coast Line (as spur sections from Florence, South Carolina, from trains such as the &quot;Champion,&quot; &quot;Everglades&quot; and &quot;Palmetto&quot;), Georgia Railroad and Southern Railway (for example, the &quot;Aiken-Augusta Special&quot; from New York City). The last Seaboard Coast Line (the successor to the Atlantic Coast Line) train was a Florence-Augusta section of the &quot;Champion;&quot; this section ended in 1970. The last train to the city was the unnamed daily in-state Georgia Railroad train between Atlanta and Augusta. This latter train, unofficially called the &quot;Georgia Cannonball&quot;, ran as a mixed train, until May 6, 1983. Most trains went to the Union Station at Barrett Square. The Southern Railway trains went to the Southern Railway depot at Fifth and Reynolds Street. Today, freight service is handled by Norfolk Southern Railway&#x27;s Georgia Division and Piedmont Division through their Augusta Yard and Nixon Yard located near the city. Norfolk Southern Trains such as the NS 191 and 192 pass through Augusta&#x27;s downtown as they &quot;street run&quot; at down 6th street. They also cross the old Trestle over the Savannah River entering and leaving South Carolina. CSX Transportation Atlanta Division and Florence Division Trains also serve the Augusta, Georgia, area from the CSX Augusta Yard near Gordon Highway southwest of the city.

<text>William Catesby (1450 – 25 August 1485) was one of Richard III of England&#x27;s principal councillors. He also served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Speaker of the House of Commons during Richard&#x27;s reign. The Catesbys’ medieval wealth derived from livestock and the zenith of their political achievement came during his career.

The son of Sir William Catesby of Ashby St Ledgers, Northamptonshire (died 1478) and Philippa, daughter and heiress of Sir William Bishopston, he was trained for the law in the Inner Temple. As an aspiring lawyer Catesby initially progressed in the service of William, 1st Lord Hastings. He married Margaret, daughter of William La Zouche, 6th Baron Zouche of Harringworth; the couple had three sons. Upon the death of his father he inherited many estates in the English Midlands and was land-agent for many others. He was a member of the Council that ruled during the reign of Edward V. After Richard was enthroned, Catesby was one of King Richard&#x27;s closest advisors. He served as Chancellor of the Exchequer, and as Speaker of the English House of Commons during the Parliament of 1484, in which he sat as knight of the shire for Northamptonshire. He also received a substantial grant of land from the king, enough to make him richer than most knights.

In July 1484, William Collingbourne, a Tudor agent, tacked up a lampooning poem to St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral, which mentions Catesby among the three aides to King Richard, whose emblem was a white boar:
(The dog here refers to Lovell&#x27;s heraldic symbol, a wolf.) The poem was interpolated into Laurence Olivier&#x27;s film &quot;Richard III&quot;, a screen adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s play. Collingbourne was hanged, drawn and quartered for this and other alleged treasonable activities.

William Catesby was one of the two councillors (the other being Richard Ratcliffe) who are reputed to have told the king that marrying Elizabeth of York would cause rebellions in the north. He fought alongside Richard at the Battle of Bosworth Field and was captured. Alone of those of importance, he was executed three days later at Leicester. The suggestion that he might have made a deal with the Stanleys before the battle comes from his will when he asked them &quot;to pray for my soul as ye have not for my body, as I trusted in you.&quot;

After his death, his estates were largely confiscated by Henry VII. Catesby was succeeded by his eldest son, George, to whom the family seat of Ashby St Legers was later restored. Robert Catesby, leader of the Gunpowder Plot, was a descendant.

<text>The music of [[Slovakia]] has been influenced both by the country&#x27;s native Slovak peoples and the music of neighbouring regions. Whilst there are traces of pre-historic musical instruments, the country has a rich heritage of folk music and mediaeval liturgical music, and from the 18th century onwards, in particular, musical life was influenced by that of Austria-Hungary. In the 19th century, composers such as Ján Levoslav Bella began to write romantic music with a Slovak character. In the twentieth century, there were a number of composers who identified with Slovak culture. After the fall of communism in 1989–90 the country also began to develop its own popular music scene in Western style.

==History of music in Slovakia==
The term &quot;Slovak music&quot; is slightly confusing; many peoples lived over the ages in the territory now represented by the state of Slovakia, and the history of the region&#x27;s music is therefore not merely the history of the music of the Slovaks
===Earliest times===
Bone pipes dating from the Early Bronze Age (about 3000 BC) have been found in the Nitra region, testifying to the early role of music in the Celtic &#x27;Nitra Culture&#x27;. Such instruments were produced continuously, albeit with more sophistication, up to the mediaeval period. Other early instruments found include drums dating back to the Palaeolithic period, iron and bronze bells from the 3rd or 4th century AD. Other folk instruments of the region whose early development must remain largely conjectural include the fujara and the Slovak versions of bagpipes and the jaw harp. They certainly existed in the 15th century.

===The medieval period===
From the medieval period onwards writers identify a number of principal streams of music in Slovakia. The principal classifications include church music, folk music, and instrumental music heard in towns and courts. Each of these has of course numerous subsidiary classifications.

Some of the oldest recorded forms of music in Slovakia are liturgical song (in Old Slavonic) from the time of Great Moravian empire (9th century), from which developed much of the sacred music of later centuries. Latin plainsong was also widespread in the region at this early period, especially after the incorporation of Slovakia into the Kingdom of Hungary in 1218. Early codices include the &#x27;Nitra Gospels&#x27; of c. 1100, and the &#x27;Pray codex&#x27; (c. 1195). From the 15th to the 17th centuries, polyphony was practised and developed at many urban centres, including Bratislava, Bardejov, Levoča and Kežmarok.

In 1526 when Slovakia became part of the empire of the Habsburgs, Bratislava became a coronation city, and this was to greatly influence the development of formal music in the country&#x27;s towns. In the countryside, folk music developed in a more insular manner in the country&#x27;s various regions.

===Seventeenth and eighteenth centuries===
As elsewhere in Europe, the Church and the aristocracy became the main patrons of formal music during this period. Church composers were active throughout the country; e.g., in the polyphonic tradition, Andreas Neoman who worked at Bardejov and elsewhere in the early 17th century, Ján Šimbracký (d. 1657), organist at the Protestant church in Spišské Podhradie, and Samuel Marckfelner (1621–1674), organist at Levoča. In the larger towns, especially in Bratislava, the influence of the Italian concertante style was felt, composers in this vein including Samuel Capricornus (1628–1665) (who eventually became kapellmeister for a prince of Stuttgart), his successor at the Protestant church in Breatislava, Johann Sigismund Kusser (1626–1696).

By the eighteenth century, Catholic musicians began to take the musical lead over their Protestant colleagues. A highly rated composer was František Xaver Budinský (1676–1727), who appears to have been a Jesuit lay brother and worked in Trnava, Prešov, Košice, Trenčín, and elsewhere in Slovakia. His compositions include three symphonies, the earliest known to have been written in Slovakia.

===Nineteenth century===
In the first half of the 19th century, a national musical tradition began to develop around Slovakia’s impressive folk heritage. Modern Slovak music drew from both classical and folk styles. A key figure who began this fusion is Ján Levoslav Bella, born in Liptovský Mikuláš (1843–1936), a contemporary of Antonín Dvořák and Leoš Janáček. Slovak modes and melodies can be heard clearly in his third string quartet, as well as in many of his other works. He also wrote the first opera to be performed in Slovak, &quot;Kováč Wieland&quot; (&quot;Wieland the Smith&quot;), written in German in 1880-1890, but premiered in Slovak in Bratislava in 1926.

===Modern times===
Well-known works from the 20th century include the compositions of Eugen Suchoň, Alexander Moyzes, Alexander Albrecht and the operas of Ján Cikker.
The internationally most acknowledged composers of the 21st century are Vladimír Godár, Peter Breiner, Peter Machajdík and Iris Szeghy. Operatic soprano Lucia Popp was born in Záhorská Ves.

==Musical ensembles and festivals==
Amongst the most significant contemporary orchestral ensembles are the Slovak Philharmonic Orchestra of Bratislava, the State Philharmonic Orchestra of Kosice, the Slovak Radio Symphony Orchestra, the Slovak Chamber Orchestra (known as the &quot;Warchalovci&quot; after their founder Bohdan Warchal), and the chamber orchestra Capella Istropolitana. There are opera companies in Bratislava, Košice and Banská Bystrica. Music festivals include the annual &quot;Bratislava Music Festival&quot; (Bratislavské hudobné slávnosti), &quot;Indian Summer in Levoča&quot; (Levočské babie leto), &quot;Festival of Piešťany&quot; (Piešťanský festival), one of longest established festivals, dating from 1955, the Konvergencie Chamber Music Festival founded in 1999 by cellist, Jozef Lupták, Music at Fulla (Hudba u Fullu) in Ružomberok founded 2009 by composer Peter Machajdik, and many others.

<doc id="247785" wikidata="Q3525529" url="?curid=247785" title="Thomas Rotherham">
<text>Thomas Rotherham (24 August 1423 – 29 May 1500), also known as Thomas (Scot) de Rotherham, was an English cleric and . He served as bishop of several dioceses, most notably as Archbishop of York and, on two occasions as Lord Chancellor. He is considered a venerable figure in Rotherham, South Yorkshire, his town of birth.

==Life==
===Background===
Thomas Rotherham was born on 24 August 1423 in Rotherham, Yorkshire. He is said to have been the eldest son of Sir Thomas Rotherham of Rotherham by his wife, Dame Alice. From the sixteenth century onwards he was also known by the alternate surname &#x27;Scot&#x27;, although that surname was not used by Rotherham himself or by his contemporaries. In his will, however, Rotherham does refer to his kinsman John Scott of Ecclesfield, Yorkshire, and it has been speculated that he was the son of Sir John Scott of Scot&#x27;s Hall in Smeeth, Kent and Agnes Beaufitz. However this claim is said to have been disproved.

===Education===
He was first educated as a young boy by a teacher of grammar, who came, according to Thomas, &quot;I know not by what fate save it was the Grace of God&quot;. Afterwards he was sent to the newly founded Eton College to prepare for university entrance.

===Appointments to office===
Rotherham was educated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, graduating as a Bachelor of Divinity and becoming a Fellow of his college, and lectured on Grammar, Theology, and Philosophy. After his ordination as a priest, he became a prebendary of Lincoln in 1462 and then of Salisbury in 1465. He moved on to powerful positions in the Church, being appointed as Bishop of Rochester in 1468, Bishop of Lincoln in 1472, and then Archbishop of York in 1480, a position he held until 1500.

In 1467, King Edward IV appointed Rotherham as Keeper of the Privy Seal. He was sent as ambassador to France in 1468 and as joint ambassador to Burgundy in 1471, and in 1475 was entrusted with the office of Lord Chancellor. Between 1477 and his death, Rotherham was the owner of Barnes Hall in South Yorkshire.

===Involvement in intrigue===
When Edward IV died in April 1483, Rotherham was one of the celebrants of the funeral mass on 20 April 1483. Immediately after Edward&#x27;s death, Rotherham sided with dowager queen Elizabeth Woodville in her attempt to deprive Richard, Duke of Gloucester of his role as Lord Protector of the new King, her son Edward V. When Elizabeth sought sanctuary after Richard had taken charge of the king, Rotherham released the Great Seal to her. Though he later recovered it and handed it over to Thomas Bourchier, Archbishop of Canterbury, his mishandling of the seal – indicative of questionable loyalty, led to his dismissal as Lord Chancellor. On 13 May he was replaced by John Russell, who earlier had also been his successor as Bishop of Lincoln.

On 13 June 1483, Rotherham was charged with being involved in a conspiracy between Lord Hastings and the Woodvilles against Richard and imprisoned in the Tower of London. He was released in the middle of July.

===Retirement===
Once again appointed Lord Chancellor in 1485, he was shortly afterwards dismissed by Henry VII. After this he retired from most public work.

==Death and memorial==
Rotherham died of the plague in Cawood near York on 29 May 1500. His remains were transferred to a magnificent marble tomb in York Minster in 1506.

==Endowments==

Rotherham built part of Lincoln College, Oxford, and increased its endowment; at Cambridge, where he was four times Chancellor and Master of Pembroke Hall, he helped to build the University Library.

In 1480 Rotherham endowed a Chapel of Jesus within Rotherham parish church, providing a priest to sing masses for the souls of his ancestors. He founded the College of Jesus in Rotherham as a memorial to his first teacher. The foundations of the red brick College were laid at his birthplace in Brookgate in March 1482 and a licence was granted on 22 January 1483 &quot;for the honour and glory of the name of Jesus Christ to found a perpetual College&quot;.

The statutes of the college were dated 1 February 1483. The College of Jesus was to consist of a Provost and three Fellows, all to be in Holy Orders, who must attend church on Sundays and Holy Days. The Fellows were to teach grammar and train the six choristers of Jesus in song and music. They were also to teach promising boys who did not aspire to the priesthood reading, writing, and reckoning, free of charge. If the boys continued to show merit, they should be taught the rudiments of grammar and music. The college was dissolved around 1550 by Edward VI of England and all its possessions seized by the crown. Very little now remains of the original building, although the street is still known as College Street.

The teaching of grammar to boys continued at Rotherham after the 1550s. The Rotherham Grammar School looked upon Thomas Rotherham as its founder, took 1483 to be its year of origin, and adopted as its badge the armorial bearings of Thomas Rotherham. The school took its last intake of boys in September 1965 and was progressively phased-out over the following several years.

Rotherham is still remembered in the name of Thomas Rotherham College, which is the post-1967 descendant of the Rotherham Grammar School for Boys.

<doc id="247789" wikidata="Q6942356" url="?curid=247789" title="Music of the Central African Republic">
<text>Music of the [[Central African Republic]] includes many different forms. Western rock and pop music, as well as Afrobeat, soukous and other genres have become popular nationwide. The sanza is a popular instrument.

The Pygmies have a complex folk music tradition. Polyphony and counterpoint are common components, as is a varied rhythmic structure. The trumpet-based music of the Bandas has also gained some popularity outside the area due to its jazzy structure. The Ngbaka use an unusual instrument called a mbela, which is made with an arched branch and a string strung between the two ends and held in front of the musician&#x27;s mouth. When the string is struck, the mouth is used to amplify and modulate the tone. Instruments similar to the mbela are sometimes considered the oldest ancestors of all string instruments .

The national anthem of the Central African Republic is &quot;La Renaissance&quot;. This song, which has been the anthem since 1960, was written by Barthélémy Boganda (words), the first President of the Central African Republic, and Herbert Pepper, who also composed the melody for the Senegalese national anthem .

==Popular music==

Popular music in the Central African Republic generally comes from the music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo or elsewhere in Africa; however, Latin, European and American pop are also common, as is jazz and rock and roll. African folktales are very popular as well, like the Panda.

==Folk music==

===Banda music===
The Banda people have produced some modern popular music, using a trumpet-based kind of jazzy music which UNESCO has called one of the &quot;great musicological discoveries of our century&quot; . Banda folk music includes &quot;ongo&quot;, a kind of trumpet made from wood or antelope horn. &quot;Ongos&quot; are used in ceremonies and rituals, including adolescent initiation rites, in polyphonic ensembles of eighteen trumpets.

===Pygmy music===
Formally Pygmy music consists of at most only four parts, and can be described as an, &quot;ostinato with variations,&quot; or similar to a passacaglia, in that it is cyclical. In fact it is based on repetition of periods of equal length, which each singer divides using different rhythmic figures specific to different repertoires and songs. This interesting case of ethnomusicology and ethnomathematics creates a detailed surface and endless variations of not only the same period repeated, but the same piece of music. As in some Balinese gamelan these patterns are based on a super-pattern which is never heard. The Pygmies themselves do not learn or think of their music in this theoretical framework, but learn the music growing up.

Pygmy styles include liquindi, or water drumming, and instruments like the bow harp (&quot;ieta&quot;), ngombi (harp zither) and limbindi (a string bow) (Abram).

<text>The Abyssocottinae are a subfamily of ray-finned fishes in the family Cottidae, the sculpins. They are known commonly as the deep-water sculpins. The entire subfamily is endemic to Lake Baikal in Siberia.

Sculpins of this subfamily mostly live in deep water, below . There are 24 known species in seven genera. These include, for instance, &quot;Abyssocottus korotneffi&quot; and &quot;Cottinella boulengeri&quot; which are among the deepest-living freshwater fish. Baikal is the deepest lake on Earth () and sculpins occupy even its greatest depths.

==Evolution and systematics==
Molecular studies based on mitochondrial DNA suggest that the Abyssocottinae along with other Lake Baikal cottoid fishes, now attributed to the likewise endemic Cottocomephorinae (Baikal sculpins) and Comephorinae (Baikal oilfish), together make a monophyletic group that has originated and diversified within the lake relative recently, since the Pliocene. The ancestors of this species flock comprising more than 30 species belonged to the widespread freshwater sculpin genus &quot;Cottus&quot; (in Cottidae). The Abyssocottidae itself appears as a natural group within this radiation, except that also the genus &quot;Batrachocottus&quot; should be included.

==Genera==
The following genera have been included in the subfamily:

<text>Semionotiformes is an order of ray-finned fish known from the Middle Triassic (Anisian) to the Late Cretaceous (Maastrichtian). Their closest living relatives are gars (Lepisosteidae), with both groups belonging to the clade Ginglymodi within the Holostei. The group includes both freshwater (Semionotidae) and marine (Callipurbeckiidae, Macrosemiidae) adapted forms. Many members of the family Macrosemiidae (which are usually included in Semionotiformes but sometimes placed in their order), had elongated dorsal fins, often associated with an adjacent area of skin which was free of scales. These fins were likely undulated for use in precision swimming. The body morphology of macrosemiids suggests that they were slow swimmers who were capable of maneuvering around complex topography, such as reef environments.

<doc id="247805" wikidata="Q18185" url="?curid=247805" title="Grading in education">
<text>Grading in education is the application of standardized measurements to evaluate different levels of student achievement in a course. Grades can be expressed as letters (usually A to F), as a range (for example, 1 to 6), percentages, or as numbers out of a possible total (often out of 100). The exact system that is used varies worldwide. 

== Significance ==
In some countries, grades are averaged to create a grade point average (GPA). GPA is calculated by using the number of grade points a student earns in a given period of time. A GPA is often calculated for high school, undergraduate, and graduate students. A cumulative grade point average (CGPA) is the average of all the GPAs a student has achieved during their time at the institution. Students are sometimes required to maintain a certain GPA in order to be admitted to a certain academic program or to remain in that program. Grades are also used in decisions to provide a student with financial aid or a scholarship.

Grades are seen as an indicator for academic success and ability, and GPA is thought to indicate future job effectiveness and success. In addition, research has shown a correlation between GPA and future Job satisfaction. Studies have also shown that a higher GPA leads to a higher income.

==History==
Students were given assessments as far back as 500 B.C. but no methods existed to formally measure student performance or track mastery of the subject. In the mid 1600’s Harvard University started to require exit exams to evaluate students, but they were not scored with letter grades.

The first record of a grading scale for students was at Yale University. Yale University historian George Wilson Pierson writes: &quot;According to tradition the first grades issued at Yale (and possibly the first in the country) were given out in the year 1785, when President Ezra Stiles, after examining 58 Seniors, recorded in his diary that there were &#x27;Twenty &quot;Optimi&quot;, sixteen second &quot;Optimi&quot;, twelve &quot;Inferiores&quot; (&quot;Boni&quot;), ten &quot;Pejores&quot;.&#x27;&quot; By 1837, Yale had converted these adjectives into numbers on a 4-point scale, and some historians say this is the origin of the standard modern American GPA scale.

Bob Marlin argues that the concept of grading students&#x27; work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named William Farish and first implemented by the University of Cambridge in 1792. That assertion has been questioned by Christopher Stray, who finds the evidence for Farish as the inventor of the numerical mark to be unpersuasive. Stray&#x27;s article also explains the complex relationship between the mode of examination (oral or written) and the varying philosophies of education these modes imply to both the teacher and the student. 

The A-D/F system was first adopted by Mount Holyoke College in 1897. However, this system did not become widespread until the 1940s, and was still only used by 67% of primary and secondary schools in the United States in 1971.

== Criticism ==
It has been criticized that grades are only short-term snapshots of how much a student has learned in a given period of time, which only partially reflect the actual performance and does not take sufficient account of the individual development of students. Likewise, poor grades over a longer period of time would give students the impression that they would learn very little or nothing, which jeopardizes the innate intrinsic motivation of every child to learn. Children who have already lost their desire to learn and only study for their grades have no reason to continue learning after they have achieved the best possible grade. In addition, poor grades represent destructive feedback for students, since they do not provide any constructive assistance, but only absolute key figures. It is also criticized that the way of thinking, which can often be traced back to the grading system, that bad grades lead to poor future prospects, leads to perplexity, pressure, stress and depression among parents and children.

It is criticized that students often do not learn for their future life or out of interest in the material, but only for the grades and the associated status, which promotes bulimic learning.

German philosopher and publicist Richard David Precht criticizes the system of school grades in his book &quot;Anna, die Schule und der liebe Gott: Der Verrat des Bildungssystems an unseren Kindern&quot;. He believes that numbers from 1 to 6 (the school grading system used in Germany) do not do justice to the personalities of the children. In his opinion, grades are neither meaningful nor differentiated and therefore not helpful. For example, the questions whether a student has become more motivated, is more interested in a topic, has learned to deal better with failure and whether he has developed new ideas cannot be answered with grades. Instead, Precht suggests a differentiated written assessment of the students&#x27; learning and development path. In his opinion, the grading system comes from a psychologically and pedagogically uninformed era and does not belong in the 21st century.

German educational innovator Margret Rasfeld criticizes the system of grades as unhelpful and, in her opinion, the resulting competitive thinking in schools and says: &quot;School is there to organize success and not to document failure.&quot;

German neuroscientist Gerald Hüther criticizes grades for being responsible for ensuring that students cannot specialize in any topic that they are enthusiastic about and have a talent for, since otherwise their grades in other areas would deteriorate. He also believes that &quot;our society will not develop further...if we force all children to conform to the same evaluation standards&quot;.

Grading may also reflect the bias of the instructor thereby reinforcing systematic bias.

As educators have begun to recognize the potential drawbacks, alternative grading methods, including competency-based assessment, specifications grading, and &quot;ungrading&quot; have become more popular. 

==Grading systems by country==

Most nations have their own grading system, and different institutions in a single nation can vary in their grading systems as well. However, several international standards for grading have arisen recently, such as the European Baccalaureate.

<doc id="247817" wikidata="Q12002092" url="?curid=247817" title="Welfare spending">
<text>Welfare spending is a type of government support intended to ensure that members of a society can meet basic human needs such as food and shelter. Social security may either be synonymous with welfare, or refer specifically to social insurance programs which provide support only to those who have previously contributed (e.g. pensions), as opposed to &quot;social assistance&quot; programs which provide support on the basis of need alone (e.g. most disability benefits). The International Labour Organization defines social security as covering support for those in old age, support for the maintenance of children, medical treatment, parental and sick leave, unemployment and disability benefits, and support for sufferers of occupational injury.

More broadly, welfare may also encompass efforts to provide a basic level of well-being through subsidized &quot;social services&quot; such as healthcare, education, infrastructure, vocational training, and public housing. In a welfare state, the state assumes responsibility for the health, education, infrastructure and welfare of society, providing a range of social services such as those described.

Some historians view systems of codified almsgiving, like the &quot;zakat&quot; policy of the seventh century (634 CE) Rashidun caliph Umar, as early examples of universal government welfare. The first welfare state was Imperial Germany (1871–1918), where the Bismarck government introduced social security in 1889. In the early 20th century, the United Kingdom introduced social security around 1913, and adopted the welfare state with the National Insurance Act 1946, during the Attlee government (1944–1951). In the countries of western Europe, Australia, and New Zealand, social welfare is mainly provided by the government out of the national tax revenues, and to a lesser extent by non-government organizations (NGOs), and charities (social and religious). A right to social security and an adequate standard of living is asserted in Articles 22 and 25 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.

==History==


In the Roman Empire, the first emperor Augustus provided the &quot;Cura Annonae&quot; or grain dole for citizens who could not afford to buy food every month. Social welfare was enlarged by the Emperor Trajan. Trajan&#x27;s program brought acclaim from many, including Pliny the Younger. Other provisions for the poor were introduced during the history of Ancient Rome, such as the Alimenta.

The Song dynasty government (960 CE) supported multiple programs which could be classified as social welfare, including the state hospitals, low-interest loans for peasants, state orphanages, free pharmacies for the poor, filled state granaries, fire stations and libraries in the large cities, retirement homes, public clinics, and paupers&#x27; graveyards. According to economist Robert Henry Nelson, &quot;the medieval Roman Catholic Church operated a far-reaching and comprehensive welfare system for the poor...&quot;. Ancient Greek city-states provided free medical services for the poor and slaves. From the 14th century onward, the governments of the Italian city-states began to partner with the church to provide welfare and education to the lower classes. In the 18th Century, according to one study, the Qing Dynasty had &quot;the most elaborate relief system in world history, based on state and local granaries that were used in times of shortage to stabilize food prices and provide relief to the urban and rural poor.&quot; This system, however, was weakened after imperialism entered China following the 1840 Opium War and the Taiping Rebellion (1850–1860), which resulted in a crisis in the Qing Dynasty. Following the foundation of the Republic in 1912 and the following years of civil wars and warlordism, &quot;the state granary system became almost non-existent.&quot;

Throughout the history of the Byzantine Empire, various social welfare services and institutions were established. Provision was also made for the State to provide food and clothing for children that parents were unable to bring up due to indigence.

In later Protestant European nations such as the Dutch Republic, welfare was managed by local guilds until the abolition of the guild system in the early 19th century. In the free imperial cities of the Holy Roman Empire, the city governments in cities like Nuremberg could take control of the collection and distribution of public welfare. In 1520, Martin Luther called for (in an &quot;Appeal to the Christian Nobility of the German nation&quot;) the abolition of begging and provisions for those in need. In 1523, following a request by the citizens of Leisnig, in Saxony, Luther devised a plan for a &quot;Common Chest,&quot; under which &quot;There shall be ordered for God’s house and kept in place for all time, two casks or council chests in which bread, cheese, eggs, meat and other food and provisions shall be placed; and there shall also be a box or two wherein money may be put for the upkeep of the common chest.&quot;

Reflecting Luther&#x27;s views, in 1522 the Wittenberg Church order set up a &quot;common chest&quot; for welfare work which provided various means of support for the poor. In France in 1536, as noted by one study, &quot;Francis I ordered each parish to register its poor and provide for the impotent from contributed funds.&quot; Prior to this, systems of organized relief had been set up in Rouen, Lyons, and Paris. Also in regards to Europe, one historian has argued that &quot;The Dutch were also renowned for their support of the virtuous poor and the young in need.&quot;

Various forms of social welfare were also established in the Inca Empire, the Aztec Empire, the Ottoman Empire, and in precolonial Africa.

The seventh century caliph Umar implemented a form of &quot;zakat&quot;, one of the Five Pillars of Islam, as a codified universal social security tax. Traditionally estimated at 2.5% of an individual&#x27;s assets, government &quot;zakat&quot; funds were distributed to various groups of Muslims, including impoverished people and those in severe debt. The collection of &quot;zakat&quot; increased during the Umayyad and Abbasid caliphates, though the &quot;zakat&quot; system was frequently inefficient and corrupt; Islamic jurists often instructed Muslims to distribute money to the needy directly instead to maximize its impact.

Likewise, in Jewish tradition, charity (represented by tzedakah) is a matter of religious obligation rather than benevolence. Contemporary charity is regarded as a continuation of the Biblical Maaser Ani, or poor-tithe, as well as Biblical practices, such as permitting the poor to glean the corners of a field and harvest during the Shmita (Sabbatical year).

There is relatively little statistical data on transfer payments before the High Middle Ages. In the medieval period and until the Industrial Revolution, the function of welfare payments in Europe was achieved through private giving or charity, through numerous confraternities and activities of different religious orders. Early welfare programs in Europe included the English Poor Law of 1601, which gave parishes the responsibility for providing welfare payments to the poor. This system was substantially modified by the 19th-century Poor Law Amendment Act, which introduced the system of workhouses.

It was predominantly in the late 19th and early 20th centuries that an organized system of state welfare provision was introduced in many countries. Otto von Bismarck, Chancellor of Germany, introduced one of the first welfare systems for the working classes. In Great Britain the Liberal government of Henry Campbell-Bannerman and David Lloyd George introduced the National Insurance system in 1911, a system later expanded by Clement Attlee.

Modern welfare states include Germany, France, the Netherlands, as well as the Nordic countries, such as Iceland, Sweden, Norway, Denmark, and Finland which employ a system known as the Nordic model. Esping-Andersen classified the most developed welfare state systems into three categories; Social Democratic, Conservative, and Liberal.

A report published by the ILO in 2014 estimated only 27% of the world population has access to comprehensive social security. The World Bank&#x27;s 2019 World Development Report argues that the traditional payroll-based model of many kinds of social insurance are &quot;increasingly challenged by working arrangements outside standard employment contracts&quot;.

==Forms==
Welfare can take a variety of forms, such as monetary payments, subsidies and vouchers, or housing assistance. Welfare systems differ from country to country, but welfare is commonly provided to individuals who are unemployed, those with illness or disability, the elderly, those with dependent children, and veterans. Programs may have a variety of conditions for a person to receive welfare:
* Social insurance, state-sponsored programs based partly on individual contributions towards benefits such as healthcare, unemployment payments, and old-age pensions.
* Means-tested benefits, financial assistance provided for those who are unable to cover basic needs, such as food, clothing and housing, due to poverty or lack of income because of unemployment, sickness, disability, or caring for children. While assistance is often in the form of financial payments, those eligible for social welfare can usually access health and educational services free of charge. The amount of support is enough to cover basic needs and eligibility is often subject to a comprehensive and complex assessment of an applicant&#x27;s social and financial situation. See also Income Support.
* Non-contributory benefits. Several countries have special schemes, administered with no requirement for contributions and no means test, for people in certain categories of need, such as veterans of armed forces, people with disabilities, and very old people.
* Discretionary benefits. Some schemes are based on the decision of an official, such as a social worker.
* Universal or categorical benefits, also known as demogrants. These are non-contributory benefits given for whole sections of the population without a means test, such as family allowances or the public pension in New Zealand (known as New Zealand Superannuation). See also the Alaska Permanent Fund Dividend.
Not all citizens use their social rights. Selective social rights have higher non-take-up rate than universal social rights due to the complexity of the information and the Bureaucracy. Sometimes people need the help of other people to mediate their rights. 

===Social protection===

In developing countries, formal social security arrangements are often absent for the vast majority of the working population, in part due to reliance on the informal economy. Additionally, the state&#x27;s capacity to reach people may be limited because of its limited infrastructure and resources. In this context, &quot;social protection&quot; is often referred to instead of social security, encompassing a broader set of means, such as labour market intervention and local community-based programs, to alleviate poverty and provide security against things like unemployment.

==By country==
===Australia===
Prior to 1900 in Australia, charitable assistance from benevolent societies, sometimes with financial contributions from the authorities, was the primary means of relief for people not able to support themselves. The 1890s economic depression and the rise of the trade unions and the Labor parties during this period led to a movement for welfare reform.

In 1900, the states of New South Wales and Victoria enacted legislation introducing non-contributory pensions for those aged 65 and over. Queensland legislated a similar system in 1907 before the Australian labor Commonwealth government led by Andrew Fisher introduced a national aged pension under the Invalid and Old-Aged Pensions Act 1908. A national invalid disability pension was started in 1910, and a national maternity allowance was introduced in 1912.

During the Second World War, Australia under a labor government created a welfare state by enacting national schemes for: child endowment in 1941 (superseding the 1927 New South Wales scheme); a widows&#x27; pension in 1942 (superseding the New South Wales 1926 scheme); a wife&#x27;s allowance in 1943; additional allowances for the children of pensioners in 1943; and unemployment, sickness, and special benefits in 1945 (superseding the Queensland 1923 scheme).

===Canada===

Canada has a welfare state in the European tradition; however, it is not referred to as &quot;welfare&quot;, but rather as &quot;social programs&quot;. In Canada, &quot;welfare&quot; usually refers specifically to direct payments to poor individuals (as in the American usage) and not to healthcare and education spending (as in the European usage).

The Canadian social safety net covers a broad spectrum of programs, and because Canada is a federation, many are run by the provinces. Canada has a wide range of government transfer payments to individuals, which totaled $145billion in 2006. Only social programs that direct funds to individuals are included in that cost; programs such as medicare and public education are additional costs.

Generally speaking, before the Great Depression, most social services were provided by religious charities and other private groups. Changing government policy between the 1930s and 1960s saw the emergence of a welfare state, similar to many Western European countries. Most programs from that era are still in use, although many were scaled back during the 1990s as government priorities shifted towards reducing debt and deficits.

=== China ===
=== Czech Republic ===
Social welfare in Czech Republic is outlined in a series of social policies, as is the tradition in Europe. Their goal is primarily preventing, but also mitigating social situations individuals may find themselves in through their lives. The social welfare is provided through social (including pension) insurance, sick insurance (not to be confused with health insurance), public policy related to unemployment and low income benefits, which are financed through the government budget, and health insurance, which is financed through an array of insurance companies. Therefore, the social welfare program is usually separated into three categories: health insurance, social insurance and social benefits support.

Social insurance is a type of statutory insurance that provides citizens for a future unforeseen social event, such as unemployment or disability that would prevent an individual from working, but also planned retirement. Social insurance is therefore compulsory for all self-employed individuals, employees and employers operating in the Czech Republic and gets deducted from a salary in a similar manner to taxes. This insurance serves to finance unemployment support, disability benefits and covers a part of an employer&#x27;s salary in cases of long-term illness that obstructs them from participating in the workforce.

The sickness insurance system is intended for gainfully employed individuals who, in cases of short-term social events, are provided with health insurance benefits. These are provided through financial benefits. Sickness insurance participants are employees and self-employed individuals. Employees are compulsorily covered by sickness insurance, unlike the self-employed, whose sickness insurance is voluntary (and there is no penalisation for opting out of the insurance). It is calculated through a series of reductions of an assessment base. Employees&#x27; sickness insurance provides 4 types of sickness benefits: benefits for caring for a family member, pregnancy and maternity allowance, maternity allowance. It is standard to go on paid maternity leave in the Czech Republic, which ordinarily lasts 28 weeks. This period is prolonged to 37 weeks in the case of twins. Furthermore, there are special circumstances, such as the birth of a disabled child, when this period is extended even more. The beginning of maternity leave is usually 6 weeks before expected due date, and after maternity leave, it is possible to request further parental leave, which is optional and can be performed by either parent, regardless of gender. Parental leave lasts up to four years, depending on individual preferences.

Pension insurance is part of social insurance, in addition to sickness insurance and serves as a contribution to the state employment policy. It is a premium for old age retirement, disability retirement or benefits in the event of the death of the primary provider in a household. Participation in pension insurance is mandatory for economically active individuals. For those on various forms of benefits, or currently registered as a care provider, this insurance is provided by the state. The basic pension insurance provides, in time old-age pension (includes regular, proportional, early and other variants of old-age pension), disability benefits, widower&#x27;s and orphan&#x27;s pension. Pension insurance is applied for at the District Social Security Administration in the applicant&#x27;s place of permanent residence. They can apply in person or by proxy, on the basis of a notarized power of attorney. The amount of the pension consists of two component – the basic acreage and the percentage acreage.

Another form of pension is the disability pension. This is provided to individuals that are unable to participate in the workforce to the same degree as their able-bodied counterparts, due to their disability contributing to the decline of their ability to work (be it partially or entirely). There is a distinction between disability pension for individuals with first, second and third degree disability. The amount of the pension depends on the rate of decline of the person&#x27;s ability to work, with the categories being divided between the first degree (a decrease of 35–49%), the second degree (a decrease of 50–69%), and the third degree (a decrease of 70% and above).

Furthermore, there is a so-called widow&#x27;s / widower&#x27;s pension. Provided to widowed individuals from the Czech pension system, its aim is to compensate households for losing income that they would in this situation be lacking. The widowed individual is entitled to a pension from a deceased person who has received an old-age or disability pension or has fulfilled the statutory condition on the required insurance period at the date of death. The amount of the assessment is 10% of the average wage and the amount of the percentage assessment is 50% of the percentage of the old-age or disability pension to which the deceased was entitled at the time of their death.

===Denmark===
Danish welfare is handled by the state through a series of policies (and the like) that seeks to provide welfare services to citizens, hence the term welfare state. This refers not only to social benefits, but also tax-funded education, public child care, medical care, etc. A number of these services are not provided by the state directly, but administered by municipalities, regions or private providers through outsourcing. This sometimes gives a source of tension between the state and municipalities, as there is not always consistency between the promises of welfare provided by the state (i.e. parliament) and local perception of what it would cost to fulfill these promises.

=== Estonia ===

Estonia does have a welfare state that provides a range of social services and financial assistance to its citizens. The Estonian welfare state is a liberal welfare state, which means that it provides a minimal safety net for citizens in need and places a greater emphasis on individual responsibility and self-sufficiency. The Estonian welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security. It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families. The Estonian welfare state is funded through a mix of taxation and public spending, and it relies on a strong social security system to provide support to citizens in need. However, compared to other welfare states, it has relatively low levels of social spending and may rely more on private sector solutions to address social welfare issues.

===Finland===

The Finnish Nordic model welfare state is based on the principles of social equality and the belief that all citizens should have access to the same basic rights and opportunities. It provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security. It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families. The Finnish welfare state relies on a strong social security system to provide support to citizens in need. It also places a strong emphasis on promoting social cohesion and reducing income inequality, and it has a relatively high level of social spending compared to other countries.
===France===

Solidarity is a strong value of the French Social Protection system. The first article of the French Code of Social Security describes the principle of solidarity. Solidarity is commonly comprehended in relations of similar work, shared responsibility and common risks. Existing solidarities in France caused the expansion of health and social security.

===Germany===

The welfare state has a long tradition in Germany dating to the Industrial Revolution. Due to the pressure of the workers&#x27; movement in the late 19th century, Reichskanzler Otto von Bismarck introduced the first rudimentary state social insurance scheme. Under Adolf Hitler, the National Socialist Program stated &quot;We demand an expansion on a large scale of old age welfare.&quot; Today, the social protection of all its citizens is considered a central pillar of German national policy. 27.6 percent of Germany&#x27;s GDP is channeled into an all-embracing system of health, pension, accident, longterm care and unemployment insurance, compared to 16.2 percent in the US. In addition, there are tax-financed services such as child benefits (&quot;Kindergeld&quot;, beginning at €192 per month for the first and second child, €198 for the third and €223 for each child thereafter, until they attain 25 years or receive their first professional qualification), and basic provisions for those unable to work or anyone with an income below the poverty line.

Since 2005, reception of full unemployment pay (60–67% of the previous net salary) has been restricted to 12 months in general and 18 months for those over 55. This is now followed by (usually much lower) &quot;Arbeitslosengeld II (ALG II)&quot; or &quot;Sozialhilfe&quot;, which is independent of previous employment (Hartz IV concept).

, under ALG II, single adults receive up to €449 per month plus the cost of &#x27;adequate&#x27; housing. ALG II can also be paid partially to employed persons to supplement a low work income.

===India===

The Directive Principles of India, enshrined in part IV of the Indian Constitution, reflect that India is a welfare state. The National Food Security Act, 2013 aims to guarantee right to food to all citizens. The welfare system was fragmented until the passing of The Code on Social Security, 2020, which standardised most of the programmes.

The Government of India&#x27;s social programmes and welfare expenditures are a substantial portion of the official budget, and state and local governments play roles in developing and implementing social security policies. Additional welfare measure systems are also uniquely operated by various state governments. The government uses the Aadhaar system to distribute welfare measures in India. Some of the social programmes undertaken by the government are:

* Direct cash transfers for the poor.
* Financial inclusion of all individuals.
* Statutory insurances for health and accidents
* Free school meals
* Rural employment guarantee
* Various subsidies &amp; benefits
* Pensions &amp; provident funds

 the government&#x27;s expenditure on social programme and welfare was approximately , which was 8.3% of gross domestic product (GDP). In 2020, the expenditure was , accounting for 7.7% of GDP.

===Israel===
The Israeli government spend 86 billion NIS ($22.8 billion) in 2014. They are administered by the Ministry of Social Affairs and Social Services, and by Israel&#x27;s national social security agency, Bituah Leumi. Social security schemes include pensions for the elderly and the disabled, unemployment benefits, and income support for low income households. All residents of Israel must pay insurance contributions to qualify for welfare.

===Italy===

The Italian welfare state&#x27;s foundations were laid along the lines of the corporatist-conservative model, or of its Mediterranean variant. Later, in the 1960s and 1970s, increases in public spending and a major focus on universality brought it on the same path as social-democratic systems. In 1978, a universalistic welfare model was introduced in Italy, offering a number of universal and free services such as a National Health Fund.

===Japan===

Social welfare, assistance for the ill or otherwise disabled and for the old, has long been provided in Japan by both the government and private companies. Beginning in the 1920s, the government enacted a series of welfare programs, based mainly on European models, to provide medical care and financial support. During the postwar period, a comprehensive system of social security was gradually established.

===Latin America===
====History====
The 1980s marked a change in the structure of Latin American social protection programs. Social protection embraces three major areas: social insurance, financed by workers and employers; social assistance to the population&#x27;s poorest, financed by the state; and labor market regulations to protect worker rights. Although diverse, recent Latin American social policy has tended to concentrate on social assistance.

The 1980s, had a significant effect on social protection policies. Prior to the 1980s, most Latin American countries focused on social insurance policies involving formal sector workers, assuming that the informal sector would disappear with economic development. The economic crisis of the 1980s and the liberalization of the labor market led to a growing informal sector and a rapid increase in poverty and inequality. Latin American countries did not have the institutions and funds to properly handle such a crisis, both due to the structure of the social security system, and to the previously implemented structural adjustment policies (SAPs) that had decreased the size of the state.

New Welfare programs have integrated the multidimensional, social risk management, and capabilities approaches into poverty alleviation. They focus on income transfers and service provisions while aiming to alleviate both long- and short-term poverty through, among other things, education, health, security, and housing. Unlike previous programs that targeted the working class, new programs have successfully focused on locating and targeting the very poorest.

The impacts of social assistance programs vary between countries, and many programs have yet to be fully evaluated. According to Barrientos and Santibanez, the programs have been more successful in increasing investment in human capital than in bringing households above the poverty line. Challenges still exist, including the extreme inequality levels and the mass scale of poverty; locating a financial basis for programs; and deciding on exit strategies or on the long-term establishment of programs.

====1980s impacts====
The economic crisis of the 1980s led to a shift in social policies, as understandings of poverty and social programs evolved (24). New, mostly short-term programs emerged. These include:
* Argentina: &quot;Jefes y Jefas de Hogar&quot;, Asignación Universal por Hijo
* Bolivia: &quot;Bonosol&quot;
* Brazil: &quot;Bolsa Escola and Bolsa Familia&quot;
* Chile: &quot;Chile Solidario&quot;
* Colombia: &quot;Solidaridad por Colombia&quot;
* Ecuador: &quot;Bono de Desarrollo Humano&quot;
* Honduras: &quot;Red Solidaria&quot;
* Mexico: &quot;Prospera&quot; (earlier known as &quot;Oportunidades&quot;)
* Panama: &quot;Red de Oportunidades&quot;
* Peru: &quot;Juntos&quot;

====Major aspects of current social assistance programs====
* Conditional cash transfer (CCT) combined with service provisions. Transfer cash directly to households, most often through the women of the household, if certain conditions are met (e.g. children&#x27;s school attendance or doctor visits) (10). Providing free schooling or healthcare is often not sufficient, because there is an opportunity cost for the parents in, for example, sending children to school (lost labor power), or in paying for the transportation costs of getting to a health clinic.
* Household. The household has been the focal point of social assistance programs.
* Target the poorest. Recent programs have been more successful than past ones in targeting the poorest. Previous programs often targeted the working class.
* Multidimensional. Programs have attempted to address many dimensions of poverty at once. Chile Solidario is the best example.

===New Zealand===

New Zealand is often regarded as having one of the first comprehensive welfare systems in the world. During the 1890s, a Liberal government adopted many social programmes to help the poor who had suffered from a long economic depression in the 1880s. One of the most far reaching was the passing of tax legislation that made it difficult for wealthy sheep farmers to hold onto their large land holdings. This and the invention of refrigeration led to a farming revolution where many sheep farms were broken up and sold to become smaller dairy farms. This enabled thousands of new farmers to buy land and develop a new and vigorous industry that has become the backbone of New Zealand&#x27;s economy to this day. This liberal tradition flourished with increased enfranchisement for indigenous Māori in the 1880s and women. Pensions for the elderly, the poor and war casualties followed, with State-run schools, hospitals and subsidized medical and dental care. By 1960, New Zealand was able to afford one of the best-developed and most comprehensive welfare systems in the world, supported by a well-developed and stable economy.

===Norway===

Norway has a strong welfare state that provides a range of social services and financial assistance to its citizens. The Norwegian welfare state is based on the principles of social democracy, which means that it has a strong focus on reducing income inequality and promoting social cohesion. The Norwegian welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security. It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families.

===Philippines===

In Philippines, social welfare is mainly provided by the Department of Social Welfare and Development (DSWD). DSWD provides social welfare such as cash assistance (ayuda) and physical goods. The Pantawid Pamilyang Pilipino Program is one of the most well known social welfare programs by the DSWD where cash grants are given to parents and guardians in poverty to help their children continue schooling. This has assisted parents and guardians in poverty by helping them buy food and school supplies for their dependents. The Sustainable Livelihood Program (SLP) is also another social welfare program where the DSWD provides education, cash grants, or items such as vehicles and food stalls to individuals and communities to aid in their livelihoods. SLP grants are given to individuals such as street food vendors and organisations such as farmers cooperatives. DSWD also provides medical assistance for those who cannot afford the out-of-pocket cost of hospitalisation as Philhealth&#x27;s coverage usually does not cover the full expense. Other government agencies and companies also provide social welfare such as the Philippine Charity Sweepstakes Office, Department of Health, and offices of house representatives in their respective congressional districts.

===Poland===

The Polish welfare state provides a range of services, including universal healthcare, free education, and a comprehensive system of social security. It also provides financial assistance to citizens in need through programs such as unemployment benefits, housing assistance, and social assistance for low-income families. It has undergone significant changes in recent years, including the implementation of structural reforms and the introduction of market-oriented policies, which have had an impact on the level and quality of social services provided.

===Russia===

===Sri Lanka===

Sri Lanka has a long history of social programmes dating back to its ancient times, deep-rooted in the island&#x27;s Buddhist culture. Modern social welfare legislation dates back to the Donoughmore Constitution.

===South Africa===

===Spain===
Welfare in Spain is characterized by a Mediterranean Welfare state model based on three pillars: education, health, and pensions. As in most European countries, in Spain the Welfare State is a great achievement for its society since the State guarantees protection to all people who may find themselves in a situation of economic difficulty or any other. The social policies implemented by the Spanish State, as in the rest of Europe, are a set of measures and tools aimed at protecting and ensuring basic human needs, especially in the field of education, health, and economic security.

The Mediterranean Welfare state model is found not only in Spain, but also in countries such as Italy, Greece and Portugal, countries in the Mediterranean region where social protection arrived late, in the 70s and 80s of the 20th century. It is a model that mixes elements of the liberal (or Anglo-Saxon) and continental (or Bismarckian) welfare state. It is characterized as the welfare model with the lowest spending, with little investment in social assistance, a more fragmented social security system, and high spending on pensions, making pension benefits greater than unemployment benefits. One of the most particular features of the Mediterranean model is the large role of the family, which combines with the market and the state in the provision of welfare. Thus, the state assumes that the family covers certain services (such as childcare or care for the elderly), which in other models would be covered by the state. As for the labor market, it is characterized by high employment protection, the persistence of gender biases and a lower dispersion of workers&#x27; wages due to the importance of trade unions in negotiations.

The Spanish social welfare program can be separated into three categories or fundamental pillars: education, health, and pension system, as established in the Spanish Constitution ratified on December 29, 1978. It relies especially on Article 27 on education, Article 41 on the social security system and Article 50 on the pension system.

The beginnings of the Spanish Welfare state date back to the last decade of dictatorship, Francoist Spain, when it began to develop through the Social Security Law of 1963. Later, after the death of the dictator Francisco Franco and with the arrival of democracy, it would be when the existence of public needs not covered by the State became evident, and when education, health and social services were universalized. This advance of the welfare state was also marked by the economic crisis, which led to a deterioration of the labor market and highlighted the need to increase public spending to offer greater protection to the retired and unemployed.

Social policies in Spain constitute a set of legislation, decisions and activities that seek to promote the welfare of all Spaniards and improve their quality of life, facilitating access to society&#x27;s goods and resources to cover their basic needs and respond to complex situations that citizens may face. These policies are governed by the principles of equality and equity. The social policies of the Spanish State, like those of most countries in the world, are in line with the UN Sustainable Development Goals, and, as the rest of the European Welfare States, also depend on the guidelines of a higher body, the European Union.

Among these policies are those oriented towards healthcare, social welfare policies to prevent and end poverty, free education, social security policies, security and justice policies or access to housing. Free public health care policies are aimed at improving people&#x27;s living conditions and provide the medical and pharmaceutical services necessary to protect and restore the health of the insured. Health care is one of the benefits universally recognized for all citizens.

Education is another of the pillars of Spanish welfare. Educational policies are focused on guaranteeing access to the entire population, without any kind of discrimination, to free and compulsory general basic education from the age of 6 to 16. After that, citizens can also have free access to high school and vocational training. University studies, although not free, are also financed by the Spanish State. The educational model has a decentralized character and the competences, functions, services, and resources in the field of education have been transferred from the central government to the different Spanish autonomous communities in both university and non-university matters.

Finally, the third pillar of the Spanish welfare state is the pension system. The Spanish pension system includes a wide variety of pensions including widow&#x27;s pensions, contributory pensions, and non-contributory pensions. The widow&#x27;s pension covers people who suffer the death of their spouse. Contributory pensions are transfers from the state that depend on the worker&#x27;s previous contribution and vary according to the number of years worked and the worker&#x27;s contribution. Non-contributory pensions, on the other hand, have a welfare character and cover people for disability or retirement (if they have not contributed enough to qualify for a contributory pension). This public pension model is often supported by a private dimension formed by pension plans to which workers contribute a percentage of their salary during their working life, to receive a larger pension during their retirement.

In Spain, the welfare state is considered to be very scarce and less developed, especially compared to the European Union average, where social policies and the welfare state are strongly developed. Spain lags behind EU values in social protection spending measured both as a percentage of GDP and in absolute terms and in the proportion of adults working in state services. However, public spending in general, compared to the rest of the world, is very high. Moreover, the Spanish welfare state is polarized, which means that the higher income groups use private services (especially in health and education), while the lower income groups use public services.

The Spanish state&#x27;s low investment in public spending affects the quality of its services. As for healthcare, almost all healthcare competencies have been transferred from the State to the Autonomous Communities. Public health spending is below the average of the European Union, in 2020 it was around 8% of GDP or €1907 per capita, while the European Union average stood at €2,244 per capita. It is even more worrying when the spending figure is separated between what is invested in healthcare as such and what is invested in the pharmaceutical industry. This ends up causing a great lack of resources and deficiencies in the Spanish healthcare system, such as long waiting lists, even for life-threatening operations, scarce primary care, etc. These deficiencies have accentuated the polarization of the Welfare State and have made the private sector acquire great importance in Spanish healthcare, becoming more similar to the healthcare systems in Latin America than in Europe.

Education is another of the pillars that support the Spanish Welfare state, but it also has a polarizing character in society. The low state investment in public education has led to an increase in the number of private and charter schools that have greater resources and create inequality in basic compulsory education.

===Sub-Saharan Africa===

===Sweden===
Social welfare in Sweden is made up of several organizations and systems dealing with welfare. It is mostly funded by taxes, and executed by the public sector on all levels of government as well as private organizations. It can be separated into three parts falling under three different ministries; social welfare, falling under the responsibility of Ministry of Health and Social Affairs; education, under the responsibility of the Ministry of Education and Research and labor market, under the responsibility of Ministry of Employment.

Government pension payments are financed through an 18.5% pension tax on all taxed incomes in the country, which comes partly from a tax category called a public pension fee (7% on gross income), and 30% of a tax category called employer fees on salaries (which is 33% on a netted income). Since January 2001, the 18.5% is divided in two parts: 16% goes to current payments, and 2.5% goes into individual retirement accounts, which were introduced in 2001. Money saved and invested in government funds, and IRAs for future pension costs, are roughly five times annual government pension expenses (725/150).

Viewing Swedish welfare more broadly, it emerges as highly rated in many standard international comparisons of welfare or well-being (e.g. World Economic Forum 2020). However, some Nordic-based welfare and gender researchers have argued that such assessments, based on conventional welfare/well-being criteria, may to some extent over-privilege Sweden (and other Nordic countries) in terms of, for instance, gender and racial equality. For example, they suggest that if one takes a broader perspective on well-being incorporating issues associated with bodily integrity or bodily citizenship (Pringle 2011), then some major forms of men&#x27;s domination and/or white privilege can be seen to still stubbornly persist in the Nordic countries, e.g. business, violence to women, sexual violence to children, the military, academia and religion (Hearn and Pringle 2006; Hearn et al. 2018; Pringle 2016).

===United Kingdom===

;UK Government welfare expenditure 2011–12:

* State pension (46.32%)
* Housing Benefit (10.55%)
* Disability Living Allowance (7.87%)
* Pension Credit (5.06%)
* Income Support (4.31%)
* Rent rebates (3.43%)
* Attendance Allowance (3.31%)
* Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance (3.06%)
* Incapacity Benefit (3.06%)
* Council Tax Benefit (3%)
* Other (10.03%)

The United Kingdom has a long history of welfare, notably including the English Poor laws which date back to 1536. After various reforms to the program, which involved workhouses, it was eventually abolished and replaced with a modern system by laws such as the National Assistance Act 1948 (11 &amp; 12 Geo. 6. c. 29).

In more recent times, comparing the Cameron–Clegg coalition&#x27;s austerity measures with the Opposition&#x27;s, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; commentator Martin Wolf commented that the &quot;big shift from Labour... is the cuts in welfare benefits.&quot; The government&#x27;s austerity programme, which involves reduction in government policy, has been linked to a rise in food banks. A study published in the &quot;British Medical Journal&quot; in 2015 found that each one percentage point increase in the rate of Jobseeker&#x27;s Allowance claimants sanctioned was associated with a 0.09 percentage point rise in food bank use. The austerity programme has faced opposition from disability rights groups for disproportionately affecting disabled people. The &quot;bedroom tax&quot; is an austerity measure that has attracted particular criticism, with activists arguing that two-thirds of council houses affected by the policy are occupied with a person with a disability.

===United States===

In the United States, depending on the context, the term &quot;welfare&quot; can be used to refer to means-tested cash benefits, especially the Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) program and its successor, the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families block grants, or it can be used to refer to all means-tested programs that help individuals or families meet basic needs, including, for example, health care through Medicaid, Supplemental Security Income (SSI) benefits and food and nutrition programs (SNAP). It can also include social insurance programs such as unemployment insurance, Social Security, and Medicare.

AFDC (originally called Aid to Dependent Children) was created during the Great Depression to alleviate the burden of poverty for families with children and allow widowed mothers to maintain their households. The New Deal employment program such as the Works Progress Administration primarily served men. Prior to the New Deal, anti-poverty programs were primarily operated by private charities or state or local governments; however, these programs were overwhelmed by the depth of need during the Depression. 

Until early in the year 1965, the news media conveyed the idea that only white people lived in poverty, but then black people were presented more often than white people in this plight. Some of the influences on this shift may have been the civil rights movement and urban riots from the mid 1960s. Welfare had by then shifted from being a white issue to being a black issue and during this time frame the war on poverty had already begun. Subsequently, news media portrayed stereotypes of black people as lazy and undeserving and as welfare queens. These shifts in media presentation did not necessarily reflect a decrease in the percentage of the population living in poverty.
In 1996, the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Reconciliation Act changed the structure of Welfare payments and added new criteria to states that received Welfare funding. After reforms that President Clinton said would &quot;end Welfare as we know it&quot;, amounts from the federal government were given out in a flat rate per state based on population. Each state must meet certain criteria to ensure recipients are being encouraged to work themselves out of Welfare. The new program is called Temporary Assistance for Needy Families (TANF). It encourages states to require some sort of employment search in exchange for providing funds to individuals, and imposes a five-year lifetime limit on cash assistance. In FY 2010, 31.8% of TANF families were White, 31.9% were African-American, and 30.0% were Hispanic.

According to the U.S. Census Bureau data released 13 September 2011, the nation&#x27;s poverty rate rose to 15.1% (46.2 million) in 2010, up from 14.3% (approximately 43.6 million) in 2009 and to its highest level since 1993. In 2008, 13.2% (39.8 million) Americans lived in relative poverty.

In a 2011 op-ed in &quot;Forbes&quot;, Peter Ferrara stated that, &quot;The best estimate of the cost of the 185 federal means tested Welfare programs for 2010 for the federal government alone is nearly $700billion, up a third since 2008, according to the Heritage Foundation. Counting state spending, total Welfare spending for 2010 reached nearly $900billion, up nearly one-fourth since 2008 (24.3%).&quot; California, with 12% of the U.S. population, has one-third of the nation&#x27;s welfare recipients.

The United States has also typically relied on charitable giving through non-profit agencies and fundraising instead of direct monetary assistance from the government itself. According to Giving USA, Americans gave $358.38billion to charity in 2014. This is rewarded by the United States government through tax credits for individuals and companies that are not typically seen in other countries. Since these per capita charity sums are much higher than in all other countries, this means that private people and companies have a strong say in how social assistance is carried out. This means that public funds in the form of unpaid taxes are distributed according to less professional, less objective, and less unbiased criteria than in all other countries.

==Effects==

The welfare-to-work intervention programme is unlikely to have any impacts on the mental and physical health of lone parents and children. Even when the employment and income rates were higher in this group of people, the poverty rate was high which could lead to persistently high rates of depression whether they were in the programme or not.

Income transfers can be either conditional or unconditional. 
Conditionalities are sometimes criticized as being paternalistic and unnecessary, and research in different contexts shows enforcing conditionalities can result in additional burdens for recipients and social service providers.

A 2008 study by welfare economist and Brown University Professor Allan M. Feldman suggests that welfare can achieve both competitive equilibrium and Pareto efficiency in the market, although different points of Pareto efficiency are more fair to some than others.

Some opponents of welfare argue that it affects work incentives.

===Perception===
According to a 2012 review study, whether a welfare program generates public support depends on:

* whether the program is universal or targeted towards certain groups
* the size of the social program benefits (larger benefits incentivize greater mobilization to defend a social program)
* the visibility and traceability of the benefits (whether recipients know where the benefits come from)
* the proximity and concentration of the beneficiaries (this affects the ease by which beneficiaries can organize to protect a social program)
* the duration of the benefits (longer benefits incentivize greater mobilization to defend a social program)
* the manner in which a program is administered (whether the program is inclusive and follow principles)

<doc id="247824" wikidata="Q1815494" url="?curid=247824" title="Schnapps">
<text>Schnapps ( or ) or schnaps is a type of alcoholic beverage that may take several forms, including distilled fruit brandies, herbal liqueurs, infusions, and &quot;flavored liqueurs&quot; made by adding fruit syrups, spices, or artificial flavorings to neutral grain spirits.

The English loanword &quot;schnapps&quot; is derived from the colloquial German word &quot;Schnaps&quot; (plural: &quot;Schnäpse&quot;), which is used in reference to spirit drinks.
The word &quot;Schnaps&quot; stems from Low German and is related to the German term &quot;schnappen&quot;, meaning &quot;snap&quot;, which refers to the spirit usually being consumed in a quick slug from a small glass (i.e., a shot glass).

==European==

The German term &quot;Schnaps&quot; refers to &quot;any kind of strong, dry spirit&quot;, similar to how &quot;eau de vie&quot; (water of life) is used in French, &quot;aguardiente&quot; (burning water) in Spanish, or &quot;aguardente&quot; in Portuguese.

===&quot;Obstler&quot;===

An &quot;Obstler&quot;, or &quot;Obstbrand&quot; (from the German &quot;Obst&quot;, fruit and &quot;Brand&quot;, brandy), is a traditional type of schnaps made by fermenting macerated fruit and distilling to produce a clear, unsweetened fruit brandy. &quot;Obstler&quot; is traditionally produced in Austria, Switzerland, northern Slovenia, southern Germany, and the culturally German regions of Alsace and Lorraine in modern-day France. &quot;Obstler&quot; is mainly associated with the southern part of the German-language area; in northern Germany, almost all traditional distilled beverages are grain-based.

The main kinds of fruit used for &quot;Obstbrände&quot; are apples, apricots, cherries, pears, plums (both mirabelle and purple plums), and quinces. Fruits other than these are rarely used. Apples together with pears produce &quot;Obstwasser&quot; (fruit water); pears are used to produce &quot;Birnenbrand&quot;; when made from the Williams pear, it is known as Poire Williams or &quot;Williamsbrand&quot;. Several types of plums make &quot;&quot; (&quot;plum water&quot;); cherries make &quot;Kirschwasser&quot; (&quot;cherry water&quot;); and apricots are used to make Austrian &quot;Marillenschnaps&quot; (apricot brandy).

The different kinds of &quot;Obstler&quot; are similar to the varieties of &quot;Rakija&quot; found in the Balkans and Eastern Europe. &quot;Slivovitz&quot; is a popular schnapps made from Damson plums found throughout the region; &quot;pálinka&quot; is a traditional distilled beverage made of any fruits grown in Hungary.

===&quot;Geist&quot;===
A &quot;Geist&quot; (meaning &quot;spirit&quot; in German) is a type of &quot;schnapps&quot;, similar to fruit brandy, that is created by infusing macerated fresh berries in neutral spirits and steeping for some time before distillation. Neutral alcohol is necessary because many berries have a sugar content that is too low to economically ferment and distill; raspberries, for instance, contain between 4.5 and 6.0% sugar.

The most common &quot;Geist&quot; is &quot;Himbeergeist&quot;, made from raspberries. Other common fruits are blueberries, blackberries, strawberries, currants, rowanberries, apricots, peaches, and sloes. Other flavorings are also possible, such as nuts, herbs, or rose petals.

===Liqueur===
Many liqueurs referred to as schnapps, but distinct from fruit brandies, are created by the addition of herbal or fruit flavors to a neutral spirit by various methods. The neutral spirit used can vary by location and tradition.

The most popular schnapps in the UK is peach schnapps. It is consumed in a variety of ways, such as on the rocks, or mixed with other drinks to form a variety of cocktails. It is made by adding peach flavouring to a neutral grain spirit. It is typically clear and has a strong, sweet taste. It became popular in the UK in the 1970s and 1980s. The leading brand is Archers, but some large supermarkets do have their own branded peach schnapps, which is sold at a reduced price. Archers peach schnapps is more similar to the American style of schnapps.

&quot;Kräuterlikör&quot; (herbal liqueur) is similar to Italian &quot;amaro&quot;. Well-known brands include Jägermeister, Underberg, Kuemmerling, Killepitsch, and Wurzelpeter.

==American==
An inexpensive, heavily sweetened form of liqueur is made in America by mixing neutral grain spirit with fruit syrup, spices, or other flavors. Referred to as &quot;schnapps&quot;, these are bottled with an alcohol content typically between 15 and 20% ABV (30–40 proof), though some may be much higher. Schnapps, specifically peach and peppermint schnapps, exploded in popularity in America in the 1980s.

An Aber Gut (German for &quot;but good&quot;) is a traditional Wisconsin cocktail made with a shot of brandy topped off with a splash of (usually peppermint) schnapps. It is popular in the fall and winter for its apparent warming properties, and a similar drink is found in Minnesota called a Snowball.

<text>Gars are an ancient group of ray-finned fish in the family Lepisosteidae. They comprise seven living species of fish in two genera that inhabit fresh, brackish, and occasionally marine waters of eastern North America, Central America and Cuba in the Caribbean, though extinct members of the family were more widespread. They are the only surviving members of the Ginglymodi, a clade of fish which first appeared during the Triassic period, over 240 million years ago, and are one of only two surviving groups of holosteian fish, alongside the bowfins, which have a similar distribution. 

Gars have elongated bodies that are heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Gars are sometimes referred to as &quot;garpike&quot;, but are not closely related to pike, which are in the fish family Esocidae. All of the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (&quot;Atractosteus spatula&quot;) is the largest; the alligator gar often grows to a length over and a weight over , and specimens of up to in length have been reported. Unusually, their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, and most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air. Gar flesh is edible and the hard skin and scales of gars are used by humans, but gar eggs are highly toxic.

The name &quot;gar&quot; was originally used for a species of needlefish (&quot;Belone belone&quot;) found in the North Atlantic and likely took its name from the Old English word for &quot;spear&quot;. &quot;Belone belone&quot; is now more commonly referred to as the &quot;garfish&quot; or &quot;gar fish&quot; to avoid confusion with the North American gars of the family Lepisosteidae. Confusingly, the name &quot;garfish&quot; is also commonly used for a number of other species of the related genera &quot;Strongylura, Tylosurus&quot;, and &quot;Xenentodon&quot; of the family Belonidae.

The generic name &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;lepis&quot; meaning &quot;scale&quot; and &quot;osteon&quot; meaning &quot;bone&quot;. &quot;Atractosteus&quot; is similarly derived from Greek, in this case from &quot;atraktos&quot;, meaning &quot;arrow.&quot;

== Evolution ==

=== Evolutionary history ===
Gars are considered to be the only surviving members of the Ginglymodi, a group of bony fish that flourished in the Mesozoic. The oldest known ginglymodians appeared during the Middle Triassic, over 240 million years ago. Because they have the slowest known rate of molecular evolution among all jawed vertebrates, it has also slowed down their rate of speciation. The closest living relatives of gars are the bowfin, with the gars and bowfin together forming the clade Holostei; both lineages diverged during the Late Permian.

The closest extinct relatives of gar are the Obaichthyidae, an extinct group of gar-like fishes from the Early Cretaceous of Africa and South America, which likely diverged from the ancestors of true gars during the Late Jurassic. The oldest anatomically modern gar is &quot;Nhanulepisosteus&quot; from the Upper Jurassic (Kimmeridgian) of Mexico, around 157 million years old. &quot;Nhanulepisosteus&quot; inhabited a marine environment unlike modern gars, indicating that gars may have originally been marine fish prior to invading freshwater habitats before the Early Cretaceous. Although most succeeding gar fossils are known from freshwater environments, at least some marine gars are known to have persisted into the Late Cretaceous, with the likely marine &quot;Herreraichthys&quot; known from Mexico and the definitely marine &quot;Grandemarinus&quot; known from Morocco. 

Gars diversified in western North America throughout the Early Cretaceous. &quot;Atractosteus&quot; and &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; had already diverged by the end of the Early Cretaceous, about 105 million years ago. From western North America, gars dispersed to regions as disparate as Africa, India, South America and Europe, and fossil remains of gars were widespread worldwide by the end of the Cretaceous.

Several different gar genera survived the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction event, although they remained restricted to North America and Europe after this point. One species (&quot;Atractosteus grandei&quot;, a relative of the modern alligator gar) is the oldest known articulated vertebrate specimen of the Cenozoic, with one fossil specimen dated to just a few thousand years after the Chicxulub impact, indicating a rapid recovery of freshwater ecosystems. Two short-snouted gar genera, &quot;Masillosteus&quot; and &quot;Cuneatus&quot;, are known from the Eocene in western North America and Europe, but disappear shortly afterwards. &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; and &quot;Atractosteus&quot; show a similar initial distribution and eventual contraction, but both genera dispersed to eastern North America prior to their disappearance from western North America and Europe, with &quot;Atractosteus&quot; also dispersing further south to the Neotropics. Eastern North America has since served as a vital refugium for gars, with &quot;Lepisosteus&quot; undergoing a diversification throughout it.

=== Phylogeny ===
The following phylogeny of extant and fossil gar genera was found by Brownstein &quot;et al&quot;. (2022):

A slightly different phylogeny was found by Cooper &quot;et al&quot; (2023):

==Distribution==

Fossils indicate that gars formerly had a wider distribution, having been found on every continent except Australia and Antarctica. Living gars are confined to North America. The distribution of the gars in North America lies mainly in the shallow, brackish waters off of Texas, Louisiana, and the eastern coast of Mexico, as well as in some of the rivers and lakes that flow into them. A few populations are also present in the Great Lakes region of the United States, living in similar shallow waters.

==Anatomy==
===Scales===
Gar bodies are elongated, heavily armored with ganoid scales, and fronted by similarly elongated jaws filled with long, sharp teeth. Their tails are heterocercal, and the dorsal fins are close to the tail.

===Swim bladder===
As their vascularised swim bladders can function as lungs, most gars surface periodically to take a gulp of air, doing so more frequently in stagnant or warm water when the concentration of oxygen in the water is low. Experiments on the swim bladder has shown that the temperature of the water affects which respiration method the gar will use - aerial or aquatic. They increase the aerial breathing rate (breathing air) as the temperature of the water is increased. Gars can live completely submerged in oxygenated water without access to air and remain healthy while also being able to survive in deoxygenated water if allowed access to air. This adaptation can be the result of environmental pressures and behavioral factors. As a result of this organ, they are extremely resilient and able to tolerate conditions that most other fish could not survive.

===Pectoral girdle===
The gar has paired pectoral fins and pelvic fins, as well as an anal fin, a caudal fin, and a dorsal fin. The bone structures within the fins are important to study as they can show homology throughout the fossil record. Specifically, the pelvic girdle resembles that of other actinopterygians while still having some of its own characteristics. Gars have a postcleithrun - which is a bone that is lateral to the scapula, but do not have postpectorals. Proximally to the postcleithrum, the supracleithrum is important as it plays a critical role in opening the gar&#x27;s jaws. This structure has a unique internal coracoid lamina only present in the gar species. Near the supracleithrum is the posttemporal bone, which is significantly smaller than other actinopterygians. Gars also have no clavicle bone, although elongated plates have been observed within the area.

===Morphology===

All the gars are relatively large fish, but the alligator gar (&quot;Atractosteus spatula&quot;) is the largest. The largest alligator gar ever caught and officially recorded was long, weighed , and was around the girth. Even the smaller species, such as &quot;Lepisosteus oculatus&quot;, are large, commonly reaching lengths of over , and sometimes much longer.

==Ecology==
Gars tend to be slow-moving fish except when striking at their prey. They prefer the shallow and weedy areas of rivers, lakes, and bayous, often congregating in small groups. They are voracious predators, catching their prey in their needle-like teeth with a sideways strike of the head. They feed extensively on smaller fish and invertebrates such as crabs. Gars are found across much of the eastern portion of North America. Although gars are found primarily in freshwater habitats, several species enter brackish waters and a few, most notably &quot;Atractosteus tristoechus&quot;, are sometimes found in the sea. Some gars travel from lakes and rivers through sewers to get to ponds.

==Species and identification==
The gar family contains seven extant species, in two genera. This list also includes definitively known fossil taxa, common names for which are based on Grande (2010):

=== Alligator gar ===
The largest member of the gar family, the alligator gar &quot;(Atractosteus spatula&quot;), can measure up to 10 feet long and weigh over 300 pounds. Its body and snout are wide and stocky, and it was named &quot;alligator gar&quot; because locals often mistook it for an alligator. The species can be found in Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, the Mississippi River, Ohio, the Missouri river, and the southern drainages into Mexico. Its habitat consists of lakes and bays with slow currents. The gars grow rapidly when young and continue to grow at a slower rate after reaching adulthood. They are deep green or yellow in color. Recreational fishing of the alligator gar became popular due to its massive size and its meat is sold for food. Over five decades of overfishing have brought it close to extinction, and man-made dams have contributed to this loss by restricting the gar&#x27;s access to the flood plain areas in which it spawns. Some U.S. states have enacted laws to combat overfishing, and reintroduction programs are being carried out in some states, such as Illinois, where human activity has extirpated the gar. Before being released, each gar must meet a length requirement to ensure that it has the best chance of survival in the wild. Some states, such as Texas, restrict the number of gar that may be caught in a day, the season in which they may be caught, and the equipment anglers may use to catch them. Some states also impose a minimum length requirement to prevent gar from being caught at too early an age. Scientists have found that the alligator gar can help maintain ecosystem balance by eating invasive species such as the Asian carp, and their success in a particular area can show scientists that area may also make a suitable habitat for other migratory species.

=== Florida gar ===
The Florida gar &quot;(Lepisosteus platyrhincus&quot;) can be found in the Ocklockonee river, Florida, and Georgia, and prefers muddy or sandy bottoms with bountiful vegetation. It is commonly confused with its cousin, the spotted gar. Uneven black spots cover its head, body, and fins. Green-brown scales run along the back of its body, and the scales on its underbelly are white or yellow. This coloration, which blends well with the gar&#x27;s surroundings, allows it to ambush its prey. The Florida gar has no ganoid scales on its throat. Female Florida gars grow to lengths between 13 and 34 inches, bigger than their male counterparts.

=== Spotted gar ===
The spotted gar &quot;(Lepisosteus oculatus)&quot; is a smaller species of gar, measuring just under four feet long and weighing 15 pounds on average. Like Florida gars, female spotted gars are typically larger than male spotted gars. This gar has dark spots covering its head, body, and fins. Its body is compact, and it has a shorter snout. It prefers to live in clearer shallow water with a depth of 3–5 meters, and to surround itself in foliage. Its habitat ranges from the waters of Lake Michigan, the Lake Erie Basin, the Mississippi River System, and river drainages along the northern coast of the Gulf of Mexico from the Nueces River in Texas east to the lower Apalachicola River in Florida. It shares its habitat with the alligator gar, its main predator. These smaller gar live an average of 18 years.

=== Shortnose gar ===

The shortnose gar (&quot;Lepisosteus platostomus)&quot; is found in the Mississippi River Basin, Indiana, Wisconsin, Montana, Alabama, and Louisiana. It prefers to live in lakes, swamps, and calm pools. The shortnose gar takes its name from its snout, which is shorter and broader than that of other gar species. Like the longnose gar, it has one row of teeth. The upper jaw is longer than the rest of its head. The shortnose gar is deep green or brown in color, similar to the alligator gar. Depending on the clarity of water, spots can be present on the caudal, dorsal, and anal fins. The shortnose gar has a lifespan of 20 years, reaches up to 5 pounds in weight, and grows to lengths of 24–35 inches. It consumes more invertebrates than any other gar, and their stomachs have been found to contain higher Asian carp content than any other native North American fish.

=== Longnose gar ===
The Longnose gar &quot;(Lepisosteus osseus)&quot; has a longer, narrower, more cylindrical body, and can be distinguished from other species of gar by its snout, which is more than twice the length of the rest of its head. It can reach up to 6 feet and 8 inches in length and weigh up to 35–80 pounds. Like the shortnose gar, it has only a single row of teeth. Unlike its relatives, it enters brackish water from time to time. Females are larger and live longer than the male longnose gar. Females live 22 years, and males about half as long. There are spots on the head, dorsal, anal, and caudal fins. Depending on the water clarity, the longnose gar comes in two colors. In clear water, they&#x27;re a dark deep green color. In muddy waters, it is more brown in color. Edges of the ganoid scales and in between are black. These types of gar are occasionally fished by locals, and blamed for eating other fish in the rivers. The longnose gar has a large range of territory in North America, into the Gulf of Mexico. Located in Florida, Quebec, all Great Lakes except Lake Superior, Missouri, Mississippi, Texas, and northern Mexico.

==Roe==
The flesh of gar is edible, but its eggs contain an ichthyotoxin, a type of protein toxin which is highly toxic to humans. The protein can be denatured when brought to a temperature of 120 degrees Celsius, but as the roe&#x27;s temperature does not typically reach that level when it is cooked, even cooked roe causes severe symptoms. It was once thought that the production of the toxin in gar roe was an evolutionary adaptation to provide protection for the eggs, but bluegills and channel catfish fed gar eggs in experiments remained healthy, even though they are the natural predators of the gar eggs. Crayfish fed the roe were not immune to the toxin, and most died. The roe&#x27;s toxicities to humans and crayfish may be coincidences, however, and not the result of explicit natural selection.
==Significance to humans==
Several species are traded as aquarium fish. The hard ganoid scales of gars are sometimes used to make jewelry whereas the tough skin is used to make such items as lamp shades. Historically, Native Americans used gar scales as arrowheads, native Caribbeans used the skin for breastplates, and early American pioneers covered the blades of their plows with gar skin. It is suspected that gars have an unusually strong DNA repair apparatus. If confirmed by further studies, it could be used in medical treatments against human diseases like cancer.

Not much is known about the precise function of the gar in Native American religion and culture other than the ritual &quot;garfish dances&quot; that have been performed by Creek and Chickasaw tribes.

<text>Maiden England (re-released in 2013 as Maiden England &#x27;88) is a live video by the band Iron Maiden during their &quot;Seventh Son of a Seventh Son&quot; world tour, which was dubbed Seventh Tour of a Seventh Tour.

It was recorded at the National Exhibition Centre in Birmingham on 27 and 28 November 1988, released on VHS in November 1989, followed by a limited VHS/CD edition in 1994. The CD in this package does not include two songs that are in the video (&quot;Can I Play with Madness&quot; and &quot;Hallowed Be Thy Name&quot;), due to space limitations. In 2013, the full concert footage, including encores which were not featured in the original VHS, was reissued on DVD, CD and LP under the new title, &quot;Maiden England &#x27;88&quot;.

The video was directed and edited by Steve Harris, Iron Maiden&#x27;s founder and bassist.

==Background==
After sitting in on the editing process of their music videos, and having been less involved in their previous concert video, &quot;Live After Death&quot;, the band&#x27;s bassist, Steve Harris, decided that he would direct and edit their next film. According to Harris, the band decided to document the Birmingham concerts because he &quot;wanted to film with 10 cameras so we needed to do it in a place where that amount of equipment wouldn&#x27;t get in the way of the paying punters.&quot; This narrowed the band&#x27;s options down to the NEC and Wembley Arena, but eventually chose the former as they were more &quot;amenable about the idea&quot;. According to manager Rod Smallwood, Harris&#x27; briefing to the camera crew was to try and film &quot;as the fans saw it&quot;, with Harris arguing that this would be a good way to capture the concert&#x27;s atmosphere.

So that he could edit the video at his own pace, Harris bought all of the necessary equipment himself and installed it at his home in Essex, where he worked on the film for six months. Although they occasionally visited Harris to check on his progress, the rest of the band were largely uninvolved in the project, although, at his insistence, a piece of footage showing guitarist Dave Murray mouthing the lyrics to the opening song was removed.

A DVD re-issue of the concert film was first mentioned by Iron Maiden in September 2007, with a release date set for 2008, but was later delayed. In an interview with German magazine &quot;Rock Hard&quot; in August 2012, Harris confirmed that &quot;Maiden England&quot; would be re-released in 2013, with the concert footage expanded to comprise the show&#x27;s encores which were not included in the original VHS. On 12 February 2013, Iron Maiden announced that &quot;Maiden England&quot; would be re-released on DVD, CD and picture disc on 25 March 2013 under the title &quot;Maiden England &#x27;88&quot;. Along with the aforementioned encores, the new video also includes the third part of the &quot;History of Iron Maiden&quot; documentary series (continuing from 2004&#x27;s &quot;The History of Iron Maiden – Part 1: The Early Days&quot; and 2008&#x27;s &quot;Live After Death&quot; re-issue) as well as promo videos and the 1987 documentary &quot;12 Wasted Years&quot;.

From 2012 to 2014, Iron Maiden undertook the Maiden England World Tour, which is largely based around the original video in setlist and stage design.

==Critical reception==

AllMusic gave the original VHS 4 out of 5, deeming it &quot;a strong effort&quot;, but also stating that it is &quot;risky... because it doesn&#x27;t rely on hits&quot; and that it &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the seminal power of [their] own extraordinary &quot;Live After Death&quot; from four years earlier&quot;. They also gave four marks to the 2013 reissue, arguing that the additional songs &quot;help to turn the live set into a more well-rounded listening experience&quot;, concluding that it is &quot;a solid concert that shows one of the most influential bands in heavy metal getting down to business and bringing some epic metal to an enthralled crowd&quot;.

&quot;Classic Rock&quot; gave the 2013 DVD a score of 8 out of 10, remarking that the concert footage is &quot;a succinct encapsulation of how great Maiden are when all the gears mesh together&quot;, concluding that &quot;when it comes to creating a fan-pleasing effort, no one does it with quite the same degree of thought as Maiden.&quot;

<doc id="247836" wikidata="Q847836" url="?curid=247836" title="List of mass panic cases">
<text>In sociology and psychology, mass hysteria is a phenomenon that transmits collective illusions of threats, whether real or imaginary, through a population and society as a result of rumors and fear. In medicine, the term is used to describe the spontaneous manifestation—or production of chemicals in the body—of the same or similar hysterical physical symptoms by more than one person.

A common type of mass hysteria occurs when a group of people believes that they have a similar disease or ailment, sometimes referred to as &quot;mass sociogenic illness&quot; or &quot;epidemic hysteria&quot;.

==Middle Ages==
* According to an account which was written by an author in 1784, a nun who lived in a German convent in the 15th century began to bite her companions, and the behavior soon spread through other convents in Germany, Holland and Italy.
*In &quot;The Epidemics of the Middle Ages&quot;, an 1844 collection of works written by J. F. C. Hecker (and translated by Benjamin Guy Babington), a translator&#x27;s note by Babington, citing an unnamed medical textbook, recalls the story of a nun who lived in a French convent during an unspecified time (presumably in the Middle Ages) who inexplicably began to meow like a cat, shortly leading the other nuns in the convent to meow as well. Eventually, all of the nuns in the convent would meow together for a certain period, leaving the surrounding community astonished. This did not stop until the police threatened to whip the nuns.

==1500–1800==
* Witch trials in the early modern period from 1450 to 1750 and especially from 1580 to 1630.
* Dancing plague of 1518 – a case of dancing mania that occurred in Strasbourg, Alsace (then part of the Holy Roman Empire) in July 1518 wherein numerous people took to dancing for days.
* Irish Fright (1688) – In England and parts of Wales in December 1688 during the Glorious Revolution, false reports that Irish soldiers were burning and massacring English towns prompted a mass panic in at least 19 counties, with thousands of people arming themselves and preparing to resist non-existent groups of marauding Irishmen.
* Salem witch trials (1692−1693) – In colonial Massachusetts, adolescent girls Abigail Williams, Betty Parris, Ann Putnam Jr., and Elizabeth Hubbard began to have fits that were described by a minister as &quot;beyond the power of epileptic fits or natural disease to effect.&quot; The events resulted in the Salem witch trials, a series of hearings which resulted in the execution of 20 citizens and the death of five other citizens of Salem Village, Massachusetts (present day Danvers, Massachusetts) and nearby towns who were accused of practicing witchcraft. The episode is one of America&#x27;s most notorious cases of mass hysteria, and it has been used in political rhetoric and popular literature as a vivid cautionary tale about the dangers of isolationism, religious extremism, false accusations and lapses in due process.
* Würzburg, Germany (1749) – an outbreak of screaming, squirming, and trance in a nunnery led to the execution of a suspected witch.
* Glass harmonica (1761-1820)
* Chinese sorcery scares, a series of similar events that took place in 1768, 1810, 1876, and 1910. 
* Great Fear (1789) – a general panic that took place between 17 July and 3 August 1789, at the start of the French Revolution.

==1800–1950==
* Hammersmith Ghost hysteria (1803) – In November 1803, stories of ghost sightings in the Hammersmith neighbourhood of west London began to circulate. Many people assumed the ghost to be that of a recent suicide victim buried in Hammersmith&#x27;s churchyard, which was in accordance with a popular notion at the time that suicides should not be buried in sacred grounds because their souls would be unable to find rest there. All witnesses reported the ghost as being very tall and clothed entirely in white, with some adding horns and glass eyes to the mix. As more individuals came forward to claim that they had not only seen the Hammersmith ghost, but had also been assaulted by it, alarm rapidly turned to widespread panic, and finally mass hysteria. Fearful residents responded by taking up guns and monitoring the area. This reaction resulted in one member of the public, Francis Smith, shooting and killing bricklayer Thomas Millwood by mistake, thinking he was the ghost.
*Spring-heeled Jack sightings (1837-1904) – The earliest known sightings of Spring-heeled Jack, a legendary figure in English folklore, are claimed to have occurred in London in 1837, and the final confirmed sighting is said to have taken place in Liverpool in 1904. 
* &quot;Writing Tremor Epidemic&quot; (1892, 1904) – The right hand of a 10-year-old girl in Groß Tinz began trembling, which developed into full-body seizures that spread to 19 other students. A similar epidemic affected 20 in Basel, Switzerland. Twelve years later, the Basel school experienced another outbreak that affected 27 students. Legend of the first outbreak was said to have played a role.
* Montreal (1894) – 60 students at a ladies&#x27; seminary had an outbreak of fits and seizures, some for as long as 2 months.
* &quot;Trembling Disease&quot; (1905–06) – An estimated 237 children were impacted between October 1905 and May 1906 in Meissen, Germany.
* (disputed) Miracle of the Sun (13 October, 1917) The Miracle of the Sun, also known as the Miracle of Fátima, was a series of events reported to have occurred miraculously, witnessed by a large crowd who had gathered in Fátima, Portugal, in response to a prophecy made by three children. Newspapers published testimony from witnesses who said that they had seen extraordinary solar activity. Skeptical analysts attribute the claims to the &quot;psychological suggestibility of the witnesses&quot;.
*Halifax Slasher (1938) – The &quot;Halifax Slasher&quot; was the name given to a supposed attacker of residents, mostly women, of the town of Halifax, England, in November 1938. The week-long scare began after two women claimed to have been attacked by a mysterious man with a mallet and &quot;bright buckles&quot; on his shoes. Further reports of attacks by a man wielding a knife or a razor followed. The situation became so serious that Scotland Yard was called in to assist the Halifax police. On November 29 one of the alleged victims admitted that he had inflicted the damage upon himself for attention. Others soon had similar admissions, and the Yard investigation concluded that none of the attacks had been real. Five local people were subsequently charged with public mischief offenses, and four were sent to prison.
* &quot;War of the Worlds&quot; radio broadcast (1938) – Newspaper headlines reported that thousands of Americans were plunged into panic over an Orson Welles radio play, convinced that America was under a deadly Martian attack.
* Bellevue, Louisiana (1939) – A girl developed a leg twitch at the annual homecoming high school dance. Attacks worsened and spread to friends over the next several weeks.
* Mad Gasser of Mattoon (1940s) – Mattoon, Illinois
* Ghost rockets (1946) – German, British and Scandinavian intelligence officials concluded that the Ghost rockets which were reported over Scandinavia are a case of mass hysteria (among other conclusions).
* Tokyo, Japan (1947) - On May 29, 1947, the United States armed forces radio station in Tokyo (WVTR) broadcast a &quot;news bulletin&quot; that a 20-ft sea monster was spotted in Tokyo Bay and travelling inland.
* 1947 flying disc craze

==1950−2000==
* Seattle windshield pitting epidemic (1954)
* Tanganyika laughter epidemic (1962) – began on January 30, 1962, at a mission-run boarding school for girls in Kashasha, Tanzania. The laughter started with three girls and spread haphazardly throughout the school, affecting 95 of the 159 pupils, aged 12–18. Symptoms lasted from a few hours to 16 days in those affected. The teaching staff were not affected but reported that students were unable to concentrate on their lessons. The school was forced to close down on March 18, 1962. After the school was closed and the students were sent home, the epidemic spread to Nshamba, a village that was home to several of the girls. In April and May, 217 people had laughing attacks in the village, most of them school children and young adults. The Kashasha school was reopened on May 21, only to be closed again at the end of June. In June, the laughing epidemic spread to Ramashenye girls&#x27; middle school, near Bukoba, affecting 48 girls. Another outbreak occurred in Kanyangereka and two nearby boys schools were closed.
* June bug epidemic (1962) – A mysterious disease broke out in a dressmaking department of an American textile factory. The symptoms included numbness, nausea, dizziness, and vomiting. Word of a bug in the factory that would bite its victims and cause them to develop the above symptoms quickly spread. Soon 62 employees developed this mysterious illness, some of whom were hospitalized. The news media reported on the case. After research by company physicians and experts from the US Public Health Service Communicable Disease Center, it was concluded that the case was one of mass hysteria. While the researchers believed some workers were bitten by the bug, anxiety was probably the cause of the symptoms. No evidence was ever found for a bug which could cause the above flu-like symptoms, nor did all workers demonstrate bites.
* Welsh, Louisiana (1962) – With students&#x27; sexual activity under close scrutiny by school officials, and following rumors of mandatory pregnancy tests, 21 girls and one boy in grades six to eleven were affected by seizures and other symptoms over six months.
* Blackburn faintings (1965) – In October 1965, several girls at a girls&#x27; school complained of dizziness in Blackburn, England. Some fainted. Within a couple of hours, 85 girls from the school were rushed by ambulance to a nearby hospital after fainting. Symptoms included swooning, moaning, chattering of teeth, hyperpnea, and tetany. A medical analysis of the event about one year later found that outbreaks began among the 14-year-olds, but that the heaviest incidence moved to the youngest age groups. There was no evidence of pollution of food or air. The younger girls proved more susceptible, but disturbance was more severe and lasted longer in the older girls. Using the Eysenck Personality Inventory, those affected had higher scores for extroversion and neuroticism. It was considered that the epidemic was hysterical, that a previous polio epidemic had rendered the population emotionally vulnerable, and that a three-hour parade, producing 20 faints on the day before the first outbreak, had been the specific trigger.
* Mount Pleasant, Mississippi (1976) – School officials suspected drug use after 15 students fell to the ground writhing, but no drugs were found and hysteria is assumed to be the culprit. At one point, one third of the school&#x27;s 900 students stayed home for fear of being &quot;hexed&quot;.
* Malaysia (1970s–1980s) – Mass hysteria in Malaysia affected school-age girls and young women working in factories. The locals have explained this outbreak as &quot;spirits&quot; having possessed the girls and young women.
* Hollinwell incident (1980) – Around 300 people, mostly children, but including adults and babies, suddenly had fainting attacks, nausea and other symptoms. The incident remains one of the prime examples of mass hysteria.
* West Bank fainting epidemic (1983) – a series of incidents in March 1983 wherein 943 Palestinian teenage girls, mostly schoolgirls, and a small number of IDF women soldiers fainted or complained of feeling nauseous in the West Bank. Israel was accused of using chemical warfare to sterilize West Bank women while IDF sources speculated that a toxic substance had been employed by Palestinian militants to stir up unrest, but investigators concluded that even if some environmental irritant had originally been present, the wave of complaints was ultimately a product of mass hysteria. This conclusion was supported by a Palestinian health official, who said that while 20% of the early cases may have been caused by the inhalation of some kind of gas, the remaining 80% were psychosomatic.
* Day-care sex-abuse hysteria – a moral panic that occurred primarily in the 1980s and early 1990s featuring charges against day-care providers of several forms of child abuse, including Satanic ritual abuse.
* San Diego (1988) – The U.S. Navy evacuated 600 men from barracks; 119 were sent to San Diego hospitals with complaints of breathing difficulty. No evidence of toxins, food poisoning, or any other cause was found.
* Kosovo student poisoning (1990) – alleged poisoning of thousands of Kosovan young people by toxic gases, was concluded by professor of medicine Zoran Radovanović to be a product of mass hysteria.
* Ganesha drinking milk miracle (1995)
* Belgium (June 1999) – Coca-Cola withdrew 30 million units of its soft-drink product from sale after more than a hundred people in Belgium and northern France complained of cramps, nausea and other problems after consuming the soft drinks. Testing found no evidence of tainted product and the incident was reported to be a panic, perhaps fueled by the discovery of dioxins in Belgian meat, which had brought down the national government earlier that year.

==2000–present==
* Monkey-man of Delhi (2001) – Rumors about a hairy monkey-looking monster attacking people in Delhi in India led to the deaths of several panicked people who fell from roofs or stairwells while fleeing what they thought was the monster.
* North Carolina (2002) – Ten girls developed seizures and other symptoms at a rural North Carolinian high school. Symptoms persisted for five months across various grade levels. Incidents tended to happen outside of class, with half of all incidents estimated to have occurred around lunch hour. Half of the affected were cheerleaders or former cheerleaders.
* &quot;Strawberries with Sugar virus&quot; (2006) – In May 2006, an outbreak of the so-dubbed &quot;Morangos com Açúcar Virus&quot; (&#x27;Strawberries with Sugar virus&#x27;) was reported in Portuguese schools, named after the popular teen girl&#x27;s show &quot;Morangos com Açúcar&quot; (&quot;&#x27;Strawberries With Sugar&quot;&#x27;). At least 300 students at 14 schools reported similar symptoms to those experienced by the characters in a then recent episode where a life-threatening virus affected the school depicted in the show. Symptoms included rashes, difficulty breathing, and dizziness. The belief that there was a medical outbreak forced some schools to temporarily close. The Portuguese National Institute for Medical Emergency eventually dismissed the illness as mass hysteria.
* Mexico City (2006–2007) – Between October 2006 and June 2007, near Chalco, a working-class suburb of Mexico City, mass hysteria resulted in an outbreak of unusual symptoms experienced by more than 500 adolescent female students at Children&#x27;s Village School (&quot;Villa de las Ninas&quot;), a Catholic boarding-school. The affected students had difficulty walking and were feverish and nauseated, some becoming partially paralyzed.
* Vinton, Virginia (2007) – An outbreak of twitching, headaches and dizziness affected at least nine girls and one teacher at William Byrd High School. The episode lasted for months amid other local public health scares.
*Tanzania (2008) – In September 2008, 20 girls at a school in Tabora started fainting while taking their final year exams. The mass fainting according to one medical officer, has been linked to neurosis related to the local practice of witchcraft.
* Afghanistan (2009) – Starting around 2009, a spate of apparent poisonings at girls&#x27; schools across Afghanistan began to be reported, with symptoms including dizziness, fainting, and vomiting. The United Nations, World Health Organization and NATO&#x27;s International Security Assistance Force carried out investigations of the incidents over multiple years, but never found any evidence of toxins or poisoning in the hundreds of blood, urine, and water samples they tested. The conclusion of the investigators was that the girls had a mass psychogenic illness. Despite these findings, Afghan officials often blame the incidents on the Taliban, accusing them of contaminating the school&#x27;s water supply or using poison gas.
* Brunei (2010) – In April and May 2010, incidents of mass hysteria occurred at two all-girls secondary schools in Brunei. The most recent notable event happened on the 24 April 2014 in a public secondary school. The phenomenon caused a wave of panic among many parents, educators, and members of the community. Some of the students affected by the phenomenon claimed to have been possessed by spirits, or jinn, displaying histrionic symptoms such as screaming, shaking, fainting, and crying.
* Le Roy, New York (2011–12) – After 12 high school girls developed Tourette-like symptoms in 2011, their school was tested for toxins, and all other factors for their symptoms were ruled out. The case, and some of the girls and their parents, gained national media attention. In January 2012, several more students and a 36-year-old adult female came forward with similar symptoms. They were all diagnosed with conversion disorder.
* Sri Lanka (2012) – From November 15–20, 2012, incidents of mass hysteria occurred at 15 schools in Sri Lanka. More than 1,900 school children of 15 schools in Sri Lanka and five teachers were treated for a range of symptoms that included skin rashes, vomiting, vertigo, and cough due to allergic reactions believed to be mass hysteria. It originated at the Jinaraja Balika Vidyalaya in Gampola on November 15, 2012, when 1,100 students were admitted to hospital with a range of symptoms that included skin rashes, vomiting, vertigo and coughing. Later, authorities had to close down the school for 3 days. After that on November 16–19 there were more reports of students from other parts of the country showing similar symptoms.
* Charlie Charlie panic (2015) – Four teens in Tunja, Colombia, were hospitalized, and several in the Dominican Republic were considered &quot;possessed by Satan&quot; after playing the Charlie Charlie Challenge viral game.
* 2016 clown sightings – Sightings of people in evil clown costumes in the United States, Canada, and 18 other countries were dismissed as a case of mass hysteria, stating that a fear of clowns (which is common in children and adults) may be an underlying cause. The website &quot;Vox&quot; likewise claimed that &quot;The Great Clown Panic of 2016 has been perpetuated by pretty much everyone except actual clowns.&quot;
* Recurrent epidemic of mass hysteria in Nepal (2016–2018) – A unique phenomenon of “recurrent epidemic of mass hysteria” was reported from a school of Pyuthan district of western Nepal in 2018. After a 9-year-old school girl developed crying and shouting episodes, quickly other children of the same school were also affected resulting in 47 affected students (37 females, 10 males) in the same day. Since 2016 similar episodes of mass psychogenic illness has been occurring in the same school every year. In 2016, twelve students were affected and in 2017, a total of 18 students of the same school were affected showing various symptoms in a single day. Hence it was thought to be a unique case of recurrent mass hysteria.
* Havana syndrome (2016-2023) Idiopathic symptoms experienced mostly abroad by U.S. government officials and military personnel, ranging in severity from pain and ringing in the ears to cognitive dysfunction, were first reported in 2016 by U.S. and Canadian embassy staff in Havana, Cuba. Beginning in 2017, more people, including U.S. intelligence and military personnel and their families, reported having these symptoms in places around the world including in Washington, D.C. Many U.S. federal government officials and agencies blamed the reported illnesses on attacks by unidentified foreign agents using unknown weaponry. In March 2023, seven U.S. intelligence agencies completed a review of the proposed cases and reported that &quot;available intelligence consistently points against the involvement of US adversaries in causing the reported incidents&quot; and that a foreign adversary&#x27;s involvement was &quot;very unlikely&quot;. 
* Emirates Flight 203 (September 2018) – 106 of 521 passengers on a 14-hour flight from Dubai to New York reported symptoms including coughing, sneezing, fever, or vomiting. The pilot notified airport ground staff, and personnel from the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention met and quarantined the plane in New York and evaluated passengers, 11 of whom were sent to the hospital. A few passengers on the &quot;flight from hell&quot; turned out to have common colds or flu, with the other passengers coming to the belief that they were also sick after observing those around them.
* Ketereh, Malaysia (2019) – In August 2019, the BBC reported that schoolgirls at the Ketereh national secondary school (SMK Ketereh) in Kelantan, started screaming, with some claiming to have seen &#x27;a face of pure evil&#x27;. Professor Simon Wessely a former president of the Royal College of Psychiatrists, suggested it was a form of &#x27;collective behaviour&#x27;. Robert Bartholomew, a medical sociologist, suggested it was due to the stricter implementation of Islamic law in the school. The school responded to the outbreak by cutting down the trees around the school, believing they were home to supernatural spirits.
* Starehe Girls&#x27; Centre, Kenya (October 2019) – 52 students were isolated with an unknown disease, showing symptoms of a high-pitched cough, sneezing and low-grade fever, a number that later rose to 68. As the number rose, the school&#x27;s administration shut the school down and instructed parents to pick up their daughters. Specimens collected from the affected students showed only two cases of rhinovirus, a virus that is the predominant cause of the common cold. After carrying out psychological assessments on the students, a team of mental health specialists dispatched by Kenya&#x27;s Ministry of Health to the school concluded that the &#x27;mysterious&#x27; disease was a case of mass hysteria.
* Iranian schoolgirls mass poisoning reports (2022-2023) A series of alleged chemical attacks during which students in dozens of schools in Iran were reportedly poisoned in various and undetermined manners by unidentified perpetrators. These events started in November 2022 and reports of thousands of students being poisoned in ongoing assaults were claimed to have occurred in the following months. Mass psychogenic illness has been identified as a possible cause of the incidents. 
*School and university shooting threats in Brazil (2023)- after the Blumenau school attack in Blumenau, in the Brazilian state of Santa Catarina and the Thomazia Montoro school shooting in São Paulo, a wave of threats against education centres throughout Brazil occurred, with many schools and universities being closed and students refusing to go to those vicinities or parents not allowing their children to go to school. While some of these threats were real, most of them turned out to be hoaxes motivated by mass hysteria.
*Musoli, Kenya (2023) In October of 2023, over 100 students from the St. Theresa’s Eregi Girls’ High School were hospitalized due to rapid and involuntary arm and leg movement, sometimes accompanied by headaches and vertigo. Routine medical tests revealed nothing unusual, and there were no signs of infectious disease as a cause. Ultimately it was decided that the events were caused by “stress due to upcoming exams” and the incident was determined to be an incident of “hysteria”. Due to the determination of collective stress as the cause, medical sociologist Robert Bartholomew favors the neutral term mass psychogenic illness over mass hysteria. This is because people respond more favorably to a diagnosis of stress induced symptoms than to a diagnosis of mass hysteria. Bartholomew notes such outbreaks are not unusual in schools in the developing world. This is particularly true in schools in which discipline is tight and accompanied with cultural strain between administrators and students. An outbreak can be preceded by months of such tension, which then results in physical symptoms such as seen in Musoli. Far from faking it, “Under such prolonged stress, the nerves and neurons that send messages to the brain become disrupted, resulting in an array of neurological symptoms such as twitching, shaking, convulsions, and trance-like states.” Bartholomew further observes that school-stress borne illness such as occurred here have not been uncommon in Africa since the 1960s. Some appear to be due to Christian missionary schools largely ignoring local traditions and mythologies. Instead, such schools impart their own mythologies and culture. This may create overwhelming anxiety due to the students being taught one thing at home, such as ancestor worship, which is then forbidden at a Christian mythology based school. Other such outbreaks have similar tradition based causes, such as a 1995 outbreak of “bouts of screaming, crying, foaming at the mouth, and partial paralysis” in over 600 girls at an African Muslim school in Northern Nigeria. This outbreak was surmised to be due to expectations of traditional arranged marriage, colliding with modernity’s emphasis on romantic love that the students had observed in movies. The difference between these two cases of mass psychogenic illness reinforces that each outbreak needs to be evaluated in the specific circumstances in which it occurred, as such instances are “never spontaneous reactions to stress per se; they are always couched in some unique context.”

<text>In 19th-century psychiatry, monomania (from Greek , &quot;one&quot;, and , meaning &quot;madness&quot; or &quot;frenzy&quot;) was a form of partial insanity conceived as single psychological obsession in an otherwise sound mind.

==Types==
Monomania may refer to:

* Erotomania (also known as De Clerambault&#x27;s syndrome): Delusion that a particular person is in love with the patient. This can occur without reinforcement or even acquaintanceship with the love object.
* Idée fixe: Domination by an overvalued idea, for example, &quot;staying thin&quot; in anorexia nervosa
* Kleptomania: Irresistible urge to steal
* Pyromania: Impulse to deliberately start fires
* Lypemania: Early elaboration later to become modern concept of depression
* Narcissism: Pursuit of gratification from one&#x27;s own attributes
* Homicidal monomania: According to Étienne-Jean Georget, an abrupt &quot;lesion of the will&quot; capable of driving an otherwise sane person to murder

== History ==
Partial insanity, variations of which enjoyed a long prehistory in jurisprudence, was in contrast to the traditional notion of total insanity, exemplified in the diagnosis of mania, as a global condition affecting all aspects of understanding and which reflected the position that the mind or soul was an indivisible entity. Coined by the French psychiatrist Jean-Étienne Dominique Esquirol (1772–1840) around 1810, monomania was a new disease-concept characterised by the presence of an expansive fixed idea, in which the mind was diseased and deranged in some facets but otherwise normal. Esquirol and his circle described three broad categories of monomania, consistent with their three-part classification of the mind into intellectual, emotional and volitional faculties. Emotional monomania is that in which the patient is obsessed with only one emotion or several related to it; intellectual monomania is that which is related to only one kind of delirious idea or ideas. Although monomania was retained as one of seven recognized categories of mental illness in the 1880 US census, its importance as a psychiatric diagnostic category was in decline from the 1850s on.

<text>Ma is a Sumerian word meaning &quot;land&quot; that in Sumerian mythology was also used to regard Primordial Land. 

There seems to be some loss in records as to the transition, but the same name Ma appears again later, also tied to the Earth, in Ma being referred to as &quot;Mother of the mountain&quot; - in this case, Kur (Mountain) the first dragon god. 

The underworld Kur is the void space between the primeval sea (Abzu) and the earth (Ma).

<text>Celcom Axiata Berhad (doing business as Celcom) was the oldest mobile telecommunications provider in Malaysia. Celcom was a member of the Axiata group of companies. Celcom was merged with Digi to form CelcomDigi on 1 December 2022.

Being one of the very few companies in Malaysia to originally obtain a cellular phone license, it successfully introduced mobile telephony in Malaysia through its ART-900 (Automatic Radio Telephone) service, using first-generation (analogue) ETACS (Extended Total Access Communication System) specifications of the United Kingdom, a derivative of the US-AMPS (Advanced Mobile Phone System) technology. The ETACS ART-900 was started using the prefix &quot;010&quot;.

Celcom now uses the dialling prefix identifier of &quot;013&quot; and &quot;019&quot; and offer digital GSM (Groupe Speciale Mobile), an originally European standard, now largely a world standard for mobile communications. The original frequency band for GSM is 900 MHz and was soon extended to 1800 MHz to cater for much wider bandwidth requirements. The 2100 MHz band is used for their dual-channel HSPA+ network. Celcom is also licensed and has been operating FDD-LTE on 1800 MHz and 2600 MHz.

Through the Mobile Number Portability by the Malaysian Communications and Multimedia, Celcom also provides Virtual Mobile Operator services. The company also provides rural communications services using CDMA Technology and Satellite Phone.

== History ==
Celcom started its operation as Cellular Communications Network (Malaysia) Sdn. Bhd. in 5 January 1988 with Fleet Holdings, which was led by Tun Dr. Abdul Daim Zainuddin (then-parent company of TV3, NSTP, and Bank of Commerce Berhad/BCB) and Telekom Malaysia as shareholders. Subsequently, Telekom Malaysia sold its 51% shareholding to the Technology Resources Industries, a company owned by Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli. Fleet Holding&#x27;s share was transferred to the which was later sold to TRI. In the initial years, Celcom experienced tremendous growth in subscriber base and network coverage under the stewardship of Rosli Man, the President of the company. It was during his tenure that Celcom turned into the leading cellular company in Malaysia. Rosli Man left Celcom in 1996.

When the cellular phone market was opened up in 1995, Celcom upgraded to the GSM900 service and quickly grew to become the largest mobile phone company in Malaysia. Competition soon set in, and several digital mobile carriers competed for market dominance of the cellular phone industry.

During the 1997 Asian financial crisis, Celcom&#x27;s owner, Tan Sri Tajudin Ramli suffered a debt crunch, and his shareholding in Celcom was seized by Danaharta, the national asset restructuring company. Failure to resolve his debts resulted in the controlling stake in Celcom being sold to Telekom Malaysia, the government-owned incumbent fixed-line operator in 2003. Telekom Malaysia proceeded to merge Celcom with its own mobile-operator subsidiary TMTouch through a reverse takeover of TMTouch.

Celcom was originally listed on the Bursa Malaysia, but after the merger with Telekom Malaysia Berhad, it has since remained private.

Owing to the inferior management of its former management, Celcom was found liable by an arbitration panel in Switzerland for infringing an agreement signed with Deutsche Telekom AG&#x27;s unit, DeTeAsia in 2002. The tribunal ruled that Celcom was liable to pay DeTeAsia US$177.2 million in principal plus US$16.2 million in interest as well as other legal and arbitration costs. The total sum was about RM740 million, leaving Telekom Malaysia to intensify its efforts at recovering monies from Celcom&#x27;s previous owners.

On 21 June 2021, Axiata and Telenor agreed to a potential merger of Celcom and Digi to create a stronger telco in Malaysia, coming after advanced discussions that took place two months earlier. The deal was approved by both Celcom and Digi shareholders on 18 November 2022. The merged company is named CelcomDigi. At completion, Axiata and Telenor hold equal ownership of 33.1% each in the newly merged company. The merger was completed on 30 November 2022 and the company began its operation the next day.

== Coverage, Products, and Services ==
Celcom operates 2G EDGE, 4G LTE, 4G LTE-A and 5G NR networks.

Celcom has broader and more extensive coverage nationwide in Malaysia, compared to other cellular operators. In 2006, Celcom claimed its dual-band GSM (900/1800 MHz) coverage had reached over 98% of Malaysia&#x27;s populated area, and 100% through satellite coverage.

In 2006, Celcom launched the first 3G service in Malaysia, covering most major towns where there is a Telekom Malaysia telephone exchange and either HSDPA or EDGE services within radius (GSM UMTS maximum allowed range) with GPRS as basic data coverage.

In 2013, the 4th generation standard of FDD-LTE was deployed gradually nationwide. The initial license is only on the 2,600 MHz band. In the second quarter, its 1,800 MHz band has been redeployed to cater for both 2G and 4G.

In 2015, Celcom offers 2G, 3G, 4G LTE services on its postpaid and Xpax prepaid brands.

In April 2016, the Celcom CEO told &quot;MalaysianWireless&quot; that both Ericsson and Huawei would build the Celcom 4G network in Klang Valley from 2016 till 2020. As for other states, Ericsson would build the 4G network in Sabah &amp; Sarawak, Kelantan, Terengganu, and Pahang. Huawei would focus on Penang, Perlis, Perak, and Johor.

In 2017, Celcom had a 90% nationwide mobile service coverage with 3G availability expanding from Klang Valley, Johor Bahru, Melaka, Kulim, and Penang.

As of March 2018, Celcom improved its network experience considerably, especially with the expansion of its 4G and 4G LTE-A population coverage to 88% and 76%.

Back in 2015, Celcom has 3500 4G LTE sites in the country. The Telco aims to offer up to 80% human population coverage by the end of 2016, and 95% of 4G LTE coverage by 2020. Celcom 4G LTE network coverage stood at 94% nationwide while 4G LTE-A coverage is at 90%, as of quarter 3 of 2021.
===Celcom Broadband ===
Celcom Broadband is Malaysia&#x27;s most popular mobile broadband provider, with 1.534 million subscribers as of the first quarter of 2015. The broadband network covers 86% of Malaysia&#x27;s populated areas.

Celcom Broadband was awarded the prestigious Frost &amp; Sullivan&#x27;s Mobile Broadband Provider for two years.

===Kolony===
Kolony, launched by Celcom on 8 April 2011 was the first-ever SMS-based social networking service in Malaysia. Kolony targeted Malaysian youths and those that wanted to be connected to their family and friends frequently by using their mobile phone. It ran on the regular SMS-based platform, allowing users to participate in social networking activities using the most basic mobile phones with or without a 3G connection. It is a service consisting of a multi-user environment, including software and websites. After only a few weeks of its launch, Kolony recorded a total of 1.5 million subscribers.

=== Magic SIM ===
On 4 June 2015, Celcom launched its latest Xpax limited edition simcard package, the Magic SIM. A RM5 Xpax Magic SIM starter pack comes with free basic internet, free 200 MB of high-speed internet, and 20 free minutes free calls and SMS or SMS to Celcom numbers.

=== Xpax #NoKelentong ===

On 19 December 2016, Celcom revamped its prepaid plan with the more simplified XPAX #NoKelentong. It removes data restrictions on application usage, 4G only weekend data and off-peak only data.

=== Celcom Home Wireless ===
On 15 March 2018, Celcom launched postpaid home wireless broadband.

=== Yoodo ===
On 29 January 2018, Celcom launched Yoodo, a brand marketed as a hybrid of conventional prepaid mobile plans.

== Current developments ==
Celcom is the Malaysian partner of the Vodafone mobile community. Celcom&#x27;s past CEO, Dato’ Seri Mohammed Shazalli Ramly, had been with Celcom since 2005. Ramly left on 31 August 2016 to become the CEO of Telekom Malaysia on 1 May 2017. Michael Kuehner was appointed as the current CEO of Celcom with effective on 1 September 2016.

=== Demerger from Telekom Malaysia ===
On 28 September 2007, Telekom Malaysia announced a revamp of its mobile communication units which include Celcom. The revamp plan was to group Celcom under TM International, which houses other TM regional mobile units and defines it as a separate business entity. The restructuring exercise was completed by Q1 2008 and the new business unit listed on the Kuala Lumpur Stock Exchange by Q2 2008.

TM International was renamed as Axiata Group as part of a telecom consortium in Southeast Asia. Its stock exchange code is AXIATA.

=== Merger Possibility with Telekom Malaysia ===
In January 2018, Celcom Axiata Bhd CEO Michael Kuehner said the proposed merger between Telekom Malaysia and Axiata Group &#x27;made sense&#x27;, but it is still up to the shareholders to make the final decision.

=== Subscribers ===
As of the first quarter of 2018, Celcom has 9.6 million subscribers in Malaysia. Celcom subscribers dropped from 10.25 million in Q12017.

In that quarter, Celcom&#x27;s ARPU for postpaid was RM87, and prepaid ARPU stood at RM34.

=== Axiata and Telenor in Talks to Merge Asian Operations ===
In 2019, The Edge reported that Axiata Group Bhd and Norwegian Telenor Group are in talks to merge their operations in Asia. It is learnt that post-merger, Axiata will be a shareholder of the merged entity, which is expected to be an investment holding company that owns the enlarged regional mobile service operation.

<doc id="247844" wikidata="Q36402" url="?curid=247844" title="Midnight">
<text>Midnight is the transition time from one day to the next – the moment when the date changes, on the local official clock time for any particular jurisdiction. By clock time, midnight is the opposite of noon, differing from it by 12 hours.

Solar midnight is the time opposite to solar noon, when the Sun is closest to the nadir, and the night is equidistant from sunset and sunrise. Due to the advent of time zones, which regularize time across a range of meridians, and daylight saving time, solar midnight rarely coincides with 12 midnight on the clock. Solar midnight depends on longitude and time of the year rather than on time zone. In ancient Roman timekeeping, midnight was halfway between dusk and dawn (i.e., solar midnight), varying according to the seasons.

In some Slavic languages, &quot;midnight&quot; has an additional geographic association with &quot;north&quot; (as &quot;noon&quot; does with &quot;south&quot;). Modern Polish, Belarusian, Ukrainian, and Serbian languages preserve this association with their words for &quot;midnight&quot; or &quot;half-night&quot; (&quot;północ&quot;, &quot;поўнач&quot;, &quot;північ&quot;, &quot;поноћ&quot;) also meaning &quot;north&quot;.

==Start and end of day==
Midnight marks the beginning and ending of each day in civil time throughout the world. As the dividing point between one day and another, &quot;midnight&quot; defies easy classification as either part of the preceding day or of the following day. Though there is no global unanimity on the issue, most often midnight is considered the start of a new day and is associated with the hour 00:00. 

Strictly speaking, it is incorrect to use &quot;a.m.&quot; and &quot;p.m.&quot; when referring to noon or midnight. The abbreviation a.m. stands for &quot;ante meridiem&quot; or &quot;before noon&quot;, and p.m. stands for &quot;post meridiem&quot; or &quot;after noon&quot;. Since noon is neither before nor after noon, and midnight is exactly twelve hours before and after noon, neither abbreviation is correct. However, many digital representations of time are configured to require an &quot;a.m.&quot; or &quot;p.m.&quot; designation, preventing the correct absence of such designators at midnight. In such cases, there is no international standard defining which arbitrary selection is best. 

In the United States and Canada, digital clocks and computers commonly display 12 a.m. at midnight. The 30th edition of the &quot;U.S. Government Style Manual (2008)&quot;, in sections 9.54 and 12.9b, recommended the use of &quot;12 a.m.&quot; for midnight and &quot;12 p.m.&quot; for noon. However, the previous 29th edition of the &quot;U.S. Government Printing Office Style Manual (2000)&quot;, in section 12.9, recommended the opposite. There is no further record documenting this change. The US National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) recommends avoiding confusion altogether by using &quot;11:59 pm&quot; or &quot;12:01 am&quot; and the intended date instead of &quot;midnight&quot; or &quot;12:00 am&quot;.

There are several common approaches to identifying and distinguishing the precise start and end of any given day.
* Use of a 24-hour clock can remove ambiguity. The &quot;midnight&quot; term can be avoided altogether if the end of the day is noted as 24:00 and the beginning of the day as 00:00. While both notations refer to the same moment in time, the choice of notation allows its association with the previous night or with the following morning.
* &quot;Midnight&quot; can be augmented with additional disambiguating information. A day and time of day may be explicitly identified together, for example &quot;midnight Saturday night.&quot; Alternatively, midnight as the division between days may be highlighted by identifying the pair of days so divided: &quot;midnight Saturday/Sunday&quot; or &quot;midnight December 14/15.&quot;
* The approach recommended by the NIST (&quot;11:59 p.m.&quot; or &quot;12:01 a.m.&quot; instead of midnight) can be particularly helpful when any ambiguity can have serious consequences, such as with contracts and other legal instruments.
* A clear convention may be legally defined or culturally promulgated. For example, the Hebrew calendar associates the start of a new day with sundown and midnight being a relative hour falling six hours after sundown. Similarly, in traditional Arabic time at sunset, which marked the start of each new day, clocks were reset to 12:00. As noted above, however, such conventions or definitions may not be uniformly observed.
* The International Organization for Standardization (ISO) in specification ISO 8601 states: &quot;00:00:00&quot; may be used to refer to midnight corresponding to the instant at the beginning of a calendar day; and &quot;24:00:00&quot; to refer to midnight corresponding to the instant at the end of a calendar day.
* The AP Stylebook assigns &quot;midnight&quot; to the day that is ending, not the day beginning.

<text>Keretapi Tanah Melayu Berhad (KTMB) (Jawi: ) or Malayan Railway Limited, colloquially referred to simply as KTM, is the main rail operator in Peninsular Malaysia. The railway system dates back to the British colonial era, when it was first built to transport tin. Previously known as the Federated Malay States Railways (FMSR) the Malayan Railway Administration (MRA), and the Malayan Railway, Keretapi Tanah Melayu acquired its current name in 1962. The organisation was corporatised in 1992, but remains wholly owned by the Malaysian government.

== History ==
In 1948, the FMSR was renamed the Malayan Railway. The railways had been devastated by the Japanese invasion of Malaya, and efforts were taken to rebuild the two main lines, but many branch lines were abandoned in the process.

The MR began to modernize the equipment with the ordering of diesel locomotives and railcars to replace steam-hauled services, and the first diesel locomotive entered service in 1957. The railcars entered service in 1960, initially on short-haul services. Rapid services were introduced later, cutting travel times from Singapore to Kuala Lumpur down to six hours, which was competitive at the time. MR and later KTM continued ordering more diesel locomotives through the decades, rendering the old steam locomotives redundant. The last steam locomotive was withdrawn from service in 1974.

Malayan Railways also operated an air service from 1954 to 1958, known as &quot;Federation Air Service&quot;. The service was transferred to Malayan Airways in March 1958.

The 1970s saw the closure of many branch lines, such as the Batu Arang branch in 1971 and the historic Taiping to Port Weld branch in 1972. The Port Dickson branch was converted to freight-only operation in 1972, although seasonal passenger service did continue for a short while. However, construction did continue for a new line to Subang Airport used to transport fuel, which opened in 1980.

Railbuses were introduced in the 1980s for short-haul commuter services. They were deployed in the Klang Valley, on Kuala Lumpur to Ipoh, Ipoh to Butterworth, Gemas to Mentakab and Kulai to Singapore services. On certain routes such as Kulai to Singapore, the railbuses were faster than conventional trains, and in this instance saved travel time of 15 minutes. They lasted until the introduction of KTM Komuter in 1995, which took over commuter services in the Klang Valley.

KTM was corporatised in 1992, with all assets now under the ownership and management of the Railway Assets Corporation (RAC). The company runs as a private enterprise although owned and subsidized by the Malaysian government. There were attempts by private companies to take over the operations since then, but such proposals were rejected by the Malaysian government.

The 1990s saw the start of another modernization programme. Proposals were made to electrify the West Coast line, which started with the Klang Valley area. Electric trains made their debut on 3 August 1995 with KTM Komuter, with services from Port Klang to Sentul and Rawang to Seremban. Under this programme, existing stations were renovated or rebuilt and new stations were built.

The programme was faced with delays throughout the 2000s, with the government postponing many electrification projects. However, from 2007 onwards there was a renewed effort to electrify the west coast line. The completion of such electrification projects from Padang Besar to Gemas to date has allowed the commencement of electrified intercity services in the form of ETS. As the projects were completed in stages, the KTM Komuter and ETS services were expanded over the years to take advantage of the upgraded lines. The East Coast line, which had not seen upgrades for many years, will see upgrades in the form of rehabilitated track, new DMUs and rebuilt stations by 2021.

==Railway network==

The 1000mm gauge network consists of two main lines and several branch lines.

=== West Coast Line ===

The West Coast Line runs from the Malaysia-Thailand Border, where it connects with the State Railway of Thailand, to Woodlands Train Checkpoint in Singapore, serving the West Coast states of Peninsular Malaysia. The line runs through most of the major stations in Peninsular Malaysia, such as Gemas, KL Sentral, Ipoh, Butterworth and Padang Besar railway station.

===East Coast Line===

The East Coast Line branches off from the West Coast line at Gemas, running to Tumpat in Kelantan, serving two of Peninsular Malaysia&#x27;s East Coast states, namely Pahang and Kelantan. Despite its name, it only meets the coast when it reaches Tumpat railway station. It runs through the interior, often through deep jungle, thus earning the nickname Jungle Railway.

===Branch lines ===
There are several branch lines running from the two main lines. Some are mixed traffic, catering to passenger and freight traffic while others only cater to freight trains.

* Subang Jaya - Terminal Skypark (Passenger - Not In Service )
* Putra - Batu Caves (Passenger)
* Butterworth - Bukit Mertajam (Mixed Traffic)
* Port Klang - Pulau Indah (Freight)
* Butterworth - North Butterworth Container Terminal (Freight)
* Kempas Baru - Tanjung Pelepas (Freight)
* Kempas Baru - Pasir Gudang (Freight)

==Infrastructure==
The total network spans . The total length of the network was , however due to the closure and subsequent removal of the section of tracks between Tanjong Pagar railway station and Woodlands Train Checkpoint, the network is now shorter.

The West Coast line is double tracked and electrified between Padang Besar and Gemas, along with all branch lines used for passenger service along this stretch. As part of the upgrades, all level crossings have been removed and modern signalling installed.

The stations along these line are a combination of heritage stations from the colonial era, such as Ipoh Station and Kuala Lumpur Station, and modern stations that were built when the line was double-tracked, such as Taiping, Butterworth, and Arau stations.

The remainder of the West Coast main line from Gemas Station to Johor Bahru Sentral Station is still in the process of being double-tracked and electrified under the Gemas - Johor Bahru Electrified Double Track Project.

The East Coast line is single-tracked. Having not seen many upgrades over the years, the line is considerably less modern than the upgraded sections of the West Coast line. Level crossings are still prevalent and the traditional token signalling system is still used. The stations along this line are older and smaller. Although the line will remain single-tracked, rehabilitation works are underway to replace the worn track and many stations are also being upgraded.

Most of the lines use concrete sleepers, which replaced wooden sleepers from 1982 for the Kerdau-Jerantut and Sungai Yu-Tumpat lines and became more widespread after upgrading works in recent years.

When the East Coast Line rehabilitation work and West Coast line double tracking is complete, the network will exclusively use concrete sleepers.

== Services ==
As a national railway company, KTMB is involved in the business of providing rail-based transportation. This can be divided into four major services:

===KTM Intercity=== 

KTM Intercity (Malay: KTM Antarabandar) is the brand name for long-haul passenger trains that connect cities and major towns served by the KTMB rail network.

The service is provided using conventional locomotive-hauled coaches and DMUs. Services span the length of the network, except branch-lines. Daily services convey passengers from:
Locomotive-hauled coaches:
* Ekspres Rakyat Timuran from JB Sentral in Johor, to Tumpat in Kelantan (Only 1 train overnight service on each direction),
* Ekspres Selatan JB Sentral in Johor, to Gemas in Negeri Sembilan (3 return trip daily), and
* Shuttle Tebrau JB Sentral in Johor to Woodlands in Singapore, with 18 Singapore-bound trains and 13 Johor Bahru-bound trains.
DMUs:
* Shuttle Timuran from Gemas to Tumpat in Kelantan with:
# Gemas - Kuala Lipis (2 return trips daily)
#Kuala Lipis - Tumpat (1 return trip daily)
# Kuala Lipis - Gua Musang (1 return trip daily)
# Gua Musang - Tumpat (2 return trips daily)
# Dabong - Tumpat (1 return trip daily)

It is possible for customers to rent specialized coaches for event management, conferences and even weddings.

It has also been involved in various types of collaborations, joint-promotions, and cross-promotions with all state-level tourism bodies, travel agencies and travel-related industry players in developing rail packages for group travellers.

===ETS (Electric Train Service)===

KTM ETS, which stands for Electric Train Service, is a rapid intercity train service by KTM utilizing electric train-sets. The service started in 2010 using metre-gauge.

It currently operates on the lines from Gemas, Negeri Sembilan to Padang Besar, Perlis, Kuala Lumpur to Ipoh, Perak, and Kuala Lumpur to Butterworth, Penang.

The trains travel up to on electrified lines.

For example, the travel time between KL Sentral and Ipoh is about 2 hours and 20 minutes, which compared favourably with the previous intercity train travel time of 3 hours and 30 minutes while buses can take up to 3 hours.

Each train set is capable of carrying up to 350 passengers.

===KTM Komuter ===
KTM Komuter is a commuter rail service serving the Klang Valley and Northern part of Malaysia.

The central sector consists of the Batu Caves Line, Seremban/Pulau Sebang Line, Port Klang Line and Tanjung Malim Line. Since 2018, KTM Komuter also operates an airport train service - the linking KL Sentral to the Subang Airport. The fleet presently consists of Class 83 (three cars) and Class 92 (six cars).

The Northern Sector consists of two routes, namely the Butterworth/Bukit Mertajam-Ipoh route as well as the Butterworth-Padang Besar route.

KTM Komuter is a heavily utilised mode of transportation by commuters working in Kuala Lumpur as the service is an alternative for road travel, which is occasionally hampered by congestion. Virtually all KTM Komuter stops offer &quot;Park &amp; Ride&quot; parking lots for those who drive to and from the station or halt.

===KTM Kargo ===
KTM Kargo provides cargo conveyance services, with a network that spans almost the whole of the KTMB rail network. It is accessible from seaports and Inland Container Terminal (ICT) as well as industrial centres.

Cargo services are a major contributor to KTM&#x27;s overall revenue.

Currently, there are 45 cargo train services daily with 23 routes daily, of which about 70% are concentrated in the Northern sector. KTMB runs 37 freight train services daily of which about 80% are concentrated in the Northern sector.

The services include
* Bukit Ketri - Kuang (Cement)
* Padang Rengas - Batu Caves (Cement)
* Padang Rengas - Gelang Patah (Cement)
* Kanthan - Padang Jawa (Cement)
* Tasek - Gelang Patah (Cement)
* Prai - Padang Besar (South Thai Cargo)
* Pelabuhan Klang - Prai (Landfeeder)
* Pelabuhan Klang - Padang Besar (Landfeeder)
* Pelabuhan Klang - Ipoh (Landfeeder)
* Pelabuhan Klang - Pasir Gudang (Landfeeder)
* North Port - West Port (Inter Terminal Transfer)
* West Port - North Port (Inter Terminal Transfer)
* PTP - Pasir Gudang (Inter Terminal Transfer)
* Prai - Thungsong (Landbridge)
* Prai - Surathani (Landbridge)
* Prai - Padang Besa (Thai) - (Landbridge)
* Pelabuhan Klang - Hatyai (Landbridge)
* Sungai Way - Bangkok (Landbridge)
* Prai - Sungai Buloh (Sugar)
* Gurun - Butterworth (Urea)

Main commodities carried by rail comprise the following:
# Maritime containers
# Landbridge cargos
# Cement
# Sugar
# Gypsum
# Chemicals

Generally, cargo is moved either in open or covered wagons. In the future, all covered wagons will be replaced with containers to allow for flexibility i.e. goods can be dismounted from the train and delivered directly to customers&#x27; premises.

==Non-rail subsidiaries==
KTM operates several non-rail subsidiaries. Though considered as non-core businesses, KTMB has benefited from these two operations, which are:

*Multimodal Freight (MMF)
Multimodal Freight Sdn. Bhd., incorporated in 1988, was licensed as a Government approved Container Haulier in 1991, and went on to obtain the Government approved Multimodal Transport Operator (MTO) status in 1999. The company operates a fleet of 225 Prime Movers and 1,300 trailers of both 20-foot and 40-foot configurations. The fleet is deployed at all major seaports and the inland ports of Ipoh and Nilai.

* KTM Distribution (KTMD)

Its core business was in the provision of express parcel distribution services to the commercial, industrial and administrative sectors and operated within Malaysia and Singapore. Parcel distribution previously carried out via parcel train cars attached to intercity services where items like parcel and motorbikes could be carried, but this practice has since moved to trucks after rail modernisation and the closure of Tanjong Pagar Railway station in Singapore. Previously, KTMD was also licensed by the Malaysian Communications &amp; Multimedia Commission as a courier service provider, which enabled it to carry letters and documents up to . On 1 November 2022, KTM Distribution announced it would be ending its service after 38 years of operations.

==Modernisation==
Since the corporatisation of KTMB, a programme of modernization has been underway. In 1989, it embarked on the double-tracking and electrification of the trunk line between Rawang and Seremban, the branch lines between Batu Junction and Sentul and between Kuala Lumpur and Port Klang, allowing KTM Komuter services to start running in 1995. Successive double tracking projects has allowed for expansion of electric traction to intercity services in the form of ETS. The entire West Coast line is scheduled to be fully electrified by 2025.

<doc id="247849" wikidata="Q433466" url="?curid=247849" title="Cylon of Athens">
<text>Cylon (also Kylon; ) was an Athenian of the archaic period in Ancient Greece, primarily known for the events of the Cylonian Affair, an attempted seizure of power in the city. Cylon, one of the Athenian nobles and a previous victor of the Olympic Games in 640 BC, attempted a coup in either 636 BC or 632 BC with support from Megara, where his father-in-law, Theagenes, was tyrant.

== History in literature ==

Scholarship has attempted to definitively date the events of Cylon&#x27;s coup, but the only primary records of him come from Herodotus and Thucydides, both of whom only mention that he was a previous winner of the Olympic Games. According to Thucydides (1.126), the oracle at Delphi had advised Cylon to seize Athens during a festival of Zeus, which he understood to mean the Olympics, and become the tyrant of the city himself. Herodotus (5.71) mentions nothing about a festival of Zeus, and Thucydides (1.126) continues with the discussion of the festival called Diasia, leaving some scholars to question whether the attempted seize of Athens actually occurred during the Olympic Games. However, the coup was opposed by the masses, and Cylon and his supporters took refuge in Athena&#x27;s temple on the Acropolis. According to Thucydides, while many of them suffered from famine and dehydration during their time of refuge, Cylon and his brother escaped, but his followers were cornered by Athens&#x27; nine archons. According to Plutarch and Thucydides, they were persuaded by the archons to leave the temple and stand trial after being assured that they were subject to any punishment except death. In an effort to ensure their safety, the accused tied a rope to the temple&#x27;s statue of Athena and went to the trial. On the way, the rope (again, according to Plutarch) broke of its own accord. The Athenian archons, led by Megacles, took this as the goddess&#x27;s repudiation of her suppliants and proceeded to stone them to death (on the other hand, Herodotus, (5.71), and Thucydides, (1.126), do not mention this aspect of the story, stating that Cylon&#x27;s followers were simply killed after being convinced that they would not be harmed). Most likely, the story found in Plutarch is a later invention. In Herodotus&#x27; (5.71) version of the story, Cylon and his brother never escape and are subject to death along with their followers.

== Political implications ==
Athenian government in the archaic period of ancient Greece was almost entirely made up of elites who had long standing power and had little to no written laws to emphasize limitations of power or ideology. The nine archons were those of elite bloodline in the Archaic Period of Athens and held power for centuries prior to Cylon&#x27;s attempted coup. However, in some contemporary cities throughout Greece, including Megara, governmental structure began to transfer to the rule of tyrants who took advantage of political instability and place themselves into power. In the context of antiquity, tyranny was associated with an unconstitutional takeover of power by an elite or person of high status that was not associated with the direct line of succession Cylon, with his elevated social status from winning the Olympics and knowledge of tyrannical governance from his father in law at Megara, conceived the idea to replicate a tyrannical overthrow in the familiar city of Athens. Even though Cylon&#x27;s efforts failed, the state of governance in Athens in the following century after his attempted overthrow was filled with political change. Just two decades later in 621 BC, Draco devised the first version of written law in Athens which included provisions about homicide. Later in the 550s BC Athenian governance saw its first version of tyranny with the rise of Pisistratus to power who reigned until his death in 527 BC, and was then succeeded by his son Hippias who held power until 510 BC. The era of tyranny in Athens ended with Hippias&#x27; loss of power and two years later, Cleisthenes developed the state of Athenian democracy.  

== Cylonian curse ==
Megacles and his &quot;genos&quot;, the Alcmaeonidae, were exiled from the city for violating the laws against killing suppliants. According to Herodotus (5.71), The Alcmaeonidae were cursed with a &quot;miasma&quot; (&quot;stain&quot; or &quot;pollution&quot;) for committing deeds against the goddess Athena, which was inherited by later generations, even after the &quot;genos&quot; retook control of Athens. Thucydides cited that the nine archons and their descendants who were responsible for killing Cylon&#x27;s supporters were cursed but does not name the Alcmaeonidae. Athens was purified from it by Epimenides of Phaistos. This Cretan seer was known as a close associate of Solon and a hermit who lived in a cave of Zeus. What would later be referred to as the Cylonian curse (Κυλώνειον ἄγος) was used by the Spartans as a political tool to expel the families who opposed their ally Isagoras. These families, led by Cleisthenes, were descended from the families accursed for slaying the followers of Cylon.

Historian Tim Rood has attempted to explain the differences between Thucydides&#x27; and Herodotus&#x27; versions of the stories a chapter called &quot;The Cylon Conspiracy: Thucydides and the Uses of the Past&quot;. He suggested that many modern scholars are not opposed to the idea that Thucydides was commenting on the event to correct Herodotus&#x27; version. Scholars who subscribe to this view have argued that Thucydides&#x27; writings were targeted in defense of the Alcmeonid family who were charged with the sacrilegious murders of Cylon&#x27;s supporters. This notion is sometimes held because of Thucydides&#x27; failure to explicitly name the Alcmeonid family as harbingers of the Cylonian curse, instead only mentioning the nine archons and the &quot;family&quot; in charge of Athens at the time of the coup. Rood suggests that these differences expose the idea that the curse was used selectively in subsequent histories against the Alcmaeonids and their descendants specifically, rather than the archons as a whole, which is evident in Thucydides&#x27; details of Sparta using the curse as a political tool to keep Athens at bay.

== Archeological discoveries ==
In April 2016, two mass graves containing 80 bodies were found in Palaio Faliro, a suburb about four miles from Athens. 36 of the skeletons were bound in iron shackles and archeological evidence from artifacts around the graves dates them from the third quarter of the seventh century BC. It has been suggested by bioarcheologist Kristina Killgrove that they were the supporters of Cylon who were killed in the aftermath of his attempted coup, however the results are not definitive.

<doc id="247859" wikidata="Q39285" url="?curid=247859" title="Staffordshire Bull Terrier">
<text>The Staffordshire Bull Terrier, also called the Staffy or Stafford, is a purebred dog of small to medium size in the terrier group that originated in the northern parts of Birmingham and in the Black Country of Staffordshire, for which it is named. They descended from 19th-century bull terriers that were developed by crossing bulldogs with various terriers to create a generic type of dog generally known as bull and terriers. Staffords share the same ancestry with the modern Bull Terrier, although the two breeds developed along independent lines, and do not resemble each other. Modern Staffords more closely resemble the old type of bull terrier, and were first recognised as a purebred dog breed by The Kennel Club of Great Britain in 1935.

Within the broad sweep of dog history, the story behind the modern Stafford is rather brief and somewhat confusing because of the multiple aliases attached to these dogs in centuries past, such as the &quot;Patched Fighting Terrier&quot;, &quot;Staffordshire Pit-dog&quot;, &quot;Brindle Bull&quot;, and &quot;Bull-and-Terrier&quot;. Similar crosses also had aliases such as half-and-halves and half-breds. Blood sports such as bull-baiting and bear-baiting were outlawed with the passing of the Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 by Parliament, making it illegal to bait animals but promoting the matching of dogs against each other. Dog breeders migrated away from the heavier bulldogs, and introduced terrier blood into their crosses for gameness and agility. These bull and terrier crosses produced the ancestral breeding stock that, over the course of decades, evolved into the modern conformation show dogs we know today as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and the Bull Terrier. It was shortly before the American Civil War that immigrants from Great Britain brought their bull and terrier crossbreeds into the U.S. They became the ancestral progenitors of the American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff), Miniature Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier, and American Pit Bull Terrier.

==History==

The unregulated breeding history and inconsistent genetic makeup of the Stafford&#x27;s early ancestry have led to misconceptions about its origins. Individual types and styles of crossbred dogs varied by geographic region. For example, the progeny from one area may have a higher percentage of terrier than bulldog, whereas other reports claim that bulldog to terrier was preferred over bull and terrier to bull terrier. Dog breeders made careful selections to reinforce inheritable traits from specific dog types. Many of the mixed breed types, or mongrels that were used to create the early fighting dogs have long since evolved and stabilised into the modern purebred dogs we know today. Many of the desirable phylogenetic traits of the breed&#x27;s ancestry have been preserved and further refined by selective breeding to better suit the Stafford&#x27;s modern purpose as a conformation show dog, while the unwanted traits have been bred out.

===Two Bull Terriers===

In the mid–19th century, bull and terrier hybrids were known by several different aliases, such as the Patched Fighting Terrier, Staffordshire Pit-dog, Brindle Bull, and Bull-and-Terrier. They were also referred to as half-and-halfs, half-breds, or more commonly as the bull and terrier, although they were not true breeds in the same sense that modern dog breeds are known. However, at least six modern breeds can trace their ancestry to the bull and terrier crosses. Another common name used for bull and terrier was simply Bull Terrier, which became the name for the new breed that James Hinks developed. Hinks used various undocumented outcrosses, including Dalmatians and Collies, that devotees of the original strain considered undesirable. They chose instead to remain loyal to their preferred type. As a result, two different breeds of Bull Terriers emerged: the Bull Terrier, nicknamed the White Cavalier, and the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, named for the county where it was developed. The Bull Terrier&#x27;s fighting heritage was left behind whereas breeders of Staffordshire Bull Terriers in the UK continued their illegal competitions which paralleled what was happening in the U.S. with the American Staffordshire Terrier; neither breed could gain official acceptance in their respective native lands. Journalist and dog expert Denise Flaim stated succinctly: &quot;No established registry wanted to be affiliated with a dog that drew the blood of its own kind for a living.&quot;

===Recognition as a purebred===
Traceable pedigrees did not exist prior to the founding of The Kennel Club (KC) in 1873, which was initially formed by a group of dog show fanciers who wanted to preserve the reputation of dog shows, while at the same time, avoid breeder fraud by establishing a dog&#x27;s identity and documenting its pedigree. The first volume of &quot;The Kennel Club Stud Book&quot; was published in 1874, and included a list of dog shows and names of dogs that were exhibited at each show, beginning with the first dog show in 1859. Bull Terriers, and Bulldogs were also recognised and included in the first volume. However, it was not until 1935 that the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was officially recognised by the KC. It was much later, in 1974, that the American Kennel Club (AKC) accepted the Staffordshire Bull Terrier into its breed registry as its 121st official breed.

===Shared ancestry===

Of the six distinct breeds that descended from the bull and terrier breeds, five are recognised by the AKC in the following order: Bull Terrier, Boston Terrier, American Staffordshire Terrier (AmStaff), Staffordshire Bull Terrier, and Miniature Bull Terrier. The same five breeds are also recognised by the Canadian Kennel Club (CKC). The KC recognises only four of the breeds and does not accept the AmStaff or American Pit Bull Terrier (APBT). The APBT is recognised by the United Kennel Club (UKC).

The KC, which was the first breed registry to accept the newly developed Staffordshire Bull Terrier into its &quot;Stud Book&quot;, stated that the breed &quot;shares the same ancestry as the Bull Terrier, i.e. Bulldog crossed with the Black and Tan terrier, and was developed as a fighting dog.&quot; They further acknowledged that because of the dog&#x27;s &quot;early association with fighting it was, for some time, difficult to get recognition for the breed and it was not until the 1930s that The Kennel Club recognised the breed.&quot; The Canadian Kennel Club (CKC) did not recognise the Stafford until 1952, and afforded more credence to the breed&#x27;s bull and terrier heritage: &quot;The Bull and Terrier might have disappeared if not for a group of fanciers led by Joseph Dunn, who appreciated the dogs for their own sakes and persuaded The Kennel Club (England) to recognise the breed as the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the name of the English county where the breed was most popular.&quot;

===Other theories of origin===

When comparing the centuries-old bull and terrier to the modern Stafford, Joanna de Klerk, DVM, author of &quot;The Complete Guide to Staffordshire Bull Terriers&quot; (2019), said that &quot;being so similar to the original Old English Bulldog, which has since been bred beyond recognition, some argue the Staffie originates solely from that breed rather than having any Terrier in the mix.&quot; Part of the confusion and misconceptions about the breed is due to the breed&#x27;s inconsistent genetic makeup as a result of unregulated breeding practices beginning with the Staffie&#x27;s origins and continuing much later into its development, well before traceable pedigrees existed. It is generally accepted that the Stafford descended from the 19th-century bulldog–terrier crosses that were later bred for dog fighting after blood sports were declared illegal. But it wasn&#x27;t until the early 20th century, well after selective breeding refined the bull and terrier crosses into what became the English Bull Terrier, that the Stafford eventually emerged, a breed standard was created, and in 1935, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier was officially recognised by the KC.

In the spring 2013 issue of The Stafford Knot, Jason Nicolai describes some important evolutionary factors in the breed standards of the Staffordshire Bull Terrier that are &quot;very often misquoted and misunderstood.&quot; The standard for the modern Stafford aligns with the breed&#x27;s transformation from its bull and terrier ancestry as a fighting dog to a modern conformation show dog. Some book authors have compared nineteenth-century drawings or paintings to the visual appearances of modern Staffords. Author and Stafford enthusiast, James Beaufoy, wrote in his book &quot;Staffordshire Bull Terriers: a practical guide for owners and breeders&quot; (2016) that there is &quot;interesting evidence&quot; in some of the early 19th-century paintings that depict conformation and coat colour similarities of the modern Stafford when compared to the Old English Bulldog. One such painting is by artist Abraham Cooper (1817), titled &quot;Crib and Rosa&quot;.

A.W.A Cairns was the editor of the online &quot;Stafford Magazine&quot;. Cairns believed a &quot;Stafford-like animal existed at the turn of the 19th Century&quot; and admitted, with the &quot;possibility for slight prejudice&quot;, that &quot;the only modern dog of this type is the Staffordshire Bull Terrier&quot;. However, Cairns does clarify that the pedigree inscribed on the plaque of the Crib and Rosa painting, specifically the words &quot;the famous Staffordshire bitch&quot;, is not suggesting that it was a Staffordshire Bull Terrier, but that &quot;it could be concluded that animals of that type, existed in that county before 1816.&quot; The writings of both Cairns and Beaufoy align in that the &quot;Staffordshire Bull Terrier is a relatively &#x27;new breed in the context of when it was first recognised by the KC.

In October 1987, Cairns wrote in the &quot;Kennel Gazette&quot; that &quot;Kennel Club recognition of the breed is shrouded in mystery. Recognition was announced in the April 1935 &quot;Kennel Gazette&quot; in the name of Staffordshire Bull Terrier. There was no explanation as to how this came about. No Breed Club or Breed Standard existed.&quot; Cairns also drew attention to the similarities in the Bull Terrier and Stafford in the late 19th century, prior to the downface feature of the modern Bull Terrier: &quot;At that time &#x27;Bull Terriers&#x27; could be registered &#x27;Sire, Dam and date of birth unknown&#x27;, so in effect any dog could be registered as a &#x27;Bull Terrier&#x27;. In consequence, many of the dogs registered were found to be, what became known as Staffordshire Bull Terriers.&quot;

===DNA analysis===
In 2017, a genome-wide study suggested that all of the bull and terrier–type dogs, including the Staffordshire Bull Terrier and five other distinct breeds, map back to the terriers of Ireland and to origins which date to the period 1860–1870. The timing corresponds with historical descriptions of dog fighting competitions in Ireland, a lack of accurate stud book documentation, and, as a result, undocumented dog crosses at the time when these breeds were first created.

DNA studies have brought some clarity to the hybridisation mystery of bull and terrier crossbreeding, suggestive of a New World dog within some modern breeds, but they do not positively identify all the breeds that were involved. As supported by the DNA study, as well as the AKC and KC, references to the historic bull and terrier were not as a bona fide breed; rather, the term was used to describe a heterogeneous group of dogs that may include purebreds of different breeds, or crosses of those breeds. Bull and terrier hybrids, or pit bull types are considered the forerunner of several modern standardised breeds.

===Early protection===
The Cruelty to Animals Act 1835 made blood sports illegal, and effectively stopped bull- and bear-baiting in the UK. Baiting required large arenas which made it easier for authorities to police, whereas illegal dog fighting was much harder to terminate because fight sponsors kept their venues hidden and closely guarded in private basements and similar locations. As a result, dog fighting continued long after bull- and bear-baiting had ceased. It was not until the passage of the Protection of Animals Act 1911 that organised dog fighting in Britain largely came to an end.

===The Kennel Club===
&quot;The early proto-staffords provided the ancestral foundation stock for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier, the American Pit Bull Terrier and the American Staffordshire Terrier.&quot; In 1930, the name &quot;Staffordshire Bull Terrier&quot; first appeared in advertisements for dogs of the type. Throughout 1932 and 1933, attempts to achieve Kennel Club recognition for the breed were made by dog-show judge and breeder, Joseph Dunn, but the Stafford&#x27;s early origins as a fighting dog made it difficult to gain acceptance. In early 1935, Dunn obtained permission from the KC to hold a variety dog show to see if it would attract Stafford owners to show their dogs; he offered cash as a special attraction. The show was held in April 1935 and was a success.

In May 1935, the KC approved the name &quot;Staffordshire Bull Terrier&quot;; the first name requested, &quot;Original Bull Terrier&quot;, had been rejected. Dunn decided to form a club and invited other dog breeders to participate. In June 1935, the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club was formed during a meeting at the Old Cross Guns pub in Cradley Heath; a breed standard was approved the same day, and further shows were held that year. Other pivotal breeders involved in acquiring breed recognition were Joe Mallen and actor Tom Walls. The first champions recognised in England were the bitch Lady Eve and the stud Gentleman Jim in 1939.

Phil Drabble reported that among the various types of bull and terrier, the type from Cradley Heath was recognised as a separate breed to be named the Staffordshire Bull Terrier. It was subsequently accepted by The Kennel Club (KC) in July 1935, marking an official milestone for the Staffordshire Bull Terrier&#x27;s acceptance into the KC&#x27;s breed registry.
===FCI===
In 1954, the breed was recognised by the Fédération Cynologique Internationale located in Thuin, Belgium.

===American Kennel Club===
The Staffordshire Bull Terrier, as well as the Bull Terrier and American Staffordshire Terrier, are three distinct modern purebred dogs in the AKC Terrier group, all with a similar ancestry. Historically, the Staffordshire Terriers had arrived in America by the mid-1800s. After their arrival, two distinct breeds were developed, one of which some American breeders developed into a taller, heavier offshoot of the English version which became the American Staffordshire Terrier.

Initially, the AKC refused to recognise any breeds that were associated with dog fighting. The early Bull Terrier breed developed by James Hinks as a conformation show dog was recognised by the AKC in 1885. It was nearly 50 years later in 1936 that AKC recognised the Staffordshire Terrier, later changing the breed&#x27;s name to the American Staffordshire Terrier to avoid confusion with the English version. In an effort to achieve AKC recognition of the English Stafford, Steve Stone organised the US Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, 14 January 1967. There were few Staffords in the country at that time, most being imports from Australia, Canada, New Zealand, and other parts of the world.

The first attempts to encourage club membership and gain AKC recognition began with a rally held in the summer of 1967 which resulted in 14 memberships and 8 Staffords registered by the club. By year&#x27;s end, the count had increased to 39 registered dogs. Dog imports continued, and the number of memberships and registered dogs increased but it would take nearly a decade of hosting sanctioned shows and demonstrating consistency in the breed standard by maintaining responsible breeding practices that the club would acquire official AKC recognition.

In 1974, AKC officially recognised the Staffordshire Bull Terrier Club, giving it recognition as the official AKC Parent Club representing the breed. The first Stafford to be registered and entered into the AKC Stud Book was Ch. Tinkinswood Imperial, an English import. An Australian import, Northwark Becky Sharpe, was the first U.S. champion.

==Characteristics==
===Appearance===

The Stafford is short-haired, and of roughly equal length from the withers to the tail and from the withers to the ground. The coat is short, stiff and close. It may be white; black, blue, fawn or red, all with or without white; or any variety of brindle, with or without white. It has a broad head; the ears fold at the tip. It is muscular and well-boned, with strong shoulders, a wide chest and wide-set legs. It is agile and quite active. It is a terrier, and is so classified by the Kennel Club and the Fédération Cynologique Internationale. The dog usually stands at the withers. Dogs weigh about ; bitches approximately less.

===Temperament===
The Stafford has a reputation for pugnacity; when challenged by another dog it is known to not back away. They have a mixed reputation in the UK, with some people associating the breed with chavs.

==Health==
A 2022 UK study of veterinary records found the breed to have a life expectancy of 11.33 years, slightly below the life expectancy of crossbreeds: 11.82 but just above the overall average of 11.23 years. A 2024 UK study found a life expectancy of 12 years for the breed compared to an average of 12.7 for purebreeds and 12 for crossbreeds.

A UK study found a predisposition to juvenile onset demodicosis in the Staffordshire Bull Terrier: In dogs under the age of two years 2.14% of Staffords had demodicosis compared to 0.48% overall. An American study found the same predisposition with 10% of Staffords having the condition compared to 0.58% overall.

Neurological disorders identified in the breed include cerebellar abiotrophy, Chiari-like malformation, myotonia congenita and L-2-hydroxyglutaric aciduria. The Staffordshire Bull Terrier is one of the most commonly affected breeds for hereditary cataracts.

==Popularity and use==
The Stafford is considered a family pet and companion dog, and is among the breeds recommended by the KC for families. Relative to the breed&#x27;s ancestral progenitors, the AKC states: &quot;From his brawling past, the muscular but agile Staffordshire Bull Terrier retains the traits of courage and tenacity. Happily, good breeding transformed this former gladiator into a mild, playful companion with a special feel for kids.&quot;

In the decade 2011–2020, annual registrations with the KC fell from about 7000 to about 5000; in 2019 and 2020 it had the highest number of registrations in the Terrier group. It is among the most frequently registered breeds in Australia, France, and New Zealand. In the United States, it was in 81st place on an AKC list of registrations by number in 2020.

==Pit bull comparisons==
Modern Staffords are often confused with the fighting pit bull-types because they share common ancestors that date back to the early 1800s when pit fighting was a popular sport. As a result, Staffords are considered among the breeds with a stigma attached relative to the &quot;chav culture&quot;, and have been termed &quot;status dogs&quot;. Globally, pit bull-types including Staffordshire Bull Terriers have made local news for acts of aggression, but breed advocates have raised questions about the veracity of visual breed identification, and media hype. News reports often treat the breed as one that attacks other dogs. Similar breeds have been associated with bites to humans.

Early DNA research found some genetic links between breed and behaviour. A 2022 study from the National Human Genome Research Institute described in detail how non-coding variations in the dog genome are associated with behavioural traits of various breeds. They found heritable patterns in terriers &quot;consistent with working roles involving catching and killing prey&quot;. Another 2022 study, from the Broad Institute, concluded that most behavioural traits are heritable whereas behaviour &quot;only subtly differentiates breeds&quot;. That study found that dog breeds that have been stereotyped as being aggressive, such as pit bull types, were not more aggressive than other dogs. The results of that paper indicate that dog behaviour is primarily &quot;shaped by their environment, not their breed&quot;.
==Breed-specific legislation==
In 2018, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA) lobbied the British Parliament to have the breed added to the list of restricted dog breeds in the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, the KC, Dogs Trust, Blue Cross, and the Battersea Dogs &amp; Cats Home all objected to the proposal. The proposal was rejected by Parliament; therefore, Staffords are not banned under the UK&#x27;s Dangerous Dogs Act 1991.

In the United States, dogs that are often defined as pit bulls and commonly banned in some counties include American Pit Bull Terriers, Staffords, American Staffordshire Terriers, and Bull Terriers. The CDC and ASPCA are among several agencies and organisations that have stood in opposition to the &quot;theory underlying breed-specific laws—that some breeds bite more often and cause more damage than others, ergo laws targeting these breeds will decrease bite incidence and severity&quot; as they do not believe it has been successful in practice. As of June 2017, there were 21 states in the US that prohibited breed-specific legislation.

===Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier misnomer===
In the UK, American Pit Bull Terriers are sometimes advertised as &quot;Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier&quot; in an attempt to circumvent the Dangerous Dogs Act 1991. The Irish Staffordshire Bull Terrier is not recognised as a breed by the Irish Kennel Club or any other kennel club.

==Notable dogs==
* Watchman – since 1882, the military mascot of the Staffordshire Regiment.
* Jock – a Stafford cross, subject of Sir Percy FitzPatrick&#x27;s book &quot;Jock of the Bushveld&quot; (1907).
* Cooper – adopted in 2018 by the Staffordshire Police, the first of the breed in that police force. He worked as police dog until 2022, visited schools and appeared on &quot;Crimewatch Live&quot;.

<text>The forktails are small insectivorous birds in the genus Enicurus. They were formerly placed in the thrush family, Turdidae, but are now treated as part of the Old World flycatcher family, Muscicapidae. Their common name derives from their long forked tail.

These are southeast Asian forest species principally associated with mountain forests and streams. Most nest in rock crevices, laying 2–4 eggs.

==Taxonomy==
The genus &quot;Enicurus&quot; was introduced in 1822 by the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck to accommodate &quot;Enicurus coronatus&quot;, the white-crowned forktail, which is therefore the type species. Temminck&#x27;s epithet is considered to be a junior synonym as four years earlier in 1818 Louis Vieillot had coined the binomial name &quot;Turdus leschenaulti&quot; for the same species. The genus name combines the Ancient Greek &quot;henikos&quot; meaning &quot;singular&quot; with &quot;-ouros&quot; meaning &quot;-tailed&quot;.

The following cladogram showing the relationships between the species is based on a molecular phylogenetic study of the Old World flycatchers published in 2023. The Bornean forktail (&quot;Enicurus borneensis&quot;) was not included.

==Species==
The genus contains the following eight species:
* Little forktail, &quot;Enicurus scouleri&quot;
* Black-backed forktail, &quot;Enicurus immaculatus&quot;
* Slaty-backed forktail, &quot;Enicurus schistaceus&quot;
* Spotted forktail, &quot;Enicurus maculatus&quot;
* White-crowned forktail, &quot;Enicurus leschenaulti&quot;
* Bornean forktail, &quot;Enicurus borneensis&quot;
* Chestnut-naped forktail, &quot;Enicurus ruficapillus&quot;
* Sunda forktail, &quot;Enicurus velatus&quot;

<text>The American Record Company was an American record label that was in business from 1904 to 1906.

==History==
The American Record Company (commonly abbreviated as &quot;ARCo&quot;) was founded by Ellsworth A. Hawthorne and Horace Sheble, formerly designers of accessories for Edison Records machines at their Philadelphia-based bicycle shop; in a previous venture, they had issued a small run of brown-wax cylinders in the mid-1890s. Hawthorne and Sheble partnered with John O. Prescott, whose brother Frederick worked with International Talking Machine in Berlin, which marketed Odeon Records. The new company was based in Springfield, Massachusetts, though they maintained factories in Bridgeport, CT and Philadelphia; recordings were made in a studio in New York City. American principally produced single-sided, lateral-cut disc records on blue shellac, although two-sided issues and standard, black shellac appeared towards the end of the company&#x27;s run.

==Logo==
The label of the discs featured artwork depicting a Native American with a smoking pipe listening to a front-mount disc phonograph of undetermined manufacture; American Record Company advertising commonly marketed them as &quot;Indian Records&quot;. Several variations of the &quot;Indian&quot; label exist, differing only in minor details. Most ARCo records are single sided; with their double-sided records, apparently the combination of sides were randomly chosen. The company would press any two sides paired, if the buyer met the minimum-order qualification. These records are notable for being blue in color, rather than the usual black, pressed from a shellac compound called &quot;Empedite&quot; which reputedly delivered better sound quality than standard black shellac. The records appear to have been numbered using a sequence which began at 030000; the highest number known is 031435. The records exist in 7-inch, 10-inch and 10.75-inch sizes, with the latter size being derived from its connection with Odeon, which also used that size. The seven-inch discs used a different numbering sequence and seem to have only been produced for a short time. Some export pressings for Britain carried the &quot;American Odeon Record&quot; logo.

==Legacy==
Unlike most American producers of discs apart from Victor and Columbia in the first decade of the twentieth century, American Record Company made their own recordings in direct contravention to existing patents. The most important contribution made by ARCo to the history of recorded sound is that they made the earliest surviving records of Hawaiian music in several discs credited to the &quot;Royal Hawaiian Troubadours&quot;; this was a group led by July Paka. The house band was called the &quot;Regimental Band of the Republic&quot; and was responsible for most of the remaining instrumental selections on the label, in addition to providing accompaniments to singers. Other performers were mainly drawn from the ranks of singers that worked for Victor, Columbia and the cylinder companies, recording many of the same songs that they did elsewhere. Many ARCos are anonymous, though just as many if not more do carry an accurate credit as to the performer. Collectors of early records do value ARCOs; while not as common as early Columbias or Victors, they survive in decent numbers, especially when compared to discs on labels that they provided masters to, such as Busy Bee, Kalamazoo and Peerless. In Europe, their releases appeared on Pelican, Leader, American Odeon and Odeon.

Ernakulam has a high Human Development Index of 0.801 (UNHDP report 2005), which is one of the highest in India.

==Etymology==
==History==
Ernakulam has played a part in the political history of south India since ancient times. The Jews, Syrians, Arabs, Chinese, Dutch, British, and Portuguese seafarers followed the sea route to the Kingdom of Cochin and left their impressions on the town. The port at Kozhikode held superior economic and political position in medieval Kerala coast, while Kannur, Kollam, and Kochi, were commercially important secondary ports, where the traders from various parts of the world would gather. In 1664, the municipality of Fort Kochi was established by Dutch Malabar, making it the first municipality in Indian subcontinent, which got dissolved when the Dutch authority got weaker in 18th century. In 1896, the Maharaja of Cochin initiated local administration by forming a town council in Ernakulam. Initially, The district&#x27;s headquarters were located in the portion of the city known as Ernakulam, which gave the district its name; the headquarters was relocated afterwards to Kakkanad.

The Anamalais occupy a large part of the district, consisting of the forest areas around Pooyamkutty and the Idamalayar Dam. The range also extends into Thrissur, Palakkad, and Idukki districts, as well as Coimbatore and Tiruppur districts of Tamil Nadu. The district is divided geographically into highland, midland, and coastal area. The altitude of the highlands is about .

The average yearly rainfall in the district is . The district has a moderate climate and mostly falls within the Malabar Coast moist forests ecoregion, while the highlands are part of the South Western Ghats moist deciduous forests ecoregion. The Anamudi is the tallest peak in South India, on the border of Ernakulam and Idukki districts. Some parts of the Idamalayar Reserve Forest and Mankulam Forest Division have Sholas but these parts are inaccessible by road. The Idamalayar Reserve Forest, and Edamalakkudy. Many types of sand, soil, and rocks are abundant here. Cochin International Airport is located in the northern part of the district at Nedumbassery, Kochi.

The district houses two Urban Agglomerations, Kochi and Kothamangalam. Kochi is the largest city in the state, and 17th most populous in the country according to the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs rankings based on the 2011 Census, with an area of over 843km2 and 2.12 million population.

===Topography===

The district is divided into three parts: lowland, midland, and the highland that consist of seaboard, plains, and hills and forests respectively. 20 percent of the total area are lowlands. The forests in the eastern part of the district are mostly remote, forming a part of the Anamalais. The highest peak is the Anamudi. The midland consists mainly of plain land and a group of islands that naturally drain water via backwaters and canals. The hilly or eastern portion is formed by a section of the Western Ghats. Muvattupuzha and Kothamangalam taluks, which were initially parts of the Kottayam district and constitute the highlands. Muvattupuzhayar and Periyar are the main rivers, of which the latter flows through Muvattupuzha, Aluva, Kunnathunad and Parur taluks. During the rainy season these rivers are full and heavy floods affect the low-lying areas on the banks, but in the summer season, they generally go dry and narrow. The Periyar is stretched over a length of .

Ernakulam district is the richest district in Kerala and is the biggest commercial centre in the state of Kerala. It contributes the most to the state exchequer in terms of GSVA and tax revenues. It has the highest literacy rate as well as the highest per capita income in the state, along with having the greatest number of commercialised banks, startups and large-scale industries &amp; MSMEs in the state. 
Its M.G. Road is home to some of Kerala&#x27;s most prestigious enterprises. Kochi is also the headquarters of some large companies like Lulu Group International, Federal Bank, Geojit, V-Guard, and Muthoot.

The sea along the entire coast of the district and its backwaters are the habitat of various kinds of fish that supply both marine and inland fisheries.

===Agriculture===

The eastern part of Ernakulam is primarily agrarian in nature. Rice is the principal crop cultivated in the wetlands. The district is the largest producer of nutmeg and pineapple in the state: more than 55% of pineapples produced in the state is cultivated in the district. Rubber is the most cultivated plantation crop in the district and the district is the second-largest producer of rubber in the state behind Kottayam. Other important crops cultivated in the district are tapioca, black pepper, areca nut, coconut, turmeric, banana, and plantain.

==Education==
Ernakulam is the first district in India to have 100 percent literacy by 1990. In fact Kochi has the highest literacy rate for any city in the country with over 20 lakhs population. Pothanikkad is the first village in India that achieved 100 percent literacy according to state literacy programme is in this district.

There are three prominent universities in Ernakulam: Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit in Kalady, Cochin University of Science and Technology in Kalamassery, and Kerala University of Fisheries and Ocean Studies in Kochi. The district has the most educational institutions in the state; as of 2019, there are 476 fully high-tech schools in Ernakulam.

In 2017, Ernakulam district administration launched the Roshni project, which aims to provide Malayalam education to migrant children. It supported 1,265 migrant workers&#x27; children from lower primary to high school.

==Divisions==

There are two revenue divisions: Fort Kochi and Muvattupuzha. The municipal corporation is in Kochi.

===Taluks===

The district has the most taluks in the state. The district is divided by two revenue divisions with seven taluks.

* Paravur
* Aluva
* Kunnathunad
* Muvattupuzha
* Kochi
* Kanayannur
* Kothamangalam
===Municipalities===

Interestingly, Ernakulam district has the most municipalities in the state.

* North Paravur
* Piravom
* Muvattupuzha
* Koothattukulam
* Perumbavoor
* Aluva
* Angamaly
* Thripunithura
* Kalamassery
* Kothamangalam
* Eloor
* Maradu
* Thrikkakara
A criticism that has been centered around this fact is that despite municipalities like Aluva, Kalamassery, Thrikkakara, Maradu, Tripunithura and Eloor becoming assimilated into Kochi city, they still exist as individual municipalities instead of being under Kochi Corporation. Surprisingly the corporation has not amended its limits for over half a century, since 1967 to be precise. The corporation was the largest in area and population when it was formed, and all these regions were panchayaths back then. Instead of adding them to the corporation when these regions started developing due to the urban expansion of Kochi city, they were made into separate municipalities thus largely handicapping the corporation. Now the call to expand these outdated limits for a better unified administration for the entire city of Kochi is a strong public demand.

===Parliamentary Constituencies===

* Ernakulam Parliamentary Constituency
* Chalakudy Parliamentary Constituency (partially)
* Idukki Parliamentary Constituency (parts of Muvattupuzha taluk and Kothamangalam taluk)
* Kottayam Parliamentary Constituency (parts of Muvattupuzha taluk and Kanayannur taluk)
===Assembly Constituencies===

*Angamaly
*Aluva
*Kalamassery
*North Paravur
*Vypin
*Kochi
*Ernakulam
*Thrikkakara
*Thripunithura
*Perumbavoor
*Kunnathunad
*Moovattupuzha

<text>In cinematography and photography, pre-flashing is the exposure of the film or other photosensor to uniform light prior to exposing it to the scene to be imaged. This adds a bias to the overall light input recorded by the sensor. 

It is sometimes used for artistic effects, as it can be used to add a colour cast to shadows without significantly affecting highlights.

It is also used in fields such as astronomy to bias CCD image sensors into a linear region, improving their low-light sensitivity.

<doc id="247874" wikidata="Q312461" url="?curid=247874" title="Terra nullius">
<text>Terra nullius (, plural &quot;terrae nullius&quot;) is a Latin expression meaning &quot;nobody&#x27;s land&quot;.
Since the nineteenth century it has occasionally been used in international law as a principle to justify claims that territory may be acquired by a state&#x27;s occupation of it. There are currently three territories sometimes claimed to be &quot;terra nullius&quot;: Bir Tawil (a strip of land between Egypt and the Sudan), four pockets of land near the Danube due to the Croatia–Serbia border dispute, and parts of Antarctica, principally Marie Byrd Land.

== Doctrine ==
In international law, &quot;terra nullius&quot; is territory which belongs to no state. Sovereignty over territory which is &quot;terra nullius&quot; can be acquired by any state by occupation. According to Oppenheim: &quot;The only territory which can be the object of occupation is that which does not already belong to another state, whether it is uninhabited, or inhabited by persons whose community is not considered to be a state; for individuals may live on as territory without forming themselves into a state proper exercising sovereignty over such territory.&quot;

Occupation of &quot;terra nullius&quot; is one of several ways in which a state can acquire territory under international law. The other means of acquiring territory are conquest, cession by agreement, accretion through the operations of nature, and prescription through the continuous exercise of sovereignty.

==History==
Although the term &quot;terra nullius&quot; was not used in international law before the late nineteenth century, some writers have traced the concept to the Roman law term &quot;res nullius&quot;, meaning &quot;nobody&#x27;s thing&quot;. In Roman law, things that were &quot;res nullius&quot;, such as wild animals (&quot;ferae bestiae&quot;), lost slaves and abandoned buildings could be taken as property by anyone by seizure. Benton and Straumann, however, state that the derivation of &quot;terra nullius&quot; from &quot;res nullius&quot; is &quot;by analogy&quot; only.

Sixteenth century writings on &quot;res nullius&quot; were in the context of European colonisation in the New World and the doctrine of discovery. In 1535, Domingo de Soto argued that Spain had no right to the Americas because the lands had not been &quot;res nullius&quot; at the time of discovery. Francisco de Vitoria, in 1539, also used the &quot;res nullius&quot; analogy to argue that the indigenous populations of the Americas, although “barbarians”, had both sovereignty and private ownership over their lands, and that the Spanish had gained no legal right to possession through mere discovery of these lands. Nevertheless, Vitoria stated that the Spanish possibly had a limited right to rule the indigenous Americans because the latter “are unsuited to setting up or administering a commonwealth both legitimate and ordered in human and civil terms.”

Alberico Gentili, in his &quot;De Jure Belli Libri Tres&quot; (1598), drew a distinction between the legitimate occupation of land that was &quot;res nullius&quot; and illegitimate claims of sovereignty through discovery and occupation of land that was not &quot;res nullius&quot;, as in the case of the Spanish claim to the Americas. Hugo Grotius, writing in 1625, also stated that discovery does not give a right to sovereignty over inhabited land, “For discovery applies to those things which belong to no one.”

By the eighteenth century, however, some writers argued that territorial rights over land could stem from the settlement and cultivation of that land. William Blackstone, in 1765, wrote, &quot;Plantations or colonies, in distant countries, are either such where the lands are claimed by right of occupancy only, by finding them desert and uncultivated, and peopling them from the mother-country; or where, when already cultivated, they have been either gained by conquest, or ceded to us by treaties. And both these rights are founded upon the law of nature, or at least upon that of nations.&quot;

Several years before Blackstone, Emer de Vattel, in his &quot;Le droit des gents&quot; (1758), drew a distinction between land that was effectively occupied and cultivated, and the unsettled and uncultivated land of nomads which was open to colonisation. 

Borch states that many commentators erroneously interpreted this to mean that any uncultivated lands, whether inhabited or not, could be claimed by a colonising state by right of occupancy. Borch places the shift towards the view that &quot;uncultivated&quot; but inhabited lands were &quot;terra nullius&quot; primarily in the 19th century, and argues it was a result of political developments and the rise of new intellectual currents such as scientific racism and legal positivism.

The Berlin West Africa Conference of 1884-85 endorsed the principle that sovereignty over an unclaimed territory required effective occupation, and that where native populations had established effective occupation their sovereignty could not be unilaterally overturned by a colonising state.

The term &quot;terra nullius&quot; was used in 1885 in relation to the dispute between Spain and the United States over Contoy Island. Herman Eduard von Hoist, wrote, “Contoy was not, in an international sense, a desert, that is an abandoned island and hence &quot;terra nullius.&quot;&quot; In 1888, the introduced the concept of &quot;territorium nullius&quot; (nobody’s territory) as a public law equivalent to the private law concept of &quot;res nullius&quot;.

In 1909, the Italian international jurist Camille Piccioni described the island of Spitzbergen in the Arctic Circle as &quot;terra nullius&quot;. Even though the island was inhabited by the nationals of several European countries, the inhabitants did not live under any formal sovereignty.

In subsequent decades, the term &quot;terra nullius&quot; gradually replaced &quot;territorium nullius.&quot; Fitzmaurice argues that the two concepts were initially distinct, &quot;territorium nullius&quot; applying to territory in which the inhabitants might have property rights but had not developed political sovereignty whereas &quot;terra nullius&quot; referred to an absence of property. Nevertheless, &quot;terra nullius&quot; also implied an absence of sovereignty because sovereignty required property rights acquired through the exploitation of nature. Michael Connor, however, argues that &quot;territorium nullius&quot; and &quot;terra nullius&quot; were the same concept, meaning land without sovereignty, and that property rights and cultivation of land were not part of the concept.

The term &quot;terra nullius&quot; was adopted by the International Court of Justice in its 1975 Western Sahara advisory opinion. The majority wrote, &quot;&#x27;Occupation&#x27; being legally an original means of peaceably acquiring sovereignty over territory otherwise than by cession or succession, it was a cardinal condition of a valid &#x27;occupation&#x27; that the territory should be &quot;terra nullius&quot; – a territory belonging to no-one – at the time of the act alleged to constitute the &#x27;occupation&#x27;.&quot; The court found that at the time of Spanish colonisation in 1884, the inhabitants of Western Sahara were nomadic but socially and politically organised in tribes and under chiefs competent to represent them. According to State practice of the time the territory therefore was not &quot;terra nullius&quot;.

== Current claims of &quot;terra nullius&quot; ==
There are three current instances where land is sometimes claimed to be &quot;terra nullius&quot;: Bir Tawil bordering Egypt and the Sudan, four small areas along the Croatia–Serbia border, and Marie Byrd Land in Antarctica.

=== Bir Tawil ===

Between Egypt and the Sudan is the landlocked territory of Bir Tawil, which was created by a discrepancy between borders drawn in 1899 and 1902. One border placed Bir Tawil under the Sudan&#x27;s control and the Halaib Triangle under Egypt&#x27;s; the other border did the reverse. Each country asserts the border that would give it the much larger Halaib Triangle, to the east, which is adjacent to the Red Sea, with the side effect that Bir Tawil is unclaimed by either country (each claims the other owns it). Bir Tawil has no settled population, but the land is used by Bedouins who roam the area.

=== Gornja Siga and other pockets ===


Croatia and Serbia dispute several small areas on the east bank of the Danube. However, four pockets on the western river bank, of which Gornja Siga is the largest, are not claimed by either country. Serbia makes no claims on the land while Croatia states that the land belongs to Serbia. Croatia states that the disputed area is not &quot;terra nullius&quot; and they are negotiating with Serbia to settle the border.

=== Marie Byrd Land ===

While several countries made claims to parts of Antarctica in the first half of the 20th century, the remainder, including most of Marie Byrd Land (the portion east from 150°W to 90°W), has not been claimed by any sovereign state. Signatories to the Antarctic Treaty of 1959 agreed not to make such claims, except the Soviet Union and the United States, who reserved the right to make a claim.

An undefined area from 20°W to 45°E was historically considered potentially unclaimed; the Norwegian claim in Queen Maud Land was interpreted as covering the coastal regions, but not continuing all the way to the South Pole. In 2015, the claim was extended to reach as far as 90°S.

== Historical claims of &quot;terra nullius&quot; ==
Several territories have been claimed to be &quot;terra nullius&quot;. In a minority of those claims, international and domestic courts have ruled on whether the territory is or was &quot;terra nullius&quot; or not.

=== Africa ===
==== Burkina Faso and the Niger ====
A narrow strip of land adjacent to two territorial markers along the Burkina Faso–Niger border was claimed by neither country until the International Court of Justice settled a more extensive territorial dispute in 2013. The former unclaimed territory was awarded to the Niger.

====Western Sahara====

At the request of Morocco, the International Court of Justice in 1975 addressed whether Western Sahara was &quot;terra nullius&quot; at the time of Spanish colonization in 1885. The court found in its advisory opinion that Western Sahara was not &quot;terra nullius&quot; at that time.

===Asia===
====Pinnacle Islands (Diaoyu Islands/Senkaku Islands)====
A disputed archipelago in the East China Sea, the uninhabited Pinnacle Islands, were claimed by Japan to have become part of its territory as &quot;terra nullius&quot; in January 1895, following the Japanese victory in the First Sino-Japanese War. However, this interpretation is not accepted by the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC) and the Republic of China (Taiwan), both of whom claim sovereignty over the islands.

====Saudi–Iraqi neutral zone====
It was an area of on the border between Saudi Arabia and Iraq within which the border between the two countries had not been settled. The neutral zone came into existence following the Uqair Protocol of 1922 that defined the border between Iraq and the Sultanate of Nejd (Saudi Arabia&#x27;s predecessor state). An agreement to partition the neutral zone was reached by Iraqi and Saudi representatives on 26 December 1981, and approved by the Iraqi National Assembly on 28 January 1982. The territory was divided on an unknown date between 28 January and 30 July 1982. Notice was given to the United Nations in June 1991.
====Saudi–Kuwaiti neutral zone====
====Scarborough Shoal (South China Sea)====
The People&#x27;s Republic of China, the Republic of China (Taiwan) and the Philippines claim Scarborough Shoal, also known as Panatag Shoal or Huangyan Island (). The nearest landmass is the Philippine island of Luzon at 220 km (119 nmi), located in the South China Sea. The Philippines claims it under the principle of &quot;terra nullius&quot; and the fact that it lies within its EEZ (exclusive economic zone). Meanwhile, both China and Taiwan claim the shoal based on historical records that Chinese fishermen had discovered and mapped the shoal since the 13th century.

Previously, the shoal was administered as part of Municipality of Masinloc, Province of Zambales, by the Philippines. Since the Scarborough Shoal standoff in 2012, the shoal has been administered as part of Xisha District, Sansha City, Hainan Province, by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Taiwan places the shoal under the administration of Cijin District, Kaohsiung City, but does not have control of the shoal.

The Permanent Court of Arbitration (PCA) denied the lawfulness of China&#x27;s claim in 2016; China rejected the ruling, calling it &quot;ill-founded&quot;. In 2019, Taiwan also rejected the ruling and has sent more naval vessels to the area.
It has been speculated that Scarborough Shoal is a prime location for the construction of an artificial island and Chinese ships have been seen in the vicinity of the shoal. However, analysis of photos has concluded that the ships lack dredging equipment and therefore represent no imminent threat of reclamation work.

====Ireland====
The term &quot;terra nullius&quot; has been applied by some modern academics in discussing the English colonisation of Ireland, although the term is not used in the international law sense and is often used as an analogy. Griffen and Cogliano state that the English viewed Ireland as a &quot;terra nullius&quot;. In &quot;The Irish Difference: A Tumultuous History of Ireland’s Breakup With Britain&quot;, Fergal Tobin writes that &quot;Ireland had no tradition of unified statehood and no culturally unified establishment. Indeed, it had never known any kind of political unity until a version of it was imposed by Cromwell&#x27;s sword […] So the English Protestant interest […] came to regard Ireland as a kind of &quot;terra nullius&quot;.&quot; Similarly, Bruce McLeod writes in &quot;The Geography of Empire in English Literature, 1580-1745&quot; that &quot;although the English were familiar with Ireland and its geography in comparison to North America, they treated Ireland as though it were &quot;terra nullius&quot; and thus easily and geometrically subdivided into territorial units.&quot; Rolston and McVeigh trace this attitude back to Gerald of Wales (13th century), who wrote &quot;This people despises work on the land, has little use for the money-making of towns, contemns the rights and privileges of citizenship, and desires neither to abandon, nor lose respect for, the life which it has been accustomed to lead in the woods and countryside.&quot; The semi-nomadism of the native Irish meant that some English judged them not to be productive users of land. However, Rolston and McVeigh state that Gerald made it clear that Ireland was acquired by conquest and not through the occupation of &quot;terra nullius&quot;.

====Rockall====
According to Ian Mitchell, Rockall was &quot;terra nullius&quot; until it was claimed by the United Kingdom in 1955.
It was formally annexed in 1972.

==== Sealand ====
In 1967, Paddy Roy Bates claimed an abandoned British anti-aircraft gun tower in the North Sea as the &quot;Principality of Sealand&quot;. The structure is now within British territorial waters and no country recognises Sealand.

==== Svalbard ====
Denmark–Norway, the Dutch Republic, the Kingdom of Great Britain, and the Kingdom of Scotland all claimed sovereignty over the archipelago of Svalbard in the seventeenth century, but none permanently occupied it. Expeditions from each of these polities visited Svalbard principally during the summer for whaling, with the first two sending a few wintering parties in the 1620s and 1630s.

During the 19th century, both Norway and Russia made strong claims to the archipelago. In 1909, Italian jurist Camille Piccioni described Spitzbergen, as it was then known, as &quot;terra nullius&quot;:
The territorial dispute was eventually resolved by the Svalbard Treaty of 9 February 1920 which recognized Norwegian sovereignty over the islands.

=== North America ===
==== Canada ====

Joseph Trutch, the first Lieutenant Governor of British Columbia, insisted that First Nations had never owned land, and thus their land claims could safely be ignored. It is for this reason that most of British Columbia remains unceded land.

In &quot;Guerin v. The Queen&quot;, a Canadian Supreme Court decision of 1984 on aboriginal rights, the Court stated that the government has a fiduciary duty toward the First Nations of Canada and established aboriginal title to be a &quot;sui generis&quot; right. Since then there has been a more complicated debate and a general narrowing of the definition of &quot;fiduciary duty&quot;.

==== Eastern Greenland ====
Norway occupied and claimed parts of (then uninhabited) eastern Greenland in 1931, claiming that it constituted &quot;terra nullius&quot; and calling the territory Erik the Red&#x27;s Land.

The Permanent Court of International Justice ruled against the Norwegian claim. The Norwegians accepted the ruling and withdrew their claim.

==== United States ====
A similar concept of &quot;uncultivated land&quot; was employed by John Quincy Adams to identify supposedly unclaimed wilderness.

===== Guano Islands =====
The Guano Islands Act of 18 August 1856 enabled citizens of the U.S. to take possession of islands containing guano deposits. The islands can be located anywhere, so long as they are not occupied and not within the jurisdiction of other governments. It also empowers the President of the United States to use the military to protect such interests, and establishes the criminal jurisdiction of the United States.

=== Oceania ===
==== Australia ====
The British penal colony of New South Wales, which included more than half of mainland Australia, was proclaimed by Governor Captain Arthur Phillip at Sydney in February 1788. At the time of British colonisation, Aboriginal Australians had occupied Australia for at least 50,000 years. They were complex hunter-gatherers with diverse economies and societies and about 250 different language groups. The Aboriginal population of the Sydney area was an estimated 4,000 to 8,000 people who were organised in clans which occupied land with traditional boundaries.

There is debate over whether Australia was colonised by the British from 1788 on the basis that the land was &quot;terra nullius&quot;. Frost, Attwood and others argue that even though the term &quot;terra nullius&quot; was not used in the eighteenth century, there was widespread acceptance of the concept that a state could acquire territory through occupation of land that was not already under sovereignty and was uninhabited or inhabited by peoples who had not developed permanent settlements, agriculture, property rights or political organisation recognised by European states. Borch, however, states that, &quot;it seems much more likely that there was no legal doctrine maintaining that inhabited land could be regarded as ownerless, nor was this the basis of official policy, in the eighteenth century or before. Rather it seems to have developed as a legal theory in the nineteenth century.”

In &quot;Mabo v Queensland (No 2)&quot; (1992), Justice Dawson stated, &quot;Upon any account, the policy which was implemented and the laws which were passed in New South Wales make it plain that, from the inception of the colony, the Crown treated all land in the colony as unoccupied and afforded no recognition to any form of native interest in the land.&quot;

Stuart Banner states that the first known Australian legal use of the concept (although not the term) &quot;terra nullius&quot; was in 1819 in a tax dispute between Barron Field and the Governor of New South Wales Lachlan Macquarie. The matter was referred to British Attorney General Samuel Shepherd and Solicitor General Robert Gifford who advised that New South Wales had not been acquired by conquest or cession, but by possession as &quot;desert and uninhabited&quot;.

In 1835, a Proclamation by Governor Bourke stated that British subjects could not obtain title over vacant Crown land directly from Aboriginal Australians.

In &quot;R v Murrell&quot; (1836) Justice Burton of the Supreme Court of New South Wales stated, &quot;although it might be granted that on the first taking possession of the Colony, the aborigines were entitled to be recognised as free and independent, yet they were not in such a position with regard to strength as to be considered free and independent tribes. They had no sovereignty.&quot;

In the Privy Council case &quot;Cooper v Stuart&quot; (1889), Lord Watson stated that New South Wales was, &quot;a tract of territory practically unoccupied, without settled inhabitants or settled law, at the time when it was peacefully annexed to the British dominions.&quot;

In the Mabo Case (1992), the High Court of Australia considered the question of whether Australia had been colonised by Britain on the basis that it was &quot;terra nullius&quot;. The court did not consider the legality of the initial colonisation as this was a matter of international law and, &quot;The acquisition of territory by a sovereign state for the first time is an act of state which cannot be challenged, controlled or interfered with by the courts of that state.&quot; The questions for decision included the implications of the initial colonisation for the transmission of the common law to New South Wales and whether the common law recognised that the Indigenous inhabitants had any form of native title to land. Dismissing a number of previous authorities, the court rejected the &quot;enlarged notion of terra nullius&quot;, by which lands inhabited by Indigenous peoples could be considered desert and uninhabited for the purposes of Australian municipal law. The court found that the common law of Australia recognised a form of native title held by the Indigenous peoples of Australia and that this title persisted unless extinguished by a valid exercise of sovereign power inconsistent with the continued right to enjoy native title.

==== Clipperton Island ====
The sovereignty of Clipperton Island was settled by arbitration between France and Mexico. King Victor Emmanuel III of Italy rendered a decision in 1931 that the sovereignty of Clipperton Island belongs to France from the date of November 17, 1858. The Mexican claim was rejected for lack of proof of prior Spanish discovery and, in any event, no effective occupation by Mexico before 1858, when the island was therefore &quot;territorium nullius&quot;, and the French occupation then was sufficient and legally continuing.

==== South Island of New Zealand ====
In 1840, the newly appointed Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, Captain William Hobson of the Royal Navy, following instructions from the British government, declared sovereignty over the Middle Island (later called the South Island) and Stewart Island on the basis they were &quot;terra nullius&quot;.

=== South America ===
==== Patagonia ====
Patagonia was according to some considerations regarded a &quot;terra nullius&quot; in the 19th century. This notion ignored the Spanish Crown&#x27;s recognition of indigenous Mapuche sovereignty and is considered by scholars Nahuelpán and Antimil to have set the stage for an era of Chilean &quot;republican colonialism&quot;.

<text>The Boat Race is an annual set of rowing races between the Cambridge University Boat Club and the Oxford University Boat Club, traditionally rowed between open-weight eights on the River Thames in London, England. It is also known as the University Boat Race and the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race.

The men&#x27;s race was first held in 1829 and has been held annually since 1856, except during the First and Second World Wars (although unofficial races were conducted) and the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020. The first women&#x27;s event was held in 1927, and the Women&#x27;s Boat Race has been an annual event since 1964. Since 2015, the women&#x27;s race has taken place on the same day and course, and since 2018 the combined event of the two races has been referred to as &quot;The Boat Race&quot;.

The Championship Course has hosted the vast majority of the races. Covering a stretch of the Thames in West London, from Putney to Mortlake, it is over three times the distance of an Olympic race. Members of both crews are traditionally known as blues and each boat as a &quot;Blue Boat&quot;, with Cambridge in light blue and Oxford in dark blue. As of the 2024 race, Cambridge has won the men&#x27;s race 87 times to Oxford&#x27;s 81 times, with one dead heat, and has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1930. In the women&#x27;s race, Cambridge has won the race 47 times to Oxford&#x27;s 30 times, and has led Oxford in cumulative wins since 1966. A reserve boat race has been held since 1965 for the men and since 1966 for the women.

In most years over 250,000 people watch the race from the banks of the river. In 2009, a record 270,000 people watched the race live. The race is broadcast internationally on television; in 2014, 15 million people watched the race on television.

==History of the men&#x27;s race==

===Origin===

The tradition was started in 1829 by Charles Merivale, a student at St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and his Old Harrovian school friend Charles Wordsworth who was studying at Christ Church, Oxford. The University of Cambridge challenged the University of Oxford to a race at Henley-on-Thames but Oxford won easily. Oxford raced in dark blue because five members of the crew, including the stroke, were from Christ Church, then Head of the River, whose colours were dark blue.

The second race was in 1836, with the venue moved to a course from Westminster to Putney. Over the next two years, there was disagreement over where the race should be held, with Oxford preferring Henley and Cambridge preferring London. Following the official formation of the Oxford University Boat Club, racing between the two universities resumed in 1839 on the Tideway and the tradition continues to the present day, with the loser challenging the winner to a rematch annually.

Since 1856, the race has been held every year, except for the years 1915 to 1919 due to World War I, 1940 to 1945, due to World War II, and in 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic policy.

===1877 dead heat===

The race in 1877 was declared a dead heat. Both crews finished in a time of 24minutes and 8seconds in bad weather. The verdict of the race judge, John Phelps, is considered suspect because he was reportedly over 70 and blind in one eye. Rowing historian Tim Koch, writing in the official 2014 Boat Race Programme, notes that there is &quot;a very big and very entrenched lie&quot; about the race, including the claim that Phelps had announced &quot;Dead heat... to Oxford by six feet&quot; (the distance supposedly mentioned by Phelps varies according to the telling).

Phelps&#x27;s nickname &quot;Honest John&quot; was not an ironic one, and he was not (as is sometimes claimed) drunk under a bush at the time of the finish. He did have to judge who had won without the assistance of finish posts (which were installed in time for the next year&#x27;s race). Some newspapers had believed Oxford won a narrow victory but their viewpoint was from downstream; Phelps considered that the boats were essentially level with each surging forward during the stroke cycle. With no clear way to determine who had surged forward at the exact finish line, Phelps could only pronounce it a dead heat. Koch believes that the press and Oxford supporters made up the stories about Phelps later, which Phelps had no chance to refute.


=== Cancellations during World Wars ===
Because of World War I and II, the race was not held in 1915–1919 and 1940–1945. On 12 January 1915, &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; announced that the annual race was cancelled due to men leaving for war, &quot;for every available oarsman, either Fresher or Blue, has joined the colours.&quot;

===1959 Oxford mutiny===

In 1959 some of the existing Oxford blues attempted to oust president Ronnie Howard and coach Jumbo Edwards. However, their attempt failed when Cambridge supported the president. Three of the dissidents returned and Oxford went on to win by six lengths.

===1987 Oxford mutiny===
Following defeat in the previous year&#x27;s race, Oxford&#x27;s first in eleven years, American Chris Clark was determined to gain revenge: &quot;Next year we&#x27;re gonna kick ass ... Cambridge&#x27;s ass. Even if I have to go home and bring the whole US squad with me.&quot; He recruited another four American post-graduates: three international-class rowers (Dan Lyons, Chris Huntington and Chris Penny) and a cox (Jonathan Fish), in an attempt to put together the fastest Boat Race crew in the history of the contest.
Disagreements over the training regime of Dan Topolski, the Oxford coach (&quot;He wanted us to spend more time training on land than water!&quot;, lamented Lyons), led to the crew walking out on at least one occasion, and resulted in the coach revising his approach. A fitness test between Clark and club president Donald Macdonald (in which Clark triumphed) resulted in a call for Macdonald&#x27;s removal; it was accompanied with a threat that the Americans would refuse to row should Macdonald remain in the crew. As boat club president, Macdonald &quot;had absolute power over selection&quot;, and when he announced that Clark would row on starboard, his weaker side, Macdonald would row on the port side and Tony Ward was to be dropped from the crew entirely, the American contingent mutinied. After considerable negotiation and debate, much of it conducted in the public eye, Clark, Penny, Huntington, Lyons and Fish were dropped and replaced by members of Oxford&#x27;s reserve crew, Isis.

The race was won by Oxford by fourlengths, despite Cambridge being favourites.

In 1989 Topolski and author Patrick Robinson&#x27;s book about the events, &quot;True Blue: The Oxford Boat Race Mutiny&quot;, was published. Seven years later, a film based on the book was released. Alison Gill, the then-president of the Oxford University Women&#x27;s Boat Club, wrote &quot;The Yanks at Oxford&quot;, in which she defended the Americans and claimed Topolski wrote &quot;True Blue&quot; in order to justify his own actions. River and Rowing Museum founder Chris Dodd described &quot;True Blue&quot; as &quot;particularly offensive&quot; yet also wrote &quot;[Oxford] lacked the power, the finesse—basically everything the pre-mutiny line-up had going for it.&quot;

===2012 disruption===

In the 2012 race, after almost three-quarters of the course had been rowed, the race was halted for over 30 minutes when a lone protester, Australian Trenton Oldfield, entered the water from Chiswick Eyot and deliberately swam between the boats near Chiswick Pier with the intention of protesting against spending cuts, and what he saw as the erosion of civil liberties and a growing culture of elitism within British society. Once he was spotted by assistant umpire Sir Matthew Pinsent, both boats were required to stop for safety reasons. Once restarted, the boats clashed and the oar of Oxford crewman Hanno Wienhausen was broken in half with the blade snapped off. The race umpire John Garrett judged the clash to be Oxford&#x27;s fault and allowed the race to continue. Cambridge quickly took the lead and went on to win the race. The Oxford crew entered a final appeal to the umpire which was quickly rejected; and Cambridge were confirmed as winners in the first race since 1849 that a crew had won the boat race without an official recorded winning time. After the end of the race Oxford&#x27;s bow man, Alex Woods, received emergency treatment after collapsing in the boat from exhaustion. Because of the circumstances, the post-race celebrations by the winning Cambridge crew were unusually muted and the planned award ceremony was cancelled.

===2020 cancellation===

Like other sports events, the 2020 boat race was cancelled because of COVID-19 pandemic policy.

===2021 relocation===

The 2021 races were held on the Great Ouse at Ely in Cambridgeshire, over a shorter straight course of . This was due to the safety issues of Hammersmith Bridge, as well as restrictions due to the COVID-19 pandemic still being in force.

The 2022 Boat Race returned to the Thames and the traditional course between Putney and Mortlake.

===Sinkings===
In the 1912 race, run in extremely poor weather and high winds, both crews sank. Oxford rowed into a significant early lead, but began taking on water, and made for the bank shortly after passing Hammersmith Bridge to empty the boat out: although they attempted to restart, the race was abandoned at this point because Cambridge had also sunk while passing the Harrods Depository.

Cambridge also sank in 1859 and in 1978, while Oxford did so in 1925, and again in 1951; the 1951 race was re-rowed on the following Monday. In 1984 the Cambridge boat sank after colliding with a barge before the start of the race, which was then rescheduled for the next day. In 2016, at Barnes Bridge, Cambridge women began to sink but gradually recovered to complete the race.

==History of the women&#x27;s race==
From the first women&#x27;s event in 1927, the Women&#x27;s Boat Race was run separately from the men&#x27;s event until 2015. There was significant inequality between the two events. Changes in recent years, arising significantly from the sponsorship of Newton Investment Management, have made the two races more equal: both events have been held together on The Tideway since 2015, and there are new training facilities for the women, comparable to those of the men, since 2016.

==Courses==
The 1st Boat Race took place at Henley-on-Thames in 1829 but the event was subsequently officially held along the Thames, mostly the Championship Course, except the 2021 race which was moved to the River Great Ouse due the COVID-19 pandemic and safety concerns under Hammersmith Bridge. Unofficial races were held during the Second World War at various locations.

===The Championship Course===

The Championship Course is 4 miles and 374 yards (6.779 km) from Putney to Mortlake, passing Hammersmith and Barnes, following an S shape, east to west. The start and finish are marked by the University Boat Race Stones on the south bank. The clubs&#x27; presidents toss a coin (the 1829 sovereign) before the race for the right to choose which side of the river (station) they will row on: their decision is based on the weather, the speed of the flood tide, and how the three bends in the course might favour their crew&#x27;s pace. The north station (&#x27;Middlesex&#x27;) has the advantage of the first and last bends, and the south (&#x27;Surrey&#x27;) station the other, longer bend.

During the race the coxes compete for the fastest current, which lies at the deepest part of the river, frequently leading to clashes of blades and warnings from the umpire. A crew that gets a lead of more than a boat&#x27;s length can cut in front of their opponent, making it extremely difficult for the trailing crew to gain the lead. For this reason the tactics of the race are generally to go fast early on, and it is unusual for the leading crew to change after halfway (though this happened in 2003, 2007 and 2010).

Save for three Victorian instances, each race is rowed westwards, but starts during the incoming (known as flood) tide, so that the crews are rowing with, not against, the fast stream. At the conclusion of the race, the boats come ashore at the shared shingle of the two boat clubs in Chiswick, a few metres west of Chiswick Bridge. Here, shortly after the race, the Boat Race trophy is presented to the winning crew. It is traditional for the winning side to throw their cox into the Thames to celebrate their achievement.

===Unofficial courses===
In addition, there were four unofficial boat races held during the Second World War away from London. None of those competing were awarded blues, and these races are not included in the official list:
*1940, 1945 – Henley-on-Thames 
*1943 – Sandford-on-Thames
*1944 – River Great Ouse, Ely: Littleport to Queen Adelaide

===Women&#x27;s Boat Race courses===
During its early years (1927 to 1976 with several gaps) the Women&#x27;s Boat Race alternated between The Isis in Oxford and the River Cam in Cambridge over a distance of about 1,000 yards. On two occasions, in 1929 and 1935, the race was held on the Tideway in London. Unlike the men&#x27;s race, the official women&#x27;s race continued in most years through the Second World War.

From 1977 to 2014, the Women&#x27;s Boat Race was usually held on a 2000-metre course as part of the Henley Boat Races. However, in 2013 the entire Henley Boat Races were moved to Dorney Lake due to rough water at Henley. In 2021, the race was held on the River Great Ouse from Ely, Cambridgeshire, along with the men&#x27;s race.

==Media coverage==
The race first appeared in a short film of the 1895 race entitled &quot;The Oxford and Cambridge University Boat Race&quot;, directed and produced by Birt Acres. Consisting of a single shot of around a minute, it was the first film to be commercially screened in the UK outside London. The event is now a British national institution, and is televised live each year. The women&#x27;s race has received television coverage and grown in popularity since 2015, attracting a television audience of 4.8 million viewers that year. BBC Television first covered the men&#x27;s race in 1938, the BBC having covered it on radio since 1927. For the 2005 to 2009 races, the BBC lost the television rights to ITV, after 66 years, but it returned to the corporation in 2010. Ethnographer Mark de Rond described the training, selection, and victory of the 2007 Cambridge crew in &quot;The Last Amateurs: To Hell and Back with the Cambridge Boat Race Crew&quot;.

==Competitors==

===Men&#x27;s race===

Many notable individuals have participated in the Boat Race, including those of an Olympic standard. Four-time Olympic gold medallist Sir Matthew Pinsent, rowed for Oxford in 1990, 1991, and 1993. Olympic gold medallists from 2000 – James Cracknell (Cambridge 2019), Tim Foster (Oxford 1997), Luka Grubor (Oxford 1997), Andrew Lindsay (Oxford 1997, 1998, 1999) and Kieran West (Cambridge 1999, 2001, 2006, 2007), 2004 – Ed Coode (Oxford 1998), and 2008 – Jake Wetzel (Oxford 2006) and Malcolm Howard (Oxford 2013, 2014) have also rowed for their university.

Other famous participants include Andrew Irvine (Oxford 1922, 1923), Lord Snowdon (Cambridge 1950), Colin Moynihan (Oxford 1977), actor Hugh Laurie (Cambridge 1980), TV presenter Dan Snow (Oxford 1999, 2000, 2001) and Conspicuous Gallantry Cross recipient Robin Bourne-Taylor (Oxford 2001, 2002, 2003, 2005).

===Academic status===
Oxford University does not offer sport scholarships at entry; student-athletes are not admitted differently to any other students and must meet the academic requirements of the university, with sport having a neutral effect on any application. Likewise, bursaries and scholarship opportunities for athletes at the University of Cambridge are only open to those students who have already been admitted to the university on academic merit.

In order to protect the status of the race as a competition between genuine students, the Cambridge University Blues Committee in July 2007 refused to award a blue to 2006 and 2007 Cambridge oarsman Thorsten Engelmann, as he did not complete his academic course and instead returned to the German national rowing team to prepare for the Beijing Olympics. This has caused a debate about a change of rules, and one suggestion is that only students who are enrolled in courses lasting at least two years should be eligible to race.

===Standard of the men&#x27;s crews===

According to British Olympic gold medallist Martin Cross, Boat Race crews of the early 1980s were viewed as &quot;a bit of a joke&quot; by some international-level rowers of the time. However, their standard has improved substantially since then. In 2007 Cambridge were entered in the London Head of the River Race, where they should have been measured directly against the best crews in Britain and beyond. However, the event was called off after several crews were sunk or swamped in rough conditions. Cambridge were fastest of the few crews who did complete the course.

==Sponsorship==
===Men&#x27;s race===
The Boat Race has been sponsored since 1976, with the money spent mainly on equipment and travel during the training period. The sponsors do not have their logos on the boats, but now tend to have their logo on kit during the race. They also provide branded training gear and have some naming rights. Boat Race sponsors have included Ladbrokes, Beefeater Gin, Aberdeen Asset Management, and the business process outsourcing company Xchanging for a few years until 2012. Since 2010 the deal has included the crews agreeing to wear the logo on their race kit for more funding. Prior to this, all sponsorship marks had been scrupulously discarded on boating for the competition, on amateurist, &#x27;Corinthian&#x27; values but perhaps also as before televised races a single sponsor for both crews was unlikely. The sponsor has extended to being a &quot;title sponsor&quot; (titular, official race name) since such a longer name of the race was founded in 2010, the first three of which thus becoming &quot;The Xchanging Boat Race&quot;.

In 2013, the sponsor BNY Mellon took over and it became the BNY Mellon Boat Race. From 2016 to 2018, BNY Mellon and Newton Investment management donated the title sponsorship to Cancer Research UK.

===Women&#x27;s race===
The Women&#x27;s Boat Race 2011 was the first to be sponsored by Newton Investment Management, a subsidiary of BNY Mellon. Previously the crews had no sponsorship and were self funded. Newton have remained the sponsor since then and increased the amount of funding significantly.

The Boat Races

In 2021, the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s Boat Races came under the same sponsorship for the first time. Gemini, a cryptocurrency exchange founded by 2010 Oxford Blues Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss, took over as title sponsor and it became the Gemini Boat Race.

==Other boat races involving Oxford and Cambridge==

Although the Boat Race crews are the best-known, the universities both field reserve crews. The reserves race takes place on the same day as the main race. The Oxford men&#x27;s reserve crew is called &quot;Isis&quot; (after the Isis, a section of the River Thames which passes through Oxford), and the Cambridge reserve men&#x27;s crew is called &quot;Goldie&quot; (the name comes from rower and Boat Club president John Goldie, 1849–1896, after whom the Goldie Boathouse is named). The women&#x27;s reserve crews are &quot;Osiris &quot;(Oxford) and &quot;Blondie &quot;(Cambridge). A veterans&#x27; boat race, usually held on a weekday before the main Boat Race, takes place on the Thames between Putney and Hammersmith.

The two universities also field lightweight men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s crews. These squads race each other in eights as part of the Lightweight Boat Races. The first men&#x27;s race took place in 1975, being joined by a women&#x27;s race in 1984. Both races are currently held on the Championship Course from Putney to Mortlake, although they previously formed part of the Henley Boat Races, along with various other rowing races between the two universities including the openweight women&#x27;s Boat Race until 2015. Competitors in the event have gone on to compete at international and Olympic levels, as well as represent their universities at openweight level. For the men&#x27;s race the average weight of the crew must be , with no rower weighing over . For the women&#x27;s race no rower can exceed . At Oxford, both the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s lightweight boats are awarded a full blue. At Cambridge the women&#x27;s boat is awarded a full blue, whereas the men&#x27;s boat receives a half-blue.

== In popular culture ==
&quot;Boat race&quot; became such a popular phrase that it was incorporated into Cockney rhyming slang, for &quot;face&quot;.

In the stories of P. G. Wodehouse, several characters allude to Boat Race night as a time of riotous celebration (presumably after the victory of the character&#x27;s &quot;alma mater&quot;). This frequently sees the participants in trouble with the authorities. In &quot;Piccadilly Jim&quot;, it is mentioned that Lord Datchett was thrown out of the Empire Music Hall every year on Boat Race night while he was an undergraduate. Bertie Wooster mentions he is &quot;rather apt to let myself go a bit&quot; on Boat Race night and several times describes being fined five pounds at &quot;Bosher Street&quot; (possibly a reference to Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court) for stealing a policeman&#x27;s helmet one year; the beginning of the first episode of the television series &quot;Jeeves and Wooster&quot; shows his court appearance on this occasion. In the short story &quot;Jeeves and the Chump Cyril&quot;, he describes having to repeatedly bail out of jail a friend who is arrested every year on Boat Race night.

In &quot;Missee Lee&quot; by Arthur Ransome (one of the Swallows and Amazons series of children&#x27;s books) Captain Flint (who had dropped out of Oxford) tells Missee Lee he was in gaol once on &quot;Boat-race night. High spirits. A fancy for policemen&#x27;s helmets.&quot; When Missee Lee says &quot;Camblidge won and evellybody happy&quot; he replies &quot;Not that year, ma&#x27;am. We were the happy ones that year&quot;. In the Jennings books by Anthony Buckeridge the protagonist&#x27;s teacher Mr Wilkins is a former Cambridge rowing blue.

The 1969 film &quot;The Magic Christian&quot; features the Boat Race, as Sir Guy makes use of the Oxford crew in one of his elaborate pranks.

Actor and comedian Matt Berry wrote and narrated an irreverent, alternative history of the Boat Race for the BBC in 2015.

<doc id="247885" wikidata="Q947273" url="?curid=247885" title="Corona del Mar, Newport Beach">
<text>Corona del Mar (Spanish for &quot;Crown of the Sea&quot;) is a seaside neighborhood in the city of Newport Beach, California. It generally consists of all the land on the seaward face of the San Joaquin Hills south of Avocado Avenue to the city limits, as well as the development of Irvine Terrace, just north of Avocado. Corona del Mar is known for its beaches, tide pools, cliffside views and village shops. Beaches in the area include Corona del Mar State Beach as well as Crystal Cove State Park south of Corona del Mar, accessible by paths winding down a steep hillside. Corona del Mar has a representative to the Newport Beach City Council. Residents use a mailing address of Corona del Mar with the 92625 ZIP code.

==History==
The Tongva village or landmark site of Moyongna was located at or near Corona del Mar. Some researchers have placed the location at the Newporter Inn, while others have disputed this location.

The region of Corona Del Mar was initially purchased for $150,000 by James Irvine in 1875. Almost 30 years later in 1904, the 700 acres of land was sold to Corona Del Mar&#x27;s founder, George E. Hart. The community of Corona Del Mar grew to establish its own post office on July 16, 1926, with Mrs. Edna L. Stuckey assuming duties as the first postmistress. A development consisting of unsold land in Corona del Mar was established in 1915 and named Balboa Palisades.

<doc id="247886" wikidata="Q463375" url="?curid=247886" title="Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free">
<text>&quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot; is the national anthem of Zambia. The tune is taken from the hymn &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; (), which was composed by Xhosa composer Enoch Sontonga, in 1897. The lyrics were composed after Zambian independence to specifically reflect Zambia, as opposed to Sontonga&#x27;s lyrics, which refer to Africa as a whole.

== History ==
&quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; started to become popular in South Africa in 1923 as a Christian hymn. It became a closing hymn for African National Congress (ANC) meetings and later became a symbolic song for black struggle against the Apartheid regime. Its popularity spread across Africa through churches, and the tune became associated with African nationalism movements across the continent, particularly in East and Southern Africa. Following the passing of the Zambia Independence Act 1964 in the Parliament of the United Kingdom, enacting Zambia&#x27;s independence from the United Kingdom, &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; was adopted as the national anthem of Zambia, replacing &quot;God Save the Queen&quot;, the anthem of Northern Rhodesia. In 1973, having used &quot;Nkosi Sikeleli Africa&quot; for over 9 years, it was decided that new lyrics set to the tune of &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; would be needed for Zambia&#x27;s national anthem. A national competition was held for the new words. However, none of the entries were deemed good enough to be used in full for the anthem. As a result, six of the entries were merged to create &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot;, and the entrants selected were awarded prizes. The authors credited for the composition were G. Ellis, E.S. Musonda, J.M.S. Lichilana, I. Lowe, J. Sajiwandani and R.J. Seal.

In September 1973, the National Assembly passed the National Anthem Act, which legally defined the English lyrics of &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot; as the national anthem of Zambia. The Act also made it an offence to &quot;insult or bring into contempt or ridicule&quot; the anthem and granted the President of Zambia the rights to prescribe how the anthem is sung and to restrict its use.

== Lyrics ==
On occasions requiring brevity, usually the first verse and chorus are sung.

===Criticism===
In 2005, Zambian women&#x27;s groups petitioned for a number of the lyrics in &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot; to be changed, because they felt that they were too male orientated. In response, it was decreed that the current lyrics did include women in context, and it was stated that &quot;Stand and Sing of Zambia, Proud and Free&quot; was &quot;composed of historical lyrics that reflect the country&#x27;s heritage and pride.&quot;

In 2012, Professor Michelo Hansungule repeated the concerns that the Zambian national anthem was too masculine. He also argued that because it had the same tune as the national anthem of South Africa, it might have intellectual property implications and suggested that Zambia&#x27;s sovereignty could be questioned.

<doc id="247888" wikidata="Q208016" url="?curid=247888" title="Tiến Quân Ca">
<text>&quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; (lit. &quot;The Song of the Marching Troops&quot;) is the national anthem of Vietnam. The march was written and composed by Văn Cao in 1944, and was adopted as the national anthem of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam in 1946 (as per the 1946 constitution) and subsequently the Socialist Republic of Vietnam in 1976 following the reunification of Vietnam. Though it has two verses, only the first one is usually sung.

==History==
Its lyrics and title were based on Văn Cao&#x27;s previous works, &quot;Thăng Long&quot; (lit. &quot;Rising Dragon&quot;, a former name of Hanoi). Part of the lyrics were also different during its early stages, as it went through numerous changes starting in the early 1940s.

===Lyric changes and completion===
&quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; went through many changes shortly after it was composed. For instance, the first sentence &quot;&quot;&quot; (&quot;The Vietnamese army marches&quot;) was originally &quot; (&quot;The Viet Minh army marches&quot;&quot;). The sixth part of the lyrics was also originally &quot; (&quot;We swear to tear apart the enemy and drink their blood&quot;), expressing his anger at the colonialists for letting two million Vietnamese people perish in the 1945 famine. After many suggestions, Văn Cao changed it to &quot; (&quot;For the people let&#x27;s struggle until the end&quot;). The last sentence &quot; (&quot;Together we shout onwards, our spirit is here&quot;) was changed to &quot; (&quot;Vietnam&#x27;s mountains and rivers shall withstand forever&quot;), but when it was published it was changed to &quot;&quot;, which had the same meaning but a slightly different tone, which Văn Cao commented,&quot;With a song that requires solemnity, &quot; seemed too weak while being sung with &quot; would be more reasonable.&quot;After completing the work, Văn Cao met and let Vũ Quý try out the song. Vũ Quý was very happy at his work, and &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; was published in the papers in November 1944 with lithographs by Văn Cao.

On 17 August, 1945, the song was sung for the first time at a rally of civil servants in Hanoi by a Ph.D under the flag of the Việt Minh, and &quot;robbed the loudspeakers&quot;. Văn Cao quoted, &quot;That quiet man was an attraction to thousands of people listening that day&quot;.

The poet and musician Nguyễn Đình Thi was touched after hearing Văn Cao sing the song and asked each person to write another song for &quot;The Viet Minh Frontline&quot;. He posted his own &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Kill the Fascists&quot;. Văn Cao wrote &quot;&quot;, meaning &quot;Vietnam Warriors&quot;. Both songs are still popular and sung to the public today.

===As a National Anthem===
On 17 August, 1945, Hồ Chí Minh approved &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; to be officially recognized as the anthem of the newly established Democratic Republic of Vietnam.

On 2 September, 1945, a parade was performed on the day of the Declaration of independence of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam at Ba Đình Square by the &quot;Liberation Army band&quot; commanded by Đinh Ngọc Liên. A day before, musicians Đinh Ngọc Liên, Nguyễn Hữu Hiếu, and Văn Cao discussed changing the two words in &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; in order to shorten the song by shortening the length of the first E pitches in the word &quot; and the F in the middle of the word &quot; to make the song more &quot;snappy&quot;.

In 1946, the first National Assembly officially recognized &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; as the national anthem. In Article 3 of the first Constitution of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam, it stated directly about the national anthem. In 1955, the 5th session of the first National Assembly decided to invite authors to participate in another editing of the song. Văn Cao had regrets after this because the &quot;heroic spirit&quot; of the song had been lost after being edited.

After the fall of the government of South Vietnam, and on 2 July, 1976, the Provisional Revolutionary Government of the Republic of South Vietnam and the Democratic Republic of Vietnam agreed to be reunified into the new Socialist Republic of Vietnam. &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; was chosen as the official National Anthem. In 1981, a contest was opened for a new national anthem but after more a year, it was and has never been mentioned again nor are there any official statement about the results. Thus, &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot; remains today as the national anthem of Vietnam.

== Official lyrics==
==Copyright==
===Copyright of the lyrics and the music sheet===
In 2010, Nghiêm Thúy Băng, the wife of late musician Văn Cao, addressed a letter to the Minister of Culture, Sports and Tourism of Vietnam proposing to donate the work &quot;Tiến quân ca&quot; into public domain. This was also the wish of Văn Cao.

However, in 2015, the family of Văn Cao, registered the song with the Vietnam Center for Protection of Music Copyright, demanding royalties for all public performances except in certain situations like schools and &quot;important state ceremonies&quot;. Văn Cao&#x27;s eldest son Văn Thao said that his family &quot;never reached consensus on &#x27;gifting&#x27; the song, so they authorized the center to collect royalties on his father&#x27;s songs&quot;.

The copyright announcement has angered many veteran musicians. Nguyễn Quang Long says the &quot;anthem must belong to the public, and people should be allowed to sing it without worrying about royalties&quot;. Singer Ánh Tuyết, who is best known for her performance of Cao&#x27;s songs, agrees that the anthem &quot;long ago became a song of the people, so it should be gifted to the people&quot;.

On 25 August 2015, the Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism sent an official letter to the music copyright agency to stop collecting royalties on &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot;.

On 8 July 2016, Văn Thao confirmed that he and his family were going to donate the song to the nation as his father&#x27;s last wish. A letter, signed by all the legal inheritors in the family, stated that the family would donate the song for free use.

On 15 July 2016, The National Assembly Office held a ceremony in Hanoi to receive the national anthem, donated by family members of Văn Cao, and to bestow the composer with the Ho Chi Minh Order. Also at the ceremony, Deputy Prime Minister Vũ Đức Đam presented a certificate of merit from the Prime Minister to Nghiêm Thúy Băng, the composer&#x27;s widow, in recognition of her efforts in preserving the composer&#x27;s works.

=== Copyright of different recording versions of the anthem ===
There are still disputes over the copyrights of each recording versions of the anthem, for example during the broadcasting the football match between Laos and Vietnam on 6 December 2021, the sound of anthem music was muted using the reason of copyrights. The copyright claims met with huge backlash from the author&#x27;s family, the government, and other opinions who considered national anthem should be free for all. Opposite opinions claimed that although the lyric and music sheet of the anthem is free, it is legal to claim the copyright of specific recording versions of the anthem.

The Government then announced a &quot;free&quot; recording version of the national anthem which had been already published on the government website and emphasized that &quot;Vietnamese laws strictly forbid the obstruction of popularizing the national anthem, directly or indirectly, under the regulation of rules and laws.&quot; The Department of Sports also issued an instruction called for the use of the &quot;free&quot; version published by the government. The &quot;free&quot; version was then used in subsequent sport events.

On 16 June 2022, the National Assembly of Vietnam passed the bill of &quot;Amendments to some Articles of the Law on Intellectual property&quot; related to &quot;Tiến Quân Ca&quot;, in which Clause 2, Article 7 of the law was added to be: &quot;The exercise of intellectual property rights must not infringe the interests of the State, the public interest or the legitimate rights and interests of other organizations and individuals, and must not breach other relevant provisions of law. Organizations and individuals exercising intellectual property rights related to the National Flag, National Emblem, National Anthem of the Socialist Republic of Vietnam must not obstruct their use and dissemination.&quot; The amendments were set to become effective on 1 January 2023.

<text>Otosclerosis is a condition of the middle ear where portions of the dense enchondral layer of the bony labyrinth remodel into one or more lesions of irregularly-laid spongy bone. As the lesions reach the stapes the bone is resorbed, then hardened (sclerotized), which limits its movement and results in hearing loss, tinnitus, vertigo or a combination of these. The term otosclerosis is something of a misnomer: much of the clinical course is characterized by lucent rather than sclerotic bony changes, so the disease is also known as otospongiosis.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;otosclerosis&quot; derives from Greek ὠτός (&quot;ōtos&quot;), genitive of οὖς (&quot;oûs&quot;) &quot;ear&quot; + σκλήρωσις (&quot;sklērōsis&quot;), &quot;hardening&quot;.

==Presentation==
The primary form of hearing loss in otosclerosis is conductive hearing loss (CHL) whereby sounds reach the ear drum but are incompletely transferred via the ossicular chain in the middle ear, and thus partly fail to reach the inner ear (cochlea). This can affect one ear or both ears. On audiometry, the hearing loss is characteristically low-frequency, with higher frequencies being affected later.

Sensorineural hearing loss (SNHL) has also been noted in patients with otosclerosis; this is usually a high-frequency loss, and usually manifests late in the disease. The causal link between otosclerosis and SNHL remains controversial. Over the past century, leading otologists and neurotologic researchers have argued whether the finding of SNHL late in the course of otosclerosis is due to otosclerosis or simply to typical presbycusis.

Most patients with otosclerosis notice tinnitus (head noise) to some degree. The amount of tinnitus is not necessarily related to the degree or type of hearing impairment. Tinnitus develops due to irritation of the delicate nerve endings in the inner ear. Since the nerve carries sound, this irritation is manifested as ringing, roaring or buzzing. It is usually worse when the patient is fatigued, nervous or in a quiet environment.

==Causes==
Otosclerosis can be caused by both genetic and environmental factors, such as a viral infection (like measles). Ribonucleic acid of the measles virus has been found in stapes footplate in most patients with otosclerosis. Populations that have been vaccinated against measles had a significant reduction in otosclerosis. While the disease is considered to be hereditary, its penetrance and the degree of expression is so highly variable that it may be difficult to detect an inheritance pattern. Most of the implicated genes are transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion. One genome-wide analysis associates otosclerosis with variation in the &quot;RELN&quot; gene.

Loci include:

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of otosclerosis is complex. The key lesions of otosclerosis are multifocal areas of sclerosis within the endochondral temporal bone. These lesions share some characteristics with Paget&#x27;s Disease, but they are not thought to be otherwise related. Histopathological studies have all been done on cadaveric temporal bones, so only inferences can be made about progression of the disease histologically. It seems that the lesions go through an active &quot;spongiotic&quot; or hypervascular phase before developing into &quot;sclerotic&quot; phase lesions. There have been many genes and proteins identified that, when mutated, may lead to these lesions. Also there is mounting evidence that measles virus is present within the otosclerotic foci, implicating an infectious etiology (this has also been noted in Paget&#x27;s Disease).

Conductive hearing loss (CHL) in otosclerosis is caused by two main sites of involvement of the sclerotic (or scar-like) lesions. The best understood mechanism is fixation of the stapes footplate to the oval window of the cochlea. This greatly impairs movement of the stapes and therefore transmission of sound into the inner ear (&quot;ossicular coupling&quot;). Additionally the cochlea&#x27;s round window can also become sclerotic, and in a similar way impair movement of sound pressure waves through the inner ear (&quot;acoustic coupling&quot;).

CHL is usually concomitant with impingement of abnormal bone on the stapes footplate. This involvement of the oval window forms the basis of the name fenestral otosclerosis. The most common location of involvement of otosclerosis is the bone just anterior to the oval window at a small cleft known as the fissula ante fenestram. The fissula is a thin fold of connective tissue extending through the endochondral layer, approximately between the oval window and the cochleariform process, where the tensor tympani tendon turns laterally toward the malleus.

The mechanism of sensorineural hearing loss in otosclerosis is less well understood. It may result
from direct injury to the cochlea and spiral ligament from the lytic process or from release of proteolytic enzymes into the cochlea. There are certainly a few well documented instances of sclerotic lesions directly obliterating sensory structures within the cochlea and spiral ligament, which have been photographed and reported post-mortem. Other supporting data includes a consistent loss of cochlear hair cells in patients with otosclerosis; these cells being the chief sensory organs of sound reception. A suggested mechanism for this is the release of hydrolytic enzymes into the inner ear structures by the spongiotic lesions.

==Diagnosis==
Otosclerosis is traditionally diagnosed by characteristic clinical findings, which include progressive conductive
hearing loss, a normal tympanic membrane, and no evidence of middle ear inflammation. The cochlear promontory may have a faint pink tinge reflecting the vascularity of the lesion, referred to as the Schwartz sign.

Approximately 0.5% of the population will eventually be diagnosed with otosclerosis. Post-mortem studies show that as many as 10% of people may have otosclerotic lesions of their temporal bone, but apparently never had symptoms warranting a diagnosis. Caucasians are the most affected race, with the prevalence in the Black and Asian populations being much lower. In clinical practice otosclerosis is encountered about twice as frequently in females as in males, but this does not reflect the true sex ratio. When families are investigated it is found that the condition is only slightly more common in women. Usually noticeable hearing loss begins at middle-age, but can start much sooner. The hearing loss was long believed to grow worse during pregnancy, but recent research does not support this belief.

===Differential testing===

===Audiometry===
Fixation of the stapes within the oval window causes a conductive hearing loss. In pure-tone audiometry, this manifests as air-bone gaps on the audiogram (i.e. a difference of more than 10 dB between the air-conduction and bone-conduction thresholds at a given test frequency). However, medial fixation of the ossicular chain impairs both the inertial and osseotympanic modes of bone conduction, increasing the bone-conduction thresholds between 500 Hz and 4 kHz, and reducing the size of air-bone gaps. As 2 kHz is the resonant frequency of the ossicular chain, the largest increase in bone-conduction threshold (around 15 dB) occurs at this frequency – the resultant notch is called &quot;Carhart&#x27;s notch&quot; and is a useful clinical marker for medial ossicular-chain fixation.

Tympanometry measures the peak pressure (TPP) and peak-compensated static admittance (&quot;Y&quot;tm) of the middle ear at the eardrum. As the stapes is ankylosed in otosclerosis, the lateral end of the ossicular chain may still be quite mobile. Therefore, otosclerosis may only slightly reduce the admittance, resulting in either a shallow tympanogram (type AS), or a normal tympanogram (type A). Otosclerosis increases the stiffness of the middle-ear system, raising its resonant frequency. This can be quantified using multi-frequency tympanometry. Thus, a high resonant-frequency pathology such as otosclerosis can be differentiated from low resonant-frequency pathologies such as ossicular discontinuity.

In the absence of a pathology, a loud sound (generally greater than 70 dB above threshold) causes the stapedius muscle to contract, reducing the admittance of the middle ear and softening the perceived loudness of the sound. If the mobility of the stapes is reduced due to otosclerosis, then stapedius muscle contraction does not significantly decrease the admittance. When acoustic reflex testing is conducted, the acoustic reflex thresholds (ART) cannot be determined when attempting to measure on the affected side. Also, a conductive pathology will attenuate the test stimuli, resulting in either elevated reflex thresholds or absent reflexes when the stimulus is presented in the affected ear and measured in the other ear.

===CT imaging===
Imaging is usually not pursued in those with uncomplicated conductive hearing loss and characteristic clinical findings. Those with only conductive hearing loss are often treated medically or with surgery without imaging. The diagnosis may be unclear clinically in cases of sensorineural or mixed hearing loss and may become apparent only on imaging. Therefore, imaging is often performed when the hearing loss is sensorineural or mixed.

A high-resolution CT shows very subtle bone findings. However, CT is usually not needed prior to surgery.

Otosclerosis on CT can be graded using the grading system suggested by Symons and Fanning.
* Grade 1, solely fenestral;
* Grade 2, patchy localized cochlear disease (with or without fenestral involvement) to either the basal cochlear turn (grade 2A), or the middle/apical turns (grade 2B), or both the basal turn and the middle/apical turns (grade 2C); and
* Grade 3, diffuse confluent cochlear involvement (with or without fenestral involvement).

==Treatment==


Several approaches have been used in the treatment of otosclerosis, including medical, surgical and amplification. Technological innovations in hearing aid technology and cochlear implants are now being used to substitute or complement other interventions.

===Medical===
Earlier workers suggested the use of calcium fluoride; now sodium fluoride is the preferred compound. Fluoride ions inhibit the rapid progression of disease. In the otosclerotic ear, there occurs formation of hydroxylapatite crystals which lead to stapes (or other) fixation. The administration of fluoride replaces the hydroxyl radical with fluoride leading to the formation of fluorapatite crystals. Hence, the progression of disease is considerably slowed down and active disease process is arrested.
This treatment cannot reverse conductive hearing loss, but may slow the progression of both the conductive and sensorineural components of the disease process. Otofluor, containing sodium fluoride, is one treatment. Recently, some success has been claimed with a second such treatment, bisphosphonate medications that inhibit bone destruction. However, these early reports are based on non-randomized case studies that do not meet standards of clinical trials. There are numerous side-effects to both pharmaceutical treatments, including occasional stomach upset, allergic itching, and increased joint pains which can lead to arthritis. In the worst case, bisphosphonates may lead to osteonecrosis of the auditory canal itself. Finally, neither approach has been proven to be beneficial after the commonly preferred method of surgery has been undertaken.

===Surgical===
There are various methods to treat otosclerosis. However the method of choice is a procedure known as stapedectomy. Early attempts at hearing restoration via the simple freeing of the stapes from its sclerotic attachments to the oval window were met with temporary improvement in hearing, but the conductive hearing loss would almost always recur. A stapedectomy consists of removing a portion of the sclerotic stapes footplate and replacing it with a middle ear implant that is secured to the incus. This procedure restores continuity of ossicular movement and allows transmission of sound waves from the eardrum to the inner ear. A modern variant of this surgery called a stapedotomy, is performed by drilling a small hole in the stapes footplate with a micro-drill or a laser, and the insertion of a piston-like prothesis. The success rate of either surgery depends greatly on the skill and the familiarity with the procedure of the surgeon. However, comparisons have shown stapedotomy to yield results at least as good as stapedectomy, with fewer complications, and thus stapedotomy is preferred in normal circumstances. Recently, Endoscopic stapedotomy has been gaining popularity since its first description by Professor Tarabichi in 1999. The endsocope provides much better view of the stapes footplate without removal of bone to access that structure.

=== Amplification ===
Although hearing aids cannot prevent, cure or inhibit the progression of otosclerosis, they can help treat the largest symptom, hearing loss. Hearing aids can be tuned to specific frequency losses. However, due to the progressive nature of this condition, use of a hearing aid is palliative at best. Without eventual surgery, deafness is likely to result.

==Society and culture==

===Notable cases===
* German composer Ludwig van Beethoven was theorized to suffer from otosclerosis, although this is controversial.
* Victorian journalist Harriet Martineau gradually lost her hearing during her young life, and later medical historians have diagnosed her with probably suffering from otosclerosis as well.
* Theresa Goell, pioneering American archaeologist, lost her hearing due to otosclerosis and relied on lip reading. She had a successful career excavating Mount Nemrut in Turkey, despite the challenges of being a deaf woman in a heavily male-dominated field.
* Margaret Sullavan, American stage and film actress, suffered from the congenital hearing defect otosclerosis that worsened as she aged, making her more and more hard of hearing.
* Howard Hughes the pioneering American aviator, engineer, industrialist, and film producer also suffered from otosclerosis.
* Frankie Valli, lead singer of The Four Seasons, suffered from it in the late 1960s and early 1970s, forcing him to &quot;sing from memory&quot; in the latter part of the 70s (surgery restored most of his hearing by 1980).
* Pittsburgh Penguins forward Steve Downie suffers from otosclerosis.
* The British queen Alexandra of Denmark suffered from it, leading to her social isolation; Queen Alexandra&#x27;s biographer, Georgina Battiscombe, was able to have &quot;some understanding of Alexandra&#x27;s predicament&quot; because she too had otosclerosis.
* Adam Savage, co-host of &quot;MythBusters&quot;, uses a hearing aid due to otosclerosis.
* Sir John Cornforth, Australian-British Nobel Prize in Chemistry laureate
*Zak Abel, English singer-songwriter and musician

<text>&quot;&quot; (; ) is the national anthem of Venezuela. Its lyrics were written by physician and journalist Vicente Salias in 1810, set to music later composed by musician Juan José Landaeta. Owing to musical similarities with the French national anthem, beginning in 1840 &quot; was known as &quot; (&#x27;The Venezuelan Marseillaise&#x27;). It was declared Venezuela&#x27;s national anthem by decree of President Antonio Guzmán Blanco on May 25, 1881.

Recent investigations have suggested that the real author of the anthem was Andrés Bello – and not Salias – to whom it was originally credited, and the music was composed by another musician called Lino Gallardo. However, this theory has yet to be proven, and lacks any real recognition among the general Venezuelan population, historians, or otherwise.

== History ==

The Patriotic Society was formed in Caracas as a result of the Revolution of April 19, 1810, One of its meetings, Existed by the Success of Its Patriotic Song, Caraqueños, Otra Época Inicia. Composed by Cayetano Carreño and Lyrics by Andrés Bello, suggested that the proposal for the Society was also launch a Patriotic March that stimulated the mood for the undecided. On April 18, 1868, newspaper &quot;El Federalista&quot; published the official lyrics written by Salias, which commemorated the 58th Anniversary of Independence the day before in the capital, mentioned that &quot;in the halls of the University and in the presence of large public, before the speeches, a «martial music» performed several pieces, among them the National Anthem &quot;.

Commissioned by President Antonio Guzmán Blanco, Dr. Eduardo Calcaño, a valuable composer and musician, adequately fulfilled the task of fixing the musical text of the Anthem, which he did while preserving the martial brilliance of the melody, without attempting to alter it or give it another expression.

On May 25, 1881, the Gloria al Bravo Pueblo was definitively consecrated as the National Anthem of Venezuela, by means of a decree issued by the then President, Antonio Guzmán Blanco. After this decree and the publications of the National Anthem that were made in 1883 , a new official edition was produced in 1911 to commemorate the centenary of independence, which was entrusted to Salvador Llamozas. In 1947 the current structure of the musical and lyricial ambiance was overhauled by composer Juan Bautista Plaza.

=== Disputed composition ===
However, this theory has not been fully proven; although the truth is that both Juan José Landaeta and Lino Gallardo belonged to the &quot;School of Music of Caracas&quot;, the central activity of the &quot;Archdiocesan Oratory of Caracas&quot;, founded by Pedro Palacios y Sojo.

It was thus that one of the members of the Patriotic Society, poet Vicente Salias, improvised there the first verses of the National Anthem on it was originally written around 1810 as a patriotic hymn. Later official modifications have been written by Eduardo Calcaño (1881), Salvador Llamozas (1911) and Juan Bautista Plaza (1947).

== Lyrics ==

== Regulations and usage ==
The official broadcast of the national anthem is played on all radio stations, national and regional television networks every day of the week at 12:00 am and 6:00 am (sometimes on 12:00 pm during National Holidays) mandatorily accorded by the law passed in 1954 (either the full version or the chorus, first stanza and chorus).

On radio broadcasts in some of the regional radio stations, the state anthem is played after the national anthem, which is also the case for state TV stations.

In most occasions, only the chorus, first stanza and the chorus are played, or even the chorus itself. Sometimes the chorus is played twice in the beginning, and once in the rest of the anthem. In formal events (if the anthem will be played by either a military band, concert band or orchestra) the format is: chorus (2x), first verse and chorus (2x), with the optional introduction. If played in full the chorus is sung twice, with or without the introductory notes.

<text>Aila Johanna Sinisalo is a Finnish science fiction and fantasy writer. She studied comparative literature and drama, amongst other subjects, at the University of Tampere. Professionally she worked in the advertising business, rising to the level of marketing designer.

An important figure in the Finnish science fiction scene in the late 1980s and early &#x27;90s (winning a rare back-to-back collection of Atorox Awards for short fiction in the genre), she was also the first Finnish science fiction writer to make a mainstream breakthrough by breaking genre barriers.

==Fiction==
Sinisalo was awarded the Finlandia Prize for literature in 2000 for her first novel, &quot;Ennen päivänlaskua ei voi&quot; (translated as &quot;Not Before Sundown&quot; in 2003 and again as &quot;Troll — A Love Story&quot; in 2004 for the American market). The novel has been translated into several languages. Movie rights were acquired by Carter Smith in 2006.

An English translation of &quot;Linnunaivot&quot; was published in 2010 by Peter Owen Publishers under the title &quot;Birdbrain&quot; (translated by David Hackston).

She has named the 1967 novel &quot;Friday, or, The Other Island&quot; by French writer Michel Tournier as a major influence on her career.

==Screenwriting==

She is also the screenwriter of Energia Productions &quot;Iron Sky&quot; movie, a sci-fi comedy set in 2018.

==Awards==
*Sinisalo was awarded the Finlandia Prize for literature in 2000 for &quot;Ennen päivänlaskua ei voi&quot; (&quot;Not Before Sundown&quot;, also known as &quot;Troll — A Love Story&quot;). The novel was also awarded The James Tiptree Jr. award in 2004.

<text>The &quot;Pontifical Anthem and March&quot; (; ), also known as the &quot;Papal Anthem&quot;, is the anthem played to mark the presence of the Pope or one of his representatives, such as a nuncio, and on other solemn occasions. When the Vatican&#x27;s flag is ceremonially raised, only the first eight bars are played.

While the Papal Anthem also serves as the national anthem of the Holy See and the Vatican City State, the Vatican stresses that it &quot;is not to be understood as a national anthem&quot;; it is a composition whose words and music &quot;speak to the heart of many throughout the world who see in Rome the See of Peter.&quot;

==History==
The music was composed in 1869 by Charles Gounod, for the celebration on 11 April 1869 of Pope Pius IX&#x27;s golden jubilee of priestly ordination. The purely instrumental piece in three parts, originally called &quot;Marche pontificale&quot; (French for &quot;Pontifical March&quot;), became extremely popular from its first performance. It was first performed that day at four o&#x27;clock in the afternoon with seven pontifical bands and a chorus of over one thousand soldiers.

On 16 October 1949, Pope Pius XII declared it the papal anthem, replacing Viktorin Hallmayer&#x27;s &quot;Marcia trionfale&quot; (1857), which, being still the papal anthem when the Vatican City State was founded in 1929, had been treated also as the new state&#x27;s anthem. Gounod&#x27;s &quot;Marche Pontificale&quot; was first performed in this new role during a ceremony on Christmas Eve of 1949, one day before the opening of the Holy Year 1950. The old state anthem too was played for a last time, almost as a token of respect.

At that time, Antonio Allegra (1905–1969), who was then one of the organists of St. Peter&#x27;s Basilica, wrote Italian lyrics for Gounod&#x27;s music. Other lyrics have been composed for the music in various languages and by different authors. In 1991, Raffaello Lavagna of Savona (1918–2015) wrote Latin lyrics for a four-voice choir, on an arrangement by Alberico Vitalini.

<text>Gene Myron Amdahl (November 16, 1922 – November 10, 2015) was an American computer architect and high-tech entrepreneur, chiefly known for his work on mainframe computers at IBM and later his own companies, especially Amdahl Corporation. He formulated Amdahl&#x27;s law, which states a fundamental limitation of parallel computing.

==Childhood and education==
Amdahl was born to immigrant parents of Norwegian and Swedish descent in Flandreau, South Dakota. After serving in the Navy during World War II he completed a degree in engineering physics at South Dakota State University in 1948.

He went on to study theoretical physics at the University of Wisconsin–Madison under Robert G. Sachs. However, in 1950, Amdahl and Charles H. &quot;Charlie&quot; Davidson, a fellow PhD student in the Department of Physics, approached Prof. Harold A. Peterson with the idea of a digital computer. Amdahl and Davidson gained the support of Peterson and fellow electrical engineering professor Vincent C. Rideout, who encouraged them to build a computer of their unique design. Amdahl completed his doctorate at UW–Madison in 1952 with a thesis titled &quot;A Logical Design of an Intermediate Speed Digital Computer&quot; and created his first computer, the Wisconsin Integrally Synchronized Computer (WISC). He then went straight from Wisconsin to a position at IBM in June 1952.

==IBM==
At IBM, Amdahl worked on the IBM 704, the IBM 709, and then the &quot;Stretch&quot; project, the basis for the IBM 7030. He left IBM in December 1955, but returned in September 1960 (after working at Ramo-Wooldridge and at Aeronutronic). He quit out of frustration with the bureaucratic structure of the organization. In an interview conducted in 1989 for the Charles Babbage Institute, he addressed this:
On his return, he became the chief architect of IBM System/360 and was named an IBM Fellow in 1965, and head of the Advanced Computing Systems Laboratory (ACS) in Menlo Park, California.

== Amdahl Corporation ==
He left IBM again in September 1970, after his ideas for computer development were rejected, and set up Amdahl Corporation in Sunnyvale, California with major financing from Fujitsu.

Competing with IBM in the mainframe market, the company manufactured &quot;plug-compatible&quot; mainframes, shipping its first machine in 1975 – the Amdahl 470V/6, a less expensive, more reliable and faster replacement for the System 370/168. By purchasing an Amdahl 470 and plug-compatible peripheral devices from third-party manufacturers, customers could now run S/360 and S/370 applications without buying actual IBM hardware. Amdahl&#x27;s software team developed VM/PE (Virtual Machine/Performance Enhancement), software designed to optimize the performance of IBM&#x27;s MVS operating system when running under IBM&#x27;s VM operating system.

By 1979, Amdahl Corporation had sold over US$1 billion of V6 and V7 mainframes and had over 6,000 employees worldwide. The corporation went on to distribute an IBM-plug-compatible front-end processor (the 4705) as well as high-performance disk drives, both jointly developed with Fujitsu engineers.

At the 1967 Spring Joint Computer Conference, Amdahl, along with three other computer architects, most notably ILLIAC IV architect Daniel Slotnick, engaged in a discussion on future architectural trends. Amdahl articulated his arguments, both orally and in three written pages, on the fundamental physical limitations that he theorized would govern the performance of any special feature or mode introduced to new machines. This set of arguments resulted in two, major and lesser, &quot;laws&quot; of computer performance regarding sequential versus parallel processing. These arguments continue to this day.

==1979–2015: Entrepreneur==
Amdahl left his eponymous company in August 1979 to set up Trilogy Systems, together with his son Carl, and Clifford Madden. With over US$200 million in funds, Trilogy was aimed at designing a wafer-scale microprocessor for even cheaper mainframes, but the chip development failed within months of the company&#x27;s $60 million public offering; thereafter, the company focused on developing its VLSI technology and, when that project failed, in 1985, Trilogy merged into Elxsi, a computer maker with its own CPU design. Elxsi also did poorly and Amdahl left in 1989, having already founded his next venture, Andor International, in 1987. Andor hoped to compete in the mid-sized mainframe market, using improved manufacturing techniques developed by one of the company&#x27;s employees, Robert F. Brown, to make smaller, more efficient machines. Production problems and strong competition led the company into bankruptcy by 1995.

Amdahl co-founded Commercial Data Servers in 1996, again in Sunnyvale, and again developing mainframe-like machines but this time with new super-cooled processor designs and aimed at physically smaller systems. One such machine, from 1997, was the ESP/490 (Enterprise Server Platform/490), an enhancement of IBM&#x27;s P/390 of the System/390 family. Since then, CDS has changed its name and narrowed its focus. As Xbridge Systems, the company now builds software to scan mainframe datasets and database tables for sensitive information such as credit card numbers, social security and other government identification numbers, sensitive medical diagnosis information that can be linked to an individual, and other information such as that needed for electronic discovery.

In November 2004, Amdahl was appointed to the board of advisors of Massively Parallel Technologies.

He died on November 10, 2015, in Palo Alto, California, from pneumonia, six days shy of his 93rd birthday. He also had Alzheimer&#x27;s disease in the last years of his life.


==Awards and recognition==
Amdahl was named an IBM Fellow in 1965, became a member of the National Academy of Engineering in 1967 and was recognized as the Centennial Alumnus of South Dakota State University in 1986. He has numerous awards and patents to his credit and has received Honorary Doctorates from his two alma maters and two other institutions as well.

Amdahl was elected Distinguished Fellow of the British Computer Society (DFBCS) in 1979, and in 1983 he was awarded the Harry H. Goode Memorial Award by the IEEE Computer Society &quot;in recognition of his outstanding contributions to the design, applications and manufacture of large-scale high-performance computers.&quot;

In 1998, he was made a Fellow of the Computer History Museum &quot;for his fundamental work in computer architecture and design, project management, and leadership.&quot;

In November 2007, Amdahl was recognized with the SIGDA Pioneering Achievement Award. A banquet dinner in his honor featured a short talk by Amdahl on his career, and a panel debate on the future of parallel processing. Panelists included John Gustafson (known for Gustafson&#x27;s law). The talk and debate were both videotaped, and are available through the SIGDA Web page, and the ACM Digital Library.

<text>The State Anthem of Ukraine, also known by its incipit &quot;&#x27;&quot; and its original title &quot;&#x27;&quot;, is one of the state symbols of Ukraine.

The lyrics are a slightly modified version of the first verse and chorus of the patriotic song &quot;, written in 1862 by Pavlo Chubynskyi, an ethnographer from Kyiv. In 1863, Mykhailo Verbytskyi, a composer and Catholic priest, composed the music to accompany Chubynskyi&#x27;s lyrics. The first choral public performance of the piece was in 1864 at the Ruska Besida Theatre in Lviv.

In the first half of the 20th century, during unsuccessful attempts to gain independence and create a state from the territories of the Russian Empire, Poland, and Austria-Hungary, the song was the national anthem of the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, the West Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic, and Carpatho-Ukraine. A competition was held for a national anthem following Ukraine&#x27;s secession from the Soviet Union, with one of the songs being &quot; by the Ukrainian writer and actor Mykola Voronyi. &quot;&quot; was officially adopted by the Verkhovna Rada—Ukraine&#x27;s parliament—on 15 January 1992. The official lyrics were adopted on 6 March 2003 by the Law on the State anthem of Ukraine ().





== History ==
=== Background ===

The Ukrainian national anthem can be traced back to one of the parties of the Ukrainian ethnographer Pavlo Chubynskyi that occurred during the autumn of 1862. Scholars think that the Polish patriotic song &quot;Poland Is Not Yet Lost&quot;, which dates back to 1797 and later became the national anthem of Poland and the Polish Legions, also influenced Chubynskyi&#x27;s lyrics. The Polish patriotic song was popular among the nations of the former Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth that were at that time fighting for their independence; the January Uprising started a few months after Chubynskyi wrote his lyrics. According to a memoirist who was present, Chubynskyi wrote the lyrics spontaneously after listening to Serbian students singing Svetozar Miletić&#x27;s &quot;&quot; () during a gathering of Serbian and Ukrainian students in an apartment in Kyiv.

Chubynskyi&#x27;s words were rapidly taken up by the earliest Ukrainophiles. In 1862, the head gendarme, Prince Vasily Dolgorukov, exiled Chubynskyi to Arkhangelsk Governorate for the &quot;dangerous influence on the minds of commoners&quot;.

The poem was first officially published in 1863 when it appeared in the fourth issue of the Lviv-based journal ; the journal mistakenly attributed the poem to Taras Shevchenko. It became popular in the territories that now form part of Western Ukraine and came to the attention of a member of the Ukrainian clergy, Mykhailo Verbytskyi of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church. Inspired by Chubynskyi&#x27;s lyrics, Verbytskyi, then a prominent composer in Ukraine, decided to set it to music. The lyrics were first published with Verbytskyi&#x27;s sheet music in 1865. The first choral public performance of the piece was in 1864 at the Ruska Besida Theatre in Lviv.

One of the first recordings of this anthem (then spelled &quot;&quot;) in Ukrainian was released on a gramophone record by Columbia Phonograph Company during World War I in 1916. As a folk song, it was performed by a Ukrainian emigrant from Lviv and New York resident Mykhailo Zazuliak in 1915.

=== Early use ===
&quot;Shche ne vmerla Ukraina&quot; was not used as a state anthem until 1917 when it was adopted by the Ukrainian People&#x27;s Republic as its national anthem. Still, even between 1917 and 1921, the song was not legislatively adopted as an exclusive state anthem as other anthems were also used at the time.

=== During the Soviet period ===

In 1922, the Ukrainian SSR signed the Treaty on the Creation of the USSR with the Russian SFSR, Transcaucasian SFSR, and Byelorussian SSR, which created the Soviet Union. Following the signing of the treaty, &quot; was banned by the Soviet regime. The authorities later decided that each separate Soviet republic could have its anthem, but &quot; was rejected in an attempt to help to suppress separatist sentiments held by Ukrainian nationalists. In 1939, &quot;&quot; was adopted as the official state anthem of Carpatho-Ukraine.

After Joseph Stalin ordered that &quot;The Internationale&quot; be replaced with the State Anthem of the Soviet Union in 1944, all the constituent republics of the union were forced to produce each of their representative regional anthem as well. The Ukrainian government established a commission on the anthem on 23 February 1944. Soviet authorities, after a period of struggle, successfully persuaded public intellectuals to create an anthem with lyrics fitting their political interests and music sterile of any Ukrainian national elements. On 23 February, the Ukrainian chairman Mykhailo Hrechukha started a meeting by reading a synopsis of the anthem-to-be in front of musicians and litterateurs: the Ukrainian nation&#x27;s union with the Soviets were envisaged for the first stanza; the Ukrainian people, their struggles, and &quot;freedom&quot; under Lenin and Stalin were envisaged for the second stanza; Ukraine&#x27;s economic and political &quot;flourishing&quot; in the union were envisaged for the third stanza. The refrain was conceived to be used after each stanza, which was considered as a paean to the union of the Soviet peoples and the reunited Ukraine following the Soviet annexation of Eastern Galicia and Volhynia.

Composers worked on the score before the decision on the lyrics; by February 1945, 11 composers were selected as finalists. Anton Lebedynets&#x27; score won with an overwhelming majority vote, and the score was adopted as the music of the new Soviet anthem in November 1949. Earlier in January 1948, the lyrics of Pavlo Tychyna and co-author Mykola Bazhan won; due to plagiarism of his text, Oleksa Novytskyi demanded to be listed as a co-author, but to no avail. On 21 November 1949, the new anthem of the Ukrainian Soviet Socialist Republic was adopted. Borys Yarovynskyi edited and reorchestrated the anthem in 1979.

=== Post-independence ===
On 15 January 1992, &quot; was adopted by the Ukrainian Parliament, as the state anthem and was later instituted in the Ukrainian Constitution. However, the lyrics for the anthem were not officially adopted until 6 March 2003, when the Verkhovna Rada passed a law on the state anthem of Ukraine (), proposed by then-president Leonid Kuchma. The law proposed Mykhailo Verbytskyi&#x27;s music and Pavlo Chubynskyi&#x27;s first stanza and refrain of his poem &quot;. However, the first line of the lyrics was to be changed from to . The law was passed with an overwhelming majority of 334 votes out of 450, with only 46 MPs opposing. Only the members of the Socialist Party of Ukraine and the Communist Party of Ukraine refrained from voting. The national anthem that up until then had only officially consisted of Mykhailo Verbytskyi&#x27;s music, would henceforth also include the modified lyrics of Pavlo Chubynskyi.

The popularity of the Ukrainian anthem has become particularly high in the wake of the Orange Revolution protests of 2004 and Euromaidan of 2013. Ukrainian composer Valentyn Sylvestrov, who participated in Ukrainian protests in Kyiv, characterized the Ukrainian anthem thus:

==== Since Euromaidan and the Russo-Ukrainian War====
During the Euromaidan protests of 2013, the anthem became a revolutionary song for the protesters. In the early weeks of the protests, they sang the national anthem once an hour, led by singer Ruslana. In &quot;World Affairs&quot;, Nadia Diuk argues that the national anthem was used as &quot;the clarion call of the &#x27;revolution&#x27;&quot; during Euromaidan, which added weight to protests that previous ones, such as the Orange Revolution, lacked. In a 2014 survey, after being asked &quot;How has your attitude toward the following changed for the last year?&quot;, the Kyiv International Institute of Sociology found that the attitude towards the Ukrainian national anthem had &quot;improved a lot&quot; in 25.3% of Ukrainians, especially after the start of the Russo-Ukrainian War.

After the start of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, several orchestras in Europe and North America performed the Ukrainian national anthem in order to show their solidarity with Ukraine.

== Lyrics ==
The incipit &quot;&quot; reminds Ukrainians about their struggle for national self-identity and independence. It was sung as the &quot;de facto&quot; national anthem at the inauguration of Leonid Kravchuk, the first Ukrainian president, on 5 December 1991, but it was not until 6 March 2003 that Chubynskyi&#x27;s lyrics officially became a part of the national anthem. The Constitution of Ukraine designated Verbytskyi&#x27;s music for the national anthem on 28 June 1996:

On 6 March 2003, the Parliament of Ukraine officially adopted the anthem&#x27;s lyrics, opting to use only the first stanza and refrain from Chubynskyi&#x27;s original poem, while slightly modifying the first stanza.

===Current official lyrics===

===Full modern lyrics===
The first verse and chorus of the following lyrics constitute a more popular (commonly performed) version of the anthem. Differences from the official lyrics are italicized.


===Original lyrics (1862)===
The first stanza of Chubynskyi&#x27;s original poem is somewhat similar to the first stanza of national anthems of Poland and Yugoslavia and &quot;Hatikvah&quot;, the national anthem of Israel.


== Adaptations ==
The song &quot;&quot;, written as a &quot;song of resistance&quot; during the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, is inspired by the opening motif of the Ukrainian national anthem.

<doc id="247904" wikidata="Q639642" url="?curid=247904" title="HMS Endurance (A171)">
<text>HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; was an icebreaker that served as the Royal Navy ice patrol ship between 1991 and 2008. Built in Norway as MV &quot;Polar Circle&quot;, she was chartered by the Royal Navy in 1991 as HMS &quot;Polar Circle&quot;, before being purchased outright and renamed HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; in 1992 as a replacement for the previous HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; whose hull had been weakened by striking an iceberg.

&quot;Endurance&quot; was a class 1 icebreaker. Her two Bergen BRG8 diesel engines produced over 8000 shaft horsepower enabling her to travel through ice up to thick at . Her propulsion system used a computer-controlled variable-pitch propeller and stern and bow thrusters. She carried two ice-modified Lynx helicopters which were instrumental in the making of the BBC Documentary Series &quot;Planet Earth&quot; in 2006.

The ship was laid up in Portsmouth from 2009 to 2016, following serious damage caused by flooding following an error during routine maintenance on a sea suction strainer. In October 2013 it was reported that she would be scrapped; in July 2015 the vessel was offered for sale for further use or recycling and left Portsmouth under tow to the Leyal ship recycling facility in Turkey on 1 June 2016.

==Career==
MV &quot;Polar Circle&quot; was built in Norway in 1990 by Ulstein Hatlo for Rieber Shipping. The Royal Navy chartered her for eight months as HMS &quot;Polar Circle&quot; from 21 November 1991. She was bought outright and renamed HMS &quot;Endurance&quot; on 9 October 1992.

&quot;Endurance&quot; provided a sovereign presence in polar waters, performing hydrographic surveys and supporting the British Antarctic Survey in Antarctica. Her usual deployment saw her in the Southern Ocean and returning to the UK through tropical waters each year. Later, a longer, 18-month deployment was designed to maximise her time available for BAS usage.

In 1997, &quot;Endurance&quot; made the first visit to Argentina by a Royal Naval vessel since the Falklands War, calling at the capital, Buenos Aires, &quot;en route&quot; to her Antarctic deployment. That she was seen as a scientific and research vessel rather than a warship facilitated the visit and helped to normalise relations between Argentina and the United Kingdom. She visited the Argentinian port of Mar del Plata in 1998 and returned to Buenos Aires in 2002.

In 2005, &quot;Endurance&quot; was chosen to carry the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the International Fleet Review as part of the Trafalgar 200 celebrations.

In July 2007, the United Kingdom offered &quot;Endurance&quot; to supply Argentina&#x27;s Antarctic bases after their icebreaker suffered extensive damage in a fire.

Although she enjoyed a varied, purposeful career as the UK&#x27;s sole ice patrol vessel, &quot;Endurance&quot;″s later years were problematic and ended in ignominy. After her 2004 docking period in Falmouth, the ship suffered a minor accident which resulted in her listing badly when the drydock she was situated in flooded up. The months after the refit were troublesome and the ship suffered numerous debilitating machinery failures. This was to become something of a theme over the next four years as the ship&#x27;s crew struggled to keep her serviceable, set against more demanding challenges.

===Docking in Puerto Belgrano 2006===
During survey work in Antarctica in January 2006, the ship&#x27;s engineering staff discovered that her rudder was apparently loose on the stock. Her work period was cut short and she returned to Mare Harbour in the Falkland Islands for further inspections. Det Norske Veritas, the ship&#x27;s assurance certification company, instructed that the ship should dock at the nearest available port – the nearest large enough being Puerto Belgrano, Argentina&#x27;s largest naval base, where &quot;Endurance&quot; docked in mid-March 2006.

Without hotel services on board, the ship&#x27;s company moved to shore-side accommodation in the city of Bahía Blanca, some twenty kilometres west of Puerto Belgrano. The rudder was removed for repairs, and once it was on the floor of the drydock, a dockers&#x27; strike followed. The ship remained there for nearly three weeks. Picket lines formed at the gates of the naval base, preventing the ship&#x27;s company from relieving the stranded duty watch on board.

When the strike broke, the rudder was replaced and welded into position and the ship left Puerto Belgrano in early April 2006. She returned to Portsmouth via Lisbon and to drydock again for further engineering work on the rudder and stock.

===2008 near loss===
In December 2008, while on an 18-month deployment, &quot;Endurance&quot; suffered extensive flooding to her machinery spaces and lower accommodation decks resulting in the near loss of the ship. A serious engine room flood left her without power or propulsion, and she was towed to Punta Arenas by a Chilean tug. After an extensive survey was completed, the estimates to refit the ship were put at around £30m. On 8 April 2009 &quot;Endurance&quot; arrived off Portsmouth, on the semi-submersible transporter ship .

The Royal Navy inquiry found that the flood happened while a sea-water strainer was being cleaned, in an attempt to improve the production of fresh water. The air lines controlling a hull valve were incorrectly reconnected, resulting in the valve opening and an inability to close it. The pipe installation fell below generally accepted standards, which made reconnection of the air lines ambiguous.

The inquiry also found that, due to manpower constraints, the ship did not have a system maintainer and that clarity of engineering command had been lost, with no-one clearly in charge of risk-management. It was fortunate that, without propulsion, &quot;Endurance&quot; had drifted over an area shallow enough for anchors to be let go and to hold the ship in position, otherwise, &quot;there was a very real possibility that she would have been lost either by running ashore or by succumbing to the flood.&quot; The inquiry judged that the ship&#x27;s company responded well to control damage in challenging conditions.

===&quot;Ice Patrol&quot; (TV series)===
In 2009, National Geographic Channel ran a four-episode documentary series on &quot;Endurance&quot;. Five ran the same series the following year under the name &quot;Ice Patrol&quot;, with the final episode showing what happened the day the ship almost sank.

===Replacement===
On 9 September 2010, speculation in the press suggested it was likely that &quot;Endurance&quot; would be scrapped and replaced with another icebreaker from Norway.

On 22 March 2011, it was announced that the Royal Navy intended to hire MV &quot;Polarbjørn&quot;, to be renamed , for three years whilst a final decision on whether to repair or scrap &quot;Endurance&quot; is made. was purchased in September 2013.

It was announced on 7 October 2013 that &quot;Endurance&quot; would be sold for scrap, as it was not &#x27;economically viable&#x27; to repair the damage sustained in 2008. In July 2015 the Ministry of Defence gave advanced notice of sale of the vessel for further use or recycling, noting that &quot;parties interested in acquiring the vessel for future use should note it will require considerable investment&quot;. The vessel left Portsmouth under tow to the breakers&#x27; yard in Turkey on 1 June 2016.

==Link to Sir Ernest Shackleton==
&quot;Endurance&quot; was named after the ship which Sir Ernest Shackleton used in his Antarctic expedition of 1914–1917. The names of &quot;Endurance&quot;″s boats and landing craft continued the Shackleton connection: &quot;James Caird&quot; and &quot;Dudley Docker&quot; were named after boats carried by Shackleton&#x27;s &quot;Endurance&quot;, &quot;Nimrod&quot; was named after the ship which Shackleton used on his Antarctic expedition of 1907–1909, and &quot;Eddie Shackleton&quot; was named after the explorer&#x27;s son. The motto of &quot;Endurance&quot;, &quot;fortitudine vincimus&quot; (&quot;by endurance, we conquer&quot;), was also the Shackleton family motto.

<doc id="247908" wikidata="Q1933919" url="?curid=247908" title="Microcosm–macrocosm analogy">
<text>The microcosm–macrocosm analogy (or, equivalently, macrocosm–microcosm analogy) refers to a historical view which posited a structural similarity between the human being (the , i.e., the &quot;small order&quot; or the &quot;small universe&quot;) and the cosmos as a whole (the , i.e., the &quot;great order&quot; or the &quot;great universe&quot;). Given this fundamental analogy, truths about the nature of the cosmos as a whole may be inferred from truths about human nature, and vice versa.

One important corollary of this view is that the cosmos as a whole may be considered to be alive, and thus to have a mind or soul (the world soul), a position advanced by Plato in his &quot;Timaeus&quot;. Moreover, this cosmic mind or soul was often thought to be divine, most notably by the Stoics and those who were influenced by them, such as the authors of the &quot;Hermetica&quot;. Hence, it was sometimes inferred that the human mind or soul was divine in nature as well.

Apart from this important psychological and noetic (i.e., related to the mind) application, the analogy was also applied to human physiology. For example, the cosmological functions of the seven classical planets were sometimes taken to be analogous to the physiological functions of human organs, such as the heart, the spleen, the liver, the stomach, etc.

The view itself is ancient, and may be found in many philosophical systems world-wide, for example in ancient Mesopotamia, in ancient Iran, or in ancient Chinese philosophy. However, the terms microcosm and macrocosm refer more specifically to the analogy as it was developed in ancient Greek philosophy and its medieval and early modern descendants.

In contemporary usage, the terms microcosm and macrocosm are also employed to refer to any smaller system that is representative of a larger one, and vice versa.

==History==
=== Antiquity ===
Among ancient Greek and Hellenistic philosophers, notable proponents of the microcosm–macrocosm analogy included Anaximander (), Plato (), the Hippocratic authors (late 5th or early 4th century BCE and onwards), and the Stoics (3rd century BCE and onwards). In later periods, the analogy was especially prominent in the works of those philosophers who were heavily influenced by Platonic and Stoic thought, such as Philo of Alexandria (), the authors of the early Greek &quot;Hermetica&quot; (), and the Neoplatonists (3rd century CE and onwards). The analogy was also employed in late antique and early medieval religious literature, such as in the &quot;Bundahishn&quot;, a Zoroastrian encyclopedic work, and the &quot;Avot de-Rabbi Nathan&quot;, a Jewish Rabbinical text.

=== Middle Ages ===
Medieval philosophy was generally dominated by Aristotle, who – despite having been the first to coin the term &quot;microcosm&quot; – had posited a fundamental and insurmountable difference between the region below the Moon (the sublunary world, consisting of the four elements) and the region above the Moon (the superlunary world, consisting of a fifth element). Nevertheless, the microcosm–macrocosm analogy was adopted by a wide variety of medieval thinkers working in different linguistic traditions: the concept of microcosm was known in Arabic as , in Hebrew as , and in Latin as or . The analogy was elaborated by alchemists such as those writing under the name of Jabir ibn Hayyan (), by the anonymous Shi&#x27;ite philosophers known as the Ikhwān al-Ṣafāʾ (&quot;The Brethren of Purity&quot;, ), by Jewish theologians and philosophers such as Isaac Israeli (), Saadia Gaon (882/892–942), Ibn Gabirol (11th century), and Judah Halevi (), by Victorine monks such as Godfrey of Saint Victor (born 1125, author of a treatise called &quot;Microcosmus&quot;), by the Andalusian mystic Ibn Arabi (1165–1240), by the German cardinal Nicholas of Cusa (1401–1464), and by numerous others.

===Renaissance===
The revival of Hermeticism and Neoplatonism in the Renaissance, both of which had reserved a prominent place for the microcosm–macrocosm analogy, also led to a marked rise in popularity of the latter. Some of the most notable proponents of the concept in this period include Marsilio Ficino (1433 – 1499), Heinrich Cornelius Agrippa (1486–1535), Francesco Patrizi (1529–1597), Giordano Bruno (1548–1600), and Tommaso Campanella (1568–1639). It was also central to the new medical theories propounded by the Swiss physician Paracelsus (1494–1541) and his many followers, most notably Robert Fludd (1574–1637). Andreas Vesalius (1514–1564) in his anatomy text &quot;De fabrica&quot; wrote that the human body &quot;in many respects corresponds admirably to the universe and for that reason was called the little universe by the ancients.&quot;

==In Judaism==

Analogies between microcosm and macrocosm are found throughout the history of Jewish philosophy. According to this analogy, there is a structural similarity between the human being (the , from , ) and the cosmos as a whole (the , from ).

The view was elaborated by the Jewish philosopher Philo (c. 20 BCE–50 CE), who adopted it from Hellenistic philosophy. Similar ideas can also be found in early rabbinical literature. In the Middle Ages, the analogy became a prominent theme in the works of most Jewish philosophers.

===Rabbinical literature===
In the &quot;Avot de-Rabbi Natan&quot; (compiled c. 700–900), human parts are compared with parts belonging to the larger world: the hair is like a forest, the lungs like the wind, the loins like counsellors, the stomach like a mill, etc.
===Middle Ages===
The microcosm–macrocosm analogy was a common theme among medieval Jewish philosophers, just as it was among the Arabic philosophers who were their peers. Especially influential concerning the microcosm–macrocosm analogy were the &quot;Epistles of the Brethren of Purity&quot;, an encyclopedic work written in the 10th century by an anonymous group of Shi&#x27;i Muslim philosophers. Having been brought to al-Andalus at an early date by the hadith scholar and alchemist Maslama al-Majriti of the Umayyad state of Córdoba (died 964), the &quot;Epistles&quot; were of central importance to Sephardic philosophers such as Bahya ibn Paquda (c. 1050–1120), Judah Halevi (c. 1075–1141), Joseph ibn Tzaddik (died 1149), and Abraham ibn Ezra (c. 1090–1165).

Nevertheless, the analogy was already in use by earlier Jewish philosophers. In his commentary on the &quot;Sefer Yetzirah&quot; (&quot;Book of Creation&quot;), Saadia Gaon (882/892–942) put forward a set of analogies between the cosmos, the Tabernacle, and the human being. Saadia was followed in this by a number of later authors, such as Bahya ibn Paquda, Judah Halevi, and Abraham ibn Ezra.

Whereas the physiological application of the analogy in the rabbinical work &quot;Avot de-Rabbi Natan&quot; had still been relatively simple and crude, much more elaborate versions of this application were given by Bahya ibn Paquda and Joseph ibn Tzaddik (in his &quot;Sefer ha-Olam ha-Katan&quot;, &quot;Book of the Microcosm&quot;), both of whom compared human parts with the heavenly bodies and other parts of the cosmos at large.

The analogy was linked to the ancient theme of &quot;know thyself&quot; (Greek: γνῶθι σεαυτόν, &quot;gnōthi seauton&quot;) by the physician and philosopher Isaac Israeli (c. 832–932), who suggested that by knowing oneself, a human being may gain knowledge of all things. This theme of self-knowledge returned in the works of Joseph ibn Tzaddik, who added that in this way humans may come to know God himself. The macrocosm was also associated with the divine by Judah Halevi, who saw God as the spirit, soul, mind, and life that animates the universe, while according to Maimonides (1138–1204), the relationship between God and the universe is analogous to the relationship between the intellect and the human being.

<text>Irvin McDowell (October 15, 1818 – May 4, 1885) was an American army officer. He is best known for his defeat in the First Battle of Bull Run, the first large-scale battle of the American Civil War. In 1862, he was given command of the I Corps of the Army of the Potomac. He fought unsuccessfully against Thomas &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s troops during the Valley Campaign of 1862 and was blamed for contributing to the defeat of United States troops at the Second Battle of Bull Run in August.

==Early life==
McDowell was born in Columbus, Ohio, son of Abram Irvin McDowell and Eliza Seldon McDowell, and was of English and Scots-Irish descent. He was a cousin-in-law of John Buford, and his brother, John Adair McDowell, served as the first colonel of the 6th Iowa Volunteer Infantry Regiment during the Civil War.

McDowell initially attended the College de Troyes in France before graduating from the United States Military Academy in 1838, where one of his classmates was P. G. T. Beauregard, his future adversary at First Bull Run. He was commissioned a second lieutenant and posted to the 1st U.S. Artillery. McDowell served as a tactics instructor at West Point before becoming aide-de-camp to General John E. Wool during the Mexican–American War. He was brevetted captain at Buena Vista and served in the Adjutant General&#x27;s department after the war. While in that department, he was promoted to major on May 31, 1856.

Between 1848 and 1861, McDowell generally served, as a staff officer to higher-ranking military leaders and developed experience in logistics and supply. He developed a close friendship with General Winfield Scott, while serving on his staff. He also served under future Confederate general Joseph E. Johnston.

==Civil War==

McDowell was promoted to brigadier general in the regular army on May 14, 1861, and was given command of the Army of Northeastern Virginia on May 27. The promotion was partly because of the influence of his mentor, Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase. Although McDowell knew that his troops were inexperienced and unready and protested that he was a supply officer, not a field commander, pressure from the Washington politicians forced him to launch a premature offensive against Confederate forces in Northern Virginia. His strategy during the First Battle of Bull Run was imaginative but ambitiously complex, and his troops were not experienced enough to carry it out effectively, resulting in an embarrassing rout.

After the defeat at Bull Run, Major General George B. McClellan was placed in command of the new Union Army defending Washington, the Army of the Potomac. McDowell became a division commander in the Army of the Potomac. On March 14, 1862, President Lincoln issued an order forming the army into corps, and McDowell got command of the I Corps as well as a promotion to major general of volunteers. When the army set off for the Virginia Peninsula in April, McDowell&#x27;s command was detached for duty in the Rappahannock area out of concern over Stonewall Jackson&#x27;s activities in the Shenandoah Valley (one division was later sent down to the Peninsula).

Eventually, the three independent commands of Generals McDowell, John C. Frémont, and Nathaniel P. Banks were combined into Major General John Pope&#x27;s Army of Virginia and McDowell led the III Corps of that army. Because of his actions at Cedar Mountain, McDowell was eventually brevetted major general in the regular army; however, he was blamed for the subsequent disaster at Second Bull Run. McDowell was also widely despised by his own troops, who believed him to be in cahoots with the enemy. He escaped culpability by testifying against Major General Fitz John Porter, whom Pope court-martialed for alleged insubordination in that battle. Pope and McDowell did not like each other, but McDowell tolerated serving under him with the full knowledge that he himself would remain a general after the war was over while Pope would revert to the rank of colonel. Despite his formal escape, McDowell received no new assignments for the next two years.

==Later service and postbellum career==
In July 1864, McDowell was given command of the Department of the Pacific. He later commanded the Department of California from July 27, 1865, to March 31, 1868; briefly commanded the Fourth Military Department; then commanded the Department of the East from July 16, 1868, to December 16, 1872. On November 25, 1872, he was promoted to major general. On December 16, 1872, McDowell succeeded General George G. Meade as commander of the Military Division of the South and remained until June 30, 1876. From July 1, 1876, he was commander of the Division of the Pacific. In 1882, Congress imposed a mandatory retirement age of 64 for military officers, and McDowell retired on October 14 of that year.

In 1879, when a board of review commissioned by President Rutherford B. Hayes issued its report recommending a pardon for Fitz John Porter, it attributed much of the loss of the Second Battle of Bull Run to McDowell. In the report, he was depicted as indecisive, uncommunicative, and inept, repeatedly failing to answer Porter&#x27;s requests for information, failing to forward intelligence of Longstreet&#x27;s positioning to Pope, and neglecting to take command of the left wing of the Union Army as was his duty under the Articles of War.

Following his retirement from the army, General McDowell exercised his fondness for landscape gardening, serving as Park Commissioner of San Francisco, California until his death from heart attack on May 4, 1885. In this capacity, he constructed a park in the neglected reservation of the Presidio, laying out drives that commanded views of the Golden Gate. He is buried in San Francisco National Cemetery in the Presidio of San Francisco.

<text>The Longdendale Trail is an English long-distance rail trail following the former Woodhead railway line, which ran between Manchester and Sheffield and closed east of Hadfield, Derbyshire in 1981. It has shallow gradients and a smooth surface that makes it popular with families and cyclists.

The trail, which opened in May 1992, forms part of the longer Trans Pennine Trail, NCR 62, that runs from coast to coast across the UK (Liverpool to Hull). This in turn is part of the E8 European long distance path, which runs for from Cork in Ireland to Istanbul in Turkey.

The Longdendale Trail follows the Longdendale Chain of reservoirs and is owned and managed by the water company United Utilities.

<doc id="247913" wikidata="Q267962" url="?curid=247913" title="Alain-René Lesage">
<text>Alain-René Lesage (; 6 May 166817 November 1747; older spelling Le Sage) was a French novelist and playwright. Lesage is best known for his comic novel &quot;The Devil upon Two Sticks&quot; (1707, &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot;), his comedy &quot;Turcaret&quot; (1709), and his picaresque novel &quot;Gil Blas&quot; (1715–1735).

==Life==

===Youth and education===
Claude Lesage, the father of the novelist, held the united positions of advocate, notary and registrar of the royal court in Rhuys. His mother&#x27;s name was Jeanne Brenugat. Both Lesage&#x27;s father and mother died when Lesage was very young, and he was left in the care of his uncle who wasted his education and fortune. Bochard, of the Order of the Jesuits, Principal of the College in Vannes, became interested in the boy on account of his natural talents. Bochard cultivated Lesage&#x27;s taste for literature. At age 25, Lesage went to Paris in 1693 &quot;to pursue his philosophical studies&quot;.

In August 1694, he married the daughter of a joiner, Marie Elizabeth Huyard. She was beautiful but had no fortune, and Lesage had little practice. About this time he encountered an old schoolfellow, the dramatist Antoine Danchet, who is said to have advised him to take up literature. He began as a translator, and published in 1695 a French version of the &quot;Epistles&quot; of Aristaenetus, which was not successful. Shortly afterwards he found a valuable patron and adviser in the Abbé de Lyonne, who bestowed on him an annuity of 600 livres, and recommended him to exchange the classics for Spanish literature, of which he was himself a student and collector. Spanish literature was once very popular in France when the queens of the house of Austria sat upon the throne, but had become neglected by Lesage&#x27;s time.

===First literary efforts===

Lesage began by translating plays chiefly from Francisco de Rojas Zorrilla and Lope de Vega. &quot;Le Traître puni&quot; and &quot;Le Point d&#x27;honneur&quot; from the former and &quot;Don Félix de Mendoce&quot; from the latter were acted or published in the first two or three years of the 18th century. In 1704, he translated the continuation of &quot;Don Quixote&quot; by Alonso Fernández de Avellaneda, and soon afterwards adapted a play from Pedro Calderón de la Barca, &quot;Don César Ursin&quot;, which was successful at court and damned in the city. Lesage was, however, nearly forty before he obtained decided success. In 1707, his farce, &quot;Crispin rival de son maître&quot;, was well received, and &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot; (with a frontispiece by Louise-Magdeleine Horthemels) was published and ran to several editions. Lesage altered and improved this play in 1725, giving it its present form. Notwithstanding the success of &quot;Crispin&quot;, the actors did not like Lesage, and refused a small piece of his called &quot;Les Étrennes&quot; (1707). He thereupon altered it into &quot;Turcaret&quot; (1709), considered his theatrical masterpiece. Around this time his publisher Claude Barbin also asked Lesage to rework François Pétis de la Croix&#x27;s translation of Turkish tales (1710–12) into marketable French, and included two of these stories at the end of the eighth volume of Antoine Galland&#x27;s &quot;Les mille et une nuits&quot; (1709).

===Prose writings===
Some years passed before he again attempted romance writing, and then the first two parts of &quot;Gil Blas de Santillane&quot; were published in 1715, without the popularity of &quot;Le Diable boiteux&quot;. Lesage worked at it for a long time, and did not bring out the third part till 1724, nor the fourth till 1735. During these twenty years he was, however, continually busy. Notwithstanding the great merit and success of &quot;Turcaret&quot; and &quot;Crispin&quot;, the Théâtre Français did not welcome him, and in 1715 he began to write for the Théâtre de la foire, the comic opera held in booths at festival time. According to one computation he produced, either alone or with others, about a hundred pieces, varying from strings of songs with no regular dialogues, to comediettas only distinguished from regular plays by the introduction of music. He was also industrious in prose fiction. Besides finishing &quot;Gil Blas&quot; he translated the &quot;Orlando innamorato&quot; (1721), rearranged &quot;Guzman d&#x27;Alfarache&quot; (1732), published two more or less original novels, &quot;Le Bachelier de Salamanque&quot; and &quot;Estevanille Gonzalez&quot;, and in 1732 produced &quot;Les avantures de monsieur Robert Chevalier, dit de Beauchêne, capitaine de flibustiers dans la Nouvelle-France&quot;, which resembles certain works of Daniel Defoe. Besides all this, Lesage was also the author of &quot;La Valise trouvée&quot;, a collection of imaginary letters, and of some minor pieces including &quot;Une journée des Parques&quot;. He did not retire until 1740, when he was more than seventy years of age; he and his wife went to live with his second son, who was a canon at Boulogne-sur-Mer. Lesage&#x27;s eldest son, Louis-André, had become an actor, and Lesage had disowned him. Lesage&#x27;s last work, &quot;Mélange amusant de saillies d&#x27;esprit et de traits historiques les plus frappants&quot;, appeared in 1743.

===Retirement===
With his wife he had three sons and a daughter whose filial piety made her devote her entire life to serving her genius father. Though he lived happily, one event embittered Lesage for years. His eldest son had been educated for the bar, but insisted going on stage. Lesage, who had often painted the life of the actor in the most ridiculous and hateful aspect, was pained by his son&#x27;s career choice, especially when his son joined the Théâtre Français, against which Lesage had long waged a satirical war. Probably out of deference to his father, the son took the name Montménil, and by the merit of his talents and private character, soon entered the upper society of Paris. Lesage was reconciled with his son many years later and became so devoted to Montménil that he could barely leave his side.

Montménil caught cold during a hunting party and died on 8 September 1743. This was such a severe blow to Lesage that he retired forever from Paris and the world. Lesage&#x27;s youngest son had also become an actor under the name Pittenec, so Lesage and his wife saw out their old age in the home of their second son who had become the Abbé Lesage. This son had been made a Canon of the Cathedral of Boulogne, through the patronage of the queen, and been bestowed a fair pension.

Lesage lived beyond 80 years of age, but was afflicted with deafness and had to use an ear trumpet. However, his conversation was so delightful that when he ventured into the world and frequented his favourite coffee house in Rue St. Jacques in Paris, guests would gather around him, climbing onto tables and chairs, to hear his famous words of wit and wisdom.

Alain-René Lesage died on 17 November 1747.

==Personality==
Very little is known of Lesage&#x27;s life and personality. Various anecdotes represent him as a very independent man, declining to accept the literary patronage required to survive. One story tells of the time he had been entreated to read his manuscript (according to the fashion of the day) at the Hôtel de Bouillon by the Duchess. The hour appointed for the reading was noon, but the dramatist was still very interested in legal matters and was detained until 1 o&#x27;clock attending the decision of a lawsuit. When he finally appeared at the Hôtel and attempted to apologise, the Duchess of Bouillon was so cold and haughty, observing that he had made her guests lose one hour waiting for his arrival. &quot;It is easy to make up the loss madame&quot;, replied Lesage; &quot;I will not read my comedy, and thus you will gain two hours.&quot; With that, he left the Hôtel and could never be persuaded to return to the Duchess&#x27;s house.

<text>Johanna Maria Lind (Madame Goldschmidt) (6 October 18202 November 1887) was a Swedish opera singer, often called the &quot;Swedish Nightingale&quot;. One of the most highly regarded singers of the 19th century, she performed in soprano roles in opera in Sweden and across Europe, and undertook an extraordinarily popular concert tour of the United States beginning in 1850. She was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music from 1840.

Lind became famous after her performance in &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; in Sweden in 1838. Within a few years, she had suffered vocal damage, but the singing teacher Manuel García saved her voice. She was in great demand in opera roles throughout Sweden and northern Europe during the 1840s, and was closely associated with Felix Mendelssohn. After two acclaimed seasons in London, she announced her retirement from opera at the age of 29.

In 1850, Lind went to the United States at the invitation of the showman P. T. Barnum. She gave 93 large-scale concerts for him and then continued to tour under her own management. She earned more than $350,000 () from these concerts, donating the proceeds to charities, principally the endowment of free schools in Sweden. With her new husband, Otto Goldschmidt, she returned to Europe in 1852, where she had three children and gave occasional concerts over the next three decades, settling in England in 1855. From 1882, for some years, she was a professor of singing at the Royal College of Music in London.

==Life and career==
===Early life===
Born in Klara in central Stockholm, Sweden, Lind was the illegitimate daughter of Niclas Jonas Lind, a bookkeeper, and Anne-Marie Fellborg, a schoolteacher. Lind&#x27;s mother had divorced her first husband for adultery but refused to remarry until after his death in 1834. Lind&#x27;s parents married when she was 14.
Lind&#x27;s mother ran a day school for girls out of her home. When Lind was about 9, her singing was overheard by the maid of Mademoiselle Lundberg, the principal dancer at the Royal Swedish Opera. The maid, astounded by Lind&#x27;s extraordinary voice, returned the next day with Lundberg, who arranged an audition and helped her gain admission to the Royal Dramatic Training Academy, the acting school of the Royal Dramatic Theatre, where she studied with Carl Magnus Craelius, the singing master at the theatre.

Lind began to sing onstage when she was 10. She had a vocal crisis at the age of 12 and had to stop singing for a time, but she recovered. Her first great role was Agathe in Weber&#x27;s &quot;Der Freischütz&quot; in 1838 at the Royal Swedish Opera. At 20, she was a member of the Royal Swedish Academy of Music and court singer to the King of Sweden and Norway. Her voice became seriously damaged by overuse and untrained singing technique, but her career was saved by the singing teacher Manuel García with whom she studied in Paris from 1841 to 1843. He insisted that she should not sing at all for three months, to allow her vocal cords to recover, before he started to teach her a healthy and secure Bel canto vocal technique.
After Lind had been with García for a year, the composer Giacomo Meyerbeer, an early and faithful admirer of her talent, arranged an audition for her at the Opéra in Paris, but she was rejected. The biographer Francis Rogers concludes that Lind strongly resented the rebuff: when she became an international star, she always refused invitations to sing at the Paris Opéra. Lind returned to the Royal Swedish Opera, greatly improved as a singer by García&#x27;s training. She toured Denmark where, in 1843, Hans Christian Andersen met and fell in love with her. Although the two became good friends, she did not reciprocate his romantic feelings. She is believed to have inspired three of his fairy tales: &quot;Beneath the Pillar&quot;, &quot;The Angel&quot; and &quot;The Nightingale&quot;. He wrote, &quot;No book or personality whatever has exerted a more ennobling influence on me, as a poet, than Jenny Lind. For me she opened the sanctuary of art.&quot; The biographer Carol Rosen believes that after Lind rejected Andersen as a suitor, he portrayed her as &quot;The Snow Queen&quot; with a heart of ice.

===German and British success===
In December 1844, through Meyerbeer&#x27;s influence, Lind was engaged to sing the title role in Bellini&#x27;s opera &quot;Norma&quot; in Berlin. That led to more engagements in opera houses throughout Germany and Austria, but such was her success in Berlin that she continued there for four months before she left for other cities. Among her early admirers were Robert Schumann, Hector Berlioz and, most importantly for her, Felix Mendelssohn. Ignaz Moscheles wrote: &quot;Jenny Lind has fairly enchanted me... her song with two concertante flutes is perhaps the most incredible feat in the way of bravura singing that can possibly be heard&quot;. That number, from Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Ein Feldlager in Schlesien&quot; (&quot;The Camp of Silesia&quot;, 1844, a role written for Lind but not premiered by her) became one of the songs most associated with Lind, and she was called on to sing it wherever she performed in concert. Her operatic repertoire included the title roles in &quot;Lucia di Lammermoor&quot;, &quot;Maria di Rohan&quot;, &quot;Norma&quot;, &quot;La sonnambula&quot; and &quot;La vestale&quot; as well as Susanna in &quot;The Marriage of Figaro&quot;, Adina in &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; and Alice in &quot;Robert le diable&quot;. About that time, she became known as &quot;the Swedish Nightingale&quot;. In December 1845, the day after her debut at the Leipzig Gewandhaus under the baton of Mendelssohn, she sang without fee for a charity concert in aid of the Orchestra Widows&#x27; Fund. Her devotion and generosity to charitable causes remained a key aspect of her career and greatly enhanced her international popularity even among the unmusical.
At the Royal Swedish Opera, Lind had been friends with the tenor Julius Günther. They sang together both in opera and on the concert stage and became romantically linked by 1844. Their schedules separated them, however, as Günther remained in Stockholm and then became a student of Garcia in Paris in 1846–1847. After reuniting in Sweden, according to Lind&#x27;s 1891 &quot;Memoir&quot;, they became engaged to marry in the spring of 1848, just before Lind returned to England. However, the two broke off the engagement in October of the same year.

After a successful season in Vienna, where she was mobbed by admirers and feted by the Imperial Family, Lind traveled to London and gave her first performance there on 4 May 1847, when she appeared in an Italian version of Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot;. It was attended by Queen Victoria; the next day, &quot;The Times&quot; wrote:

We have had frequent experience of the excitement appertaining to &quot;first nights&quot;, but we may safely say, and our opinion will be backed by several hundreds of Her Majesty&#x27;s subjects, that we never witnessed such a scene of enthusiasm as that displayed last night on the occasion of Mademoiselle Jenny Lind&#x27;s &quot;début&quot; as Alice in an Italian version of &quot;Robert le diable&quot;.

Queen Victoria attended each of Lind&#x27;s sixteen debut performances in London. In July 1847, Lind starred in the world première of Verdi&#x27;s opera &quot;I masnadieri&quot; at Her Majesty&#x27;s Theatre, under the baton of the composer. During her two years on the operatic stage in London, Lind appeared in most of the standard opera repertory. In early 1849, still in her twenties, Lind announced her permanent retirement from opera. Her last opera performance was on 10 May 1849 in &quot;Robert le diable&quot;; Queen Victoria and other members of the Royal Family were present. Lind&#x27;s biographer Francis Rogers wrote, &quot;The reasons for her early retirement have been much discussed for nearly a century, but remain today a matter of mystery. Many possible explanations have been advanced, but not one of them has been verified&quot;.

===Lind and Mendelssohn===
In London, Lind&#x27;s close friendship with Mendelssohn continued. There had been speculation that their relationship extended beyond friendship. In 2013, George Biddlecombe confirmed in the &quot;Journal of the Royal Musical Association&quot; that &quot;The Committee of the Mendelssohn Scholarship Foundation possesses material indicating that Mendelssohn wrote passionate love letters to Lind entreating her to join him in an adulterous relationship and threatening suicide as a means of exerting pressure upon her, and that these letters were destroyed on being discovered after her death&quot;.

Mendelssohn was present at Lind&#x27;s London debut in &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, and his friend, the critic Henry Chorley, who was with him, wrote: &quot;I see as I write the smile with which Mendelssohn, whose enjoyment of Mdlle. Lind&#x27;s talent was unlimited, turned round and looked at me, as if a load of anxiety had been taken off his mind. His attachment to Mademoiselle Lind&#x27;s genius as a singer was unbounded, as was his desire for her success.&quot; Mendelssohn worked with Lind on many occasions and wrote the beginnings of an opera, &quot;Lorelei&quot;, for her, based on the legend of the Lorelei Rhine maidens; the opera was unfinished at his death. He composed the soprano aria in his oratorio &quot;Elijah&quot; (&quot;Hear Ye Israel&quot;) with Lind&#x27;s voice in mind, focusing the tessitura of the aria around F-sharp (F♯5), a note in her range that Mendelssohn supposedly found irresistibly charming.

Four months after her London debut, she was devastated by the premature death of Mendelssohn in November 1847. She did not at first feel able to sing the soprano part in &quot;Elijah&quot;, which he had written for her. She finally did so at a performance in London&#x27;s Exeter Hall in late 1848, which raised £1,000 to fund a musical scholarship as a memorial to him; it was her first appearance in oratorio. The original intention had been to found a school of music in Mendelssohn&#x27;s name in Leipzig, but there was not enough support there, and with the help of Sir George Smart, Julius Benedict and others, Lind eventually raised enough money to fund a scholarship &quot;to receive pupils of all nations and promote their musical training&quot;. The first recipient of the Mendelssohn Scholarship was the 14-year-old Arthur Sullivan, whom Lind encouraged in his career.

===American tour===

In 1849, Lind was approached by the American showman P. T. Barnum with a proposal to tour throughout the United States, giving 150 concerts in eighteen months. Realising that it would yield large sums for charity, particularly the endowment of free schools in her native Sweden, Lind demanded a fixed fee of $1,000 per concert, and in January 1850 Barnum agreed.

Together with a supporting baritone, Giovanni Belletti, and her London colleague, Julius Benedict, as pianist, arranger and conductor, Lind sailed to America in September 1850. Barnum&#x27;s advance publicity made her a celebrity even before she arrived in the US, and she received a wild reception on arriving in New York. Tickets for some of her concerts were in such demand that Barnum sold them by auction. The enthusiasm of the public was so strong that the American press coined the term &quot;Lind mania&quot;. 
After her first two performances in New York in September 1850, Lind&#x27;s party toured the east coast of the United States, with continued success, and later took in Cuba, the Southern US and Canada. By early 1851, Lind had become uncomfortable with Barnum&#x27;s relentless marketing of the tour, and she invoked a contractual right to sever her ties with him; they parted amicably. She continued the tour for nearly a year, under her own management, until May 1852. Benedict left the party in 1851 to return to England, and Lind invited Otto Goldschmidt to replace him as pianist and conductor. Lind and Goldschmidt were married on 5 February 1852, near the end of the tour, in Boston. She used the name &quot;Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt&quot; (or &quot;Jenny Goldschmidt Lind&quot; or simply &quot;Jenny Goldschmidt&quot;) both privately and professionally.

Details of the later concerts under her own management are scarce, but it is known that under Barnum&#x27;s management Lind gave 93 concerts in the United States for which she earned about $350,000, and he netted at least $500,000 ($ and $, as of 2021, respectively). She donated her profits to various charities, including free schools in Sweden and some US charities. The tour is a plot point in the 1980 musical &quot;Barnum&quot; and the 2017 film &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;, both of which include a fictionalized relationship between Lind and Barnum with &quot;romantic undertones&quot;.

At the time of her tour, the debate over slavery in the United States had been intensified by the Compromise of 1850. American abolitionists attempted to secure Lind&#x27;s support for their cause, but she refused to comment on the institution. After meeting Lind in July 1851, British abolitionist Judith Griffiths wrote that &quot;the colored people are regarded by her as beneath humanity – and too unworthy to be educated... She seemed horrified at colored people – I now know for myself that she is thoroughly pro-slavery – I am so grieved.&quot; Abolitionist lawyer Maunsell Field wrote that &quot;she had an abhorrence for negroes she could not overcome. &#x27;They are so ugly&#x27;, she used to say.&quot; Yet in June 1852, Lind donated $100 to Harriet Beecher Stowe to free the Edmonsons, a Black family enslaved in Washington, D.C., praising &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; as &quot;having been a strong means in the Creator&#x27;s hand of operating essential good in one of the most important questions for the welfare of our black brethren.&quot; Historian Joan D. Hedrick suggested that Stowe&#x27;s book &quot;may have changed Lind&#x27;s heart&quot;.

===Later years===

Lind and Goldschmidt returned to Europe together in May 1852. They lived first in Dresden, Germany, and, from 1855, in England for the rest of their lives. They had three children: Otto, born September 1853 in Germany, Jenny, born March 1857 in England, and Ernest, born January 1861 in England.

Although she refused all requests to appear in opera after her return to Europe, Lind continued to perform in the concert hall. In 1856, at the invitation of the Philharmonic Society conducted by William Sterndale Bennett, she sang the chief soprano part in the first English performance of the cantata &quot;Paradise and the Peri&quot; by Robert Schumann. In 1866, she gave a concert with Arthur Sullivan at St James&#x27;s Hall. &quot;The Times&quot; reported, &quot;there is magic still in that voice... the most perfect singing – perfect alike in expression and in vocalization... Nothing more engaging, nothing more earnest, nothing more dramatic can be imagined.&quot; At Düsseldorf in January 1870, she sang in &quot;Ruth&quot;, an oratorio composed by her husband. When Goldschmidt formed the Bach Choir in 1875, Lind trained the soprano choristers for the first English performance of Bach&#x27;s B minor Mass in April 1876, and performed in the mass. Her concerts decreased in frequency until she retired from singing in 1883.

From 1879 until 1887, Lind worked with Frederick Niecks on his biography of Frédéric Chopin. In 1882, she was appointed professor of singing at the newly founded Royal College of Music. She believed in an all-round musical training for her pupils, insisting that, in addition to their vocal studies, they were instructed in solfège, piano, harmony, diction, deportment and at least one foreign language. Her students included German singer and composer Georgina Schubert. In 1868, Lind wrote that a singer&#x27;s vowels must be rich in quality to form a sensation of &quot;speak singing&quot;. She also stated that the different registers of the voice were unique to each individual and that each register needed to be trained individually and tailored to the specific singer&#x27;s ability.

Lind lived her final years at Wynds Point, Herefordshire, on the Malvern Hills near the British Camp. Her last public appearance was at a charity concert at Royal Malvern Spa in 1883. She died of cancer at age 67 at Wynds Point on 2 November 1887, and was buried in the Great Malvern Cemetery to the music of Chopin&#x27;s Funeral March. She bequeathed a considerable part of her wealth to help poor Protestant students in Sweden receive an education.

==Critical reputation==

There are no known surviving recordings of Lind&#x27;s voice. She is believed to have made an early phonograph recording for Thomas Edison, but in the words of the critic Philip L. Miller, &quot;Even had the fabled Edison cylinder survived, it would have been too primitive, and she too long retired, to tell us much&quot;. The biographer Francis Rogers concludes that although Lind was much admired by Meyerbeer, Mendelssohn, the Schumanns, Berlioz and others, &quot;In voice and in dramatic talent she was undoubtedly inferior to her predecessors, Malibran and Pasta, and to her contemporaries, Sontag and Grisi.&quot; He notes that because of her expert promoters, including Barnum, &quot;almost all that was written about her was undoubtedly biased by an almost overwhelming propaganda in her favor, bought and paid for&quot;. Rogers says of Mendelssohn and Lind&#x27;s other admirers that their tastes were &quot;essentially Teutonic&quot; and, except for Meyerbeer, they were not expert in Italian opera, Lind&#x27;s early specialty. He quotes a critic of the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, who noted &quot;little deficiencies in execution, in ascending the scale, which even enthusiasm cannot deprive of their sharpness&quot;. The American press agreed that Lind&#x27;s presentation was more typical of Germanic &quot;cold, untouching, icy purity of tone and style&quot;, rather than the passionate expression necessary for Italian opera, and the &quot;Herald&quot; wrote that her style was &quot;suited to please the people of our cold climate. She will have triumphs here that would never attend her progress through France or Italy&quot;.

The critic H. F. Chorley, who admired Lind, described her voice as having &quot;two octaves in compass – from D to D – having a higher possible note or two, available on rare occasions; and that the lower half of the register and the upper one were of two distinct qualities. The former was not strong – veiled, if not husky; and apt to be out of tune. The latter was rich, brilliant and powerful – finest in its highest portions.&quot; Chorley praised her breath management, her use of &quot;pianissimo&quot;, her taste in ornament and her intelligent use of technique to conceal the differences between her upper and lower registers. He thought her &quot;execution was great&quot; and that she was a &quot;skilled and careful musician&quot; but felt that &quot;many of her effects on the stage appeared overcalculated&quot; and that singing in foreign languages impeded her ability to give expression to the text. He felt that her concert singing was more admirable than her operatic performances, but he praised some of her roles. Chorley judged her finest work to be in the German repertoire, citing Mozart, Haydn and Mendelssohn&#x27;s &quot;Elijah&quot; as best suited to her. Miller concluded that although connoisseurs of the voice preferred other singers, her wider appeal to the public at large was not merely a legend created by Barnum but was a mixture of &quot;a uniquely pure (some called it celestial) quality in her voice, consistent with her well-known generosity and charity&quot;.

==Memorials==

Lind is commemorated in Poets&#x27; Corner, Westminster Abbey, London under the name &quot;Jenny Lind-Goldschmidt&quot;. Among those present at the memorial&#x27;s unveiling ceremony on 20 April 1894 were Goldschmidt, members of the Royal Family, Sullivan, Sir George Grove and representatives of some of the charities supported by Lind. There is also a plaque commemorating Lind in The Boltons, Kensington, London and a blue plaque at 189 Old Brompton Road, London, SW7, which was erected in 1909.

Lind has been commemorated in music, on screen and even on banknotes. In the 1930 Hollywood film &quot;A Lady&#x27;s Morals&quot;, Grace Moore starred as Lind, with Wallace Beery as Barnum. The Swedish opera singer Helga Görlin portrayed Lind in the 1937 Swedish historical drama film &quot;John Ericsson, Victor of Hampton Roads&quot;. In 1941 Ilse Werner starred as Lind in the German-language musical biography film &quot;The Swedish Nightingale&quot;. In 2001, a semibiographical film, &quot;Hans Christian Andersen: My Life as a Fairytale&quot;, featured Flora Montgomery as Lind. In 2005, Elvis Costello announced that he was writing an opera about Lind, called &quot;The Secret Arias&quot; with some lyrics by Andersen. A 2010 BBC television documentary &quot;Chopin – The Women Behind the Music&quot; includes discussion of Chopin&#x27;s last years, during which Lind &quot;so affected&quot; the composer.
Both the 1996 and 2006 issues of the Swedish 50-krona banknote bear a portrait of Lind on the front. Many artistic works have honoured or featured her. Anton Wallerstein composed the &quot;Jenny Lind Polka&quot; around 1850. Many places and objects have been named for Lind, including Jenny Lind Island in Canada, the &quot;Jenny Lind&quot; locomotive and a clipper ship, the USS &quot;Nightingale&quot;. An Australian schooner was named &quot;Jenny Lind&quot; in her honour. In 1857, it was wrecked in a creek on the Queensland coast; the creek was accordingly named Jenny Lind Creek. A bronze statue of a seated Jenny Lind by Erik Rafael-Rådberg, dedicated in 1924, sits in the Framnäs section of Djurgården island in Stockholm.

In Britain, Goldschmidt&#x27;s endowment of an infirmary for children in her honour in Norwich is perpetuated in its present form as the Jenny Lind Children&#x27;s Hospital of the Norfolk and Norwich University Hospital. There is a Jenny Lind Park in the same city. A chapel is named for Lind at the University of Worcester City Campus. A hotel and pub is named after her in the Old Town of Hastings, East Sussex. Hereford County Hospital has a psychiatric ward named for Jenny Lind. A district in Glasgow is named after her. In Sutton, London, the pub &quot;The Jenny Lind&quot;, next to Lind Road, has been renamed &quot;The Nightingale&quot;.

In the US, Lind is commemorated by street names in Amelia, Ohio; Fort Smith, Arkansas; New Bedford, Massachusetts; Taunton, Massachusetts; McKeesport, Pennsylvania; North Easton, Massachusetts; North Highlands, California and Stanhope, New Jersey; and in the name of Jenny Lind, Arkansas. The town of Jenny Lind, California is likely named after her, although there are several tales about its naming. An elementary school in Minneapolis, Minnesota, and the Jenny Lind Tower, a stone tower in North Truro, Massachusetts, are named for her. She visited Mammoth Cave in central Kentucky in 1851, and a feature in the cave was named in her honor, called &quot;Jenny Lind&#x27;s Armchair&quot;. Cottage-style spindled furniture is still named for her, especially Jenny Lind cribs and beds. Andover, Illinois, has the Jenny Lind Chapel, a Swedish Lutheran Chapel that Lind donated $1,500 to construct. The Jenny Lind Wing is part of a student residence building at Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois, which was founded by the Swedish Evangelical Lutheran Augustana Synod in North America in 1860. The college also named a Jenny Lind Vocal Ensemble. Jenny Lind soup is a soup named for her. The American Swedish Historical Museum&#x27;s Jenny Lind Room is devoted to her and the lasting effects of her widespread popularity in America. Her 1850–1852 tour of America is a plot point in the 1980 musical &quot;Barnum&quot; and the 2017 film &quot;The Greatest Showman&quot;, both of which include a fictionalized relationship between Lind and Barnum with &quot;romantic undertones&quot;.

Norwegian Air Shuttle&#x27;s Boeing 737-8JP registration LN-DYG is called &quot;Jenny Lind&quot; and has a drawing of Lind on its tail.

<text>The University of Seville (&quot;Universidad de Sevilla&quot;) is a university in Seville, Andalusia, Spain. Founded under the name of &quot;Colegio Santa María de Jesús&quot; in 1505, in 2022 it has a student body of 57,214, and is ranked 6th among Spanish universities.

==History==

=== Colegio de Santa María de Jesús ===
The University of Seville originally dates to the 15th century. Created by Archdeacon Maese Rodrigo Fernández de Santaella, it was originally called &quot;Colegio de Santa María de Jesús.&quot; In the 16th century (1505), a Bull of Pope Julius II granted the college the faculty to teach degrees in Theology, Philosophy, Law, Medicine and Arts&quot;.&quot; In 1551, the City Council allowed it, by means of a Royal Provision, to officially become a university, enjoying all the privileges of the other Spanish universities.

Its antecedents date back to the middle of the 13th century, the Dominicans, in order to prepare missionaries for work among the Moors and Jews, organised schools for the teaching of Arabic, Hebrew, and Greek. To cooperate in this work and to enhance the prestige of Seville, Alfonso the Wise in 1254 established &quot;general schools&quot; (&quot;escuelas generales&quot;) of Arabic and Latin in Seville. Alexander IV recognized this foundation as a &quot;generale litterarum studium&quot; by the Papal Bull of 21 June 1260 and granted its members certain dispensations in the matter of residence. Later, the cathedral chapter established ecclesiastical studies in the College of San Miguel. Rodrigo Fernández de Santaella, archdeacon of the cathedral and commonly known as Maese Rodrigo, began the construction of a building for a university in 1472; in 1502 the Catholic Monarchs published the royal decree creating the university, and in 1505 Julius II granted the Bull of authorization. The construction of the chapel of Santa Maria de Jesus began in 1505 and was consecrated on May 17, 1506. The work on the chapel was completed in 1519 and the construction of the college was finished around 1520. In 1526 it was enlarged with the acquisition of an adjoining plot of land that belonged to the Alcazar. The Catholic Monarchs and the pope granted the power to confer degrees in logic, philosophy, theology, and canon and civil law.

In 1621, new statutes were drawn up that gave the university greater independence with respect to the college, which, in turn, came to be sponsored by the Count-Duke of Olivares and was renamed Colegio Mayor de Santa María de Jesús, which differentiated it more from the nearby Colegio de Santo Tomás, governed by the Dominicans. In 1621 the university had four faculties: Theology, Canons and Law, Medicine and Arts, and granted the degrees of bachelor, bachelor and doctor in all faculties, along with that of master for the Faculty of Arts.

The &quot;colegio mayor de Maese Rodrigo&quot; and the university proper, although housed in the same building, never lost their separate identities, as is shown by the fact that, in the 18th century, the university was moved to the College of San Hermenegildo, while that of Maese Rodrigo remained independent, although languishing.

In 1767 Pablo de Olavide, assistant of Seville, after knowing the situation of the university, prepared a report in which other personalities participated, among them the clergymen José Cevallos and Luis Germán y Ribón, of the Real Academia Sevillana de Buenas Letras. The report proposed the end of the centers of theology studies, which were organized by different religious orders; the secularization of the chairs and their duration so that they would not be for life; the elaboration of new texts for the faculties of Theology, Arts or Philosophy, Canons and Law and Medicine, as well as a new course in Mathematics; and greater independence of the university with respect to the college. These proposals were approved by Royal Decree in 1769.

In 1767 the Jesuits were expelled from Spain. In 1768 Olavide proposed that the university be moved to the former professed house of that order, a 16th-century building on Laraña Street. This was approved by the Royal Order of May 31, 1768. The move took place in 1771.

The school was confiscated in 1835. It was used as a barracks for the local militia. In 1848 it was renovated, and housed the diocesan seminary. With this use, it underwent a major renovation at the end of the 19th century.  The seminary was moved to the palace of San Telmo in 1901 and the school building was sold to the real estate developer Juan Bautista Calvi. In 1909 it was demolished for the creation of the current Constitution Avenue. The façade was moved to the Santa Clara convent, where it was mounted in 1922 by Juan Talavera y Heredia when a portion of the convent was used as a municipal museum. The façade remains in the convent of Santa Clara. The chapel of the school, which became the headquarters of the &quot;Consejo de Hermandades y Cofradías&quot;, has been preserved.

=== Real Universidad Literaria ===
In 1772 this center, now separated from the Colegio Mayor de Santa María de Jesús, was renamed &quot;Real Universidad Literaria&quot; (Royal Literary University). It had this name until 1845.

The Royal Decree of July 12, 1807, promoted by the minister José Antonio Caballero, implemented in all Spanish universities the study plan approved that year by the University of Salamanca and suppressed all the minor universities, such as those of Baeza and Osuna. Both were reinstated in 1815, although they were definitively suppressed in 1824. In the nineteenth century new general university plans and reforms were carried out that affected certain Spanish faculties.

In 1843 the Provincial and University Library of Seville was founded, and since its remodeling in 1845-68, it has become one of the most important libraries in Spain, with the acquisition of new books.

=== Hispalense University ===
The Universidad Hispalense, as the University of Seville is known, evolved in terms of its curricula and faculties and in terms of its location in the city during the 19th century with new professorships, the reform of faculties and the emergence of seminars and specialized libraries.

In terms of curricula, theology studies, due to the ecclesiastical influence, were among the last to be taught. The General Plan of 1845 suppressed theology in all Spanish universities except in five educational institutions, including Seville. It was eradicated from all universities in 1852; however, Seville reinstated it again in 1854, only to be definitively closed after the Revolution of 1868.

The Moyano Law (1857) created the Faculty of Exact, Physical and Natural Sciences of the University of Seville.

The reform of 1843 suppressed the teaching of medicine in Seville, with classes ceasing in the city in 1845 and moving to the city of Cadiz, in full swing. The Provincial and University Library was also in charge of the Library of the Faculty of Medicine in Cadiz. In 1868 the Free School of Medicine was created in Seville. In 1917, the Faculty of Medicine was founded in the city of Seville.

After a major remodeling, the University of Seville moved to the Real Fabrica de Tabacos between 1954 and 1956.  The transformation of the building was a work of great significance, carried out by the architects Alberto Balbontín de Orta, Delgado Roig and Toro Buiza.

Initially it housed the Rector&#x27;s Office and the Faculties of Science, Law and Philosophy and Letters. It currently serves as the headquarters of the rectorate and only houses the Faculties of Geography and History and Philology.

In the 1960s, the Higher Technical Schools of Architecture and Industrial Engineering were created. In the following decade, the Schools of Economics, and Pharmacy were created, the Faculty of Sciences was divided, giving rise to the Schools of Biology, Physics, Chemistry and Mathematics, and the University College of La Rábida, the seed of the University of Huelva, was created.

==Influence==
The influence of the University of Seville, from the ecclesiastical point of view, was considerable, though not equal to that of the Universities of Salamanca and of Alcalá. Renowned alumni include Sebastián Antonio de Cortés, Riquelme, Rioja, Luis Germán y Ribón, founder of the Horatian Academy, Martín Alberto Carbajal, Cardinal Belluga, Cardinal Francisco Solís Folch, Marcelo Doye y Pelarte, Bernardo de Torrijos, Francisco Aguilar Ribón, the Abate Marchena, Alberto Lista, and many others who shone in the magistracy, or were distinguished ecclesiastics. The University of Seville had a great influence on the development of the fine arts in Spain. In its shadow the school of the famous master Juan de Mal Lara was founded, and intellects like those of Fernando de Herrera, Juan de Arguijo, and many others were developed, while literary and artistic clubs were formed, like that of Francisco Pacheco, which was a school for both painting and poetry. During the period of secularization and sequestration (1845–57) the University of Seville passed into the control of the State and received a new organization.

At the same time that the royal university was established, the Universidad de Mareantes (university of sea-farers) was developed. Here, the Catholic Monarchs established the Casa de Contratación by a royal decree of 1503, with classes for pilots and seamen, and courses in cosmography, mathematics, military tactics, and artillery. This establishment was of incalculable importance, for it was here that the expeditions to the Indies were organised, and the great Spanish mariners were educated. This form of polytechnic school, which, according to Eden, Bourné, and Alexander von Humboldt, had taught a great deal to Europe, fell into decay in the 17th century, following the fortunes of Spanish science.
==Equality, liberty, justice and pluralism==
The university enjoys the independence afforded by self-governance, which gives it a certain flexibility that may work to advantage in the hiring of professors and lecturers. The ancient motto of the university is: &quot;Equality, Liberty, Justice and Pluralism&quot;.
The university&#x27;s stated mission is to educate students who will do the research and development necessary to scientific and technological innovation. This is reflected in the number of degrees offered; students attending the university have a choice of 65 different subjects and one of the widest ranges of academic and sporting facilities in Spain, making it a popular university for both Spanish and international students. In 2004 it had 73,350 students spread on different campuses, being second in number of students among Spanish universities.

==Campus internationalization==
Since 1994, North American exchange students have been able to take classes taught by University of Seville faculty members in Spanish in the Faculty of Philology and the Faculty of Geography and History. As of Fall 2009, the university has agreements with 15 international organizations including the Council on International Educational Exchange, the College Consortium for International Studies, International Studies Abroad, SUNY New Paltz and Wells College. and St. John&#x27;s University. The University of Seville has had a partnership with the Real Colegio Complutense at Harvard University since 2015.

Built in the 18th century, Seville&#x27;s tobacco factory was the largest industrial building in the world at the time and remained a tobacco factory until the 1950s. This building is also the setting for the renowned opera, &quot;Carmen&quot;, by Bizet. Carmen was a fictional worker in the tobacco factory, the original story being a novella by Prosper Mérimée. This building houses two of the university&#x27;s faculties: the School of Literature and Philology, and the School of Geography and History.

Other campuses and faculties are located throughout Seville, including the Health Science schools in La Macarena, the Business School in Nervion, the Engineering School and School of Communications in La Cartuja and the Languages Institute (Instituto de Idiomas) and Science Schools in Romina

<text>The dinar () is the name of the principal currency unit in several countries near the Mediterranean Sea, with a more widespread historical use. The English word &quot;dinar&quot; is the transliteration of the Arabic دينار (&quot;dīnār&quot;), which was borrowed via the Syriac &quot;dīnarā&quot; from the Latin &quot;dēnārius&quot;.

The modern gold dinar is a projected bullion gold coin, and is not issued as an official currency by any state.

== History ==
The modern dinar&#x27;s historical antecedents are the gold dinar and the silver dirham, the main coin of the medieval Islamic empires, first issued in AH 77 (696–697 AD) (Late Antiquity) by Caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan. The word &quot;dinar&quot; derives from the Latin word &quot;&quot;dēnārius&quot;,&quot; a silver coin of ancient Rome, which was first minted about c. 211 BC.

The Kushan Empire introduced a gold coin known as the &quot;dīnāra&quot; in India in the 1st century AD; the Gupta Empire and its successors up to the 6th century adopted the coin.

The 8th century English king Offa of Mercia minted copies of Abbasid dinars struck in 774 by Caliph Al-Mansur with &quot;Offa Rex&quot; centred on the reverse. The moneyer likely had no understanding of Arabic as the Arabic text contains many errors. Such coins may have been produced for trade with Islamic Spain. These coins are called a Mancus, which is also derived from the Arabic language.

<text>In mathematics, an algebraic group is an algebraic variety endowed with a group structure that is compatible with its structure as an algebraic variety. Thus the study of algebraic groups belongs both to algebraic geometry and group theory.

Many groups of geometric transformations are algebraic groups; for example, orthogonal groups, general linear groups, projective groups, Euclidean groups, etc. Many matrix groups are also algebraic. Other algebraic groups occur naturally in algebraic geometry, such as elliptic curves and Jacobian varieties.

An important class of algebraic groups is given by the affine algebraic groups, those whose underlying algebraic variety is an affine variety; they are exactly the algebraic subgroups of the general linear group, and are therefore also called &quot;linear algebraic groups&quot;. Another class is formed by the abelian varieties, which are the algebraic groups whose underlying variety is a projective variety. Chevalley&#x27;s structure theorem states that every algebraic group can be constructed from groups in those two families.

== Definitions ==
Formally, an algebraic group over a field formula_1 is an algebraic variety formula_2 over formula_1, together with a distinguished element formula_4 (the neutral element), and regular maps formula_5 (the multiplication operation) and formula_6 (the inversion operation) that satisfy the group axioms.

=== Examples ===
* The &quot;additive group&quot;: the affine line formula_7 endowed with addition and opposite as group operations is an algebraic group. It is called the additive group (because its formula_1-points are isomorphic as a group to the additive group of formula_1), and usually denoted by formula_10. 
* The &quot;multiplicative group&quot;: Let formula_11 be the affine variety defined by the equation formula_12 in the affine plane formula_13. The functions formula_14 and formula_15 are regular on formula_11, and they satisfy the group axioms (with neutral element formula_17). The algebraic group formula_11 is called multiplicative group, because its formula_1-points are isomorphic to the multiplicative group of the field formula_1 (an isomorphism is given by formula_21 ; note that the subset of invertible elements does not define an algebraic subvariety in formula_7). 
* The special linear group formula_23 is an algebraic group: it is given by the algebraic equation formula_24 in the affine space formula_25 (identified with the space of formula_26-by-formula_26 matrices), multiplication of matrices is regular and the formula for the inverse in terms of the adjugate matrix shows that inversion is regular as well on matrices with determinant 1. 
* The general linear group formula_28 of invertible matrices over a field formula_1 is an algebraic group. It can be realised as a subvariety in formula_30 in much the same way as the multiplicative group in the previous example. 
* A non-singular cubic curve in the projective plane formula_31 with a specified point can be endowed with a geometrically defined group law that makes it into an algebraic group (see elliptic curve).

=== Related definitions ===

An algebraic subgroup of an algebraic group formula_2 is a subvariety formula_33 of formula_2 that is also a subgroup of formula_2 (that is, the maps formula_5 and formula_6 defining the group structure map formula_38 and formula_33, respectively, into formula_33).

A &quot;morphism&quot; between two algebraic groups formula_41 is a regular map formula_42 that is also a group homomorphism. Its kernel is an algebraic subgroup of formula_2, its image is an algebraic subgroup of formula_44.

Quotients in the category of algebraic groups are more delicate to deal with. An algebraic subgroup is said to be normal if it is stable under every inner automorphism (which are regular maps). If formula_33 is a normal algebraic subgroup of formula_2 then there exists an algebraic group formula_47 and a surjective morphism formula_48 such that formula_33 is the kernel of formula_50. Note that if the field formula_1 is not algebraically closed, the morphism of groups formula_52 may not be surjective (the default of surjectivity is measured by Galois cohomology).

=== Lie algebra of an algebraic group ===
Similarly to the Lie group–Lie algebra correspondence, to an algebraic group over a field formula_1 is associated a Lie algebra over formula_1. As a vector space the Lie algebra is isomorphic to the tangent space at the identity element. The Lie bracket can be constructed from its interpretation as a space of derivations.

=== Alternative definitions ===
A more sophisticated definition of an algebraic group over a field formula_1 is that it is that of a group scheme over formula_1 (group schemes can more generally be defined over commutative rings).

Yet another definition of the concept is to say that an algebraic group over formula_1 is a group object in the category of algebraic varieties over formula_1.

== Affine algebraic groups ==
An algebraic group is said to be affine if its underlying algebraic variety is an affine variety. Among the examples above the additive, multiplicative groups and the general and special linear groups are affine. Using the action of an affine algebraic group on its coordinate ring it can be shown that every affine algebraic group is a linear (or matrix group), meaning that it is isomorphic to an algebraic subgroup of the general linear group.

For example the additive group can be embedded in formula_59 by the morphism formula_60.

There are many examples of such groups beyond those given previously: 
* orthogonal and symplectic groups are affine algebraic groups. 
* unipotent groups. 
* algebraic tori. 
* certain semidirect products, for instance Jet groups, or some solvable groups such as that of invertible triangular matrices.

Linear algebraic groups can be classified to a certain extent. Levi&#x27;s theorem states that every such is (essentially) a semidirect product of a unipotent group (its unipotent radical) with a reductive group. In turn reductive groups are decomposed as (again essentially) a product of their center (an algebraic torus) with a semisimple group. The latter are classified over algebraically closed fields via their Lie algebra. The classification over arbitrary fields is more involved but still well-understood. If can be made very explicit in some cases, for example over the real or p-adic fields, and thereby over number fields via local-global principles.

== Abelian varieties ==
Abelian varieties are connected projective algebraic groups, for instance elliptic curves. They are always commutative. They arise naturally in various situations in algebraic geometry and number theory, for example as the Jacobian variety of a curve.

== Structure theorem for general algebraic groups ==
Not all algebraic groups are linear groups or abelian varieties, for instance some group schemes occurring naturally in arithmetic geometry are neither. Chevalley&#x27;s structure theorem asserts that every connected algebraic group is an extension of an abelian variety by a linear algebraic group. More precisely, if &quot;K&quot; is a perfect field, and &quot;G&quot; a connected algebraic group over &quot;K&quot;, there exists a unique normal closed subgroup &quot;H&quot; in &quot;G&quot;, such that &quot;H&quot; is a connected linear algebraic group and &quot;G&quot;/&quot;H&quot; an abelian variety.

== Connectedness ==

As an algebraic variety formula_2 carries a Zariski topology. It is not in general a group topology, i.e. the group operations may not be continuous for this topology (because Zariski topology on the product is not the product of Zariski topologies on the factors).

An algebraic group is said to be &quot;connected&quot; if the underlying algebraic variety is connected for the Zariski topology. For an algebraic group this means that it is not the union of two proper algebraic subsets.

Examples of groups that are not connected are given by the algebraic subgroup of formula_26th roots of unity in the multiplicative group formula_11 (each point is a Zariski-closed subset so it is not connected for formula_64). This group is generally denoted by formula_65. Another non-connected group are orthogonal group in even dimension (the determinant gives a surjective morphism to formula_66).

More generally every finite group is an algebraic group (it can be realised as a finite, hence Zariski-closed, subgroup of some formula_28 by Cayley&#x27;s theorem). In addition it is both affine and projective. Thus, in particular for classification purposes, it is natural to restrict statements to connected algebraic group.

== Algebraic groups over local fields and Lie groups ==
If the field formula_1 is a local field (for instance the real or complex numbers, or a p-adic field) and formula_2 is a formula_1-group then the group formula_71 is endowed with the analytic topology coming from any embedding into a projective space formula_72 as a quasi-projective variety. This is a group topology, and it makes formula_71 into a topological group. Such groups are important examples in the general theory of topological groups.

If formula_74 or formula_75 then this makes formula_71 into a Lie group. Not all Lie groups can be obtained via this procedure, for example the universal cover of SL2(R), or the quotient of the Heisenberg group by an infinite normal discrete subgroup. An algebraic group over the real or complex numbers may have closed subgroups (in the analytic topology) that do not have the same connected component of the identity as any algebraic subgroup.

== Coxeter groups and algebraic groups ==

There are a number of analogous results between algebraic groups and Coxeter groups – for instance, the number of elements of the symmetric group is formula_77, and the number of elements of the general linear group over a finite field is (up to some factor) the &quot;q&quot;-factorial formula_78; thus the symmetric group behaves as though it were a linear group over &quot;the field with one element&quot;. This is formalized by the field with one element, which considers Coxeter groups to be simple algebraic groups over the field with one element.
