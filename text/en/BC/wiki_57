<text>Román Baldorioty de Castro (23 February 1822 – 30 September 1889) was a leading Puerto Rican  abolitionist and spokesman for the right to self-determination of Puerto Rico. In 1870, he was elected as a deputy in the Cortes Generales, the Spanish parliament, where he promoted abolition of slavery. In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro was the founder of the &quot;Partido Autonomista&quot; (Autonomist Party), also known as &quot;Partido Autonomista Puro&quot; (Pure Autonomous Party), &quot;Partido Histórico&quot; (Historic Party), and &quot;Partido Ortodoxo&quot; (Orthodox Party).

==Early years==
Baldorioty de Castro was born in Guaynabo to a poor family. His family moved to San Juan when he was young, where he received his primary education as a student of the noted educator, Rafael Cordero. After completing his elementary education, he enrolled in &quot;El Seminario Conciliar de Idelfonso&quot;, which at that time was the most organized institution in Puerto Rico. He spent most of his adolescent years studying, and finished with one of the best averages in his class.

Baldorioty de Castro was granted a scholarship, which he used for further study in Spain. He collected the money necessary to travel and departed to Spain in the company of three fellow Puerto Ricans, two students and a professor. Before establishing a permanent residence in Madrid, the group traveled to several Spanish provinces, where they visited some of the country&#x27;s tourist sites. Among the places visited were locations in Cordoba, Seville, Andújar and Bailén where they met Alberto Lista, an educator from Spain.

The three other students (who traveled with Baldorioty de Castro) contracted smallpox shortly after beginning their academic studies in the Central University of Madrid. Baldorioty de Castro cared for them, but two of the youths died from complications of the disease. Baldorioty de Castro was offered a chance to return to Puerto Rico but he declined. He continued his studies along with the only survivor and graduated with a degree in physics and mathematical sciences from the university. Dr. José Gualberto Padilla together with Román Baldorioty de Castro, founded the Puerto Rican chapter of the Sociedad Económica de los Amigos del País and called it &quot;La Sociedad Económica de Amigos del País en Puerto Rico&quot; (the Economic Friends of Puerto Rico). In 1847 the Sociedad de Amigos del País de Puerto Rico named Baldorioty de Castro the organization&#x27;s correspondent in Spain. On 21 March 1851 he was granted permission to transfer to France to continue his studies. Baldorioty de Castro moved to Paris, where he attended the Central School of Arts.

==Political and professional careers==
In 1853, after seven years of study, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico and married Isabel Matilde Díaz y Ruiz, the granddaughter of Lieutenant Francisco Díaz, hero of the Battle of San Juan of 1797. Upon his return, he noticed that there was political tension, because of the differences between the governor in office and the political and educational groups in Puerto Rico.

Baldorioty de Castro began promoting the restructuring of the social, political and educational establishments. These contributions led Fernando Norzagaray, the colony&#x27;s incumbent governor to offer him the position of mayor of one of the island&#x27;s municipalities (towns). Baldorioty de Castro declined the offer, based on his ideals. At the time, the government displayed no interest in promoting education among the &quot;Criollos&quot; of the island. Two years earlier, the governor had imposed the &quot;Reglamento del Jornalero&quot;, which promoted a more ample labor base by reducing the amount of unemployed citizens. However, this measure was criticized for its elements that were used to increase the wealth of employers. As a consequence, the merits of said law were reconsidered and a group led by Baldorioty de Castro was selected to decide its validity. In 1853, he became a member of the Liberal Reform Party of Puerto Rico.

===Educator===
Besides politics, Baldorioty de Castro also loved teaching. He taught Botany and Maritime Sciences at the School of Commerce, Agriculture and Maritime Studies in San Juan. In January 1854, the Councilor Seminary selected Baldorioty de Castro as its botany professor. On November of that year, Puerto Rico&#x27;s Commerce and Foment Joint selected him to work as a professor in a Nautical School, where he taught Maritime Studies.

The colonial government discovered that there was fertile terrain in the islands of Mona and Monito in 1856. After the discovery, they selected Baldorioty de Castro as the supervisor of a series of experiments to determine the terrain&#x27;s components.
In 1857, the cattle industry in Puerto Rico began having difficulties, when the number of animals diminished significantly. To resolve this problem, the island&#x27;s Economic Society formed a commission composed of Baldorioty de Castro, José Julián Acosta and Juan Hernández Arbizu.

Baldorioty de Castro proposed that geometry classes be included in the curriculum of elementary schools in Puerto Rico, which was accepted by the pertinent authority. On 2 January 1858, the Economic Society unanimously named him the Secretary of the Studies Commission. On 4 June 1860, the organization named him spokesman of a commission to promote conservation of the island&#x27;s natural resources. Later that year, Baldorioty de Castro represented Puerto Rico as a delegate in the Spanish Parliament, serving for five years until 1865. On 17 September 1864, he was certified as an applied mechanics professor and worked for a salary of thirty-five dollars a month.

===Spanish parliament===
While working in the Spanish Parliament, he made the most of his position and encouraged the abolition of slavery in Puerto Rico and Cuba, and drafting a constitution to guarantee Puerto Ricans more political rights. On 4 November 1866, he was named Puerto Rico&#x27;s representative to Paris&#x27; 1867 Universal Exposition. He served as a critic and subsequently wrote a review titled &quot;Exposición Universal de París en 1867. Memoria presentada a la Comisión Provincial de Puerto Rico&quot;. After completing his participation in Paris, Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico.

There were rising tensions between groups that supported the abolition of slavery in the island and the Spanish colonial government. This led to protests and demands by the local &quot;Criollo&quot; population and influenced several revolutionaries, which led to the Grito de Lares. Baldorioty de Castro did not promote the armed revolution; instead he chose to debate the several conflicts and issues on diplomatic venues. After the revolution attempts, a new superior provisional government was established in the island. This government promoted a union between the conflicting parties in order to establish reforms in the government&#x27;s structure. In line with the proposed solution, Baldorioty de Castro proposed a conciliation of these groups, but the efforts to unify the opposing views was unsuccessful. After this, he traveled to Madrid, under political pressure, and presented the island&#x27;s status situation to the respective authorities.

He began writing several documents that strongly criticized the colonial government and wrote a report listing the elements that he felt were being used by the administration that were affecting the island&#x27;s social and economic aspects. In January 1867, Baldorioty de Castro received a communication from Puerto Rico&#x27;s Superior Instruction Juncture, notifying him that he was selected as a member of the Test Commission, where he was in charge of monitoring tests being issued in physics and the natural sciences.

In 1870, he was named deputy to the Spanish Parliament, after the governor in office had revoked his accreditation as an educator. There he continued to speak about his cause. Baldorioty de Castro became known as &quot;The Father of Puerto Rican Autonomy&quot;. On 19 November 1872, Ramon Baldorioty de Castro together with Luis Padial, Julio Vizcarrondo and the Spanish Minister of Overseas Affairs, Segismundo Moret, presented a proposal for the abolition of slavery. On 22 March 1873, the Spanish Government approved the proposal, which became known as the Moret Law.

==Later years==
Baldorioty de Castro returned to Puerto Rico in 1873 and went to live in the City of Ponce. There, he founded the newspaper &quot;El Derecho&quot; (The Law). He was also the founder of a weekly paper called &quot;La Crónica,&quot; in which he expressed his ideas on autonomy for the island.

In 1887, Baldorioty de Castro co-founded, along with José de Diego, the Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico. He named a young and upcoming politician, Antonio R. Barceló, the position of party Secretary. The Autonomist Party of Puerto Rico became one of Puerto Rico&#x27;s first political parties. Its credo was that Puerto Rico should pick its own government and should have a representative in the Spanish Parliament.

The Spanish government, however, considered Baldorioty de Castro a dangerous person and a dissenter and had him jailed in Fort San Felipe del Morro in San Juan. Although he was not in jail for long and was soon released, his health suffered greatly during this imprisonment. Román Baldorioty de Castro died in Ponce on 30 September 1889. He is buried in Ponce&#x27;s &quot;Cementerio Viejo&quot; cemetery which was renamed &quot;Panteón Nacional Román Baldorioty de Castro&quot;.

==Legacy==
The cities of Bayamón, Juana Díaz, San Germán and San Juan have honored the memory of Baldorioty de Castro by naming plazas after him. Puerto Rico Highway 26, called the Román Baldorioty de Castro Expressway, is the main highway to the Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport. In Puerto Rico&#x27;s capital city, where the Baldorioty de Castro Expressway meets the Condado Lagoon in the Miramar neighborhood of Santurce, an obelisk was constructed in the center of the city park surrounding the lagoon. The obelisk is in honor of Baldorioty de Castro. A bronze statue of Baldority de Castro stands at the base of the statue as a gift of the people of Puerto Rico. There are schools named after him in other areas of Puerto Rico. The province of Azua de Compostela, Dominican Republic, honored him by naming one of the capital city&#x27;s secondary education institutions after him: Liceo de Estudios Secundarios Román Baldorioty de Castro.

<doc id="248694" wikidata="Q24764" url="?curid=248694" title="Municipalities of the Philippines">
<text>A municipality (; ; ; ; ; ; ; ) is a local government unit (LGU) in the Philippines. It is distinct from &quot;city&quot;, which is a different category of local government unit. Provinces of the Philippines are divided into cities and municipalities, which in turn, are divided into barangays (formerly barrios) – &quot;villages&quot;. , there are 1,493 municipalities across the country.

A municipality is the official term for, and the official local equivalent of, a [[town]], the latter being its archaic term and in all of its literal local translations including Filipino. Both terms are interchangeable.

A municipal district is a now-defunct local government unit; previously certain areas were created first as municipal districts before they were converted into municipalities.

==History==
The era of the formation of municipalities in the Philippines started during the Spanish rule, in which the colonial government founded hundreds of towns and villages across the archipelago modeled after towns and villages in Spain. They were then grouped together along with a centralized town center called &quot;cabecera&quot; or &quot;poblacion&quot; where the ayuntamiento, or town hall, was located; the poblacion served as the nucleus of each municipality. Only the communities that were permanently settled under the reduccion system, and have fully Christianized, are allowed to form municipalities, while others that have not yet been fully converted are to be subdued until conditions permitted for them to be incorporated as municipalities. As time passed, municipalities were created out of already existing ones, leading to them becoming smaller in area over time. Each municipality was governed by a &quot;capitan&quot;, usually a member of native principalia of the town, who have the task of remitting revenues to the central government in Manila. Ever since its inception to the present day, the term &quot;municipality&quot; holds the same definition as &quot;town&quot; when the first towns grew in size under the Spanish &quot;pueblo&quot; system (&quot;pueblo&quot; meaning &quot;town&quot; in Spanish language) to be granted municipal charters, hence the current official term for such type of settlements.

During the American administration, the municipal system put in place by the preceding Spanish authorities was preserved and at the same time reformed with greater inclusiveness among all Filipinos. Municipal districts, which were in essence unincorporated areas presided over by local tribal chiefs set up by American authorities, were created for the first time in 1914. More municipalities were created during this time, especially in Mindanao where there was a massive influx of settlers from the Luzon and the Visayas. After a while the independent Republic of the Philippines was declared in 1946, all municipal districts were dissolved and were absorbed into or broken into municipalities. The latest guidelines in the creation of new municipalities were introduced in 1991 with the issuance of the Local Government Code.

==Responsibilities and powers==
Municipalities have some autonomy from the National Government of the Republic of the Philippines under the &quot;Local Government Code of 1991&quot;. They have been granted corporate personality enabling them to enact local policies and laws, enforce them, and govern their jurisdictions. They can enter into contracts and other transactions through their elected and appointed officials and can tax. They are tasked with enforcing all laws, whether local or national. The National Government assists and supervises the local government to make sure that they do not violate national law. Local Governments have their own executive and legislative branches and the checks and balances between these two major branches, along with their separation, are more pronounced than that of the national government. The Judicial Branch of the Republic of the Philippines also caters to the needs of local government units. Local governments, such as a municipalities, do not have their own judicial branch: their judiciary is the same as that of the national government.

==Organization==
According to Chapter II, Title II, Book III of &quot;Republic Act 7160&quot; or the &quot;Local Government Code of 1991&quot;, a municipality shall mainly have a mayor (&quot;alkalde&quot;), a vice mayor (&quot;ikalawang alkalde&quot;/&quot;bise alkalde&quot;) and members (&quot;kagawad&quot;) of the legislative branch Sangguniang Bayan alongside a secretary to the said legislature.

The following positions are also required for all municipalities across the Philippines:

* Treasurer
* Assessor
* Accountant
* Budget Officer
* Planning and Development Coordinator
* Engineer/Building Official
* Health Officer
* Civil Registrar
* Municipal Disaster Risks Reduction and Management Officer
Depending on the need to do so, the municipal mayor may also appoint the following municipal positions:

* Administrator
* Legal Officer
* Agriculturist
* Architect
* Information Officer
* Tourism Officer
* Municipal Environment and Natural Resources Officer
* Municipal Social Welfare and Development Officer
===Duties and functions===
As mentioned in Title II, Book III of Republic Act 7160, the municipal mayor is the chief executive officer of the municipal government and shall determine guidelines on local policies and direct formulation of development plans. These responsibilities shall be under approval of the Sangguniang Bayan.

The vice mayor (&quot;bise-alkalde&quot;) shall sign all warrants drawn on the municipal treasury. Being presiding officer of the Sangguniang Bayan (English: Municipal Council), he can as well appoint members of the municipal legislature except its twelve (12) regular members or &quot;kagawad&quot; who are also elected every local election alongside the municipal mayor and vice mayor. In circumstances where the mayor permanently or temporarily vacates the position, he shall assume executive duties and functions.

While the vice mayor presides over the legislature, she or he cannot vote unless the necessity of tie-breaking arises. Laws or ordinances proposed by the Sangguniang Bayan, however, may be approved or vetoed by the mayor. If approved, they become local ordinances. If the mayor neither vetoes nor approves the proposal of the Sangguniang Bayan for ten (10) days from the time of receipt, the proposal becomes law as if it had been signed. If vetoed, the draft is sent back to the Sangguniang Bayan. The latter may override the mayor by a vote of at least two-thirds (2/3) of all its members, in which case, the proposal becomes law.

A municipality, upon reaching certain requirements (such as minimum population size, and minimum annual revenue) may opt to become a city. First, a bill must be passed in Congress, then signed into law by the President and then the residents would vote in the resulting plebiscite to accept or reject cityhood. One benefit in being a city is that the city government gets more budget, but taxes are much higher than in municipalities.

==Income classification==
Republic Act (RA) No. 11964, otherwise known as the “Automatic Income Classification of Local Government Units Act”, was signed by the Philippine President Ferdinand “Bongbong” Marcos Jr. on October 26, 2023. The law classifies municipalities into five (5) classes, according to their income ranges, based on the average annual regular income for three fiscal years preceding a general income reclassification. The classifications are as follows:

<text>Elijah Sky Blue Allman (born July 10, 1976), known professionally as P. Exeter Blue I (Phillips Exeter Blue), is an American musician, and the son of singer Cher and her second husband, Gregg Allman; he is the half-brother of Chaz Bono, Delilah Allman, Michael Allman, Layla Allman, and Devon Allman. He is the lead vocalist, guitarist and lyricist of the industrial rock band Deadsy.

==Career==
Allman is the singer and guitarist for the rock band Deadsy which, prior to its hiatus in April 2007, consisted of Alec Püre on drums, Dr. Nner on synthesizer, Carlton Megalodon on Ztar, and Jens Funke on bass. Deadsy released two albums: 2002&#x27;s &quot;Commencement&quot;, and &quot;Phantasmagore&quot;, which came out on August 22, 2006. Many of the themes used by Allman in Deadsy have been heavily influenced by the 1955 film &quot;This Island Earth&quot;.

He was given his first guitar by Kiss bassist Gene Simmons, and at age 13 he went on tour as a guitarist with Cher; he appears as a guitarist in the music video for her song &quot;If I Could Turn Back Time&quot;. In 1994, he auditioned for the spot of guitarist for Nine Inch Nails, but ended up losing the spot to Robin Finck.

He has worked with Thirty Seconds to Mars for the band&#x27;s self-titled debut album. and has also provided guest vocals on a variety of songs for other bands including Orgy, Coal Chamber and Sugar Ray.

==Personal life==
Allman attended the Hyde School in Bath, Maine, graduating in 1994.

Allman has dated Bijou Phillips, Heather Graham, Kate Hudson, and Paris Hilton.

Through his mother Cher, Allman is of Armenian, Irish, English, and German ancestry.

On December 1, 2013, he married Marieangela King, &quot;Queenie&quot;, an English singer, of the band KING and sister of Jazzy and Ruby King from the British pop duo Blonde Electra. The couple broke up on April 20, 2020, and Allman filed for divorce the following year. The divorce has been dismissed and the couple remain together.

In 2014, Allman admitted that he began taking drugs at age 11 and battled heroin addiction for years, but claimed that he has been sober since 2008.

In 2023, Allman&#x27;s wife, Marieangela King, alleged in a court filing that, on his mother&#x27;s orders, Allman had been kidnapped from a hotel room where they had been trying to &quot;work out their marriage&quot; on their anniversary in November 2022. King said that she did not know where he was and had no way to contact him.

In 2023, Allman&#x27;s mother, Cher, filed for a conservatorship over Allman due to his ongoing substance abuse issues. Prior to the hearing on January 5, 2024, Allman withdrew his divorce filing and retained attorneys to contest the conservatorship. He attended the hearing with his attorneys and successfully argued to postpone the hearing due to Cher&#x27;s attorneys’ failure to provide proper notice. Cher&#x27;s motion for the temporary conservatorship was denied on January 30, 2024.

<text>Znojmo (; ) is a town in the South Moravian Region of the Czech Republic. It has about 34,000 inhabitants. Znojmo is the historical and cultural centre of southwestern Moravia and the second most populated town in the South Moravian Region. The historic centre of Znojmo is well preserved and is protected by law as an urban monument reservation.

==Administrative division==
Znojmo consists of nine municipal parts (in brackets population according to the 2021 census):

*Znojmo (26,634)
*Derflice (114)
*Kasárna (158)
*Konice (383)
*Mramotice (397)
*Načeratice (340)
*Oblekovice (1,299)
*Popice (187)
*Přímětice (4,224)
==Etymology==
The origin of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain. According to the most likely theories, it was derived either from the Old Czech words &quot;znoj&quot; (i.e. &#x27;heat&#x27;) and &quot;znojný&quot; (&#x27;exposed to heat&#x27;), or from the personal name Znojem or Znojim.

==Geography==
Znojmo is located about southwest of Brno, near the border with Austria. It lies mostly in the Jevišovice Uplands, with only a small part of the municipal territory in the south extending into the Dyje–Svratka Valley. The highest point is at above sea level. The town is situated mainly on a rock outcropping on the steep left bank of the Thaya River. The western part of the municipal territory lies within the Podyjí National Park.

==History==
A settlement at the site possibly already existed during the time of the Great Moravian Empire in the 9th century, however, the main Great Moravian gord was situated on the hill across the Gránický brook. From about 1055, Znojmo Castle served as the residence of a Přemyslid principality within the Bohemian March of Moravia and a strategically important outpost near the border with the Bavarian March of Austria in the south. In 1101, Luitpold of Znojmo, Duke of Moravia, built the Rotunda of Saint Catherine in the castle.

The Znojmo Castle was seized and demolished by Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia in 1145. In 1190, Duke Conrad II founded the Louka Monastery of the Premonstratensian order at Znojmo.

The first written mention of Znojmo is from 1226. The royal town of Znojmo was founded shortly before 1226 by King Ottokar I of Bohemia on the plains in front of the rebuilt castle and was fortified. It was one of the first royal towns in Moravia. At that time, the burghers were mainly German speaking, while the surrounding villages were Czech speaking. 

The town survived the Hussite Wars unscathed, when the Hussites failed to capture the town, and prospered. In the 15th and 16th centuries, networks of burgher houses with a system of underground passages were built as a part of fortifications. The Renaissance and late Gothic houses are preserved to this day. The development ended with the Thirty Years&#x27; War. Znojmo was conquered and ransacked repeatedly. It took over a hundred years for the town to recover.

From the 19th century, Znojmo is best known as the site for the Armistice of Znaim concluded there on 12 July 1809 after the Battle of Znaim, following the decisive Battle of Wagram, between Emperor Napoleon and the archduke Charles, which had taken place seven days earlier.

Since the end of World War I, Znojmo was within the newly established state of Czechoslovakia, except for 1938–1945 during the Nazi German occupation when it was administered as part of the Reichsgau Niederdonau. The German population of the town was expelled after World War II according to the Beneš decrees.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Znojmo is famous for local production of cucumbers, pickled in the original sweet-sour and spicy pickle, whose cultivation in the Znojmo region was introduced in 1571 by the abbot of the Louka Monastery, George II. The special taste is also the result of local type of cucumbers, cultivation method, soil, climatic conditions, processing and also the packaging in which they are kept.

Thanks to the favorable climatic conditions, the town is also successful in winery and fruit growing. It is the centre of viticulture of the Znojemská wine sub-region.

==Transport==
The I/38 (part of the European route E59) from Jihlava to the Czech-Austrian border passes through Znojmo. It forks in the centre of Znojmo and connects the town with Brno as the I/53 road. 

There is a railway station with railway lines leading in three directions: to Vienna in Austria, to Břeclav and to Okříšky.

==Culture==

Znojmo is known for its Znojmo Vintage Festival which takes place every September. The main attraction of the festival is the historical parade commemorating the visit of King John of Bohemia to Znojmo in 1327. 

The annual Gherkin Feast is dedicated to tradition of growing gherkins in the region.

==Sport==
1. SC Znojmo FK is a local football club competing in the Moravian–Silesian Football League (third tier of the Czech football league system).

Orli Znojmo is an ice hockey club playing in the Czech 2nd Liga (third tier).

==Sights==
The Gothic Church of St. Nicholas and the late Gothic Town Hall tower are the most recognizable landmarks. The original church was founded in around 1100, and replaced by a new church gradually built from 1338 until the late 15th century. The town hall with its high tower was built in 1445–1448.

Overlooking the Thaya River valley, on the edge of the medieval city, is the Znojmo Castle, which was founded by the Přemyslid dukes in the 11th century. The only remaining trace of this castle is the Romanesque Rotunda of Saint Catherine, the interior of which is covered with 11th-century frescoes depicting scenes from the Bible and illustrating the life of Přemysl the Ploughman. The rotunda is protected as a national cultural monument.

Beneath the grounds of the old town, there is a vast labyrinth of connected passageways and cellars called the Znojmo Catacombs. This system was developed in the 14th and 15th centuries for defence purposes, and it contains wells, drainage, fireplaces, trap doors and escapeways that lead beyond the fortifications of the town. The catacombs are the largest system of underground corridors and cellars in the Czech Republic – they are almost long and up to 4 levels deep.

The Church of Saint Michael the Archangel was probably built in the 12th century. It is the second most significant church in the town, after Church of Saint Nicholas. The church was first mentioned in 1226 and completely rebuilt in the late Gothic style in 1508. It is considered a monument of national importance.

The Premonstratensian Louka Monastery is among the most valuable buildings in Znojmo. The monastery was founded in 1190, but the current monastery building was built in two phases in the years 1748–1756 and 1761–1778. Architecturally, it is a monument of transnational importance, protected as a national cultural monument. The monastery complex includes the Church of the Assumption of the Virgin Mary and Saint Wenceslaus. It is originally a Romanesque basilica with a Gothic presbytery, which was rebuilt in the Baroque style at the end of the 17th century.

<doc id="248705" wikidata="Q1369404" url="?curid=248705" title="Hòa Hảo">
<text>Hòa Hảo is a Vietnamese new religious movement. It is described either as a syncretistic folk religion or as a sect of Buddhism. It was founded in Cochinchina 1939 by Huỳnh Phú Sổ (1920–47), who is regarded as a saint by its devotees. It is one of the major religions of Vietnam with between one million and eight million adherents, mostly in the Mekong Delta.

The religious philosophy of Hòa Hảo, which rose from the Miền Tây region of the Mekong Delta, is essentially Buddhist. It reforms and revises the older Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương tradition of the region, and possesses quasi-millenarian elements. Hòa Hảo is an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship, animistic rites, elements of Confucian doctrine, and the White Lotus religion, transformed and adapted to the mores and customs of the peasants of the region. Coming from the remote edges of Southern Vietnam, it opposes urban life and prefers a communitarian lifestyle. Unlike orthodox Buddhism, Hòa Hảo eschews elaborate rituals and temples, maintains no monastic order, and teaches home practice. It also advocates that each devotee can have direct communion with the Buddha, and that inner faith is more important than external rites. Regular Hòa Hảo rites are limited to four prayers a day, while the devotees are to maintain the Three Fundamental Bonds and Five Constant Virtues.

The influence of colonial overlords, the growing intensity of war from the late 1930s to the mid-1970s, and the attendant ideological conflicts all shaped the inception and later development of Hòa Hảo. It was, along with Hồ Chí Minh&#x27;s Việt Minh and another religious movement known as Cao Đài, one of the first groups to engage in military conflict with colonial powers, first the French and then the Japanese. Hòa Hảo flourished under the Japanese occupation of World War II, with its adherents largely being peasants, tenants, and agricultural workers. It transformed into a militant and nationalist religion, and rapidly developed into a private army that operated mainly for the benefit of its leaders, while setting up its own virtually autonomous government in the region. The Hòa Hảo remained an autonomous force in Vietnamese politics after the war, opposing both French colonialists and the Việt Minh movement.

During the First Indochina War, disagreements with other major factions made the Hòa Hảo an aggressive religio-political-military cult. Sổ was kidnapped and executed by the Việt Minh while coming back from an unsuccessful conference to resolve issues with the Communists. Many Hoahaoists hailed him as a Messianic figure who would arrive in a time of crisis. Sổ&#x27;s death led to factionalism, parochialism, and outside organizational influence. The Hòa Hảo led a war against the Communists, being labelled as the &quot;strongest anti-Việt Minh element in the country&quot;. Nevertheless, the Hòa Hảo, along with other religio-political organizations, dominated the political and social scene of Southern Vietnam by the 1950s, claiming a stake in the formation of a non-communist South Vietnam.

After 1954, the Hòa Hảo initiated armed opposition to President Ngô Đình Diệm&#x27;s American-backed government. They controlled various southern and western regions of South Vietnam at the time of Diệm&#x27;s death in 1963. They then led a campaign against Việt Cộng for the defense of their home provinces during the Vietnam War, becoming a major autonomous political force in South Vietnam until the Fall of Saigon in 1975. Disbanded by the new government, the Hòa Hảo were oppressed and struggled for rights following the war. Only in 1999 were they officially recognized by the state, but the government imposes harsh controls on dissenting Hòa Hảo groups that do not follow the state-sanctioned branch.

The Hòa Hảo sought to preserve their religious identity and independence. They made temporary alliances with past enemies. Originally concerned only with religious autonomy, the Hòa Hảo struggled against the French, the Japanese, the Việt Minh, again the French, the newly independent South Vietnam, the Việt Cộng, and the North Vietnamese Army. They enjoyed political influence during post-Diệm regimes of Saigon.

== Designation ==
=== Name ===
Hòa Hảo is a new religious movement and it was named after the founder Huỳnh Phú Sổ&#x27;s native village of Hoa Hao (; ; chữ Hán: ; literally &quot;peace and amicability&quot;), in what is now Thốt Nốt District of An Giang Province, Vietnam. The name is also spelled as &quot;Hoa-Hao&quot;. Another label, &quot;Hoahaoism&quot;, is also rendered as &quot;Hoa Haoism&quot;. It has also been called &quot;Hoa Hao Buddhism&quot; (). The village of Hoa Hao was renamed Phú Mỹ by the contemporary Communist government.

Initially, the followers of the movement were called &quot;Dao Xen&quot;, literally meaning the &quot;Followers of Xen&quot;, in reference to Sổ&#x27;s childhood nickname.

=== Classification ===
The religious group has been traditionally classified as a Buddhist sect. General Joseph Lawton Collins, who served as a U.S. Special Representative in Vietnam, described Hòa Hảo as a &quot;pseudo-religious sect&quot;, adding that it &quot;appealed to the peasants with a veneer of Buddhism and a protective paternalism&quot;. Indeed, the American press of the 1950s labelled Hòa Hảo as &quot;a pseudo-religious sect which follows a perverted form of Buddhism&quot;, and as &quot;a rowdy sect of dissident Buddhists&quot; whose founder &quot;was sent to a lunatic asylum&quot;.

Despite this, other sources refer to it as a distinct syncretistic folk religion.

== Origins ==
Hòa Hảo was founded by Huỳnh Phú Sổ (1919–1947), an ethnic Vietnamese born in 1919 to a Roman Catholic family of small-holders. The religious movement was found in the remote Miền Tây region of the Mekong Delta, which was known as Transbassac under French colonial rule. In the mid-nineteenth century, the Mekong Delta was a rough frontier society; the political power was shaky, social relations were tenuous, and religious currents were diverse. Buddhism, Taoism, Confucianism, and various spirit cults all had differing impacts on the population. The ethnic Vietnamese interacted with Cambodians and Chinese, and everyone was forced to accept French colonial rule in 1867. The religion arose from a tangle of mysticism, magic, and witchcraft, which could be found in most of the region&#x27;s local beliefs. Rooted in earlier Vietnamese anti-colonial religious traditions, the Hòa Hảo philosophy claims to be based on the thoughts of Phật Thầy Tây An (1807–1856), known as Đạo Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương. Tây An, in the 1830s, prophesied the collapse of the Nguyễn Vietnam at the hands of Western powers; the prophecies survived his death and spread throughout the Miền Tây, resulting in two major rebellions in 1875 and 1913 in which the region&#x27;s French administration was nearly deposed.

Sổ received no particular education as a child and did not associate with monks, Confucian-minded thinkers, or Westernized intelligentsia. He was afflicted by an unknown illness since he was 15, a failed candidate for the Cao Đài. This prompted him to leave his native village of Hòa Hảo in 1939 and go to the Bảy Núi range away. There, amid hermits and spiritual leaders, he obtained unorthodox Buddhist knowledge and a composite spiritual education. Sổ founded the religion on the eighteenth day of the fifth lunar month of the year kỷ mão, according to the Vietnamese lunisolar calendar, or 4 July 1939, according to the Gregorian calendar. He declared himself a prophet, and began preaching a doctrine based on faith and simplicity; he traveled throughout Vietnam practicing herbal healing and acupuncture. In the second half of 1939, Sổ&#x27;s declamations were concurrently published. They took the shape of several small collections of texts written in verse (; ) that were distributed to the general populace free of charge.

By the end of the year, Sổ gathered ten thousand followers and by 1940 had a following of over 100,000 converts. Also, Sổ had reached another two million people in Miền Tây through his preaching. The devotees were easily recognizable as they wore amulets that bore the inscription &quot;Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương&quot;. Sổ was certain about the necessity for ordinary peasants to believe in the movement, and their pleas for allegiance were successful. There were two major reasons for his success: the prophecies he made about the outbreak of World War II and the conquest of Southeast Asia by Japan, and his work as a mystical healer—his patients claimed to have been miraculously cured of all manner of serious illnesses after seeing him, when Western medicine had failed. He proclaimed himself as the reincarnation of the Buddha, and he was regarded as such. According to the Austrian politician Joseph Buttinger, the masses held the movement&#x27;s native origins in high regard.

Sổ became a wildly popular leader as his faithful group grew in size. His influence quickly expanded beyond religious matters, and he became a powerful figure in lay affairs as well. The Hòa Hảo grew from a purely religious movement to encompass an impressive lay power structure centered on Cần Tho Province. Sổ&#x27;s religious prescriptions quickly merged with nationalist, anti-colonial sentiment, and he quickly rose to prominence as a key nationalist figure. The group grew into the Mekong Delta&#x27;s most powerful nationalist force, with strong sentiment against the colonial French rulers and the landlords who dominated the agriculture of Cochinchina. The Hòa Hảo played a crucial role in the anti-colonial, nationalist fervor that grew in the years leading up to World War II. It ultimately became a homegrown political movement in the region. Despite this, the Hòa Hảo, according to Edwin E. Moise, were patriotic and anti-nationalist in nature. He argued that they were too small to have a realistic possibility of governing a national government, thus a powerful central government had to imply control of their districts by a government ruled by people, not beliefs; they preferred a weaker government in order to gain a &quot;de facto&quot; autonomy. Meanwhile, other anti-French organizations arose, the most notable of which was the Indochinese Communist Party&#x27;s (ICP) Việt Minh, which was led by Hồ Chí Minh and became the sole anti-colonial organization to establish a grassroots structure. The movement&#x27;s leadership competed with the Communist movement for the peasants&#x27; support, though initial conflict was not about the Việt Minh&#x27;s then-hidden Communist ideas, but rather about the fact that they were not native to the region.

== Expansion ==

=== World War II ===
Early prophecies of Sổ began to come true: he anticipated the eruption of a major war in the Far East and the expulsion of the French by Asians. World War II and the Japanese occupation of Indochina seemed to confirm his predictions. By 1940, he had gained such influence that the Vichy French governor Jean Decoux, fearing anti-French revolts, had Sổ imprisoned in Bạc Liêu under the pretense that he was a lunatic. The imprisonment of Sổ was seen by his followers as an unforgivable act of war against the faith itself. In prison, Sổ succeeded in converting his psychiatrist, Dr. Tam, who became an ardent supporter. A board of French psychiatrists declared him sane in May 1941, though he was exiled upon his release. His key supporters were sent to a concentration camp in Nui Bara. The French restrictions strengthened his nationalist appeal, and Bạc Liêu soon became a place of Hòa Hảo pilgrimage, although it was far from the movement&#x27;s strongholds. He used the pilgrims to spread religious fervor and anti-French sentiment. In 1942, the French could no longer withstand the growing popular reactions generated by Sổ&#x27;s oracular pronouncements and political instructions, so they exiled him to Laos.

The Japanese quickly recognized the Hòa Hảo movement as a powerful anti-colonialist force. As they took over French Indochina, they intercepted and relocated Sổ to Saigon (nowadays Hồ Chí Minh City), placing him under the protection of the Kenpeitai. The Japanese authorities rebuffed French demands for extradition by saying that he was held as a &quot;Chinese spy&quot;. The extent of the Japanese military assistance is unknown, and some historians speculate that the Hòa Hảo benefited from the general availability of weapons during wartime, but nevertheless, the first Hoahaoist armed militias emerged in the Mekong Delta towards the end of 1943. Initially, they were used as village patrols, called self-defense forces. They then created battle formations to fight landlords, authorities, and French forces across the delta. This led to the Hòa Hảo becoming less of a religious and more of a military-political movement, as people such as landowners converted in the hope that they could gain protection. Under Japanese protection, the religious movement grew quickly. Though Sổ was unable to leave Saigon, his missionaries recruited on his behalf, using the combination of doom-laden prophesies and veiled threats against those who would not join, as well as the distribution of cures and amulets. They supported Cường Để, a member of Vietnam&#x27;s Nguyễn royal dynasty residing in exile in Japan, as the legitimate ruler of Vietnam. Sổ felt powerful enough to make a pact with F. Moresco, the Sureté director in Saigon, to denounce members of competing groups in exchange for immunity. By late 1944, there were up to a million Hòa Hảo devotees. Sổ used his authority to subvert colonial administration in regions where he had influence. The Hòa Hảo took over the role of colonial courts, converted French-led Vietnamese troops, and supplied the Japanese forces with rice.

The Hòa Hảo had accepted Japanese assistance as a means of bolstering themselves against future threats, having been in conflicts with both the French and the Việt Minh. The Hòa Hảo had a capable military force in place by the end of World War II, thanks to Japanese patronage, and had taken the offensive throughout the western Mekong Delta. Sổ and the Hòa Hảo began to mobilize against Japanese military troops in order to demonstrate their credentials as a resolute nationalist organization hostile to all foreign powers, having obtained the military strength required to ensure the religious community&#x27;s survival. During the Japanese patronage, Sổ wrote new religious texts that no longer referenced catastrophic millenarian notions, but rather to a Pure Land Buddhism. Also, he entered politics openly by creating the Village People Party in 1944, known as Dân Xã for short. Sổ claimed that instead of politicizing religion, he was bringing religion into politics.

=== August Revolution ===
Sổ avoided the stigma of being labeled a Japanese puppet by forecasting the empire&#x27;s defeat months in advance. His movement joined the nationalist front that took power in the interregnum following Japan&#x27;s surrender to establish a united resistance to both the Japanese and the French. Sổ requested and received a Communist cadre to assist him in training his followers. The Japanese requested from Sổ and his followers more crops, but instead, he advised peasants to stop farming, putting his new alliance with the ICP in jeopardy, as the Communists regarded southern rice as critical to ending the northern famine. Peasants were persuaded to partially restore production levels by local Communists, and the ICP maintained its precarious unity with the Hòa Hảo in the common cause of independence. The Hòa Hảo, Việt Minh, and Cao Đài, another religious group, united in the independence effort and the ICP took power in Saigon during the August Revolution. The Việt Minh proclaimed themselves to be Vietnam&#x27;s legitimate government. The French, alongside the Cao Đài and Hòa Hảo, other local political organizations, and the Binh Xuyen forces all disputed this claim. Thus, the Hòa Hảo clashed with Việt Minh as well as the Cao Đài. Militarily superior to the Việt Minh, the Hòa Hảo became the main political power in the Mekong Delta region, constituting a huge threat to the Communists. The religious leadership was unwilling to toe the Việt Minh line from Hanoi.

On 7–9 September 1945, a band of 15,000 Hoahaoists armed with hand-to-hand weapons and aided by the Trotskyists, attacked the Việt Minh garrison at the port city of Cần Thơ, which the Hòa Hảo considered the rightful capital of their domain. They were led by Trần Văn Soái (1889–1961), his eldest son, Lâm Thành Nguyên (1904–1977), and Sổ&#x27;s younger brother, but with their antiquated weapons, the Hòa Hảo were defeated and Sổ&#x27;s men were massacred by the Việt Minh-controlled Advanced Guard Youth, who were reportedly aided by a nearby Japanese garrison. The slaughter, characterized by its savagery, prompted a retaliatory campaign of mass killing against the Communists from the Hòa Hảo delta strongholds. The bodies of Communist cadres&#x27; were bound together and dumped in rivers and canals. In villages where the Hòa Hảo were in charge, corpses were also displayed in public to test outsiders&#x27; political inclinations. Those who expressed their discomfort with the sight were assumed to be Việt Minh sympathizers.

French colonial rule in Vietnam was disrupted during World War II. The German occupation of France and the subsequent collaboration of Vichy France with the Axis powers served to delegitimize French claims of sovereignty. Nevertheless, the French and the British took advantage of the anti-colonial forces&#x27; disunity and pushed the pro-independence forces out of Saigon over the next few weeks, during Operation Masterdom. The Hòa Hảo forces blocked the route, obstructing the Communist retreat. Late in September, the ICP sought to reconcile with the Hòa Hảo, but Sổ, who was skeptical of them, turned them down. The Việt Minh then executed two Hòa Hảo leaders, Sổ&#x27;s brother, and one of his Trotskyist advisers in October; by now, the uneasy alliance had collapsed.

=== First Indochina War ===
The return of the French colonial regime helped to keep the Hòa Hảo and the Việt Minh apart, but it was also a major disappointment to the Hòa Hảo. Sổ had hoped that his religious movement would become the &quot;de facto&quot; ruling power throughout most of Cochinchina, but the arrival of a larger French force put an end to such ambitions. The Hòa Hảo turned inward to strengthen their religious power and expand their political influence in the Mekong Delta. As the French grew increasingly skeptical of the Việt Minh, they started aiding the Hòa Hảo. In fact, throughout the First Indochina War (1946–1954), the French government issued support payments for Cao Đài, Hòa Hao, and Bình Xuyên armed forces in exchange for defense of the territories they controlled against the Việt Minh. They granted the Hòa Hảo hegemony over the southwestern Mekong Delta and eventually provided arms for some 20,000 Hoahaoists. In return for aid against the Việt Minh, the new Hòa Hảo leadership was willing to form alliances with the colonialists; they did not see such an agreement as a betrayal of their nationalist ideals because the ultimate goal of religious independence was not jeopardized. The Hòa Hảo periodically tied Việt Minh sympathizers together and threw them into the river to drown. The Việt Minh were worried by Sổ&#x27;s nationalist credentials and social structure, and attempted to co-opt him into a National Unified Front (NUF).

Moreover, Sơn Ngọc Thành, the Prime Minister of Cambodia, recognized the Democratic Republic of Vietnam when it was founded in 1945. Southern Vietnamese Việt Minh commanders established contact with Thành to orchestrate resistance to the French. For negotiations, the Khmer government sent a delegation. The talks collapsed after this delegation made itself unpopular by pressing the issue of Cambodia&#x27;s irredentist claims over the Mekong Delta. The Hòa Hảo clashed with the Khmers in Trà Vinh province, and the French were determined to act firmly against Thành&#x27;s government. The colonial authorities apprehended Thành, who was arrested and imprisoned upon his return to Saigon. Thành, who had been exiled to France, did not return to Cambodia until 1951.

The Hòa Hảo perceived that religious supremacy required territorial hegemony as well. The religion&#x27;s leadership demanded virtually autonomous control of affairs within its sphere of influence. This included participation in local government in places where it exercised coherent religious control. American officer and author John B. Haseman suggests that a key reason for the emergence of a Hòa Hảo–Việt Minh conflict so early in the anti-colonialist struggle was the latter&#x27;s refusal to accept the Hòa Hảo demand for political predominance inside its sphere. Although the Hòa Hảo appeared to be politically unstable on the surface as they swung between ideological affiliations, their actions had a core constancy of purpose. As the French discovered, the religious leadership&#x27;s main goal was territorial political hegemony. The Hòa Hảo&#x27;s alliance with the French lasted only as long as was necessary to obtain French arms. The Hòa Hảo, having the patronage of the colonial power, were able to hold off the Việt Minh during the latter&#x27;s rise to dominance in the NUF. The Hòa Hảo repudiated the colonialists in 1947 and cautiously approached the NUF. The Hòa Hảo had suspicions for NUF for a long time; their transition in allegiance from the colonialists to the NUF was not a huge break. Their effort was primarily aimed at securing control of the western Mekong Delta. The Hòa Hảo, bolstered by French arms, revolted against the French because they believed that colonial control in Vietnam would be overthrown by Asians.

The Hòa Hảo&#x27;s alliance with the Việt Minh was short-lived and the NUF dissolved in July 1946, while Sổ became estranged from his military leaders. It was immediately evident that the Hòa Hảo&#x27;s demands for religious autonomy and political sovereignty were irreconcilable with Việt Minh ambitions. Soon after, Sổ was preaching with growing zeal against the Việt Minh, whom he saw as posing an even greater threat to the religious movement than the French. The conflict with the Việt Minh devolved into a holy war. Sổ preached that every Hòa Hảo who killed ten Việt Minh would have a direct path to heaven. The Communists attacked the Hòa Hảo positions between 23 March and 6 April 1947, forcing the Hòa Hảo military to retreat to Long Xuyên. On 18 April 1947, Sổ was invited to a Việt Minh stronghold in the Plain of Reeds for a conciliation meeting. He refused the Communists&#x27; demands and made for home, but he was halted while sailing through Long Xuyên on the Đốc Vàng Hạ River, most of his company was slain, and he was arrested by the southern Việt Minh leader Nguyễn Bình. Sổ was killed, and to prevent the Hoahaoists from recovering his remains and erecting a martyr&#x27;s shrine, the Việt Minh quartered Sổ&#x27;s body and scattered his remains across the country; his remains were never found.

== Post-Sổ period ==
Sổ&#x27;s death created a power vacuum within the religious leadership. Because he was the sole unexceptional candidate among vying competitors, Sổ&#x27;s father Huỳnh Công Bộ was hurriedly chosen to succeed him as its leader. He was the former chief of the Hòa Hảo village, and served as the religious doctrine&#x27;s guardian and movement&#x27;s leader until his death. Despite this, he lacked his son&#x27;s charm, authority, political savvy, and ideological obsession. Therefore, the movement began to lose momentum, leading to factionalism, parochialism, and outside organization influence, which caused an increase in violence as the various internal factions engaged in conflicts among themselves. The religious group split into four factions, each led by a former military subordinate of Sổ, while Soái assumed the title of commander in chief of the Hòa Hảo armed forces. The factionalized leaders were far more violent, resorting to public burnings, beheadings, and mass executions of ethnic Khmers and Vietnamese. None of the military commanders were concerned with anything other than their own self-promotion, and none of the civilian leaders had Sổ&#x27;s capacity to guide them or preach moderation. Their violence was not limited to South Vietnam; they would cross borders and pillage Cambodian villages. Local Khmers responded by creating defense groups to fight the Hòa Hảo, while others converted to assure their safety. Despite this, the Hòa Hảo declared eternal war against the Communists. Haseman argues that Sổ&#x27;s assassination was a major miscalculation on the part of the Việt Minh, who falsely believed at the time that the Hòa Hảo lacked the strength to fight both the French and the Communists. By mid-1947, the Hoahaoists were committed to armed combat against the Việt Minh. During the First Indochina War, because of their shared antipathy towards the Việt Minh and the need to find a source of financial support to replace French wartime subsidies, Hòa Hảo maintained a level of cooperation with Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên. In the months leading up to the Franco–Việt Minh ceasefire, these shared interests held the factions together. They temporarily halted their conflicts with the French, signing a military treaty with them on 8 May 1947, less than a month after Sổ&#x27;s assassination.

=== Delta triumvirate ===
Following Sổ&#x27;s assassination, the religious movement expanded its territory to include Cần Thơ Province. They controlled over a third of southern Vietnam, elected their own officials, and built significant infrastructure for collecting taxes and recruiting armed forces. Soái formed an alliance with the French, providing Hòa Hảo troops as auxiliary forces; however, several other Hòa Hảo leaders refused to recognize Soái&#x27;s leadership, and the religion continued to be riven by rivalries and factionalism. Nevertheless, it transformed into a French-backed 20,000-strong army. They ruled most of the upper central delta, and, along with the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên, established a triumvirate in the mid-1950s, early in the Vietnam War (1955–1975), that grew in strength and constituted a significant threat to South Vietnam. This republic was regarded by the Hòa Hảo as just another in a series of central governments aiming to subjugate the Hòa Hảo to their rule.
The new authority in Saigon, led by President Ngô Đình Diệm, succeeded in expelling the French, a long-held ambition of the Hòa Hảo. When the French sought to build up the Vietnamese National Army (VNA) in 1952, relations with them started to deteriorate. The Hòa Hảo forces were adamant about preserving their autonomy, and one of their commanders withdrew his forces from the VNA, burning down the outposts they were assigned to guard. In February 1955, the French cut off funding to the Hòa Hảo and Cao Đại, and the groups&#x27; leaders were forced to seek funding from two wealthy individuals: Diệm and Bình Xuyên leader Lê Văn Viễn. Colonel Edward Lansdale, who became one of Diệm&#x27;s closest American confidants, met with the movement&#x27;s leaders on Diệm&#x27;s behalf, offering them money and applauding Diệm&#x27;s nationalism. Diệm and his brother, Ngô Đình Nhu, also had direct dealings with religious leaders. While key figures of the movement agreed to support the government in exchange for millions of U.S. dollars, others were less receptive to Diệm&#x27;s pleadings, and many grew bitter when they discovered Diệm expected them to relinquish their autonomy. They were especially concerned about Diệm&#x27;s demand that Soái hand over control of his administrative region to the Saigon government, and also Diệm&#x27;s response to Soái&#x27;s refusal; Diệm dispatched the VNA to the region and threatened to level Soái&#x27;s headquarters if the Hòa Hảo forces resisted. The government also relocated around a hundred thousand northern Catholics in An Giang Province. Furthermore, Hòa Hảo sources claimed that VNA troops were desecrating their sites of worship on Diệm&#x27;s orders, who was already accused of creating an all-Catholic sectarian army that was seeking to Catholicisize the country.

Văn Viễn retaliated by allying with other Cao Đại and Hòa Hảo leaders, as he offered them money from his vast wealth, to form the United Front of Nationalist Forces (UFNF) in opposition to the Saigon government in early March 1955. With the mounting opposition to Diệm, they began scooping up strategically located houses in Saigon to use as bases for attacks on the Saigon government&#x27;s critical installations. The Nguyễn dynasty&#x27;s emperor, Bảo Đại, supported the UFNF and assured the Americans that Diệm was completely incapable of fulfilling his job. When Diệm and the Americans sought to buy Bảo Đại&#x27;s support, he turned them down since they offered less money than he was receiving from the Bình Xuyên. The UFNF tried to seek U.S. support in deposing Diệm, though the Americans rejected this and threatened that if anyone attempted to topple Diệm, they would back him up. The UFNF then looked for ways to destabilize Diệm&#x27;s government without staging a coup. The movement&#x27;s leaders presented him with an ultimatum, demanding representation in the South Vietnamese government and funding for their military, which were required to maintain control over the regional fiefdoms they ruled; this was refused by Diệm.

=== Sect crisis ===
General J. Lawton Collins believed that Diệm would be doomed if he yielded in to the movement&#x27;s demands. He thought that the groups&#x27; boldness in presenting this ultimatum strongly suggested that they were planning anti-Diệm rallies in Saigon. According to Collins, the Saigon government could not have allowed rallies to go unchallenged and had to intervene to put an end to them. He advised Diệm to reach an agreement with the UFNF in order to persuade its members to becoming government loyalists. Initially, Diệm agreed to negotiate with the UFNF leaders, but when they stated that their demands were non-negotiable, he abandoned the idea. He was certain that the VNA would carry out his orders to suppress any opposition group, as he had gained the loyalty of many army officers in recent months and had replaced many others who had not. Collins, however, underestimated the army&#x27;s support for Diệm and advised him to avoid using brute force and instead seek a compromise. Though Collins discouraged Diệm from executing his plans against Bình Xuyên, the latter, suspicious of a VNA attack, made a move on Diệm loyalists without first seeking America&#x27;s consent. This resulted in a conflict between the two that temporarily halted with a ceasefire enforced by the French Commissioner-General Paul Ély. Collins went to Washington with the determination that Diệm had to be replaced. U.S. President Dwight Eisenhower honored his decision and U.S. Secretary of State John Foster Dulles penned telegrams to Saigon, informing Bảo Đại and other Vietnamese leaders to find a replacement for Diệm. These plans were halted when a new battle began in Saigon between the VNA and Bình Xuyên. The Diệm loyalists crushed Bình Xuyên, with the latter being saved from total annihilation only with Ély&#x27;s intervention.

Trying to preserve the Bình Xuyên, French Prime Minister Edgar Faure declared Diệm&#x27;s government incompetent. While Collins was in Washington, Ély spoke with Randolph Kidder, the acting U.S. ambassador, and urged the Americans to join with France to depose Diệm. Kidder did not know what the official U.S. government policy on Diệm was, so he spoke with uncertainty. While Kidder and Ely were arguing, 200 people gathered in the Saigon Town Hall to declare the General Assembly of the Democratic and Revolutionary Forces of the Nation. General Nguyễn Giác Ngộ (1897–1967) of the Hòa Hảo, accompanied by Trình Minh Thế and Nguyễn Thành Phương of the Cao Đại, led the assembly. Its members tore down a large photograph of Bảo Đại, hurled it out the window, and stomped on it in the street before the meeting started, and proceeded to condemn the French and their allies. The assembly then drafted a list of demands that included Bảo Đại&#x27;s abdication, the removal of all French forces, and the formation of a new government headed by Diệm. They formed a committee to deliver the demands to the government, but when they arrived at the palace, they discovered General Nguyễn Văn Vy in Diệm&#x27;s office, declaring that he was taking over the army as Bảo Đại had instructed. Vy was taken hostage and compelled to cancel his plans by several members of the committee. After a paratroop colonel threatened Diệm, he let Vy go, and Vy left the next day for Paris. By this point, reports of the clashes in South Vietnam had reached the United States, sparking an outpouring of support for Diệm among Congressmen and the general public. Collins&#x27; judgment was no longer acceptable to President Eisenhower and Dulles, and the president opted to completely back Diệm.
Furious that the Hòa Hảo had not been granted enough privileges, the four generals of the Hoà Hảo - Lâm Thành Nguyên, Ba Cụt, Trần Văn Soái, and Nguyễn Giác Ngộ - declared war on the Saigon government in late May 1955. They knew that a direct confrontation with the VNA would be catastrophic, so they burned down their bases and dispersed their army of 16,000 men into the jungle to operate as guerrillas. The Americans did not discourage Diệm from fighting back this time. The VNA, led by General Dương Văn Minh, went on an offensive on 5 June and, by mid-June, the army had crushed Soái&#x27;s force near the Cambodian border, forcing him to retreat into Cambodia. Ngộ and Nguyên, disappointed by the rebellion&#x27;s ineffectiveness, surrendered and turned over their armies to Saigon. Only Ba Cụt was left to continue the fighting. For the rest of 1955, the Republic army would pursue Ba Cụt&#x27;s 3,000 men across the countryside.

=== 1955 referendum ===

During a referendum organized by Diệm in October, Hòa Hảo forces staged sporadic attacks on the polling stations of Cần Tho, though there was not much opposition to this political maneuver. Communist politician Lê Duẩn met with Soái and Ba Cụt, and, despite their ideological differences, they agreed to form the Southern Committee of the Patriotic Front, which eventually included remnants not only from the Hòa Hảo but also the Cao Đài and Bình Xuyên rebel armies. Soái declared the referendum unconstitutional, stating his preference for a true democratic state. Diệm&#x27;s political maneuvers were also criticized by Ba Cụt, who claimed that the referendum was an opportunity to force the people to &quot;depose Bảo Đại and proclaim the puppet Diệm as the chief-of-state of Vietnam&quot;. Diệm reportedly received $4 million in aid from the American government and American Catholic organizations to support the referendum, which Ba Cụt stated was part of an &quot;American effort to Catholicize Vietnam&quot;. Diệm, according to Dân Xã, exploited American aid money for bribing &quot;laborers and young students to petition in support of Diệm&#x27;s ascent to chief-of-state and in favor of deposing Bảo Đại&quot;.

Some historians have questioned Diệm&#x27;s critics&#x27; political relevance and sincerity. According to historian Robert Nathan, there was a shift in Vietnamese politics as a result of America&#x27;s replacement of France as the primary foreign influence, and a burst of democratic and pseudo-democratic ideas and propaganda by pious people who were previously considered to be power-hungry politicians. According to Nathan, the adoption of democratic rhetoric by Hòa Hảo generals and their allies was meaningless because none of them rose to power. Moreover, the leaders of the Hòa Hảo were often dismissed by American officials at the time as &quot;feudal&quot; or &quot;gangster&quot;, or of minor importance.

Diệm&#x27;s government abolished all of the Hòa Hảo civil organizations; their religious rituals were to be kept strictly private, and all public celebrations were forbidden. Diệm&#x27;s forces, now called the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN), spent much of 1956 fighting the Hòa Hảo insurgents, who continued to harass the government. Also, the Việt Minh established a few of their own units, disguising them with religious names like the &quot;Hòa Hảo Liberation Company&quot;. The ARVN targeted the remaining Hòa Hảo rebels in the western Mekong Delta near the beginning of the year, inflicting crippling losses. Soái returned to Vietnam, but he and his 4,600-strong force surrendered in February. In April, a government patrol caught Ba Cụt, the last remaining rebel leader. After being convicted of a series of murders in court, he was guillotined in Cần Thơ on 13 July 1956, despite Lansdale&#x27;s urges, as he worried that the execution would solidify Cụt&#x27;s followers&#x27; hostility to the South Vietnamese government. Indeed, the bulk of Hòa Hảo followers joined the Việt Cộng, while the government obliterated Cụt&#x27;s remaining guerrilla troops by May. By now, Sổ&#x27;s younger sister Huỳnh Thị Kim Biên was the movement&#x27;s new religious leader, and the Hòa Hảo were eventually destroyed by Saigon&#x27;s considerably larger forces. ARVN&#x27;s final operations in 1962 wiped out the Hòa Hảo military might. American historian Jessica M. Chapman argues that the infrastructure of the Hòa Hảo-controlled territories was not strong enough to function without foreign backing, as the previous French subsidies were the organization&#x27;s &quot;lifeblood&quot;.

=== Post-Diệm Vietnam ===
In South Vietnam, the overthrow of the Diệm regime in 1963 coincided with the outbreak of large-scale guerrilla warfare. Communist Party leaders, now in the Việt Cộng, which had a tremendous military strength throughout the country, in order to exert more effective control over the revolutionary struggle in the Mekong Delta, their strongest position, and to prevent the revolutionary vanguard from being ceded to Hòa Hảo. Despite their military setbacks, the Hòa Hảo maintained their political and religious control over the western portion of the Bassac River and Cần Thơ, the Mekong Delta&#x27;s regional capital. They also preserved their arms and formed paramilitaries to defend the movement&#x27;s geographical stronghold. The Hòa Hảo were too powerful for the Saigon government to continue fighting. Starting from Nguyễn Cao Kỳ&#x27;s government in the mid-1960s, the Hòa Hảo were left alone in the Miền Tây and gained tacit permission to establish a form of sovereignty in exchange for acknowledging South Vietnam&#x27;s authority. They resumed their conflict with the Communists as they were no longer forced to commit their military to the campaign against the central authority. The tacit agreement with the South Vietnamese government removed the necessity for keeping a reserve force. The Hòa Hảo used their new independence to launch a total war on the Việt Cộng. The ARVN aided the Hòa Hảo militia in their fight against the Communists by tying down the Việt Cộng&#x27;s main force in nearby locations, allowing the militia to focus on fighting Communist guerrillas and infrastructure cadres. The anti-Communist campaign of the Hòa Hảo was accompanied by ruthless butchery, and the Communists retaliated in kind.

The significance of Hòa Hảo was recognized by every post-Diệm administration of South Vietnam. As a cohesive force in the Mekong Delta, the religious movement was now extremely valued; Hòa Hảo&#x27;s military might and political influence were welcomed by the South Vietnamese government, and the Hòa Hảo provided tacit support to every post-Diệm regime in Saigon. Members of the religion gradually rose to positions of authority at all levels of government, from hamlet and village chiefs to national parliamentary representatives. By now, the Hòa Hảo had achieved their principal goal of religious independence. The orthodox Buddhist authority no longer discriminated against the Hòa Hảo on a religious basis.

It was the Hòa Hảo&#x27;s military might, which was organized along religious lines, and capacity to ensure a high level of local security in the provinces it controlled that provided the group with its most powerful influencing lever. It was a religious force in every sense, tasked with the protection of the devotees. The Hòa Hảo formed a local militia after South Vietnam&#x27;s armed forces were restructured, securing their heartlands and denying the Việt Cộng access to their agricultural riches. The Vietnamese Army was divided into three echelons: The ARVN was the regular army, and there were two echelons of territorial forces under the ARVN; the Popular Force and the Regional Force. Those in the Popular Force were only allowed to be assigned to areas within the district they resided, while those in the Regional Force were only allowed to be assigned to areas within the province they resided. This was a tremendous opportunity for the Hòa Hảo to establish a robust, unified force to defend their land and fight the Việt Cộng efficiently. Locals used to make up the Hòa Hảo&#x27;s armed force, which was financed by local taxes levied on the devotees. Now, the Hòa Hảo were being paid by the Saigon government to defend themselves.

=== Fall of Saigon ===
The group&#x27;s prowess in counter-guerrilla operations was demonstrated by the high level of security in the provinces where it operated. An Giang Province had the highest security rating of any province in South Vietnam, despite being surrounded by areas with security ratings near the bottom of the national list. Long Xuyên, the provincial capital and only 30 miles from the Cambodian border, was a Hòa Hảo stronghold with the Mekong Delta&#x27;s second-highest security ranking. The region&#x27;s security prompted American advisors to invite visiting dignitaries to An Giang Province, where the situation was supposedly representative of the remarkable progress made in the war. Despite the brutal guerilla warfare that engulfed the rest of the Mekong Delta, An Giang remained a haven of peace until the very end of the conflict. No ARVN division was ever assigned to conduct full-time combat operations in the province, and its efforts were limited to preventing Communist infiltration routes and camps in neighboring provinces. Moreover, throughout the Mekong Delta, An Giang&#x27;s territorial forces had the lowest rate of desertions.

In the mid-1970s, president Nguyễn Văn Thiệu, who took power in 1967, started to face domestic opposition. After some street protests, he started to crackdown on any opposition, including the Hòa Hảo militia. Following this, six major Hòa Hảo factions signed a declaration in Hòa Hảo village, calling for an end to all separate activities that were harmful to unity, and formed an opposition to Saigon. They sheltered and protected hundreds of thousands of ARVN draft dodgers and deserters, and organized them into their own army, supplying them with American weaponry obtained from corrupt ARVN commanders. The Hòa Hảo, having created a &quot;Civil Guard Force&quot;, became a formidable foe for Thiệu, who declared the dissolution of the Hòa Hảo militia on 30 January 1975. The Thiệu government assaulted the Hòa Hảo for the first time since 1963. They arrested Lê Trung Tuấn, the director of the Hòa Hảo Central Institute, and Trần Hữu Bẩy, the commander of the Bảo An military wing, which was later banned by the government. The men were sent before a Cần Thơ military court, where they were sentenced to six years of hard labor. Government forces had arrested as many as 600 Hoahaoists by February. Clashes erupted in the Mekong Delta; ARVN troops killed seven Hòa Hảo militiamen and wounded sixteen others after surrounding ten thousand Hòa Hảo, including militiamen from the now-banned Bảo An military wing who dug in around a pagoda. Lương Trọng Tường, the Hòa Hảo&#x27;s leader, and members of the movement&#x27;s high council were among those besieged. Despite all these, An Giang, the religion&#x27;s home province, became a government stronghold until the last months of the war.

Before the Fall of Saigon in 1975, at least two Hòa Hảo Regional Force battalions were sent to neighboring Kiên Giang Province, and hundreds of thousands of Hòa Hảo served in ARVN units across the country. Thousands more trained soldiers were stationed in the provinces of An Giang and Châu Đốc. Many of these soldiers joined guerrilla forces on the outskirts of the Hòa Hảo homeland, which was relatively unscathed by war. After the war, there were reports of a major anti-Communist military insurgency in the Mekong Delta, though not much is known due to the country&#x27;s secretive nature at the time. In November 1977, a government decree specified that religious activities must be consistent with socialism. Individual Hòa Hảo practices were allowed, but no explicit reference to Sổ was permitted, and his written works were outlawed. Vietnamese Communist authorities reported military operations to defeat the remaining forces in January 1978. They were assumed to be Hòa Hảo insurgents by the American media, who numbered in the thousands. Nevertheless, the Hòa Hảo claimed to have three million adherents in 1978. They were marked for special attention in the re-education process by the new government, and many of the movement&#x27;s leaders were imprisoned. The new government prohibited the religion, but allowed individual practitioners to worship at home. Many Hoahaoists fled to neighboring Cambodia or migrated to the United States to avoid further persecution. Meanwhile, the religious leaders of the Hòa Hảo found various ways to cooperate with local authorities. Some leaders took a rather more political viewpoint and were subjected to harassment. Some leaders refused to discuss politics, and they were left alone in some areas. Some opined about the government&#x27;s abuses, which caused tension as they were perceived as rebels.

== Present day and persecution ==

The Vietnamese government officially recognized the Hòa Hảo religion in 1999. In July, half a million Hoahaoists gathered in An Giang. Similar religious gatherings of the Hòa Hảo were held in the following years. Despite this, the government imposes harsh controls on dissenting Hòa Hảo groups that do not follow the state-sanctioned branch. Local rights groups have said that authorities in An Giang harass unapproved devotees on a regular basis, prohibit public readings of the Hòa Hảo founder&#x27;s writings, and discourage worshipers from visiting Hòa Hảo pagodas in An Giang and adjoining provinces. The collective expression of particular Hòa Hảo commemorations, pilgrimage traditions, and freedom of publication are disfavored by the authorities. The Vietnamese Communist Party demonstrated its continuation of political domination by renewed arrests of Hòa Hảo activists. Two Hoahaoists self-immolated in 2005 to protest religious persecution and in May 2007 nine more were imprisoned following a wave of arrests. Unrecognized religious groups, including Hòa Hảo groups, face constant monitoring, harassment, and intimidation, according to a 2020 Human Rights Watch report, and their followers are subjected to public criticism, forced abandonment of faith, arrest, questioning, torture, and incarceration. According to other sources, members of the unregistered Hòa Hảo groups were persecuted on numerous occasions, including the imprisonment of six Hoahaoists who were accused of organizing an anti-government protest.

Hòa Hảo sources state that house arrest was imposed on 67 Hòa Hảo followers as of mid-2019. Individuals resisting police efforts to prevent invitees from attending Hòa Hảo meetings have accounted for the majority of the arrests; the police considered such defiance to be &quot;inciting a disturbance&quot;. In October 2019, six members of an unregistered Hòa Hảo group were assaulted by uniformed policemen in An Giang Province while traveling to demonstrate against the planned demolition of a Hòa Hảo temple. The government-recognized Hòa Hảo Buddhist Church had supported the temple&#x27;s destruction, but its defenders argued that it was still usable and sacred to them. According to the 2019 Annual Report of the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom, the local authorities in the province established barricades and police checkpoints to prevent the adherents of the unrecognized sect from celebrating significant religious holidays, such as the founder&#x27;s birthday. On 27 November 2019, a Hòa Hảo Buddhist was given an eight-year sentence for critical social media statements about the government, according to &quot;An Giang&quot;, a Vietnam-based newspaper.

=== Branches ===
Hòa Hảo is divided into three branches referred to as &#x27;sects&#x27;: pure, neutral, and state-recognized, though all of the sects follow identical practices. A small number of Hoahaoists choose not to be a member of an established sect. According to Hòa Hảo sources, the state-recognized and pure sects have fewer than 400 adherents, while the others are the members of the neutral sect. Adherents of the pure sect are completely committed to the doctrines of Sổ; one of their core ideals is opposing the &quot;dictatorship&quot; and they intend to fight to reclaim their &quot;lawful interest&quot;, whereas the adherents of the neutral sect are in line with the pure sect but don&#x27;t want to have any problems with the authorities. Vietnamese Communist Party&#x27;s members lead the state-recognized sect. According to &quot;The Vietnamese&quot;, formed by Vietnamese activists and reporters, the pure sect is an unrecognized religious organization, and its members are not permitted to hold their worshiping ceremonies publicly because just the organization&#x27;s Central Executive Committee has the authority to arrange such events.

== Beliefs ==
=== Doctrine ===
Hòa Hảo&#x27;s spiritual doctrine is essentially Buddhist. It has been labelled as an example of Buddhist protestantism; an amalgam of Buddhism, ancestor worship, animistic rites, and elements of Confucian doctrine, transformed and adapted to the mores and customs of the peasants of the Mekong Delta. It was also influenced by millennial aspects of Khmer Buddhism.

Between 1940 and 1946, Sổ authored a series of booklets that outlined the doctrinal elements of pre-sectarian Buddhism and its application to peasant culture at the time. His main written texts were first compiled in book form in 1948, following his death. Sổ had emphasized that his intention was to return to the original teachings of the Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương doctrine. He was criticized for harking back to the past, though most of the criticism came from Westernized intellectuals who questioned the relevance of traditional values to contemporary concerns, dismissed most sectarian practices as superstition, and insisted that religion had no place in politics. The doctrine&#x27;s revision was forced upon him as a response to particular critiques, rather than being the outcome of his own reasoned reconsideration. As a result, this revision was as disorganized as the critical attacks. Therefore, Hòa Hảo thought isn&#x27;t a well-considered revision of an out-of-date set of ideas. The religious and secular aspects of Hòa Hảo philosophy are inextricably linked. Spiritual values have secular ramifications, and religious solutions are frequently suggested to what would be considered social and political concerns.

Sổ, who is referred to as the &quot;Virtuous Master&quot; or &quot;Grand Master&quot; by his followers, railed against Vietnam&#x27;s social evils, prohibiting the sale of child brides, matchmaking, gambling, and the use of alcohol and opium. He depicted money as a source of evil for both those who lacked it and those who possessed too much, emphasizing thrift and hard labor to the poor, while stressing the soteriological value of charity to the rich. Sổ was against profit and competition, believing in the concept of a fair price and the immorality of usury. The urban life, according to Sổ, was a place of relentless competitiveness and ostentatious consumption. His anti-urban sentiments sprang not only from his beliefs in the intrinsic evil of big cities, but also from his recognition that they provided an escape for individuals seeking to avoid the stresses of communal life. The majority of modern problems were credited to Western civilization, which manifested itself in the urban lifestyle. People&#x27;s notion of community was said to have been disrupted by urban living. City inhabitants were accused of dishonesty, oversophistication, and an obsession with material values and appearances. Sổ regarded urbanization and industrialization as the result of the colonial conquest and thus something that could be reversed with the end of colonial rule. Despite a platform that advocated for equal treatment and the abolition of special privileges, he was a staunch opponent of Marxism and class conflict. In fact, the Hòa Hảo levied high taxes on their converts to cover welfare payments and military protection.

Similar to the Chinese White Lotus tradition, the Hòa Hảo eschatology adopts a division of three great eras (tam nguyên): establishment (chánh pháp), apogee (tượng pháp), and destruction of the dharma (mạt pháp). The closer humanity gets to the conclusion of the &#x27;base era&#x27; (hạ ngươn), the more disasters it will face, finally leading to the &#x27;end of the world&#x27; (tận thế). Then a new &#x27;high era&#x27; (thượng ngươn) will emerge, distinguished by absolute moral regeneration and sincere faith. If the faithful follow the declared ethic, they can expect to take part in a great assembly where they will be judged on their own merits. Maitreya will preside over this &#x27;Assembly of the Dragon Flower&#x27; (hội Long Hoa), in which he will reach the pinnacle of his enlightenment, ushering in a new era of rejuvenation.

Sổ sought to unify and refine a Mahāyāna Buddhist practice that honors ancestor commemoration and is appropriate for peasant life. He attempted to develop a subtle criticism of Bửu Sơn Kỳ Hương&#x27;s eschatological elements, which had never been done before. Sổ&#x27;s desire to break the prophetic and messianic cycle, on the other hand, was never fully defined or fulfilled. His mysterious death even reawakened hope for a second coming and paved the way to claims of reincarnation in various forms.

=== Practices ===
Unlike orthodox Buddhism, Hòa Hảo eschews elaborate rituals, temples, maintains no monastic order, and teaches home practice, though it has a few monks. Sổ advocated that each devotee could have direct communion with the Buddha, and that inner faith was more important than external rites. The faith requires no expensive statues or instruments as the faith believes that a deceased believer who lived a &quot;correct&quot; life just needs a simple funeral to expedite him to the afterlife. Such precepts were critical in lowering the cost of religion for the peasantry. It has earned the descriptor &quot;poor man&#x27;s Buddhism&quot; because of its outward simplicity. Hòa Hảo temples are often a simple stucco structure with a thatched roof. Religious adornments are similarly simple.

The most important altar for the Hòa Hảo is erected outside the residence, in front of which ritual prostrations are performed. The  () is the signature object and site of the Hòa Hảo tradition. It consists of a basic wooden tablet measuring 40 by , which is supported by a high column on which offerings are laid. It represents deprivation and mortality, and the follower&#x27;s humility, as followers pray with their feet firmly planted on the ground, sometimes even kneeling, in direct communion with heaven.

The training of lay religious professionals started in the 1950s, when Hòa Hảo&#x27;s first explanatory works were published. In the 1960s study centers began to proliferate and an elite was fully trained to instruct the populace. State recognition allowed the group to expand its social and charitable activities, as well as publish works, republish and translate Sổ&#x27;s writings, print portraits of Sổ that became objects of worship, build libraries, and establish educational centers. The độc giảng đường were built, which were roadside edifices that allowed peasants working in the fields to listen to amplified public readings of sacred scriptures.
As a show of universal understanding, prayers are said in front of an empty table covered in red cloth. Water as a sign of cleanliness, local flowers as a sign of purity, and a small amount of incense to ward off evil spirits are the only physical offerings. Regular Hòa Hảo rites are limited to four prayers a day: the first to Buddha, the second to the &quot;Reign of the Enlightened King&quot;, which is influenced by Western Messianic thought, and the third to living and deceased parents and relatives. The fourth prayer is dedicated to those whom the devotee wishes to have the &quot;will to improve themselves, to be charitable, and to be free of the chains of ignorance&quot;. According to Hòa Hảo philosophy, devotees are to maintain the Three Fundamental Bonds: the relationship between the ruler and the subject, the relationship between father and son, and the relationship between husband and wife. The Five Constant Virtues of benevolence, righteousness, propriety, wisdom, and trustworthiness are to be observed. They are to live in harmony with one another above everything else.

Hoahaoists began giving community amenities, such as free food, shelter, clothes, medicinal herbs, and rural transportation infrastructure, when the government recognized the religion, according to Thanh Vo-Duy. For the Hòa Hảo, establishing new villages was a meritorious act; in the early 1970s, Hoahaoists were actively creating new villages out of the wetlands in the Plain of Reeds. Despite this, Vietnamese people outside the Mekong Delta know little about Hòa Hảo religious life.

Early in the religion&#x27;s history, Sổ&#x27;s apocalyptic rhetoric had severe repercussions. Several incidents of human sacrifice by Hòa Hảo adepts were documented; these ritual killings were justified on religious grounds, with some believing that the spirits were thirsty for human blood. Although human sacrifice was not unknown in Vietnam prior to the Hòa Hảo, historian Hue-Tam Tai argues that Sổ&#x27;s frightening predictions had a role in the increased frequency of such incidents in the 1940s.

Historically, Vietnamese sectarian preachers were expected to perform magical and healing acts, but Hòa Hảo writers believed that magic was superstition, and hence incompatible with Zen&#x27;s non-exertion spirit. Traditionally, a missionary had to demonstrate his special abilities before his preaching could be accepted, which necessitated the use of magic. Tai believes that the emphasis stems from the illiteracy of the Mekong Delta&#x27;s population. She contrasts this with Chinese sects, which used the written word more frequently, but their adherents were also more settled within their communities. The lack of religious literature and the concentration on magical proof encouraged a style of leadership based on personal charisma rather than inherited legitimacy.

Its adherents have their own flag, a brown rectangle with no characters or pictures. The Hòa Hảo insignia is circular and brown, with a white lotus in the center and the initials P.G.H.H. (&quot;&quot;) on top. They also have their own special holidays; the Hoahaoists celebrate three festival days each Vietnamese lunisolar year: 18th day of the 5th month, the anniversary of the founding of Hòa Hảo Buddhism; 25th day of the 11th month, the founder&#x27;s nativity; and 25th day of the 2nd month, the date of the founder&#x27;s &quot;disappearance&quot;.

To become a follower, a candidate must introduce oneself to the village management committee with the assistance of two confirmed devotees who are familiar with the religious precepts and moral restrictions. The convert returns home after being publicly accepted to tell their family that they have taken shelter alongside the Three Jewels of Buddhism and are praying before the ancestors&#x27; altar, and then a copy of Sổ&#x27;s work &quot;&quot; is given to the convert. If no management committee exists, the convert is led by two adherents until they can visit the nearest committee. Anyone who wishes to leave the community must inform two followers or the committee of their decision. Anyone who goes against Sổ&#x27;s teachings is expelled from the community, and they are solely responsible for their actions. The village management boards fell under the jurisdiction of an interprovincial board and, ultimately, a central management board, which was in charge of Buddhist education and the application of the conditions of admittance into the faith, beginning in the late 1940s. However, because it was controlled by military factions, historian Pascal Bourdeaux argues that it lacked genuine representativeness.

According to a 2019 study by the UK Home Office&#x27;s fact-finding mission in Vietnam, Hòa Hảo is the country&#x27;s fourth largest religion. According to the United States Department of State&#x27;s 2019 International Religious Freedom Report, Vietnam&#x27;s total population was 97.9 million, based on estimates from the US government; Vietnam&#x27;s government statistics from January 2018 found that the Hoahaoists made about 1.5% of the Vietnamese population. Official estimates put the number of Hoahaoists at 1.3 million, although &quot;unofficial&quot; estimates put it at more than 2 million. Other sources estimate 500,000–1 million, 4–5 million or 8 million Hòa Hảo followers.

During its inception, the religion&#x27;s appeal was primarily to the poor peasantry of the Mekong Delta. The religion is still exclusively concentrated in the region, especially in the An Giang Province districts of Chợ Mới and Phú Tân, and the cities of Châu Đốc and Long Xuyên, as well as the surrounding provinces of Kiên Giang, Vĩnh Long, Đồng Tháp and Cần Thơ. In addition, Hòa Hảo devotees can be found in Hồ Chí Minh City, primarily because of the migration of adherents rather than the religion&#x27;s spread among the urban population. Unregistered Hoahaoists often reside in remote areas that are difficult to access. As a result, understanding how the communities interact each other, or whether they are connected by a communication network, is difficult. Hòa Hảo adherents are &quot;very few&quot; in central Vietnam and there are almost no adherents in northern Vietnam.

Overseas communities began to form around the late 1970s, mainly in the United States, Australia, and Canada, as well as smaller groups in France, Germany, and Belgium. It is estimated that there are several tens of thousands of Hòa Hảo followers living abroad. The largest community of Hoahaoists abroad is in Santa Ana, California.

<text>The decade of the 1960s in film involved many significant films.

== Trends ==
* Historical drama films continued to include epic films, in the style of &quot;Ben-Hur&quot; from 1959, with &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960) and &quot;Cleopatra&quot; (1963), but also evolving with 20th-century settings, such as &quot;The Guns of Navarone&quot; (1961), &quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; (1962), and &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot; (1965).
* Psychological horror films extended, beyond the stereotypical monster films of Dracula/Frankenstein or Wolfman, to include more twisted films, such as &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and Roger Corman&#x27;s Poe adaptations for American International Pictures as well as British companies Hammer Horror and Amicus Productions. Other European filmmakers like Mario Bava directed many notable horror films.
* Comedy films became more elaborate, such as &quot;The Pink Panther&quot; (1963), &quot;The President&#x27;s Analyst&quot; (1967), or &quot;A Funny Thing Happened on the Way to the Forum&quot; (1966). &quot;Breakfast at Tiffany&#x27;s&quot; (1961) elevated the concept of a comedy-drama, where the subtle comedy conceals the harsher elements of the drama beneath, and Stanley Kubrick&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot; (1964) set a new standard for satire by turning a story about nuclear holocaust into a sophisticated black comedy.
* Beyond the trenchcoat and film noir, spy films expanded with worldly settings and hi-tech gadgets, such as the James Bond films &quot;Dr. No&quot; (1962) or &quot;Goldfinger&quot; (1964) and &quot;Thunderball&quot; (1965). This Spy mania extended throughout the world with many countries notably Italy and Spain producing many of their own fantastical spy films.
* Similar to spy films, the heist or caper film included worldly settings and hi-tech gadgets, as in the original &quot;Ocean&#x27;s Eleven&quot; (1960), &quot;Topkapi&quot; (1964) or &quot;The Thomas Crown Affair&quot; (1968).
* The spaghetti westerns (made in Italy and Spain), were typified by Clint Eastwood films, such as &quot;For a Few Dollars More&quot; (1965) or &quot;The Good, the Bad and the Ugly&quot; (1966). Several other American and Italian actors were also prominent in such westerns including Lee Van Cleef and Franco Nero.
* Science-fiction or fantasy films employed a wider range of special effects, as in the original of &quot;The Time Machine&quot; (1960) and &quot;Mysterious Island&quot; (1961), or with animated aliens or mythical creatures, as in the Harryhausen animation for &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; (1963) and &quot;One Million Years B.C.&quot; (1966). Some extensive sets were built to simulate alien worlds or zero-gravity chambers, as in space-station and spaceship sets for the epic &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968), the psychedelic, space settings for the erotic &quot;Barbarella&quot; (1968), and with ape-city in the original &quot;Planet of the Apes&quot; (1968). Russian fairy-tale fantasy was also prominent with the likes of Aleksandr Rou directing many such films.
* The highly-influential science-fiction films &quot;Alphaville&quot; (1965) and &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; (1968) explored the concept of a malign artificial intelligence, a theme which later science fiction culture would develop.

Beginning in the middle of the decade due to the start of the cultural revolution and the abolition of the Hays Code (which had largely been abandoned at the start of the decade), films became increasingly experimental and daring and were taking shape of what was to define the latter half of the decade as well as the 1970s.

<doc id="248708" wikidata="Q1277029" url="?curid=248708" title="Red Skelton">
<text>Richard Bernard Skelton (July 18, 1913September 17, 1997) was an American entertainer best known for his national radio and television shows between 1937 and 1971, especially as host of the television program &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;. He has stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his work in radio and television, and also appeared in burlesque, vaudeville, films, nightclubs, and casinos, all while he pursued an entirely separate career as an artist.

Skelton began developing his comedic and pantomime skills from the age of 10, when he became part of a traveling medicine show. He then spent time on a showboat, worked the burlesque circuit, and then entered into vaudeville in 1934. The &quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot; pantomime sketch, which he wrote together with his wife, launched a career for him in vaudeville, radio, and films. His radio career began in 1937 with a guest appearance on &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot;, which led to his becoming the host of &quot;Avalon Time&quot; in 1938. He became the host of &quot;The Raleigh Cigarette Program&quot; in 1941, on which many of his comedy characters were created, and he had a regularly scheduled radio program until 1957. Skelton made his film debut in 1938 alongside Ginger Rogers and Douglas Fairbanks Jr. in Alfred Santell&#x27;s &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot;, and would appear in numerous musical and comedy films throughout the 1940s and 1950s, with starring roles in 19 films, including &quot;Ship Ahoy&quot; (1941), &quot;I Dood It&quot; (1943), &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; (1946), and &quot;The Clown&quot; (1953).

Skelton was eager to work in television, even when the medium was in its infancy. &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; made its television premiere on September 30, 1951, on NBC. By 1954, Skelton&#x27;s program moved to CBS, where it was expanded to one hour and renamed &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot; in 1962. Despite high ratings, the show was canceled by CBS in 1970, as the network believed that more youth-oriented programs were needed to attract younger viewers and their spending power. Skelton moved his program to NBC, where he completed his last year with a regularly scheduled television show in 1971. He spent his time after that making as many as 125 personal appearances a year and working on his paintings.

Skelton&#x27;s paintings of clowns remained a hobby until 1964, when his wife Georgia persuaded him to show them at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas while he was performing there. Sales of his originals were successful, and he also sold prints and lithographs, earning $2.5 million yearly on lithograph sales. At the time of his death, his art dealer said he thought that Skelton had earned more money through his paintings than from his television performances.

Skelton believed that his life&#x27;s work was to make people laugh; he wanted to be known as a clown because he defined it as being able to do everything. He had a 70-year-long career as a performer and entertained three generations of Americans. His widow donated many of his personal and professional effects to Vincennes University, including prints of his artwork. They are part of the Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy at Vincennes, Indiana.

==Biography==
===Early years, the medicine show and the circus (1913–1929)===
Skelton was born Richard Bernard Eheart on July 18, 1913, in Vincennes, Indiana. (The Eheart surname was his father&#x27;s stepfather&#x27;s, which his father occasionally went by.)

Skelton was the fourth son and youngest child of Joseph Elmer and Ida Mae (née Fields) Skelton. He had three older brothers: Denny Ishmael Skelton (1905–1943), Christopher M. Skelton (1907–1977) and Paul Fred Skelton (1910–1989). Joseph Skelton, a grocer, died two months before Richard was born; he had once been a clown with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus. His birth certificate surname, Eheart, was that of his father&#x27;s stepfather. During Skelton&#x27;s lifetime there was some dispute about the year of his birth. Author Wesley Hyatt suggests that since he began working at such an early age, Skelton may have claimed he was older than he actually was in order to gain employment. Vincennes neighbors described the Skelton family as being extremely poor; a childhood friend remembered that her parents broke up a youthful romance between her sister and Skelton because they thought he had no future.

Because of the loss of his father, Skelton went to work as early as the age of seven, selling newspapers and doing other odd jobs to help his family, who had lost the family store and their home. He quickly learned the newsboy&#x27;s patter and would keep it up until a prospective buyer bought a copy of the paper just to quiet him. According to later accounts, Skelton&#x27;s early interest in becoming an entertainer stemmed from an incident that took place in Vincennes around 1923, when a stranger, supposedly the comedian Ed Wynn, approached Skelton, who was the newsboy selling papers outside a Vincennes theater. When the man asked Skelton what events were going on in town, Skelton suggested he see the new show in town. The man purchased every paper Skelton had, providing enough money for the boy to purchase a ticket for himself. The stranger turned out to be one of the show&#x27;s stars, who later took the boy backstage to introduce him to the other performers. The experience prompted Skelton, who had already shown comedic tendencies, to pursue a career as a performer.

Skelton discovered at an early age that he could make people laugh. He dropped out of school around 1926 or 1927, when he was 13 or 14 years old, but he already had some experience performing in minstrel shows in Vincennes, and on a showboat, &quot;The Cotton Blossom&quot;, that plied the Ohio and Missouri rivers. He enjoyed his work on the riverboat, moving on only after he realized that showboat entertainment was coming to an end. Skelton, who was interested in all forms of acting, took a dramatic role with the John Lawrence stock theater company, but was unable to deliver his lines in a serious manner; the audience laughed instead. In another incident, while performing in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, Skelton was on an unseen treadmill; when it malfunctioned and began working in reverse, the frightened young actor called out, &quot;Help! I&#x27;m backing into heaven!&quot; He was fired before completing a week&#x27;s work in the role. At the age of 15, Skelton did some early work on the burlesque circuit, and reportedly spent four months with the Hagenbeck-Wallace Circus in 1929, when he was 16 years old.

Ida Skelton, who held multiple jobs to support her family after the death of her husband, did not suggest that her youngest son run away from home to become an entertainer, but &quot;his destiny had caught up with him at an early age&quot;. She let him go with her blessing. Times were tough during the Great Depression, and it may have meant one fewer child for her to feed. Around 1929, while Skelton was still a teen, he joined &quot;Doc&quot; R.E. Lewis&#x27;s traveling medicine show as an errand boy who sold bottles of medicine to the audience. During one show, when Skelton accidentally fell from the stage, breaking several bottles of medicine as he fell, people laughed. Both Lewis and Skelton realized one could earn a living with this ability and the fall was worked into the show. He also told jokes and sang in the medicine show during his four years there. Skelton earned ten dollars a week, and sent all of it home to his mother. When she worried that he was keeping nothing for his own needs, Skelton reassured her: &quot;We get plenty to eat, and we sleep in the wagon.&quot;

===Burlesque to vaudeville (1929–1937)===

As burlesque comedy material became progressively more ribald, Skelton moved on. He insisted that he was no prude; &quot;I just didn&#x27;t think the lines were funny&quot;. He became a sought-after master of ceremonies for dance marathons (known as &quot;walkathons&quot; at the time), a popular fad in the 1930s. The winner of one of the marathons was Edna Stillwell, an usher at the old Pantages Theater. She approached Skelton after winning the contest and told him that she did not like his jokes; he asked if she could do better. They married in 1931 in Kansas City, and Edna began writing his material. At the time of their marriage Skelton was one month away from his 18th birthday; Edna was 16. When they learned that Skelton&#x27;s salary was to be cut, Edna went to see the boss; Red resented the interference, until she came away with not only a raise, but additional considerations as well. Since he had left school at an early age, his wife bought textbooks and taught him what he had missed. With Edna&#x27;s help, Skelton received a high school equivalency degree.

The couple put together an act and began booking it at small midwestern theaters. When an offer came for an engagement in Harwich Port, Massachusetts, some 2,000 miles from Kansas City, they were pleased to get it because of its proximity to their ultimate goal, the vaudeville houses of New York City. To get to Massachusetts they bought a used car and borrowed five dollars from Edna&#x27;s mother, but by the time they arrived in St. Louis they had only fifty cents. Skelton asked Edna to collect empty cigarette packs; she thought he was joking, but did as he asked. He then spent their fifty cents on bars of soap, which they cut into small cubes and wrapped with the tinfoil from the cigarette packs. By selling their products for fifty cents each as fog remover for eyeglasses, the Skeltons were able to afford a hotel room every night as they worked their way to Harwich Port.

====&quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot;====

Skelton and Edna worked for a year in Camden, New Jersey, and were able to get an engagement at Montreal&#x27;s Lido Club in 1934 through a friend who managed the chorus lines at New York&#x27;s Roxy Theatre. Despite an initial rocky start, the act was a success, and brought them more theater dates throughout Canada.

Skelton&#x27;s performances in Canada led to new opportunities and the inspiration for a new, innovative routine that brought him recognition in the years to come. While performing in Montreal, the Skeltons met Harry Anger, a vaudeville producer for New York City&#x27;s Loew&#x27;s State Theatre. Anger promised the pair a booking as a headlining act at Loew&#x27;s, but they would need to come up with new material for the engagement. While the Skeltons were having breakfast in a Montreal diner, Edna had an idea for a new routine as she and Skelton observed the other patrons eating doughnuts and drinking coffee. They devised the &quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot; routine, with Skelton&#x27;s visual impressions of how different people ate doughnuts. The skit won them the Loew&#x27;s State engagement and a handsome fee.

The couple viewed the Loew&#x27;s State engagement in 1937 as Skelton&#x27;s big chance. They hired New York comedy writers to prepare material for the engagement, believing they needed more sophisticated jokes and skits than the routines Skelton normally performed. However, his New York audience did not laugh or applaud until Skelton abandoned the newly-written material and began performing the &quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot; and his older routines. The doughnut-dunking routine also helped Skelton rise to celebrity status. In 1937, while he was entertaining at the Capitol Theater in Washington, D.C., President Franklin D. Roosevelt invited Skelton to perform at a White House luncheon. During one of the official toasts, Skelton grabbed Roosevelt&#x27;s glass, saying, &quot;Careful what you drink, Mr. President. I got rolled in a place like this once.&quot; His humor appealed to FDR and Skelton became the master of ceremonies for Roosevelt&#x27;s official birthday celebration for many years afterward.

===Film work===

Skelton&#x27;s first contact with Hollywood came in the form of a failed 1932 screen test. In 1938, he made his film debut for RKO Pictures in the supporting role of a camp counselor in &quot;Having Wonderful Time&quot;. He appeared in two short subjects for Vitaphone in 1939: &quot;Seeing Red&quot; and &quot;The Broadway Buckaroo&quot;. Actor Mickey Rooney contacted Skelton, urging him to try for work in films after seeing him perform his &quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot; act at President Roosevelt&#x27;s 1940 birthday party. For his Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (MGM) screen test, Skelton performed many of his more popular skits, such as &quot;Guzzler&#x27;s Gin&quot;, but added some impromptu pantomimes as the cameras were rolling. &quot;Imitation of Movie Heroes Dying&quot; were Skelton&#x27;s impressions of the cinema deaths of stars such as George Raft, Edward G. Robinson, and James Cagney.

Skelton appeared in numerous films for MGM throughout the 1940s. In 1940, he provided comic relief as a lieutenant in Frank Borzage&#x27;s war drama &quot;Flight Command&quot;, opposite Robert Taylor, Ruth Hussey, and Walter Pidgeon. In 1941, he also provided comic relief in Harold S. Bucquet&#x27;s &quot;Dr. Kildare&quot; medical dramas, &quot;Dr. Kildare&#x27;s Wedding Day&quot; and &quot;The People vs. Dr. Kildare&quot;. Skelton was soon starring in comedy features as inept radio detective &quot;The Fox&quot;, the first of which was &quot;Whistling in the Dark&quot; (1941) in which he began working with director S. Sylvan Simon, who became his favorite director. He reprised the same role opposite Ann Rutherford in Simon&#x27;s other pictures, including &quot;Whistling in Dixie&quot; (1942) and &quot;Whistling in Brooklyn&quot; (1943). In 1941, Skelton began appearing in musical comedies, starring opposite Eleanor Powell, Ann Sothern, and Robert Young in Norman Z. McLeod&#x27;s &quot;Lady Be Good&quot;. In 1942, Skelton again starred opposite Eleanor Powell in Edward Buzzell&#x27;s &quot;Ship Ahoy&quot;, and alongside Ann Sothern in McLeod&#x27;s &quot;Panama Hattie&quot;.

In 1943, after a memorable role as a nightclub hatcheck attendant who becomes King Louis XV of France in a dream opposite Lucille Ball and Gene Kelly in Roy Del Ruth&#x27;s &quot;Du Barry Was a Lady&quot;, Skelton starred as Joseph Rivington Reynolds, a hotel valet besotted with Broadway starlet Constance Shaw (Powell) in Vincente Minnelli&#x27;s romantic musical comedy, &quot;I Dood It&quot;. The film was largely a remake of Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Spite Marriage&quot;; Keaton, who had become a comedy consultant to MGM after his film career had diminished, began coaching Skelton on set during the filming. Keaton worked in this capacity on several of Skelton&#x27;s films, and his 1926 film &quot;The General&quot; was also later rewritten to become Skelton&#x27;s &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot; (1948), under directors S. Sylvan Simon and Edward Sedgwick. Keaton was so convinced of Skelton&#x27;s comedic talent that he approached MGM studio head Louis B. Mayer with a request to create a small company within MGM for himself and Skelton, where the two could work on film projects. Keaton offered to forgo his salary if the films made by the company were not box-office hits; Mayer chose to decline the request. In 1944, Skelton starred opposite Esther Williams in George Sidney&#x27;s musical comedy &quot;Bathing Beauty&quot;, playing a songwriter with romantic difficulties. He next had a relatively minor role as a &quot;TV announcer who, in the course of demonstrating a brand of gin, progresses from mild inebriation through messy drunkenness to full-blown stupor&quot; in the &quot;When Television Comes&quot; segment of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot;, which featured William Powell and Judy Garland in the main roles. In 1946, Skelton played boastful clerk J. Aubrey Piper opposite Marilyn Maxwell and Marjorie Main in Harry Beaumont&#x27;s comedy picture &quot;The Show-Off&quot;.

Skelton&#x27;s contract called for MGM&#x27;s approval prior to his radio shows and other appearances. When he renegotiated his long-term contract with MGM, he wanted a clause that permitted him to remain working in radio and to be able to work on television, which was then largely experimental. At the time, the major work in the medium was centered in New York; Skelton had worked there for some time, and was able to determine that he would find success with his physical comedy through the medium. By 1947, Skelton&#x27;s work interests were focused not on films, but on radio and television. His MGM contract was rigid enough to require the studio&#x27;s written consent for his weekly radio shows, as well as any benefit or similar appearances he made; radio offered fewer restrictions, more creative control, and a higher salary. Skelton asked for a release from MGM after learning he could not raise the $750,000 needed to buy out the remainder of his contract. He also voiced frustration with the film scripts he was offered while on the set of &quot;The Fuller Brush Man&quot;, saying, &quot;Movies are not my field. Radio and television are.&quot; He did not receive the desired television clause nor a release from his MGM contract. In 1948, columnist Sheilah Graham printed that Skelton&#x27;s wishes were to make only one film a year, spending the rest of the time traveling the U.S. with his radio show.

Skelton&#x27;s ability to successfully &quot;ad lib&quot; often meant that the way the script was written was not always the way it was recorded on film. Some directors were delighted with the creativity, but others were often frustrated by it. S. Sylvan Simon, who became a close friend, allowed Skelton free rein when directing him. MGM became annoyed with Simon during the filming of &quot;The Fuller Brush Man&quot;, as the studio contended that Skelton should have been playing romantic leads instead of performing slapstick. Simon and MGM parted company when he was not asked to direct retakes of Skelton&#x27;s &quot;A Southern Yankee&quot;; Simon asked that his name be removed from the film&#x27;s credits.

Skelton was willing to negotiate with MGM to extend the agreement provided he would receive the right to pursue television. This time, the studio was willing to grant it, making Skelton the only major MGM personality with the privilege. The 1950 negotiations allowed him to begin working in television beginning September 30, 1951. During the last portion of his contract with the studio, Skelton was working in radio and on television in addition to films. He went on to appear in films such as Jack Donohue&#x27;s &quot;The Yellow Cab Man&quot; (1950), Roy Rowland and Buster Keaton&#x27;s &quot;Excuse My Dust&quot; (1951), Charles Walters&#x27; &quot;Texas Carnival&quot; (1951), Mervyn LeRoy&#x27;s &quot;Lovely to Look At&quot; (1952), Robert Z. Leonard&#x27;s &quot;The Clown&quot; (1953), and &quot;The Great Diamond Robbery&quot; (1954), and Norman Z. McLeod&#x27;s poorly received &quot;Public Pigeon No. 1&quot; (1957), his last major film role, which originated incidentally from an episode of the television anthology series &quot;Climax!&quot;. In a 1956 interview, he said he would never work simultaneously in all three media again. As a result, Skelton would make only a few appearances in films after this, including playing a saloon drunk in &quot;Around the World in Eighty Days&quot; (1956), a fictional version of himself as a gambler in &quot;Ocean&#x27;s 11&quot; (1960), and a Neanderthal man in &quot;Those Magnificent Men in Their Flying Machines&quot; (1965).

===Radio, divorce, and remarriage (1937–1951)===
Performing the &quot;Doughnut Dunkers&quot; routine led to Skelton&#x27;s first appearance on Rudy Vallée&#x27;s &quot;The Fleischmann&#x27;s Yeast Hour&quot; on August 12, 1937. Vallée&#x27;s program had a talent-show segment, and those who were searching for stardom were eager to be heard on it. Vallée also booked veteran comic and fellow Indiana native Joe Cook to appear as a guest with Skelton. The two Hoosiers proceeded to trade jokes about their home towns, with Skelton contending to Cook, an Evansville native, that the city was a suburb of Vincennes. The show received enough fan mail after the performance to invite both comedians back two weeks after Skelton&#x27;s initial appearance and again in November of that year.

On October 1, 1938, Skelton replaced Red Foley as the host of &quot;Avalon Time&quot; on NBC; Edna also joined the show&#x27;s cast, under her maiden name. She developed a system for working with the show&#x27;s writers – selecting material from them, adding her own, and filing the unused bits and lines for future use; the Skeltons worked on &quot;Avalon Time&quot; until late 1939. Skelton&#x27;s work in films led to a new regular radio-show offer; between films, he promoted himself and MGM by appearing without charge at Los Angeles-area banquets. A radio advertising agent was a guest at one of his banquet performances and recommended Skelton to one of his clients.

Skelton went on the air with his own radio show, &quot;The Raleigh Cigarette Program&quot;, on October 7, 1941. The bandleader for the show was Ozzie Nelson; his wife, Harriet, who worked under her maiden name of Hilliard, was the show&#x27;s vocalist and also worked with Skelton in skits.

====&quot;I dood it!&quot;====
Skelton introduced the first two of his many characters during &quot;The Raleigh Cigarette Program&#x27;s&quot; first season. The character of Clem Kadiddlehopper was based on a Vincennes neighbor named Carl Hopper, who was hard of hearing. After the cartoon character Bullwinkle was introduced, Skelton contemplated filing a lawsuit against Bill Scott, who voiced the cartoon moose, because he found it similar to his voice pattern for Clem. The second character, the Mean Widdle Kid, or &quot;Junior&quot;, was a young boy full of mischief, who typically did things he was told not to do. &quot;Junior&quot; would say things like, &quot;If I dood it, I gets a whipping.&quot;, followed moments later by the statement, &quot;I dood it!&quot; Skelton performed the character at home with Edna, giving him the nickname &quot;Junior&quot; long before it was heard by a radio audience. While the phrase was Skelton&#x27;s, the idea of using the character on the radio show was Edna&#x27;s. Skelton starred in a 1943 movie of the same name, but did not play &quot;Junior&quot; in the film.

The phrase was such a part of national culture at the time that, when General Doolittle conducted the bombing of Tokyo in 1942, many newspapers used the phrase &quot;Doolittle Dood It&quot; as a headline. After a talk with President Roosevelt in 1943, Skelton used his radio show to collect funds for a Douglas A-20 Havoc to be given to the Soviet Army to help fight World War II. Asking children to send in their spare change, he raised enough money for the aircraft in two weeks; he named the bomber &quot;We Dood It!&quot; In 1986, Soviet newspaper &quot;Pravda&quot; offered praise to Skelton for his 1943 gift, and in 1993, the pilot of the plane was able to meet Skelton and thank him for the bomber.

Skelton also added a routine he had been performing since 1928. Originally called &quot;Mellow Cigars&quot;, the skit was about an announcer who became ill as he smoked his sponsor&#x27;s product. Brown and Williamson, the makers of cigarettes, asked Skelton to change some aspects of the skit; he renamed the routine &quot;Guzzler&#x27;s Gin&quot;, where the announcer became inebriated while sampling and touting the imaginary sponsor&#x27;s wares. While the traditional radio program called for its cast to do an audience warm-up in preparation for the broadcast, Skelton did just the opposite. After the regular radio program had ended, the show&#x27;s audience was treated to a post-program performance. He then performed his &quot;Guzzler&#x27;s Gin&quot; or any of more than 350 routines for those who had come to the radio show. He updated and revised his post-show routines as diligently as those for his radio program. As a result, studio audience tickets for Skelton&#x27;s radio show were in high demand; at times, up to 300 people had to be turned away for lack of seats.

====Divorce from Edna, marriage to Georgia====
In 1942, Edna announced that she was leaving Skelton, but would continue to manage his career and write material for him. He did not realize she was serious until Edna issued a statement about the impending divorce through NBC. They were divorced in 1943, leaving the courtroom arm in arm. The couple did not discuss the reasons for their divorce, and Edna initially prepared to work as a script writer for other radio programs. When the divorce was finalized, she went to New York, leaving her former husband three fully-prepared show scripts. Skelton and those associated with him sent telegrams and called her, asking her to come back to him in a professional capacity. Edna remained the manager of the couple&#x27;s funds because Skelton spent money too easily. An attempt at managing his own checking account that began with a $5,000 balance, ended five days later after a call to Edna saying the account was overdrawn. Skelton had a weekly allowance of $75, with Edna making investments for him, choosing real estate and other relatively-stable assets. She remained an advisor on his career until 1952, receiving a generous weekly salary for life for her efforts.

The divorce meant that Skelton had lost his married man&#x27;s deferment; he was once again classified as 1-A for service. He was drafted into the Army in early 1944; both MGM and his radio sponsor tried to obtain a deferment for the comedian, but to no avail. His last Raleigh radio show was on June 6, 1944, the day before he was formally inducted as a private; he was not assigned to Special Services at that time. Without its star, the program was discontinued, and the opportunity presented itself for the Nelsons to begin a radio show of their own, &quot;The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet&quot;.

By 1944, Skelton was engaged to actress Muriel Morris, who was also known as Muriel Chase; the couple had obtained a marriage license and told the press they intended to marry within a few days. At the last minute, the actress decided not to marry him, initially saying she intended to marry a wealthy businessman in Mexico City. She later recanted the story about marrying the businessman, but continued to say that her relationship with Skelton was over. The actress further denied that the reason for the breakup was Edna&#x27;s continuing to manage her ex-husband&#x27;s career; Edna stated that she had no intention of either getting in the middle of the relationship or reconciling with her former husband.
He was on army furlough for throat discomfort when he married actress Georgia Maureen Davis in Beverly Hills, California, on March 9, 1945; the couple met on the MGM lot. Skelton traveled to Los Angeles from the eastern army base where he was assigned for the wedding. He knew he would possibly be assigned overseas soon, and wanted the marriage to take place first. After the wedding, he entered the hospital to have his tonsils removed. The couple had two children; Valentina, a daughter, was born May 5, 1947, and a son, Richard, was born May 20, 1948.

====A cast of characters====

Skelton served in the United States Army during World War II, initially with the field artillery at Camp Roberts, California, and Camp Ord with the double duty of entertaining soldiers. After being assigned to the Special Services, Skelton performed as many as 12 shows per day before troops in both the United States and in Europe. The pressure of his workload caused him to suffer exhaustion and a nervous breakdown. He had a nervous collapse while in the Army, following which he developed a stutter. While recovering at an army hospital at Camp Pickett, Virginia, he met a soldier who had been severely wounded and was not expected to survive. Skelton devoted a lot of time and effort to trying to make the man laugh. As a result of this effort, his stutter reduced; his army friend&#x27;s condition also improved, and he was no longer on the critical list. He was released from his army duties in September 1945. &quot;I&#x27;ve been told I&#x27;m the only celebrity who entered the Army as a private and came out a private,&quot; he told reporters. His sponsor was eager to have him back on the air, and Skelton&#x27;s program began anew on NBC on December 4, 1945.

Upon returning to radio, Skelton brought with him many new characters that were added to his repertoire: Bolivar Shagnasty, described as a &quot;loudmouthed braggart&quot;; Cauliflower McPugg, a boxer; Deadeye, a cowboy; Willie Lump-Lump, a fellow who drank too much; and San Fernando Red, a confidence man with political aspirations. By 1947, Skelton&#x27;s musical conductor was David Rose, who went on to television with him; he had worked with Rose during his time in the Army and wanted Rose to join him on the radio show when it went back on the air.

On April 22, 1947, Skelton was censored by NBC two minutes into his radio show. When his announcer Rod O&#x27;Connor and he began talking about Fred Allen being censored the previous week, they were silenced for 15 seconds; comedian Bob Hope was given the same treatment once he began referring to the censoring of Allen. Skelton forged on with his lines for his studio audience&#x27;s benefit; the material he insisted on using had been edited from the script by the network before the broadcast. He had been briefly censored the previous month for the use of the word &quot;diaper&quot;. After the April incidents, NBC indicated it would no longer pull the plug for similar reasons.

Skelton changed sponsors in 1948; Brown &amp; Williamson, owners of Raleigh cigarettes, withdrew due to program production costs. His new sponsor was Procter &amp; Gamble&#x27;s Tide laundry detergent. The next year, he changed networks, going from NBC to CBS, where his radio show aired until May 1953. After his network radio contract was over, he signed a three-year contract with Ziv Radio for a syndicated radio program in 1954. His syndicated radio program was offered as a daily show; it included segments of his older network radio programs, and new material done for the syndication. He was able to use portions of his older radio shows because he owned the rights for rebroadcasting them.

===Television (1951–1970)===
Skelton was unable to work in television until the end of his 1951 MGM movie contract; a renegotiation to extend the pact provided permission after that point. On May 4, 1951, he signed a contract for television with NBC; Procter and Gamble was his sponsor. He said he would be performing the same characters on television that he had been doing on radio. The MGM agreement with Skelton for television performances did not allow him to go on the air before September 30, 1951.

His television debut, &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot;, premiered on that date: At the end of his opening monolog, two men backstage grabbed his ankles from behind the set curtain, hauling him offstage face down. A 1943 instrumental hit by David Rose, called &quot;Holiday for Strings&quot;, became Skelton&#x27;s TV theme song. The move to television allowed him to create two nonhuman characters, seagulls Gertrude and Heathcliffe, which he performed while the pair were flying by, tucking his thumbs under his arms to represent wings and shaping his hat to look like a bird&#x27;s bill. He patterned his meek, henpecked television character of George Appleby after his radio character, J. Newton Numbskull, who had similar characteristics. His &quot;Freddie the Freeloader&quot; clown was introduced on the program in 1952, with Skelton copying his father&#x27;s makeup for the character. (He learned how to duplicate his father&#x27;s makeup and perform his routines through his mother&#x27;s recollections.) A ritual was established for the end of every program, with Skelton&#x27;s shy, boyish wave and words of &quot;Good night and may God bless.&quot;
During the 1951–1952 season, the program was broadcast from a converted NBC radio studio. The first year of the television show was done live; this led to problems, because not enough time was available for costume changes; Skelton was on camera for most of the half hour, including the delivery of a commercial that was written into one of the show&#x27;s skits. In early 1952, Skelton had an idea for a television sketch about someone who had been drinking not knowing which way is up. The script was completed, and he had the show&#x27;s production crew build a set that was perpendicular to the stage, so it would give the illusion that someone was walking on walls. The skit, starring his character Willie Lump-Lump, called for the character&#x27;s wife to hire a carpenter to redo the living room in an effort to teach her husband a lesson about his drinking. When Willie wakes up there after a night of drinking, he is misled into believing he is not lying on the floor, but on the living room wall. Willie&#x27;s wife goes about the house normally, but to Willie, she appears to be walking on a wall. Within an hour after the broadcast, the NBC switchboard had received 350 calls regarding the show, and Skelton had received more than 2,500 letters about the skit within a week of its airing.

Skelton was delivering an intense performance live each week, and the strain showed in physical illness. In 1952, he was drinking heavily due to the constant physical pain of a diaphragmatic hernia and the emotional distress of marital problems. He thought about divorcing Georgia. NBC agreed to film his shows in the 1952–1953 season at Eagle Lion Studios, next to the Sam Goldwyn Studio, on Santa Monica Boulevard in Hollywood. Later, the show was moved to the new NBC television studios in Burbank. Procter and Gamble was unhappy with the filming of the television show, and insisted that Skelton return to live broadcasts. The situation made him think about leaving television. Declining ratings prompted sponsor Procter &amp; Gamble to cancel his show in the spring of 1953. Skelton announced that any of his future television programs would be variety shows, where he would not have the almost constant burden of performing. Beginning with the 1953–1954 season, he switched to CBS, where he remained until 1970. For the initial move to CBS, he had no sponsor. The network gambled by covering all expenses for the program on a sustaining basis: His first CBS sponsor was Geritol. He curtailed his drinking and his ratings at CBS began to improve, especially after he began appearing on Tuesday nights for co-sponsors Johnson&#x27;s Wax and Pet Milk Company.

By 1955, Skelton was broadcasting some of his weekly programs in color, which was the case about 100 times
between 1955 and 1960. He tried to encourage CBS to do other shows in color at the facility, but CBS mostly avoided color broadcasting after the network&#x27;s television-set manufacturing division was discontinued in 1951. By 1959, Skelton was the only comedian with a weekly variety television show. Others who remained on the air, such as Danny Thomas, were performing their routines as part of situation comedy programs. He performed a preview show for a studio audience on Mondays, using their reactions to determine which skits required editing for the Tuesday program. For the Tuesday afternoon run-through prior to the actual show, he ignored the script for the most part, ad-libbing through it at will. The run-through was well attended by CBS Television City employees. Sometimes during live telecasts and taped programs, Skelton would break up or cause his guest stars to laugh.

====Richard&#x27;s illness and death====

At the height of Skelton&#x27;s popularity, his 9-year-old son Richard was diagnosed with leukemia and was given a year to live. While the network told him to take as much time off as necessary, Skelton felt that unless he went back to his television show, he would be unable to be at ease and make his son&#x27;s life a happy one. He returned to his television show on January 15, 1957, with guest star Mickey Rooney helping to lift his spirits. In happier times, he had frequently mentioned his children on his program, but he found it extremely difficult to do this after Richard became ill. Skelton resumed this practice only after his son asked him to do so. After his son&#x27;s diagnosis, Skelton took his family on an extended trip, so Richard could see as much of the world as possible. The Skeltons had an audience with Pope Pius XII on July 22, 1957. According to an International News Service article that appeared in the August 1, 1957, issue of the St.Joseph, Missouri News Press, Richard said that the audience with the Pope was the high point of the trip so far. The Skeltons cut their travels short and returned to the United States after an encounter with an aggressive reporter in London and relentlessly negative reports in British newspapers.

The Skelton family received support from CBS management and from the public following the announcement of Richard&#x27;s illness. In November, Skelton fell down stairs and injured an ankle, and he nearly died after a &quot;cardiac-asthma&quot; attack on December 30, 1957. He was taken to St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, where, his doctors said, &quot;if there were ten steps to death, Red Skelton had taken nine of them by the time he had arrived&quot;. Skelton later said he was working on some notes for television and the next thing he remembered, he was in a hospital bed; he did not know how serious his illness was until he read about it himself in the newspapers. His illness and recovery kept him off the air for a full month; Skelton returned to his television show on January 28, 1958.

Richard died on May 10, 1958, 10 days before his 10th birthday. Skelton was scheduled to do his weekly television show on the day his son was buried. Though recordings of some older programs were available that the network could have run, he asked that guest performers be used, instead. His friends in the television, film and music industries organized &quot;The Friends Of Red Skelton Variety Show&quot;, which they performed to replace &quot;The Red Skelton Show&quot; for that week; by May 27, 1958, Skelton had returned to his program. Richard‘s death had a profound effect on the family. &quot;Life&quot; magazine, profiling &quot;The Invincible Red&quot; on April 21, 1961, observed that Skelton was still &quot;racked [sic]&quot; by his son’s death. In 1962, the Skelton family moved to Palm Springs, and Skelton used the Bel Air home only on the two days a week when he was in Los Angeles for his television show taping.

====&quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;====
In early 1960, Skelton purchased the old Charlie Chaplin Studios and updated it for videotape recording. With a recently purchased three-truck mobile color television unit, he recorded a number of his series episodes and specials in color. Even with his color facilities, CBS discontinued color broadcasts on a regular basis and Skelton shortly thereafter sold the studio to CBS and the mobile unit to local station KTLA. Prior to this, he had been filming at Desilu Productions. Skelton then moved back to the network&#x27;s Television City facilities, where he taped his programs until he left the network. In the fall of 1962, CBS expanded his program to a full hour, retitling it &quot;The Red Skelton Hour&quot;. Although it was a staple of his radio programs, he did not perform his &quot;Junior&quot; character on television until 1962, after extending the length of his program.
Skelton frequently employed the art of pantomime for his characters; a segment of his weekly program was called the &quot;Silent Spot&quot;. He attributed his liking for pantomime and for using few props to the early days when he did not want to have a lot of luggage. He explained that having the right hat was the key to getting into character.

Skelton&#x27;s season premiere for the 1960–1961 television season was a tribute to the United Nations. About 600 people from the organization, including diplomats, were invited to be part of the audience for the show. The program was entirely done in pantomime, as UN representatives from 39 nations were in the studio audience. One of the sketches he performed for the UN was that of the old man watching the parade. The sketch had its origins in a question Skelton&#x27;s son, Richard, asked his father about what happens when people die. He told his son, &quot;They join a parade and start marching.&quot; In 1965, Skelton did another show completely in pantomime. This time, he was joined by Marcel Marceau; the two artists alternated performances for the hour-long program, sharing the stage to perform Pinocchio. The only person who spoke during the hour was Maurice Chevalier, who served as the show&#x27;s narrator.

In 1969, Skelton wrote and performed a monolog about the Pledge of Allegiance. In the speech, he commented on the meaning of each phrase of the pledge. He credited one of his Vincennes grammar-school teachers, Mr. Laswell, with the original speech. The teacher had grown tired of hearing his students monotonously recite the pledge each morning; he then demonstrated to them how it should be recited, along with comments about the meaning behind each phrase. CBS received 200,000 requests for copies; the company subsequently released the monolog as a single on Columbia Records. A year later, he performed the monolog for President Richard Nixon at the first &quot;Evening at the White House&quot;, a series of entertainment events honoring the recently inaugurated president.

===Off the air and bitterness (1970–1983)===
As the 1970s began, the networks began a major campaign to discontinue long-running shows that they considered stale, dominated by older demographics, and/or becoming too expensive due to escalating costs. Despite Skelton&#x27;s continued strong overall viewership, CBS saw his show as fitting into this category and canceled the program along with other comedy and variety shows hosted by veterans such as Jackie Gleason and Ed Sullivan. Performing in Las Vegas when he got the news of his CBS cancellation, Skelton said, &quot;My heart has been broken.&quot; His program had been one of the top-10, highest-rated shows for 17 of the 20 years he was on television. 

Skelton moved to NBC in 1970 in a half-hour Monday-night version of his former show. Its cancellation after one season ended his television career, and he returned to live performances. In an effort to prove the networks wrong, he gave many of these at colleges and proved popular with the audiences.
Skelton was bitter about CBS&#x27;s cancellation for many years afterwards. Believing the demographic and salary issues to be irrelevant, he accused CBS of bowing to the antiestablishment, antiwar faction at the height of the Vietnam War, saying his conservative political and social views caused the network to turn against him. He had invited prominent Republicans, including Vice President Spiro Agnew and Senate Republican Minority Leader Everett Dirksen, one of the Senate’s strongest supporters of the war, to appear on his program.

Personal, as well as professional, changes occurred in Skelton&#x27;s life at this time. He divorced Georgia in 1971 and married Lothian Toland, daughter of cinematographer Gregg Toland, on October 7, 1973. While he disassociated himself from television soon after his show was canceled, his bitterness had subsided enough for him to appear on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; on July 11, 1975; it was his first television appearance since the cancellation of his television program. (Johnny Carson, one of his former writers, began his rise to network television prominence when he substituted for Skelton after a dress rehearsal injury in 1954.) Skelton was also a guest on &quot;The Merv Griffin Show&quot; in October of the same year. Hopes he may have had that he could ease back into television through the talk-show circuit were ended on May 10, 1976, when Georgia Skelton committed suicide by gunshot on the 18th anniversary of Richard Skelton&#x27;s death. Georgia was 54 and had been in poor health for some time. He put all professional activities on hold for some months as he mourned his former wife&#x27;s death. Despite his anger at CBS, Skelton participated in the CBS 50th anniversary specials in April and May 1978.

Skelton made plans in 1977 to sell the rights to his old television programs as part of a package that would bring him back to regular television appearances. The package called for him to produce one new television show for every three older episodes; this did not materialize. In 1980, he was taken to court by 13 of his former writers over a report that his will called for the destruction of recordings of all his old television shows upon his death. Skelton contended his remarks were made at a time when he was very unhappy with the television industry and were taken out of context. He said at the time, &quot;Would you burn the only monument you&#x27;ve built in over 20 years?&quot; As the owner of the television shows, Skelton initially refused to allow them to be syndicated as reruns during his lifetime. In 1983, Group W announced that it had come to terms with him for the rights to rebroadcast some of his original television programs from 1966 through 1970; some of his earlier shows were made available after Skelton&#x27;s death.

===Red Skelton onstage===
Skelton&#x27;s 70-year career as an entertainer began as a stage performer. He retained a fondness for theaters, and referred to them as &quot;palaces&quot;; he also likened them to his &quot;living room&quot;, where he would privately entertain guests. At the end of a performance, he would look at the empty stage where there was now no laughter or applause and tell himself, &quot;Tomorrow I must start again. One hour ago, I was a big man. I was important out there. Now it&#x27;s empty. It&#x27;s all gone.&quot;

Skelton was invited to play a four-week date at the London Palladium in July 1951. While flying to the engagement, Skelton, Georgia and Father Edward J. Carney, were on a plane from Rome with passengers from an assortment of countries that included 11 children. The plane lost the use of two of its four engines and seemed destined to lose the rest, meaning that the plane would crash over Mont Blanc. The priest readied himself to administer last rites. As he did so, he told Skelton, &quot;You take care of your department, Red, and I&#x27;ll take care of mine.&quot; Skelton diverted the attention of the passengers with pantomimes while Father Carney prayed. They ultimately landed at a small airstrip in Lyon, France. He received both an enthusiastic reception and an invitation to return for the Palladium&#x27;s Christmas show of that year.

Though Skelton had always done live engagements at Nevada hotels and appearances such as state fairs during his television show&#x27;s hiatus, he focused his time and energy on live performances after he was no longer on the air, performing up to 125 dates a year. He often arrived days early for his engagement and would serve as his own promotion staff, making the rounds of the local shopping malls. Before the show, his audiences received a ballot listing about 100 of his many routines and were asked to tick off their favorites. The venue&#x27;s ushers would collect the ballots and tally the votes. Skelton&#x27;s performance on that given day was based on the skits his audience selected. After he learned that his performances were popular with the hearing-impaired because of his heavy use of pantomimes, Skelton hired a sign language interpreter to translate the non-pantomime portions of his act for all his shows. He continued performing live until 1993, when he celebrated his 80th birthday.

===Later years and death===

In 1974, Skelton&#x27;s interest in film work was rekindled with the news that Neil Simon&#x27;s comedy &quot;The Sunshine Boys&quot; would become a movie; his last significant film appearance had been in &quot;Public Pigeon No. 1&quot; in 1956. He screen tested for the role of Willy Clark with Jack Benny, who had been cast as Al Lewis. Although Simon had planned to cast Jack Albertson, who played Willy on Broadway, in the same role for the film, Skelton&#x27;s screen test impressed him enough to change his mind. Skelton declined the part, however, reportedly due to an inadequate financial offer, and Benny&#x27;s final illness forced him to withdraw, as well. George Burns and Walter Matthau ultimately starred in the film.

In 1981, Skelton made several specials for HBO, including &quot;Freddie the Freeloader&#x27;s Christmas Dinner&quot; (1981) and the &quot;Funny Faces&quot; series of specials. He gave a Royal Command Performance for the Royal Society for the Protection of Birds in 1984, which was later shown in the U.S. on HBO. A portion of one of his last interviews, conducted by Steven F. Zambo, was broadcast as part of the 2005 PBS special &quot;The Pioneers of Primetime&quot;.

Skelton died on September 17, 1997, at the Eisenhower Medical Center in Rancho Mirage, California, at the age of 84, from pneumonia. He is interred in the Skelton Family Tomb, the family&#x27;s private room, alongside his son, Richard Freeman Skelton, Jr., and his second wife, Georgia Maureen Davis Skelton, in the Great Mausoleum&#x27;s Sanctuary of Benediction at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

==Art and other interests==
===Artwork===

Skelton began producing artwork in 1943, but kept his works private for many years. He said he was inspired to try his hand at painting after visiting a large Chicago department store that had various paintings on display. Inquiring as to the price of one, which Skelton described as &quot;a bunch of blotches&quot;, he was told, &quot;Ten thousand wouldn&#x27;t buy that one.&quot; He told the clerk he was one of the ten thousand who would not buy the painting, instead buying his own art materials. His wife Georgia, a former art student, persuaded him to have his first public showing of his work in 1964 at the Sands Hotel in Las Vegas, where he was performing at the time. Skelton believed painting was an asset to his comedy work, as it helped him to better visualize the imaginary props used in his pantomime routines.

In addition to his originals, Skelton also sold reproductions and prints through his own mail-order business. He made his work available to art galleries by selling them franchises to display and sell his paintings. He once estimated the sale of his lithographs earned him $2.5 million per year. Shortly after his death, his art dealer said he believed that Skelton made more money on his paintings than from his television work. At the time of his death, Skelton had produced over 1,000 oil paintings of clowns. When asked why his artwork focused on clowns, he said at first, &quot;I don&#x27;t know why it&#x27;s always clowns.&quot; He continued after thinking a moment by saying &quot;No, that&#x27;s not true—I do know why. I just don&#x27;t feel like thinking about it ...&quot; At the time of Skelton&#x27;s death, his originals were priced at $80,000 and upward.

===Other interests===
Skelton was a prolific writer of both short stories and music. After sleeping only four or five hours a night, he would wake up at 5 am and begin writing stories, composing music, and painting pictures. He wrote at least one short story a week and had composed over 8,000 songs and symphonies by the time of his death. He wrote commercials for Skoal tobacco and sold many of his compositions to Muzak, a company that specialized in providing background music to stores and other businesses. Skelton was also interested in photography; when attending Hollywood parties, he would take photos and give the film to newspaper reporters waiting outside. He was never without a miniature camera, and kept a photographic record of all his paintings. Skelton was also an avid gardener, who created his own Japanese and Italian gardens and cultivated &quot;bonsai&quot; trees at his home in Palm Springs. He owned a horse ranch in the Anza Valley.

==Fraternity and honors==
Skelton was a Freemason, a member of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was a member of both the Scottish and the York Rites. He was a recipient of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a $5 bill and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.

Skelton was made an honorary brother of Phi Sigma Kappa at Truman State University. In 1961, he became an honorary brother of the Phi Alpha Tau fraternity of Emerson College, when he was awarded the Joseph E. Connor Award for excellence in the field of communications. He also received an honorary degree from the college at the same ceremony. Skelton received an honorary high-school diploma from Vincennes High School. He was also an honorary member of Kappa Kappa Psi band fraternity; Skelton had composed many marches, which were used by more than 10,000 high-school and college bands. In 1986, Skelton received an honorary degree from Ball State University.

The Red Skelton Memorial Bridge spans the Wabash River and provides the highway link between Illinois and Indiana on U.S. Route 50, near Skelton&#x27;s home town of Vincennes. He attended the dedication ceremonies in 1963.

==Awards and recognition==
In 1952, Skelton received Emmy Awards for Best Comedy Program and Best Comedian. He also received an Emmy nomination in 1957 for his noncomedic performance in &quot;Playhouse 90&#x27;s&quot; presentation of &quot;The Big Slide&quot;. Skelton and his writers won another Emmy in 1961 for Outstanding Writing Achievement in Comedy. He was named an honorary faculty member of Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Clown College in 1968 and 1969.

Skelton&#x27;s first major post-television recognition came in 1978, when the Golden Globe Awards named him as the recipient for their Cecil B. DeMille Award, which is given to honor outstanding contributions in entertainment. His excitement was so great upon receiving the award and a standing ovation, that he clutched it tightly enough to break the statuette. When he was presented with the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Governor&#x27;s Award in 1986, Skelton received a standing ovation. &quot;I want to thank you for sitting down&quot;, he said when the ovation subsided. &quot;I thought you were pulling a CBS and walking out on me.&quot; The honor came 16 years after his television program left the airwaves.

Skelton received a Lifetime Achievement Award from the Screen Actors Guild in 1987, and in 1988, he was inducted into the Academy of Television Arts &amp; Sciences&#x27; Television Hall of Fame. He was one of the International Clown Hall of Fame&#x27;s first inductees in 1989. Skelton and Katharine Hepburn were honored with lifetime achievement awards by the American Comedy Awards in the same year. He was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1994. Skelton also has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for his radio and television work.

==Legacy and tributes==
Skelton preferred to be described as a clown rather than a comic: &quot;A comedian goes out and hits people right on. A clown uses pathos. He can be funny, then turn right around and reach people and touch them with what life is like.&quot; &quot;I just want to be known as a clown&quot;, he said, &quot;because to me that&#x27;s the height of my profession. It means you can do everything—sing, dance and above all, make people laugh.&quot; His purpose in life, he believed, was to make people laugh.

In &quot;Groucho and Me&quot;, Groucho Marx called Skelton &quot;the most unacclaimed clown in show business&quot;, and &quot;the logical successor to [Charlie] Chaplin&quot;, largely because of his ability to play a multitude of characters with minimal use of dialogue and props. &quot;With one prop, a soft battered hat&quot;, Groucho wrote, describing a performance he had witnessed, &quot;he successfully converted himself into an idiot boy, a peevish old lady, a teetering-tottering drunk, an overstuffed clubwoman, a tramp, and any other character that seemed to suit his fancy. No grotesque make-up, no funny clothes, just Red.&quot; He added that Skelton also &quot;plays a dramatic scene about as effectively as any of the dramatic actors.&quot; In late 1965, ventriloquist Edgar Bergen, reminiscing about the entertainment business, singled out Skelton for high praise. &quot;It&#x27;s all so very different today. The whole business of comedy has changed — from 15 minutes of quality to quantity. We had a lot of very funny people around, from Charley Chase to Charlie Chaplin and Laurel and Hardy. The last one of that breed is Red Skelton.&quot; Harry Cohn of Columbia Pictures also praised Skelton, saying, &quot;He&#x27;s a clown in the old tradition. He doesn&#x27;t need punch lines. He&#x27;s got heart.&quot;

Skelton and Marcel Marceau shared a long friendship and admiration of each other&#x27;s work. Marceau appeared on Skelton&#x27;s CBS television show three times, including one turn as the host in 1961 as Skelton recovered from surgery. He was also a guest on the three &quot;Funny Faces&quot; specials that Skelton produced for HBO. In a &quot;TV Guide&quot; interview after Skelton&#x27;s death, Marceau said, &quot;Red, you are eternal for me and the millions of people you made laugh and cry. May God bless you forever, my great and precious companion. I will never forget that silent world we created together.&quot; CBS issued the following statement upon his death: &quot;Red&#x27;s audience had no age limits. He was the consummate family entertainer—a winsome clown, a storyteller without peer, a superb mime, a singer, and a dancer.&quot;

The Red Skelton Performing Arts Center was dedicated in February 2006 on the campus of Vincennes University, one block from the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born. The building includes an 850-seat theater, classrooms, rehearsal rooms, and dressing rooms. Its grand foyer is a gallery for Skelton&#x27;s paintings, statues, and film posters. The theater hosts theatrical and musical productions by Vincennes University, as well as special events, convocations, and conventions. The adjacent Red Skelton Museum of American Comedy opened on July 18, 2013, on what would have been Skelton&#x27;s 100th birthday. It houses his personal and professional materials, which he had collected since the age of 10, in accordance with his wishes that they be made available in his hometown for the public&#x27;s enjoyment. Skelton&#x27;s widow, Lothian, noted that he expressed no interest in any sort of Hollywood memorial. The museum is funded jointly by the Red Skelton Museum Foundation and the Indiana Historical Society. Other foundation projects include a fund that provides new clothes to Vincennes children from low-income families. The foundation also purchased Skelton&#x27;s birthplace. On July 15, 2017, the state of Indiana unveiled a state historic marker at the home in Vincennes where Skelton was born.

The town of Vincennes has held an annual Red Skelton Festival since 2005. A &quot;Parade of a Thousand Clowns&quot;, billed as the largest clown parade in the Midwest, is followed by family-oriented activities and live music performances.

<text>Laguna de Bay (Spanish for &quot;Lagoon/Lake of Bay&quot;; , ), also known as Laguna Lake and alternatively spelled &quot;Laguna de Bae&quot;, is the largest lake in the Philippines. It is located southeast of Metro Manila, between the provinces of Laguna to the south and Rizal to the north. A freshwater lake, it has a surface area of 911–949 km2 (352–366 sq mi), with an average depth of about and an elevation of about one meter above sea level. The lake is shaped like a crow&#x27;s foot, with two peninsulas jutting out from the northern shore and filling the large volcanic Laguna Caldera. In the middle of the lake is the large island of Talim.

The lake is one of the primary sources of freshwater fish in the country. Its water drains to Manila Bay via the Pasig River. Environmental issues such as water quality problems created by population pressure and industrialization, invasive species and overfishing are of concern for the lake, hurting its economic importance to the country. As population expands in the Bay, it is expected to rely more heavily on the lake for freshwater supply, thus water quality directly affects human populations.

== Etymology ==

Laguna de Bay means &quot;Lagoon of [the town of] Bay&quot; for the lakeshore town of Bay (pronounced Bä&#x27;ï), the former provincial capital of Laguna province. Alternate spellings of the town&#x27;s name include &quot;Bae&quot; or &quot;Ba-i&quot;, and in the early colonial times, &quot;Bayi&quot; or &quot;Vahi&quot;. The town&#x27;s name is believed to have come from the Tagalog word for &quot;settlement&quot; (&quot;bahayan&quot;), and is related to the words for &quot;house&quot; (&quot;bahay&quot;), &quot;shore&quot; (&quot;baybayin&quot;), and &quot;boundary&quot; (&quot;baybay&quot;), among others. The introduction of the English language during the American administration of the Philippines, elicited confusion as the English word &quot;bay&quot;, referring to another body of water, was mistakenly substituted to the town name that led to its mispronunciation. However, the word &quot;Bay&quot; in Laguna de Bay has always referred to the town.

The Spanish word &quot;laguna&quot; refers to not just lagoons but also for freshwater lakes, aside from &quot;lago&quot;. This would make the lake&#x27;s alternate name, &quot;Laguna Lake&quot;, tautological. However, the &quot;Laguna&quot; in &quot;Laguna Lake&quot; refers to the province of Laguna, the province at the southern shore of the lake, and not the lake itself. The province, though, was in turn named after the lake and was originally called &quot;La Laguna&quot; until the early 20th century.

In the pre-Hispanic era, the lake was known as &quot;Puliran Kasumuran&quot; (Laguna Copperplate Inscription, 900 AD), and later by &quot;Pulilan&quot; (&quot;Vocabulario de la lengua tagala&quot;, 1613. Pila, Laguna).
Currently, the lake is often incorrectly called &quot;Laguna Bay,&quot; including in government websites, or &quot;Laguna Lake&quot;, which is used by the Laguna Lake Development Authority.

==Geography==
Laguna de Bay is a large shallow freshwater body in the heart of Luzon Island with an aggregate area of about and a shoreline of . It is considered to be the third largest inland body of water in Southeast Asia after Tonle Sap in Cambodia and Lake Toba in Sumatra, Indonesia. Laguna de Bay is bordered by the province of Laguna in the east, west and southwest, the province of Rizal in the north to northeast, and Metropolitan Manila in the northwest. The lake has an average depth of and its excess water is discharged through the Pasig River.

The middle part of Laguna de Bay between Mount Sembrano and Talim Island, is the Laguna Caldera believed to have been formed by two major volcanic eruptions, around 1 million and 27,000–29,000 years ago. Remnants of its volcanic history are shown by the presence of series of maars around the area of Tadlac Lake and Mayondon hill in Los Baños, Laguna, another maar at the southern end of Talim Island, and a solfataric field in Jala Jala.

=== Islands ===
Known lake islands include Talim, the largest and most populated island on the lake; Calamba Island, which is completely occupied by the Wonder Island resort in Calamba, Laguna; Cielito Lindo, a privately owned island off the coast of mainland Cardona, Rizal; Malahi Island which used to be the site of Maligi Island military reservation, near the southern tip of Talim; the nearby islands of Bonga and Pihan, also in Cardona; and Bay Island off the coast of Bay, Laguna, which is closely associated with the precolonial crocodile-deity myths of that town.

=== Tributaries ===
The lake is fed by of catchment areas and its 21 major tributaries. Among these are the Pagsanjan River which is the source of 35% of the Lake&#x27;s water, the Santa Cruz River which is the source of 15% of the Lake&#x27;s water, the Marikina River (through the Manggahan Floodway), the Mangangate River, the Tunasan River, the San Pedro River, the Cabuyao River, the San Cristobal River, the San Juan River, the Bay, Calo and Maitem rivers in Bay, the Molawin, Dampalit and Pele rivers in Los Baños, the Pangil River, the Tanay River, the Morong River, the Siniloan River and the Sapang Baho River.
The lake is primarily drained through the Pasig River, which is technically a tidal estuary instead of a unidirectional &quot;river.&quot;

==Uses==

The lake is a multipurpose resource, used for fishery, transportation, irrigation of agricultural lands, power generation, and as a reservoir for regional flood management, among other things.

The lake has been used as a navigation lane for passenger boats since the Spanish colonial era. It is also used as a source of water for the Kalayaan Pumped-Storage Hydroelectric Project in Kalayaan, Laguna. Other uses include fishery, aquaculture, recreation, food support for the growing duck industry, irrigation and a &quot;virtual&quot; cistern for domestic, agricultural, and industrial effluents.

On December 15, 2023, Marcos, Jr., assisted by Maynilad president and CEO Ramoncito Fernandez, MWSS administrator, Leonor Cleofas and Manuel Pangilinan inaugurated Maynilad Water Services’s P11-billion Poblacion Water Treatment Plant in Muntinlupa City. The operation and maintenance of the Laguna Lake Drinking Water Treatment Plant was awarded by Maynilad Water Services to Acciona, CEO José Díaz-Caneja, and D.M Consulting Inc.-DMCI Holdings, Inc. It will process 150 million liters of drinking water a day from Laguna de Bay.

==Environmental issues==

Because of its importance in the development of the Laguna de Bay Region, unlike other lakes in the country, its water quality and general condition are closely monitored. This important water resource has been greatly affected by development pressures like population growth, rapid industrialization, and resources allocation.

=== Invasive species ===
At least 18 fish species are known from Laguna de Bay; none are strictly endemic to the lake, but 3 are endemic to the Philippines: &quot;Gobiopterus lacustris&quot;, &quot;Leiopotherapon plumbeus&quot; and &quot;Zenarchopterus philippinus&quot;. Aquaculture is widespread in Laguna de Bay, but often involves non-native species. Some of these, such as the janitor fish, clown knifefish, Thai catfish, and blackchin tilapia, have escaped and have become invasive species, representing a threat to the native fish.

=== Pollution ===
Government data showed that about 60% of the estimated 8.4 million people residing in the Laguna de Bay Region discharge their solid and liquid wastes indirectly to the lake through its tributaries. A large percentage of these wastes are mainly agricultural while the rest are either domestic or industrial According to DENR (1997), domestic and industrial wastes contribute almost equally at 30% each. Meanwhile, agricultural wastes take up the remaining 40%. In a recent sensitivity waste load model ran by the Laguna Lake Development Authority&#x27;s (LLDA) Integrated Water Resources Management (IWRM) division, it revealed that 70% of biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) loadings came from households, 19% from industries, and 11% came from land run-off or erosion (LLDA, 2005).

As far as industries and factories are concerned, there are about 1,481 and increase is expected. Of the said figure, about 695 have wastewater treatment facilities. Despite this, the lake is absorbing huge amounts of pollution from these industries in the forms of discharges of industrial cooling water, toxic spills from barges and transport operations, and hazardous chemicals like lead, mercury, aluminum and cyanide. Based from the said figure, 65% are classified as &quot;pollutive&quot; industries.

The hastened agricultural modernization throughout the region took its toll on the lake. This paved the way for massive and intensified use of chemical based fertilizers and pesticides whose residues eventually find their way to the lake basin. These chemicals induce rapid algal growth in the area that depleted oxygen levels in the water. Hence, oxygen available to the lake is being used up thereby depleting the available oxygen for the fish, causing massive fish kills. A 2012 study found excessive pesticide use largely attributed to overapplication of pesticides close to the waterways.

As far as domestic wastes are concerned, around 10% of the of waste generated by residents of Metro Manila are dumped into the lake, causing siltation of the lake. As reported by the now defunct Metropolitan Manila Waterworks and Sewerage System (MWSS), only 15% of the residents in the area have an effective waste disposal system. Moreover, around 85% of the families living along the shoreline do not have toilets and/or septic tanks.

In 2018 a survey on Microplastics were conducted by researchers from the Polytechnic University of the Philippines, and have found out that the Laguna de Bay is heavily polluted with microplastics. The study involved three (3) barangays and these are Napindan, San Isidro, and Sampiruhan. Among the barangays, Sampiruhan in Calamba, Laguna has the most microplastics, with a median of 15 ranging from 11 to 24 microplastics per 1000 liters of lake water. The data from the conducted survey is available in Mendeley Data.

=== Overfishing ===
On January 29, 2008, the Mamamayan Para sa Pagpapanatili ng Pagpapaunlad ng Lawa ng Laguna (Mapagpala) accused the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA) of the deterioration of Laguna de Bay due to multiplication of fish pens beyond the allowable limit.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Manggahan floodway ===
=== Laguna Lakeshore Expressway Dike ===
The project was initially conceived as a public-private partnership project, but the project was not successful in receiving bids. The project would later be revised as an untolled highway, known as the Laguna Lakeshore Road Network (LLRN) under a new proposal. The highway project has a total length of about 37.4 kilometers (km) expressway from Lower Bicutan in NCR to Calamba in Laguna Province, consisting of (i) 11.7 km long viaduct from Lower Bicutan to Tunasan; and (ii) 25.7km long combination of shoreline viaduct and embankment from Tunasan to Calamba. The expressway will be an access-controlled road with eight interchanges, with an access road at each interchange to connect to the existing road networks. The Export-Import Bank of Korea-Economic Development Cooperation Fund (KEXIM-EDCF) and the Asian Development Bank (ADB) will jointly finance the project. 

=== Eastbay Submarine Pipeline and Pakil Water Treatment Plant Projects ===

The Manila Water began laying down in 2021 two high density polyethylene (HDPE) underground and 21 km submarine pipes from Binangonan, Cardona, Morong, and Pililla to expand their services under the East Bay Phase 1 Project. These two pipes once completed will deliver 50 million liters per day (MLD) to the said area. The environmental impact of the project was worked on by the University of the Philippines Los Baños.

East Bay Phase 2 Project will involve construction of a water treatment plant (WTP) at Bgy. Kabulusan, Pakil, Laguna beginning 2023. The WTP once completed will produce 200 MLD for the Metro Manila East Zone through the submarine pipeline under the lake.

== Governance ==

The main agency tasked to oversee the programs that aimed to develop and protect Laguna de Bay is the Laguna Lake Development Authority (LLDA), signed into law under Republic Act (RA) 4850 in 1966 during the Marcos administration. Originally only created as a quasi-government agency with regulatory and proprietary functions, its charter was strengthened by Presidential Decree (PD) 817 in 1975 and by Executive Order (EO) 927 in 1983 to include environmental protection and jurisdiction over the surface waters of the lake basin. In 1993, by virtue of the devolution, the administrative supervision of the LLDA was transferred to the DENR by EO 149.

===Clean Water Act===
The technical aspect regarding the quality of wastewater is given in DENR Administrative Order 1990–35. The order defines the critical water parameters&#x27; value versus the classification of the body of water (e.g., lake or river). Discharge permits are issued by the LLDA only if the wastewater being discharged complied with the said order.

According to the Clean Water Act of 2004, the DENR (through the LLDA) shall implement a wastewater charge system in all management areas including the Laguna Lake region and Regional Industrial Centers through the collection of wastewater charges/fees. The system shall be established on the basis of payment to the government for discharging wastewater into the water bodies. Wastewater charges shall be established taking into consideration the following: a) to provide strong economic inducement for polluters to modify their production or management processes or to invest in pollution control technology in order to reduce the amount of water pollutants generated; b) to cover the cost of administering water quality management or improvement programs, including the cost of administering the discharge permitting and water pollution charge system; c) reflect damages caused by water pollution on the surrounding environment, including the cost of rehabilitation; d) type of pollutant; e) classification of the receiving water body; and f) other special attributes of the water body.

===Integrated Coastal Ecosystem Conservation and Adaptive Management ===
CECAM is a 5-year research cooperation between Japanese and Filipino scientists. Seven monitoring instruments are being used as part of the Continuous and Comprehensive Monitoring System (CCMS) provided by the Japanese government.

== Cultural impact ==
Laguna de Bay has had a significant impact on the cultures of the communities that grew up around its shores, ranging from folk medicine to architecture. For example, the traditional cure for a child constantly experiencing nose bleed in Victoria, Laguna is to have the child submerge his or her head in the lake water at daybreak. When nipa huts were more common, huts made in the lake area were constructed out of bamboo that would first be cured in the waters of Laguna de Bay. Some experts on the evolution of local mythologies suggest that the legend of Mariang Makiling may have started out as that of the Lady (Ba&#x27;i) of Laguna de Bay, before the legend was transmuted to Mount Makiling.

<text>In information theory, the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) is a general property of the output samples of a stochastic source. It is fundamental to the concept of typical set used in theories of data compression.

Roughly speaking, the theorem states that although there are many series of results that may be produced by a random process, the one actually produced is most probably from a loosely defined set of outcomes that all have approximately the same chance of being the one actually realized. (This is a consequence of the law of large numbers and ergodic theory.) Although there are individual outcomes which have a higher probability than any outcome in this set, the vast number of outcomes in the set almost guarantees that the outcome will come from the set. One way of intuitively understanding the property is through Cramér&#x27;s large deviation theorem, which states that the probability of a large deviation from mean decays exponentially with the number of samples. Such results are studied in large deviations theory; intuitively, it is the large deviations that would violate equipartition, but these are unlikely.

In the field of pseudorandom number generation, a candidate generator of undetermined quality whose output sequence lies too far outside the typical set by some statistical criteria is rejected as insufficiently random. Thus, although the typical set is loosely defined, practical notions arise concerning &quot;sufficient&quot; typicality.

== Definition ==
Given a discrete-time stationary ergodic stochastic process formula_1 on the probability space formula_2, the asymptotic equipartition property is an assertion that, almost surely,
formula_3
where formula_4 or simply formula_5 denotes the entropy rate of formula_1, which must exist for all discrete-time stationary processes including the ergodic ones. The asymptotic equipartition property is proved for finite-valued (i.e. formula_7) stationary ergodic stochastic processes in the Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem using the ergodic theory and for any i.i.d. sources directly using the law of large numbers in both the discrete-valued case (where formula_5 is simply the entropy of a symbol) and the continuous-valued case (where formula_5 is the differential entropy instead). The definition of the asymptotic equipartition property can also be extended for certain classes of continuous-time stochastic processes for which a typical set exists for long enough observation time. The convergence is proven almost sure in all cases.

== Discrete-time i.i.d. sources ==
Given formula_1 is an i.i.d. source which may take values in the alphabet formula_11, its time series formula_12 is i.i.d. with entropy formula_4. The weak law of large numbers gives the asymptotic equipartition property with convergence in probability,
formula_14
since the entropy is equal to the expectation of 
formula_15

The strong law of large numbers asserts the stronger almost sure convergence,
formula_16Convergence in the sense of L1 asserts an even strongerformula_17

== Discrete-time finite-valued stationary ergodic sources ==
Consider a finite-valued sample space formula_18, i.e. formula_7, for the discrete-time stationary ergodic process formula_20 defined on the probability space formula_2. The Shannon–McMillan–Breiman theorem, due to Claude Shannon, Brockway McMillan, and Leo Breiman, states that we have convergence in the sense of L1. Chung Kai-lai generalized this to the case where formula_1 may take value in a set of countable infinity, provided that the entropy rate is still finite.


== Non-stationary discrete-time source producing independent symbols ==
The assumptions of stationarity/ergodicity/identical distribution of random variables is not essential for the asymptotic equipartition property to hold. Indeed, as is quite clear intuitively, the asymptotic equipartition property requires only some form of the law of large numbers to hold, which is fairly general. However, the expression needs to be suitably generalized, and the conditions need to be formulated precisely.

We assume that the source is producing independent symbols, with possibly different output statistics at each instant. We assume that the statistics of the process are known completely, that is, the marginal distribution of the process seen at each time instant is known. The joint distribution is just the product of marginals. Then, under the condition (which can be relaxed) that formula_23 for all &quot;i&quot;, for some &quot;M&quot; &gt; 0, the following holds (AEP):
formula_24
where 
formula_25

=== Applications ===
The asymptotic equipartition property for non-stationary discrete-time independent process leads us to (among other results) the source coding theorem for non-stationary source (with independent output symbols) and noisy-channel coding theorem for non-stationary memoryless channels.

== Measure-theoretic form ==
formula_26 is a measure-preserving map on the probability space formula_27.

If formula_28 is a finite or countable partition of formula_27, then its entropy is formula_30 with the convention that formula_31.

We only consider partitions with finite entropy: formula_32.

If formula_28 is a finite or countable partition of formula_27, then we construct a sequence of partitions by iterating the map:formula_35where formula_36 is the least upper bound partition, that is, the least refined partition that refines both formula_28 and formula_38:formula_39Write formula_40 to be the set in formula_28 where formula_42 falls in. So, for example, formula_43 is the formula_44 -letter initial segment of the formula_45 -name of formula_42.

Write formula_47 to be the information (in units of &quot;nats&quot;) about formula_42 we can recover, if we know which element in the partition formula_28 that formula_42 falls in:formula_51Similarly, the conditional information of partition formula_28, conditional on partition formula_38, about formula_42, isformula_55formula_56 is the Kolmogorov-Sinai entropyformula_57In other words, by definition, we have a convergence in expectation. The SMB theorem states that when formula_26 is ergodic, we have convergence in L1.

(x)
 &lt;/math&gt; converges in L1 to the constant function formula_59.

In other words, formula_60 

In particular, since L1 convergence implies almost sure convergence, formula_61 with probability 1.

If formula_26 is not necessarily ergodic, then the underlying probability space would be split up into multiple subsets, each invariant under formula_26. In this case, we still have L1 convergence to some function, but that function is no longer a constant function.

(x)
 &lt;/math&gt; converges in L1 to
formula_64

When formula_26 is ergodic, formula_66 is trivial, and so the functionformula_67simplifies into the constant function formula_68, which by definition, equals formula_69, which equals formula_56 by a proposition.

== Continuous-time stationary ergodic sources ==
Discrete-time functions can be interpolated to continuous-time functions. If such interpolation &quot;f&quot; is measurable, we may define the continuous-time stationary process accordingly as formula_71. If the asymptotic equipartition property holds for the discrete-time process, as in the i.i.d. or finite-valued stationary ergodic cases shown above, it automatically holds for the continuous-time stationary process derived from it by some measurable interpolation. i.e.
formula_72
where &quot;n&quot; corresponds to the degree of freedom in time . and are the entropy per unit time and per degree of freedom respectively, defined by Shannon.

An important class of such continuous-time stationary process is the bandlimited stationary ergodic process with the sample space being a subset of the continuous formula_73 functions. The asymptotic equipartition property holds if the process is white, in which case the time samples are i.i.d., or there exists &quot;T&quot; &gt; 1/2&quot;W&quot;, where &quot;W&quot; is the nominal bandwidth, such that the &quot;T&quot;-spaced time samples take values in a finite set, in which case we have the discrete-time finite-valued stationary ergodic process.

Any time-invariant operations also preserves the asymptotic equipartition property, stationarity and ergodicity and we may easily turn a stationary process to non-stationary without losing the asymptotic equipartition property by nulling out a finite number of time samples in the process.

==Category theory==
A category theoretic definition for the equipartition property is given by Gromov. Given a sequence of Cartesian powers formula_74 of a measure space &quot;P&quot;, this sequence admits an &quot;asymptotically equivalent&quot; sequence &quot;HN&quot; of homogeneous measure spaces (&quot;i.e.&quot; all sets have the same measure; all morphisms are invariant under the group of automorphisms, and thus factor as a morphism to the terminal object).

The above requires a definition of &quot;asymptotic equivalence&quot;. This is given in terms of a distance function, giving how much an injective correspondence differs from an isomorphism. An injective correspondence formula_75 is a partially defined map that is a bijection; that is, it is a bijection between a subset formula_76 and formula_77. Then define
formula_78
where |&quot;S&quot;| denotes the measure of a set &quot;S&quot;. In what follows, the measure of &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are taken to be 1, so that the measure spaces are probability spaces. This distance formula_79 is commonly known as the earth mover&#x27;s distance or Wasserstein metric.

Similarly, define
formula_80
with formula_81 taken to be the counting measure on &quot;P&quot;. Thus, this definition requires that &quot;P&quot; be a finite measure space. Finally, let
formula_82

A sequence of injective correspondences formula_83 are then asymptotically equivalent when
formula_84

Given a homogenous space sequence &quot;HN&quot; that is asymptotically equivalent to &quot;PN&quot;, the entropy &quot;H&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) of &quot;P&quot; may be taken as
formula_85

<text>John Florence Sullivan (May 31, 1894 – March 17, 1956), known professionally as Fred Allen, was an American comedian. His absurdist topically-pointed radio program &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; (1932–1949) made him one of the most popular and forward-looking humorists in the Golden Age of American radio.

His best-remembered gag was his long-running mock feud with friend and fellow comedian Jack Benny, but that was only part of his appeal. Radio historian John Dunning wrote that Allen was perhaps radio&#x27;s most admired comedian and most frequently censored. A master ad libber, Allen often tangled with his network&#x27;s executives and often barbed them on the air over the battles while developing routines whose style and substance influenced fellow comic talents, including Groucho Marx, Stan Freberg, Henry Morgan, and Johnny Carson; his avowed fans also included President Franklin D. Roosevelt, humorist James Thurber, and novelists William Faulkner, John Steinbeck, and Herman Wouk, who began his career writing for Allen.

Allen was honored with stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for contributions to television and radio.

==Early life==
John Florence Sullivan was born in Cambridge, Massachusetts, to Irish Catholic parents. Allen barely knew his mother, Cecilia ( Herlihy) Sullivan, who died of pneumonia when he was not quite three years old. Along with his father, James Henry Sullivan, and his infant brother Robert, Allen was taken in by one of his mother&#x27;s sisters, &quot;my aunt Lizzie&quot;, around whom he focused the first chapter of his second memoir, &quot;Much Ado About Me&quot;. His father was so shattered by his mother&#x27;s death that according to Allen, he drank more heavily. His aunt suffered as well; her husband, Michael, was partially paralyzed by lead poisoning shortly after they married, which left him mostly unable to work; Allen remembered that as causing contention among Lizzie&#x27;s sisters. Eventually, Allen&#x27;s father remarried and offered his sons the choice between coming with him and his new wife or staying with Aunt Lizzie. Allen&#x27;s younger brother chose to go with their father, but Allen decided to stay with his aunt. &quot;I never regretted it,&quot; he wrote.

===Religion===
Allen was a Catholic and regularly attended Mass at St. Malachy&#x27;s Church in Manhattan.

==Vaudeville==

Allen took piano lessons as a boy, his father having brought an Emerson upright along when they moved in with his aunt. He learned exactly two songs, &quot;Hiawatha&quot; and &quot;Pitter, Patter, Little Raindrops,&quot; and would be asked to play &quot;half or all my repertoire&quot; when visitors came to the house. He also worked at the Boston Public Library, where he discovered a book about the origin and the development of comedy. Enduring various upheavals at home (other aunts came and went, which prompted several moves), Allen also took up juggling while he learned as much as possible about comedy.

Some library co-workers planned to put on a show and asked him to do a bit of juggling and some of his comedy. When a girl in the crowd told him, &quot;You&#x27;re crazy to keep working here at the library; you ought to go on stage,&quot; Allen decided that his career path was set.

In 1914, at the age of 20, Allen took a job with a local piano company, in addition to his library work. He appeared at a number of amateur night competitions, soon took the stage name Fred St. James, and booked with the local vaudeville circuit at $30 a week (equal to $ today), enough at the time to allow him to quit his jobs with the library and the piano company. Eventually, he became &quot;Freddy James&quot; and often billed himself as the world&#x27;s worst juggler. Allen refined the mix of his deliberately-clumsy juggling and the standard jokes and one-liners. He directed much of the humor at his own poor juggling abilities. During his time in vaudeville, his act evolved more toward monologic comedy and less juggling. In 1917, returning to the New York circuit, his stage name was changed to Fred Allen so that he would not be offered the same low salary that theater owners had been accustomed to paying him in his early career. His new surname came from Edgar Allen, a booker for the Fox theaters.

In 1922, Allen commissioned comic-strip artist Martin Branner to cover a theater curtain with an elaborate mural painting depicting a cemetery with a punchline on each gravestone. It was the &quot;Old Joke Cemetery,&quot; where overworked gags go to die. In Allen&#x27;s act, the audiences would see the curtain (and have several minutes to read its 46 punchlines) before Allen made his entrance. Audiences typically would be laughing at the curtain before Allen even appeared. Robert Taylor&#x27;s biography of Allen includes an impressive full-length photo of Branner&#x27;s curtain painting, and many of the punchlines are clearly legible in the photo.

Allen used a variety of gimmicks in his changing act from a ventriloquist dummy to juggling to singing, but the focus was always on his comedy, which was heavy on wordplay. One recurring bit was to read a purported &quot;letter from home&quot; with material such as the following:
:&quot;The man next door has bought pigs; we got wind of it this morning. Your father had a terrible fight with him about it, and the man hit your father with a rock in the left ear. It didn&#x27;t bother your father; he is stone deaf in that ear. The policeman who took him away said that he would get his hearing in the morning. The other man, the one who owns the pigs, was arrested for fragrancy... There is no other news except that our oil stove exploded yesterday and blew your father and me out into the backyard. It is the first time we have been out together for twenty years.

Allen&#x27;s wit was at times intended not for the vaudeville audience but rather for other professionals in show business. After one of his appearances failed one day, Allen made the best of it by circulating an obituary of his act on black-bordered funeral stationery. He also mailed vials of his supposed &quot;flop sweat&quot; to newspapers as part of his comic self-promotion.

In 1921, Fred Allen and Nora Bayes toured with the company of Lew Fields. Their musical director was nineteen-year-old Richard Rodgers. Many years later, when he and Oscar Hammerstein II appeared as mystery guests on &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, Rodgers recalled Allen&#x27;s act of sitting on the edge of the stage with his legs dangling down, playing a banjo, and telling jokes.

==Broadway==

Allen temporarily left vaudeville, moving to work in such Shubert Brothers stage productions as &quot;The Passing Show&quot; in 1922. The show played well in its runup to Broadway but lasted only ten weeks at the Winter Garden Theatre. Portland Hoffa, who was in the chorus of the show, was eventually to marry Allen.

He received good notices for his comic work in several of the productions, particularly &quot;Vogues&quot; and &quot;Greenwich Village Follies&quot;, and continued to develop his comic writing. He even wrote a column for &quot;Variety&quot; called &quot;Near Fun.&quot; A salary dispute ended the column; Allen wanted only $60 a week (equal 
to $ today) to give up his theater work to become a full-time columnist, but his editor tried a sleight of hand, based on the paper&#x27;s ad rates, to deny him. He spent his summer in Boston, honed his comic and writing skills even further, worked in a &quot;respectfully&quot; received duo that billed themselves as Fink and Smith, and played a few of the dying vaudeville houses.

Allen returned to New York to the pleasant surprise that Portland Hoffa was taking instruction to convert to Roman Catholicism. After the couple married, Allen began writing material for them to use together (&quot;With a vaudeville act, Portland and I could be together, even if we couldn&#x27;t find any work&quot;), and the couple divided their time between the show business circuit, Allen&#x27;s New England family home and Old Orchard Beach, Maine, in the summers.

==Radio==

Allen&#x27;s first taste of radio came while he and Portland Hoffa waited for a promised slot in a new Arthur Hammerstein musical. In the interim, they appeared on a Chicago station&#x27;s program, &quot;WLS Showboat&quot;, into which Allen recalled, &quot;Portland and I were presented... to inject a little class into it.&quot; Their success in these appearances helped their theater reception. Live audiences in the Midwest liked to see their radio favorites in person even if Allen and Hoffa would be replaced by Bob Hope when the radio show moved to New York several months afterward. 

The couple eventually got their Hammerstein show, &quot;Polly&quot;, which opened in Delaware and made the usual tour before hitting Broadway. Also in that cast was a young Englishman named Archie Leach, who received as many good notices for his romantic appeal as Allen got for his comic work. Hammerstein retooled the show before he brought it to New York by replacing everyone but two women and Allen. Leach decided to buy an old car and drive to Hollywood. &quot;What Archie Leach didn&#x27;t tell me,&quot; Allen remembered, &quot;was that he was going to change his name to Cary Grant.&quot;

&quot;Polly&quot; never succeeded in spite of several retoolings, but Allen went on to successful shows like &quot;The Little Show&quot; (1929–30) and &quot;Three&#x27;s a Crowd&quot; (1930–31), which eventually led to his full-time entry to radio in 1932.

===&quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot;===
Allen first hosted The Linit Bath Club Revue on CBS and moved the show to NBC to become &quot;The Salad Bowl Revue&quot; (in a nod to new sponsor Hellmann&#x27;s Mayonnaise, which was marketed by the parent company of Linit) later in the year. The show became &quot;The Sal Hepatica Revue&quot; (1933–34), &quot;The Hour of Smiles&quot; (1934–35), and finally &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; (1935–39). In 1939–40, however, sponsor Bristol-Myers, which advertised Ipana toothpaste as well as Sal Hepatica during the program, altered the title to &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; over his objections. Allen&#x27;s perfectionism (odd to some because of his deft ad libs) caused him to leap from sponsor to sponsor until &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; allowed him to set his chosen small-town milieu and establish himself as a bona fide radio star.

The hour-long show featured segments that would influence radio and, much later, television. News satires such as &quot;Rowan and Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Laugh-In Looks at the News&quot; and &quot;Saturday Night Live&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Weekend Update&quot; were influenced by &quot;Town Hall Tonight&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The News Reel&quot;, later renamed &quot;Town Hall News&quot; (and in 1939–40, as a sop to his sponsor, &quot;Ipana News&quot;). &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&#x27;s&quot; &quot;Mighty Carson Art Players&quot; routines referred to the Mighty Allen Art Players in name and sometimes in routines. 

Allen and company also satirized popular musical comedies and films of the day, including and especially &quot;Oklahoma!&quot;. Allen also did semi-satirical interpretations of well-known lives, including his own.

The show that became &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; was the longest-running hour-long comedy-based show in classic radio history. In 1940, Allen moved back to CBS Radio with a new sponsor and show name, &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot;, airing every Wednesday at 9:00 pm ET on CBS, then Sundays at 9:00 pm in the fall of 1941. By 1942, he shortened the show to half an hour, at 9:30 pm ET, under the edicts of the network and sponsor. He also chafed under being forced to give up a &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; signature of using barely-known and amateur guests effectively in favor of booking more recognizable guests although he liked many of them. Guests included singers from Kingston, New York, the original woman behind the &quot;Aunt Jemima&quot; on pancake boxes, and singer Donald Gardner from Saugerties, New York. 

Allen held himself personally responsible for the show&#x27;s success and devoted much of his time to writing and rewriting routines and scripts. The overwork took a heavy toll on his health. His condition was diagnosed as hypertension, and he was forced to take more than a year off.

==Film==
Concurrent with his radio duties, Allen made occasional motion pictures by appearing in seven full-length features and three shorts between 1929 and 1952. His first film, filmed by Paramount Pictures at its New York studio, was &quot;The Installment Collector&quot; (1929), a nine-minute adaptation of one of his vaudeville acts in which he remits a succession of personal articles to an insistent debt collector. Allen followed it with two shorts for Vitaphone, also filmed in New York. Allen&#x27;s first feature film was the 1935 Dick Powell musical comedy &quot;Thanks a Million&quot;, which &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewed by naming only Allen in its headline. In 1940, &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; played off the comic feud with Jack Benny. Allen&#x27;s sole leading role was as flea circus impresario Fred F. Trumble Floogle in the frenetic &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag!&quot;, a loose adaptation of Ilf and Petrov&#x27;s novel &quot;The Twelve Chairs&quot;.

==Return to radio==

In 1945 &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; returned to NBC, Sunday nights at 8:30 p.m. EST. Standard Brands&#x27; Blue Bonnet Margarine and Tender Leaf Tea, and later, Ford Motor Company, were the sponsors for the rest of the show&#x27;s run. (Texaco revived &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; in 1948 on radio, and more successfully on television, making an American icon out of star Milton Berle).

Allen again made a few changes, including the singing DeMarco Sisters to whom he had been tipped by arranger-composer Gordon Jenkins. &quot;We did four years with Mr. Allen and got one thousand dollars a week,&quot; Gloria DeMarco remembered. &quot;Sunday night was the best night on radio.&quot; Sunday night with Fred Allen seemed incomplete on any night that listeners did not hear the DeMarco Sisters, whose breezy, harmonious style became as familiar as their cheerfully sung &quot;Mr. Al-len, Mr. Alll-llennnn&quot; in the show&#x27;s opening theme. During the theme&#x27;s brief pause, Allen would say something like, &quot;It isn&#x27;t the mayor of Anaheim, Azusa, and Cucamonga, kiddies.&quot; That device became a signature for three of the four years.
===Allen&#x27;s Alley===
The other change, born in the Texaco days and evolving from his earlier news spoofs, proved his most enduring, premiering December 6, 1942. The inspiration for the mythical Main Street of &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; came from the small-town heartland folks who were often profiled in the newspaper columns written by O. O. McIntyre (1884–1938), one of the most popular columnists of the 1930s, with some seven million readers.

&quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; followed a brief Allen monologue and comic segment with Portland Hoffa (&quot;Misssss-ter Allll-llennnn!&quot;), usually involving gags that she instigated about her family. Then, a brief music interlude would symbolize the two making their way to the fictitious Alley.

The segment was always launched by a quick exchange that began with Hoffa asking Allen what he would ask the Alley denizens that week. After she implored him, &quot;Shall we go?&quot; Allen would reply with cracks like, &quot;As the two drumsticks said when they spotted the tympani, let&#x27;s beat it!&#x27;&quot; or &quot;As one strapless gown said to the other strapless gown, &#x27;What&#x27;s holding us up?&#x27;&quot;

A small host of stereotypical characters greeted Allen and Hoffa down the Alley, discussing Allen&#x27;s question of the week, usually drawing on news items or popular happenings around town, whether gas rationing, traffic congestion, the Pulitzer Prizes, postwar holiday travel, or the annual Ringling Brothers and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus visit.

The Alley went through a few changes in the first installments. Early denizens included sarcastic John Doe (John Brown), self-possessed Senator Bloat and town drunk Sampson Souse (Jack Smart), dimwitted Socrates Mulligan (Charlie Cantor), pompous poet Falstaff Openshaw (Alan Reed), and wry Jewish housewife Pansy Nussbaum (Minerva Pious). By 1945, Pious and Reed were joined by two new Alley denizens: Parker Fennelly as stoic New England farmer Titus Moody, and Kenny Delmar, the new show&#x27;s announcer, as bellowing Southern senator Beauregard Claghorn. Pious is credited with bringing Delmar to Allen&#x27;s attention. Delmar based the blowhard character on a real-life person he had encountered while hitchhiking in 1928; Delmar had originally named the voice characterization &quot;Dynamite Gus.&quot; Within weeks, Claghorn became one of the leading comedy characters of radio as listeners across the country began quoting his catchphrases: &quot;Somebody, Ah say, somebody knocked&quot;; &quot;I&#x27;m from the South, Suh&quot;; &quot;That&#x27;s a &quot;joke,&quot; son&quot;; and &quot;Pay &quot;attention,&quot; boy!&quot; Claghorn served as the model for the Warner Bros. cartoon character Foghorn Leghorn, who first appeared the following August in the Oscar-nominated &quot;Walky Talky Hawky&quot;.

Other characters had catchphrases that were almost as famous as Claghorn&#x27;s, such as Titus Moody&#x27;s &quot;Howdy, Bub&quot;, and Falstaff Openshaw&#x27;s &quot;That is precisely why I am here.&quot; Mrs. Nussbaum always greeted Allen by saying, &quot;You were expecting maybe...&quot;, and then she would mispronounce the name of a glamorous film star, such as &quot;Too-ra-loo-ra-loo-ra Bankhead?&quot; The Alley sketches made only one further cast change, when Peter Donald&#x27;s chipper Irishman Ajax Cassidy succeeded Reed&#x27;s Falstaff.

Despite the ethnic diversity, the Alley characters seemed less citified and more akin with O. O. McIntyre&#x27;s small-town America. Allen&#x27;s topical humor is sometimes thought an acquired taste for audiences curious about his generation of radio stars; Dunning has written that when he &quot;went into topical humor, he may have forfeited his only opportunity to be the Mark Twain of his century. He had flashes of undeniable brilliance. But the main body of his work deals with the day-to-day fodder of another time, and sons have seldom been amused by the embarrassments or tragedies of their fathers.&quot;

However, others find many parallels to today&#x27;s world and its absurdities. The &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; stereotypes make some cringe, as Allen biographer Robert Taylor noted (in &quot;Fred Allen: His Life and Wit&quot;), but others find them lancing more than lauding stereotypes, letting listeners make up their own minds about how foolish they could be. &quot;Interestingly enough,&quot; wrote Frank Buxton and Bill Owen in &quot;The Big Broadcast 1920-1950&quot;, &quot;[Claghorn, Nussbaum, Moody, and Cassidy] were never criticized as being anti-Southern, anti-Semitic, anti-New England, or anti-Irish. The warmth and good humor with which they were presented made them acceptable even to the most sensitive listeners.&quot;

Allen employed a writing staff, but it served as his sounding boards and early draft consultants as much as actual writers. It was Allen who had the final edit, rewrote of each week&#x27;s script, and worked as long as 12 hours a day on ideas or sketches. His ad-libbing ability caused many a show to fade away behind the ending network identification because Allen often ate up air time. It was not as unusual for him as for others to sign off with &quot;We&#x27;re a little late, so good night, folks.&quot; Allen&#x27;s habit of signing off late affected fellow former vaudevillian Phil Baker, whose quiz show &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot; immediately followed the Allen show. Baker hatched a comic plan to remedy the situation. He kept track of how much time he was losing to Allen over a period of a few months, and when the total reached 15 minutes, Baker barged into the studio 15 minutes earlier than schedule, while Allen was on the air, and took over the show by welcoming the audience to &quot;Take It or Leave It&quot;. Allen, aghast but amused, surrendered the microphone to Baker. Allen&#x27;s parting shot was, &quot;I&#x27;ll write a letter to Senator Claghorn about this!&quot;

Allen also &quot;died&quot; more eloquently than other radio comics, particularly in the later years. When a joke was greeted with an awkward silence, Allen would comment on the lack of response with his ad-libbed &quot;explanation&quot; almost always funnier than the original joke, a technique that was later adopted successfully by Johnny Carson. 

===Closing the Alley===

&quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot; was radio&#x27;s top-rated show of the 1946–47 season. Allen was able to negotiate a lucrative new contract as a result not only of the show&#x27;s success but also in large measure to NBC&#x27;s anxiety to keep more of its stars from joining Jack Benny in a wholesale defection to CBS as well as to retain its services for its rapidly-expanding television programming. The CBS talent raids broke up NBC&#x27;s hit Sunday night, and Benny also convinced George Burns and Gracie Allen and Bing Crosby to join his move.

However, a year later, Fred Allen was knocked off his perch not by a talent raid but by a show on a third rival network, ABC (the former NBC Blue network). The quiz show &quot;Stop the Music&quot;, hosted by Bert Parks (debuted 1948), required listeners to participate live by telephone. The show became a big enough hit to break into Allen&#x27;s grip on that Sunday night-time slot. At first, Allen fought fire with his own kind of fire: he offered $5,000 to listeners getting a call from &quot;Stop the Music&quot; or any similar game show while they listened to &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;. He never had to pay up, and he was not shy about lampooning the game-show phenomenon (especially a riotous parody of another quiz show that Parks hosted by launching &quot;Break the Bank&quot; in a routine called &quot;Break the Contestant&quot; in which players did not receive a thing but were compelled to give up possessions when they blew a question).

Unfortunately, Allen fell to number 38 in the radio ratings, which was compounded by the rise of television in many major cities. By then, he had changed the show again somewhat with the famed &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; skits now taking place on &quot;Main Street&quot; and rotating a new character or two in and out of the lineup. He stepped down from radio again in 1949, at the end of his show&#x27;s regular season, as much under his doctor&#x27;s orders (for Allen&#x27;s continued hypertension) as because of his slipping ratings. He decided to take a year off, but it did more for his health than his career. After the June 26, 1949 show on which Henry Morgan and Jack Benny guested, Allen never hosted another radio show full-time again.

===&quot;Feud&quot; with Jack Benny===

Good friends in real life, Fred Allen and Jack Benny inadvertently hatched a running gag in 1937 when a child prodigy, the violinist Stuart Canin, gave a very credible performance on the Allen show and inspired an Allen wisecrack about &quot;a certain alleged violinist&quot; who should hide in shame over his poor playing. Allen often mentioned his show-business friends on the air (&quot;Mr. Jacob Haley of Newton Highlands, Massachusetts&quot; was Allen&#x27;s way of saying hello to his pal Jack Haley), and on the Canin broadcast Allen knew Benny would be listening. Benny, according to Allen biographer Taylor, burst out laughing, then responded in kind on his own program. The rivalry gag went on for a decade and convinced some fans that the two comedians really were blood enemies.

The Allen-Benny feud was the longest-playing, best-remembered dialogic running gag in classic radio history. The gag even pushed toward a boxing match between the two comedians and the promised event was a sellout, but the match never occurred. The pair even appeared together in films, including &quot;Love Thy Neighbor&quot; (1940) and &quot;It&#x27;s in the Bag!&quot; (1945), Allen&#x27;s only starring vehicle, also featuring William Bendix, Robert Benchley, and Jerry Colonna. He also starred with Oscar Levant in 20th Century-Fox&#x27;s anthology film &quot;O. Henry&#x27;s Full House&quot;, in &quot;The Ransom of Red Chief&quot;.

Some of the feud&#x27;s highlights involved Al Boasberg, who is credited with helping Benny refine his character into what may have been America&#x27;s first stand-up comedian. Boasberg was well known behind the scenes as a top comedy writer and script doctor, but he seldom received recognition in public. He worked, uncredited, on many films (including the Marx Brothers&#x27; hits &quot;A Night at the Opera&quot; and &quot;A Day at the Races&quot;). Steaming mad because of his long battles for recognition, Boasberg was said to have delivered a tirade that ended up (in slightly altered form) in an Allen-Benny feud routine:

ALLEN: Why, you fugitive from a Ripley cartoon ... I&#x27;ll knock you flatter than the first eight minutes of this program.

BENNY: You ought to do well in pictures, Mr. Allen, now that Boris Karloff is back in England.

ALLEN: Why, if I was a horse, a pony even, and found out that any part of my tail was used in your violin bow, I&#x27;d hang my head in my oatbag from then on.

Benny&#x27;s side of the feud included a tart interpretation of Allen&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot; show, which Benny and company called &quot;Clown Hall Tonight.&quot; A signature element of the feud was that, whenever one guested on the other&#x27;s shows, the host would tend to hand the guest the best lines of the night. (Both Benny and Allen revealed later that each man&#x27;s writers consulted with each other on routines involving the feud.)

They toned the gag down after 1941, though they kept it going often enough as the years continued, climaxing on Allen&#x27;s May 26, 1946 show, in which a sketch called &quot;King for a Day,&quot; satirizing big-money game shows, featured Benny pretending to be a contestant named Myron Proudfoot on Allen&#x27;s new quiz show.

ALLEN: Tomorrow night, in your ermine robe, you will be whisked by bicycle to Orange, New Jersey, where you will be the judge in a chicken-cleaning contest.

BENNY (rapturously): I&#x27;m &quot;King&quot; for a Day!

[Allen proceeds to have Benny&#x27;s clothes pressed:]

ALLEN: And that&#x27;s not all!

BENNY: There&#x27;s more?

ALLEN: Yes! Upon our stage we have a Hoffman pressing machine.

BENNY: Now wait a minute! Wait a minute!

ALLEN: An expert operating the Hoffman pressing machine will press your trousers in seconds.

BENNY: Now &quot;wait&quot; a minute! (total audience hysteria and laughter, as Benny&#x27;s pants are literally removed)

ALLEN: Quiet, King!

BENNY: Come on, Allen, gimme my pants!

ALLEN: Keep your shirt on, King.

BENNY: You &quot;bet&quot; I&#x27;ll keep my shirt on!

ALLEN: We&#x27;re a little late, folks! Tune in next week –

BENNY: Allen, this is a frame... (starts laughing himself) Where are my pants?

ALLEN: Benny, for 15 years I&#x27;ve been waiting to catch you like this!

BENNY: Allen, you haven&#x27;t seen the &quot;end&quot; of me!

ALLEN: &quot;It won&#x27;t be long now!&quot;

BENNY: I want my pants!

Allen and Benny could not resist one more play on the feud on Allen&#x27;s final show. Benny appeared as a skinflint bank manager and mortgage company owner bedeviling Henry Morgan. Typically, Allen handed Benny the show&#x27;s best crack: &quot;&quot;Nobody&quot; ever made me &quot;this&quot; cheap on my &quot;own&quot; program!&quot;

Benny even used the feud on his TV show, when Fred Allen appeared as a special guest in 1953. The program depicted Benny and Allen as rivals for the sponsor&#x27;s favors. When the sponsor pointed out that Benny was also a musician, Allen countered with a passage on his clarinet.

As Benny said in his co-memoir, &quot;Sunday Nights at Seven: The Jack Benny Story&quot;, &quot;[T]he sky was the limit. Or rather, the mud was the limit.&quot;

Benny was profoundly shaken by Allen&#x27;s sudden death from a heart attack in 1956. In a statement released the day after Allen&#x27;s death, Benny said, &quot;People have often asked me if Fred Allen and I were really friends in real life. My answer is always the same. You couldn&#x27;t have such a long-running and successful feud as we did, without having a deep and sincere friendship at the heart of it.&quot;

===Censorship===
Allen may have battled censors more than most of his radio contemporaries. &quot;Fred Allen&#x27;s fourteen-year battle with radio censorship,&quot; wrote the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune&quot; critic John Crosby, &quot;was made particularly difficult for him by the fact that the man assigned to reviewing his scripts had little sense of humor and frankly admitted he didn&#x27;t understand Allen&#x27;s peculiar brand of humor at all.&quot; Among the blue pencils, according to Crosby, were:

* At the time of socialite Brenda Frazier&#x27;s wedding, Allen was barred from saying &quot;Brenda never looked lovelier&quot; unless he could get direct permission from the Frazier family.
* Allen was ordered to change the Cockney accent that he assigned the character of a first mate aboard the &quot;Queen Mary&quot; on the grounds that the ship&#x27;s first mate had to be a cultured man, who might not like a Cockney accent.
* Allen had to fight to keep Mrs. Nussbaum in the Allen&#x27;s Alley routines because NBC feared Jewish-dialect humor &quot;might offend all Jews&quot; although Jewish dialect humor had been a vaudeville and burlesque staple for years.
* Allen was ordered never to mention the fictitious town of North Wrinkle unless it could be proven that no such town existed.

&quot;Allen not only couldn&#x27;t poke fun at individuals,&quot; Crosby wrote. &quot;He also had to be careful not to step on their professions, their beliefs, and sometimes even their hobbies and amusements. Portland Hoffa was once given a line about wasting an afternoon at the rodeo. NBC objected to the implication that an afternoon at the rodeo was wasted and the line had to be changed. Another time, Allen gagged that a girl could have found a better husband in a cemetery. The censor thought this might hurt the feelings of people who own and operate cemeteries. Allen got the line cleared only after pointing out that cemeteries have been topics for comedy since the time of Aristophanes.&quot; Allen&#x27;s constant and sometimes intense, as well as often ridiculous, battles with censors may have aggravated his longtime problems with hypertension.

===Life after the Alley===

After his own show had ended, Allen became a regular attraction on NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Big Show&quot; (1950–1952), hosted by Tallulah Bankhead. He appeared on 24 of the show&#x27;s 57 installments, including the landmark premiere, and showed he had not lost his trademark ad-lib skill or his rapier wit. 
The show&#x27;s head writer, Goodman Ace, later told radio host Richard Lamparski that Allen&#x27;s lucrative NBC contract was a large factor in getting him on the show, but Allen also wrote the segments on which he appeared and consulted with the respected Ace and staff on other portions of the show.

In some ways, &quot;The Big Show&quot; was an offspring of the old Allen show; his one-time &quot;Texaco Star Theater&quot; announcer, Jimmy Wallington, was one of &quot;The Big Show&quot;&#x27;s announcers, and Portland Hoffa made several appearances with him as well. On the show&#x27;s premiere, Allen, with a little prodding from head writer Goodman Ace, could not resist one more play on the old Allen-Benny &quot;feud,&quot; a riotous parody of Benny&#x27;s show called &quot;The Pinch Penny Program.&quot;

==Television==
It was also on &quot;The Big Show&#x27;s&quot; premiere that Allen delivered perhaps his best-remembered crack about television: &quot;Well you know television&#x27;s a new medium. And I have discovered why they call it a medium – because nothing is well done.&quot; That did not stop the Museum of Broadcast Communications from considering Allen &quot;the intellectual conscience of television.&quot; Aside from his famous crack about not liking furniture that talked, Allen observed that television allowed &quot;people who haven&#x27;t anything to do to watch people who can&#x27;t do anything.&quot;

NBC insisted on Allen trying to adapt his radio show for television. He proposed bringing &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot; to television in a visual setting similar to &quot;Our Town&quot;. NBC apparently rejected the idea out of hand. &quot;Television is a triumph of equipment over people,&quot; Allen later observed, &quot;and the minds that control it are so small that you could put them in the navel of a flea and still have enough room beside them for a network vice president&#x27;s heart.&quot;

In 1950, NBC launched the live comedy-variety series &quot;The Colgate Comedy Hour&quot; by using rotating hosts instead of a regular master of ceremonies. Fred Allen was one of the original hosts and appeared five times before he dropped out in April 1951. The next effort, the Goodson-Todman production &quot;Judge for Yourself&quot; (subtitled &quot;The Fred Allen Show&quot;), was a game show incorporating musical acts. The idea was to allow Allen to ad-lib with guests (as did Groucho Marx on his own game show You Bet Your Life), but as author Alan Havig wrote, Allen was &quot;lost in the confusion of a half hour filled with too many people and too much activity.&quot; The complicated format had to be revamped in the middle of the run. The revised premise had Allen interviewing three panelists, who would listen to three new popular songs and vote for the one that they thought had the most potential. Then came a comedy series, &quot;Fred Allen&#x27;s Sketchbook&quot;, which did not catch on.

Allen credited Goodson and Todman for &quot;keeping me alive&quot; in show business. He landed a two-year stint as a panelist on the CBS quiz show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; from 1954 to his death on March 17, 1956. In July 1955 he took a week off from the show to have an emergency appendectomy. Allen&#x27;s seat on the panel was taken by radio and TV humorist Robert Q. Lewis. The following week, Allen returned to the program, as the mystery guest. After the blindfolded panelists asked several questions, Lewis smiled and said, &quot;I know who it is. Thank you for letting me work tonight!&quot; Allen joked about the operation: &quot;It was an emergency. The doctor needed some money hurriedly.&quot;

Allen also spent his final years as a newspaper columnist/humorist and as a memoirist and rented a small New York office to work six hours a day without distractions. He wrote &quot;Treadmill to Oblivion&quot; (1954, reviewing his radio and television years) and &quot;Much Ado About Me&quot; (1956, covering his childhood and his vaudeville and Broadway years, and detailing especially vaudeville at its height with surprising objectivity); the former, which included many of his vintage radio scripts, was the best-selling book on radio&#x27;s classic period for many years. After the frustrations and failures of his attempts to succeed on television, the popularity of &quot;Treadmill&quot; revealed Allen&#x27;s potential as a literary humorist.

==Death==
 Taking one of his regular late night strolls up New York&#x27;s West 57th Street on Saturday night, March 17, 1956, Allen suffered a heart attack and died at the age of 61. A popular myth repeated for many years, first published in &quot;The New York Times&quot; story appearing the day after Allen&#x27;s death, was that he had died while walking his dog. However, biographer Robert Taylor later revealed that Allen had never owned a dog. Allen died before he could complete the final chapter of his memoirs, and as a result the book was published as he had left it. He was a tireless letter writer, and his letters were edited by his wife into the publication of &quot;Fred Allen&#x27;s Letters&quot; in 1965. 

During the following night&#x27;s regular Sunday broadcast of &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot; at 10:30 p.m., barely 24 hours following Allen&#x27;s death, host John Daly preceded the program with a special message to the viewing audience. He stated that earlier in the day the producers had considered replacing the regular game play with a special memorial episode, but Allen&#x27;s wife Portland Hoffa stated that she preferred the show be conducted as it always had been, indicating that this is what Allen would have wanted. The program then proceeded as normal, but with a noticeably subdued tone. Steve Allen (no relation) took Fred&#x27;s chair on the panel. During the final ninety seconds of the program Steve Allen, Arlene Francis and Bennett Cerf (whose eyes began to tear) gave brief but heartfelt tributes to Fred. A somber Dorothy Kilgallen thanked Steve Allen for stepping in and helping them to carry on at a difficult moment; a similar on-air farewell would air after Kilgallen herself died unexpectedly in 1965.

Allen has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: a radio star at 6713 Hollywood Boulevard and a TV star at 7001 Hollywood Boulevard. Allen was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame in 1988. A pedestrian passageway in the Boston Theater District, designated &quot;Allen&#x27;s Alley&quot;, also honors his memory.

Allen&#x27;s widow, Portland Hoffa, married bandleader Joe Rines in 1959 and celebrated a second silver wedding anniversary well before her own death of natural causes in Los Angeles on Christmas Day, 1990. Allen and Hoffa are buried alongside each other in section 47 at Gate of Heaven Cemetery in Hawthorne, New York. Both Allen&#x27;s real and stage names are engraved on the headstone.

==Cultural legacy==
Several late-1930s Warner Bros. &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon shorts feature parodies of Allen. Friz Freleng&#x27;s &quot;Toy Town Hall&quot; (1936) is a spoof of Allen&#x27;s &quot;Town Hall Tonight&quot;, with toys that come to life in a boy&#x27;s dreams and put on a variety show. Frank Tashlin&#x27;s &quot;The Woods Are Full of Cuckoos&quot; (1937) features a Fred Allen fox screaming, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t somebody &quot;tell&quot; me these things!&quot; and hinted about his heated feuds with censors, who were often forcing last-minute script changes on his show because of its content. Also, Tex Avery&#x27;s &quot;Thugs with Dirty Mugs&quot; (1938) features the main character addressing the audience and showing them his Fred Allen impersonation in one scene.

In &quot;Action Comics&quot; #50 (July 1942), Superman quips, &quot;Fred Allen would get a kick out of this!&quot; as he hops on to the side of a moving train.

<text>Tagawa Matsu (田川マツ; 1601–1647) or Weng-shi (翁氏), was the mother of Koxinga, daughter of Tagawa Shichizaemon (), a vassal of Hirado Domain. She was a Japanese who lived most of her life in the coastal town of Hirado, then later migrated to China.

== Giving birth by the stone ==

Tagawa Matsu was a Japanese woman from a samurai family in Hirado. Tagawa met and married a Han Chinese Hoklo named Zheng Zhilong from Nan&#x27;an, Fujian, China who frequently traded with the Japanese in Hirado. They fell in love with each other and married.

Zheng Zhilong was said to be &quot;very good looking&quot; and when he first came to Japan he was 18 years old.

Tagawa was a few years older than Zheng and she was in her early twenties when they met. There are different accounts on how they met. In one of them she, along with other Japanese girls from Samurai families, were waiting on the Daimyō Matsuura at an evening party when she met Zheng. The meeting may have been deliberately arranged by Matsuura or her parents to help marry her off to a foreigner. In another he met Tagawa while talking to girls along the beach in Hirado. In another, Tagawa, an Ashigaru&#x27;s daughter, was given to him by the daimyō.

Another one by in &quot;Guangyang Zaji&quot; (廣陽雜記) said that Tagawa was a widow when she met Zheng. It said that Zheng Zhilong fled to Japan when he was young and worked as a tailor. He lost his life savings of three coppers on a road and was looking for them but couldn&#x27;t find them. He started crying but a Japanese widow who was standing inside the gate of her house saw him and asked him what was wrong. Zheng Zhilong told her and then she said to him &quot;With your skill, you could easily make 3 million coppers, how could you arrive at this situation over 3 coppers?&quot; She then invited Zheng to spend the night with her and they gave themselves to each other.

She gave birth to Koxinga during a trip with her husband when she was picking seashells on the Senli Beach, Sennai River Bank (川內浦千里濱), Hirado. She gave him the Japanese name Fukumatsu. Zheng Zhilong gave him the Chinese name Zheng Sen, his name was later changed to Zheng Chenggong and granted the title Koxinga.

The stone beside which she gave birth still exists today as the Koxinga Child Birth Stone Tablet (鄭成功兒誕石碑), which is 80-cm tall and 3-metre wide, and submerged during high tides.

According to legend there was a whale washing ashore and a storm was he was born.

Being in her early twenties, and being older than Zheng Zhilong have raised the possibility Tagawa was a widow before she met Zheng since it was unusual for a woman to not be married by this age. Tagawa was the first woman Zheng fell in love with and they were viewed as having a common-law marriage already. However, the group of traders working with Captain China wanted to arrange for a Chinese woman, Lady Yan to marry Zheng Zhilong.

After the birth of Koxinga, she was still visited in Japan by Zheng Zhilong sometimes according to sources from their time.

She had another son named Shichizaemon in 1629 and gave him her family&#x27;s surname, Tagawa. Sources say that Zheng Zhilong was the father and that he visited Hirado to impregnate her with Shichizayemon and that he received the surname Tagawa because he was adopted by Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s parents but others say Shichizaemon was the product of an unknown Japanese man which is why he was given Tagawa&#x27;s surname and not Zheng. He became an ashigaru samurai. The Taiwan Waiji does not mention Shichizaemon. Louise Lux attributes both sons to Tagawa and Zheng Zhilong and says in 1624 he was 20 years old. &quot;Japan Magazine: A Representative Monthly of Things Japanese, Volume 19&quot; attributes both sons to Tagawa and Zheng Zhilong.

Tagawa Matsu raised Koxinga in Japan by herself until he was seven, and her closeness with her son is evident in some of the accomplishment and decisions Koxinga made in his adult life. Koxinga was sent to live with his father in China in 1630. The &quot;Taiwan Waiji&quot; (臺灣外記) says &quot;every night he would face east and look to his mother, hiding his tears.&quot; Tagawa Matsu did not come because she did not want to abandon Shichizaemon and was not willing to send the younger Shichizaemon on the dangerous ship ride.

In 1645, she was reunited with Koxinga by moving to Quanzhou, Fujian. She moved to Anhai despite the Japanese ban on leaving.

In 1646, when Koxinga was away fighting the Manchu Qings, the city was invaded by the Manchus. Koxinga, upon hearing of the invasion, immediately returned to Quanzhou, only to discover that his mother had killed herself in a refusal to surrender to the Manchus. After this, Koxinga developed increasingly powerful antagonism with the Manchus.

She is said in one source to have killed herself by stabbing herself in the neck. Koxinga cried when he found out his mother died. The Japanese celebrate how Tagawa committed suicide while fighting and claim that the Manchus said &quot;If the women of Japan are of such sort, what must the men be like?&quot; and that the Manchus were afraid of Japanese because of her, and they would not want to fight Japanese men if Tagawa was what Japanese women were like. The Japanese play &quot;The Battles of Coxinga&quot; said &quot;Even though she was a woman, she did not forget her old home, and paid reverence to the land that gave her birth. Until her last breath she thought of the honor of Japan.&quot; The Japanese claim she committed suicide while fighting and that she preferred &quot;death&quot; and had the &quot;Yamato spirit&quot; while what really occurred is unknown because of the many different versions offered from different sources. The Japanese Foreign Affairs association during World War II cited Tagawa as an example of a Japanese who had &quot;the spirit of facing certain death in order to live up to a cherished cause&quot;.

The Qing being responsible for killing Tagawa was something Zheng Zhilong had to live with since he did not know the Qing were going to kill her. The Qing did not trust him because they were the ones who got Tagawa killed so he might turn against the Qing if they let him go. His Japanese blood is believed to be the cause for his violent propensity according to a Spanish missionary.

== Dispute over background ==

Tagawa&#x27;s real first name is unknown and she is only known by her surname Tagawa in Japan and China. According to Japanese folklore in Hirado her name was Matsu.

===Half-Chinese theory===

In the Zheng family genealogy, Tagawa Matsu is recorded under the Sinicized name of Weng-shi. Some Chinese records indicated that this is because after she moved to Quanzhou, an old ironsmith neighbour, Weng Yihuang (), treated this foreigner newcomer like his own daughter.

There are a small number of Chinese sources mistaking Tagawa Matsu as Weng Yihuang&#x27;s blood daughter, with a Japanese mother surnamed Tagawa. Chinese on Taiwan who seek to downplay Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s Japanese identity accept this theory that she was the daughter of the Chinese Weng Yihuang and a Japanese Tagawa woman, making Koxinga only one fourth Japanese through one Japanese grandmother.

According to hearsay heard by Tatemori Kō, Tagawa Matsu was the daughter of a Japanese woman Tagawa and the Chinese swordsmith Weng (Ō in Japanese), Tagawa married Weng after the Hirado Daimyo had a sword forged for him by Weng after he went from China to Japan, and then the Tagawa woman and Weng had a daughter (Tagawa Matsu) who married Zheng Zhilong, according to the 1913 book Shu Seiko Den by Tatemori Ko. The Taiwan source &quot;Free China Review&quot; also claims this.

This is unlikely, as this would necessitate either Weng Yihuang moving to Japan (as he was an ironsmith, neither a sailor nor a trader) or the migration of the Tagawa women back and forth between the two nations (as traveling of women was restricted).

===Adopted theory===

Other sources say that Weng Yihuang was her stepfather, that Weng Yihuang married Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s widowed Japanese mother after Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s Japanese father died and adopted her as his stepdaughter.

===Prostitute or Princess===

The Zheng family&#x27;s enemies attacked Tagawa by suggesting she was a Japanese prostitute Zheng Zhilong picked up, while Tagawa&#x27;s Japanese descendants claim she was a descendant of the Japanese Imperial family. This traces her descent to Japan&#x27;s 50th Emperor, Kammu Tenno, 19 generations from Tagawa Matsu through Taira no Shigemori and Tagawa Yazayemon 田川 弥左衛門. The English diplomat R. A. B Posonby-Fane pushed the theory that Tagawa was a Japanese woman from a high class Samurai background. It is agreed by modern historians that she was neither and that she was a Japanese girl from an average Samurai family, not of high rank and not a prostitute. There is no proof for either the accusation that she was a prostitute or the claim that she was of aristocratic descent. Donald Keene pointed out that there was a real marriage between Zheng Zhilong and Miss Tagawa despite Zheng also later marrying a Chinese woman, so she was not a prostitute or a courtesan.

===Samurai===

Japanese sources say she was full blooded Japanese. Japanese sources say that her samurai father was either Lord Matsuura&#x27;s Samurai Tagawa Yazayemon or her father&#x27;s name was Tagawa Shichizaemon whom she named her second son after. According to stories passed down by Japanese in Hirado, Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s father was Tagawa Shichizaemon (田川七左衛門) whom she named her second son after.

The samurai Tagawa Yazayemon was an ashigaru according to Hirado folklore and there was nothing else describing him as that according to Inagaki. In Taiyo, an article was written by Matsui Nobuaki which said that Tagawa Yazayemon was not Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s father but instead her father was Tagawa Shichizayemon.

Wong said he cannot link her to the Ashigaru or the Tagawa samurai family.

The Tokugawa Japanese Shogunate compiled work, the &quot;Account of the Keicho Era&quot; (Keicho shosetsu) says that &quot;While Zhilong was initially in Hirado, he married a woman, née Tagawa of a samurai family.&quot;

== Descendants ==
In Koxinga Memorial Temple (鄭成功祠) in Tainan, Taiwan, Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s ancestral tablet is placed in a chamber called the Shrine of Queen Dowager Weng (). The title &quot;queen dowager&quot; is a posthumous title based on the princeship/kingship of Koxinga (Prince-King of Yanping Prefecture) in the Southern Ming Empire.

Tagawa&#x27;s ancestral tablet was saved after the Qing attack.

Tagawa Matsu&#x27;s descendants through Koxinga live in both mainland China and Taiwan and her descendants through Shichizaemon live in Japan. Her descendants through her great-grandson Zheng Keshuang served as Han Bannermen in Beijing until 1911 when the Xinhai revolution broke out and the Qing dynasty fell, after which they moved back to Anhai and Nan&#x27;an in southern Fujian in mainland China. They still live there to this day. Her descendants through her grandson Zheng Kuan live in Taiwan. Zheng Daoshun was the son of Shichizaemon and he adopted the Zheng surname.

The &quot;Asiatic Society of Japan&quot; said &quot;It was five years after the birth of Tei Seikō [Koxinga] that his father [Zheng Zhilong] left for China and accepted the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Imperial forces. Soon after his departure, his wife gave birth to a second son who was named Shichizaemon&quot; who spend his life wholly in Japan and did not develop the love for adventure and renown which made his elder brother so famous. &quot; &quot;The descendants of Shichizaemon served the Government for many years as interpreters of Chinese, and there reside to this day in Nagasaki certain Japanese who point with pride to their ancestor.&quot;

One of Tagawa&#x27;s Chinese descendants, Zheng Xiaoxuan (鄭曉嵐) the father of Zheng Chouyu, fought against the Japanese invaders in the Second Sino-Japanese War. Zheng Chouyu () was born in Shandong in mainland China in 1933 and called himself a &quot;child of the resistance&quot; against Japan and he became a refugee during the war, moving from place to place across China to avoid the Japanese. He moved to Taiwan in 1949 and focuses his work on building stronger ties between Taiwan and mainland China. Zheng Chouyu was born in mainland China, he identified as Chinese and he felt alienated after he was forced to move to Taiwan in 1949 which was previously under Japanese rule and felt strange and foreign to him. He is Koxinga&#x27;s 11th generation descendant and his original name is Zheng Wenji.

<doc id="248715" wikidata="Q335059" url="?curid=248715" title="John French, 1st Earl of Ypres">
<text>Field Marshal John Denton Pinkstone French, 1st Earl of Ypres, (28 September 1852 – 22 May 1925), known as Sir John French from 1901 to 1916, and as The Viscount French between 1916 and 1922, was a senior British Army officer.
Born in Kent, he saw brief service as a midshipman in the Royal Navy, before becoming a cavalry officer. He achieved rapid promotion and distinguished himself on the Gordon Relief Expedition. He became a national hero during the Second Boer War. He commanded I Corps at Aldershot, then served as Inspector-General of the Army, before becoming Chief of the Imperial General Staff (CIGS, the professional head of the British Army) in 1912. He helped to prepare the British Army for a possible European war, and was among those who insisted that cavalry still be trained to charge with sabre and lance. During the Curragh incident he had to resign as CIGS after promising Hubert Gough in writing that the Army would not be used to coerce Ulster Protestants into a Home Rule Ireland.

French&#x27;s most important role was as Commander-in-Chief of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) for the first year and a half of the First World War. After the British suffered heavy casualties at the battles of Mons and Le Cateau, French wanted to withdraw the BEF from the Allied line to refit and only agreed to take part in the First Battle of the Marne after a private meeting with the Secretary of State for War, Lord Kitchener, against whom he bore a grudge thereafter. In May 1915 he leaked information about shell shortages to the press in the hope of engineering Kitchener&#x27;s removal. By summer 1915 French&#x27;s command was being increasingly criticised in London by Kitchener and other members of the government, and by Haig, Robertson and other senior generals in France. After the Battle of Loos, at which French&#x27;s slow release of XI Corps from reserve was blamed for the failure to achieve a decisive breakthrough on the first day, H. H. Asquith, the British Prime Minister, demanded his resignation.

French was appointed Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces for 1916–1918. He then became Lord Lieutenant of Ireland in 1918, a position he held through much of the Irish War of Independence (1919–1922), in which his own sister was involved on the republican side. During this time he published &quot;1914&quot;, an inaccurate and much criticised volume of memoirs.

==Early life and career==
===Family===
French&#x27;s family was related to the French/De Freyne family which had gone to present-day County Wexford in the fourteenth century and had substantial estates at Frenchpark, County Roscommon. French always regarded himself as &quot;Irish&quot;, although his branch of the family had lived in England since the eighteenth century.

His father was Royal Navy Commander John Tracey William French, who had fought at Navarino and under Napier in the Portuguese Civil War. His mother was Margaret Eccles, from Glasgow, who after suffering a breakdown following her husband&#x27;s death was eventually institutionalised. She died in 1867 leaving French to be brought up by his sisters. He was educated at a Harrow preparatory school and Eastman&#x27;s Royal Naval Academy at Portsmouth before joining the Royal Navy in 1866.

===Royal Navy===
He joined the Royal Navy because it gave him a chance to leave home four or five years earlier than the Army. From August 1866 he trained on board the three-decker battleship HMS &quot;Britannia&quot; at Dartmouth. He obtained only an &quot;average&quot; certificate which required him to do a further six months of training on board the frigate HMS &quot;Bristol&quot; at Sheerness from January 1868 before qualifying as a midshipman.

In 1869 he served as a midshipman on HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; commanded by Captain Boys, an old friend of French&#x27;s father. She patrolled in the English Channel and off Spain and Portugal. During his service he witnessed the accidental sinking of HMS &quot;Captain&quot;. He resigned from the Royal Navy in November 1870 as he was discovered to be acrophobic and to suffer from seasickness.

===Early army career===
French joined the Suffolk Artillery Militia in November 1870 where he was expected to put in about two months a year with the regiment. He initially failed his exams (mathematics and foreign languages) for a regular commission. He was commissioned as a lieutenant in the 8th King&#x27;s Royal Irish Hussars on 28 February 1874, but there is no evidence that he ever served with them. 

He transferred to the 19th Hussars on 11 March 1874 possibly as it was less expensive—following the sale of the family home at Ripple Valley French&#x27;s private income of £1,000 per annum was enough to cover the £500–£600 required by his new regiment. He was posted to Aldershot Command. He became an expert hunter and steeplechaser, permanently damaging the little finger of his right hand in a fall. The 19th Hussars were posted to Ireland in June 1876. In September 1877 French was one of two lieutenants who persuaded 70 drunk and mutinous troopers, who had armed themselves with sticks and threatened &quot;murder&quot;, to return to barracks. In 1880 the 19th were deployed to Ballinrobe and Lough Mask to protect labourers ricking hay at the height of the Captain Boycott disturbances. An Irishman hamstrung French&#x27;s horse with a sickle while he was sitting on it.
He became adjutant of his regiment on 1 June 1880. At that time the 19th Hussars had only one major but as three different men held that rank in three years (1877–1880) the resulting turnover of officers brought French his promotion to captain on 16 October 1880.

He became adjutant of the Northumberland Hussars on 1 April 1881. While in Northumberland he missed out on active service: the 19th Hussars took part in the occupation of Egypt and Battle of Tel el-Kebir (13 September 1882) but French&#x27;s applications to rejoin his regiment were rejected by the War Office. An increase in the number of majors in the 19th Hussars brought French promotion to that rank on 3 April 1883. These promotions (captain at the age of 28, major at 30) were relatively rapid.

===Sudan===
French was initially expected to rejoin his regiment when they returned to Ireland, but the emergence of the Mahdi in the Sudan required them to fight Mahdist forces near Suakin. French rejoined the regiment when they returned to Cairo in October 1884.

French took part in the Sudan expedition to relieve Major-General Charles Gordon in 1884. He was second-in-command to his friend Lieutenant Colonel Percy Barrow, with the cavalry which accompanied Brigadier-General Sir Herbert Stewart as he took the short route across 176 miles of desert. Most of the cavalry work was in reconnaissance and warding off Dervish raids, although they did—at a walk—pursue the retreating enemy after the Battle of Abu Klea in January 1885. By the time they reached the Nile the horses had not been watered for between 56 and 72 hours. During the retreat back across the desert via Jakdul (the expedition had reached Khartoum too late to save Gordon) French led a rearguard of thirteen men, warding off Dervish attacks and impressing Redvers Buller and Sir Garnet Wolseley.

He was promoted to lieutenant colonel on 7 February 1885. Once again, this was an unusually early promotion, and he was appointed second-in-command of the 19th Hussars. His experience of handling cavalry with scarce water would stand him in good stead in South Africa. In January 1886 he briefly acted as Commanding Officer when Colonel Barrow died, but French was considered too young for the position, and Colonel Boyce Combe was transferred in.

From June 1886 to April 1888 French was stationed at Norwich with the regiment. He became Commanding Officer of the 19th Hussars on 27 September 1888. He impressed Evelyn Wood by his initiative in organising his regiment into squadrons.

===India and divorce scandal===

He was promoted brevet colonel (7 February 1889), and was posted to India in September 1891. There, at cavalry camp during an exercise in November 1891, he first met Captain Douglas Haig, with whose career his own was to be entwined for the next 25 years. French became Assistant Adjutant-General of Cavalry in 1893.

In India serving initially at Secunderabad and Bangalore, French worked as a staff officer under Sir George Luck, a noted trainer of cavalry, albeit with perhaps an excessive emphasis on parade-ground drill. French commanded a brigade of Indian Cavalry on manoeuvres near Lahore in January 1893. He seems not to have acquired the deep affection for India common in officers who served there.

French&#x27;s wife did not accompany him to India (they seem to have lived apart for a while after his return from Egypt). When commanding the 19th Hussars in India, French was cited for adultery with the wife of a brother officer during his leave in the Indian hills; he was lucky this did not terminate his career. There were also unsubstantiated rumours that French had had affairs with the daughter of an Anglo-Indian railway official and also, earlier in his career, with his commanding officer&#x27;s wife. A later tale, that he had once been the lover of the Irish nationalist Maud Gonne, appeared in Mary Colum&#x27;s &quot;Life and the Dream&quot; (1947), although his biographer comments that it &quot;lacks firm evidence&quot;.

He was on half-pay in 1893–1895, possibly as a result of the Indian divorce scandal, and reduced to bicycling with his sons as he could not afford to keep horses. According to his son Gerald he would hop alongside the bicycle as he never mastered the art of mounting it.

===Career saved twice===
Two years on half pay would normally have meant compulsory retirement but in autumn 1894 he temporarily commanded a cavalry brigade on the manoeuvres in the Vale of the White Horse in Berkshire. French commented that the role of modern cavalry was not to &quot;cut and hack and thrust&quot; but rather to herd the enemy within range of friendly artillery. His handling of the brigade was seen as one of the few successful parts of the manoeuvres. He was appointed Assistant Adjutant-General at Army Headquarters on 24 August 1895, writing a new cavalry training manual (in practice extensively assisted by Captain Douglas Haig).

French went on to be Commander of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade at Canterbury on 1 May 1897 and Commander of the 1st Cavalry Brigade at Aldershot Command on 12 January 1899. Haig, recently returned from the Sudan War, was French&#x27;s brigade-major at Aldershot. French was promoted to temporary major-general early in 1899. There were some accusations that these promotions, for a man whose career had so recently nearly ended, relied too much on powerful patrons. Early in 1899, at his own request, French borrowed £2,500, in a formal contract with interest, from Haig. He was within 24 hours of bankruptcy—which would have required him to resign his commission—after unwise investments in South African mining shares (Transvaal Golds), which crashed in value as war loomed. Richard Holmes believed the loan was never repaid, but Haig&#x27;s biographer Walter Reid believes that the loan was probably repaid in 1909.

==Boer War==
===Early war===
====Arrival====
French embarked from Southampton for the Second Boer War on 23 September 1899, inviting Haig to share his cabin. War had not yet officially been declared when French put to sea. British troops were being sent in the hope of intimidating President Paul Kruger of the Transvaal into granting equal voting rights to the Uitlanders—non-Boer settlers—which would break the Boer stronghold on political power. It had the opposite effect, as the Boers issued their own ultimatum on 9 October, while the British troops were still at sea, in the hope of provoking an anti-British rising by the Boers of the British-ruled Cape Colony. He was appointed both a major-general on the staff and a local major-general.

French arrived at Cape Town on 11 October. He had expected to command a cavalry brigade under Lieutenant-General George White in Natal, White also had the equivalent of a division of infantry but Colonel Brocklehurst was appointed to this command, while French and Haig were ordered to proceed to Natal &quot;for the present&quot; after receiving a cable from the Nord Office, which they guessed correctly meant that they were to take charge of the Cavalry Division when Buller&#x27;s Army Corps arrived. After steaming to Durban French and Haig arrived in Ladysmith at 5:40am on 20 October, just as hostilities were beginning.

====Elandslaagte====
On the morning of his arrival, French was ordered to investigate reports that the Boers had taken Elandslaagte. Taking with him the 5th Lancers, six squadrons of Natal Carbineers and Natal Mounted Rifles, a battery of field artillery and a brigade of infantry under Colonel Ian Hamilton, he made contact with the Boers at 13:00 that day. White was initially cautious but on 21 October, having learned of Symons&#x27; victory at Talana the previous day, he permitted French to attack. Concerned at French&#x27;s lack of experience at commanding infantry, White initially proposed that his chief of staff Maj-Gen Archibald Hunter take command, but Hunter advised that French should be left in command. White himself came merely to observe. French enjoyed numerical superiority of around 3:1.

Elandslaagte saw British cavalry charge with the lance, cutting down fleeing Boers amid gory scenes described by one British officer as &quot;most excellent pig-sticking&quot;. This was portrayed as proving the continued relevance of cavalry charges, but in fact owed much to the success of Hamilton&#x27;s preceding infantry attack and the fact that the charge was carried out at dusk. French celebrated the anniversary of this small battle for the rest of his life and it was seized on by the press in Britain.

That night White ordered all British forces to fall back on Ladysmith, where it was soon clear that they were about to be besieged by the combined Transvaal and Orange Free State forces. French spent much of 26 and 27 October patrolling around the advancing Boer forces. On 30 October his cavalry fought dismounted at Lombard&#x27;s Kop north-east of Ladysmith; this was the right flank of three unsuccessful actions—the others being Nicholson&#x27;s Nek and an infantry action at Long Hill in the centre which ended in near-rout—fought by White&#x27;s troops on &quot;Mournful Monday&quot;.

Although French pointed out that cavalry were unlikely to be of much use in a besieged town, White refused him permission to break out. On 2 November, after he had spent the morning on a raid on a Boer laager, French received orders to leave Ladysmith. French and Haig escaped under fire on the last train out as the Boer siege began; Boers tore up the track minutes after the train passed. Steaming from Durban on 3 November, he arrived at Cape Town on 8 November, meeting with Buller, whose Army Corps was then arriving.

====Colesberg operations====
French was initially ordered to assemble the Cavalry Division at Maitland, near Cape Town. Now a local lieutenant-general like Buller&#x27;s other four division commanders, he was then ordered to take command of forces covering the Colesberg area, filling the gap between Methuen&#x27;s division (operating at Orange River Station, with a view to relieving Kimberley and Mafeking) and Gatacre&#x27;s Division at Stormberg. On 18 November he went up to De Aar, nearer the front, to confer with Maj-Gen Wauchope, in charge of the lines of communication.

French arrived at Naawpoort on the afternoon of 20 November, and personally led a reconnaissance the following morning. The Boer force of General Schoeman had been reinforced by local Boers, and French, not strong enough to attack Arundel directly, conducted an active defence. At one stage, in late November and until 14 December, he was also required to extend his forces east to Rosmead to protect the railway to Port Elizabeth. A Boer penetration here would have cut off Cape Colony from Natal. French was proud of having kept the initiative over the Boers despite his force of 2,000 men being outnumbered two to one. French&#x27;s subordinate Colonel T. C. Porter won a small action near Vaal Kop on 13 December, but the Boers captured that place on 16 December, causing French to go forward and take personal command. Around this time he offered to cancel his plans to advance on Colesberg and lend his cavalry to Methuen, who had been defeated at Magersfontein, but this was rejected as there was insufficient water even for Methuen&#x27;s own horses in the sector.

Between Field Marshal Frederick Roberts&#x27; appointment as Commander-in-Chief on 17 December 1899 (following the defeats of Black Week) and arrival at Cape Town on 10 January, French was the only senior British commander to conduct active operations. Although Schoeman&#x27;s force had grown further in size, he had lost the confidence of his subordinates and, after a Boer council of war, fell back on a strong position surrounded by hills at Colesberg (29 December) just as French had been preparing to outflank him. French instead (1 January 1900) pinned down the Boer forces and turned their right flank (the British left). The fighting went on until 25 January, with French several times attempting to turn the Boer flanks but pulling back as his forces ran into resistance.

French did not succeed in capturing Colesberg, but he had prevented a Boer invasion of the Cape and tied down Boer forces which might have been used elsewhere. Leo Amery&#x27;s &quot;Times History&quot;, highly critical of British generalship during this period, later wrote of his &quot;almost unbroken series of successes&quot;, showing grasp of tactics. Cavalry—often fighting dismounted—never made up more than half of his force, and were usually outnumbered three-to-one by Boer cavalry. There were some accusations that French was a glory-hunter.

===Under Roberts===
====Cavalry Division====
French was one of the few senior officers to be retained by Roberts. Roberts summoned French to Cape Town on 29 January to inquire about expenditure of horses and ammunition around Colesberg. French came away with the impression that he had &quot;only with difficulty persuaded (Roberts and Kitchener) on 29 January to send the Cavalry Division and himself in command of it&quot;. French&#x27;s insecurity was increased by this turn of events—not only did he belong to the wrong faction in the Army—the followers of Wolseley and Buller—now in eclipse, but he had up until now been denied command both of the cavalry brigade in Natal and the Cavalry Division (instead being given &quot;ad hoc&quot; forces to command in both cases).

French was affectionate about &quot;dear old Bobs&quot; but sometimes took a dim view of his military abilities. He correctly predicted that the centralisation of transport would lead to a collapse in supply arrangements. French disliked William Nicholson, under whose control Roberts had centralised all transport, and retained autonomy for Cavalry Division transport.

Unlike Roberts, French and Haig believed that cavalry should still be trained to charge with steel as well as to fight dismounted with firearms. They appreciated the value of good colonial troops and trained Mounted Infantry, but had already insisted that the New Zealand Mounted Rifles fix bayonets to their carbines to use as lances, and were sceptical about the Colonial &quot;Skallywag&quot; units which Roberts was raising. Roberts also appointed the Earl of Erroll as Assistant Adjutant-General (AAG) of the Cavalry Division, with Haig, to whom Buller had promised the job, as his deputy—French did his best to bypass Erroll and work through Haig. On 31 January French returned to the Colesberg front to break up his old command, leaving Maj-Gen R. A. P. Clemens to cover the Colesberg area with a mixed force.

====March to relieve Kimberley====
Kitchener ordered French (10 February) &quot;The cavalry must relieve Kimberley at all costs&quot;. French promised Roberts that if he were still alive he would be in Kimberley, where the civilian population was urging Colonel Robert Kekewich to surrender, in five days.

French&#x27;s Cavalry Division consisted of three cavalry brigades and two brigades of mounted infantry, although the latter did not accompany them when they broke camp at 3 am on 11 March—a separate provisional brigade of mounted infantry was provided instead. Roberts gave an inspirational speech to French&#x27;s brigade and regimental commanders. Rather than cross the Modder River directly (Kimberley lay around 25 miles north-east), they made an envelopment move: first over 20 miles south to Ramdam, then about 15 miles east to seize the Riet River Crossings, then about 25 miles (roughly north-north-east) to Klip Drift on the Modder, then another 20 miles north-west to Kimberley. This was to be accomplished across arid land in five days, with much of the travel by moonlight as it was the middle of summer. French carried only six days&#x27; rations for the men and five days&#x27; forage for the horses.

The force left Ramdam at 2 am on 12 February, with only 4,000 horsemen rather than the 8,000 he had expected to have, but French felt he had to push on rather than wait for straggling units to catch up (the brigades&#x27; staffs were all new, and brigadiers only joined their units in the course of the march). De Kiel&#x27;s Drift on the Riet was seized by mid afternoon—French ordered his cavalry to gallop for it as soon as he saw the way was clear—but the crossing was soon in what Haig called &quot;an indescribable state of confusion&quot; as Roberts had neglected to order priority for Cavalry Division baggage. Kitchener, arriving in the evening, ordered French to seize Waterval Drift, another crossing a few miles to the northwest where he had left a brigade masking a small Boer force under Christiaan de Wet. Although this was done, the advance could not be resumed until 10.30am on 13 February, and accompanied by five baggage wagons which had managed to get through the logjam at De Kiel&#x27;s Drift.

====Klip Drift====
French&#x27;s division moved in line of squadron columns across a five-mile wide front, halting between 12.30 and 1 pm at the well at Blauuwboschpan, where he left a garrison to hold until the infantry arrived. He brushed aside a small Boer force (perhaps 300 men) which attempted to block his path to the Modder River, but concerned that he might be attacked from the east by de Wet&#x27;s main force, moved quickly at 2 pm to seize the crossings at Rondeval and Klip Drift (he aimed to at least threaten two crossings to avoid the delay which had happened at De Kiel&#x27;s Drift). By 5 pm he was able to send a galloper to Roberts with the message that he was across the Modder. He had lost only three men wounded, although 40 horses had died of exhaustion and over 500 were incapable of further work. French then had to wait a day while Thomas Kelly-Kenny&#x27;s 6th Infantry Division made a forced march from the Riet Crossings to the Modder Crossings, during which time Piet Cronje, believing French&#x27;s advance to be a feint, missed an opportunity to reinforce the area.

Equipped with three days&#x27; supplies, French resumed his advance at 9.30 am on 15 February. At Abon&#x27;s Dam, five miles north of the Modder, French sent his cavalry, supported by the fire of 56 guns, charging up a valley between two Boer held ridges. The charge was led by the 9th and 16th Lancers. The Boer riflemen, perhaps 600 in number, were able to achieve little at ranges of 1,000 yards.

Amery&#x27;s &quot;Times History&quot; later wrote &quot;the charge at Klip Drift marks an epoch in the history of cavalry&quot;, arguing that French had &quot;divined&quot; that a cavalry charge made with &quot;reckless, dare-devil confidence&quot; could cut through a line of &quot;unseen&quot; enemy infantry who could have resisted a cautious attack by British infantry. The &quot;Official History&quot; called it &quot;the most brilliant stroke of the war&quot;. He was also later praised by the cavalry writer Erskine Childers and by the German history of the campaign, which cited Klip Drift as evidence that cavalry could still charge infantry armed with magazine rifles. These claims were exaggerated. French had attacked a thinly-held part of the line, under cover of artillery fire and dust clouds, inflicting only 20 Boer casualties to sword and lance (as opposed to 60 at Elandslaagte). French himself saw it as a triumph of the cavalry spirit rather than a charge with cold steel &quot;per se&quot;.

French entered Kimberley at 6 pm on 15 February, and was entertained at the Sanatorium by Cecil Rhodes, who soon persuaded him to relieve Kekewich, the military commander of the town. Holmes cites this as an evidence of French&#x27;s tendency to take against people based only on superficial evidence.

French was congratulated by Roberts, and Queen Victoria praised the cavalry&#x27;s &quot;brilliant success&quot;. For his success with the relief, French was promoted for distinguished service in the field on 21 February 1900, from substantive colonel to supernumerary major-general, and to local lieutenant-general. Although French was later criticised for attacking the Boers around Kimberley on 16 February, Roberts&#x27; orders to pursue the retreating Cronje did not reach him owing to a cut telegraph line, and there is no evidence that Roberts made further efforts to contact him, although French heliographed to request orders.

====Paardeberg====
Orders to pursue Cronje were hand-delivered to French at 10 pm on 16 February. French had only 1,500 mounted men and 12 guns fit for duty, but, setting out at 3 am on 17 February, he and Broadwood led an advanced guard on a forced march, twice as fast as Cronje&#x27;s force, to intercept them at 10 am as they tried to cross the Modder at Vendutie Drift (around 30 miles from Kimberley). Outnumbered three to one, and with another 2,000 Boers close by, French held his position long enough for the British infantry to catch up with Cronje&#x27;s army at Paardeberg.

French was too far away to interfere in the Battle of Paardeberg, although he sent a message urging caution—Kitchener ignored this and launched a disastrous frontal assault on 18 February. French spent the day holding off Boers who attempted to reinforce Cronje&#x27;s force. French also prevented the main Boer field army from escaping across the Modder River after the battle.

====Poplar Grove====
Cronje at last surrendered his field army to Roberts on 27 February. On the morning of Klip Drift French had had 5,027 horses, but by 28 February exhaustion had reduced this number to 3,553. As Roberts prepared to advance on Bloemfontein, French was now, on 6 March, ordered to take his division and two Mounted Infantry Brigades and swing seventeen miles around the left flank of the Boer position at Poplar Grove on the Modder River, while Roberts&#x27; main force prepared to attack them from the front. Although French now had 5,665 horses again, many of these were of poor quality and sick, and he was short of fodder. On the basis of incorrect information from Colonel Richardson, Director of Supplies, who had not realised that sick horses were also entitled to fodder, Roberts gave French a dressing-down in front of his brigadiers, for consuming too many supplies. This was probably a turning point in their relationship.

French led his men out of camp at 3 am on 7 March, amid confusion as Kelly-Kenny&#x27;s Division, which was supposed to follow his, had started an hour earlier owing to unclear orders. The moon had set and French had to halt between 5 am and 5.45 am to await daybreak. By 7 am he had reached Kalkfontein Dam, a march of 12 miles, and spent 45 minutes watering his horses. By 7.30 am the Boers began to retreat from their position. Roberts later blamed French for failing to cut them off (and missing a chance to capture President Kruger). French argued that his horses were too weak to do more than trot, and that he was not strong enough as Kelly-Kenny&#x27;s men had not yet arrived. He concentrated his Division for a pursuit, but even then was beaten off by the Boer rearguard. The &quot;Official History&quot; supported French&#x27;s decision, although some felt that French was giving less than wholehearted co-operation after his unjustified public rebuke over the fodder issue. Holmes suggests that French carried out a plan in which he had no confidence because of Roberts&#x27; reputation for ruthlessness with unsatisfactory officers.

French and Haig were sceptical about the riding abilities of Mounted Infantry, and felt that Roberts was wasting too many horses on them (Haig letter to his sister 16 March 1900) and that the cavalry had been &quot;practically starving&quot; since 11 February. Bloemfontein fell on 13 March, and soon suffered an outbreak of typhoid. In an implicit criticism of Roberts, French recorded (22 March 1900) that there &quot;would be a grand opportunity for a great strategist at the head of affairs&quot;. With Roberts&#x27; main army immobilised by disease at Bloemfontein, de Wet was still active making raids around the British periphery. Roberts eventually (20 March) sent French with a single cavalry brigade and some guns and Mounted Infantry in a vain attempt to intercept Olivier&#x27;s column (numbering 6,000–7,000 men) at Thabanchu. French made another raid to Karee Siding (29 March)—but until the middle of April he devoted most of his energies to inspecting the horses, many of them Argentinian, with which his division was being remounted.

French was summoned to see Roberts (5 April 1900), who told him (5 April 1900) that the fighting at Poplar Grove proved that the future lay with Mounted Infantry. French wrote to Colonel Lonsdale Hale, former professor at Staff College (12 April 1900), for speaking out for the idea of cavalry against the &quot;chatter and cackle&quot; of its opponents, quoting the opinion of a German officer that Mounted Infantry were too poor at riding to fight effectively. French also clashed with Edward Hutton (14 April) when he asked for French&#x27;s cavalry to be used to relieve his mounted infantry on outpost duty.

====Kroonstad====
On the march to Pretoria (early May 1900) French&#x27;s three brigades made up the left wing of Roberts&#x27; main thrust. (Other thrusts were by Mahon and Hunter over the Bechuanaland border, by Buller up from Natal and a semi-independent command under Hamilton, which might have been French&#x27;s had he not been out of favour.) French lost another 184 of his still unacclimatised horses making—on Roberts&#x27; orders—a forced march to the Vet River.

Botha was now making a stand along the River Zand, in front of the Orange Free State&#x27;s temporary capital at Kroonstad. French was ordered to encircle Botha from the left, accompanied by Hutton&#x27;s Mounted Infantry, while Broadwood struck from the right. Roberts over-ruled French&#x27;s wish to make a wide encirclement and ordered a shallower one—this lost the advantage of surprise, and Botha pulled his forces back so that French ran into strong resistance on 10 May. Roberts now ordered French to pull back and make a deeper encirclement as he had originally proposed, with a view to cutting the railway behind Kroonstad. However, French&#x27;s cavalry were now too tired, after an advance of forty miles, to achieve much, and Botha&#x27;s army escaped. The &quot;Times History&quot; later praised French&#x27;s rapidity of movement but criticised him—unfairly in Holmes&#x27; view—for failure to concentrate his forces.

====Transvaal====
Roberts halted in Kroonstad to repair the railway and refit between 12 and 22 May. New horses arrived for French, but a third of them were unfit for action, and French and Hutton were only able to muster 2,330 effectives. French and Hamilton were now sent to threaten Johannesburg from the left.

Roberts entered Johannesburg (31 May) and Pretoria (5 June), although without pressing Botha to a decisive battle in either case. French correctly dismissed talk of victory as premature, and continued to spend much of his time inspecting remounts—the job of Director of Remounts at Stellenbosch had been given to an incompetent and manic depressive officer, who eventually shot himself. French played a key role at the victory over Louis Botha at Diamond Hill (11–12 June) in the north-east Transvaal. French, leading one of his own brigades in the usual encircling movement, came under heavy fire—a medical major was shot at his side—but held his position despite Roberts&#x27; permission to withdraw.

In mid-July French operated against de Wet&#x27;s guerrilla force around Pretoria, although he did not understand that this was an autonomous force, and advised Roberts that the best defence would be to continue to attack Botha&#x27;s main army. French was then recalled to take part in another attack on Botha&#x27;s army, but once again Roberts vetoed French&#x27;s proposal of a deeper encirclement (on the British right this time), allowing Botha&#x27;s army to escape.

In late July 1900 Reginald Pole-Carew, commander of 11th Division, refused to accept French&#x27;s orders. French at first asked to be relieved of responsibility for Pole-Carew&#x27;s sector, but matters were patched up after what French described as a &quot;somewhat stormy&quot; meeting.

====Barberton====
By August 1900 the Boer forces had been pushed into the northeast Transvaal. French was holding a position beyond Middelburg, maintaining moral ascendancy over the enemy by active probing and patrolling as he had around Colesberg earlier in the year. Roberts&#x27; plan was to push slowly eastward along the Delagoa Bay railway connecting Pretoria with the sea, while he ordered French to co-operate with Buller as he marched up from Natal. French wrote (24 August) &quot;We sadly want someone in Chief Command here&quot;. Roberts at first refused French permission to concentrate the Cavalry Division for an outflanking move towards Barberton, an important Boer depot, and when he at last gave permission in late August Botha&#x27;s force had retreated too far to be encircled as French had intended. Barberton is surrounded by 3,000 foot mountains, and French once again made a bold encircling move—first (9 September) south from the railway to Carolina, deceiving the Boer commandos that he intended to move southwest. He then moved back, and personally led his 1st Cavalry Brigade up a bridle path through the mountains ready to attack Barberton from the west. As soon as Henry Jenner Scobell, who had been sent around with two squadrons of the Greys, heliographed that he had cut the railway, French led his men down into the town. Scobell captured £10,000 in gold and notes, while French telegraphed to Roberts: &quot;Have captured forty engines, seventy wagons of stores, eighty women all in good working order&quot;. Boer sniping from the hills ceased after French threatened to withdraw his men and shell the town.

The war seemed over as Kruger left the country on 11 September 1900 (he sailed to the Netherlands from Portuguese Lourenço Marques on 19 November 1900). French was promoted from supernumerary to substantive major-general on 9 October 1900, while continuing to hold the local rank of lieutenant-general.

===Under Kitchener===
====Johannesburg Area====
French&#x27;s colonials were sent home and replaced by regular Mounted Infantry. Roberts told French that the Cavalry Division was to be broken up, although he would retain &quot;nominal command&quot;, and gave him command of Johannesburg Area. On 17 December 1900 Pieter Hendrik Kritzinger and Herzog invaded Cape Colony, hoping to stir up rebellion among the Cape Boers. French had only 22,000 men, of whom 13,000 were combatants, to fight 20,000 Boer guerrillas.

By April 1901, French&#x27;s eight columns had captured 1,332 Boers. French was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of the Bath (KCB), for his role in the conventional phases of the war (the award was dated 29 November 1900 and gazetted in April 1901, but French did not receive the decoration itself until an audience with King Edward VII at Buckingham Palace on 8 August 1902).

====Cape Colony====
On 1 June 1901 Kitchener ordered French to take command in Cape Colony. He was ordered to use &quot;severity&quot; against captured rebels—this was intended to complement lenient treatment for those who surrendered voluntarily. Milner had already warned French not to treat every Cape Boer as a rebel unless it was proven so. French, who had lost several friends during the war, believed that stern measures would help end matters more quickly. French even forced the inhabitants of Middelburg to watch one hanging, incurring a concerned inquiry from St John Brodrick (Secretary of State for War).

During this period of the war—conducting &quot;drives&quot; across the country for Boer guerrillas, and eventually dividing up the country with barbed wire and imprisoning Boer civilians in camps—French had to struggle with out-of-date information, and trying to maintain communications between British forces by telegraph, heliograph and dispatch rider. Kritzinger was driven out of the Cape in mid-August 1901, and Harry Scobell captured Lotter&#x27;s commando (5 September 1901). On 7 September Smuts defeated a squadron of Haig&#x27;s 17th Lancers at Elands River Poort. Gideon Scheepers was captured on 11 October.

====Relations with Kitchener====
French had a serious personality clash with the ascetic Kitchener, worsened by both men&#x27;s obstinacy; French would later have a poor relationship with Kitchener during the First World War. Although he had been unimpressed by his handling of Paardeberg, he seems to have broadly welcomed his appointment as Commander-in-Chief, not least because he was not as opposed as Roberts to the &quot;arme blanche&quot;. In August 1900 Kitchener praised French to the Duke of York (later George V) and wrote to Roberts that French was &quot;quite first rate, and has the absolute confidence of all serving under him, as well as mine&quot;.

Kitchener wrote to Roberts praising French for the capture of Lotter&#x27;s commando, but by 17 January 1902 he wrote to Roberts &quot;French has not done much lately in the colony. I cannot make out why, the country is no doubt difficult but I certainly expected more.&quot; After meeting French at Nauuwport Kitchener recorded (14 February 1902) &quot;he was quite cheerful and happy about progress made, though it appears to me slow&quot;. Ian Hamilton, now Kitchener&#x27;s chief of staff, wrote that French was &quot;very much left to his own devices ... he was one of the few men that Kitchener had trusted to do a job on his own&quot;.

Kitchener later wrote of French &quot;his willingness to accept responsibility, and his bold and sanguine disposition have relieved me from many anxieties&quot;. Kitchener wrote of him to Roberts: &quot;French is the most thoroughly loyal, energetic soldier I have, and all under him are devoted to him—not because he is lenient, but because they admire his soldier-like qualities&quot;.

===War ends===
Roberts (now Commander-in-Chief of the Forces) ordered French to convene a committee to report on cavalry tactics; French accepted that cavalry should fight dismounted with firearms, but that they needed a better sword. French was appointed (23 October 1901) to command 1st Army Corps at Aldershot, in place of the disgraced Buller. French wrote to thank Roberts, to whose recommendation he guessed – correctly – that he owed the job, but also wrote to Buller, stressing that he had not been &quot;offered&quot; the position, but had been appointed to it by the King.

The report on cavalry tactics (8 November 1901) demanded an effective rifle for cavalry rather than the existing carbine, but only as a &quot;secondary&quot; weapon. Roberts ordered cavalry to give up their steel weapons for the duration of the campaign, over the protests of French. In early November 1901 French, who was by now reliant on methodical operations and excellent field Intelligence, was infuriated by Kitchener&#x27;s attempt to micromanage operations. In March French had expected the war to drag on until September 1902, but Kritzinger was captured in mid-November. The war ended at the start of June 1902, after over a month of negotiations. French and Lord Kitchener returned to Southampton on 12 July 1902, and received an enthusiastic welcome with thousands of people lining the streets of London for their procession. He was appointed a Knight Commander of the Order of St Michael and St George (KCMG) in recognition of his services in South Africa, an unusual award for a soldier. He also received honorary degrees from Oxford and Cambridge Universities and the freedom of a number of cities and livery companies.

==Edwardian period==
===Corps Commander, Aldershot===
French was promoted to permanent lieutenant-general for distinguished service in the field on 22 August 1902. In September 1902, he accompanied Lord Roberts and St John Brodrick, Secretary of State for War, to Germany to attend the German army maneuvers as guest of Emperor Wilhelm.

French took office as Commander of 1st Army Corps at Aldershot Command, from 15 September 1902. He attracted the attention of Lord Esher when he testified before the Elgin Commission. Esher reported to the King that he regarded French as the outstanding soldier of his generation, both as a field commander and a thinker. However, Balfour (Prime Minister) blocked French&#x27;s appointment to the Esher Committee.

French was proposed as a potential Chief of Staff in 1903–04. Esher wrote &quot;he has never failed&quot; while Admiral Fisher—who stressed French&#x27;s excellent record in South Africa, his skill as a judge of men, and his openness to army-navy operations—wrote &quot;plump for French and efficiency&quot;, although Fisher hoped that French would be an ally in opposing Army plans for deploying an expeditionary force to Europe. French&#x27;s appointment was—to his relief, as he did not relish having to fight with Arnold-Forster over his mooted reforms—vetoed by the king, who thought him too junior. Esher pressed Neville Lyttelton, who was appointed instead, to give French as free a hand as possible.

French had been insisting since January 1904 that, irrespective of what reforms the War Secretaries were pushing through, I Corps should be the Army&#x27;s main strike force with at least one of its divisions kept up to strength for service overseas, and managed to force his view through the Army Council in August 1904. French may have privately shared the doubts which others had about his intellectual capacity, but Esher wrote of him that his grasp of strategy and tactics broadened, and, although naturally gregarious, he became more aloof and solitary as he prepared himself for high command. In 1904 French urged the adoption of the 18 pounder field gun on Esher. He also recognised the importance of howitzers. At the 1904 Manoeuvres French commanded an &quot;invasion force&quot; which advanced inland from Clacton—many horses and supplies were lost, which apparently persuaded French that an enemy would find it hard to invade Britain successfully. In October 1904 French won Fisher&#x27;s approval with a paper on the strategic importance of the Dardanelles.

French threatened resignation unless his aide de camp Major Algy Lawson, who had not attended Staff College, was appointed Brigade-Major of the 1st Cavalry Brigade. He suspected a War Office plot led by the rising staff officers Henry Rawlinson and Henry Wilson, whom at this stage he distrusted. Despite being advised by Esher that this was not a sufficiently serious matter to justify such obstinacy, French got his way (December 1904) by threatening to appeal to the King. He also got his way over a similar matter involving Esher&#x27;s son Lt Maurice Brett, who served as French&#x27;s ADC, and on this occasion did approach the King&#x27;s secretary (February 1905).

French was given General Officer Commanding-in-Chief status at Aldershot on 1 June 1905. He was on the Committee of Imperial Defence in 1905, possibly because of his willingness to consider amphibious operations including at various times, in the Baltic and on the Belgian Coast. Philpott discusses French&#x27;s significant influence on pre-war strategic planning. He generally confined his advice to practical questions such as the difficulties of keeping horses at sea for long periods. French had a poor regard for staff officers and had poor relations with the general staff. At one meeting of the CID he became speechless with rage while listening to Lyttelton proposing that Egypt could be defended by warships in the Suez Canal.

On 19 December 1905 and 6 January 1906, as a result of the First Moroccan Crisis, French was one of a four-man committee convened by Esher to discuss war planning: the options were purely naval operations, an amphibious landing in the Baltic, or a deployment of an expeditionary force to France. At the second meeting French presented a plan for deployment to France or Belgium ten days after mobilisation, possibly mobilising on French territory to save time. Although French helped to draw up deployment plans as asked, it is not entirely clear from the surviving documents that he wholeheartedly supported such a commitment to France (&quot;WF&quot;—&quot;With France&quot;—as this scheme was known) until he was eventually persuaded by Henry Wilson, and he did not entirely rule out an amphibious landing in the Baltic. He also maintained an interest in a possible deployment to Antwerp.

French generally had good relation with Haldane, the new Secretary of State for War, but lobbied him against cutting two Guards battalions (the Liberals had been elected on a platform of retrenchment). In February 1906 French told Major-General Grierson (Director of Military Operations) that he was to be Commander-in-Chief of the BEF during the next war, with Grierson as his chief of staff. He had meetings with Grierson throughout March until the Moroccan crisis was resolved. French told the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; (12 May 1906) that a force of trained volunteers would deter an enemy invasion. In June 1906 French still believed that another war scare might come soon, and in July he attended French Army manoeuvres in Champagne, by which he was impressed, although he was less impressed by the Belgian Army. On this trip he was accused of giving unauthorised interviews to the French press, after uttering what Grierson called &quot;a few platitudes&quot; to the &quot;Figaro&quot; correspondent.

Haldane confirmed to Esher (26 September 1906) that French was to be Commander-in-Chief of the BEF during the next war. He visited France unofficially in November 1906 in an attempt to improve his French, although he never became fluent in the language. A Special Army Order of 1 January 1907 laid down that in the event of war Britain would send an Expeditionary force of six infantry and one cavalry division to assist the French. French was promoted to full general on 12 February 1907. In the summer of 1907 he entertained General Victor Michel, French Commander-in-Chief designate, at Aldershot to observe British manoeuvres.

===Cavalry controversy===
French testified to the Elgin Commission that cavalry should be trained to shoot but that the sword and lance should remain their main weapons. Hutton wrote to French that cavalry should retain some shock capacity but that the real issue was recruiting &quot;professional&quot; officers in place of the present aristocratic ones. French strongly disagreed, although he remained on friendly terms with Hutton and recognised that the expense of being a cavalry officer deterred many able young men. The Adjutant-General&#x27;s memorandum (10 March 1903) recommended the retention of the sword but not the lance. Haig&#x27;s heavily traditional &quot;Cavalry Training&quot; appeared in 1904, leaning heavily on the 1898 Cavalry Drill Book which he had helped French to write, although with a &quot;reforming&quot; preface by Roberts.

In response to a request from Arnold-Forster, French submitted a memorandum (7 March 1904) arguing that cavalry still needed to fight the old-fashioned way as a European War would begin with a &quot;great cavalry battle&quot;. He also sent a copy to the King. In response to Roberts&#x27; claim that he wanted to give cavalry the ability to act independently, French wrote in the margin that the campaigns of early 1900 &quot;had&quot; seen cavalry acting independently, although he replied politely that their differences were not as great as Roberts seemed to think. Roberts had the support of Kitchener (who thought cavalry should be able to seize and hold positions, but not to roam about the battlefield looking for enemy cavalry), but he was away as Commander-in-Chief, India. French&#x27;s memorandum was supported by Baden-Powell (Inspector-General of Cavalry), Sir Francis Grenfell (who commented that he had not spoken to any junior officer who agreed with Roberts) and by Evelyn Wood. In February 1905, after Roberts&#x27; removal as Commander-in-Chief, the Army Council authorised the publication of Haig&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry Training&quot; but without Roberts&#x27; preface, although the lance was declared abolished as a weapon of war—a decision ignored by French, who allowed his lancer regiments at Aldershot to carry the lance in field training.

The first edition of the &quot;Cavalry Journal&quot; appeared in 1906, promoted by C. S. Goldman, an admirer of French. It was put on an official basis in 1911. 
Lieutenant General Friedrich von Bernhardi&#x27;s &quot;Cavalry in Future Wars&quot; was published in 1906, with a preface by French, repeating his arguments that cold steel gave the cavalry moral superiority, and that the next war would see an opening clash of cavalry. French also claimed that Russian cavalry in the Russo-Japanese War had come off worse as they were too willing to fight dismounted—this was the opposite of the truth. The new edition of &quot;Cavalry Training&quot; in 1907 reaffirmed that cold steel was the main weapon of the cavalry. However, at the end of the 1908 Manoeuvres French criticised cavalry&#x27;s poor dismounted work, and—to Haig&#x27;s annoyance—declared that the rifle was cavalry&#x27;s main weapon. He also noted that infantry lacked a doctrine for the final stages of their attack, as they closed with the enemy—something which was to prove a problem in the middle years of the Great War. The lance was formally reinstated in June 1909. However, in his 1909 Inspection Report French again criticised cavalry&#x27;s poor dismounted work.

Although French believed that the &quot;cavalry spirit&quot; gave them an edge in action, his tendency to identify with his subordinates—in this case the cavalry, whose identity seemed under threat—and to take disagreements personally caused him to be seen as more of a reactionary than was in fact the case. In the event, cavalry would fight successfully in 1914: the &quot;cavalry spirit&quot; helped them to perform well on the Retreat From Mons, while they were still capable of fighting effectively on foot at First Ypres.

There was general agreement that the greater size of battlefields would increase the importance of cavalry. The publication of Erskine Childers&#x27; &quot;War and the Arme Blanche&quot; (1910) with a preface by Roberts went some way to reinstating the reformers&#x27; case. Childers argued that there had been only four real cavalry charges in South Africa, inflicting at most 100 casualties by cold steel, but acknowledged that French, &quot;our ablest cavalry officer&quot;, disagreed with him. However, in September 1913 the Army Council decreed that Mounted Infantry would not be used in future wars and the two existing Mounted Infantry brigades were broken up.

===Inspector-General of the Army===
After extensive lobbying by Esher, and with the King&#x27;s support, French was selected as Inspector-General of the Army in November 1907. Irish MP Moreton Frewen demanded – apparently in vain – a Court of Inquiry into French&#x27;s dismissal of his brother Stephen Frewen from command of the 16th Lancers during the Boer War, pointing out to Haldane that French was &quot;an adulterer convicted in a court of law&quot;. French was also appointed a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order in 1907.

French openly opposed conscription. He was generally supportive of the new Territorial Army, although he had some doubts about the effectiveness of Territorial Artillery. In 1907–08 he sat on a CID committee to consider the risk of German invasion—it was decided to retain two divisions at home as a deterrent to invasion, until the Territorial Force was ready. At the August 1908 manoeuvres, French&#x27;s poor report ended the military career of Harry Scobell, who commanded the Cavalry Division on the exercise, despite being well connected, a personal friend of French, and a successful commander from the South African campaigns. French&#x27;s reports showed great interest in trenches, machine guns and artillery. He also believed strongly that peacetime drill was necessary to prepare men for combat discipline. In the winter of 1908–09 French served on the &quot;Military Needs of the Empire&quot; sub-committee of the CID, which reaffirmed the commitment to France in the event of war. He was advanced to Knight Grand Cross of the Order of the Bath in 1909. French courted unpopularity with some infantry officers by urging a doubling in the size of infantry companies. In the winter of 1909–10 he toured British troops in the Far East, and in the summer of 1910 he inspected the Canadian Militia.

This period also saw the beginning of the feud between French and Smith-Dorrien, his successor at Aldershot. Smith-Dorrien annoyed French by insisting that cavalry improve their musketry, abolishing the pickets which trawled the streets for drunken soldiers, more than doubling the number of playing fields available, cutting down trees, and building new and better barracks. By 1910 the feud was common knowledge throughout the Army. Smith-Dorrien also objected to French&#x27;s womanising.
French was made an Aide-de-Camp General to the King on 19 June 1911. The Second Moroccan Crisis was occasion for French to push again for greater Army-Navy co-operation. On 23 August Henry Wilson carried a CID meeting with a lucid presentation of the Army&#x27;s plans for deployment to France; Admiral Wilson&#x27;s plans to land on the Baltic Coast were rejected. French spoke to the Navy Club that year on the need for co-operation. The autumn 1911 manoeuvres were cancelled, supposedly because of shortage of water but in reality because of the war scare. French accompanied Grierson and the French military attaché Victor Huguet to France for talks with de Castelnau, Assistant Chief of the French General Staff. On the journey, French talked of how Douglas and Paget would command armies under him in the event of war. Plans for British deployment were especially welcome as French war plans were in a state of flux, with Joffre having been appointed commander-in-chief designate on 28 July. After his return from France in 1911 French inspected German cavalry manoeuvres in Mecklenburg, and was summoned from his bath to receive the Order of the Red Eagle. On presenting him with a signed photograph of himself the Kaiser told him: &quot;You may have seen just how long my sword is: you may find it just as sharp&quot;.

In January 1912 French attended the annual staff conference at Staff College, and was impressed by the quality of the discussion. However, he lectured staff officers that they should not consider themselves the superiors of regimental officers, but that their job was to provide the commander with impartial advice and then endeavour to carry out his wishes.

===Chief of the Imperial General Staff===
He became Chief of the Imperial General Staff (&quot;CIGS&quot;—professional head of the Army) on 15 March 1912 although he neither had staff experience nor had studied at Staff College. On his first day, he told his three directors (Wilson—Director of Military Operations, Murray—Director of Military Training and Kiggell—Director of Staff Duties) that he intended to get the Army ready for war. French was receptive to Wilson&#x27;s wishes to explore co-operation with Belgium. French had initially been suspicious of Wilson as a Roberts protégé, but in 1906 had supported Wilson&#x27;s candidacy for Commandant of Staff College. By 1912 Wilson had become French&#x27;s most trusted adviser. On 8 November 1912, with the First Balkan War causing another war scare, Wilson helped French draw up a list of key officers for the Expeditionary Force: Haig and Smith-Dorrien were to command &quot;armies&quot;, Allenby the cavalry division, and Grierson was to be chief of staff.

In February 1913 Repington wrote a series of articles in &quot;The Times&quot; demanding conscription for home defence. The Prime Minister led the CID &quot;Invasion Inquiry&quot;, on which French sat. The conclusions, which were not reached until early 1914, were that two divisions should be retained at home, reducing the size of the BEF.

In April 1913, French told Wilson that he expected to serve as CIGS (extending his term by two years) until 1918, and to be succeeded by Murray. He was promoted to field marshal on 3 June 1913.

French&#x27;s efforts &quot;to get the Army ready for war&quot; were hampered by budgetary constraints, and he was unsuited by temperament or experience for the job. French caused controversy by passing over four generals for promotion in the autumn of 1913, and angered some infantry officers by forcing through the changes to infantry battalions so that they comprised four large companies commanded by majors rather than eight small companies commanded by captains. French lobbied Seely for an increase in pay and allowances for officers, to widen the social base from which officers were recruited—this was enacted from 1 January 1914.

In the summer of 1913 French, accompanied by Grierson and Wilson, again visited French manoeuvres in Champagne. After the September 1913 Manoeuvres Repington wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; that French had found it difficult to defeat even a skeleton army. Since 1904 French himself had to act as Director of the Annual Manoeuvres, so that although other officers had the chance to learn to handle divisions, he himself had little chance to learn to handle a force of &quot;several&quot; divisions. This lack of training may well have been factor in his poor performance in August 1914. The BEF senior officers (French, Haig, Wilson, Grierson and Paget who had replaced Smith-Dorrien by then) met to discuss strategy on 17 November 1913. In his diary Wilson praised &quot;Johnnie French&quot; for &quot;hitting out&quot; at the Royal Navy over their poor transport arrangements, but recorded his concerns at French&#x27;s lack of intellect and hoped there would not be a war just yet.

===Curragh incident===
With Irish Home Rule about to become law in 1914, the Cabinet were contemplating military action against the Ulster Volunteers (UVF) who wanted no part of it, and who were seen by many officers as loyal British subjects. In response to the King&#x27;s request for his views, French wrote that the army would obey &quot;the absolute commands of the King&quot;, but he warned that some might think &quot;that they were best serving their King and country either by refusing to march against the Ulstermen or by openly joining their ranks&quot;.

With political negotiations deadlocked and intelligence reports that the Ulster Volunteers (now 100,000 strong) might be about to seize the ammunition at Carrickfergus Castle, French only agreed to summon Paget (Commander-in-Chief, Ireland) to London to discuss planned troop movements when Seely (Secretary of State for War) repeatedly assured him of the accuracy of intelligence that UVF might march on Dublin. French did not oppose the deployment of troops in principle but told Wilson that the government were &quot;scattering troops all over Ulster as if it were a Pontypool coal strike&quot;. On 19 March French was summoned to an emergency meeting at 10 Downing Street with Asquith, Seely, Churchill (First Lord of the Admiralty), Birrell (Chief Secretary for Ireland) and Paget, where he was told that Carson, who had stormed out of a Commons debate, was expected to declare a provisional government in Ulster. French was persuaded by Asquith to send infantry to defend the artillery at Dundalk, and by Seely that a unionist coup was imminent in Ulster.

The result was the Curragh incident, in which Hubert Gough and other of Paget&#x27;s officers threatened to resign rather than coerce Ulster. French, advised by Haldane (Lord Chancellor) told the King on 22 March that he would resign unless Gough, who had confirmed that he would have obeyed a direct order to move against Ulster, was reinstated. French suggested to Seely that a written document from the Army Council might help to convince Gough&#x27;s officers. The Cabinet text stated that the Army Council were satisfied that the incident had been a misunderstanding, and that it was &quot;the duty of all soldiers to obey lawful commands&quot;, to which Seely added two paragraphs, stating that the Government had the right to use &quot;the forces of the Crown&quot; in Ireland or elsewhere, but had no intention of using force &quot;to crush opposition to the Home Rule Bill&quot;. Gough insisted on adding a further paragraph clarifying that the Army would not be used to enforce Home Rule &quot;on Ulster&quot;, to which French added in writing &quot;This is how I read it. JF CIGS&quot;.

Asquith publicly repudiated the &quot;peccant paragraphs&quot;. Wilson, who hoped to bring down the government, advised French to resign, as an officer could not be seen to break his word, even at the behest of politicians. Asquith at first wanted French to stay on as he had been &quot;so loyal and well-behaved&quot;, but then changed his mind despite French drawing up two statements with Haldane, claiming that he had been acting in accordance with Haldane&#x27;s statement in the House of Lords on 23 March. Seely also had to resign. French resigned on 6 April 1914.

French had been made to look naive and overly friendly to the Liberal government. Most officers were Conservative and Ulster Unionist sympathisers, but, with a few exceptions, took pride in their loyalty to the King and professed contempt for party politics. French for his part blamed Roberts for stirring up the Incident. After 1918 French became a Home Ruler, but at this stage he simply thought his duty to be ensuring that the Army obeyed the government&#x27;s orders.

French told Wilson that Asquith had promised him command of the BEF in the event of war, although nobody realised how quickly this would come. Margot Asquith wrote that he would soon be &quot;coming back&quot;, suggesting that Asquith may have promised to appoint French Inspector-General. Churchill described him as &quot;a broken-hearted man&quot; when he joined the trial mobilisation of the fleet in mid-July. French was still seen as a potential Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, although even in early August French himself was uncertain that he would be appointed.

==Commander-in-Chief, BEF==
===1914: BEF goes to war===
====Mobilisation and deployment====
The &quot;Precautionary Period&quot; for British mobilisation began on 29 July. French was summoned by Sir Charles Douglas (CIGS) and told he would command the British Expeditionary Force (BEF). British mobilisation began at 4 pm on 4 August, and Britain joined the war at midnight.

French attended the War Council at 10 Downing Street (5 August), and there presented the War Office plans (drawn up by Wilson) to send the BEF to Maubeuge, although he also suggested that as British mobilisation was lagging behind France&#x27;s it might be safer to send the BEF to Amiens. French also suggested that the BEF might operate from Antwerp against the German right flank, reflecting French&#x27;s reluctant acceptance of the continental commitment. This suggestion was dropped when Churchill said the Royal Navy could not guarantee safe passage. Kitchener, believing the war would be long, decided at Cabinet that the BEF would consist of only 4 infantry divisions (and 1 cavalry); French, believing the war would be short, demanded 5 infantry divisions but was overruled. Embarkation began on 9 August.

On 12 August, French, Murray, Wilson and the French liaison officer Victor Huguet met at French&#x27;s house and agreed to concentrate at Maubeuge, and after another meeting with Kitchener (who had had an argument with Wilson on 9 August—given Wilson&#x27;s influence over French, this served to worsen relations between French and Kitchener), who still preferred to concentrate further back at Amiens, they left to obtain the Prime Minister&#x27;s agreement.

French crossed to France on 14 August. President Poincaré, meeting French on 15 August, commented on his &quot;quiet manner ... not very military in appearance&quot;. French told Poincare that he would not be ready until 24 August, not 20 August as planned. French also met Messimy (French War Minister) and Joffre . Sir John&#x27;s orders from Kitchener were to co-operate with the French but not to take orders from them, and given that the tiny BEF (about 100,000 men, half of them regulars and half reservists) was Britain&#x27;s only army, to avoid undue losses and being exposed to &quot;forward movements where large numbers of French troops are not engaged&quot; until Kitchener had had a chance to discuss the matter with the Cabinet.

====Clash with Lanrezac====

The Siege of Liège ended when the last of the Belgian fortresses fell on 16 August and most of the remaining Belgian troops were soon besieged in Antwerp, opening Belgium to the German advance. Previously ardent and bombastic, French became hesitant and cautious, giving different answers about the date when the BEF could be expected to begin operations in the field.

French met General Charles Lanrezac, commanding the French Fifth Army on his right, at Rethel (17 August)—they were met by Lanrezac&#x27;s Chief of Staff Hely d&#x27;Oissel, with the words: &quot;At last you&#x27;re here: it&#x27;s not a moment too soon. If we are beaten we will owe it to you&quot;. They conferred in private despite the fact that Lanrezac spoke no English and Sir John could speak little French, Wilson being eventually called over to translate. French informed Lanrezac that his forces would not be ready until 24 August, three days later than promised. The French cavalry under André Sordet, which Sir John had previously asked Joffre in vain to be placed under his command, were further north trying to maintain contact with the Belgians. Sir John, concerned that he had only four infantry divisions rather than the planned six, wanted to keep Allenby&#x27;s cavalry division in reserve and refused Lanrezac&#x27;s request that he lend it for reconnaissance in front of the French forces. French and Lanrezac came away from the meeting with a poor relationship. At the time French wrote in his diary that Lanrezac was &quot;a very capable soldier&quot;, although he claimed otherwise in his memoirs &quot;1914&quot;. Besides their mutual dislike he believed Lanrezac was about to take the offensive, whereas Lanrezac had in fact been forbidden by Joffre to fall back and wanted the BEF moved back further to clear roads for a possible French retreat.

French&#x27;s friend General Grierson, GOC II Corps, had died suddenly and French returned to GHQ on 17 August, to find that Kitchener had appointed Lieutenant-General Sir Horace Smith-Dorrien to command, knowing that French disliked him, rather than Plumer (French&#x27;s choice) or Hamilton (who asked for it).

Spears arrived at GHQ (21 August) and reported to Wilson (French was out visiting Allenby) that Lanrezac did not want to leave his strong position and &quot;had declaimed at length on the folly of attack&quot;. Holmes believes French was receiving very bad advice from Wilson at this time, in spite of good air and cavalry intelligence of strong German forces. French set out for Lanrezac&#x27;s HQ (22 August) but by chance met Spears on the way, who told him that Lanrezac was in no position to attack after losses the previous day at the Battle of Charleroi, which Sir John did not quite believe and that Lanrezac was out at a forward command post. Brushing aside Spears&#x27; arguments that another meeting with Lanrezac would help, French cancelled his journey and returned to GHQ; &quot;relations with Lanrezac had broken down&quot;, writes Holmes, because Sir John saw no point in driving for hours, only to be insulted once again in a language he did not quite understand.

French was then visited again over dinner by Spears, who warned him that the BEF was now ahead of the main French line, exposing the BEF to potential encirclement. Spears was accompanied by George Macdonogh, who had deduced from air reconnaissance that the BEF was facing three German corps, one of which was moving around the BEF left flank. Sir John cancelled the planned advance. Also that evening a request arrived from Lanrezac, that the BEF attack the flank of the German forces which were attacking Fifth Army. French thought Lanrezac&#x27;s request unrealistic but agreed to hold his current position for another 24 hours.

====Mons====
Despite the events of the previous evening, French had—perhaps under the influence of Henry Wilson—reverted to the belief that an advance might again be possible soon. French&#x27;s and Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s accounts differ about the conference at 5.30 am on 23 August. French&#x27;s account in his memoirs &quot;1914&quot; stated that he had become doubtful of the advance and warned his officers to be ready to attack or retreat, which agrees largely with his own diary at the time, in which he wrote that he had warned Smith-Dorrien that the Mons position might not be tenable. When &quot;1914&quot; was published, Smith-Dorrien claimed that French had been &quot;in excellent form&quot; and had still been planning to advance. However, in his own memoirs, Smith-Dorrien admitted that French had talked of either attacking or retreating, although he claimed that it had been he who had warned that the Mons position was untenable. Edmonds in the &quot;Official History&quot; agreed that French had probably been prepared either to attack or to retreat.

French at first believed that the German attacks at Mons were merely trying to &quot;feel&quot; the British position and drove off to Valenciennes to inspect a French brigade. On his return he sent a letter to Lanrezac in which he talked of resuming the attack the following day. Wilson had &quot;calculated&quot; that the BEF was faced only by one German corps and a cavalry division, and was allowed to draw up orders for an attack the next day. Although Macdonogh warned that the BEF was faced by at least two German corps, French did not cancel the planned advance until a message from Joffre (7 pm) warned that he was faced by at least three German corps, although he still ordered Smith-Dorrien to try to hold his ground. At midnight Spears arrived with the news, which disgusted Sir John, that Lanrezac was falling back, and the French Third and Fourth Armies were also falling back after being defeated at Virton and Neufchateau. Murray summoned the Corps Chiefs of Staff at around 1 am on 24 August and ordered them to retreat. Even after Mons, French still thought that a deeper Allied thrust into Belgium would have disrupted the German advance.

Von Kluck sent von der Marwitz&#x27;s II Cavalry Corps (3 cavalry divisions) around the British west flank to prevent a British retreat on the Channel ports. Sir John French sent a message (24 August), with an unmistakable tone of pique, to Lanrezac, which Spears insisted on writing down, warning that the BEF might have to retreat southwest towards Amiens on its lines of communication, although it is unclear that this would actually have been practicable if the Germans had actually been moving in force around the British left flank. However, Sir John agreed to Joffre&#x27;s request that the BEF, now numbering 5 divisions as it had been joined by the 4th Infantry Division, would instead fall back on Cambrai if it had to, so that the BEF could still protect the French left flank. Joffre also sent a further two French reserve divisions to the British left flank, the beginning of the redeployment of French forces which would see Maunoury&#x27;s Sixth Army form around Amiens and then fight near Paris. French considered, but rejected, the option of sheltering the BEF in the fortified town of Maubeuge, partly out of instinct that the Germans were hoping to tempt him into allowing himself to be besieged there and partly because he remembered that Edward Hamley had likened Bazaine allowing himself to be besieged in Metz in 1870 to a shipwrecked man taking hold of the anchor. French himself issued no direct written orders between 11.15 pm on 21 August and 8.25 pm on 24 August; Terraine argued that this, along with his absence during the battle of Mons (although on the German side von Kluck also played little direct role in the battle), marks the point when he and GHQ began to disengage from active command of the BEF, leaving Smith-Dorrien and Haig in effective control of their corps.

===1914: Retreat to the Marne===
====Le Cateau====
GHQ moved back from Le Cateau to St Quentin on 25 August. French had a long discussion with Murray and Wilson (25 August) as to whether the BEF should stand and fight at Le Cateau. Wilson and Murray were concerned about the risk of encirclement from the left. Sir John did not agree but wanted to fall back as agreed with Joffre, and hoped that the BEF could pull out and refit behind the River Oise. Besides concern for his men, he was also worried that he was exposing his small force to the risk of destruction which Kitchener had forbidden. Wilson ordered Smith-Dorrien to retreat from Le Cateau the next day.

French was awakened at 2 am on 26 August with news that Haig&#x27;s I Corps was under attack at Landrecies, and ordered Smith-Dorrien to assist him. Smith-Dorrien replied that he was &quot;unable to move a man&quot;. French was woken again at 5 am with the news that Smith-Dorrien had decided to stand and fight at Le Cateau. Insisting that the exhausted Murray not be woken, French telegraphed back that he still wanted Smith-Dorrien to &quot;make every endeavour&quot; to fall back but that he had &quot;a free hand as to the method&quot;, which Smith-Dorrien took as permission to make a stand. On waking properly, French ordered Wilson to telephone Smith-Dorrien and order him to break off as soon as possible.

French and his staff believed that the Cavalry Division had been completely destroyed at Le Cateau (it had in fact suffered no more than 15 casualties) and that 5th Division had lost nearly all its guns, destroying II Corps as a fighting unit (in fact units reassembled after the retreat). French later told Haig that he should have had Smith-Dorrien court-martialled after Le Cateau. In his memoirs French later claimed that Smith-Dorrien had risked destruction of his corps and lost 14,000 men and 80 guns (actual losses of each were around half of this number). However, it has also been argued that the vigorous defensive action at Le Cateau relieved the pressure and allowed the troops to re-organise and make a fighting withdrawal.

On the morning of 26 August, while the Battle of Le Cateau was in progress, Sir John had a hostile meeting with Joffre and Lanrezac at St Quentin. This meeting, held at Joffre&#x27;s insistence, was the second and last time Sir John met Lanrezac, who attended only reluctantly. He complained of Lanrezac&#x27;s behaviour, to which Lanrezac &quot;merely shrugged&quot; and gave a vague and academic reply. Joffre talked of his &quot;Instruction Generale No 2&quot; which talked of a new French Sixth Army forming around Amiens, but although this had been received by GHQ during the night French had not been shown it. French insisted that he must retreat further, although he agreed to press Kitchener to send the remaining British division bringing the BEF up to six infantry divisions, to France rather than to Belgium. Joffre stayed for lunch (Lanrezac declined to do so), at which the atmosphere improved as he confessed that he too was dissatisfied with Lanzerac. Joffre was surprised at the &quot;rather excited tone&quot; in which Sir John criticised Lanrezac, unlike his calm demeanour of a few days&#x27; earlier, and came away deeply concerned at the obvious personal friction between French and Lanrezac, but also at Sir John&#x27;s reluctance to stand and fight.

====Retreat====
GHQ fell back to Noyon (26 August). Huguet reported to Joffre that the British had been defeated at Le Cateau and would need French protection to recover cohesion; he also reported that although the BEF&#x27;s fighting spirit was undaunted, the British &quot;Government&quot; might order the BEF to retreat to Le Havre. Colonel Brecard, another liaison officer attached to the British staff, reported that two out of the five British divisions were destroyed and that, in Wilson&#x27;s view, the BEF would need a week to refit. Sir John warned Huguet that there would be &quot;bitterness and regret&quot; in England over British losses, and Joffre, who had decided to order an attack by Fifth Army to take the pressure off the BEF, visited Sir John at Noyon on 27 August and gave him a message congratulating the BEF for its efforts protecting Fifth Army&#x27;s flank. In fact Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s staff were making intense efforts to hold II Corps together, although at a meeting (held at 2 am on 27 August, as Smith-Dorrien had found GHQ&#x27;s present location with great difficulty) French accused him of being overly optimistic. GHQ moved back to Compiegne on 28 August, although Sir John was able to visit his troops on the march for the first time since 25 August, telling men who were resting on the ground of Joffre&#x27;s message.

French refused Haig permission to join in an attack by Lanrezac, who wrote of French&#x27;s &quot;bad humour and cowardice&quot;. Even Spears felt Sir John was in the wrong here. The BEF also did not join in Lanrezac&#x27;s attack on German Second Army at Guise (29 August). Joffre, who had spent the morning with Lanrezac, was concerned by rumours that the BEF might retreat towards the Channel Ports. He visited French in the afternoon, urging him to hold his place in the line promising that Russian successes would soon allow the Allies to attack. However, French insisted that his forces needed 48 hours of absolute rest, and Murray, whom Joffre noticed had been tugging at French&#x27;s tunic throughout this, then showed an intelligence report of the strength of the German forces facing the BEF. After Joffre had departed in bad humour, French received an incorrect report that Fifth Army was falling back behind the Oise, and issued orders for the BEF to fall back to Rethondes-Soissons; when he received fresh reports that the French were holding their positions after all he replied that it was too late to cancel his orders. Sir John&#x27;s opinion of Lanrezac was so low that he did not believe reports of his success at Guise (29 August) until he had sent Seely to interview the French corps commanders.

The BEF was doing little fighting on 29 August and on 30 August had no contact with the enemy at all, and on that day III Corps (4th Division and 19th Infantry Brigade) became operational under Pulteney. On 31 August the BEF engaged in only a few minor cavalry skirmishes. Losses had indeed been high by Boer War standards, and Sir John, believing them to be greater than they were, and that the Kaiser was making an especial effort to destroy the BEF, believed he was carrying out the &quot;letter and spirit&quot; of Kitchener&#x27;s instructions to avoid undue loss without Cabinet authority.

====Meeting with Kitchener====
Spears later wrote of French&#x27;s coolness and calmness on 30 August, although he also recorded that French no longer took much interest in matters unless they directly impinged on the BEF. Nonetheless a few hours after a meeting with Joffre, Sir John telegraphed him that the BEF would have to leave the line entirely and retreat behind the Seine for up to ten days to refit, tracing supply from St Nazaire and moving the forward base to Le Mans rather than Amiens. Kitchener heard of these plans from the Inspector-General of Communications, and when he demanded an explanation (Sir John&#x27;s previous messages had been optimistic) French sent a long telegram saying he had told Joffre that the BEF was unable to remain in the front line and that he wanted the BEF to move back behind the Seine, and that would take eight days if done at a pace which would not fatigue the troops unduly. He added (contradicting himself somewhat) that he would have preferred Joffre to resume the offensive, but that Joffre was giving the BEF&#x27;s inability to join in as a reason for not doing so. He thought that the French Army had &quot;defective higher leading&quot;.

On 31 August Sir John received messages from Joffre and President Poincare (relayed via Bertie, the British Ambassador) asking him not to withdraw. Joffre pointed out that the Germans were already shifting forces to the East. Kitchener demanded further details, and after showing French&#x27;s previous message to the Cabinet telegraphed again warning that it was the manner and length of the retreat which concerned the Cabinet. Sir John then replied that the &quot;shattered condition&quot; of II Corps had reduced his offensive capability and that the BEF could not withstand an attack by so much as a single German corps. He wrote: &quot;I do not see why I should again be called upon to run the risk of absolute disaster in order a second time to save (the French).&quot; He also argued that the best solution would be for the French to counterattack and so &quot;close the gap by uniting their inward flanks&quot;, although he agreed to halt at Nanteuil, which he expected the BEF to reach the following day, if the French halted their own retreat. Kitchener, authorised by a midnight meeting of whichever Cabinet Ministers could be found, left for France for a meeting on 1 September.

They met, together with Viviani (French Prime Minister) and Millerand (now French War Minister). Huguet recorded that Kitchener was &quot;calm, balanced, reflective&quot; while Sir John was &quot;sour, impetuous, with congested face, sullen and ill-tempered&quot;. On Bertie&#x27;s advice, Kitchener dropped his intention of inspecting the BEF. They moved to a separate room, and no independent account of the meeting exists. French admitted that Kitchener had taken exception to his tone and that he had assured him that this was simply in his mind. In his diary Sir John wrote &quot;we had rather a disagreeable time. I think K found he was making a mistake&quot;. In &quot;1914&quot; French later claimed that he had told Kitchener that although he valued his he would not tolerate any interference in his executive authority so long as he remained in command, and that they &quot;finally came to an amicable understanding&quot;. Terraine dismisses as absurd Sir John&#x27;s later claims that he resented being called away from GHQ (given that no battle was in progress, and that he had played little directing part in either of the two battles fought so far), and that an inspection of the BEF (by Kitchener, Britain&#x27;s most celebrated soldier at the time) might have disheartened the men by the implied challenge to French&#x27;s authority. Terraine suggests that Sir John was more anxious to prevent Kitchener from inspecting the BEF as he might have seen for himself that they were less &quot;shattered&quot; than he claimed, and that Haig and Smith-Dorrien might have criticised him if given a chance to speak privately to Kitchener. After the meeting Kitchener telegraphed the Cabinet that the BEF would remain in the line, although taking care not to be outflanked, and told French to consider this &quot;an instruction&quot;. French had a friendly exchange of letters with Joffre.

French had been particularly angry that Kitchener had arrived wearing his Field Marshal&#x27;s uniform. This was how Kitchener normally dressed at the time, but French felt that Kitchener was implying that he was his military superior and not simply a cabinet member. Tuchman argued that French was particularly conscious of this, as he was known for his own quirks of dress. At Asquith&#x27;s behest Churchill attempted to act as mediator, exchanging letters with French (4 September), who replied that Kitchener was &quot;a fine organiser but he never was and he never will be a Commander in the field&quot;. By the end of the year, his hostility had become common knowledge at GHQ and GQG. In &quot;1914&quot; French claimed that Kitchener had come to Paris to try to stop him retreating, which was untrue—it was the manner of the retreat, without consultation with Britain&#x27;s allies, which was the problem.

On 1 September, while French and Kitchener were meeting, the British fought a small engagement at Néry. The gap between I and II Corps was finally closed for the first time since 25 August, but GHQ had to be evacuated from Dammartin in a hurry under threat from German cavalry, General Macready being left behind in the confusion and General Robertson having to hastily wrap up in newspaper a leg of mutton he had been about to eat.

====Sir John agrees to fight====
French was pleased at Lanrezac&#x27;s dismissal (3 September), thinking at first that he had been arrested, and his Military Secretary reported to the King that &quot;the fat pompous political general&quot; had been sacked. Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, Lanzerac&#x27;s successor, immediately sent a telegram to Sir John signed &quot;Franchet d&#x27;Esperey KCVO&quot; promising co-operation.

On return to GHQ, now at Melun, from visits to troops, including a talk with Haig who agreed with him that the troops needed rest and replacements (4 September) he found his staff had agreed to two plans. Murray had been visited by Gallieni (Military Governor of Paris) and Maunoury (French Sixth Army, and currently under Gallieni&#x27;s command) and had drawn up plans for an attack suggested by them. Wilson, on Sir John&#x27;s orders, had travelled to meet Franchet d&#x27;Esperey and had agreed to the plan which became the basis for Joffre&#x27;s &quot;Instruction Generale No 6&quot;. Gallieni was still planning, with Joffre&#x27;s initial agreement, to attack south, not north, of the Marne, so the result of Murray&#x27;s orders was that the BEF should fall back another day&#x27;s march, putting it 15 miles south of where Joffre wanted it to be for his new plan. Sir John at first intended to study the situation before making up his mind.

Joffre sent a copy of his plan to GHQ and asked Millerand to lobby the British Government. Hearing at last that Sir John was willing to co-operate, Joffre arrived for a meeting with French on 5 September. According to Spears&#x27; account, he explained his plan (in French), ending by clasping his hands together tightly enough to hurt them and begging &quot;&quot; (&quot;Field Marshal, France is begging you&quot;). Sir John cried and, unable to find the words in French, replied &quot;Damn it, I can&#x27;t explain. Tell him that all that men can do our fellows will do&quot;. When Murray protested that the BEF could not be ready as soon as Joffre hoped, Joffre replied that Sir John&#x27;s word was good enough for him. Joffre believed at the time that the BEF were technically under his orders and that French&#x27;s uncooperativeness was because the British government were too weak to insist that he obey orders. French was conscious that he was Joffre&#x27;s senior in rank and had more combat experience.

====Marne and Aisne====
The BEF advanced to take part in the First Battle of the Marne on the morning of 6 September, Sir John&#x27;s mood marred by a telegram from Kitchener urging him to co-operate with Joffre. This was the result of Joffre&#x27;s appeal to Millerand, and Joffre repaired the damage by praising the performance of French and the BEF to Kitchener. The BEF began its advance from 20 km behind where Joffre had wanted it. Franchet d&#x27;Esperey, to the right of the BEF, was repeatedly demanding a quicker advance, and at 3.30 pm Sir John ordered Haig (I Corps, on the BEF right) to resume his advance, but by nightfall Haig was still 12 km away from his objective, having lost only 7 men killed and 44 wounded. The BEF advanced further on 7 September. Lord Ernest Hamilton recorded that &quot;in the strict sense there was no battle ... the fighting ... was desultory&quot;. Charteris, Haig&#x27;s intelligence adviser, thought the advance &quot;absurdly slow&quot; and noted that the cavalry moved &quot;behind&quot; the infantry. When the BEF reached the Petit Morin on 8 September, Marwitz&#x27;s German cavalry broke off and retreated further, only for the BEF to halt because of a heavy thunderstorm. Joffre urged that it was &quot;essential&quot; that the BEF advance further. By 8 September, despite outnumbering the enemy by 10:1, the BEF had advanced just 40 km in three days.

On 9 September Sir John, arriving on the spot in person, ordered I Corps to halt as soon as they had reached the main road, a mere 5 miles from the river (at midday Haig, who had halted for four hours after crossing the river after seeing aerial reconnaissance of German forces opposite him, had just given orders to resume the advance). This prevented I Corps from taking Kraewel&#x27;s detachment from the east flank, which would have helped II Corps, which had halted after encountering a mixed brigade at Montreuil-sur-Lions, and was now fighting uphill through woods. On the left Pulteney&#x27;s engineers did not have enough pontoons to cross the Marne, and by nightfall half of 4th Division&#x27;s battalions crossed on a makeshift floating bridge. The cavalry (&quot;Gough&#x27;s Command&quot; on the left flank, Allenby&#x27;s 1st Cavalry Division on the right, each maintaining contact with the adjacent French forces) was in Hew Strachan&#x27;s words &quot;entirely out of the equation&quot;. Sewell Tyng notes that the BEF had &quot;exercised no effective intervention&quot; in the battle and &quot;remained no more than a threat which was never translated into decisive action&quot;, although Herwig points out that the men were exhausted after the long retreat, that the French cavalry performed no better and yet the advance – into the gap between the German First and Second Armies – had a decisive effect on the German commanders.

Sir John initially thought that the enemy was only &quot;making a determined stand&quot; on the Aisne. He urged the importance of entrenching wherever possible and stressed that heavy artillery would be necessary going forward.

===1914: Autumn battles===
====Race to the Sea====
After lobbying by Churchill, who was keen to bring the Channel Ports under British control, and by Wilson, French lobbied Joffre (27 September) for the BEF, which was less heavily gunned and more mobile than a similarly-sized French Army, to disengage and try to move around the Allied left flank, part of the outflanking movements known as the Race to the Sea. Joffre agreed in principle, although he had private doubts about having no French troops between the BEF and the sea and later came to believe that this move had, by using up scarce rail capacity for ten days, prevented him from reinforcing Lille and had allowed the Germans to capture it.

Throughout September and October 1914 French warned Kitchener that his forces were running dangerously short of shells, at one point being rationed to 20 rounds per gun per day. French was impressed by the first 9.2-inch howitzers, but very conscious of German artillery superiority. French took a keen interest in the development of mortars and grenades, although during his time as Commander-in-Chief more were produced at the BEF&#x27;s own workshops than in the UK. He also pressed the War Office for more machine guns, believing that a battalion needed at least six or seven (as opposed to two at the start of the war).

The Germans opened fire on the Antwerp outer forts (28 September) and over the opposition of French and Joffre the British 7th Division was earmarked for Antwerp (1 October) instead of for the BEF. French, who did not get on with Rawlinson, was once again suspicious that Kitchener was attempting to usurp operational control of the BEF.

After a temporary stay in Abbéville for five days, GHQ was established in St Omer (13 October) where it was to remain for the rest of French&#x27;s tenure. When asked to help shore up the Belgian line on his left French said (16 October 1914) &quot;he would be d——d if he would be dictated to by Foch who had better mind his own business&quot;.

====First Ypres====
French had thought in mid-October of establishing an &quot;entrenched camp&quot; large enough to hold the entire BEF around Boulogne, but was soon persuaded by Foch and Wilson to move around the German flank towards Roulers. The following day he ordered Rawlinson to move on Menin (southeast of Ypres) and Haig&#x27;s I Corps to move on Roulers (northeast of Ypres), despite reports that there were at least 3 German corps facing Haig. Sir John had believed the Germans were running out of men (19 October), but instead the BEF ran into German forces also trying to turn the Allied flank. At a meeting on 21 October Joffre refused to lend him enough men to construct a fortified camp around Boulogne; Joffre instead ordered a French corps to the BEF&#x27;s left, and French ordered the BEF to hold its positions.

French at first reported to Kitchener that the German attacks by Fourth and Sixth Armies were their &quot;last card&quot; and the BEF were holding them off. He was unimpressed by Smith-Dorrien telling him (midnight on 25 October) that his Corps &quot;might go during the night&quot;, although he did send reinforcements. Generals Macdonogh and Radcliffe later testified to the Official Historian Edmonds in the early 1920s that French &quot;believed what he wished to believe&quot; and &quot;never could believe that the Germans were not at their last gasp&quot;. He thought &quot;everything was going splendidly&quot; and &quot;the Germans were exhausted&quot; until warned of the arrival of German reinforcements, at which point he (allegedly) grew angry and banged his fist on the table shouting &quot;How do you expect me to carry out my campaign if you carry on bringing up these blasted divisions?&quot;

Falkenhayn now ordered a new attack south of Ypres, between Gheluveld and Ploegsteert Wood, by &quot;Army Group Fabeck&quot;. IV Corps was broken up (27 October) and Rawlinson and his staff sent home to supervise the arrival of 8th Division. French still expected to attack, turning the German western flank, on 29 October, and even after the Germans had pressed I Corps hard SE of Ypres that day (he later claimed in &quot;1914&quot; to have realised that the BEF could now do no more than hold its ground, but he, in fact, issued orders for the flanking attack to go ahead on 30 October). Sir John supervised the arrangement of reinforcements from Smith-Dorrien and Dubois&#x27; French corps to Haig&#x27;s and Allenby&#x27;s hard pressed forces at Ypres (30 October). Once again, the British planned to counterattack, but French was roused from his sleep (12.30 am on 31 October) by Foch, who warned him that his staff had spotted a gap in the British lines at Hollebeke Chateau; Foch advised him to &quot;hammer away, keep on hammering&quot; and promised to send a further eight French battalions and three batteries. Sir John spent the crisis day of 31 October visiting Allenby and Gough, and was with Haig when they learned that a single battalion of the Worcesters had retaken Gheluveld (&quot;The Worcesters saved the Empire&quot; French later wrote). He then met Foch at the town hall at Ypres to warn him that he had no more reserves apart from &quot;the sentries at his gate&quot;—the next day (1 November) Haig&#x27;s I Corps held its ground, with cooks, grooms and drivers pressed into the line, and aided by French counterattacks which drew off German reserves. The line stabilised, although there was a final day of crisis on 11 November.

The fighting at Ypres, the last before major trenching began, destroyed the last of the original BEF. Since the outbreak of war the BEF had suffered 90,000 casualties, 58,000 of them in October and November, compared to an initial infantry strength (the first seven divisions) of 84,000. Of those who had landed in August, an average of one officer and thirty men per battalion remained. French was particularly disturbed at the lack of company commanders, and extremely reluctant to send trained officers and NCOs home to train the New Armies.

====Possible dismissal====
Sir John was unable to get away during the Battle of Ypres to attend the Dunkirk conference (1 November) between Kitchener and Joffre, Foch and Millerand. There Kitchener offered to replace French with Ian Hamilton, but Joffre declined, saying this would be bad for BEF morale and he worked &quot;well and cordially&quot; with Sir John. Foch told Wilson of this on 5 November) French sent Captain Freddy Guest to complain to the Prime Minister, who refused to believe it, and both Asquith and Churchill wrote French reassuring letters. French went to see Foch (6 November) to thank him for his &quot;comradeship and loyalty&quot;. This did not stop him writing to Kitchener on 15 November that &quot;, they are a low lot, and one always has to remember the class these French generals come from&quot;. French talked of inciting H. A. Gwynne to start a press campaign against Kitchener.

Over lunch on 21 November Haig noted that French looked unwell—French told him he thought he had had a heart attack and had been ordered to rest by his doctors. The King visited France (30 November – 5 December) and passed on his concerns that the Germans were about to invade Britain with 250,000 men, a rumour which French assumed to have been concocted by Kitchener. French&#x27;s aides made inquiries—apparently in vain—about an increase in &quot;table money&quot; (expenses for entertaining visiting dignitaries) on top of his official salary of £5,000 per annum.

====End of 1914====
In late November and early December the Germans moved forces to the East, and French expected the Russians to defeat them soon. In December he offered limited assistance to French attacks, out of affection for Foch and fear that Joffre would otherwise complain to Kitchener, and despite his concerns that the ground on Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s front was too wet. Foch said of French (8 December 1914) &quot;How he likes to cry, this Baby&quot;.

The Foreign Office (9 December) formally asked the French government for the BEF to move to the coast where it could co-operate with the Royal Navy and the Belgian Army, but this was rejected by Millerand on Joffre&#x27;s advice, and Foch regarded the plan &quot;with the greatest contempt&quot;, although on a visit to GHQ (11 December) he found Sir John only mildly in favour. A German counterattack (20 December) mauled the Indian Corps, who could not handle the cold, so badly that they had to be pulled into reserve.

French was still dissatisfied with Murray&#x27;s performance as BEF Chief of Staff, but Asquith and Kitchener (20 December) forbade him to replace Murray with Wilson. The BEF was split into Haig&#x27;s First Army (I, IV and Indian Corps) and Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s Second Army (II and III Corps and 27th Division), effective 25 December. Allenby&#x27;s Cavalry Corps and Rimington&#x27;s Indian Cavalry Corps continued to report directly to French.

At the Chantilly Conference (27 December 1914) French agreed with Joffre that the British Cabinet was mad. They discussed the relative merits of shrapnel and high-explosive shell, and events on the Eastern Front. Joffre told Sir John of his plans for twin offensives at Arras and Rheims in 1915, the former offensive to be assisted by the BEF, and then a further thrust towards the Rhine from Verdun and Nancy. He agreed that the British could take over line up to the coast but only as further reinforcements arrived, which would not be until much later in 1915.

===1915: Neuve Chapelle===
====Deployment of the New Armies====
French had hoped to incorporate the Belgian Army into the BEF, but the King of the Belgians vetoed this. French instead demanded that the New Armies be sent out as battalions and incorporated into existing units. All the senior commanders agreed that to have the New Armies fighting under their own inexperienced division and corps staff would be folly.

French was further irritated by an &quot;incomprehensible&quot; letter from Kitchener (2 January) stating that no more troops should remain on the Western Front than were necessary to hold the line, and seeking GHQ&#x27;s views as to which other theatres British troops should be redeployed. French replied that given sufficient resources he could break the German front, that to attack Turkey would be &quot;to play the German game&quot; and that he preferred an advance into Serbia via Salonika, or preferably an attack to clear the Belgian Coast, and that if Russia collapsed the government would have no choice but to send all available troops to France. French also had Murray hand-deliver a copy of this letter to the Prime Minister, earning French a rebuke from Kitchener for not using the normal channels of communication.

The War Council (7–8 January) discussed French&#x27;s demand that 50 Territorial or New Army battalions be sent to France, but in the face of Kitchener&#x27;s strong opposition it was agreed instead to examine the possibilities of other fronts. French, having sent Wilson and Murray on ahead to raise support, himself lobbied the War Council (13 January), informing them that he expected only 5,000–8,000 casualties in his forthcoming offensive, and that the Germans were short of manpower and would have reached the end of their resources by November 1915. Although he expected Joffre&#x27;s offensives in 1915 to be successful, he &quot;relied on the Russians to finish the business&quot;. Kitchener agreed, but the War Council was then swayed by Churchill arguing for an attack on the Dardanelles, and it was agreed to send French only two Territorial Divisions by mid-February.

The mooted Flanders Offensive was then cancelled altogether after further lobbying of Kitchener by Joffre and Millerand. Sir John agreed to relieve two French corps north of Ypres to allow Joffre to build up French reserves for his own offensive. Murray was sent off sick for a month (24 January) and French demanded his resignation. Robertson replaced him.

====Argument with Joffre====
At the War Council in London (9 February) French learned that the regular 29th Division was to be sent to the Near East rather than to France as he had been promised. French opposed this transfer, but his advice was not adopted. Sir John believed that the Russian withdrawals were &quot;only a strategic move&quot; designed to overextend the Germans. He ordered Haig to prepare for an attack at Aubers Ridge, rather than an attack by Smith-Dorrien at Messines-Wytschaete Ridge, as he had more confidence in both Haig and his troops than he had in Smith-Dorrien. GHQ then learned that Joffre wanted de Maud&#x27;huy&#x27;s French Tenth Army to attack at Vimy, with which attack Haig was ordered to co-ordinate his efforts.

Joffre wrote a letter of complaint that the BEF might not be carrying out Sir John&#x27;s promise to take over more line; in reply French summoned the liaison officer Victor Huguet to complain of Joffre&#x27;s claims that the British had &quot;demanded&quot; French participation in the offensive. When he had calmed down he sent Robertson and Wilson to smooth things over with Joffre. Even so, Joffre was angered by French&#x27;s formal reply and thought that he ought to be able to carry out the planned relief as he was receiving the 46th (Territorial) Division. Millerand wrote to Kitchener to complain, enclosing another letter of complaint from Joffre. Kitchener forwarded both letters to Sir John, along with a letter of complaint of his own. Joffre thought French a &quot;liar&quot; and &quot;a bad comrade&quot;.

====Neuve Chapelle====
French genuinely hoped for a breakthrough at Neuve Chapelle (10–12 March 1915) and personally briefed the cavalry commanders Allenby and Rimington beforehand, although, aware of the effect of modern firepower on cavalry, he cautioned Rimington against getting too close to the enemy. He believed that victory would prove to Kitchener that British efforts should be concentrated on the Western Front, and that it would be merely a prelude to a much larger Battle of Lille. French moved to a forward headquarters at Hazebrouck during the battle.

A renewed attack was planned for 22 March, but French was told by Lieutenant-General Maxwell (Quartermaster General) that sufficient shell was available only for a bombardment half the intensity of Neuve Chapelle, and he was warned by du Cane of defective fuses causing guns to explode (14 March). To some extent the shell shortage was an excuse, as French was also critical of planning errors in First Army&#x27;s attack. Kitchener told Asquith (18 March) that French was &quot;not really a scientific soldier; a good capable leader in the field, but without adequate equipment and expert knowledge for the huge task of commanding 450,000 men.&quot;

French&#x27;s almost daily letters to his mistress in 1915 reveal his wish to see Kitchener sacked, his concern at lack of high explosive shells, his ambivalent relations with the French (although sympathetic at the political interference which French generals suffered), his anger (shared with many other Western Front generals) at the way scarce men and shells were being sent to Gallipoli, and his belief that the German advance into Russia in 1915 would ultimately fail; he hoped that Germany would sue for peace by the summer of 1915 or spring 1916.

===1915: Aubers Ridge and shells scandal===
Joffre renewed negotiations for an Anglo-French offensive in Artois, and again asked Sir John to relieve the two French corps north of Ypres. He agreed to do so by 20 April. French breakfasted with Kitchener (31 March) who told him that he and Joffre were &quot;on ... trial&quot; over the next five weeks, and that the Allied governments would reinforce other theatres unless they made &quot;substantial advances&quot; and &quot;br[oke] the German line&quot;. There were rumours in both British and French circles, probably baseless, that Kitchener coveted French&#x27;s job for himself. French also objected to rumours that Joffre was trying to put the BEF under Foch&#x27;s command. By April 1915 the BEF had grown to 900,000 men. French continued to be dissatisfied at Smith-Dorrien&#x27;s grip on his army and in March was concerned that the rate of sickness was running at three times the rate in Second Army as in First.

The Germans attacked (22 April) ground which Smith-Dorrien had recently taken over from the French, using poison gas, causing some French units to break on the British flank. Sir John spurred on Smith-Dorrien in costly counterattacks, but thought the French had made &quot;a horrible mistake&quot; and &quot;Joffre ... really deceived me&quot; in holding the line so thinly. Sir John was angry (26 April 1915) that French troops had broken under German gas attack, commenting that French troops had also failed to hold their positions in the retreat of 1914. Smith-Dorrien suggested withdrawing to the so-called &quot;GHQ Line&quot;. French privately agreed, but was angered that the suggestion came from Smith-Dorrien. Plumer was the given responsibility for the Ypres Salient (27 April). Smith-Dorrien was finally relieved of command of Second Army (6 May).

On 2 May French, who appears to have persuaded himself that a short sharp bombardment might work once again, assured Kitchener that &quot;the ammunition will be all right&quot;, a declaration which Kitchener passed on to Asquith. This caused Asquith to claim in a public speech that there was no munitions shortage in the BEF. The attack at Aubers Ridge, against stronger German positions (9 May), failed. French watched the battle from a ruined church and attributed the failure to lack of HE shelling. He returned to GHQ to find an order to send shells to Gallipoli, although after protest replacement shells were sent from the UK within days. Fighting still continued at Ypres, and Sir John was under pressure from Joffre to renew the attack at Aubers Ridge. Although he would have preferred (10 May) to stand on the defensive until more high explosive was available, he agreed to Joffre&#x27;s pressure to take over more French line and renew the attack.

====Shells Scandal====

After Aubers Ridge Repington sent a telegram to &quot;The Times&quot; blaming lack of high explosive shell, which despite being heavily censored by Macdonogh was printed after Brinsley Fitzgerald assured him Sir John would approve. French had, despite Repington&#x27;s denial of his prior knowledge at the time, supplied Repington with information, and Fitzgerald and Freddie Guest were sent to London to show the same documents to Lloyd George and the Opposition leaders Bonar Law and Balfour. Repington&#x27;s article appeared in &quot;The Times&quot; (14 May 1915). Kitchener wrote to French that day that Repington should not be allowed out with the Army, to which French replied that Repington was a personal friend and he (French) &quot;really ha(d) no time to attend to these matters&quot;.

Kitchener, reluctant to deploy the volunteer New Armies to the Western Front, wired French (16 May 1915) that he would send no more reinforcements to France until he was clear the German line could be broken, although at the end of May he agreed to send two divisions to keep Joffre happy. The King wrote of French at this time to his uncle the Duke of Connaught: &quot;I don&#x27;t think he is particularly clever and he has an awful temper&quot; (23 May 1915). Another offensive at Festubert began on the night of 15–16 May and dragged on until 27 May. Some ground was gained (1,000 yards over a 3,000 front) and the Germans had to rush in reserves. French was still optimistic that with sufficient high explosive a breakthrough for cavalry could be achieved. Whigham (BEF Sub-Chief of Staff) &quot;was very sick as (at French&#x27;s behest) he had to cancel &amp; then rewrite his orders&quot; (Wilson Diary 27 May 1915).

The shells scandal contributed to the fall of the Liberal Government. Although French&#x27;s involvement was widely rumoured, many, including the Prime Minister, refused to believe it. At the time Esher and others thought a clique of people were acting in what they believed to be French&#x27;s interests; Margot Asquith and Lord Selborne suspected French&#x27;s American friend George Moore. French later claimed in &quot;1914&quot; that he had leaked information to Repington to &quot;destroy the apathy of a Government which had brought the Empire to the brink of disaster&quot;. By the time he wrote &quot;1914&quot; he had come to regard Asquith and Haig as responsible for his removal at the end of 1915, but at the time French was still on good terms with Asquith and wrote to him (20 May 1915, the day before the &quot;Daily Mail&quot; attacked Kitchener, and whilst Asquith was forming his new coalition government) urging him &quot;as a friend&quot; to sack Kitchener. Holmes believes French&#x27;s object was to bring down Kitchener rather than the whole government.

===1915: Loos and resignation===
====Planning Loos====

Joffre often wrote to Kitchener complaining about French. Sidney Clive noted that meetings between French and Joffre could be counterproductive as &quot;the former is irritable &amp; the latter silent&quot;.

Joffre planned once again for attacks by the BEF and French Tenth Army, combined with another French offensive in Champagne. He wrote to GHQ (12 June) that the ground at Loos was &quot;particularly favourable&quot;, although Haig reported (23 June) that the planned ground at Loos was unsuitable for an attack. French visited London (23 June) to talk to Kitchener. At a conference at Chantilly (24 June) French and Joffre agreed that further attacks on the Western Front were needed and that they should ask their governments to send all available troops to France rather than other fronts.

Asquith had a lengthy discussion (26 June) about the desirability of sacking French. Wilson thought French &quot;ridiculously optimistic about the German state of collapse&quot;, while General Haldane thought him &quot;obstinate and unreasonable&quot; (Haldane diary, 30 June 1915). After a &quot;long talk&quot; with Robertson (1 July) the King became convinced that French should be removed. Margot Asquith warned French (2 July) that his aides Freddy Guest and Brinsley Fitzgerald (whom she thought &quot;wonderfully unclever&quot;) were making trouble between him and Kitchener. Kitchener also opposed a major British offensive (Calais Conference, 6 July). Sir John expressed his concern that, although a successful attack was possible, his artillery had less than the 17 rounds per day which he deemed necessary. He was initially sceptical of Haig&#x27;s reluctance to attack and inspected the ground himself (12 July). Although he felt that the high ground already in British hands would provide good observation, he broadly concurred with Haig&#x27;s analysis. Robertson also opposed the attack.

Haig discovered (14 July) that the King had lost confidence in French, and discussed the matter with Kitchener. Wilson noted that relations between French and Robertson were breaking down by the summer, and suspected (correctly) that Robertson was blackening French&#x27;s reputation by sending home documents which French had refused to read or sign. French told Clive (20 July) to inform GQG that ammunition shortage only permitted &quot;holding&quot; attacks and then (25 July) announced that there would be no attack at all. However, after an unsatisfactory meeting with Foch the previous day, he wrote a personal letter to Joffre (28 July) leaving the decision in his hands, although he noted concerns in his diary that night that the French attack at Arras would not be &quot;decisive&quot;. He also noted (diary, 29 July) that the French were annoyed at British strikes and failure to bring in conscription, and might make a separate peace if Britain did not pull her weight, and may also have agreed to the attack because he had learned that his own job was under threat. Kitchener, who had changed his mind, eventually (19 August) ordered the attack to proceed.

====Loos====

French went sick in September, Robertson acting as Commander-in-Chief BEF. Both GHQ and First Army persuaded themselves that the Loos attack could succeed, perhaps as the use of gas, whose use by the Germans at Second Ypres had been condemned by Sir John, would allow a decisive victory. French was privately doubtful that a breakthrough would be achieved and was concerned that in the event of failure the government would want to &quot;change the bowler&quot;. Haig (and Foch) wanted the reserves close to hand to exploit a breakthrough on the first day; French agreed to deploy them closer to the front but still thought they should be committed on the second day.

On the day of the attack, the engineers manning the poison gas cylinders warned not to use them, citing the weakness and unpredictability of the wind. When overruled by Lt-General Hubert Gough the gas drifted back into the British lines and caused more British than German casualties. Though one division did break through the German defences on the first day (25 September), French had positioned reserves too far to the rear, and they only reached the front line by night. Wanting to be closer to the battle, French had moved to a forward command post at Lilliers, less than 20 miles behind First Army&#x27;s front. He left Robertson and most of his staff behind at GHQ and had no direct telephone link to the First Army. Haig&#x27;s infantry attacked at 6.30 am on 25 September and he sent an officer by car requesting release of the reserves at 7 am—he did not hear until 10.02 am that the divisions were moving up to the front. French visited Haig between 11 and 11:30 and agreed that Haig could have the reserve, but rather than using the telephone he drove to Haking&#x27;s headquarters and gave the order personally at 12:10 pm. Haig then heard from Haking at 1.20 pm that the reserves were moving forward, but by the time the men, already exhausted from an overnight march in the rain, reached the front line through the chaos of the battlefield they were committed against strengthened German positions the following morning.
Joffre sent a letter of congratulation (26 September)—Clive sensed that Joffre did not really believe the British attack would succeed but wanted it kept going as a diversion from Champagne, although after complaints from Sir John that the French Tenth Army were not doing enough Foch ordered them to take over some line from the British around Loos. When the British reserves were ordered to attack on the second day (26 September), the advancing divisions found unbroken barbed wire and intact and ungassed German defenses. The slaughter that day resulted in 7,861 British casualties without a single German casualty.

Sir John was still keen for a concerted Anglo-French attack, telling Foch (28 September) that a gap could be &quot;rushed&quot; just north of Hill 70, although Foch felt that this would be difficult to co-ordinate and Haig told him that First Army was not in a position for further attacks at the moment. Charteris wrote that &quot;Sir John French is played out. The show is too big for him and he is despondent.&quot;

The Battle of Loos was a strategic and tactical failure and has become one of the epitomes of a Great War battle in which generals showed complete disregard for the situations on the front lines the soldiers were facing. With only 533 guns and a shortage of shells to cover a wide 11,200 yard front with two German trench lines to bombard, the British would likely be attacking positions that had not been disrupted enough to allow a breakthrough. The British commanders at this time did not grasp that German tactical doctrine called for the second line of machine gun nests to be situated on the reverse slope of their hillside defenses; destroying them would need artillery with higher trajectories and shells with high explosives. By the time the Battle of Loos ended, around 8 October, the British suffered anywhere between 41,000 and 61,000 casualties, with most estimates for German casualties around 20,000.

====Criticism after Loos====
Criticism of French, especially for his slow release of the reserves on the first day (25 September), began to mount even while the battle was still under way. Haig wrote of French in his diary (2 October) &quot;It seems impossible to discuss military problems with an unreasoning brain of this kind&quot;. Even French&#x27;s trusted secretary Brinsley Fitzgerald recorded in his diary (5 October 1915) that French&#x27;s &quot;sudden moods are weird and marvellous but we never now even have explanations&quot;. Haig told Haldane (9 October) that French&#x27;s handling of the reserves had lost the battle. Kitchener demanded an explanation (11 October). Haig told Rawlinson (10 and 22 October 1915) he could no longer be loyal to French after Loos. Haig also wrote to GHQ (21 October) claiming that fresh forces could have pushed through with little opposition between 9 am and 11 am on the first day.

To French&#x27;s annoyance the King arrived in France (21 October) to sample opinion for himself—French met him at Boulogne but was summoned to London for talks with Kitchener and the Dardanelles Committee. Gough and Haking visited the King after tea (24 October) and told him &quot;everyone has lost confidence in the C-in-C&quot; while over dinner that evening Haig told the King that French was &quot;a source of great weakness to the Army, and no one had any confidence in him any more&quot;.

Robertson, visiting London in early October, had discussed French&#x27;s replacement with Murray (now CIGS) and the King. After he returned to France and conferred with Haig, Haig recorded (diary 24 October) &quot;I ha[ve] been more than loyal to French and did my best to stop all criticism of him or his methods ... I ha[ve] come to the conclusion that it [i]s not fair to the Empire to retain French in command. Moreover, none of my officers commanding corps had a high opinion of Sir John&#x27;s military ability or military views; in fact &quot;they had no confidence in him&quot;. Robertson quite agreed and left me saying he knew how to act, and would report to Stamfordham&quot;. Robertson thought (24 October) that French&#x27;s &quot;mind was never the same for two consecutive minutes&quot; and that his ideas were &quot;reckless and impossible&quot; and that he had poor relations with Joffre.

====Resignation====
GHQ suggested that according to Haking&#x27;s own report the reserves had been held up by &quot;avoidable delay&quot;. Haig denied that there had been any &quot;avoidable delay&quot; and Haking changed his mind and sent a new report blaming the slowness of his troops&#x27; march on their inexperience. French&#x27;s despatch was published (2 November) claiming that the reserves had been released at 9.30 am. Haig demanded amendments and another interview between French and Haig ensued. Even though Charteris doubted that the quicker arrival of the reserves would have made much difference, the dispute revolved around the deployment and release of the reserves. Robertson told the King (27 October) that Haig should replace French. French&#x27;s policies were attacked in the House of Lords (9 November) and again on 16 November when Lord St Davids complained of &quot;the presence of ladies&quot; at GHQ.

Haig sent copies of the relevant orders and a critique of GHQ&#x27;s conduct of the battle to his wife, who showed them to Stamfordham (10 November) for the King to see. Robertson was working against French, telling Haig (15 November) that &quot;the first thing is to get you in command&quot;. The Prime Minister discussed the matter with the King and Kitchener (both of whom thought French not up to the job, although Kitchener thought the time not right for a change), and, on 23 November, Haig. Asquith then asked Esher to convey to French in person the news that he must resign, but that he was being offered a peerage and the newly created job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces. However, French insisted on seeing Asquith again (29 November) at which meeting Asquith told him that he must take the first step and that he was not being &quot;recalled&quot; (sacked). French&#x27;s official critique of Haig&#x27;s performance at Loos finally reached the War Office on 1 December. He wrote to Asquith (2 December) suggesting that Kitchener be removed to be replaced by a civilian Secretary of State to avoid friction with the new job of Commander-in-Chief Home Forces, and writing that he would await Asquith&#x27;s decision on this point. He returned to France (3 December), but Asquith had been exchanging further letters with Stamfordham and they agreed that French must now be pressed to quit. Walter Long telephoned French (4 December) passing on the Prime Minister&#x27;s message that he &quot;must&quot; resign.

Kitchener told Esher (4 December) that the government intended to appoint Robertson Commander-in-Chief of the BEF, but Haig was appointed instead. French&#x27;s resignation, recommending Robertson as successor, reached Asquith on the morning of 6 December. It was announced in the press on 17 December and took effect at noon on 18 December. French was cheered onto the boat home by an escort of 19th Hussars.

==Commander-in-Chief, Home Forces==
===Home Defence===

French returned to England to be appointed Commander-in-Chief of the British Home Forces in December 1915, and in January 1916, he was created Viscount French of Ypres and of High Lake in the County of Roscommon. Robertson prevented him having the same powers as the old Commander-in-Chief of the British Army or having a seat on the Army Council.

Despite estimates that the Germans could land up to 170,000 men, French thought an invasion unlikely unless the Germans had first won on the Western Front. He was energetic about inspecting defences, and appealed to Asquith to obtain the services of Arthur Paget and Bruce Hamilton.

===Ireland and Easter Rising===
French&#x27;s term of office saw the suppression in 1916 of the Easter Rising, which briefly coincided with a German invasion scare. An intelligence report on 21 April warned of collaboration between the Irish and the Germans. French received news of the insurrection at noon on 24 April 1916, and at once sent two infantry brigades to Ireland and put other formations on standby—the Admiralty warned that the German fleet was out. Woken at 4 am on 25 April with the news that the Germans were shelling Lowestoft, French ordered the commanders of the two Home Defence Armies to prepare for action and ordered two divisions in the Midlands to be prepared to move to the coast. Later that day he was informed that Macready had been deputed to handle the War Office&#x27;s side of the Irish uprising. French rejected Kitchener&#x27;s suggestion that he go to Ireland and take personal command, a decision with which the Prime Minister concurred. The military authorities reported from Dublin that they had the situation well in hand.

On the evening of 26 April, told that the government had decided to send out a new general to Ireland, French selected Maxwell. French had already told Asquith that he had ordered the 60th Division to be ready to move, but would not send it without the concurrence of the General Staff. On 27 April, French visited Robertson who agreed with him that to send more troops to Ireland would be &quot;playing the German game&quot;. However, the next day after visits from Midleton (on instructions from Asquith) and Carson French agreed to send three extra battalions, as well as the cavalry brigade from Aldershot which Maxwell now requested. The rebellion was crushed by 29 April. On 3 May Asquith recorded his concerns that the shooting of rebels might antagonise Irish opinion, but French, despite having been advised by John Redmond that Sinn Féin had little support outside Dublin and that the Army should not use more than minimal force, passed on these concerns with the caveat that he would not interfere with Maxwell&#x27;s actions. In the opinion of one biographer French&#x27;s views had not moved on since his hanging of the Cape Colony Boers, and he bears some responsibility for the shootings.

===Animosity with Haig===
French became increasingly critical of Haig&#x27;s Western Front Offensives, particularly the choice of Rawlinson to command the Somme. In August 1916 Robertson warned Haig that &quot;Winston, French and various &#x27;degommed people&#x27; are trying to make mischief&quot;.

In October 1916, Lloyd George (then War Secretary) sought French&#x27;s advice about recent press criticism of British artillery and discipline, then sent him to France to sound out the opinion of the French generals about why the French had gained ground with fewer losses on the Somme. Foch (C-in-C French Army Group North) confessed to Wilson that Haig&#x27;s methods invited criticism, and Haig refused to meet him. Haig and Robertson were both concerned that Lloyd George might appoint French CIGS in Robertson&#x27;s place. On 25 November 1916 the King summoned French to Buckingham Palace and warned him to stop criticising Haig. In January 1917 French refused an invitation from Derby to dine with Haig, but on 22 June, after pressure from the King, a meeting was arranged for French and Haig to bury the hatchet, at which, by Haig&#x27;s account, French confessed that in his bitterness at being removed from command he had &quot;said things then which he was ashamed of now&quot;. Haig, according to his own diary, congratulated him for &quot;speaking out like a man&quot; and they shook hands as they parted, but their rapprochement was short-lived.

===Air Defence===
French took on responsibility for air defence and was frequently lobbied by local groups for better air defences. In January 1917 anti-aircraft guns were reallocated to anti-submarine warfare. After the Gotha raids in July 1917 a War Cabinet sub-committee was set up and French urged that air be treated as a separate department going forward (which eventually became the RAF). More guns and fighter squadrons were provided, and Brigadier E. B. Ashmore was appointed to command London&#x27;s air defence, reporting to French.

===Advice to War Cabinet===
In July 1917, French asked to advise the War Cabinet, aware that this was breaking the monopoly of advice on which Robertson insisted. On 11 October 1917, French and Wilson were invited to the War Cabinet. French&#x27;s paper criticised GHQ&#x27;s inflated estimates of German casualties compared to War Office figures, pointed out that there was no firm evidence that German losses were commensurate with Allied, and that any further Western Front Offensive &quot;has become more of a &#x27;gamble&#x27; than anything else we have undertaken&quot; and that any future plans and forecasts by Haig should be most carefully examined. He recommended the &quot;Petain solution&quot; (i.e. standing mainly on the defensive on the Western Front until the Americans arrived in force) and urged the creation of an Allied Supreme War Council.

Hankey met French and Wilson on 24 October and urged them to reconsider, concerned that if Robertson resigned the Conservatives might bring down the government. French refused, saying Haig was &quot;always making the same mistake&quot; and &quot;we shall do no good until we break down the Haig-Robertson ring&quot;. Hankey thought that &quot;there was envy, hatred and malice in the old boy&#x27;s heart as he spoke&quot;. Haig regarded French&#x27;s paper as &quot;the outcome of a jealous and disappointed mind&quot;.

===Manpower crisis===
Although French was responsible for training, the demands of the Western Front left him very short of fit troops. At the start of 1917 French had a defensive force of 470,000 men, of whom 232,459 were &quot;mobile&quot; reserves and 237,894 on beach and anti-aircraft defence. By January 1918 the total had been reduced to 400,979, of whom 190,045 were &quot;mobile&quot;. There were around 600,000 Category &quot;A&quot; men in Britain, of whom 372,000 were sent to France between January and November 1918 when the government were doing all they could to reinforce the BEF—by May 1918 even troops with medical grade of B1 were sent to France.

French&#x27;s reputation had recovered and he had come to be regarded as one of the government&#x27;s leading advisers. French was pleased at the removal of Robertson and Derby early in 1918, and during the German Spring Offensive urged that Haig be sacked and replaced by Plumer. In May 1918 he again suggested to Wilson (now CIGS) that Haig be appointed his successor as Commander-in-Chief Home Forces.

==Lord Lieutenant of Ireland==
===1918===
French noted that Irish divisions could no longer be kept up to strength by voluntary recruitment. In March 1918, when the Cabinet planned to extend conscription to Ireland, French claimed that &quot;opinion was about evenly divided&quot; on the issue, and thought it would cause opposition but not &quot;bloodshed&quot;. In the event the threat of Irish conscription provoked great opposition and contributed to the growth in support for Sinn Féin.

Lloyd George intended to replace the Lord Lieutenant—normally something of a figurehead position—with three &quot;Justices&quot;: James Campbell, Midleton and French himself. The three met on 30 April 1918 and jointly demanded immediate conscription and martial law in Ireland. When Lloyd George refused, Campbell declined any further involvement; Lloyd George also dropped Midleton when the latter demanded the right to &quot;advise on policy&quot;. French eventually accepted appointment as sole Lord Lieutenant in May 1918 on condition it was as a &quot;Military Viceroy at the Head of a Quasi-Military Government&quot;. French also arranged for Shaw, his chief of staff at Horse Guards, to replace Mahon as Commander-in-Chief, Ireland and that Irish Command should become a separate command, rather than under Home Forces.

French also set up an Executive Council and a Military Council to which senior officers of the Royal Irish Constabulary (RIC) and Dublin Metropolitan Police (DMP) were sometimes invited. He also set up an Advisory Council, with the support of the King, Haldane and Carson, which he hoped might contain representatives of all strands of Irish opinion but in practice its members were all well-connected wealthy men. Sinn Féin were not involved despite Haldane&#x27;s hopes and the proposal angered the existing administrators at Dublin Castle. The body provided useful advice on commercial and industrial questions, and advised that Home Rule could work as a federation of separate assemblies in Belfast and Dublin (also French&#x27;s view), but ceased to meet regularly after April 1919.

French was convinced that the Sinn Féin leaders had little support amongst the majority of the Irish people. He wanted Home Rule to be implemented, provided the violence was stopped first. In 1917 he had bought a country house at Drumdoe in Frenchpark, County Roscommon, but in practice was seldom able to visit the place as the situation in Ireland deteriorated.

On the night of 17/18 May 1918 French had Sinn Féin leaders arrested and documents were seized, but even supporters like Repington and Macready were disappointed at the lack of clear evidence of collaboration with the Germans and the flimsy legal grounds for the arrests, which caused endless legal wrangles. Michael Collins and Cathal Brugha escaped arrest and increased their own power in the vacuum created by the arrest of more moderate leaders.

The Irish Volunteers and Sinn Féin were proclaimed &quot;dangerous organisations&quot; in certain areas. French obtained a cash bonus for Irish policemen, and pressed for them to receive decorations. He also came down hard on senior Irish police officers whom he thought useless, threatening resignation unless the Inspector-General of the RIC, Brigadier-General Joseph Byrne, was removed.

French, who like many generals of his generation believed that the government owed a moral duty to those who had served, urged that a &quot;Comrades of the Great War (Ireland)&quot; be set up to prevent returning Irish war veterans joining the Sinn Féin-dominated &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Federation&quot;; he also recommended that soldiers be given cash and land grants, perhaps in &quot;Soldiers&#x27; Colonies&quot;. This plan was stymied by cash shortage and inter-departmental infighting.

===1919===

French clashed with the Chief Secretary Edward Shortt over his insistence that he exercise executive authority in Dublin, and when Lloyd George formed a new government in January 1919 Shortt was replaced by the more pliable Ian Macpherson. French was appointed to the British Cabinet.

French secured the appointment of Sir James Macmahon as Under-Secretary at Dublin Castle. Macmahon was Catholic, which caused Walter Long and to some extent, French himself concerns that this would increase the power of the Church hierarchy over Irish government. In practice Macmahon was frozen out of decision-making by Macpherson while French was ill with pneumonia between February and April 1919, and despite warnings from French of administrative chaos at Dublin Castle it was not until 1920 that the highly able John Anderson was appointed as Joint Under-Secretary with Macmahon.

The shooting deaths of two Catholic constables of the RIC in an ambush at Soloheadbeg, County Tipperary (21 January 1919) caused French to call off tentative talks between Haldane and the recently elected Irish Dáil.

French and Macpherson wanted Sinn Féin declared illegal and pressed for a free hand to deal with the militants, although the issue received little priority while Lloyd George was at Versailles in the first half of 1919. Sinn Féin was declared illegal on 5 July 1919 after District Inspector Hunt was killed in broad daylight, in Thurles (23 June). By October 1919 French was urging martial law. By December he was furious at the government&#x27;s lack of support and their insistence that the RIC buy army surplus vehicles on the open market instead of simply being given them.

Shaw was sceptical about the legality of martial law and thought it might be impractical in cities like Dublin and Cork. French was advised that 15 army battalions and 24 cycle units (half a battalion in size) were needed to keep order, but British strength did not reach these levels until the summer of 1920. In November 1919, Irish Command listed its minimum requirement as 25,000 &quot;bayonet strength&quot;—at the time there were just over 37,000 troops in Ireland, many of them non-combatants. Even in January 1920 only 34 battalions were available, rather than the 36 required. British military strength in Ireland reached 51 battalions during the martial law period early in 1921.

IRA intimidation caused traditional RIC sources of information to dry up. By late 1919, with French&#x27;s approval, the RIC was recruiting in England: first the &quot;Black and Tans&quot;, then the Auxiliary Division (ex-army officers with the powers of police sergeants) from July 1920.
French had been receiving death threats since January 1919, which he believed were a sign that government measures were having an effect. On 19 December 1919 a group of eleven IRA men, including Seán Treacy, Seamus Robinson, Seán Hogan, Paddy Daly, Joe Leonard, Martin Savage and Dan Breen, sought to ambush and kill French as he returned from Ashtown railway station to the Vice-Regal Lodge in Phoenix Park, Dublin. Savage, Kehoe and Breen were interrupted by a RIC officer as they pushed a hay-cart halfway across the road blocking the path of French&#x27;s car. He was dragged off the road after one of them lobbed a grenade at him, which did not go off but knocked him unconscious. When French&#x27;s car convoy appeared minutes later the IRA unit focused their attack upon the second car on the basis of incorrect intelligence: French was actually in the first car. In the ensuing crossfire, Breen was hit in the leg and Savage was killed by a bullet in the neck. French&#x27;s bodyguard was wounded, and he was saved in part by the quick thinking of his driver. A grenade, which would almost certainly have killed him, exploded in the back seat of the second car.

The Cabinet agreed that the Irish Government could impose martial law whenever it pleased, although in the event this did not happen for almost another year, by which time executive authority had been returned to London. Suspects could now be interned under Defence of the Realm Act 1914 s. 14B on warrants signed by the Chief Secretary and French pressed Macpherson, who had been shocked by the attempted assassination, to intern as many as possible, although he advised against interning politicians like Arthur Griffith &quot;simply for making seditious speeches&quot;.

===Final period===
Political support from London for internment wavered. French opposed the release of hunger strikers under the &quot;Cat and Mouse&quot; Act and wanted them simply left to die, but in April 1920, under pressure from London, they were paroled.

French lost a good deal of executive power as substantial control over Irish affairs was given back to a new Chief Secretary, Hamar Greenwood, in April 1920. French again urged the introduction of martial law in Ireland and the use of Ulster Volunteers as peacekeepers in Southern Ireland. Wilson and Macready expected French to be sacked in the spring of 1920. Wilson wrote: &quot;Poor little man he is so weak and pliable and then has such inconsequential gusts of illogical passion&quot;.

French had supported the use of armoured cars and aircraft in Ireland. By June 1920 the military situation had escalated considerably and French suggested that they should be permitted to strafe and bomb freely into areas from which civilians had been removed.

French resigned as Lord Lieutenant of Ireland on 30 April 1921 and was replaced by Lord Edmund Talbot, a Catholic.

==Honorary positions==
French was president of The Ypres League, a veterans&#x27; society for those who had served at the Ypres Salient. He was also colonel of the 19th Hussars from 14 February 1902 (retaining this position when French persuaded Wilson to amalgamate them with the 15th to become the 15th/19th The King&#x27;s Royal Hussars), colonel of the 1st Battalion, The Cambridgeshire Regiment from 22 April 1909 and colonel-in-chief of the Royal Irish Regiment from 26 March 1913, succeeding Wolseley. The Royal Irish Regiment was disbanded along with the four other Southern Irish regiments, in 1922. He was Colonel of the Irish Guards from June 1916.

==Memoirs==
Stung by press attacks in February 1917, French published his memoirs &quot;1914&quot;, ghosted by the journalist Lovat Fraser, in April and May 1919. The unauthorised publication of the book technically laid him open to prosecution as he was Lord Lieutenant of Ireland at the time. The King was angered, and Bonar Law warned French that the government could not defend him if the House of Commons demanded his resignation. Smith-Dorrien, as a serving officer, was not permitted to reply. Haig, Asquith and Bertie complained of inaccuracies and it was attacked by Sir John Fortescue as &quot;one of the most unfortunate books ever written&quot;. Smith-Dorrien, in a private written statement, called &quot;1914&quot; &quot;mostly a work of fiction and a foolish one too&quot;.

French left an uncompleted autobiography, which was used by Gerald French in his 1931 life of his father. In 1972 the ownership of French&#x27;s war diaries was disputed following the bankruptcy of the 3rd Earl of Ypres.

==Retirement==
French retired from the British Army in April 1921 and was elevated to the Earldom of Ypres in June 1922.

Drumdoe was looted early in 1923, for which French received an apology and a promise of an armed guard for the place from Governor-General T. M. Healy. Despite a gift of £50,000 in 1916, and receiving field marshal&#x27;s half pay, owning two properties in Ireland which he could not use left French again short of money, although he did not improve matters by staying often at the Hôtel de Crillon in Paris. He left £8,450 (net total) in his will.

French lived at 94 Lancaster Gate, London, which provided a useful base for his amorous activities, on which he often embarked together with a wealthy American friend, George Moore. In August 1923 Lord Beauchamp offered him the honorary post of Captain of Deal Castle, which gave him a home in Britain once again.

==Death==

French died from bladder cancer at Deal Castle on 22 May 1925. On 25 May, his body was taken by motor hearse to London for cremation at Golders Green Crematorium. The ashes remained overnight in the Guards&#x27; Chapel, Wellington Barracks, until the funeral service at Westminster Abbey in the evening of 26 May. After the service, the ashes were escorted by a military procession to Victoria Station.

The procedure of burying ashes in an urn was still unfamiliar at the time, and it was transported in a coffin during the funeral ceremonies. An estimated 7,000 people filed past the coffin during the first two hours it lay in state. Haig, Robertson, Hamilton and Smith-Dorrien were pall bearers at the funeral at Westminster Abbey – the first of a major First World War leader. The ashes were buried in a private service in the graveyard of St. Mary the Virgin Church at Ripple, Kent, five days after his death.

==Assessments==
===Contemporaries===
French was &quot;a man about whom there were extremes of opinion, ranging from loyalty and affection to disgust&quot;. He had a hot temper and swings of mood, would address friends effusively as &quot;dear old boy&quot;, and was a womaniser and often short of money. He wore an unusually long tunic which emphasised his relatively short stature. He was—at least during the Boer War—idolised by the public and during the First World War was loved by his men in a way that Douglas Haig never was. French was also an avid reader of Dickens, from whose works he was able to recite long passages from memory.

Opinions vary as to French&#x27;s military abilities. Edward Spears, then a subaltern liaising between French and Lanrezac, later wrote of the former: You only had to look at him to see that he was a brave, determined man ... I learnt to love and to admire the man who never lost his head, and on whom danger had the effect it has on the wild boar: he would become morose, furious for a time, harsh, but he would face up and never shirk. He knew only one way of dealing with a difficulty, and that was to tackle it ... If he had once lost confidence in a man, justly or unjustly, that man could do no right in his eyes. He was as bad an enemy as he was a good friend ... once he had lost confidence in (Lanrezac) he ignored him and acted as if he and his Army did not exist. Spears also recorded that at a conference with Joffre on 30 August 1914 French, the back of his tunic wet with sweat from riding hard to reach the meeting, was &quot;one of the coolest and calmest people at GHQ&quot;. This was at the time when he had decided that the BEF would have to retreat behind the Seine to refit.

French was severely criticised by those close to Haig, including General Sir Hubert Gough, who thought him &quot;an ignorant little fool&quot; (in a letter of 29 January 1916; he was more charitable in his 1954 memoirs &quot;Soldiering On&quot; (p. 127)) and Duff Cooper in Haig&#x27;s official biography. The Official Historian Edmonds called him &quot;only &quot; of the old fashioned sort—a vain, ignorant and vindictive old man with an unsavoury society backing&quot; and claimed that French once borrowed Sir Edward Hamley&#x27;s &quot;Operations of War&quot; from the War Office library but could not understand it. His admiring biographer Cecil Chisholm (1914) claimed that as a young officer French had had a reputation as a reader of military books (Jomini, von Schmidt), a claim treated with some scepticism by Holmes, although Beckett uses it to cast doubt on Edmonds&#x27; &quot;magnificently malicious&quot; story, pointing out that he remembered enough of Hamley&#x27;s doctrines not to take shelter in Maubeuge after the Battle of Mons, although Spears later wrote that had Hamley not employed such a penetrating metaphor it might not have lodged in French&#x27;s mind. During his time in command in France his subordinates recognized him as a poor worker with a constant stream of guests, while General Smith-Dorrien remarked that there were &quot;Too many whores around your headquarters, Field-Marshal!&quot;

General Macready (in 1919) thought French &quot;one of the most lovable men I have ever met ... one of the most loyal and true-hearted individuals you are ever likely to come across&quot;. Field Marshal Chetwode, reflecting on the hostility between Haig and his former patron French, wrote that &quot;French was a man who loved life, laughter and women ... a man who might have done big things in open warfare. He was a lucky general and inspired the greatest confidence in his troops&quot; and that Haig was his opposite in most of these respects. Churchill (in &quot;Great Contemporaries&quot;) wrote that French was &quot;a natural soldier&quot; who lacked Haig&#x27;s attention to detail and endurance, but who had &quot;deeper military insight&quot; and &quot;would never have run the British army into the same long drawn-out slaughters&quot;. Seely and Esher thought highly of him. Haldane thought he had &quot;been a great Commander-in-Chief, a soldier of the first order, who held the Army as no other could&quot;. Lloyd George praised him as &quot;a far bigger man&quot; than Haig and regretted that he &quot;had fallen by the daggers of his own colleagues&quot;, although perhaps as an ally against Haig in 1916–1918.

===Modern historians===
French was ridiculed as &quot;weak-willed&quot; by Alan Clark in the widely read &quot;The Donkeys&quot; (1961). His modern biographer Richard Holmes wrote that &quot;he remains ... a discredited man&quot; with whom &quot;history has dealt too harshly&quot;. He argues that French was an emotional man who was deeply moved by casualties and identified too closely with his soldiers, even in August 1914. Holmes quotes with approval John Terraine&#x27;s verdict that French was the most distinguished English cavalry leader since Oliver Cromwell, and argues that although he did not achieve victory, his personality inspired the BEF in 1914. Holmes acknowledges that French&#x27;s qualities were marred by his &quot;undisciplined intellect and mercurial personality&quot;, but concludes by quoting Churchill&#x27;s verdict that &quot;French, in the sacred fire of leadership, was unsurpassed&quot;.

Brian Bond described French as &quot;a brave fighting general who proved out of his professional depths&quot; in 1914–15. Ian Senior offers a critical view of French in 1914: although he was &quot;essentially a generous and warm-hearted man&quot; as seen in his pre-Marne meeting with Joffre, his excitable temperament, uncertain judgement based on rumour and personal experience and his tendency to over-exaggerate problems did not suit him to be in command of the army. At best, his more questionable decisions led to a lack of support for his ally at critical moments in the campaign; at worst, they threatened to wreck Joffre&#x27;s carefully laid plans for the counteroffensive. Senior is critical of his vetoing – out of excessive concern to avoid BEF losses – of Haig&#x27;s orders to attack on 29 August, his decision to pull the BEF out of the line on 30 August, only a few hours after promising to assist Fifth Army by delaying his retreat, and his countermanding of Haig&#x27;s order to advance on 9 September. He also criticises him for his lack of any realistic appraisal of the state of II Corps after Le Cateau, and &quot;lack of urgency&quot; in advance at the Marne, and writes that French would not have cooperated without the &quot;brutal&quot; intervention of Lord Kitchener.

Max Hastings is even less kind, arguing that French used his instructions from Kitchener (to husband the strength of the BEF and to avoid major engagements without French participation unless given Cabinet authority) as an excuse for &quot;pusillanimity&quot;. He criticises him for lack of &quot;grip&quot; and for &quot;moral collapse&quot; during the retreat after Le Cateau, and describes him as &quot;a poltroon&quot;, although also pointing out that his failings were no worse than those of many French and German generals in that campaign.

Richard Holmes argues that French had no consistency in his strategic ideas, as was shown at the War Council in August 1914 when he proposed deploying the BEF to Antwerp. Ian Beckett does not wholly agree with Holmes, arguing that French was consistent in December 1914 – January 1915 in wanting to promote what he saw as Britain&#x27;s strategic interests by deploying Territorial and New Army Divisions in an offensive along the Belgian Coast to seize Zeebrugge, although he also remarks that such plans were not unique to French, as they continued to find favour with Haig in 1916–17, and that French&#x27;s hopes for amphibious landings in the Baltic or North Sea had little practicality at this stage.

In his memoirs &quot;1914&quot; French wrote &quot;no previous experience ... had led me to anticipate a war of positions. All my thoughts ... were concentrated upon a war of movement.&quot; Although French&#x27;s memoirs are often unreliable this passage is confirmed by what he wrote to Lt-Gen Edward Hutton in December 1914 that the war had become &quot;a siege ... on a gigantic scale&quot;. Ian Beckett argues that in this respect, and in his recognition of the importance of artillery as early as the Battle of the Aisne in September 1914, French&#x27;s tactical views were &quot;marginally more flexible&quot; than those of Haig, who continued to nurse hopes of breakthrough and decisive victory until several years later.

==Personal life and family==
===First marriage===
In 1875, French married Isabella Soundy, the daughter of a tradesman. Subalterns of that era were not expected to marry and French&#x27;s first marriage may well have been kept secret from his regiment: his regiment is recorded incorrectly on the marriage certificate as &quot;12th Hussars&quot;, which did not exist at the time. They divorced in 1878 with Isabella as a co-respondent and said to have been paid off by French&#x27;s wealthy brother-in-law, John Lydall. The divorce could have ruined his career if widely known. Lydall had already paid off French&#x27;s debts on a previous occasion, and later broke off relations with him when he attempted to borrow money again.

===Second marriage===
French married Eleanora Selby-Lowndes in 1880. His first son John Richard Lowndes was born in Northumberland in 1881. A daughter was accidentally suffocated by her nurse in 1882. His second son Gerald was born in December 1883.

Neither Eleanore, nor his daughter Essex (born late 1886, died 1979), were ever aware of his first marriage. French gave away his niece Georgina Whiteway (daughter of his sister Caroline) in 1903 when she married Fitzgerald Watt, French&#x27;s stockbroker. Watt became, in uniform, his ADC as Inspector-General, then Private Secretary when CIGS, then trusted aide in the First World War. As Inspector-General in the Edwardian period French appears to have been largely separated from his wife, but she appears to have still loved him. In 1905, French purchased 20 Park Mansions from Watt as a base in London. He met George Moore, a wealthy American, in about 1909 and in 1910 they took a large house together at 94 Lancaster Gate as a base for partying and womanising. Eleanore did not accompany him to Ireland (officially, as it was too dangerous).

From 1922, French re-established relations with his son Gerald, who began writing to defend his father&#x27;s reputation in the 1930s, and his last publication was &quot;The French-Kitchener Dispute: A Last Word&quot; in 1960. Gerald French died in 1970.

===Affair===
Beginning in January 1915 French had an affair with Mrs Winifred Bennett, the wife of a British diplomat. French wrote to her almost daily, sometimes signing himself &quot;Peter Pan&quot; and on the eve of Neuve Chapelle he wrote to her, &quot;Tomorrow I shall go forward with my war cry of &#x27;Winifred. She was tall and elegant, and the disparity in their heights caused great amusement.

===Siblings===
French had six sisters. One sister, Katherine Harley, by then a widow, led a group of British nurses on the Salonika front and was killed by shellfire at Monastir in March 1917. Another sister was the suffragette, anti-war campaigner and Irish nationalist Sinn Féin member Charlotte Despard, a Catholic convert.

===Arms===
==In popular culture==
After the Colesberg Operations (early 1900) the following verse was published about him:

During the Boer War, the press lionised him as &quot;Uncle French&quot; and &quot;the shirt-sleeved general&quot;.

Field Marshal French was played by Laurence Olivier in Richard Attenborough&#x27;s World War I satire film &quot;Oh! What A Lovely War&quot; (1969). Ian Beckett writes that French and Wilson are portrayed almost as &quot;a comic duo&quot; in the film. By this time, although Terraine&#x27;s &quot;Mons: Retreat to Victory&quot; (1960), Alan Clark&#x27;s &quot;The Donkeys&quot; (1961), and A. J. Smithers&#x27; &quot;The Man Who Disobeyed&quot; (a 1970 biography of Smith-Dorrien) kept up some interest in French, he was already becoming a somewhat forgotten figure as popular interest from the 1960s onwards concentrated on the Battle of the Somme, inevitably focussing attention on Douglas Haig.

In Russian the word &quot;french&quot; (), a type of four-pocketed military tunic, is named after John French.

<doc id="248717" wikidata="Q7861378" url="?curid=248717" title="Typical set">
<text>In information theory, the typical set is a set of sequences whose probability is close to two raised to the negative power of the entropy of their source distribution. That this set has total probability close to one is a consequence of the asymptotic equipartition property (AEP) which is a kind of law of large numbers. The notion of typicality is only concerned with the probability of a sequence and not the actual sequence itself.

This has great use in compression theory as it provides a theoretical means for compressing data, allowing us to represent any sequence &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot; using &quot;nH&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) bits on average, and, hence, justifying the use of entropy as a measure of information from a source.

The AEP can also be proven for a large class of stationary ergodic processes, allowing typical set to be defined in more general cases.

Additionally, the typical set concept is foundational in understanding the limits of data transmission and error correction in communication systems. By leveraging the properties of typical sequences, efficient coding schemes like Shannon&#x27;s source coding theorem and channel coding theorem are developed, enabling near-optimal data compression and reliable transmission over noisy channels.

==(Weakly) typical sequences (weak typicality, entropy typicality)==
If a sequence &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is drawn from an independent identically-distributed random variable (IID) &quot;X&quot; defined over a finite alphabet formula_1, then the typical set, &quot;A&quot;&quot;ε&quot;(&quot;n&quot;)formula_2(&quot;n&quot;) is defined as those sequences which satisfy:

:formula_3

where

: formula_4

is the information entropy of &quot;X&quot;. The probability above need only be within a factor of 2&quot;n&quot; &quot;ε&quot;. Taking the logarithm on all sides and dividing by &quot;-n&quot;, this definition can be equivalently stated as 

:formula_5

For i.i.d sequence, since 

:formula_6 

we further have 

:formula_7

By the law of large numbers, for sufficiently large &quot;n&quot; 

:formula_8

===Properties===
An essential characteristic of the typical set is that, if one draws a large number &quot;n&quot; of independent random samples from the distribution &quot;X&quot;, the resulting sequence (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) is very likely to be a member of the typical set, even though the typical set comprises only a small fraction of all the possible sequences. Formally, given any formula_9, one can choose &quot;n&quot; such that:
#The probability of a sequence from &quot;X&quot;(n) being drawn from &quot;A&quot;&quot;ε&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) is greater than 1 − &quot;ε&quot;, i.e. formula_10
#formula_11
#formula_12
#If the distribution over formula_1 is not uniform, then the fraction of sequences that are typical is
::formula_14

::as &quot;n&quot; becomes very large, since formula_15 where formula_16 is the cardinality of formula_1.

For a general stochastic process {&quot;X&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)} with AEP, the (weakly) typical set can be defined similarly with &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;) replaced by &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0&quot;τ&quot;) (i.e. the probability of the sample limited to the time interval [0, &quot;τ&quot;]), &quot;n&quot; being the degree of freedom of the process in the time interval and &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) being the entropy rate. If the process is continuous valued, differential entropy is used instead.

===Example===
Counter-intuitively, the most likely sequence is often not a member of the typical set. For example, suppose that &quot;X&quot; is an i.i.d Bernoulli random variable with &quot;p&quot;(0)=0.1 and &quot;p&quot;(1)=0.9. In &quot;n&quot; independent trials, since &quot;p&quot;(1)&gt;&quot;p&quot;(0), the most likely sequence of outcome is the sequence of all 1&#x27;s, (1,1...,1). Here the entropy of &quot;X&quot; is &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;)=0.469, while 

:formula_18

So this sequence is not in the typical set because its average logarithmic probability cannot come arbitrarily close to the entropy of the random variable &quot;X&quot; no matter how large we take the value of &quot;n&quot;. 

For Bernoulli random variables, the typical set consists of sequences with average numbers of 0s and 1s in &quot;n&quot; independent trials. This is easily demonstrated: If &quot;p(1) = p&quot; and &quot;p(0) = 1-p&quot;, then for &quot;n&quot; trials with &quot;m&quot; 1&#x27;s, we have 

:formula_19

The average number of 1&#x27;s in a sequence of Bernoulli trials is &quot;m = np&quot;. Thus, we have 

:formula_20

For this example, if &quot;n&quot;=10, then the typical set consist of all sequences that have a single 0 in the entire sequence. In case &quot;p&quot;(0)=&quot;p&quot;(1)=0.5, then every possible binary sequences belong to the typical set.

==Strongly typical sequences (strong typicality, letter typicality)==
If a sequence &quot;x&quot;1, ..., &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot; is drawn from some specified joint distribution defined over a finite or an infinite alphabet formula_1, then the strongly typical set, &quot;A&quot;ε,strong(&quot;n&quot;)formula_2 is defined as the set of sequences which satisfy

:formula_23

where formula_24 is the number of occurrences of a specific symbol in the sequence.

It can be shown that strongly typical sequences are also weakly typical (with a different constant ε), and hence the name. The two forms, however, are not equivalent. Strong typicality is often easier to work with in proving theorems for memoryless channels. However, as is apparent from the definition, this form of typicality is only defined for random variables having finite support.

==Jointly typical sequences==
Two sequences formula_25 and formula_26 are jointly ε-typical if the pair formula_27 is ε-typical with respect to the joint distribution formula_28 and both formula_25 and formula_26 are ε-typical with respect to their marginal distributions formula_31 and formula_32. The set of all such pairs of sequences formula_27 is denoted by formula_34. Jointly ε-typical &quot;n&quot;-tuple sequences are defined similarly.

Let formula_35 and formula_36 be two independent sequences of random variables with the same marginal distributions formula_31 and formula_32. Then for any ε&gt;0, for sufficiently large &quot;n&quot;, jointly typical sequences satisfy the following properties:
#formula_39
#formula_40
#formula_41
#formula_42
#formula_43

==Applications of typicality==
===Typical set encoding===

In information theory, typical set encoding encodes only the sequences in the typical set of a stochastic source with fixed length block codes. Since the size of the typical set is about &quot;2&quot;nH(X), only &quot;nH(X)&quot; bits are required for the coding, while at the same time ensuring that the chances of encoding error is limited to ε. Asymptotically, it is, by the AEP, lossless and achieves the minimum rate equal to the entropy rate of the source.

===Typical set decoding===
In information theory, typical set decoding is used in conjunction with random coding to estimate the transmitted message as the one with a codeword that is jointly ε-typical with the observation. i.e.
:formula_44
where formula_45 are the message estimate, codeword of message formula_46 and the observation respectively. formula_34 is defined with respect to the joint distribution formula_48 where formula_49 is the transition probability that characterizes the channel statistics, and formula_50 is some input distribution used to generate the codewords in the random codebook.

== Etymology==
The name of Ústí nad Labem is formed from the Old Czech &#x27; (&#x27;river mouth&#x27;) and &#x27; (&#x27;Elbe&#x27;). It thus literally means &quot;Mouth-upon-the-Elbe&quot;, in reference to its location at the Bílina&#x27;s confluence with the Elbe.

The Czech name was Latinized as &#x27; and Germanized as &#x27; (also written as &quot;). Before Czechoslovak independence amid the dissolution of Austria-Hungary following World War I, the town was usually known in English as Aussig.

==Geography==
Ústí nad Labem is located about north of Prague and south of Dresden in Germany. It lies mostly in a hilly landscape of the Central Bohemian Uplands, but it also extends into the Most Basin in the northwest. The highest point is the hill Široký vrch at above sea level. The city is situated at the confluence of the Elbe and Bílina rivers. Half of Lake Milada lies in the municipal territory. The southern part of the territory lies in the České středohoří Protected Landscape Area.

===Climate===
==History==
For years, the charter of the Prague Benedictine monastery from 993 was considered to be the first written mention of Ústí nad Labem, but it has been proven to be a hoax. The first verified written mention is in the charter of the chapter at the Church of St. Stephen in Litoměřice, dated to 1056 or 1057. In 1249, it was first mentioned with the title of royal town.

In the second half of the 13th century, King Ottokar II invited German settlers into the country and granted them a German form of municipal incorporation, thereby founding the city proper. In 1423, as King of Bohemia, Sigismund pledged the town to Elector Frederick I of Meissen, who occupied it with a Saxon garrison. On 16 June 1426, after the city was besieged by the 25,000 Hussites, the besiegers defeat a German army of 70,000 troops was sent to its relief but the Hussites defeated the Germans amid great slaughter. The next day, the Hussites stormed and razed the town. It was left derelict for three years before rebuilding began in 1429.

Ústí nad Labem was again burned down in 1583 and was sacked by the Swedes in 1639 amid the Thirty Years&#x27; War. It also suffered grievously during the Seven Years&#x27; War and was near the 1813 Battle of Kulm between France and the alliance of Austria, Prussia, and Russia during the Napoleonic Wars. As late as 1830, its population was only 1,400.

As part of the Kingdom of Bohemia, it was eventually incorporated into the Habsburg monarchy and heavily industrialized over the 19th century. After the Compromise of 1867, it headed the Aussig District, one of Austrian Bohemia&#x27;s 94 district commissions (&quot;). In the 1870s, with only 11,000 people, it was a major producer of woolen goods, linen, paper, ships, and chemicals and carried on a large trade in grain, fruit, mineral water, lumber, and coal. By 1900, large-scale immigration had boosted the population to nearly 40,000, mostly German, and added glassworking and stone to its trades. The local river port became the busiest in the entire Austro-Hungarian Empire, surpassing even the seaport in Trieste.
The factories of Aussig—as it was then known—were an early centre of the National Socialism (&quot;Nazi&quot;) movement. The German Workers&#x27; Party in Austria (&quot;&quot;) was founded on 15 November 1903 and later gave rise to the Sudeten German Party and Austrian National Socialism. Their books continued to be printed in Ústí nad Labem even after the formation of Czechoslovakia in 1918. During the 1930 census, Ústí nad Labem was home to 43,793 residents: 32,878 considered German, 8,735 Czech or Slovak, 222 Jews, 16 Russians, and 11 Hungarians. Ústí nad Labem was ceded to Nazi Germany with the rest of the Sudetenland in October 1938 under the terms of the Munich Agreement and placed under the administration of the &quot;Regierungsbezirk Aussig&quot; of Reichsgau Sudetenland. On New Year&#x27;s Eve of that year, the Nazis burnt down the local synagogue; a meat factory was later raised in its place. The Jewish community in Ústí nad Labem was mostly exterminated over the course of World War II amid the Holocaust. In April 1945, the city was severely bombed by the United States Air Force.

Shortly after the war ended, on 31 July 1945, an explosion of the local ammunition depot triggered a pogrom of the German population, known as the Ústí massacre, mostly at the hands of out-of-town paramilitary groups. Whilst the official investigation blamed the explosion on German saboteurs, more recent historical work points towards it being a communist provocation, intended to effect the subsequent expulsion of Germans. Between 80 and a thousand people died in the event, with estimates varying widely, but being generally much higher than the official body count.
Under the terms of the Potsdam Conference and the Beneš decrees, the city was restored to Czechoslovakia and almost the totality of its previous population expelled as being German. In May 1948, the Communist government passed a new constitution declaring a people&#x27;s republic. Communism continued until the 1989 fall of the Berlin Wall set off a series of events which are now known as the Velvet Revolution. Today, Ústí nad Labem is a major industrial city of the Czech Republic with substantial chemical, metallurgical, textile, food, and machine tool industries.

The city gained notoriety in 1999, when the Matiční Street Wall was built to separate Matiční Street with mainly Romani population from other residents, which turned into an international scandal. The wall was torn down after six weeks of its existence.

==Demographics==
==Economy==
Ústí nad Labem is the economic centre of the Ústí nad Labem Region and the seat of many industrial companies. The largest industrial employers with its headquarters in Ústí nad Labem and at least 500 employees are Spolek pro chemickou a hutní výrobu (chemical industry) and Strabag Rail (construction industry). Other large industrial companies in the city include Kone Industrial (manufacture of elevators), Severotisk (printing industry) and Pierburg (manufacture of car parts).

==Transport==
===Road transport===
The D8 motorway (part of the European route E55) from Prague to Dresden intersects the western border of Ústí nad Labem. The European route E442 from Liberec to Karlovy Vary, formed by first class road, also passes through the city.

Mariánský Bridge is a road bridge over the Elbe which was built over a period of five years and opened in 1998. It bleongs to the main landmarks of the city. International Association for Bridge and Structural Engineering ranked Mariánský Bridge between the 10 best structures of the world in the decade.

===City mass transport===
The city has a network of mass transport that includes bus and trolley bus lines. The city has its own transport company, &quot;Dopravní podnik města Ústí nad Labem&quot;.

===Railway transport===

<text>An online encyclopedia, also called an Internet encyclopedia, is a digital encyclopedia accessible through the Internet. Some examples include Encyclopedia.com since 1998, Encarta from 2000 to 2009, Wikipedia since 2001, and &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; since 2016.

== Digitization of old content ==

In January 1995, Project Gutenberg started to publish the ASCII text of the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot;, 11th edition (1911), but disagreements about the method halted the work after the first volume. For trademark reasons, the text had been published as the Gutenberg Encyclopedia. Since then, Project Gutenberg digitized and proofread the encyclopedia, until the last update in September 2018. Project Gutenberg published volumes in alphabetical order; the most recent publication is &quot;Volume 17 Slice 1: &quot;Lord Chamberlain&quot; to &quot;Luqman&quot;&quot;, published on August 9, 2013. The latest &quot;Britannica&quot; was digitized by its publishers, and sold first as a CD-ROM, and later as an online service.

In 2001, ASCII text of all 28 volumes was published on &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition by source; a copyright claim was added to the materials included. The website no longer exists.

Other digitization projects have made progress in other titles; one example is &quot;Easton&#x27;s Bible Dictionary (1897)&quot; digitized by the Christian Classics Ethereal Library.

Other websites provide online encyclopedias, some of which are also available on Wikisource. However, some may be more complete than those on Wikisource, or may be from different editions.

==Creation of new content==
Another early online encyclopedia was called the &quot;Global Encyclopedia&quot;. In November 1995, James Rettig, Assistant Dean of University Libraries for Reference and Information Services at College of William &amp; Mary, presented an unfavorable review at the 15th Annual Charleston Conference on library acquisitions and related issues. He said of the &quot;Global Encyclopedia&quot;:
Examples of article entries included Iowa City:
Wikipedia is a free content, multilingual online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteer contributors, known as Wikipedians, through a model of open collaboration. It is the largest and most-read reference work in history. Wikipedia originally developed from another encyclopedia project called Nupedia.

<doc id="248750" wikidata="Q25485" url="?curid=248750" title="Great tit">
<text>The great tit (Parus major) is a small passerine bird in the tit family Paridae. It is a widespread and common species throughout Europe, the Middle East, Central Asia and east across the Palearctic to the Amur River, south to parts of North Africa where it is generally resident in any sort of woodland; most great tits do not migrate except in extremely harsh winters. Until 2005 this species was lumped with numerous other subspecies. DNA studies have shown these other subspecies to be distinct from the great tit and these have now been separated as two distinct species, the cinereous tit (&quot;Parus cinereus&quot;) of southern Asia, and the Japanese tit (&quot;Parus minor&quot;) of East Asia. The great tit remains the most widespread species in the genus &quot;Parus&quot;.

The great tit is a distinctive bird with a black head and neck, prominent white cheeks, olive upperparts and yellow underparts, with some variation amongst the numerous subspecies. It is predominantly insectivorous in the summer, but will consume a wider range of food items in the winter months, including small hibernating bats. Like all tits it is a cavity nester, usually nesting in a hole in a tree. The female lays around 12 eggs and incubates them alone, although both parents raise the chicks. In most years the pair will raise two broods. The nests may be raided by woodpeckers, squirrels and weasels and infested with fleas, and adults may be hunted by sparrowhawks. The great tit has adapted well to human changes in the environment and is a common and familiar bird in urban parks and gardens. The great tit is also an important study species in ornithology.

==Taxonomy==
The great tit was described under its current binomial name by Carl Linnaeus in his 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. Its scientific name is derived from the Latin &quot;parus&quot; &quot;tit&quot; and &quot;maior&quot; &quot;larger&quot;. Francis Willughby had used the name in the 17th century.
The great tit was formerly treated as ranging from Britain to Japan and south to the islands of Indonesia, with 36 described subspecies ascribed to four main species groups. The &quot;major&quot; group had 13 subspecies across Europe, temperate Asia and north Africa, the &quot;minor&quot; group&#x27;s nine subspecies occurred from southeast Russia and Japan into northern southeast Asia and the 11 subspecies in the &quot;cinereus&quot; group were found from Iran across south Asia to Indonesia. The three &quot;bokharensis&quot; subspecies were often treated as a separate species, &quot;Parus bokharensis&quot;, the Turkestan tit. This form was once thought to form a ring species around the Tibetan Plateau, with gene flow throughout the subspecies, but this theory was abandoned when sequences of mitochondrial DNA were examined, finding that the four groups were distinct (monophyletic) and that the hybridisation zones between the groups were the result of secondary contact after a temporary period of isolation.

A study published in 2005 confirmed that the &quot;major&quot; group was distinct from the &quot;cinereus&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; groups and that along with &quot;P. m. bokharensis&quot; it diverged from these two groups around 1.5 million years ago. The divergence between the &quot;bokharensis&quot; and &quot;major&quot; groups was estimated to have been about half a million years ago. The study also examined hybrids between representatives of the &quot;major&quot; and &quot;minor&quot; groups in the Amur Valley where the two meet. Hybrids were rare, suggesting that there were some reproductive barriers between the two groups. The study recommended that the two eastern groups be split out as new species, the cinereous tit (&quot;Parus cinereus&quot;), and the Japanese tit (&quot;Parus minor&quot;), but that the Turkestan tit be lumped in with the great tit. This taxonomy has been followed by some authorities, for example the &quot;IOC World Bird List&quot;. The &quot;Handbook of the Birds of the World&quot; volume treating the &quot;Parus&quot; species went for the more traditional classification, treating the Turkestan tit as a separate species but retaining the Japanese and cinereous tits with the great tit, a move that has not been without criticism.

The nominate subspecies of the great tit is the most widespread, its range stretching from the Iberian Peninsula to the Amur Valley and from Scandinavia to the Middle East. The other subspecies have much more restricted distributions, four being restricted to islands and the remainder of the &quot;P. m. major&quot; subspecies representing former glacial refuge populations. The dominance of a single, morphologically uniform subspecies over such a large area suggests that the nominate race rapidly recolonised a large area after the last glacial epoch. This hypothesis is supported by genetic studies which suggest a geologically recent genetic bottleneck followed by a rapid population expansion.

The genus &quot;Parus&quot; once held most of the species of tit in the family Paridae, but morphological and genetic studies led to the splitting of that large genus in 1998. The great tit was retained in &quot;Parus&quot;, which along with &quot;Cyanistes&quot; comprises a lineage of tits known as the &quot;non-hoarders&quot;, with reference to the hoarding behaviour of members of the other clade. The genus &quot;Parus&quot; is still the largest in the family, but may be split again. Other than those species formerly considered to be subspecies, the great tit&#x27;s closest relatives are the white-naped and green-backed tits of southern Asia. Hybrids with tits outside the genus &quot;Parus&quot; are very rare, but have been recorded with blue tit, coal tit, and probably marsh tit.

===Subspecies===
There are currently 15 recognised subspecies of great tit:

*&quot;P. m. newtoni&quot;, described by Pražák in 1894, is found across the British Isles.
*&quot;P. m. major&quot;, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is found throughout much of Europe, Asia Minor, northern and eastern Kazakhstan, southern Siberia and northern Mongolia, as far as the mid-Amur Valley.
*&quot;P. m. excelsus&quot;, described by Buvry in 1857, is found in northwestern Africa.
*&quot;P. m. corsus&quot;, described by Kleinschmidt in 1903, is found in Portugal, southern Spain, and Corsica.
*&quot;P. m. mallorcae&quot;, described by von Jordans in 1913, is found in the Balearic Islands.
*&quot;P. m. ecki&quot;, described by von Jordans in 1970, is found on Sardinia.
*&quot;P. m. niethammeri&quot;, described by von Jordans in 1970, is found on Crete.
*&quot;P. m. aphrodite&quot;, described by Madarász in 1901, is found in southern Italy, southern Greece, Cyprus and the Aegean Islands.
*&quot;P. m. terrasanctae&quot; was described by Hartert in 1910. It is found in Lebanon, Israel, Jordan and Syria.
*&quot;P. m. karelini&quot;, described by Zarudny in 1910, is found in southeastern Azerbaijan and northwestern Iran.
*&quot;P. m. blandfordi&quot; was described by Pražák in 1894. It is found in north central and southwestern Iran.
*&quot;P. m. bokharensis&quot; was described by Lichtenstein in 1823. It is found in southern Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan, Turkmenistan and far north of Iran and Afghanistan. It was, along with following two subspecies, once treated as separate species.
*&quot;P. m. turkestanicus&quot;, was described by Zarudny &amp; Loudon in 1905, and ranges from east Kazakhstan to extreme north west China and west Mongolia.
*&quot;P. m. ferghanensis&quot;, was described by Buturlin in 1912, and is found in Tajikistan and Kyrgyzstan.
*&quot;P. m. kapustini&quot;, was described by Portenko in 1954, and is found in north west China (north west Xinjiang) to Mongolia and Siberia.

==Description==
The great tit is large for a tit at in length, and has a distinctive appearance that makes it easy to recognise. The nominate race &quot;P. major major&quot; has a bluish-black crown, black neck, throat, bib and head, and white cheeks and ear coverts. The breast is bright lemon-yellow and there is a broad black mid-line stripe running from the bib to vent. There is a dull white spot on the neck turning to greenish yellow on the upper nape. The rest of the nape and back are green tinged with olive. The wing-coverts are green, the rest of the wing is bluish-grey with a white wing-bar. The tail is bluish grey with white outer tips. The plumage of the female is similar to that of the male except that the colours are overall duller; the bib is less intensely black, as is the line running down the belly, which is also narrower and sometimes broken. Young birds are like the female, except that they have dull olive-brown napes and necks, greyish rumps, and greyer tails, with less defined white tips.
There is some variation in the subspecies. &quot;P. m. newtoni&quot; is like the nominate race but has a slightly longer bill, the mantle is slightly deeper green, there is less white on the tail tips, and the ventral mid-line stripe is broader on the belly. &quot;P. m. corsus&quot; also resembles the nominate form but has duller upperparts, less white in the tail and less yellow in the nape. &quot;P. m. mallorcae&quot; is like the nominate subspecies, but has a larger bill, greyer-blue upperparts and slightly paler underparts. &quot;P. m. ecki&quot; is like &quot;P. m. mallorcae&quot; except with bluer upperparts and paler underparts. &quot;P. m. excelsus&quot; is similar to the nominate race but has much brighter green upperparts, bright yellow underparts and no (or very little) white on the tail. &quot;P. m. aphrodite&quot; has darker, more olive-grey upperparts, and the underparts are more yellow to pale cream. &quot;P. m. niethammeri&quot; is similar to &quot;P. m. aphrodite&quot; but the upperparts are duller and less green, and the underparts are pale yellow. &quot;P. m. terrasanctae&quot; resembles the previous two subspecies but has slightly paler upperparts. &quot;P. m. blandfordi&quot; is like the nominate but with a greyer mantle and scapulars and pale yellow underparts, and &quot;P. m. karelini&quot; is intermediate between the nominate and &quot;P. m. blandfordi&quot;, and lacks white on the tail. The plumage of &quot;P. m. bokharensis&quot; is much greyer, pale creamy white to washed out grey underparts, a larger white cheep patch, a grey tail, wings, back and nape. It is also slightly smaller, with a smaller bill but longer tail. The situation is similar for the two related subspecies in the Turkestan tit group. &quot;P. m. turkestanicus&quot; is like &quot;P. m. bokharensis&quot; but with a larger bill and darker upperparts. &quot;P. m. ferghanensis&quot; is like &quot;P. m. bokharensis&quot; but with a smaller bill, darker grey on the flanks and a more yellow wash on the juvenile birds.

The colour of the male bird&#x27;s breast has been shown to correlate with stronger sperm, and is one way that the male demonstrates his reproductive superiority to females. Higher levels of carotenoid increase the intensity of the yellow of the breast its colour, and also enable the sperm to better withstand the onslaught of free radicals. Carotenoids cannot be synthesized by the bird and have to be obtained from food, so a bright colour in a male demonstrates his ability to obtain good nutrition. However, the saturation of the yellow colour is also influenced by environmental factors, such as weather conditions. The width of the male&#x27;s ventral stripe, which varies with individual, is selected for by females, with higher quality females apparently selecting males with wider stripes.

===Voice===


The great tit is, like other tits, a vocal bird, and has up to 40 types of calls and songs. The calls are generally the same between the sexes, but the male is much more vocal and the female rarely calls. Soft single notes such as &quot;pit&quot;, &quot;spick&quot;, or &quot;chit&quot; are used as contact calls. A loud &quot;tink&quot; is used by adult males as an alarm or in territorial disputes. One of the most familiar is a &quot;teacher, teacher&quot;, often likened to a squeaky wheelbarrow wheel, which is used in proclaiming ownership of a territory. In former times, English folk considered the &quot;saw-sharpening&quot; call to be a foretelling of rain. Tit calls from different geographic regions show some variation, and tits from the two south Asian groups recently split from the great tit do not recognise or react to the calls of the temperate great tits.

One explanation for the great tit&#x27;s wide repertoire is the Beau Geste hypothesis. The eponymous hero of the novel propped dead soldiers against the battlements to give the impression that his fort was better defended than was really the case. Similarly, the multiplicity of calls gives the impression that the tit&#x27;s territory is more densely occupied than it actually is. Whether the theory is correct or not, those birds with large vocabularies are socially dominant and breed more successfully.

==Distribution, movements and habitat==
The great tit has a wide distribution across much of Eurasia. It can be found across all of Europe except for Iceland and northern Scandinavia, including numerous Mediterranean islands. In North Africa it lives in Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. It also occurs across the Middle East, and parts of Central Asia from northern Iran and Afghanistan to Mongolia, as well as across northern Asia from the Urals as far east as northern China and the Amur Valley.

The great tit occupies a range of habitats. It is most commonly found in open deciduous woodland, mixed forests, forest edges and gardens. In dense forests, including conifer forests it prefers forest clearings. In northern Siberia it lives in boreal taiga. In North Africa it rather resides in oak forests as well as stands of Atlas cedar and even palm groves. In the east of its range in Siberia, Mongolia and China it favours riverine willow and birch forest. Riverine woodlands of willows, poplars are among the habitats of the Turkestan subspecies, as well as low scrubland, oases; at higher altitudes it occupies habitats ranging from dense deciduous and coniferous forests to open areas with scattered trees.

The great tit is generally not migratory. Pairs will usually remain near or in their territory year round, even in the northern parts of their range. Young birds will disperse from their parents&#x27; territory, but usually not far. Populations may become irruptive in poor or harsh winters, meaning that groups of up to a thousand birds may unpredictably move from northern Europe to the Baltic and also to Netherlands, Britain, even as far as the southern Balkans.

The great tit was unsuccessfully introduced into the United States; birds were set free near Cincinnati, Ohio between 1872 and 1874 but failed to become established. Suggestions that they were an excellent control measure for codling moths nearly led to their introduction to some new areas particularly in the United States of America, however this plan was not implemented. A small population is present in the upper Midwest, believed to be the descendants of birds liberated in Chicago in 2002 along with European goldfinches, Eurasian jays, common chaffinches, European greenfinches, saffron finches, blue tits and Eurasian linnets, although sightings of some of these species pre-date the supposed introduction date. Birds were introduced to the Almaty Province in what is now Kazakhstan in 1960–61 and became established, although their present status is unclear.

==Behaviour==
===Diet and feeding===

Great tits are primarily insectivorous in the summer, feeding on insects and spiders which they capture by foliage gleaning. Their larger invertebrate prey include cockroaches, grasshoppers and crickets, lacewings, earwigs, bugs (Hemiptera), ants, flies (Diptera), caddisflies, beetles, scorpionflies, harvestmen, bees and wasps, snails and woodlice. During the breeding season, the tits prefer to feed protein-rich caterpillars to their young. A study published in 2007 found that great tits helped to reduce caterpillar damage in apple orchards by as much as 50%. Nestlings also undergo a period in their early development where they are fed a number of spiders, possibly for nutritional reasons. In autumn and winter, when insect prey becomes scarcer, great tits add berries and seeds to their diet. Seeds and fruit usually come from deciduous trees and shrubs, like for instance the seeds of beech and hazel. Where it is available they will readily take table scraps, peanuts and seeds from bird tables. In particularly severe winters they may consume 44% of their body weight in sunflower seeds. They often forage on the ground, particularly in years with high beech mast production. Great tits, along with other tits, will join winter mixed-species foraging flocks.
Large food items, such as large seeds or prey, are dealt with by &quot;hold-hammering&quot;, where the item is held with one or both feet and then struck with the bill until it is ready to eat. Using this method, a great tit can get into a hazelnut in about twenty minutes. When feeding young, adults will hammer off the heads of large insects to make them easier to consume, and remove the gut from caterpillars so that the tannins in the gut will not retard the chick&#x27;s growth.

Great tits combine dietary versatility with a considerable amount of intelligence and the ability to solve problems with insight learning, that is to solve a problem through insight rather than trial and error. In England, great tits learned to break the foil caps of milk bottles delivered at the doorstep of homes to obtain the cream at the top. This behaviour, first noted in 1921, spread rapidly in the next two decades. In 2009, great tits were reported killing, and eating the brains of roosting pipistrelle bats. This is the first time a songbird has been recorded preying on bats. The tits only do this during winter when the bats are hibernating and other food is scarce. They have also been recorded using tools, using a conifer needle in the bill to extract larvae from a hole in a tree.

===Breeding===
Great tits are monogamous breeders and establish breeding territories. These territories are established in late January and defence begins in late winter or early spring. Territories are usually reoccupied in successive years, even if one of the pair dies, so long as the brood is raised successfully. Females are likely to disperse to new territories if their nest is predated the previous year. If the pair divorces for some reason then the birds will disperse, with females travelling further than males to establish new territories. Although the great tit is socially monogamous, extra-pair copulations are frequent. One study in Germany found that 40% of nests contained some offspring fathered by parents other than the breeding male and that 8.5% of all chicks were the result of cuckoldry. Adult males tend to have a higher reproductive success compared to sub-adults.
Great tits are seasonal breeders. The exact timing of breeding varies by a number of factors, most importantly location. Most breeding occurs between January and September; in Europe the breeding season usually begins after March. In Israel there are exceptional records of breeding during the months of October to December. The amount of sunlight and daytime temperatures will also affect breeding timing. One study found a strong correlation between the timing of laying and the peak abundance of caterpillar prey, which is in turn correlated to temperature. On an individual level, younger females tend to start laying later than older females.

Great tits are cavity nesters, breeding in a hole that is usually inside a tree, although occasionally in a wall or rock face, and they will readily take to nest boxes. The nest inside the cavity is built by the female, and is made of plant fibres, grasses, moss, hair, wool and feathers. The number in the clutch is often very large, as many as 18, but five to twelve is more common. Clutch size is smaller when birds start laying later, and is also lower when the density of competitors is higher. Second broods tend to have smaller clutches. Insularity also affects clutch size, with great tits on offshore islands laying smaller clutches with larger eggs than mainland birds. The eggs are white with red spots. The female undertakes all incubation duties, and is fed by the male during incubation. The bird is a close sitter, hissing when disturbed. The timing of hatching, which is best synchronised with peak availability of prey, can be manipulated when environmental conditions change after the laying of the first egg by delaying the beginning of incubation, laying more eggs or pausing during incubation. The incubation period is between 12 and 15 days.

The chicks, like those of all tits, hatch unfeathered and blind. Once feathers begin to erupt, the nestlings are unusual for altricial birds in having plumage coloured with carotenoids similar to their parents (in most species it is dun-coloured to avoid predation). The nape is yellow and attracts the attention of the parents by its ultraviolet reflectance. This may be to make them easier to find in low light, or be a signal of fitness to win the parents&#x27; attention. This patch turns white after the first moult at age two months, and diminishes in size as the bird grows.

Chicks are fed by both parents, usually receiving of food a day. Both parents provision the chicks with food and aid in nest sanitation by removing faecal packets, with no difference in the feeding effort between the sexes. The nestling period is between 16 and 22 days, with chicks being independent of the parents eight days after fledging. Feeding of the fledgeling may continue after independence, lasting up to 25 days in chicks from the first brood, but as long as 50 days in the second brood. Nestlings from second broods have weaker immune systems and body condition than those from first broods, and hence have a lower juvenile survival rate.

Inbreeding depression occurs when the offspring produced as a result of a mating between close relatives show reduced fitness. The reduced fitness is generally considered to be a consequence of the increased expression of deleterious recessive alleles in these offspring. In natural populations of &quot;P. major&quot;, inbreeding is avoided by dispersal of individuals from their birthplace, which reduces the chance of mating with a close relative.

===Ecology===
The Eurasian sparrowhawk is a predator of great tits, with the young from second broods being at higher risk partly because of the hawk&#x27;s greater need for food for its own developing young. The nests of great tits are raided by great spotted woodpeckers, particularly when nesting in certain types of nest boxes. Other nest predators include introduced grey squirrels (in Britain) and least weasels, which are able to take nesting adults as well. A species of biting louse (Mallophaga) described as &quot;Rostrinirmus hudeci&quot; was isolated and described in 1981 from great tits in central Europe. The hen flea &quot;Ceratophyllus gallinae&quot; is exceedingly common in the nests of blue and great tits. It was originally a specialist tit flea, but the dry, crowded conditions of chicken runs enabled it to flourish with its new host. This flea is preferentially predated by the clown beetle &quot;Gnathoncus punctulatus&quot;, The rove beetle &quot;Microglotta pulla&quot; also feeds on fleas and their larvae. Although these beetles often remain in deserted nests, they can only breed in the elevated temperatures produced by brooding birds, tits being the preferred hosts. Great tits compete with the pied flycatcher for nesting boxes, and can kill prospecting flycatcher males. Incidences of fatal competition are more frequent when nesting times overlap, and climate change has led to greater synchrony of nesting between the two species and flycatcher deaths. Having killed the flycatchers, the great tits may consume their brains.

== Physiology ==
Great tits have been found to possess special physiological adaptations for cold environments. When preparing for winter months, the great tit can increase how thermogenic (heat producing) its blood is. The mechanism for this adaptation is a seasonal increase in mitochondrial volume and mitochondrial respiration in red blood cells and increased uncoupling of the electron transport from ATP production. As a result, the energy that would have been used to make ATP is released as heat and their blood becomes more thermogenic. In the face of winter food shortages, the great tit has also shown a type of peripheral vasoconstriction (constriction of blood vessels) to reduce heat loss and cold injury. Reduced cold injury and heat loss is mediated by the great tits&#x27; counter-current vascular arrangements, and peripheral vasoconstriction in major vessels in and around the birds&#x27; bill and legs. This mechanism allows uninsulated regions (i.e., bill and legs) to remain close to the surrounding temperature. In response to food restriction, the great tits&#x27; bill temperature dropped, and once food availably was increased, bill temperatures gradually returned to normal. Vasoconstriction of blood vessels in the bill not only serves as an energy saving mechanism, but also reduces the amount of heat transferred from core body tissues to the skin (via cutaneous vasodilation), which, in turn, reduces heat loss rate by lowering skin temperature relative to the environment.

==Relationship with humans==

The great tit is a popular garden bird due to its acrobatic performances when feeding on nuts or seed. Its willingness to move into nest boxes has made it a valuable study subject in ornithology; it has been particularly useful as a model for the study of the evolution of various life-history traits, particularly clutch size. A study of a literature database search found 1,349 articles relating to &quot;Parus major&quot; for the period between 1969 and 2002.

The great tit has generally adjusted to human modifications of the environment. It is more common and has better breeding success in areas with undisturbed forest cover, but it has adapted well to human-modified habitats, and can be very common in urban areas. For example, the breeding population in the city of Sheffield (a city of half a million people) has been estimated at some 17,000 individuals. In adapting to human environments its song has been observed to change in noise-polluted urban environments. In areas with low frequency background noise pollution, the song has a higher frequency than in quieter areas. This tit has expanded its range, moving northwards into Scandinavia and Scotland, and south into Israel and Egypt. The total population is estimated at between 300 and 1,100 million birds in a range of 32.4 million km2 (12.5 million sq mi). While there have been some localised declines in population in areas with poorer quality habitats, its large range and high numbers mean that the great tit is not considered to be threatened, and it is classed as least concern on the IUCN Red List.

<doc id="248753" wikidata="Q336410" url="?curid=248753" title="Hibonite">
<text>Hibonite is a mineral with the chemical formula , occurring in various colours, with a hardness of 7.5–8.0 and a hexagonal crystal structure. It is rare, but is found in high-grade metamorphic rocks on Madagascar. Some presolar grains in primitive meteorites consist of hibonite. Hibonite also is a common mineral in the Ca-Al-rich inclusions found in some chondritic meteorites. Hibonite is closely related to hibonite-Fe (IMA 2009-027, ) an alteration mineral from the Allende meteorite. Hibonites were among the first minerals to form as the disk of gas and dust swirling around the young sun cooled.

A very rare gem, hibonite was discovered in 1953 in Madagascar by Paul Hibon, a French prospector.

==Colour==
Hibonite can vary in colour, from a bright blue, to green, to orange, to a nearly black deep brown. The colour is related to the degree of oxidation; meteoritic hibonite tends to be blue.

<doc id="248760" wikidata="Q2379886" url="?curid=248760" title="Bambi Meets Godzilla">
<text>Bambi Meets Godzilla is a 1969 black-and-white animated short student film produced entirely by Marv Newland. Less than two minutes long, the film is seen as a classic of animation; it was listed #38 in the book &quot;The 50 Greatest Cartoons&quot; (1994).

==Plot==
The opening credits, consisting of roles filled by Newland himself, scroll over an image of the fawn Bambi serenely grazing on a field of grass and flowers while the Chicago Symphony Orchestra&#x27;s recording of &quot;William Tell&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Ranz des Vaches&quot; plays in the background. After the credits, Bambi looks up to see Godzilla&#x27;s foot coming down, squashing him flat (set to the final chord of the Beatles&#x27; &quot;A Day in the Life&quot;). After a moment, the closing credits appear alongside the image of Godzilla&#x27;s foot atop Bambi. The closing credits give acknowledgement to Tokyo &quot;for their help in obtaining Godzilla for this film&quot;. Godzilla&#x27;s toe claws wiggle once and the cartoon ends.

==Screenings and distribution==
In 1973, &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; was paired with John Magnuson&#x27;s &quot;Thank You Mask Man&quot; by Randy Finley and Specialty Films in Seattle and released widely under the title &quot;The King of Hearts and His Loyal Short Subjects&quot;. The program ran in repertory theaters across America for several years. The short was also included on VHS home video releases of &quot;Godzilla 1985&quot; and &quot;Fantastic Animation Festival&quot;.

The Academy Film Archive preserved &quot;Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; in 2009.

==Sequels and remakes==
* In 1976, the black-and-white sequel &quot;Bambi&#x27;s Revenge&quot; was released.
* In 1999, the 3D-animated color sequel &quot;Son of Bambi Meets Godzilla&quot; was released.
* In 2013, animator Coda Gardner made a frame-by-frame recreation of the original via tracing the film frames and assembling the animation via digital video editing.
* In 2015, a live action remake was created by Scotty Fields.

<text>Carcassonne () is a tile-based German-style board game for two to five players, designed by Klaus-Jürgen Wrede and published in 2000 by Hans im Glück in German and by Rio Grande Games (until 2012) and Z-Man Games (currently) in English. It received the Spiel des Jahres and the Deutscher Spiele Preis awards in 2001.

It is named after the medieval fortified town of Carcassonne in southern France, famed for its city walls. The game has spawned many expansions and spin-offs, and several PC, console, and mobile versions. A new edition, with updated artwork on the tiles and the box, was released in 2014.

==Gameplay==

The game board is a medieval landscape built by the players as the game progresses. The game starts with a single specific terrain tile face up and 71 others shuffled face down for the players to draw from. Each player&#x27;s turn consists of three distinct phases:

# Draw and place a terrain tile
# Station a follower on the newly placed tile (optional)
# Score completed feature(s) (if relevant)
To start each turn, a player draws a new terrain tile and places it adjacent to tiles that are already face up. The new tile must be placed in a way that extends terrain features on the tiles it touches: roads must connect to roads, fields to fields, and cities to cities. Connections are made across adjacent edges only; corners do not connect. A &quot;cloister&quot; tile may be placed adjacent to another &quot;cloister&quot; tile, as there are no connecting features. If the newly drawn tile cannot be placed anywhere legally, the players may choose to remove the tile from the game, or return it to the draw pile.
After placing each newly drawn tile, the placing player may opt to station a marker (called a &quot;follower&quot; or &quot;meeple&quot;) on a terrain feature (i.e., a &quot;road&quot;, &quot;city&quot;, &quot;cloister&quot;, or &quot;field&quot;) of that newly placed tile to claim control of it. However, if the feature is connected to a feature already claimed by another player, the follower cannot be stationed on that feature. When stationing a follower, the marker is placed upright on the feature to claim that feature, except for a &quot;field&quot;, where the follower is laid down instead to emphasize that fields are not scored until the end of the game; the follower&#x27;s role depends on the feature claimed, changing from thief/highwayman (&quot;road&quot;) to knight (&quot;city&quot;), monk (&quot;cloister&quot; or &quot;monastery&quot;), or farmer (&quot;field&quot;). It is possible for terrain features to become &quot;shared&quot; by opposing players when tile(s) are placed in subsequent turns that connect previously unconnected features. For example, two separate fields (each with a follower/farmer) can become connected into a single field subsequently by a newly placed terrain tile.

If any feature (except a &quot;field&quot;) is completed during a player&#x27;s turn, the score for the completed feature is counted for the player that controls that feature; after scoring, the controlling &quot;meeple&quot; is removed from the board and returned to the player&#x27;s stock. Each player has eight followers; since one is used to keep track of the player&#x27;s score, only seven can be in play at any moment.

The game ends when the last tile has been placed. At that time, all incomplete features (including fields) score points for the players with the most followers on them. The player with the most points wins the game.
===Scoring===
During each player&#x27;s turn, completed cities, cloisters, and roads (but not fields) are scored before that player&#x27;s turn ends. A player may complete a feature by drawing and placing a tile, claim it by stationing a follower on the newly placed tile, and receive the score for completing it all in the same turn, but the sequence of that turn means the player cannot redeploy the follower after it is returned to their stock. The stationing phase of the turn was completed by claiming the completed feature.

Cities are completed when they contain no unfinished edges from which they may be expanded, roads are similarly completed when they have closed both ends or form a loop, and cloisters are completed when surrounded by eight tiles. Points are awarded to the players with the most followers in a feature. If there is a tie for the most followers in any given feature, all of the tied players are awarded the full number of points. Once a city, cloister, or road feature is scored, all of the followers in that feature are returned to their owners. In general (see table), points are awarded for the number of tiles covered by a feature; a completed cloister scores nine points for the cloister plus eight neighboring tiles.

At the end of the game, when there are no tiles remaining, fields and all other claimed but incomplete features are scored. The score of each field is based on the number of &quot;completed&quot; cities that field touches. It is possible for a field to be completely enclosed by a road without touching any completed cities, or a field can touch only incomplete cities, in which case those fields will score no points.

====Older editions====
There are two older editions of &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, differing in scoring of cities and fields. The current scoring rules were introduced in the German version in 2004, but until 2008, the first edition scoring rules were still included with the English releases of &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, third edition rules are now included with all editions (including the Xbox 360 and travel versions), and are assumed by all expansions in all languages.

In the first and second editions of the game, completed cities covering just two tiles scored two points (one per tile) and one extra point for every pennant that resides in the city. This exception is removed from the third edition, in which there is no difference between &quot;small&quot; two-tile cities and cities of larger size.

The greatest divergence in scoring rules between the editions of &quot;Carcassonne&quot; is in scoring for fields. In the first edition, fields were considered from the point of view of the cities. The player(s) with the greatest number of farmer/followers adjacent to a city were awarded four points for that city. Thus, followers from different fields contributed to the scoring for a city, and followers on a field may contribute to the scoring for multiple cities. The second edition considered different fields separately – for each field, the players with the greatest number of followers in a field scored three points for each city adjacent to the field, although points were only scored once for any given city. The third edition removes these exceptions and brings field scoring in line with the scoring of other features.

===Examples===

Consider the sample game #1 in progress on the 5×5 board shown; there are four complete &quot;cities&quot;: [B1]*[C1]*[C2] scoring eight points (three tiles plus one pennant) and three two-tile, four-point cities [C3]*[D3], [D3]*[E3], and [C4]*[C5]. There are two complete roads, scoring two points each: [A2]—[B2] and [B1]—[B2].

The largest &quot;field&quot;, bounded on the north by the roads in [A2]—[B2]—[C2], touches the two complete cities [C3]*[D3] and [C4]*[C5] and would score six points at the end of the game, more if the incomplete cities at [A2] and [C4]*[D4] are completed . In addition, the field could be extended by an appropriate piece in [D2] to touch the complete city [D3]*[E3].


Consider sample game #2 on the 6×10 board. In this example, followers are stationed on the board according to the capital first letter of the color name: &quot;R&quot;ed, &quot;Y&quot;ellow, &quot;G&quot;reen, &quot;B&quot;lue, and &quot;P&quot;urple, where purple is substituted for &quot;B&quot;lack to avoid confusion with blue.

There are three completed cities at [C2]*[D2]*[C3]*[D3], [F1]*[E2]*[F2]*[F3] and [H2]*[I2]. It is not possible to complete the city at [G4]*[G5]*[G6]; by examination of the available tiles, there is no tile that will fit in [H5] to continue all four edges, which also means the city in [H6] cannot be completed.

Similarly, because any piece that can be placed in [E1] must continue the three bordering edges, that piece in [E1] will connect the two fields that are currently claimed by the green farmer in [G1] and the red farmers in [C2] and [D2] alongside the yellow farmers in [H4], [H1], and [J3]. If no one else adds a farmer, yellow would claim the field by having the most followers in that merged field. The other shared-field situation is the red farmer in [D4] sharing a field with one blue farmer in [G5]. However, if a tile is played at [F6], it will connect to the field to the southeast; even though blue would have two farmers in the merged field, including the farmer in [G6], and would control the merged field, that field still does not touch any completed cities and would score no points unless the city at [C6]*[D6]*[E6] is completed.

There are two fields that have been completed and enclosed by loop roads in [I1]+[I2]+[J2]+[J1] and [C3]+[D3]+[E3]+[F3]+[F4]+[E4]+[D4]+[C4]. Neither of these fields touch any completed cities and so they would each score zero points. The Green farmer in [C5] is at risk of being enclosed in a loop and cut off from any completed cities.

The three cloisters at [H3], [E5], and [F5] include stationed monks because they are not completely surrounded by eight tiles; the two cloisters that are surrounded, at [G3] and [D5], are vacant because the claiming player(s) have scored those points. A tile played at [F6] would complete the surroundings for the blue monks at [E5] and [F5], scoring eighteen points for those followers.

Red has one knight follower in [D1], two thief followers in [B3] and [C4], and three farmer followers in [C2], [D2], and [D4]; this means that Red has only one follower remaining that can be stationed unless the roads or city are completed to score and return those followers to their stock. In contrast, purple only has one monk follower on the board at [H3] at this time, but that monk is effectively stranded until the end of the game: there is no possible tile that can be played in [I3] as there are only two single-road tiles (with a cloister) and those are already on the board at [H3] and [D5]. However, that monk will score eight points (one for the cloister and seven for the surrounding tiles) at the end of the game. Worse, the green knight follower in [H6] will not score any points and is stranded because the city will never be completed. Yellow has three farmer followers, one knight [J4], and one thief [I5]; both the knight and thief remain active and can be returned by completing that city and road, respectively.

===Tiles===
The original board game has 72 tiles with city, field, and road features; the River mini-expansion adds 12 tiles with river features. The version of the game currently in print includes the River and Abbot mini-expansions.
The river tiles are used as an alternative to the standard CRFR start tile and have the same dark-colored back to indicate this. The starting river tile is called the source (a river tile with a single river edge) and the final river tile is called the lake (again with a single river edge); players take turns placing all twelve river tiles to start the game, including follower placement and scoring, if relevant, then after the lake river tile has been played, proceed to place the remaining 71 terrain tiles.

====Nomenclature====
Kárná used a four-character tile code which described the feature on each edge of the tile as either a road (R), meadow (M, aka field), or city (C), written clockwise from an arbitrary starting edge. For instance, CRMR (modified as CRFR to conform with the terminology of this article) would describe the starting tile, starting from the top edge. With three possibilities for each edge, theoretically there are 81 (=34) possible tile combinations, but as some are duplicates because the tiles may be rotated arbitrarily, there are actually 24 possible combinations. Capaldi and Kolba, professors of mathematics at Valparaiso University, also counted 24 distinct types amongst the 71 non-river tiles of the starting set, although 5 of these were duplicates of other terrain tiles with the addition of pennant/coat of arms features. They assigned a single letter to each of the 24 types.

==Reception==
&quot;Carcassonne&quot; is considered to be an excellent &quot;gateway game&quot; by many board game players as it is a game that can be used to introduce new players to board games. In a 2017 Ars Technica holiday buyer&#x27;s guide, it was described as &quot;one of the absolutely foundational games of the modern board gaming hobby&quot;.

The rules are simple, no one is ever eliminated, and the play is fast. A typical game, without any expansions, takes about 35 minutes to play. There is a substantial luck component to the game; however, good tactics greatly improve one&#x27;s chances of winning. Examples of tactical considerations include:
* Conserving followers. Since each player has only seven followers, it can be easy to run out. This is especially important with fewer players, because then each player will play more tiles during the game.
* Joining in on other players&#x27; features. Often it is possible to add a separate road or castle segment near a big road or castle and join them up. This allows a player to gain points from their opponents&#x27; work.
* Avoiding sharing. An advantage can be gained by preventing other players from getting points. This is more important with fewer players, or if the sharing player is doing well.
* Judicious placement of followers in fields. Followers in the right field can be worth a lot of points. However, once placed, they are there for the whole game.
* Trapping opponents&#x27; followers. Not all possible tile configurations exist in the game. So if a player knows which tiles exist or are more common, they can create situations where it is hard or impossible for an opponent to complete some feature. The result is the opponent&#x27;s follower is stuck in something half-completed.
The game has been used in education to teach geographical concepts.

* Twelve tiles depicting the city of Carcassonne itself. These replace the initial starting tile and support new game mechanics.
* A count figure, which can block paratrooping.

;Carcassonne — The River II (Der Fluss II, November 2005): Similar to the original &quot;River&quot; expansion, &quot;The River II&quot; tiles include features from previous expansions, for example a volcano to invoke the dragon.

==Spin-offs==

Following the success of &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, a number of games have been spun off from the main game, all sharing similar mechanics. There is also a travel-sized version of the original game, &quot;Travel Carcassonne&quot; (&quot;Reise-Carcassonne&quot;), released in 2007.
;&quot;&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Die Jäger und Sammler&quot;, 2002): &quot;Hunters and Gatherers&quot; is a stand-alone game that involves the building of forests, rivers and wildlife rather than cities and roads. This game attempted to rectify some perceived faults in the original by eliminating cloisters, introducing a &quot;special tile&quot; system to encourage players to complete cities (now forests) owned by other players, and making the value of meadows vary both up and down with animals that appear on the tiles.
;&quot;The Ark of the Covenant&quot; (2003): &quot;Ark&quot; is a biblical-themed version of &quot;Carcassonne&quot; by Inspiration Games based on the Old Testament, which includes the animal feature found in &quot;Hunters and Gatherers&quot;, as well as the Ark itself which may be moved in lieu of follower placement, scoring points for followers that they pass through.
;&quot;&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Die Burg&quot;, 2003): &quot;The Castle&quot; is a two-player spin-off, designed by Reiner Knizia, where the game is played within the confines of a fixed castle. Players gain extra abilities by scoring an exact number of points, and tile placement rules are relaxed. A downloadable expansion called &quot;The Falcon&quot; was released in 2015.
;&quot;&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Die Stadt&quot;, 2004): &quot;The City&quot; is a &quot;deluxe-style&quot; stand-alone game similar to &quot;The Castle&quot;, where tile placement is relaxed. The significant new rules involve the addition of city walls when the city grows beyond a certain size.
;&quot;Carcassonne: The Discovery&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Neues Land&quot;, 2005): An exploration-themed stand-alone game that involves mountains, seas and meadows. The significant change in this game is that followers are no longer automatically removed when a terrain feature is completed: they must be removed as a game action, in lieu of placing a new follower that turn. Players may choose to remove a follower from, and score for, a terrain feature before it is completed, albeit for fewer points; followers remaining on the map at the end of the game also suffer a score penalty even if the features they are standing on are completed.
;&quot;New World: A Carcassonne Game&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Mayflower&quot;, 2008): &quot;New World&quot; is a stand-alone game that allows players to play Carcassonne in the New World, aka America. Players begin the basic tile-laying from a coastal edge and move westward, creating towns, hunting, farming, and trail blazing as they go along. Although terminology has changed, this game follows the basic rules of &quot;Carcassonne&quot; very closely but is more restricted than the basic game.
;&quot;My First Carcassonne&quot; (&quot;Die Kinder von Carcassonne&quot;, 2009): Unveiled at the Nuremberg International Toy Fair in February 2009 this is a short game for younger children inspired by &quot;Carcassonne&quot;, designed by Marco Teubner.
;&quot;Cardcassonne&quot; (2009): This is a card game based on Carcassonne.
;&quot;Carcassonne: The Dice Game&quot;, 2011: A set of 9 specialized dice with city segments, meeples, and catapults, where players roll the dice to create cities to gain points.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Winter Edition&quot; (2012): is a standalone Carcassonne game where the tiles are depicted with Winter Snow, the set contains the base-72-tiles plus an additional 12 tiles . An expansion called &quot;The Gingerbreadman&quot; was released in 2012.

;&quot;Carcassonne: South Seas&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Südsee&quot;, 2013): &quot;South Seas&quot; is the first title in the &quot;Carcassonne: Around the World&quot; series. A tropical-themed version, varying gameplay by adding a resource element that affects the point score. An expansion called &quot;Friday&quot; was released in 2013.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Gold Rush&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Goldrausch&quot;, 2014): &quot;Gold Rush&quot; is the second title in the &quot;Carcassonne: Around the World&quot; series of tile-laying games. &quot;Gold Rush&quot;, players return to the 19th century in the United States. Players mine for gold and complete railroads to score points. A new mechanic is the Tent which can be used to steal Golden Tokens from other players before they complete their mountain. An expansion called &quot;The Sheriff&quot; was released in 2014.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Over Hill and Dale&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Über Stock und Stein&quot;, 2015): &quot;Over Hill and Dale&quot; is a standalone game in the Carcassonne series. In this new game, towns and castles are replaced by fields of fruits and vegetables. Fruit is collected, stables are built to house animals, and paths can be walked down to score points.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Star Wars&quot; (&quot;Carcassonne: Star Wars&quot;, 2015): In this &quot;Star Wars&quot; version, the known rules of &quot;Carcassonne&quot; are simplified by removing the farmer mechanic, but Cloisters are replaced with Planets that can be attacked, by rolling dice to beat one&#x27;s opponent. Co-op play is introduced with a 2v2 mechanism. A boxed expansion for this game was released in 2016.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Amazonas&quot; (2016): &quot;Amazonas&quot; is the third title in the &quot;Carcassonne: Around the World&quot; series. It takes players to the Amazon rainforest, where players can expand villages, forests, and the Amazon River and tributaries.
;&quot;Carcassonne: Safari&quot; (2018): &quot;Safari&quot; is the fourth title in the &quot;Carcassonne: Around the World&quot; series.

==Tournaments==

The format of competitive Carcassonne tournaments is to use only the base game of Carcassonne (the original 72 tiles) and for games to be between only two players.

International &quot;Carcassonne&quot; tournaments were held in Germany in 2003–2005.

===World Championship===

The first official &quot;Carcassonne&quot; World Championship was held at SPIEL in Essen, Germany, in 2006. An annual world championship has been held at SPIEL every year since 2006 with the exceptions of the 2010 and the 2023 championships, which were held during SPIEL but at an alternate location in Herne, Germany; and the 2020 edition which was cancelled due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Qualification for the World Championship is primarily reserved for national champions, along with the defending World Champion. Since 2023 a number of additional wildcard qualifications have been granted. This has included the winner of the Mind Sports Olympiad online championship, and top ranking teams of the World Teams Online Championship. In the 2021, each country was allowed to participate with two players, following the cancellation of the 2020 edition.

Ralph Querfurth has been the World Champion in four editions. Pantelis Litsardopoulos is the only other player to have won the World Championship on more than one occasion, having reached the final in five consecutive years. Els Bulten is the only female champion. 

===Mind Sports Olympiad===

Since 2020 the Mind Sports Olympiad have run open international tournaments in a similar format to the World Championships. For 2020 and 2021 only an online tournament was held, but since 2022 both online and in-person tournaments have been held in London.

In-Person MSO Tournaments

===World Team Carcassonne Online Championship===

As a result of the cancellation of World Championship in 2020, the community of Carcassonne Catalonia decided to create an online world championship for teams, to be played online for several weeks on the online platform Board Game Arena. Named &quot;World Team Carcassonne Online Championship&quot; (WTCOC), the format of the tournament is for each match to have 5 players selected by both teams. Each player is paired with an opponent who they play a best-of-3 games to make up a &#x27;Duel&#x27;. The winner of each duel scores a point for their team in the match.

From the start of the second edition, in 2021, the WTCOC has been officially sanctioned by the publisher Hans Im Glück and World Championship organisers Spielezentrum. Beginning in 2023 the top 4 teams in the WTCOC have been able to send an extra participant to the World Championships in Germany. This was reduced to the top 3 teams in 2024.

<doc id="248782" wikidata="Q1635231" url="?curid=248782" title="Battle of Hexham">
<text>The Battle of Hexham, 15 May 1464, marked the end of significant Lancastrian resistance in the north of England during the early part of the reign of Edward IV.

The battle was fought near the town of Hexham in Northumberland. John Neville, later to be 1st Marquess of Montagu, led a modest force of 3,000-4,000 men, and routed the rebel Lancastrians. Most of the rebel leaders were captured and executed, including Henry Beaufort, Duke of Somerset, and Lord Hungerford. Henry VI, however, was kept safely away (having been captured in battle three times earlier), and escaped to the north.

With their leadership gone, only a few castles remained in rebel hands. After these fell later in the year, Edward IV was not seriously challenged until the Earl of Warwick changed his allegiance from the Yorkist to the Lancastrian cause in 1469.

==Before==
After the Battle of Towton, the Lancastrians failed to prevent the Yorkists from concluding peace negotiations with Scotland in 1463, and soon found that their northern base of operations was now threatened. It was decided to mount a campaign in the north of England to gather Lancastrian support before a huge force under Edward IV could muster in Leicester and move north to crush the rebellion.

The Lancastrian army moved through Northumberland in late April 1464 under the Duke of Somerset, and gathered support from Lancastrian garrisons. After the Lancastrians lost the Battle of Hedgeley Moor on 25 April 1464 to a Yorkist force led by John Neville, Lord Montagu, the Lancastrians again met Neville, this time near Hexham. The two sides met outside Hexham on 14 May 1464.

==Battle==

Details of the site of the battle, the composition and number of combatants and the events are sketchy but it is thought that the battle was relatively bloodless.

The Lancastrian camp was near Linnels Bridge over the Devil&#x27;s Water found slightly to the south of Hexham. The Yorkists crossed onto the south bank of the Tyne on the night of 12–13 May and were, by the morning of the 14th, in a position to attack Hexham. Presumably the Yorkist advance was at speed, as despite warnings by their own scouts the Lancastrians had little time to prepare for battle.

It is thought that Somerset rushed his forces to a site near Linnels Bridge and deployed his troops in three detachments in a meadow near the Devil&#x27;s Water, there he hoped he could engage the Yorkist army before it moved past him into Hexham. No sooner had the Lancastrians taken their positions than the Yorkists charged down from their positions on higher ground. Upon seeing the Yorkist advance the right detachment of the Lancastrian army, commanded by Lord Roos, turned and fled across the Devil&#x27;s Water and into Hexham, before a single blow had been struck. The remnants of Somerset&#x27;s force were in a hopeless situation, hemmed in and unable to manoeuvre; the Yorkist troops charged through the one opening at the east end of Linnel&#x27;s Meadow and engaged the bewildered Lancastrian soldiers.

Lancastrian morale collapsed, and after some token resistance the remains of Somerset&#x27;s army was pushed into the Devil&#x27;s Water by the Yorkist infantry. A chaotic rout followed, men either drowned in the river or were crushed as they tried to climb the steep banks of the Devil&#x27;s Water in the retreat towards Hexham. Most, however, were trapped in West Dipton Wood on the north bank of the river and were forced to surrender when the Yorkists approached.

==Aftermath==
Neville showed little of Edward&#x27;s conciliatory spirit, and had thirty leading Lancastrians executed in Hexham on the evening following the battle, including Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset, and Lord Roos. William Tailboys was captured and executed shortly after he tried to flee north with £2,000 of Henry&#x27;s war chest. Upon the loss of its leadership and bankroll, the Lancastrian resistance in the North of England collapsed.

Following his defeat in the Battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464, Henry VI found refuge, sheltered by Lancastrian supporters, at houses across the north of England. Following stays at Muncaster Castle on the Cumbrian coast and at nearby Bolton Hall, he was in hiding at Waddington Hall, in Waddington, Lancashire, the home of Richard Tempest. Here, he was betrayed by &quot;a black monk of Addington&quot; and on 13 July 1465, a group of Yorkist men, including Richard&#x27;s brother John, entered the home to arrest him. Henry VI fled into nearby woods but was soon captured. This meant that the rebellion was effectively over. There followed a relative period of peace until the Earl of Warwick&#x27;s defection to the Lancastrian cause in 1469 and the wars started anew.

<text>The terms independent animation or indie animation refers to animated shorts, web series, and feature films produced outside a major national animation industry.

== United States ==
In America, working independent 
animators included Mary Ellen Bute, John Whitney, Harry Everett Smith and Oskar Fischinger alongside earlier efforts of what would later become UPA.

In 1959, The Academy Awards witnessed the first independent animated film to win an Oscar with John Hubley&#x27;s &quot;Moonbird&quot; which was also produced by wife and collaborator Faith Hubley using limited animation to tell their own personal stories.

Jordan Belson, Robert Breer and Stan Vanderbeek made groundbreaking experimental animation during this time.

Avant-garde animator Carmen D&#x27;Avino&#x27;s Oscar-nominated &quot;Pianissimo&quot; (1963) was distributed by none other than Amos Vogel&#x27;s legendary Cinema 16.

Other independent animators during this time included Charles Braverman, Gene Deitch,
Fred Mogubgub, Fred Wolf and Will Vinton. The latter two would go on to win Academy Awards for Best Animated Short Film along with the works of the Hubleys and Ernest Pintoff starting in the late 1950s-early 1960s.
In the late 1960s, animator Ralph Bakshi and producer Steve Krantz founded Bakshi Productions, establishing the studio as an alternative to mainstream animation by producing animation his own way and accelerating the advancement of female and minority animators. He also paid his employees a higher salary than any other studio at that time. In 1969, Ralph&#x27;s Spot was founded as a division of Bakshi Productions to produce commercials for Coca-Cola and &quot;Max, the 2000-Year-Old Mouse&quot;, a series of educational shorts paid for by Encyclopædia Britannica. However, Bakshi was uninterested in the kind of animation he was producing, and wanted to produce something personal. Bakshi soon developed &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot;, a tale of inner-city street life. However, Krantz told Bakshi that studio executives would be unwilling to fund the film because of its content and Bakshi&#x27;s lack of film experience. While browsing the East Side Book Store on St. Mark&#x27;s Place, Bakshi came across a copy of R. Crumb&#x27;s &quot;Fritz the Cat&quot;. Impressed by Crumb&#x27;s sharp satire, Bakshi purchased the book and suggested to Krantz that it would work as a film.

&quot;Fritz the Cat&quot; (1972) was the first animated film to receive an X rating from the MPAA, and the highest grossing independent animated film of all time. Bakshi then simultaneously directed a number of animated films, starting with &quot;Heavy Traffic&quot; a year later. Ralph Bakshi became the first person in the animation industry since Walt Disney to have two financially successful films released back-to-back.

Alongside Bakshi came other independent animated features of the 70s and 80s (some made by former Disney animators) such as John David Wilson&#x27;s &quot;Shinbone Alley&quot; (1971), Don Bluth&#x27;s &quot;The Secret of NIMH&quot; (1982), Vinton&#x27;s &quot;The Adventures of Mark Twain&quot; (1985) and Jerry Rees&#x27;s cult classic &quot;The Brave Little Toaster&quot; (1987).

Notable award-winning films also from the 70s and 80s included Dale Case and Bob Mitchell&#x27;s &quot;The Further Adventures of Uncle Sam&quot; (1970), Ted Petok&#x27;s &quot;The Crunch Bird&quot; (1971), Frank Mouris&#x27;s &quot;Frank Film&quot; (1973) and Jimmy Picker&#x27;s &quot;Sundae in New York&quot; (1983).

Animation historians John Canemaker and Michael Sporn also made independent animation in New York, both earning Oscar nods for their work (only Canemaker won in 2005).

Other animators like Candy Kugel, Jeff Scher, Joanna Priestley, Kathy Rose, Suzan Pitt, Robert Swarthe, Vince Collins, Barrie Nelson, Eli Noyes, Sky David (aka Dennis Pies), Steve Segal, Mike Jittlov,
Paul Fierlinger, Adam Beckett, Lillian Schwartz, Larry Cuba and George Griffin also made experimental and personal animation during the mid- to late 1970s through the early- to mid-1980s.

In the 1970s, independent animator Sally Cruikshank (known for the 1975 cult short &quot;Quasi at the Quackadero&quot; alongside animated segments for &quot;Sesame Street&quot;) continued to explore independent and D.I.Y. distribution options, but were still largely met with rejection even though her work is now considered ground breaking.

Collections of independent films have been gathered for theatrical viewing, and video release, under such titles as the International Tournee of Animation (which existed between about 1965 and ended in the late 1990s), Spike and Mike&#x27;s &quot;Classic Festival of Animation&quot; (1977 to 1990) and Spike and Mike&#x27;s Sick and Twisted Festival of Animation since 1990. Contemporary independent animators, including Steven Subotnick, Bill Plympton, Don Hertzfeldt, Nina Paley and PES have also made work outside of the studio system.

=== Later independent animation ===

The rise of the Internet in the 1990s and 2000s saw an exponential increase in the production of independent animation which included personal independent works by Timothy Hittle, Janie Geiser, John R. Dilworth, Lewis Klahr and John Schnall. Personal computer power increased to the point where it was possible for a single person to produce an animated cartoon on a home computer, using software such as Flash, and distribute these short films over the World Wide Web. Independently produced Internet cartoons flourished as the popularity of the Web grew, and a number of strange, often hilarious short cartoons were produced for the Web.

In the late 1990s, an independent animated short film called &quot;The Spirit of Christmas&quot; was produced for under $2,000 by two artists, Matt Stone and Trey Parker. This film was widely distributed on the Internet as a pirated cartoon, and its phenomenal popularity gave rise to the popular television animated series &quot;South Park.&quot; Limited 1990s bandwidth made streaming difficult, if not impossible. While some animators like Spümcø&#x27;s John K. opted to use Flash, it still required a plug-in making it unviewable in many early web browsers. Other early online animators like M. Wartella opted to use the Animated GIF to overcome these limitations and create early web-based animation viewable through all browsers.

Independent animation in the 2000s included animated features such as Paley&#x27;s &quot;Sita Sings the Blues&quot;, Christiane Cegavske&#x27;s &quot;Blood Tea and Red String&quot;, the CGI-animated features &quot;Hoodwinked!&quot; and &quot;Barnyard&quot; and Indiewood director Wes Anderson&#x27;s first foray into animation territory: his 2009 stop motion adaptation of Roland Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Fantastic Mr. Fox&quot;.

By the mid-to-late 2000s YouTube and the Internet and like-minded online video distribution, in addition to independent broadcasting sites that followed, proved to be a dominant form of independently distributed, broadcast, edited, and produced animation TV shows, anime, feature films, music videos, retro animation, commercials, trailers, original online animation content, and web exclusives (which would otherwise not stand a chance of seeing airtime on more normal and expensive forms of mainstream broadcasting on most television networks, which still continue to function on a more traditional distribution matrix). &quot;Annoying Orange&quot;, which started off as a series of viral quasi-CGI animated comedy shorts on YouTube, quickly gained a cult following and an excess of 100 million views online. It is an example of an animated web series to transition between Internet and television distribution successfully, as an animated series on Cartoon Network.

Recent independent animations released on YouTube include the adult animated web series &quot;Helluva Boss&quot;, and pilots for &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, &quot;Long Gone Gulch&quot;, &quot;Murder Drones&quot;, &quot;Lackadaisy&quot; and &quot;The Amazing Digital Circus&quot;. While &quot;Helluva Boss&quot; and &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot; are made by independent animator Vivienne Medrano, &quot;Long Gone Gulch&quot; was written and produced by Tara Billinger and Zach Bellissimo, who had worked on animations for Cartoon Network, Adult Swim, and Disney+. At the same time, the all-ages web series, &quot;Sherwood&quot;, also released all 12 episodes on YouTube Originals, made freely available in April 2020. 

Alternative comics artist turned animator Dash Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Cryptozoo&quot; enjoyed critical success at the Sundance Film Festival to the point of winning the NEXT Innovator Award while it was also nominated for the John Cassavetes Award at the Independent Spirit Awards a year afterwards.

Oscar-nominated animator Andrew Chesworth formerly worked at Disney (being animator on &quot;Wreck It Ralph&quot;, &quot;Frozen&quot;, &quot;Get a Horse!&quot;, &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, &quot;Feast&quot;, &quot;Zootopia&quot; and &quot;Moana&quot;) and Netflix (on the 2019 Annie Award for Best Animated Feature winner &quot;Klaus&quot;) while working independently on his passion projects including his 2023 Oscar-qualifying &quot;The Brave Locomotive&quot;, a love letter to the Andrews Sisters and 1940s animation. First conceived in 2008, he released online in 2015 the opening sequence that was in progress before shelving it after being hired by Disney in 2011. 

Other notable animated indie efforts of the 2020s include &quot;Marcel the Shell with Shoes On&quot;, &quot;Ninety-Five Senses&quot;, &quot;Mad God&quot;, &quot;War Is Over!&quot; and &quot;My Year of Dicks&quot;.

== Minority representation ==

LGBTQ+ representation in independent animation has increased over the years, as many series have featured LGBTQ+ characters. &quot;Lizzy the Lezzy&quot;, which premiered on Myspace in 2006, included LGBTQ+ characters like Lizzy, a lesbian. Plum, a bisexual character, first appeared in the animated series, &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;, a show which aired on Cartoon Hangover&#x27;s YouTube channel from 2012 to 2018, as confirmed by her crushes and by writer Kate Leth. The show was made by &quot;Adventure Time&quot; creator Pendleton Ward and featuring Ian Jones-Quartey, who voiced the character, Wallow, while he directed his own show, &quot;OK K.O.! Let&#x27;s Be Heroes&quot; which featured multiple LGBTQ+ characters. Although Plum had a crush on Chris, kissing him multiple times during the show, she is also madly in love with her doppelganger as shown in the comics.

The Rooster Teeth animated web series, &quot;RWBY&quot;, which began in 2013, features lesbian characters, and a trans woman named May Marigold, voiced by Kdin Jenzen. &quot;Nomad of Nowhere&quot;, another RoosterTeeth show, released in 2018, featured a lesbian protagonist named Skout, who had a crush on Captain Toth, her superior. In addition, SpindleHorse Toons&#x27;s &quot;Hazbin Hotel&quot;, by Vivienne Medrano, centers around a bisexual princess of Hell named Charlie, with a girlfriend named Vaggie, with the series also featuring an asexual character named Alastor, and a gay pornstar named Angel Dust. Medrano&#x27;s other series, &quot;Helluva Boss&quot;, featured various bisexual characters, such as a demon named Moxxie, and a pansexual demon named Blitzo. 

&quot;My Pride: The Series&quot;, which premiered in February 2020 on YouTube, follows a &quot;queer, disabled lioness&quot; named Nothing who is trying to heal the world. Yssa Badiola of &quot;Recorded by Arizal&quot; hosted a RTX panel, on September 21, 2020, and stated that there would be LGBTQ characters if a full season was ordered. Nico Colaleo&#x27;s animated web series, &quot;Too Loud&quot;, the first season which ran from July to August 2017, and the second season which aired from September to November 2019, includes an LGBTQ+ character. In the episode &quot;Slumber Party Sneak-In,&quot; Desiree plots with her sister, Sara, to dress up as a girl in order to go to a slumber party. The rest of the girls find this out, then console her, accepting, and deciding they like her no matter whether she is a trans girl named Desiree or as a closeted boy. In September 2019, Colaleo later described the episode as important, described it as his favorite episode of the show&#x27;s second season, and a &quot;pro-transgender episode.&quot;

The 2017 Student Academy Award-winning short film &quot;In a Heartbeat&quot; also features two gay characters as well.

&quot;&quot; (2020), featuring Canadian Inuit characters, won Best Independent Short Film at the Festival Stop Montreal.

African American animator/filmmaker Ayoka Chenzira is known for the 1984 satirical animated short &quot;Hair Piece: A Film for Nappyhead People&quot;, which was inducted into the National Film Registry in 2018. Another example of independent African-American animation is Bruce W. Smith&#x27;s 2019 Academy Award-winning short film &quot;Hair Love&quot;.

The 2016 autobiographical stop-motion short &quot;Deer Flower&quot;, made by Los Angeles-based filmmaker Kangmin Kim, mines his childhood in South Korea for themes.

<doc id="248786" wikidata="Q2990902" url="?curid=248786" title="Highland Football League">
<text>The Scottish Highland Football League (SHFL, commonly known as the Highland League) is a senior football league based in the north of Scotland. The league sits at level 5 on the Scottish football league system, acting as a feeder to the Scottish Professional Football League.

Founded in 1893, it is currently composed of 18 member clubs in a single division. Geographically, the league covers the Scottish Highlands as well as Moray, Aberdeenshire, the cities of Aberdeen and Dundee, Angus and parts of northern Perthshire.

Since 2014–15, it has featured in the senior pyramid system. The winners take part in an end-of-season promotion play-off with the Lowland Football League champions, with the winners then competing against the bottom club in Scottish League Two for a place in the SPFL. Promotion and relegation also exists between the three Highlands-based regional leagues at level 6 (Midlands League, North Caledonian League, and North Region Junior Football League).

The league&#x27;s current sponsorship deal is with the Breedon Group.

==Format==

Each team in the league plays each other twice during a season – once at home, once away, for a total of 34 matches. The standard league scoring system of 3 points for a win and 1 for a draw is applied, with ties in the league table broken by goal difference. The champions are presented with the League trophy and a flag, either immediately after the match which secures the victory, or at the next match at which it is practical to do so.

With the introduction of the new pyramid structure in Scottish football, a new schedule was introduced in the 2014–15 season, in order to ensure that all matches affecting the title are completed in time for the promotion playoffs beginning in April. As the region is prone to severe weather in winter, postponements have sometimes caused the conclusion of the season to be delayed (e.g. in 2013, a prolonged spell of bad weather meant the final matches were not played until 25 May). Various proposals which would have reduced the number of matches a team would play (either by instituting a two-phase season like that used in the Scottish Premiership, or by dividing the League into two smaller divisions), were considered but did not find favour with League members. Instead, clubs now play both a Saturday and a Wednesday fixture most weeks from August through October, taking advantage of milder weather at the start of the season. The new schedule builds in a four-week buffer near the end of the season during which no matches are initially scheduled, allowing any backlog of postponed matches to be cleared before the final fixtures.

=== Scottish Cup ===
All clubs are full members of the Scottish Football Association, so qualify automatically for the following season&#x27;s first round of the Scottish Cup. The league champions and the runner-up team receive a bye into the cup&#x27;s second round. Since 2014 the champions have taken part in the Scottish Challenge Cup; this was extended to the top four clubs from 2016. In 2016 the champions also gained a place in the Scottish League Cup.

== History ==

===Formation===
The Highland Football League was formed on 4 August 1893, at the Inverness Workman&#x27;s Club by employees of the Highland Railway Company who had their Company Headquarters, Locomotive and Carriage &amp; Wagon Workshops (Loch Gorm Works), based in the Highland capital and where they employed circa 700 staff. The original league consisted of seven teams: Inverness Thistle, Caledonian, Clachnacuddin, Forres Mechanics, Inverness Union, Inverness Citadel and Cameron Highlanders. Dingwall Victoria United (later renamed Ross County) were an eighth original member, but resigned membership in November 1893. The inaugural champions were Inverness Thistle. Of the original teams, two are still playing in the league today (Clachnacuddin and Forres Mechanics) while Caledonian and Thistle merged to become current Scottish League club Inverness Caledonian Thistle.

===Departures and expansions===

The league has been somewhat weakened by the departure of many former members who have subsequently joined the SFL. In 1994, Caledonian, Inverness Thistle and Ross County left. Until then the HFL had operated with 18 clubs; this was reduced by the departure of the three mentioned clubs, but Wick Academy from the North Caledonian Football League were elected, to create a league of 16 clubs. This was the state of affairs till 2000 when Elgin City and Peterhead were elected into the SFL. In 2002 Inverurie Loco Works were elected into the HFL to give it a membership of 15 clubs. Inverurie Locos are another Highland League football club with its origins in the Scottish railways, having been formed by employees of the Great North of Scotland Railway who had their Locomotive and Carriage and Wagon Workshops in Inverurie, hence the football club&#x27;s name.

In 2008, North Region Junior League sides Formartine United and Turriff United both submitted bids to join the Highland League, following in the footsteps of past Junior League side Inverurie Locos. Banks O&#x27; Dee and Strathspey Thistle also applied. On 25 February 2009, Formartine United, Strathspey Thistle and Turriff United were accepted into the league for the following season, with Banks O&#x27; Dee being the unsuccessful club.

===Pyramid===
Until the reorganisation of Scottish football during the 2012–13 season, the league was historically one of the senior leagues in Scottish football, along with the Scottish Premier League and Scottish Football League, as well as the East of Scotland and South of Scotland Leagues.

Since the 2014–15 season, the league champions have had the chance to qualify for promotion to the Scottish League Two via a play-off with the winners of the Lowland Football League, the winners then playing off against the bottom team in League Two. Although the introduction of a route into the Scottish Professional Football League was broadly welcomed, it also provoked some concern about the potential financial burden on smaller clubs who may need to significantly upgrade their grounds to meet the required standards. The logistics of travel to away games in a league dominated by central belt teams is also a concern, particularly for geographically remote clubs such as Wick Academy and Brora Rangers.

At the end of the 2018–19 season, Cove Rangers became the first Highland League club to gain promotion to the SPFL via the pyramid play-off, after beating Berwick Rangers 7–0 on aggregate in the League Two play-off final. Two years later, Brechin City became the first SPFL club to be relegated into the Highland League after losing 3–1 on aggregate to Kelty Hearts in the League Two play-off final.

At the end of the 2020–21 season the threat of relegation was introduced to the league, as the North Caledonian League, a newly formed Midlands League, and North Superleague were all brought into the pyramid as feeder leagues. At the end of the following season, Fort William became the first victim of the drop as they failed to play their games against North Superleague side Banks O&#x27; Dee in the playoff final, giving the Aberdeen side a bye into the Highland League as Fort William fell into the North Caledonian League.

<text>Feodosia (, &quot;Feodosiia, Teodosiia&quot;; , &quot;Feodosiya&quot;), also called in English Theodosia (from ), is a city on the Crimean coast of the Black Sea. Feodosia serves as the administrative center of Feodosia Municipality, one of the regions into which Crimea is divided. During much of its history, the city was a significant settlement known as Caffa () or Kaffa (Old Crimean Tatar/Ottoman Turkish: ; Crimean Tatar/). According to the 2014 census, its population was 69,145.

==History==

===Theodosia (Greek colony)===
The city was founded as &quot;Theodosia&quot; (Θεοδοσία) by Greek colonists from Miletos in the 6th century BC. Noted for its rich agricultural lands, on which its trade depended, the city was destroyed by the Huns in the 4th century AD.

Theodosia remained a minor village for much of the next nine hundred years. It was at times part of the sphere of influence of the Khazars (excavations have revealed Khazar artifacts dating back to the 9th century) and of the Byzantine Empire.

Like the rest of Crimea, this place (village) fell under the domination of the Kipchaks and was conquered by the Mongols in the 1230s.

A settlement named &quot;Kaphâs&quot; (alternate romanized spelling &quot;Cafâs&quot;, ) existed surrounding Theodosia prior to the penetration of Genoese into the Black Sea. The archaeological evidence indicates that during the Middle Ages the population about Theodosia never decreased to zero; several medieval churches are found in the area dating from the times of Late Antiquity/Early Middle Ages. However, the population had become completely agrarian. A small local Greek population must have existed &quot;in situ&quot; and in the neighboring settlements. Likely, from the 9th century there were Cumans and Goths living alongside the Greeks, and by 1270s, perhaps some Tatars and Armenians as well.

===Kaffa (Genoese colony)===

In the late 13th century, traders from the Republic of Genoa arrived and purchased the city from the ruling Golden Horde.

They established a flourishing trading settlement called &quot;Kaffa (&quot;also recorded as &quot;Caffa)&quot;, which virtually monopolized trade in the Black Sea region and served as a major port and administrative center for the Genoese settlements around the Sea. The city thrived despite the tenuous politics of the region and Genoa&#x27;s series of wars with the Mongol successor states. 

It came to house one of Europe&#x27;s biggest slave markets of the Black Sea slave trade, and served as a terminus for the Silk Road. The Great Soviet Encyclopedia also adds that the city of Caffa was established during the times when the area was ruled by the Khan of the Golden Horde Mengu-Timur.

Ibn Battuta visited the city, noting it was a &quot;great city along the sea coast inhabited by Christians, most of them Genoese.&quot; He further stated, &quot;We went down to its port, where we saw a wonderful harbor with about two hundred vessels in it, both ships of war and trading vessels, small and large, for it is one of the world&#x27;s celebrated ports.&quot;

In early 1318, Pope John XXII established a Latin Church diocese of Kaffa, as a suffragan of Genoa. The papal bull of appointment of the first bishop attributed to him a vast territory: &quot;a villa de Varna in Bulgaria usque Sarey inclusive in longitudinem et a mari Pontico usque ad terram Ruthenorum in latitudinem&quot; (&quot;from the city of Varna in Bulgaria to Sarey inclusive in longitude, and from the Black Sea to the land of the Ruthenians in latitude&quot;). The first bishop was Fra&#x27; Gerolamo, who had already been consecrated seven years before as a missionary bishop &quot;ad partes Tartarorum&quot;. The diocese ended as a residential bishopric with the capture of the city by the Ottomans in 1475. Accordingly, Kaffa is today listed by the Catholic Church as a titular see. The new diocese effectively broke up the diocese of Khanbaliq, which functioned as one diocese for all Mongol territory from the Balkans to China.

It is believed that the devastating pandemic of the Black Death entered Europe for the first time via Kaffa in 1347. After a protracted siege during which the Mongol army under Janibeg was reportedly withering from the disease, they catapulted the infected corpses over the city walls, infecting the inhabitants, in one of the first cases of biological warfare. Fleeing inhabitants may have carried the disease back to Italy, causing its spread across Europe. However, the plague appears to have spread in a stepwise fashion, taking over a year to reach Europe from Crimea. Also, there were a number of Crimean ports under Mongol control, so it is unlikely that Kaffa was the only source of plague-infested ships heading to Europe. Additionally, there were overland caravan routes from the East that would have been carrying the disease into Europe as well.

Kaffa eventually recovered. The thriving, culturally diverse city and its thronged slave market have been described by the Spanish traveler Pedro Tafur, who was there in the 1430s. The port was also visited by German traveler Johann Schiltberger in the 15th century. In 1462, Caffa placed itself under the protection of King Casimir IV of Poland. However, Poland did not offer significant help due to reinforcements sent being massacred in Bar fortress (modern day Ukraine) by Duke Czartoryski after a quarrel with locals.

===Kefe (Ottoman)===
Following the fall of Constantinople, Amasra, and lastly Trebizond, the position of Caffa had become untenable and attracted the attention of Ottoman Sultan Mehmed II. He was at no loss for a pretext to extinguish this last Genoese colony on the Black Sea. In 1473, the &quot;tudun&quot; (or governor) of the Crimean Khanate died and a fight developed over the appointment of his successor. The Genoese involved themselves in the dispute, and the Tatar notables who favored the losing candidate finally asked Mehmed to settle the dispute.

Mehmed dispatched a fleet under the Ottoman commander Gedik Ahmet Pasha, which left Constantinople 19 May 1475. It anchored before the walls of the city on 1 June, started the bombardment the next day, and on 6 June the inhabitants capitulated. Over the next few days the Ottomans proceeded to extract the wealth of the inhabitants, and abduct 1,500 youths for service in the Sultan&#x27;s palace. On 8 July, the final blow was struck when all inhabitants of Latin origin were ordered to relocate to Istanbul, where they founded a quarter (&quot;Kefeli Mahalle&quot;) which was named after the town they had been forced to leave.

Renamed &quot;Kefe&quot;, Caffa became one of the most important Turkish ports on the Black Sea. It was a major center of the Crimean slave trade until the late 18th-century, referred to by the Lithuanian Mikhalon Litvin as: &quot;not a town, but an abyss into which our blood is pouring&quot;. 
In 1616, Zaporozhian Cossacks under the leadership of Petro Konashevych-Sahaidachny destroyed the Turkish fleet and captured Caffa. Having conquered the city, the Cossacks released the men, women and children who were slaves.

===Feodosia (Russian Empire)===
Ottoman control ceased when the expanding Russian Empire took over Crimea between 1774 and 1783. It was renamed Feodosia (Russian Ѳеодосія; reformed spelling Феодосия), after the traditional Russian reading of its ancient Greek name. In 1900, Zibold constructed the first air well (dew condenser) on mount Tepe-Oba near Feodosia.

=== Soviet Union ===
==== WWII and Holocaust ====
The city was occupied by the forces of Nazi Germany during World War II, sustaining significant damage in the process. The Jewish population numbering 3,248 before the German occupation was murdered by SD-Einsatzgruppe D between November 16 and December 15, 1941. A witness interviewed by the Soviet Extraordinary Commission in 1944 and quoted on the website of the French organization Yahad-In Unum described how the Jews were rounded-up in the city: [A]ll the Jews were gathered. The Germans told them they would be displaced somewhere in Ukraine. On December 4, 1941, in the morning, all the Jews, including my father, my mother and my sister were taken to an anti-tank trench where they were executed by German shooters. 1,500-1,700 people were shot that day. A monument commemorating the Holocaust victims is situated at the crossroads of Kerchensky and Symferopolsky highways. On Passover eve, 7 April 2012, unknown persons desecrated the monument for the sixth time in what was allegedly an anti-Semitic act.

All native Tatar inhabitants were arrested by Soviet forces as several thousand Tatars had fought side-by-side with the Nazis against Soviet forces and had participated in the Jewish genocide. Following Stalin&#x27;s orders, all Tatars were sent to Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other Central Asian republics of the USSR.

=== Ukraine ===
==== Russian occupation ====
During the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the Russian warship Novocherkassk, a landing ship likely used to transport drones, was hit in the early morning hours of 26 December 2023 in the harbour of Feodosia. There was a large fire and explosion. Russia reported that two missiles that were fired from Sukhoi Su-24 jets were shot down.

==Geography==
===Climate===
Feodosia has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;), narrowly missing the boundary of a Mediterranean climate (Köppen &quot;Csa&quot;), with hot summer months drier than cool mild winter months but not enough to qualify as Mediterranean.

==Modern Feodosia==


Modern Feodosia is a resort city with a population of about 69,000 people. It has beaches, mineral springs, and mud baths, sanatoria, and rest homes. Apart from tourism, its economy rests on agriculture and fisheries. Local industries include fishing, brewing and canning. As with much of the Crimea, most of its population is ethnically Russian; the Ukrainian language is infrequently used. In June 2006, Feodosia made the news with the 2006 anti-NATO protests.

While most beaches in the Crimea are made of pebbles, in the Feodosia area there is a unique Golden Beach (&quot;Zolotoy Plyazh&quot;) made of small seashells which stretches for some 15 km.

The city is sparsely populated during the winter months and most cafes and restaurants are closed. Business and tourism increase in mid-June and peak during July and August. As in the other resort towns of the Crimea, the tourists come mostly from the Commonwealth of Independent States countries of the former Soviet Union.

Feodosia was the city where the seascape painter Ivan Aivazovsky lived and worked all his life, and where general Pyotr Kotlyarevsky and the writer Alexander Grin spent their declining years. Popular tourist locations include the Aivazovsky National Art Gallery and the Genoese fortress.

==In popular culture==
The late-medieval city of Caffa is the location of a section of the novel &quot;Caprice and Rondo&quot; by the Scottish novelist Dorothy Dunnett.

An early 14th-century bishop of Caffa appears in Umberto Eco&#x27;s novel &quot;The Name of the Rose&quot;, making several sharp replies in a long, tempestuous debate within a group of monks and clerics; he is portrayed as aggressive and somewhat narrow-minded.

<text>Fort Erie is a town in the Niagara Region of Ontario, Canada. The town is located at the south eastern corner of the region, on the Niagara River, directly across the Canada–United States border from Buffalo, New York, and is the site of Old Fort Erie which played a prominent role in the War of 1812.

Fort Erie is one of Niagara&#x27;s fastest growing communities, and has experienced a high level of residential and commercial development in the past few years. Garrison Road (Niagara Regional Road 3) is the town&#x27;s commercial corridor, stretching east to west through Fort Erie.

Fort Erie is also home to other commercial core areas (Bridgeburg, Ridgeway, Stevensville and Crystal Beach) as a result of the 1970 amalgamation of Bertie Township and the village of Crystal Beach with Fort Erie.

Crystal Beach Park occupied waterfront land at Crystal Beach, Ontario, from 1888 until the park&#x27;s closure in 1989. The beach is part of Fort Erie.

==History==
During the American Revolution Fort Erie was used as a supply depot for British troops. After the war the territory of what is now the Town of Fort Erie was settled by soldiers demobilised from Butler&#x27;s Rangers, and the area was named Bertie Township in 1784.

The original fort, built in 1764, was located on the Niagara River&#x27;s edge below the present fort. It served as a supply depot and a port for ships transporting merchandise, troops and passengers via Lake Erie to the Upper Great Lakes. The fort was damaged by winter storms and in 1803, plans were made for a new fort on the higher ground behind the original. It was larger and made of flintstone but was not quite finished at the start of the War of 1812.

During the war, the Americans attacked Fort Erie twice in 1812, captured and abandoned it in 1813, and then recaptured it in 1814. The Americans held it for a time, breaking a prolonged British siege. Later they destroyed Fort Erie and returned to Buffalo in the winter of 1814.
The Fort Erie area became a major terminus for slaves using the Underground Railroad (between 1840 and 1860); many had crossed into Canada from Buffalo, New York. Bertie Hall (which was used for a time in the 20th century as a Doll House Museum) may have been a stopping point on the Underground Railroad. The area of Ridgemount was one of the three main areas in Fort Erie settled by African-Americans, earning it the name &quot;Little Africa&quot;. Along with Little Africa, the other two areas of settlement were Bertie Hill and Snake Hill (Erie Beach).

In 1866, during the Fenian raids, between 1,000 and 1,500 Fenians crossed the Niagara River, occupied the town and demanded food and horses. The only payment they were able to offer was Fenian bonds; these were not acceptable to the citizens. The Fenians then cut the telegraph wires and tore up some railway tracks. Afterwards, they marched to Chippewa and the next day to Ridgeway where they fought the Battle of Ridgeway, a series of skirmishes with the Canadian militia. The Fenians then returned to Fort Erie and fought the Battle of Fort Erie, defeating the Canadian militia. Fearing British reinforcements, they then decided to retreat to the U.S.

In 1869 the population was 1,000 and Fort Erie was served by the Grand Trunk and the Erie &amp; Niagara railways. The Grand Trunk Railway built the International Railway Bridge in 1873, bringing about a new town, originally named Victoria and subsequently renamed to Bridgeburg, north of the original settlement of Fort Erie. By 1876, Ridgeway had an estimated population of 800, the village of Fort Erie has an estimated population of 1,200, and Victoria boasted three railway stations. By 1887, Stevensville had an estimated population of &quot;nearly 600&quot;, Victoria of &quot;nearly 700&quot;, Ridgeway of &quot;about 600&quot;, and Fort Erie of &quot;about 4,000&quot;.

In 1888, the amusement park at Crystal Beach opened. From 1910, the steamship (and until 1929, the steamship SS &quot;Americana&quot;) brought patrons from Buffalo until 1956. The park continued to operate until it closed in 1989. A gated community was built in this area.

In 1904, a group of speculators bought land at Erie Beach, planning to build an amusement park and other amenities, and sell lots around the park to vacationers from Buffalo. Erie Beach featured a hotel, a casino, a race track, regular ferry service from Buffalo and train service from the ferry dock in Fort Erie, and what was billed as the world&#x27;s largest outdoor swimming pool. Erie Beach and Crystal Beach were in competition to provide bigger thrills to patrons, until Erie Beach went bankrupt during the Depression and closed down on Labour Day weekend, 1930.

The Niagara Movement meeting was held at the Erie Beach Hotel in 1905. The movement later led to the founding of the NAACP.

The Point Abino Light Tower was built by the Canadian government in 1918. The lighthouse has been automated in 1989. Since its decommissioning in 1995, the Point Abino Lighthouse was designated as a National Historic Site. The lighthouse is now owned by the Town of Fort Erie and is available for weekend tours in the summer.

On August 7, 1927, the Peace Bridge was opened between Fort Erie and Buffalo.

On January 1, 1932, Bridgeburg and Fort Erie amalgamated into a single town.

The ruins of Fort Erie remained until they were rebuilt through a depression era &quot;work program&quot; project, as a tourist attraction. Work started in 1937, and the fort was opened to the public in 1939.

In 1970, the provincial government consolidated the various villages in what had been Bertie Township, including the then town of Fort Erie, into the present Town of Fort Erie.

==Geography==
Fort Erie is optimally flat, but there are low sand hills, varying in height from , along the shore of Lake Erie, and a limestone ridge extends from Point Abino to near Miller&#x27;s Creek, giving Ridgeway its name. The soil is shallow, with a clay subsoil.

The town&#x27;s beaches on Lake Erie, most notably Erie Beach, Crystal Beach and Bay Beach are considered the best in the area and draw many weekend visitors from the Toronto and Buffalo, New York areas. While summers are enjoyable, winters can occasionally be fierce, with many snowstorms, whiteouts and winds coming off Lake Erie.

===Communities===
In addition to the primary urban core of Fort Erie, the town also contains the neighbourhoods of Black Creek, Bridgeburg/NorthEnd/Victoria, Crescent Park, Crystal Beach, Kraft, Point Abino, Ridgeway, Snyder, and Stevensville. Smaller and historical neighbourhoods include Amigari Downs, Bay Beach, Buffalo Heights, Douglastown, Edgewood Park, Erie Beach, Garrison Village, Mulgrave, Oakhill Forest, Ridgemount, Ridgewood, Rose Hill Estates, Thunder Bay, Walden, Wavecrest and Waverly Beach.

Fort Erie Secondary School and Ridgeway-Crystal Beach High School were two public high schools serving Fort Erie and area communities until September 2017. The two former schools were closed and merged into Greater Fort Erie Secondary School, located on Garrison Road.

==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Fort Erie had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

The median household income in 2015 for Fort Erie was $60,800, which was below the Ontario provincial average of $74,287.

==Government==

The Town Council consists of the Mayor and 6 ward councillors.

Town Council and municipal services are based at Town Hall at 1 Municipal Drive since 1996. The previous location at 200 Jarvis Street was used after the first town hall was vacated in 1985 and was home to Bridgeburg Town Hall. The first town hall is now a parking lot, with the World War 1 memorial moved to Mathers Park, and the second town hall is replaced by the Fort Erie Courthouse.

Fort Erie has a single member on Niagara Regional Council.

* Old Fort Erie
* Point Abino Lighthouse
* Safari Niagara

===Hiking===
Fort Erie is the eastern terminus of the Friendship Trail, and the southern terminus of the Niagara River Recreation Pathway. Both trails are part of the Trans-Canada Trail system.

===Parks===
Mather Arch Park, located just to the south of the Peace Bridge, is on land donated by American citizen Alonzo C. Mather in tribute to the peace and friendship between Canada and the United States. The park contains Mather Arch, which was built largely due to donations by Mather, originally dedicated by the Niagara Parks Commission in 1939, and restored in 2000 as a millennium project. There is also a memorial statue to those from Fort Erie who died in World War I, World War II, and the Korean War.

===Transportation===
====Highways====
Fort Erie has been the Niagara terminus of the Queen Elizabeth Way since 1937. Road traffic continues to Buffalo, New York across the Peace Bridge, which was built in 1927.

Fort Erie was the eastern terminus of King&#x27;s Highway 3A from 1927 to 1929, and Ontario Highway 3 from 1929 until 1998, when the portion of Highway 3 within Fort Erie was downloaded to the Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Niagara Regional Road 3. Within Fort Erie, Highway 3 is named Garrison Road, and is the major east–west connection through the town. Dominion Road was designated as King&#x27;s Highway 3C from 1934 until 1970, when it was downloaded to the newly formed Regional Municipality of Niagara and redesignated as Niagara Regional Road 1.

Fort Erie is the southern terminus of the Niagara Parkway, which extends from Fort Erie to Fort George.

====Public transit====
Public transit was provided by Fort Erie Transit, which operated buses in town and connected to other Niagara municipalities.

Niagara Region Transit operates a service from Niagara Falls into Fort Erie, connecting with the Fort Erie Leisureplex on Garrison Road.

====Intercity transit====
Private intercity coach services are primarily operated by Coach Canada/Megabus, with service to St. Catharines and Toronto. The terminus is located at Robo Mart, 21 Princess Street at Waterloo Street.

The International Railway Bridge was built in 1873, and connects Fort Erie to Buffalo, New York across the Niagara River. 

There is currently no passenger rail service to Fort Erie. The nearest passenger rail stations are in Buffalo, New York and Niagara Falls, Ontario.

====Waterways====
Fort Erie is at the outlet of Lake Erie into the Niagara River. The lake and river serve as a playground for numerous personal yachts, sailboats, power boats and watercraft. There is a marina at the site of a former shipyard at Miller&#x27;s Creek on the Niagara River, and a boat launch ramp in Crystal Beach.

Prior to the completion of the two bridges, passengers and freight were carried across the river by ferry.

From 1829, when the Welland Canal first opened, to 1833, when the cut was completed to Port Colborne, ship traffic between Lake Erie and Lake Ontario would transit the upper Niagara River.

===Utilities===
In order to reduce large-scale ice blockage in the Niagara River, with resultant flooding, ice damage to docks and other waterfront structures, and blockage of the water intakes for the hydro-electric power plants at Niagara Falls, the New York Power Authority and Ontario Power Generation have jointly operated the Lake Erie-Niagara River Ice Boom since 1964. The boom is installed on December 16, or when the water temperature reaches , whichever happens first. The boom is opened on April 1 unless there is more than of ice remaining in Eastern Lake Erie. When in place, the boom stretches from the outer breakwall at Buffalo Harbor almost to the Canadian shore near the ruins of the pier at Erie Beach in Fort Erie. Originally, the boom was made of wooden timbers, but these have been replaced by steel pontoons.

<text>Fraxinus excelsior, known as the ash, or European ash or common ash to distinguish it from other types of ash, is a flowering plant species in the olive family Oleaceae. It is native throughout mainland Europe east to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains, and west to Great Britain and Ireland, the latter determining its western boundary. The northernmost location is in the Trondheimsfjord region of Norway. The species is widely cultivated and reportedly naturalised in New Zealand and in scattered locales in the United States and Canada.

==Description==
It is a large deciduous tree growing to (exceptionally to ) tall with a trunk up to (exceptionally to ) diameter, with a tall, narrow crown. The bark is smooth and pale grey on young trees, becoming thick and vertically fissured on old trees. The shoots are stout, greenish-grey, with jet-black buds (which distinguish it from most other ash species, which have grey or brown buds). The leaves are opposite, long, pinnately compound, with 7–13 leaflets with coarsely serrated margins, elliptic to narrowly elliptic, long and broad and sessile on the leaf rachis. There are no stipules. These features distinguish ash from mountain ash (&quot;Sorbus aucuparia&quot;) in which the leaves are alternate with paired stipules. The leaves are often among the last to open in spring, and the first to fall in autumn if an early frost strikes; they often fall dull green or develop a bright yellow autumn colour. The flowers are borne in short panicles, open before the leaves, and have no perianth. The female flowers are somewhat longer than the male flowers, dark purple, without petals, and are wind-pollinated. Both male and female flowers can occur on the same tree, but it is more common to find all male and all female trees. A tree that is all male one year can produce female flowers the next, and similarly a female tree can become male. The fruit is a samara long and broad, often hanging in bunches through the winter; they are often called &#x27;ash keys&#x27;. If the fruit is gathered and planted when it is still green and not fully ripe, it will germinate straight away, however once the fruit is brown and fully ripe, it will not germinate until 18 months after sowing (i.e. not until two winters have passed).

European ash rarely exceeds 250 years of age. However, there are numerous specimens estimated between 200 and 250 years old and there are a few over 250. The largest is in Clapton Court, England and is in girth. There are several examples over in Derbyshire alone.

==Distribution==
&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot; is native to Europe from northern Spain to Russia, and from southern Fennoscandia to northern Greece. It is also considered native in southwestern Asia from northern Turkey east to the Caucasus and Alborz mountains. The northernmost location is in the Trondheimsfjord region of Norway. The species is widely cultivated and reportedly naturalized in New Zealand and in scattered locales in the United States and Canada including Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Quebec, Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York, New Jersey, Maryland, Ontario, Ohio, Kentucky and British Columbia.

It is native throughout Britain and Ireland, particularly on limestone, as in northern Scotland, where the most northerly native ashwood in Britain occurs on limestone at Rassal Ashwood. It is widely planted elsewhere.

==Ecology==

Ash occurs on a wide range of soil types, but is particularly associated with basic soils on calcareous substrates. The most northerly ashwood in Britain is on limestone at Rassal, Wester Ross, latitude 57.4278 N. Ash prefers moister soil types and is commonly limited by temperature and so not found at the higher colder altitudes in much of Europe, though in Iran, it may reach 2000 m asl. As a young seedling, it is shade tolerant, but older trees are light-demanding. It is an early-succession species and may well outcompete beech and oak, which are later-succession species.

&quot;F. excelsior&quot; mycorrhizae are of the internal arbuscular mycorrhizal type, in which the fungus grows within the tissues of the root and forms branched, tree-like structures within the cells of the root cortex. Unlike other &quot;Fraxinus&quot; species, &quot;F. excelsior&quot; does not form ectomycorrhizae.

The Biological Records Centre of the UK records 111 species of insects and mites using ash as a food plant, of which 29 are specific to ash. A further six are specific to ash and its Oleaceae relative wild privet (&quot;Ligustrum vulgare&quot;). A number of Lepidoptera species use the species as a food source. One example of an ash-specific feeding moth is the centre-barred sallow (&quot;Atethmia centrago&quot;). The larvae burrow into the buds when newly hatched and later feed on the flowers and leaves. A common moth which causes the browning of ash leaves, as well as garden privet and lilac, is &quot;Gracillaria syringella&quot;. The usually gregarious larvae form an epidermal gallery (i.e. feed within the leaf) which leads to a brown blotch with black frass. Later, two successive cones are formed by folding the tip of a leaf downwards.

In Britain, 14 galls have been recorded on ash. The British Plant Gall Society defines a gall as &quot;... an abnormal growth produced by a plant under the influence of another organism&quot;.
===Ash dieback===
Ash dieback is caused by the fungus &quot;Hymenoscyphus fraxineus&quot; which was previously known as &quot;Chalara fraxinea.&quot;
Research into the genetics of the resistance of ash (&quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot;) has shown that resistance does occur in European populations, but at least for the samples tested, it is neither common nor strong. Due to the importance of &quot;F. excelsior&quot; as a host, Jönsson and Thor 2012 find that rare/threatened lichens face an unusually high (0.38) coextinction risk probability &quot;vis-a-vis&quot; the host tree in the wooded meadows of Gotland, Sweden.

==Genome==
The genome of &quot;Fraxinus excelsior&quot; is being sequenced by two groups of scientists in the United Kingdom. A group at Queen Mary University of London led by Richard Buggs are sequencing the self-pollinated offspring of a tree from Worcestershire, held by the Earth Trust. A group at the John Innes Centre and The Genome Analysis Centre led by Allan Downie are sequencing &quot;Tree 35&quot; from Denmark, discovered by Erik Kjær, which has survived 8 years of ash dieback.

==Uses==

The resilience and rapid growth made it an important resource for smallholders and farmers. It was probably the most versatile wood in the countryside with wide-ranging uses. Until World War II, the trees were often coppiced on a 10-year cycle to provide a sustainable source of timber for fuel and poles for building and woodworking. The colour of the wood ranges from creamy white to light brown, and the heart wood may be a darker olive-brown. Ash timber is hard, tough and very hard-wearing, with a coarse, open grain and a density of 710 kg/m3. It lacks oak&#x27;s natural resistance to decay, and is not as suitable for posts buried in the ground. Because of its high flexibility, shock resistance, and resistance to splitting, ash wood is the traditional material for bows, tool handles, especially for hammers and axes, tennis rackets, and snooker cue sticks, and it was extensively used in the construction of early aircraft. Ash was commonly used green for making chair frames which would be seated with another timber or with woven rush (e.g. those made by Philip Clissett, see also &quot;The English Regional Chair&quot;). The parts were turned on a pole lathe or shaped with a drawknife. The practice essentially died out in the early 20th century, but has seen a revival in recent years.

Ash is an important constituent of wood pasture, a European management system in which open woodland provided shelter and forage for grazing animals. Ash was coppiced and pollarded, often in hedgerows, and evidence in the form of some huge boles with multiple trunks emerging at head height can still be seen in parts of Britain. The Glen Lyon ash is a notable example of a pollarded ash which at about 400–500 years of age achieved a girth of 6 m. In Northumberland, crab and lobster pots (traps) sometimes known as &#x27;creeves&#x27; by local people are still made from ash sticks. Because of its elasticity European ash wood was commonly used for walking sticks. Poles were cut from a coppice and the ends heated in steam. The wood could then be bent in a curved vise to form the handle of the walking stick. The light colour and attractive grain of ash wood make it popular in modern furniture such as chairs, dining tables, doors, and other architectural features and wood flooring.

Ash is the only wood used for the manufacture of hurleys, referred to as hurls in parts of Leinster and known as a&quot; camán&quot; in Irish, the timber sticks used in the game of hurling in Ireland. Hurleys are manufactured from the butt log (bottom 1.5-m of the stem) and from trees ideally of a diameter at breast height around 25–30 cm. Only fast-grown, straight, and knot-free ash can be used for this purpose. Due to the lack of available ash in Ireland, over 75% of the timber needed to produce the 350,000 hurleys required for the game annually must be imported, mostly from Eastern European countries. The importance of ash timber to the game of hurling is reflected in the fact that the game is referred to all over Ireland as &quot;The Clash of the Ash&quot;.

Ash is valuable as firewood because it burns well even when &#x27;green&#x27; (freshly cut). Ash bark and leaves are used in modern herbal medicine for its astringent and laxative properties.

==Mythology==

In the 13th-century Edda and other writing relating to Norse mythology, the vast ash tree Yggdrasil (&quot;the steed (gallows) of Odin&quot;), watered by three magical springs, serves as axis mundi, sustaining the nine worlds of the cosmos in its roots and branches.

==Folklore==
On the Isle of Bute in Scotland, lovers reportedly used to eat leaves of an ash tree known as the &quot;Dreamin&#x27; Tree&quot; that grew near the church of St Blane, and the pleasant dreams they then experienced revealed their actual spouses and intended fates.

<text>Grimsby is a town on Lake Ontario in the Niagara Region, Ontario, Canada. Grimsby is at the eastern end of the Hamilton Census Metropolitan Area. It is named after the English fishing town of Grimsby in north-east Lincolnshire. The majority of residents reside in the area bounded by Lake Ontario and the Niagara Escarpment, home to a section of the Bruce Trail.

Grimsby has experienced significant growth over the past two decades due to its position between Hamilton and St. Catharines. Growth is limited by the natural boundaries of Lake Ontario and the Niagara Escarpment. Some residents feel development is detrimental to the town as orchards close to the town centre are used for residential development; however, most of the orchards in Grimsby were replaced by houses between the 1950s and 1980s, and very few orchards remain.

According to a late 2019 report, the town has 33 small parks, 17 larger and &quot;many more green spaces, sport fields, parkettes, trails, and facilities&quot;. Some notable attractions in Grimsby are the Grimsby Museum, the Grimsby Public Library, the Grimsby Public Art Gallery, the West Niagara YMCA, the Danish Church, and the hockey arena (Peach King Centre), home of the Grimsby Peach Kings.

==History==
A group of United Empire Loyalists from Great Britain settled on the land (originally named Township Number 6 and then &#x27;The Forty&#x27;), and founded Grimsby in 1790. Robert Nelles, a politician and later lieutenant-colonel in the War of 1812, was one of the town&#x27;s founders. His home on Main Street West was used for many planning sessions during the war. In 1816, the settlement became known as Grimsby, the name of the surrounding township, in memory of the seaport town of Grimsby in North East Lincolnshire, England. Historic St. Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church was founded in 1794 and the current building was completed in 1825.

The Village of Grimsby was officially incorporated in 1876 and became a town in 1922. The community has gone through many changes, from being a small rural village to a centre for the manufacture of farm machinery, hospital furniture, furnaces and other metal products; and later the hub of the Niagara Peninsula&#x27;s fruit-growing industry. Grimsby also had a successful fishing industry which lasted until the 1960s. The Town of Grimsby and the Township of North Grimsby were amalgamated in 1970 with the formation of the Regional Municipality of Niagara. With a number of wineries and distilleries, Grimsby now serves as the starting point for touring the Niagara wine region.

Canada&#x27;s first Chautauqua-like organization (a Methodist camp) was established in 1859 in Grimsby Park on land donated by J.B. Bowslaugh; colourful cottages were later built, and some visitors spent entire summers in the area. Two hotels and a temple were also built. Over 50,000 visited in 1884, but by 1900, interest had declined. By 1909, the Grimsby Park Company was bankrupt, and the property was sold for use as an amusement park. The temple and hotels were destroyed in the 1920s. In 1910, the amusement park&#x27;s first owner, Harry Wylie, added carousels, a motion picture theatre, and a roller coaster. Canada Steamship Lines bought out the business in 1916, but the park declined through the 1920s, mainly due to multiple fires that consumed many of the wooden buildings. The operation had ceased by 1950, and the land was sold to developers who built cottages. Many of the colourful cottages were destroyed by fire or demolished over the years. As of 2019, Grimsby Pier, where ferries and steamships had once docked, was in a state of disrepair; the mayor said he hoped that it could be restored.

In 2011, Grimsby was struck by an F0 Tornado.

Grimsby is also the birthplace of a Hollywood director, Del Lord. He rose to acclaim as the director of most of the Three Stooges short vaudeville comedies. Later, under Columbia Pictures, he also directed nearly 200 feature films.

==Local government==


Grimsby Town Council is composed of a mayor and eight councillors who serve for a term of four years. The mayor is elected at large, and the councillors are elected by ward. The town is divided into four wards, with two councillors elected in each ward. It is the role of the council to represent the public and to consider the well-being and interests of the municipality; to develop and evaluate policies and programs; to determine which services the municipality provides; to ensure administrative practices and procedures are in place to implement the decisions of council; and to maintain the financial integrity of the municipality. The council generally meets on the first and third Mondays of each month. All meetings are open to the public and are also televised live on the local Government-access television (GATV) cable TV channel.

The current council (2018-2022 term) was sworn in on December 3, 2018, with the following members:

;Mayor
*Jeff A. Jordan

;Town council members Ward 1
*Councillor Reg Freake
*Councillor Delight Davoli

The Regional Municipality of Niagara is an upper-tier municipality that encompasses all municipalities in Niagara Region. On Niagara Regional Council, Grimsby is represented by the mayor and by an elected regional councillor, currently Michelle Seaborn.

==Transportation==
Bisecting the town is the Queen Elizabeth Way, one of the 400-series highways. It has three interchanges in the town, with Casablanca Boulevard in the west, a central interchange for three roads (Christie Street, Ontario Street, and Maple Avenue), and Bartlett Avenue in the east.

The Grimsby station, on the south side of the railway tracks west of Ontario Street and south of Queen Elizabeth Way, is served by the &quot;Maple Leaf&quot; train jointly operated by Via Rail and Amtrak. A GO Transit train station is planned for operation on the Lakeshore West line, was expected to open in 2021 as part of the Lakeshore West Line, and was halted as of late 2018. Of three sites for the Grimsby GO Station evaluated by Metrolinx, the Crown agency that operates GO Transit, the preferred site for the proposed station is west of and adjacent to Casablanca Boulevard.

In August 2020, Niagara Region Transit launched a two-year pilot to provide on-demand local and regional transit service for Grimsby and other nearby communities.

Grimsby Regional Airport, a private aerodrome for small aircraft, is located about 6 kms south-west of the town centre.

==Grimsby Public Library==

The first library in Grimsby was opened in 1871 in the home of Grimsby councillor Sam Mabey, housing a collection of 1,000 books. Following a recommendation of the town council, the village struck a committee to approach the Andrew Carnegie Foundation to request new funds to build a new library. The foundation allocated $8,000 to build the new library building.
In 1975, the library was expanded to include a new building, which inaugurated a Grimsby Public Art Gallery in the basement of the library. A few years later, the Klosso Eloul sculpture &#x27;Double is One&#x27; was installed on the grounds.
In 2004, a new building was constructed adjacent to the original structure to house both the library and art gallery. The original structure itself contains the Grimsby Archives.

==Grimsby Beach==
Grimsby beach is home to &quot;Gingerbread Houses&quot; that are painted by owners in bright colours and flourishes for an eye-catching addition to the area.

<doc id="248799" wikidata="Q1275120" url="?curid=248799" title="Philosophy of psychology">
<text>Philosophy of psychology is concerned with the history and foundations of psychology. It deals with both epistemological and ontological issues and shares interests with other fields, including philosophy of mind and theoretical psychology. Philosophical and theoretical psychology are intimately tied and are therefore sometimes used interchangeably or used together. However, philosophy of psychology relies more on debates general to philosophy and on philosophical methods, whereas theoretical psychology draws on multiple areas. 

==Epistemology==
Some of the issues studied by the philosophy of psychology are epistemological concerns about the methodology of psychological investigation. For example:
* What constitutes a psychological explanation?
* What is the most appropriate methodology for psychology: mentalism, behaviorism, or a compromise?
* Are self-reports a reliable data-gathering method?
* What conclusions can be drawn from null hypothesis tests?
* Can first-person experiences (emotions, desires, beliefs, etc.) be measured objectively?

== Ontology ==
Philosophers of psychology also concern themselves with ontological issues, like:

* Can psychology be theoretically reduced to neuroscience?
* What are psychological phenomena?
* What is the relationship between subjectivity and objectivity in psychology?

== Relations to other fields ==
Philosophy of psychology also closely monitors contemporary work conducted in cognitive neuroscience, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence, for example questioning whether psychological phenomena can be explained using the methods of neuroscience, evolutionary theory, and computational modeling, respectively. Although these are all closely related fields, some concerns still arise about the appropriateness of importing their methods into psychology. Some such concerns are whether psychology, as the study of individuals as information processing systems (see Donald Broadbent), is autonomous from what happens in the brain (even if psychologists largely agree that the brain in some sense causes behavior (see supervenience)); whether the mind is &quot;hard-wired&quot; enough for evolutionary investigations to be fruitful; and whether computational models can do anything more than offer possible implementations of cognitive theories that tell us nothing about the mind (Fodor &amp; Pylyshyn 1988).

Related to the philosophy of psychology are philosophical and epistemological inquiries about clinical psychiatry and psychopathology. Philosophy of psychiatry is mainly concerned with the role of values in psychiatry: derived from philosophical value theory and phenomenology, values-based practice is aimed at improving and humanizing clinical decision-making in the highly complex environment of mental health care. Philosophy of psychopathology is mainly involved in the epistemological reflection about the implicit philosophical foundations of psychiatric classification and evidence-based psychiatry. Its aims is to unveil the constructive activity underlying the description of mental phenomena.

== Main areas ==
Different schools and systems of psychology represent approaches to psychological problems, which are often based on different philosophies of consciousness.

Functional psychology
Functionalism treats the psyche as derived from the activity of external stimuli, deprived of its essential autonomy, denying free will, which influenced behaviourism later on; one of the founders of functionalism was James, also close to pragmatism, where human action is put before questions and doubts about the nature of the world and man himself.
Psychoanalysis
Freud`s doctrine, called Metapsychology, was to give the human self greater freedom from instinctive and irrational desires in a dialogue with a psychologist through analysis of the unconscious. Later the psychoanalytic movement split, part of it treating psychoanalysis as a practice of working with archetypes (analytical psychology), part criticising the social limitations of the unconscious (Freudo-Marxism), and later Lacan`s structural psychoanalysis, which interpreted the unconscious as a language.
Phenomenological psychology
Edmund Husserl rejected the physicalism of most of the psychological teachings of his time and began to understand consciousness as the only reality accessible to reliable cognition. His disciple Heidegger added to this the assertion of the fundamental finitude of man and the threat of a loss of authenticity in the technical world, and thus laid the foundation for existential psychology.
Structuralism
The recognised creator of psychology as a science, W. Wundt described the primordial structures of the psyche that determine perception and behaviour, but faced the problem of the impossibility of direct access to these structures and the vagueness of their description. Half a century later his ideas, combined with Saussure&#x27;s semiotics, strongly influenced the general humanities of structuralism and the post-structuralism and post-modernism that emerged from it, where structures were treated as linguistic invariants.

<doc id="248802" wikidata="Q620585" url="?curid=248802" title="Battle of Mortimer's Cross">
<text>The Battle of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross was fought on 2 February 1461 near Kingsland, Herefordshire (between Leominster and Leintwardine, by the River Lugg), not far from the Welsh border. It was a major battle of the Wars of the Roses. The opposing forces were an army led by Jasper Tudor and his father, Owen Tudor, and other nobles loyal to King Henry VI of the House of Lancaster, his wife, Margaret of Anjou, and their seven-year-old son, Edward, Prince of Wales, on one side, and the army of Edward, Earl of March. Some sources say it was fought on 3 February, and the exact location has been the subject of some speculation.

==Background==
In 1460, with King Henry VI a prisoner, Richard, Duke of York (father of Edward, Earl of March) attempted to depose Henry and become king himself. His closest supporters dissuaded him from this step, but he secured an Act of Accord by which he and his descendants would inherit the throne on Henry&#x27;s death, thus disinheriting Henry&#x27;s young son Edward, Prince of Wales. Inspired by Henry&#x27;s queen, Margaret of Anjou, York&#x27;s enemies and rivals began gathering armies in Wales and Northern England. York sent Edward of March, his 18-year-old eldest son, to gather support in the Welsh Marches while he himself led an army to the north. On 30 December, York led his men into a trap at the Battle of Wakefield where he was killed.

With York&#x27;s death, his titles and claim to the throne descended to Edward of March, now 4th duke of York. He sought to prevent Lancastrian forces from Wales, led by Owen Tudor and his son Jasper, Earl of Pembroke, from joining the main body of the Lancastrian army. The elder Tudor had been second husband to Catherine of Valois, widow of Henry V; their sons (Jasper and Edmund Tudor), as Henry VI&#x27;s half-brothers, had been made earls, and the family was a major power in South Wales. His army included Welshmen, drawn especially from the Tudor lands in Carmarthenshire and Pembrokeshire, along with French and Breton mercenaries and Irish troops led by James Butler, Earl of Wiltshire and Ormond. Edward, based at Wigmore Castle had gathered his army from the English border counties and from Wales. Among his leading supporters present were Lord Audley, Lord Grey of Wilton, Sir William Herbert of Raglan, Sir Walter Devereux and Humphrey Stafford. After spending Christmas in Gloucester, he began to prepare to return to London. However, Jasper Tudor&#x27;s army was approaching and he changed his plan; to block Tudor from joining the main Lancastrian force which was approaching London, Edward moved north with an army of approximately five thousand men to Mortimer&#x27;s Cross.

==Parhelion==
As dawn broke, the meteorological phenomenon known as &quot;parhelion&quot; occurred: three suns were seen to be rising. The appearance of this sun dog so soon before the battle seems to have frightened his troops, but Edward of York appears to have convinced them that it represented the Holy Trinity and that therefore God was on their side. He later took it as his emblem, the &quot;Sun in splendour&quot;. The event was dramatised by William Shakespeare in &quot;King Henry VI, Part 3&quot; (see below) and in Sharon Kay Penman&#x27;s &quot;The Sunne in Splendour&quot;.

==Battle==
One of York&#x27;s advisers, Sir Richard Croft, a local lord from Croft Castle, recommended positioning archers at the crossroads (Roman Road and Ogilby Road) in order to halt the Lancastrian advance. Pembroke&#x27;s army was about a thousand men smaller than York&#x27;s and, being untried in battle at that point, may not have originally planned to fight but by midday it was clear that they would have to in order to cross the Lugg. The Lancastrians commenced the attack—Butler&#x27;s &#x27;battle&#x27; (division) led the first assault forcing Edward&#x27;s right wing to retreat across the road, where this flank dissolved. Pembroke faced Edward&#x27;s centre division and was held off but, most decisively, Owen Tudor attempted an encirclement of the Yorkist left wing; his ‘battle’ was defeated and a rout commenced. Pembroke&#x27;s centre then also broke and the battle was won. Owen Tudor&#x27;s men were now in full flight: some of them were followed as far as Hereford, approximately , and where Owen was himself captured and beheaded.

==Aftermath==

The battle having intruded on York&#x27;s plans to march to the midlands, Richard Neville, Earl of Warwick, with the captive King Henry in his train, was meanwhile forced to move to block Margaret&#x27;s army&#x27;s route to London on his own. He took up position north of St Albans astride the main road from the north (the ancient Roman road known as Watling Street). Although he lost the battle that followed, and Margaret of Anjou and her army could now march unopposed on to London, they did not do so. The Lancastrian army&#x27;s reputation for pillage caused the Londoners to bar the gates. This in turn caused Margaret to hesitate, as did the news of the Yorkist victory at Mortimer&#x27;s Cross. The Lancastrians fell back through Dunstable, losing many Scots and Borderers who deserted and returned home with the plunder they had already gathered. Edward of March and Warwick entered London on 2 March, and Edward was quickly proclaimed King Edward IV of England. Within a few weeks he had confirmed his hold on the throne with a decisive victory at the Battle of Towton.

==Alignment controversy==

Conventional sketch maps of Mortimer&#x27;s Cross show the armies facing each other across the valley with the River Lugg at the rear of Edward&#x27;s Yorkist army. This almost east/west alignment is partly based on the supposed approach routes of both armies. It has been pointed out that this would mean that Yorkist Edward had the river at his back, an obstacle which would invite disaster if the Yorkists were either pushed back or routed. His fleeing men would be cut down from behind while trying to wade the shallows. Edward was known to be militarily astute (or at least well advised) and he is likely to have been well aware of this risk. Writing for &quot;Hobilar, the Journal of the Lance and Longbow Society&quot; Andy Lamkowski suggests that a second battlefield alignment is quite plausible; that Edward drew up across the valley with the River Lugg on his left (with the Yorkists facing almost south) and the Lancastrians drew up facing almost north with the river on their right. The narrowness of the valley close to the bridge would probably mean that the two armies each drew up in a column of three divisions—if they fought close to the river crossing—but the ground widens significantly towards the present Battle Acre Cottage and Drybridge House. At that point a traditional &#x27;three units&#x27; battle line is possible. Author Andrew Boardman also suggests that an alternative interpretation is possible saying: &quot;It may be safe to assume that the battle was fought somewhere in the vicinity, possibly with the river securing the flanks of both armies and the hills the other&quot;.
Andrew Boardman also quotes William Gregory (Gregory&#x27;s Chronicle) saying that Edward: &quot;Met his enemies on a fair plain near to Mortimer&#x27;s Cross, not far from Hereford East&quot;. The usual placing of the battle in the valley beside the bridge is not &#x27;a fair plain&#x27; but the area around Battle Acre Cottage or Drybridge House—to the south-south-east—meets that description.
Andy Lamkowski also makes the point that if the Lancastrian force approached from the south rather than the west then a north/south alignment is more likely, Edward would be deploying across the valley width to prevent them moving north and would have the advantage of anchoring his flanks on the slopes of the narrowing valley and/or the River Lugg itself.

==In Shakespeare==
Shakespeare described this parhelion phenomenon and its portentous symbolism in Act Two Scene One of &quot;Henry VI, Part 3&quot;:

:Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
:Not separated with the racking clouds,
:But sever&#x27;d in a pale clear-shining sky.
:See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
:As if they vow&#x27;d some league inviolable:
:Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
:In this the heaven figures some event.

Shakespeare omits mention of the battle.

<text>Niagara-on-the-Lake(NOTL) is a town in Ontario, Canada. It is located on the Niagara Peninsula at the point where the Niagara River meets Lake Ontario, across the river from New York, United States. Niagara-on-the-Lake is in the Niagara Region of Ontario and is the only town in Canada that has a lord mayor. It had a population of 19,088 as of the 2021 Canadian census.

Niagara-on-the-Lake is important in the history of Canada: it served as the first capital of the province of Upper Canada, the predecessor of Ontario. It was called Newark from 1792 to 1797. During the War of 1812, the town, the two former villages of St. David&#x27;s and Queenston, and Fort George were the sites of numerous battles following the American invasion of Upper Canada, and the town was razed. Niagara-on-the-Lake is home to the oldest Catholic church, the second-oldest Anglican church in Ontario, and the oldest surviving golf course in North America.

Today, Niagara-on-the-Lake draws tourists with its colonial-style buildings, the Shaw Festival, Fort George, wineries, an outlet mall on the highway, and its proximity to Niagara Falls. The Niagara Region has the second-highest percentage of seniors in Ontario.

==History==
Before the British settlers came, the point where Fort Mississauga is situated was inhabited by at least three Native American tribes: the Neutral (15th century); Seneca (late 17th century); and Mississauga (18th century).

The settlement was founded in 1781 as Butlersburg in honour of Colonel John Butler, the commander of Butler&#x27;s Rangers. It was later renamed West Niagara to distinguish it from Fort Niagara. It was a British military base and haven for pro-British loyalists fleeing the United States during the volatile aftermath of the American Revolution. Renamed Newark by Lieutenant-Governor John Graves Simcoe in 1792, it was the first capital of Upper Canada (now the province of Ontario). The Upper Canada legislature first met at Navy Hall on September 17, 1792, and met there four more times until June 1796. In 1797, Simcoe moved the capital to York because Newark was very close to the border with the U.S. Newark was renamed Niagara in 1798.

Fort George was built just south of the settlement in 1796–1799. During the War of 1812, Niagara was taken in the Battle of Fort George by American forces in May 1813 after a two-day bombardment by cannon from Fort Niagara and the American fleet, followed by a fierce battle. After capturing Fort George, the Americans built their own fortifications there. The British retook the fort in December 1813 but abandoned it in 1815. The tiny portion of the fort that still remains has been fully restored. Fort Mississauga was built starting in 1813 but was not completed until after the war in 1816. During the war, the settlement of Niagara was razed and burnt to the ground by American soldiers as they withdrew to Fort Niagara. (Afterwards, on December 19, 1813, the British captured Fort Niagara.) The citizens rebuilt Niagara after the war, with the residential quarter around Queen Street and toward King Street, where the new court house was rebuilt out of range of Fort Niagara&#x27;s cannons.

The &quot;Smith&#x27;s Canadian Gazetteer&quot; of 1846 describes &quot;Niagara (formerly called Newark)&quot; as follows:

It has been a place of considerable trade. On the east side of the town is a large military reserve. About half a mile up the river are the ruins of Fort George, where the remains of General Brock were originally interred; they were removed. A new town-hall and court-house are intended to be erected by the town. There is a fire brigade with two engines and a hook and ladder company. Churches and chapels total five. Two newspapers are published weekly ... Steamboats run daily, as long as the weather will allow of it, from Toronto ... The Niagara Harbour and Dock Company were incorporated in the year 1830 ... the vessels turned out by the Company [include] the steamboat &quot;London,&quot; which commenced running in the spring of 1845, the fastest boat on the upper lakes ... The Company usually employ about 150 hands; and, when particularly busy, have employed as many as 350. There is also on the premises a marine railway, large enough for hauling up vessels of the first class. Post Office, post every day. Professions and Trades.—Three physicians and surgeons, nine lawyers, twelve stores, taverns, two chemists and druggists, three booksellers and stationers, two saddlers, four wagon makers, two watchmakers, two tallow-chandlers, marble works, two printers, two cabinet makers, one hatter, four bakers, two livery stables, two tinsmiths, three blacksmiths, six tailors, seven shoemakers, one tobacconist, one bank agency, ... large quantities of apples, peaches, and cider are shipped annually.

In 1859, the town built its first public school, Niagara Public School. The town&#x27;s present name of Niagara-on-the-Lake was adopted around 1880 as a postal address to distinguish the town from Niagara Falls. The name was officially adopted in 1970 when the Town of Niagara and the Township of Niagara merged.

===Historic sites===
Most of the former military sites, such as Fort George, Navy Hall, and Butler&#x27;s Barracks, have been restored. Fort George&#x27;s restoration was done as a &quot;Make Work Project,&quot; guided by plans from the Royal Engineers during the Great Depression of the 1930s, an early example of historic preservation. Fort George National Historic Site is a focal point in a collection of War of 1812 sites, which, collectively, are managed by Parks Canada under the name Niagara National Historic Sites. That administrative name includes several national historic sites: Fort Mississauga, Mississauga Point Lighthouse (1804, the first on the Great Lakes), Navy Hall, Butler&#x27;s Barracks, and Queenston Heights.

Niagara-on-the-Lake features historical plaques. Critical battles in defence of Upper Canada took place here, and at nearby at Queenston and St. David&#x27;s, both now part of Niagara-on-the-Lake. In one of these, Laura Secord gained her fame (She is known for having walked 32 km out of American-occupied territory in 1813 to warn British forces of an impending American attack). The town was both as a stop on the Underground Railroad for those travelling further into Upper Canada and as a refuge in its own right.

Its stock of regency and classical revival buildings, considered the best in the country from the post-War of 1812 period, led the Historic Sites and Monuments Board of Canada to recommend the town&#x27;s historic district be designated a National Historic Site of Canada, a designation which was approved in 2003. The historic centre had been designated as a provincial Heritage Conservation District under the &quot;Ontario Heritage Act&quot; in 1986. Although it did not make the final list, the historic district was considered for nomination as a World Heritage Site.

<text>Monte Cook (born January 29, 1968) is an American professional tabletop role-playing game designer and writer, best known for his work on &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;.

== Role-playing industry career ==

=== Early years ===
Cook has been a professional game designer since 1988, working primarily on role-playing games. Much of his early work was for Iron Crown Enterprises as an editor and writer for the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; and &quot;Champions&quot; lines. Cook was at one point the editor in charge of both the &quot;Campaign Classics&quot; line of books for the &quot;Hero System&quot; and the &quot;Rolemaster&quot; line. Cook worked for Iron Crown Enterprises for four years; two as a freelancer and two as a full-time designer. During this period, Cook wrote the multi-genre setting &quot;Dark Space&quot; (1990), which was a blend of fantasy, science-fiction, and horror. Cook became the line editor for &quot;Hero System&quot;, replacing Rob Bell, who left ICE in 1990. Cook left ICE in the early 1990s.

=== TSR ===
Cook began working for TSR in 1992 as a freelancer: &quot;writing a whole slew of stuff for the old Marvel game that never came out because the game got canceled&quot;. In 1994 Cook came to work at TSR as a game designer. Cook designed &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; modules such as &quot;Labyrinth of Madness&quot; (1995) and &quot;A Paladin in Hell&quot; (1998), and dozens of supplements to the Planescape line including &quot;The Planewalker&#x27;s Handbook&quot; (1996) and &quot;Dead Gods&quot; (1998). Cook also designed the conspiracy game &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; in 1999.

=== Wizards of the Coast ===
After TSR was purchased by Wizards of the Coast, Cook became a senior designer, and was part of the team working on the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; game&#x27;s third edition. Cook, Jonathan Tweet, and Skip Williams all contributed to the 3rd edition &quot;Players Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, and &quot;Monster Manual&quot;, and then each designer wrote one of the books based on those contributions. Cook was proud of the work he did on the new &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot;, especially after Gary Gygax gave his team feedback on the book: &quot;He said that the material in the new &quot;DMG&quot; would help him become a better DM... That was really cool–and satisfying in a &#x27;completion of the circle&#x27; sort of way.&quot; In 2000, Cook said of his involvement with Wizards of the Coast and &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s a great time to be working here... because every product is big, important, and innovative.&quot; Cook also worked on &quot;Return to the Temple of Elemental Evil&quot;, and the d20 &quot;Call of Cthulhu&quot; (February 2002).

=== d20 licensed works and Malhavoc Press ===
Cook left Wizards of the Coast in 2001. Cook wrote the adventure &quot;Beyond the Veil&quot; (2001), one of the later releases in the &quot;Penumbra&quot; line of d20 System books from Atlas Games. Cook formed the new company Malhavoc Press in 2001 to work with the Sword and Sorcery Studios imprint of White Wolf, starting with the d20 &quot;The Book of Eldritch Might&quot; (2001) as his first product. &quot;The Book of Eldritch Might&quot; was the first commercial book sold exclusively as a PDF to be published by a print company. It was an immediate success and has been credited with demonstrating the viability of PDF publishing within the role-playing industry. This and other early Malhavoc products were initially released only in electronic format, though print versions of most of them have since been released by White Wolf, Inc. Malhavoc Press worked with Fiery Dragon Productions after Fiery Dragon ended their arrangement with Sword &amp; Sorcery in 2002, and the majority of the licensed work from Fiery Dragon was through their arrangement with Malhavoc. Cook&#x27;s work under the Malhavoc banner has included &quot;Arcana Unearthed: A Variant Players Handbook&quot;. Cook set the d20 rulebook &quot;Arcana Unearthed&quot; in his giant-dominated world of &quot;The Diamond Throne&quot;.

He caused controversy in mid-2004 by exclusively selling his electronic d20 material with the DriveThruRPG.com store, which then used only a proprietary digital rights management-encrypted PDF system. He eventually succumbed to pressure from his customers to sell his products in standard-PDF form, and DriveThruRPG has more recently done the same.

In August 2006, Malhavoc released &quot;Ptolus&quot;, a campaign setting based on Monte Cook&#x27;s home game that was used as the playtest campaign for the third edition D&amp;D designers.

Shortly after the release of &quot;Ptolus&quot;, which Cook has often described as the culmination of his original ambitions for Malhavoc, he announced that he would be focusing on writing fiction and other unspecified forms of creative work, rather than role-playing games, for the foreseeable future. White Wolf and Goodman Games announced his final RPG books. &quot;Monte Cook&#x27;s World of Darkness&quot;, his own take on White Wolf&#x27;s modern horror setting, was released at Gen Con 2007. From Goodman Games is &quot;Dungeon Crawl Classics: #50, Vault of the Iron Overlord&quot;, which was also targeted for the same Gen Con release.

However, due to demand by fans reading his LiveJournal, and posting their desires on the Malhavoc message boards, Monte Cook released one more RPG product in early 2008, &quot;The Book of Experimental Might&quot;. This was quickly followed by &quot;The Book of Experimental Might II: Bloody, Bold and Resolute&quot;.

=== &quot;D&amp;D Next&quot; ===
Cook returned to Wizards of the Coast in 2011. On September 20, 2011, Mike Mearls announced that Cook would be taking over his &quot;Legends &amp; Lore&quot; column for the Wizards of the Coast website. In January 2012, it was revealed that Cook was to be the lead designer for the 5th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. In April 2012, Cook announced his departure from Wizards of the Coast due to &quot;differences of opinion with the company&quot; but not &quot;with [his] fellow designers&quot;.

=== Monte Cook Games and &quot;Numenera&quot; ===
Cook co-founded Monte Cook Games, LLC with Shanna Germain in 2012, which is a roleplaying game company that has produced &quot;Numenera&quot;, &quot;The Strange&quot;, &quot;The Cypher System Rulebook&quot;, &quot;Invisible Sun&quot;, and &quot;No Thank You, Evil!&quot; which went to press in Fall 2015 after a Kickstarter campaign raised over $100,000 to fund its publication.

&quot;Numenera&quot; is a Kickstarter-funded table-top RPG created by Cook, set a billion years in the future in a science fantasy and post-apocalyptic setting with streamlined rules that prioritize the story, the action, and the wild ideas. It raised over $500,000 (more than 25 times its goal of $20,000). System playtesting was announced on October 30, 2012, and the game was released on August 14, 2013. Cook has stated that David &quot;Zeb&quot; Cook&#x27;s (no relation) Planescape fantasy world was a significant influence on concepts in &quot;Numenera&quot;.

The Ninth World of &quot;Numenera&quot; was also the setting for a 2013 release of the &quot;Thunderstone Advance&quot; deck-building game by Alderac Entertainment Group, as well as the 2017 video game &quot;&quot;, which was developed by InXile Entertainment after a successful Kickstarter campaign.

&quot;The Strange&quot; is a Kickstarter-funded table-top RPG created by Cook and Bruce Cordell using the same Cypher System ruleset as &quot;Numenera&quot;. The game, which involves traveling through different worlds known as Recursions, was released in August 2014.

&quot;Invisible Sun&quot; is a Kickstarter-funded table-top role-playing game created by Monte Cook Games, with a street date released of September 20, 2018. It is a surreal fantasy game with many game accessories.

&quot;Stealing Stories for the Devil&quot; is a Kickstarter-funded table-top role-playing created by Monte Cook Games. It was released in February 2023. It is billed as a reality-altering heist game, where player characters use different abilities to lie to reality. It is a boxed set with board game-like aspects.

&quot;Tidal Blades, the Roleplaying Game&quot; is a Kickstarter-funded table-top RPG created by Cook and Shanna Germain using the Cypher System ruleset. The game was released in August 14 2024. It is a tropical fantasy game located around the near islands and coastal city of Naviri, surrounded by a frozen temporal rift called The Fold. It was Kickstarted along &quot;Tidal Blades 2, Rise of the Unfolders&quot;, the boardgame.

<doc id="248807" wikidata="Q4836971" url="?curid=248807" title="B News">
<text>B News was a Usenet news server developed at the University of California, Berkeley by Matt Glickman and Mary Ann Horton as a replacement for A News. It was used on Unix systems from 1981 into the 1990s and is the reference implementation for the &quot;de facto&quot; Usenet standard described in and . Releases from 2.10.2 were maintained by UUNET founder Rick Adams.

B News introduced numerous changes from its predecessor. Articles used an extensible format with named headers, first by using labeled equivalents to the A News format. A further refinement in 1983 with News B2.10 was a move to e-mail-compatible headers, to ease message transfers with the ARPAnet. A history database was introduced, allowing articles to be placed in separate directories by newsgroup, improving retrieval speeds and easing the development of separate newsreader programs such as rn. Support was provided for expiring old articles, and control messages (special articles that can automatically cause articles to be erased, or newsgroups to be added or removed) were added.
News B2.10 introduced the hierarchical article storage format carried into C News and InterNetNews, and still commonly seen in many newsreaders and cache programs. Before B2.10, all groups were stored beneath a single parent directory, impairing performance when the group list became large, and requiring that the first 14 characters be unique among all groups due to an old Unix limitation. The hierarchical layout split the groups at the periods, reducing directory sizes and ameliorating the uniqueness problem.

B2.10 contained limited support for moderated newsgroups, with posters needing to manually mail in submissions to an intermediate party who would post articles on their behalf. Moderated groups needed to be prefixed with &quot;mod.&quot; In 1986, version B2.11 allowed moderated newsgroups to appear in any hierarchy, and it transparently mailed out moderated group submissions using the normal posting software.

The last B News patch set was released in 1989, after which Rick Adams declared the product obsolete.

About 1989, Eric S. Raymond attempted a rewrite of B News, known alternately as Teenage Mutant Ninja Netnews and News 3.0. A rough version of the software was released and drew attention from around the network, but the project was abandoned shortly thereafter.
