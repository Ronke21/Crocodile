<text>is Professor Emeritus in the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Tsukuba and Director of the Institute of Peace Linguistics. He is also Professor in the Department of English at Matsuyama University.

==Education and career==
Tsuda was born in Kanagawa, Japan in 1950. He majored in English and graduated from Yokohama National University in 1973. He received his M.A. in TEFL (Teaching English as a Foreign Language) in 1978 and his Ph.D. in Speech Communication in 1985 from Southern Illinois University at Carbondale.

Tsuda held several faculty positions in his academic career. He was associate professor in the Faculty of Economics at Nagasaki University from 1986 to 1988. He then moved to Nagoya University where he was associate professor in the Institute of Languages and Cultures from 1988 to 1993 and Professor in the Department of International Communication and in the Graduate School of International Development from 1993 to 2001.

Tsuda had been Professor in the Doctoral Program in Modern Cultures and Public Policies in the Graduate School of Humanities and Social Sciences at the University of Tsukuba since 2001. He retired from the University of Tsukuba and founded the Institute of Peace Linguistics in Ibaraki Prefecture in 2014. He is currently Professor in the Department of English at Matsuyama University in Ehime Prefecture.

Tsuda was Visiting Professor at the International Research Center for Japanese Studies in Kyoto in 1996 and at the College of San Mateo in California in 2007. He was also Braj Kachru Fellow in the &quot;Internationalization Forum&quot; program in 1996 and Visiting Fellow in 1999 at the East-West Center in Honolulu, Hawaii.

Tsuda&#x27;s academic interests include language policy, cross-cultural psychoanalysis, and international and intercultural communication. Among his publications are &quot;Language Inequality and Distortion in Intercultural Communication: A Critical Theory Approach&quot; (John Benjamins, 1986), &quot;Language, Education, and Intercultural Communication&quot; (Nagasaki University, 1988), &quot;Eigo Shihai-no Kouzou&quot; [&quot;The Structure of the Dominance of English&quot;] (Daisan Shokan, 1990), &quot;Shinryaku-suru Eigo, Hangeki-suru Nihongo&quot; [&quot;The Invading English, The Counter-Attacking Japanese&quot;] (PHP Institute, 1996), and &quot;Eigo Shihai-to Kotoba-no Byoudou&quot; [&quot;The Hegemony of English and Linguistic Equality&quot;] (Keio University Press, 2006).

==The Ecology of Language Paradigm==
Tsuda is well known as a critic of the hegemony of English and as an advocate of linguistic and cultural pluralism. He believes that the domination of English is tantamount to linguicism and linguicide, and that addressing the problem of linguistic hegemony is crucial to the development of human and cultural security. In an article in &quot;The San Matean&quot;, a San Mateo Community College newspaper, dated March 19, 2007, Tsuda was quoted to say: &quot;It is more important to be students learning other languages than being a teacher only teaching one.&quot; He proposed the &quot;ecology of language&quot; paradigm as opposed to the &quot;diffusion of English&quot; paradigm.

Tsuda urges international and intercultural communication scholars to recognize the hegemony of English as a subject of academic inquiry in the fields especially in the English-speaking countries. He also suggests that English-language teaching professionals incorporate the ecology of language paradigm into the contents and methods of teaching as well as teacher education. Finally, he insists that both native speakers and non-native speakers of English learn the philosophy of the ecology of language so that they will become more sensitive to the ethical aspects of international and intercultural communication.

<text>No Jacket Required is the third solo studio album by English drummer and singer-songwriter Phil Collins. It was released on 18 February 1985 by Virgin Records in the UK and by Atlantic and WEA internationally.

After finishing touring commitments with Genesis and working with Eric Clapton in 1984, Collins resumed his solo career and started work on a new album. He made a conscious decision to write more uptempo and dance-oriented songs, as much of his previous material was influenced by matters surrounding his first divorce. The album features Helen Terry, Peter Gabriel, and Sting as guest backing vocalists. Some songs, like &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot; and &quot;Sussudio&quot;, were based around improvisation, and others, like &quot;Long Long Way to Go&quot;, had a political message.

&quot;No Jacket Required&quot; was received favourably by the majority of critics and was a huge worldwide commercial success, reaching number one in the UK for five consecutive weeks and for seven non-consecutive weeks in the US. It was the second-best-selling album of 1985 in the UK, behind Dire Straits&#x27; &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot;. &quot;One More Night&quot;, &quot;Sussudio&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot; were released as singles with corresponding music videos. All four were top ten hits on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart, with &quot;Sussudio&quot; and &quot;One More Night&quot; reaching number one. The three singles released in the UK all reached the top 20. Some tracks were featured on the television shows &quot;Miami Vice&quot; and &quot;Cold Case&quot;, and &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot; was re-written and re-recorded for the episode &quot;Phil the Shill&quot;.

In 2001, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; was certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America for selling 12 million copies in the US and amassed worldwide sales of over 25 million copies, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It won three Grammy Awards, including Album of the Year. The No Jacket Required World Tour saw Collins perform 85 concerts which culminated with a performance at both Live Aid shows in London and Philadelphia. Remixes of six songs from the album were released on the compilation &quot;12&quot;ers&quot; (1987). In 2010, it was among ten albums nominated for the best British album of the previous 30 years by the Brit Awards. It ranked No. 74 on the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s &quot;Definitive 200&quot; list. A remastered deluxe edition with updated artwork and bonus tracks was released in 2016.

==Production and recording==
After touring commitments with Genesis and completion of work on Eric Clapton&#x27;s album &quot;Behind the Sun&quot;, Collins focused his attention to his third solo album upon returning from his wedding honeymoon in September 1984. He wrote and demoed the songs within 5 weeks using his 8-track recording setup at Old Croft, later overdubbing other elements like drums, guitars and horns on 24-track at The Townhouse studios - similar to his previous two solo albums. Sessions for what would become &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; marked his conscious attempt to move to a more uptempo sound, as much of his previous material was influenced by his first divorce: &quot;I have a notion of what I want to do: break out of this &#x27;love song&#x27; box that I&#x27;ve found myself in. I&#x27;ll make a dance album. Or, at least, an album with a couple of uptempo tracks.&quot; Some of the songs emerged from Collins&#x27; improvisations with a drum machine, including &quot;One More Night&quot; and &quot;Sussudio&quot;. Collins started singing &quot;one more night&quot; to an attempt of making a beat similar to The Jacksons and improvised &quot;sus-sussudio&quot; in another. He tried to replace the lyric with another phrase but decided to keep that way, leading to lyrics about a schoolboy crush on a girl at his school. Another song created mostly through improvisation, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot;, was described by Collins as having been written mostly during the recordings for his first solo album, &quot;Face Value&quot;. Collins added that he does not fully understand the meaning of the lyrics, described by reviewer Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; as &quot;vague, sketching the outlines of a melodrama but withholding the full story&quot;.

Other songs were written with a more personal message. &quot;Long Long Way to Go&quot; is often considered one of Collins&#x27; more popular songs never to be released as a single and was at that point in his career his most political song. Former Police lead vocalist Sting provided backing vocals for the song. Sting and Collins first met through Band Aid and would later perform together in Live Aid. Collins was working on a song and thought that Sting, having participated in Band Aid, would relate to it very easily. Collins asked Sting to help him provide vocals for this song, and Sting accepted.

&quot;Doesn&#x27;t Anybody Stay Together Anymore&quot; is another song in which Collins was making a personal message. The song was made in response to everyone around him getting a divorce, including his manager, friends and himself years before. Collins later said that he sang this at Charles, Prince of Wales&#x27; 40th-birthday party, not knowing that the Prince&#x27;s divorce from his wife, Diana, Princess of Wales, would happen a short time later. The Phil Collins Big Band played this live on tour.

&quot;Take Me Home&quot; is another song in which the meaning was originally very vague. At first listening, it appears that the song is about going home, but this is not true. Collins has stated that the song lyrics refer to a patient in a mental institution, and that it is based on the novel &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;. Peter Gabriel, Helen Terry and Sting all provide backing vocals.

&quot;We Said Hello Goodbye&quot; appeared as a B-side to &quot;Take Me Home&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot; originally, and as an &quot;extra track&quot; on the CD release of the album. Producer Arif Mardin composed the beginning portion of the song. A remix of the song with additional guitars and without an orchestra was released the following year (1986) on the soundtrack for the movie, &quot;Playing for Keeps&quot;. This remixed version received some radio airplay around the time of the soundtrack&#x27;s release (which coincided with the &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; period), though it did not chart. Collins has mused that the song is unfairly classed as a &quot;second class citizen&quot;, stating that the song would have been looked at differently if it were added to the album. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot; reviewer Caryn James, the song is &quot;a straightforward comment on leaving home&quot;.

&quot;The Man with the Horn&quot; was originally recorded during sessions for Collins&#x27; second solo album &quot;Hello, I Must Be Going!&quot; in 1982. However, the song was not released until it appeared as the B-side to &quot;Sussudio&quot; in the UK and as the B-side to &quot;One More Night&quot; in the United States. Collins has said that he has &quot;no emotional attachment&quot; to the song. Music by The Jackson 5 inspired Collins to write the song &quot;I Like the Way&quot;, which also did not appear on the album, originally appearing as the B-side to &quot;One More Night&quot; in the UK and &quot;Sussudio&quot; in the US. He called the song &quot;dodgy&quot; and has cited it among his least favourite of his songs.

==Title and cover==
The album is named after an incident at The Pump Room restaurant in Chicago, Illinois. Collins, entering the restaurant with former Led Zeppelin lead vocalist Robert Plant, was denied admittance because he did not meet the restaurant&#x27;s dress code of &quot;jacket required&quot; for dinner, while Plant was allowed in. Collins was wearing a jacket and argued about it. The &quot;maître d&#x27;hôtel&quot; argued that the jacket was not &quot;proper&quot;. Collins said in an interview with &quot;Playboy&quot; that, at that point, he was as angry as he had ever been.

After the incident, Collins often appeared on shows such as &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&quot; and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot;, denouncing the restaurant and telling his story. The management of the restaurant later sent him a complimentary sport coat and an apology letter, stating that he could come to the restaurant wearing whatever he wanted.

The cover image of &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; (a continuation of the &#x27;facial close-up&#x27; theme begun with &quot;Face Value&quot;) of Collins&#x27; face lit by red/orange light was to emphasise the &quot;hot&quot;, up-tempo nature of the album. Collins stated in his autobiography &quot;Not Dead Yet&quot;, that glycerol was sprayed onto his forehead during the photography session to give the illusion of perspiration. In the photography for the album&#x27;s inner sleeve and subsequent publicity materials, Collins appeared to lampoon the incident by wearing a suit that was several sizes too big.

==Release and commercial performance==
&quot;No Jacket Required&quot; was released on 18 February 1985. The lead singles were &quot;Sussudio&quot; in the UK and &quot;One More Night&quot; in the US. Both songs had music videos that were shot at a London pub owned by Richard Branson, featuring Collins playing both before and after the building closes.

In the first week of March, shortly after Collins won a Grammy for &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, the album debuted at the top spot of the UK Albums Chart and 24th in the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. It also got to tenth in the German charts and 15th in Canada. By the end of the month, it had climbed to number one in America as well. Collins had become the 15th British artist to top both the album and single &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, as &quot;One More Night&quot; was leading the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 that same week. The same thing was happening in the UK, where Collins&#x27; duet with Philip Bailey, &quot;Easy Lover&quot;, was the UK Singles Chart number one. &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; was number one on the US charts for seven weeks, and on the British chart for five.

&quot;Sussudio&quot; was the first track to be released as a single in the UK, where it peaked at number 12. It was the second single to be released in the US and entered frequent rotation on MTV in May 1985. By 6 July 1985, both the single and the album had reached number one on their respective US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. &quot;One More Night&quot; was Collins&#x27; second US number-one single, following &quot;Against All Odds&quot; and was his fourth single to reach the top ten in the UK, peaking at number four on the singles chart. Its B-side in the UK was &quot;I Like the Way&quot;, while the US version featured &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot;.

Meanwhile, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot;, a single that Collins only released in the US, peaked at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 charts during late September 1985, and the B-side of the single was &quot;We Said Hello Goodbye&quot;. Collins had difficulty conceptualising a plot for the corresponding music video. He decided to create a gag video based on this difficulty. In the video, he provides conceptual ideas to various clients and directors. Collins parodies several other videos, including those by Michael Jackson, David Lee Roth, Elton John, The Cars and The Police. The singer also filmed parodies of &quot;Mad Max&quot;, western films and samurai movies.

&quot;Take Me Home&quot; was the final single released from the album and has been included in all of his concert tours since The No Jacket Required World Tour. It reached number seven on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; charts and number 19 on the UK charts. The song was not slated for a single release, but the label decided to do so after it became an airplay hit on several US radio stations who decided to play the track. &quot;Take Me Home&quot; also received a video where Collins sung in various locations around the world.

The studio version of &quot;Who Said I Would&quot; was not released as a single, but a live version from the &quot;Serious Hits... Live!&quot; album was issued as a single in the US, reaching number 73 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. A music video of the original version was filmed for the &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; home video and featured footage of Collins playing the song live. Certain songs that were not released as singles still charted on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts, including &quot;Inside Out&quot;, which went to number nine on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart. &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot;, though not released as a single (nor was it included on the album), charted at number 38 on the Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks.

&quot;No Jacket Required&quot; remains Collins&#x27; highest-selling album, having sold over 12 million copies as of 2001 in the US, where it was certified diamond status. Twenty years after its release, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; remains among the 50 highest-selling albums in the US. In the UK, the album was certified 6× platinum, selling over 1.8 million copies. It has also sold over 20 million copies worldwide. A video produced by Atlantic Video in 1986 was also released and included the four original music videos of the four released singles and a live performance of &quot;Who Said I Would&quot;. Alternate versions of six songs from &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; were included on the remix album &quot;12&quot;ers&quot;, released in January 1988.

The album was re-released using a flat transfer done by Steve Hoffman for the Audio Fidelity label in 2011. It was reissued as a deluxe edition on CD, vinyl and digital on 15 April 2016, including a new second disc with bonus tracks.

==&quot;No Jacket Required EP&quot; (home video)==
In 1985, Atlantic also released a home video called &quot;No Jacket Required EP&quot;. The collection consisted of the music videos &quot;Sussudio&quot;, &quot;One More Night&quot;, &quot;Who Said I Would&quot;, &quot;Don&#x27;t Lose My Number&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot;.

==Critical reception==

The reception for the album was mostly positive. Geoff Orens of AllMusic, in a retrospective review, said that while some of the songs are &quot;dated&quot;, the album contains &quot;standout tracks&quot;. He describes &quot;Long Long Way to Go&quot; as &quot;one of Collins&#x27; most effective ballads&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot; as &quot;pulsating&quot;. Orens went on to say &quot;It&#x27;s not a completely satisfying recording, but it is the best example of one of the most dominating and influential styles of the 1980s.&quot; Lori E. Pike of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that &quot;Collins&#x27; recipe of tense vocals spiced with saucy horns and splashy electro-jitterbugging synthesisers often leaves little room for real feeling to squeeze through. When he slows down and lets his smoldering moodiness take over, the effect is magical.&quot;

Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said that the album was &quot;refreshing&quot; and that Collins was &quot;adept&quot; at setting a suspenseful or menacing mood. Holden described &quot;Only You Know and I Know&quot; as an &quot;angry love song&quot; that had some sampling of Motown-style music mixed in. &quot;In &#x27;One More Night&#x27;, Mr. Collins&#x27;s recent number-one hit, a ticking snare drum injects a whisper of lurking fear into a song that suggests a sweeter, tenderer reprise of &#x27;Against All Odds&#x27;&quot;, says Holden. Holden concluded by saying &quot;On the surface, &quot;No Jacket Required&quot;, is an album bursting with soulful hooks and bright peppy tunes. But beneath its shiny exterior, Mr. Collins&#x27; drums and his voice carry on a disjunctive, enigmatic dialogue between heart and mind, obsession and repression.&quot;
&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewer David Fricke said &quot;Phil Collins&#x27; sudden transformation from the balding bantam drummer for a prosperous British art-rock group into a mainstream pop heartthrob might seem one of the Eighties&#x27; most improbable success stories. But judging from the sly craft and warm, low-key humour of his solo records and his successful productions for Philip Bailey and Frida, Collins&#x27; newfound fame was inevitable.&quot; Robert Hilburn of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; originally disliked the song &quot;One More Night&quot;, but later praised the song, saying that &quot;Collins&#x27; soulful but polite vocal style is also capable of capturing the pain of going through yet one more night without her.&quot; &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot; writer Lennox Samuels said that &quot;No Jacket Required (Atlantic) is what fans have come to expect from Phil Collins—lots of horns and syncopation, heavy rhythm.&quot;

Even those who were not normally fans of Collins&#x27; work liked the album. Michael R. Smith of &quot;The Daily Vault&quot; wrote &quot;Anomaly or not, it is indeed the album that Phil deserves to be remembered for.&quot; Stephen Williams of &quot;Newsday&quot; said that the album was &quot;loaded with musical hooks and textured arrangements... it also lacks the tense edge that was part of Collins&#x27; work with Genesis.&quot; Keegan Hamilton of the &quot;Riverfront Times&quot; said that the album was &quot;The 80&#x27;s Dance Pop Special: A smooth synthesiser groove, with an order of keyboards, drum machines, and horns on the side,&quot; adding that &quot;Sussudio&quot; was the best track on the album, saying that it&#x27;s &quot;catchy gibberish.&quot; Hamilton says that &quot;One More Night&quot; was the worst song on the album, saying that &quot;The album&#x27;s introspective slow jam wallows in self-pity.&quot;

On the negative side, Marty Racine of the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot; said that &quot;I Don&#x27;t Wanna Know&quot; and &quot;Take Me Home&quot; were the only songs to &quot;rise above the crowd&quot; and that Collins focused too much on his singing and less on his drumming, &quot;which can be captivating&quot;. Racine also added that the album makes the listener feel a little &quot;cold&quot;, but admired that the singer was &quot;playing the game as well as anyone&quot;.

Writing an article in defence of Collins in 2010, Gary Mills of &quot;The Quietus&quot; described the album as &quot;determined dross&quot; which Collins did not deserve to have his career judged by. In 2013, music critic Tom Service of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was similarly scathing, saying the album had not stood the test of time and was &quot;unlistenable to today&quot;, singling out &quot;Sussudio&quot; for particular criticism, arguing: &quot;the production, the drum machine, the inane sincerity of the lyrics; there&#x27;s no colder or more superficial sound in popular music, precisely because it takes itself so seriously.&quot; He also compared it unfavourably with the enduring appeal of Collins&#x27; 1980s contemporaries such as the Human League and—in particular—the Pet Shop Boys, saying the latter were &quot;geniuses by comparison&quot;.

At the 28th Annual Grammy Awards, Collins was nominated in five categories. The album won the award for Album of the Year, and Collins won Best Pop Vocal Performance, Male. Collins shared the Producer of the Year (Non-Classical) award with co-producer of the album, Hugh Padgham. The home video &quot;No Jacket Required EP&quot; received a nomination for Best Music Video, Short Form. In 1986 the album received an American Music Award nomination for Favorite Pop/Rock Album. At the Brit Awards in 1986 the album received an award for British Album of the Year.

==Influence and legacy==
At the Brit Awards in 2010, the album was one of ten nominees for Brits Album of 30 Years in a poll of BBC Radio 2 listeners; the winner was &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot; by Oasis. &quot;Sussudio&quot; is one of Collins&#x27; most famous songs and is referenced in many different media, including books, stand-up comedy acts and television shows. He has said that this is the song people most often sing to him when they spot him on the street. In the book and film adaptation of &quot;American Psycho&quot;, main character Patrick Bateman briefly discusses it, amongst other work by Collins. The synthesiser riff was heavily criticised for sounding too much like Prince&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;1999&quot;, a similarity that Collins does not deny, citing that he is a big fan of Prince&#x27;s work.

Three songs recorded during the &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; sessions aired on episodes of the television show &quot;Miami Vice&quot;. &quot;Take Me Home&quot; appeared in &quot;The Prodigal Son&quot;, the premiere of the second season. &quot;Long Long Way to Go&quot; was played in the closing scene of the season 2 finale &quot;Sons and Lovers&quot;, during the funeral for Ricardo Tubbs&#x27; girlfriend and son. &quot;The Man with the Horn&quot; was re-written for an episode of &quot;Vice&quot; in which Collins guest-starred as a con artist who gets in trouble with cocaine distributors. The re-written version was titled &quot;Life Is a Rat Race&quot;.

&quot;Take Me Home&quot; was the closing theme song for the World Wrestling Federation&#x27;s television show, &quot;Saturday Night&#x27;s Main Event&quot; for several years in the late 1980s. In 2003, the hip-hop group Bone Thugs-n-Harmony based their song &quot;Home&quot; on this single. That version of the song featured the original song&#x27;s chorus and hit number 19 on the UK charts.

As years went on, Collins became unhappy with the album and grew to dislike it. In a 2016 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, he said in retrospect that it is among his least favourite records he had made: &quot;At the time, I wasn&#x27;t being me. I&#x27;ve grown up a bit now and much prefer to play songs that are me. I only play a bit part in that one.&quot;

==Tour==

The album was followed by a concert tour in 1985 named The No Jacket Required World Tour. For the tour, Collins retained his usual cast of musicians, including Chester Thompson, Leland Sklar and Daryl Stuermer. The band was nicknamed the &quot;Hot Tub Club&quot;. A television special was recorded in Dallas and aired on HBO, titled &quot;No Jacket Required... Sold Out&quot;. Another television special was recorded for Cinemax for a show titled &quot;Album Flash&quot;, taped in London, England at the Royal Albert Hall.

Reception for the tour was positive as well. Rick Kogan of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; said that &quot;After hearing and observing Collins&#x27; eminently satisfying and frequently spectacular two-hour performance, one is left not with a series of niggling questions about his popularity but rather with renewed admiration for the forcefulness of well crafted songs played in a straightforward manner.&quot;

In interviews during the tour, it was remarked by interviewers that the singer appeared similar to actors Bob Hoskins and Danny DeVito. Collins joked that all three of them could play the Three Bears from the story Goldilocks and the Three Bears. DeVito heard the idea and contacted Collins and Hoskins about making a film. Collins researched bears, and a script was planned. Kim Basinger reportedly wished to play the role of &quot;Goldilocks&quot;. However, problems arose (mostly involving the script), and all three actors abandoned the film.

While on the &quot;No Jacket Required&quot; tour, Collins recorded a song for the movie &quot;White Nights&quot;, titled &quot;Separate Lives&quot;. The song, which was written by Collins&#x27; friend Stephen Bishop, was a duet that Collins performed with Marilyn Martin. In the US, the song went to number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, and it reached number four on the UK charts.

===Live Aid===

The No Jacket Required World Tour ended with Collins performing at both the Wembley Stadium and JFK Stadium Live Aid concerts. Collins claims that it all happened by accident and that both he and the Power Station were going to attend both Live Aid shows as well, but &quot;they all chickened out.&quot; &quot;By default, I was the only one who did it,&quot; he later claimed. Bob Geldof, the organiser of Live Aid, originally asked Collins to be part of Geldof&#x27;s first charity effort, Band Aid. Collins played the drums and performed backing vocals for Band Aid&#x27;s UK number one hit in 1984, &quot;Do They Know It&#x27;s Christmas?&quot;.

Collins first performed with Sting at Wembley, and together they performed &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, &quot;Long Long Way to Go&quot; and &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;, accompanied by saxophonist Branford Marsalis. After Collins finished performing, he flew on Concorde to the Live Aid show in Philadelphia. On the plane, he met Cher and convinced her to be a part of the event. Once there he met Robert Plant, who had asked him if he would perform with him, Jimmy Page, John Paul Jones and Tony Thompson in a Led Zeppelin &quot;reunion&quot; of sorts. He first played drums on &quot;Layla&quot;, &quot;White Room&quot; and &quot;She&#x27;s Waiting&quot; for his friend Eric Clapton. Then, Collins performed &quot;Against All Odds&quot; and &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; and finished the night playing drums for Led Zeppelin&#x27;s aforementioned act. The band has claimed that the performance was unspectacular, and critics place the blame on Collins. However, Collins says that &quot;I would pledge to my dying day that it wasn&#x27;t me,&quot; and that Thompson was racing through some of the performance. Collins later remarked, &quot;... I remember in the middle of the thing, I actually thought, How do I get out of here?&quot; Stephen Williams of &quot;Newsday&quot; commented that Collins&#x27; performance of &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; in Philadelphia &quot;was one of the more moving moments of the day&quot;. Live Aid raised $69 million in its effort. Collins later recalled the event as &quot;extraordinary&quot;.

<text>John Donald Budge (June 13, 1915 – January 26, 2000) was an American tennis player. He is most famous as the first tennis player — male or female — to win all four Grand Slam tournaments in one year and complete the Grand Slam. Budge was the second man to complete the career Grand Slam, after Fred Perry. He won ten majors, of which six were Grand Slam events (consecutively, a men&#x27;s record) and four Pro Slams, the latter achieved on three different surfaces. Budge is considered to have one of the best backhands in the history of tennis, with most observers rating it better than that of later player Ken Rosewall.

Budge is also the only man to have achieved the Triple Crown (winning singles, men&#x27;s doubles and mixed doubles at the same tournament) on three separate occasions (Wimbledon in 1937 and 1938, and the US Championships in 1938), and the only man to have achieved it twice in one year. Budge was the world Number 1 amateur in 1937 and 1938 and world Number 1 professional in 1939, 1940 and 1942.

==Early life==
Budge was born in Oakland, California, the son of Scottish immigrant and former soccer player John &quot;Jack&quot; Budge, who had played several matches for the Rangers reserve team before emigrating to the United States, and Pearl Kincaid Budge. Growing up, he played a variety of sports before taking up tennis at the age of 13 at the urging of his elder brother, Lloyd, who played tennis for the University of California team. He also had an elder sister. He was red-headed, tall and slim, and his height would eventually help what is still considered one of the most powerful serves of all time. Budge studied at the University of California, Berkeley, in late 1933 but left to play tennis with the U.S. Davis Cup auxiliary team.

==Amateur career==
Accustomed to hard-court surfaces in his native California, Budge had difficulty playing on the grass courts in the east.

;1932
Budge reached the semi-finals of the West Canada championships in July, where he lost in five sets to Henry Prusoff. &quot;The Oakland youngster carried brawny Hank Prusoff of Seattle to five sets, surprising most of the onlookers, including the tournament favorite from Puget Sound...Budge playing a calm and collected game all the way and letting the hardhitting Prusoff make the errors. The chop stroke of the Seattle man worked to perfection, particularly In the last set, and he always seemed to have something in reserve.&quot;

;1933
At the Del Monte championships in May, Budge beat Wallace Bates in straight sets in the final. In July, Budge beat John Murio in the final of the California State championship. &quot;Tennis fans will be talking for days of the men&#x27;s singles event and of Budge, whom the experts candidly admit &quot;has everything&quot;. Not only has he the strokes of a champion, but the presence and strategy of one far beyond his years. Murio&#x27;s most burning drives failed to ruffle one of the flaming red hairs on his head&quot;. In the final of the Colorado championships in Denver in July, Budge beat Jack Tidball in five sets.

;1934
Budge beat Bud Chandler in the final in five sets to retain his California State championship title in June. &quot;Chandler went to the net often throughout the match, while Budge elected to play a baseline game almost exclusively, going to the webbing only when forced to by chop or cross court shots; Chandler, exhausted after his gruelling five-set match with John Murio in the semi-final on Saturday, fought largely on his nerve against the Champion, and at the end of yesterday&#x27;s strenuous competition again was completely exhausted.&quot;

;1935
Budge beat Gene Mako in the final of the Palm Springs tournament in April. Budge beat Frank Shields in the final of the Newport Casino tournament in August. In the final of the Pacific Southwest tournament in September, Budge was leading 2 sets to 1 against Roderich Menzel, when Menzel retired, in order to preserve his energy for a mixed doubles match. Budge beat Bobby Riggs in the final of the Pacific Coast championships in October.

;1936
In January, Budge beat Walter Senior in the final of the Northern California indoor event.
In April, Budge won the North and south tournament at Pinehurst beating Hal Surface in three-straight sets for the loss of just one game with a &quot;superb exhibition of speed and control&quot;. In June, Budge beat Dave Jones in the final of the Queen&#x27;s Club tournament. Budge beat Riggs in the final of the Eastern championships in August. Budge beat Perry in the final of the Pacific Southwest tournament in September.
In October, Budge beat Walter Senior in the final of the Pacific Coast championships. In December, Budge beat Riggs in the final of the Southern California midwinter tournament.

;1937
In February, Budge beat Bryan Grant in the final of the Miami tournament.
In June, Budge beat Bunny Austin in the final at the Queen&#x27;s Club tournament. &quot;Seldom has a star of Austin&#x27;s standing absorbed so crushing a defeat in full view of the public.&quot; Budge swept Wimbledon, winning the singles (beating Gottfried von Cramm in straight sets in the final), the men&#x27;s doubles title with Gene Mako, and the mixed doubles crown with Alice Marble. In August, Budge beat Riggs in the final of the Newport Casino tournament. Budge beat von Cramm in the U. S. Championships final which &quot;was a strange see-saw affair in which Budge twice lapsed from his normally brilliant genius guided game&quot;. Budge beat von Cramm again in the final of the Pacific Southwest tournament in September. Budge beat Riggs in the final of the Pacific Coast tournament in October. In December Budge won the Victorian championships beating John Bromwich in the final in a match in which &quot;the hot, humid weather proved trying for the players&quot;. Budge gained the most fame for his match that year against von Cramm in the Davis Cup inter-zone finals against Germany. Trailing 1–4 in the final set, he came back to win 8–6. His victory allowed the US team to advance and to then win the Davis Cup for the first time in 12 years. For his efforts, he was named Associated Press Male Athlete of the Year and he became the first tennis player ever to be voted the James E. Sullivan Award as America&#x27;s top amateur athlete. Budge was ranked World No. 1 amateur by A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Mervyn Weston, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (Sydney), Pierre Gillou, Ned Potter, &quot;The Times&quot;, Harry Hopman, Alfred Chave, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (Brisbane) and Pierre Goldschmidt, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;.

;1938
In 1938, Budge dominated amateur tennis defeating John Bromwich in the Australian final, Roderick Menzel in the French final, Henry &quot;Bunny&quot; Austin at Wimbledon, where he never lost a set (he also won the doubles and mixed doubles), and Gene Mako in the U.S. Championships final (winning doubles and mixed doubles too), to become the first person to win the Grand Slam in tennis. He also is the youngest man in history to complete the &quot;Career Grand Slam&quot; (the four majors in one&#x27;s career) and &quot;Full Grand Slam&quot; (four majors held at one time (in row)). He completed that on June 11, 1938, in winning the French singles, two days before his 23rd birthday. Budge beat Ladislav Hecht in the final of the Czech championships in Prague in July. Budge beat Sidney Wood in the final of the Newport Casino tournament in August. Budge was ranked World No. 1 amateur by Ray Bowers, A. Wallis Myers of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, Pierre Gillou, Ned Potter, Pierre Goldschmidt, &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot; (London), F. Gordon Lowe of &quot;The Scotsman&quot;, Dr. G. H. McElhone of &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;International&quot; of &quot;The Referee&quot;, Mervyn Weston, &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; (Sydney), Jack Crawford and Alfred Chave, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (Brisbane).

==Professional career==

;1939
Budge turned professional in October 1938 after winning the Grand Slam, and thereafter played mostly head-to-head matches. In 1939, he beat the two reigning kings of professional tennis, Ellsworth Vines, 22 matches to 17, and Fred Perry, 28 matches to 8. That year, he also won two major pro tournaments, the French Pro Championship over Vines and the Wembley Pro tournament over Hans Nüsslein. He also finished in first place on the European tour in the summer that also featured Vines, Tilden and Stoefen. Budge was ranked World No. 1 pro by Bowers, Didier Poulain of &quot;L&#x27;Auto&quot; and Alfred Chave, &quot;The Telegraph&quot; (Brisbane).

;1940
There was no World series professional tour in 1940 but seven principal tournaments. Budge kept his world crown by winning four of these events: the Southeastern Pro at Miami Beach (beating Perry in the final), the North &amp; South Pro at Pinehurst (beating Dick Skeen in the final), the National Open at White Sulphur Springs (beating Bruce Barnes in the final) and the United States Pro Championship (beating Perry in the final). Budge was ranked World No. 1 pro by Bowers.

On July 29, 1940, Budge played an exhibition match in front of 2,000 people at the Cosmopolitan Club in Harlem against the American Tennis Association&#x27;s top player Jimmie McDaniel. This is believed to be the first interracial tennis match played before a large audience to take place in the United States.

;1941
In 1941, Budge played another major tour beating the 48-year-old Bill Tilden, the outcome being 47–6 plus one tie. Budge (who had only recently left hospital) lost his opening match in the U. S. Pro championships to John Faunce. &quot;You see, Don was in the hospital a couple of weeks ago fell down some stairs and banged up his nose and left ear. He didn&#x27;t have his court legs today and naturally that was my cue to make him run and. believe me, I never hit better drop shots in my life than I hit today. I could put that ball on a dime!&quot; said Faunce afterwards.

;1942
In 1942, Budge won his last major tour over Bobby Riggs, Frank Kovacs, Perry and Les Stoefen. He also won the U.S. Pro at Forest Hills, crushing Riggs in three straight sets in the final. The crowd booed when Riggs was denied a request to wear spiked shoes. After that many of the top pros, including Budge, became involved in World War 2. Budge was ranked World No. 1 pro by Bowers and by the USPLTA.

==Military service==

In 1942, Budge joined the United States Army Air Forces to serve in World War II. At the beginning of 1943, in an obstacle course, he tore a muscle in his shoulder. In his book &#x27;A Tennis Memoir&#x27; page 144 he said:

This permanently hindered his playing abilities. During his wartime duty he played some exhibitions for the troops in particular during the summer 1945 with the war winding down, Budge played in a US Army &quot;(Budge-Frank Parker)&quot; – US Navy &quot;(Riggs – Wayne Sabin)&quot; competition under the Davis Cup format: the main confrontations were the Budge-Riggs meetings knowing that both Americans were the best players in the world in 1942 just before being enlisted in the U.S. Armed Forces and again when they came back to the professional circuit in 1945. In the first match, on the island of Guam, Budge trounced Riggs. On the island of Peleliu, Budge won again. Riggs won the next two matches against Budge, at the island of Ulithi and the island of Saipan. Budge confided in Parker his disbelief at losing two matches in a row to Riggs. In the fifth and final match on the island of Tinian, scheduled for the first week of August 1945, Riggs defeated Budge. This was the first time Budge had been beaten by Riggs in a series (Riggs also won three matches out of five against the amateur Parker, both holder and future titlist of the U.S. Amateur Nationals at Forest Hills) thereby giving Riggs an important psychological edge in their forthcoming peacetime tours.

==Post war==

;1946
In 1946, Budge lost narrowly to Riggs in their U.S. tour, 24 matches to 22. Riggs thereby established himself as the world No. 1. According to Kramer,

The hierarchy was confirmed at the U.S. Pro, held at Forest Hills where Riggs easily defeated Budge in the last round. There was a tournament circuit in 1946. Budge won events at Memphis in June (beating Riggs in the final), Richmond in June (beating Riggs in the final), Philadelphia in July (beating Van Horn in the final) and San Francisco in October (beating Riggs in the final). Budge finished second in the points table behind Riggs.

;1947
In 1947 Budge beat Riggs in two European tours, one early in the year and one in the summer. According to Riggs, Budge still had a very powerful, very deadly overhead and rather than winning outright very many points with his lobbing, he actually achieved two other goals: his constant lobbing led Budge to play somewhat deeper at the net than he would have otherwise, thereby making it easier for Riggs to hit passing shots for winners; and the constant lobbing helped to wear Budge down by forcing him to run back to the backline time after time. Riggs stayed the pro king by defeating Budge in the U.S. Pro final in five sets, so Riggs would face Kramer on the big tour in 1948.

;1948-1961
Budge reached two more U.S. Pro finals, losing in 1949 at Forest Hills to Riggs and in 1953 in Cleveland to Pancho Gonzales. In 1954, Budge recorded his last significant victory in a North American tour with Pancho Gonzales, Pancho Segura, and Frank Sedgman when, in Los Angeles, he defeated Gonzales, by then the best player in the world. In April 1955 Budge won the U. S. Pro Clay Court Championships at Fort Lauderdale beating Riggs in the final. Budge was playing very infrequently by now. He continued playing until 1961, when he lost in the Southern Pro final to Jack Arkinstall in straight sets. &quot;He still hits a wonderful backhand, but he&#x27;s five years older than I am and I guess I just got around too fast for him,&quot; said Arkinstall.

==Later years and honors==
He appeared on the &quot;Ed Sullivan Show&quot; in 1948 and the &quot;Steve Allen Plymouth Show&quot; in 1951. He appeared as himself in the 1953 film &quot;Pat and Mike&quot;.

After retiring from competition, Budge turned to coaching and conducted tennis clinics for children. According to Riggs&#x27; 1949 autobiography as of that writing, Budge owned a laundry in New York with Sidney Wood as well as a bar in Oakland. A gentleman on and off the court, he was much in demand for speaking engagements and endorsed various lines of sporting goods. With the advent of the Open era in tennis, in 1968 he returned to play at Wimbledon in the Veteran&#x27;s doubles. In 1973, at the age of 58, he and former champion Frank Sedgman teamed up to win the Veteran&#x27;s Doubles Championship at Wimbledon before an appreciative crowd.

Budge was the resident tennis pro at the Montego Bay Racquet Club in Jamaica in 1977. In October 1978 he became the tennis pro at the Cambridge Towers Hotel in Las Vegas. After a few months he was terminated but he sued the owner for breach of his five-year contract and was awarded $455,041.

Budge was inducted into the National Lawn Tennis Hall of Fame, now the International Tennis Hall of Fame, at Newport, Rhode Island, in 1964. He was elected to the Bay Area Sports Hall of Fame in 1992. The once-gravel tennis courts at Bushrod Park in north Oakland, which he played on as a youth, are named for him.

He is referenced in the 1977 Broadway musical &quot;Annie&quot; in the song &quot;I Think I&#x27;m Gonna Like It Here.&quot; When Annie says she&#x27;s never picked up a tennis racket, Daddy Warbucks&#x27; secretary tells an underling: &quot;Have an instructor here at noon. Oh, and get that Don Budge fellow if he&#x27;s available.&quot; The reference is technically an anachronism, as the story is set in 1933, at which time Budge was an undergraduate at Berkeley and had not yet achieved prominence.

== Personal life ==
He wed Deirdre Conselman (1922–1978), the daughter of screenwriter and cartoonist William Conselman, at St. Chrysostom&#x27;s Episcopal Church in Chicago on June 2, 1941. In his later years he lived in Dingman&#x27;s Ferry, Pennsylvania, with his second wife, Loriel.

In December 1999, Budge was injured in an automobile accident from which he never fully recovered. He died on January 26, 2000, at a nursing home in Scranton, Pennsylvania, aged 84. He had two sons, David and Jeffrey.

==Assessment==
Budge is a consensus pick for being one of the greatest players of all time. He had a graceful, overpowering backhand that he hit with a slight amount of topspin and that, combined with his quickness and his serve, made him the best player of his time. E. Digby Baltzell wrote in 1994 that Budge and Laver &quot;have usually been rated at the top of any all-time World Champions list, Budge having a slight edge.&quot; Will Grimsley wrote in 1971 that Budge &quot;is considered by many to be foremost among the all-time greats.&quot; Paul Metzler, in his analysis of ten of the all-time greats, singles out Budge as the greatest player before World War II, and gives him second place overall behind Jack Kramer. In 1978, Ellsworth Vines ranked his all-time top 10 in &quot;Tennis Myth and Method&quot; and rated Budge number one.

Jack Kramer himself has written that Budge was, in the long run, the greatest player who ever lived although Ellsworth Vines topped him when at the height of his game. Kramer said:

In his 1979 autobiography, Kramer considered the best player ever to have been either Don Budge (for consistent play) or Ellsworth Vines (at the height of his game). The next four best were, chronologically, Bill Tilden, Fred Perry, Bobby Riggs, and Pancho Gonzales. All of these sources were written, after Rod Laver completed his second, and Open, Grand Slam in 1969.

In 1983, Fred Perry ranked the greatest male players of all time and put them in to two categories, before World War 2 and after. Perry&#x27;s pre-WWII nominees all below Tilden and excluding himself “Budge Cochet Ellsworth Vines ’so powerful!’ Gottfried von Cramm Jack Crawford Jan Sato Jean Borotra Bunny Austin Roderick Menzel Baron Umberto de Morpurgo”.

In early 1986 Inside Tennis, a magazine edited in Northern California, devoted parts of four issues to a lengthy article called &quot;Tournament of the Century&quot;, an imaginary tournament to determine the greatest of all time. 25 players in all were named by the 37 experts in their lists of the ten best. The magazine then ranked them in descending order by total number of points assigned. The top eight players in overall points, with their number of first-place votes, were: Rod Laver (9), John McEnroe (3), Don Budge (4), Jack Kramer (5), Björn Borg (6), Pancho Gonzales (1), Bill Tilden (6), and Lew Hoad (1). McEnroe was still an active player and Laver and Borg had only recently retired. In the imaginary tournament, Laver beat McEnroe in the finals in five sets.

In 1988, a panel consisting of Bud Collins, Cliff Drysdale, and Butch Buchholz ranked their top five male tennis players of all time. Drysdale listed Budge number three behind Laver and Borg. Buchholz and Collins did not include Budge on their lists.

More recently, an Associated Press poll conducted in 1999 ranked Budge fifth, following Laver, Pete Sampras, Tilden, and Borg. Even more recently, in 2006, a panel of former players and experts was asked by TennisWeek to assemble a draw for a fantasy tournament to determine who was the greatest of all time. The top eight seeds were Roger Federer, Laver, Sampras, Borg, Tilden, Budge, Kramer, and McEnroe.

In the early years of the 21st century, Sidney Wood compiled his list of the Greatest Players of All Time (later published posthumously in a memoir &quot;The Wimbledon final that never was and other tennis tales from a bygone era&quot;). Wood first entered Wimbledon in 1927 and won the title in 1931. &quot;From that time on, through to the late 1970s (doubles only towards the end), I was privileged to compete against virtually every top player in the world&quot; said Wood. Wood ranked Budge number one in his list, saying the decision was a &quot;no-brainer&quot; and said Budge was &quot;recognized by his peers as the one player to have commanded not only every shot in the book for every surface, but also to have been blessed with the single most destructive tennis weapon ever- a bludgeon backhand struck with a sixteen ounce &#x27;Paul Bunyan&#x27; bat.&quot;

<text>Sydney Hughes Greenstreet (December 27, 1879 – January 18, 1954) was a British and American actor. While he did not begin his career in films until the age of 61, he had a run of significant motion pictures in a Hollywood career lasting through the 1940s. He is best remembered for the three Warner Bros. films - &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (1941), &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), and &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944) - with both Humphrey Bogart (5 films total with Greenstreet) and Peter Lorre (9 films with Greenstreet, 3 of which were also with Bogart). He portrayed Nero Wolfe on radio during 1950 and 1951. He became an American citizen in 1925.

==Early life==
Sydney Hughes Greenstreet was born on December 27, 1879, in Eastry, Kent, the son of Ann (née Baker) and John Jarvis Greenstreet, a tanner. He had seven siblings. He left home at the age of 18 to make his fortune as a Ceylon tea planter, but drought forced him out of business. He began managing a brewery and, to escape boredom, took acting lessons.

==Career==
Greenstreet&#x27;s stage debut was as a murderer in a 1902 production of a Sherlock Holmes story at the Marina Theatre, Ramsgate, Kent. He toured Britain with Ben Greet&#x27;s Shakespearean company, and in 1905 made his New York City debut in &quot;Everyman&quot;. He appeared in such plays as a revival of &quot;As You Like It&quot; (1914). He appeared in numerous plays in Britain and America, working through most of the 1930s with Alfred Lunt and Lynn Fontanne at the Theatre Guild. His stage roles ranged from musical comedy to Shakespeare, and years of such versatile acting on two continents led to many offers to appear in films. He refused until he was 61.

In 1941, Greenstreet began working for Warner Bros. His debut film role was as Kasper Gutman (&quot;The Fat Man&quot;) co-starring with Humphrey Bogart in &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot;. In &quot;Casablanca&quot; (1942), Greenstreet played crooked club owner Signor Ferrari (for which he received a salary of $3,750 per week—equivalent to $60,179.91 in 2020 dollars—for seven weeks&#x27; work). He also appeared in &quot;Background to Danger&quot; (1943), with George Raft; &quot;Passage to Marseille&quot; (1944), reuniting with &quot;Casablanca&quot; stars Bogart, Peter Lorre and Claude Rains; &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot; (1944); &quot;The Conspirators&quot; (1944) with Hedy Lamarr and Paul Henreid; &quot;Hollywood Canteen&quot; (1944); &quot;Conflict&quot; (1945), again with Bogart; &quot;Three Strangers&quot; (1946); and &quot;The Verdict&quot; (1946). In the last two, and &quot;The Mask of Dimitrios&quot;, he received top billing. He had dramatic roles, such as William Makepeace Thackeray in &quot;Devotion&quot; (1946), and witty performances in screwball comedies, such as Alexander Yardley in &quot;Christmas in Connecticut&quot; (1944). Near the end of his film career, he played opposite Joan Crawford in &quot;Flamingo Road&quot; (1949).

After little more than eight years, Greenstreet&#x27;s film career ended with &quot;Malaya&quot; (also 1949), in which he was billed fourth, after Spencer Tracy, James Stewart and Valentina Cortese. In those years, he worked with stars ranging from Clark Gable to Ava Gardner to Joan Crawford. Author Tennessee Williams wrote his one-act play &quot;The Last of My Solid Gold Watches&quot; with Greenstreet in mind, and dedicated it to him. During 1950–1951, Greenstreet played Nero Wolfe on the radio program &quot;The New Adventures of Nero Wolfe&quot;, based loosely on the rotund detective genius created by Rex Stout.

==Death and legacy==
Greenstreet suffered from diabetes and Bright&#x27;s disease, a kidney disorder. Five years after retiring from film acting, he died on January 18, 1954, in Hollywood. His death was caused by complications from both conditions. He is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Glendale, California, in the Utility Columbarium area of the Great Mausoleum, inaccessible to the public. He was survived by his only child, John Ogden Greenstreet (1920–2004), from his marriage to Dorothy Marie Ogden. Actor Mark Greenstreet is his great-nephew. His other relatives who are still living include Gregory Greenstreet and his children, Tamar Greenstreet and Elan Greenstreet. 
Living relatives from his sisters (Laura Maude Greenstreet) marriage to Albert Elijah White still reside in the UK today.

<doc id="244831" wikidata="Q242729" url="?curid=244831" title="Joan Blondell">
<text>Rose Joan Blondell (August 30, 1906 – December 25, 1979) was an American actress who performed in film and television for 50 years.

Blondell began her career in vaudeville. After winning a beauty pageant, she embarked on a film career, establishing herself as a Pre-Code staple of Warner Bros. Pictures in wisecracking, sexy roles, appearing in more than 100 films and television productions. She was most active in film during the 1930s and early 1940s, and during that time co-starred with Glenda Farrell, a colleague and close friend, in nine films. Blondell continued acting on film and television for the rest of her life, often in small, supporting roles. She was nominated for an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951). In 1958, she was nominated the Tony Award for Best Featured Actress in a Play for her performance as Mrs. Farrow in &quot;The Rope Dancers&quot;.

Near the end of her life, Blondell was nominated for a Golden Globe for Best Supporting Actress for her performance in &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977). She was featured in two more films, the blockbuster musical &quot;Grease&quot; (1978) and Franco Zeffirelli&#x27;s &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979), which was released shortly before her death from leukemia.

==Early life==
Rose Joan Blondell was born in New York City to a vaudeville family; her birthdate was August 30, 1906 but was misrepresented as 1909 by Blondell earlier in her career and sometimes later conflated with the true year, including in her obituaries. Her father, Levi Bluestein, a vaudeville comedian known as Ed Blondell, was born in Poland to a Jewish family in 1866. He toured for many years starring in Blondell and Fennessy&#x27;s stage version of &quot;The Katzenjammer Kids&quot;. Blondell&#x27;s mother was Catherine (known as &quot;Kathryn&quot; or &quot;Katie&quot;) Caine, born in Brooklyn, Kings County, New York (later Brooklyn, New York City), on April 13, 1884, to Irish-American parents. Joan&#x27;s younger sister, Gloria Blondell, also an actress, was married to film producer Albert R. Broccoli. Joan also had a brother, Ed Blondell, Jr.

Joan&#x27;s cradle was a property trunk as her parents moved from place to place. She made her first appearance on stage at the age of four months when she was carried on in a cradle as the daughter of Peggy Astaire in &quot;The Greatest Love&quot;. Her family comprised a vaudeville troupe, the Bouncing Blondells.

Joan had spent a year in Honolulu (1914–1915), where she attended Punahou School, and six months in Australia and had seen much of the world by the time her family stopped touring and settled in Dallas, Texas, when she was a teenager. Using the stage name &quot;Rosebud&quot; (acquired several year before, while a student at Chicago&#x27;s Elmwood School, following her onstage portrayal of a rose during a show entitled &#x27;In a Garden of Girls&#x27;), Blondell won the 1926 Miss Dallas pageant, was a finalist in an early version of the Miss Universe pageant in May 1926, and placed fourth for Miss America 1926 in Atlantic City, New Jersey in September of that year. She attended Santa Monica High School, where she acted in school plays and edited the school yearbook. While there, she gave her name as Rosebud Blondell, and when she attended North Texas State Teacher&#x27;s College (now the University of North Texas) in Denton, Texas in 1926–1927, where her mother was a local stage actress.

==Career==

Around 1927, she returned to New York, worked as a fashion model, a circus hand, a clerk in a store, joined a stock company to become an actress, and performed on Broadway. In 1930, she starred with James Cagney in &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; on Broadway. &quot;Penny Arcade&quot; lasted only three weeks, but Al Jolson saw it and bought the rights to the play for $20,000. He then sold the rights to Warner Bros., with the proviso that Blondell and Cagney be cast in the film version, named &quot;Sinners&#x27; Holiday&quot; (1930). Placed under contract by Warner Bros., she moved to Hollywood, where studio boss Jack L. Warner wanted her to change her name to &quot;Inez Holmes&quot;, but Blondell refused. She began to appear in short subjects and was named as one of the WAMPAS Baby Stars in 1931.

Blondell was paired several more times with James Cagney in films, including &quot;The Public Enemy&quot; (1931) and &quot;Footlight Parade&quot; (1933), and was one-half of a gold-digging duo with Glenda Farrell in nine films. During the Great Depression, Blondell was one of the highest-paid individuals in the United States. Her stirring rendition of &quot;Remember My Forgotten Man&quot; in the Busby Berkeley production of &quot;Gold Diggers of 1933&quot;, in which she co-starred with Dick Powell and Ruby Keeler, became an anthem for the frustrations of unemployed people and the government&#x27;s failed economic policies. In 1937, she starred opposite Errol Flynn in &quot;The Perfect Specimen&quot;. By the end of the decade, she had made nearly 50 films. She left Warner Bros. in 1939.
In 1943, Blondell returned to Broadway as the star of Mike Todd&#x27;s short-lived production of &quot;The Naked Genius&quot;, a comedy written by Gypsy Rose Lee. She was well received in her later films, despite being relegated to character and supporting roles after 1945, when she was billed below the title for the first time in 14 years in &quot;Adventure&quot;, which starred Clark Gable and Greer Garson. She was also featured prominently in &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; (1945) and &quot;Nightmare Alley&quot; (1947). In 1948, she left the screen for three years and concentrated on theater, performing in summer stock and touring with Cole Porter&#x27;s musical &quot;Something for the Boys&quot;. She later reprised her role of Aunt Sissy in the musical version of &quot;A Tree Grows in Brooklyn&quot; for the national tour and played the nagging mother Mae Peterson in the national tour of &quot;Bye Bye Birdie&quot;.

Blondell returned to Hollywood in 1950. Her performance in her next film, &quot;The Blue Veil&quot; (1951), earned her an Academy Award nomination for Best Actress in a Supporting Role. She played supporting roles in &quot;The Opposite Sex&quot; (1956), &quot;Desk Set&quot; (1957), and &quot;Will Success Spoil Rock Hunter?&quot; (1957). She received considerable acclaim for her performance as Lady Fingers in Norman Jewison&#x27;s &quot;The Cincinnati Kid&quot; (1965), garnering a Golden Globe nomination and National Board of Review win for Best Supporting Actress. John Cassavetes cast her as a cynical, aging playwright in his film &quot;Opening Night&quot; (1977). Blondell was widely seen in two films released not long before her death – &quot;Grease&quot; (1978), and the remake of &quot;The Champ&quot; (1979) with Jon Voight and Rick Schroder. She also appeared in two films released after her death – &quot;The Glove&quot; (1979), and &quot;The Woman Inside&quot; (1981).
Blondell also guest-starred in various television programs, including three 1963 episodes as the character Aunt Win in the sitcom &quot;The Real McCoys&quot;.

Also in 1963, Blondell was cast as the widowed Lucy Tutaine in the episode &quot;The Train and Lucy Tutaine&quot; on the series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, hosted by Stanley Andrews.

In March 1964, she appeared with William Demarest in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;What&#x27;s in the Box&quot;. The following month Blondell, Joe E. Brown and Buster Keaton guest-starred in &quot;You&#x27;re All Right, Ivy&quot;, the final episode of the short-lived circus drama &quot;The Greatest Show on Earth&quot;, as well as the directorial debut of its star Jack Palance. In 1965, she was in the running to replace Vivian Vance as Lucille Ball&#x27;s sidekick on the hit CBS television comedy series &quot;The Lucy Show&quot;. Unfortunately, after filming her second guest appearance as Joan Brenner (Lucy&#x27;s new friend from California), Blondell walked off the set right after the episode had completed filming when Ball humiliated her by harshly criticizing her performance in front of the studio audience and technicians.

Blondell continued working on television. In 1968, she guest-starred on the CBS sitcom &quot;Family Affair&quot;, starring Brian Keith. She replaced Bea Benaderet, who was ill, for one episode on the CBS series &quot;Petticoat Junction&quot;. In that installment, Blondell played FloraBelle Campbell, a lady visitor to Hooterville, who had once dated Uncle Joe (Edgar Buchanan) and Sam Drucker (Frank Cady). The same year, Blondell co-starred in all 52 episodes of the ABC series &quot;Here Come the Brides&quot; Blondell received two consecutive Emmy nominations for outstanding continued performance by an actress in a dramatic series for her role as Lottie Hatfield.

In 1971, she followed Sada Thompson in the off-Broadway hit &quot;The Effect of Gamma Rays on Man-in-the-Moon Marigolds&quot;, with a young Swoosie Kurtz playing one of her daughters.

In 1972, she had an ongoing supporting role in the series &quot;Banyon&quot; as Peggy Revere, who operated a secretarial school in the same building as Banyon&#x27;s detective agency. This was a 1930s period action drama starring Robert Forster in the title role. Her students worked in Banyon&#x27;s office, providing fresh faces for the show weekly. The series was replaced midseason.

Blondell has a motion pictures star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame for her contributions to the film industry. Her star is located at 6311 Hollywood Boulevard. In December 2007, the Museum of Modern Art in New York City mounted a retrospective of Blondell&#x27;s films in connection with a new biography by film professor Matthew Kennedy. More recently her films have been screened by revival houses such as Film Forum in Manhattan, the UCLA Film and Television Archive in Los Angeles, the Hippodrome Cinema in Bo&#x27;ness, Scotland, and at the 2019 Lumière Film Festival in Grand Lyon, France.

She wrote a novel titled &quot;Center Door Fancy&quot; (New York: Delacorte Press, 1972), which was a thinly disguised autobiography with veiled references to June Allyson and Dick Powell.

==Personal life==
Blondell was married three times, first to cinematographer George Barnes in a private wedding ceremony on January 4, 1933 at the First Presbyterian Church in Phoenix, Arizona. They had one child, Norman Scott Barnes. Blondell and Barnes divorced in 1936.

On September 19, 1936, she married actor Dick Powell. They had a daughter, Ellen, who later became a studio hair stylist. Powell legally adopted Blondell’s son Norman, who later became a producer, director, and television executive. Blondell and Powell divorced on July 14, 1944.

On July 5, 1947, Blondell married producer Mike Todd. Her marriage to Todd was an emotional and financial disaster that ended in divorce in 1950. She once accused him of holding her outside a hotel window by her ankles. He was also a heavy spender who lost hundreds of thousands of dollars gambling (high-stakes bridge was one of his weaknesses) and went through a controversial bankruptcy during their marriage. An often-repeated myth is that Mike Todd left Blondell for Elizabeth Taylor, when in fact, she had left Todd of her own accord years before he met Taylor.

===Death===
Blondell died of leukemia in Santa Monica, California on Christmas Day 1979, with her children and her sister at her bedside. She was cremated and her ashes interred in a columbarium at the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale, California. She was 73 years old.

<doc id="244832" wikidata="Q380598" url="?curid=244832" title="Sun Ce">
<text>Sun Ce () () (175 – 5 May 200), courtesy name Bofu, was a Chinese military general, politician, and warlord who lived during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He was the eldest child of Sun Jian, who was killed during the Battle of Xiangyang when Sun Ce was only 16. Sun Ce then broke away from his father&#x27;s overlord, Yuan Shu, and headed to the Jiangdong region in southern China to establish his own power base there. With the help of several people, such as Zhang Zhao and Zhou Yu, Sun Ce managed to lay down the foundation of the state of Eastern Wu during the Three Kingdoms period.

In 200, when the warlord Cao Cao was at war with his rival Yuan Shao in the Battle of Guandu, Sun Ce was rumoured to be planning an attack on Xuchang, Cao Cao&#x27;s base. However, he was assassinated before he could carry out the plan. Sun Ce was posthumously honoured as &quot;Prince Huan of Changsha&quot; (長沙桓王) by his younger brother Sun Quan when the latter became the founding emperor of Eastern Wu.

Chen Shou&#x27;s &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;) describes Sun Ce as a handsome man who was full of laughter. He was also a generous and receptive man who employed people according to their abilities. As such, his subjects were willing to risk their lives for him. One detractor named Xu Gong, in a letter to Emperor Xian, compared Sun Ce to Xiang Yu, the warrior-king who overthrew the Qin dynasty. As a result, Sun Ce was also referred to as the &quot;Little Conqueror&quot; in popular culture. Sun Ce is depicted in the Wu Shuang Pu (無雙譜, Table of Peerless Heroes) by Jin Guliang.

==Early life and career==
Born in 175, Sun Ce was the eldest son of Sun Jian, a military general serving under the Eastern Han dynasty. In 190, a year after Emperor Ling died, the warlord Dong Zhuo usurped power, placing in the throne the puppet Emperor Xian. Regional warlords in eastern China then launched a campaign against Dong Zhuo. Sun Jian rendered his service to Yuan Shu, one of the leaders of the coalition. The attempt to oust Dong Zhuo soon failed and China slid into a series of massive civil wars. In the next year, Sun Jian was sent by Yuan Shu to attack Liu Biao, governor of Jing Province, but he was killed in an ambush.

Sun Ce brought his father&#x27;s body to Qu&#x27;e (曲阿; present-day Danyang, Jiangsu) for burial and settled his mother down before heading for Danyang, where his maternal uncle Wu Jing was the governor. There he raised a small militia a few hundred in strength. This small force was far from sufficient for him to establish his own power so in 194 Sun Ce went to Yuan Shu. Yuan Shu was very impressed with Sun Ce and often lamented that he had no son like him. He also returned Sun Jian&#x27;s former division of troops to Sun Ce.

Initially, Yuan Shu promised to appoint Sun Ce the governor of Jiujiang but eventually gave the governorship to Chen Ji (陳紀). Later, when Yuan Shu was denied a large loan of grains from the governor of Lujiang, he sent Sun Ce to attack the latter, promising to make Sun Ce the governor of Lujiang should he succeed. When Sun Ce did, however, Yuan Shu again went back on his words and appointed someone else instead. The disappointed Sun Ce then began to contemplate leaving.

Meanwhile, Liu Yao, who was by imperial decree the governor of Yang Province, occupied Qu&#x27;e as the regional seat Shouchun was already occupied by Yuan Shu. He then forced Wu Jing back west across the Yangtze River to Liyang (歷陽; present-day He County, Anhui). However, Yuan Shu claimed to be the rightful governor and sent Wu Jing and Sun Ce&#x27;s cousin Sun Ben to attack Liu Yao. After they were unable to break down Liu Yao&#x27;s defences for more than a year, Sun Ce requested to lead forces to assist the effort.

==Conquest of Wu territory==


Though Yuan Shu knew Sun Ce intended to leave, he believed the latter would not be able to defeat Liu Yao. Thus he deployed the young general off with merely a thousand odd troops and a tiny cavalry force. Along with a few hundred more willing followers, Sun Ce proceeded to Liyang, where he boosted his strength to more than 5,000. He then launched an offensive across the Yangtze River and successfully occupied the strategic position of Niuzhu (牛渚; southwest of present-day Ma&#x27;anshan, Anhui) in 195.

Two of Liu Yao&#x27;s allies then came south from Pengcheng and Xiapi respectively to aid him. Sun Ce chose to first attack one of them, Ze Rong, who made camp south of Moling. After suffering initial defeat in the hands of the aggressor, Ze Rong fell back in defence and refused to engage in battle. Sun Ce then marched further north and attacked Xue Li (薛禮) in Moling. Although Xue Li soon gave up the city and escaped, Liu Yao&#x27;s subordinate Fan Neng (樊能) and others had regrouped their forces and launched a renewed attack on Niuzhu. Turning back, Sun Ce defeated Fan Neng and secured Niuzhu. He then began a second offensive against Ze Rong. However, he was struck by a stray arrow in the thigh. Returning to Niuzhu, he sent out false words that he was killed in battle. The exulted Ze Rong then sent a force to attack. Sun Ce led the enemies into an ambush and annihilated them. When Ze Rong heard that Sun Ce was still alive, he further reinforced his defences.

Sun Ce then temporarily gave up attacking Ze Rong and focused his forces on Qu&#x27;e. After all the surrounding areas were taken over by Sun Ce, Liu Yao gave up the city and escaped south to Nanchang, capital of Yuzhang Commandery, where he died later. Hua Xin, administrator of Yuzhang, joined Sun&#x27;s forces. As Sun Ce implemented strict discipline among his troops, he won the instant support of the local people and gathered many talented men, such as Chen Wu, Zhou Tai, Jiang Qin, Zhang Zhao, Zhang Hong, Qin Song, and Lü Fan. He then pushed his force deeper into Yang Province and conquered Kuaiji along the southern shore of Hangzhou Bay, whose governor Wang Lang surrendered. Sun Ce made Kuaiji his base city and struck out at the wandering bandit army led by Yan Baihu. Yan Baihu sent his younger brother Yan Yu (嚴輿) to offer Sun Ce a position alongside Yan Baihu, but Sun Ce showed no mercy and personally slew the emissary. As Yan Yu was known among Yan Baihu&#x27;s men as a fierce warrior, his death struck fear into their hearts and they were soon defeated. Sun Ce then appointed his relatives and a trusted subject to govern Danyang and Yuzhang, from which he divided a new commandery named Luling (廬陵). His campaign, from the occupation of Niuzhu to the conquest of the entire region southeast of the Long River, took less than a year. He then defeated and received the services of Zu Lang (祖郎), the Chief of Danyang, and Taishi Ci, the leader of the remnants of Liu Yao&#x27;s forces; he then urged the surrender of Hua Xin, another one of the remnants of Liu Yao&#x27;s forces. Thus, with the exception of the scattered but still numerous army of Yan Baihu, the lands south of the Yangtze were mostly pacified.

The barbarians of Shanyue tribe, however, were not easily dealt with. To counter the frequent rebellions of the Shanyue (who would continue to rebel for many years), Sun Ce appointed He Qi to a military rank with orders to subdue the Shanyue. He Qi became a highly successful general later; truly, his appointment by Sun Ce was the first important step to Wu&#x27;s eventual subjugation of the Shanyue.

==Later life==
In 197, Yuan Shu declared himself emperor – an act deemed treasonous against the Han dynasty. In a letter to Yuan Shu, Sun Ce denounced the move and broke ties with the former. In an effort to garner support from Sun Ce, the rising warlord Cao Cao then recommended him to be appointed General Who Attacks Rebels (討逆將軍) and enfeoffed as the Marquis of Wu (吳侯). In 199 Yuan Shu died of sickness along with his short-lived Zhong dynasty. His cousin Yuan Yin (袁胤) feared Cao Cao and gave up Shouchun. Bringing along Yuan Shu&#x27;s coffin and his former troops, he headed to Wan County (皖縣; present-day Qianshan County, Anhui) to seek refuge under Liu Xun (劉勳). As Liu Xun had insufficient food supplies in his realm to support the additional troops, he led a force south to pillage Haihun (海昏; east of present-day Yongxiu County, Jiangxi).

Sun Ce was en route to attack Huang Zu in Xiakou when he received the news. He then turned back and captured the poorly-defended Wan County, taking over all of Yuan Shu&#x27;s 30,000 former troops. Hearing that his base city had been taken, Liu Xun headed west and sought help from Huang Zu, who sent a 5,000-strong naval force to assist him. Sun Ce pressed forward and defeated Liu Xun, who escaped north to Cao Cao. Sun Ce annexed more than 2,000 former troops and 1,000 ships of his enemy and came upon Huang Zu. Despite reinforcements from Liu Biao, Huang Zu was utterly defeated. During the battle, Sun Ce slew Liu Biao&#x27;s officer, Han Xi (韓希), and completely routed Huang Zu&#x27;s son, Huang She (黃射).

The victorious Sun Ce in 199 looked poised to take over the entire southern China. As he was threatened by rival Yuan Shao in the north and could not divide his attention, Cao Cao attempted to further reinforce the alliance with Sun Ce by marrying the daughter of his relative Cao Ren to Sun Ce&#x27;s youngest brother Sun Kuang. Sun Ce in turn agreed to marry Sun Ben&#x27;s daughter to Cao Cao&#x27;s son Cao Zhang.

The former administrator of Wu Commandery, Xu Gong, had long opposed Sun Ce. Xu Gong wrote to Emperor Xian, recommending the emperor to summon Sun Ce to the capital as he deemed Sun Ce to be a hero comparable to Xiang Yu and too dangerous to be allowed to occupy a territory. However, the letter was intercepted by an official loyal to Sun Ce, who attacked and then had Xu Gong executed. Xu Gong&#x27;s former servants then kept a low profile and waited for chance to revenge.

In the year 200, Cao Cao engaged in the decisive Battle of Guandu with Yuan Shao along the shores of the Yellow River, leaving the capital and his base city Xuchang poorly guarded. Sun Ce is said to have then plotted to attack Xuchang under the banner of rescuing Emperor Xian, who was a figurehead under Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Preparations were underway for the military excursion when Sun Ce ran into three former servants of Xu Gong during a solo hunting trip. One of them managed to plant an arrow into Sun Ce&#x27;s cheek before Sun Ce&#x27;s men arrived and slew the assassins. Many differing accounts of Sun Ce&#x27;s death exist (see below). One generally accepted scenario is that he died that same night.

Another possible scenario has Sun Ce living for quite some time. The physician told Sun Ce to rest still for a hundred days to allow the wound to heal, but Sun Ce looked into the mirror one day and, seeing his scar, became so enraged that he slammed his table. The large movement caused the wound to break and he died in the same night. Although he was survived by one son, Sun Ce passed his legacy to his younger brother, Sun Quan. When Sun Quan declared himself emperor of the state of Eastern Wu in 222, he honoured Sun Ce with the posthumous title &quot;Prince Huan of Changsha&quot; (長沙桓王).

Sun Ce was succeeded by a posthumous son, Sun Shao (孫紹), as well as at least two (possibly three) daughters, married to Gu Shao and later Zhu Ji (朱紀), and Lu Xun respectively. Sun Shao bore one son, Sun Feng (孫奉), who was executed by Sun Hao for alleged treason due to his popularity.

==Dispute over cause of death==
Sun Sheng (孫盛) in his &quot;Exposition on Disparities and Similarities&quot; (異同評) discounted the theory that Sun Ce made plans to attack Xuchang. He believed that although Sun Ce was a rising power, he was threatened in the west by Huang Zu, who was defeated but not eliminated, in the north by Chen Deng, governor of Guangling Commandery, and in the south by indigenous tribes yet to be assimilated. These prevented Sun Ce from striking far out at Xuchang and moving the emperor to southeastern China. He further argued that Sun Ce died on the fifth day in the fourth month of 200, before the Battle of Guandu even took place.

Pei Songzhi, who annotated the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, rebutted Sun Sheng, arguing that Huang Zu was newly broken and had yet to recollect his forces while the indigenous tribes were scattered and not much of a threat. Pei Songzhi believed that the first objective of Sun Ce&#x27;s planned northward excursion was to attack Chen Deng, which would provide a platform for capturing Xuchang. On the other hand, Cao Cao and Yuan Shao had been engaging in skirmishes and small-scale battles before Sun Ce&#x27;s death. Thus there was in fact no discrepancy in timing.

A historically implausible legend regarding Sun Ce&#x27;s death involves a highly respected Taoist priest of his time, Gan Ji (干吉), whom he condemned as a sorcerer due to his popularity. Despite petitions from his subjects and his own mother, Sun Ce ordered Gan Ji&#x27;s execution. According to &quot;In Search of the Supernatural&quot; (搜神記) by Gan Bao (干竇), a compilation largely based on legends and hearsay, Sun Ce began to see apparitions of Gan Ji ever since the execution of the latter. After he was injured by assassins, Sun Ce was told by the physician to rest still to allow the wound to heal. However, he looked into the mirror one day and saw Gan Ji&#x27;s face, whereupon he let out a cry and slammed the mirror. His wound broke and he died shortly. This version was adopted and further dramatised in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in which Gan Ji&#x27;s name was taken to be &quot;Yu Ji&quot; (于吉).

==Family==
==In popular culture==
===Chinese opera===
In Peking opera, Sun Ce&#x27;s role is usually that of a hero or tragic hero, while his brother, Sun Quan is usually portrayed as a villain at worst or self-seeking at best. Several operas even toy with the idea that Sun Quan had Sun Ce assassinated so that he could take control of the warlord state, though there is no historical evidence to support this view. In the opera &quot;Fenghuang Er Qiao&quot;, Sun Ce borrows 3,000 troops from Yuan Shu and allies with the Qiao army, which is led by the Two Qiaos. Sun Ce, the protagonist of the opera, eventually gains Da Qiao&#x27;s hand in marriage through a martial arts contest with the help of Zhou Yu and Xiao Qiao.

===Film and television===
In the 1983 Shaw Brothers Studio film &quot;The Weird Man&quot;, Sun Ce has Yu Ji executed and the sorcerer becomes a vengeful ghost. In this film Sun Ce is portrayed as the anti-hero and Yu Ji as the hero due to the controversy between them in the novel. The 1993 Hong Kong film &quot;Ninja in Ancient China&quot; is also adapted from this story except Yu Ji&#x27;s apprentices try to avenge him.

Sha Yi portrayed Sun Ce in the 2010 Chinese television series &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot;.

===Comics and anime===
In the anime &quot;Yokoyama Mitsuteru Sangokushi&quot;, Sun Ce fights alongside his father against Dong Zhuo and is befriended by Liu Bei, Guan Yu, and Zhang Fei, with whom he trains to become a hero.

The protagonist of the manga/anime &quot;Ikki Tousen&quot;, Sonsaku Hakufu, is loosely based on the historical figure Sun Ce (&quot;Sonsaku Hakufu&quot; being the Japanese reading of Sun Ce&#x27;s name and courtesy name). Her guardian, Shuuyu Koukin, bears the same name and personality as Zhou Yu.

In the anime &quot;Kōtetsu Sangokushi&quot;, Sun Ce is portrayed as a once kind-hearted and virtuous hero who was corrupted by the power of the Imperial Seal, causing him to kill its protector.

In the Chinese manhua &quot;The Ravages of Time&quot;, Sun Ce is a cunning, ruthless and manipulative character.

===Video games===
Sun Ce appears in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

Sun Ce is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series, as well as &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot;.

Sun Ce appears as a recruitable ally in Team Ninja&#x27;s &quot;Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty,&quot; also published by Koei.

Sun Ce is also a legendary character in Creative Assembly&#x27;s &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;, the 12th mainline instalment in the &quot;Total War&quot; video games series.

Sun Ce is also a playable character in the fighting game Sango Fighter 2.

===Card games===
In the collectible card game &quot;&quot; there is a card named &quot;Sun Ce, Young Conqueror&quot;, in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set.

<text>Geraint Wyn Davies ( , ; born 20 April 1957) is a British-American stage, film and television actor. Born in Wales and educated in Canada, he became a citizen of the United States on 13 June 2006, having been sworn in by then Associate Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. His most famous role as the vampire-turned police detective Nick Knight in the Canadian television series &quot;Forever Knight&quot;.

==Early life and training==
Geraint Wyn Davies was born on 20 April 1957 in Swansea, Wales, the son of a Congregationalist Christian preacher and a school teacher. At the age of 7 he moved with his family from Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire to Canada, where he attended Upper Canada College. He first acted at age 12, appearing in a school production of &quot;Lord of the Flies&quot;. He went on to study at the University of Western Ontario, where he studied economics before dropping out to pursue an acting career.

==Career==
===Acting===
His professional stage debut was in 1976 in Quebec City, when at age 19 he appeared in &quot;The Fantasticks&quot;, &quot;Red Emma&quot;, and &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;. He relocated from Quebec to London&#x27;s Centre Stage theatre company, and later played the lead in &quot;The Last Englishman&quot; with the British Actors Theatre Company. He spent two seasons with Theatr Clwyd, touring Britain in &quot;Enemy of the People&quot; and &quot;Hamlet&quot; (for which he received the Regional Theatre Best Actor award), and a season with the Chichester Festival, in &quot;Henry VIII&quot;. In Canada, he appeared over several seasons with the Shaw Festival and Stratford Festival of Canada. He gained a reputation for his performances in &quot;The Music Cure&quot;, &quot;Candida&quot;, &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;, &quot;The Vortex&quot;, &quot;Goodnight Disgrace&quot;, &quot;Henry V&quot;, and &quot;The Three Musketeers&quot;. He sang his way through the Rodgers and Hart musical &quot;The Boys from Syracuse&quot;. Other stage performances include &quot;My Fat Friend&quot; in Los Angeles and &quot;Sleuth&quot; (with Patrick Macnee) in Toronto. In 2004, he appeared in Washington, D.C., in the title role of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot;.

In April 1996, Davies appeared as Petruchio in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Taming of The Shrew&quot;, directed by Patrick Tucker of the Original Shakespeare Company. This three-performance run was presented as Shakespeare&#x27;s own players may have done—with sparse rehearsal, eclectic costuming, and rotating roles. In Spring 1998, he appeared in the Moises Kaufmann production &quot;Gross Indecency: The Three Trials of Oscar Wilde&quot; at the Mark Taper Forum in Los Angeles. &quot;Gross Indecency&quot; earned the Garland Award for &quot;Best Ensemble Cast from Backstage West&quot; that year. In August 1999, he starred in Leon Pownall&#x27;s one-man show &quot;An Evening with Dylan Thomas&quot; at the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Nova Scotia, Canada. The following summer he returned to the Atlantic Theatre Festival in Pownall&#x27;s &quot;Dylan Thomas and Shakespeare: In the Envy of Some Greatness&quot;. August 2001 saw the completion of Pownall&#x27;s Dylan Thomas trilogy with &quot;Stranger in Paradise&quot;. In mid-2002, he returned to the Stratford Festival Theatre&#x27;s main stage in &quot;My Fair Lady&quot;, as Henry Higgins, a role he alternated with Colm Feore. He reprised the role of Dylan Thomas at the Festival&#x27;s Studio Theatre, and returned to the Atlantic Theatre Festival in August 2003 to perform &quot;Hughie&quot; (a one-act play by Eugene O&#x27;Neill). The evening was topped off by a presentation of &quot;The Sermon&quot; by David Mamet.

In 2004, Davies performed at the Lincoln in New York City as Edmund to Christopher Plummer&#x27;s &quot;King Lear&quot;. In the summer of 2004, he starred in the title role of &quot;Cyrano&quot; in Barry Kornhauser&#x27;s adaptation of &quot;Cyrano de Bergerac&quot; at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C., for which he won the Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Resident Play. The next year, in 2005, he played Dylan Thomas for seven weeks in &quot;Do Not Go Gentle&quot; at the Arclight Theatre in New York City. While there, he did a reading of Tennessee Williams&#x27;s letters at the New York Public Library, and performed in a reading of Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Days Without End&quot;. In September 2005, he joined in a reading of R. L. Stevenson&#x27;s &quot;Treasure Island&quot; in Washington, D.C., and in October, took part in a staged reading of a new play by Austin Pendleton entitled &quot;H6R3&quot;, which blends Shakespeare&#x27;s plays &quot;Henry VI&quot; and &quot;Richard III&quot;.

In 2006, he returned to The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C., to perform Don Armado in Michael Kahn&#x27;s 1960s version of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;. Following the American run, the play moved to the Royal Shakespeare Company at Stratford-Upon-Avon in the UK for a limited run. He was nominated but did not win The Helen Hayes Award for Outstanding Supporting Actor, Resident Play for Don Armado. While in D.C., he participated in a reading of &quot;London Assurance&quot; by Dion Boucicault.

Early in 2007, Davies headlined as &quot;Richard III&quot; by Shakespeare at The Shakespeare Theatre in Washington, D.C. He, along with friend Brent Carver, opened Toronto&#x27;s CanStage production of &quot;The Elephant Man&quot; in mid-October. In 2008, he returned to Ontario&#x27;s Stratford Festival to appear in &quot;Hamlet&quot; (as Polonius) and &quot;Fuente Ovejuna&quot; (as the King). He followed the Stratford season playing the Duke at the Red Bull Theater (NYC) production of &quot;Women Beware Women&quot;. He returned to Stratford in 2009, playing Duncan in &quot;Macbeth&quot;, Caesar in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; and Bottom in &quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot;.

<text>Zev or Xev is a fictional character from the sci-fi television series &quot;Lexx&quot;. The character of Zev was portrayed by three actresses during the series&#x27; run and the character of Zev has had three incarnations. Zev&#x27;s character was originally played by Lisa Hynes, after which she was portrayed by Eva Habermann and Xenia Seeberg. Habermann portrayed Zev for the first six episodes of the series, after which the character was renamed Xev and portrayed by Seeberg.

==Background==
The character was born on the planet B3K, where she was sold by her parents to the Wife Bank. During her initial years Zev was raised by computers that taught her to become a perfect wife. As a result, the character became overweight and was rejected by her bridegroom. Zev was then sentenced to become a love slave by being run through a device called the Lusticon, intended to transform her into a beautiful and brainless servant. Before the process could be successfully completed, a carnivorous reptile called a cluster lizard attempted to eat her but was fused to her DNA in the process. This enabled Zev to free herself. She then substituted the detached robot head of a 790 robot in the machine to be subjected to brainwashing. This prompted the robot to fall in love with her.

Zev&#x27;s character died early in the second season in the episode &quot;Terminal&quot;, but was re-animated in the next episode by the character Lyekka as a present for Stanley Tweedle. The character was renamed Xev (the pronunciation remaining the same) and was thereafter portrayed by a different actress, Xenia Seeberg. During the series&#x27; run the character has had feelings for Kai, which remained unrequited throughout the series. Seeberg has described the character as being one of the more moral characters of the show, but that her aspect as a potential love slave still factored heavily into the character&#x27;s motivations.

==Cluster lizard==
As Zev and Xev, the character has the ability to transform into a cluster lizard and shares many similarities with the fictional creature. Cluster Lizards are portrayed as being very vicious reptilian creatures resembling centipedes that can curl up into a wheel-like shape and travel at considerable speeds. Otherwise they resemble by appearance a small Sandworm. They reproduce in mating cycles every seven years and are used as a form of capital punishment by His Divine Shadow.

<text>John Montagu, 4th Earl of Sandwich, PC, FRS (13 November 1718 – 30 April 1792) was a British statesman who succeeded his grandfather Edward Montagu, 3rd Earl of Sandwich as the Earl of Sandwich in 1729, at the age of ten. He held various military and political offices during his life, including Postmaster General, First Lord of the Admiralty, and Secretary of State for the Northern Department. He is also known for the claim that he was the inventor of the sandwich.

==Biography==

===Early years===
John Montagu was born in 1718, the son of Edward Montagu, Viscount Hinchingbrooke. His father died when John was four, leaving him as his heir. His mother soon remarried and he had little further contact with her. He succeeded his grandfather as Earl of Sandwich in 1729, at the age of ten. He was educated at Eton and at Trinity College, Cambridge, and spent some time travelling, initially going on the Grand Tour around Continental Europe before visiting the more unusual destinations of Greece, Turkey, and Egypt which were then part of the Ottoman Empire. This led him later to found a number of Orientalist societies.

On his return to England in 1739, Montagu took his seat in the House of Lords as a follower of the Duke of Bedford, one of the wealthiest and most powerful politicians of the era. He became a Patriot Whig and one of the sharpest critics of the Walpole government, attacking the government&#x27;s strategy in the War of the Austrian Succession. Like many Patriot Whigs, Lord Sandwich was opposed to Britain&#x27;s support of Hanover and strongly opposed the deployment of British troops on the European Continent to protect it, instead arguing that Britain should make greater use of its naval power. He gained attention for his speeches in parliament. His oratory earned him a reputation for clearly setting out his argument even if he lacked natural eloquence.

===Political career===
In 1744, the Duke of Bedford was invited to join the government, now headed by Henry Pelham, taking the post of First Lord of the Admiralty. Sandwich joined him as one of the commissioners of the Admiralty, in effect serving as deputy under Bedford. The experienced Admiral Lord Anson also joined the Admiralty board and was an influential figure. Bedford spent much of his time at his country estate, and much of the day-to-day running of the Admiralty fell to Sandwich and Anson. Anson had control of the training and discipline of the navy, while Sandwich focused on the administration. Following a proposal by Admiral Edward Vernon, the concept of a Western Squadron was pioneered, which proved very successful. This marked a radical shift in British naval strategy, and led to British success at the Battles of Cape Finisterre.

The following year, Sandwich took a commission as a colonel in the British Army as part of the response to the Jacobite rising and the prospect of a French invasion. In order to boost the relatively small British army, a number of units were raised by prominent figures, and Sandwich served in the regiment formed by Bedford. While serving in The Midlands, he fell seriously ill with fever and nearly died. After his recovery, he returned to his duties at the admiralty. He remained an army officer for the rest of his life, remaining on the half-pay list and eventually rising to the rank of general, even though he took no further active part in the army.

===Congress of Breda===
In 1746 he was sent as a plenipotentiary to the Congress of Breda, and he continued to take part in the negotiations for peace until the Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle was concluded in 1748. Sandwich was also made ambassador to the Dutch Republic during the talks. Using the resources of the British secret service, Sandwich was able to outmanoeuvre his French counterpart by intercepting the latter&#x27;s secret correspondence. His service at Breda drew him to the attention of the influential Thomas Pelham-Holles, 1st Duke of Newcastle, who lobbied for him to be given high office when he returned home.

It is possible that during his time at Breda, he played a role in the 1747 Dutch Revolution which brought William IV, Prince of Orange wider powers, something supported by Britain as they hoped the Prince would improve the Dutch Republic&#x27;s military performance in the ongoing war in the Low Countries. However, there is no firm evidence of this.

===First Lord of the Admiralty (first and second spells)===
In February 1748 he became First Lord of the Admiralty, retaining this post until June 1751. By 1751 Newcastle, who had previously admired Sandwich for his forthright and hardline views, had increasingly begun to distrust him and his relationship with the Duke of Bedford whom Newcastle regarded as a rival. Newcastle engineered the dismissal of both of them, by sacking Sandwich. Bedford resigned in protest, as Newcastle had calculated, allowing him to replace them with men he considered more loyal personally to him.
For the next few years Sandwich spent time at his country estate, largely avoiding politics, though he kept in close contact with both Bedford and Anson and with Britain&#x27;s participation in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Partly thanks to naval reforms pioneered by Anson and Sandwich, the Royal Navy enjoyed a series of successes and was able to blockade much of the French fleet in port.

In 1763 he returned to the Admiralty in the government of John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, and encouraged a major rebuilding programme for the Royal Navy. Bute was a Tory who wished to bring the war to an end, which he did with the Treaty of Paris. It was during this time that Sandwich first met Martha Ray who became his long-standing mistress. He was soon dismissed from the office, but was offered the influential position of Ambassador to Madrid.

===Northern Secretary===
In August 1763 Sandwich became Secretary of State for the Northern Department, in the government of George Grenville who had replaced Bute. While filling this office he took a leading part in the successful prosecution of the radical MP John Wilkes for obscene libel. Although he had been allegedly associated with Wilkes in the notorious Hellfire Club (also known as the Monks of Medmenham), recent scholarship has suggested that the two had a more distant but cordial relationship than the friendship which was popularly portrayed at the time. John Gay&#x27;s &quot;The Beggar&#x27;s Opera&quot; was played in Covent Garden shortly thereafter, and the similarity of Sandwich&#x27;s conduct to that of Jemmy Twitcher, betrayer of Macheath in that play, permanently attached to him that appellation. Wilkes was eventually expelled from the House of Commons.

He held the post of Northern Secretary until July 1765. His departure from the post coincided with the end of George Grenville&#x27;s term as prime minister. He hoped to return to office swiftly, provided a united opposition could be formed.
Sandwich was postmaster general from 1768 to 1771 and briefly secretary of state again from December 1770 to January 1771.

===First Lord of the Admiralty (third spell)===

Sandwich served again as First Lord of the Admiralty in Lord North&#x27;s administration from 1771 to 1782. He replaced the distinguished Admiral Sir Edward Hawke in the post. His appointment to the post followed the Falklands Crisis which had nearly seen Britain go to war with Spain over the Falkland Islands in the South Atlantic Ocean after the Capture of Port Egmont by Spanish forces. War had only been averted when Louis XVI of France refused to back the Spanish over the dispute. Both France and Spain resented what they considered British hegemony following the Seven Years&#x27; War, and desired to overturn the imbalance of power; war was widely expected to break out between the nations in the near future.

In 1774, only three years into his third term, Sandwich commissioned a series of ship models and a model of Chatham Dockyard as a gift to George III in an attempt to interest his king in naval matters. However, Sandwich&#x27;s overall administration of the navy in the lead up to and during the American War of Independence was traditionally portrayed as being incompetent, with insufficient ships being ready for the outbreak of war with France in 1778. In 1775, Sandwich spoke vociferously in opposition to a plan for British America put forth by Benjamin Franklin and the Earl of Chatham. When Britain and France went to war, Sandwich advocated a strategy of concentrating the British fleet in European waters to deter invasion in opposition to his colleague, Lord Germain, who pushed for more ships to be sent to North America. The cabinet largely followed Sandwich&#x27;s policy, retaining footholds on the American coast which could be used as naval bases, while retaining the bulk of the fleet at home. Sandwich&#x27;s problems increased when Spain entered the war on France&#x27;s side in 1779 giving the Bourbon fleets a numerical advantage over the Royal Navy.

Prior to 1778 Keppel failed to persuade Sandwich to ignore technical difficulties and &quot;copper sheath only a few ships&quot;; he was later possibly unfairly to make political capital out of this in &quot;The London Magazine&quot;, March 1781. He had remarked that coppering &quot;gave additional strength to the navy&quot; and he reproached Lord Sandwich with having &quot;refused to sheath only a few ships with copper&quot; at his request, when he had since ordered the whole navy to be sheathed. The lack of coppering the navy was one of the key reasons leading to Britain losing the Thirteen Colonies.

In 1778 the new Navy Board Controller Charles Middleton, who had the major problem at the time with supplying over 100 ships for the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), compounded that year by French opportunism in declaring war on Britain to support the American rebels, effectively turned what was a local civil war into a global conflict. Others followed: Spain in 1779 and the Netherlands in 1780. Middleton took the view that Britain was &quot;outnumbered at every station&quot;, and the navy was required to &quot;extricate us from present danger&quot;. He understood that coppering allowed the navy to stay at sea for much longer without the need for cleaning and repairs to the underwater hull, making it a very attractive, if expensive, proposition. On 21 January 1779 he wrote to the Admiralty, and petitioned King George directly. The King backed him for what was an expensive process for an untested technology, and in May 1779 he placed orders at the Portsmouth Docks for coppering a total 51 ships within a year.

During 1779 a combined Franco-Spanish fleet was able to sail into the English Channel to threaten the coast of Cornwall in the initial stage of a Franco-Spanish invasion of Britain. Sandwich was criticised for the failure of the smaller British Channel Fleet to prevent this, although the invasion never materialised.

After 1778, the primary objective in the war was maintaining control over the sugar-rich West Indian archipelago. The lucrative sugar trade in the Caribbean was reckoned at the time as being of more importance to British interests than the 13 colonies. The sugar trade was paying for the costs of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783) and the Anglo-French War (1778–1783). The Royal Navy&#x27;s newly coppered ships as yet untested were used successfully by Rodney in defeating the French at the Battle of the Saintes off Dominica in February 1782.

By the time Sandwich&#x27;s administration ended, he would take full credit for coppering the fleet as one of his great achievements when defending his record in office in January 1782.

===Personal life===

For several years Sandwich had as a mistress Fanny Murray, the subject of John Wilkes&#x27; &quot;An Essay on Woman&quot; (1763), but he eventually married Dorothy Fane, daughter of the 1st Viscount Fane, by whom he had a son, John, Viscount Hinchingbrooke (1743–1814), who later succeeded as 5th Earl. Sandwich&#x27;s first tragedy was his wife&#x27;s deteriorating health and eventual insanity. During his wife&#x27;s decline, Sandwich started an affair with a singer named Martha Ray. During their relationship, Ray bore him at least five, and perhaps as many as nine, children, including Basil Montagu (1770–1851), writer, jurist and philanthropist. According to several sources, Sandwich was unable to provide adequately and permanently for his mistress and their children; she therefore encouraged the suit of Captain James Hackman (who in March 1779 exchanged the army for the clergy). In April 1779, Ray was killed by a shot to the head in the foyer of the Royal Opera House (Covent Garden) at the hands of Hackman, Rector of Wiveton. Sandwich never recovered from his grief. The events surrounding Ray&#x27;s murder were depicted in the popular novel &quot;Love and Madness&quot; (1780) by Herbert Croft.
In a famous exchange with the actor Samuel Foote, Sandwich declared, &quot;Foote, I have often wondered what catastrophe would bring you to your end; but I think, that you must either die of the pox, or the halter.&quot; &quot;My lord&quot;, replied Foote instantaneously, &quot;that will depend upon one of two contingencies; – whether I embrace your lordship&#x27;s mistress, or your lordship&#x27;s principles.&quot; This retort is often mistakenly attributed to John Wilkes.

Sandwich retired from public duty in 1782, and lived another ten years in retirement at the family seat, Hinchingbrooke House, Huntingdonshire, dying on 30 April 1792. His title of Earl of Sandwich passed to his eldest son, John Montagu, 5th Earl of Sandwich, who was 48 years old at the time. Sandwich was buried in All Saints&#x27; Church in Barnwell, Northamptonshire, of which only the chancel survives, kept to preserve the Montagu tombs.

==Legacy==
Sandwich retired in 1782. Despite holding a number of important posts during his career, Sandwich&#x27;s incompetence and corruption were legendary, inspiring the saying: &quot;Seldom has any man held so many offices and accomplished so little.&quot;

Some historians have suggested that Lord Sandwich was not perhaps as incompetent as suggested, but that previous historians have placed too much emphasis on sources from his political enemies.

===The sandwich===
The modern sandwich is named after Lord Sandwich, but the circumstances of its invention and original use are the subject of debate. A rumour in a contemporaneous travel book by Pierre-Jean Grosley, &quot;Tour to London&quot;, formed the popular myth that bread and meat sustained Lord Sandwich at the gambling table, but Sandwich had many habits, including the Hellfire Club, and any story may be a creation after the fact. Lord Sandwich was a very conversant gambler, the story goes, and he did not take the time to have a meal during his long hours playing at the card table. Consequently, he would ask his servants to bring him slices of meat between two slices of bread, a habit known among his gambling friends. Other people, according to this account, began to order &quot;the same as Sandwich!&quot;, and thus the &quot;sandwich&quot; was born. The sober alternative to this account is provided by Sandwich&#x27;s biographer N. A. M. Rodger, who suggests that Sandwich&#x27;s commitments to the navy, to politics, and to the arts mean that the first sandwich was more likely to have been consumed at his work desk.

===Islands named after Sandwich by Capt. James Cook===

Lord Sandwich was a great supporter of Captain James Cook. As First Lord of the Admiralty, Sandwich approved Admiralty funds for the purchase and fit-out of the , and for Cook&#x27;s second and third expeditions of exploration in the Pacific Ocean. He also arranged an audience with the King, which was an unusual privilege for a lower ranking officer. In honour of Sandwich, Cook named the Sandwich Islands (Hawaii) after him, as well as Montague Island off the south east coast of Australia, the South Sandwich Islands in the Southern Atlantic Ocean and Montague Island in the Gulf of Alaska. Hinchinbrook Island was named for the House owned by the Montagu family. Lord Sandwich donated the various items given him by Cook to Trinity College at the University of Cambridge. He also met the young Ra&#x27;iatean Omai, whom Cook had brought to Europe, and took him to his country estate for a week, presenting him with a suit of armour.

==Cricket==
Like his friends John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford and George Montagu-Dunk, 2nd Earl of Halifax, Sandwich was keen on cricket. The earliest surviving record of his involvement in the sport comes from 1741 when, as the patron and captain of the Huntingdonshire county team, Sandwich and Halifax formed the Northamptonshire &amp; Huntingdonshire team which twice defeated Bedfordshire, first at Woburn Park and then at Cow Meadow, Northampton.

==Music==
After his naval career, Sandwich turned his energy toward music. He became a great proponent of &quot;ancient music&quot; (defined by him as music more than two decades old). He was the patron of the Italian violinist Felice Giardini, and created a &quot;Catch Club&quot;, where professional singers would sing &quot;ancient&quot; and modern catches, glees, and madrigals. He also put on performances of George Frideric Handel&#x27;s oratorios, masques, and odes at his estate. Sandwich was instrumental in putting together the Concert of Ancient Music, the first public concert to showcase a canonic repertory of old works.

<text>Felis is a genus of small and medium-sized cat species native to most of Africa and south of 60° latitude in Europe and Asia to Indochina. The genus includes the domestic cat. The smallest of the seven &quot;Felis&quot; species is the black-footed cat with a head and body length from . The largest is the jungle cat with a head and body length from .

Genetic studies indicate that the Felinae genera &quot;Felis&quot;, &quot;Otocolobus&quot; and &quot;Prionailurus&quot; diverged from a Eurasian progenitor of the Felidae about 6.2 million years ago, and that &quot;Felis&quot; species split off 3.04 to 0.99 million years ago.

==Etymology==
The generic name &quot;Felis&quot; is derived from Classical Latin meaning &#x27;cat, ferret&#x27;.

==Taxonomy==
Carl Linnaeus considered &quot;Felis&quot; to comprise all cat species known until 1758. Later taxonomists split the cat family into different genera. In 1917, the British zoologist Reginald Innes Pocock revised the genus &quot;Felis&quot; as comprising only the ones listed in the following table. Estimated genetic divergence times of the listed species are indicated in million years ago (Mya), based on analysis of autosomal, xDNA, yDNA and mtDNA gene segments.

Pocock accepted the Pallas&#x27;s cat as the only member of the genus &quot;Otocolobus&quot;. Other scientists consider it also a &quot;Felis&quot; species.

Several scientists consider the Chinese mountain cat a subspecies of &quot;F. silvestris&quot;.

===Phylogeny===
The phylogenetic relationships of living &quot;Felis&quot; species are shown in the following cladogram:

===Extinct &quot;Felis&quot; species===
Extinct &quot;Felis&quot; species in the fossil record include:
* &quot;Felis lunensis&quot; 
* &quot;Felis wenzensis&quot; 

==Characteristics==
&quot;Felis&quot; species have high and wide skulls, short jaws and narrow ears with short tufts, but without any white spots on the back of the ears. Their pupils contract to a vertical slit.
A black cat from Transcaucasia described in 1904 as &quot;F. daemon&quot; by Satunin turned out to be a feral cat, probably a hybrid of wildcat and domestic cat.
The Kellas cat is a hybrid between domestic cat and European wildcat occurring in Scotland.

The Corsican wildcat is considered to have been introduced to Corsica before the beginning of the 1st millennium. A genetic study of a dozen individuals showed that they are closely related to the African wildcat originating in the Middle East.

<doc id="244844" wikidata="Q235574" url="?curid=244844" title="Songkhla province">
<text>Songkhla (, , ) is one of the southern provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from west clockwise) Satun, Phatthalung, Nakhon Si Thammarat, Pattani, and Yala. To the south it borders Kedah and Perlis of Malaysia.

In contrast to most other provinces, the capital Songkhla is not the largest city in the province. The much newer city of Hat Yai, with a population of 359,813, is considerably larger, with twice the population of Songkhla (163,072). This often leads to the misconception that Hat Yai is the provincial capital.

==Geography==
The province is on the Malay Peninsula, on the coast of the Gulf of Thailand. The highest elevation is Khao Mai Kaeo at 821 meters.

In the north of the province is Songkhla Lake, the largest natural lake in Thailand. This shallow lake covers an area of 1,040 km2, and has a south–north extent of 78 kilometers. At its mouth on the Gulf of Thailand, near the city of Songkhla, the water becomes brackish. A small population of Irrawaddy dolphins live in the lake, but are in danger of extinction due to accidental capture by the nets of the local fishing industry.

Songkhla province hosts three national parks. San Kala Khiri covers of mountain highlands on the Thai-Malay border.&lt;br&gt;Khao Nam Khang with an area of is also in the boundary mountains. Namtok Sai Khao on the Pattani-Songkhla border occupies an area of . The total forest area is or 11.2 percent of provincial area. Chinese Communist guerrillas inhabited this region until the 1980s.

Within the boundaries of the city of Songkhla is Cape Samila Beach, the most popular beach in the province. The famous mermaid statue can be found here. The two islands Ko Nu and Ko Maew (Mouse and Cat Islands), not far from the beach, are also popular landmarks, and a preferred fishing ground. According to a local folk tale, a cat, mouse and dog were traveling on a Chinese ship, when they attempted to steal a crystal from a merchant. While trying to swim ashore, both the cat and the mouse drowned and became the two islands; the dog reached the beach, then died and become the hill &quot;Khao Tang Kuan&quot;. The crystal turned into the white sandy beach.

==Toponymy==

The name Songkhla is actually the Thai corruption of Singgora (Jawi: سيڠڬورا); its original name means &quot;the city of lions&quot; in Malay (not to be confused with Singapura). This refers to a lion-shaped mountain near the city of Songkhla.

==History==
Songkhla was the seat of an old Malay Kingdom with heavy Srivijayan influence. In ancient times (200–1400 CE), Songkhla formed the northern extremity of the Malay Kingdom of Langkasuka. The city-state then succeeded as the Sultanate of Singgora, it later became a tributary of Nakhon Si Thammarat, suffering damage during several attempts to gain independence.

In Arabic-Persian merchant’s record from 1450-1550, Songkhla was firstly known as Singor or Singora.

Archaeological excavations on the isthmus between Lake Songkhla and the sea reveal that in the 10th through the 14th century this was a major urbanized area, and a center of international maritime trade, in particular with Quanzhou in China. The long Sanskrit name of the state that existed there has been lost; its short Sanskrit name was &quot;Singhapura&quot; (&quot;Lion City&quot;) (not to be confused with Singapura), a city state. The short vernacular name was Satingpra, coming from the Mon-Khmer &quot;sting&quot;/&quot;steng&quot;/&quot;stang&quot; (meaning &quot;river&quot;) and the Sanskrit &quot;pura&quot; (&quot;city&quot;). The ruins of the important port city of Satingpra are just few kilometres north of Songkhla city.

During 1619-1680, Songkhla Town beside Red Hill was very prosperous in trading with other countries by Malay governors migrating from Indonesia. They escaped from Dutch’s monopoly tradefor free trade in Songkhla which was supported by England. At the first period, during 1619-1642 the governor of Songkhla was Muslim. Later, In 1642-1680 the governor of Songkhla rebelled to Ayutthaya so the town was suppressed by King Narai and left carelessly. Then, Phatthalung took control of it. From 1699 to 1776, Songkhla reformed at the new location in Laemson called Songkhla Town at Laemson Side which is opposite to the current location of Songkhla town.

In 1836, King Rama III instructed Phraya Vichiankiri (Tianseng) to build the city wall fortress. During the construction of the wall, Tuanku Ahmadsa-adtogether with the rulers from Syburi, Pattani and 7 other provinces, attacked Songkhla. After their conquering all the rebellion, the fortress and the city wall were carried on. Also, the city pillar was set up and the town of Songkhla was moved to the east of Laem Son called Bo Yang District, which is now in the area of Songkhla Municipality.

Since the 18th century, Songkla has been firmly under Thai suzerainty. In 1909, Songkhla was formally annexed by Siam as part of Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, negotiated with the British Empire, in which Siam gave up its claim to Kelantan in return for Britain recognizing Siam&#x27;s right to the provinces north of that.

In the 18th century many Chinese immigrants, especially from Guangdong and Fujian, came to the province. Quickly rising to economic wealth, one of them won the bidding for the major tax farm of the province in 1769, establishing the &quot;Na Songkhla&quot; (&quot;from Songkhla&quot;) family as the most wealthy and influential. In 1777 the family also gained political power, when the old governor was dismissed and &quot;Luang&quot; Inthakhiri (Yiang, Chinese name Wu Rang (呉譲)) became the new governor. In 1786 the old governor started an uprising, which was put down after four months. The position was thereafter inherited in the family and was held by eight of his descendants until 1901, when &quot;Phraya&quot; Wichiankhiri (Chom) was honorably retired as part of the administrative reforms of Prince Damrong Rajanubhab. The family&#x27;s former home was converted into the Songkhla National Museum in 1953.

In 1932, Monthon Thesaphiban or the administrative subdivisions was dissolved and changed to provincial administration, Songkhla then becomes one of the provinces in the south of Thailand.

Songkhla was the scene of heavy fighting when the Imperial Japanese Army invaded Thailand on 8 December 1941 and parts of the city were destroyed.

==Demographics==
Buddhists make up two-thirds to three-fourths of the population, most of whom are of native Thai or Thai Chinese descent. One-fourth to one-third of the population are Muslim, most of them belong to a Thai-speaking Muslim group, called &quot;Sam-Sam&quot; (&quot; &#x27;mixed&#x27; &quot;). People claiming to be of Malay ethnicity make up a minority among the Muslim populace. The Songkhla Malays are very similar in ethnicity and culture to the Malays of Kelantan, Malaysia. They speak the language Songkhla Malay which is a derivative of Kelantan-Pattani Malay.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a conch shell on a Phan (tray) with glass decorations. The origin of the conch shell is unclear, but the most widely adopted interpretation is that it was a decoration on the jacket of the Prince of Songkhla.

The provincial tree is the &quot;Sa-dao-thiam&quot; (&quot;Azadirachta excelsa&quot;). The brackish fish green scat (&quot;Scatophagus argus&quot;) is the provincial aquatic life.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
Songkhla is divided into 16 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), which are further subdivided into 127 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 987 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
The districts of Chana (Malay: &quot;Chenok&quot;), Thepha (Malay: &quot;Tiba&quot;) were detached from &quot;Mueang&quot; Pattani and transferred to Songkhla during the &quot;Thesaphiban&quot; reforms around 1900.

===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Songkhla Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 48 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Songkhla and Hat Yai have city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further 11 have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and there are 35 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 92 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

== Health ==
Songkhla is served by a larger number of public hospitals than private hospitals. The main hospitals for Songkhla province are Hatyai Hospital and Songkhla Hospital, both operated by the Ministry of Public Health. Songklanagarind Hospital is also another major hospital located in Hat Yai, but is operated by the Faculty of Medicine, Prince of Songkla University, which is the largest medical school in the South of Thailand.

==Economy==
Songkhla province is an energy hub. It earns 100 billion baht each year from a gas separation plant, power generation, and oil. The gas separation plant sells 35 billion baht worth of gas per year to EGAT. Power generation accounts for 45 billion baht. Offshore oil rigs in the vicinity of Ko Nu produce 20,000 barrels of oil per day worth 30 billion baht per year. If a proposed coal-fired electrical generation plan in Thepha District goes ahead, energy earnings could rise to 300 billion baht per year.

==Transport==
===Road===
Phet Kasem Road, running all the way from Bangkok, ends at the border crossing to Malaysia in Sadao. Asian highway 2 and 18 also run through the province. Of note is the Tinsulanond Bridge, which crosses Songkhla Lake to connect the narrow land east of the lake at the coast with the main southern part of the province. With a length of 2.6 km it is the longest concrete bridge in Thailand. Built in 1986, the bridge consists of two parts. The southern 1,140 m connects Mueang district with the island Ko Yo, and the northern part of 1,800 m to Ban Khao Khiao.

Kanchanawanit Road, which runs from Songkhla town, though Hat Yai, and all the way to the Malaysian border at Sadao District, is considered the unofficial dividing line separating the Thai south from its deep south, Muslim-majority region.

===Rail===

The southern railway operated by the State Railway of Thailand runs through the province, and continues on into Malaysia, with Hat Yai Junction being the main railway station. It is a junction for the railway link to Malaysia through Padang Besar Town, where there are two stations: Padang Besar (Thai) on the Thai side and Padang Besar on the Malay side. Immigration is done on the Malay side. The other route from Hat Yai Junction goes further south to Pattani (Khok Pho), Yala, Tanyong Mat and Su-ngai Kolok. In the past, a railway line connected the town of Songkhla with Hat Yai, but it was closed in 1978 and is now partly dismantled and partly overgrown.

===Air===

Songkhla is served by Hat Yai International Airport in Khlong Hoi Khong District.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.


==Culture==
The most important Buddhist temple of the province is Wat Matchimawat (also named Wat Klang), on Saiburi road in the city of Songkhla itself.

On the island Ko Yo within Songkhla lake, since being easily accessible via the Tinsulanond Bridge, the residents have started to sell the hand-woven fabric named &quot;Phathor Ko Yo&quot;. Also famous for the island is the local jackfruit variant named &quot;Jampada&quot;.

Held in the first night of October, the &quot;Chak Phra&quot; tradition is a Buddhist festival specific to the south of Thailand. It is celebrated with Buddha boat processions or sports events like a run up Khao Tang Kuan hill.

In September or October at the &quot;Chinese Lunar festival&quot; the Thai-Chinese present their offerings to the moon or &quot;Queen of the heavens&quot; in gratitude for past and future fortunes.

===Military rule===
Songkhla was not initially affected by the outbreak of Pattani Separatism, which began in 2004. However, bombs planted in 2005 and 2007 stoked fears the insurgency might spread to Songkhla province.

, the provisions of Thailand&#x27;s Internal Security Act remain imposed on the districts of Chana, Na Thawi, Saba Yoi, and Thepha for reasons of national security. All but Chana share a border with Malaysia or Pattani province (Malay majority). Internal security restrictions, maintained by Thailand&#x27;s Internal Security Operations Command (ISOC) can result in curfews, prohibited entry, or prohibited transport of goods. It is considered one step below the imposition of full martial law.

== Sport ==
;Football

Songkhla football club participates in Thai League 3 Southern Region, the 3rd tier of Thai football league system. &quot;The Samila Mermaid&quot; (Thai: เงือกสมิหลา) plays their home matches at Tinsulanon Stadium.

<doc id="244847" wikidata="Q41456487" url="?curid=244847" title="Fire blight">
<text>Fire blight, also written fireblight, is a contagious disease affecting apples, pears, and some other members of the family Rosaceae. It is a serious concern to apple and pear producers. Under optimal conditions, it can destroy an entire orchard in a single growing season.

The causal pathogen is Erwinia amylovora, a Gram-negative bacterium in the genus &quot;Erwinia&quot;, order Enterobacterales. It is a short rod with rounded ends and many peritrichous flagellae. Pears are the most susceptible, but apples, loquat, crabapples, quinces, hawthorn, cotoneaster, &quot;Pyracantha&quot;, raspberry and some other rosaceous plants are also vulnerable. The disease is believed to be indigenous to North America, from where it spread to most of the rest of the world.

Fire blight is not believed to be present in Australia though it might possibly exist there. It has been a major reason for a long-standing embargo on the importation of New Zealand apples to Australia. In Europe it is listed as a quarantine disease, and has been spreading along hawthorn (&quot;Crataegus&quot;) hedges planted alongside railways, motorways and main roads.

==History==
Experiments in the early 1800s demonstrated that &quot;E. amylovora&quot; caused disease in plants, the first time that this could be shown. &quot;E. amylovora&quot; was found by Fritz Klement, a German scientist in 1910. It is generally accepted that this destructive crop bacterium initially originated in North America. Today, &quot;E. amylovora&quot; can currently be found in all the provinces of Canada, as well as in some parts of the United States of America, including Alabama, California, Colorado, Connecticut, Georgia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, New York, North Carolina, Ohio, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Virginia, Washington, West Virginia and Wisconsin. In the Americas it also occurs in other countries including, but not limited to, Mexico and Bermuda. On the African continent, &quot;E. amylovora&quot; has been confirmed in Egypt.

It is believed that the pathogen was first introduced into Northern Europe in the 1950s through fruit containers, contaminated with bacterial ooze, imported from the USA. During the 1950s-1960s, &quot;E. amylovora&quot; spread through much of Northern Europe. Initially large areas of Germany and France seemed untouched by fireblight, but the disease, and &quot;E. amylovora,&quot; were discovered in the later 1990s in Germany. In the 1980s the bacterium was found in isolated regions in the Eastern Mediterranean and from the years 1995-1996 cases of fireblight began to be reported in countries such as Hungary, Romania, Northern Italy and Northern Spain.

==Dissemination==

&quot;Erwinia amylovora&quot; overwinters in cankers formed during the previous season. In the spring warmer temperatures support development and bacteria-filled ooze begins to exude from the cankers. The factors that determine whether or not cankers become active are not well known, but it is thought that cankers found on larger or older tree limbs are more likely to become active. Honeybees and other insects are attracted to this ooze and can spread bacteria to susceptible tissue, such as flower stigmata. Birds, rain and wind can also transmit the bacterium to susceptible tissue, the colonisation of which will be heavily decided by temperature (21-27 C is most favourable) and moisture either from rain or heavy dew. Bacterial procession into the nectaries cause &quot;blossom blight&quot;. Flowers one to three days old are more susceptible than those five to eight days old. See Curry 1987 for the source and further review of this subject.

Other than through the flowers, the bacterium can enter the plant through the stomata. Also highly susceptible to infection are lesions such as punctures caused by plant-sucking insects and tears caused by a variety of means, including infected cultivating tools. A few minutes of heavy hail can spread the disease throughout an entire orchard and growers normally do not wait until symptoms appear but begin control measures within a few hours.

Once the bacterium gains access to the xylem or cortical parenchyma of the plant, it causes blackened, necrotic lesions, which may also produce a viscous exudate. This bacteria-laden exudate can be distributed to other parts of the same plant or to susceptible areas of different plants by rain, birds or insects, causing secondary infections. The disease spreads most quickly during hot, wet weather and is dormant in the winter when temperatures drop.

The pathogen spreads through the tree from the point of infection via the plant&#x27;s vascular system, eventually reaching the roots and/or graft junction of the plant. Once the plant&#x27;s roots are affected, the death of the plant often results. Over-pruning and too much fertilization (especially with nitrogen) can lead to water sprout and other midsummer growth that leave the tree more susceptible.

Unfortunately, while chemicals and meticulous pruning can keep an infected tree productive, there is no known comprehensive cure for fire blight; the best that can be done is to prevent its spread by measures such as avoidance of overhead water systems, as falling water can spread the disease and the careful pruning of tainted stems or branches. Great attention must be paid to any gardening tools that have been exposed to the causitive microorganisms. These tools should be disinfected in an alcohol solution containing three parts denatured alcohol to one part water. Diluted household bleach (one part bleach to nine parts water) can likewise be utilized. Of course, implements should afterwards be dried and oiled to forestall corrosion.

The fly &quot;Delia platura&quot; has been observed visiting fire blight wounds to feed and can successfully transmit fire blight to already damaged apple shoots. Fire blight exopolysaccharide also served as the adhesive to attach propagated cells to &quot;D. platura&quot;. &quot;D. platura&quot; shed fire blight at a constant rate - and did not suffer from doing so - for at least five days.

==Pathogenesis==
Pathogenicity depends on many different factors such as the production of the siderophore desferrioxamine, metalloproteases, plasmids, and histone-like proteins. However, some essential factors of pathogenicity are variations in the synthesis of extracellular polysaccharides (EPS) and the mechanism of type III secretion system and its associated proteins. EPS helps bacterial pathogens avoid plant defenses, “clog” the host’s vascular system, protect bacteria against desiccation and attach to both surfaces and one another. One EPS is amylovoran, a polymer of pentasaccharide repeating units. If a strain of &quot;E. amylovora&quot; cannot produce amylovoran it will not be pathogenic and will be unable to spread in plants. Levan is another EPS, and a lack of it will slow development of symptoms. Type III secretion systems are used for exporting and delivering effector proteins into the cytosol of host plants. This system mainly consists of Hrc proteins. Motility is another major virulence factor. Since &quot;E. amylovora&quot; is not an obligate biotroph, it is able to survive outside the host. This fact allows the organism to be spread by such a variety if methods.

==Symptoms==

Tissues affected by the symptoms of &quot;Erwinia amylovora&quot; include blossoms, fruits, shoots, and branches of apple (Pomoideae), pear, and many other rosaceous plants. All symptoms are above ground and are typically easy to recognize. Symptoms on blossoms include water soaking of the floral receptacle, ovary, and peduncles. This results in a dull, gray-green appearance 1–2 weeks after petal fall, and eventually tissues will shrivel and turn black. The base of the blossom and young fruit show similar symptoms as infection spreads. Opaque white- or amber-colored droplets of bacterial ooze can be seen on the infected tissue in high humidity. Shoots show similar symptoms but these develop much more rapidly. A “Shepherd&#x27;s Crook” can occur when the tip of the shoot wilts, and diseased shoot leaves typically have blackening along the mid-vein and before they die. When numerous, diseased shoots give the tree a blighted appearance. Infection of blossoms and shoots can spread to larger tree limbs. Branches will darken and become water soaked, eventually cracks will develop in bark. Wood under the bark will become streaked with black discoloration. Immature fruit forms water-soaked lesions and later turns black. Bacterial ooze can be found on these lesions. Severe infections result in fruit turning entirely black and shrivelling.

==Management==
In an attempt to prevent new infections, plants have been sprayed with either streptomycin, copper sulfate or both in some parts of the world, such as the USA, but has been found to be effective only for slowing or temporarily stopping growth in already diseased plants. The widespread use of streptomycin spray has led to antibiotic resistance in some areas, such as California and Washington. Certain biological controls consisting of beneficial bacteria or yeast can also prevent fire blight from infecting new trees. The only effective treatment for plants already infected is to prune off the affected branches and remove them from the area. Plants or trees should be inspected routinely for the appearance of new infections. The rest of the plant can be saved if the blighted wood is removed before the infection spreads to the roots. There is no known cure; prevention is the key.

Methods to predict the likelihood of an outbreak so that control measures can be best targeted, were introduced from the 1980s following the work of Eve Billings at East Malling Research Station, UK. These were based on temperature and rainfall, and have been developed further by Billings and others.

&quot;E. amylovora&quot; generally needs to be destroyed externally, before it enters plant tissues because once it enters the host, it spreads during the endophytic phase of pathogenesis. Once this happens external control methods become ineffective. The application of copper and antibiotics to the plant externally is the most effective method of prevention. Currently it has been noted that &quot;E. amylovora&quot; has developed a resistance to the antibiotic streptomycin, as do most bacteria able to transfer preferential genes horizontally from species to species.

New research conducted by John C. Wise out of Michigan State University shows that E. amylovora can be controlled with relative efficacy through tree trunk injection of either streptomycin, potassium phosphites (PH), or acibenzolar-S-methyl (ASM). PH and ASM both work through gene inductions of PR-1, PR-2, and PR-8 in the leafy material. Oxytetracycline Hydrochloride (OTC) was also tested and found to greatly reduce the activity of the bacteria within the tree. These new control methods are still being researched and have not been approved for fruit crop production by the EPA.

Phytosanitary measures have been employed as the best sanitary measures against &quot;E. amylovora&quot; dispersal. High risk countries are encouraged not to import plants susceptible to the pathogen into their territory because, once the bacteria become established in an area it is nearly impossible to eradicate the disease. Nurseries and orchards in such regions are placed on strict phytosanitary surveillance measures and well-monitored. Imported and infected crops are destroyed as soon as they are noticed since the bacteria spreads very rapidly and eradication methods are usually costly and inefficient.

Current fire blight strategies depend upon phytosanitary measures to lessen inoculum in the plantation and the utilization of splash medicines to forestall contamination, particularly blossom infections. Decreasing essential inoculum in the plantation by removing remainder holdover cankers during winter pruning is a set up as a basic method of control fire blight disease.

Slowing the growth rate of the tree will also slow the development of cankers. This may be achieved through reduced watering and fertilising. Controlling insects which cause tree wounds will also decrease secondary infection.

Cultural control options include selecting resistant cultivars, however most commercially successful apple cultivars lack fire blight resistance. Breeders have developed fire blight resistant rootstocks, but resistance is not conferred to the grafted scion.

Prohexadione calcium (BASF brand name Apogee in the United States) is a plant growth inhibitor which is recommended for shoot blight. Since fire blight relies on gibberellin-dependent growth for much of its own life cycle, prohexadione&#x27;s gibberellin synthesis inhibition effect also suppresses blight. Not effective in blossom blight.

==Importance==
Besides the historical significance of being the first bacterium proven to be a plant pathogen, fire blight is extremely important economically. Costs for control and loss are estimated to be approximately $100 million per year in the USA. Specifically, in Michigan in the year 2000, $42 million in losses were estimated because of the removal of about 400,000 apple trees. Warm, humid, and wet weather in May gave rise to this epidemic. In Washington and northern Oregon approximately $68 million in losses were estimated. &quot;E. amylovora&quot; has spread throughout the USA and much of the world,causing heavy losses, although it so far has not caused severe damage in northern Europe and, as long as &quot;E. amylovora&quot; is not introduced to Central Asia where wild apple trees still grow, it will not modify any ecosystems. Biodiversity is not impacted either, as no plant species are threatened with extinction due to this pathogen. Growing pears in Emilia-Romagna in Italy is a traditional activity for some families, and fire blight threatens this tradition which has been passed down for several generations. In southern Germany apple and pear trees have been a part of the landscape for a long time, and are difficult to protect. The decline of apple and pear trees from their landscape can be expensive to replace and could have a negative effect on tourism. In the long-run, fire blight is a very important factor of economy and society.

A relatively small number of apple cultivars are responsible for an enormous proportion of yearly apple production. Food sellers and shoppers prize these cultivars for their appearance, quality, flavour, and storability, while cultivators additionally esteem their orchard attributes and guaranteed market due to this popularity. To maintain the desirable qualities of a cultivar while at the same time changing its disease resistance through ordinary breeding techniques is for all intents and purposes impossible due to the apple&#x27;s heterozygosity, self-incongruence, and long growth span. Hereditary designing offers an appealing option since it can be faster, resistance qualities can be acquired from numerous sources, the statement of local apple qualities can be altered, and the attractive characteristics of the changed cultivar or rootstock can be safeguarded.

==Association with Asian pear blight==
Asian pear blight, a disease affecting Japanese and Korean pears, has been associated with fire blight, including in the popular press. Genetic testing has shown Asian pear blight to be a variant of &quot;Erwinia pyrifoliae&quot;, unrelated to fire blight.

<doc id="244851" wikidata="Q4227955" url="?curid=244851" title="Lewis &amp; Clark College">
<text>Lewis &amp; Clark College is a private liberal arts college in Portland, Oregon. It was founded in 1867 and is situated on the historic M. Lloyd Frank Estate in South Portland&#x27;s Collins View neighborhood. It is composed of three distinct but adjacent campuses: the College of Arts &amp; Sciences, the Graduate School of Education &amp; Counseling, and the Law School. Lewis &amp; Clark is a member of the Annapolis Group of colleges with athletic programs competing in the National Collegiate Athletic Association&#x27;s Division III Northwest Conference.

==History==

Like many modern American universities, the institution that would eventually become Lewis &amp; Clark was initially intended to provide secondary as well as higher education for a specific religious community, in this case Presbyterian pioneers in Oregon&#x27;s Willamette Valley. The Presbyterian church incorporated Albany Academy in 1858. 

Within a decade of its founding, Albany Academy began to focus more exclusively on higher education, changing its official name to the Albany Collegiate Institution in 1866. Lewis &amp; Clark&#x27;s official founding date comes from the current charter, which has been legally valid since the Presbyterian church reincorporated the Albany Collegiate Institution as Albany College in 1867. Unlike most Oregon colleges of the pioneer era, the college has been co-educational since the first class, which graduated in 1873. The early campus of in Albany was situated on land donated by the Monteith family. In 1892, the original school building was enlarged, and in 1925 the school relocated south of Albany, where it remained until 1937.

Albany College established a junior college to the north in Portland in 1934, with the entire school moving to Portland in 1939. The former campus grounds later became home to the federal government&#x27;s Albany Research Center. In 1942 the college trustees acquired the Lloyd Frank (of the historic Portland department store Meier &amp; Frank) &quot;Fir Acres&quot; estate in South Portland, and the school name was changed to Lewis &amp; Clark College.

==Rankings==
The 2020 annual ranking of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; categorizes Lewis &amp; Clark as &quot;more selective&quot; and ranks it tied for the 72nd best liberal arts college in the U.S.; &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; also ranked it tied for 51st in undergraduate teaching and 89th for &quot;Best Value&quot; among liberal arts colleges. &quot;Forbes&quot; in 2019 rated it 184th in its America&#x27;s Top Colleges ranking, which includes 650 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges and 69th among liberal arts colleges. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Lewis &amp; Clark at 66th in its 2019 ranking of 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Lewis &amp; Clark 585th out of 744 in its &quot;Best Colleges For Your Money 2019&quot; report.

==Campus==
Lewis &amp; Clark&#x27;s forested campus sits atop Palatine Hill in the Collins View neighborhood of Portland and is contiguous with the Tryon Creek State Natural Area. Campus buildings include an award-winning environmentally sustainable academic building (John R. Howard Hall), as well as notable historic architecture such as the Frank Manor House (designed by Herman Brookman) and Rogers Hall (formerly Our Lady of Angels convent of The Sisters of St. Francis).

Lewis &amp; Clark was named one of America&#x27;s top ten &quot;Most Beautiful Campuses&quot; by the Princeton Review,
Travel+Leisure
as well as an independent architecture blog.

===Residence halls===

All students are required to live on campus for the first two years, excepting those already residents of Portland, those over the age of 21 before the start of the Fall term, the married, and transfer students with at least 61 credit hours. 

Most Lewis &amp; Clark College residence halls are co-ed. While individual rooms generally house one gender, students may opt otherwise under the college&#x27;s gender-neutral housing policy.

==Student life==

===Sustainability===

Wind power provides 100% of the college&#x27;s total electricity, and LEED-&quot;certified&quot; level must be met for all of the college&#x27;s projects.

===Athletics===

Lewis &amp; Clark maintains 10 male and 11 female varsity sports teams and athletic facilities including Pamplin Sports Center and Griswold Stadium. Lewis &amp; Clark athletic teams are called the Pioneers, and team colors are orange and black. The Pioneers compete mainly in the Northwest Conference against eight other NCAA Division III institutions in the Pacific Northwest. 17% of undergraduates are officially designated student athletes as of Fall 2021. In the 2011 season, the women&#x27;s cross-country team placed seventh at West regionals, with the men&#x27;s team placing 13th. The 2011-2012 men&#x27;s basketball team lost in the NWC semifinals putting them in 4th place in the conference. Additionally, the women&#x27;s team of that same year placed second in the NWC and made an appearance in the NCAA DIII National tournament. 

A large number of smaller club and intramural sports such as Rugby and Ultimate Frisbee enjoy broad participation. Lewis &amp; Clark students have invented several intramural competitive sports, including Ninja and Wolvetch, which are popular at Lewis &amp; Clark but seldom played elsewhere.

===Transportation===

Throughout the year the college operates a shuttle bus between campus and downtown Portland, the Pioneer Express (also referred to as the &quot;Pio Express&quot; or just, &quot;the Pio&quot;).

<doc id="244860" wikidata="Q337117" url="?curid=244860" title="Charlie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton">
<text>Charles Leslie Falconer, Baron Falconer of Thoroton, (born 19 November 1951) is a British Labour politician, peer and barrister who served as Lord Chancellor and Secretary of State for Justice under Prime Minister Tony Blair from 2003 to 2007.

Born in Edinburgh, Falconer read law at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge and then worked as a barrister in London. During his time as a barrister, he was a flatmate of Tony Blair. Although Blair went into politics, Falconer focused on his legal career and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel. After Blair was elected as Prime Minister, Falconer was created a life peer and made Solicitor General for England and Wales. He is the only known person to have served as Solicitor General as a peer. Later, he served as Minister of State for the Cabinet Office, Minister of State for Housing, Planning and Regeneration and Minister of State for Criminal Justice, Sentencing and Law Reform respectively.

Falconer became the Lord Chancellor and the first Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs in 2003, and would go on to become the first Secretary of State for Justice in a 2007 reorganisation and enlargement of the portfolio of the Department for Constitutional Affairs. He held this role for over a month until Gordon Brown became Prime Minister in June 2007. Falconer was named Shadow Justice Secretary under the acting leadership of Harriet Harman in 2015, and continued in this role after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the party, until he resigned on 26 June 2016. He was appointed as Shadow Attorney General in the Shadow Cabinet of Keir Starmer in April 2020, and stepped down from the role in November 2021.

==Early life and career==
Charles Leslie Falconer was born in Edinburgh, Scotland, on 19 November 1951, the son of John Leslie Falconer, a solicitor, and his wife Anne Mansel. His paternal grandfather was John Ireland Falconer, a former Lord Provost of Edinburgh. Falconer was educated at the Edinburgh Academy and Trinity College, Glenalmond. He read law at Queens&#x27; College, Cambridge.

Falconer became a flatmate of Tony Blair when they were both young barristers in London in the late 1970s in Wandsworth, having first met as pupils at rival Scottish schools in the 1960s. While Blair went into politics, Falconer concentrated on his legal career. He practised from Fountain Court Chambers in London, and became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1991.

Falconer applied to be the Labour candidate for the safe seat of Dudley North ahead of the 1997 general election, but he &quot;fluffed&quot; his interview with the Labour constituency committee by refusing to take his four children out of public schools. Barrister Ross Cranston was selected instead and won the seat, holding it from 1997 to 2005. Cranston succeeded Falconer as Solicitor General for England and Wales, serving from 1998 to 2001.

==Ennoblement and junior ministerial career==
On 14 May 1997, just after Blair became Prime Minister, Falconer was created a life peer as Baron Falconer of Thoroton, of Thoroton in the County of Nottinghamshire. He was the first peer created on the new Prime Minister&#x27;s recommendation, and immediately joined the government as Solicitor General.

Falconer became Minister of State at the Cabinet Office in 1998, taking over responsibility for the Millennium Dome following the resignation of Peter Mandelson. He acquired the nickname of &quot;Dome Secretary&quot; (a play on the position of Home Secretary) over time. He was heavily criticised for the failure of the Dome to attract an audience, but resisted calls for his resignation. This was in contrast to the sacking of Dome chief executive Jennie Page just one month after the fiasco of the New Millennium eve opening night.

Following the 2001 election, Falconer joined the Department for Transport, Local Government and the Regions as Minister for Housing, Planning and Regeneration. He moved on to the Home Office in 2002, being given responsibility for criminal justice, sentencing and law reform. He reportedly annoyed some of his fellow lawyers by suggesting that their fees were too high.

==Cabinet minister, 2003–2007==
In 2003 Falconer joined the Cabinet as the Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, becoming also Lord Chancellor &quot;for the interim period&quot; before the office was planned to be abolished. The government argued that the position of a cabinet minister as a judge and head of the judiciary was no longer appropriate and would not be upheld by the European Convention on Human Rights.

The announcement was generally seen as a rushed &quot;back-of-an-envelope&quot; plan. There had been no Green paper discussions nor White paper proposals; and it became something of a shock to realise that the proposed abolition of the office of Lord Chancellor would require primary legislation. The policy of removing the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s judicial role was said to be disliked by Lord Irvine of Lairg, the previous Lord Chancellor.

The post of Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs took over the remaining responsibilities of the Lord Chancellor, and also became the sponsoring department for the Secretary of State for Wales and the Secretary of State for Scotland. Falconer announced his intention not to use the Lord Chancellor&#x27;s power to sit as a judge and stopped wearing the traditional robe and wig of office. Falconer hoped to be the last to hold the title, ending 1,400 years of tradition.

However, in 2006 Falconer told the House of Lords Constitution Committee that he regretted campaigning for the abolition of the role of Lord Chancellor and was glad the title had been reserved. In his opinion, the office &quot;still had a role to play in defending the independence of the courts.&quot;

===Freedom of Information Act===
In his role as Secretary of State for Constitutional Affairs, Falconer sought to make it easier for government bodies to refuse to release documents under the Freedom of Information Act (2000), on the grounds that they are too expensive and too time-consuming for civil servants to find. The legislation allowed requests for information to be refused if the cost they would incur exceeded £600 for Whitehall and £450 for other public bodies. Falconer proposed changes that would make no difference to this level, but would expand the number of activities whose cost would be included in the totals, thus making it easier for government parties to refuse requests for information. At the end of March 2007, Falconer&#x27;s department announced that it would not introduce the proposals to parliament, but would instead have a second three-month consultation with the public (the previous consultation, also of three months, ended three weeks previous to this). Media elements reported this change as a &#x27;backtracking&#x27;, and Maurice Frankel, director of the Campaign for Freedom of Information, was quoted as saying &quot;This raises the strong possibility that the government will decide to leave the current arrangements untouched&quot;.

==Later parliamentary career, 2007–==

Falconer was replaced in his ministerial posts by Jack Straw in Gordon Brown&#x27;s inaugural cabinet reshuffle, with Straw becoming the first non-Member of the House of Lords to take up the historic office of Lord Chancellor.

In February 2008, Falconer told a BBC radio programme that the government should require certain news articles to be removed from online archives during sensitive trials. This move was questioned as the articles were readily available in printed newspapers and other physical media, presenting a possible misunderstanding of the internet as a medium.

On 7 June 2009, while being interviewed by the BBC &quot;Politics Show&quot;, Falconer called for an urgent debate on Gordon Brown&#x27;s leadership, as Labour braced itself for &quot;terrible&quot; election results at the 2009 European Parliament Elections, following being &quot;humiliated&quot; at the 2009 County Council elections. He said he was &quot;not sure&quot; Labour could unite while Brown remained leader, arguing &quot;can we get unity under the current leadership? I am not sure that we can and we need to debate it urgently and I think probably it will need a change in leader.&quot; He said he admired Gordon Brown &quot;greatly&quot; but said he had an &quot;inability to hold the party together&quot;.

In 2014, Falconer proposed the Assisted Dying Bill to the House of Lords, which seeks to legalise euthanasia in the UK for those who have less than six months to live, building on the experience of the Oregon Death with Dignity Act.

Falconer was named Shadow Secretary of State for Justice under the acting leadership of Harriet Harman in 2015, and continued in this role after the election of Jeremy Corbyn as leader of the party, until—along with dozens of his colleagues—he resigned on 26 June 2016. He was appointed Shadow Attorney General in the Starmer shadow cabinet on 6 April 2020, but stepped down following a shadow cabinet reshuffle in November 2021.

In 2018, he apologised for his role as Lord Chancellor in the war on drugs, and now thought drug prohibition had been a &quot;tragic disaster&quot; for the poor worldwide. He thought governments should take control of drug supply, thus reducing the involvement of violent gangs, and proposed that the legal regulation of drug production and supply should be in the next Labour manifesto.

==Extraparliamentary activities==
Since leaving office, Falconer has gone on to hold various positions outside Parliament. On 22 May 2008, it was announced that he had been appointed as Chairman of the AmicusHorizon Group Limited, a Registered Social Landlord.

On 8 July 2008, Falconer joined US law firm Gibson, Dunn &amp; Crutcher as a senior counsel, where he remained as late as April 2021. At this time, the Greensill scandal dragged him into the mire over his advice to extramural firms in relation to the COVID-19 pandemic in the UK, which he once called &quot;the gift that keeps on giving&quot; for lawyers; however, he regretted saying this.

==Personal life==
He married Marianna Catherine Thoroton Hildyard, a barrister, in 1985. She became a QC in 2002. Hildyard is a Circuit Judge, known as Her Honour Judge Hildyard KC, and the Designated Family Judge for Luton. Her father, Sir David Henry Thoroton Hildyard (grandson of Gen. Sir Henry John Thoroton Hildyard), was the British Ambassador to Chile and her brother, Sir Robert Henry Thoroton Hildyard, is a High Court Judge. They have four children: Hamish, William &quot;Rocco&quot;, Rosie and Johnny. Falconer placed his three sons at independent Westminster School and St Paul&#x27;s School, and his daughter at South Hampstead High School. In the lead-up to the 1997 election, as he attempted to be selected for the seat of Dudley East, it proved to be an electoral problem for Falconer. He intended to keep his children at Westminster if selected, which caused the local selection panel to drop him from the selection procedure.

He and his family own a house and a basement flat in Islington. They also own a country retreat in Thoroton, Nottinghamshire. Falconer&#x27;s father used to live in the village, and they rent out his old home.

Falconer was chairman of Cambridge University Amnesty International between 2006 and 2007, and is the director of Sudan Divestment. He is chairman of the board for a social enterprise set up at Pentonville Prison, Liberty Kitchen.

Falconer lost over five stone between 2012 and 2014, consuming only Diet Coke and apples apart from dinner, eschewing tea, coffee and alcohol, and jogging for 45 minutes a day.

In the general election in July 2024, his son Hamish was elected as MP for Lincoln.

<doc id="244862" wikidata="Q19323" url="?curid=244862" title="FIFA Women's World Cup">
<text>The FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup is an international association football competition contested by the senior women&#x27;s national teams of the members of Fédération Internationale de Football Association (FIFA), the sport&#x27;s international governing body. The competition has been held every four years and one year after the men&#x27;s FIFA World Cup since 1991, when the inaugural tournament, then called the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Championship, was held in China. Under the tournament&#x27;s current format, national teams vie for the remaining 31 slots in a three-year qualification phase. The host nation&#x27;s team is automatically entered as the first slot. The tournament, called the &quot;World Cup Finals&quot;, is contested at venues within the host nation(s) over about one month.

The nine FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup tournaments have been won by five national teams. The United States have won four times. The other winners are Germany, with two titles, and Japan, Norway, and Spain with one title each.

Eight countries have hosted the Women&#x27;s World Cup. China and the United States have each hosted the tournament twice, while Australia, Canada, France, Germany, New Zealand, and Sweden have each hosted it once.

The 2023 competition was hosted by Australia and New Zealand, making it the first edition to be held in the Southern Hemisphere, the first Women&#x27;s World Cup to be hosted by two countries, as well as the first FIFA competition for either men or women to be held across two confederations.

The 2027 competition will be hosted by Brazil, making it the first edition to be held in South America.

==Format==
===Qualification===
Qualifying tournaments are held within the six FIFA continental zones (Africa, Asia, North and Central America and Caribbean, South America, Oceania, Europe), and are organized by their respective confederations: Confederation of African Football (CAF), Asian Football Confederation (AFC), Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football (CONCACAF), South American Football Confederation (CONMEBOL), Oceania Football Confederation (OFC), and Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). For each tournament, FIFA decides beforehand the number of berths awarded to each of the continental zones, based on the relative strength of the confederations&#x27; teams. The hosts of the World Cup receive an automatic berth in the finals. Except for the UEFA, other confederations organize its qualification campaign throughout continental tournaments. Since the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, the number of finalists increased from 16 to 24 and now 32.

===Final tournament===
The final tournament has featured between 12 and 32 national teams competing over about one month in the host nation(s). There are two stages: the group stage followed by the knockout stage.

In the group stage, teams are drawn into groups of four teams each. Each group plays a round-robin tournament, in which each team is scheduled for three matches against other teams in the same group. The last round of matches of each group is scheduled at the same time to preserve fairness among all four teams. In the 2015 24-team format, the two teams finishing first and second in each group and the four best teams among those ranked third qualified for the round of 16, also called the knockout stage. Points are used to rank the teams within a group. Since 1994, Three points have been awarded for a win, one for a draw and none for a loss (before, winners received two points).

The ranking of each team in each group is determined as follows:
# Greatest number of points in group matches
# Greatest goal difference in group matches
# Greatest number of goals scored in group matches
# If more than one team remains level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined as follows:
## Greatest number of points in head-to-head matches among those teams
## Greatest goal difference in head-to-head matches among those teams
## Greatest number of goals scored in head-to-head matches among those teams
# If any of the teams above remain level after applying the above criteria, their ranking will be determined by the drawing of lots

The knockout stage is a single-elimination tournament in which teams play each other in one-off matches, with extra time and penalty shootouts used to decide the winners if necessary. It begins with the round of 16. This is followed by the quarter-finals, semi-finals, the third-place match (contested by the losing semi-finalists), and the final.

==History==
The first instance of a Women&#x27;s World Cup dates back to 1970 in Italy, with the first tournament of that name taking place in July 1970, which Denmark won. This was followed by another unofficial World Cup tournament in Mexico in 1971, in which Denmark won the title after defeating Mexico, 3–0, in the final at the Azteca Stadium. In the 1980s, the Mundialito was held in Italy across four editions with both Italy and England winning two titles.

Several countries lifted bans on women&#x27;s football in the 1970s, leading to new teams being established in many countries. After official continental women&#x27;s tournaments were held in Asia in 1975 and Europe in 1984, Ellen Wille declared that she wanted better effort from the FIFA Congress in promoting the women&#x27;s game. This came in the form of the 1988 FIFA Women&#x27;s Invitation Tournament in China as a test to see if a global women&#x27;s World Cup was feasible. Twelve national teams took part in the competition – four from UEFA, three from AFC, two from CONCACAF, one each from CONMEBOL, CAF and OFC. After the opening match of the tournament between China and Canada was attended by 45,000 people, the tournament was deemed a success, with crowds averaging 20,000. Norway, who was the European champions, defeated Sweden, 1–0, in the final, while Brazil clinched third place by beating the hosts in a penalty shootout. The competition was deemed a success and on 30 June FIFA approved the establishment of an official World Cup, which was to take place in 1991 again in China. Again, twelve teams competed, this time culminating in the United States defeating Norway in the final, 2–1, with Michelle Akers scoring two goals.

The 1995 edition in Sweden saw the experiment of a time-out concept throughout the tournament which was later tightened mid-tournament to only occur after a break in play. The time-out only appeared in the one tournament which saw it scrapped. The final of the 1995 edition saw Norway, who scored 17 goals in the group stage, defeat Germany, 2–0, to capture their only title.
In the 1999 edition, one of the most famous moments of the tournament was American defender Brandi Chastain&#x27;s victory celebration after scoring the Cup-winning penalty kick against China. She took off her jersey and waved it over her head (as men frequently do) as she celebrated. The 1999 final in the Rose Bowl in Pasadena, California, had an attendance of 90,185.

The 1999 and 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cups were both held in the United States; in 2003 China was supposed to host it, but the tournament was moved because of SARS. As compensation, China retained their automatic qualification to the 2003 tournament as host nation, and was automatically chosen to host the 2007 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. Germany hosted the 2011 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, as decided by vote in October 2007. In March 2011, FIFA awarded Canada the right to host the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup. The 2015 competition saw the field expand from 16 to 24 teams.

During the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup, both Formiga of Brazil and Homare Sawa of Japan appeared in their record sixth World Cup, a feat that had never been achieved before by either female or male players. Christie Pearce became the oldest player to ever play in a Women&#x27;s World Cup match, at the age of 40 years. In March 2015, FIFA awarded France the right to host the 2019 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup over South Korea.

In the 2019 edition, which was held in France, the United States won the tournament for the fourth time.

In 2023, Australia and New Zealand hosted the FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup for the first time as joint hosts, and the number of participants was expanded from 24 to 32. It was also the first tournament to be held in the Southern Hemisphere. With Australia and New Zealand respectively being members of the Asian Football Confederation and Oceania Football Confederation, this was the first FIFA senior competition to be hosted across two confederations. Spain won their first-ever title, defeating England 1-0 in the final. This made Spain the 2nd nation to win both the Men&#x27;s and Women&#x27;s World Cup, after Germany.

==Trophy==
The current trophy was designed in 1998 by William Sawaya for the 1999 tournament and takes the form of a spiral band, enclosing a football at the top. It was sculpted by Sawaya &amp; Moroni in Milan and stands tall, weighs and is made of sterling silver clad in 23-karat yellow and white gold. In the 2010s, it was fitted with a cone-shaped base. Underneath the base, the name of each of the tournament&#x27;s previous winners is engraved. The trophy had an estimated value in 2015 of approximately $30,000; by contrast, the men&#x27;s World Cup trophy is fabricated in 18-karat gold and has a precious metal value of $150,000. However, a new Winner&#x27;s Trophy is constructed for each women&#x27;s champion to take home, while there is only one original women&#x27;s trophy which is retained by FIFA with each women&#x27;s champion taking home a replica trophy.

Since 2007, the winners are also awarded the FIFA Champions Badge, which is worn on the jerseys of the winning team until the winners of the next tournament have been decided.

Notes:
* The 2003 Women&#x27;s World Cup was initially planned to be hosted by China, with FIFA awarding the hosting rights in October 2000. Following a SARS outbreak, it was re-awarded to the United States in May 2003.
* The 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup set a new attendance record for all FIFA competitions besides the men&#x27;s FIFA World Cup.

==Results==



;Notes
In total, 44 nations have played in at least one Women&#x27;s World Cup. Of those, five nations have won the World Cup. With four titles, the United States is the most successful Women&#x27;s World Cup team; it is one of only seven nations to play in every World Cup. They have also had the most top-four finishes (8), medals (8), as well as final appearances (5), including the longest streak of three consecutive finals in 2011, 2015, and 2019.

===Teams reaching the top four===


:* &quot;host nation&quot;

===Best performance by confederations===
, four of the six FIFA confederations have made it to a Women&#x27;s World Cup final, the only exceptions being CAF (Africa) and the OFC (Oceania). CONMEBOL is the only confederation to have made a World Cup final without winning, following Brazil&#x27;s defeat in the 2007 final. The farthest advancing African team was Nigeria, who were eliminated in the quarter-finals in 1999. Oceania has sent two teams, Australia and New Zealand, to the World Cup, but Australia did not advance from the group stage until after the country&#x27;s football association moved to the Asian Football Confederation, and New Zealand (which remains in the OFC) has never advanced to the knockout rounds.

The United States and Norway are the only teams to have won a tournament hosted by their own confederations, with the U.S. winning in 1999 (at home) and 2015 (in Canada), and Norway in 1995 (in Sweden).

==Broadcasting and revenue==
, the 2015 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup Final was the most watched soccer match in American history with nearly 23 million viewers, more than the 2015 NBA Finals and Stanley Cup. It was also the most watched Spanish-language broadcast in tournament history. More than 750 million viewers were reported to have watched the tournament worldwide.

The 2015 Women&#x27;s World Cup generated almost $73 million. By comparison, that equates to 1% of the revenue generated by the 2018 men&#x27;s tournament of $6.1 billion.

In 2023, FIFA separated broadcast rights for the Women&#x27;s World Cup from the men&#x27;s tournament for the first time, and president Gianni Infantino suggested in May 2023 that the 2023 FIFA Women&#x27;s World Cup might not be broadcast in the &quot;Big 5&quot; European countries due to disappointing offers. , FIFA had yet to reach broadcast agreements in Spain, Germany, Italy, France, Japan, or the United Kingdom, with German broadcasters ZDF and ARD bidding 3% as much for the Women&#x27;s World Cup as the 2022 men&#x27;s World Cup, French and Spanish broadcasters less than 5%, and Italian broadcasters less than 1%.

<text>Yoshimichi Hara (原嘉道) (February 18, 1867 – August 7, 1944) was a Japanese statesman and the president of the Japanese privy council during World War II, from June 1940 until his death.

Hara was always reluctant to use military force. In particular, he protested against the outbreak of the Pacific war at Gozen Kaigi.

Historian Charles Kupfer contradicts this statement in &quot;Indomitable Will: Turning Defeat into Victory from Pearl Harbor to Midway&quot;, Hara recognized the growing threat of American influence in the Pacific region prior to American involvement in World War II, and was a key advocate for the attack on Pearl Harbor. Hara was of the opinion that the longer Japan waited to engage the United States, the weaker its position would become thus subjugating the island nation to the will of American dominance in the region. Indeed, Hara as president of the privy council, had very little political control, since almost all political power was concentrated in war cabinets. Hara did, however, act as the voice for Emperor Hirohito in the privy council and delivered the Emperor&#x27;s decision to go to war on December 1, 1941, stating that to yield to American demands would threaten the existence of the Empire of Japan.

After his death, Hara was decorated with the posthumous title of Imperial . He was the last commoner to become part of the Japanese aristocracy.

<text>The Group of Seven, once known as the Algonquin School, was a group of Canadian landscape painters from 1920 to 1933, with &quot;a like vision&quot;. It originally consisted of Franklin Carmichael (1890–1945), Lawren Harris (1885–1970), A. Y. Jackson (1882–1974), Frank Johnston (1888–1949), Arthur Lismer (1885–1969), J. E. H. MacDonald (1873–1932), and Frederick Varley (1881–1969). A. J. Casson (1898–1992) was invited to join in 1926, Edwin Holgate (1892–1977) became a member in 1930, and Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald (1890–1956) joined in 1932.

Two artists associated with the group are Tom Thomson (1877–1917) and Emily Carr (1871–1945). Although he died before its official formation, Thomson had a significant influence on the group. In his essay &quot;The Story of the Group of Seven&quot;, Harris wrote that Thomson was &quot;a part of the movement before we pinned a label on it&quot;; Thomson&#x27;s paintings &quot;The West Wind&quot; and &quot;The Jack Pine&quot; are two of the group&#x27;s most iconic pieces. 

Believing that a distinct Canadian art could be developed through direct contact with nature, the Group of Seven is best known for its paintings inspired by the Canadian landscape, and initiated the first major Canadian national art movement. The Group was succeeded by the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933, which included members from the Beaver Hall Group who had a history of showing with the Group of Seven both nationally and internationally.

As Montreal critic Robert Ayre said in 1940 of the period of time in which the Group of Seven was founded, &quot;It was a grand time, a big, dramatic, heroic, if you like extravagant, optimistic time&quot;.

==Collections==
Large collections of work of the Group of Seven are located at the Art Gallery of Ontario in Toronto, the National Gallery of Canada in Ottawa as well as the Ottawa Art Gallery (home to The Firestone Collection of Canadian Art) and the McMichael Canadian Art Collection in Kleinburg, Ontario. The National Gallery, under the directorship of Eric Brown, was an early institutional supporter of artists associated with the Group, purchasing art from some of their early exhibitions before they had identified themselves officially as the Group of Seven and afterwards. The Art Gallery of Ontario, in its earlier incarnation as the Art Gallery of Toronto, was the site of their first exhibition as the Group of Seven in 1920. The McMichael Canadian Art Collection was founded by Robert and Signe McMichael, who began collecting paintings by the Group of Seven and their contemporaries in 1955.

==History==

Tom Thomson, J. E. H. MacDonald, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Frank Johnston and Franklin Carmichael met as employees of the design firm Grip Ltd. in Toronto. In 1913, they were joined by A. Y. (Alexander Young) Jackson and Lawren Harris. They often met at the Arts and Letters Club of Toronto to discuss their opinions and share their opinions about art.

This group received monetary support from Harris (heir to the Massey-Harris farm machinery fortune) and Dr. James MacCallum. Harris and MacCallum jointly built the Studio Building in 1914 in the Rosedale ravine to serve as a meeting and working place for the new Canadian art movement. MacCallum owned an island on Georgian Bay and Thomson worked as a guide in nearby Algonquin Park, both places where he and the other artists often travelled for inspiration.
The informal group was temporarily split up during World War I, during which Jackson and Varley became official war artists. Jackson enlisted in June 1915 and served in France from November 1915 to 1917, at which point he was seriously injured. Harris enlisted in 1916 and taught musketry at Camp Borden. He was discharged in May 1918 after suffering a nervous breakdown. Carmichael, MacDonald, Thomson, Varley and Johnston remained in Toronto and struggled in the depressed wartime economy. A further blow to the group came in 1917 when Thomson died mysteriously while canoeing in Algonquin Park. The circumstances of his death remain unclear.

The seven who formed the original group reunited after the war. They continued to travel throughout Ontario, especially the Muskoka and Algoma regions, sketching the landscape and developing techniques to represent it in art. In 1919, they decided to make themselves into a group devoted to a distinct Canadian form of art which did not exist yet, and began to call themselves the Group of Seven. It is unknown who specifically chose these seven men, but it is believed to have been Harris or Harris in combination with MacDonald. By 1920, they were ready for their first exhibition thanks to the constant support and encouragement of Eric Brown, the director of the National Gallery at that time. Reviews for the 1920 exhibition were mixed, but as the decade progressed the Group came to be recognized as pioneers of a new, Canadian, school of art.

After Frank Johnston moved to Winnipeg in the fall of 1921, Percy James Robinson is claimed to have been invited to fill the open spot. Robinson participated in the group&#x27;s 3rd exhibition at the Art Gallery of Ontario. In 1926, A. J. Casson was invited to join. Franklin Carmichael had taken a liking to him and had encouraged Casson to sketch and paint for many years.
The Group&#x27;s champions during its early years included Barker Fairley, a co-founder of &quot;Canadian Forum&quot; magazine, and the warden of Hart House at the University of Toronto, J. Burgon Bickersteth.

The members of the Group began to travel elsewhere in Canada for inspiration, including British Columbia, Quebec, Nova Scotia, and the Arctic. After Samuel Gurney Cresswell and other painters on Royal Navy expeditions, these were the first artists of European descent who depicted the Arctic. Soon, the Group made the decision that to be called a &quot;national school of painters&quot; there should be members from outside Toronto. As a result, in 1930 Edwin Holgate from Montreal, Quebec became a member, followed by Lionel LeMoine FitzGerald from Winnipeg, Manitoba in 1932.

The Group&#x27;s influence was so widespread by the end of 1931, and after J. E. H. MacDonald&#x27;s death in 1932, they no longer found it necessary to continue as a group of painters. They announced that the Group had been disbanded and that a new association of painters would be formed, known as the Canadian Group of Painters. The Canadian Group — which eventually consisted of the majority of Canada&#x27;s leading artists — held its first exhibition in 1933, and continued to hold exhibitions almost every year as a successful society until 1967.

==Recognition==
On September 18, 1970, Canada Post issued &#x27;The Group of Seven&#x27;, designed by Allan Robb Fleming and based on a painting, &quot;Isles of Spruce&quot; (1922), by Arthur Lismer and held in the Hart House Permanent Collection, University of Toronto. The 6¢ stamps are perforated 11, and were printed by Ashton-Potter Limited.

On May 7, 2020, Canada Post honoured the centennial of the Group&#x27;s first exhibition, at the Art Gallery of Toronto (May 7, 1920), by issuing seven stamps, featuring paintings by each of the original members. The stamps were produced in a booklet of seven self-adhesives, and on a souvenir sheet of seven gummed stamps. First day ceremonies were cancelled, due to the Covid-19 pandemic, so designs were unveiled online on May 6, via the social media accounts of the postal service and several galleries across the country which own the works featured on the stamps:

* &quot;In the Nickel Belt&quot; (1928), by Franklin Carmichael
* &quot;Miners’ Houses, Glace Bay&quot; (circa 1925), by Lawren S. Harris
* &quot;Labrador Coast&quot; (1930), by A.Y. Jackson
* &quot;Fire-swept, Algoma&quot; (1920), by Frank H. Johnston
* &quot;Quebec Village&quot; (1926), by Arthur Lismer
* &quot;Church by the Sea&quot; (1924), by J.E.H. MacDonald
* &quot;Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay&quot; (1921), by F.H. Varley

In 2012–2013, the Royal Canadian Mint issued seven pure silver one-ounce coins, collectively reproducing one painting by each original member:

* F.H. Varley &quot;Stormy Weather, Georgian Bay&quot; (April 2012)
* Arthur Lismer &quot;Nova Scotia Fishing Village&quot; (July 2012)
* Franklin Carmichael &quot;Houses, Cobalt&quot; (October 2012)
* Lawren S. Harris &quot;Toronto Street, Winter Morning&quot; (January 2013)

==Legacy==
In 1966, the Legislative Assembly of Ontario incorporated the McMichael Canadian Art Collection, an art gallery with an institutional focus on the Group of Seven, along with &quot;their contemporaries and on the aboriginal peoples of Canada&quot;. In addition to housing a collection of works by the Group of Seven, the museum property also contains the burial ground for six members of the group, including A.Y. Jackson, Arthur Lismer, Frederick Varley, Lawren Harris, Frank Johnston, and A.J. Casson; along with four of the artists&#x27; wives. The McMichael cemetery is situated in a small patch of consecrated land bordered by trees, with graves marked by large chunks of the Canadian Shield. The idea to use the property as a burial ground for the group was first proposed to the institution by Jackson in 1968.

In 1995, the National Gallery of Canada compiled a Group of Seven retrospective show, for which they commissioned the Canadian rock band Rheostatics to write a musical score. That score was released on album as &quot;Music Inspired by the Group of Seven&quot;.

Shows of Group of Seven members or single paintings in some combination are a perennial favorite of the Canadian exhibition world, particularly of the National Gallery of Canada. Usually the Group is simply regarded as part of Canadian art history and explored in depth, as, for instance, for the centenary, the Kelowna Art Gallery in 2020 organized &quot;Northern Pine: Watercolours and Drawings by the Group of Seven from the McMichael Canadian Art Collection&quot; curated by Ian M. Thom. For the centenary as well, the National Gallery of Canada&#x27;s Philip Dombowsky of the Library and Archives at the Gallery organized a show titled &quot;Group of Seven: Graphic Design&quot;.

The Group of Seven has received criticism for reinforcing the concept of terra nullius by presenting the Canadian wilderness as pristine and untouched by humans, despite the fact that these areas had been lived in for centuries.

<text>The &quot;disadvantaged&quot; is a generic term for individuals or groups of people who:
* Face special problems such as physical or mental disability
* Lack money or economic support

==Economically disadvantaged==

In common usage &quot;the disadvantaged&quot; is a generic term for those &quot;from lower-income backgrounds&quot; or &quot;the Disadvantaged Poor&quot;.
The &quot;economically disadvantaged&quot; is a term used by government institutions in for example allocating free school meals to &quot;a student who is a member of a household that meets the income eligibility guidelines for free or reduced-price meals (less than or equal to 185% of US federal poverty guidelines)&quot; or business grants.

The &quot;disadvantaged&quot; is often applied in a third world context and typically relate to women with reduced &quot;upward mobility&quot; suffering social exclusion and having limited access to natural resources and economic opportunities. They are often landless or marginal farmers operating on the most unproductive land.

According to Paul Krugman in an October 2002 article titled &quot;about the distribution of wealth&quot;, there is even more of a divide between the classes today than in the 1920s, meaning that the disadvantaged are becoming more economically disadvantaged.

==Disadvantaged area==
Many governments use &quot;Disadvantaged area&quot; as a designation for various &quot;problem&quot; areas. In the UK &quot;disadvantaged area&quot; is a term used for an area where there is a need &quot;to stimulate the physical, economic and social regeneration&quot; by attracting development and encouraging the purchase of properties, in special provisions for Stamp Tax relief and for areas where health is an issue. In the United States the Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act allowed qualifying hospitals to employ temporary foreign workers as registered nurses.

<doc id="244877" wikidata="Q4878086" url="?curid=244877" title="Beaver Hall Group">
<text>The Beaver Hall Group refers to a Montreal-based group of Canadian painters who met in the late 1910s while studying art at a school run by the Art Association of Montreal.
The Group is notable for its equal inclusion of men and women artists, as well as for its embrace of Jazz Age modernism. They painted a variety of subjects, including portraits, landscapes, urban scenes and still lifes, in a mix of Modernist and traditional styles.

==Members==
The ten female artists who were part of the Beaver Hall Group are:
*Nora Collyer
*Emily Coonan
*Prudence Heward (Although she never showed in any of the group&#x27;s exhibitions and was not an official member, she was allied with them in her aesthetic aims and through friendships, including with Mabel Lockerby and Sarah Robertson.)
*Mabel Lockerby
*Mabel May
*Kathleen Morris
*Lilias Torrance Newton
*Sarah Robertson
*Anne Savage
*Ethel Seath
All ten of the group&#x27;s participants had studied under William Brymner (1855–1925), a prominent Canadian artist who encouraged them to explore new modernistic approaches to painting. In an era when women artists were viewed as little more than hobbyists and were left out of the mainstream world of professional art, the Beaver Hall Group was the first Canadian artists association in which women played a central role. Importantly, they not only painted but also exhibited and sold their work. Most of the women affiliated with the Beaver Hall Group chose to remain unmarried.

However, a touring exhibition at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts titled &quot;1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group&quot;, in 2015, co-curated by Brian Foss and Jacques Des Rochers, has changed the perception of the group to a new realization of the group&#x27;s activities and all its artist members or those who were closely associated with the group.

==History==

The group was formally founded in May 1920, inaugurated through the efforts of Randolph Stanley Hewton, Edwin Holgate, Mabel May and Lilias Torrance Newton. The group&#x27;s name derives from 305 Beaver Hall Hill, the location of the downtown Montreal studio where its members shared space. It counted among the founding members eleven men and eight women. In addition to Hewton, Holgate, May and Newton, original members included Mabel Lockerby, Anne Savage, Albert H. Robinson and President of the group, A.Y. Jackson.

The first Beaver Hall exhibition took place January 17, 1921. In his opening speech, Jackson emphasized the right of the artist to paint what they feel &quot;with utter disregard for what
has hitherto been considered requisite to the acceptance of the work at the recognized art exhibitions in Canadian centres. &#x27;Schools&#x27; and &#x27;isms&#x27; do not trouble us,&quot; Jackson stressed, &quot;individual expression is our chief concern&quot;. He identified its goals as being those of the Group of Seven, and over the years Jackson maintained the contact between Toronto and Montreal, supporting and stimulating the Montreal artists through regular visits and correspondence. He kept them informed of events in Toronto and arranged for their works to be included in the Group of Seven exhibitions. Both the &quot;Montreal Gazette&quot; and &quot;La Presse&quot; gave generous coverage to the vernissage.

The association only survived for three years, during which time they held only four exhibitions with many different artists exhibiting among them. In 1924, the Beaver Hall Group gave up their rented studio but maintained their working studios at home. Many of the women from the Beaver Hall Group exhibited with the all-male Group of Seven internationally. When the Group of Seven formally disbanded in 1932, the women of the Beaver Hall Group helped establish the Canadian Group of Painters in 1933, to provide exhibition opportunities. Nevertheless, Group artists maintained an informal association into the early 1960s.

The current understanding of the Beaver Hall Group as a group of Montreal-based women painters can be traced back to Norah McCullough&#x27;s (National Gallery of Canada liaison to Western Canada) 1966 traveling exhibition &quot;The Beaver Hall Hill Group&quot;. Until that time, the ten women who had continued their informal network after the disbanding of the formal Beaver Hall Group had not had a name for their association. McCollough&#x27;s aim was to expose the talent of Quebec&#x27;s women artists to western Canada. Anne Savage and A.Y. Jackson had told her about the original Beaver Hall Group and the name of the group became somehow confused with the name of the street, which is how the exhibition got its name.

More recently, curators have discovered a new dimension of Canadian modernism in the Beaver Hall Group. In contrast to the familiar modernist icons of the Toronto-based Group of Seven, the Montreal Beaver Hall painters were occupied with distinctly urban subjects: industry, fashion, and city life. Commenting on a recent exhibition, &quot;1920s Modernism in Montreal: The Beaver Hall Group&quot; at the Montreal Museum of Fine Arts, co-curator Brian Foss said, &quot;As fascinating and important as the Group of Seven was, it wasn&#x27;t the only word on Canadian Modernism. Hopefully visitors will be struck by the extraordinary vibrancy, diversity and sheer quality of the art, and will come away with enhanced admiration for the real contributions Montreal artists made to Modernist art in this country.&quot;

<text>A winter storm is an event in which wind coincides with varieties of precipitation that only occur at freezing temperatures, such as snow, mixed snow and rain, or freezing rain. In temperate continental and subarctic climates, these storms are not necessarily restricted to the winter season, but may occur in the late autumn and early spring as well. A snowstorm with strong winds and low visibility is called a blizzard.

== Formation ==
Winter storms are formed when moist air rises up into the atmosphere, creating low pressure near the ground and clouds up in the air. The air can also be pushed upwards by hills or large mountains. The upward motion is called lift. The moisture is collected by the wind from large bodies of water, such as a big lake or the ocean. If temperature is below freezing, , near the ground and up in the clouds, precipitation will fall as snow, ice, rain and snow mixed (sleet), ice pellets or even graupel (soft hail). Since cold air can not hold as much moisture as warm air, the total precipitation will be less than at higher temperature.

Winter storm warnings will be issued if:
* Snow accumulation is or more in 12 hours, or or more in 24 hours.
* Blowing snow is reducing visibility in large areas at winds less than .
* Ice accumulations on surfaces are or more.
* Ice pellets larger than are formed.
* Wind chill index is less than for more than 3 hours and sustained wind speed of at least .
Snowstorms with wind speed of more than and reduced visibility of less than for 3 hours or longer are called blizzards.

=== Terminology ===
Severe winter weather conditions called &quot;winter storms&quot;, can be local weather fulfilling the criteria for 24 hours, or large storm systems covering part of a continent for several days. With large, massive winter storms, weather in any part of the area covered by the extreme weather is usually called &quot;storm&quot;; even if meteorological criteria for winter storms are not met everywhere. An example of this is the February 13–17, 2021 North American winter storm with snowfall and below freezing temperatures as far south as Texas and the Gulf of Mexico.

== Snowstorm ==

Snowstorms are storms where large quantities of snow fall. of snow is enough to create serious disruptions to traffic and school transport (because of the difficulty to drive and manoeuvre the school buses on slick roads). This is particularly true in places where snowfall is not typical but heavy accumulating snowfalls can occur. In places where snowfall is typical, such small snowfalls are rarely disruptive, because of effective snow and ice removal by municipalities, increased use of four-wheel drive and snow tires, and drivers being more used to winter conditions. Snowfalls in excess of are usually universally disruptive.

A large number of severe snowstorms, some of which were blizzards, occurred in the United States during 1888 and 1947 as well as the early and mid-1990s. The snowfall of 1947 exceeded with drifts and snow piles from plowing that reached and for months as temperatures did not rise high enough to melt the snow. The 1993 &quot;Superstorm&quot; manifested as a blizzard in most of the affected areas.

Severe snowstorms could be quite dangerous: a snow depth will make some unplowed roads impassable, and it is possible for cars to get stuck in the snow. Snow depth exceeding especially in southern or generally warm climates will cave the roofs of some homes and cause loss of electricity. Standing dead trees can also be brought down by the weight of the snow, especially if it is wet. Even a few inches of dry snow can form drifts many feet high under windy conditions.

=== Hazards from snowfall ===

Accumulated snow can make driving motor vehicles very hazardous. Snow on roadways reduces friction between tires and the road surface, which in turn lowers the maneuverability of a vehicle considerably. As a result, average driving speeds on public roads and highways are reduced by up to 40% while heavy snow is falling. Visibility is reduced by falling snow, and this is further exacerbated by strong winds which are commonly associated with winter storms producing heavy snowfall. In extreme cases, this may lead to prolonged whiteout conditions in which visibility is reduced to only a few feet due to falling or blowing snow. These hazards can manifest even after snowfall has ended when strong winds are present, as these winds will pick up and transport fallen snow back onto roadways and reduce visibility in the process. This can even result in blizzard conditions if winds are strong enough. Heavy snowfall can immobilize a vehicle entirely, which may be deadly depending on how long it takes rescue crews to arrive. The clogging of a vehicle&#x27;s tailpipe by snow may lead to carbon monoxide buildup inside the cabin.
Depending on the temperature profile in the atmosphere, snow can be either &quot;wet&quot; or &quot;dry&quot;. Dry snow, being lighter, is transported by wind more easily and accumulates more efficiently. Wet snow is heavier due to the increased water content. Significant accumulations of heavy wet snow can cause roof damage. It also requires considerably more energy to move and this can create health problems while shoveling when combined with the harsh weather conditions. Numerous deaths as a result of heart attacks can be attributed to snow removal. Accretion of wet snow to elevated surfaces occurs when snow is &quot;sticky&quot; enough which can cause extensive tree and power line damage in a manner similar to ice accretion during ice storms. Power can be lost for days during a major winter storm, and this usually means the loss of heating inside buildings. Other than the obvious risk of hypothermia due to cold exposure, another deadly element associated with snowstorms is carbon monoxide poisoning which can happen anytime combustion products from generators or heating appliances are not properly vented. Partially or fully melted snow on roadways can refreeze when temperatures fall, creating black ice.

== Freezing rain ==


Heavy showers of freezing rain are one of the most dangerous types of winter storm. They typically occur when a layer of warm air hovers over a region, but the ambient temperature a few meters above the ground is near or below , and the ground temperature is sub-freezing.

While a snowfall is somewhat manageable by the standards of the northern United States and Canada, a comparable precipitation of an ice storm can paralyze a region; driving becomes extremely hazardous, telephone and power lines are damaged, and crops may be ruined.

=== Notable ice storms ===
Notable ice storms include an El Niño-related North American ice storm of 1998 that affected much of eastern Canada, including Montreal and Ottawa, as well as upstate New York and parts of upper New England. Three million people lost power, some for as long as six weeks. One-third of the trees in Montreal&#x27;s Mount Royal park were damaged, as well as a large proportion of the sugar-producing maple trees. The amount of economic damage caused by the storm has been estimated at $3 billion CAD.

* 2000 Christmas Day Ice Storm, caused devastating electrical issues in parts of Arkansas, Oklahoma, and Texas. The city of Texarkana, Arkansas experienced the worst damage, at one point losing the ability to use telephones, electricity and running water. In some areas in Arkansas, Oklahoma, Texas and eventually Louisiana, over of ice accumulated from the freezing rain.
* 2002 North Carolina ice storm, resulted in massive power loss throughout much of the state, and property damage due to falling trees. Except in the mountainous western part of the state, heavy snow and icy conditions are rare in North Carolina.
* 2005 December Ice Storm, was another severe winter storm producing extensive ice damage across a large portion of the Southern United States on December 14 to 16. It led to power outages and at least 7 deaths.
* 2005 January winter storm in Kansas, had been declared a major disaster zone by President George W. Bush after an ice storm caused nearly $39 million in damages to thirty-two counties. Federal funds were provided to the counties during January 4–6, 2005 to aid the recovery process.
* 2009 January Central Plains and Midwest ice storm, was a crippling and historic ice storm. Most places struck by the storm, saw or more of ice accumulation, and a few inches of snow on top of it. This brought down power lines, causing some people to go without electricity for a few days, to a few weeks. In some cases, electricity was out for a month or more. At the height of the storm, more than 2 million people were without electricity.
*2021 Winter Storm was the deadliest winter storm since the Blizzard of 1996 impacting most of the midwest and southcentral United States. The state of Texas gained notable publicity due to the failure of the state&#x27;s power grid, causing blackouts and power outages for 7–10 days across the state.

== Preparing for winter storms ==

In countries where winter storms can occur, governments and health organizations have websites and online services with advice about how to prepare for the consequences of severe weather. Advices vary with housing standards, infrastructure and safety regulations, but some tips are the same, such as: stock up on three days of food, water, medicines and hygiene items, keep warm clothes ready, keep a flashlight and extra batteries, stay informed, help each other, do not travel unless absolutely necessary.

<doc id="244879" wikidata="Q461990" url="?curid=244879" title="Mrs Patrick Campbell">
<text>Beatrice Rose Stella Tanner (9 February 1865 – 9 April 1940), better known by her stage name Mrs Patrick Campbell or Mrs Pat, was an English stage actress, best known for appearing in plays by Shakespeare, Shaw and Barrie. She also toured the United States and appeared briefly in films.

==Early life==
Campbell was born Beatrice Rose Stella Tanner in Kensington, London, to John Tanner (1829–1895), son and heir of a wealthy British Army contractor to the British East India Company, and Maria Luigia Giovanna (&quot;Louisa Joanna&quot;) née Romanini (1836–1908), daughter of Italian Count Angelo Romanini.

Her father John Tanner (1829–1895), a descendant of Thomas Tanner, Bishop of St Asaph, was a consul and merchant who &quot;managed to get through two large fortunes&quot;, in part through losses in the Indian Mutiny. Her mother, Louisa Joanna Romanini, was one of the eight daughters of Angelo Romanini of Brescia and Rosa née Polinelli of Milan. Angelo had joined the Carbonari and, as a result, had to leave Italy. He and his family travelled over Eastern Europe aided by a &quot;firman&quot; from the Sultan of Turkey. Six of his eight daughters, all under eighteen, married Englishmen.

She studied for a short time at the Guildhall School of Music.

==Stage career==


Campbell made her professional stage debut in 1888 at the Alexandra Theatre, Liverpool, four years after her marriage to Patrick Campbell. In March 1890, she appeared in London at the Adelphi, where she afterward played again in 1891–93. She became successful after starring in Sir Arthur Wing Pinero&#x27;s play, &quot;The Second Mrs Tanqueray&quot; (1893) at St. James&#x27;s Theatre where she also appeared in &quot;The Masqueraders&quot; (1894). She had another success as Kate Cloud in &quot;John-a-Dreams&quot; (1894), produced by Beerbohm Tree at the Haymarket, and again as Agnes in &quot;The Notorious Mrs. Ebbsmith&quot; (1895) at the Garrick.

Among her other performances were those in &quot;Fédora&quot; (1895), &quot;Little Eyolf&quot; (1896), and her notable performances with Forbes-Robertson at the Lyceum in London&#x27;s West End in the roles of Juliet in &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;, Ophelia in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, and Lady Macbeth (1895–98) in &quot;Macbeth&quot;. Once established as a major star, Campbell assisted in the early careers of some noted actors, such as Gerald Du Maurier and George Arliss.

In 1900, Campbell, having become her own manager/director, made her debut performance on Broadway in New York City in &quot;Heimat&quot; by Hermann Sudermann, a marked success. Subsequent appearances in New York and on tour in the U.S. established her as a major theatrical presence there. Campbell would regularly perform on the New York stage until 1933. Other performances included roles in &quot;The Joy of Living&quot; (1902), &quot;Pelléas et Mélisande&quot; (1904; as Melisande to the Pelleas of her friend Sarah Bernhardt), &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; (1907), &quot;Electra&quot;, &quot;The Thunderbolt&quot; (both 1908), and &quot;Bella Donna&quot; (1911).

In 1914, she played Eliza Doolittle in the original West End production of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, which George Bernard Shaw had expressly written for her. Although forty-nine years old when she originated the role opposite the Henry Higgins of Sir Herbert Beerbohm Tree, she triumphed and took the play to New York and on tour in 1915 with the much younger Philip Merivale playing Higgins. She successfully played Eliza again in a 1920 London revival of the play.

A couple of Campbell&#x27;s later significant performances were as the title role in the 1922 West End production of Henrik Ibsen&#x27;s play &quot;Hedda Gabler&quot; and Mrs. Alving in the 1928 Ibsen Centennial staging of &quot;Ghosts&quot; (with John Gielgud as her son Oswald). Her last major stage role was in the Broadway production of Ivor Novello&#x27;s play &quot;A Party&quot;, where she portrayed the cigar-smoking, Pekingese-wielding actress Mrs. MacDonald – a clear takeoff on her own well-known persona – and made off with the best reviews. In her later years, Campbell made notable appearances in films, including &quot;One More River&quot;, &quot;Riptide&quot; (both 1934), and &quot;Crime and Punishment&quot; (1935). Her tendency, however, to reject roles that could have vitally helped her career in later years caused Alexander Woollcott to declare &quot;... she was like a sinking ship firing on the rescuers&quot;.

==Relationship with George Bernard Shaw==
In the late 1890s, Campbell first became aware of George Bernard Shaw – the famous and feared dramatic critic for &quot;The Saturday Review&quot; – who lavishly praised her better performances and thoroughly criticised her lesser efforts. Shaw had already used her as inspiration for some of his plays before their first meeting in 1897 when he unsuccessfully tried to persuade Campbell to play the role of Judith Anderson in the first production of his play &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Disciple&quot;. Not until 1912, when they began negotiations for the London production of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, did Shaw develop an infatuation for Campbell that resulted in a passionate, yet unconsummated, love affair of mutual fascination and a legendary exchange of letters. It was Campbell who broke off the relationship, although Shaw was about to direct her in &quot;Pygmalion&quot;. They remained friends in spite of the break-up and her subsequent marriage to George Cornwallis-West, but Shaw never again allowed her to originate any of the roles he had written with her in mind (e.g. Hesione Hushabye in &quot;Heartbreak House&quot;, the Serpent in &quot;Back to Methuselah&quot;, etc.). When Anthony Asquith was preparing to produce the 1938 film of &quot;Pygmalion&quot;, Shaw suggested Campbell for the role of Mrs. Higgins, but she declined.

In later years, Shaw refused to allow the impoverished Campbell to publish or sell any of their letters except in heavily edited form, for fear of upsetting his wife Charlotte Payne-Townshend and the possible harm that the letters might cause to his public image. Most of the letters were not published until 1952, two years after Shaw&#x27;s death.

==Famous quotes==
Campbell was known for her sharp wit. Her best-known remark, uttered upon hearing about a male homosexual relationship, was &quot;My dear, I don&#x27;t care what they do, so long as they don&#x27;t do it in the street and frighten the horses&quot; (although this remark has been attributed to others as well).

At a dinner in the United States, she was seated next to a scientist who talked incessantly to her about ants. &quot;They even have their own police force and army&quot;, he enthused. &quot;No navy?&quot; she replied.

==Personal life==
In 1884, she eloped with Patrick Campbell (1855–1900) to St Helen, Bishopsgate, while pregnant with their child, Alan &quot;Beo&quot; Urquhart Campbell. Patrick was the son of Patrick McMicken Campbell, a banker and chief manager of the Oriental Bank Corporation, and Montgomerie Anne (née Kerr). They had first met four months prior at a card party at the house of Mrs. Gifford in Dulwich. Their second child, Stella Campbell, was born in 1886.

Patrick&#x27;s health was poor, and in 1887 he was ordered by his doctor to take a sea voyage. He went to Australia, and later to South Africa, staying for six-and-a-half years. He found some work but never sent enough back for Beatrice and the children to live on. When he returned in 1893, she saw that &quot;his health and energies were undermined by fever, failure, and the most bitter disappointments&quot;. In mid-March 1900, Patrick returned to South Africa to join Lord Chesham&#x27;s Yeomanry in the Boer War in 1900. He was killed in a charge at Boshof on 5 April, the same action in which Colonel George de Villebois-Mareuil died.

Their son Beo worked as an actor and toured with his mother in 1908. Their daughter Stella (1886–1975) also joined her mother onstage, and toured with her in the United States, but &quot;made up her mind to marry a man [Beatrice] scarcely knew, who had lived in Africa for many years&quot;.

In 1909, Campbell produced &quot;His Borrowed Plumes&quot; by Lady Randolph Churchill, whose husband, George Cornwallis-West, was &quot;seriously attracted to me&quot;. They married on 6 April 1914, the day after the decree absolute of his divorce. Notwithstanding her second marriage, she continued to use the stage name Mrs Patrick Campbell.

Campbell died on 9 April 1940 in Pau, France, aged 75, of pneumonia. Her death was one of the few deaths of a personal nature that George Bernard Shaw ever noted in his personal diaries.

==Legacy==
A note book belonging to Campbell is housed at the University of Birmingham Special Collections Department. Several collections of Campbell&#x27;s correspondence, including her letters to Shaw (MS Thr 372.1), are part of the Harvard Theatre Collection at Houghton Library, Harvard University. A number of her letters and her annotated script for Chester Bailey Fernald&#x27;s &quot;The Moonlight Blossom&quot; are in the theatre manuscripts collection of the Harry Ransom Center, University of Texas at Austin. The Ransom Center&#x27;s collection of Shaw papers includes letters from Campbell, and the library includes a number of Shaw&#x27;s published works from Campbell&#x27;s private library.

&quot;Mrs. Pat: The Life of Mrs. Pat Campbell&quot;, a biography by Margot Peters, was published in 1984 by Hamish Hamilton. Also London-based, play publisher Samuel French released &quot;Mrs. Pat&quot; in October 2015, the script of a one-woman show by Anton Burge, to coincide with its production in the Minerva Theatre at Chichester Festival Theatre, West Sussex. It was performed by Dame Penelope Keith DBE, DL.

In 1957, the play &quot;Dear Liar&quot; by Jerome Kilty, an adaptation of the epistolary exchanges between Campbell and Shaw, was first staged in Chicago. It has also been adapted for television and film.

<doc id="244884" wikidata="Q319417" url="?curid=244884" title="SQLite">
<text>SQLite (, ) is a free and open-source relational database engine written in the C programming language. It is not a standalone app; rather, it is a library that software developers embed in their apps. As such, it belongs to the family of embedded databases. It is the most widely deployed database engine, as it is used by several of the top web browsers, operating systems, mobile phones, and other embedded systems. 

Many programming languages have bindings to the SQLite library. It generally follows PostgreSQL syntax, but does not enforce type checking by default. This means that one can, for example, insert a string into a column defined as an integer. Although it is a lightweight embedded database, SQLite implements most of the SQL standard and the relational model, including transactions and ACID guarantees. However, it omits many features implemented by other databases, such as materialized views and complete support for triggers and ALTER TABLE statements.

==History==
D. Richard Hipp designed SQLite in the spring of 2000 while working for General Dynamics on contract with the United States Navy. Hipp was designing software used for a damage-control system aboard guided-missile destroyers; the damage-control system originally used HP-UX with an Informix database back-end. SQLite began as a Tcl extension.

In August 2000, version 1.0 of SQLite was released, with storage based on gdbm (GNU Database Manager). In September 2001, SQLite 2.0 replaced gdbm with a custom B-tree implementation, adding transaction capability. In June 2004, SQLite 3.0 added internationalization, manifest typing, and other major improvements, partially funded by America Online. In 2011, Hipp announced his plans to add a NoSQL interface to SQLite, as well as announcing UnQL, a functional superset of SQL designed for document-oriented databases.

In 2018, SQLite adopted a Code of Conduct because some clients would not use the software without one. It was based on the Rule of Saint Benedict and was controversial for its religious nature. The document was later renamed as a Code of Ethics.

SQLite is one of four formats recommended for long-term storage of datasets approved for use by the Library of Congress.

==Design==
SQLite was designed to allow the program to be operated without installing a database management system or requiring a database administrator. Unlike client–server database management systems, the SQLite engine has no standalone processes with which the application program communicates. Instead, a linker integrates the SQLite librarystatically or dynamicallyinto an application program which uses SQLite&#x27;s functionality through simple function calls, reducing latency in database operations; for simple queries with little concurrency, SQLite performance profits from avoiding the overhead of inter-process communication.

Due to the serverless design, SQLite applications require less configuration than client–server databases. SQLite is called &quot;zero-configuration&quot; because configuration tasks such as service management, startup scripts, and password- or GRANT-based access control are unnecessary. Access control is handled through the file-system permissions of the database file. Databases in client–server systems use file-system permissions that give access to the database files only to the daemon process, which handles its locks internally, allowing concurrent writes from several processes.

SQLite stores the entire database, consisting of definitions, tables, indices, and data, as a single cross-platform file, allowing several processes or threads to access the same database concurrently. It implements this simple design by locking the database file during writing. Write access may fail with an error code, or it can be retried until a configurable timeout expires. SQLite read operations can be multitasked, though due to the serverless design, writes can only be performed sequentially. This concurrent access restriction does not apply to temporary tables, and it is relaxed in version 3.7 as write-ahead logging (WAL) enables concurrent reads and writes. Since SQLite has to rely on file-system locks, it is not the preferred choice for write-intensive deployments.

SQLite uses PostgreSQL as a reference platform. &quot;What would PostgreSQL do&quot; is used to make sense of the SQL standard. One major deviation is that, with the exception of primary keys, SQLite does not enforce type checking; the type of a value is dynamic and not strictly constrained by the schema (although the schema will trigger a conversion when storing, if such a conversion is potentially reversible). SQLite strives to follow Postel&#x27;s rule.

==Features==
SQLite implements most of the SQL-92 standard for SQL, but lacks some features. For example, it only partially provides triggers and cannot write to views (however, it provides INSTEAD OF triggers that provide this functionality). Its support of ALTER TABLE statements is limited.

SQLite uses an unusual type system for an SQL-compatible DBMS: instead of assigning a type to a column as in most SQL database systems, types are assigned to individual values; in language terms it is &quot;dynamically typed&quot;. Moreover, it is &quot;weakly typed&quot; in some of the same ways that Perl is: one can insert a string into an integer column (although SQLite will try to convert the string to an integer first, if the column&#x27;s preferred type is integer). This adds flexibility to columns, especially when bound to a dynamically typed scripting language. However, the technique is not portable to other SQL products. A common criticism is that SQLite&#x27;s type system lacks the data integrity mechanism provided by statically typed columns, although it can be emulated with constraints like . In 2021, support for static typing was added through STRICT tables, which enforce datatype constraints for columns.

Tables normally include a hidden &quot;rowid&quot; index column, which provides faster access. If a table includes an INTEGER PRIMARY KEY column, SQLite will typically optimize it by treating it as an alias for the &quot;rowid&quot;, causing the contents to be stored as a strictly typed 64-bit signed integer and changing its behavior to be somewhat like an auto-incrementing column. SQLite includes an option to create a table without a rowid column, which can save disk space and improve lookup speed. WITHOUT ROWID tables are required to have a primary key.

SQLite supports foreign key constraints, although they are disabled by default and must be manually enabled with a PRAGMA statement.

Stored procedures are not supported; this is an explicit choice by the developers to favor simplicity, as the typical use case of SQLite is to be embedded inside a host application that can define its own procedures around the database.

SQLite does not have full Unicode support by default for backwards compatibility and due to the size of the Unicode tables, which are larger than the SQLite library. Full support for Unicode case-conversions can be enabled through an optional extension.

SQLite supports full-text search through its FTS5 loadable extension, which allows users to efficiently search for a keyword in a large number of documents similar to how search engines search webpages.

SQLite includes support for working with JSON through its &quot;json1&quot; extension, which is enabled by default since 2021. SQLite&#x27;s JSON functions can handle JSON5 syntax since 2023. In 2024, SQLite added support for JSONB, a binary serialization of SQLite&#x27;s internal representation of JSON. Using JSONB allows applications to avoid having to parse the JSON text each time it is processed and saves a small amount of disk space.

The maximum supported size for an SQLite database file is 281 terabytes.

==Development and distribution==
SQLite&#x27;s code is hosted with Fossil, a distributed version control system that uses SQLite as a local cache for its non-relational database format, and SQLite&#x27;s SQL as an implementation language.

SQLite is public domain, but not &quot;open-contribution&quot;, with the website stating &quot;the project does not accept patches from people who have not submitted an affidavit dedicating their contribution into the public domain.&quot; Instead of a code of conduct, the founders have adopted a code of ethics based on the Rule of St. Benedict. 

A standalone command-line shell program called &quot;sqlite3&quot; is provided in SQLite&#x27;s distribution. It can be used to create a database, define tables, insert and change rows, run queries and manage an SQLite database file. It also serves as an example for writing applications that use the SQLite library.

SQLite uses automated regression testing prior to each release. Over 2 million tests are run as part of a release&#x27;s verification. The SQLite library has 156,000 lines of source code, while all the test suites combined add up to 92 million lines of test code. SQLite&#x27;s tests simulate a number of exceptional scenarios, such as power loss and I/O errors, in addition to testing the library&#x27;s functionality. Starting with the August 10, 2009 release of SQLite 3.6.17, SQLite releases have 100% branch test coverage, one of the components of code coverage. SQLite has four different test harnesses: the original public-domain TCL tests, the proprietary C-language TH3 test suite, the SQL Logic Tests, which check SQLite against other SQL databases, and the dbsqlfuzz proprietary fuzzing engine.

* Mac OS X 10.4 onwards (Apple adopted it as an option in macOS&#x27;s Core Data API from the original implementation)
* Maemo
* MeeGo
* MorphOS 3.10 onwards
* NetBSD
* NixOS where it is used by the Nix core package management system
* Red Hat Enterprise Linux where it is used in the same way as Fedora, from which Red Hat Enterprise Linux is derived
* Solaris 10 where the Service Management Facility database is serialized for booting.
* Symbian OS

===Middleware===
* ADO.NET adapter, initially developed by Robert Simpson, is maintained jointly with the SQLite developers since April 2010.
* ODBC driver has been developed and is maintained separately by Christian Werner. Werner&#x27;s ODBC driver is the recommended connection method for accessing SQLite from OpenOffice.org.
* COM (ActiveX) wrapper making SQLite accessible on Windows to scripted languages such as JScript and VBScript. This adds SQLite database capabilities to HTML Applications (HTA).

===Web browsers===
* The browsers Google Chrome, Opera, Safari and the Android Browser all allow for storing information in, and retrieving it from, an SQLite database within the browser, using the official SQLite Wasm (WebAssembly) build, or using the Web SQL Database technology, although the latter is becoming deprecated (namely superseded by SQLite Wasm or by IndexedDB). Internally, these Chromium based browsers use SQLite databases for storing configuration data like site visit history, cookies, download history etc.
* Mozilla Firefox and Mozilla Thunderbird store a variety of configuration data (bookmarks, cookies, contacts etc.) in internally managed SQLite databases. Until Firefox version 57 (&quot;Firefox Quantum&quot;), there was a third-party add-on that used the API supporting this functionality to provide a user interface for managing arbitrary SQLite databases.
* Several third-party add-ons can make use of JavaScript APIs to manage SQLite databases.

===Web application frameworks===
* Symfony 
* Laravel
* Bugzilla
* Django&#x27;s default database management system
* Drupal
* Trac
* Ruby on Rails&#x27;s default database management system
* web2py
* Jam.py

===Others===
* Adobe Systems uses SQLite as its file format in Adobe Lightroom, a standard database in Adobe AIR, and internally within Adobe Reader.
* Apple Photos uses SQLite internally.
* Audacity uses SQLite as its file format, as of version 3.0.0.
* Evernote uses SQLite to store its local database repository in Windows.
* Skype
* The Service Management Facility, used for service management within the Solaris and OpenSolaris operating systems
* Flame (malware)
* BMW IDrive Sat Nav system
* TomTom GPS systems, for the NDS map data
* Proxmox VE - &quot;Proxmox Cluster File System&quot; (pmxcfs)

<text>Andrea is a given name which is common worldwide for both males and females, cognate to Andreas, Andrej and Andrew.

== Origin of the name ==

The name derives from the Greek word ἀνήρ (&quot;anēr&quot;), genitive ἀνδρός (&quot;andrós&quot;), that refers to man as opposed to woman (whereas &quot;man&quot; in the sense of &quot;human being&quot; is ἄνθρωπος, &quot;ánthropos&quot;). The original male Greek name, &quot;Andréas&quot;, represents the hypocoristic, with endearment functions, of male Greek names composed with the &quot;andr-&quot; prefix, like Androgeos (&quot;man of the earth&quot;), Androcles (&quot;man of glory&quot;), Andronikos (&quot;man of victory&quot;).

In the year 2006, it was the third most popular name in Italy with 3.1% of newborns. It is one of the Italian male names ending in &quot;a&quot;, with others being Elia (Elias), Enea (Aeneas), Luca (Lucas), Mattia (Matthias), Nicola (Nicholas), Tobia (Tobias). In recent and past times it has also been used on occasion as a female name in Italy and in Spain, where it is considered the legitimate feminine form of Andrés/Andreo/Andreu (Andrew). Outside of Italy, the name is generally considered a female name.

== Usage ==

* In Czech, Slovak, Polish, Slovenian, Dutch, English, French, German, Hungarian, Indonesian, Scandinavian languages and Spanish, &quot;Andrea&quot; is a feminine name. Masculine forms are Andrej, Ondřej, Andrzej, Anže, Andrew, Andreas, András, Andrey, Andreo, Andrés, Anders, Andries or Andre. However, many Swiss men regardless of first language are also named &quot;Andrea&quot;, if followed by a masculine middle name to comply with Swiss naming law.
* In Albanian &quot;Andrea&quot; is a masculine name; its native form is Ndrea.
* In Romansh &quot;Andrea&quot; is also a masculine name.
* In Italian, &quot;Andrea&quot; is a primarily masculine name. Nevertheless, some men of Italian descent, from countries where &quot;Andrea&quot; is feminine, bear the name.
* In Bulgarian Andrea (Андреа) is used as the feminine form of &quot;Andrei&quot;.
* In Croatia, Serbia and Slovenia, &quot;Andrea&quot; is a feminine name; &quot;Andreja&quot; can be used as female name, while &quot;Andrija&quot;, &quot;Andro&quot; and &quot;Andrej&quot; are masculine forms. The only exception is Istria, where Andrea is a male name.
* In Romania &quot;Andreea&quot; is a feminine name and it is written with an extra &quot;e&quot;. However, the feminine variation &quot;Andrea&quot; is also used. Andrea as etymon means &quot;knitting needle&quot; in Romanian. Andrei is the masculine form.
* &quot;Andréia&quot; is the most common Portuguese spelling of this name, although &quot;Andréa&quot; is also used in Brazilian Portuguese. The masculine form is André.
* In Dutch, &quot;Andrea&quot; is used as a female name, although the variant &quot;Andrée&quot; is found in French.
* In Spanish, &quot;Andrea&quot; and variations spelled &quot;Andreina&quot; and &quot;Andressa&quot; are used as female variants for &quot;Andrey&quot;, &quot;Andreo&quot;, and &quot;Andrés&quot;.
* In Basque, &quot;Andrea&quot; and &quot;Andere&quot; exist as female names. Two etymons merge in the former: the most widespread form with a Greek root, &#x27;man&#x27;, and the Basque-Aquitanian ancient form &quot;andere(a)&quot;, present-day &quot;andere(a)&quot; and &quot;andre(a)&quot;, &#x27;madam&#x27;, &#x27;lady&#x27; (used mainly as title, e.g. &quot;Andramari&quot;, &#x27;Lady/Virgin Mary&#x27;), as opposed to &quot;jaun&quot;, &#x27;lord&#x27;. In popular usage, it can ultimately mean &#x27;adult woman&#x27;.
* In Catalan, Andrea is used as the feminine form of &quot;Andreu&quot;.
* In Asturian, Andrea is the feminine form of &quot;Andrés&quot;.

<doc id="244892" wikidata="Q3778079" url="?curid=244892" title="Sinéad de Valera">
<text>Sinéad de Valera (; 3 June 1878 – 7 January 1975) was an Irish author of a number of children&#x27;s books in both Irish and English. She was married to Taoiseach and third president of Ireland, Éamon de Valera.

==Background==
She was born Jane O&#x27;Flanagan in Balbriggan, County Dublin. Her father, Laurence, was a carpenter and was a native of Kildare who moved to Balbriggan and married a local girl, Margaret Byrne. The couple emigrated to New York City, where their daughter Mary was born in 1871. The family returned to Balbriggan in 1873, and Sinéad was born there in 1878. She trained as a teacher and worked first in Edenderry, before taking up a post at a national school in Dorset Street, Dublin in around 1901. The 1901 census records her as &#x27;Jane Flanagan&#x27;, living with her parents and three siblings at 6 Richmond Cottages in Dublin.

==Marriage and children==
In her spare time, she taught Irish at the Leinster College of the Gaelic League in Parnell Square. One of her Irish students was Éamon de Valera, then a teacher of mathematics. On 8 January 1910, they were married. Together they had five sons, Vivion, Éamon, Brian, Rúaidhrí and Terence (Terry), and two daughters, Máirín and Emer. On 9 February 1936, Brian, then aged twenty, was killed in a riding accident in the Phoenix Park.

Due to a combination of his imprisonment, political activities, and fundraising tours of the United States, the family saw relatively little of Éamon de Valera in the 1916 to 1923 period. He was also away from home frequently during the early years of his political career. Sinéad de Valera played little or no public role during her husband&#x27;s fifty years in public life.

==Literary output==
Sinéad de Valera wrote thirty-one books for children, in both English and Irish.
Among her works were plays such as &quot;Cluichidhe na Gaedhilge&quot; (1935) and story collections such as &quot;The Emerald Ring and Other Irish Fairy Stories&quot; (1951), &quot;The Stolen Child and Other Stories&quot; (1961), &quot;The Four-leafed Shamrock&quot; (1964) and &quot;The Miser&#x27;s Gold&quot; (1970).

==Spouse of president==
Her husband was inaugurated as President of Ireland on 25 June 1959, two days after retiring as Taoiseach. They immediately took up residence at Áras an Uachtaráin. She remained unconvinced about her new role but conceded that &quot;she should be happy if only for [her husband’s] sake&quot;.

==Death==
Sinéad de Valera died on 7 January 1975, at the age of 96, the day before what would have been the de Valeras&#x27; sixty-fifth wedding anniversary. Éamon de Valera died just under eight months later, on 29 August 1975, aged 92. The couple are buried together, along with their son Brian, at Dublin&#x27;s Glasnevin Cemetery.

<doc id="244897" wikidata="Q650460" url="?curid=244897" title="Fanboys (film)">
<text>Fanboys is a 2009 American comedy film directed by Kyle Newman, and starring Dan Fogler, Jay Baruchel, Sam Huntington, Chris Marquette, and Kristen Bell. The story follows a group of &quot;Star Wars&quot; fans who head on a road trip to Skywalker Ranch to steal a rough cut of &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot; (1999) for their dying friend. The Weinstein Company released it in the United States on February 6, 2009.

Metacritic assessed the critical reception as &quot;mixed&quot;. Rotten Tomatoes, another aggregator, said it received negative reviews and called it &quot;undercooked [and] sporadically funny&quot;.

==Plot==

In 1998, Eric Bottler reunites with his old high school buddies Linus, Hutch, Windows, and Zoe at a Halloween party. Now a car salesman at his father&#x27;s dealership, Bottler finds that his friends have not matured since high school, though they all still share a love of &quot;Star Wars&quot;. The gang anticipates the latest film, &quot;Episode I: The Phantom Menace&quot;. Linus proposes Bottler and he infiltrate Skywalker Ranch and steal a rough cut of the film, a childhood plan that Bottler dismisses.

The next day, Hutch and Windows meet Bottler at work and inform him that Linus is dying from cancer. The doctors estimate he has roughly four months to live; &quot;Episode I&quot; comes out in six. To make peace with his former best friend, Bottler decides to go through with their plan. On the way to meet Rogue Leader, Windows&#x27; online girlfriend, for information on getting into the Ranch, Hutch takes a detour to pick a fight with a Trekkie, Admiral Seasholtz. When the boys&#x27; van breaks down, they stumble upon a gay biker bar. After refusing to pay for their drinks, they are forced to do a striptease. When this goes wrong, they are saved by a man named &quot;The Chief&quot;, who fixes their van after they pass out from eating guacamole laced with peyote. He gives a bag of this to Linus as a parting gift.

In Texas, Windows is horrified to find Rogue Leader is a 10-year-old girl. Her uncle, Harry Knowles, beats up Windows. After explaining their situation, Harry quizzes them to prove they are true fanboys, then gives them information on one of his contacts in Las Vegas. On their way there, they are arrested for fleeing from a police vehicle and for possession of peyote. Zoe arrives to bail them out and insists on accompanying them. Bottler is reluctant to continue when the judge relays an ultimatum from his father, but the others convince him of the importance of their quest. Once in Las Vegas, Hutch and Windows attempt to have sex with women while Bottler and Linus go to meet Harry&#x27;s contact. They are shocked to find that his contact is William Shatner. As they leave, they are attacked by Seasholtz and his Trekkie friends, who were attending a &quot;Star Trek&quot; convention. Hutch and Windows flee an angry pimp after finding out that they were with escort girls, and Windows learns that Zoe is in love with him.

The group escapes their adversaries, but Linus is injured in the process. When taken to the hospital, a doctor says he must return home for the sake of his health. When the group feels the situation has become hopeless, Bottler inspires them to continue, reminding them how much &quot;Star Wars&quot; means to them. The group leaves the hospital and eventually arrive at Skywalker Ranch. Shortly after breaking into the ranch and marveling at the collection of original props and costumes, they are discovered by security guards and are caught after a brief chase. The Head of Security tells them of their impending doom when he receives a phone call from George Lucas himself. Lucas says he will drop all charges if they can prove to him that they are &quot;fanboys&quot;. The five are individually quizzed, including questions about the opposite sex that only Zoe can answer. After the Head of Security confirms they are fanboys, Lucas drops all charges. Being aware of Linus&#x27;s illness, Lucas allows him to watch the film alone while his friends wait outside. After the film ends, Bottler joins his friends around a campfire and mends his friendship with Linus. Weeks later, Linus dies of his illness.

Bottler, Windows, and Zoe emerge from their tent while waiting in line for the premiere of &quot;Episode I&quot;. Bottler has followed his and Linus&#x27;s dream by becoming a comic book artist, Hutch has started his own detailing business, and Windows and Zoe are dating. Hutch arrives at the theater with beers he smuggled in, which they use to toast Linus&#x27;s memory. Before the film starts, Bottler comments &quot;What if the movie sucks?&quot;

==Production==

===Development===
After George Lucas was given an advance screening of the rough cut of the film, he enjoyed it and gave it his &quot;stamp of approval&quot;, and even offered the original &quot;Star Wars&quot; sound effects for use in the film. Filmmaker and &quot;Star Wars&quot; fan Kevin Smith also viewed an early version of the film and asked for (and was given) a cameo in the film.

The film was originally to be released on August 17, 2007 by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. The film was pushed back once more to January 2008 because director Kyle Newman was given more funding to shoot additional scenes that the original budget did not include. Getting the cast back together would only be possible in September 2007, thus the film&#x27;s release date had to be moved to 2008.

The film was again pushed back because the reshoots could not take place before November and December 2007. These reshoots were directed by Steven Brill and not by Newman. On January 14, The CineManiac reported that the film was being re-edited to remove the cancer plot from the film and replace much of it with raunchy, vulgar humor. Ain&#x27;t It Cool News picked up the story and confirmed that the two different versions of the film (with and without the cancer subplot) were screened to different test audiences in Burbank, California in January 2008 to see which one would rate higher. As for a new release date, Newman stated in a Movie Geeks United! interview that the film would hopefully come out in April 2008. Upon hearing about the changes being made to the film, an internet campaign was begun to protest the plot changes and demand that the original version with the cancer storyline be released in theaters.

Brill retaliated in a derogatory manner, calling fans &quot;losers&quot; in online correspondence which ended up released to the public. In one exchange, Brill called a fan &quot;dumb&quot; and threatened to &quot;hunt him down&quot; in a profanity-laden emailed response to a letter of complaint. In an interview Newman chastised Brill&#x27;s behavior, saying:

A rough cut of the full film (that included the cancer storyline) was shown in public for the first time at &quot;Star Wars Celebration Europe&quot; on July 14, 2007.

On July 9, 2008, Newman confirmed in a TheForce.net interview that the cancer plot would be included in the final cut of the film.

Newman was given just 36 hours to reassemble his film, and edit back in the key motivational cancer plotline.

The final cut of the film was screened on July 24, 2008 at San Diego Comic-Con. It was announced there that &quot;Fanboys&quot; would be released to theaters on September 19, 2008, but soon after, the official Weinstein Company website announced that this had changed to November 26, 2008. The final release date was finally pushed to February 6, 2009.

The Telegraph included the film in its list &quot;Harvey Scissorhands: 6 films ruined by Harvey Weinstein&quot;.

===Retrospective===
In a 2018 oral history of the film, members of the cast recalled feeling frustrated over the film&#x27;s reshoots, as well as the behavior of producer Harvey Weinstein and reshoot director Steve Brill during filming. Cline and Newman noted several of the raunchier scenes written by Adam F. Goldberg at Weinstein&#x27;s request remained in the final cut, including the scene at the gay bar, which Cline found homophobic even by the standards of when the film was released.

The cast and creatives voiced interest in making a sequel to &quot;Fanboys&quot;, but Cline noted its attachment to Weinstein, Spacey, and Knowles (who had all since been accused of sexual assault) made this unlikely. Cline also expressed interest in a directors&#x27; cut of the film that reflected his and Newman&#x27;s original vision.

On January 17, 2021 members of the Fanboys cast and crew had an online reunion-panel, as part of Dan Fogler&#x27;s &quot;Fogler&#x27;s Fiction Fest&quot; presented by Nerdbot. Director Kyle Newman, Jay Baruchel, Dan Fogler, Adam F. Goldberg, Chris Marquette and Sam Huntington were the ones present for the panel. During the event, cast and creatives once again expressed interest in a making a sequel.

==Release==

===Theatrical run and box office===
&quot;Fanboys&quot; was released on February 6, 2009 in eight US markets. The film expanded into 10 more cities on February 20, 2009, including a special screening in Columbus, Ohio that day, followed by a Q&amp;A session after the film with Kyle Newman, Ernie Cline, Matt Perniciaro and Kevin Mann. According to Cline&#x27;s pre-show speech, he wanted to hold a special screening with fans in his home state, since he grew up in nearby Ashland, Ohio, and the story was set in a fictional town of Shandal, OH...similar to Ashland.. (Shandal is an anagram of Ashland.)
The film expanded its release to seven more markets on February 27, 2009, to 13 more on March 13, 2009, and an additional 9 on March 20, 2009. On April 3, 2009, it was released in Canadian theaters. The film was also released on May 7, 2009 in Denmark and showed for approximately three weeks, it was released in Germany on July 30, 2009.

===Home media===
The DVD was released on May 19, 2009, the day of the 10th anniversary of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. The DVD and Blu-ray were also released in Canada on June 2, 2009.

The region 2 DVD was released on October 4, 2010.

==Critical reception==
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 32% based on 97 reviews and an average rating of 4.8/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads, &quot;This undercooked, sporadically funny road movie is a sop to &quot;Star Wars&quot; fanatics, but the uninitiated will find little to enjoy.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a rating of 45 out of 100 based on 24 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

Roger Ebert gave the film out of 4 stars, calling it &quot;an amiable but disjointed film that identifies too closely with its heroes. Poking a little more fun at them would have been a great idea.&quot; James Berardinelli gave it out of 4 stars, saying it was &quot;mostly a middling road picture that doesn&#x27;t do a lot more than any average, forgettable entry into the tired genre.&quot; Ben Lyons and Ben Mankiewicz of &quot;At the Movies&quot; recommended to &quot;Skip It&quot;. Lyons said, &quot;It was a great premise; it just unfortunately did not come together&quot;, and Mankiewicz commented that &quot;it devolves into nothing more than a silly road trip movie.&quot;

<text>Air Marshal William Avery Bishop, (8 February 1894 – 11 September 1956) was a Canadian flying ace of the First World War. He was officially credited with 72 victories, making him the top Canadian and British Empire ace of the war, and also received a Victoria Cross. During the Second World War, Bishop was instrumental in setting up and promoting the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan.

==Early life==
William Avery Bishop (commonly called Billy Bishop to distinguish him from his father) was born in Owen Sound, Ontario, on 8 February 1894, blond, blue-eyed, and weighing 11 pounds. He was the third of four children born to William Avery Bishop Sr. and Margaret Louisa (Green) Bishop. William Avery Bishop Sr. was a lawyer and graduate of Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto, Ontario. He was the Registrar of Grey County and was appointed to the post after backing the winning Liberal Party candidate in the national elections of 1896. He was consequential enough to be invited to a dinner for British dignitaries hosted by Prime Minister Sir Wilfrid Laurier.
Eldest brother Worth was ten years old when Billy arrived. His other brother, Kilbourn, was born in 1886, but died in 1893, the year before Billy&#x27;s birth. Sister Louise, to whom Billy became very close, was born in 1895, a year after him.

==School days== 
Young Billy Bishop grew up in the inland port city of Owen Sound on Georgian Bay, touted to be &quot;the next Liverpool&quot;. He was distinguished from the other children on several counts. He spoke with a slight lisp. Also, he was the only boy in town who attended classes at Miss Pearl&#x27;s Dancing School with the local girls. Add to that, his mother sent him to school in suit and tie; his schoolboy classmates scorned his formal dress and damaged his garb. Then too, he did not care for team sports like lacrosse, football, and hockey, preferring solitary sports, such as riding, swimming, or billiards at the YMCA or local pool halls. Most especially, he became a marksman. His father gave him a .22 caliber rifle for Christmas, along with a promise of 25 cents for every squirrel the youth shot. The family orchard, which had been overrun by a destructive plague of squirrels, was soon free of the beasts as the young sniper mastered the one-shot kill. Some sources insist that the young hunter learned the art of deflection shooting, the knack of leading a moving target, at this time.

Bishop attended Beech Street School (Dufferin Public School in 1910, now closed and home to M&#x27;Wikwedong Indigenous Friendship Centre) near his home and later at Owen Sound Collegiate Institute (at the 3rd Avenue East site and later at the now closed Strathcona Senior Public School).

Defending himself against teasing, Bishop earned the reputation of a fighter on the schoolyard, defending himself and others easily against bullies. Once, he fought seven boys, and won. And if he drew male antagonism, he had no problem attracting female company. He was slender and of average height, but undeniably handsome, with a firm jaw, full lips, and straight nose over a pencil moustache.

In the classroom, it was a different tale. Bishop was less successful at his studies; he would abandon any subject he could not easily master, and was often absent from class.

In 1910, at the age of 16, after reading a newspaper article, Bishop built a glider out of cardboard, wooden crates, bedsheets, and twine, and made an attempt to fly off the roof of his three-story house. He was dug, unharmed, out of the wreckage by his sister Louise. After she helped him hide the wreckage, she insisted he owed her a favor, and insisted he date her girlfriend Margaret Burden.

The granddaughter of Timothy Eaton, the department store magnate, Margaret Burden had become friends with Louise Bishop during summer vacations to Owen Sound. Once she met Billy, they were smitten with one another, which greatly annoyed her parents.

==College==

On his 17th birthday, 8 February 1911, Billy Bishop applied to the Royal Military College of Canada (RMC) in Kingston, Ontario, where his brother Worth had graduated in 1903. Bishop placed 42nd of the 43 candidates admitted to the three-year school. He spent a hard first year during 1911 and 1912, struggling academically. He also suffered severe hazing from seniors; RMC regulations barred him from retaliatory fisticuffs. Then he was caught cheating on a year-end exam, and narrowly avoided expulsion. Too humiliated to return home for the summer, he stayed in Kingston and worked for Worth. Bishop was readmitted to the RMC as a second year student for the 1912–1913 term, though with an extra year&#x27;s study added for him to graduate. That year, he raised his class standing to 23rd of 42 students.

During the 1913–1914 term, Bishop&#x27;s class standing sagged to 33rd of 34. On 28 August 1914, he returned to RMC as a senior. After 15 of Bishop&#x27;s classmates left school to serve as officers in the burgeoning war, Bishop withdrew from the RMC on 30 September 1914 with the same intention. That same day, he was commissioned into a cavalry unit, the Mississauga Horse. He journeyed to Toronto to inform Margaret Burden of his decision before reporting for duty.

==First World War==

===Mud and manure===
When The Mississauga Horse shipped out for the war, Second Lieutenant Bishop was not with them; he was in hospital with pneumonia and allergies. After recovering, he was transferred to the 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles, a mounted infantry unit, then stationed in London, Ontario, in January 1915. Bishop was placed in charge of the regimental machine guns. Popular with the enlisted men, Bishop was nicknamed &quot;Bish&quot; and &quot;Billy&quot;. He excelled on the firing range. As one of his subordinates remembered:
&quot;Bish would just riddle a target that the rest of us could barely see. The instructors would keep putting it further back, until it was just a tiny black dot, and he&#x27;d shoot it to ribbons...he put every damn&#x27; bullet on target. He never missed.&quot;
Mishap continued to dog Bishop. On 6 April 1915, a horse he was riding reared and fell on him; he was back riding a week later. At the end of the month, the bolt of a rifle he was firing blew back and whacked him on the cheekbone. Then he became so ill from an inoculation that he fell off his horse. It was during this time that Bishop slipped away to Ontario, and proposed marriage to Margaret Burden. She accepted, and they were engaged. He gave her his RMC ring as a symbol of his troth.

Bishop&#x27;s unit left Canada for England on 6 June 1915 on board the requisitioned cattle ship &quot;Caledonia&quot; as part of a convoy. The voyage through rough seas was poor on food. Most of the 240 men and 600 horses on board were seasick. From time to time, the ship&#x27;s crew chucked dead horses overboard. On 21 June, near Ireland, U-boats attacked the convoy. Three ships were sunk and 300 Canadians killed, but Bishop&#x27;s ship arrived unscathed in Plymouth harbour on 23 June.

The 7th Canadian Mounted Rifles were assigned to train at Shorncliffe Cavalry Camp in outmoded cavalry tactics. Living in tents, the Canadians suffered through sandstorms when it was dry; usually, though, they lived in a rainy swamp of mud and horse manure. Bishop spent more time in hospital in late July. Afterwards, during one especially mucky day, Bishop watched an aeroplane land in a nearby field. He remarked to his companion, &quot;You don&#x27;t get any mud or horseshit on you up there. If you died, it would be a clean death.&quot; Bishop decided to apply for a transfer.

===Into the air===
On a jaunt to London, Bishop subsequently wrangled an appointment with the Royal Flying Corps recruitment officer, Lord Hugh Cecil. When Bishop was told it would be a year before he could train as a pilot, he accepted the immediate chance to become an aerial observer. On 1 September, he reported to 21 (Training) Squadron at Netheravon for elementary air instruction. The first aircraft he trained in was the Avro 504. Having taken a month for preliminary training, on 2 October 1915 Bishop transferred to gunnery training at Dover. By the end of October, Bishop was crossing the English Channel and flying his first missions in a combat zone, directing artillery fire. On 24 November, Bishop&#x27;s pilot crashed their airplane upon landing back in England. Bishop suffered a bruised foot; the pilot was also only bruised. Three days later, Bishop took a check ride in a new aircraft. When he wrote home to Margaret describing this flight, he boasted of a 300 mph (400 km) dive in an aircraft that could not have exceeded half that. Such braggadocio characterized his correspondence with her.

No. 21 Squadron was re-equipped with new Royal Aircraft Factory RE.7s. On 15 January 1916, No. 21 Squadron began its transfer to France. By 23 January, as the squadron established itself at Boisdinghem, Bishop began a three-day illness. He emerged from hospital to join his squadron in adjusting to the realities of the infant military science of aerial warfare. Until this time, fliers on both sides of the conflict had been fumbling their way towards mounting firearms on aircraft. When Bishop emerged from hospital, there were already reports of German Fokker Eindecker monoplanes that could fire a machine gun through their propeller arc without striking a blade. Aim the aircraft; aim the gun. As the deadly little Fokkers slowly multiplied on the front, they became feared by the Royal Flying Corps as the Fokker Scourge. In response, the RFC quit single plane patrols, mandating two escorts for every reconnaissance aircraft. However, casualties were rare, and dismissed airily. One of Bishop&#x27;s letters to his fiancée mentioned that the German fliers were chivalrous; the two sides exchanged dropped messages on the occasional casualty. Bishop wrote: &quot;It is awfully nice to be on such good terms with one&#x27;s enemies, and everyone here speaks very highly of all the German flyers. They seem to all be of a fine crowd.&quot;

Meanwhile, No. 21 Squadron RFC was discovering that their underpowered RE.7s could not take flight with a bomb load, and so failed as a bomber. The awkward crew positioning also hindered its fighting ability, with the observer in front with a non-synchronized Lewis gun hemmed in by struts and bracing wires. The pilot was seated behind him, back under the upper wing.

The rest of Bishop&#x27;s time as an observer was a string of mishaps. Weather aloft was arctic bitter. A three and a half hour flight on 9 February 1916 frostbit his cheek so severely it burst open and put him back under medical care. In March, he was injured in a vehicle collision. Then he was hit in the head by an aircraft cable; he spent two days unconscious. This was followed by an abscessed tooth. Once returned to duty, he whacked a knee against an aircraft&#x27;s frame when his pilot pulled a hard landing.

Bishop was then granted a three-week leave to England. As he strode down the gangplank at Folkestone on 2 May 1916, he stumbled and fell onto his sore knee. Three other soldiers behind him toppled over him to compound his injury. Resolved not to miss his holiday, Bishop limped through his leave. Just before he returned to France, he turned himself in to have his knee treated at the hospital at Bryanston Square. Once hospitalized, he was informed on 26 May that he would face a medical board to determine his further fitness for service. After Bishop awakened from a nap, he found a well-dressed elderly woman at his bedside. Lady St. Helier insisted she knew his father from a reception in Canada, and thus was a family friend. Lady St. Helier was widely known for both her wide circle of influential friends, and for her charitable tendencies. The latter attribute had brought her to the hospital. Now she used her influence to remove Bishop from hospital and install him as one of her guests in her four-story mansion, where he mingled with, and charmed, her influential social circle.

After Bishop faced a medical board, he was sent back to Canada to recuperate on home leave. In four months of aerial combat, he had not fired his machine gun at the enemy. However, he received local acclaim in Owen Sound for his service. Then too, the Burdens overcame their objections to Bishop&#x27;s suit, and agreed to their daughter&#x27;s official engagement. She was presented with an actual engagement ring.

===Aerial combat===
Bishop returned to England in September 1916, and, with the influence of St Helier, was accepted for training as a pilot at the Central Flying School at Upavon on Salisbury Plain. His first solo flight was in a Maurice Farman &quot;Shorthorn&quot;.

In November 1916 after receiving his wings, Bishop was attached to No. 37 Squadron RFC at Stow Maries, Essex, flying the BE.2c. He was officially appointed to flying officer duties on 8 December 1916. Bishop disliked flying at night over London, searching for German airships, and he soon requested a transfer to France.
On 17 March 1917, Bishop arrived at 60 Squadron at Filescamp Farm near Arras, where he flew the Nieuport 17 fighter. At that time, the average life expectancy of a new pilot in that sector was 11 days, and German aces were shooting down British aircraft 5 to 1. Bishop&#x27;s first patrol on 22 March was less than successful. He had trouble controlling his run-down aircraft, was nearly shot down by anti-aircraft fire, and became separated from his group. On 24 March, after crash-landing his aircraft during a practice flight in front of General John Higgins, Bishop was ordered to return to flight school at Upavon. Major Alan Scott, the new commander of 60 Squadron, convinced Higgins to let him stay until a replacement arrived.

The next day, Bishop claimed his first victory when his was one of four Nieuports that engaged three Albatros D.III Scouts near St Leger. Bishop shot down and mortally wounded a Lieutenant Theiller, but his engine failed in the process. Bishop landed in no man&#x27;s land, from the German front line. After running to the Allied trenches, Bishop spent the night on the ground in a rainstorm. There Bishop wrote a letter home, starting, &quot;I am writing this from a dugout 300 yards from our front line, after the most exciting adventure of my life.&quot; General Higgins personally congratulated Bishop and rescinded his order to return to flight school.

On 30 March 1917, Bishop was named a flight commander with a temporary promotion to captain a few days later. On 31 March, he scored his second victory. Bishop, in addition to the usual patrols with his squadron comrades, soon flew many unofficial &quot;lone-wolf&quot; missions deep into enemy territory, with the blessing of Major Scott. As a result, his total of enemy aircraft shot down increased rapidly. On 8 April, he scored his fifth victory and became an ace. To celebrate, Bishop&#x27;s mechanic painted the aircraft&#x27;s nose blue, the mark of an ace. Former 60 Squadron member Captain Albert Ball, at that time the Empire&#x27;s highest scoring ace, had had a red spinner fitted.

Bishop&#x27;s no-holds-barred style of flying always had him &quot;at the front of the pack,&quot; leading his pilots into battle over hostile territory. Bishop soon realized that this could eventually see him shot down; after one patrol, a mechanic counted 210 bullet holes in his aircraft. His new method of using the surprise attack proved successful; he claimed 12 aircraft in April alone, winning the Military Cross for his participation in the Battle of Vimy Ridge. The successes of Bishop and his blue-nosed aircraft were noticed by the Germans, and they began referring to him as &quot;Hell&#x27;s Handmaiden&quot;. Ernst Udet called him &quot;the greatest English scouting ace&quot; and one &quot;Jasta&quot; had a bounty on his head.

On 30 April, Bishop survived an encounter with &quot;Jasta 11&quot; and Manfred von Richthofen, the Red Baron. In May, Bishop received the Distinguished Service Order for shooting down two aircraft while being attacked by four others.

On 2 June 1917, Bishop flew a solo mission behind enemy lines to attack a German-held aerodrome, where he claimed that he shot down three aircraft that were taking off to attack him and destroyed several more on the ground. For this feat, he was awarded the Victoria Cross (VC), although it has been suggested that he may have embellished his success, most notably by historian, Brereton Greenhous, in his 2002 book &quot;The Making of Billy Bishop&quot;. His VC (awarded 30 August 1917) was one of two awarded in violation of the warrant requiring witnesses (the other being the Unknown Soldier), and since the German records have been lost and the archived papers relating to the VC were lost as well, there is no way of confirming whether there were any witnesses. It seems to have been common practice at this time to allow Bishop to claim victories without requiring confirmation or verification from other witnesses.

In July, 60 Squadron received new Royal Aircraft Factory S.E.5s, a faster and more powerful aircraft with better pilot visibility. In August 1917, Bishop passed the late Albert Ball in victories to become (temporarily) the highest scoring ace in the RFC and the third top ace of the war, behind only the Red Baron and René Fonck.

At the end of August 1917, Bishop was appointed as the Chief Instructor at the School of Aerial Gunnery and given the temporary rank of major.

===Leave to Canada===
Bishop returned home on leave to Canada in fall 1917, where he was acclaimed a hero and helped boost the morale of the Canadian public, who were growing tired of the war. On 17 October 1917, Bishop married his longtime fiancée, Margaret Eaton Burden. After the wedding, he was assigned to the British War Mission in Washington, D.C. to help the Americans build an air force. While stationed there, he wrote his autobiography entitled &quot;Winged Warfare&quot;.

===Return to Europe===
Upon his return to England in April 1918, Bishop was promoted to major and given command of No. 85 Squadron, the &quot;Flying Foxes&quot;. This was a newly formed squadron, and Bishop was given the freedom to choose many of the pilots. The squadron was equipped with S.E.5a scout planes and left for Petit Synthe, France, on 22 May 1918. On 27 May, after familiarizing himself with the area and the opposition, Bishop took a solo flight to the Front. He downed a German observation plane in his first combat since August 1917, and followed with two more the next day. From 30 May to 1 June, Bishop downed six more aircraft, including German ace Paul Billik, bringing his score to 59 and reclaiming his top scoring ace title from James McCudden, who had claimed it while Bishop was in Canada, and he was now the leading Allied ace.

The Government of Canada was becoming increasingly worried about the effect on morale if Bishop were to be killed, so on 18 June he was ordered to return to England to help organize the new Canadian Flying Corps. Bishop was not pleased with the order coming so soon after his return to France. He wrote to his wife: &quot;This is ever so annoying.&quot; The order specified that he was to leave France by noon on 19 June. On that morning, Bishop decided to fly one last solo patrol. In just 15 minutes of combat, he added another five victories to his total. He claimed to have downed two Pfalz D.IIIa scout planes, caused another two to collide with each other, and shot down a German reconnaissance aircraft.

On 5 August, Bishop was promoted to lieutenant-colonel and was given the post of &quot;Officer Commanding-designate of the Canadian Air Force Section of the General Staff, Headquarters Overseas Military Forces of Canada.&quot; He was on board a ship returning from a reporting visit to Canada when news of the armistice arrived. Bishop was discharged from the Canadian Expeditionary Force on 31 December and returned to Canada.

By the end of the war, he had claimed some 72 air victories, including two balloons, 52 and two shared &quot;destroyed&quot; with 16 &quot;out of control&quot;. Historians including Hugh Halliday and Brereton Greenhous (both of whom were official historians for the Royal Canadian Air Force) suggested that the actual total was far lower. Brereton Greenhous felt the actual total of enemy aircraft destroyed was only 27.

==Post-war career==
After the war, Bishop toured the principal cities in the United States and lectured on aerial warfare. He established an importing firm, Interallied Aircraft Corporation, and a short-lived passenger air service with fellow ace William Barker, but after legal and financial problems, and a serious crash, the partnership and company were dissolved. In 1921, Bishop and his family moved to Britain, where he had various business interests connected with flying. In 1928, he was the guest of honour at a gathering of German air aces in Berlin and was made an Honorary Member of the Association. In 1929 he became chairman of British Air Lines. However, the family&#x27;s wealth was wiped out in the crash of 1929 and they had to move back to Canada, where he became vice-president of the McColl-Frontenac Oil Company.

===Second World War===

In January 1936, Bishop was appointed the first Canadian air vice-marshal. Shortly after the outbreak of war in 1939, he was promoted to the rank of air marshal in the Royal Canadian Air Force. In January 1940 he was appointed Director of Recruiting for the Royal Canadian Air Force. He was so successful in this role that many applicants had to be turned away. Bishop created a system for training pilots across Canada and became instrumental in setting up and promoting the British Commonwealth Air Training Plan, which trained over 167,000 airmen in Canada during the Second World War. In 1942, he appeared as himself in the film &quot;Captains of the Clouds&quot;, a Hollywood tribute to the RCAF.

By 1944 the stress of the war had taken a serious toll on Bishop&#x27;s health, and he resigned his post in the RCAF to return to private enterprise in Montreal, Quebec, before retiring in 1952. His son later commented that he looked 70 years old on his 50th birthday in 1944. However, Bishop remained active in the aviation world, predicting the phenomenal growth of commercial aviation postwar. His efforts to bring some organization to the nascent field led to the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in Montreal. He wrote a second book at this time, &quot;Winged Peace&quot;, advocating international control of global air power.

With the outbreak of the Korean War, Bishop again offered to return to his recruitment role, but he was in poor health and was politely refused by the RCAF. He died in his sleep on 11 September 1956, at the age of 62, while wintering in Palm Beach, Florida. His funeral service was held with full Air Force Honours in Toronto, Ontario. The body was cremated and the ashes interred in the family plot in Greenwood Cemetery, Owen Sound, Ontario. A memorial service for Air Marshal Bishop was held in St Paul&#x27;s Church, Bristol, England, on 19 September 1956.

==Family==
On 17 October 1917, at Timothy Eaton Memorial Church in Toronto he married Margaret Eaton Burden, his longtime fiancée and daughter of Mr C. E. Burden (a granddaughter of Timothy Eaton and sister of ace Henry John Burden). They had a son, William, and a daughter, Margaret.

Both of the Bishop children became aviators:
* William Arthur Christian Avery Bishop (1923 London, England – 2013 Toronto) was presented with his wings by his father during the Second World War; Arthur would go on to become a Spitfire pilot and served with No. 401 Squadron RCAF in 1944. After the war, he became a journalist, advertising executive, entrepreneur and author. He married Priscilla (Cilla) Jean Aylen and had two children (Diana and William)
* Margaret Marise (Jackie) Willis-O’Connor (1926 London – 2013 Ottawa) was a wireless radio operator during World War II, whom Bishop presented with a Wireless Sparks Badge in 1944.

==Honours and tributes==

===Official citations===

Bishop&#x27;s decorations include the Victoria Cross, Distinguished Service Order &amp; Bar, Military Cross, Distinguished Flying Cross, légion d&#x27;honneur and the Croix de Guerre with palm. He was made a Companion of the Order of the Bath in the King&#x27;s Birthday Honours List of 1 June 1944.

====Victoria Cross====
The citation for his VC, published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot; on 11 August 1917, read:
====Distinguished Flying Cross====
His citation for the Distinguished Flying Cross read:
 A most successful and fearless fighter in the air, whose acts of outstanding bravery have already been recognised by the awards of the Victoria Cross, Distinguished Service Order, Bar to the Distinguished Service Order, and Military Cross. For the award of the Distinguished Flying Cross now conferred upon him he has rendered signally valuable services in personally destroying twenty-five enemy machines in twelve days—five of which he destroyed on the last day of his service at the front. The total number of machines destroyed by this distinguished officer is seventy-two, and his value as a moral factor to the Royal Air Force cannot be overestimated.

====Distinguished Service Order====
His citation for the Distinguished Service Order read:
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty. While in a single-seater he attacked three hostile machines, two of which he brought down, although in the meantime he was himself attacked by four other hostile machines. His courage and determination have set a fine example to others.

====Distinguished Service Order Bar====
His citation for the Distinguished Service Order bar read:
For conspicuous gallantry and devotion to duty when engaging hostile aircraft. His consistent dash and great fearlessness have set a magnificent example to the pilots of his squadron. He has destroyed no less than 45 hostile machines within the past 5 months, frequently attacking enemy formations single-handed, and on all occasions displaying a fighting spirit and determination to get to close quarter with his opponents which have earned the admiration of all in contact with him.

===Other tributes===
Bishop also holds a number of non-military awards. In 1967, Bishop was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame. An award is also named in honour of Bishop. The Air Force Association of Canada approved the establishment of a trophy to commemorate the late Air Marshal W.A. Bishop, VC, in recognition of his &quot;outstanding contribution to the legacy of excellence in Canadian aviation&quot;.

Billy Bishop&#x27;s childhood home was re-purposed into the Billy Bishop Home and Museum in 1987. The museum is in Owen Sound, Ontario. The museum has exhibits on the family, Bishop himself and veterans. There is a permanent exhibit with information on Bishop at the Grey Roots Museum and Archives, just south of Owen Sound.

Bishop&#x27;s life has also been the subject of a number of works in media. &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot; feature film and Canadian musical, written by John MacLachlan Gray in collaboration with the actor Eric Peterson in 1978. &quot;A Hero to Me: The Billy Bishop Story – WW1 Canadian flying Ace&quot;, a documentary depicting the story of &quot;Billy&quot; Bishop from the perspective of his granddaughter Diana, was produced for Global Television and TVO in 2003.

In addition to television and film, Bishop has also been featured on Canadian stamps. On 12 August 1994, Canada Post issued &quot;Billy Bishop, Air Ace&quot; as part of the Great Canadians series. The stamps were designed by Pierre Fontaine, based on illustrations by Bernard Leduc. The 43¢ stamps are perforated 13.5 and were printed by Canadian Bank Note Company, Limited.

Several places also have honoured Bishop by bearing his namesake. Two airports in Ontario are named after Bishop. The airport in Owen Sound is officially named &quot;Owen Sound Billy Bishop Regional Airport.&quot; Toronto&#x27;s island airport was renamed Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport in 2009. Although Owen Sound&#x27;s mayor questioned the change, the proposal was approved by the Toronto Port Authority on 10 November 2009. Having two airports in the province with similar names was a concern. Toronto&#x27;s Pearson International Airport was originally named &quot;Bishop Field Toronto Airport Malton.&quot;

Other forms in which Bishop is memorialized includes:
* &quot;Billy Bishop Private&quot; is a roadway on private land at Ottawa Airport, Ottawa, Ontario, where the &quot;Billy Bishop Room&quot; for visiting dignitaries also exists.
* &quot;Billy Bishop Way&quot; is a street near the Downsview Airport in Toronto, Ontario.

==Legacy and later controversy==
Bishop&#x27;s life was depicted in the 1978 Canadian play &quot;Billy Bishop Goes to War&quot;. It also led indirectly to a 1983 CBC Television documentary called &quot;The Kid Who Couldn&#x27;t Miss&quot;, produced by the National Film Board of Canada. The show, a &quot;docudrama&quot; combining known history for credibility with fictitious &quot;mock interviews&quot; with actors portraying Bishop and others, suggested that Bishop faked his famous attack on the German aerodrome. In one particularly contentious scene, his mechanic claims that the damage to his fighter was confined to a small circle in a non-critical area, implying that Bishop had landed his aircraft off-field, shot holes in it, and flown home with claims of combat damage.

In reality, his mechanic was his biggest supporter, and the scene was entirely fictitious. The mechanic insisted that Bishop had not fabricated the damage. Canadian authors Dan McCaffery and David Bashow also presented circumstantial evidence that Bishop did not fake the attack.

After years of controversy over Bishop&#x27;s record, mainly because very few of his claimed victories were witnessed by anyone else or could be confirmed from the few surviving German records, the show led to an inquiry by the Canadian government in 1985. The Standing Senate Committee on Social Affairs, Science and Technology discredited the documentary, saying it was an unfair and inaccurate portrayal of Bishop. There is some dispute about whether Bishop or Mick Mannock had the highest score of any British Empire First World War fighter ace. The &quot;Canadian Encyclopedia&quot; states: &quot;Investigation by a Senate sub-committee exposed a number of minor errors in this apparent &#x27;documentary&#x27; and confirmed that statements had been wrongly attributed and incidents shifted in time for dramatic effect. However, the senators were unable to demonstrate that Bishop&#x27;s claims were valid, and consequently recommended only that the film be labelled as docu-drama&quot;.

Some of Bishop&#x27;s other claims have also been challenged. While combat reports and claims of both sides are littered with well-intentioned errors and accidental duplicate claims, there are two phases of Bishop&#x27;s life in which German records can provide no supporting evidence. In his book on Victoria Cross airmen of the First World War, author Alex Revell quotes aviation historian Philip Markham&#x27;s view about German records of the events of 2 June 1917 (the day of Bishop&#x27;s VC award): &quot;Not a shred of evidence to support Bishop&#x27;s claims.&quot; Referring to Bishop&#x27;s claims in early to mid-1918, Revell says another aviation historian, Ed Ferko, carried out extensive research on Germans records in 1987. Revell says that Ferko failed &quot;to match a single victory claim made by Bishop against a known German loss for the day, time or place in question.&quot; However, distinguished First World War aviation historian Peter Kilduff says in his biography (Billy Bishop VC: Lone Wolf Hunter) that Bishop may have had as many as 21 matches in piecemeal German records. Kilduff also makes a case for the unreliability of German records. He cites examples in which masses of data were destroyed by retreating German forces and instances of the German former air ministry having been guilty of &quot;obfuscation&quot; in denying losses when casualties had been incurred.

<text>Pastor Gong Shengliang (龚圣亮) is the founder and leader of the South China Church, an evangelical house-church fellowship that claimed 50,000 members across several Chinese provinces including Hubei. In December 2001, he was convicted and sentenced to death under China&#x27;s anti-cult legislation. Responding to international pressure, China commuted his sentence to life imprisonment for assault and rape charges. In 2006, his prison sentence was further reduced to 19 years. According to his relatives, Gong was tortured and beaten severely during his incarceration, also by fellow prisoners.

== Religious persecution ==
He was sentenced to death in 2001, but because of international pressure, the sentence was reduced to life. Some who testified against Gong later stated that they were tortured into doing so by Communist officials. Liu Xianzhi, a former leader in the South China Church, has sought asylum in the United States and gives extensive testimony on the details of Pastor Gong Shengliang&#x27;s case. There are also reports that he has been beaten and mistreated in prison. Over several weeks in late May and early June 2003, it was reported that he lapsed in and out of a coma and was bleeding internally, and that he nearly died from a savage beating in prison in June 2003.

In 2013 Pastor Shengliang&#x27;s daughter in an open letter to Xi Jinping, General Secretary of the Chinese Communist Party, asked for his help. According to her, her father had not received medical treatment over the past ten years. His condition is now life-threatening. A heart attack at the end of 2012 left him unable to walk or speak. His daughter is asking for his release to receive urgent medical treatment.

<doc id="244905" wikidata="Q26538" url="?curid=244905" title="Lauraceae">
<text>Lauraceae, or the laurels, is a plant family that includes the true laurel and its closest relatives. This family comprises about 2850 known species in about 45 genera worldwide. They are dicotyledons, and occur mainly in warm temperate and tropical regions, especially Southeast Asia and South America. Many are aromatic evergreen trees or shrubs, but some, such as &quot;Sassafras&quot;, are deciduous, or include both deciduous and evergreen trees and shrubs, especially in tropical and temperate climates. The genus &quot;Cassytha&quot; is unique in the Lauraceae in that its members are parasitic vines. Most laurels are highly poisonous. 

==Overview==
The family has a worldwide distribution in tropical and warm climates. The Lauraceae are important components of tropical forests ranging from low-lying to montane. In several forested regions, Lauraceae are among the top five families in terms of the number of species present.

The Lauraceae give their name to habitats known as laurel forests, which have many trees that superficially resemble the Lauraceae, though they may belong to other plant families such as Magnoliaceae or Myrtaceae. Laurel forests of various types occur on most continents and on many major islands.

Although the taxonomy of the Lauraceae is still not settled, conservative estimates suggest some 52 genera worldwide, including 3,000 to 3,500 species. Compared to other plant families, the taxonomy of Lauraceae still is poorly understood. This is partly due to its great diversity, the difficulty of identifying the species, and partly because of inadequate investment in taxonomic work.

Recent monographs on small and medium-sized genera of Lauraceae (up to about 100 species) have revealed many new species. Similar increases in the numbers of species recognised in other larger genera are to be expected.

==Description==
Most of the Lauraceae are evergreen trees in habit. Exceptions include some two dozen species of &quot;Cassytha&quot;, all of which are obligately parasitic vines.

The fruits of Lauraceae are drupes, one-seeded fleshy fruit with a hard layer, the endocarp, surrounding the seed. However, the endocarp is very thin, so the fruit resemble a one-seeded berry. The fruit in some species (particularly in the genera &quot;Ocotea&quot;) are partly immersed or covered in a cup-shaped or deep thick cupule, which is formed from the tube of the calyx where the peduncle joins the fruit; this gives the fruit an appearance similar to an acorn. In some &quot;Lindera&quot; species, the fruit have a hypocarpium at the base of the fruit.

==Distribution and uses==
Because the family is so ancient and was so widely distributed on the Gondwana supercontinent, modern species commonly occur in relict populations isolated by geographical barriers, for instance on islands or tropical mountains. Relict forests retain endemic fauna and flora in communities of great value in inferring the palaeontological succession and climate change that followed the breakups of the supercontinents.

*Many Lauraceae contain high concentrations of essential oils, some of which are valued for spices and perfumes. Within the plants, most such substances are components of irritant or toxic sap or tissues that repel or poison many herbivorous or parasitic organisms.
*Some of the essential oils are valued as fragrances, such as in the traditional laurel wreath of classical antiquity, or in cabinet making, where the fragrant woods are prized for making insect-repellant furniture chests.
*Some are valued in cooking, for example, bay leaves are a popular ingredient in European, American, and Asian cuisines.
*Avocados are important oil-rich fruit that are cultivated in warm climates around the world.
*Many species are exploited for timber.
*Some species are valued as sources of medicinal material.

These genera include some of the best-known species of particular commercial value:
*&quot;Cinnamomum&quot;: cinnamon (&quot;Cinnamonum verum&quot;) and cassia (&quot;Cinnamomum cassia&quot;)
*&quot;Camphora&quot;: camphor tree (&quot;Camphora officinarum&quot;)
*&quot;Laurus&quot;: bay laurel (&quot;Laurus nobilis&quot;)
*&quot;Persea&quot;: avocado (&quot;Persea americana&quot;)

Loss of habitat and overexploitation for such products has put many species in danger of extinction as a result of overcutting, extensive illegal logging, and habitat conversion.

Conversely, some species, though commercially valuable in some countries, are regarded as aggressive invaders in other regions. For example, &quot;Cinnamomum camphora&quot;, though a valued ornamental and medicinal plant, is so invasive as to have been declared a weed in subtropical forested areas of South Africa.

==Ecology==

Lauraceae flowers are protogynous, often with a complex flowering system to prevent inbreeding. The fruits are an important food source for birds, on which some Palaeognathae are highly dependent. Other birds that rely heavily on the fruit for their diets include members of the families Cotingidae, Columbidae, Trogonidae, Turdidae, and Ramphastidae, amongst others. Birds that are specialised frugivores tend to eat the whole fruit and regurgitate seeds intact, thereby releasing the seeds in favourable situations for germination (ornithochory). Some other birds that swallow the fruit pass the seed intact through their guts.

Seed dispersal of various species in the family is also carried out by monkeys, arboreal rodents, porcupines, opossums, and fishes. Hydrochory occurs in &quot;Caryodaphnopsis&quot;.

The leaves of some species in the Lauraceae have domatia in the axils of their veins. The domatia are home to certain mites. Other lauraceous species, members of the genus &quot;Pleurothyrium&quot; in particular, have a symbiotic relationship with ants that protect and defend the tree. Some &quot;Ocotea&quot; species are also used as nesting sites by ants, which may live in leaf pockets or in hollowed-out stems.

Defense mechanisms that occur among members of the Lauraceae include irritant or toxic sap or tissues that repel or poison many herbivorous organisms.

Trees of the family predominate in the world&#x27;s laurel forests and cloud forests, which occur in tropical to mild temperate regions of both northern and southern hemispheres. Other members of the family however, occur pantropically in general lowland and Afromontane forest, and in Africa for example there are species endemic to countries such as Cameroon, Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda and Congo. Several relict species in the Lauraceae occur in temperate areas of both hemispheres. Many botanical species in other families have similar foliage to the Lauraceae due to convergent evolution, and forests of such plants are called laurel forest. These plants are adapted to high rainfall and humidity, and have leaves with a generous layer of wax, making them glossy in appearance, and a narrow, pointed-oval shape with a &#x27;drip tip&#x27;, which permits the leaves to shed water despite the humidity, allowing transpiration to continue. Scientific names similar to &quot;Daphne&quot; (e.g., &quot;Daphnidium&quot;, &quot;Daphniphyllum&quot;) or &quot;laurel&quot; (e.g.,&quot;Laureliopsis&quot;, &quot;Skimmia laureola&quot;) indicate other plant families that resemble Lauraceae.

Some Lauraceae species have adapted to demanding conditions in semiarid climates, but they tend to depend on favorable edaphic conditions, for example, perennial aquifers, periodic groundwater flows, or periodically flooded forests in sand that contains hardly any nutrients. Various species have adapted to swampy conditions by growing pneumatophores, roots that grow upward, that project above the levels of periodic floods that drown competing plants which lack such adaptations.

Paleobotanists have suggested the family originated some 174±32 million years ago (Mya), while others do not believe they are older than the mid-Cretaceous. Fossil flowers attributed to this family occur in Cenomanian clays (mid-Cretaceous, 90-98 Mya) of the Eastern United States (&quot;Mauldinia mirabilis&quot;). Fossils of Lauraceae are common in the Tertiary strata of Europe and North America, but they virtually disappeared from central Europe in the Late Miocene. Because of their unusual fragility, the pollens of Lauraceae do not keep well and have been found only in relatively recent strata.

Deciduous Lauraceae lose all of their leaves for part of the year depending on variations in rainfall. The leaf loss coincides with the dry season in tropical, subtropical, and arid regions.

Laurel wilt disease, caused by the virulent fungal pathogen &quot;Raffaelea lauricola&quot;, a native of southern Asia, was found in the southeast United States in 2002. The fungus spreads between hosts via a wood-boring beetle, &quot;Xyleborus glabratus&quot;, with which it has a symbiotic relationship. Several Lauraceae species are affected. The beetle and disease are believed to have arrived in the US via infected solid wood packing material, and have since spread to several states.

==Classification==
Classification within the Lauraceae is not fully resolved. Multiple classification schemes based on a variety of morphological and anatomical characteristics have been proposed, but none are fully accepted. According to Judd et al. (2007), the suprageneric classification proposed by van der Werff and Richter (1996) is currently the authority. However, due to an array of molecular and embryological evidence that disagrees with the groupings, it is not fully accepted by the scientific community. Their classification is based on inflorescence structure and wood and bark anatomy. It divides Lauraceae into two subfamilies, Cassythoideae and Lauroideae. The Cassythoideae comprise a single genus, &quot;Cassytha&quot;, and are defined by their herbaceous, parasitic habit. The Lauroideae are then divided into three tribes: Laureae, Perseeae, and Cryptocaryeae.

The subfamily Cassythoideae is not fully supported. Backing has come from &quot;matK&quot; sequences of chloroplast genes while a questionable placement of &quot;Cassytha&quot; has been concluded from analysis of intergenetic spacers of chloroplast and nuclear genomes. Embryological studies also appear contradictory. One study by Heo et al. (1998) supports the subfamily. It found that &quot;Cassytha&quot; develops an &quot;ab initio&quot; cellular-type endosperm and the rest of the family (with one exception) develops a nuclear-type endosperm. Kimoto et al. (2006) suggest &quot;Cassytha&quot; should be placed in the tribe Cryptocaryeae because it shares a glandular anther tapetum and an embryo sac protruding from the nucellus with other members of the Cryptocaryeae.

The tribes Laureae and Perseeae are not well supported by any molecular or embryological studies. Sequences of the &quot;matK&quot; chloroplast gene, as well as sequences of chloroplast and nuclear genomes, reveal close relationships between the two tribes. Embryological evidence does not support a clear division between the two tribes, either. Genera such as &quot;Caryodaphnopsis&quot; and &quot;Aspidostemon&quot; that share embryological characteristics with one tribe and wood and bark characteristics or inflorescence characteristics with another tribe blur the division of these groups. All available evidence, except for inflorescence morphology and wood and bark anatomy, fails to support separate tribes Laureae and Perseeae.

The tribe Cryptocaryeae is partially supported by molecular and embryological studies. Chloroplast and nuclear genomes support a tribal grouping that contains all the genera circumscribed by van der Weff and Richter (1996), as well as three additional genera. Partial support for the tribe is also attained from the &quot;matK&quot; sequences of chloroplast genes as well as embryology.

Challenges in Lauraceae classification

The knowledge of the species comprising the Lauraceae is incomplete. In 1991, about 25-30% of neotropical Lauraceae species had not been described. In 2001, embryological studies had only been completed on individuals from 26 genera yielding a 38.9% level of knowledge, in terms of embryology, for this family. Additionally, the huge amount of variation within the family poses a major challenge for developing a reliable classification.

==Phytochemistry==
The adaptation of Lauraceae to new environments has followed a long evolutionary journey which has led to many specializations, including defensive or deterrent systems against other organisms.

Phytochemicals in the Lauraceae are numerous and diverse. Benzylisoquinoline alkaloids include aporphines and oxoaporphines, as well as derivatives of morphinans. Essential oils include terpenoids, benzyl benzoates, allylphenols, and propenylphenols. Lignans and neolignans are present, along with &quot;S&quot;-methyl-5-O-flavonoids, proanthocyanidins, cinnamoylamides, phenylpyrroles, styryl pyrones, polyketides (acetogenins), furanosesquiterpenes, and germacranolidous, heliangolidous, eudesmanolidous and guaianolidous sesquiterpene lactones.

==Genera==
Recent taxonomic revisions of the family include these genera:

These genera have traditionally been considered separate within Lauraceae, but have not been included in the most recent treatments:
== Popular culture ==

A laurel wreath, a round or horseshoe-shaped wreath made of connected laurel branches and leaves, is an ancient symbol of triumph in classical Western culture originating in Greek mythology, and is associated in some countries with academic or literary achievement.

<doc id="244907" wikidata="Q1475511" url="?curid=244907" title="USS Oliver Hazard Perry">
<text>USS &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; (FFG-7) was the lead ship of the of guided-missile frigates. She was named for Oliver Hazard Perry, an American naval hero who was victorious at the 1813 Battle of Lake Erie. &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; (FFG-7) was the first ship and, as of 2019, the only ship of the U.S. Navy to bear the name (although there were five previous US Navy ships named for Oliver Hazard Perry – four named USS Perry and one named USS Commodore Perry). &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; was in service from 1977 to 1997 and was scrapped in 2005.

The class was originally intended as austere &quot;low&quot; category guided missile frigates (compared with the high capability ) for General Purpose and Anti-Air convoy escort. They were built under a cloud of controversy, with their very light gun armament and lack of redundancy and duplicated systems in event of ship being hit. They were regarded by the Reagan administration and Secretary John Lehman as not part of the 500 ship navy plan, but ultimately proved useful as anti-submarine ships if fitted to carry Seahawks and towed arrays and into the 21st Century as low grade patrol ships making up the numbers in a USN desperately short of escorts.

== Construction and career ==
&quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; was ordered from Bath Iron Works on 30 October 1973 as part of the FY73 program, and was laid down on 12 June 1975, launched on 25 September 1976, and commissioned on 17 December 1977. She was ordered as PFG-109 but was redesignated as FFG-7 in the 1975 fleet designation realignment on 1 June 1975, before she was laid down.

=== Launch incident ===
During her launch ceremony on 25 September 1976, the ship found herself briefly stuck on the slip-way. Film star John Wayne appeared from the crowd of watching dignitaries, climbed the launch ceremony platform, and gave the bow of the frigate – which was by this time starting to move slightly – a shove with one hand, and so John Wayne famously appeared to have &#x27;pushed&#x27; a US warship down her slip-way.

=== Shock Trial Testing ===
&quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; was one of the few lead ships to be subjected to shock trials. These series of trials conducted early in the life of the ship put this steel hull / aluminum superstructure to the test. The proximity of the tests (seen in associated pictures), caused many of the machine mounts and components to become warped or damaged. This damage created alignment problems for the engineering and combat systems teams in the years to come. The ship regularly required waivers on machine performance due to the warping of many mounting brackets. The shock tests also created cracks in the aluminum superstructure that required frequent repairs. However, this did not affect the overall readiness of the ship, nor did it prevent &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; from achieving the record for the most-ever hours put on the GE LM2500 Main Propulsion engine.

=== Fate ===
After 19.2 years of active service, &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; was decommissioned on 20 February 1997, in Mayport, FL. Though she was stricken on 3 May 1999, &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; was held in the museum donation category at the former Navy shipyard in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. A group had hoped to bring her to Toledo, Ohio as a museum ship and a memorial for the Battle of Lake Erie. The group was unable submit a viable financial plan together in time so the &quot;Perry&quot; was sold for scrap in December 2005.

<text>Joshua Daniel Hartnett (born July 21, 1978) is an American actor. He began his career on ABC&#x27;s drama series &quot;Cracker&quot; (1997–1998), after which he became known as a teen idol through starring parts in films such as &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot;, &quot;The Faculty&quot; (both 1998), &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;, &quot;O&quot;, &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (all 2001), and &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot; (2002).

Hartnett continued to work steadily throughout the 2000s, with a mix of leading and supporting roles in &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; (2003), &quot;Wicker Park&quot; (2004), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot; (both 2006), &quot;30 Days of Night&quot; (2007), &quot;August&quot; (2008), and &quot;I Come with the Rain&quot; (2009). He experienced a career resurgence with his roles as Ernest Lawrence in &quot;Oppenheimer&quot; (2023) and a serial killer in &quot;Trap&quot; (2024).

On television, Hartnett portrayed Ethan Chandler on the Showtime fantasy series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot; (2014–2016). He also appeared in an episode of &quot;Black Mirror&quot; in 2023 and &quot;The Bear&quot; in 2024.

== Early life and education ==
Hartnett was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota. The son of Daniel Thomas Hartnett and Wendy Anne (née Kronstedt), he was raised by his father, a building manager and former guitarist for Al Green, and his stepmother, Molly, an artist. He has three younger siblings named Jake, Joe, and Jessica. Hartnett was raised Roman Catholic, attending Nativity of Our Lord Catholic School. At Minneapolis South High School, he played football, but a knee injury forced him off the team when he was 16. He went on to try youth theater, where he acted in productions of &quot;The Adventures of Tom Sawyer&quot; and &quot;Guys and Dolls&quot; and attracted attention from a talent scout. Originally interested in becoming a painter, he decided to become a film actor while working in a video rental shop, where he became acquainted with films such as &quot;Trainspotting&quot;, &quot;12 Monkeys&quot;, and &quot;The Usual Suspects&quot;.

After Hartnett graduated from high school in 1996, he moved to Purchase, New York, to attend the Conservatory of Theatre Arts &amp; Film at the State University of New York at Purchase. He was expelled after writing a letter to the dean contending that the college&#x27;s evaluation system stifled students&#x27; creativity. At the age of 19, Hartnett moved to Los Angeles at the recommendation of his manager, Nancy Kremer, who had previously helped him book television commercials.

== Career ==
Shortly after arriving in Los Angeles, he caught an improbable break, landing a part in the short-lived drama series &quot;Cracker&quot; on ABC. His first feature film was &quot;Halloween H20: 20 Years Later&quot;, in which he played the son of character Laurie Strode. Released on August 5, 1998, it performed well at the box office.

Hartnett then developed a successful film career, appearing in the major films &quot;The Faculty&quot; (1998), &quot;The Virgin Suicides&quot; (1999), and &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot; (2001). In 2001, he starred in the war drama &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. He was originally scheduled to play the role of Tino in &quot;Deuces Wild&quot;, but dropped out to star in &quot;Pearl Harbor&quot;. Also in 2001, he starred in &quot;O&quot;, an adaptation of William Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Othello&quot; set in an American high school, as Hugo, the film&#x27;s version of Iago. In 2002, he starred in the romantic comedy &quot;40 Days and 40 Nights&quot;. 

In the early 2000s, Hartnett was approached several times to play the role of Clark Kent / Superman for a project originally helmed by Brett Ratner but always turned it down, not wanting to commit to a predicted ten-year role. Hartnett said of his decision, &quot;It just wasn&#x27;t the kind of movie I wanted to do. I turned down other superhero roles as well.&quot; He was also considered for, but not offered, the role of Batman in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Batman Begins&quot;, which ultimately went to Christian Bale&quot;.&quot;

Hartnett was chosen as one of &quot;Teen People&quot;″s &quot;21 Hottest Stars Under 21&quot; in 1999, &quot;Teen People&quot;″s &quot;25 Hottest Stars under 25&quot;, and one of &quot;People&quot;″s &quot;50 Most Beautiful People&quot;, both in 2002. He was also voted &quot;Bliss&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;3rd Sexiest Male&quot;. During this period, he was marketed as a teen idol and a potential megastar; his unease with this public image eventually led to his disillusionment with pursuing roles in high-profile films.

Hartnett&#x27;s next films included &quot;Hollywood Homicide&quot; (2003), &quot;Wicker Park&quot; (2004), &quot;Mozart and the Whale&quot; (2005), &quot;Sin City&quot; (2005), and &quot;Lucky Number Slevin&quot; (2006). He followed up these roles with the 2006 drama-mystery &quot;The Black Dahlia&quot;, in which he played a detective investigating the notorious real-life murder of waitress Elizabeth Short. Hartnett had been cast in the role five years before the film was produced, remaining committed to appearing in the movie because he liked the subject matter.

Among his 2007 roles were &quot;Resurrecting the Champ&quot; and the graphic novel-based &quot;30 Days of Night&quot;, in which he played a small-town sheriff. Hartnett described the second film as &quot;supernatural, but kind of a western&quot;. He was going to play trumpet player Chet Baker in the film &quot;The Prince of Cool&quot; but did not agree with the producer&#x27;s ideas and left the project.

In 2008, Hartnett played Charlie Babbit in the theater adaptation of Barry Morrow&#x27;s Academy Award-winning &quot;Rain Man&quot; at the Apollo Theatre in London&#x27;s West End. He starred in the new campaign of the Emporio Armani fragrance, &quot;Diamonds for Men&quot;, being featured in both print and TV ads for the fragrance, thus becoming the first male celebrity to represent Giorgio Armani Beauty. He has been featured on many magazine covers, such as &quot;Cosmogirl&quot;, &quot;Details&quot;, &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, &quot;Girlfriend&quot;, &quot;Seventeen&quot;, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot;, &quot;GQ&quot; and &quot;Vman&quot;, in addition to being in other magazines like &quot;Vogue&quot;, &quot;Elle&quot;, &quot;People&quot;, &quot;Glamour&quot;, &quot;In Touch&quot; and &quot;InStyle&quot;.

In 2009, Hartnett produced the music video for the rapper Kid Cudi&#x27;s song &quot;Pursuit of Happiness&quot;. During this time, Hartnett acted in several direct-to-DVD films and international films which received negative reviews, such as the drama &quot;August&quot; (2008), the thriller &quot;I Come with the Rain&quot; (2009), the martial arts action film &quot;Bunraku&quot; (2010), the comedy film &quot;Girl Walks into a Bar&quot; (2011), the romantic comedy &quot;Stuck Between Stations&quot; (2011), the time travel adventure film &quot;The Lovers&quot; (2013), the romantic drama &quot;Parts per Billion&quot; (2014), and &quot;Wild Horses&quot; (2015). In 2013, Hartnett was a guest of honor on Off Plus Camera.

In 2014, he was cast in the part of Ethan Chandler in the Gothic horror series &quot;Penny Dreadful&quot;, which was shot in locations around Dublin and Ireland. Later, Hartnett&#x27;s character was revealed to be Lawrence Talbot / the Wolfman, who had changed his name to distance himself from his family. In 2017, he performed in Atsuko Hirayanagi&#x27;s critically acclaimed independent film &quot;Oh Lucy!&quot; (2017), which premiered at the Cannes Film Festival. That same year, he starred in and produced the survival film &quot;6 Below: Miracle on the Mountain&quot;, which received negative reviews. He then continued acting in smaller films which were received negatively, such as the Turkish war film &quot;The Ottoman Lieutenant&quot; (2017), the drama &quot;She&#x27;s Missing&quot; (2019), the crime film &quot;Inherit the Viper&quot; (2019), the Polish film &quot;Valley of the Gods&quot; (2019), and the crime film &quot;Ida Red&quot; (2021). 

In 2020, he portrayed Canadian journalist Victor Malarek in the crime drama &quot;Target Number One&quot;. Hartnett then starred in Guy Ritchie&#x27;s 2021 revenge drama film &quot;Wrath of Man&quot; in a supporting role before Ritchie cast him in his 2023 film &quot;Operation Fortune: Ruse de Guerre&quot;. In January 2022, Hartnett was cast as Ernest Lawrence in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s film &quot;Oppenheimer&quot;. In July 2022, he joined the sixth season of &quot;Black Mirror&quot;.

In 2024, he starred in M. Night Shyamalan&#x27;s thriller film &quot;Trap&quot; where he played Cooper Abbott, a serial killer, known as &quot;the Butcher&quot;. Also in 2024, he appeared in the third season of &quot;The Bear&quot;, where he portrayed Frank. In December 2024, he was cast as Jeremy in the movie adaptation of Colleen Hoover&#x27;s novel &quot;Verity&quot;. 

In 2025, Hartnett will star in action film &quot;Fight or Flight&quot;, playing a mercenary tracking a target on a plane.

==Activism==
Hartnett has been involved in various causes. In 2007, he took time out from filming to support the green lifestyle campaign of Global Cool.

In 2011, Hartnett became one of a handful of celebrities attached to USAID and Ad Council&#x27;s FWD campaign, an awareness initiative tied to that year&#x27;s East Africa drought. He joined Uma Thurman, Chanel Iman and Geena Davis in TV and Internet ads to &quot;forward the facts&quot; about the crisis.

In 2012, Hartnett also joined Barack Obama in his campaign in Minnesota, appearing at such events as the Minnesota Greater Together Youth Summit before formally endorsing the President on the official campaign YouTube channel. He along with Minneapolis Mayor RT Rybak also appeared at the University of Minnesota&#x27;s McNamara Alumni Center for an Obama Q&amp;A in April.

==Personal life==
Hartnett began a relationship with English actress Tamsin Egerton in 2012. They have a daughter (born 2015), a second child (born 2017), and a third child (born 2019). In 2022, he revealed he had married Egerton in November 2021. They reside in the Surrey–Sussex border region, in southeast England. In 2024, he shared that he and Egerton had a fourth child.

Regarding fame, Hartnett has said: &quot;I know what it&#x27;s like to be in that whole world. I was up there for a couple of years, and it was uncomfortable. I think trying to stay at the top is a shortcut to unhappiness.&quot; Hartnett took a 15-month break from acting, saying: &quot;I spent a bit of time really thinking about whether this was the right thing for me.&quot;

<text>USS &quot;McInerney&quot; (FFG-8), is an &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class guided-missile frigate, in service with the United States Navy from 1979 to 2010. She was then transferred to the Pakistan Navy and entered service as &quot;Alamgir&quot; (F260) in early 2011.

== Construction ==
USS &quot;McInerney&quot; (FFG-8), formerly PF-110, was the second ship of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot; class and was named for Vice Admiral Francis X. McInerney (1899–1956). Ordered from Bath Iron Works on 27 February 1976 as part of the U.S. fiscal year 1975 (FY75) program, &quot;McInerney&quot; was laid down on 16 January 1978, launched on 4 November 1978, and commissioned on 15 December 1979. The ship was sponsored by Joan McInerney Kelley, daughter of the late Vice Admiral Francis Xavier McInerney.

===Service in United States Navy===
====1980s====
&quot;McInerney&quot;″s mission was to provide multi-threat protection for military and merchant shipping, amphibious task forces and underway replenishment groups. During her first two years of service, &quot;McInerney&quot; was the U.S. Navy test platform for the LAMPS MK-III (SH-60B helicopter) anti-submarine warfare system and the Recovery Assist, Secure, and Traverse (RAST) system. To be able to accommodate the SH-60B, &quot;McInerney&quot; was the first &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class frigate to receive a lengthened stern. Her efforts during this period earned her a Meritorious Unit Commendation. In 1981, &quot;McInerney&quot; appears to have been part of Destroyer Squadron 8.

&quot;McInerney&quot;″s first major deployment to the Mediterranean Sea and Indian Ocean began in November 1982. During this deployment she embarked a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. &quot;McInerney&quot; made brief port visits to Tangiers, Morocco, and Catania, Sicily and supported the Multi-National Force in Beirut, Lebanon (earning her the Navy Expeditionary Medal). After transiting the Suez Canal, &quot;McInerney&quot; operated in the Indian Ocean and made port calls to Karachi, Pakistan, Columbo, Sri Lanka, and Mombasa, Kenya. She also crossed the equator en route to Diego Garcia. Following this deployment, &quot;McInerney&quot; operated in the Caribbean and visited Port Limon, Costa Rica and Tela, Honduras. She received the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Citation with the Operational Distinguishing Device, for her efforts in law enforcement during this period.

In October 1984, &quot;McInerney&quot; deployed again to the Middle East in the midst of the Iran/Iraq Tanker War. She had been fitted with the Phalanx CIWS and also carried a LAMPS Mk-I (SH-2 Seasprite) helicopter detachment. During this deployment she visited ports in Djibouti, United Arab Emirates, Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, Pakistan, and Palma, Spain. &quot;McInerney&quot; returned from this cruise in March 1985, and conducted law enforcement operations and other fleet exercises. In May 1986, &quot;USS McInerney&quot; began a 10-month-long overhaul (extended Selected Restricted Availability) in Boston, MA. During this yard period she received the AN/SQQ-89(V)2 Anti-Submarine Warfare Suite, fin stabilizers, and the Single Audio System. The RAST equipment was also reinstalled and made operational.

In August 1988, &quot;McInerney&quot; was underway for her third deployment— this one to the Mediterranean. This deployment was highlighted by &quot;McInerney&quot; being awarded the COMSIXTHFLT &quot;Hook &#x27;Em&quot; Award for excellence in Anti-Submarine Warfare and a Meritorious Unit Commendation. On the morning of 21 December, &quot;McInerney&quot; received a distress call from the cement tanker &quot;Jenneastar&quot;, southwest of Sardinia, Italy. The crew had abandoned the ship when she began to list 25 degrees to port and started taking on water in bad weather. Ten Polish crewman and two Ghanaian stowaways were rescued and transported to Naples, Italy. &quot;McInerney&quot; returned from the Mediterranean in February 1989, and departed for the Northern Atlantic in the spring of 1989. Anti-Submarine Warfare operations led &quot;McInerney&quot; above the Arctic Circle, and &quot;McInerney&quot; returned to Mayport in May 1989.

====1990s====
&quot;McInerney&quot; deployed to the Middle East in January 1991 and was awarded her second &quot;Hook &#x27;Em&quot; Award after a brief ASW operation in the Mediterranean Sea. &quot;McInerney&quot; then entered the Persian Gulf in support of coalition forces against Iraq. &quot;McInerney&quot; performed in every warfare area during the conflict, including convoy escort, mine warfare, anti-air and anti-surface operations. &quot;McInerney&quot; earned the Navy Unit Commendation, the Combat Action Ribbon, the National Defense Service Medal, the Southwest Asia Service Medal with Bronze Star, the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Saudi Arabia) and the Kuwait Liberation Medal (Kuwait) for her wartime service.

The ship returned from the Middle East in July 1991 after escorting more than 50 merchant vessels through the mine-swept waters to Kuwait ports. Her continued, proven prowess earned her the Battle &quot;E&quot; for efficiency, and the COMNAVSURFLANT ASW Award, designating her as the top AN/SQQ-89-configured ASW platform on the East Coast. &quot;McInerney&quot;″s humanitarian efforts, throughout her career, include assisting the tug &quot;Taurus&quot; in the Jacksonville Operating Area, transferring a wounded merchant seaman during the Tanker War, rescuing sailors from the sinking motor vessel &quot;Jenneastar&quot; in the Mediterranean and escorting merchant ships carrying needed supplies to the ports of Kuwait through mine-swept channels in the aftermath of Operation Desert Storm.

In 1999, &quot;McInerney&quot; participated in the UNITAS 40–99 deployment to South America UNITAS along with .
====2000s====
&quot;McInerney&quot; completed a highly successful SOUTHCOM Counter-Drug Operations Deployment in November 2003. The highlight of the deployment was a drug bust of an Ecuadorian fishing vessel in which nearly 10 tons of cocaine were seized. For her efforts throughout the deployment, &quot;McInerney&quot; was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal and the Coast Guard Meritorious Unit Commendation.

On 13 September 2008, &quot;McInerney&quot;, working with Coast Guard Law Enforcement Detachment 404, intercepted a self-propelled semisubmersible carrying seven tons of cocaine off the coast of Guatemala. Four Colombian drug smugglers were captured aboard. The cargo had an estimated street value of $187 million.

On 5 October 2009, &quot;McInerney&quot; left Mayport Naval Station on its final deployment.

On 3 April 2010, an MQ-8 Fire Scout from &quot;McInerney&quot; helped to confiscate of cocaine from a speedboat.

===Service in Pakistan Navy===
In September 2008, the United States Congress approved the transfer of the frigate to Pakistan, with a delivery date of August 2010. Citing the Foreign Assistance Act and the Arms Export Control Act, Pakistan is considered a &quot;major non-NATO ally&quot;, able to receive older unneeded US military equipment. &quot;McInerney&quot; was decommissioned on 31 August 2010. While equipment received under &quot;excess defence article&quot; (EDA) is free, Pakistan was to pay for refurbishing costs.

The 32-year-old frigate, which was renamed &quot;Alamgir&quot;, was given a US$65 million refurbishment, including anti-submarine capability. &quot;Alamgir&quot; received an overhaul of almost all mechanical equipment, ranging from the overhaul of all four diesels, down to inspection and replacement of sea valves and air conditioning. A new bridge and navigational suite were installed, along with a VIP cabin and a composite dome over the overhauled AN/SQS-56 sonar array.

Pakistani personnel embarked during December 2010 and were trained to operate the vessel to the US Navy&#x27;s Personnel Qualification Standard. Sea trials began in late January 2011. On 21 January, the ship collided with the pier during engine tests, resulting in damage to both the bow of the ship and pier. The goal was to sail &quot;Alamgir&quot; away on 10 February 2011. The sea trials were delayed for several weeks as repairs had to be conducted in the water due to lack of available drydock space. Ultimately, the repairs were completed on 22 February 2011 with sea trials being completed in the following weeks, departing Florida in time to reach Bermuda one month later on 24 March 2011.

On 24 March 2011, &quot;Almagir&quot; docked in the British North Atlantic territory of Bermuda.

On 18 February 2014, while operating off Oman&#x27;s Masirah Island, &quot;Alamgir&quot; and the Australian frigate intercepted and boarded a dhow found to be carrying of cannabis resin.

<text>Rafael E. Martinez (born April 26, 1950), is a Cuban-American lawyer. He is the brother of former Florida Senator Mel Martinez. Martinez was nominated in 2003 by President George W Bush to serve as a public delegate, representing the United States before the 57th United Nations General Assembly. He was confirmed by the United States Senate and served as a public delegate for that term. Mr. Martinez was the 2003 United States&#x27; candidate to serve on the Inter-American Commission on Human Rights, the human rights arm of the Organization of American States. Since his candidacy was unsuccessful, as of January 2004 there was no U.S. national on the seven-member Commission for the first time since its inception in 1959.

<text>Charles Julius Guiteau ( ; September 8, 1841June 30, 1882) was an American man who assassinated James A. Garfield, the 20th president of the United States, in 1881. A failed lawyer, Guiteau believed that he had played a major role in Garfield&#x27;s election victory, for which he should have been rewarded with a consulship. Guiteau felt frustrated and offended by the Garfield administration&#x27;s rejections of his applications to serve in Vienna or Paris to such a degree that he decided to kill Garfield and shot him at the Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station in Washington, D.C. Garfield died 79 days later from infections related to the wounds. In January 1882, Guiteau was sentenced to death for the crime and was hanged five months later.

==Early life and education==
Charles J. Guiteau was born in Freeport, Illinois, the fourth of six children of Jane August ( Howe; 1814–1848) and Luther Wilson Guiteau (1810–1880), whose family was of French Huguenot ancestry. His mother died in 1848, and in 1850, Guiteau moved with his family to Ulao, Wisconsin (near current-day Grafton), where he lived until 1855. Soon after, Guiteau and his father moved back to Freeport.

In 1860, Guiteau inherited $1,000 () from his grandfather and planned to attend the University of Michigan, but Guiteau failed the entrance examinations because of inadequate academic preparation. He crammed in French and algebra at Ann Arbor High School in Ann Arbor, Michigan, where Guiteau received numerous letters from his father that extolled the Oneida Community, so he quit school before completing the program. In June 1860, Guiteau joined the Oneida Community, the utopian religious sect in Oneida, New York, with which Guiteau&#x27;s father already had a close affiliation. According to Brian Resnick of &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, the younger Guiteau &quot;worshiped&quot; the group&#x27;s founder, John Humphrey Noyes, with Guiteau once writing that he had &quot;perfect, entire and absolute confidence in [Noyes] in all things&quot;.

Despite the sexually indiscriminate practices of the famously promiscuous Oneida Community members, Guiteau was generally rejected during his five years there and his name was turned into a play on words to create the nickname &quot;Charles Gitout&quot;. Guiteau left the community twice; the first time, he went to Hoboken, New Jersey, and attempted to start a newspaper based on the Oneida religion, called &quot;The Daily Theocrat&quot;. This failed and Guiteau returned to Oneida, only to leave again and file lawsuits against Noyes, in which he demanded payment for the work he had supposedly performed on behalf of the Oneida Community. Guiteau&#x27;s embarrassed father wrote letters in support of Noyes, who considered Guiteau irresponsible and insane.

==Career==
Guiteau worked as a clerk at a Chicago law firm and passed a cursory examination to attain admission to the bar. He was not successful as a lawyer as Guiteau argued only one case in court, and his client was convicted. In 1869, Guiteau met and married librarian Annie Bunn. The bulk of his legal business was in bill collecting; she later detailed how Guiteau kept disproportionate amounts from his collections and rarely give any money to his clients.

In 1872, Guiteau and his wife moved to New York City, one step ahead of bill collectors and dissatisfied clients. Guiteau took an interest in politics and identified with the Democratic Party. In the 1872 presidential election, he supported Horace Greeley, the Liberal Republican and Democratic candidate, against incumbent Republican Ulysses S. Grant. Guiteau prepared a disorganized speech in support of Greeley, which he delivered once. Greeley was badly defeated, but during the campaign Guiteau became convinced that if Greeley won, he would appoint Guiteau as minister (ambassador) to Chile. Guiteau was physically abusive with his wife; when she wanted a divorce in 1874, Guiteau obliged by having sex with a prostitute who then testified to his infidelity.

Turning back to religion, Guiteau published a book on the subject called &quot;The Truth&quot;, which was almost entirely plagiarized from the work of Noyes. By 1875, Guiteau&#x27;s father had become convinced that his son was possessed by Satan. Conversely, Guiteau himself became increasingly convinced that his actions were divinely inspired, and that his destiny was to &quot;preach a new Gospel&quot; like Paul the Apostle. He wandered from town to town preaching, and in December 1877, gave a lecture at the Congregational Church in Washington, D.C.

Guiteau spent the first half of 1880 in Boston, which he left owing money and under suspicion of theft. On June 11, 1880, Guiteau was a passenger on the SS &quot;Stonington&quot; when it collided with the SS &quot;Narragansett&quot; at night in heavy fog near the mouth of the Connecticut River. &quot;Stonington&quot; was able to return to port, but &quot;Narragansett&quot; burned to the waterline and sank with significant loss of life. Although none of his fellow passengers on &quot;Stonington&quot; were injured, the incident left Guiteau believing that he had been spared for a higher purpose.

Guiteau&#x27;s interest then turned again to politics. During the 1880 presidential campaign, the Republican Party was largely split into factions – the Stalwarts, led by Roscoe Conkling, who supported Grant for a third term, and the Half-Breeds, who supported James G. Blaine. Guiteau decided to support the Stalwarts and wrote a speech in support of Grant called &quot;Grant against Hancock&quot;, which he revised to &quot;Garfield against Hancock&quot; after Garfield (not affiliated with either faction) won the Republican nomination. Ultimately, Guiteau changed little more in the text than switching Grant&#x27;s name to Garfield&#x27;s. The speech was delivered at most twice, and printed copies were passed out to members of the Republican National Committee at their summer 1880 meeting in New York, but Guiteau believed himself to be largely responsible for Garfield&#x27;s victory over Democrat Winfield Scott Hancock that November. He insisted that he should be awarded a consulship for his supposedly vital assistance, first asking for Vienna, then deciding that he would rather have the one in Paris. Guiteau&#x27;s personal requests to Garfield and his cabinet as one of many job seekers who lined up every day to see them in person were continually rejected, as were his numerous letters.

By the early days of Garfield&#x27;s administration, which commenced in March 1881, Guiteau was living in Washington, D.C., destitute and forced to sneak between rooming houses without paying for his lodging and meals, and to walk around the cold, snowy city in a threadbare suit, without a coat, hat or boots. Guiteau spent his days in hotel lobbies reading discarded newspapers to keep track of the schedules of Garfield and his cabinet and making use of the hotels&#x27; complimentary stationery to write letters to them pressing his claim for a consulship. In the spring, Guiteau was still in Washington, and on May 14, 1881, he once more encountered Blaine, now Secretary of State, and inquired about a consular appointment; an exasperated Blaine finally snapped, &quot;Never speak to me again on the Paris consulship as long as you live!&quot;


===Assassination of Garfield===

Guiteau considered himself a loyal Republican and a Stalwart and convinced himself that his work for the party had been critical to Garfield&#x27;s election to the presidency. Later convinced that Garfield was going to destroy the Republican Party by abolishing the patronage system, and distraught after his final encounter with Blaine, Guiteau decided the only solution was to remove Garfield and elevate Vice President Chester A. Arthur, an acolyte of Senator Conkling, the Stalwart leader who managed Grant&#x27;s 1880 campaign and who was not on friendly terms with Garfield.

Guiteau conceded that the president would be too strong to kill with a knife, stating, &quot;Garfield would have crushed the life out of me with a single blow of his fist!&quot; He settled on a gun after contemplating what weapon he would use. Guiteau felt that God told him to kill the president; he felt that such an act would be a &quot;removal&quot; as opposed to an assassination. He also felt that Garfield needed to be killed to rid the Republican Party of Blaine&#x27;s influence. Borrowing $15 from George Maynard, a relative by marriage, Guiteau set out to purchase a revolver. He knew little about firearms, but Guiteau believed that he would need a large-caliber gun. While shopping at O&#x27;Meara&#x27;s store in Washington, he had to choose between a .442 Webley caliber British Bulldog revolver with wood grips or one with ivory grips. Guiteau preferred the one with the ivory handle because he thought it would look better as a museum exhibit after the assassination. Though Guiteau could not afford the extra dollar for the ivory grips, the store owner dropped the price for him. Guiteau spent the next few weeks in target practice – the recoil from the revolver almost knocked him over the first time he fired it. Guiteau&#x27;s weapon was recovered after the assassination and given to the Smithsonian, but it has since been lost.

On one occasion, Guiteau trailed Garfield to the since-demolished Baltimore and Potomac Railroad Station as the president was seeing his wife off to a beach resort in Long Branch, New Jersey, but Guiteau decided to postpone his plan because Garfield&#x27;s wife Lucretia was in poor health and Guiteau did not want to upset her. Having been alerted to the president&#x27;s schedule by a newspaper article, on July 2, 1881, he lay in wait for Garfield at the railroad station, getting his shoes shined, pacing, and engaging a cab to take him to the station later. As Garfield entered the station, looking forward to a vacation with his wife in Long Branch, Guiteau stepped forward and shot Garfield twice from behind, the second shot piercing the first lumbar vertebra but missing the spinal cord. As he surrendered to authorities, Guiteau said: &quot;I am a Stalwart of the Stalwarts. ... Arthur is president now!&quot;
==== Death of Garfield====
After a long, painful battle with infections, possibly brought on by his doctors&#x27; poking and probing of the wound with unwashed hands and non-sterilized instruments, Garfield died on September 19, 11 weeks after being shot. Modern physicians familiar with the case state that Garfield would have easily recovered from his wounds with sterile medical care, which was not common in the United States until a decade later, while Candice Millard argues that Garfield would have survived Guiteau&#x27;s bullet wound had his doctors simply left him alone. Rutkow, a professor of surgery at the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New Jersey, has argued that starvation also played a role. Rutkow suggests, &quot;Garfield had such a nonlethal wound. In today&#x27;s world, he would have gone home in a matter of two or three days.&quot; 

The conventional narrative regarding Garfield&#x27;s post-shooting medical condition was also challenged by Theodore Pappas and Shahrzad Joharifard in a 2013 article in &quot;The American Journal of Surgery&quot;. They argued that Garfield died from a late rupture of a splenic artery pseudoaneurysm, which developed secondary to the path of the bullet adjacent to the splenic artery. They also argued that his sepsis was actually caused by post-traumatic acute acalculous cholecystitis. Based on the autopsy report, the authors speculate that his gallbladder subsequently ruptured, leading to the development of a large bile-containing abscess adjacent to the gallbladder. Pappas and Joharifard suggest this caused the septic decline in Garfield&#x27;s condition that was visible starting from July 23, 1881.

===Trial and execution===


Once Garfield died, the government officially charged Guiteau with murder. He was formally indicted on October 14, 1881, on the charge of murder, which previously had been attempted murder after his arrest. Guiteau pleaded not guilty to the charge. The trial began in Washington, D.C., on November 17 in the Supreme Court for the District of Columbia (now the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia). The presiding judge in the case was Walter Smith Cox. Although Guiteau would insist on trying to represent himself during the entire trial, the court appointed Leigh Robinson to defend him. In less than a week of trial, Robinson retired from the case. George Scoville then became lead counsel for the defense. While Scoville&#x27;s legal experience lay in land title examination, he had married Guiteau&#x27;s sister and was thus obliged to defend him in court when no one else would. Wayne MacVeagh, the U.S. Attorney General, served as the chief prosecutor. MacVeagh named five lawyers to the prosecution team: George Corkhill, Walter Davidge, retired judge John K. Porter, Elihu Root, and E. B. Smith.

Guiteau&#x27;s trial was one of the first high-profile cases in the United States where a defense based on a claim of temporary insanity was considered. Guiteau vehemently insisted that while he had been legally insane at the time of the shooting (claiming God had taken away his free will) he was not really medically insane, which was one of the major causes of the rift between Guiteau and his defense lawyers. The judge gave the jury instructions based on the M&#x27;Naghten test.

The defense hired Edward Charles Spitzka, a leading alienist, a now-archaic term for a psychiatrist, as an expert witness in support of an insanity defense. Spitzka had stated that it was clear &quot;Guiteau is not only now insane, but that he was never anything else.&quot; While on the stand, Spitzka testified that he had &quot;no doubt&quot; that Guiteau was both insane and &quot;a moral monstrosity&quot;. He came to the conclusion that Guiteau had &quot;the insane manner&quot; he had so often observed in asylums, adding that Guiteau was a &quot;morbid egotist&quot; with &quot;a tendency to misinterpret the real affairs of life&quot;. He thought the condition to be the result of &quot;a congenital malformation of the brain&quot;.

Corkhill, who was the District of Columbia&#x27;s district attorney and on the prosecuting team, summed up the prosecution&#x27;s opinion of Guiteau&#x27;s insanity defense in a pre-trial press statement that also mirrored public opinion on the issue:

Guiteau became something of a media sensation during his entire trial for his bizarre behavior, which included him frequently cursing and insulting the judge, most of the witnesses, the prosecution, and even his defense team, as well as formatting his testimony in epic poems which he recited at length, and soliciting legal advice from random spectators in the audience via passed notes. He dictated an autobiography to the &quot;New York Herald&quot;, ending it with a personal ad for &quot;a nice Christian lady under 30 years of age&quot;. He was oblivious to the American public&#x27;s hatred of him, even after he was almost assassinated twice himself. He frequently smiled and waved at spectators and reporters in and out of the courtroom.

Guiteau sent a letter in which he argued that Arthur should set him free because he had just increased Arthur&#x27;s salary by making him president. At one point, Guiteau argued before Cox that Garfield was killed not by the bullets but by medical malpractice; &quot;The doctors killed Garfield, I just shot him.&quot; Throughout the trial and up until his execution, Guiteau was housed at St. Elizabeths Hospital in the southeastern quadrant of Washington, D.C. While in prison and awaiting execution, Guiteau wrote a defense of the assassination he had committed and an account of his own trial, which was published as &quot;The Truth and the Removal&quot;.

To the end, Guiteau was making plans to start a lecture tour after his perceived imminent release and to run for president himself in 1884, while at the same time continuing to delight in the media circus surrounding his trial. He was found guilty on January 25, 1882, and sentenced to death. After the guilty verdict was read, Guiteau stepped forward, despite his lawyers&#x27; efforts to tell him to be quiet, and yelled at the jury, saying, &quot;You are all low, consummate jackasses!&quot;, plus a further stream of curses and obscenities before he was taken away by guards to his cell to await execution. Guiteau appealed his conviction, but the appeal was rejected.

Twenty-nine days before his execution, Guiteau composed a lengthy poem asserting that God had commanded him to kill Garfield to prevent Blaine&#x27;s &quot;scheming&quot; to war with Chile and Peru. Guiteau also claimed in the poem that now-President Arthur knew the assassination had saved the United States, and that Arthur&#x27;s refusal to pardon him was the &quot;basest ingratitude&quot;. He also (incorrectly) presumed that Arthur would pressure the Supreme Court into hearing his court appeal.

Guiteau was hanged on June 30, 1882, in the District of Columbia, just two days before the first anniversary of the shooting. Guiteau survived his victim by nine months and eleven days, a longer period than any other presidential assassin.
While being led to his execution, Guiteau was said to have continued to smile and wave at spectators and reporters. He notoriously danced his way to the gallows and shook hands with his executioner. On the scaffold, Guiteau delivered a &quot;last dying prayer&quot; in which he declared that God &quot;did inspire the act for which I am now murdered&quot; and predicted that &quot;This government and this nation, by this act, will incur Thy eternal enmity,&quot; adding that &quot;Thy divine law of retribution will strike this nation and my murderers.&quot; Guiteau also excoriated President Arthur as &quot;a coward and an ingrate whose ingratitude to the man that made him and saved his party and land from overthrow has no parallel in history.&quot; Then, as a last request, Guiteau recited a poem &quot;that I wrote this morning about 10 o&#x27;clock&quot; called &quot;I Am Going to the Lordy&quot;, which he had written during his incarceration. Guiteau had originally requested an orchestra to play as he sang his poem, but this request was denied.

As per request with the executioner, Guiteau signaled that he was ready to die by dropping the paper. After he finished reading his poem, a black hood was placed over the smiling Guiteau&#x27;s head and moments later the gallows trapdoor was sprung, the rope breaking his neck instantly with the fall. Guiteau&#x27;s body was not returned to his family, as they were unable to afford a private funeral, but was instead autopsied and buried in a corner of the jail yard. 

With tiny pieces of the hanging rope already being sold as souvenirs to a fascinated public, rumors immediately began to swirl that jail guards planned to dig up Guiteau&#x27;s corpse to meet demands of this burgeoning new market. Fearing scandal, the decision was made to disinter the corpse. The body was sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland, which preserved Guiteau&#x27;s brain as well as his enlarged spleen discovered at autopsy and bleached the skeleton. These were placed in storage by the museum. Parts of Guiteau&#x27;s brain remain on display in a jar at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.

==Psychological assessment==

In 1881, psychiatrist Allan McLane Hamilton testified that he believed that Guiteau was sane when he assassinated Garfield. Upon his autopsy, it was discovered that Guiteau had the condition known as phimosis, an inability to retract the foreskin, which at the time was thought to have caused the insanity that led him to assassinate Garfield. An autopsy of his brain revealed that his dura mater was abnormally thick, suggesting he may have had neurosyphillis, a disease which causes mental instability; Guiteau could have contracted syphilis from a prostitute. George Paulson, formerly the chair of neurology at the Ohio State University, disputed the neurosyphillis diagnosis, arguing that Guiteau had both schizophrenia and &quot;grandiose narcissism&quot;.
In 2014, the criminal psychologist Kent Kiehl said that Guiteau was a psychopath, giving him a score of 37.5 out of 40 on the PCL-R scale.

==In popular culture==

The life of Guiteau, focusing on his psychological disturbances and his plan to kill Garfield, is the subject of &quot;Portrait of an Assassin&quot;, a radio play by James Agate Jr. The play was produced as Episode 1125 of &quot;CBS Radio Mystery Theater&quot; and was first broadcast on October 8, 1980, where he was played by John Lithgow.

Guiteau is depicted in Stephen Sondheim and John Weidman&#x27;s musical &quot;Assassins&quot;, wherein he mentors Sara Jane Moore, a woman who attempted to assassinate Gerald Ford. Guiteau sings parts of &quot;I am Going to the Lordy&quot; in the musical&#x27;s song &quot;The Ballad of Guiteau&quot;.

In the &quot;American Dad!&quot; episode &quot;Garfield and Friends&quot;, Hayley Smith uses Guiteau&#x27;s DNA to revive him and uses him like a bloodhound to track down a revived Garfield.

In the alternate history short story &quot;I Shall Have a Flight to Glory&quot; by Michael P. Kube-McDowell in the 1992 anthology &quot;Alternate Presidents&quot; edited by Mike Resnick, Guiteau and Garfield are allies against Samuel J. Tilden, who has become a tyrannical president.

Actor Will Janowitz plays Guiteau in the 2016 PBS documentary &quot;American Experience: Murder of a President&quot;. Guiteau is portrayed by Matthew Macfadyen in the 2025 Netflix miniseries &quot;Death by Lightning&quot;.

The Ramblin&#x27; Jack Elliott song &quot;The Death of Mister Garfield&quot; recounts the assassination and the reactions of a fictional witness. Johnny Cash learned the song from Elliott, and later recorded a re-worked version as &quot;Mr. Garfield&quot;.

<text>Paul William Walker IV (September 12, 1973 – November 30, 2013) was an American actor. He was best known for his role as Brian O&#x27;Conner in the &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; franchise.

Paul Walker began his career as a child actor in the 1980s, gaining recognition in the 1990s after appearing in the television soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; he received praise for his performances in the teen comedy &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; and the comedy-drama &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (both 1999), and rose to international fame by starring in &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot; (2001).

He also starred in the commercially successful road thriller &quot;Joy Ride&quot; (2001), becoming an action star. He followed this with the box-office disappointments &quot;Into the Blue&quot; (2005) and &quot;Running Scared&quot; (2006), although he earned praise for his performance in the survival drama &quot;Eight Below&quot; and for his portrayal of Hank Hansen in &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (both 2006). Outside of these, Walker largely appeared in low-budget action films, but starred in the commercially successful heist film &quot;Takers&quot; (2010).

Walker died in a single-vehicle collision on November 30, 2013, as a passenger in a speeding car. His father and daughter filed separate wrongful death lawsuits against Porsche, which resulted in settlements. At the time of his death, Walker had not completed filming &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015); it was released after rewrites and stand-ins, including his brothers Cody and Caleb, both of whom filled in for him, were used to complete the film while the song &quot;See You Again&quot; by Wiz Khalifa and Charlie Puth was commissioned as a tribute.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born on September 12, 1973, in Glendale, California. His mother, Cheryl (née Crabtree), was a fashion model, and his father, Paul William Walker III, was a sewer contractor and former amateur boxer who was a two-time Golden Gloves champion. Walker&#x27;s paternal grandfather, William, had a short-lived boxing career as &quot;Irish&quot; Billy Walker, while another raced factory cars for Ford in the 1960s.

Walker was raised in the Mormon religion, and had four younger siblings: Aimee, Ashlie, Caleb, and Cody. He spent most of his early life in the Sunland neighborhood of Los Angeles and graduated from high school at Village Christian School in 1991. Walker subsequently attended several community colleges in Southern California, majoring in marine biology.

==Career==

Walker began a modeling career as a toddler, starring in a television commercial for Pampers at age two. He continued to appear in commercials, most notably for Showbiz Pizza in 1984, before beginning an acting career on television that year, appearing in the teen anthology series &quot;CBS Schoolbreak Special&quot;. Walker continued to work in television until 1996, across a number of genres; he appeared in two episodes of the fantasy drama &quot;Highway to Heaven&quot; between 1984 and 1986, and secured his first leading role in 1987, appearing as Jeremy Beatty in the sitcom &quot;Throb&quot;. He continued to feature on sitcoms in the early 1990s, with guest roles in &quot;Charles in Charge&quot;, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, and the short-lived &quot;What a Dummy&quot;. In 1993, he portrayed Brandon Collins on the soap opera &quot;The Young and the Restless&quot;; he and co-star Heather Tom, who played Victoria Newman, gained fame, and were nominated for Outstanding Lead Actor and Actress in a Soap Opera at the Youth in Film Awards. Walker&#x27;s final television role was on &quot;Touched by an Angel&quot;, although he appeared as himself, alongside his sister Ashlie, as contestants on a 1988 episode of the game show &quot;I&#x27;m Telling!&quot;, in which they finished in second place.

Walker began his film career in 1986, appearing mainly in low budget B films. His first role was in the horror comedy &quot;Monster in the Closet&quot;, and a year later, starred in The Retaliator (retroactively subtitled &quot;Programmed to Kill&quot;), a science fiction film. In 1994, he returned to film, starring in &quot;Tammy and the T-Rex&quot;, but secured his first feature film role in the comedy &quot;Meet the Deedles&quot; in 1998; although commercially and critically unsuccessful, it allowed Walker to secure supporting roles in the films &quot;Pleasantville&quot; (1998), &quot;Varsity Blues&quot; (1999), &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot; (1999), and &quot;The Skulls&quot; (2000).
In 2001, Walker&#x27;s breakthrough role was starring opposite Vin Diesel in the action film &quot;The Fast and the Furious&quot;; it was commercially successful, and subsequently launched a media franchise. The film also established Walker as a film star and leading man, as his performance garnered the MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Team (shared with Diesel) in 2002. Walker starred in the critically successful thriller &quot;Joy Ride&quot; (2001), also focusing on car-related action, and reprised his role as Brian O&#x27;Conner in the 2003 sequel &quot;2 Fast 2 Furious&quot;. After this, he starred either in low-budget or commercially unsuccessful films for a time, notably &quot;Timeline&quot; (2003) and &quot;Into the Blue&quot; (2005).
Walker portrayed Hank Hansen in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s war film &quot;Flags of Our Fathers&quot; (2006) and starred in the survival drama &quot;Eight Below&quot;, both released in 2006. &quot;Eight Below&quot; garnered critical acclaim and opened in first place at the box office, grossing over US$20 million during its opening weekend. Walker then starred in the independent film &quot;The Lazarus Project&quot;, which was released on DVD on October 21, 2008.

Despite initial reluctance, Walker reprised his role as Brian O&#x27;Conner after seven years, in &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; (2009). The film became the highest-grossing film in the franchise up until that point. He then reprised his role in the fifth and sixth installments of the franchise, which were commercially successful, while his performances were praised. Walker was nominated for Choice Movie Actor – Action at the 2011 Teen Choice Awards for the former, and nominated for Choice Movie: Chemistry (with Diesel and Dwayne Johnson) and won his second MTV Movie Award for Best On-Screen Duo with Diesel for the latter. Walker also starred in the heist film &quot;Takers&quot; (2010), and returned to modeling in 2011, appearing as the face of fragrance brand Cool Water. In 2012, he founded the film production company Laguna Ridge Pictures, which signed a first-look deal with &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; distributor Universal Pictures.

After his death in 2013, three films starring Walker were released; the thriller film &quot;Hours&quot; (2013), the action film &quot;Brick Mansions&quot; (2014), itself a remake of the French film &quot;District 13&quot; (2004). He also starred in &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015) but died before he had wrapped up filming. It was originally set to release in 2014, but was pushed back to recreate Walker&#x27;s likeness. At the time of his death, he had completed 85% of his scenes. The filmmakers hired Peter Jackson&#x27;s Weta Digital visual effects house to complete this, using existing reference materials, Walker&#x27;s brothers Caleb and Cody, as well as co-star John Brotherton, as stand-ins, and outtakes or older footage, to create an accurate remodel of Walker&#x27;s face. The film was then released in 2015, and Walker won the award for Choice Movie Actor: Action at the 2015 Teen Choice Awards, and was nominated for Choice Movie: Chemistry (shared with Diesel, Johnson, Michelle Rodriguez, Tyrese Gibson, and Ludacris).

Walker was also set to play Dawson Cole in &quot;The Best of Me&quot; (2014) and Agent 47 in the film adaptation &quot;&quot; (2015) after wrapping up &quot;Furious 7&quot; (2015), but died before both productions began. It was later revealed Walker declined the role of Superman in &quot;Superman Returns&quot; (2006), allegedly due to the &quot;Superman curse&quot; and the celebrity associated with the role.

Walker posthumously reprised his role as Brian O&#x27;Conner in &quot;Fast X&quot; (2023) through archival footage from &quot;Fast Five&quot; (2011). He also posthumously received a star on Hollywood Walk of Fame in the same year.

==Personal life==
Raised in a Mormon household, Walker became a non-denominational Christian as an adult. He lived in Santa Barbara with his dogs. He and Rebecca Soteros, a childhood friend with whom he had an on-and-off relationship, had a daughter named Meadow Rain Walker. Meadow lived with her mother in Hawaii for 13 years and, in 2011, moved to California to live with Walker. Vin Diesel, Walker&#x27;s close friend, is the godfather of Walker&#x27;s daughter.

In addition to Diesel, Walker was also close friends with fellow &quot;Fast &amp; Furious&quot; co-star Tyrese Gibson.

He held a brown belt in Brazilian jiu-jitsu under Ricardo &quot;Franjinha&quot; Miller at Paragon Jiu-Jitsu and was awarded his black belt by Miller posthumously. Walker founded the humanitarian aid nonprofit charity Reach Out Worldwide (ROWW) with financial adviser Roger Rodas in response to the 2010 Haiti earthquake. He traveled to a number of disaster-stricken areas to supply aid until his death.
Walker had an interest in marine biology, and joined the board of directors of The Billfish Foundation in 2006. He fulfilled a lifelong dream by starring in the National Geographic Channel series &quot;Expedition Great White&quot; (retroactively retitled &quot;Shark Men&quot;), which premiered in June 2010. Walker spent 11 days catching and tagging seven great white sharks off the coast of Mexico. The expedition, led by Chris Fischer, founder and CEO of Fischer Productions, and Brett McBride and Michael Domeier of the Marine Conservation Science Institute, took measurements, gathered DNA samples, and fastened real-time satellite tags to the great white sharks, in order to study migratory patterns, especially those associated with mating and birthing, over a five-year period.

A car enthusiast, Walker competed in the Redline Time Attack racing series in which he raced on the AE Performance Team driving a BMW E92 M3. His car was sponsored by Etnies, Brembo Brakes, Öhlins, Volk, OS Giken, Hankook, Gintani, and Reach Out Worldwide. Walker had been preparing for an auto show prior to his death. Walker owned Always Evolving, a Valencia high-end vehicle performance shop, where Rodas, a pro-am racer, acted as CEO. Walker had a large collection of about 30 cars, a portion of which he co-owned along with Rodas. In January 2020, 21 vehicles owned by Walker were sold for a combined $2.33 million during spirited bidding at an annual car auction in Arizona.

==Death==

On November 30, 2013, at about 3:30 p.m. PST, Walker, 40, and Roger Rodas, 38, left an event for Walker&#x27;s charity Reach Out Worldwide for victims of Typhoon Haiyan, with Rodas driving his red 2005 Porsche Carrera GT. Traveling between and in a
 speed zone on Hercules Street in Valencia, a neighborhood of Santa Clarita, California, Rodas lost control of the car and crashed into a concrete lamp post and two trees off the road, catching fire within seconds after impact. According to forensic evidence gathered from the scene, both men were knocked out by the impact. Rodas died instantly from multiple physical trauma while Walker died within seconds from the combined effects of physical trauma and burns. Both of their bodies were burned beyond recognition.

The curve where Walker and Rodas died is a popular spot for drifting cars. No alcohol or other drugs were found in either man&#x27;s system, and neither mechanical failure nor road conditions appeared to play a role. Police found no evidence of drag racing. The investigation concluded that the car&#x27;s speed and age of the tires were the primary reasons for the crash.

With &quot;Furious 7&quot; in the middle of filming at the time of Walker&#x27;s death, Universal announced an indeterminate hiatus on the production, citing a desire to speak with his family before determining what to do with the film.

Numerous friends and movie stars posted tributes to Walker on social media. His remains were cremated and his ashes were buried in a non-denominational ceremony at Forest Lawn Memorial Park. His life was later chronicled in the documentary &quot;I Am Paul Walker&quot;, which was released on August 11, 2018.

=== Lawsuits ===
In December 2014, Walker&#x27;s father filed a wrongful death claim against Rodas&#x27; estate, seeking the return of or &quot;a proportionate share&quot; of revenue generated by a group of automobiles that were jointly owned by both Walker and Rodas. Walker&#x27;s daughter received a $10.1M settlement in 2016.

In September 2015, Walker&#x27;s daughter filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Porsche, claiming that the Porsche Carrera GT had numerous design defects including a history of instability, and that its seat belt placement can cause harm upon impact. Porsche denied any wrongdoing and blamed Walker, stating: &quot;The perils, risk, and danger were open and obvious and known to him, and he chose to conduct himself in a manner so as to expose himself to such perils, dangers, and risks, thus assuming all the risks involved in using the vehicle.&quot; Walker&#x27;s father and daughter both reached separate out-of-court settlements with Porsche. In April 2016, U.S. District Court Judge Philip S. Gutierrez ruled in favor of Porsche in a separate lawsuit filed by Rodas&#x27; widow Kristine.

<text>Asset stripping refers to selling off a company&#x27;s assets to improve returns for equity investors, often a financial investor, a &quot;corporate raider&quot;, who takes over another company and then auctions off the acquired company&#x27;s assets. The term is generally used in a pejorative sense as such activity is not considered helpful to the company.

The proceeds of the sale of assets may be used to lower the company&#x27;s net debt. Alternatively, they may be used to pay a dividend to equityholders, leaving the company with lower net worth – i.e. the same level of debt but fewer assets (and weaker earnings) to support that debt. With a lower level of assets, some argue that the business is rendered less financially stable or viable. For example, the sale-and-leaseback of a building would lead to an increased rental bill for the company.

Asset stripping is a highly controversial topic within the financial world. The benefits of asset stripping generally go to the corporate raiders, who can slash the debts they may have whilst improving their net worth. 
However, since asset stripping often results in thousands of employees losing their jobs without much consideration of the consequences to the affected community, the concept can be unpopular in the public sphere. One particular example of where asset stripping cost a significant number of workers their jobs was in the Fontainebleau Las Vegas LLC case. After the takeover, 433 people lost their jobs when assets were sold off and the company was stripped.

Asset stripping has been considered to be a problem in economies such the United Kingdom, and the United States, which have highly financialized economies. In these situations, finance capital focusses on shareholder returns, sometimes at the expense of the viability of bought out companies.

==History==
Early innovators of asset stripping were Carl Icahn, Victor Posner, and Nelson Peltz; all of whom were investors in the 1970s and 1980s. Carl Icahn performed one of the most notorious and hostile takeovers when he acquired Trans World Airlines in 1985. Icahn stripped TWA of its assets, selling them individually to repay the debt assimilated during the takeover. This particular corporate raid formed the idea of selling a company&#x27;s assets in order to repay debt, and eventually increase the raider&#x27;s net worth.

One of the biggest corporate raids that failed to materialize was the takeover of Gulf Oil by T. Boone Pickens. In 1984, Pickens attempted to acquire Gulf Oil and sell its assets individually to gain net worth. However, the purchase would have had been severely detrimental to Chevron; a customer of Gulf Oil. Therefore, Chevron stepped-in and merged with Gulf Oil for $13.2 billion, which at that time was the biggest merger between two companies.

In 2011, BC Partners acquired Phones 4u for a fee in the region of £700 million. At this point in time Phones 4u had already entered administration and had deep financial struggles. However, this did not prevent BC Partners from taking a £223 million dividend in order to pay off some of its own debts. Under the ownership of BC Partners, Phones 4u had very little financial freedom to expand and claim back the contract of EE. In September 2014 O2, Vodafone and Three decided to withdraw the rights for Phones 4u to sell their products. Due to the already poor financial situation of Phones 4u, the company had no alternative but to sell its individual assets and close down. The net worth of Phones 4u&#x27;s assets, estimated to exceed £1.4 billion, provided BC Partners with the credit to pay off some of its debts and significantly improve its net worth.

==In the United Kingdom==
The process of asset stripping is not an illegal practice. If a corporate raider sells the target company&#x27;s assets individually and pays off its debts the financial regulators have no room for investigation. However, some firms perform the process illegally and if found guilty may incur a substantial fine or even prison.

Asset stripping by private equity firms in Europe is now regulated pursuant to the Alternative Investment Fund Managers Directive.

===Phoenixing===

This is one of two methods a corporate raider can use to strip assets illegally. For this method to work, the corporate raider and the targeted firm must have the same director. Assets of the targeted firm are transferred to the corporate raider to ensure they remain safe from debt collectors. This process lets the corporate raider improve their net worth while leaving liabilities with the targeted company.

===Liquidation===

This method acts on completely fraudulent terms, and results in a higher punishment from the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA). Here, corporate raiders take ownership of a company on hostile terms, transfer the assets to their name, and then put the dilapidated firm into liquidation. This ensures that the corporate raider improves their net worth, and has no liability to deal with the firm recently placed into liquidation.

<text>Morgan Ailis Webb (born October 5, 1978) is a former co-host and senior segment producer of the G4 show &quot;X-Play&quot;. She was previously the host of the podcast &quot;WebbAlert&quot; and a monthly columnist for the United States edition of &quot;FHM&quot;, where she contributed a monthly video game column titled &quot;Tips from the Gaming Goddess&quot;. She began working at independent game studio Bonfire Studios in March 2017 in a production role.

== Career ==
Raised in Los Angeles, Webb attended UC Berkeley from 1996 to 2000. She developed computer skills in her free time there, and after graduating from college worked for a dot-com company as a website administrator. After the company went under during the dot-com bubble burst of 2000, her friend Catherine Schwartz got her hired at TechTV in 2001, and Webb became employed as the associate producer and web researcher for &quot;The Screen Savers&quot;. Throughout 2002 and 2003, she also regularly co-hosted TechTV&#x27;s &quot;Call for Help&quot; with Chris Pirillo. In April 2003, Webb left &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; to co-host &quot;X-Play&quot; with Adam Sessler.

Webb is one of the six TechTV personalities to survive the massive layoffs resulting from the May 2004 merger of G4 and TechTV. Only Adam Sessler and Webb remained with the network after G4&#x27;s change in format. After Sessler&#x27;s employment was terminated in April 2012, Webb was the only original TechTV personality remaining on the network.
In August 2005, Webb became a contributing game columnist for &quot;FHM&quot;, alongside her regular hosting duties on &quot;X-Play&quot;. Her monthly column was titled &quot;Tips from the Gaming Goddess&quot;. Readers were encouraged to email Webb their video-game-related inquiries; she would then answer one question each month. In February 2007, Webb wrote her final column for the magazine, which discontinued its U.S. publication in March. She also hosted the short-lived &quot;Free Stuff&quot; on G4.

From August 2, 2007, to January 25, 2009, Webb had a daily video blogging initiative called &quot;WebbAlert&quot;. These videos were 5 to 6 minutes in length, and each consisted of a recap of popular technology news of the day. On occasion, Webb departed from the regular news format in favor of an episode on one particular topic of interest. Examples included a recap of the annual TED Conference, a viral video special showcasing &quot;future &#x27;Darwin Award&#x27; winners&quot;, and tech-centric &quot;Holiday Buyer&#x27;s Guides&quot;. In January 2009, Webb suspended &quot;WebbAlert&quot; indefinitely due to issues with maintaining it on a daily basis concurrently with her hosting duties on &quot;X-Play&quot;.

On February 25, 2009, G4 announced that Webb would be the host of their new show &quot;G4 Underground&quot;, a weekly series that profiles a wide range of people and topics that are of interest to the &quot;internet generation&quot;. It premiered March 29, 2009.

After airing more than 1300 episodes, &quot;X-Play&quot; aired its final episode on January 23, 2013.

From June 11, 2013, through June 13, 2013, Morgan co-anchored Microsoft&#x27;s nightly &quot;Xbox @ E3 Live&quot; streaming event coverage on Xbox Live, reuniting her with former G4 personalities Kevin Pereira, Blair Herter, Jessica Chobot, Blair Butler and Tina Summerford.

Morgan worked as a consultant and creative advisor for Activision Blizzard, where she also produced and hosted Blizzard&#x27;s now-defunct monthly World of Warcraft discussion program &quot;WoW Source&quot;.

In September 2017, Morgan announced her employment at Bonfire Studios where she helps organize the community and other various functions.

== Personal life ==
As an infant and small child, Webb appeared in advertisements for Gerber baby food, Kenner Toys, and an ad for McDonald&#x27;s, where she recited the ingredients of the Big Mac to a game of Pat-a-cake. Though Webb&#x27;s parents refused to let her watch television, she made up for it by playing video games. She began with an Atari, primarily the game &quot;Combat&quot;; however, as technology progressed, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot; and &quot;Phantasy Star&quot; became two of her favorite games. 

After Webb graduated from high school, she left home to attend UC Berkeley. There, she earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in rhetoric (with a minor in Italian) in 2000.

On August 19, 2006, Webb married Rob Reid in a service at City Hall in San Francisco, California.

Webb has joined the web-series Acquisitions Incorporated in playing several Dungeons &amp; Dragons games at live events like PAX West.

== Media appearances ==

Throughout 2004 and beyond, Webb was featured in numerous issues of print publications. &quot;Maxim&quot; magazine spotlighted her in their July 2004 issue. &quot;FHM&quot; featured a five-page article in their November 2004 issue, and also had her listed in three consecutive years for their annual &quot;The 100 Sexiest Women in the World&quot; article: #73 in 2005, #62 in 2006, and #51 in 2007. Other magazines have featured her as well, voted &quot;Hottest Woman of the Year&quot; in RTD&#x27;s 2006 Top 10 countdown and in an article in the fall 2006 edition of &quot;Colleges.com U Magazine&quot;.

In April 2004, Webb was in &quot;TechTV&#x27;s Sexiest Techie&quot; poll sponsored by &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine. TechTV viewers could vote for their favorite girl via the &quot;Playboy&quot; website. Webb won the poll and was offered a nude photo shoot, but she refused, despite being &quot;very flattered&quot;, citing her own personal reasons and her parents&#x27; objection to the idea.

Webb appeared in the music video &quot;Strange New Element&quot; from the band Low Water. She makes her appearance near the end of the video alongside other fellow TechTV personalities, including Catherine Schwartz, Sarah Lane, Laura Swisher, Chi-Lan Lieu, and Sumi Das. In addition to appearing in Low Water&#x27;s music video, Webb is featured in the artwork of the band&#x27;s album &quot;Hard Words in a Speakeasy&quot;. She additionally provided her own vocals for &quot;X-Play: The Musical&quot;, which aired in February 2007. She is a frequent guest on various talk shows, including &quot;The Tyra Banks Show&quot; (in February 2008), &quot;Chelsea Lately&quot; (in early 2009), and &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; (on April 15, 2009). She was also a frequent co-host on G4&#x27;s &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;. On June 17, 2009, Webb appeared on KCRW Radio, as part of the station&#x27;s &quot;Guest DJ Project&quot;.

On June 21, 2008, Webb along with her &quot;X-Play&quot; co-host Adam Sessler, participated in the 50th annual &quot;Hollywood Stars Celebrity Softball&quot; game at Dodger Stadium.

A YouTube video was posted on October 7, 2013, with Webb as the well-versed host of a &quot;Patch 5.4 Developer Round Table&quot; discussion with Blizzard Entertainment employees J. Allen Brack, Ion Hazzikostas, and Tom Chilton.

Webb played a minor role as Neely Lamm on the CBS TV Drama series Bull on an episode titled, &quot;The Fall&quot; which aired on February 7, 2017.

<doc id="244941" wikidata="Q7868981" url="?curid=244941" title="USS Duncan (FFG-10)">
<text>The USS &quot;Duncan&quot; (FFG-10) was the fourth ship of the &quot;Oliver Hazard Perry&quot;-class of guided-missile frigates, and was named for Vice Admiral Donald B. Duncan (1896–1975). Ordered from Todd Pacific, Seattle, Washington on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY75 program, &quot;Duncan&quot; was laid down on 29 April 1977, launched on 1 March 1978, and commissioned on 15 May 1980.

==History==
&quot;Duncan&quot;, former PF-111, was sponsored by Mrs. Aniela Mateja Duncan, widow of the ship&#x27;s namesake.

In December 1982, &quot;Duncan&quot; developed a fissure in her superstructure during a storm. It was a class design deficiency that occurred on other frigates.

In January 1984, &quot;Duncan&quot; was transferred to the United States Navy Reserve Fleet and Selected Reserve (SELRES) members provided for a portion of the ship&#x27;s manning.

&quot;Duncan&quot; and her crew were awarded the Battle Effectiveness Award five times for 18-month time periods ranging from July 1981 to June 1983 and July 1986 to December 1990.

&quot;Duncan&quot; participated in Port of Hueneme Harbor Days in October 1992.

In March 1993, sailors aboard &quot;Duncan&quot; rescued four fisherman from Ecuador who were stranded on their disabled fishing boat in the Pacific Ocean. &quot;Duncan&quot; towed their boat to safety in Manta, Ecuador. &quot;Duncan&quot; and her crew were nominated for the Humanitarian Service Medal in March 1993, but no unit award was given.

===1992 Sitka port visit===
&quot;Duncan&quot; participated in Sitka, Alaska&#x27;s 125th anniversary Alaska Day celebration, 18 October 1992. The port visit became notorious following allegations of sexual misconduct with minors by crew members and the event&#x27;s relative proximity to the Tailhook scandal and subsequent investigation. After &quot;Duncan&quot; was decommissioned, the story re-appeared in national media in 1996, following investigative reporting by the Dayton Daily News&#x27; Russell Carollo, due to complaints that the Navy didn&#x27;t adequately punish the sailors involved. A grand jury in Sitka indicted two &quot;Duncan&quot; sailors on sexual assault charges, but the cases were dismissed in January 1997 due to prosecutorial delay and the Judge&#x27;s determination that the two had already been tried by the Navy. A 22-year-old Ensign had faced court martial but pleaded down to a letter of reprimand. Later, he also received an other than honorable discharge. The second sailor, a 23-year-old enlisted man, also faced court martial, but his charges were dropped by the court&#x27;s presiding officer.

===Decommissioning===
&quot;Duncan&quot; was decommissioned on 17 December 1994 &amp; stricken on 5 January 1998, then &quot;Duncan&quot; was sold to Turkey on 5 April 1999 for use as a parts hulk. She was the first &quot;Perry&quot;-class frigate to be decommissioned, in commission for just 14.6 years. At the time, the Soviet Union had recently collapsed, and &quot;Duncan&quot; was one of the oldest, unmodified, short hulled frigates in the fleet. She lacked some of the options others in her class had been modified with. For example, as a short hull ship, she did not have SH-60 Seahawk capability or a RAST to haul down the helicopter &amp; transport it into the hangar. She also lacked a towed array sonar (TACTAS) and the MK-92 COherent Receiver Transmitter (CORT) modification. On 4 October 2017, ex-&quot;Duncan&quot; was scuttled by the submarine TCG &quot;Sakarya&quot; on the Black Sea.

<doc id="244943" wikidata="Q5230640" url="?curid=244943" title="David Ahenakew">
<text>David Ahenakew (July 28, 1933 – March 12, 2010) was a Canadian First Nations (Cree) politician, and former National Chief of the Assembly of First Nations.

Ahenakew was born at the Sandy Lake Indian Reserve in Saskatchewan. He and his wife, Grace Ahenakew, had five children.

==Military and political career==
Ahenakew served in the Canadian Forces from 1951 to 1967, during which time he was stationed in Germany, Korea (during the Korean War), and Egypt. An alternate source indicates he served with the Canadian Armed Forces Engineers Corps in Canada, Egypt and Germany from 1962 to 1968 and attained the rank of Sergeant.

In 1967, upon leaving the army, Ahenakew accepted a position with the Saskatchewan government, and became active in the Federation of Saskatchewan Indian Nations (FSIN). He was elected to the position of FSIN president in 1968 (until 1979). He stated that his military experience heavily influenced his choice to pursue politics: &quot;I could see that what was happening to our people was the same kind of exploitation and degradation I had seen in Korea and Egypt.&quot;

During his time as FSIN president he released a report entitled &quot;Indian Education in Saskatchewan,&quot; and played a role in the founding of the Saskatchewan Indian Cultural College and the Saskatchewan Indian Federated College in 1972.

He received an honorary Doctor of Laws degree from the University of Regina in 1977 and in 1978 he received the John Stratychuk award from the Saskatchewan Human Rights Association.

Ahenakew received the Order of Canada in the degree of Member in 1978. His citation read: &quot;Member of a United Nations committee and of the World Indigenous Peoples Council. His many years of service to Indians and Métis in Saskatchewan culminated in his election as Chief of the Federation of Saskatchewan Indians, which has revolutionized Indian education in his province.&quot; He was stripped of the Order of Canada in 2005 after making controversial remarks about the Holocaust.

On March 9, 1981, he was appointed Director of the Saskatchewan Public Service Commission&#x27;s Special Programs Unit.

In 1982, he was elected Chief of the Assembly of First Nations, a national representative body for Canadian aboriginals.

==Controversy surrounding antisemitic remarks==
On December 13, 2002, Ahenakew gave a speech to an FSIN group, which was attended by James Parker, a reporter from the &quot;Saskatoon StarPhoenix&quot;. He made references to &quot;goddamn immigrants&quot; in Canada during his speech. During a question-and-answer session following his lecture, Ahenakew said that Jews were a disease in Germany and that Hitler was trying to &quot;clean up Europe&quot; when he &quot;fried six million of those guys.&quot; He also stated that Israel and the United States (specifically mentioning George W. Bush) were going to start the next world war.

The Germans used to tell me, and I got to know them well because I played soccer against them and with them and so forth. But they used to tell me that you guys are blessed. What we know about the Indians in Canada. They are blessed. But that blessing is being destroyed by your immigrants that are going over there. Especially the Jews, they said. The Second World War was started by the Jews and the Third World War, whatever it is, is between Israel and the Arab countries. I was there as well. But there&#x27;s going to be a war because the Israelis and the &quot;Bushies&quot; – you know, the bully, the bigot in the United States – tells you that if you&#x27;re not with me you&#x27;re against me.

After the session concluded, the &quot;StarPhoenix&quot; reporter asked him to clarify these remarks, and he explained that while serving in the army after the war, Germans had told him the Jews had provoked the war. The &quot;StarPhoenix&quot; quoted him as further saying:

The Jews damn near owned all of Germany prior to the war. That&#x27;s why Hitler came in. He was going to make damn sure that the Jews didn&#x27;t take over Germany, or even Europe. That&#x27;s why he fried six million of those guys, you know. Jews would have owned the goddamned world. And look what they&#x27;re doing now, they&#x27;re killing people in Arab countries.

The reporter asked how Ahenakew could justify the Holocaust. The &quot;StarPhoenix&quot; quoted Ahenakew as replying:

How else do you get rid of a disease like that, that&#x27;s going to take over, that&#x27;s going to dominate?

=== Public reaction ===
The comments were first circulated in the Canadian national media several days later, and were quickly condemned as antisemitic by Jewish groups, aboriginal leaders and Canadian politicians alike. Both Perry Bellgarde, president of FSIN, and Matthew Coon Come, AFN national chief, were quick to distance themselves from Ahenakew&#x27;s comments.

In June 2003, Ahenakew was formally charged by the Saskatchewan Justice Department with promoting hatred.

In an interview in the July/August 2003 edition of &quot;This Magazine&quot;, Ahenakew expressed to reporter Alex Roslin his dissatisfaction with what he called &quot;racial control&quot; of the media, saying that &quot;when a group of people, a race of people, control the world media, something has to be done about it.&quot; The article also quotes claims that Ahenakew had long held racist beliefs against Jews, Blacks and other ethnic groups, and that those beliefs had been hidden from the public.

In connection with the remarks from 2002, which were recorded on tape with his knowledge, Ahenakew was later convicted in July 2005 of willfully promoting hatred against Jews. Ahenakew apologized for the remarks, saying they did not represent his beliefs and that he was &quot;caught up in the heat of the moment. I was attempting to spark debate on what has been happening to our First Nations people.&quot; At his trial, he later recanted his apology and blamed his outburst on his diabetes, some wine and a change in medication, a defense that was rejected by the court; he was subsequently fined $1,000. Despite this, he retained his belief that the Jews started the Second World War. Jewish groups, aboriginals and politicians later called for Ahenakew&#x27;s membership in the Order of Canada to be revoked. The Governor General revoked Ahenakew&#x27;s membership shortly after his trial.

In June 2006, the conviction was overturned by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench on the grounds that the trial judge failed to properly take into account that the remarks were uttered in the midst of an angry confrontation with a reporter, and therefore may not have constituted a &quot;willful&quot; promotion of hatred. A new trial was ordered.

===Second trial===
Ahenakew was retried in Saskatoon in 2008. In February 2009, Saskatchewan Provincial Court Judge Wilfred Tucker acquitted Ahenakew because his statements, while &quot;revolting, disgusting and untrue&quot; did not show an intent to incite hatred.

==Death==
Ahenakew died on March 12, 2010 from cancer at a hospital in Shellbrook, Saskatchewan, aged 76.

<text>The pericardium (: pericardia), also called pericardial sac, is a double-walled sac containing the heart and the roots of the great vessels. It has two layers, an outer layer made of strong inelastic connective tissue (fibrous pericardium), and an inner layer made of serous membrane (serous pericardium). It encloses the pericardial cavity, which contains pericardial fluid, and defines the middle mediastinum. It separates the heart from interference of other structures, protects it against infection and blunt trauma, and lubricates the heart&#x27;s movements.

The English name originates from the Ancient Greek prefix &quot;peri-&quot; (περί) &#x27;around&#x27; and the suffix &quot;-cardion&quot; (κάρδιον) &#x27;heart&#x27;.

==Anatomy==
The pericardium is a tough fibroelastic sac which covers the heart from all sides except at the cardiac root (where the great vessels join the heart) and the bottom (where only the serous pericardium exists to cover the upper surface of the central tendon of diaphragm). The fibrous pericardium is semi-rigid, while the serous pericardium is quite pliable.

The same mesothelium that constitutes the serous pericardium also covers the heart as the epicardium, resulting in a continuous serous membrane invaginated onto itself as two opposing surfaces (over the fibrous pericardium and over the heart). This creates a pouch-like potential space around the heart enclosed between the two opposing serosal surfaces, known as the pericardial space or pericardial cavity, which is filled with a small amount of serous fluid to lubricate the heart&#x27;s movements and cushions it from any external jerk or shock.

===Fibrous===
The fibrous pericardium is the outside layer of the pericardium, made up of dense and loose connective tissue. While capable of some change in shape, it is largely non-pliable, which acts to protect the heart against blunt forces and sudden pressure change from the outside. It is continuous with the outer adventitial layer of the neighboring great blood vessels, fused with the central fibrous area of the diaphragm on its posterior aspect and attached to the posterior surface of the sternum by the sternopericardial ligaments.

===Serous===
The serous pericardium, in turn, is divided into two parts:
* The &quot;parietal serous pericardium&quot;, which lines the interior side of the superficial portion of the pericardial sac, is fused to and inseparable from the fibrous pericardium
* The &quot;visceral serous pericardium&quot;, also known as the epicardium, covers the myocardium of the heart and can be considered its serosa. It is largely made of a mesothelium overlying some elastin-rich loose connective tissue. During ventricular contraction, the wave of depolarization moves from the endocardial to the epicardial surface.
Both of these layers function in lubricating the heart to prevent friction during heart activity.

The visceral serous pericardium extends to the root of the great vessels and joins the parietal serous pericardium at the anatomical base of the heart. This junction occurs at two areas: the ventricular outflow tracts where the aorta and pulmonary trunk leave the heart, and the inflow tracts where the superior/inferior vena cava and pulmonary veins enter the heart. The root of the great vessels and the associated reflections of the serous pericardium creates various smaller sacs and tunnels known as &quot;pericardial sinuses&quot;, as well as radiographically significant &quot;pericardial recesses&quot;, where pericardial fluid can pool and mimic mediastinal lymphadenopathy.

===Anatomical relationships===

* Surrounds heart and bases of pulmonary artery and aorta.
* Deep to sternum and anterior chest wall.
* The right phrenic nerve passes to the right of the pericardium.
* The left phrenic nerve passes over the pericardium of the left ventricle.
* Pericardial arteries supply blood to the dorsal portion of the pericardium.
==Function==
The pericardium sets the heart in mediastinum and limits its motion, protects it from infection, lubricates it and prevents excessive dilation in cases of acute volume overload.

==Clinical significance==

Inflammation of the pericardium is called pericarditis. This condition typically causes chest pain that spreads to the back and is made worse by lying flat. In patients suffering with pericarditis, a pericardial friction rub can often be heard when listening to the heart with a stethoscope. Pericarditis is often caused by a viral infection (glandular fever, cytomegalovirus, or coxsackievirus), or more rarely with a bacterial infection, but may also occur following a myocardial infarction. Pericarditis is usually a short-lived condition that can be successfully treated with painkillers, anti-inflammatories, and colchicine. In some cases, pericarditis can become a long-term condition causing scarring of the pericardium which restricts the heart&#x27;s movement, known as constrictive pericarditis. Constrictive pericarditis is sometimes treated by surgically removing the pericardium in a procedure called a pericardiectomy.

Fluid can build up within the pericardial space, referred to as a pericardial effusion. Pericardial effusions often occur secondary to pericarditis, kidney failure, or tumours and frequently do not cause any symptoms. Large effusions or effusions that accumulate rapidly can compress the heart and restrict diastolic ventricular filling in a condition known as cardiac tamponade, causing pulsus paradoxus and potentially fatal circulatory failure. Fluid can be removed from the pericardial space for diagnosis or to relieve tamponade using a syringe in a procedure called pericardiocentesis. For cases of recurrent pericardial effusion, an operation to create a hole between the pericardial and pleural spaces can be performed, known as a pericardial window or &quot;pericardiostomy&quot;.

The congenital absence of pericardium is rare. When it happens, it usually occurs on the left side. Those affected usually do not have any symptoms and they are usually discovered incidentally. About 30 to 50 percent of the affected people have other heart abnormalities such as atrial septal defect, patent ductus arteriosus, bicuspid aortic valve, and lung abnormalities. On chest X–ray, the heart looks posteriorly rotated. Another feature is the sharp delineation of pulmonary artery and transverse aorta due to lung deposition between these two structures. If there is partial absence of pericardium, there will be bulge of the left atrial appendage. On CT and MRI scans, similar findings as chest X–ray can be shown. The left sided partial pericardium defect is difficult to see because even a normal pericardium is difficult to be seen on CT and MRI. A complete pericardial defect will show the heart displaced to the left with part of the lungs squeezed between inferior border of heart and diaphragm.

<doc id="244953" wikidata="Q627688" url="?curid=244953" title="Write-ahead logging">
<text>In computer science, write-ahead logging (WAL) is a family of techniques for providing atomicity and durability (two of the ACID properties) in database systems.

A write ahead log is an append-only auxiliary disk-resident structure used for crash and transaction recovery. The changes are first recorded in the log, which must be written to stable storage, before the changes are written to the database.

The main functionality of a write-ahead log can be summarized as:

* Allow the page cache to buffer updates to disk-resident pages while ensuring durability semantics in the larger context of a database system.
* Persist all operations on disk until the cached copies of pages affected by these operations are synchronized on disk. Every operation that modifies the database state has to be logged on disk before the contents on the associated pages can be modified
* Allow lost in-memory changes to be reconstructed from the operation log in case of a crash.

In a system using WAL, all modifications are written to a log before they are applied. Usually both redo and undo information is stored in the log.

The purpose of this can be illustrated by an example. Imagine a program that is in the middle of performing some operation when the machine it is running on loses power. Upon restart, that program might need to know whether the operation it was performing succeeded, succeeded partially, or failed. If a write-ahead log is used, the program can check this log and compare what it was supposed to be doing when it unexpectedly lost power to what was actually done. On the basis of this comparison, the program could decide to undo what it had started, complete what it had started, or keep things as they are.

After a certain amount of operations, the program should perform a checkpoint, writing all the changes specified in the WAL to the database and clearing the log.

WAL allows updates of a database to be done in-place. Another way to implement atomic updates is with shadow paging, which is not in-place. The main advantage of doing updates in-place is that it reduces the need to modify indexes and block lists.

ARIES is a popular algorithm in the WAL family.

Modern file systems typically use a variant of WAL for at least file system metadata; this is called journaling.

<text>USS &quot;George Philip&quot; (FFG-12), sixth ship of the of guided-missile frigates, was named for Commander George Philip Jr. (1912–1945), posthumous recipient of the Navy Cross for actions as commanding officer of the destroyer .

&quot;George Philip&quot; was expected to join the Portuguese Navy in 2006, together with her sister ship , but the Portuguese Navy dropped the offer and chose two Dutch s instead. &quot;George Philip&quot; was expected to join the Turkish Navy in the summer of 2008, together with her sister ship , but the Turkish Navy dropped the offer. As of May 2012, both frigates were awaiting their fates at anchor in the Sinclair Inlet off the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility.

==Namesake==

George Philip Jr. was born on 14 April 1912 in Fort Pierre, South Dakota, to George Philip (18801948), a Scottish immigrant from Morayshire, Scotland and Alice Island &quot;Isle&quot; Waldron (18901972), of part Oglala Lakota descent and also born in Fort Pierre. He was known as Geordie. He attended the South Dakota School of Mines in Rapid City, South Dakota before his appointment to the United States Naval Academy. After completion of the course of instruction at the Naval Academy, he was commissioned an Ensign on 6 June 1935. He continued to progress in grade until his promotion to Commander on 4 September 1944. During this period he served under a variety of commands including: (1935–37), (1937–38), (1938–40), (1942-43). For his service during the Solomon Islands campaign, Philip was awarded the Silver Star Medal and &quot;O&#x27;Bannon&quot; received the Presidential Unit Citation. He then served with Operational Training Command, Pacific Fleet, San Diego, California (1943–44).

He then served as Commanding Officer of (1944–45). On 16 June 1945 while operating off Okinawa &quot;Twiggs&quot; was hit by a Japanese kamikaze aircraft. According to eyewitness Chief Machinist&#x27;s mate Charles F. Schmidt, Commander Philip was last seen mortally wounded, grasping the railing of the bridge trying to stand. Philip and 151 other crewmen were killed or missing when &quot;Twiggs&quot; sank. He was posthumously awarded the Navy Cross. On 12 March 1946, Secretary of the Navy James Forrestal stated, during the presentation of the Navy Cross to his widow, Margaret Taussig-Philip:
 Captain Philip was the son in law of Joseph Taussig, brother in law of Joseph K. Taussig Jr. and uncle of Captain Joseph K. Taussig III USMC.

== History ==
Ordered from Todd Pacific Shipyards, Los Angeles Division, San Pedro, California on 27 February 1976 as part of the FY76 program, &quot;George Philip&quot; was laid down on 14 December 1977, launched on 16 December 1978, and commissioned on 10 October 1980. Decommissioned on 15 March 2003, as of June 2003 &quot;George Philip&quot; was in reserve at Naval Inactive Ships Maintenance Facility Bremerton, Washington.

=== 1980s ===
&quot;George Philip&quot; was sponsored by Snow Philip-Simpson, daughter of the ship&#x27;s namesake, George Philip Jr. at the ship launching on 16 December 1978. &quot;George Philip&quot; was commissioned 15 November 1980 at Todd Shipyard in San Pedro, California.

From November 1980 to June 1981 &quot;George Philip&quot; conducted sea trials and testing. In June 1981 the ship received the Battle &quot;E&quot; award for excellence.

From July 1982 to February 1983 &quot;George Philip&quot; deployed for the first time in support of battle group. &quot;George Philip&quot; and her crew were awarded a Battle Effectiveness Award for operations during the 18-month period from 1 January 1982 to 30 June 1983.

From September 1984 to March 1985 the ship was deployed in support of U. S. efforts to keep sea lanes open in the Persian Gulf during the height of the Iran–Iraq War. In June 1985 the frigate transferred to the Naval Reserve Force (NRF). As a member of the NRF, the focus turns to the training and readiness of Selected Reservists. The ship goes from full manning to 60% manning, with the remainder made up of Reservists. From June 1985 to June 1987 engineering and weapons readiness examinations and inspections were performed along with training for helicopter pilots.

&quot;George Philip&quot; underwent an overhaul at Southwest Marine in San Diego, California from December 1987 to June 1989. While in overhaul the ship received major upgrades in anti-submarine warfare (ASW) capabilities among which, the ship was fitted with a Tactical Towed Array Sonar (TACTASS).

From June 1989 to May 1992 &quot;George Philip&quot; participated in extensive ASW operations and was used as a test platform for the new ASW equipment.

=== 1990s ===
From May to August 1992 &quot;George Philip&quot; was deployed in support of efforts to counter drug traffic from South America to the United States. In August 1992 the ship began a series of independent operations and port visits that included: San Francisco; Seattle; Vancouver, British Columbia; and Mazatlán, Mexico.

These operations lasted until July 1994 when &quot;George Philip&quot; deployed in support of efforts to counter drug traffic from South America to the United States. In October 1994 the frigate was escort to the towing of the retired submarine to Bremerton Naval Station.

&quot;George Philip&quot; and her crew were awarded a Battle Effectiveness Award for operations in 1994, 1995 and 1996.

In November 1997 the ship participated in the Maritime Combined Operational Training (MARCOT) Exercise in the Northern Pacific. From January to April 1998 &quot;George Philip&quot; took part in counter-narcotics operations (CNOPS) in the South Pacific.

From March to October 1999 the ship was assigned to the Co-operation Afloat Readiness and Training (CARAT) Deployment.

=== 2000s ===
&quot;George Philip&quot; underwent the Dry-Docking Selected Restricted Availability (DSRA 00) at Continental Marine in San Diego from January to March 2000 In April &quot;George Philip&quot; transited to Alaska. The frigate conducted port visits to Esquimalt, British Columbia and Juneau, Alaska. On 2–8 October 2000 the ship made a port visit to Ensenada, Mexico.

&quot;George Philip&quot; was decommissioned on 15 March 2003, as of June 2003 the ship was in reserve at Puget Sound Naval Shipyard and Intermediate Maintenance Facility, Bremerton, Washington.

<doc id="244980" wikidata="Q862296" url="?curid=244980" title="Chromista">
<text>Chromista is a proposed but polyphyletic biological kingdom, refined from the Chromalveolata, consisting of single-celled and multicellular eukaryotic species that share similar features in their photosynthetic organelles (plastids). It includes all eukaryotes whose plastids contain chlorophyll &quot;c&quot; and are surrounded by four membranes. If the ancestor already possessed chloroplasts derived by endosymbiosis from red algae, all non-photosynthetic Chromista have secondarily lost the ability to photosynthesise. Its members might have arisen independently as separate evolutionary groups from the last eukaryotic common ancestor.

Chromista as a taxon was created by the British biologist Thomas Cavalier-Smith in 1981 to distinguish the stramenopiles, haptophytes, and cryptophytes. According to Cavalier-Smith, the kingdom originally consisted mostly of photosynthetic eukaryotes (algae), but he later brought many heterotrophs (protozoa) into the proposed group. As of 2018, the kingdom was nearly as diverse as the kingdoms Plantae and Animalia, consisting of eight phyla. Notable members include marine algae, potato blight, dinoflagellates, &quot;Paramecium&quot;, the brain parasite &quot;Toxoplasma,&quot; and the malarial parasite &quot;Plasmodium&quot;.

However, Cavalier-Smith&#x27;s hypothesis of chromist monophyly has been rejected by other researchers, who consider it more likely that some chromists acquired their plastids by incorporating another chromist instead of inheriting them from a common ancestor. This is thought to have occurred repeatedly, so that the red plastids spread from one group to another. The plastids, far from characterising their hosts as belonging to a single clade, thus have a different history from their disparate hosts. They appear to have originated in the Rhodophytina, and to have been transmitted to the Cryptophytina and from them to both the Ochrophyta and the Haptophyta, and then from these last to the Myzozoa.

==Biology==

Members of Chromista are single-celled and multicellular eukaryotes having basically either or both features:

# plastid(s) that contain chlorophyll &quot;c&quot; and lie within an extra (periplastid) membrane in the lumen of the rough endoplasmic reticulum (typically within the perinuclear cisterna);
# cilia with tripartite or bipartite rigid tubular hairs.

The kingdom includes diverse organisms from algae to malarial parasites (&quot;Plasmodium&quot;). Molecular evidence indicates that the plastids in chromists were derived from red algae through secondary symbiogenesis in a single event. In contrast, plants acquired their plastids from cyanobacteria through primary symbiogenesis. These plastids are now enclosed in two extra cell membranes, making a four-membrane envelope, as a result of which they acquired many other membrane proteins for transporting molecules in and out of the organelles. The diversity of chromists is hypothesised to have arisen from degeneration, loss or replacement of the plastids in some lineages. Additional symbiogenesis of green algae has provided genes retained in some members (such as heterokonts), and bacterial chlorophyll (indicated by the presence of ribosomal protein L36 gene, &quot;rpl36&quot;) in haptophytes and cryptophytes.

==History and groups==

Some examples of classification of the groups involved, which have overlapping but non-identical memberships, are shown below.

===Chromophycées (Chadefaud, 1950)===

The Chromophycées (Chadefaud, 1950), renamed Chromophycota (Chadefaud, 1960), included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta (included in Chrysophyceae until Christensen, 1962), Cryptophyta, Dinophyta, Euglenophyceae and Choanoflagellida (included in Chrysophyceae until Hibberd, 1975).

===Chromophyta (Christensen 1962, 1989)===

The Chromophyta (Christensen 1962, 2008), defined as algae with chlorophyll c, included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta, Cryptophyta, Dinophyta and Choanoflagellida. The Euglenophyceae were transferred to the Chlorophyta.

===Chromophyta (Bourrelly, 1968)===

The Chromophyta (Bourrelly, 1968) included the current Ochrophyta (autotrophic Stramenopiles), Haptophyta and Choanoflagellida. The Cryptophyceae and the Dinophyceae were part of Pyrrhophyta (= Dinophyta).

===Chromista (Cavalier-Smith, 1981)===

The name Chromista was first introduced by Cavalier-Smith in 1981; the earlier names Chromophyta, Chromobiota and Chromobionta correspond to roughly the same group. It has been described as consisting of three different groups: It includes all protists whose plastids contain chlorophyll &quot;c&quot;.

* Heterokonts or Stramenopiles: brown algae, diatoms, water moulds, etc.
* Haptophytes
* Cryptomonads

In 1994, Cavalier-Smith and colleagues indicated that the Chromista is probably a polyphyletic group whose members arose independently, sharing no more than descent from the common ancestor of all eukaryotes:

In 2009, Cavalier-Smith gave his reason for making a new kingdom, saying:
 
Since then Chromista has been defined in different ways at different times. In 2010, Cavalier-Smith reorganised Chromista to include the SAR supergroup (named for the included groups Stramenopiles, Alveolata and Rhizaria) and Hacrobia (Haptista and Cryptista).

Patron &quot;et al&quot;. (2004) considered the presence of a unique class of FBA (fructose-1,6-biophosphate-aldolase) enzyme not similar to that found in plants as evidence of chromist monophyly. Fast &quot;et al&quot;. (2001) supported a single origin for the myzozoan (dinoflagellate + apicomplexan), heterokont and cryptophyte plastids based on their comparison of GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase) genes. Harper &amp; Keeling (2003) described haptophyte homologs and considered them further evidence of a single endosymbiotic event involving the ancestor of all chromists.

===Chromalveolata (Adl &quot;et al&quot;., 2005)===
The Chromalveolata included Stramenopiles, Haptophyta, Cryptophyta and Alveolata. However, in 2008 the group was found not to be monophyletic, and later studies confirmed this.

== Classification ==

=== Cavalier-Smith &quot;et al&quot;. 2015 ===

In 2015, Cavalier-Smith and his colleagues made a new higher-level grouping of all organisms as a revision of the seven kingdoms model. In it, they classified the kingdom Chromista into 2 subkingdoms and 11 phyla, namely:

=== Cavalier-Smith 2018 ===

Cavalier-Smith made a new analysis of Chromista in 2018 in which he classified all chromists into 8 phyla (Gyrista corresponds to the above phyla Ochrophyta and Pseudofungi, Cryptista corresponds to the above phyla Cryptista and &quot;N.N.&quot;, Haptista corresponds to the above phyla Haptophyta and Heliozoa):

== Polyphyly and serial endosymbiosis ==

Molecular trees have had difficulty resolving relationships between the different groups. All three may share a common ancestor with the alveolates (see chromalveolates), but there is evidence that suggests the haptophytes and cryptomonads do not belong together with the heterokonts or the SAR clade, but may be associated with the Archaeplastida. Cryptista specifically may be sister or part of Archaeplastida, though this could be an artefact due to acquisition of genes from red algae by cryptomonads.

A 2020 phylogeny of the eukaryotes states that &quot;the chromalveolate hypothesis is not widely accepted&quot; (noting Cavalier-Smith et al 2018 as an exception), explaining that the host lineages do not appear to be closely related in &quot;most phylogenetic analyses&quot;. Further, none of TSAR, Cryptista, and Haptista, groups formerly within Chromalveolata, appear &quot;likely to be ancestrally defined by red secondary plastids&quot;. This is because of the many non-photosynthetic organisms related to the groups with chlorophyll &quot;c&quot;, and the possibility that cryptophytes are more closely related to plants.

The alternative to monophyly is serial endosymbiosis, meaning that the &quot;chromists&quot; acquired their plastids from each other instead of inheriting them from a single common ancestor. Thus the phylogeny of the distinctive plastids, which are agreed to have a common origin in the rhodophytes, is different from the phylogeny of the host cells. In 2021, Jürgen Strassert and colleagues modelled the timelines for the presumed spread of the red plastids, concluding that &quot;the hypotheses of serial endosymbiosis are chronologically possible, as the stem lineages of all red plastid-containing groups overlap in time&quot; during the Mesoproterozoic and Neoproterozoic eras. They propose that the plastids were transmitted between groups as follows:

::: Rhodophytina → Cryptophytina → Ochrophyta
:::::::::::: ↘ Haptophyta → Myzozoa

<text>GEnie (General Electric Network for Information Exchange) was an online service created by a General Electric business, GEIS (now GXS), that ran from 1985 through the end of 1999. In 1994, GEnie claimed around 350,000 users. Peak simultaneous usage was around 10,000 users. It was one of the pioneering services in the field, though eventually replaced by the World Wide Web and graphics-based services, most notably AOL.

== Early history ==

GEnie was founded by Bill Louden on October 1, 1985 and was launched as an ASCII text-based service by GE&#x27;s Information Services division in October 1985, and received attention as the first serious commercial competition to CompuServe. Louden was originally CompuServe&#x27;s product manager for Computing, Community (forums), Games, eCommerce, and email product lines. Louden purchased DECWAR source code and had &quot;MegaWars&quot; developed, one of the earliest multi-player online games (or MMOG), in 1985.

The service was run by General Electric Information Services (GEIS, now GXS) based in Rockville, Maryland. GEIS served a diverse set of large-scale, international, commercial network-based custom application needs, including banking, electronic data interchange and e-mail services to companies worldwide, but was able to run GEnie on their many GE Mark III time-sharing mainframe computers that otherwise would have been underutilized after normal U.S. business hours. This orientation was part of GEnie&#x27;s downfall. Although it became very popular and a national force in the on-line marketplace, GEnie was not allowed to grow. GEIS executives steadfastly refused to view the service as anything but &quot;fill in&quot; load and would not expand the network by a single phone line, let alone expand mainframe capacity, to accommodate GEnie&#x27;s growing user base. (Later, however, GE did consent to make the service available through the SprintNet time-sharing network, which had its own dial-up points of presence; an Internet-to-SprintNet gateway operated by Merit Network also made the text-based parts of the service available through telnet.)

The initial price for connection, at both 300 bits per second and the then-high-speed 1,200 bits per second, was $5–6 per hour during &quot;non-prime-time&quot; hours (evenings and weekends) and $36 an hour (to discourage daytime use) otherwise, later adjusted to $6 per hour and $18 per hour, respectively. A speed of 2,400 bit/s was also available at a premium. Later, GEnie developed the Star*Services package, soon renamed Genie*Basic after Prodigy threatened a trademark lawsuit over the use of the word &quot;Star&quot;. It offered a set of &quot;unlimited use&quot; features for $4.95 per month. Other services cost extra, mirroring the tiered service model popular at the time.

GEnie&#x27;s forums were called RoundTables (RTs), and each, as well as other internal services, had a page number associated with it, akin to a Web address today; typing &quot;m 1335&quot;, for instance, would bring you to the GemStone III game page. The service included RTs, games, mail and shopping. For some time, GEnie published a bimonthly print magazine, &quot;LiveWire&quot;. GEnie&#x27;s early chat room was called the LiveWire CB Simulator, after the citizens&#x27; band radios popular at the time.

== Games ==

GEnie had a reputation for being the home of excellent online text games, similar to the &quot;doorway&quot; games on bulletin board systems but often massively multiplayer. Also, there were graphical games using then-state-of-the-art non-textured 3D graphics on PCs with VGA displays. Top titles included:
* Kesmai&#x27;s &quot;Air Warrior&quot; (3D graphics)
* Simutronics&#x27;s &quot;GemStone&quot;, later &quot;GemStone III&quot;
* AUSI&#x27;s &quot;Dragon&#x27;s Gate&quot;
* Simutronics&#x27; &quot;CyberStrike&quot; (3D graphics—later spun off and expanded into the stand-alone &quot;CyberStrike 2&quot;, with textured 3D graphics, lighting effects, etc.)
* Kesmai&#x27;s &quot;Multiplayer BattleTech: EGA&quot;

Other major titles included:
* AUSI&#x27;s &quot;Galaxy II&quot;
* &quot;NTN Trivia&quot;
* Kesmai&#x27;s &quot;Stellar Warrior&quot;—GEnie&#x27;s first multiplayer online game
* Kesmai&#x27;s &quot;Stellar Emperor&quot;—the GEnie version of Kesmai&#x27;s Compuserve game &quot;MegaWars III&quot;
* J. Weaver Jr.&#x27;s &quot;RSCARDS&quot;
* Jim Dunnigan&#x27;s &quot;Hundred Years&#x27; War&quot;
* Simutronics&#x27; &quot;DragonRealms&quot;
* Simutronics&#x27; &quot;Orb Wars&quot;
* Federation II
* Simutronics&#x27; &quot;Modus Operandi&quot;
* &quot;A-Maze-ing&quot;
* &quot;Diplomacy Online&quot;
* Holtzman and Kershenblatt&#x27;s &quot;Castlequest&quot; (credited to publisher Bob Maples) 

== RoundTables ==

A RoundTable on GEnie was a discussion area containing a message board (&quot;BBS&quot;), a chatroom (&quot;RealTime Conference&quot; or RTC) and a Library for permanent files. They were part of an online community culture that predated the Internet&#x27;s emergence as a mass medium, which also included such separate entities as CompuServe forums, Usenet newsgroups and email mailing lists.

Most RoundTables were actually operated not by GEnie employees but by remote working independent contractors, which was standard practice for online services at the time. The contractors received royalties on time spent in their forums. In the most popular forums, this revenue stream was often substantial enough to hire one or two part-time or full-time staffers. Many RoundTables also had a number of unpaid assistants, working for a &quot;free flag&quot; (which granted them free access to that RoundTable) or an &quot;internal account&quot; (which granted free access to all of the service).

==Rise and fall==
By May 1986, GEnie claimed to have 12,000 subscribers, up from 3,000 in February. Although it for years was the second-largest service provider after CompuServe, GEnie failed to keep up when Prodigy and America Online produced graphics-based online services that drew the masses. Programs such as Aladdin, which had been developed earlier by an independent developer and eventually supported by GEnie, helped many of the newcomers who came to GEnie from Prodigy and AOL adjust; these were the equivalent of modern-day email programs and newsreaders, incorporating a more user-friendly interface which automated message and mail downloading and posting.

In addition, GEnie took its time developing an Internet e-mail gateway, which opened on July 1, 1993.

GE sold GEnie in 1996 to Yovelle, which was later taken over by IDT Corp. IDT attempted to transition GEnie (now branded &quot;Genie&quot; without the all-uppercase &quot;GE&quot;) to an Internet service provider, but ultimately failed. IDT also funded the development of a GUI for the text-based service; this client was actually released, but the service did not survive long enough for it to become popular.

Visitors to GEnie dropped with the growth of other online services and fell dramatically following a very sudden change in the fee structure in 1996. The users were notified with only 12 hours&#x27; notice that all Basic (flat-rate) services would cease to exist, while prices of the other services would rise dramatically. By the final year, insiders reported fewer than 10,000 total users.

On December 4, 1999, it was announced that GEnie would close for good on December 27 due to the year 2000 problem. Remaining users gathered in chat areas of the few RoundTables remaining to say goodbye. But GEnie did not close for four more days, and a dwindling number watched at the close of each day. The RoundTables and all areas of GEnie, except the Top page, became unavailable slightly before midnight on December 30, 1999.

==Legacy==
Several books, TV shows, films and other projects had their genesis and inspiration on GEnie. One example is the &quot;Babylon 5&quot; television show, created by J. Michael Straczynski, which was first announced publicly in GEnie&#x27;s Science Fiction RoundTables. The SFRTs served as the show&#x27;s first online &quot;home&quot; and were the source of many in-jokes and references throughout its run.

Bill Louden, the original creator of GEnie, formed a group of investors to buy the Delphi online service from News Corp, where he led the transition of the service from text-only to the Web (and from a pay-per-hour to an advertising-supported revenue model).

==Notable users==
Many well-known personalities were early adopters of the online medium, and were a prominent presence on GEnie, either active in one of its RoundTables, or frequent public participants in GEnie&#x27;s CB Chat.

* Tom Clancy, author, participated in the chat area and he played games such as &quot;GemStone II&quot; with his children.
* Peter David, self-styled &quot;writer of stuff&quot;, such as comic books, television and film novelizations, screenwriting and many original novels and short stories
* Cory Doctorow, co-author of the Boing Boing blog and science fiction novelist, was active on GEnie&#x27;s Science Fiction RoundTable
* Damon Knight, author, founder of Science Fiction Writers of America, SFWA Grand Master
* Wayne Knight, actor (&quot;Seinfeld&quot;, &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;), was an occasional visitor to the ShowBiz RT
* Michael Okuda, &quot;Star Trek&quot; graphics designer frequented the SFRT
* Richard Pini, husband of Wendy Pini, and editor/publisher of her cult favorite fantasy (with SF elements) comic book series &quot;ElfQuest&quot;.
* Daniel Pinkwater, frequent presence in Writer&#x27;s Ink
* Jerry Pournelle, science fiction author and political commentator, had his own RoundTable.
* J. Michael Straczynski, television writer, producer and creator of &quot;Babylon 5&quot;
* Wil Wheaton, current &quot;geek author&quot; and actor (Wesley in &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot;), was a frequent presence in the chat area, and often visited the Sports RoundTable.

The Science Fiction RoundTable (SFRT) became the official online forum of the Science Fiction Writers of America (SFWA), which led a number of science fiction writers to join GEnie. Besides those already mentioned, they included Dafydd ab Hugh, John Barnes, Keith DeCandido, Steven Brust, Michael A. Burstein, Debra Doyle, Neil Gaiman, Joe Haldeman, Katharine Kerr, Michael Kube-McDowell, Paul Levinson, George R.R. Martin, Rich Normandie, Raven Oak, Mike Resnick, Robert J. Sawyer, J. Neil Schulman, Josepha Sherman, Susan Shwartz, Martha Soukup, Michael Swanwick, Judith Tarr, Harry Turtledove, Lawrence Watt-Evans, Leslie What, and Jane Yolen. Occasional but less frequent visitors included K. W. Jeter and Ken Grimwood. Science fiction editors Gardner Dozois, Scott Edelman, Peter Heck, Tappan King, Beth Meacham, Patrick Nielsen Hayden, Teresa Nielsen Hayden, Sheila Finch and Dean Wesley Smith were also frequent participants.

<text>The Oomycetes (), or Oomycota, form a distinct phylogenetic lineage of fungus-like eukaryotic microorganisms within the Stramenopiles. They are filamentous and heterotrophic, and can reproduce both sexually and asexually. Sexual reproduction of an oospore is the result of contact between hyphae of male antheridia and female oogonia; these spores can overwinter and are known as resting spores. Asexual reproduction involves the formation of chlamydospores and sporangia, producing motile zoospores. Oomycetes occupy both saprophytic and pathogenic lifestyles, and include some of the most notorious pathogens of plants, causing devastating diseases such as late blight of potato and sudden oak death. One oomycete, the mycoparasite &quot;Pythium oligandrum&quot;, is used for biocontrol, attacking plant pathogenic fungi. The oomycetes are also often referred to as water molds (or water moulds), although the water-preferring nature which led to that name is not true of most species, which are terrestrial pathogens.

Oomycetes were originally grouped with fungi due to similarities in morphology and lifestyle. However, molecular and phylogenetic studies revealed significant differences between fungi and oomycetes which means the latter are now grouped with the stramenopiles (which include some types of algae). The Oomycota have a very sparse fossil record; a possible oomycete has been described from Cretaceous amber.

== Etymology ==
Oomycota comes from &quot;&quot; () and &quot;&quot; (), referring to the large round oogonia, structures containing the female gametes, that are characteristic of the oomycetes. 

The name &quot;water mold&quot; refers to their earlier classification as fungi and their preference for conditions of high humidity and running surface water, which is characteristic for the basal taxa of the oomycetes.

== Morphology ==
The oomycetes rarely have septa (see hypha), and if they do, they are scarce, appearing at the bases of sporangia, and sometimes in older parts of the filaments. Some are unicellular, while others are filamentous and branching.
== Classification ==


Previously the group was arranged into six orders.
* The Saprolegniales are the most widespread. Many break down decaying matter; others are parasites.
* The Leptomitales have wall thickenings that give their continuous cell body the appearance of septation. They bear chitin and often reproduce asexually.
* The Rhipidiales use rhizoids to attach their thallus to the bed of stagnant or polluted water bodies.
* The Albuginales are considered by some authors to be a family (Albuginaceae) within the Peronosporales, although it has been shown that they are phylogenetically distinct from this order.
* The Peronosporales too are mainly saprophytic or parasitic on plants, and have an aseptate, branching form. Many of the most damaging agricultural parasites belong to this order.
* The Lagenidiales are the most primitive; some are filamentous, others unicellular; they are generally parasitic.

However more recently this has been expanded considerably.

==Phylogenetic relationships==


===Internal===

===External===

This group was originally classified among the fungi (the name &quot;oomycota&quot; means &quot;egg fungus&quot;) and later treated as protists, based on general morphology and lifestyle. A cladistic analysis based on modern discoveries about the biology of these organisms supports a relatively close relationship with some photosynthetic organisms, such as brown algae and diatoms. A common taxonomic classification based on these data, places the class Oomycota along with other classes such as Phaeophyceae (brown algae) within the phylum Heterokonta.

This relationship is supported by a number of observed differences between the characteristics of oomycetes and fungi. For instance, the cell walls of oomycetes are composed of cellulose rather than chitin and generally do not have septations. Also, in the vegetative state they have diploid nuclei, whereas fungi have haploid nuclei. Most oomycetes produce self-motile zoospores with two flagella. One flagellum has a &quot;whiplash&quot; morphology, and the other a branched &quot;tinsel&quot; morphology. The &quot;tinsel&quot; flagellum is unique to the Kingdom Heterokonta. Spores of the few fungal groups which retain flagella (such as the Chytridiomycetes) have only one whiplash flagellum. Oomycota and fungi have different metabolic pathways for synthesizing lysine and have a number of enzymes that differ. The ultrastructure is also different, with oomycota having tubular mitochondrial cristae and fungi having flattened cristae.

In spite of this, many species of oomycetes are still described or listed as types of fungi and may sometimes be referred to as pseudo fungi, or lower fungi.

== Biology ==
=== Reproduction ===

Most of the oomycetes produce two distinct types of spores. The main dispersive spores are asexual, self-motile spores called zoospores, which are capable of chemotaxis (movement toward or away from a chemical signal, such as those released by potential food sources) in surface water (including precipitation on plant surfaces). A few oomycetes produce aerial asexual spores that are distributed by wind. They also produce sexual spores, called oospores, that are translucent, double-walled, spherical structures used to survive adverse environmental conditions.

=== Ecology and pathogenicity ===


Many oomycetes species are economically important, aggressive algae and plant pathogens. Some species can cause disease in fish, and at least one is a pathogen of mammals. The majority of the plant pathogenic species can be classified into four groups, although more exist.

* The &quot;Phytophthora&quot; group is a paraphyletic genus that causes diseases such as dieback, late blight in potatoes (the cause of the Great Famine of the 1840s that ravaged Ireland and other parts of Europe), sudden oak death, rhododendron root rot, and ink disease in the European chestnut
* The paraphyletic &quot;Pythium&quot; group is more prevalent than &quot;Phytophthora&quot; and individual species have larger host ranges, although usually causing less damage. &quot;Pythium&quot; damping off is a very common problem in greenhouses, where the organism kills newly emerged seedlings. Mycoparasitic members of this group (e.g. &quot;P. oligandrum&quot;) parasitize other oomycetes and fungi, and have been employed as biocontrol agents. One &quot;Pythium&quot; species, &quot;Pythium insidiosum&quot;, also causes Pythiosis in mammals.
* The third group are the downy mildews, which are easily identifiable by the appearance of white, brownish or olive &quot;mildew&quot; on the leaf undersides (although this group can be confused with the unrelated fungal powdery mildews).
* The fourth group are the white blister rusts, Albuginales, which cause white blister disease on a variety of flowering plants. White blister rusts sporulate beneath the epidermis of their hosts, causing spore-filled blisters on stems, leaves and the inflorescence. The Albuginales are currently divided into three genera, &quot;Albugo&quot; parasitic predominantly to Brassicales, &quot;Pustula&quot;, parasitic predominantly to Asterales, and &quot;Wilsoniana&quot;, predominantly parasitic to Caryophyllales. Like the downy mildews, the white blister rusts are obligate biotrophs, which means that they are unable to survive without the presence of a living host.

<doc id="244999" wikidata="Q1430248" url="?curid=244999" title="Road crew">
<text>The road crew (also known as roadies) are the support personnel who travel with an artist or band on tour, usually in sleeper buses, and handle every part of the concert productions except actually performing the music with the musicians. This catch-all term covers many people: tour managers, production managers, stage managers, front of house and monitor engineers, lighting directors, lighting designers, lighting techs, guitar techs, bass techs, drum techs, keyboard techs, pyrotechnicians, security/bodyguards, truck drivers, merchandise crew, and caterers, among others.

==Road crew appearances==
The road crew are generally uncredited, though many bands take care to thank their crew in album sleeve liner notes. In some cases, roadies have stepped in to help out with playing onstage. It is common for guitar, bass and drum technicians (who are responsible for setting up instruments and sound checking them) to be skilled musicians in their own right, and they are naturally familiar with the music being played, so there are many cases where they have stepped in when band members have been injured or otherwise could not perform.

*On June 12, 1993, while performing &quot;Bullet in the Head&quot; in Reykjavik, Iceland, Rage Against the Machine guitarist Tom Morello and bassist Tim Commerford switched out with their guitar and bass technicians, respectively.
*The Doobie Brothers&#x27; lighting roadie, Bobby LaKind, eventually became a full member of the band. After observing LaKind goofing around on the congas after a concert, the band took notice of his talent and asked him to join as a sideman for studio sessions in 1976. He became a full member in 1979 and performed as a vocalist, songwriter, percussionist and backup drummer for live shows.
*Pink Floyd listed theirs on the rear sleeve of &quot;Ummagumma&quot; and recorded them speaking on &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot;. A roadie also delivered the spoken part of the studio version of the song &quot;Sheep&quot;, on the &quot;Animals&quot; album. They had also written a song called &quot;Alan&#x27;s Psychedelic Breakfast&quot; about a roadie, appearing on their 1970 album &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;.
* Bruce Berry was a professional roadie for the members of Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, both as a group and individually. He died of a heroin overdose on June 4, 1973, and is immortalized in the lyrics of the title track of the album &quot;Tonight&#x27;s the Night&quot; by Neil Young: &quot;Bruce Berry was a working man / He used to load that Econoline van...&quot;
*Pantera, Motörhead and Godsmack even go so far as to feature their crew in their tour videos, and Motörhead wrote the song &quot;(We Are) The Road Crew&quot; about their crew.
* Exceptionally, in the former Manu Chao band Mano Negra, the roadies were included as a part of the band when they signed for Virgin.
*Two songs were written about roadie, Ben Dorcy. These were &quot;Ode to Ben Dorcy&quot; by Waylon Jennings and &quot;Big Ben Dorcy the Third&quot; by Red Sovine.
*Todd Rundgren and Roger Powell invited roadie Jan Michael Alejandro to play piano with them, Ringo Starr and Bill Wyman on a live broadcast of the Jerry Lewis Telethon in Las Vegas. It was viewed by 33 million people. He also worked the last Led Zeppelin concert in Knebworth 1979, and he was one of the roadies that Jackson Browne wrote about on the Running on Empty Tour. Jan owns Jan-Al Cases with his partner Muffie Alejandro.
*Jackson Browne on his 1977 tour, &quot;Running on Empty&quot;, wrote his famous song &quot;The Load-Out&quot; (usually heard in a live version hybrid with a cover of the Maurice Williams tune &quot;Stay&quot;) in order to honor his roadies.
*Perry Bamonte was a long-serving guitar tech for The Cure, before filling in on keyboards during the final leg of the Disintegration tour after Roger O&#x27;Donnell&#x27;s departure in 1991. He went on to play guitar and keyboards on four Cure albums, including major hit &quot;Wish&quot;.
* Coldplay&#x27;s video &quot;Life in Technicolor ii&quot; features roadie puppets four times: picking up the cymbal dropped by the drummer, operating the rope that widens the stage, moving a ramp onstage and operating the sound mixer.
* Tupac Shakur joined Digital Underground as a roadie, backup singer and dancer in 1990, and appeared with the band in the film &quot;Nothing but Trouble&quot; to begin his rapping career.
* U2&#x27;s &quot;One Tree Hill&quot; on the album &quot;The Joshua Tree&quot; is dedicated to Greg Carroll, who was a stagehand in New Zealand. He joined The Unforgettable Fire tour, and after the tour he stayed in Ireland and became Bono&#x27;s personal assistant.
* Stuart Morgan, Adam Clayton&#x27;s bass tech, filled in for the U2 bassist for a concert in Sydney in 1993.
* James Hetfield of Metallica has been—at least twice—temporarily replaced in his guitar duties by his roadie John Marshall (himself a guitarist for Metal Church) during his various injuries (such as breaking his arm while skateboarding and after suffering severe burns after standing over a pyrotechnical device).
* In their 2007 DVD &quot;All Excess&quot;, Avenged Sevenfold brings much attention to roadies Jason and Matt Berry, noting their relationship with the band and their antics while the band is on tour.
* Tenacious D wrote the song “Roadie” on their 2012 &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot; album to pay homage to their road crew. A video for the song featured Danny McBride as a stereotypical, long hair, black leather wearing roadie who grew jealous of the band as he watched their success from the sidelines.
* Violinist Lindsey Stirling starts off her show by introducing every crew member. Moreover, she records videos of interactions within the tour crew and puts them on YouTube.
* A picture of The Allman Brothers Band roadies appears on the back cover of their &quot;At Fillmore East&quot; album.
* In 2015, Built to Spill roadies Jason Albertini and Stephen Gere became the bassist and drummer, respectively, on the album &quot;Untethered Moon&quot;.
*Kasabian&#x27;s 2017 album &quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot; features their roadie Rick Graham on the front cover.

<text>Fina Air was an airline based in San Juan, Puerto Rico named after Josefina Canto who was the mother of Lazaro Canto. It operated charter flights to the Dominican Republic from Luis Muñoz Marín International Airport in San Juan, Rafael Hernández Airport in Aguadilla and Eugenio María de Hostos Airport in Mayagüez. The airline has now ceased operations.

==History==
The airline was established in 2003 by Lazaro Canto (Founder and Chief Executive). In the June 7 edition of the newspaper El Vocero, the management of Fina Air announced that the airline would begin flying on July 15, 2003, connecting San Juan and Mayagüez with six Dominican Republic destinations. The airline planned to expand to other countries within the Caribbean by 2005 and acquire jet aircraft. The July 15 date, however, was later changed to October 2. The 2005 expectations for acquiring jets and opening new routes were never met.

==Services==
Apart from operating regularly scheduled services from Aguadilla, they also rented airplanes to United States immigration services, to return illegal immigrants from the Dominican Republic back home.

Fina Air was partnered with the U.S. group called Viva Airlines. The people involved left a list of unpaid debts, lawsuits, and unhappy investors after the death of Chief Executive Officer Lazaro Canto.

==Fleet==
The Fina Air fleet of 3 Saab 340 aircraft have been purchased by an aircraft leasing company and were later operated by RegionsAir as Continental Connection, flying out of Cleveland. The airline did try to purchase 2 McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30 aircraft but the purchase was cancelled. After several flights cancelled from July to August 2005, the airline Fina Air conducted an activity in the Dominican Republic to compensate customers affected in the months of December and January, which granted money in cash awards and added works of art by members of the Oro Sólido music band and by Johnny Ventura, all customers signed documents stating that they were pleased with the agreed compensation.

One of Fina Air&#x27;s SAAB 340 airplanes later crashed in Argentina, as Sol Líneas Aéreas Flight 5428.

==Livery==
Because Puerto Rico is politically a part of the United States, Fina Air (not to be confused with the cargo airline Fine Air), had the American flag painted on their planes&#x27; fuselages. However, most of Fina Air planes carried the colors of the Puerto Rican flag.</text><links>

<doc id="245021" wikidata="Q569915" url="?curid=245021" title="Message delivery agent">
<text>A message delivery agent (MDA), or mail delivery agent, is a computer software component that is responsible for the delivery of e-mail messages to a local recipient&#x27;s mailbox. It is also called a local delivery agent (LDA).

Within the Internet mail architecture, local message delivery is achieved through a process of handling messages from the message transfer agent, and storing mail into the recipient&#x27;s environment (typically a mailbox).

==Implementation==

Many mail handling software products bundle multiple message delivery agents with the message transfer agent component, providing for site customization of the specifics of mail delivery to a user.

=== Unix ===

On Unix-like systems, procmail and maildrop are the most popular MDAs. The Local Mail Transfer Protocol (LMTP) is a protocol that is frequently implemented by network-aware MDAs.

==== Invocation ====

The mail delivery agent is generally not started from the command line, but is usually invoked by mail delivery subsystems, such as a mail transport agent, or a mail retrieval agent.

=== Unix-like ===
* Cyrus IMAP - A mail server suite that includes a mail delivery agent
* dovecot - A mail server suite that includes a mail delivery agent
* fetchmail - Primarily a Mail retrieval agent (MRA)
* getmail - simpler, more secure, modern fetchmail alternative
* fdm — modern replacement for both fetchmail and procmail from the author of tmux
* maildrop or courier-maildrop - traditional procmail replacement, part of Courier Mail Server, but can also be used with other mail servers
* procmail - old, but still used
* bin/mail, the MDA part of Sendmail - Sendmail is one of the oldest email packages
* Sieve mail filtering language - a standardised mail filtering language; also, a modern replacement for procmail from the GNU Mailutils package

==See also==
* Message transfer agent (MTA)
* Mail retrieval agent (MRA)
* Message submission agent (MSA)
* Message user agent (MUA) a.k.a. email client
* E-mail agent (infrastructure) (MxA)

<doc id="245022" wikidata="Q314929" url="?curid=245022" title="Dick Francis">
<text>Richard Stanley Francis (31 October 1920 – 14 February 2010) was a British steeplechase jockey and crime writer whose novels centre on horse racing in England.

After wartime service in the RAF, Francis became a full-time jump-jockey, winning over 350 races and becoming champion jockey of the British National Hunt. He came to further prominence in 1956 as jockey to Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, riding her horse Devon Loch which fell when close to winning the Grand National. Francis retired from the turf and became a journalist and novelist.

Many of his novels deal with crime in the horse-racing world, with some of the criminals being outwardly respectable figures. The stories are narrated by the main character, often a jockey, but sometimes a trainer, an owner, a bookie, or someone in a different profession, peripherally linked to racing. This person always faces great obstacles, often including physical injury. More than forty of these novels became international best-sellers.

== Personal life ==
Francis was born in Coedcanlas, Pembrokeshire, Wales. Some sources report his birthplace as the inland town of Lawrenny, but at least two of his obituaries stated his birthplace as the coastal town of Tenby. His autobiography says that he was born at his maternal grandparents&#x27; farm at Coedcanlas on the estuary of the River Cleddau, roughly a mile north-west of Lawrenny. His mother had likely returned to her parents&#x27; home to give birth, as was the custom. He was the son of a jockey and stable manager and his wife. Francis grew up in Maidenhead in Berkshire, England. He left school at 15 without any qualifications, intending to become a jockey; by the time he was 18, in 1938, he also was training horses.

In October 1945, he met Mary Margaret Brenchley (17 June 1924 – 30 September 2000) at a cousin&#x27;s wedding. In most interviews, they commented that it was love at first sight. (Francis has some of his characters fall similarly in love within moments of meeting, as in the novels &quot;Flying Finish&quot;, &quot;Knockdown&quot;, and &quot;The Edge&quot;.) Their families were not entirely happy with their engagement, but the couple married in June 1947 in London. She had graduated with a degree in English and French from London University at the age of 19, was an assistant stage manager, and later worked as a publisher&#x27;s reader. She also became a pilot, and her experience of flying contributed to many novels, including &quot;Flying Finish&quot;, &quot;Rat Race&quot;, and &quot;Second Wind&quot;. She contracted polio while pregnant with their first child. (Francis drew from this in his novel &quot;Forfeit&quot;, which he named as one of his favourites.) They had two sons, Merrick (born 1950) and Felix (born 1953).

For nearly 30 years, Francis lived in Blewbury in Berkshire (now in Oxfordshire). In the 1980s, he and his wife moved to Florida in the United States. In 1992, they moved to the Cayman Islands, where Mary died of a heart attack in 2000. In 2006, Francis had a heart bypass operation; in 2007 his right foot was amputated. He died of natural causes on 14 February 2010 at his Caribbean home in Grand Cayman, survived by both sons.

== Second World War ==
During the Second World War, Francis volunteered, hoping to join the cavalry. Instead, he served in the Royal Air Force, initially as a member of ground crew and later piloting fighter and bomber aircraft, including the Spitfire and Hurricane fighters, and the Wellington and Lancaster bombers. He received an emergency commission as a pilot officer on 29 July 1944, and was promoted war-substantive flying officer on 29 January 1945. Much of his six-year service career was spent in Africa.

== Horse racing career ==
After leaving the RAF in 1946, Francis became a highly successful jockey, reaching celebrity status in the world of British National Hunt racing. He won over 350 races, becoming champion jockey in the 1953–54 season.

Shortly after becoming a professional, he was offered the prestige job of first jockey to Vivian Smith, Lord Bicester.

From 1953 to 1957, Francis was jockey to Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. His best remembered moment as a jockey came while riding the Queen Mother&#x27;s horse, Devon Loch, in the 1956 Grand National, when the horse inexplicably fell when close to winning the race. Decades later, Francis considered losing that race his greatest regret and called it &quot;a disaster of massive proportions&quot;.

Francis suffered racing injuries, being first hospitalized from riding at the age of 12 when a pony fell on him and broke his jaw and nose. He drew from this career resulting in broken bones and damaged organs for his novels, in which his characters suffer the same. In 1957, after Francis suffered another serious fall, the Queen Mother&#x27;s adviser, Lord Abergavenny, advised him that she wanted him to retire from racing for her.

=== Contributions to racing ===

In 1983, the Grand National at Aintree Racecourse in England &quot;stood at the brink of extinction,&quot; according to &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot;. News reporter Don Clippinger wrote, 
&quot;Britain&#x27;s Jockey Club negotiated a $14 million deal to buy the land and save the race forever. The only problem was that the Jockey Club did not have $14 million, so two prominent racing personalities—Lord Derby and novelist Dick Francis—were selected to raise the money in a worldwide campaign&quot;. Other philanthropists, including Charles C. Fenwick Jr., who rode Ben Nevis to victory in the 1980 Grand National, and Paul Mellon, an American breeder and racing enthusiast, also contributed to saving the race.

== Writing career ==
Francis wrote more than 40 international best-sellers. His first book was his autobiography &quot;The Sport of Queens&quot; (1957); he was offered the aid of a ghostwriter but rejected the idea. The book&#x27;s success led to his becoming the racing correspondent for London&#x27;s &quot;Sunday Express&quot; newspaper, and he continued in that job for 16 years.

He set his first thriller, &quot;Dead Cert&quot;, published in 1962, in the world of horse racing, establishing a specialized niche for his work. Subsequently, he regularly produced a novel a year for the next 38 years, missing only 1998 (during which he published a short-story collection). Although all his books were set against a similar background, his male protagonists held a variety of jobs, including artist (&quot;In the Frame&quot; and &quot;To the Hilt&quot;), investigator for the Jockey Club (&quot;Slay-Ride&quot; and &quot;The Edge&quot;), pilot (&quot;Rat Race&quot; and &quot;Flying Finish&quot;), and wine merchant (&quot;Proof&quot;). All the novels are narrated by the hero, who in the course of the story learns that he is more resourceful, brave, tricky, than he had thought, and usually finds a certain salvation for himself as well as bestowing it on others. Details of other people&#x27;s occupations fascinated Francis, and he explores the workings of such fields as photography, accountancy, the gemstone trade, and restaurant service on transcontinental trains—but always in the interest of the plot. Dysfunctional families were a subject which he also exploited (&quot;Reflex&quot;, a baleful grandmother; &quot;Hot Money&quot;, a multi-millionaire father and serial ex-husband; &quot;Decider&quot;, the related co-owners of a racecourse).

Francis rarely re-used his lead characters. Only two heroes were used more than once; injured ex-jockey turned one-handed private investigator Sid Halley (&quot;Odds Against&quot;, &quot;Whip Hand&quot;, &quot;Come to Grief&quot;, &quot;Under Orders&quot;, also in &quot;Refusal&quot; by Felix Francis after his father&#x27;s death) and Kit Fielding (&quot;Break In&quot; and &quot;Bolt&quot;).

According to a columnist for the &quot;Houston Chronicle&quot;, Francis &quot;writes believable fairy tales for adults—ones in which the actors are better than we are but are believable enough to make us wonder if indeed we could not one day manage to emulate them.&quot;

=== Writing routine ===
Francis described a typical year of research and writing to an interviewer in 1989:

In January, he sits down to write, staring down the barrel of a deadline. &quot;My publisher comes over in mid-May to collect the manuscript,&quot; he says, &quot;and it&#x27;s got to be done.&quot;&lt;br&gt;The book&#x27;s publication takes place in England in September. American publication in past years has been in February, although his next book, &quot;Straight&quot;, is set to be published in November. Once the manuscript is out of his hands, he takes the summer off, while percolating the plot of his next book. Research on the next book begins in late summer and continues through the autumn, while he&#x27;s gearing up for his promotional tour for the just-published book. Come January, he sits down to write again.&lt;br&gt;He doesn&#x27;t like book tours. He is not one for revelations, major life changes, and intimacies with strange interviewers, and he says he gets tired of answering the same questions again and again.&lt;br&gt;He shuns the lecture circuit. He&#x27;d prefer to let his novels and his sales volume speak for themselves... And though he doesn&#x27;t love the act of writing [and] could easily retire, he finds himself planning his new book as each summer ends.&lt;br&gt;He says, &quot;Each one, you think to yourself, &#x27;This is the last one,&#x27; but then, by September, you&#x27;re starting again. If you&#x27;ve got money, and you&#x27;re just having fun, people think you&#x27;re a useless character.&quot;&lt;br&gt;Or, as independently wealthy Tor Kelsey says in &quot;The Edge&quot;, explaining why he works for a minuscule salary: &quot;I work... because I like it, I&#x27;m not all that bad at what I do, really, and it&#x27;s useful, and I&#x27;m not terribly good at twiddling my thumbs.&quot;

===Collaboration===

Francis collaborated extensively in his fiction with his wife, Mary, until her death. Learning this was a surprise to some readers and reviewers. He credited her with being a great researcher for the novels. In 1981, Don Clippinger interviewed the Francises for &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; and wrote, 
&quot;When Dick Francis sits down each January to begin writing another of his popular mystery-adventure novels, it is almost a certain bet that his wife, Mary, has developed a new avocation... For instance, in &quot;Rat Race&quot;, [the protagonist] operated an air-taxi service that specialized in carrying jockeys, trainers and owners to distant race courses. Before that book came out in 1970, Mrs. Francis obtained a pilot&#x27;s license and was operating an air-taxi service of her own. Francis&#x27; newest novel, &quot;Reflex&quot;, is built around photography, and sure enough, Mary Francis has become accomplished behind the camera and in the darkroom... And, in their condominium, they have set up the subject of his 20th novel [&quot;Twice Shy&quot;] – a computer. While he is touring the country, she is working on new computer programs.&quot;

According to journalist Mary Amoroso, &quot;Mary does much of the research: She went so far as to learn to fly a plane for &quot;Flying Finish&quot;. She also edits his manuscripts and serves as a sounding board for plot line and character development. Says Francis, &#x27;At least the research keeps her from going out shopping.&#x27;&quot; Francis told interviewers Jean Swanson and Dean James,

Francis&#x27; older son, Merrick, was a racehorse trainer and later ran his own horse transport business, which inspired the novel &quot;Driving Force&quot;. 

Francis&#x27;s manager (and co-author of his later books) was his son Felix, who left his post as teacher of A-Level Physics at Bloxham School in Oxfordshire in order to work for his father. Felix was the inspiration behind a leading character, a marksman and physics teacher, in the novel &quot;Twice Shy&quot;. Father and son collaborated on four novels. Since his father&#x27;s death, Felix has carried on to publish novels with his father&#x27;s name in the title, including a return for Sid Halley (&quot;Dick Francis&#x27;s Refusal&quot;, 2013).

===Honours===
Francis is the only three-time recipient of the Mystery Writers of America&#x27;s Edgar Award for Best Novel, winning for &quot;Forfeit&quot; in 1970, &quot;Whip Hand&quot; in 1981, and &quot;Come To Grief&quot; in 1996. Britain&#x27;s Crime Writers Association awarded him its Gold Dagger Award for fiction in 1979 and the Cartier Diamond Dagger Lifetime Achievement Award in 1989. He was granted another Lifetime Achievement Award. Tufts University awarded him an honorary doctorate in 1991.

In 1996 he was given the Mystery Writers of America Grand Master Award, the highest honour bestowed by the MWA. In 2000, he was granted the Malice Domestic Award for Lifetime Achievement. He was created an Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in 1983 and promoted to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 2000. He was inducted into the prestigious Detection Club in 1966.

Amoroso wrote in 1989, &quot;And yet he has a keen sense of the evanescence of literary endeavors. &#x27;Whole months of work can be gone in four hours,&#x27; he says ruefully. &#x27;People say they can&#x27;t put my books down, and so they read them in one sitting of four hours.&#x27; Francis has been long accustomed to celebrity as a British sports star, but today he is a worldwide phenomenon, having been published in 22 languages. In Australia, he is recognized in restaurants, from his book-jacket picture. He and Mary will see people reading the novels on planes and trains.&quot;

Francis was elected in 1999 a Fellow of the Royal Society of Literature.

==Adaptations==
===Film and television===
His first novel, &quot;Dead Cert&quot;, was adapted as a film under the same title in 1974. Directed by Tony Richardson, it starred Scott Antony, Judi Dench and Michael Williams. It was adapted again as &quot;Favorit&quot; (a Soviet made-for-television movie) in 1976.

Francis&#x27;s protagonist Sid Halley was featured in six TV movies made for the program &quot;The Dick Francis Thriller: The Racing Game&quot; (1979–1980), starring Mike Gwilym as Halley and Mick Ford as his partner, Chico Barnes. The first of the episodes, &quot;Odds Against&quot;, used a Francis title; the others were created for the program.

Three TV films of 1989 were adaptations of &quot;Bloodsport&quot;, &quot;In the Frame&quot;, and &quot;Twice Shy&quot;, all starring Ian McShane as protagonist David Cleveland, a character used only once by Francis, in the novel &quot;Slay-Ride&quot;.

In April 2022, Kudos were announced to have optioned the TV rights for the works of Dick and Felix Francis. The series is tentatively titled &quot;The Turf&quot;, and will draw plots and characters from across the entirety of Francis&#x27; works.
