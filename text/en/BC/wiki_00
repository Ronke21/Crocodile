<text>In aviation, the instrument landing system (ILS) is a precision radio navigation system that provides short-range guidance to aircraft to allow them to approach a runway at night or in bad weather. In its original form, it allows an aircraft to approach until it is over the ground, within a of the runway. At that point the runway should be visible to the pilot; if it is not, they perform a missed approach. Bringing the aircraft this close to the runway dramatically increases the range of weather conditions in which a safe landing can be made. Other versions of the system, or &quot;categories&quot;, have further reduced the minimum altitudes, runway visual ranges (RVRs), and transmitter and monitoring configurations designed depending on the normal expected weather patterns and airport safety requirements.

ILS uses two directional radio signals, the &quot;localizer&quot; (108 to 112 MHz frequency), which provides horizontal guidance, and the &quot;glideslope&quot; (329.15 to 335 MHz frequency) for vertical guidance. The relationship between the aircraft&#x27;s position and these signals is displayed on an aircraft instrument, often additional pointers in the attitude indicator. The pilot attempts to manoeuvre the aircraft to keep the indicators centered while they approach the runway to the decision height. Optional &quot;marker beacon(s)&quot; provide distance information as the approach proceeds, including the &quot;middle marker&quot; (MM), placed close to the position of the (CAT 1) decision height. Markers are largely being phased out and replaced by distance measuring equipment (DME). The ILS usually includes high-intensity lighting at the end of the runways to help the pilot locate the runway and transition from the approach to a visual landing.

=History of precision approach landing systems=

A number of radio-based landing systems were developed between the 1920s and 1940s, notably the Lorenz beam, which was a blind-landing radio navigation system developed by C. Lorenz AG for bad weather landing, which saw relatively wide use in Europe and was also installed on a number of airports on other continents worldwide prior to World War II. Later also the patent for adding vertical guidance like in today&#x27;s ILS was awarded., 

The US-developed SCS-51 system provided a better accuracy for vertical and horizontal guidance. Many sets were installed at airbases in the United Kingdom during World War II. The ILS was after the formation of the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) in 1947, selected as the first international standard precision approach system and was published in ICAO Annex 10 in 1950. Further development enabled ILS systems to provide up to CAT-III approaches. 

The PAR (PrecisionApproachRadar&quot;) [[radar]]-based [[ground-controlled approach]] (GCA), provides the pilot with the necessary horizontal and vertical guidance via VHF- or UHF-voice-communication link. The ATC-controller “talks the pilot down” with the PAR derived guidance information displayed on a special [[Plan position indicator|PPI]] (Plan Position Indicator)&quot; via VHF- or UHF-voice-communication. PAR GCA requires no equipment in the aircraft other than the VHF- or UHF-communication equipment, but requires the pilot and controller to be certified for this use.

The second ICAO standard system for precision approach up to CAT-III is the microwave landing system (MLS) which was also planned for implementation by NATO to replace PAR. Due to the foreseen availability of cost-free GPS service for civil use and later the promise of DGPS, to provide additional correctional data via a VHF-Data-Link to improve reliability up to CAT-I level, most states opted to delay, until today, the implementation of MLS. In addition to the cost for the ground-based MLS system, aircraft operators were forced to equip aircraft, in addition to the MLS-receiver, with a C-Band antenna. The retrofit of a C-Band antenna in the aircraft&#x27;s fuselage is more time consuming and costly than just retrofitting an MLS-receiver. However more than thousand fixed and transportable MLS systems have been deployed, e.g. in Europe, and more than thousand civil and military aircraft were equipped with MLS equipment and antenna and in use for about a decade. 

While the promised availability of free access to GPS signals and later additional global navigation satellite systems (GNSSs) for precision approaches reducing the need for the airport infrastructure compared to a single ILS-system (ILS-LLZ, GP and associated Monitors) looked promising. Ensuring safe 24/7 operation identical to ILS with the same continuity of service, under all operational weather conditions, aircraft orientation during all phases of a flight proved to be impossible without an additional augmentation VHF-Data-Link. One reason is the weak satellite based signals, which unlike much stronger ILS- or MLS- signals, very sensitive even to very weak RFI-, intentional Jamming- or Spoofing signals. 

The DGPS system was, after further development and modifications, standardized by ICAO as GBAS ground-based augmentation system. Today GBAS is the third ICAO standard system for precision landing capable of up to CAT-III. Work on standards to support multi-constellation, which means adding support for the now available Galileo, GLONASS and BeiDou GNSS system is ongoing. Like for MLS aircraft require for GBAS a receiver for the GBAS datalink and a horizontally polarized VHF-antenna. While IFR certified civil aircraft are already all equipped with horizontally polarized VHF antennas for ILS- and VOR-reception, some military aircraft only have vertically polarized VHF antennas for VHF voice communication (e.g. USNY). While ICAO also standardized the use of the additional vertical polarization, so far no vertically polarized GBAS installation have been published to be available. 

Similar to the MLS until today compared to ILS-installations that are in use worldwide, only a limited number of GBAS systems have been deployed and are still in use currently. While in principle a single omnidirectional augmentation signal was initially thought to suffice to provide service to one or even other airports within RLOS (&quot;Radio Line Of Sight&quot;), providing sufficient coverage within all approach paths provided to be difficult for complex airport layouts with large buildings and Hangars and varying aircraft antenna pattern. Today in Europe mostly serve only a single or parallel runways, e.g. Frankfurt am Main, but not all runways. By 2015, the number of US airports supporting ILS-like LPV approaches exceeded the number of ILS installations, and this may lead to the eventual removal of ILS at most airports.

ILS therefore remains the only available precision approach systems supported by all IFR equipped civil aircraft.

== Principle of operation ==
An &quot;instrument landing system&quot; operates as a ground-based instrument approach system that provides precision lateral and vertical guidance to an aircraft approaching and landing on a runway, using a combination of radio signals and, in many cases, high-intensity lighting arrays to enable a safe landing during instrument meteorological conditions (IMC), such as low ceilings or reduced visibility due to fog, rain, or blowing snow.

===Beam systems===

Previous blind landing radio aids typically took the form of &quot;beam&quot; systems of various types. These normally consisted of a radio transmitter that was connected to a motorized switch to produce a pattern of Morse code dots and dashes. The switch also controlled which of two directional antennae the signal was sent to. The resulting signal sent into the air consists of dots sent to one side of the runway and dashes to the other. The beams were wide enough so they overlapped in the center.

To use the system an aircraft only needed a conventional radio receiver. As they approached the airport they would tune in the signal and listen to it in their headphones. They would hear dots and dashes (Morse code &quot;A&quot; or &quot;N&quot;), if they were to the side of the runway, or if they were properly aligned, the two mixed together to produce a steady tone, the &quot;equisignal&quot;. The accuracy of this measurement was highly dependent on the skill of the operator, who listened to the signal on earphones in a noisy aircraft, often while communicating with the tower.

Accuracy of the system was normally on the order of 3 degrees in azimuth. While this was useful for bringing the aircraft onto the direction of the runway, it was not accurate enough to safely bring the aircraft to visual range in bad weather; the radio course beams were used only for lateral guidance, and the system was not enough on its own to perform landings in heavy rain or fog. Nevertheless, the final decision to land was made at only from the airport.

===ILS concept===
The ILS, developed just prior to the start of World War II, used a more complex system of signals and an antenna array to achieve higher accuracy. This requires significantly more complexity in the ground station and transmitters, with the advantage that the signals can be accurately decoded in the aircraft using simple electronics and displayed directly on analog instruments. The instruments can be placed in front of the pilot, eliminating the need for a radio operator to continually monitor the signals and relay the results to the pilot over the intercom.

Key to its operation is a concept known as the amplitude modulation index, a measure of how strongly the amplitude modulation is applied to the carrier frequency. In the earlier beam systems, the signal was turned on and off entirely, corresponding to a modulation index of 100%. The determination of angle within the beam is based on the comparison of the audible strength of the two signals.

In ILS, a more complex system of signals and antennas varies the modulation of two signals across the entire width of the beam pattern. The system relies on the use of sidebands, secondary frequencies that are created when two different signals are mixed. For instance, if one takes a radio frequency signal at 10 MHz and mixes that with an audible tone at 2500 Hz, four signals will be produced, at the original signals&#x27; frequencies of 2500 and 10000000 Hz, and sidebands 9997500 and 10002500 Hz. The original 2500 Hz signal&#x27;s frequency is too low to travel far from an antenna, but the other three signals are all radio frequency and can be effectively transmitted.

ILS starts by mixing two modulating signals to the carrier, one at 90 Hz and another at 150. This creates a signal with five radio frequencies in total, the carrier and four sidebands. This combined signal, known as the CSB for &quot;carrier and sidebands&quot;, is sent out evenly from an antenna array. The CSB is also sent into a circuit that suppresses the original carrier, leaving only the four sideband signals. This signal, known as SBO for &quot;sidebands only&quot;, is also sent to the antenna array.

For lateral guidance, known as the &quot;localizer&quot;, the antenna is normally placed centrally at the far end of the runway and consists of multiple antennas in an array normally about the width of the runway. Each individual antenna has a particular phase shift and power level applied only to the SBO signal such that the resulting signal is retarded 90 degrees on the left side of the runway and advanced 90 degrees on the right. Additionally, the 150 Hz signal is inverted on one side of the pattern, another 180 degree shift. Due to the way the signals mix in space the SBO signals destructively interfere with and almost eliminate each other along the centerline, leaving the CSB signal predominating. At any other location, on either side of the centerline, the SBO and CSB signals combine in different ways so that one modulating signal predominates.

A receiver in front of the array will receive both of these signals mixed together. Using simple electronic filters, the original carrier and two sidebands can be separated and demodulated to extract the original amplitude-modulated 90 and 150 Hz signals. These are then averaged to produce two direct current (DC) signals. Each of these signals represents not the strength of the original signal, but the strength of the modulation relative to the carrier, which varies across the beam pattern. This has the great advantage that the measurement of angle is independent of range.

The two DC signals are then sent to a conventional voltmeter, with the 90 Hz output pulling the needle right and the other left. Along the centreline the two modulating tones of the sidebands will be cancelled out and both voltages will be zero, leaving the needle centered in the display. If the aircraft is far to the left, the 90 Hz signal will produce a strong DC voltage (predominates), and the 150 Hz signal is minimised, pulling the needle all the way to the right. This means the voltmeter directly displays both the direction and magnitude of the turn needed to bring the aircraft back to the runway centreline. As the measurement compares different parts of a single signal entirely in electronics, it provides angular resolution of less than a degree, and allows the construction of a precision approach.

Although the encoding scheme is complex, and requires a considerable amount of ground equipment, the resulting signal is both far more accurate than the older beam-based systems and is far more resistant to common forms of interference. For instance, static in the signal will affect both sub-signals equally, so it will have no effect on the result. Similarly, changes in overall signal strength as the aircraft approaches the runway, or changes due to fading, will have little effect on the resulting measurement because they would normally affect both channels equally. The system is subject to multipath distortion effects due to the use of multiple frequencies, but because those effects are dependent on the terrain, they are generally fixed in location and can be accounted for through adjustments in the antenna or phase shifters.
Additionally, because it is the encoding of the signal within the beam that contains the angle information, not the strength of the beam, the signal does not have to be tightly focussed in space. In the older beam systems, the accuracy of the equisignal area was a function of the pattern of the two directional signals, which demanded that they be relatively narrow. The ILS pattern can be much wider. ILS installations are normally required to be usable within 10 degrees on either side of the runway centerline at , and 35 degrees on either side at . This allows for a wide variety of approach paths.

The &quot;glideslope&quot; works in the same general fashion as the localizer and uses the same encoding, but is normally transmitted to produce a centerline at an angle of 3 degrees above horizontal from an antenna beside the runway instead of the end. The only difference between the signals is that the localizer is transmitted using lower carrier frequencies, using 40 selected channels between 108.10 MHz and 111.95 MHz, whereas the glideslope has a corresponding set of 40 channels between 328.6 and 335.4 MHz. The higher frequencies generally result in the glideslope radiating antennas being smaller. The channel pairs are not linear; localizer channel 1 is at 108.10 and paired with glideslope at 334.70, whereas channel two is 108.15 and 334.55. There are gaps and jumps through both bands.

Many illustrations of the ILS concept often show the system operating more similarly to beam systems with the 90 Hz signal on one side and the 150 on the other. These illustrations are inaccurate; both signals are radiated across the entire beam pattern, it is their relative difference in the depth of modulation (DDM) that changes dependent upon the position of the approaching aircraft.

===Using ILS===
An instrument approach procedure chart (or &#x27;approach plate&#x27;) is published for each ILS approach to provide the information needed to fly an ILS approach during instrument flight rules (IFR) operations. A chart includes the radio frequencies used by the ILS components or navaids and the prescribed minimum visibility requirements.

An aircraft approaching a runway is guided by the ILS receivers in the aircraft by performing modulation depth comparisons. Many aircraft can route signals into the autopilot to fly the approach automatically. An ILS consists of two independent sub-systems. The localizer provides lateral guidance; the glide slope provides vertical guidance.

=== Localizer ===

A localizer (LOC, or LLZ until ICAO standardisation) is an antenna array normally located beyond the departure end of the runway and generally consists of several pairs of directional antennas.

The localizer will allow the aircraft to turn and match the aircraft with the runway. After that, the pilots will activate approach phase (APP). 

===Glide slope (G/S)===


The pilot controls the aircraft so that the glide slope indicator remains centered on the display to ensure the aircraft is following the glide path of approximately 3° above horizontal (ground level) to remain above obstructions and reach the runway at the proper touchdown point (i.e. it provides vertical guidance).

===Limitations===
Due to the complexity of ILS localizer and glide slope systems, there are some limitations. Localizer systems are sensitive to obstructions in the signal broadcast area, such as large buildings or hangars. Glide slope systems are also limited by the terrain in front of the glide slope antennas. If terrain is sloping or uneven, reflections can create an uneven glidepath, causing unwanted needle deflections. Additionally, since the ILS signals are pointed in one direction by the positioning of the arrays, glide slope supports only straight-line approaches with a constant angle of descent. Installation of an ILS can be costly because of siting criteria and the complexity of the antenna system.

ILS critical areas and ILS sensitive areas are established to avoid hazardous reflections that would affect the radiated signal. The location of these critical areas can prevent aircraft from using certain taxiways leading to delays in takeoffs, increased hold times, and increased separation between aircraft.

===Variant===
* Instrument guidance system (IGS) (localizer type directional aid (LDA) in the United States) – a modified ILS to accommodate a non-straight approach; the most famous example was for the approach to runway 13 at Kai Tak Airport, Hong Kong.
* Instrument carrier landing system (ICLS) – a modified ILS for (aircraft) carrier landing.

===Identification===

In addition to the previously mentioned navigational signals, the localizer provides for ILS facility identification by periodically transmitting a 1,020 Hz Morse code identification signal, that always starts with Morse Code letter &quot;I&quot;, for ILS, two dots. For example, the ILS for runway 4R at John F. Kennedy International Airport transmits IJFK to identify itself, while runway 4L is known as IHIQ. This lets users know the facility is operating normally and that they are tuned to the correct ILS. The glide slope station transmits no identification signal, so ILS equipment relies on the localizer for identification.

===Monitoring===
It is essential that any failure of the ILS to provide safe guidance be detected immediately by the pilot. To achieve this, monitors continually assess the vital characteristics of the transmissions. If any significant deviation beyond strict limits is detected, either the ILS is automatically switched off or the navigation and identification components are removed from the carrier. Either of these actions will activate an indication (&#x27;failure flag&#x27;) on the instruments of an aircraft using the ILS.

===Localizer back course===
Modern localizer antennas are highly directional. However, usage of older, less directional antennas allows a runway to have a non-precision approach called a &quot;localizer back course&quot;. This lets aircraft land using the signal transmitted from the back of the localizer array. Highly directional antennas do not provide a sufficient signal to support a back course. In the United States, back course approaches are typically associated with Category I systems at smaller airports that do not have an ILS on both ends of the primary runway. Pilots flying a back course should disregard any glide slope indication.

===Marker beacons===

On some legacy installations, marker beacons operating at a carrier frequency of 75 MHz are provided. When the transmission from a marker beacon is received it activates an indicator on the pilot&#x27;s instrument panel and the identity code and tone of the beacon is audible to the pilot. The distance from the runway at which this indication should be received is published in the documentation for that approach, together with the height at which the aircraft should be if correctly established on the ILS. This provides a check on the correct function of the glide slope. Instead of marker beacons, modern ILS installations use DME. Co-located with the ILS glidepath transmitter near the touchdown point, the DME provides a display of aircraft distance to the runway.
===DME substitution===

Distance measuring equipment (DME) provides pilots with a slant range measurement of distance to the runway. DMEs are augmenting or replacing markers in many installations. The DME provides more accurate and continuous monitoring of correct progress on the ILS glide slope to the pilot, and does not require an installation outside the airport boundary. When used in conjunction with a dual runway approach ILS, the DME is often sited midway between the reciprocal runway thresholds with the internal delay modified so that one unit can provide distance information to either runway threshold. For approaches where a DME is specified in lieu of marker beacons, &quot;DME required&quot; is noted on the instrument approach procedure and the aircraft must have at least one operating DME unit, or an IFR-approved system using a GNSS (an RNAV system meeting TSO-C129/ -C145/-C146), to begin the approach.

=== Compass locator ===
Compass locators are low-powered (less than 25 W) non-directional beacons and are received and indicated by the automatic direction finder receiver. It ranges over 15 miles and operate between 190 and 535 kHz. When used in conjunction with an ILS front course, the compass locator facilities are collocated with the outer and/or middle marker facilities and can be used to substitute an outer marker, in which case it will transmit at 400 W. The coding identification of the outer locator consists of the first two letters of the three-letter identifier of the associated localizer. 

==Approach lighting==


Some installations include medium- or high-intensity approach light systems (abbreviated &quot;ALS&quot;). Most often, these are at larger airports but many small general aviation airports in the U.S. have approach lights to support their ILS installations and obtain low-visibility minimums. The ALS assists the pilot in transitioning from instrument to visual flight, and to align the aircraft visually with the runway centerline. Pilot observation of the approach lighting system at the Decision Altitude allows the pilot to continue descending towards the runway, even if the runway or runway lights cannot be seen, since the ALS counts as runway end environment. In the U.S., an ILS without approach lights may have CAT I ILS visibility minimums as low as (runway visual range of ) if the required obstacle clearance surfaces are clear of obstructions. 

Visibility minimums of (runway visual range of ) are possible with a CAT I ILS approach supported by a ALS, and visibility visual range is possible if the runway has high-intensity edge lights, touchdown zone and centerline lights, and an ALS that is at least long (see Table 3-3-1 &quot;Minimum visibility values&quot; in FAA Order 8260.3C). In effect, ALS extends the runway environment out towards the landing aircraft and allows low-visibility operations. CAT II and III ILS approaches generally require complex high-intensity approach light systems, while medium-intensity systems are usually paired with CAT I ILS approaches. At some non-towered airports, the pilot controls the lighting system; for example, the pilot can key the microphone seven times to turn on the lights on the high intensity, five times to medium intensity or three times for low intensity.

==Decision altitude and height==
Once established on an approach, the pilot follows the ILS approach path indicated by the localizer and descends along the glide path to the decision height. This is the height at which the pilot must have adequate visual reference to the landing environment (e.g. approach or runway lighting) to decide whether to continue the descent to a landing; otherwise, the pilot must execute a missed approach procedure, then try the same approach again, try a different approach, or divert to another airport. Usually, the decision on whether or not the pilot continues with the approach relies on whether the runway is visible or not, or if the runway is clear or not.

==ILS categories==


Smaller aircraft generally are equipped to fly only a CAT I ILS. On larger aircraft, these approaches typically are controlled by the flight control system with the flight crew providing supervision. CAT I relies only on altimeter indications for decision height, whereas CAT II and CAT III approaches use radio altimeter (RA) to determine decision height.

An ILS must shut down upon internal detection of a fault condition. Higher categories require shorter response times; therefore, ILS equipment is required to shut down more quickly. For example, a CAT I localizer must shut down within 10 seconds of detecting a fault, but a CAT III localizer must shut down in less than 2 seconds.

===Special CAT II and CAT III operations===

In contrast to other operations, CAT III weather minima do not provide sufficient visual references to allow a manual landing to be made. CAT IIIb minima depend on roll-out control and redundancy of the autopilot, because they give only enough time for the pilot to decide whether the aircraft will land in the touchdown zone (basically CAT IIIa) and to ensure safety during rollout (basically CAT IIIb). Therefore, an automatic landing system is mandatory to perform Category III operations. Its reliability must be sufficient to control the aircraft to touchdown in CAT IIIa operations and through rollout to a safe taxi speed in CAT IIIb (and CAT IIIc when authorized). However, special approval has been granted to some operators for hand-flown CAT III approaches using a head-up display (HUD) guidance that provides the pilot with an image viewed through the windshield with eyes focused at infinity, of necessary electronic guidance to land the airplane with no true outside visual references.

In the United States, airports with CAT III approaches have listings for CAT IIIa and IIIb or just CAT III on the instrument approach plate (U.S. Terminal Procedures). CAT IIIb RVR minimums are limited by the runway/taxiway lighting and support facilities, and are consistent with the airport surface movement guidance control system (SMGCS) plan. Operations below 600 ft RVR require taxiway centerline lights and taxiway red stop bar lights. If the CAT IIIb RVR minimums on a runway end are , which is a common figure in the U.S., ILS approaches to that runway end with RVR below qualify as CAT IIIc and require special taxi procedures, lighting, and approval conditions to permit the landings. FAA Order 8400.13D limits CAT III to 300 ft RVR or better. Order 8400.13D (2009) allows &quot;special authorization CAT II&quot; approaches to runways without ALSF-2 approach lights and/or touchdown zone/centerline lights, which has expanded the number of potential CAT II runways.

In each case, a suitably equipped aircraft and appropriately qualified crew are required. For example, CAT IIIb requires a fail-operational system, along with a crew who are qualified and current, while CAT I does not. A HUD that allows the pilot to perform aircraft maneuvers rather than an automatic system is considered as fail-operational. A HUD allows the flight crew to fly the aircraft using the guidance cues from the ILS sensors such that if a safe landing is in doubt, the crew can respond in an appropriate and timely manner. HUD is becoming increasingly popular with &quot;feeder&quot; airlines and most manufacturers of regional jets are now offering HUDs as either standard or optional equipment. A HUD can provide capability to take off in low visibility.
Some commercial aircraft are equipped with automatic landing systems that allow the aircraft to land without transitioning from instruments to visual conditions for a normal landing. Such autoland operations require specialized equipment, procedures and training, and involve the aircraft, airport, and the crew. Autoland is the only way some major airports such as Charles de Gaulle Airport remain operational every day of the year. Some modern aircraft are equipped with enhanced flight vision systems based on infrared sensors, that provide a day-like visual environment and allow operations in conditions and at airports that would otherwise not be suitable for a landing. Commercial aircraft also frequently use such equipment for takeoffs when &quot;takeoff minima&quot; are not met.

For both automatic and HUD landing systems, the equipment requires special approval for its design and also for each individual installation. The design takes into consideration additional safety requirements for operating an aircraft close to the ground and the ability of the flight crew to react to a system anomaly. The equipment also has additional maintenance requirements to ensure that it is capable of supporting reduced visibility operations.

Nearly all of this pilot training and qualification work is done in simulators with various degrees of fidelity.

==Use==
At a controlled airport, air traffic control will direct aircraft to the localizer course via assigned headings, making sure aircraft do not get too close to each other (maintain separation), but also avoiding delay as much as possible. Several aircraft can be on the ILS at the same time, several miles apart. An aircraft that has turned onto the inbound heading and is within two and a half degrees of the localizer course (half scale deflection or less shown by the course deviation indicator) is said to be &quot;established&quot; on the approach. Typically, an aircraft is established by at least prior to the final approach fix (glideslope intercept at the specified altitude).

Aircraft deviation from the optimal path is indicated to the flight crew by means of a display dial (a carryover from when an analog meter movement indicated deviation from the course line via voltages sent from the ILS receiver).

The output from the ILS receiver goes to the display system (head-down display and head-up display if installed) and may go to a Flight Control Computer. An aircraft landing procedure can be either &quot;coupled&quot; where the autopilot or Flight Control Computer directly flies the aircraft and the flight crew monitor the operation, or &quot;uncoupled&quot; where the flight crew flies the aircraft manually to keep the localizer and glideslope indicators centered.

==History==
Tests of the ILS began in 1929 in the United States, with Jimmy Doolittle becoming the first pilot to take off, fly and land an airplane using instruments alone, without a view outside the cockpit. A basic system, fully operative, was introduced in 1932 at Berlin-Tempelhof Central Airport (Germany) named LFF or &quot;Lorenz beam&quot; after its inventor, the C. Lorenz AG company. The Civil Aeronautics Board (CAB) of the United States authorized installation of the system in 1941 at six locations. The first landing of a scheduled U.S. passenger airliner using ILS was on January 26, 1938, when a Pennsylvania Central Airlines Boeing 247D flew from Washington, D.C., to Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and landed in a snowstorm using only the Instrument Landing System. The first fully automatic landing by a commercial airliner using ILS occurred in March 1964 at Bedford Airport in the UK.

==Market==
The instrument landing systems market revenue was US$1,215 million in 2019, and is expected to reach US$1,667 million in 2025, with a CAGR of 5.41% during 2020–2025 even with the negative effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.

*Universal Avionics
*Honeywell
*Astronics
*Liberty Airport Systems
*Thales
*Rockwell Collins

==Alternatives==
* The Microwave Landing System (MLS) allowed for curved approaches. It was introduced in the 1970s to replace ILS but fell out of favor because of the introduction of satellite based systems. In the 1980s, there was a major US and European effort to establish MLS. But a combination of airline reluctance to invest and the rise of Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) resulted in its not being adopted in civil aviation. At the time ILS and MLS were the only standardized systems in Civil Aviation that meet requirements for Category III automated landings. The first Category III MLS for civil aviation was commissioned at Heathrow airport in March 2009 and removed from service in 2017.
* Transponder Landing System (TLS) can be used where a conventional ILS cannot work or is not cost-effective.
* Localizer Performance with Vertical guidance (LPV) is based on the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS), LPV has similar minima to ILS for appropriately equipped aircraft. , the FAA has published more LPV approaches than Category I ILS procedures.
* Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) (Local Area Augmentation System in the United States) is a safety-critical system that augments the GNSS Standard Positioning Service (SPS) and provides enhanced levels of service. It supports all phases of approach, landing, departure, and surface operations within the VHF coverage volume. GBAS is expected to play a key role in modernization and in all-weather operations capability at CATI/II and III airports, terminal area navigation, missed approach guidance and surface operations. GBAS provides the capability to service the entire airport with a single frequency (VHF transmission) whereas ILS requires a separate frequency for each runway end. GBAS CAT-I is seen as a necessary step towards the more stringent operations of CAT-II/III precision approach and landing. The technical risk of implementing GBAS delayed widespread acceptance of the technology. The FAA, along with industry, have fielded Provably Safe Prototype GBAS stations that mitigate the impact of satellite signal deformation, ionosphere differential error, ephemeris error, and multipath.

==Future==
The advent of the Global Positioning System (GPS) provides an alternative source of approach guidance for aircraft. In the US, the Wide Area Augmentation System (WAAS) has been available in many regions to provide precision guidance to Category I standards since 2007. The equivalent European Geostationary Navigation Overlay Service (EGNOS) was certified for use in safety of life applications in March 2011. As such, the number of Cat I ILS installations may be reduced, however there are no plans in the United States to phase out any Cat II or Cat III systems.

Local Area Augmentation System (LAAS) is under development to provide for Category III minimums or lower. The FAA Ground-Based Augmentation System (GBAS) office is currently working with the industry in anticipation of the certification of the first GBAS ground stations in Memphis, TN; Sydney, Australia; Bremen, Germany; Spain; and Newark, NJ. All four countries have installed GBAS ground stations and are involved in technical and operational evaluation activities.

The Honeywell and FAA team obtained System Design Approval of the world&#x27;s first non-federal U.S. approval for LAAS Category I at Newark Liberty International Airport, operations in September 2009 and Operational Approval on September 28, 2012.

In Norway, a D-GPS based landing system, called SCAT-I, is in operation on some short runway airports.

<text>An Awkward Squad is a group of individuals, normally within an existing organisation or structure, who resist or obstruct change, either through incompetence or by deliberate association.

==Origin==
It is commonly accepted that shortly before his death in 1796 Robert Burns uttered the words &quot;Don&#x27;t let the awkward squad fire over me&quot;. At this time the phrase was in use in military slang for a group of recruits who seemed incapable of understanding discipline or not yet sufficiently trained or disciplined to properly carry out their duties.

==Literary use==

John Clare, an English peasant poet, wrote with his own spelling and no punctuation. He complained in the 1820s to his editors that people could understand him, and he refused to use &quot;that awkward squad of colon, semi-colon, comma, and full stop&quot;, according to the display in the John Clare Cottage, in Helpston.

In Canto 7, stanza 52 of Byron&#x27;s &quot;Don Juan&quot;, the Russian general Suvorov (or &quot;Suwarrow&quot; as Byron anglicizes it) is described training the &#x27;awkward squad&#x27; prior to the battle of Ismail.

Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his 1842 essay on Frederic the Great, used the phrase to describe the army of Frederic&#x27;s father.

In her 1853 novel &quot;Villette&quot;, Charlotte Brontë writes of M. Paul Emanuel: &quot;Irritable he was; one heard that, as he apostrophized with vehemence the awkward squad under his orders.&quot; Brontë had also used the phrase four years earlier, in &quot;Shirley&quot;.

In Chapter 16 of &quot;Our Mutual Friend&quot; (1864–65), Charles Dickens described the character Sloppy as a &quot;Full-Private Number One in the Awkward Squad of the rank and file of life&quot;.

Norman Cameron used the words to end his 1950 poem &quot;Forgive me, sire&quot;.

==Trade unionism==
The tag of &#x27;awkward squad&#x27; has been applied to a group of left-wing trade unionists in the United Kingdom, marked out by their opposition to the Labour Party&#x27;s economic policies. The group includes Bob Crow, Mark Serwotka, and Tony Woodley. In a Parliamentary sense, however, it can also apply to the left-wing of the Labour Party, which perennially occupies a bench of the House of Commons which allows its members to heckle and unnerve the Prime Minister regularly.

<text>Allaire is a surname of French origin, mainly found in Northern France (Brittany), Jersey, and Quebec.

==Etymology==
The Breton toponymic origin of the surname Allaire is described by Francis Gourvil in his publication &quot;Noms de famille bretons d&#x27;origine toponymique&quot;. This would point to Allaire, a commune located in the Morbihan department.

Other Breton toponymic connections include lieux-dits &quot;Ville-Allaire&quot; in the communes of Langouet (Ille-et-Vilaine) and Illifaut (Côtes-d&#x27;Armor).

Two other possible etymologies can be traced:

* Variant form of &quot;Hilaire&quot;, French form of Latin &quot;Hilarius&quot;, derived from Latin &quot;hilaris&quot; meaning &quot;joyful&quot;.
* In Brittany can be given after saint Aloire (), bishop of Quimper, Brittany.

==Some variations==
* Alair, Aler, Alere, Allair, Allayre, Allere, Alarius

<doc id="240593" wikidata="Q7510444" url="?curid=240593" title="Sieges of Taunton">
<text>The sieges of Taunton were a series of three blockades during the First English Civil War. The town of Taunton, in Somerset, was considered to be of strategic importance because it controlled the main road from Bristol to Devon and Cornwall. Robert Blake commanded the town&#x27;s Parliamentarian defences during all three sieges, from September 1644 to July 1645.

The first siege was laid by Edmund Wyndham on 23 September, and was primarily composed of Royalist troops from local Somerset garrisons. After initial assaults drove Blake and his troops back into Taunton Castle, the blockade was conducted from away, and concentrated more on starving the garrison than continued attacks. The town was relieved by a force under James Holborne on 14 December.

Over the next three months, Blake was able to establish a network of earthen defences in Taunton, including a basic perimeter and several forts. The Royalists began the second, and bloodiest, siege in late March 1645, initially under Sir Richard Grenville. A series of disputes between the Royalist commanders allowed Taunton some respite at the start of the siege, but in May the attacks were fierce under the command of Sir Ralph Hopton. After five days of intense fighting, which had once again driven the defending army back to a small central perimeter including the castle, the Royalists retreated in the face of a Parliamentarian relief army commanded by Ralph Weldon.

Lord Goring, who had proposed the second siege, renewed the blockade for a third time in mid-May, after engaging Weldon&#x27;s departing army and forcing it back into Taunton. Goring&#x27;s siege was lax and allowed provisions into the town, diminishing its effectiveness. The Parliamentarian defence tied up Goring and his 10–15,000 troops, who would have otherwise been available to fight for King Charles at Naseby, where historians believe they could have tipped the battle in favour of the Royalists. Instead, after securing a Parliamentarian victory at Naseby, Thomas Fairfax marched his army to relieve Taunton on 9 July 1645.

==Background==
Loyalties in Somerset were divided at the start of the First English Civil War; many of the prominent landowners and those living in the countryside favoured King Charles I, but most of the towns, including Taunton, were Parliamentarian, predominantly due to their Puritan beliefs. By August 1642, the town was held by a small Parliamentarian force. In June the following year, Sir Ralph Hopton led his Royalist army, consisting of eighteen regiments equally split between foot and cavalry, out of Cornwall and into Somerset. He forced the surrender of Taunton to the King without engaging in battle, and established a garrison in Taunton Castle.

In mid-1644, Robert Devereux, 3rd Earl of Essex, the Chief Commander of the Parliamentary army, decided to reclaim the West Country. He moved through Dorset, retaking Dorchester and Weymouth, and then left the coast and headed towards Chard. At the time, Taunton was held by a garrison of 800 men commanded by Colonel John Stawell, but the proximity of the Earl of Essex&#x27;s army led the town to be abandoned, leaving only 80 men to defend the castle. The historian Robert Morris, in &quot;The Sieges of Taunton 1644–1645&quot;, suggests that Stawell and his men retreated to Bridgwater, but in &quot;The History of the Rebellion&quot;, the 17th-century historian Edward Hyde claims that the troops were requisitioned by Prince Maurice during his retreat from Lyme Regis to Plymouth.

On 8 July 1644, the Earl of Essex sent a Parliamentarian force, led by Colonel Sir Robert Pye with Lieutenant Colonel Robert Blake as his second in command, to reclaim Taunton. They took the town without a fight, and surrounded the castle. The Royalist forces under Major William Reeve that were garrisoned at Taunton Castle surrendered and retreated to Bridgwater. Pye left Taunton shortly after the capture, leaving Blake to hold the town. Blake had an army of about 1,000 men, and was charged with trying to blockade the roads to support the Earl of Essex&#x27;s campaign in Devon and Cornwall.

==Sieges==

===First siege===

The Earl of Essex&#x27;s campaign failed, suffering a total defeat at the Battle of Lostwithiel in early September 1644. His remaining forces retreated back to Dorset, leaving only Plymouth, Lyme Regis and Taunton under Parliamentarian control in the South West. Blake was aware of the vulnerability of Taunton, which, unlike many towns and cities of the time, did not have any town walls. On the eastern side of the town, which was the most vulnerable, he dug trenches outside the Eastern gate and erected a barricade across the street within it. At least three earthen forts were also built in that end of town. King Charles I held council in Chard, and shortly after ordered a Royalist force numbering 3,000 troops to set up the first siege of Taunton. Initially, Sir Francis Dodington was going to command the attack, but the only available men were those in Bridgwater under the command of Colonel Edmund Wyndham.

The siege began on 23 September 1644. Wyndham was assisted in the attack by his brother, Francis Wyndham, who brought his garrison from Dunster Castle, and Edward Rodney, who commanded an infantry regiment. The Royalist forces initially set themselves up around the town, where they were able to use their artillery to bombard the castle from the west and the town from the east. In his record of the siege, Morris claims that the besieging forces were unable to establish a presence in the town, and set up a wide perimeter roughly away. However, almost all other sources agree that after initial skirmishes, the Royalists broke through the eastern defences and forced Blake&#x27;s troops back into the castle itself.

During the siege, Edmund Wyndham and Blake exchanged letters; Wyndham initially wrote to explain that he felt the siege was a gentle method of attack, rather than using &quot;fire and sword&quot;. He offered generous terms for surrender, and signed the letter &quot;Your well-wishing Neighbour and Country-man&quot;; the pair had served as members of parliament together for Bridgwater in 1640. Blake was unmoved, and wrote back to unequivocally reject the offer. Blake sent skirmishing parties out against the attackers with some success, though food and ammunition began to run out for the defending troops. To further this, Wyndham heavily rationed the town&#x27;s population to prevent them smuggling food to the garrison. A petition to Parliament for help was answered when Sir William Waller, who commanded the Parliamentarian army in Wiltshire, sent a force of 3,000 men under the command of his deputy, Major General James Holborne, in support of the town.

Wyndham had initially planned to attack Holborne&#x27;s forces at Chard, but instead retreated back to his garrison at Bridgwater on 14 December. He recorded that during his retreat, &quot;the enemy sallied upon me but they were so hungry that they could not follow me.&quot; The day after the arrival of Holborne, a supply caravan containing food, 2,000 muskets and 40 barrels of gunpowder restocked the town. Fearing further Royalist assaults, Holborne provided 1,000 of his own men as reinforcements for the town&#x27;s defence.

===Second siege===
In early 1645, Blake sent raiding parties out from Taunton that, according to Hyde, controlled a large area and disrupted activities throughout Somerset. Around that time, Lord Goring, the lieutenant-general of the south-eastern counties in the Royalist army, requested troops from the King so that he could mount a &quot;large-scale southeastern campaign&quot;. His request was rejected, and he was despatched to the South West instead. He duly changed his focus, electing to target first Weymouth, and then Taunton, both Parliamentarian strongholds in the area. He took Weymouth, but was unable to hold it in the face of Parliamentarian reinforcements. In a letter he received from the King shortly after that loss, he was ordered to gather the Royalist forces of the area together in order to &quot;[clear] those parts of the rebels&#x27; forces.&quot;
The King sent orders for Sir Richard Grenville and John Berkeley to support Goring in the attack on Taunton. Goring arrived outside Taunton on 11 March, and a sizeable part of Berkeley&#x27;s garrison from Exeter arrived soon after. Grenville did not leave his siege of Plymouth and, coupled with the threat from a Parliamentarian force formed by Waller and Oliver Cromwell combining their armies in Hampshire, the attack on Taunton was postponed. After further urging from the King and the Prince of Wales, Grenville did eventually travel up towards Taunton and was ordered to follow Goring to support the King in the north, as Grenville&#x27;s force of 3,000 men was considered too small to assault Taunton. He refused, claiming that &quot;he had promised the commissioners of Devon and Cornwall, that he would not advance beyond Taunton&quot;, while also boasting that he could claim the town in ten days. He was delegated command of the siege, and arrived outside Taunton on 2 April. Only a day after his arrival, Grenville was injured while attacking Wellington House, and as the wound was serious, he was carried to Exeter.

The blockade set by Grenville was initially some distance from the town, and did not prevent Blake from sending and receiving messages. The besieging army was reinforced soon after with Goring&#x27;s infantry and artillery units, and so, with a large force, the attackers closed in on the town, establishing entrenchments within musket-shot of Taunton&#x27;s defences. Command of the siege passed to Berkeley, though Grenville&#x27;s troops often failed to follow the new commander&#x27;s orders, and some of them deserted. Despite Grenville&#x27;s retirement from the battle due to injury, he and Berkeley clashed; Grenville complained to the Prince of Wales that Berkeley was conducting the siege badly, while Berkeley claimed that Grenville had given his men orders to desert. These disagreements led Hopton, by now the commander of the Royalist forces in the West Country, to be given command of the siege.

As the siege continued, supplies once again began to run out for the defending army, and Parliament identified the relief of Taunton as being a priority. On 28 April, they ordered Thomas Fairfax, the Commander in Chief of the recently established New Model Army, to relieve the town. Fairfax marched with the whole of his army towards Taunton; the Royalists considered sending their own army to meet him before he could reach London, but Prince Rupert convinced them instead to focus on conquering the north of England. In response to the Royalist movement north, Fairfax split his own army in two, sending a force of between 6,000 and 7,000 on to Taunton under Colonel Ralph Weldon, while Fairfax led the rest north.

Aware that the Parliamentarians under Fairfax were on their way, Hopton increased the attacks on the town on 6 May. Further attacks the following day focused on the east side of the town, first bombarding it with cannon shot, and then storming the earthen redoubt that Blake had established. After some early success in which they captured one of the earthen forts, the attackers were forced back by a combination of musket shot, stones and boiling water. The next day, after yet more attacks made little impact, Hopton staged a battle on the south side of the town between two parties of his own army in an attempt to make Blake believe the Parliamentarian army had arrived. Hopton hoped that Blake would send out some of his own men to support the relieving force, but the feint failed. That evening, at around 7 pm, the Royalist force, which consisted of around 4,200 infantry and 2,000 cavalry, launched an all-out assault against the town. In heavy fighting, the attackers captured two of the earthen forts on the eastern side of town, and broke through the defences. Once inside Blake&#x27;s outer perimeter, the besieging army discovered that there were Parliamentarian musketeers within every house, which prevented them advancing any further, though they did set fire to buildings, hoping to force the defenders to retreat. The tactic failed when the wind blew the flames back towards the Royalists, halting their attack.

The attack was renewed around 11 am on 9 May, and over the next seven hours, Hopton&#x27;s army advanced slowly through the town. His forces pushed the Parliamentarian troops back one building at a time, until they were left with only a small area of land in the middle of the town. Within the perimeter was the castle, an entrenchment in the market square, St Mary Magdalene Church and an earthen defence known as &quot;Maiden&#x27;s fort&quot;. By this time, a combination of artillery and arson attacks had set most of the east side of town on fire. An attempt by three people—two men and a woman—to set fires inside the remaining defences was quashed, and the culprits lynched.

Further assaults were made on 10 May, along with a demand for Blake and his men to surrender, to which Blake responded that he &quot;had four pairs of boots left and would eat three of them before he yielded.&quot; Weldon&#x27;s relieving force had met with small parties of the Royalist army around Chard and Pitminster, and they sent an advance party ahead of them, which reached Orchard Portman, roughly south of Taunton, on 10 May. Fearing that they were facing the entirety of Fairfax&#x27;s army, Hopton ordered his forces to abandon their attacks and retreat to Bridgwater. As they left, they felled trees across roads to slow the Parliamentarian advance. Weldon&#x27;s army arrived in Taunton on 11 May, relieving and restocking the town. Accounts of Taunton&#x27;s losses vary between 50 and 200 killed, with 200 or more casualties on top of that, while two thirds of the houses in the town had been razed. Having relieved Taunton, Weldon and his army left the following day and marched eastwards.

===Third siege===

Over the course of the siege, Lord Goring had been with the King in Oxford, and on 10 May he returned to Bristol with a royal warrant pronouncing him the Commander of the Royalist Army in the West Country, replacing Hopton. Goring began his operations by harrying Weldon&#x27;s army, and forcing them to retreat back to Taunton. Goring, commanding about 10,000 men, established a third siege of the town in under a year. He ignored orders from the King for him to support the Royalist efforts in the Midlands, claiming that &quot;Taunton would be taken in a few days.&quot; Despite his promises, he soon discovered that his army was too small to enact a rapid takeover of the town, and he established a loose blockade. Hyde, who is frequently scathing of Goring in his description of the Civil War, recalls that &quot;Goring was so far from making any advance upon Taunton, that he grew much more negligent in it than he had been; suffered provisions, in great quantities, to be carried into the town.&quot; As well as being lax in his siege, Goring was often drunk and—reminiscent of the earlier siege—was deserted by many of his troops.

The regional commander of the Parliamentarian forces, Colonel Edward Massey, was ordered to relieve Taunton in June, but he could only raise 3,000 men; far less than was needed to dispel Goring&#x27;s army. The New Model Army, with Fairfax at their head, were busy in the Midlands defeating the bulk of the Royalist army at the Battle of Naseby, described by modern sources as &quot;the decisive clash of the English Civil War&quot;. Goring had been ordered by the King to abandon his siege and join the Royalist forces at Naseby, and it has been suggested by modern historians that with his forces, and his leadership, the Royalists might have won the battle. Immediately after securing that victory, Fairfax led his army down towards Taunton once again. Aware of the approaching army, Lord Goring mounted a final assault on the town, hoping to catch Blake unaware by sending his cavalry towards the town on 9 July. The attack was neutralised by a section of Fairfax&#x27;s army in Ilminster, and Goring withdrew from Taunton to meet Fairfax at the Battle of Langport, relieving the third and final siege of Taunton during the English Civil War.

==Aftermath==
In his history of Taunton, H. J. Wickenden suggests that over half of the town was burned or destroyed during the three sieges, while Diane Purkiss claims that it was as high as two thirds of the town. Several compensation payouts were made to the town and some of its residents, funded by fines against those who had fought for the Royalists, such as Sir William Portman, who had been the Member of Parliament for Taunton at the outbreak of the war and was fined £7,000. Although the Parliamentarians destroyed many of the castles that had featured in the Civil War, Taunton Castle was considered a Parliamentarian stronghold, and remained intact. In 1647, only two years after the end of the sieges, the castle was sold as part of the estate of Taunton Manor. In 1660, shortly after taking the throne, Charles II stripped Taunton of its town charter for its part in the Civil War, and had the castle&#x27;s outer walls removed.

After commanding the defence of Taunton, Blake was ordered to capture Dunster Castle, which he achieved after a nine-month siege. After the war, he was honoured by Parliament for his efforts and rewarded with £500, while a further £2,000 was split amongst his men. He took no side during the Second Civil War and, three years later, under the Commonwealth of England, he became a general at sea, as one of the three commissioners of the navy, and spent the rest of his life as a naval commander, for which he remains best known.

<doc id="240596" wikidata="Q593929" url="?curid=240596" title="Strays (Jane's Addiction album)">
<text>Strays is the third studio album by American rock band Jane&#x27;s Addiction, released on July 22, 2003, on Capitol Records. Released 13 years after &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot; (1990), the album marks the band&#x27;s longest gap between full studio albums, although the group had recorded and released two new songs six years prior on the compilation album &quot;Kettle Whistle&quot; (1997). &quot;Strays&quot; is the first album to feature bassist Chris Chaney. Regarding the decision to record a new studio album after such a long hiatus, drummer Stephen Perkins stated that the band had already completed two reunion tours performing old material, and that Jane&#x27;s was ready for &quot;a new challenge.&quot;

Upon its first week of release, the album sold 110,500 copies in the United States, debuting at number four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, and was eventually certified Gold. The single, &quot;Just Because&quot;, was nominated for a Grammy Award in 2004.

==Background and recording==
&quot;I keep kind of asking, &#x27;Hey, want to work on something fresh? Let&#x27;s just see where we end up,&#x27;&quot; remarked singer Perry Farrell in 2001. &quot;I don&#x27;t want it to be premeditated, but my wish is that we do kick into it and do a full, new Jane&#x27;s Addiction album… I made the best music with these guys.&quot;

According to drummer Stephen Perkins, &quot;It all started around March or April 2002 with Bob Ezrin producing a Porno for Pyros track for the movie &quot;Dark Blue&quot;: an incredible song called &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; which was just epic. That segued into the &quot;Strays&quot; project.&quot;

The band entered Henson Recording Studios in 2002, with producers Ezrin and Brian Virtue. Of the former, Farrell said: &quot;He raises the bar for all of us. It&#x27;s like training for the Olympics - something you&#x27;re aspiring towards in creating art. You&#x27;re trying to make the most beautiful music, you try to break new ground creating sound that no one&#x27;s ever heard before. When working with Bob, doing that becomes a very real possibility.&quot;

Bassist Martyn LeNoble was fired halfway through the recording. &quot;I recorded pretty much the whole &quot;Strays&quot; record,&quot; he said. &quot;And Perry erased it. He suddenly fired me on the spot in Japan when we still had a whole flight back to the U.S. That&#x27;s the last time I talked to him. Perry and Bob (Ezrin) replaced all my bass parts on &quot;Strays&quot;. Perry was saying everything I played sounded like shit, but then they had the new guy pretty much play exactly my parts, maybe a couple of little changes, so I guess they couldn&#x27;t have been that shitty.&quot; LeNoble was aggrieved by the band not paying him for his studio work after his firing, which caused him financial hardship.

LeNoble was replaced by Chris Chaney, whom Dave Navarro described as &quot;perhaps the most intense musician I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&quot; &quot;Dave and Stephen have been playing together since they were 13 years old,&quot; Chaney noted. &quot;They have quite a synergy or chemistry – and for me as a bass player to be able to come into that is really remarkable. It gives me a great opportunity to shine. I did a record with Tommy Lee and we needed a drummer to go tour with, and what better drummer than Stephen Perkins. I was only able to do it for about six weeks because I was playing with Alanis Morissette and I had to go back to that. But, in that short time, Stephen and I had a great relationship and last August he called me and asked me to do some shows.&quot;

===Artwork===
Cover artwork created for the album by Storm Thorgerson was rejected by the band, and used instead on &quot;The Bottom Half&quot; by Umphrey&#x27;s McGee. &quot;I had thought, mistakenly, how appropriate my onion ladies would be,&quot; recalled Thorgerson, &quot;following in the footsteps of &quot;Nothing&#x27;s Shocking&quot; and &quot;Ritual de lo Habitual&quot;, but with an added dash of silliness… Worse was to come: Jane&#x27;s Addiction decided instead to use a photo of the band on their cover: not so clever nor razor-like. Nothing gets my goat more than being turned down in favour of mediocrity or crap.&quot;

=== Musical style and inspirations ===

Vocalist Perry Farrell states that the band &quot;went into the studio thinking fast, hard, modern and to the point.&quot; &quot;Strays&quot; was labeled by critics as &quot;nu metal&quot;, a genre which the band was a precursor to.

===DualDisc version===
This album was included among a group of 15 DualDisc releases that were test-marketed in two cities: Boston and Seattle. The DualDisc version of the album was not reissued after the test-market run. It has the standard album on the CD side and bonus material on the DVD side, including a 5.1 surround mix of the entire album.

The surround mix is encoded in Dolby Digital and lossless MLP (DVD Audio), and is only available on the DualDisc. All other bonus material is identical with the album&#x27;s regular CD/DVD version.

==Reception==

The album received generally positive reviews, with a Metacritic score of 75, based on 19 reviews. Playlouder noted, &quot;Their glee and enthusiasm can be heard coursing through every bar.&quot; &quot;NME&quot; cited it as &quot;one of the best rock albums of 2003&quot;. Alternative Press called it &quot;better than anyone could have predicted.&quot; &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; said, &quot;The new Jane&#x27;s sounds a lot like the old Jane&#x27;s. It is hard rock, with none of the trippiness that defined singer Perry Farrell&#x27;s post- Addiction band, Porno for Pyros, or the electronic maundering that marred his lone solo album, 2001&#x27;s &quot;Song Yet to Be Sung&quot;.&quot; IGN awarded &quot;Strays&quot; 7.5 out of 10 and stated, &quot;Basically the band has not ventured too far from the sounds they exhibited on 1990&#x27;s &quot;Ritual De La Habitual&quot; &quot;[sic]&quot;, making &quot;Strays&quot; sound like the follow-up that could/should have happened 13 years ago. All of which makes me wonder what this album would have sounded like if they&#x27;d been making music together during the past decade. Yet despite these shortcomings, &quot;Strays&quot; is a valiant effort by a band that not only changed the face of Los Angeles rock, but still knows how to (rock, that is).&quot;

&quot;There&#x27;s much of the old aggression and quirkiness,&quot; noted &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;with early Farrell influence The Cure poking their way to the surface… but it&#x27;s cleaner, tighter, more direct. Often, such as with &#x27;Strays&#x27; itself, this approach works extremely well: the band power on as Navarro peels off double-tracked and imaginative solos. Farrell&#x27;s vocal is more conventional, but now and then returns reassuringly to the yelp of old – although now sparingly deployed for greater effect.&quot;

Giving the album a C+, Stylus Magazine noted that it is &quot;good in its own right, but perhaps you&#x27;re better off listening to it in isolation from the rest of their canon&quot;. Pitchfork Media claimed, &quot;&quot;Strays&quot; lacks what made the band great in the first place: believable songs and lyrics.&quot;

In 2005, &quot;Strays&quot; was ranked number 404 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2009, Navarro stated that he &quot;really liked [&quot;Strays&quot;]. I had a great time working with Bob Ezrin, who produced it. That&#x27;s what makes doing stuff like this really amazing for me.&quot; In 2011, Perkins stated that the album was &quot;an interesting point in our sound.&quot;

==Selected quotes==

* Perry Farrell: Working with Bob Ezrin on &quot;Strays&quot; meant a lot because I knew that Dave loved Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, which Ezrin produced. Dave learned &quot;The Wall&quot; (as a kid). He can play the whole album note for note. I knew he&#x27;d instantly have a lot of respect for him.
* Bob Ezrin: My job on &quot;Strays&quot; was to bring a sort of commonality to the process and make everyone think it was a group effort again and not just a bunch of solo projects trying to be strung together.
* Martyn LeNoble: Bob Ezrin didn&#x27;t really understand Jane&#x27;s Addiction musically. I remember arguing with him, &quot;Have you listened to &quot;Ritual&quot;?&quot; He goes, &quot;Frankly, I can&#x27;t get through it. I think it sounds horrible. I&#x27;m going to make this a real rock band instead of an art rock band.&quot; Well, he succeeded. He took all the magic out of it. He made a rock record. The most magical moments on the Jane&#x27;s Addiction records are the quiet little adventures to the left, and, of course Eric Avery&#x27;s magic bass.

<text>General James Inglis Hamilton (1728 – 27 July 1803) was a Scottish soldier. He enlisted in the British Army in 1755 and commanded several regiments. He was the only colonel of the 113th Regiment of Foot. During the Seven Years&#x27; War (1756–1763), Hamilton fought in the Siege of Fort St Philip, the Raid on St Malo, and the Capture of Belle Île.

In the American War of Independence (1775–1783), Hamilton fought in the Invasion of Canada and the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, commanding the middle column during the latter. He was in the Convention Army, imprisoned in Cambridge, Massachusetts after its surrender following the Battles of Saratoga. While a prisoner of war, he adopted James Hamilton, the son of a non-commissioned officer in the British Army.

After his brother&#x27;s death, Hamilton took over Murdostoun, where he renovated the castle extensively. Under the 15th Regiment of Foot, Hamilton participated in Battle of Martinique as well as the Invasion of Guadeloupe in the French Revolutionary Wars. He died on 27 July 1803 at Murdostoun and is buried at Kirk O&#x27; Shotts graveyard. His adopted son took over Murdostoun before dying at the Battle of Waterloo.

== Early life ==
Very little is known of Hamilton&#x27;s early life. He was the third son of Alexander (died 1768) and Margaret Hamilton (died 1742). His two older brothers were Alexander (died 1783) and Gavin Hamilton (1723–1798), the latter a painter and archeologist in Rome. Inglis was added to the family name in 1719 as a condition of the will by which Alexander Inglis bequeathed Murdostoun to his nephew Alexander Hamilton, James&#x27;s father.

== Seven Years&#x27; War ==
Hamilton enlisted in the British Army on 28 February 1755 and was stationed at Portsmouth. He first saw action in June 1756 at the Siege of Fort St Philip, part of the Seven Years&#x27; War. Assigned to the 34th Regiment of Foot, he was one of the 2,800 British soldiers fighting under the command of William Blakeney against 15,000 Frenchmen under the Duke de Richelieu and Roland-Michel Barrin de La Galissonière. The French sailed to Fort St. Philip and forced the British to surrender. During the siege, Admiral John Byng sailed there with a relief group, hoping to save the island for the British, but was unsuccessful. The French killed or wounded 400 British in the French victory.
Hamilton fought in the Raid on St Malo in June 1758. The British landed near St Malo, at first planning to attack the town. However, they decided to destroy shipping first and attack the town later. Finding that to occupy the town would require a full siege, for which they had insufficient troops, they occupied St Servan, where they burned over one hundred vessels including thirty privateers. British ships retreated after seeing a large French force, but sailed around the coast for a few weeks seeking another place to attack. Even though the Raid on St Malo was small and little damage was done, it is considered a British victory.

In 1761, Hamilton took part in the Capture of Belle Île as one of the 5,000 British troops led by Studholme Hodgson. The first attempt by the British was unsuccessful and lost approximately 500 troops. With reinforcements, a second attempt succeeded on 7 June 1761.

On 17 October 1761, while holding the rank of major, Hamilton became major commandant (colonel) of the 113th Regiment of Foot. It was formed from independent companies and served as a depot for sending drafts to Highland regiments serving overseas. The regiment disbanded in 1763, and Hamilton retired on half pay. He became a lieutenant-colonel on 25 May 1772.
== American War of Independence ==
In 1774, Hamilton commanded the 21st Regiment of Foot in the American War of Independence; General John Burgoyne said that he &quot;was the whole time engaged and acquitted himself with great honor, activity, and good conduct.&quot; Early in 1776, while in the 21st Regiment, Hamilton accompanied General Guy Carleton in the British response to the Continental Army&#x27;s 1775 invasion of Quebec. On 15 September 1776 he was appointed temporary commander of the 1st Brigade when Brigadier General Nesbit fell ill. Upon Nesbit&#x27;s death, Hamilton was promoted to brigadier. He was assigned to the 2nd Brigade, which consisted of the 34th, 53rd, 62nd, and 20th Regiments of Foot. It was originally intended to include Hamilton&#x27;s 21st Regiment of Foot in the brigade, but it was replaced by the 53rd.

=== Saratoga campaign ===
Hamilton helped General Burgoyne organize troops for his campaign to divide the rebellious provinces. He was assigned to the 1st Brigade, comprising the 9th, 47th, and 53rd Regiments of Foot. Later, when Henry Watson Powell transported the 62nd Regiment to Fort Ticonderoga, the 1st and 2nd Brigades were amalgamated.
On 19 September 1777, in Stillwater, New York, Hamilton commanded 1,100 men of the centre column, consisting of the 9th, 20th, 21st, and 62nd Regiments of Foot, which attacked the heights at the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm. His column was arrayed with the 21st on the right, the 20th on the left, the 62nd in the middle, and the 9th in reserve. To his left, Friedrich Adolf Riedesel commanded the 47th Regiment of Foot and some German troops. To Hamilton&#x27;s right, Simon Fraser commanded the 24th Regiment of Foot along with light infantry and grenadiers. Even though Hamilton was considered the commander, Burgoyne led the attack.
The centre column migrated toward the southwest to meet up with the right column. During the battle, Colonel Daniel Morgan of the United States led a charge, but Hamilton&#x27;s men turned it back and the British won the battle. Burgoyne had gained the field of battle, but suffered nearly 600 casualties, mostly in Hamilton&#x27;s centre column, where the 62nd was reduced to the size of a single company and three-quarters of the artillery men were killed or wounded. American losses were nearly 300 killed and seriously wounded.

In the next battle, the Battle of Bemis Heights, Hamilton was not as engaged as he was at Freeman&#x27;s Farm. He was the guard of the camp near the heights. He was in the Convention Army that surrendered after the battle, among about 5,900 troops that surrendered at Saratoga. The prisoners arrived at Cambridge, Massachusetts on 8 November 1777. William Phillips commanded the Convention Army until he was exchanged for American General Benjamin Lincoln in 1780; then Hamilton became the commander. While a prisoner of war, Hamilton adopted a boy named Jamie Anderson (1777–1815), the son of Sergeant Major William Anderson of the 21st Foot. Hamilton name was &quot;signed to the parole given by the officers ... in December&quot;. The Convention Army had to move to Charlottesville, Virginia and arrived around January 1779. Hamilton was released on 3 September 1781, subject to the condition that he could not travel to America until the war was over.
== Later life ==

After his exchange, Hamilton returned to Britain, where he funded his adopted son&#x27;s education at Glasgow University. Because of his high rank, Hamilton was able to obtain a commission for his son, who became a cornet in 1792. The boy changed his name to James Hamilton when he enlisted in the British Army.

Around 1790, Hamilton made various renovations to Murdostoun: filling the turret staircase and the old dungeons, adding a parapet running round the roof-line, and changing the original courtyard. On his brother Galvin&#x27;s death in 1798, Hamilton took over Murdostoun. He came to be considered as one of the most influential freeholders in Lanarkshire.

Hamilton was the colonel of the 15th Regiment of Foot from 22 August 1792 to 1794, during which he took part in the 1790s West Indies Campaign. The 15th Foot was awarded the battle honour Martinique 1794 (5 February – 25 March). During the battle, the 15th Foot was a part of the First Brigade, which consisted of the 39th and 43rd Regiment of Foot and was led by Sir C. Gordon.

The regiment also saw service at Guadeloupe (12 April) the same year. He was colonel of his old regiment, the 21st Foot, from 1794 to 1803. While with them he was promoted to lieutenant-general on 26 January 1797 and to full general on 29 April 1802. Hamilton died on his estate in Scotland on 27 July 1803. On 18 August 1803, his son, who was his only heir, took over Murdostoun. James was killed while commanding the Royal Scots Greys at the Battle of Waterloo.

<text>Play was a Swedish pop girl group. Faye Hamlin, Anna Sundstrand, Anaïs Lameche, and Rosie Munter formed Play&#x27;s original lineup from the band&#x27;s formation from 2000 until late 2003. After founding member Hamlin left the group, fifth member Janet Leon joined Play to fill Hamlin&#x27;s position as lead singer. In 2005, the group officially announced an &quot;indefinite break&quot; and split up. At that time, Play had sold almost one million albums. Four years later, in 2009, the group reformed with a new lineup of three members consisting of Lameche, Hamlin, and the sixth and oldest member of Play, Sanne Karlsson. In February 2011, an official statement was made that Hamlin had once again left the group in 2010 and would be replaced by Emelie Norenberg. It was announced in May 2011 that the band had separated for the second time.

==History==
===2000–2002: Formation and &quot;Us Against the World&quot;===
Play was formed in 2000 as a result of a nationwide talent search led by Laila Bagge, a recording artist and dance studio owner. Her original lineup for Play consisted of four girls. Two girls were discovered at her dance studio: eleven-year-old Anna Sundstrand and thirteen-year-old Anaïs Lameche, younger sister of recording artist Amanda Lameche. The other two girls were found in the audition process: thirteen-year-olds Faye Hamlin and Rosie Munter, the latter of which had also starred in the popular Swedish film called &quot;Eva &amp; Adam: Fyra födelsedagar och ett fiasko&quot;. Hamlin and Munter had also been best friends before being selected to be in Play. Play&#x27;s career was launched both in Sweden and in the United States in 2001 and 2002. Their first single and video, &quot;Us Against the World&quot;, was released in Sweden on 11 September 2001. The song hit number 14 on the Sverigetopplistan chart, and was later certified Gold. The single was released in the United States in January 2002, it charted at number 10 on Billboard&#x27;s Hot 100 Singles Sales chart and stayed on the chart for 65 weeks. The song also charted in France, and Germany. In Sweden, Play&#x27;s first full-length English-language album, &quot;Us Against the World&quot;, was released on 12 December 2001. In the United States the album was released on 25 June 2002 and named as &quot;Play&quot;. In 2002, the group released the second single, &quot;Cinderella&quot;.

Play toured in the United States in the coming months, opening for Aaron Carter and Destiny&#x27;s Child. While touring in the USA, the group often partnered with the groups clothing chain Limited Too. Play&#x27;s song &quot;M.A.S.T.E.R. part 2&quot;, which features Lil&#x27; Fizz of B2K and lead vocals by Hamlin, was also featured in the 2002 film &quot;The Master of Disguise&quot;, for which they filmed a video with numerous well-known soundtrack contributing artists including Lil&#x27; Fizz, J-Boog, Jhené Aiko and Solange Knowles. Their hit song &quot;Us Against the World&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Holiday in the Sun&quot;, and also on the &quot;Lizzie McGuire&quot; series soundtrack. The group concluded 2002 with an appearance on the nationally televised Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade where they stood atop the Build-a-Bear float and performed a rendition of &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Make You Love Me&quot; which they had previously recorded with Chris Trousdale of Dream Street. The album peaked at number seventy-four on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was certified gold on 24 March 2003 for sales of 500,000 copies.

===2003–2004: &quot;Replay&quot; and second lineup===
Play returned to the studio to begin recording their second album, &quot;Replay&quot;. Prior to the release of their second album, a DVD titled &quot;Playin&#x27; Around&quot; was released and featured several Play music videos, special &quot;Making of&quot; segments, footage from a live concert, and clips of the members from Play recording and preparing for their second album. &quot;Replay&quot;, a more mature and R&amp;B-influenced effort, was released on 10 June 2003. On the day of release, Play made several appearances to promote the album, including a guest spot on popular daytime talk show &quot;Live with Regis and Kelly&quot;. During the &quot;Replay&quot; era, Hamlin emerged as the group&#x27;s lead singer. The album debuted at number sixty-seven and managed to stay in the top 200 albums for seven weeks. The first single was &quot;I Must Not Chase the Boys&quot; and the music video made was aired on MTV&#x27;s TRL and made the top 10 requested videos countdown. It also managed to be featured on Carson Daly&#x27;s radio show as one of his picks of the week. The song was also used for a promo for the Nickelodeon cartoon &quot;My Life As a Teenage Robot&quot;. Play continued to tour in 2003 and they also appeared on several Nickelodeon television specials as featured guests and performers. The group also released the second and final single from Replay, a cover of Atomic Kitten&#x27;s &quot;Whole Again&quot;.

In October 2003, Play&#x27;s lead singer, sixteen-year-old Hamlin, decided to leave Play to pursue a college education. Hamlin continued to make appearances with Play until December 2003, and appeared in Play&#x27;s video &quot;It&#x27;s a Hard Knock Life&quot; which was featured on a DVD re-release of the hit musical film &quot;Annie&quot;. On 15 December, a formal press release on the group&#x27;s official site informed fans of the lineup change and introduced new member, Janet Leon, who would become Play&#x27;s new lead singer along with Lameche.

===2004–2005: &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, &quot;Play Around the Christmas Tree&quot; and split===
In 2004, Play became affiliated with everGirl, a doll and fashion brand from Nickelodeon. The group recorded the everGirl theme song as well as a music video.

Play&#x27;s third US album, &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot;, was released on 9 March 2004. The first single, &quot;Every Little Step&quot;, featured Aaron Carter and the second single was the everGirl theme song. This album was aimed more at a younger audience. The title track from the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Stop the Music&quot; was originally written and recorded by Swedish singer Robyn. The album is one of Play&#x27;s least successful albums, failing to chart on Billboard.

In November 2004, Play released their fourth US album, a Christmas collection entitled &quot;Play Around the Christmas Tree&quot;. The album also failed to chart on the Billboard 200, and is their other worst selling album. Little news of Play was heard until the release of their compilation album entitled &quot;Girl&#x27;s Mind&quot; which was released in April 2005. The album features ten of Play&#x27;s best-known songs, and all feature Hamlin&#x27;s vocals. Play never came to the US to promote &quot;Girl&#x27;s Mind&quot;, and it was not widely released in stores across the country. It was their third consecutive album also failing to chart on Billboard 200. After a long period of no activity, in September 2005 an official statement from the members of Play confirmed that they were on an indefinite break as a group. At that time, Play had sold almost one million albums.

===2009–2011: Reunion, &quot;Under My Skin&quot; and second split===

On 26 November 2009, Hamlin and Lameche appeared on the Swedish radio stations NRJ and RIXFM, along with another singer named Sanne Karlsson. They then announced as a trio, they would return as &quot;Play&quot; and were to partake in the filming of reality show &quot;Made in Sweden&quot; just like former member Janet was. Sundstrand was not included in the reunion due to living in the United States. Munter was originally to be in the reunion, but dropped out three weeks before filming &quot;Made in Sweden&quot; in order to pursue a solo career as a singer/songwriter. This meant that Play had to find another member, which resulted in Karlsson joining the group. With the new lineup in place, Play recorded a full album in four weeks and on 27 November 2009, Play made their first public appearance in over 4 years since disbanding in 2005. &quot;Made In Sweden&quot; aired in December 2009, and followed the group searching for a new member, training, choosing and recording songs, recording the music video for &quot;Famous&quot; and following them on their journey to re-enter the music scene along with the Made In Sweden team: Andreas Carlsson, Anders Bagge and their old manager, Bagge. The reality programme consisted of four episodes. In 2009, Play was also a judge for the 8th annual Independent Music Awards to support independent artists&#x27; careers.

The lead single of their first studio album in six years was titled &quot;Famous&quot;. It was the original theme tune for &quot;Made in Sweden&quot; the previous year, sung by Andreas Carlsson. There was some debate on whether to release &quot;Famous&quot; or &quot;Girls&quot; as the comeback single, but in the end &quot;Famous&quot; was chosen as the single. &quot;Famous&quot; debuted at number five, and in its next week peaked at number one. It became Play&#x27;s only number one single of all time. It was later remade by &quot;Big Time Rush&quot; for their TV show on Nickelodeon. The group&#x27;s new album, &quot;Under My Skin&quot;, was released on 21 April 2010. It debuted and peaked at number seven on the Swedish Albums Chart, making it their first album to chart in Sweden. In October, Play recorded a song called &quot;Destiny&quot; for the Disney Channel Original Movie &quot;Avalon High&quot;. However, just before the group were about to enter the studio to record the song, Hamlin called Bagge and told her that she had once again decided to leave the group. Hamlin&#x27;s vocals are therefore not present in the song. It was also announced that Hamlin would not be joining Lameche and Karlsson for the promotion of the song. The song premiered on 26 October on Radio Disney. Hamlin had not been mentioned in the group&#x27;s blog, nor seen with the others since late September, and some were doubting her place in the band. Multiple sources stated that Hamlin was writing and recording a solo album, and more pictures cropped of Hamlin on her own. Due to the search of a new member, Hamlin&#x27;s decision to leave the group was not revealed to the public until February 2011, when Play announced that Emelie Norenberg, Karlsson&#x27;s best friend, who knew many of the other former members, would become the newest member of Play. This left Lameche as the only original member of the group, and the only member to be in every incarnation of the group.

Lameche, Karlsson and Norenberg were planning a return to the United States and release an EP. However, on 23 May 2011, it was announced after a lack of news, that the plans that were made for the group would not happen and that the group had broken up for a second and final time. The band split up in early 2011. Moreover, it was later revealed through an official statement that the members were no longer on speaking terms for a variety of reasons. The reason was apparently due to the group not meeting after their trip to L.A. and some things were said about the commitment of some of the members. They have each since gone their separate ways both professionally and personally.

<text>In finance, the style or family of an option is the class into which the option falls, usually defined by the dates on which the option may be exercised. The vast majority of options are either European or American (style) options. These options—as well as others where the payoff is calculated similarly—are referred to as &quot;vanilla options&quot;. Options where the payoff is calculated differently are categorized as &quot;[[exotic option]]s&quot;. Exotic options can pose challenging problems in valuation and hedging.

==American and European options==
The key difference between American and European options relates to when the options can be exercised:

* A European option may be exercised only at the expiration date of the option, i.e. at a single pre-defined point in time.
* An American option on the other hand may be exercised at any time before the expiration date.

For both, the payoff—when it occurs—is given by

* formula_1, for a call option
* formula_2, for a put option

where formula_3 is the strike price and formula_4 is the spot price of the underlying asset.

Option contracts traded on futures exchanges are mainly American-style, whereas those traded over-the-counter are mainly European.

Most stock and equity options are American options, while indexes are generally represented by European options. Commodity options can be either style.

===Expiration date===
Traditional monthly American options expire the third Saturday of every month (or the third Friday if the first of the month begins on a Saturday). They are closed for trading the Friday prior. 

European options traditionally expire the Friday prior to the third Saturday of every month. Therefore, they are closed for trading the Thursday prior to the third Saturday of every month.

===Difference in value===
Assuming an arbitrage-free market, a partial differential equation known as the Black-Scholes equation can be derived to describe the prices of derivative securities as a function of few parameters. Under simplifying assumptions of the widely adopted Black model, the Black-Scholes equation for European options has a closed-form solution known as the Black-Scholes formula. In general, no corresponding formula exist for American options, but a choice of methods to approximate the price are available (for example Roll-Geske-Whaley, Barone-Adesi and Whaley, Bjerksund and Stensland, binomial options model by Cox-Ross-Rubinstein, Black&#x27;s approximation and others; there is no consensus on which is preferable). Obtaining a general formula for American options without assuming constant volatility is one of finance&#x27;s unsolved problems.

An investor holding an American-style option and seeking optimal value will only exercise it before maturity under certain circumstances. Owners who wish to realise the full value of their option will mostly prefer to sell it as late as possible, rather than exercise it immediately, which sacrifices the time value. See early exercise consideration for a discussion of when it makes sense to exercise early.

Where an American and a European option are otherwise identical (having the same strike price, etc.), the American option will be worth at least as much as the European (which it entails). If it is worth more, then the difference is a guide to the likelihood of early exercise. In practice, one can calculate the Black–Scholes price of a European option that is equivalent to the American option (except for the exercise dates). The difference between the two prices can then be used to calibrate the more complex American option model.

To account for the American&#x27;s higher value there must be some situations in which it is optimal to exercise the American option before the expiration date. This can arise in several ways, such as:

* An in the money (ITM) call option on a stock is often exercised just before the stock pays a dividend that would lower its value by more than the option&#x27;s remaining time value.
* A put option will usually be exercised early if the underlying asset files for bankruptcy.
* A deep ITM currency option (FX option) where the strike currency has a lower interest rate than the currency to be received will often be exercised early because the time value sacrificed is less valuable than the expected depreciation of the received currency against the strike.
* An American bond option on the dirty price of a bond (such as some convertible bonds) may be exercised immediately if ITM and a coupon is due.

==Less common exercise rights==
There are other, more unusual exercise styles in which the payoff value remains the same as a standard option (as in the classic American and European options above) but where early exercise occurs differently:

===Bermudan option===
*A Bermudan option is an option where the buyer has the right to exercise at a set (always discretely spaced) number of times. This is intermediate between a European option—which allows exercise at a single time, namely expiry—and an American option, which allows exercise at any time (the name is jocular: Bermuda, a British overseas territory, is somewhat American and somewhat European—in terms of both option style and physical location—but is nearer to American in terms of both). For example, a typical Bermudian swaption might confer the opportunity to enter into an interest rate swap. The option holder might decide to enter into the swap at the first exercise date (and so enter into, say, a ten-year swap) or defer and have the opportunity to enter in six months time (and so enter a nine-year and six-month swap); see Swaption: Valuation. Most exotic interest rate options are of Bermudan style.

===Canary option===
* A Canary option is an option whose exercise style lies somewhere between European options and Bermudian options. (The name refers to the relative geography of the Canary Islands.) Typically, the holder can exercise the option at quarterly dates, but not before a set time period (typically one year) has elapsed. The ability to exercise the option ends prior to the maturity date of the product. The term was coined by Keith Kline, who at the time was an agency fixed income trader at the Bank of New York.

===Capped-style option===
* A capped-style option is not an interest rate cap but a conventional option with a pre-defined profit cap written into the contract. A capped-style option is &quot;automatically exercised&quot; when the underlying security closes at a price making the option&#x27;s mark to market match the specified amount.

===Compound option===
* A compound option is an option on another option, and as such presents the holder with two separate exercise dates and decisions. If the first exercise date arrives and the &#x27;inner&#x27; option&#x27;s market price is below the agreed strike the first option will be exercised (European style), giving the holder a further option at final maturity.

===Shout option===
* A shout option allows the holder effectively two exercise dates: during the life of the option they can (at any time) &quot;shout&quot; to the seller that they are locking-in the current price, and if this gives them a better deal than the payoff at maturity they&#x27;ll use the underlying price on the shout date rather than the price at maturity to calculate their final payoff.

===Double option===
* A double option gives the purchaser a composite call-and-put option (an option to either buy or sell) in a single contract. This has only ever been available in commodities markets and has never been traded on exchange.

===Swing option===
* A swing option gives the purchaser the right to exercise one and only one call or put on any one of a number of specified exercise dates (this latter aspect is Bermudan). Penalties are imposed on the buyer if the net volume purchased exceeds or falls below specified upper and lower limits. Allows the buyer to &quot;swing&quot; the price of the underlying asset. Primarily used in energy trading.

===Evergreen option===
* An evergreen option is an option where the buyer has the right to exercise by providing a pre-determined period of notice. This option could be either American or European in nature or alternatively it could be combined with option styles that have non-vanilla exercise rights. For example, an &#x27;Evergreen-Bermudan&#x27; option provides the buyer of the option with the right to exercise at set specific points in time after providing the other counterparty with a pre-determined period of notice of their intent to exercise the option. Evergreen options provide sellers with a period of time to prepare for settlement once the buyer has exercised their rights under the option. Embedding evergreen optionality within on and off-balance sheet products can enable counterparties (such as banks that must adhere to Basel III) to lengthen their inflow or outflow obligations.

==&quot;Exotic&quot; options with standard exercise styles==
These options can be exercised either European style or American style; they differ from the plain vanilla option only in the calculation of their payoff value:

===Composite option===
* A cross option (or composite option) is an option on some underlying asset in one currency with a strike denominated in another currency. For example, a standard call option on IBM, which is denominated in dollars, pays formula_5 (where S is the stock price at maturity and K is the strike price). A composite stock option might instead pay formula_6, where formula_7 is the prevailing exchange rate, that is, formula_8 on the exercise date. The pricing of such options naturally needs to take into account exchange rate volatility and the correlation between the exchange rate of the two currencies involved and the underlying stock price.

===Quanto option===
* A quanto option is a cross option in which the exchange rate is fixed at the outset of the trade, typically at 1. These options are often used by traders to gain exposure to foreign markets without exposure to exchange rate. Continuing the example from the composite option, the payoff of an IBM quanto call option would then be formula_9, where formula_10 is the exchange rate fixed at the outset of the trade. This would be useful for traders in Japan who wish to be exposed to IBM stock price without exposure to JPY/USD exchange rate.

===Exchange option===
* An exchange option is the right to exchange one asset for another (such as a sugar future for a corporate bond).

===Basket option===
* A basket option is an option on the weighted average of several underlyings.

===Rainbow option===
* A rainbow option is a basket option where the weightings depend on the final performances of the components. A common special case is an option on the worst-performing of several stocks.

===Low Exercise Price Option===
* A Low Exercise Price Option (LEPO) is a European style call option with a low exercise price of $0.01.

===Boston option===
* A Boston option is an American option but with premium deferred until the option expiration date.

==Non-vanilla path-dependent &quot;exotic&quot; options==
The following &quot;exotic options&quot; are still options, but have payoffs calculated quite differently from those above. Although these instruments are far more unusual they can also vary in exercise style (at least theoretically) between European and American:

===Lookback option===
* A lookback option is a path dependent option where the option owner has the right to buy (sell) the underlying instrument at its lowest (highest) price over some preceding period.
* A Russian option is a lookback option that runs for perpetuity. That is, there is no end to the period into which the owner can look back.

===Asian option===
* An Asian option (or average option) is an option where the payoff is not determined by the underlying price at maturity but by the average underlying price over some pre-set period of time. For example, an Asian call option might pay MAX(DAILY_AVERAGE_OVER_LAST_THREE_MONTHS(S) − K, 0).
* There are two types of Asian options: Average Price Option (fixed strike) and Average Strike Option (floating strike). 
* Asian options were originated in commodity markets to prevent option traders from attempting to manipulate the price of the underlying security on the exercise date. 
* They were named &#x27;Asian&#x27; because their creators were in Tokyo when they created the first pricing model

===Game option===
* A game option or Israeli option is an option where the writer has the opportunity to cancel the option offered, but must pay the payoff at that point plus a penalty fee.

===Cumulative Parisian option===
* The payoff of a cumulative Parisian option is dependent on the total amount of time the underlying asset value has spent above or below a strike price.

===Standard Parisian option===
*The payoff of a standard Parisian option is dependent on the maximum amount of time the underlying asset value has spent &quot;consecutively&quot; above or below a strike price.

===Barrier option===
* A barrier option involves a mechanism where if a &#x27;limit price&#x27; is crossed by the underlying, the option either can be exercised or can no longer be exercised.

===Double barrier option===
* A double barrier option involves a mechanism where if either of two &#x27;limit prices&#x27; is crossed by the underlying, the option either can be exercised or can no longer be exercised.

===Cumulative Parisian barrier option===
* A cumulative Parisian barrier option involves a mechanism, in which if the total amount of time the underlying asset value has spent above or below a &#x27;limit price&#x27; exceeds a certain threshold, then the option can be exercised or can no longer be exercised.

===Standard Parisian barrier option===
* A standard Parisian barrier option involves a mechanism, in which if the maximum amount of time the underlying asset value has spent consecutively above or below a &#x27;limit price&#x27; exceeds a certain threshold, the option can be exercised or can no longer be exercised.

===Reoption===
* A reoption occurs when a contract has expired without having been exercised. The owner of the underlying security may then reoption the security.

===Binary option===
* A binary option (also known as a digital option) pays a fixed amount, or nothing at all, depending on the price of the underlying instrument at maturity.

===Chooser option===
* A chooser option gives the purchaser a fixed period of time to decide whether the derivative will be a vanilla call or put.

===Forward start option===
* A forward start option is an option whose strike price is determined in the future.

===Cliquet option===
* A cliquet option is a sequence of forward start options.

<text>Taunton () is the county town of Somerset, England. It is a market town and has a minster church. Its population in 2011 was 64,621. Its thousand-year history includes a 10th-century monastic foundation, owned by the Bishops of Winchester, which was rebuilt as Taunton Castle by the Normans in the 12th century. Parts of the inner ward house were turned into the Museum of Somerset and Somerset Military Museum. For the Second Cornish uprising of 1497, Perkin Warbeck brought an army of 6,000; most surrendered to Henry VII on 4 October 1497. On 20 June 1685, the Duke of Monmouth crowned himself King of England in Taunton in the failed Monmouth Rebellion. Judge Jeffreys led the Bloody Assizes in the Castle&#x27;s Great Hall.

The Grand Western Canal reached Taunton in 1839 and the Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1842. Today it hosts Musgrove Park Hospital, Somerset County Cricket Club, is the base of 40 Commando, Royal Marines, and is home to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office on Admiralty Way. The popular Taunton Flower Show has been held in Vivary Park since 1866, and on 13 March 2022, St Mary Magdalene parish church was elevated to the status of Taunton Minster.

==History==
The town name derives from &quot;Town on the River Tone&quot; or Tone Town. Cambria Farm, which now hosts a park and ride close to the M5 motorway Junction 25, was the site of Bronze and Iron Age settlement and a Roman farm. There was a Romano-British village near the suburb of &quot;Holway&quot;. Taunton was important in Anglo-Saxon times as a burh with a mint. King Ine of Wessex threw up an earthen castle about 700, but it was levelled in 722 by his queen, Æthelburg of Wessex, to prevent seizure by rebels.

A monastery was founded before 904. The bishops of Winchester owned the manor, and obtained the first charter for their &quot;men of Taunton&quot; from King Edward in 904, freeing them from all royal and county tribute. Some time before Domesday, Taunton became a borough with privileges and a population of some 1,500, including 64 burgesses governed by a portreeve appointed by the bishops. Somerton took over from Ilchester as county town in the late 13th century, but declined; the county-town status passed to Taunton about 1366. Between 1209 and 1311 the Bishop of Winchester&#x27;s manor of Taunton expanded two-and-a-half times. The parishes of Staplegrove, Wilton and Taunton were part of Taunton Deane hundred.

In 1451, during the Wars of the Roses, Taunton saw a skirmish between the Earl of Devon, and Baron Bonville. Queen Margaret and her troops passed through in 1471 to defeat at the Battle of Tewkesbury. In the Second Cornish uprising of 1497 most Cornish gentry supported Perkin Warbeck&#x27;s cause and on 17 September a Cornish army some 6,000 strong entered Exeter before advancing on Taunton. Henry VII sent his chief general, Giles, Lord Daubeney, to attack the Cornish. When Warbeck heard that the King&#x27;s scouts were at Glastonbury he panicked and deserted his army. On 4 October 1497, Henry VII reached Taunton, where he received the surrender of the remaining Cornish army. Ringleaders were executed and others fined a total of £13,000.

Taunton Castle changed hands several times in the Civil War of 1642–1645, as did the town. During the Siege of Taunton it was defended by Robert Blake from July 1644 to July 1645, and suffered destruction of many medieval and Tudor buildings. On 20 June 1685, the Duke of Monmouth crowned himself King of England at Taunton during the Monmouth Rebellion. In the autumn of that year Judge Jeffreys lived in the town during the Bloody Assizes that followed the Battle of Sedgemoor.

The town lacked a charter of incorporation until 1627. This was renewed in 1677, but lapsed in 1792 due to vacancies in the corporate body, and was not reincorporated until 1877. The medieval fairs and markets (a weekly market remains) were celebrated for the sale of woollen cloth called &quot;Tauntons&quot; made in the town. On the decline of the woollen industry in the west of England, silk-weaving was introduced at the end of the 18th century.

In 1839 the Grand Western Canal reached Taunton, aiding southward trade, which was enhanced by the arrival of the railway in 1842.

A permanent military presence came to Jellalabad Barracks in 1881.

In the Second World War, the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal formed part of the Taunton Stop Line, set to curb any advance of a German invasion. Pillboxes can still be seen along its length.

A fire aboard a to London sleeping car train approaching Taunton in 1978 killed 12 passengers and injured 15 others.

===Regeneration===
Taunton was rated &quot;strategically important&quot; in the government&#x27;s Regional Spatial Strategy, allowing Somerset County Council to receive funding for large-scale regeneration projects. In 2006, the council revealed plans dubbed &quot;Project Taunton&quot;. This would see regeneration of the areas of Firepool, Tangier, the retail town centre, the cultural quarter, and the River Tone, to sustain Taunton as business hub in the South West.
The Firepool area, just north of the town centre by the main railway station, includes vacant or undeveloped land. The council is promoting sustainable, high-quality, employment-led mixed-use development to attract 3,000 new jobs and 500 new homes.

In Tangier, a brownfield area between Bridgwater and Taunton College and the bus station, the project proposed to build small offices and more riverside housing.

The &quot;Cultural Quarter&quot; is the area along the river between Firepool and Tangier. The plans are to extend riverside retail and attract smaller, boutique businesses such as those found at Riverside.

Plans for the town centre include more pedestrianisation and greater sizes and numbers of retail units.

Several sites along the River Tone are set for renovation. Firepool Weir lock, long silted up, was to be dredged in 2011 to allow boats to pass from the navigable section of the Tone through Taunton to the Bridgwater and Taunton Canal. Goodland Gardens received a makeover and a new café, The Shed, opened. Projects to develop Somerset Square (a paved area next to the Brewhouse Theatre) and Longrun Meadow (a country park near Bridgwater &amp; Taunton College) have been put forward.

Traffic congestion was identified as an obstacle to further economic growth. Part of the strategy was a new road infrastructure consisting of a £7.5 million link road to ease traffic in the town centre (Taunton&#x27;s &quot;Third Way&quot;), completed in 2011, and a Northern Inner Distributor Road linking Staplegrove Road, the station and Priory Avenue at a planned cost of £21 million, opened in 2017.

==Governance==
Taunton is governed by a parish/town council and the unitary authority of Somerset Council.

===Parish / Town Council===
A large part of the town was unparished from the 1974 local government reorganisation until 1 April 2023, when a new Parish Council came into being following a Community Governance Review held by Somerset West and Taunton Council.

While the town was unparished, Charter Trustees made up of the district councillors representing wards in the unparished area elected a Mayor and Deputy Mayor.

The first elections to the new parish council were held on 4 May 2023 with 19 Liberal Democrat councillors and one Conservative councillor being elected to represent 14 wards. The council is expected to formally resolve to adopt the style of a Town Council at its first meeting.

===Borough Council===

Taunton was the main settlement and centre of the local government district of Taunton Deane. The district, formed on 1 April 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, by merging the municipal borough of Taunton, Wellington urban district, Taunton Rural District, and Wellington Rural District, was granted borough status in 1975, perpetuating the mayoralty of Taunton. The district was named as an alternate form of the Taunton hundred. Taunton Deane Council, once based at the Municipal Buildings in Corporation Street, moved to modern facilities at Deane House on Belvedere Road in spring 1987.

Taunton Deane merged with West Somerset to form Somerset West and Taunton in 2019,
and was abolished on 1 April 2023 when Somerset Council took over.

===Former County Council===

Somerset County Council, which was based at County Hall in Taunton from 1974-2023, consisted of 55 councillors. The town has broadly six electoral divisions, each of which had a single county councillor: Taunton North; Taunton East; Taunton South; Bishop’s Hull &amp; Taunton West; Comeytrowe &amp; Trull, Monkton &amp; North Curry (which includes rural areas).

On 1 April 2023, Somerset&#x27;s county council and four district councils were replaced by a single unitary authority called Somerset Council with elections for the new authority&#x27;s 110 councillors (two per electoral division) having taken place on 5 May 2022.

===Parliament===
Taunton and Wellington is a county constituency of the House of Commons. It is based on the town, but extends to Wellington. The current MP is Gideon Amos of the Liberal Democrats.

==Geography==
Taunton lies on the River Tone between the Quantock, Blackdown and Brendon hills. The area is known as the Vale of Taunton. It is surrounded by many other large towns and cities seen on this directional compass:

Taunton is south-west of Bristol, north-east of Exeter, north-east of Plymouth and north-west of Weymouth.

===Geology===
The Taunton area has Permian red sandstones and breccia outcrop 295250million years old. Rocks of Triassic age (248204million years ago) underlie much of Somerset&#x27;s moors and levels.

===Nature reserves===
The several local nature reserves in and around Taunton are protected under Section 21 of the National Parks and Access to the Countryside Act 1949. South Taunton Streams is an urban wetland. The northern suburbs include the Children&#x27;s Wood riverside reserve, a movement corridor for animals such as otters along the banks of the Tone. Birds include the kingfisher, dipper, grey wagtail, mute swan, grey heron and reed warbler and butterflies the small and large skipper, marbled white, small heath and small copper, along with dragonflies and damselflies.

Weirfield Riverside, a nature reserve along the River Tone, has alder and willow woodland, bramble, scrub and rough grassland. The wetter, flood-prone areas feature hemlock water-dropwort, and yellow flag. Silk Mills Park and Ride offer landscaping and ponds in three areas by the Tone. The woodland and grassland support aquatic and marginal vegetation, with various birds, bats, reptiles and invertebrates. Frieze Hill Community Orchard has turned from allotments to rough grassland and orchard. Among the apples grown are Kingston Black and Yarlington Mill.

===Climate===
Like most of South West England, Taunton has a temperate climate, wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is about . Seasonal temperature variation is less extreme because of the adjacent sea. The summer months of July and August have mean daily maxima of about . In winter, mean minimum temperatures of or are common. In the summer the Azores high pressure affects the south-west of England, but convective cloud sometimes forms inland, reducing the sunshine hours. Annual sunshine rates are slightly under the regional average of 1,600hours. Most of the rainfall in the south-west is caused by Atlantic depressions or by convection – in autumn and winter by the former, which are then at their most active. In summer, much rainfall results from the sun heating the ground, leading to convection, showers and thunderstorms. Average rainfall is about . Some 815days of snowfall are typical. November to March have the highest mean winds and June to August the lightest. The prevailing wind direction is from the south-west.

==Demography==

The town of Taunton (which for population estimates includes the unparished area or former municipal borough plus the neighbouring parishes of Bishop&#x27;s Hull, Comeytrowe, Norton Fitzwarren, Staplegrove, Trull and West Monkton) had an estimated population of 61,400 in 2001. Taunton includes Holway, once a village in its own right as one of the &quot;Five Hundreds of Taunton Deane&quot;, the Infaring division or district of three districts that made up Taunton Deane.

Taunton is the largest town in the Somerset shire county and forms part of the larger borough of Taunton Deane, which includes the town of Wellington and surrounding villages. This had an estimated population of 109,883 in 2010.

The figures here are for the Taunton Deane area.
In 2011, Taunton built-up area had a population of 60,479 and the surrounding borough of Taunton Deane one of 110,187. Of Taunton&#x27;s residents 91.6 per cent were White British in 2011, compared with 93.4 per cent for Taunton Deane. Taunton&#x27;s ethnic mix resembles that of South West England – 91.8 per cent White British in the same year. It is also matches other major regional centres like Poole and Plymouth. The larger urban area, extending to Monkton Heathfield, Norton Fitzwarren and Bathpool, had a 2011 population of 64,621.

==Economy==

Taunton Deane had low unemployment of 4.1 per cent compared with a national average of 5.0 per cent in 2005.

Taunton is home to the United Kingdom Hydrographic Office (UKHO), a Ministry of Defence body responsible for providing navigational and other hydrographic information for national, civil and defence requirements. The UKHO is located on Admiralty Way and has a workforce of about 1100. At the start of the Second World War, chart printing moved to Taunton, but the main office did not follow until 1968. Taunton holds the head offices of Western Provident Association, Viridor and CANDAC. Other professional services are based at Blackbrook near the motorway junction.

The first store of the multinational New Look clothing retailer opened in Taunton in 1969. Taunton is also famed for cider.

==Landmarks==

Gray&#x27;s Almshouses in East Street, founded by Robert Gray in 1615 for poor single women, are red brick buildings bearing the arms of Robert Gray, dated 1635, and another arms of the Merchant Tailors. A small room used as a chapel has original benches and a painted ceiling. It has been classed by English Heritage as a Grade I listed building.

St Margaret&#x27;s Almshouses was founded as a leper colony in the 12th century. Glastonbury Abbey acquired patronage of it in the late 13th century and rebuilt it as almshouses in the early 16th. From 1612 to 1938 the building continued as such, cared for by a local parish. In the late 1930s it was converted into a hall of offices for the Rural Community Council and accommodation for the Somerset Guild of Craftsmen. It later fell into disrepair. The Somerset Buildings Preservation Trust with Falcon Rural Housing purchased and restored it for use as four units of social housing. It is a Grade II* listed building.

The grounds of Taunton Castle include the Somerset County Museum and The Castle Hotel, which incorporates the Castle Bow archway. With the municipal buildings they form a three-sided group just beyond the Castle Bow archway from Fore Street. A plain brick Mecca Bingo hall fills the west side of it.

The frontage of the Fore Street &quot;Tudor Tavern&quot;, now a Caffè Nero branch, dates from 1578, but the rest is thought to be from the 14th century.
The riverside area north of the centre is edged by Morrisons supermarket, retirement housing and the Brewhouse Theatre. Towards the centre are the Zinc Nightclub, Bridge Street and Goodlands Gardens. A current regeneration programme north of Bridge Street will include redeveloping the County Cricket Ground, which hosted open-air concerts for Elton John in 2006 and 2012 and for Rod Stewart in 2014.

===Shopping===
Hankridge Farm, a retail park close to the M5 motorway, has stores that include Currys PC World, Oak Furniture Land, Hobbycraft, Halfords, B&amp;Q, The Range and the town&#x27;s second Sainsbury&#x27;s. There is a Venue in the park with restaurants, an Odeon cinema and a Hollywood Bowl bowling alley. It is now known as Riverside Retail Park.

Taunton has three other such parks. Belvedere is near the town centre. St Johns is just off Toneway, towards the motorway, and consists of two units, occupied by DFS, joined by Go Outdoors in April 2014. Taunton&#x27;s second largest retail park is Priory Fields in Priory Avenue, with eight units and an anchor store, Wickes. It was redeveloped in 2003 to modernise a rather worn-out retail park and increase retail floor space.

The Old Market was a farmers&#x27; market in the Parade in front of Market House, but then moved to the Firepool area, although cattle trading on the site ceased only in 2008. A large indoor shopping centre to the east of the Parade covers a site that was once a pig market. Although its official name is now Orchard, and before that the Old Market Centre, locals still call it the Pig Market; one existed there from 1614 to 1882.

County Walk is a small indoor shopping arcade in the town centre with an anchor supermarket, Sainsbury&#x27;s, and several other large national retailers such as Subway, Costa Coffee, and Savers.

===Public parks===

Taunton&#x27;s public parks include Vivary Park, Goodlands Park and Victoria Park. The most notable is Vivary, on land that was once a medieval fish farm or &quot;vivarium&quot; for Taunton Priory and Taunton Castle. Fronted by a pair of cast iron gates from the Saracen Foundry of Glasgow, it contains the Sherford Stream, a Tone tributary that flows through the park, which is near the town centre. It has two main open spaces and a war memorial dating from 1922, a miniature golf course, tennis courts, two children&#x27;s playgrounds, a model railway track added in 1979, and an 18-hole, 4620-yard, par-63 golf course. The park includes trees, rose beds and herbaceous borders, with some 56,000 spring and summer bedding plants used each year. The rose garden includes the Royal National Rose Society Provincial Trial Ground. Taunton Flower Show held annually in the park since the 19th century. It has been described as &quot;The Chelsea of the West&quot;, and draws some 24,000 visitors over two days. Goodlands Gardens, in the centre of the town, is behind the former Debenhams department store and The Castle Hotel.

===Pride Rainbow Path===

The Pride Rainbow Path in Goodland Gardens, Taunton town centre, runs alongside the River Tone. Designed by Jenny Keogh and Liz Hutchin of GoCreate, it opened on 28 June 2021 to mark the anniversary of the Stonewall riots, which served as a catalyst for the gay rights movement. It is believed to be the first such path in the UK. The opening coincided with the first Taunton Pride in July 2021 and the Pride inspired Art Trail.

The far end of the 62-metre path includes the chevron of Daniel Quasar&#x27;s &quot;Progress&quot; flag, which incorporates the transgender flag and ethnic minorities, while the majority of the path uses the traditional LGBT rainbow. The path has been designed not to require maintenance for 15 years. It was funded by Taunton&#x27;s Emergency Town Centre Recovery Fund and is intended to reflect Taunton&#x27;s commitment to inclusivity and diversity.
==Transport==
===Railway===
Taunton railway station is a principal stop on the Bristol to Exeter line, the Reading to Taunton line and the Cross Country Route. It is served by two train operating companies:
* Great Western Railway operates services to , , , , and . It also manages the station.
* CrossCountry provides services to , , , , , Plymouth and Penzance.

The former railway to was closed in 1971 and is now a heritage railway; West Somerset Railway provides services between and Minehead.

In 2009, &quot;Project Taunton&quot;, the authority responsible for Taunton&#x27;s regeneration, revealed proposals for Taunton metro rail, under a transport sustainability plan. They were not implemented.

===Road===
Taunton has road links with the M5 motorway junctions 25 (Taunton) and 26 (Wellington) close to the town, and other major roads such as the A38 and A358. The Taunton bypass section of the M5, between the two junctions, opened in April 1974 and relieved the town of heavy holiday traffic on the A38. Taunton Deane services use that motorway section.

A strong economy increases traffic; in 2011, the County Council foresaw a sharp rise from 2001 levels. Two major roads opened: the Third Way (A3807) linking Bridge Street and Castle Street in 2011, and the Northern Inner Distributor Road (A3087) between Staplegrove Road and Priory Avenue in July 2017.

====2011 M5 crash====

On the evening of 4 November 2011, 34 vehicles met with an accident near junction 25 of the M5 motorway northbound, on the north-eastern edge of the town at West Monkton. Seven people were killed and a further 51 injured.

===Buses and coaches===

Bus services in the Taunton area are detailed below:
* Many local services are provided by The Buses of Somerset; their routes operate to Minehead, Bridgwater and Yeovil. Its route 28 links the railway stations at Taunton and Bishops Lydeard. Other services are provided by Hatch Green Coaches. Taunton bus station was in Tower Street from 1953 until 2020. Most services now terminate at stops on The Parade or Castle Way.
* Taunton&#x27;s park and ride service operates between Taunton gateway near the M5 motorway and Silk Mills on the north-west side of town. It is operated by Stagecoach, who also operate the Falcon coach service between Plymouth, Taunton and Bristol.
* Berrys Coaches, based in Taunton, operates several &#x27;Superfast&#x27; services to London, as well as operating services on behalf of Flixbus. National Express runs long-distance coach services to many destinations.

===Air===
The nearest airports are Exeter and Bristol, both within of Taunton.

===Trams===

Taunton Tramway opened on 21 August 1901. Six double-decker cars operated on a gauge line between the railway station and the depot at East Reach. In 1905 the service was withdrawn for two months while the track was improved; the cars were replaced by six single-decker cars and the old double deckers sold to Leamington Spa. A short extension beyond the station to Rowbarton opened in 1909, making the line long. However, the price of its electricity was due to rise in 1928 to a level the firm refused to pay, and it offered to sell out, but this was not accepted. The electricity was cut off on 28 May 1921 and the system closed.

===Canal===
The Bridgwater and Taunton Canal is a navigable waterway that links Taunton with Bridgwater, opened in 1827. Having been closed to navigation in 1907, it re-opened after restoration in 1994.
==Education==

State secondary schools in Taunton include The Castle School, Monkton Wood Academy, Bishop Fox&#x27;s School and The Taunton Academy. Further education is offered by Richard Huish College, The Taunton Academy (sponsored by Richard Huish College) and Bridgwater and Taunton College. Heathfield Community School has a post-16 further education college specialising in performing arts and technical theatre called The SPACE (The Somerset Performing Arts Centre for Education). Heathfield Community School is also a teaching school and the base of Taunton Teaching Alliance. The Taunton campus of Bridgwater and Taunton College is a partner of Plymouth University and includes University Centre Taunton. There are three co-educational private schools: Queen&#x27;s College, King&#x27;s College and Taunton School.

In March 2009, it was found that Jim Knight, Minister of State for Schools and Families, had approved the closure of Ladymead Community School and the nearby St Augustine of Canterbury RC/CoE School in the Priorswood area of Taunton. They gave way in September 2010 to the Taunton Academy.

Young people with special educational needs are provided for by two special schools and one complex Pupil Referral Unit (PRU). Sky College caters for boys aged 10–18 who have social, emotional and mental-health difficulties. Selworthy School has pupils of 4–19 who have complex and multiple learning difficulties, while the Taunton Deane Partnership College is a complex PRU for children in Key Stages 2, 3 and 4, with a Medical Tuition Service, Outreach &amp; Advisory Service and an Area Access Team.

==Health services==
Taunton is within Somerset Primary Care Trust and home to Musgrove Park Hospital. This is one of two district hospitals in Somerset NHS Foundation Trust, alongside Yeovil Hospital. A Nuffield Hospital also lies in the town, run privately by Nuffield Health. The town has several medical surgeries and a family planning clinic, an occupational health centre and a chiropractic clinic.

==Religious sites==
The Taunton Minster Church of St Mary Magdalene, built of sandstone more in the South Somerset style, retains an attractive painted interior, but its prime feature is a 15th and 16th-century tower rebuilt in the mid-19th century. It is one of the country&#x27;s best examples and a landmark high. It was termed by Simon Jenkins, &quot;the finest in England. It makes its peace with the sky not just with a coronet but with the entire crown jewels cast in red-brown stone.&quot; It holds 12 bells and 3 bells &quot;hung dead&quot; for the clock.

Close by is the parish church of St James near the centre of Taunton close. The oldest parts are early 14th century; there are fragments of 15th-century glass in the west end. Like St Mary&#x27;s, it has a sandstone tower, but built to a less impressive design. It too was rebuilt in the 19th century, in this case due to building defects in the original. It backs onto the County Ground.

The church of St John the Evangelist was built in 1858 to serve the poor of the town. The church of St Andrew, built 1878, serves the area of Rowbarton.

In the later 17th century, Taunton had two Dissenting places of worship: &quot;Paul&#x27;s Meeting&quot; and the Baptist Meeting. The former was built at the top of Paul Street soon after 1672 on a bowling green behind the &quot;Three Cups Inn&quot;, now The County Hotel, and rapidly became one of the largest congregations in the county. After Mayor Timewell sacked both Paul&#x27;s Meeting and the Baptist Meeting in 1683, the dissenters were driven to worship in private houses on the outskirts of Taunton, where their assemblies were regularly raided by the Justices of the Peace. Paul&#x27;s Meeting survived attempts to turn it into a workhouse, and with the coming of William III and Mary II, followed by the Toleration Act 1688, it reopened. Hugh Willoughby, 15th Baron Willoughby of Parham, was educated in early life at Taunton Dissenters&#x27; Academy. The Baptist Meeting became the Baptist New Meeting, registered in 1691 and rebuilt in 1721 as Mary Street Chapel.

Taunton Unitarian Chapel, dating from 1721, stands in Mary Street. Samuel Taylor Coleridge, while living at Nether Stowey away, came to the chapel to preach several times. Dr Malachi Blake, who founded the Taunton and Somerset Hospital in East Reach, Taunton, was also a preacher there, attending in 1809 a celebration of the 50th year of George the Third&#x27;s reign. The chapel retains its original interior, including Flemish oak pillars in Corinthian style. The pews and pulpit are also in oak. There is an early 18th-century candelabra.

St George&#x27;s, the town&#x27;s Roman Catholic church, dates from the mid-19th century. It was the second Catholic church built in Taunton since the Reformation, replacing a smaller St George&#x27;s Chapel. The main building is designated by English Heritage as a Grade II* listed building, while the clergy house is Grade II listed.

==Culture==
Taunton town centre has the Brewhouse Theatre. It closed in February 2013 due to financial difficulties, but reopened in April 2014 under the Taunton Theatre Association (TTA), which was granted the 61-year lease that Taunton Deane Borough Council had bought on the site and its contents from the administrator. Tacchi-Morris Arts Centre is a professional theatre based at Monkton Wood Academy, hosting touring theatre, dance and comedy, and productions by South West schools and colleges. Tacchi-Morris Arts Centre also runs community classes. The Creative Innovation Centre CIC has an arts and culture venue in the town centre.

Several concerts a year are held at Taunton&#x27;s largest church, St Mary Magdalene. In recent years The Sixteen, The Tallis Scholars and Gabrieli Consort have all performed to full audiences. Taunton also has several choirs and orchestras that perform in the town&#x27;s churches and school chapels. Many music and drama groups are members of the Taunton Association of Performing Arts (TAPA), which produces a diary and calendar of performances in and about the town.

Taunton has three radio stations: BBC Radio Somerset, 
Tone FM, and Apple FM.

Since 2001, Taunton has been the base of a domestic violence charity, the ManKind Initiative, to help male victims of domestic abuse.

The County Ground was originally home to Taunton Cricket Club, formed in 1829. It played at the County Ground until 1977, before moving to Moorfields, Taunton, in conjunction with Taunton Vale Hockey Club, since when the County Ground has been solely used by Somerset County Cricket Club (CCC). Somerset CCC was formed in 1875, but did not achieve first-class status until 1891.

All three clubs play in the West of England Premier League or one of its feeder leagues.

Taunton Town Football Club (FC) plays at Wordsworth Drive. An earlier Taunton Town FC played at Priory Park in the 1930s, however the current team was formed in 1947 by local businessmen as &quot;Taunton FC&quot;, changing to the current name in 1968, and played its first friendly fixture in 1948. For most of its history, Taunton belonged to the Western League. It spent a six-season spell in the Southern League from 1977, and after a further period in the Western League, returned to the Southern League in 2002, after winning the FA Vase in 2001. The club won the Division One South and West league title in 2017/18 and narrowly missed out on further promotion in 2018/19. The club went on to become the 2021/22 champions of the Southern League Premier Division South, securing promotion to the National League South for the first time in the club&#x27;s history on 23 April 2022.

Somerset Vikings is a rugby league club formed in 2003 as part of the Rugby Football League&#x27;s plans to develop the game beyond its traditional north-of-England areas. Initially the side was made up of a mixture of Royal Marines based in Taunton and Exeter with local rugby union players keen to try the 13-man code. It plays at Hyde Park, also home to Taunton RFC.

The Huish Tigers (formerly Taunton Tigers) is a semi-professional men&#x27;s basketball team competing in the Somerset Basketball League. The team plays its home games at Richard Huish College. They also have a basketball academy with youth teams as well as a women&#x27;s team.
Taunton Racecourse is close to the Blackdown Hills, about from the centre of Taunton. Although racing had been held in the area before, the first race at thi site was held on 21 September 1927. The Orchard Stand and Paddock Stand provide catering facilities and are used for meetings and conferences on days when racing is not taking place. Greyhound racing was held at the Priory Park Sports Ground and County Cricket ground in the past.

<doc id="240606" wikidata="Q65521" url="?curid=240606" title="Jürgen Möllemann">
<text>Jürgen Wilhelm Möllemann (15 July 1945 – 5 June 2003) was a German politician of the Free Democratic Party (FDP) who served as Minister of State at the Foreign Office (1982–1987), as Minister of Education and Research (1987–1991), as Minister of Economics (1991–1993) and as the vice chancellor of Germany (1992–1993) in the government of Chancellor Helmut Kohl.

==Early life and career==
Jürgen Möllemann was born in Augsburg, Bavaria, Germany, on 15 July 1945. He took his &quot;Abitur&quot; in 1965, served his military service as a paratrooper in the Bundeswehr, and subsequently studied to become a teacher of German, sports and history at the &quot;Pädagogische Hochschule&quot; (teachers&#x27; college) in Münster from 1966 to 1969. He was president of the Deutsch-Arabische Gesellschaft (German-Arabic Society) from 1981 to 1991 and from 1993 until his death in 2003.

Möllemann was initially a member of the Christian Democratic Union (CDU) from 1962 to 1969, but later on became a member of the liberal Free Democratic Party (FDP) in 1970. He was a member of the Bundestag from 1972 to 2000 and again from 2002 to 2003. He was president of the FDP in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia from 1983 to 1994 and again from 1996 to 2002, and also was the chairman of the FDP faction in the state parliament of North Rhine-Westphalia from June 2000 to October 2002.

Under Chancellor Helmut Kohl, Möllemann occupied several cabinet positions in the 1980s and early 1990s. He served as Minister of State at the Foreign Office (1982–1987), as Minister of Education and Research (1987–1991), as Minister of Economics (1991–1993) and as the vice chancellor of Germany (1992–1993). Möllemann left the cabinet in 1993 after facing criticism for using an official letterhead for advertising a relative&#x27;s business idea (the so-called &quot;Briefbogen-Affäre&quot;).

In the 2002 federal election, Möllemann produced a flyer criticizing Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon&#x27;s actions against Palestinians and CDU politician Michel Friedman&#x27;s endorsement of those actions; the flyer was regarded as antisemitic by some, and the debate surrounding these events led to Möllemann leaving the FDP in March 2003 and resigning his position as party leader in North Rhine-Westphalia; however, he kept his seat in the Bundestag without party affiliation, despite promises to resign from it.

==Death==
Möllemann, a passionate and experienced skydiver, died on 5 June 2003 in a parachuting incident at Marl-Loemühle. His death was investigated by the Essen district attorney&#x27;s office, which published a final report on 9 July 2003. While outside interference was ruled out, no definite verdict was reached on whether Möllemann committed suicide or suffered an accident.

Shortly before his death, Möllemann had been confronted with allegations he had been involved in illegal arms dealing and evaded taxes on millions of euros he allegedly earned from those activities. To enable a full investigation on these charges, the Bundestag lifted his parliamentary immunity on 5 June 2003 at 12:28, twenty-two minutes before his death. The tax evasion charges were dropped after his death, while other investigations are ongoing.

==Personal life==
Möllemann was married to Carola Möllemann-Appelhoff, with whom he had two daughters.

<doc id="240607" wikidata="Q1054463" url="?curid=240607" title="Black model">
<text>The Black model (sometimes known as the Black-76 model) is a variant of the Black–Scholes option pricing model. Its primary applications are for pricing options on future contracts, bond options, interest rate cap and floors, and swaptions. It was first presented in a paper written by Fischer Black in 1976.

Black&#x27;s model can be generalized into a class of models known as log-normal forward models.

==The Black formula==
The Black formula is similar to the Black–Scholes formula for valuing stock options except that the spot price of the underlying is replaced by a discounted futures price F.

Suppose there is constant risk-free interest rate &quot;r&quot; and the futures price &quot;F(t)&quot; of a particular underlying is log-normal with constant volatility &quot;σ&quot;. Then the Black formula states the price for a European call option of maturity &quot;T&quot; on a futures contract with strike price &quot;K&quot; and delivery date &quot;T&quot;&#x27; (with formula_1) is

:formula_2

The corresponding put price is

:formula_3

where

:formula_4

:formula_5

and formula_6 is the cumulative normal distribution function.

Note that &quot;T&#x27; &quot;doesn&#x27;t appear in the formulae even though it could be greater than &quot;T&quot;. This is because futures contracts are marked to market and so the payoff is realized when the option is exercised. If we consider an option on a forward contract expiring at time &quot;T&#x27; &gt; T&quot;, the payoff doesn&#x27;t occur until &quot;T&#x27; &quot;. Thus the discount factor formula_7 is replaced by formula_8 since one must take into account the time value of money. The difference in the two cases is clear from the derivation below.

==Derivation and assumptions==
The Black formula is easily derived from the use of Margrabe&#x27;s formula, which in turn is a simple, but clever, application of the Black–Scholes formula.

The payoff of the call option on the futures contract is formula_9. We can consider this an exchange (Margrabe) option by considering the first asset to be formula_10 and the second asset to be formula_11 riskless bonds paying off $1 at time formula_12. Then the call option is exercised at time formula_12 when the first asset is worth more than formula_11 riskless bonds. The assumptions of Margrabe&#x27;s formula are satisfied with these assets.

The only remaining thing to check is that the first asset is indeed an asset. This can be seen by considering a portfolio formed at time 0 by going long a &quot;forward&quot; contract with delivery date formula_12 and long formula_16 riskless bonds (note that under the deterministic interest rate, the forward and futures prices are equal so there is no ambiguity here). Then at any time formula_17 you can unwind your obligation for the forward contract by shorting another forward with the same delivery date to get the difference in forward prices, but discounted to present value: formula_18. Liquidating the formula_16 riskless bonds, each of which is worth formula_20, results in a net payoff of formula_10.

<doc id="240609" wikidata="Q115546" url="?curid=240609" title="Willi Ritschard">
<text>Willi Ritschard (sometimes Willy Ritschard; 28 September 1918 – 16 October 1983) was a Swiss politician of the Social Democratic Party (SP). He is remembered as the first and to date only working class member of the Federal Council, the Swiss government. Prior to that, he was also a member of the cantonal government of Solothurn and a member of the National Council.

== Early life and education ==
Willi Ritschard was born on 28 September 1918 as the son of Ernst Emil Ritschard, a shoemaker in Deitingen and Social Democrat and Frieda (née Ryf), in Canton of Solothurn. As a child, he was beaten by his neighbors for being a son of left-wing workers. He lost both parents at the age of sixteen. He made an apprenticeship as a heating engineer but later got involved in the workers&#x27; union. He attended numerous classes at the Swiss Workers&#x27; Education Central which was established by the SP politician Max Weber.

== Career in the Workers Union ==
In 1945 he became the secretary of the Solothurn branch of the Construction and Woodworkers&#x27; Association (SBVH). On the Balmberg he established a Workers&#x27; Education School and in 1965, he became the president of the Association for the Furtherance of the Workers School, an office he held until he died. In the workers union, he argued that trade unions should not represent their demands for worker protection and social security on the streets, but instead together with the SP in the government. 

== Political career ==
In 1947, Ritschard became the president (Gemeindeamman) of Luterbach, a position which he held until 1959. In 1955 he was elected to the National Council (the lower house of the Federal Assembly). In the National Council, he made himself known as a defender of workers&#x27; rights and demanded the limitation of foreign workers in 1962, which made him popular beyond party lines. In 1964 he was elected to the executive council (the cantonal government) of Solothurn. He supported the inter-cantonal commission for the harmonization of taxation. He also supported nuclear energy and was on the board of directors of Atel (now Alpiq). The construction of the nuclear power plant in Gösgen, Solothurn, began in 1972. 

=== Federal Council ===

On 5 December 1973, Ritschard was elected to the Federal Council, where he assumed the leadership of the Department of Transport and Energy. He was elected despite not being the official candidate of his own party. He observed his election in front of a TV at home. 

In 1974, he called the nuclear energy supporter Michael Kohn to the Energy Commission, which caused some controversy within the anti-nuclear movement. In 1975, as protestors occupied the construction site for the nuclear plant in Kaiseraugst, Ritschard was able to calm the situation offering the occupiers a halt for its construction for the time negotiations would take place. In 1978 he presided over the Federal Council as that year&#x27;s President of the Swiss Confederation. The Nuclear Energy Act, which the Swiss citizens accepted in a national referendum in 1979, was enacted under his lead. He was not amused when he had to attend a royal banquet dressed in black tie on 1 May, International Workers&#x27; Day, on the occasion of Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s state visit to Switzerland in 1980. 

From 1980 onwards Ritschard was the head of the Federal Department of Finance. He announced his resignation on 28 September 1983 but died on 16 October 1983 before it could take effect.

== Legacy ==
Ritschard is remembered as the first Federal Councilor who belonged to the working class. He was a celebrity politician, and the punk band Hertz released a song about him while he was in office. His nickname was &quot;Willi National&quot;. He was a well-known speaker, credited with being authentic. He acknowledged that he did not write all his speeches by himself; some were written by the writer and journalist Peter Bichsel, his neighbor. Two books with quotes of his were released during his tenure as a Federal Councilor, one in 1975 and another in 1982. Both were published by the Benteli publishing house.

== Personal life ==
Ritschard and Greti Hostettler married in 1941 and had two children, Margaretha Ueker-Ritschard and Rolf Ritschard, the latter becoming a member of the executive council of Solothurn. 

Ritschard died on 16 October 1983, during a hike on the Grenchenberg near Grenchen. His funeral service took place in the St. Urs and Victor Cathedral in Solothurn on 20 October. He was buried in Luterbach, where in 2011 the Executive Council of Luterbach announced that Ritschard would be able to rest in Lautebach&#x27;s graveyard without restriction, and extended this right to all of Luterbach&#x27;s honorary citizens.

<text>Jason Curtis Newsted (born March 4, 1963) is an American musician, best known as the bassist of heavy metal band Metallica from 1986 to 2001. He performed with thrash metal band Flotsam and Jetsam for the first five years of his career before joining Metallica in October 1986 to succeed Cliff Burton, who died the month prior. Newsted performed on the albums &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1988), &quot;Metallica&quot; (1991), &quot;Load&quot; (1996), &quot;Reload&quot; (1997) and &quot;Garage Inc.&quot; (1998). He left the group in January 2001.

After leaving Metallica, Newsted was a member of metal bands Echobrain and Voivod, using the pseudonym Jasonic for the latter, and toured with Ozzy Osbourne. Since 2012, he fronts heavy metal band Newsted. Newsted was inducted to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Metallica in 2009.
== Early life ==
Jason Curtis Newsted was born in Battle Creek, Michigan. He has two older brothers and a younger sister.
He grew up on a farm and at the age of six was given the responsibility of looking after animals. He was tasked with looking after hundreds of chickens and rabbits. He told author Paul Stenning, &quot;It&#x27;s where I learned about life – seeing a baby cow born right in front of your eyes when you&#x27;re eight years old is pretty intense…I was from a very strong family and I was raised to be a strong, pure Americana farm boy.&quot;

Newsted&#x27;s mother taught piano and one of his brothers plays trumpet. He was exposed to music as a child, listening to the record collections of his older brothers. His first instrument was a guitar, which he started to play at 9 years old, but he moved to bass at 14, after listening to Gene Simmons of Kiss. Newsted dropped out of high school at age 18 and joined ‘Gangster’ a local metal band before the group decided to relocate to California.

Newsted cites Geezer Butler of Black Sabbath as his major influence. He lists Lemmy Kilmister of Motörhead, Steve Harris of Iron Maiden, Peter Baltes of Accept, Geddy Lee of Rush, Rob Grange of Ted Nugent, and Bill Church of Montrose as other significant influences.

==Career==
===Flotsam and Jetsam===

Following the breakup of Newsted’s band ‘Gangster’ amidst their move to California in 1982; Newsted wound up living in Phoenix, Arizona temporarily before he joined thrash metal band Flotsam and Jetsam. Newsted wrote the majority of lyrics for their 1986 album &quot;Doomsday for the Deceiver&quot;.

===Metallica===

On September 27, 1986, during the European leg of the Damage, Inc. Tour, Metallica&#x27;s bassist Cliff Burton died in a tour bus crash. Following Burton&#x27;s death, the group began a search for a new bassist. They considered and auditioned over 50 musicians, including Greg Christian of Testament, Gene Gilfen of Blind Illusion, Mel Sanchez of Abattoir, Mike Jastremski of Heathen, Troy Gregory, Les Claypool and various others. Newsted was the last in line and ended up winning the part.

Newsted said in a 2015 interview that he learned about Metallica&#x27;s plan to open for Ozzy Osbourne&#x27;s tour at the time. To his advantage, Newsted strategically procured the band&#x27;s setlist, studied it, and presented it to drummer Lars Ulrich saying he knew all these songs, much to Ulrich&#x27;s surprise. Two days later, Metallica invited Newsted back and told to him that he had been chosen to fill the bassist position. The band involved both of Burton&#x27;s parents in the decision to choose Newsted. After the band broke the news to Newsted, Burton&#x27;s mother hugged him tightly and said, &quot;You are the one. Please, be safe.&quot;

Newsted&#x27;s first live performance with Metallica was at the Country Club in Reseda, California, November 8, 1986. His studio debut with Metallica was on &quot;The $5.98 E.P. - Garage Days Re-Revisited&quot; in 1987 in which he was credited as ‘Master J Newkid’ in the liner notes. This was followed by his first studio album with the band, &quot;...And Justice for All&quot; (1988), which was criticized for its undermixed bass guitar and thin tone. Newsted claims this was deliberate on the part of Lars Ulrich and James Hetfield, although both Ulrich and Hetfield claim they were also disappointed with the production of the album. They claim that most or all of Newsted&#x27;s bass lines closely followed the rhythm guitar lines to the point of being indiscernible from each other. However, Steve Thompson, who mixed the album, claims that Ulrich was to blame for the inaudible bass and unusual drums. Thompson wanted to be relieved of his mixing duties when Ulrich presented his ideas on the production, but Thompson was not allowed to leave and received the majority of the criticism for the poor sound quality of the record. Nonetheless, the album peaked at number 6 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and projected the band to higher success.

Newsted also performed on the self-titled album &quot;Metallica&quot; (1991), which is the best-selling Metallica album to date, as well as on &quot;Load&quot; (1996), &quot;Reload&quot; (1997), and &quot;Garage Inc (1998).&quot; Newsted appeared on the live concert releases &quot;Live Shit: Binge &amp; Purge&quot; (1993), &quot;Cunning Stunts&quot; (1997), and &quot;S&amp;M&quot; (1999), his last studio appearance with Metallica.

During his time in Metallica, Newsted also sang backing vocals or occasional lead vocals on a number of Metallica songs. During tours, beginning in 1989, he would often sing parts of &quot;Creeping Death&quot;, &quot;Whiplash&quot; and &quot;Seek &amp; Destroy&quot;, and he performed lead in most songs for three shows at the Summer Sanitarium Tour where Hetfield was recovering from injury. Newsted was often praised for his live performances with the band by fans for his showmanship and participation throughout his tenure with Metallica.

He has co-written three Metallica songs:
* &quot;Blackened&quot; (&quot;...And Justice for All&quot;) 
* &quot;My Friend of Misery&quot; (&quot;Metallica&quot;) 
* &quot;Where the Wild Things Are&quot; (&quot;ReLoad&quot;) 

He performed his last live show as Metallica&#x27;s bassist on November 30, 2000, at the My VH1 Music Awards.

===Echobrain and departure from Metallica===
During a meeting between the members of Metallica in December 2000, Newsted proposed that the band should take a year-long hiatus, and he would use that time to focus on his side-project Echobrain. When the other band members (specifically James Hetfield) rejected Newsted&#x27;s proposals, he chose to quit the band. On January 17, 2001, as plans were being made for the band to enter the recording studio to record their eighth studio album, Newsted made his departure public, citing &quot;private and personal reasons and the physical damage I have done to myself over the years while playing the music that I love.&quot; During a &quot;Playboy&quot; interview with Metallica, Newsted revealed that he wanted to release an album with Echobrain. Hetfield was against the idea and said, &quot;When someone does a side project, it takes away from the strength of Metallica.&quot; Newsted countered his statement by citing Hetfield&#x27;s contributions to other musical outlets. Hetfield replied, &quot;My name isn&#x27;t on those records, and I&#x27;m not out trying to sell them&quot;, and pondered questions such as &quot;Where would it end? Does he start touring with it? Does he sell shirts? Is it his band?&quot; Newsted&#x27;s departure from Metallica, along with Hetfield&#x27;s decision to go to rehab a few months later, almost led to a breakup of the band. After Hetfield rejoined Metallica, the band finished recording &quot;St. Anger&quot;, with record producer Bob Rock filling the bass slot. Robert Trujillo became the band&#x27;s new bassist in 2003.

Newsted has stated that he has never regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said, &quot;I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It was the right thing to do for the camp. That&#x27;s it. I&#x27;ve never told anyone that I wanted to go back or anything like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. I thought about it very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it&#x27;s supposed to be.&quot; It was mentioned in the film &quot;&quot; that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but to date it has not happened, aside from the brief appearance on the 30th anniversary shows.

Despite his departure from Metallica, Newsted reportedly remains on cordial terms with Ulrich, Trujillo and Hammett. On April 4, 2009, Newsted joined Metallica for its induction into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in Cleveland, Ohio. He also performed three songs at the event—&quot;Master of Puppets&quot;, &quot;Enter Sandman&quot;, and &quot;Train Kept A-Rollin&#x27;&quot;—with Hetfield, Ulrich, Hammett, and Robert Trujillo, and Jeff Beck, Jimmy Page, Joe Perry, Ron Wood, and Flea. On December 5, 7, 9 and 10, 2011, Newsted reunited with Metallica during all four of their 30th anniversary shows and performed several songs with the band and, in some cases, other guest musicians. Hetfield noted how the fans &quot;lit up&quot; as Newsted walked on stage, smiling and waving to the crowd.

On December 16, 2013, Newsted expanded upon previous statements regarding his departure from Metallica and cited that his project with Echobrain was being discouraged by James Hetfield because Metallica&#x27;s management at Q Prime wanted to go ahead with promoting Echobrain but was forced to drop it by Hetfield&#x27;s demands with the quote &quot;other arrangements can be made&quot;. Newsted was sure that Echobrain would not affect Metallica, explaining &quot;And so they had told me, pretty convincingly, &#x27;This is a great record, we&#x27;ve been playing it around the office, that&#x27;s all I&#x27;ve been hearing, it&#x27;s fantastic, this kid has a great voice. Let&#x27;s do something with this.&#x27; That&#x27;s what they told me, and then James Hetfield heard about it and was not happy. He was, I think, pretty much out to put the kibosh on the whole thing because it would somehow affect Metallica in his eyes, because now the managers were interested in something I was doing that had nothing to do with him&quot;. Newsted summed up the situation as follows: &quot;I have no idea what [Hetfield] was thinking, other than just protecting what he valued, just like he does; that&#x27;s his thing. He protects what he loves, squeezes it too hard, like he said himself. Squeeze it too hard, protecting it too much. That&#x27;s where I was coming from. The people that I had counted on for 15 years to help me with my career, help Metallica, take care of my money, do all of those things, told me, &#x27;Your new project is fantastic, we&#x27;d like to help you with it.&#x27; James heard about it, the manager calls me back a couple of days later – &#x27;Sorry we&#x27;re not going to be able to help you with that Echobrain thing&#x27;.&quot;

Ulrich admitted that Newsted&#x27;s departure made a huge dent on Metallica, saying that his presence was overlooked.

Hetfield once revealed that the initial writing sessions without Newsted were unsatisfying and that &quot;the music was not all it could have been.&quot; He also admitted in October 2022 that the song &quot;All Within My Hands&quot; was about Newsted&#x27;s departure, stating that he used it as a means of documenting his internal problems, talking about how “love is control” in the lyrics and crushing everything in his hands to mold Newsted into doing what he was told.

After releasing three studio albums, Newsted left Echobrain in 2004 and the group disbanded a year later.

===Papa Wheelie===

In 1997, Newsted formed Papa Wheelie at his home studio The Chophouse. In 2001, the band consisted of Joe &quot;Joefus&quot; Ledesma and Steven Wiig and recorded the album &quot;Unipsycho&quot; in Walnut Creek, CA. In 2002, Papa Wheelie recorded &quot;Live Lycanthropy&quot; at The Plant in Sausalito, California. After a hiatus, they reconvened to play a series of live shows in late 2011 in the San Francisco Bay Area performing with Anvil and Kyuss Lives. The band recorded a third album in 2011 which included two cover songs by Motorhead and Van Halen. The album is yet to be released.

===Ozzy Osbourne===

Newsted joined Canadian thrash metal band Voivod in 2002. Coincidentally, he was also Trujillo&#x27;s replacement in Osbourne&#x27;s band during &quot;Ozzfest 2003&quot;, which included Voivod as a Second Stage act. During an MTV interview, both Osbourne and Newsted showed enthusiasm in writing an album together, with Osbourne comparing Newsted to &quot;a young Geezer Butler&quot;. However, this would not come to fruition as Newsted left Osbourne upon finishing tour duties in late 2003. He would soon be replaced by Rob Zombie bassist Rob &quot;Blasko&quot; Nicholson.

Focusing on Voivod, Newsted recorded two albums before his participation in Rock Star Supernova, a supergroup created through reality television series &quot;Rock Star: Supernova&quot; in 2006.

===Voivod===

The fourth incarnation of Voivod featured three of the four founding members: Denis Bélanger (vocals), Denis D&#x27;Amour (guitar), and Michel Langevin (drums), with Newsted on bass guitar. D&#x27;Amour died at the age of 45 on August 26, 2005, due to complications from colon cancer. The record &quot;Katorz&quot; (a phonetic spelling of &quot;quatorze&quot;, the French word for fourteen), released in July 2006, was based around riffs found on D&#x27;Amour&#x27;s laptop.

A December 2008 update on Voivod&#x27;s website noted that Newsted played &quot;all the bass tracks&quot; on their latest album &quot;Infini&quot;, which was released on June 23, 2009. Since then, Voivod reunited with their original bass player, Jean-Yves Thériault (Blacky), for a short period of time before he would leave the band permanently.

===Rock Star Supernova===

Supernova formed the basis of the second season of the CBS television program &quot;Rock Star&quot; in the quest to find a lead singer. The show began online on the &quot;Rock Star&quot; website on MSN on Monday, July 3, 2006, with an Internet exclusive weekly episode, and premiered on CBS on that Wednesday, July 5. Votes were cast via the website. On September 13, 2006, Lukas Rossi was crowned the winner.

===Art career===
Thanks to Lars Ulrich&#x27;s interest in collecting art, Newsted became interested in the work of artists such as Jean Fautrier, Pablo Picasso, and Jean-Michel Basquiat. After leaving Metallica, Newsted took up painting as a hobby. He is a proficient artist and has displayed art around the United States.

While recovering from his shoulder injury in 2006, Newsted found solace through painting. Newsted has turned out a number of large original works of art over the last half a decade. Newsted said that he went &quot;from making crazy and colorful music to making crazy and colorful paintings.&quot; His first gallery show opened on May 4, 2010, at Micaëla Gallery in San Francisco.

===Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction===
On April 4, 2009, Newsted was present with his former Metallica bandmates James Hetfield, Lars Ulrich and Kirk Hammett, as well as Ray Burton, the father of late Metallica bassist Cliff Burton. He performed with the band alongside current bassist Robert Trujillo at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony in Cleveland, Ohio.

It was his first performance with the band in nearly a decade, their last performance together having taken place during the VH-1 Awards at the Shrine Auditorium in November 2000. Both Newsted and Trujillo performed onstage at the same time, which was a first for the band.

===WhoCares===
In October 2010 Newsted joined a supergroup with singer Ian Gillan and former keyboardist Jon Lord from Deep Purple, guitarist Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath, second guitarist Mikko Lindström from HIM, and drummer Nicko McBrain from Iron Maiden. The band, called WhoCares, recorded a charity single titled &quot;Out of My Mind&quot;. The charity single also features a track titled &quot;Holy Water&quot; and is available as digital download or CD format as of May 6, 2011.

===Newsted===

In December 2012, Newsted formed his own band called Newsted with drummer Jesus Mendez Jr. and guitarist Jessie Farnsworth, with Staind guitarist Mike Mushok joining later in March 2013. The band released a four-song EP, titled &quot;Metal&quot;, on January 8, 2013.

Newsted released its debut album entitled &quot;Heavy Metal Music&quot; on August 6, 2013. In September 2014, the band appeared inactive as its website contained only a brief message that as of September 15, 2014, Jason Newsted was no longer on any social networking sites. As of 2018, the Newsted official website has been deactivated.

He ceased touring with Newsted due to other musical interests as well as the band being unprofitable. He says &quot;It cost me an awful lot of money – hundreds of thousands of dollars to take the Newsted band around to the 22 countries we played.&quot;

In April 2023, Newsted announced the band had been reactivated and would play their first show in nearly a decade on May 20 at Revolution Live in Fort Lauderdale, Florida.

===Jason Newsted and the Chophouse Band===
In August 2016, after being out of the public eye for two years, Newsted formed a new acoustic group named Jason Newsted and the Chophouse Band, and had scheduled several performing dates throughout the fall.

A fan-made video showed the band (with Newsted on acoustic guitar and lead vocals) playing the Woody Guthrie classic &quot;This Land Is Your Land&quot;.

== Equipment and bass rig ==
In July 2024, Sadowsky announced a Limited Edition Jason Newsted Signature model, his first since the company&#x27;s endorsement in 1997. This special edition includes a total of 13 bass guitars, with eight 4-string models priced at $7,500 and five 5-string models priced at $7,800.

==Personal life==
Newsted was married in 1988 to Judy Talbert but the couple divorced in 1991 during the recordings of the Black Album. He is currently married to his longtime girlfriend Nicole Leigh Smith, whom he wed in October 2012. Nicole, an artist, encouraged him to try painting.

===Shoulder injury===
On October 23, 2006, Newsted was injured while attempting to catch a falling bass amp head (the bass amp head which was used for recording Metallica, Load and Reload). The accident resulted in a torn anterior labrum in his left shoulder and a rotator cuff and biceps tear in the right. He was scheduled for immediate surgery, and underwent a lengthy rehab process. During this time he was unable to play, and began to express himself through painting. On January 4, 2007, he was back playing his bass again.

Newsted later reported that he had been addicted to painkillers, having taken such medication from his time in Metallica to cope with neck problems but without understanding the risks. After his shoulder injury the painkiller use became a problem, but Newsted said he had not used any since about 2010.

<doc id="240612" wikidata="Q126876" url="?curid=240612" title="Saratoga campaign">
<text>The Saratoga campaign in 1777 was an attempt by the British to gain military control of the strategically important Hudson River valley during the American Revolutionary War. It ended in the surrender of a British army, which historian Edmund Morgan argues, &quot;was a great turning point of the war, because it won for Americans the foreign assistance which was the last element needed for victory.&quot;

The primary thrust of the campaign was planned and initiated by Lieutenant General John Burgoyne. Commanding a main force of some 8,000 men, he moved south in June from Quebec, boated south on Lake Champlain to Fort Ticonderoga and from there boated south on Lake George, then marched down the Hudson Valley to Saratoga. He initially skirmished there with the Patriot defenders with mixed results. The turning point of the campaign happened in August at the Battle of Bennington when militia forces from Vermont, New Hampshire, and Massachusetts defeated, killed, and captured around 1,000 Brunswick–Lüneburg and Hessian troops from Burgoyne&#x27;s army. Then, after losses in the Battles of Saratoga in September and October, his deteriorating position and the ever-increasing size of the American army forced him to surrender his forces to the American general Horatio Gates on October 17.

In this critical British loss on the field of battle, the coordinated movements that had been drawn up in far away London did not materialize. Colonel Barry St. Leger had been assigned to move east through the Mohawk River valley on Albany, New York, but was forced to retreat during the siege of Fort Stanwix after losing his Indigenous allies. The major expedition planned from the south was not launched due to miscommunication with London when General William Howe sent his army to take Philadelphia rather than sending it up the Hudson River to link up with Burgoyne. A last-minute effort to reinforce Burgoyne from New York City was made in early October, but it was too little, too late.

The American victory was an enormous morale boost to the fledgling nation. More importantly, it convinced France to enter the war in alliance with the United States, openly providing money, soldiers, and munitions, as well as fighting a naval war worldwide against Britain.

==British strategy==
Toward the end of 1776, it was apparent to many in England that the pacification of New England was very difficult due to the high concentration of Patriots. The British decided to isolate New England and concentrate on the central and southern regions where Loyalists supposedly could be rallied.

In December 1776, General John Burgoyne met with Lord Germain, the British Secretary of State for the Colonies and the government official responsible for managing the war, to set strategy for 1777. There were two main armies in North America to work with: General Guy Carleton&#x27;s army in Quebec and General William Howe&#x27;s army, which had driven George Washington&#x27;s army from New York City in the New York campaign.

===Howe&#x27;s plan to attack Philadelphia===
On November 30, 1776, Howe—the British commander-in-chief in North America—wrote to Germain, outlining an ambitious plan for the 1777 campaign. Howe said that if Germain sent him substantial reinforcements, he could launch multiple offensives, including sending 10,000 men up the Hudson River to take Albany, New York. Then, in the autumn, Howe could move south and capture the U.S. capital of Philadelphia. Howe changed his mind soon after writing this letter: the reinforcements might not arrive, and the retreat of the Continental Army over the winter of 1776–77 made Philadelphia an increasingly vulnerable target. Therefore, Howe decided that he would make the capture of Philadelphia the primary object of the 1777 campaign. Howe sent Germain this revised plan, which Germain received on February 23, 1777.

===Burgoyne&#x27;s plan to capture Albany===
Burgoyne, seeking to command a major force, proposed to isolate New England by an invasion from Quebec into New York. This had already been attempted by General Carleton in 1776, although he had stopped short of a full-scale invasion due to the lateness of the season. Carleton was heavily criticized in London for not taking advantage of the American retreat from Quebec, and he was also intensely disliked by Germain. This, combined with rival Henry Clinton&#x27;s failed attempt to capture Charleston, South Carolina, placed Burgoyne in a good position to get command of the 1777 northern campaign.
Burgoyne presented a written plan to Lord Germain on February 28, 1777; Germain approved it and gave Burgoyne command of the main expedition.

Burgoyne&#x27;s invasion plan from Quebec had two components: he would lead the main force of about 8,000 men south from Montreal along Lake Champlain and the Hudson River Valley while a second column of about 2,000 men (which Barry St. Leger was chosen to lead), would move from Lake Ontario east down the Mohawk River valley in a strategic diversion. Both expeditions would converge upon Albany, where they would link up with troops from Howe&#x27;s army, proceeding up the Hudson. Control of the Lake Champlain–Lake George–Hudson River route from Canada to New York City would cut off New England from the rest of the American colonies.

The last part of Burgoyne&#x27;s proposal, the advance by Howe up the Hudson from New York City, proved to be the most controversial part of the campaign. Germain approved Burgoyne&#x27;s plan after having received Howe&#x27;s letter detailing his proposed offensive against Philadelphia. Whether Germain told Burgoyne, who was still in London at that time, about Howe&#x27;s revised plans is unclear: while some sources claim he did, others state that Burgoyne was not notified of the changes until the campaign was well underway. Historian Robert Ketchum believes that Burgoyne would probably have been aware of the problems that lay ahead had he been notified of the Philadelphia plan.

Whether Germain, Howe, and Burgoyne had the same expectations about the degree to which Howe was supposed to support the invasion from Quebec is also unclear. What is clear is that Germain either left his generals with too much latitude or without a clearly defined overall strategy. In March 1777, Germain had approved of Howe&#x27;s Philadelphia expedition and did not include any express orders for Howe to go to Albany. Yet Germain also sent Howe a copy of his instructions to Carleton, which plainly stated that the northern army was to make a junction with Howe&#x27;s army at Albany. In a letter from Germain to Howe dated May 18, 1777, he made clear that the Philadelphia expedition should &quot;be executed in time for you to co-operate with the army ordered to proceed from Canada and put itself under your command.&quot; This last letter, however, was not received by Howe until after he had departed New York for the Chesapeake. To attack Philadelphia Howe could either have moved overland through New Jersey or by sea via the Delaware Bay, both options would have kept him a position to aid Burgoyne if necessary. The final route he took, through the Chesapeake Bay, was immensely time-consuming and left him wholly unable to assist Burgoyne as Germain had envisioned. The decision was so difficult to understand that Howe&#x27;s more hostile critics accused him of deliberate treachery.

Burgoyne returned to Quebec on May 6, 1777, bearing a letter from Lord Germain which introduced the plan but lacked some details. This produced another of the conflicts of command that plagued the British throughout the war. Lieutenant General Burgoyne technically outranked Major General Carleton, but Carleton was still the governor of Quebec. Germain&#x27;s instructions to Burgoyne and Carleton had specifically limited Carleton&#x27;s role to operations in Quebec. This slight against Carleton, combined with Carleton&#x27;s failure to get command of the expedition, led to his resignation later in 1777, and to his refusal to supply troops from the Quebec regiments to garrison the forts at Crown Point and Ticonderoga after they were captured.

==American strategy==
George Washington, whose army was encamped at Morristown, New Jersey, and the American military command did not have a good picture of British plans for 1777. The principal question on the minds of Washington and his generals Horatio Gates and Philip Schuyler—who both were at turns responsible for the Continental Army&#x27;s Northern Department and its defense of the Hudson River—was of the movements of Howe&#x27;s army in New York. They had no significant knowledge of what was being planned for the British forces in Quebec, in spite of Burgoyne&#x27;s complaints that everyone in Montreal knew what he was planning. The three generals disagreed on what Burgoyne&#x27;s most likely movement was, and Congress also rendered the opinion that Burgoyne&#x27;s army was likely to move to New York by sea.

Partly as a result of this indecision, and the fact that it would be isolated from its supply lines if Howe moved north, the garrisons at Fort Ticonderoga and elsewhere in the Mohawk and Hudson valleys were not significantly increased. Schuyler took the measure in April 1777 of sending a large regiment under Colonel Peter Gansevoort to rehabilitate Fort Stanwix in the upper Mohawk valley as a step in defending against British movements in that area. Washington also ordered four regiments to be held at Peekskill, New York that could be directed either to the north or the south in response to British movements.

American troops were allocated throughout New York theater in June 1777. About 1,500 troops (including those of Colonel Gansevoort) were in outposts along the Mohawk River, about 3,000 troops were in the Hudson River highlands under the command of General Israel Putnam, and Schuyler commanded about 4,000 troops (inclusive of local militia and the troops at Ticonderoga under St. Clair).

==International interest==

Ever since the Seven Years&#x27; War, France&#x27;s foreign ministers, beginning with Choiseul, had followed the idea that the independence of Britain&#x27;s North American colonies would be beneficial for France, and furthermore that French attempts to recover parts of New France would be detrimental to that cause. When war broke out in 1775, the Comte de Vergennes, then the Foreign Minister, outlined a series of proposals that led to secret French and also Spanish support of Congress, and some preparations for the possibility of war, including expansion of their navies. Vergennes did not think open participation in the war was diplomatically or politically feasible until Washington&#x27;s army demonstrated its strength and ability to gain military victories without significant assistance.

To further the aim of French participation in the war, Vergennes closely monitored news from North America and London, and worked to remove impediments to Spanish participation in the war. Vergennes went so far as to propose war to King Louis XVI in August 1776, but news of Howe&#x27;s capture of New York City scuttled that plan.

==Campaign begins==
Most of Burgoyne&#x27;s army had arrived in Quebec in the spring of 1776 and participated in the routing of Continental Army troops from the province. In addition to British regulars, the troops in Quebec included several regiments from the German principalities of Hesse-Cassel, Hesse-Hanau (from whose name the common reference of &quot;Hessian&quot; comes) and Brunswick–Lüneburgers under the command of Baron Friedrich Adolph Riedesel. Of these regular forces, 200 British regulars and 300 to 400 Germans were assigned to St. Leger&#x27;s Mohawk valley expedition, and about 3,500 men remained in Quebec to protect the province. The remaining forces were assigned to Burgoyne for the campaign to Albany. The regular forces were supposed to be augmented by as many as 2,000 militiamen raised in Quebec; by June, Carleton had managed to raise only three small companies. Burgoyne had also expected as many as 1,000 Indians to support the expedition. About 500 joined between Montreal and Crown Point.

Burgoyne&#x27;s army was beset by transport difficulties before it left Quebec, something that apparently neither Burgoyne nor Carleton anticipated. As the expedition expected to travel mainly over water, there were few wagons, horses, and other draft animals available to move a large amount of equipment and supplies on the land portions of the route. Only in early June did Carleton issue orders to procure carts sufficient to move the army. Consequently, the carts were poorly constructed of green wood, and the teams were driven by civilians who were at a higher risk of desertion.

On June 13, 1777, Burgoyne and Carleton reviewed the assembled forces at St. John&#x27;s on the Richelieu River, just north of Lake Champlain, and Burgoyne was ceremonially given command. In addition to five sailing ships built the previous year, a sixth had been built, and three had been captured after the Battle of Valcour Island. These provided some transport as well as military cover for the large fleet of transport boats that moved the army south on the lake.

The army that Burgoyne launched the next day had about 7,000 regulars and over 130 artillery pieces ranging from light mortars to 24-pound (11 kg) pieces. His regulars were organized into an advance force under Brigadier General Simon Fraser, and two divisions. Major General William Phillips led the 3,900 British regulars on the right, while Baron Riedesel&#x27;s 3,100 Brunswick–Lüneburgers held the left. His regular troops started out in good condition, but some, notably some of the German dragoons, were poorly equipped for wilderness fighting.

Colonel St. Leger&#x27;s expedition was also assembled by mid-June. His force, a mixed company of British regulars, Loyalists, Hessians, and rangers from the Indian department, numbering about 750 men left Lachine, near Montreal, on June 23.

==Ticonderoga falls==

Burgoyne&#x27;s army traveled up the lake and occupied the undefended Fort Crown Point by June 30. The screening activities of Burgoyne&#x27;s Indian support were highly effective at keeping the Americans from learning the details of his movements. General Arthur St. Clair, who had been left in command of Fort Ticonderoga and its surrounding defenses with a garrison of about 3,000 regulars and militia, had no idea on July 1 of the full strength of Burgoyne&#x27;s army, large elements of which were then just away. St. Clair had been ordered by General Schuyler to hold out as long as possible, and had planned two avenues of retreat.

Open skirmishing began on the outer defense works of Ticonderoga on July 2. By July 4, most of the American garrison was either at Fort Ticonderoga or nearby Mount Independence, the extensive fortifications on the Vermont side of the lake. Unknown to the Americans, their withdrawal from an outer defensive position cleared a way for the British to place artillery on the hilltop known then as Sugar Loaf (now Mount Defiance), whose heights commanded the fort. St. Clair withdrew the night after spotting British cannon on Sugar Loaf on July 5, and Burgoyne&#x27;s men occupied the main fortification and the positions on Mount Independence on July 6. The uncontested surrender of the supposedly impregnable fort caused a public and political uproar. Although a later investigation cleared both Schuyler and St. Clair of any wrongdoing in the withdrawal, it caused the Continental Congress to replace Schuyler with General Horatio Gates as commander of the Northern Department of the Continental Army in August.

Burgoyne sent forces out from his main body to pursue the retreating army, which St. Clair had sent south via two different routes. The British caught up with elements of the retreating Americans at least three times. General Fraser and elements of Riedesel&#x27;s troops faced determined resistance in Battle of Hubbardton on July 7, and that same day the vanguard of the main army met Pierse Long&#x27;s retreating companies in a skirmish at Skenesboro (now Whitehall). These were followed by another standoff in the Battle of Fort Anne on July 8, in which a forward company of the British army was nearly decimated. These actions cost the Americans about 50% more casualties than those incurred by the British, and they demonstrated to the British officers present that the Americans were capable of putting up stiff resistance. Burgoyne&#x27;s army was reduced by about 1,500 men as a result of the Ticonderoga actions. He left 400 men to garrison the magazine at Crown Point and another 900 to defend Ticonderoga, and the battles that followed resulted in about 200 casualties.

The bulk of St. Clair&#x27;s army retreated through the New Hampshire Grants (present-day Vermont). St. Clair issued appeals to the states for militia support, and also arranged to have as much of the area&#x27;s livestock and supplies delivered to Fort Edward on the Hudson River, where the American armies would regroup. St. Clair reached Fort Edward on July 12 after five days of grueling marches. Some of the remnants that had been scattered at Hubbardton rejoined the army, but Seth Warner and the remains of his regiment were stationed at Manchester in the Grants.

==Reaction and delay==
Burgoyne settled into the house of Loyalist Philip Skene at Skenesboro while the pieces of his army regrouped and he considered his next steps. He penned letters describing the British victory, intended for public consumption. When this news reached the capitals of Europe, King George was happy, and the Comte de Vergennes was not, as the news effectively scuttled an early proposal for French entry into the war. British diplomats increased pressure on the French and Spanish, demanding that they close their ports to American shipping. While this demand was refused, it markedly increased the tensions between the powers. The news was also harshly received by Congress and the American public, including slanders that St. Clair and Schuyler had been bribed.

On July 10, Burgoyne issued orders for the next series of movements. Most of the army was to take the rough road from Skenesboro to Fort Edward via Fort Anne, while the heavy artillery was to be transported down Lake George to Fort William Henry, and then over land to Ft. Edward. Riedesel&#x27;s troops were sent back up the road toward Castleton, primarily as a diversion intended to suggest that he might be aiming for the Connecticut River. Burgoyne&#x27;s decision to move the army overland via Fort Anne was a curious one, for it contradicted his own earlier commentaries on planning the expedition, in which he presciently observed that defenders could easily block the route. His decision appears to have been motivated by two factors; the first being the perception that moving the army over water via Lake George would require a retrograde movement that could be perceived as a retreat, and the second being the influence of Philip Skene, whose property would benefit by the improved road Burgoyne would have to build.

General Schuyler, at Albany when he received word of Ticonderoga&#x27;s fall, immediately rode to Fort Edward, where there was a garrison of about 700 regulars and 1,400 militia. He decided to make Burgoyne&#x27;s passage as difficult as possible, using the axe as a weapon; as it was much easier to fell large trees in the enemy&#x27;s path than to remove them after they were down, this brought Burgoyne&#x27;s advance to a crawl, tiring his troops and forcing them to use up supplies. On July 11 Burgoyne wrote to Lord Germain, complaining that the Americans were systematically felling trees, destroying bridges, and damming streams along the road to Fort Edward. Schuyler also employed scorched earth tactics to deny the British access to local provisions. Despite Burgoyne&#x27;s lack of movement, his scouts were active; some of Schuyler&#x27;s work crews were attacked.

Schuyler&#x27;s tactics required Burgoyne to build a road through the wilderness for his guns and troops, a task that took about two weeks. They moved out of Skenesboro on July 24 and reached Fort Edward on July 29, finding that Schuyler had already abandoned it in a retreat that ended at Stillwater, New York. Before he left Skenesboro, Burgoyne was joined by about 500 Indians (mostly Ottawas, but also Meskwaki, Mississauga, Chippewa, and Ojibwe, as well as members of the Iroquois) from the Great Lakes region under the leadership of St. Luc de la Corne and Charles Michel de Langlade.

==St. Leger&#x27;s expedition==

Lieutenant Colonel St. Leger proceeded up the St. Lawrence by bateaux and crossed Lake Ontario to arrive at Oswego without incident. He had about 240 British regulars, supported by 90 jäger from Hesse-Hanau, 250 Loyalists from the King&#x27;s Royal Regiment of New York, and 50 Canadien militia. They were joined by 100 British Indian Department rangers led by John Butler, and 800 indigenous warriors led by the Iroquois war chiefs Sayenqueraghta, Cornplanter, and Joseph Brant.

Leaving Oswego on July 26, the expedition marched to Fort Stanwix on the Mohawk River, and began besieging it on August 2. About 800 members of the Tryon County militia and their Oneida allies marched to relieve the siege, but a detachment of St. Leger&#x27;s force ambushed them on August 6 at the Battle of Oriskany. After several hours of fighting, St. Leger&#x27;s force abandoned their attack. This left the Americans holding the field of battle, however, they were also forced to withdraw because of the catastrophic casualties they had suffered, including the mortal wounding of their leader, Brigadier General Nicholas Herkimer.

Warriors from the Iroquois nations fought on both sides of the battle, marking the beginning of a civil war within the Six Nations. During the Oriskany action, the besieged Americans staged a sortie from Fort Stanwix and raided the nearly empty indigenous camp. This, combined with the significant casualties they suffered at Oriskany, was a major blow to the morale of St. Leger&#x27;s native allies.

On August 10, Benedict Arnold left Stillwater, New York for Fort Stanwix with 800 men of the Continental Army from Schuyler&#x27;s Northern Department. He expected to recruit members of the Tryon County militia when he arrived at Fort Dayton on August 21. Arnold, however, could only raise about 100 men, as most of the militiamen who had been at Oriskany refused to participate. Arnold instead resorted to subterfuge. He staged the escape of a Loyalist captive, who convinced St. Leger that Arnold was coming with a much larger force than he actually had.

Upon receiving this news, St. Leger&#x27;s indigenous allies withdrew and took most of the remaining supplies with them. St. Leger was forced to abandon the siege and head back through Oswego to Quebec. Arnold sent a detachment to Oneida Lake in pursuit, but turned the rest of his force east to rejoin the American forces at Saratoga. St. Leger&#x27;s eventually arrived with elements of his expedition at Fort Ticonderoga on September 27. Their arrival was too late to effectively support Burgoyne, whose army was already being hemmed in by the growing American forces around him.

==Mounting difficulties==
The advance of Burgoyne&#x27;s army to Fort Edward was, as with the approach to Ticonderoga, preceded by a wave of Indians, which chased away the small contingent of troops left there by Schuyler. These allies became impatient and began indiscriminate raids on frontier families and settlements, which had the effect of increasing rather than reducing local support to the American rebels. In particular, the death at Indian hands of the young Loyalist settler Jane McCrea was widely publicized and served as a catalyst for rebel support, as Burgoyne&#x27;s decision not to punish the perpetrators was seen as unwillingness or inability to keep the Indians under control.
Even though the bulk of his army made the trip from Skenesboro to Fort Edward in just five days, the army&#x27;s lack of adequate transport served to delay the army again, as the supply train, hampered by a lack of draft animals and carts and wagons that were capable of dealing with the rough tracks through the wilderness, took time to follow.

On August 3, messengers from General Howe finally succeeded in making their way through the American lines to Burgoyne&#x27;s camp at Fort Edward. (Numerous attempts by the British generals to communicate were frustrated by the capture and hanging of their messengers by the Americans.) The messengers did not bring good news. On July 17, Howe wrote that he was preparing to depart by sea with his army to capture Philadelphia, and that General Clinton, responsible for New York City&#x27;s defense, would &quot;act as occurrences may direct&quot;. Burgoyne refused to divulge the contents of this dispatch to his staff.

Realizing that he now had a serious supply problem, Burgoyne decided to act on a suggestion that Riedesel had made to him in July. Riedesel, whose forces Burgoyne had stationed at Castleton for a time while he was at Skenesboro, had observed that the area was rich in draft animals and horses, which might be seized for the army&#x27;s benefit (including the mounting of Riedesel&#x27;s currently unmounted dragoons). Pursuing this idea, Burgoyne sent Colonel Friedrich Baum&#x27;s regiment to obtain supplies from the armory in Bennington, Vermont on August 9, along with some Brunswick dragoons. Most of Baum&#x27;s detachment never returned from the August 16 Battle of Bennington, and the reinforcements he had sent after them came back after they were ravaged in the same battle, which deprived Burgoyne of nearly 1,000 men and the much-needed supplies. What Burgoyne had been unaware of was that St. Clair&#x27;s calls for militia support following the withdrawal from Ticonderoga had been answered, and General John Stark had placed 2,000 men at Bennington. Stark&#x27;s force enveloped Baum&#x27;s at Bennington, killing him and capturing much of his detachment.

The death of Jane McCrea and the Battle of Bennington, besides acting as rallying cries for the Americans, had another important effect. Burgoyne blamed his Indian and Canadian allies for McCrea&#x27;s death, and, even after the Indians had lost 80 of their number at Bennington, Burgoyne showed them no gratitude. As a result, Langlade, La Corne, and most of the Indians left the British camp, leaving Burgoyne with fewer than 100 Indian scouts. Burgoyne was left with no protection in the woods against the American rangers. Burgoyne would later blame La Corne for deserting him, while La Corne countered that Burgoyne never respected the Indians. In the British Parliament, Lord Germain sided with La Corne.

==American change of fortune==
While the tactic of delay worked well in the field, the result in the Continental Congress was a different matter. General Horatio Gates was in Philadelphia when Congress discussed its shock at the fall of Ticonderoga, and Gates was more than willing to help assign the blame to reluctant generals. Some in the Congress had already been impatient with General George Washington, wanting a large, direct confrontation that might eliminate occupation forces but which Washington feared would probably lose the war. John Adams, the head of the War Committee, praised Gates and remarked that &quot;we shall never hold a post until we shoot a general.&quot; Over the objections of the New York delegation, Congress sent Gates to take command of the Northern Department on August 10. It also ordered states from Pennsylvania to Massachusetts to call out their militias. On August 19, Gates arrived at Albany to take charge. He was cold and arrogant in manner, and pointedly excluded Schuyler from his first war council. Schuyler left for Philadelphia shortly after, depriving Gates of his intimate knowledge of the area.

Throughout August and continuing into September, militia companies arrived at the Continental Army camps on the Hudson. These were augmented by troops Washington ordered north from the Hudson Highlands as part of General Arnold&#x27;s operation to relieve Stanwix. Those troops arrived at the end of August and included the crack sharpshooters of Daniel Morgan&#x27;s rifle corps, which he sent north from his own army. News of the American successes at Bennington and Fort Stanwix, combined with outrage over the death of Jane McCrea, rallied support, swelling Gates&#x27; army to over 6,000 rank and file. This number did not include Stark&#x27;s small army at Bennington, which was reduced in size by disease and the departure of some of its companies, but was also augmented by several hundred troops raised by General Benjamin Lincoln, who was assigned to make attacks against Burgoyne&#x27;s supply and communications.

==Saratoga==
The &quot;Battle of Saratoga&quot; is often depicted as a single event, but it was actually a month-long series of maneuvers punctuated by two battles. At the beginning of September 1777, Burgoyne&#x27;s army, now just over 7,000 strong, was located on the east bank of the Hudson. He had learned of St. Leger&#x27;s failure at Stanwix on August 28, and even earlier that Howe would not be giving him substantial support from New York City. Faced with the need to reach defensible winter quarters, which would require either retreat back to Ticonderoga or advance to Albany, he decided on the latter. Subsequent to this decision, he made two further crucial decisions. He decided to deliberately cut communications to the north so that he would not need to maintain a chain of heavily fortified outposts between his position and Ticonderoga, and he decided to cross the Hudson River while he was in a relatively strong position. He therefore ordered Riedesel, whose forces were in the rear, to abandon outposts from Skenesboro south, and ordered the army to cross the river just north of Saratoga, (now Schuylerville), which it did between September 13 and 15. Moving cautiously, since the departure of his Indian support had deprived him of reliable scouting, Burgoyne advanced to the south. On September 18 the vanguard of his army had reached a position just north of Saratoga, about from the American defensive line, and skirmishes occurred between the leading elements of the armies.

When Gates took over Schuyler&#x27;s army, much of it was located near the mouth of the Mohawk River, south of Stillwater. On September 8, he ordered the army, then about 10,000 men (of whom about 8,500 were effective combat troops), to Stillwater with the idea of setting up defenses there. The Polish engineer Tadeusz Kościuszko found the area inadequate for proper defensive works, so a new location was found about three miles further north (and about south of Saratoga). At this location Kosciusko laid out defensive lines stretching from the river to the bluffs called Bemis Heights.

The right side of these defenses was nominally given to General Lincoln, but as he was leading troops intended for a diversion against Ticonderoga, Gates assumed command of that portion of the line himself. Gates put General Arnold, with whom he had previously had a good relationship, in command of the army&#x27;s left, the western defenses on Bemis Heights. The relationship between the two soured when Arnold chose to staff his command with friends of Schuyler, whom Gates hated. Combined with the prickly natures of both Gates and Arnold, this eventually brought internal power squabbles to a boil.

===Freeman&#x27;s Farm===
Both Generals Burgoyne and Arnold recognized the importance of the American left flank. Burgoyne recognized that the American position could be flanked and divided his forces, sending a large detachment to the west on September 19. Arnold, also recognizing that a British attack on the left was likely, asked Gates for permission to move his forces out to Freeman&#x27;s Farm to anticipate that maneuver. Gates refused to carry out a general movement since he wanted to wait behind his defenses for the expected frontal attack; but he did permit Arnold to send Daniel Morgan&#x27;s riflemen and some light infantry out for a reconnaissance in force. These forces precipitated the Battle of Freeman&#x27;s Farm when they made contact with Burgoyne&#x27;s right flank. In the ensuing battle, the British gained control of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, but at the cost of 600 casualties, ten percent of their forces.

After the battle, the feud between Gates and Arnold erupted. Not only did Gates not mention Arnold at all in the official account of the battle he sent to Congress, but he also transferred Morgan&#x27;s company (which had been technically independent but operated under Arnold&#x27;s command in the battle) to his direct command. Arnold and Gates had a noisy argument in Gates&#x27; quarters, in which Gates said that General Lincoln would be replacing him. Following the argument, Arnold drafted a letter to Gates outlining his grievances and requesting a transfer to Washington&#x27;s command. Gates gave Arnold a pass to leave and continued to inflict petty indignities on Arnold. A commonly referenced reason why Arnold chose to remain is that a petition signed by all of the line officers except Gates and Lincoln convinced him to stay. While proposals for such a document were considered, there is no contemporary evidence of one actually being drafted and signed.

Burgoyne considered renewing the attack the next day but called it off when Fraser noted that many men were fatigued from the previous day&#x27;s exertions. He therefore dug his army in, and waited for news that he would receive some assistance from the south, as a letter he received from General Clinton in New York on September 21 suggested that a movement up the Hudson would draw off some of Gates&#x27; army. Although he was aware of the persistent desertions that were reducing the size of his army and that the army was running short of food and other critical supplies, he did not know that the American army was also daily growing in size, or that Gates had intelligence on how dire the situation was in his camp.

===Attack on Ticonderoga===
Unknown to either side at Saratoga until after the battle, General Lincoln and Colonel John Brown had staged an attack against the British position at Fort Ticonderoga. Lincoln had collected 2,000 men at Bennington by early September. After marching north to Pawlet, they received word that the guard at Ticonderoga might be susceptible to surprise. Lincoln sent three detachments of 500 men each to &quot;annoy, divide, and distract the enemy.&quot; One went to Skenesboro, which was found to be abandoned by the British. The second went to capture Mount Independence on the east side of Lake Champlain, while the third, led by John Brown, made the approach to Ticonderoga.
On the morning of September 18, Brown surprised the British defenders at the southern end of the portage trail connecting Lake George to Lake Champlain. Rapidly moving up the trail, his men continued to surprise British defenders and capture artillery pieces until they reached the height of land just before Ticonderoga, where they occupied the &quot;old French lines&quot; (so named because it was there that a French defense improbably held against a much larger British army in the 1758 Battle of Carillon). On the way he rescued 100 American prisoners (thus increasing the size of his force) and captured nearly 300 British. His demand for the fort&#x27;s surrender was refused, and Brown&#x27;s men and the fort exchanged cannon fire for the next four days, to little effect. Since he had insufficient manpower to actually assault the fort, Brown then withdrew to Lake George, where he made an unsuccessful attempt to capture a storage depot on an island in the lake.

General Gates wrote to Lincoln on the day of Freeman&#x27;s Farm, ordering his force back to Saratoga and that &quot;not one moment should be lost&quot;. Lincoln reached Bemis Heights on September 22, but the last of his troops did not arrive until the 29th.

===Sir Henry Clinton attempts a diversion===

General Howe, when he left New York for Philadelphia, had put General Sir Henry Clinton in charge of New York&#x27;s defense, with instructions to assist Burgoyne if opportunities arose. Clinton wrote to Burgoyne on September 12 that he would &quot;make a push at [Fort] Montgomery in about ten days&quot; if &quot;you think 2000 men can assist you effectually.&quot; When Burgoyne received the letter, he immediately replied, appealing to Clinton for instruction on whether he should attempt to advance or retreat, based on the likelihood of Clinton&#x27;s arrival at Albany for support. Burgoyne indicated that if he did not receive a response by October 12, he would be forced to retreat.

On October 3, Clinton sailed up the Hudson River with 3,000 men and on October 6, one day after receiving Burgoyne&#x27;s appeal, captured the highland forts named Clinton and Montgomery. Burgoyne never received Clinton&#x27;s dispatches following this victory, as all three messengers were captured. Clinton followed up the victory by dismantling the chain across the Hudson and sending a raiding force up the river that reached as far north as Livingston Manor on October 16 before turning back. General Schuyler found a spot alongside the Hudson River to build a garrison house where the Indians had a few settlements. This housing area resulted in the Indians losing this fishing ground. Word of Clinton&#x27;s movements only reached Gates after the Battle of Bemis Heights.

===Bemis Heights===

In addition to Lincoln&#x27;s 2,000 men, militia units poured into the American camp, swelling the American army to over 15,000 men. Burgoyne, who had put his army on short rations on October 3, called a council the next day. The decision of this meeting was to launch a reconnaissance in force of about 1,700 men toward the American left flank. Burgoyne and Fraser led this detachment out early on the afternoon of October 7. Their movements were spotted, and Gates wanted to order only Daniel Morgan&#x27;s men out in opposition. Arnold said that this was clearly insufficient and that a large force had to be sent. Gates, put off one last time by Arnold&#x27;s tone, dismissed him, saying, &quot;You have no business here.&quot; However, Gates did accede to similar advice given by Lincoln. In addition to sending Morgan&#x27;s company around the British right, he also sent Enoch Poor&#x27;s brigade against Burgoyne&#x27;s left. When Poor&#x27;s men made contact, the Battle of Bemis Heights was underway.

The initial American attack was highly effective, and Burgoyne attempted to order a withdrawal, but his aide was shot down before the order could be broadcast. In intense fighting, the flanks of Burgoyne&#x27;s force were exposed, while the Brunswick–Lüneburgers at the center held against Learned&#x27;s determined attack. General Fraser was mortally wounded in this phase of the battle. While frequently claimed to be the work of Timothy Murphy, one of Morgan&#x27;s men, the story appears to be a 19th-century fabrication. After Fraser&#x27;s fall and the arrival of additional American troops, Burgoyne ordered what was left of the force to retreat behind their entrenched lines.

General Arnold, frustrated by the sound of fighting he was not involved in, rode off from the American headquarters to join the fray. Arnold, who some claimed was in a drunken fury, took the battle to the British position. The right side of the British line consisted of two earthen redoubts that had been erected on Freeman&#x27;s Farm, and were manned by Brunswick–Lüneburgers under Heinrich von Breymann and light infantry under Lord Balcarres. Arnold first rallied troops to attack Balcarres&#x27; redoubt, without success. He then boldly rode through the gap between the two redoubts, a space guarded by a small company of Canadian irregulars. Learned&#x27;s men followed and made an assault on the open rear of Breymann&#x27;s redoubt. Arnold&#x27;s horse was shot out from under him, pinning him and breaking his leg. Breymann was killed in the fierce action, and his position was taken. However, night was falling, and the battle came to an end. The battle was a bloodbath for Burgoyne&#x27;s troops: nearly 900 men were killed, wounded, or captured, compared to about 150 for the Americans.

==Surrender==

Simon Fraser died of his wounds early the next day, and was buried at sunset the following day. Burgoyne ordered the army, whose entrenchments had been subjected to persistent harassment by the Americans, to retreat. One consequence of the skirmishing was that General Lincoln was also wounded. Combined with Arnold&#x27;s wounds, this deprived Gates of his top two field commanders.

Facing heavy rains and probes against the column by the Continental Army, it took the British Army nearly two days to reach Saratoga. Burgoyne was aided by logistical problems in the American camp, where delays in bringing forward and issuing rations hampered the army&#x27;s ability to move forward. Gates ordered detachments to take positions on the east side of the Hudson River to oppose any attempted crossings. By the morning of October 13 Burgoyne&#x27;s army was completely surrounded, so his council voted to open negotiations. Terms were agreed on October 16 that Burgoyne insisted on calling a &quot;convention&quot; rather than a capitulation.

Baroness Riedesel, wife of the commander of the Brunswick–Lüneburg troops, vividly describes in her journal the confusion and besetting starvation of the retreating British army. Her account of the tribulation and death of officers and men, and of the terrified women who had taken shelter in the cellar of what later became known as the Marshall House dramatizes the desperation of the besieged army.

On October 17, Burgoyne&#x27;s army surrendered with full honours of war. Burgoyne gave his sword to Gates, who immediately returned it as a sign of respect. Burgoyne&#x27;s army, about 6,000 strong, marched past to stack arms as the American and British bands played &quot;Yankee Doodle&quot; and &quot;The British Grenadiers&quot;.

==Aftermath==
British troops withdrew from Ticonderoga and Crown Point in November, and Lake Champlain was free of British troops by early December. American troops, on the other hand, still had work to do. Alerted to General Clinton&#x27;s raids on the Hudson, most of the army marched south toward Albany on October 18, while other detachments accompanied the &quot;Convention Army&quot; east. Burgoyne and Riedesel became guests of General Schuyler, who had come north from Albany to witness the surrender. Burgoyne was allowed to return to England on parole in May 1778, where he spent the next two years defending his actions in Parliament and the press. He was eventually exchanged for more than 1,000 American prisoners.

In response to Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender, Congress declared December 18, 1777, as a national day &quot;for solemn Thanksgiving and praise&quot; in recognition of the military success at Saratoga; it was the nation&#x27;s first official observance of a holiday with that name.

===Convention Army===

Under the terms of the convention, Burgoyne&#x27;s army was to march to Boston, where British ships would transport it back to England, on condition that its members not participate in the conflict until they were formally exchanged. Congress demanded that Burgoyne provide a list of troops in the army so that the terms of the agreement concerning future combat could be enforced. When he refused, Congress decided not to honor the terms of the convention, and the army remained in captivity. The army was kept for some time in sparse camps throughout New England. Although individual officers were exchanged, much of the &quot;Convention Army&quot; was eventually marched south to Virginia, where it remained prisoner for several years. Throughout its captivity, a large number of men (more than 1,300 in the first year alone) escaped and effectively deserted, settling in the United States.

==Consequences==

On December 4, 1777, word reached Benjamin Franklin at Versailles that Philadelphia had fallen and that Burgoyne had surrendered. Two days later, King Louis XVI assented to negotiations for an alliance. The treaty was signed on February 6, 1778, and France declared war on Britain one month later, with hostilities beginning with naval skirmishes off Ushant in June. Spain did not enter into the war until 1779, when it entered the war as an ally of France pursuant to the secret Treaty of Aranjuez. Vergennes&#x27; diplomatic moves following the French entry into the war also had material impact on the later entry of the Dutch Republic into the war, and declarations of neutrality on the part of other important geopolitical players like Russia.

The British government of Lord North came under sharp criticism when the news of Burgoyne&#x27;s surrender reached London. Of Lord Germain it was said that &quot;the secretary is incapable of conducting a war&quot;, and Horace Walpole opined (incorrectly, as it turned out) that &quot;we are ... very near the end of the American war.&quot; Lord North issued a proposal for peace terms in Parliament that did not include independence; when these were finally delivered to Congress by the Carlisle Peace Commission they were rejected.

==Remembrances==
Most of the battlefields of the campaign have been preserved in some way, usually as state or national parks, but also as historic sites under state or federal control. Some monuments erected to mark the battles are listed as National Historic Landmarks and some are separately listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Many of the battles are regularly reenacted, and the Battle of Bennington (although it was actually fought in present-day Walloomsac, New York) is marked in the state of Vermont by Bennington Battle Day.

The commemorations of Benedict Arnold&#x27;s contributions to the American success of the campaign are particularly noteworthy. The obelisk at Saratoga National Historical Park has, on three of its four sides, alcoves bearing statues of three generals instrumental in the success at Saratoga: Gates, Schuyler, and Morgan. The fourth alcove, representing Arnold, is empty. The park also contains the Boot Monument which, though again without identifying Arnold by name, clearly honors his contribution in the second Saratoga battle.

<text>A grazing antelope is any of the species of antelope that make up the subfamily Hippotraginae or tribe Hippotragini of the family Bovidae. They&#x27;re grazers rather than browsers. Their name comes from Greek ἵππος (híppos), &quot;horse&quot;, and τράγος (trágos), &quot;he-goat&quot;. They have slightly horse-like characteristics of body size and proportions: long legs and a solid body with a relatively thick muscular neck.

<text>Sea cucumbers are echinoderms from the class Holothuroidea ( ). They are marine animals with a leathery skin and an elongated body containing a single, branched gonad. They are found on the sea floor worldwide. The number of known holothurian ( ) species worldwide is about 1,786, with the greatest number being in the Asia–Pacific region. Many of these are gathered for human consumption, and some species are cultivated in aquaculture systems. The harvested product is variously referred to as &quot;trepang&quot;, &quot;namako&quot;, &quot;&quot;, or &quot;balate&quot;. Sea cucumbers serve a useful role in the marine ecosystem as they help recycle nutrients, breaking down detritus and other organic matter, after which bacteria can continue the decomposition process.

Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers have an endoskeleton just below the skin, calcified structures that are usually reduced to isolated microscopic ossicles (or sclerietes) joined by connective tissue. In some species these can sometimes be enlarged to flattened plates, forming an armour. In pelagic species such as &quot;Pelagothuria natatrix&quot; (order Elasipodida, family Pelagothuriidae), the skeleton is absent and there is no calcareous ring.

Sea cucumbers are named for their resemblance to the fruit of the cucumber plant.

== Overview ==
Most sea cucumbers have a soft and cylindrical body, rounded off and occasionally fat in the extremities, and generally without solid appendages. Their shape ranges from almost spherical for &quot;sea apples&quot; (genus &quot;Pseudocolochirus&quot;) to serpent-like for Apodida or the classic sausage-shape, while others resemble caterpillars. The mouth is surrounded by tentacles, which can be pulled back inside the animal. Holothurians measure generally between long, with extremes of some millimetres for &quot;Rhabdomolgus ruber&quot; and up to more than for &quot;Synapta maculata&quot;. The largest American species, &quot;Holothuria floridana&quot;, which abounds just below low-water mark on the Florida reefs, has a volume of well over , and long. Most possess five rows of tube feet (called &quot;podia&quot;), but Apodida lacks these and moves by crawling; the podia can be of smooth aspect or provided with fleshy appendages (like &quot;Thelenota ananas&quot;). The podia on the dorsal surface generally have no locomotive role, and are transformed into papillae. At one of the extremities opens a rounded mouth, generally surrounded with a crown of tentacles which can be very complex in some species (they are in fact modified podia); the anus is postero-dorsal.

Holothurians do not look like other echinoderms at first glance, because of their tubular body, without visible skeleton nor hard appendixes. Furthermore, the fivefold symmetry, classical for echinoderms, although preserved structurally, is doubled here by a bilateral symmetry which makes them look like chordates. However, a central symmetry is still visible in some species through five &#x27;radii&#x27;, which extend from the mouth to the anus (just like for sea urchins), on which the tube feet are attached. There is thus no &quot;oral&quot; or &quot;aboral&quot; face as for sea stars and other echinoderms, but the animal stands on one of its sides, and this face is called &quot;trivium&quot; (with three rows of tube feet), while the dorsal face is named &quot;bivium&quot;.
A remarkable feature of these animals is the &quot;catch&quot; collagen that forms their body wall. This can be loosened and tightened at will, and if the animal wants to squeeze through a small gap, it can essentially liquefy its body and pour into the space. To keep itself safe in these crevices and cracks, the sea cucumber will hook up all its collagen fibers to make its body firm again.

The most common way to separate the subclasses is by looking at their oral tentacles. Order Apodida have a slender and elongate body lacking tube feet, with up to 25 simple or pinnate oral tentacles. Aspidochirotida are the most common sea cucumbers encountered, with a strong body and 10 to 30 leaflike or shield-like oral tentacles. Dendrochirotida are filter-feeders, with plump bodies and eight to 30 branched oral tentacles (which can be extremely long and complex).

==Anatomy==
Sea cucumbers are typically in length, although the smallest known species are just long, and the largest can reach . The body ranges from almost spherical to worm-like, and lacks the arms found in many other echinoderms, such as starfish. The anterior end of the animal, containing the mouth, corresponds to the oral pole of other echinoderms (which, in most cases, is the underside), while the posterior end, containing the anus, corresponds to the aboral pole. Thus, compared with other echinoderms, sea cucumbers can be said to be lying on their side.
===Body plan===
The body of a holothurian is roughly cylindrical. It is radially symmetrical along its longitudinal axis, and has weak bilateral symmetry transversely with a dorsal and a ventral surface. As in other echinozoans, there are five ambulacra separated by five ambulacral grooves, the interambulacra. The ambulacral grooves bear four rows of tube feet but these are diminished in size or absent in some holothurians, especially on the dorsal surface. The two dorsal ambulacra make up the bivium while the three ventral ones are known as the trivium.

At the anterior end, the mouth is surrounded by a ring of tentacles which are usually retractable into the mouth. These are called the primary tentacles and were present in the common ancestor of echinoderms, but have been lost in all the other classes of the phylum, and may be simple, branched or arborescent. They are known as the introvert and posterior to them there is an internal ring of large calcareous ossicles. Attached to this are five bands of muscle running internally longitudinally along the ambulacra. There are also circular muscles, contraction of which cause the animal to elongate and the introvert to extend. Anterior to the ossicles lie further muscles, contraction of which cause the introvert to retract.

The body wall consists of an epidermis and a dermis and contains smaller calcareous ossicles, the types of which are characteristics which help to identify different species. Inside the body wall is the coelom which is divided by three longitudinal mesenteries which surround and support the internal organs.

===Digestive system===

A pharynx lies behind the mouth and is surrounded by a ring of ten calcareous plates. In most sea cucumbers, this is the only substantial part of the skeleton, and it forms the point of attachment for muscles that can retract the tentacles into the body for safety as for the main muscles of the body wall. Many species possess an oesophagus and stomach, but in some the pharynx opens directly into the intestine. The intestine is typically long and coiled, and loops through the body three times before terminating in a cloacal chamber, or directly as the anus.

===Nervous system===
Sea cucumbers have no true brain. A ring of neural tissue surrounds the oral cavity, and sends nerves to the tentacles and the pharynx. The animal is, however, quite capable of functioning and moving about if the nerve ring is surgically removed, demonstrating that it does not have a central role in nervous coordination. In addition, five major nerves run from the nerve ring down the length of the body beneath each of the ambulacral areas.

Most sea cucumbers have no distinct sensory organs, although there are various nerve endings scattered through the skin, giving the animal a sense of touch and a sensitivity to the presence of light. There are, however, a few exceptions: members of the Apodida order are known to possess statocysts, while some species possess small eye-spots near the bases of their tentacles.

===Respiratory system===
Sea cucumbers extract oxygen from water in a pair of &quot;respiratory trees&quot; that branch in the cloaca just inside the anus, so that they &quot;breathe&quot; by drawing water in through the anus and then expelling it. The trees consist of a series of narrow tubules branching from a common duct, and lie on either side of the digestive tract. Gas exchange occurs across the thin walls of the tubules, to and from the fluid of the main body cavity.

Together with the intestine, the respiratory trees also act as excretory organs, with nitrogenous waste diffusing across the tubule walls in the form of ammonia and phagocytic coelomocytes depositing particulate waste.

===Circulatory systems===
Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers possess both a water vascular system that provides hydraulic pressure to the tentacles and tube feet, allowing them to move, and a &quot;haemal system&quot;. The latter is more complex than that in other echinoderms, and consists of well-developed vessels as well as open sinuses.

A central haemal ring surrounds the pharynx next to the ring canal of the water vascular system, and sends off additional vessels along the radial canals beneath the ambulacral areas. In the larger species, additional vessels run above and below the intestine and are connected by over a hundred small muscular ampullae, acting as miniature hearts to pump blood around the haemal system. Additional vessels surround the respiratory trees, although they contact them only indirectly, via the coelomic fluid.

Indeed, the blood itself is essentially identical with the coelomic fluid that bathes the organs directly, and also fills the water vascular system. Phagocytic coelomocytes, somewhat similar in function to the white blood cells of vertebrates, are formed within the haemal vessels, and travel throughout the body cavity as well as both circulatory systems. An additional form of coelomocyte, not found in other echinoderms, has a flattened discoid shape, and contains hemoglobin. As a result, in many (though not all) species, both the blood and the coelomic fluid are red in colour.

Vanadium has been reported in high concentrations in holothurian blood, however researchers have been unable to reproduce these results.

=== Locomotive organs ===
Like all echinoderms, sea cucumbers possess pentaradial symmetry, with their bodies divided into five nearly identical parts around a central axis. However, because of their posture, they have secondarily evolved a degree of bilateral symmetry. For example, because one side of the body is typically pressed against the substratum, and the other is not, there is usually some difference between the two surfaces (except for Apodida). Like sea urchins, most sea cucumbers have five strip-like ambulacral areas running along the length of the body from the mouth to the anus. The three on the lower surface have numerous tube feet, often with suckers, that allow the animal to crawl along; they are called &quot;trivium&quot;. The two on the upper surface have under-developed or vestigial tube feet, and some species lack tube feet altogether; this face is called &quot;bivium&quot;.

In some species, the ambulacral areas can no longer be distinguished, with tube feet spread over a much wider area of the body. Those of the order Apodida have no tube feet or ambulacral areas at all, and burrow through sediment with muscular contractions of their body similar to that of worms, however five radial lines are generally still obvious along their body.

Even in those sea cucumbers that lack regular tube feet, those that are immediately around the mouth are always present. These are highly modified into retractile tentacles, much larger than the locomotive tube feet. Depending on the species, sea cucumbers have between 10 and 30 such tentacles and these can have a wide variety of shapes depending on the diet of the animal and other conditions.

Many sea cucumbers have papillae, conical fleshy projections of the body wall with sensory tube feet at their apices. These can even evolve into long antennae-like structures, especially on the abyssal genus &quot;Scotoplanes&quot;.

=== Endoskeleton ===
Echinoderms typically possess an internal skeleton composed of plates of calcium carbonate. In most sea cucumbers, however, these have become reduced to microscopic ossicles embedded beneath the skin. A few genera, such as &quot;Sphaerothuria&quot;, retain relatively large plates, giving them a scaly armour.

== Life history and behaviour ==

=== Habitat ===
Sea cucumbers can be found in great numbers on the deep seafloor, where they often make up the majority of the animal biomass. At depths deeper than , sea cucumbers comprise 90% of the total mass of the macrofauna. Sea cucumbers form large herds that move across the bathygraphic features of the ocean, hunting food. The body of some deep water holothurians, such as &quot;Enypniastes eximia&quot;, &quot;Peniagone leander&quot; and &quot;Paelopatides confundens&quot;, is made of a tough gelatinous tissue with unique properties that makes the animals able to control their own buoyancy, making it possible for them to either live on the ocean floor or to actively swim or float over it in order to move to new locations, in a manner similar to how the group Torquaratoridae floats through water.

Holothurians appear to be the echinoderms best adapted to extreme depths, and are still very diversified beyond deep: several species from the family Elpidiidae (&quot;sea pigs&quot;) can be found deeper than , and the record seems to be some species of the genus &quot;Myriotrochus&quot; (in particular &quot;Myriotrochus bruuni&quot;), identified down to deep.
In more shallow waters, sea cucumbers can form dense populations. The strawberry sea cucumber (&quot;Squamocnus brevidentis&quot;) of New Zealand lives on rocky walls around the southern coast of the South Island where populations sometimes reach densities of . For this reason, one such area in Fiordland is called the strawberry fields.

=== Locomotion ===
Some abyssal species in the abyssal order Elasipodida have evolved to a &quot;benthopelagic&quot; behaviour: their body is nearly the same density as the water around them, so they can make long jumps (up to high), before falling slowly back to the ocean floor. Most of them have specific swimming appendages, such as some kind of umbrella (like &quot;Enypniastes&quot;), or a long lobe on top of the body (&quot;Psychropotes&quot;). Only one species is known as a true completely pelagic species, that never comes close to the bottom: &quot;Pelagothuria natatrix&quot;.

=== Diet ===
Holothuroidea are generally scavengers, feeding on debris in the benthic zone of the ocean. Exceptions include some pelagic cucumbers and the species &quot;Rynkatorpa pawsoni&quot;, which has a commensal relationship with deep-sea anglerfish. The diet of most cucumbers consists of plankton and decaying organic matter found in the sea. Some sea cucumbers position themselves in currents and catch food that flows by with their open tentacles. They also sift through the bottom sediments using their tentacles. Other species can dig into bottom silt or sand until they are completely buried. They then extrude their feeding tentacles, ready to withdraw at any hint of danger.

In the South Pacific, sea cucumbers may be found in densities of . These populations can process of sediment per year.

The shape of the tentacles is generally adapted to the diet, and to the size of the particles to be ingested: the filter-feeding species mostly have complex arborescent tentacles, intended to maximize the surface area available for filtering, while the species feeding on the substratum will more often need digitate tentacles to sort out the nutritional material; the detritivore species living on fine sand or mud more often need shorter &quot;peltate&quot; tentacles, shaped like shovels. A single specimen can swallow more than of sediment a year, and their excellent digestive capacities allow them to reject a finer, purer and homogeneous sediment. Therefore, sea cucumbers play a major role in the biological processing of the sea bed (bioturbation, purge, homogenization of the substratum etc.).

=== Communication and sociability ===
=== Reproduction ===

Most sea cucumbers reproduce by releasing sperm and ova into the ocean water. Depending on conditions, one organism can produce thousands of gametes. Sea cucumbers are typically dioecious, with separate male and female individuals, but some species are protandric. The reproductive system consists of a single gonad, consisting of a cluster of tubules emptying into a single duct that opens on the upper surface of the animal, close to the tentacles.

At least 30 species, including the red-chested sea cucumber (&quot;Pseudocnella insolens&quot;), fertilize their eggs internally and then pick up the fertilized zygote with one of their feeding tentacles. The egg is then inserted into a pouch on the adult&#x27;s body, where it develops and eventually hatches from the pouch as a juvenile sea cucumber. A few species are known to brood their young inside the body cavity, giving birth through a small rupture in the body wall close to the anus.

=== Development ===
In all other species, the egg develops into a free-swimming larva, typically after around three days of development. The first stage of larval development is known as an auricularia, and is only around in length. This larva swims by means of a long band of cilia wrapped around its body, and somewhat resembles the bipinnaria larva of starfish. As the larva grows it transforms into the doliolaria, with a barrel-shaped body and three to five separate rings of cilia. The pentacularia is the third larval stage of sea cucumber, where the tentacles appear. The tentacles are usually the first adult features to appear, before the regular tube feet.

=== Symbiosis and commensalism ===

Numerous small animals can live in symbiosis or commensalism with sea cucumbers, as well as some parasites.

Some cleaner shrimps can live on the tegument of holothurians, in particular several species of the genus &quot;Periclimenes&quot; (genus which is specialized in echinoderms), in particular &quot;Periclimenes imperator&quot;.
A variety of fish, most commonly pearl fish, have evolved a commensalistic symbiotic relationship with sea cucumbers in which the pearl fish will live in sea cucumber&#x27;s cloaca using it for protection from predation, a source of food (the nutrients passing in and out of the anus from the water), and to develop into their adult stage of life. Many polychaete worms (family Polynoidae) and crabs (like &quot;Lissocarcinus orbicularis&quot;) have also specialized to use the mouth or the cloacal respiratory trees for protection by living inside the sea cucumber. Nevertheless, holothurians species of the genus &quot;Actinopyga&quot; have anal teeth that prevent visitors from penetrating their anus.

Sea cucumbers can also shelter bivalves as endocommensals, such as &quot;Entovalva sp&quot;.

=== Predators and defensive systems ===
Sea cucumbers are often ignored by most of the marine predators because of the toxins they contain (in particular, holothurin) and because of their often spectacular defensive systems. However, they remain a prey for some highly specialized predators which are not affected by their toxins, such as the big mollusks &quot;Tonna galea&quot; and &quot;Tonna perdix&quot;, which paralyzes them using powerful poison before swallowing them completely.
Some other less specialized and opportunist predators can also prey on sea cucumbers sometimes when they cannot find any better food, such as certain species of fish (triggerfish, pufferfish) and crustaceans (crabs, lobsters, hermit crabs).

Some species of coral-reef sea cucumbers within the order Aspidochirotida can defend themselves by expelling their sticky cuvierian tubules (enlargements of the respiratory tree that float freely in the coelom) to entangle potential predators. When startled, these cucumbers may expel some of them through a tear in the wall of the cloaca in an autotomic process known as evisceration. Replacement tubules grow back in one and a half to five weeks, depending on the species. The release of these tubules can also be accompanied by the discharge of a toxic chemical known as holothurin, which has similar properties to soap. This chemical can kill animals in the vicinity and is one more method by which these sedentary animals can defend themselves.

=== Estivation ===
If the water temperature becomes too high, some species of sea cucumber from temperate seas can aestivate. While they are in this state of dormancy, they stop feeding, their gut atrophies, their metabolism slows down and they lose weight. The body returns to its normal state when conditions improve.

==Phylogeny and classification==



Holothuroidea (sea cucumbers) are one of five extant classes that make up the phylum Echinodermata. This is one of the most distinctive and diverse phyla, ranging from starfish to urchins to sea cucumbers and many other organisms. The echinoderms are mainly distinguished from other phyla by their body plan and organization. The earliest sea cucumbers are known from the middle Ordovician, over 450 million years ago. The apodida is the sister group to the other orders of sea cucumbers.

All echinoderms share three main characteristics. When mature, echinoderms have a pentamerous radial symmetry. While this can easily be seen in a sea star or brittle star, in the sea cucumber it is less distinct and seen in their five primary tentacles. The pentamerous radial symmetry can also be seen in their five ambulacral canals. The ambulacral canals are used in their water vascular system which is another characteristic that binds this phylum together.

The water vascular system develops from their middle coelom or hydrocoel. Echinoderms use this system for many things including movement by pushing water in and out of their podia or &quot;tube feet&quot;. Echinoderms tube feet (including sea cucumbers) can be seen aligned along the side of their axes.

While echinoderms are invertebrates, meaning they do not have a spine, they do all have an endoskeleton that is secreted by the mesenchyme. This endoskeleton is composed of plates called ossicles. They are always internal but may only be covered by a thin epidermal layer like in sea urchin&#x27;s spines. In the sea cucumber, the ossicles are only found in the dermis, making them a very supple organism. For most echinoderms, their ossicles are found in units making up a three dimensional structure. However, in sea cucumbers, the ossicles are found in a two-dimensional network.

All echinoderms also possess anatomical feature(s) called mutable collagenous tissues, or MCTs. Such tissues can rapidly change their passive mechanical properties from soft to stiff under the control of the nervous system and coordinated with muscle activity. Different echinoderm classes use MCTs in different ways. The asteroids, sea stars, can detach limbs for self-defense and then regenerate them. The Crinoidea, sea fans, can go from stiff to limp depending on the current for optimal filter feeding. The Echinoidea, sand dollars, use MCTs to grow and replace their rows of teeth when they need new ones. The Holothuroidea, sea cucumbers, use MCTs to eviscerate their gut as a self-defense response. MCTs can be used in many ways but are all similar at the cellular level and in mechanics of function. A common trend in the uses of MCTs is that they are generally used for self-defense mechanisms and in regeneration.

Holothurian classification is complex and their paleontological phylogeny relies on a limited number of well-preserved specimens. The modern taxonomy is based first of all on the presence or the shape of certain soft parts (podia, lungs, tentacles, peripharingal crown) to determine the main orders, and secondarily on the microscopic examination of ossicles to determine the genus and the species. Contemporary genetic methods have been helpful in clarifying their classification.

==Relation to humans==

=== Food ===
To supply the markets of Southern China, Makassar trepangers traded with the Indigenous Australians of Arnhem Land from at least the 18th century and probably earlier. This is the first recorded example of trade between the inhabitants of the Australian continent and their Asian neighbours.

There are many commercially important species of sea cucumber that are harvested and dried for export for use in Chinese cuisine as &quot;hoisam&quot;. Some of the more commonly found species in markets include:
* &quot;Acaudina molpadioides&quot;
* &quot;Actinopyga echinites&quot;
* &quot;Actinopyga mauritiana&quot;
* &quot;Actinopyga palauensis&quot;
* &quot;Apostichopus californicus&quot;
* &quot;Apostichopus japonicus&quot;
* &quot;Holothuria nobilis&quot;
* &quot;Holothuria scabra&quot;
* &quot;Holothuria fuscogilva&quot;
* &quot;Isostichopus fuscus&quot;
* &quot;Thelenota ananas&quot;

=== Medicine ===
According to the American Cancer Society, although it has been used in traditional Asian folk medicine for a variety of ailments, &quot;there is little reliable scientific evidence to support claims that sea cucumber is effective in treating cancer, arthritis, and other diseases&quot; but research is examining &quot;whether some compounds made by sea cucumbers may be helpful against cancer&quot;.

Various pharmaceutical companies emphasize &quot;gamat&quot;, the Malay traditional medicinal usage of this animal. Extracts are prepared and made into oil, cream or cosmetics. Some products are intended to be taken internally.

A review article found that chondroitin sulfate and related compounds found in sea cucumbers can help in treating joint-pain, and that dried sea cucumber is &quot;medicinally effective in suppressing arthralgia&quot;.

Another study suggested that sea cucumbers contain all the fatty acids necessary to play a potentially active role in tissue repair. Sea cucumbers are under investigation for use in treating ailments including colorectal cancer. Surgical probes made of nanocomposite material based on the sea cucumber have been shown to reduce brain scarring. One study found that a lectin from &quot;Cucumaria echinata&quot; impaired the development of the malaria parasite when produced by transgenic mosquitoes.

==Procurement==
Sea cucumbers are harvested from the environment, both legally and illegally, and are increasingly farmed via aquaculture. The harvested animals are normally dried for resale. In 2016, prices on Alibaba ranged up to .

===Commercial harvest===
In recent years, the sea cucumber industry in Alaska has increased due to increased demand for the skins and muscles to China. Wild sea cucumbers are caught by divers. Wild Alaskan sea cucumbers have higher nutritional value and are larger than farmed Chinese sea cucumbers. Larger size and higher nutritional value has allowed the Alaskan fisheries to continue to compete for market share.

One of Australia&#x27;s oldest fisheries is the collection of sea cucumber, harvested by divers from throughout the Coral Sea in far North Queensland, Torres Straits and Western Australia. In the late 1800s, as many as 400 divers operated from Cook Town, Queensland.

Overfishing of sea cucumbers in the Great Barrier Reef is threatening their population. Their popularity as luxury seafood in East Asian countries poses a serious threat.

===Black market===
As of 2013, a thriving black market was driven by demand in China where at its peak might have sold for the equivalent of and a single sea cucumber for about . A crackdown by governments both in and out of China reduced both prices and consumption, particularly among government officials who had been known to eat (and were able to afford purchasing) the most expensive and rare species. In the Caribbean Sea off the shores of the Yucatán Peninsula near fishing ports such as Dzilam de Bravo, illegal harvesting had devastated the population and resulted in conflict as rival gangs struggled to control the harvest.

===Aquaculture===
Overexploitation of sea cucumber stocks in many parts of the world provided motivation for the development of sea cucumber aquaculture in the early 1980s. The Chinese and Japanese were the first to develop successful hatchery technology on &quot;Apostichopus japonicus&quot;, prized for its high meat content and success in commercial hatcheries. Using techniques pioneered by the Chinese and Japanese, a second species, &quot;Holothuria scabra&quot;, was cultured for the first time in India in 1988. In recent years Australia, Indonesia, New Caledonia, Maldives, Solomon Islands and Vietnam have successfully cultured &quot;H. scabra&quot; using the same technology, and now culture other species.

==Conservation==
In India, the commercial harvest and transportation of sea cucumbers has been strictly banned under Schedule I of the Wild Life (Protection) Act, 1972 (WLPA) since 2001. In 2020, the Indian government created the world&#x27;s first sea cucumber conservation area, the Dr. K.K. Mohammed Koya Sea Cucumber Conservation Reserve, to protect the sea cucumber species.

==In popular culture==

Sea cucumbers have inspired thousands of haiku in Japan, where they are called &quot;namako&quot; (海鼠), written with characters that can be translated as &quot;sea mice&quot; (an example of gikun). In English translations of these haiku, they are usually called &quot;sea slugs&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the English term &quot;sea slug&quot; was originally applied to holothurians during the 18th century. The term is now applied to several groups of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks that have no shell or only a very reduced shell, including the nudibranchs. Almost 1,000 Japanese holothurian haiku translated into English appear in the book &quot;Rise, Ye Sea Slugs!&quot; by Robin D. Gill.

<text>Oswestry ( ; ) is a market town, civil parish and historic railway town in Shropshire, England, close to the Welsh border. It is at the junction of the A5, A483 and A495 roads.

The town was the administrative headquarters of the Borough of Oswestry until that was abolished in 2009. Oswestry is the third-largest town in Shropshire, following Telford and Shrewsbury. At the 2021 Census, the population was 17,509. The town is five miles (8 km) from the Welsh border and has a mixed English and Welsh heritage.

Oswestry is the largest settlement within the Oswestry Uplands, a designated natural area and national character area.

==Toponym==

The name &quot;Oswestry&quot; is first attested in 1191, as . This Middle English name transparently derives from the Old English personal name and the word (&#x27;tree&#x27;). Thus the name seems once to have meant &#x27;tree of a man called Ōswald&#x27;. However, the traditional Welsh name for the town, (first attested in 1254), means &#x27;Oswald&#x27;s cross&#x27;, and &#x27;cross&#x27; is a possible meaning of Old English . Thus the town&#x27;s name may have meant &#x27;Oswald&#x27;s cross&#x27; in both English and Welsh.

The Oswald mentioned is widely imagined to have been Oswald of Northumbria, who died at the Battle of Maserfield in 641/642. The location of the battle is debated among scholars, but for much of the twentieth century was assumed to be at Oswestry. However, A. D. Mills&#x27;s &quot;Dictionary of English Place Names&quot; concluded that &#x27;the traditional connection with St Oswald, 7th-century king of Northumbria, is uncertain&#x27;.

The name and the association with King Oswald have attracted more fanciful interpretations. According to legend, one of the dismembered Oswald&#x27;s arms was carried to an ash tree by a raven. Miracles were subsequently attributed to the tree, and the legend has it that this was &quot;Oswald&#x27;s Tree&quot;, and gave its name to the town. A spring called &#x27;Oswald&#x27;s Well&#x27; is supposed to have originated where the bird dropped the arm from the tree, though one historian has suggested that it was likely to have had sacred associations long before Oswald&#x27;s time. The water from the well was believed to have healing properties, particularly for curing eye trouble. Offa&#x27;s Dyke runs near the well, to the west. This interpretation is supported by a passage in &quot;Fouke le Fitz Waryn&quot; (13th century romance) which states that was derived from (Oswald&#x27;s tree), which in turn was changed from () which belonged to a Briton called Meredus Fitz Beledyns ().

There is an alternative view that Oswestry was named after Oswy, Oswald&#x27;s brother, who fought a battle here against King Penda in 655 AD. Oswy became King of Northumbria after Oswald&#x27;s death in 642 AD. The battle of 655 AD was fought near to a river called the Winwead, which it is believed, was the nearby River Vyrnwy. Welsh folklore has it that this battle was called the battle of and in it their leader was also killed.

== History ==

=== Prehistory ===
The earliest known human settlement in Oswestry is Old Oswestry, one of the best-preserved Iron Age hill forts in Britain, with evidence of construction and occupation between 800BC and 43AD. The site is known in Welsh as &quot;Caer Ogyrfan&quot;, meaning &#x27;City of Gogyrfan&#x27;, referring to the father of Guinevere in Arthurian legend.

=== Saxon times ===
The Battle of Maserfield is widely thought to have been fought at Oswestry in 641 or 642, between the Anglo-Saxon kings Penda of Mercia and Oswald of Northumbria. However, the location of the battle is debated among scholars.

=== The Conquest ===
The Domesday Book (1086) records the castle being built by Rainald, a Norman Sheriff of Shropshire: .

Alan fitz Flaad (died c.1120), a Breton knight, was granted the feudal barony of Oswestry by King Henry I who, soon after his accession, invited Alan to England with other Breton friends, and gave him forfeited lands in Norfolk and Shropshire, including some which had previously belonged to Ernulf de Hesdin (killed at Antioch while on crusade) and Robert of Bellême.

Alan&#x27;s duties to the Crown included supervision of the Welsh border. He also founded Sporle Priory in Norfolk. He married Ada or Adeline, daughter of Ernulf de Hesdin. Their eldest son William FitzAlan was made High Sheriff of Shropshire by King Stephen in 1137. He married a niece of Robert of Gloucester. Alan&#x27;s younger son, Walter, travelled to Scotland in the train of King David I, Walter becoming the first hereditary Steward of Scotland and ancestor of the Stewart Royal family.

=== Border town ===
The town changed hands between the English and the Welsh a number of times during the Middle Ages and still retains some Welsh-language street and place names. In 1972, ITV broadcast a television report asking residents if they thought the town should be English or Welsh, with mixed responses.

In 1149 the castle was captured by Madog ap Maredudd during &#x27;The Anarchy&#x27;, and it remained in Welsh hands until 1157. Occasionally in the 13th century it is referred to in official records as &quot;Blancmuster&quot; (1233) or &quot;Blancmostre&quot; (1272), meaning &quot;White Minster&quot;. Later, Oswestry was attacked by the forces of Welsh rebel leader Owain Glyndŵr during the early years of his rebellion against the English King Henry IV in 1400; it became known as &quot;Pentrepoeth&quot; or &quot;hot village&quot; as it was burned and nearly totally destroyed by the Welsh. The castle was reduced to a pile of rocks during the English Civil War.

The town is now the home of the Shropshire libraries&#x27; Welsh Collection.

=== Market town ===

In 1190 the town was granted the right to hold a market each Wednesday. The town built walls for protection, but these were torn down in the English Civil War by the Parliamentarians after they took the town from the Royalists after a brief siege on 22 June 1644, leaving only the Newgate Pillar visible today.

After the foot and mouth outbreak in the late 1960s the animal market was moved out of the town centre. In the 1990s, a statue of a shepherd and sheep was installed in the market square as a memorial to the history of the market site.

=== Military ===
Park Hall, a mile east of the town, was taken over by the Army during World War I in 1915 and used as a training camp and military hospital. On 26 December 1918 it burnt to the ground following an electrical fault. The ruined hall and camp remained derelict between the wars, the camp hospital, however, was still in use; the Baschurch Convalescent and Surgical Home moved there in February 1921 and it became known as the Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital.

One of the main uses of the land from the 1920s was for motorcycle racing and it became quite a well-known circuit.

The camp was reactivated in July 1939 for Royal Artillery training and the Plotting Officers&#x27; School. Following World War II, Oswestry was a prominent military centre for Canadian troops, then for the British Royal Artillery, and finally a training centre for 15 to 17-year-old Infantry Junior Leaders. The camp closed in 1975. During the 1970s some local licensed wildfowlers discharged their shotguns at some passing ducks and were shot themselves by a young military guard, who had mistaken them for an attacking IRA force.

The area previously occupied by the Park Hall military camp is now mainly residential and agricultural land, with a small number of light industrial units. Park Hall Farm became a visitor attraction in 1998, it is home to the Museum of the Welsh Guards. The Park Hall Football Stadium (home of The New Saints FC) and The Venue is now closed.

== Landmarks ==
Old Oswestry, on the northern edge of the town, dominates the northern and eastern approaches. The 3,000-year-old settlement is one of the most spectacular and best preserved Iron Age hill forts in Britain, with evidence of construction and occupation between 800 BC and AD 43.

Other attractions in and around Oswestry include: Park, Shelf Bank, Wilfred Owen Green, Saint Oswald&#x27;s Well at Maserfield, Oswestry Castle, and the Cambrian Railway Museum located near the former railway station. Oswestry Guildhall, the meeting place of Oswestry Town Council, was completed in 1893.

A story incorporating the names of all of the many pubs once open in Oswestry can be found hanging on a wall inside The Oak Inn on Church Street. There is a tapestry of forty Oswestry pub signs on display in Oswestry Guildhall on the Bailey Head. The Stonehouse Brewery opened in 2007, on the site of the former Weston Wharf railway station at Weston, in nearby Oswestry Rural; Stonehouse Brewery supplies many of the pubs with real ale.

Brogyntyn Hall, which belonged to the Lords Harlech, lies just outside the town. Brogyntyn Park is five and a half acres of parkland occupying the southern slope of the Grade II listed Brogyntyn Estate. It was gifted to Oswestry Town Council by the fourth Lord Harlech, William Ormsby-Gore, in 1952.

There are a number of places of worship in Oswestry.

Oswestry is divided into two Church of England parishes, which are part of the Diocese of Lichfield: Holy Trinity, which encompasses Oswestry East and eastern part of Oswestry Rural; and St. Oswald, which encompasses Oswestry South, Oswestry West and the western part of Oswestry Rural. Each parish has its own parish church.

St Oswald&#x27;s Church was first mentioned in the 1086 Domesday book and a tithe document in Shrewsbury the same year. St Oswald&#x27;s Church is Grade II* listed, having a tower dating from late 12th or early 13th century and later additions particularly in the 17th and 19th centuries. There is a new window in the east nave, designed by stained glass artist Jane Gray in 2004.

In June 2022, it was announced that, from January 2023, oversight of traditional Catholics within the Anglican Church in the west of Province of Canterbury (formerly the Bishop of Ebbsfleet&#x27;s area) would be taken by a new Bishop of Oswestry, suffragan to the Bishop of Lichfield. The Bishop of Oswestry serves the western 13 dioceses of the southern province (Bath and Wells, Birmingham, Bristol, Coventry, Derby, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Lichfield, Oxford, Salisbury, Truro, and Worcester).

The town of Oswestry and surrounding villages fall into the parish of Our Lady Help of Christians and St Oswald, in the Roman Catholic Diocese of Shrewsbury. The single Catholic church is Our Lady and St Oswald&#x27;s Catholic Church. There is an associated primary school.

There are two Methodist churches: the Horeb Church on Victoria Road and the Oswestry Methodist Church. Cornerstone Baptist Church is on the corner of Lower Brook Street and Roft Street in a modern 1970s building. Other Nonconformist churches include the Albert Road Evangelical Church, Hope Church, formerly , founded in 1964, and the Cabin Lane Church, established by members of the Hope Church in 1991 following the eastern expansion of Oswestry.
Christ Church was opened by the Congregational Church in October 1972, but now shared by the United Reformed Church and the Presbyterian Church of Wales, was the home church of the composer Walford Davies, who sang in the choir. There is a Welsh-speaking church, the Church, and the Holy Anglican Church, a Western Rite Anglican establishment. Coney Green has a Jehovah&#x27;s Witness Kingdom Hall. The Religious Society of Friends also holds meetings in Oswestry. The Grade II* star Hermon Chapel, by chapel architect Thomas Thomas, was a Welsh-speaking Congregational church and is now an arts and community centre.

A small Muslim community exists in the town. A plan to transform a 19th-century former Presbyterian church on Oswald Road into a permanent base for meetings and prayer services fell through in March 2013 due to cost. New plans were submitted to Shropshire Council for approval in 2019, to convert the former Salvation Army citadel in King Street into an Islamic Prayer Centre. These plans were eventually approved by Shropshire Council.

There is a small Orthodox Christian community in Oswestry, which has increased in size over years due to the town&#x27;s growing Bulgarian community. There is no Orthodox church in Oswestry, however, so congregants have to travel to the Greek Orthodox Community of the Holy Fathers of Nicaea, Shrewsbury, to worship. There used to be an Orthodox outreach at Holy Trinity Church for a few years, but a disagreement over the church layout brought this service to an end. Congregants also used to benefit from a Greek Orthodox priest at Weston Rhyn, who left the area in the 1990s.

There is a very small Liberal Jewish community within Oswestry, who are served by the Welshpool Jewish Group, over 15 miles away. Oswestry&#x27;s Jewish history is little known, but has had Jewish businesses and families since at least the 1850s. Located within Oswestry Cemetery is the grave of a child Holocaust refugee.

== Healthcare ==
The Robert Jones and Agnes Hunt Orthopaedic Hospital NHS Trust in Oswestry provides elective orthopaedic surgery and musculoskeletal medical services. The hospital is located towards Gobowen.

The hospital is now home to the UK&#x27;s first orthopaedic outpatient centre for British Armed Forces veterans following a fund-raising appeal by the RJAH League of Friends in 2018.

There is a Health Centre on Thomas Savin Road, next to Shelf Bank and opposite the bus station. Within the Health Centre is the Oswestry Minor Injuries Unit, Cambrian Medical Centre and a range of services run by Shropshire Community Health NHS Trust. There are three other GP surgeries situated within the town, and numerous opticians, pharmacists and dentists.

== Education ==
Oswestry is home to the second oldest &#x27;free&#x27; (which in this context means not linked to any ecclesiastical foundation) school in the country, Oswestry School, which was founded in 1407. (The oldest, Winchester College, was founded in 1382.) Oswestry School&#x27;s 15th century site, adjacent to St Oswald&#x27;s Parish Church, is now a café restaurant. It used to house the Tourist Information Centre, now moved to Castle view.

There are four state primary schools in Oswestry: The Meadows Primary School, Cabin Lane; Woodside Primary School, Gittin Street; Holy Trinity C.E. Primary Academy &amp; Nursery, Beech Grove and Middleton Road; and Our Lady &amp; St. Oswald&#x27;s Catholic Primary School, Upper Brook Street. There is also an independent co-educational preparatory school in Church Street, Bellan House, which is run by Oswestry School.

Secondary education is provided by both Oswestry School and the state secondary school with academy status: The Marches School, Morda Road.

Further education is provided by The Marches School&#x27;s Sixth Form and the North Shropshire College which is situated in the town at Shrewsbury Road and at the Walford Campus near Baschurch.

== Local media ==
Regional TV news is provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals can be received from either The Wrekin or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire on 96.0 FM, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 103.1 FM and Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire on 107.1 FM.

The Border Counties Advertizer and Shropshire Star are the town&#x27;s local newspapers, the former printed weekly and the latter printed daily. The Oswestry Life Magazine is the town&#x27;s monthly magazine publication. 

== Transport ==

Oswestry is at the junction of the A5 with the A483 and A495. The A5 continues from Shrewsbury to the north, passing the town, before turning west near Chirk and entering Wales.

Bus services are operated by Arriva Midlands, Arriva Wales and local independents Tanat Valley Coaches, Lakeside Coaches and Owen&#x27;s Travelmaster. The town has regular bus routes that link nearby villages and towns including Wrexham, Welshpool, Newtown, Llanfyllin, Ellesmere and Shrewsbury. There is also a Dial-A-Ride minibus service which operates Mon-Fri and a direct bus route between Oswestry and Lake Vyrnwy every Wednesday, both operated by Oswestry Community Action, trading as the Qube.

On 9 November 2023, Oswestry was awarded Coach Friendly accreditation by the Conference for Passenger Transport (CPT) at a ceremony in the Guildhall on Bailey Head. The award followed an initiative by Oswestry Business Improvement District (BID) to increase the frequency and regularity of coach visits to boost the footfall and income of local shops, cafes, businesses and organisations.

Gobowen railway station is 2 miles from the northern edge of Oswestry. It has direct services to Birmingham, Cardiff, Chester and North Wales.
The original station name board &#x27;Gobowen for Oswestry&#x27; is permanently displayed on the station platform.

=== Canals ===
The Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal runs from Ellesmere to Llangollen, running east of the town at Hindford and on through Chirk, north. A navigable section of the partially restored Montgomery Canal, runs from Frankton Junction (connecting to the Llangollen Branch of the Shropshire Union Canal) to Newtown.

=== Historic railways ===

The railway station, once on the main line of the Cambrian Railways, was closed in 1966 as a consequence of the Beeching cuts. Opened in 1840, the section from Whitchurch to Welshpool (Buttington Junction), via Ellesmere, Whittington, Oswestry and Llanymynech, closed on 18 January 1965, leaving only a short branch line from to continue to serve Oswestry – but only until 7 November 1966. This former Great Western Railway (GWR) branch had once run into a separate GWR Oswestry terminus, but this has long since disappeared and the land redeveloped as a bus station and supermarket. Trains were re-routed into the main Cambrian station from 7 July 1924.

The main building of the Cambrian station is still a prominent landmark in the town centre: it once housed the headquarters of the Cambrian Railways company. After restoration, this building was reopened as the Cambrian Visitor Centre in June 2006 but closed on 11 January 2008. It later reopened, and has since evolved into the headquarters of the Cambrian Heritage Railways (CHR) and a small catering establishment known as &quot;Buffers&quot;; other parts of the building have been converted into retail and office units to contribute to the upkeep of the building.

A single railway track still runs through the station, once overgrown and rusting, it has been cleared and repaired and is the subject of an ambitious plan to reopen the line as a steam heritage railway between Oswestry and Llanyblodwel and Pant (to link with the restored Montgomery Canal – see above), and as a sustainable community transport rail link from Oswestry to the National Rail railway station at Gobowen.

By 2013, the main &quot;up&quot; platform at Oswestry station had been reconstructed and some new semaphore signalling installed. The branch-line track-bed from south of Gobowen to Llanyblodwel is now owned by Shropshire Council, who lease the land to CHR, a registered charity. Work is advancing in securing the transfer of the existing Transport &amp; Works Act Order (TWAO) from Network Rail to CHR. The aim was for this transfer to be completed by 2014, and for the railway line between Gobowen and Oswestry to be fully re-instated and operational by 2017; however the legal process of the TWAO Unit administering a form of written debate between the proposer and objectors with a guided number of exchanges, was still ongoing in mid 2016. CHR purchase of the final section of the Oswestry to Gobowen railway branch line was completed in April 2016; nevertheless, other hurdles to becoming operational, such as permissions and finances to reinstate the level crossings on the main A5/A483 Trunk Roads, will also need to be overcome.

Immediately to the south of Oswestry Railway Station is the Cambrian Railways Museum; while a short distance to the north are the &quot;listed&quot; Works Bridge and the former Cambrian Railways works, which are now occupied by a variety of local commerce concerns and Oswestry&#x27;s Community Health Centre and ambulance facility.

== Sport ==

From 2013, the town was represented in football by F.C. Oswestry Town, who were members of the North West Counties Football League Division One South, until folding in July 2020, citing Covid 19 as the reason The former local football club, Oswestry Town F.C., was one of the few English teams to compete in the League of Wales. It also won the Welsh Cup in 1884, 1901 and 1907. The club was in financial difficulties in 2003 and merged with Total Network Solutions F.C. of Llansantffraid, a village eight miles (13 km) away on the Welsh side of the border. Following the takeover of the club&#x27;s sponsor in 2006, the club was renamed as The New Saints. They moved to the redeveloped Park Hall Stadium on the outskirts of the town in September 2007. The New Saints or TNS is a full-time-professional football club that play in the Welsh Premier League, which they have won a record twelve times.

Oswestry Lions F.C. of the Shropshire County League also play at the ground.

== Recreation and leisure ==
From the 1700s to 1848, there was a popular racecourse outside the town. Known as , the site was chosen on this high hilltop because of its location between the Kingdom of England and the Principality of Wales, and the aim was to bring together the local landowners and gentry of Wales and England. Remnants of the old grandstand and figure-of-eight racetrack can still be seen.

Nowadays, Oswestry Race Course is common land, registered under the Commons Act 1899 and the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, with a number of rights of way on the South Common including Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path and Bridleway. Also designated as a publicly accessible open space and a Wildlife Site in the 1999 Local Plan, it is an area reserved for:

::quiet, informal leisure activities and recreation;
::the biological diversity of the matrix of heathland, sparse woodland, ponds and ditches; and
::the sustainable management and conservation of nature and wildlife.

The site provides extensive views across the surrounding landscape of England and Wales.

The to Chirk Mill section of the Offa&#x27;s Dyke Path National Trail crosses the common.

<text>&quot;&quot; (), often translated as &quot;The Patriotic Song&quot;, is the national anthem of South Korea. It was adopted in 1948, the year the country&#x27;s government was founded. Its music was composed in the 1930s and arranged most recently in 2018; its lyrics date back to the 1890s. The lyrics of &quot;Aegukga&quot; were originally set to the music of the Scottish song &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; before Ahn Eak-tai composed a unique melody specifically for it in 1936. Before the founding of South Korea, the version set to the music of &quot;Auld Lang Syne&quot; was sung, as well as when Korea was under Japanese rule by dissidents. The version set to the melody composed by Ahn Eak-tai was adopted as the national anthem of the Korean exile government, which existed during Korea&#x27;s occupation by Japan from the early 1910s to the mid-1940s.

&quot;Aegukga&quot; has four verses, but on most occasions only the first one, followed by the chorus, is sung when performed publicly at events such as baseball games and soccer matches.

==Etymology==
 literally means &quot;patriotic song&quot;. The &quot;Encyclopedia of Korean Culture&quot; defines &quot;Aegukga&quot; as &quot;the song to wake up the mind to love the country&quot;. &quot;Aegukga&quot; in itself is differentiated from a national anthem. While a national anthem or () is an official symbol of the state, refers to any song, official or unofficial, that contains patriotic fervor towards its country, such as Hungary&#x27;s &quot;Szózat&quot; or the U.S. &quot;The Stars and Stripes Forever&quot;. However, the nationally designated &quot;Aegukga&quot; plays the role of symbolizing the country. In general shorthand, the term &quot;aegukga&quot; refers to the national anthem of South Korea. Nevertheless, there are still more than ten other extant &quot;Aegukgas&quot; in South Korea.

==History==
===Origins===
The music to &quot;Aegukga&quot; was composed in 1936 by An Ik-tae (1906–1965). It was customarily called the &quot;national anthem&quot; until it was officially established as the national anthem of South Korea after the government&#x27;s foundation on August 15, 1948.

There are theories that the lyrics were written by Yoon Chi-ho, Ahn Chang-ho, or Min Young-hwan, but none of these have been officially confirmed. It was not officially designated or adopted as the national anthem by the government, but it came to be customarily called the national anthem and eventually became the song symbolizing the Republic of Korea. Composer Ahn Ik-tae first encountered the lyrics of &quot;Aegukga&quot; during the March 1st Movement in 1919. Feeling regretful that &quot;Aegukga&quot; was being sung to the tune of the Scottish folk song &quot;Auld Lang Syne,&quot; also known as &quot;The Song of Farewell,&quot; he decided that he, as a Korean, should compose its melody himself and composed &quot;Aegukga&quot; in 1935.

Before the current Aegukga, the first national anthem was created during the Korean Empire era. After the Gabo Reform of 1894 and the establishment of the Independence association in 1896, many anthems to inspire patriotism were written in the private sector, numbering about ten. Although it is unclear which melodies were used, the lyrics began to be published in the Independence Newspaper. During this time, the Korean Empire’s national anthem was officially proclaimed, marking the first time a national anthem was formally established by the state.

After the proclamation of the Korean Empire, Emperor Gojong felt the need for a national anthem as a state symbol and announced the establishment of a military band by law in December 1900. He invited German musician Franz von Eckert (1852–1916). Eckert, who had served as the bandmaster of the German Navy, was invited to Japan in 1879, where he worked with the Japanese Navy and contributed to the spread of Western music. After 23 years in Japan, he returned to Germany in March 1900 and was recommended by the German Legation in Korea to come to Korea on February 7, 1901, bringing various instruments for a 50-member military band. Following Emperor Gojong&#x27;s command, he completed the Korean Empire’s national anthem on July 1, 1902, based on traditional Korean musical scales, and it was proclaimed as the national anthem on August 15, 1902. Eckert was awarded the Taeguk Order of Merit, 3rd Class, for his contribution to composing the anthem.

The sheet music for the Korean Empire&#x27;s national anthem was proclaimed and sent to over fifty countries worldwide. However, with the annexation of Korea by Japan in 1910, Japan&#x27;s &quot;Kimigayo&quot; became the official anthem, and the Korean anthem was banned. After Korea&#x27;s liberation, the national anthem was no longer adopted as the official national anthem because of his participation in Japan&#x27;s &quot;Kimigayo&quot; composition.

Although the past Korean Empire&#x27;s national anthem remained behind the scenes of history due to the circumstances of the times, it holds the status of being the first Western music composed in Korea and the first national anthem.

In 2018, music director, Park In-young, recomposed Aegukga, and added brass and woodwind instruments to the arrangement. She said, “while trying not to change Ahn’s original version, we gave it a more modern spin.”

All sporting events such as pro baseball games start with the song.

===Copyright===
Since the composer Ahn Eak-tai died in 1965, the copyright for the music was to not expire until at least 2036. Two South Korean professional football clubs were sued by a copyright holders&#x27; group for playing this song in December 2003. However, on March 16, 2005, the composer&#x27;s widow—Lolita Ahn—and her family relinquished all rights to &quot;Aegukga&quot; to the South Korean government. &quot;Aegukga&quot; has since become a public domain song.

<text>Ruth Metzler (born Arnold, 23 May 1964) is a Swiss politician who served as a Member of the Swiss Federal Council from 1999 to 2003. A member of the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party (CVP/PDC), she headed the Federal Department of Justice and Police.

==Biography==
===Political career===
Educated at the University of Fribourg, Metzler served as the cantonal executive in charge of finance in Appenzell Innerrhoden from 1996 to 1999.

She was elected to the Swiss Federal Council on 11 March 1999, as a member of the Christian Democratic People&#x27;s Party. Metzler took office at the Federal Department of Justice and Police the following 1 May, succeeding Arnold Koller; she won 14 referendums during her time in office. On 1 January 2003, she assumed the vice presidency of the Swiss Confederation.

On 10 December 2003, she became the third Federal Councillor not to be reelected in the history of the Swiss Federal State. In the 2003 Federal Assembly election, her party lost many voters and the Swiss People&#x27;s Party (SVP/UDC) became the largest party of Switzerland. The Swiss People&#x27;s Party then requested another seat in the Federal Council. In the elections for the Federal Council on 10 December, the Federal Assembly did not reelect Metzler and elected Christoph Blocher instead, by 121 votes to 116 on the third round of voting. She challenged her CVP colleague Joseph Deiss for his seat, but lost by 138 to 96. Metzler kept her seat until the end of the year and Christoph Blocher succeeded her on 1 January 2004.

===After politics===
She published the memories of those years under the title &quot;Grissini &amp; Alpenbitter&quot;, 2004, . She taught between February and July 2004 at the University of St. Gallen a class called &quot;Gestaltungsmöglichkeiten in der Politik&quot; which can be translated as &quot;scope for design in politics&quot;. Since April 2005 she has been working for the Swiss pharmaceutical company Novartis.

<text>Old Oswestry () is a large early Iron Age hill fort in the Welsh Marches near Oswestry in north west Shropshire, England. The earthworks, which remain one of the best preserved hill forts in the UK, have been described as &quot;The Stonehenge of the Iron Age Period&quot;. After the hill fort was abandoned, it was incorporated into Wat&#x27;s Dyke by the Mercians during the Early Medieval period.

The hill fort was designated as a scheduled monument in 1934. The site is now managed by English Heritage. The accessible hill fort, at ordnance datum, gives panoramic views across North and Mid Wales, Cheshire and Shropshire.

== History ==
The earliest occupation of the site began in the 8th century BC and continued up until the Roman conquest of Britain. Its inhabitants were either from the tribes of the Cornovii or Ordovices.

The complexity of defences suggests there have been several phases of development. In the earliest period, a few round huts were sited on the undefended hillock. Subsequently these were enclosed by a double bank and ditch that enclosed . Entrances were placed at the east and west ends of the earthworks where the inner bank was pulled inwards to create large gateways. Later a third bank was added on all sides except the south east where the hill&#x27;s steep incline made it unnecessary.

The western entrance was re-modeled with unusual rectangular hollows separated by ridges dug out and defended by outworks. The eastern entrance was also strengthened with two further external circuits of banks and ditches. Despite the size of its fortifications, there is no evidence that the Roman Legions attacked Old Oswestry during their conquest of the region in the 50 CEs.

In the Early Medieval period, it became associated as the birthplace of the ancient Brythonic queen Guinevere of Arthurian legend.

During the First World War, units of the Canadian Expeditionary Force stationed at nearby Park Hall camp used the earthworks for training purposes. Many large pits, trenches and craters from explosives irreparably damaged the interior site during these military activities. The war poet Wilfred Owen, who was born in Oswestry, completed his trench warfare training at the hill fort when he was stationed at Park Hall.

==Preservation==
In 1934, Old Oswestry was listed as a scheduled monument, along with two adjacent sections of Wat&#x27;s Dyke.

In 1939–40, geologist and amateur archaeologist William J. Varley conducted the most extensive examination of the site. His work, which was not published until the 1990s, remains the most authoritative work on the site. His excavations showed that the complex defensive ramparts that surround the hill fort were not built at the same time and that there were four distinct phases in their development.

The hill fort is managed by English Heritage. Access is free.

Since 2015, housing developers have been trying to get planning permission for new homes near the slopes of the ancient monument. However, an ongoing campaign (backed by local residents and archaeologists) has stalled these proposals.

In 2024 a 3D model was produced to inform vegetation management.

<text>Guan Yu (; ), courtesy name Yunchang, was a Chinese military general serving under the warlord Liu Bei during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. Along with Zhang Fei, he shared a brotherly relationship with Liu Bei and accompanied him on most of his early exploits. Guan Yu played a significant role in the events leading up to the end of the Han dynasty and the establishment of Liu Bei&#x27;s state of Shu Han during the Three Kingdoms period. While he is remembered for his loyalty towards Liu Bei, he is also known for repaying Cao Cao&#x27;s kindness by slaying Yan Liang, a general under Cao Cao&#x27;s rival Yuan Shao, at the Battle of Boma. After Liu Bei gained control of Yi Province in 214, Guan Yu remained in Jing Province to govern and defend the area for about seven years. In 219, while he was away fighting Cao Cao&#x27;s forces at the Battle of Fancheng, Liu Bei&#x27;s ally Sun Quan broke the Sun–Liu alliance and sent his general Lü Meng to conquer Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province. By the time Guan Yu learned about the loss of Jing Province after his defeat at Fancheng, it was too late. He was subsequently captured in an ambush by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces and executed at Linju, Xiangyang Commandery (, present-day Nanzhang County, Xiangyang City, Hubei).

Guan Yu&#x27;s life was lionised and his achievements were glorified to such an extent after his death that he was deified during the Sui dynasty. Through generations of storytelling, culminating in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, his deeds and moral qualities have been emphasized immensely, making Guan Yu one of East Asia&#x27;s most popular paradigms of loyalty and righteousness. He is remembered as a culture hero in Chinese culture and is still worshipped by many people of Chinese descent in China, Taiwan, and other countries today. In religious devotion, he is reverentially called the &quot;Emperor Guan&quot; (&quot;Guān Dì&quot;) or &quot;Lord Guan&quot; (&quot;Guān Gōng&quot;). He is a deity worshipped in Chinese folk religion, popular Confucianism, Taoism, and Chinese Buddhism, and small shrines to him are almost ubiquitous in traditional Chinese shops and restaurants.

==Historical sources==
The authoritative historical source on Guan Yu&#x27;s life is the &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (&quot;Sanguozhi&quot;) written by Chen Shou in the third century. During the fifth century, Pei Songzhi annotated the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; by incorporating information from other sources to Chen Shou&#x27;s original work and adding his personal comments. Some alternative texts used in the annotations to Guan Yu&#x27;s biography include: &quot;Shu Ji&quot; (&quot;Records of Shu&quot;), by Wang Yin; &quot;Wei Shu&quot; (&quot;Book of Wei&quot;), by Wang Chen, Xun Yi and Ruan Ji; &quot;Jiang Biao Zhuan&quot;, by Yu Pu; &quot;Fu Zi&quot;, by Fu Xuan; &quot;Dianlue&quot;, by Yu Huan; &quot;Wu Li&quot; (&quot;History of Wu&quot;), by Hu Chong; and &quot;Chronicles of Huayang&quot;, by Chang Qu.

==Physical appearance==

No explicit descriptions of Guan Yu&#x27;s physical appearance exist in historical records. However, the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; recorded that Zhuge Liang once referred to Guan Yu as having a &quot;peerless beard&quot;.

Traditionally, Guan Yu is portrayed as a red-faced warrior with a long, lush beard. The idea of his red face may have been derived from a description of him in Chapter 1 of the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, where the following passage appears:

Alternatively, the idea of his red face could have been borrowed from opera representation, where red faces represented loyalty and righteousness. In illustrations of &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Guan Yu is traditionally depicted wearing a green robe over his body armour.

In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, Guan Yu&#x27;s weapon was a &quot;guandao&quot; named Green Dragon Crescent Blade, which resembled a glaive and was said to weigh 82 catties (about 49 kg or 108 lbs).

==Early life and career==
Guan Yu was from Xie County (), Hedong Commandery, which is present-day Yuncheng, Shanxi. His original courtesy name was Changsheng (). He was very studious, and was interested in the ancient history book &quot;Zuo zhuan&quot; and could fluently recite lines from it. He fled from his hometown for unknown reasons and went to Zhuo Commandery. When the Yellow Turban Rebellion broke out in the 180s, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei joined a volunteer militia formed by Liu Bei, and they assisted a colonel Zou Jing in suppressing the revolt. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were known as stalwart and strong men; which made them talented fighters.

When Liu Bei was appointed as the Minister () of Pingyuan, Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were appointed as Majors of Separate Command (), each commanding detachments of soldiers under Liu Bei. Liu Bei cherished them as if they were his own brothers and the three of them were as close as brothers to the point of sharing the same room, sleeping on the same mat and eating from the same pot. Zhang Fei and Guan Yu protected Liu Bei whenever there were large crowds of people and also stood guard beside him when he sat down at meetings all day long. They followed him on his exploits and were always ready to face any danger and hardship. And for their military prowess were appraised as &quot;enemy of ten-thousand&quot;. Guan Yu was noted for his kindness towards his soldiers and fealty to Liu Bei akin to family, but had no respect for the gentry and treated them without courtesy.

==Short service under Cao Cao==

===Background===
Liu Bei and his men followed Cao Cao back to the imperial capital Xu after their victory over Lü Bu at the Battle of Xiapi in 198. About a year later, Liu Bei and his followers escaped from Xu under the pretext of helping Cao Cao lead an army to attack Yuan Shu. Liu Bei went to Xu Province, killed the provincial inspector Che Zhou (), and seized control of the province. He moved to Xiaopei and left Guan Yu in charge of the provincial capital Xiapi.

In 200, Cao Cao led his forces to attack Liu Bei, defeated him and retook Xu Province. Liu Bei fled to northern China and found refuge under Cao Cao&#x27;s rival Yuan Shao, while Guan Yu was captured by Cao Cao&#x27;s forces and brought back to Xu. Cao Cao treated Guan Yu respectfully and asked Emperor Xian to appoint Guan Yu as a Lieutenant-General ().

===Battle of Boma===
Later that year, Yuan Shao sent his general Yan Liang to lead an army to attack Cao Cao&#x27;s garrison at Boma (; near present-day Hua County, Henan), which was defended by Liu Yan (). Cao Cao sent Zhang Liao and Guan Yu to lead the vanguard to engage the enemy. In the midst of battle, Guan Yu recognised Yan Liang&#x27;s parasol so he charged towards Yan Liang, decapitated him and returned with his head. Yan Liang&#x27;s men could not stop him. With Yan Liang&#x27;s death, the siege on Boma was lifted. On Cao Cao&#x27;s recommendation, Emperor Xian awarded Guan Yu the peerage of &quot;Marquis of Hanshou Village&quot; ().

===Leaving Cao Cao===
Although Cao Cao admired Guan Yu&#x27;s character, he also sensed that Guan Yu had no intention of serving under him for long. He told Zhang Liao, &quot;Why don&#x27;t you make use of your friendship with Guan Yu to find out what he wants?&quot; When Zhang Liao asked him, Guan Yu replied, &quot;I am aware that Lord Cao treats me very generously. However, I have also received many favours from General Liu and I have sworn to follow him until I die. I cannot break my oath. I will leave eventually, so maybe you can help me convey my message to Lord Cao.&quot; Zhang Liao did so, and Cao Cao was even more impressed with Guan Yu. The &quot;Fu Zi&quot; gave a slightly different account of this incident. It recorded that Zhang Liao faced a dilemma of whether or not to convey Guan Yu&#x27;s message to Cao Cao: if he did, Cao Cao might execute Guan Yu; if he did not, he would be failing in his service to Cao Cao. He sighed, &quot;Lord Cao is my superior and he is like a father to me, while Guan Yu is like a brother to me.&quot; He eventually decided to tell Cao Cao. Cao Cao said, &quot;A subject who serves his lord but doesn&#x27;t forget his origins is truly a man of righteousness. When do you think he will leave?&quot; Zhang Liao replied, &quot;Guan Yu has received favours from Your Excellency. He will most probably leave after he has repaid your kindness.&quot;

After Guan Yu slew Yan Liang and lifted the siege on Baima, Cao Cao knew that he would leave soon so he gave Guan Yu greater rewards. Guan Yu sealed up all the gifts he received from Cao Cao, wrote a farewell letter, and headed towards Yuan Shao&#x27;s territory to find Liu Bei. Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates wanted to pursue Guan Yu, but Cao Cao stopped them and said, &quot;He&#x27;s just doing his duty to his lord. There&#x27;s no need to pursue him.&quot;

Pei Songzhi commented on this as follows: &quot;Cao Cao admired Guan Yu&#x27;s character even though he knew that Guan Yu would not remain under him. He did not send his men to pursue Guan Yu when Guan Yu left, so as to allow Guan Yu to fulfil his allegiance (to Liu Bei). If he was not as magnanimous as a great warlord should be, how would he allow this to happen? This was an example of Cao Cao&#x27;s goodness.&quot;

==Returning to Liu Bei==
When Cao Cao and Yuan Shao clashed at the Battle of Guandu in 200, Yuan sent Liu Bei to contact Liu Pi (), a Yellow Turban rebel chief in Runan (), and assist Liu Pi in attacking the imperial capital Xu while Cao Cao was away at Guandu. Guan Yu reunited with Liu Bei around this time. Liu Bei and Liu Pi were defeated by Cao Cao&#x27;s general Cao Ren, after which Liu Bei returned to Yuan Shao. Liu Bei secretly planned to leave Yuan Shao, so he pretended to persuade Yuan Shao to form an alliance with Liu Biao, the Governor of Jing Province. Yuan Shao sent Liu Bei to contact another rebel leader, Gong Du (), in Runan, where they gathered a few thousand soldiers. Cao Cao turned back and attacked Runan after scoring a decisive victory over Yuan Shao at Guandu. Liu Bei fled south and found shelter under Liu Biao, who put him in charge of Xinye at the northern border of Jing Province. Guan Yu followed Liu Bei to Xinye.

==Battle of Red Cliffs and aftermath==
Liu Biao died in 208 and was succeeded by his younger son, Liu Cong, who surrendered Jing Province to Cao Cao when the latter started a campaign that year with the aim of wiping out opposing forces in southern China. Liu Bei evacuated Xinye together with his followers and they headed towards Xiakou, which was guarded by Liu Biao&#x27;s elder son Liu Qi and independent of Cao Cao&#x27;s control. Along the journey, Liu Bei divided his party into two groups – one led by Guan Yu which would sail along the river towards Jiangling; another led by Liu Bei which would travel on land. Cao Cao sent 5,000 elite cavalry to pursue Liu Bei&#x27;s group and they caught up with them at Changban, where the Battle of Changban broke out. Liu Bei and his remaining followers managed to escape from Cao Cao&#x27;s forces and reach Han Ford (), where Guan Yu&#x27;s group picked them up and they sailed to Xiakou together.

In 208, Liu Bei allied with Sun Quan and they defeated Cao Cao at the decisive Battle of Red Cliffs. Cao Cao retreated north after his defeat and left Cao Ren behind to defend Jing Province. During the Battle of Jiangling, Guan Yu was stationed at the northern routes to block Cao Ren&#x27;s supply lines via infiltration. Li Tong engaged Guan Yu, attempting to support Cao Ren&#x27;s forces, but died from illness during the campaign. Xu Huang and Man Chong also engaged with Guan Yu in Hanjin() in order support Cao Ren against Zhou Yu. Finally, Yue Jin, stationed in Xiangyang, defeated Guan Yu and Su Fei () and drove them away. After seizing and pacifying the various commanderies in southern Jing Province, Liu Bei appointed Guan Yu as the Administrator () of Xiangyang and General Who Defeats Bandits (), and ordered him to station at the north of the Yangtze River.

==Guarding Jing Province==
Between 212 and 214, Liu Bei started a campaign to seize control of Yi Province from the provincial governor Liu Zhang. Most of Liu Bei&#x27;s subordinates participated in the campaign, while Guan Yu remained behind to guard and oversee Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province.

===Sun-Liu territorial dispute===
During the mid 210s, a territorial dispute broke out between Liu Bei and Sun Quan in southern Jing Province. According to an earlier arrangement, Liu Bei &quot;borrowed&quot; southern Jing Province from Sun Quan to serve as a temporary base; he would have to return the territories to Sun Quan once he found another base. After Liu Bei seized control of Yi Province, Sun Quan asked him to return three commanderies but Liu Bei refused. Sun Quan then sent his general Lü Meng to lead his forces to seize the three commanderies. In response, Liu Bei ordered Guan Yu to lead troops to stop Lü Meng. Gan Ning, one of Lü Meng&#x27;s subordinates, managed to deter Guan Yu from crossing the shallows near Yiyang. The shallows were thus named &#x27;Guan Yu&#x27;s Shallows&#x27; (). Lu Su (the overall commander of Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Jing Province) later invited Guan Yu to attend a meeting to settle the territorial dispute. Around 215, after Cao Cao seized control of Hanzhong Commandery, Liu Bei saw that as a strategic threat to his position in Yi Province so he decided to make peace with Sun Quan and agreed to divide southern Jing Province between his and Sun Quan&#x27;s domains along the Xiang River. Both sides then withdrew their forces.

==Battle of Fancheng==
In 219, Liu Bei emerged victorious in the Hanzhong Campaign against Cao Cao, after which he declared himself &quot;King of Hanzhong&quot; (). He appointed Guan Yu as General of the Vanguard () and bestowed upon him a ceremonial axe. In the same year, Guan Yu led his forces to attack Cao Ren at Fancheng and besiege the fortress. Cao Cao sent Yu Jin to lead reinforcements to help Cao Ren. It was in autumn and there were heavy showers so the Han River overflowed. The flood destroyed Yu Jin&#x27;s seven armies. Guan Yu had prepared his navy to advance during the flood, and Yu Jin surrendered to Guan Yu while his subordinate Pang De refused and was executed by Guan Yu. Various local officials such as Administrator of Nanxiang Fu Fang and Inspector Jing Province Hu Xiu defected to Guan Yu. Angered by Cao Cao&#x27;s forced labor put upon them, rebel peasants and bandits in Liang(), Jia() and Luhun() also submitted to Guan Yu and received official seals to work as his raiders. Guan Yu&#x27;s fame spread throughout China.

The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; recorded that before Guan Yu embarked on the Fancheng campaign, he dreamt about a boar biting his foot. He told his son Guan Ping, &quot;I am growing weaker this year. I might not even return alive.&quot;

===Belittling Sun Quan===
With Liu Bei gaining Hanzhong as well as the northwest commanderies of Jing: Fangling, Shangyong and Xicheng; and now after Yu Jin&#x27;s defeat, Cao Cao contemplated relocating the imperial capital from Xu further north into Hebei to avoid Guan Yu, but Sima Yi and Jiang Ji told him that Sun Quan would become restless when he heard of Guan Yu&#x27;s victory. They suggested to Cao Cao to ally with Sun Quan and get him to help them hinder Guan Yu&#x27;s advances; in return, Cao Cao would recognise the legitimacy of Sun Quan&#x27;s claim over the territories in Jiangdong. In this way, the siege on Fancheng would automatically be lifted. Cao Cao heeded their suggestion. Previously, Sun Quan had sent a messenger to meet Guan Yu and propose a marriage between his son and Guan Yu&#x27;s daughter. However, Guan Yu not only rejected the proposal, but also scolded and humiliated the messenger. Sun Quan was enraged.

===Encounter with Xu Huang===
Cao Cao later sent Xu Huang to lead another army to reinforce Cao Ren at Fancheng. Xu Huang broke through Guan Yu&#x27;s encirclement and routed Guan Yu&#x27;s forces on the battlefield, thus lifting the siege on Fancheng. Guan Yu withdrew his forces after seeing that he could not capture Fancheng. The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; recorded an incident about Xu Huang encountering Guan Yu on the battlefield. Xu Huang was previously a close friend of Guan Yu. They often chatted about other things apart from military affairs. When they met again at Fancheng, Xu Huang gave an order to his men: &quot;Whoever takes Guan Yu&#x27;s head will be rewarded with 1,000 &quot;jin&quot; of gold.&quot; A shocked Guan Yu asked Xu Huang, &quot;Brother, what are you talking about?&quot; Xu Huang replied, &quot;This is an affair of the state.&quot;

==Losing Jing Province==

Although Guan Yu defeated and captured Yu Jin at Fancheng, his army found itself lacking food supplies, so he seized grain from one of Sun Quan&#x27;s granaries at Xiang Pass (). By then, Sun Quan had secretly agreed to an alliance with Cao Cao and sent Lü Meng and others to invade Jing Province while he followed behind with reinforcements. At Xunyang (), Lü Meng ordered his troops to hide in vessels disguised as civilian and merchant ships and sail towards Jing Province. Along the way, Lü Meng infiltrated and disabled the watchtowers set up by Guan Yu along the river, so Guan Yu was totally unaware of the invasion.

When Guan Yu embarked on the Fancheng campaign, he left Mi Fang and Shi Ren behind to defend his key bases in Jing Province – Nan Commandery and Gong&#x27;an. Guan Yu had constantly treated them with contempt. During the campaign, after Mi Fang and Shi Ren sent insufficient supplies to Guan Yu&#x27;s army at the frontline, an annoyed Guan Yu said, &quot;I will deal with them when I return.&quot; Mi Fang and Shi Ren felt uneasy about this. When Sun Quan invaded Jing Province, Lü Meng showed understanding towards Mi Fang and successfully induced him into surrendering while Yu Fan also persuaded Shi Ren to give up resistance. With the exceptions of the northwest, Liu Bei&#x27;s territories in Jing Province fell under Sun Quan&#x27;s control after the surrenders of Mi Fang and Shi Ren.

===Dubious account from the &quot;Dianlue&quot;===
The &quot;Dianlue&quot; recorded: 

Pei Songzhi commented on the &quot;Dianlue&quot; account as follows: 

==Death==

By the time Guan Yu retreated from Fancheng, Sun Quan&#x27;s forces had occupied Jiangling and captured the families of Guan Yu&#x27;s soldiers. Lü Meng ordered his troops to treat the civilians well and ensure that they were not harmed. Most of Guan Yu&#x27;s soldiers lost their fighting spirit and deserted and went back to Jing Province to reunite with their families. Guan Yu knew that he had been isolated so he withdrew to Maicheng (; in present-day Dangyang, Hubei) and headed west to Zhang District (), where his remaining men deserted him and surrendered to the enemy. Sun Quan sent Zhu Ran and Pan Zhang to block Guan Yu&#x27;s retreat route. Guan Yu, along with his son Guan Ping and subordinate Zhao Lei (), were captured alive by Pan Zhang&#x27;s deputy Ma Zhong () in an ambush. Guan Yu and Guan Ping were later executed by Sun Quan&#x27;s forces in Linju (; in present-day Nanzhang County, Hubei).

===Alternate account from the &quot;Shu Ji&quot;===
The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; mentioned that Sun Quan initially wanted to keep Guan Yu alive in the hope of using Guan Yu to help him counter Liu Bei and Cao Cao. However, his followers advised him against doing so by saying, &quot;A wolf shouldn&#x27;t be kept as a pet as it&#x27;ll bring harm to the keeper. Cao Cao made a mistake when he refused to kill Guan Yu and landed himself in deep trouble. He even had to consider relocating the imperial capital elsewhere. How can Guan Yu be allowed to live?&quot; Sun Quan then ordered Guan Yu&#x27;s execution.

Pei Songzhi disputed this account as follows: 

===Posthumous honours===
Sun Quan sent Guan Yu&#x27;s head to Cao Cao, who arranged a noble&#x27;s funeral for Guan Yu and had his head properly buried with full honours. In October or November 260, Liu Shan granted Guan Yu the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhuangmou&quot; (). According to posthumous naming rules in the &quot;Yi Zhou Shu&quot;, &quot;mou&quot; was meant for a person who failed to live up to his reputation.

==Anecdotes==
===Request to take Qin Yilu&#x27;s wife===
During the Battle of Xiapi in late 198, when the allied forces of Cao Cao and Liu Bei fought against Lü Bu, Guan Yu sought permission from Cao Cao to marry Qin Yilu&#x27;s wife Lady Du () after they won the battle. After Cao Cao agreed, Guan Yu still repeatedly reminded Cao Cao about his promise before the battle ended. After Lü Bu&#x27;s defeat and death, Cao Cao was so curious about why Guan Yu wanted Lady Du so badly and he guessed that she must be very beautiful, so he had her brought to him. Cao Cao ultimately broke his promise as he took Lady Du as his concubine and adopted her son Qin Lang (whom she had with Qin Yilu).

===Advice to Liu Bei===
The &quot;Shu Ji&quot; recorded an incident as follows: 

Pei Songzhi commented on the &quot;Shu Ji&quot; account as follows: 

===Asking Zhuge Liang about Ma Chao===
In 214, Ma Chao defected from Zhang Lu&#x27;s side to Liu Bei&#x27;s forces, and he assisted Liu Bei in pressuring Liu Zhang to surrender and yield Yi Province to Liu Bei. When Guan Yu received news that Ma Chao (whom he was unfamiliar with) had recently joined them, he wrote to Zhuge Liang in Yi Province and asked him who was comparable to Ma Chao. Zhuge Liang knew that Guan Yu was defending the border (so he should not displease Guan Yu). He replied: &quot;Mengqi is proficient in both civil and military affairs. He is fierce and mighty, and a hero of his time. He is comparable to Qing Bu and Peng Yue. He can compete with Yide, but he is not as good as the peerless beard.&quot;

Guan Yu was very pleased when he received Zhuge Liang&#x27;s reply and he welcomed Ma Chao.

===Arm injury===
Guan Yu was once injured in the left arm by a stray arrow which pierced through his arm. Although the wound healed, he still experienced pain in the bone whenever there was a heavy downpour. A physician told him, &quot;The arrowhead had poison on it and the poison had seeped into the bone. The way to get rid of this problem is to cut open your arm and scrape away the poison in your bone.&quot; Guan Yu then stretched out his arm and asked the physician to heal him. He then invited his subordinates to dine with him while the surgery was being performed. Blood flowed from his arm into a container below. Throughout the operation, Guan Yu feasted, consumed alcohol and chatted with his men as though nothing had happened.

==Family==
Guan Yu had two known sons – Guan Ping and Guan Xing. Guan Xing inherited his father&#x27;s title &quot;Marquis of Hanshou Village&quot; () and served in the state of Shu during the Three Kingdoms period. Guan Yu also had a daughter. Sun Quan once proposed a marriage between his son and Guan Yu&#x27;s daughter, but Guan Yu rejected the proposal. Her name was not recorded in history, but she was known as &quot;Guan Yinping&quot; () or &quot;Guan Feng&quot; () in folktales and Chinese opera, as well as in the &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series (as Guan Yinping). Guan Yu allegedly had a third son, Guan Suo, who is not mentioned in historical texts and appears only in folklore, the &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; novel, and in &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;.

Guan Xing&#x27;s son, Guan Tong (), married a princess (one of Liu Shan&#x27;s daughters) and served as a General of the Household () among the imperial guards. Guan Tong had no son when he died, so he was succeeded by his younger half-brother Guan Yi ().

According to the &quot;Shu Ji&quot;, after the fall of Shu in 263, Pang Hui (Pang De&#x27;s son) massacred Guan Yu&#x27;s family and descendants to avenge his father, who was executed by Guan Yu after the Battle of Fancheng in 219.

In 1719, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty awarded the hereditary title &quot;Wujing Boshi&quot; (; &quot;Professor of the Five Classics&quot;) to Guan Yu&#x27;s descendants living in Luoyang. The bearer of the title is entitled to an honorary position in the Hanlin Academy.

==Appraisal==

Chen Shou, who wrote Guan Yu&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot;, commented on the latter as such: &quot;Guan Yu and Zhang Fei were praised as mighty warriors capable of fighting ten thousand of enemies (萬人敵). They were like tigers among (Liu Bei&#x27;s) subjects. Guan Yu and Zhang Fei both had the style of a &quot;guoshi&quot;. Guan Yu repaid Cao Cao&#x27;s kindness while Zhang Fei released Yan Yan out of righteousness. However, Guan Yu was unrelenting and conceited while Zhang Fei was brutal and heartless. These shortcomings resulted in their downfalls. This was not something uncommon.&quot;

==Worship==
Guan Yu was deified as early as the Sui dynasty (581–618), and is still worshipped today as a bodhisattva in Buddhist tradition and as a guardian deity in Chinese folk religion and Taoism. He is also held in high esteem in Confucianism and in new religious movements such as Yiguandao.

===In Chinese religion===


In Chinese folk religion, Guan Yu is widely referred to as &quot;Emperor Guan&quot; (; &quot;dì&quot; implies deified status) and &quot;Lord Guan&quot; (), while his Taoist title is &quot;Holy Emperor Lord Guan&quot; (). Martial temples and shrines dedicated exclusively to Guan Yu can be found across mainland China, Hong Kong, Macau, Taiwan, and other places with Chinese influence such as Vietnam, South Korea and Japan. Some of these temples, such as the Haizhou Guandi Temple in Shanxi, were built exactly in the layout of an imperial residence, befitting his status as a &quot;ruler&quot;. Other examples of Guan Yu temples in China include the Guandi Temple of Jinan and the Guanlin Temple of Luoyang.

==== Historical veneration ====
The apotheosis of Guan Yu occurred in stages, as he was given ever higher posthumous titles. Liu Shan, the second emperor of Shu, gave Guan Yu the posthumous title of &quot;Marquis Zhuangmou&quot; () four decades after his death. During the Song dynasty, Emperor Huizong bestowed upon Guan Yu the title &quot;Duke Zhonghui&quot; (), and later the title of a prince. In 1187, Emperor Xiaozong honoured Guan Yu as &quot;Prince Zhuangmou Yiyong Wu&#x27;an Yingji&quot; (). During the Yuan dynasty, Emperor Wenzong changed Guan Yu&#x27;s title to &quot;Prince of Xianling Yiyong Wu&#x27;an Yingji&quot; ().

In 1614, the Wanli Emperor bestowed on Guan Yu the title &quot;Holy Emperor Guan, the Great God Who Subdues Demons in the Three Worlds and Whose Awe Spreads Far and Moves Heaven&quot; (). During the Qing dynasty, the Shunzhi Emperor gave Guan Yu the title of &quot;Guan, the Loyal and Righteous God of War, the Holy Great Emperor&quot; () in 1644. This title was expanded to &quot;Guan the Holy Great Emperor; God of War Manifesting Benevolence, Bravery and Prestige; Protector of the Country and Defender of the People; Proud and Honest Supporter of Peace and Reconciliation; Promoter of Morality, Loyalty and Righteousness&quot; (), a total of 24 Chinese characters, by the mid-19th century. It is often shortened to &quot;Saint of War&quot; (), which is of the same rank as Confucius, who is honoured the &quot;Saint of Culture&quot; (). The Qing dynasty promoted the worship of Guan Yu among the Mongol tribes, making him one of their most revered religious figures, second only to their lamas.

Throughout history, Guan Yu has also been credited with many military successes. In the 14th century, his spirit was said to have aided Zhu Yuanzhang, the founder of the Ming dynasty, at the Battle of Lake Poyang. In 1402, when Zhu Di launched a coup d&#x27;état and successfully deposed his nephew, the Jianwen Emperor, Zhu Di claimed that he was blessed by the spirit of Guan Yu. During the last decade of the 16th century, Guan Yu was also credited with the repulse of Japanese invasion of Korea by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The Manchu imperial clan of the Qing dynasty was also associated with Guan Yu&#x27;s martial qualities. During the 20th century, Guan Yu was worshipped by the warlord Yuan Shikai, president and later a short-lived emperor of China.

Guan Yu&#x27;s messages were received by mediums through spirit writing, later called Fuji (planchette writing) (), since the late 17th century. &quot;By the mid-Qianlong period (1736–96) the number of &#x27;sacred edicts&#x27; issued by Guandi ordering people to do good and help those in need became increasingly frequent.&quot; In the 19th century, Guandi&#x27;s messages received through spirit writing assumed a millennialist character. Dates were announced for the end of the world, followed by messages indicating that Guandi had &quot;prevented the apocalypse&quot; and was indeed &quot;the savior of endtimes.&quot; In 1866, the Ten Completions Society (Shiquanhui 十全會) was established to propagate the messages of Guandi and promote the charitable work his spirit had ordered to perform. The tradition of Guandi spirit writing continued in Chinese folk Religion well into the 20th century.

==== Contemporary veneration ====
Today, Guan Yu is still widely worshipped by the Chinese; he may be worshipped in Martial temples and Wen Wu temples, and small shrines devoted to him are also found in homes, businesses and fraternal organisations. In Hong Kong, a shrine to Guan Yu can be found in every police station. Though by no means mandatory, Chinese police officers worship and pay respect to him. Although seemingly ironic, members of the triads and Heaven and Earth Society worship Guan Yu as well. Statues used by triads tend to hold the halberd in the left hand, and statues in police stations tend to hold the halberd in the right hand. This signifies which side Guan Yu is worshipped, by the righteous people or vice versa. The appearance of Guan Yu&#x27;s face for the triads is usually more stern and threatening than the usual statue. In Hong Kong, Guan Yu is often referred to as &quot;Yi Gor&quot; (; Cantonese for &quot;second elder brother&quot;) for he was second to Liu Bei in their fictional sworn brotherhood. Guan Yu is also worshipped by Chinese businessmen in Shanxi, Hong Kong, Macau and Southeast Asia as an alternative wealth god, since he is perceived to bless the upright and protect them from the wicked. Another reason is related to the release of Cao Cao during the Huarong Trail incident, in which he let Cao and his men pass through safely. For that, he was perceived to be able to extend the lifespan of people in need. Among Chinese Filipinos in the Philippines, Guan Yu is also sometimes known as &quot;Santo Santiago&quot; (St. James) or in Hokkien as &quot;Te Ya Kong&quot; (Hokkien ) or &quot;Kuan Kong&quot; (Hokkien ).

Among the Cantonese people who emigrated to California during the mid-19th century, the worship of Guan Yu was an important element. Statues and tapestry images of the god can be found in a number of historical California joss houses (a local term for Chinese folk religion temples), where his name may be given with various Anglicised spellings, including: &quot;Kwan Dai&quot;, &quot;Kwan Tai&quot; or &quot;Kuan Ti&quot; for &quot;Guandi&quot; (Emperor Guan); &quot;Kuan Kung&quot; for &quot;Guan Gong&quot; (Lord Guan), &quot;Wu Ti&quot; or &quot;Mo Dai&quot; for &quot;Wu Di&quot; (War Deity), &quot;Kuan Yu&quot;, &quot;Kwan Yu&quot;, or &quot;Quan Yu&quot; for Guan Yu. The Mendocino Joss House, a historical landmark also known as Mo Dai Miu (&quot;Wudimiao&quot;, i.e. the Temple of the Deity of War), or Temple of Kwan Tai, built in 1852, is a typical example of the small shrines erected to Guan Yu in the United States.

Guan Yu is also worshipped as a door god in Chinese and Taoist temples, with portraits of him being pasted on doors to ward off evil spirits, usually in pairings with Zhang Fei, Guan Ping, Guan Sheng or Zhou Cang.

Apart from general worship, Guan Yu is also commemorated in China with colossal statues such as the 1,320-tonne sculpture in Jingzhou City, Hubei Province, standing at 58 metres.

===In Taoism===
Guan Yu is revered as &quot;Holy Ruler Deity Guan&quot; () and a leading subduer of demons in Taoism. Taoist worship of Guan Yu began during the Song dynasty. Legend has it that during the second decade of the 12th century, the saltwater lake in Xiezhou gradually ceased to yield salt. Emperor Huizong then summoned Zhang Jixian (), a 30th-generation descendant of Zhang Daoling, to investigate the cause. The emperor was told that the disruption was the work of Chi You, a deity of war. Zhang Jixian then recruited the help of Guan Yu, who battled Chi You over the lake and triumphed, whereupon the lake resumed salt production. Emperor Huizong then bestowed upon Guan Yu the title &quot;Immortal of Chongning&quot; (), formally introducing the latter as a deity into Taoism.

In the early Ming dynasty, the 42nd Celestial Master, Zhang Zhengchang (), recorded the incident in his book &quot;Lineage of the Han Celestial Masters&quot; (), the first Taoist classic to affirm the legend. Today, Taoist practices are predominant in Guan Yu worship. Many temples dedicated to Guan Yu, including the Emperor Guan Temple in Xiezhou County, show heavy Taoist influence. Every year, on the 24th day of the sixth month on the lunar calendar (Guan Yu&#x27;s birthday in legend), a street parade in Guan Yu&#x27;s honour would also be held.

===In Buddhism===
In Chinese Buddhism, Guan Yu is revered by most Chinese Mahayana Buddhists as Sangharama Bodhisattva () a heavenly protector of the Buddhist dharma. &quot;Sangharama&quot; in Sanskrit means &#x27;community garden&#x27; (&quot;sangha&quot;, community + &quot;arama&quot;, garden) and thus &#x27;monastery&#x27;. The term &quot;Sangharama&quot; also refer to the dharmapala class of devas and spirits assigned to guard the Buddhist monastery, the dharma, and the faith itself. Over time and as an act of syncreticism, Guan Yu was seen as the representative guardian of the temple and the garden in which it stands. His statue traditionally is situated in the far left of the main altar, opposite his counterpart Skanda.

According to Buddhist legends, in 592, Guan Yu manifested himself one night before the Chan master Zhiyi, the founder of the Tiantai school of Buddhism, along with a retinue of spiritual beings. Zhiyi was then in deep meditation on Jade Spring Hill () when he was distracted by Guan Yu&#x27;s presence. Guan Yu then requested the master to teach him about the dharma. After receiving Buddhist teachings from the master, Guan Yu took refuge in the triple gems and also requested the Five Precepts. Henceforth, it is said that Guan Yu made a vow to become a guardian of temples and the dharma. Legends also claim that Guan Yu assisted Zhiyi in the construction of the Yuquan Temple, which still stands today.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

The 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; glorifies Guan Yu by portraying him as a righteous and loyal warrior. Guan Yu is one of the most altered and aggrandised characters in the novel, which accounts for his popular image in Chinese society.

==In popular culture==
===Chinese opera===
Guan Yu appears in Chinese operas such as &quot;Huarong Trail&quot;, &quot;Red Cliffs&quot;, and other excerpts from &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;. His costume is a green military opera uniform with armour covering his right arm and the knees of his pants. The actor&#x27;s face is painted red with a few black lines, to represent honour and courage. He also wears a long three-section black beard made of yak hair and carries the Green Dragon Crescent Blade. Traditionally, after the show ends, the actor has to wash his face, burn joss paper, light incense, and pray to Chinese deities.

===Film and television===
Notable actors who have portrayed Guan Yu in film and television include: Lu Shuming in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; (1994); Wang Yingquan in &quot;The Legend of Guan Gong&quot; (2004); Ti Lung in &quot;Three Kingdoms: Resurrection of the Dragon&quot; (2008); Ba Sen in &quot;Red Cliff&quot; (2008–2009); Yu Rongguang in &quot;Three Kingdoms&quot; (2010); Donnie Yen in &quot;The Lost Bladesman&quot; (2011); Au Sui-Wai in &quot;Three Kingdoms RPG&quot; (2012); Han Geng in &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; (2019).

Films which make references to Guan Yu include: Stephen Chow&#x27;s comedy film &quot;From Beijing with Love&quot; (1994), which, in one scene, refers to the story of Hua Tuo performing surgery on Guan Yu&#x27;s arm; Zhang Yimou&#x27;s &quot;Riding Alone for Thousands of Miles&quot; (2005), in which the fictional story of Guan Yu slaying six generals and crossing five passes forms a major part of the narrative; the horror comedy film &quot;My Name Is Bruce&quot; (2007), where Guan Yu&#x27;s vengeful spirit is accidentally set free by a group of teenagers and he begins to terrorise their town.

===Games===
Guan Yu appears as a playable character in many video games based on &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; which are produced by Koei, including: the strategy game series of the same title as the novel; the action game series &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;. Other non-Koei titles in which he also appears include: &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;; &quot; &quot;Puzzle &amp; Dragons&quot;; &quot;Sango Fighter&quot;; &quot;Destiny of an Emperor&quot;; and &quot;Atlantica Online&quot;. He is also referenced in &quot;&quot;, &quot;Titan Quest&quot;, and &quot;Koihime Musō&quot;.

Guan Yu is referenced in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; of the card game &quot;&quot; on a playable card.

The hero Jiang Jun that appears in an add-on for the game &quot;For Honor&quot;, developed by Ubisoft Montreal, is heavily based on Guan Yu. He is introduced in the 2018 DLC &quot;Marching Fire Expansion&quot;, along with the other characters from the Chinese Wulin faction. The Jiang Jun wields Guan Yu&#x27;s signature Guandao weapon and is portrayed as a wise older general.

Guan Yu is referenced in the 2020 game &quot;Hades&quot; by Supergiant Games. The final &quot;aspect&quot;, or form, unlocked for the Eternal Spear weapon is the Aspect of Guan Yu, the Frost Fair Blade, which resembles an ornamented Guandao. The Eternal Spear is said to be the same spear wielded by Guan Yu in the future, taking this form.

===Coinage===
Guan Yu is a popular motif in collector coins series featuring Ancient warriors. The Polish Mint issued a 2oz silver coin featuring him in 2019, and another one in 2021.

== In modern politics ==
During the course of price liberalization debates as part of China&#x27;s reform and opening up, Deng Xiaoping invoked the fictitious story of Guan Yu crossing five passes and slaying six generals (as described in the novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;) as part of his rhetoric. &quot;To the Chinese audience familiar with the famous tale of Lord Guan, there could have been no doubt of Deng&#x27;s determination to push ahead with radical price reforms.&quot; As Deng explained in 1986 to a North Korean delegation:

<text>Xiahou Dun () (died 13 June 220), courtesy name Yuanrang, was a Chinese military general and politician serving under the warlord Cao Cao during the late Eastern Han dynasty of China. He served for a few months under Cao Cao&#x27;s successor, Cao Pi, before his death. As one of Cao Cao&#x27;s most trusted generals, Xiahou Dun aided the warlord in his campaigns against Lü Bu, Liu Bei, Sun Quan and others.

Xiahou Dun lost his left eye when he was a hit by a stray arrow during a battle against Lü Bu in the late 190s, and subsequently became known among the rank and file as &quot;One-eyed Xiahou&quot;. His image as a one-eyed warrior was popularized by the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, in which he yanked the arrow out of his eye and devoured his eyeball, an event that has become a symbol of his determination and resilience.

==Early life==
Xiahou Dun was from Qiao County (), Pei State (), which is on present-day Bozhou, Anhui. He was a descendant of Xiahou Ying, who served under the Han dynasty&#x27;s founding emperor, Liu Bang (Emperor Gao) and though the family didn&#x27;t reach national prominence in the centuries since, they were a leading family in Pei, often intermarrying down the generations with other prominent local clans the Dings and the Caos. Xiahou Dun first gained prominence when he killed a man who insulted his teacher when he was 13 years old.

In the 180s, possibly when Cao Cao was appointed Cavalry Commandant to help fight Yellow Turbans in Yingchuan, Xiahou Dun helped raise troops and from then on, would follow him across many a battle as his second in command. In 190, when Cao Cao was raising an army to participate in the campaign against Dong Zhuo, Xiahou Dun became his Major () and when they were defeated by Xu Rong at Suanzao, Xiahou Dun went with Cao Cao to recruit more troops in Yang province, though they would face a mutiny among their new soldiers. Xiahou Dun was sent to garrison Boma (白馬; near present-day Hua County, Henan), later promoted to Colonel Who Breaks and Charges () and as Cao Cao became Governor of Yan in 192, succeeded him as the Administrator () of Dong Commandery (東郡; the areas around present-day Puyang, Henan and Liaocheng, Shandong).

==Defence of Yan Province==
In 193, Cao Cao left his base in Yan Province on a campaign against Tao Qian, the Governor of Xu Province, whom he held responsible for the murder of his father Cao Song. Xiahou Dun was left behind in Dong commandery, stationed to hold its capital Puyang.

While Cao Cao was away in Xu Province, his subordinates Zhang Miao and Chen Gong rebelled in Yan Province and invited the warlord Lü Bu to take Yan but Zhang Miao&#x27;s attempt to reassure Xun Yu of Lü Bu&#x27;s intent instead tipped off Xun Yu of the revolt, so Xun Yu wrote to Xiahou Dun for reinforcements to Juancheng County. Xiahou Dun led a lightly armed force towards Juancheng, but he encountered Lü Bu&#x27;s army on the way and engaged the enemy in battle. Lü Bu withdrew his forces and took advantage of Xiahou Dun&#x27;s absence to conquer Puyang, capturing much of Xiahou&#x27;s supplies and equipment. Lü Bu later sent his men to pretend to surrender to Xiahou Dun, who fell for the ruse and was taken hostage by the enemy in his own camp. Lü Bu&#x27;s men demanded a heavy ransom. Xiahou Dun&#x27;s troops became fearful and confused when they heard that their commander had been taken hostage. Xiahou Dun&#x27;s personally recruited subordinate Han Hao settled the troops then ordered an attack on the surprised hostage takers, who surrendered. Han Hao ordered them executed, and Xiahou Dun was saved.

Xiahou Dun, the mishap dealt with, continued to lead his forces eastwards to Juancheng where the situation was critical, reinforcing the small garrison there while some officials and members of the garrison plotted joining the revolt. That night, Xiahou Dun executed the plotters and settled the army. He also urged Xun Yu not to meet the wavering Inspector of Yu Guo Gong and his army, as Xun Yu was too important, but Xun Yu went and was able to persuade Guo Gong to withdraw. Xiahou Dun would be a core part of the Cao loyalists holding the slim remaining holdings in the eastern part of Yan, him and Xun Yu sending the local Cheng Yu to encourage Fan and Dong&#x27;e to hold out.

When Cao Cao learned of the rebellion, he withdrew his army from Xu Province and returned to Yan Province to attack Lü Bu. Xiahou Dun participated in the campaign against Lü Bu and was hit in the left eye by a stray arrow during a skirmish. After the loss of his left eye, when Dun and his cousin Xiahou Yuan had both reached the rank of General (putting this from 209 onwards), he was given the nickname &quot;One-eyed Xiahou&quot; () in Cao Cao&#x27;s army. Xiahou Dun hated this nickname and would throw a mirror to the ground whenever he saw his own reflection. Lü Bu and Cao Cao fought near Puyang for over 100 days, with Xiahou Dun&#x27;s Major Dian Wei catching Cao Cao&#x27;s eye, but famine cost Lü Bu momentum and in 195, Cao Cao drove Lü Bu out of Yan.

==Mid-career==
Xiahou Dun was appointed as the Administrator () of Chenliu (陳留; around present-day Kaifeng, Henan) commandery, the area once under Zhang Miao&#x27;s control, where had a falling out with his Reporting Officer Wei Zhen around 200. Xiahou Dun invited Wei Zhen to bring his wife out to the feast, to which Wei Zhen strongly objected to as inappropriate to the fury of Xiahou Dun who had his subordinate jailed but soon released him. Then to Jiyin (濟陰; near present-day Dingtao County, Shandong) commandery, and held the rank of General Who Builds Martial Might (). He was also enfeoffed as the Marquis of Gao&#x27;an District (). While he was in office, a drought broke out and there was a locust infestation in the region. To counter these problems, Xiahou Dun spearheaded an agricultural program, in which he instructed workers to dam up the Taishou River (太壽水; a tributary of the Huai River) to create a large pond. He personally participated in the construction works and also encouraged the people to grow crops in the inundated land. This program greatly aided the people during those years of severe famine. He was later reassigned to be the Intendant of Henan (). In 198 Xiahou Dun was dispatched to Xu to reinforce the allied Liu Bei, who was under attack from Gao Shun on the orders of Lü Bu, but Gao Shun defeated Xiahou Dun then would drive out Liu Bei.

Xiahou Dun did not participate in Cao Cao&#x27;s campaigns in northern China against Yuan Shao, Yuan&#x27;s sons and their allies throughout the 200s CE. Instead, he held Henan, possibly the campaign being when he was made Intendant of Henan, helping keep Cao Cao&#x27;s western flank secure and holding the Meng ford to protect the Ao Granary. In 202, Cao Cao&#x27;s rival Liu Bei, who had sought refuge under Jing Province&#x27;s governor Liu Biao, launched a series of raids into Cao Cao&#x27;s lands. In response, Cao Cao sent Xiahou Dun, Yu Jin and Li Dian to lead an army to resist Liu Bei, both sides clashed at the Battle of Bowang. Liu Bei burnt his camps and feigned retreat to lure the enemy into an ambush. Xiahou Dun and his men fell for the trick and were defeated in the ambush. Li Dian, who warned Xiahou Dun about the danger of an ambush and did not join in the pursuit, led reinforcements to help Xiahou Dun and Yu Jin. Liu Bei withdrew his forces after seeing Li Dian&#x27;s approach and the raid stopped.

After the Battle of Ye in 204, Xiahou Dun was promoted to General Who Calms the Waves () but retained his appointment as the Intendant of Henan with the freedom to act on his own initiative without being restricted by regulations. In 205, Gao Gan encouraged revolts in Hedong with Wei Gu holding the Shan crossing and local loyal forces unable to cross, Xiahou Dun was sent but before he could arrive, Du Ji persuaded Xiahou Dun to let him go across with a small escort and plot with the local loyalists. On 21 March 207, as Cao Cao prepared to attack the remnants of the Yuan family, he rewarded 20 of his officers with greater enoffments with Xiahou Dun granted an additional 1,800 taxable households in his marquisate in recognition of his contributions, bringing the total number of households to 2,500. Xiahou Dun befriended Tian Chou and would be sent by Cao Cao to, unsuccessfully, persuade Tian Chou to take up honors for his service In 213, Xiahou Dun would be one of the signatories calling for Cao Cao to become Duke of Wei.

==Later life and death==
Xiahou Dun accompanied the 215 campaign in Hanzhong against the theocratic warlord Zhang Lu but Cao Cao&#x27;s forces struggled against Zhang Wei&#x27;s forces. According to Dong Zhao&#x27;s account, Cao Cao issued orders to recall with Xiahou Dun and Xu Chu were sent to bring the troops back from the hills. In the confusion, some of the returning troops got lost in the night and surprised some of the defenders who fled from their position. This was reported back to Xiahou Dun and, with some not believing it, Xiahou Dun rode forward to see for himself then went back to tell Cao Cao so they could exploit it, Zhang Wei&#x27;s position collapsed and Zhang Lu soon surrendered. In 216, he accompanied Cao Cao to Juchao (居巢; in present-day Chaohu, Anhui) against southern rival Sun Quan but met with stalemate. In 217, Cao Cao withdrew but left behind Xiahou Dun as Area Commander in command of 26 &quot;jun&quot;s () until Sun Quan negotiated terms including an acceptance of Cao Cao as King. As a reward for his contributions including at Juchao, he received a number of performing dancers and musicians. The imperial order that came with the reward read: &quot;When Wei Jiang (魏絳) pacified the Rong people, he was only rewarded with gold and riches. Don&#x27;t you, General, deserve more than him?&quot;

In 219, when Cao Cao marched to Mobei (摩陂; southeast of present-day Jia County, Henan) in response to Guan Yu&#x27;s attack, he treated Xiahou Dun with exceptional honors that no other officer received, by letting Xiahou ride in the same carriage and allowing Xiahou to enter Cao Cao&#x27;s private quarters. At the time, Emperor Xian had made Cao Cao a vassal king under the title &quot;King of Wei&quot; () and granted him permission to set up an independent vassal kingdom, which was still nominally under Han imperial control. While many of Cao Cao&#x27;s subordinates had been appointed to positions in his vassal kingdom, Xiahou Dun still held appointments under the Han central government. Xiahou Dun requested to serve in Cao Cao&#x27;s vassal kingdom to show his loyalty, but Cao Cao told him, &quot;I heard that the best rulers learn from their subjects while the second best befriend their subjects. Officials are noble men of virtue. Why lower yourself to serve such a small kingdom like Wei?&quot; Xiahou Dun insisted, so Cao Cao appointed him as General of the Vanguard (). Xiahou Dun then returned soldiers to Shouchun () and later garrisoned at Zhaoling ().

Around late 219, Xiahou Dun, along with Chen Qun, Huan Jie and others, urged Cao Cao to take the throne from Emperor Xian. Xiahou Dun said, &quot;Everyone in the Empire knows that the Han dynasty&#x27;s lifespan has come to an end and that there are many contenders seeking to replace it. Since ancient times, whoever succeeds in eliminating the people&#x27;s troubles will win the hearts of the people and become their ruler. As of now, Your Highness has been fighting battles for over 30 years, you&#x27;ve made outstanding achievements and the hearts of the people are with you. You should follow the will of Heaven and the people. What&#x27;s there to hesitate about?&quot; Cao Cao replied, &quot;&#x27;These qualities are displayed in government. This then also constitutes the exercise of government.&#x27; If the Mandate of Heaven does belong to me, I&#x27;ll be like King Wen of Zhou.&quot;

Cao Cao died in March 220 and passed on his vassal king title to his son, Cao Pi, who was still a nominal subject of Emperor Xian. Xiahou Dun was promoted to General-in-Chief () on 23 April. He died less than two months later on 13 June with Cao Pi leading the mourning ceremony at Ye&#x27;s east gate.

The &quot;Cao Man Zhuan&quot; () and the &quot;Shiyu&quot; () mentioned that Xiahou Dun once suggested to Cao Cao to eliminate Liu Bei first in order to force Sun Quan to surrender of his own accord, and then follow in the footsteps of the mythological rulers Shun and Yu by making Emperor Xian voluntarily abdicate the throne to him. Cao Cao accepted his proposal. After Cao Cao&#x27;s death, Xiahou Dun regretted his words and fell sick and died. The historian Sun Sheng dismissed the &quot;Shiyu&quot; account as nonsense, saying that it did not match what was recorded in the main text of Xiahou Dun&#x27;s biography in the &quot;Sanguozhi&quot; – Xiahou Dun felt ashamed of serving under the Han imperial court so he requested to serve in Cao Cao&#x27;s vassal kingdom.

==Family==
In late 220, Cao Pi forced Emperor Xian to abdicate the throne in his favour and established the state of Cao Wei, marking the end of the Han dynasty and the start of the Three Kingdoms period.

Cao Pi granted Xiahou Dun the posthumous title &quot;Marquis Zhong&quot; (), which literally means &quot;loyal marquis&quot;. Xiahou Dun&#x27;s original marquis title, &quot;Marquis of Gao&#x27;an District&quot; (), was inherited by his son, Xiahou Chong (). Later, in recognition of Xiahou Dun&#x27;s past contributions, Cao Pi added 1,000 taxable households to Xiahou Chong&#x27;s marquisate and made each of Xiahou Dun&#x27;s seven sons and two grandsons a Secondary Marquis (). Cao Rui on 7 June 233 started sacrifices at the Ancestral Temple to a few select figures who had helped create a dynasty; Xiahou Dun was one of the three.

Xiahou Dun&#x27;s younger brother, Xiahou Lian (), was also enfeoffed as a marquis. Xiahou Dun&#x27;s second son, Xiahou Mao, married one of Cao Cao&#x27;s daughters, Princess Qinghe (), and held high-ranking positions in the Wei imperial court. Xiahou Dun also had two other sons—Xiahou Zizang () and Xiahou Zijiang ().

When Xiahou Chong died, his marquis title was inherited by his son, Xiahou Yu (). Xiahou Yu, in turn, was succeeded by his son Xiahou Shao (). According to the &quot;Jin Yang Qiu&quot; (), Xiahou Dun did not have any successor after his grandson, Xiahou Zuo (), died in 266. But the first Jin emperor Emperor Wu ordered that a kinsman be found to continue the line of such a distinguished servant in Cao Wei&#x27;s founding.

==Appraisal==
Although Xiahou Dun was often in the military, he ensured he had teachers come to help him study. He led a frugal and simple lifestyle and used his excess wealth to help the needy. He took from official treasuries (instead of directly from the common people) when he did not have enough money. He also did not own much property.

==&quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms In Plain Language&quot;==
In &quot;Records of the Three Kingdoms in Plain Language&quot;, published in the 13th century, as part of a series of historical fiction, he serves as a brave warrior who is prone to being lured into fake retreat duels. Xiahou first appears when Zhang Fei arrives in Cao Cao&#x27;s camp, for the second time, seeking help against Lü Bu. Xiahou Dun calls out to Zhang Fei and was delighted to get a meeting, and was appointed vanguard. Xiahou then duels Lü Bu, who faked defeat and when Xiahou Dun pursued, shot Xiahou Dun in the left eye. Dismounting, Xiahou Dun pulled out the arrow with the famous line, held the eye in his mouth and returns to fighting an astonished Lü Bu, who is forced to retreat.

Xiahou Dun survived longer in this work than he did historically. In Zhuge Liang&#x27;s first northern campaign, Xiahou Dun held the key pass at Jieting and heard Jiang Wei had placed his camp in a dangerous position. Only worried about Zhuge Liang, he considered Jiang Wei a stupid little boy and launched a surprise attack at night, only to fall into an ambush led by Wei Yan; Xiahou Dun fled with Jieting lost. At Chang&#x27;an, he informed Emperor Cao Fang, who would then appoint Sima Yi to oppose Zhuge Liang.

==In &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;==

Xiahou Dun is featured as a character in the 14th-century historical novel &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot;, which romanticises the historical events before and during the Three Kingdoms period.

See the following for some fictitious stories in &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; involving Xiahou Dun:
* Battle of Xiapi#Xiahou Dun losing his left eye
* Battle of Bowang#In fiction

==In popular culture==
In Chinese plays called &quot;zaju&quot;, Xiahou Dun is often assigned the role of the clown to be defeated by Shu heroes, be it Zhuge Liang at Bowang or being shown up by Guan Yu at Boma. In the 15th century play by Ming Prince Zhu Youdun called Guan Yunchangs&#x27;s (Guan Yu&#x27;s style name) &quot;Righteous and Brave Refusal of Gold&quot;, Xiahou Dun&#x27;s introduction is boasting he has never been victorious, scared when facing fortifications, he fears the blade and runs from arrows. Blinded in Xu, left leg crippled by Zhang Liao at Puyang, he fears for more injury. He panics on hearing of Yan Liang&#x27;s challenge to battle, dismisses Yan Liang for wearing so much armor when his troops use no weapons other than garlic, a word play on plans, having misunderstood the &quot;Art of War&quot;. Defeated in just a few bouts, he pleads for Guan Yu&#x27;s help, then claims the credit for the victory. He then slanders Guan Yu to Cao Cao in the hopes Guan Yu would be killed, warning Cao Cao Guan Yu will leave so should kill him, but Cao Cao ignores him. Then tries to claim credit with Guan Yu for the rewards. Ordered by Cao Cao to give the departing Guan Yu a banquet in the final act, ignores orders and tries to murder the sleeping, drunk Guan Yu. But Guan Yu awakes, terrifying the overpowered Xiahou Dun who is spared by Guan Yu.

Xiahou Dun is featured as a playable character in Koei&#x27;s &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; video game series, as well as &quot;Warriors Orochi&quot;, a crossover between &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; and &quot;Samurai Warriors&quot;. He also appears in all installments of Koei&#x27;s &quot;Romance of the Three Kingdoms&quot; strategy game series.

There is a card based on Xiahou Dun, called &quot;Xiahou Dun, the One-Eyed&quot;, in the &quot;Portal Three Kingdoms&quot; set of the &quot;&quot; collectible card game.

The anime &quot;Battle Vixens,&quot; &quot;Koihime Musō,&quot; and &quot;Yuyushiki&quot; also make references to Xiahou Dun, in which he is known by his Japanese name &quot;Kakōton&quot;.

Xiahou Dun also appears as a playable character in &quot;Total War: Three Kingdoms&quot;, and is prominently featured in the game as a general in the service of Cao Cao.

<text>Parental supervision (also adult supervision) is a parenting technique that involves looking after, or monitoring a child&#x27;s activities.

Young children are generally incapable of looking after themselves, and incompetent in making informed decisions for their own well-being. For this reason, they require supervision, or at least some guidance or advice by their parents or another adult &quot;in loco parentis&quot;.

== Physical supervision ==

The most basic form of parental supervision is required to keep children from hurting themselves or others; to keep them away from dangerous objects and situations. Small children require continual supervision and care; lack of this constitutes neglect. Some parents are not aware of the need to supervise children, from 1-18. Guidance is needed until the child is aged 25 when the judgment centers have matured. Judgment is needed in making decisions that affect life-and-death decisions.

The legality of the latchkey children&#x27;s &quot;alone time&quot; varies with country, state and local area. In most of the United States, state and local laws typically do not specify any particular age under 18 when a child can be legally left without supervision. However, some states do have specific age restrictions, for example: children under age of 8 yr/old cannot be left at home alone - in Georgia, Maryland, North Carolina; 9 yr/old - in North Dakota; 10 yr/old - in Oregon, Tennessee, Washington; 11 yr/old - in Michigan; 12 yr/old - in Colorado, Delaware, Kansas; 14 yr/old - in Illinois.

== Media supervision ==

In addition, some believe that children should be protected from violent or pornographic imagery. Some believe that children should be protected from information that challenges the value system that their local culture instills in them. Some jurisdictions enforce these restrictions with legislation.

Where the acceptable boundaries lie in this area is very much a matter of opinion, and a matter of controversy.

The arrival of the Internet has made uncensored access to information available to the home in a way that was previously impossible; for this reason, a number of parents choose to supervise the time that their children spend accessing the Internet. Others choose to use content-control software. Some others regard it as their duty to educate their children in how to use the Internet responsibly, without the need for censorship.

== Parenting Time Supervision ==

Based on issues of protection and safety, a judge may decide that in order for a child to have contact with a parent, a neutral third person must be present during any visitation. This type of third-person visitation arrangement is called Parenting Time Supervision. Supervised visitation allows parents in high conflict or high risk situations access to their children in a safe and supervised environment. The noncustodial parent has access to the child only when supervised by another adult. Supervised visitation is used to protect children from potentially dangerous situations while allowing parental access and providing support for the parent child relationship.

In most of the US states there is a law required that court-ordered parenting plans must set forth the &quot;minimum amount&quot; of parenting time and type of access (i.e. supervised/unsupervised) a non-custodial parent is entitled to have. According to the state laws and court guidelines, the Custody Supervisor cannot change the court order to make major modifications to the amount of parenting time and access, only the minor changes or clarification of parenting time/access schedules or conditions including vacation, holidays, and temporary variation from the existing parenting plan are allowed.

<text>Violent is a song by New Zealand pop rock band Stellar*, released as the third single from their debut album, &quot;Mix&quot; (1999), in July 1999. The single spent six weeks within the top 20 of New Zealand&#x27;s RIANZ Singles Chart, peaking at number 11, and won the Single of the Year award at the 2000 New Zealand &quot;Tui&quot; Music Awards. The music video to the song depicts the band playing within a small room, amongst other scenes such as one in which Boh Runga plays the role of a nurse in surgery.

==Background==
According to band member Andrew Maclaren, &quot;Violent&quot; was the song that took Stellar* the longest amount of time to record, as they did not want to finish it until they were all satisfied with the results. A pop rock song, &quot;Violent&quot; was sent to New Zealand radio in late June 1999 and was released as a CD single on 19 July 1999.

<text>In marketing, corporate branding refers to the practice of promoting the brand name of a corporate entity, as opposed to specific products or services. The activities and thinking that go into corporate branding are different from product and service branding because the scope of a corporate brand is typically much broader. Although corporate branding is a distinct activity from product or service branding, these different forms of branding can, and often do, take place side-by-side within a given corporation. The ways in which corporate brands and other brands interact is known as the corporate brand architecture.

Corporate branding affects multiple stakeholders (e.g., employees, investors) and impacts many aspects of companies such as the evaluation of their product and services, corporate identity and culture, sponsorship, employment applications, and brand extensions (see study Fetscherin and Usunier, 2012). It therefore can result in significant economies of scope since one advertising campaign can be used for several products. It also facilitates new product acceptance because potential buyers are already familiar with the name. However, this strategy may hinder the creation of distinct brand images or identities for different products: an overarching corporate brand reduces the ability to position a brand with an individual identity, and may conceal different products&#x27; unique characteristics.

Corporate branding is not limited to a specific mark or name. Branding can incorporate multiple touchpoints. These touchpoints include; logo, customer service, treatment and training of employees, packaging, advertising, stationery, and quality of products and services. Any means by which the general public comes into contact with a specific brand constitutes a touchpoint that can affect perceptions of the corporate brand. Corporate branding can also be viewed from several approaches, including critical perspectives.

It has been argued that successful corporate branding often stems from a strong coherence between what the company&#x27;s top management seek to accomplish (their strategic vision), what the company&#x27;s employees know and believe (lodged in its organizational culture), and how its external stakeholders perceived the company (their image of it). Misalignments between these three factors, may indicate an underperforming corporate brand. This type of corporate brand analysis has been labeled the Vision-Culture-Image (VCI) Alignment Model.

Changes in stakeholder expectations are causing an increasing number of corporations to integrate marketing, communications and corporate social responsibility into corporate branding. This trend is evident in campaigns such as IBM Smarter Planet, G.E. Ecomagination, The Coca-Cola Company Live Positively, and DOW Human Element. As never before, people care about the corporation behind the product. They do not separate their opinions about the company from their opinions of that company&#x27;s products or services. This blending of corporate and product/service opinions is due to increasing corporate transparency, which gives stakeholders a deeper, clearer view into a corporation&#x27;s actual behavior and actual performance. Transparency is, in part, a byproduct of the digital revolution, which has enabled stakeholders—employees, retirees, customers, business partners, supply chain partners, investors, neighbors—with the ability to share opinion about corporations via social media.

<doc id="240683" wikidata="Q3112663" url="?curid=240683" title="Caretaker government">
<text>A caretaker government, also known as a caretaker regime, is a temporary &quot;ad hoc&quot; government that performs some governmental duties and functions in a country until a regular government is elected or formed. Depending on specific practice, it consists of either randomly selected members of parliament or outgoing members until their dismissal.

Caretaker governments in representative democracies are usually limited in their function, serving only to maintain the &quot;status quo&quot;, rather than truly govern and propose new legislation. Unlike the government it is meant to temporarily replace, a caretaker government does not have a legitimate mandate (electoral approval) to exercise aforementioned functions.

== Definition ==
Caretaker governments may be put in place when a government in a parliamentary system is defeated in a motion of no confidence, or in the case when the house to which the government is responsible is dissolved, to be in place for an interim period until an election is held and a new government is formed. In this sense, in some countries which use a Westminster system of government, the caretaker government is simply the incumbent government, which continues to operate in the interim period between the normal dissolution of parliament for the purpose of holding an election and the formation of a new government after the election results are known. Unlike in ordinary times, the caretaker government&#x27;s activities are limited by custom and convention.

In systems where coalition governments are frequent a caretaker government may be installed temporarily while negotiations to form a new coalition take place. This usually occurs either immediately after an election in which there is no clear victor or if one coalition government collapses and a new one must be negotiated. Caretaker governments are expected to handle daily issues and prepare budgets for discussion, but are not expected to produce a government platform or introduce controversial bills.

A caretaker government is often set up following a war until stable democratic rule can be restored, or installed, in which case it is often referred to as a provisional government.

==Caretaker governments associated with elections==
Many countries are administered by a caretaker government during election periods, such as:
*Caretaker government of Australia
*Caretaker government of Bangladesh
*Caretaker government of Canada
*Demissionary cabinet, a Dutch caretaker cabinet
*Caretaker government of Malaysia
*Caretaker government of Pakistan
Other countries that use similar mechanisms include Canada, and New Zealand.

==Caretaker governments associated with wars or new regimes==
==Caretakers==
Heads of caretaker governments are often referred to as a &quot;caretaker&quot; head, for example &quot;caretaker prime minister&quot;.

Similarly, but chiefly in the United States, caretakers are individuals who fill seats in government temporarily without ambitions to continue to hold office on their own. This is particularly true with regard to United States senators who are appointed to office by the governor of their state following a vacancy created by the death or resignation of a sitting senator. Sometimes governors wish to run for the seat themselves in the next election but do not want to be accused of unfairness by arranging their own appointments in the interim. Also, sometimes they do not wish to be seen as taking sides within a group of party factions or prejudicing of a primary election by picking someone who is apt to become an active candidate for the position.

In some cases, appointment of a caretaker is an opportunity for a Governor to appoint a chief of staff, party leader, counsel, or other senior adviser to the position, as a reward for service or to boost their résumé. Examples include Ann Richards appointing Bob Krueger, Deval Patrick appointing Paul G. Kirk, Chris Christie appointing Jeffrey Chiesa, and Phil Murphy appointing George Helmy as Senators, the latter two from New Jersey.

At one time, widows of politicians were often selected as caretakers to succeed their late husbands; in a phenomenon known as &quot;widow’s succession.&quot; At the beginning of the 20th century, it was one of the most effective ways of getting women into Congress, even though the widow may have originally only been supposed to act as a placeholder for her dead husband and was only expected to serve for a brief period. The widows may have been selected to honor the deceased member, tap voters’ sympathy, or exploit name recognition to hold onto a seat while more conventional candidates prepared for the real campaign. It also may have helped some of the women grieve and make up for the sudden loss of income in a world where few worked outside the home. Among first-time candidates for the US House of Representatives from 1916 to 1993, 84% of the widows won, while only 14% of other women were victorious. The trend was strongest when women were rarer in politics; 35 of the 95 women who served in Congress through 1976 were congressional wives first. Political scientist Diane Kincaid wrote that &quot;statistically, at least, for women aspiring to serve in Congress, the best husband has been a dead husband.&quot; Academics Lisa Solowiej and Thomas L. Brunell called it &quot;arguably the single most important historical method for women to enter Congress.&quot;

Nevertheless, this custom is rarely exercised today, as it could be viewed by some as nepotism.

In Canada and most other English-speaking countries, the more widely accepted term in this context is &quot;interim&quot;, as in interim leader. In Italy, this kind of premier is the President of Government of Experts.
