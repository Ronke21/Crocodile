<text>A voicemail system (also known as voice message or voice bank) is a computer-based system that allows callers to leave a recorded message when the recipient has been unable or unwilling to answer the phone. Calls may be diverted to voicemail manually or automatically. The caller is prompted to leave a message and the recipient can retrieve the message at a later time.

Voicemail can be used for personal calls and more complex systems exist for companies and services to handle customer requests. The term is also used more broadly to denote any system of conveying stored telecommunications voice messages, including using an answering machine.

== Features ==
Voicemail systems are designed to convey a caller&#x27;s recorded audio message to a recipient. To do so they contain a user interface to select, play, and manage messages; a delivery method to either play or otherwise deliver the message; and a notification ability to inform the user of a waiting message. Most systems use phone networks, either cellular- or landline-based, as the conduit for all of these functions. Some systems may use multiple telecommunications methods, permitting recipients and callers to retrieve or leave messages through multiple methods such as PCs or smartphones.

Simple voicemail systems function as a remote answering machine using touch-tones as the user interface. More complicated systems may use other input devices such as voice or a computer interface. Simpler voicemail systems may play the audio message through the phone, while more advanced systems may have alternative delivery methods, including email or text message delivery, message transfer and forwarding options, and multiple mailboxes.

Almost all modern voicemail systems use digital storage and are typically stored on computer data storage. Notification methods also vary based on the voicemail system. Simple systems may not provide active notification at all, instead requiring the recipient to check with the system, while others may provide an indication that messages are waiting.

More advanced systems may be integrated with a company&#x27;s Private Automated Branch Exchange (PABX), with a call center ACD for automatic call distribution; with mobile or paging terminals for message alert; and computer systems/data bases for delivering information or processing orders. Interactive voice response (IVR) systems may use digital information stored in a corporate data base to select pre-recorded words and phrases stored in a voicemail vocabulary to form sentences that are delivered to the caller.

==History==
The term &quot;Voicemail&quot; was coined by Televoice International (later Voicemail International, or VMI) for their introduction of the first US-wide Voicemail service in 1980. Although VMI trademarked the term, it eventually became a generic term for automated voice services employing a telephone. Voicemail popularity continues today with Internet telephone services such as Skype, Google Voice and ATT that integrate voice, voicemail and text services for tablets and smartphones.

Voicemail systems were developed in the late 1970s by Voice Message Exchange (VMX). They became popular in the early 1980s when they were made available on PC-based boards. In September 2012 a report from &quot;USA Today&quot; and Vonage claimed that voicemail was in decline. The report said that the number of voicemail messages declined eight percent compared to 2011.

=== Message centers ===

The conventional solution to efficient handling of telephone communication in businesses was the &quot;message center&quot;. A message center or &quot;message desk&quot; was a centralized, manual answering service inside a company staffed by a few operators who answered all incoming phone calls. Extensions that were busy or rang &quot;no answer&quot; would forward to the message center using a device called a &quot;call director&quot;. The call director had a button for each extension in the company which would flash when that person&#x27;s extension forwarded to the message center. A little label next to the button told the operator the person being called.

While it was an improvement over basic multi-line systems, the message center had many disadvantages. Many calls would come in simultaneously at peak periods, such as lunch time, and operators were often busy. This left message attendants with little time to take each message accurately. Often, they were not familiar with employees&#x27; names and &quot;buzzwords&quot; and how to spell or pronounce them. Messages were scribbled on pink slips and distributed by the internal mail system and messages, often arrived at people&#x27;s desks after lengthy delays, contained little content other than the caller&#x27;s name and number, and were often inaccurate, with misspelled names and wrong phone numbers.

Tape-based telephone answering machines had come into the residential telephone market, but they were not used much in the corporate environment due to physical limitations of the technology. One answering machine was needed for each telephone; messages could not be recorded if the user was using the phone; messages had to be retrieved in sequential order; and messages could not be retrieved remotely, selectively discarded, saved, or forwarded to others. Further, the manufacturers of PBXs (private branch exchanges—the name for corporate phone systems) used proprietary digital phone sets in order to increase the functionality and value of the PBX. These phone sets were, by design, incompatible with answering machines.

In the 1970s and early 1980s, the cost of long-distance calling decreased and more business communications were conducted by telephone. As corporations grew and labor rates increased, the ratio of secretaries to employees decreased. With more communication by phone, multiple time zones, and fewer secretaries, real-time phone communications were hampered by callers being unable to reach people. Some early studies showed that only 1 in 4 phone calls resulted in a completed call and half the calls were one-way in nature (that is, they did not require a conversation). This happened because people were either not at work (due to time zone differences, being away on business, etc.), or if they were at work, they were on the phone, away from their desks in meetings, on breaks, etc. This bottleneck hindered the effectiveness of business activities and decreased both individual and group productivity. It also wasted the caller&#x27;s time and created delays in resolving time-critical issues.

=== Invention ===
The first public records describing voice recording were reported in a New York newspaper and the Scientific American in November 1877. Thomas A. Edison had announced the invention of his &quot;phonograph&quot; saying &quot;the object was to record telephone messages and transmit them again by telephone.&quot; Edison applied for a US patent in December 1877 and shortly thereafter demonstrated the machine to publishers, the US Congress and President Rutherford B. Hayes. In an article outlining his own ideas of the future usefulness of his machine Edison&#x27;s list began with &quot;Letter writing, and all kinds of dictation without the aid of a stenographer.&quot; In other words, &quot;voice messages&quot; or &quot;Voice-mail&quot;. By 1914, Edison&#x27;s phonograph business included a dictating machine (the Ediphone) and the &quot;Telescribe&quot;, a machine combining the phonograph and the telephone, which recorded both sides of telephone conversations.

For nearly one hundred years, there were few innovations or advances in telephone services. Voicemail was the result of innovations in telephone products and services made possible by developments in computer technology during the 1970s. These innovations began with the Motorola Pageboy, a simple &quot;pager&quot; or &quot;beeper&quot; introduced in 1974 that was generally offered in conjunction with answering services that handled busy / no-answer overloads and after hours calls for businesses and professionals. Operators wrote down a caller&#x27;s message, sent a page alert or &quot;beep&quot; and when the party called back, an operator dictated the message.

With the introduction of &quot;voice&quot; pagers, like the Motorola Pageboy II operators could transmit a voice message directly to the pager and the user could hear the message. However, messages arrival was often untimely and privacy issues, as well as the high cost, eventually caused the demise of these services. By the mid 1970s digital storage and analog to digital conversion devices had emerged and paging companies began handling client messages electronically. Operators recorded a short message (five to six seconds, e.g. &quot;please call Mr. Smith&quot;) and the messages were delivered automatically when the client called the answering service. It would only take a short step for the first voicemail application to be born.

Computer manufacturers, telephone equipment manufacturers, and software firms began developing more sophisticated solutions as more powerful and less expensive computer processors and storage devices became available. This set the stage for a creation of a broad spectrum of computer based Central Office and Customer Premises Equipment that would eventually support enhanced voice solutions such as voicemail, audiotex, interactive voice response (IVR) and speech recognition solutions that began emerging in the 1980s. However, broad adoption of these products and services would depend on the global proliferation of touch tone phones and mobile phone services which would not occur until the late 1980s.

==== Inventor controversy ====
Many contributed to the creation of the modern-day voicemail. Legal battles ensued for decades. The of voicemail, patent number 4,124,773 (Audio Storage and Distribution System), is Robin Elkins. &quot;Though Elkins received a patent in 1978, telecommunications giants began offering voicemail without paying Elkins a penny in royalties.&quot; &quot;Elkins never expected to spend 10 years of his life battling some of the world&#x27;s largest corporations, either. But once he patented his system, he figured he should protect it.&quot; Later, Elkins successfully licensed his patented technology to IBM, DEC, and WANG, among many others. Unfortunately, his patent did not address simultaneity of voice message access and storage and the application for patent was filed after the patent application of the system patented by Kolodny and Hughes, as described below.

=== Early applications ===
One of the first modern day voicemail applications was invented by Gerald M. Kolodny and Paul Hughes, which was described in an article in the medical journal, Radiology (Kolodny GM, Cohen HI, Kalisky A. Rapid-access system for radiology reports: a new concept. Radiology. 1974;111(3):717–9) A patent was applied for by Kolodny and Hughes in 1975, prior to the patent applications of both Elkins and Matthews and was issued in 1981 (US patent 4,260,854). The patent was assigned to Sudbury Systems of Sudbury Massachusetts who proceeded to market and sell such systems to corporations and hospitals. IBM, Sony and Lanier, as well as several smaller makers of voicemail systems, licensed the Sudbury patent for their voicemail systems. A patent suit, brought by Pitney Bowes, claiming prior art to the Sudbury patent, was denied by the US District Court, District of Connecticut on November 8, 2000. A similar suit brought byVDI Technologies against the Kolodny and Hughes patent claiming prior art was dismissed by the US District Court in New Hampshire on December 19, 1991.

==== IBM Audio Distribution System ====
The voice-messaging application, the Speech Filing System, was developed at the IBM Thomas J. Watson Research Center in 1973 under the leadership of Stephen Boies. It was later renamed the Audio Distribution System (ADS).

ADS used the human voice and the fixed-line touch-tone telephones that predated computer screens and mobile phones. The first operational prototypes were used by 750 IBM executives mainly in the US for their daily work. Those prototypes ran on an IBM System/7 computer attached to an IBM VM370 for additional storage.

In 1978 the prototype was converted to run on an IBM Series/1 computer. In September 1981 IBM started marketing ADS in America and Europe: the first customer installation was completed in February 1982.

ADS, marketed by IBM and briefly by AT&amp;T Corporation, was well featured for voice messaging, the result of IBM&#x27;s considerable human-factors research plus observation of operational use. Using a 1980s computer requiring air conditioning, it was expensive and physically large. With further development it grew to handle up to 3000 users, 100 hours of messages, multiple languages, message notification to a host computer, and 16 simultaneous users.

ADS could be connected to exchange lines and private exchanges including the IBM 2750 and 3750 Switching Systems available in Germany, France, Italy, Belgium, and the UK.

IBM sold many systems, Installations including the 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Games &quot;Olympic Message System&quot; 

==== Delta 1 ====
Another company, Delphi Communications of California, deserves some partial credit for invention of voicemail. Delphi developed a proprietary system called &quot;Delta 1&quot; that picked up and coming calls directly from the telephone company. Delphi presented the concept publicly to the association of Telephone Answering Services around 1973 and the prototype system was launched in San Francisco in 1976 by a Delphi company called VoiceBank. A patent was applied for and issued for Delphi&#x27;s Automated Telephone Voice Service System. The patent, US Patent No. 4,625,081, was issued after Delphi&#x27;s closure, but Delphi&#x27;s assets (and the patent) were transferred to another Exxon company, Gilbarco, which made equipment for gas pumps at filling stations. Gilbarco is now owned by GEC in the United Kingdom.

==== AT&amp;T ====
AT&amp;T developed a system called 1A Voice Storage System to support custom services including voicemail for the public telephone system. It worked in conjunction with the companies 1A ESS and 5ESS systems. Development started in mid-1976, with first deployment in early 1979. Friendly user service started in March 1980. The service was terminated in 1981 as a result of the US FCC Computer Inquiry II, which prohibited enhanced services from being provided by the regulated network.

==== VMX ====
In 1979, a company was founded in Texas by Gordon Matthews called ECS Communications (the name was later changed to VMX, for Voice Message exchange). VMX developed a 3000-user voice messaging system called the VMX/64. Matthews, a prolific entrepreneur and patentor, applied for and was granted a patent on voicemail (patent number 4,371,752) which issued in February 1983. The patent was promoted as the pioneering patent for voicemail. However, the patent application was filed on November 26, 1979, five years after, and issued in 1983.

VMX asserted infringement first with IBM, AT&amp;T and then Wang, but all three companies reportedly would have been able to invalidate the patent on the basis of prior art and their licenses from Sudbury Systems Inc, for their Kolodny and Hughes patent.

==== IVR Voice Recognition ====
In 1985, Voice Response Inc. (formerly Call-It Co) a subsidiary of Lee Enterprises, Davenport IA, entered the fast-growing Interactive Voice (IVR) response market under the direction of Bob Ross, President. About a year later, VRI introduced one of the first &quot;successful&quot; IVR applications that utilized voice recognition (rather than touch tone) to capture caller responses. Voice recognition technology had great difficulty with regional and ethnic differences and nuances which resulted in a high incidence of error. VRI discovered that hesitation (delayed response) signaled caller confusion or misunderstanding which often resulted in an inaccurate response. VRI developed proprietary techniques that measured user response times and used the data to make real-time changes to the application&#x27;s dialog with the caller. VRI found that the confidence level of a &quot;suspect&quot; caller response could be increased by asking &quot;Did you say (Chicago), Yes or No&quot;, a standard question heard in order taking or reservation making IVR applications today. VRI pioneering applications, including subscription fulfillment for &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Life&quot; magazines, proved faster and less expensive than call centers using live operators and although VRI did not survive, their voice recognition processes became industry standards and VRI&#x27;s patent USPTO – patent RE34,587 was eventually licensed by Intel/Dialogic and Nuance.

==== PC-based Voicemail ====
Amidst the booming popularity of the IBM PC-AT, a variety of companies popped up to market add-in boards to the AT. These companies aimed to use the PC as an inexpensive hardware platform for hosting add-in boards and software providing voice mail functionality for small businesses that wanted something more sophisticated than an answering machine but could not afford pricey conventional voice mail solutions. Among these was The Complete PC, founded in 1986 in Silicon Valley. The Complete PC was sold to publicly-listed Florida-based Boca Research Inc., in 1993.

==International Voicemail Association==
In 1987, voicemail service providers in the US and Europe joined to form the Voice Mail Association of Europe (VMA) with René Beusch, Radio-Suisse and Paul Finnigan, Finnigan USA serving as VMA Chairman and President respectively. The first VMA meeting was held in Stockholm Huddinge by Voicemail Svenska AB in 1987, organized by its founder Lars Olof Kanngard. The tech team in Voicemail Svenska AB was granted the right to port the Voicemail from PDP systems to their own PC-board solution, which become known as the MiniVoice, later become ESSELTE VOICE AB. The VMA invited service providers, vendors and consultants to attend semi-annual conferences that included presentations, discussions and reporting of experiences. VMA membership was eventually expanded to include representatives from telecommunication organizations worldwide and became &quot;The International Voice-mail Association&quot;. By the late 1980s, the Bell Operating companies, Tigon and other independent service providers in the US had joined the VMA. In 1992, VMA members conducted an &quot;Information Week Tour of the U.S.&quot;, sharing ideas with major telecom operators. VMA working groups promoted collaboration and adoption of industry standards to the ITU and CCITT and at the 1999 CCITT conference in Geneva, Switzerland, demonstrated worldwide exchange of messages between the major voicemail vendors&#x27; platforms using the VPIM networking standard. Beusch and Finnigan led the VMA until 1998 and 1999 respectively and the organization continues to serve the voice services industry today.

==Public telephone services==

In the US, the Bell Operating Companies and their cellular divisions had been prohibited by the FCC from offering voicemail and other enhanced services such as paging and telephone answering services (no such prohibition existed in foreign countries). A ruling by Judge Harold H. Greene on March 7, 1988, removed this barrier and allowed the BOCs to offer voicemail service, however, they were not allowed to design or manufacture equipment used to provide voicemail services.

The opportunity created by the Greene decision, plus Voicemail International&#x27;s abandonment of its market lead for carrier-grade systems, created a new opportunity for competing manufacturers and those who had been focusing on the corporate market. Unisys, Boston Technology, and Comverse Technology were quick to address the BOC and PTT marketplace. Octel, who had high capacity systems in use internally by all seven Regional Bell Operating companies, launched a new generation of its large system specifically designed for carriers and was compliant with &quot;NEBS standards&quot;, the tight standard required by phone companies for any equipment located in their central offices.

==Unified messaging==

Unified Messaging integrated voicemail into Microsoft Exchange, the corporate email system made by Microsoft. Unified Messaging had been invented by Roberta Cohen, Kenneth Huber and Deborah Mill at AT&amp;T Bell Labs. The patent for Unified Messaging was received in June 1989 (Patent number 4,837,798).

Unified Messaging allowed users to access voicemail and email messages using either the graphical user interface (GUI) on their PC, or using the telephone user interface (TUI). For voicemail, they&#x27;d see the &quot;header information&quot; (sender, date sent, size, and subject). Users could double-click a voicemail from their email inbox and hear the message through their PC or a phone next to their desk. Voice messages could be sent using email or telephone addressing schemes, and the data networking infrastructure was used to send messages between locations rather than the public switched telephone network.

==Virtual telephony==

Other interesting markets developed from the carrier market including a concept called &quot;virtual telephony&quot;. Virtual Telephony, developed by Octel, used voicemail to provide phone service rapidly in emerging countries without wiring for telephones. The problem this solved was that emerging countries did not have many telephones. Wiring for telephones was very expensive, and many poorer citizens did not have homes to wire. The economies of emerging countries were held back partly because people could not communicate beyond the area where they could walk or ride a bicycle. Giving them phones was one way to help their economies, but there was not a practical way to do it. In some countries, the wait for a phone was several years and the cost was in the thousands of dollars. Cellular phones were not an option at the time because they were extremely expensive (thousands of dollars per handset) and the infrastructure to install cell sites was also costly.

With virtual telephony, each person could be given a phone number (just the number, not the phone) and a voice mailbox. The citizen would also be given a pager. If someone called the phone number, it never rang on an actual phone, but would be routed immediately to a central voicemail system. The voicemail system answered the call and the caller could leave a long, detailed message. As soon as the message was received, the voicemail system would trigger the citizen&#x27;s pager. When the page was received, the citizen would find a pay phone and call in to pick up the message. This concept was used successfully in South America and South Africa.

==Instant messaging in voice==

By the year 2000, voicemail had become a ubiquitous feature on phone systems serving companies, cellular and residential subscribers. Cellular and residential voicemail continue today in their previous form, primarily simple telephone answering. Email became the prevalent messaging system, email servers and software became quite reliable, and virtually all office workers were equipped with multimedia desktop PCs.

The increase in wireless mobility, originally through cellular services and today through IP-based Wi-Fi, was also a driver for messaging convergence with mobile telephony. Today, it is not only fostering the use of speech user interfaces for message management, but increasing the demand for retrieval of voice messages integrated with email. It also enables people to reply to both voice and email messages in voice rather than text. New services, such as GotVoice, SpinVox and YouMail, are helping to blur the boundaries between voicemail and text by delivering voicemails to mobile phones as SMS text messages.

The next development in messaging was in making text messaging real-time, rather than just asynchronous store-and-forward delivery into a mailbox. Although in the 1980s Minitel in France was extremely popular and Teletext was widely used in the US, instant messaging on the Internet began with the ICQ application developed in 1996 as a public Internet-based free text &quot;chat&quot; service for consumers, but soon was being used by business people as well. It introduced the concept of Internet Protocol &quot;presence management&quot; or being able to detect device connectivity to the Internet and contact recipient &quot;availability&quot; status to exchange real-time messages, as well as personalized &quot;Buddy list&quot; directories to allow only people you knew to find out your status and initiate a real-time text messaging exchange with you. Presence and Instant Messaging has since evolved into more than short text messages, but now can include the exchange of data files (documents, pictures) and the escalation of the contact into a voice conversational connection.

==Unified messaging with VoIP==

Corporate voicemail did not change much until the advent of Voice over IP (VoIP—voice being transmitted over the internet) and the development of Internet Protocol (IP) telephony applications to replace legacy PBX telephony (called TDM technologies). IP telephony changed the style and technology of PBXs and the way voicemail systems integrated with them. This, in turn, facilitated a new generation of Unified Messaging, which is now likely to catch on widely. The flexibility, manageability, lower costs, reliability, speed, and user convenience for messaging convergence is now possible where it was not before. This might include intra- and inter-enterprise contacts, mobile contacts, proactive application information delivery, and customer contact applications.

The corporate IP telephony-based voicemail customer premises equipment market is served by several vendors including Avaya, Cisco systems, Adomo, Interactive Intelligence, Nortel, Mitel, 3Com, and AVST. Their marketing strategy will have to address the need to support a variety of legacy PBXs as well as new Voice over IP as enterprises migrate towards converging IP-based telecommunications. A similar situation exists for the carrier market for voicemail servers, currently dominated by Comverse Technology, with some share still held by Lucent Technologies.

VoIP telephony enables centralized, shared servers, with remote administration and usage management for corporate (enterprise) customers. In the past, carriers lost this business because it was far too expensive and inflexible to have remote managed facilities by the phone company. With VoIP, remote administration is far more economical. This technology has re-opened opportunities for carriers to offer hosted, shared services for all forms of converged IP telecommunications, including IP-PBX and voicemail services. Because of the convergence of wired and wireless communications, such services may also include support of a variety of multi-modal handheld and desktop end user devices. This service, when offered for multiple extensions or phone numbers is sometimes also called Unified Voice-mail.

==Benefits==

Voicemail&#x27;s introduction enabled people to leave lengthy, secure and detailed messages in natural voice, working hand-in-hand with corporate phone systems. The adoption of voicemail in corporations improved the flow of communications and saved huge amounts of money. GE, one of the pioneer adopters of voicemail in all of its offices around the world, claimed that voicemail saved, on average, over US$1,100 per year per employee. Needless to say, the ability to tell someone something without talking to them, can be a powerful reason to choose voicemail for delivery of a particular message.

<doc id="254877" wikidata="Q6509755" url="?curid=254877" title="Minnie the Minx">
<text>Minnie the Minx, is a comic strip character published in the British comic magazine &quot;The Beano&quot;. Created and originally drawn by Leo Baxendale, she first appeared in issue 596, dated 19 December 1953, making her the third longest running Beano character behind Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger. She would later be drawn by Jim Petrie, Tom Paterson, Ken Harrison and Laura Howell. She would also appear in animated films.

Minnie is depicted as a tomboy, with a real name of Hermione Makepeace

Like Desperate Dan from &quot;The Dandy&quot;, she has a statue in Dundee. In 2021, Minnie the Minx featured on a commemorative UK postage stamp issued by the Royal Mail to mark 70 years of Dennis the Menace.

==Character history==

===Leo Baxendale strips (1953–1962)===
Minnie the Minx, created and drawn by Leo Baxendale, first appeared in &quot;The Beano&quot; in December 1953. Her first strip introduced her as &quot;wild as wild can be&quot; and showed her exasperated mother attempting to get her to be more creative rather than fight. Taking a book, Minnie then proceeds to beat her classmates during a revenge scheme using the scrapbook as a weapon. The closing panel shows her thanking her mother for the scrapbook stating she has &quot;won nine scraps with it.&quot; Most of Minnie&#x27;s earlier strips consisted of six-panel boxes; however, as her popularity grew, it quickly became more plausible to give Minnie her own full page with added colour. This introduced her trademark flaming red hair and red and black jersey. Like many other &quot;Beano&quot; stars at the time, many of her later strips showed Minnie to get her comeuppance towards the end be it a cane, slipper or simply a case of karma. Minnie also appeared alongside Dennis the Menace in his own strip in the edition of 23 January 1954 of The Beano. In the strip, she swapped toys with Dennis for the day as she received his trusty catapult and he proceeded to &#x27;menace&#x27; with her doll&#x27;s pram. In the end, she got out of trouble scot free whilst Dennis had to suffer for all her minxing. It was possibly this that began their future eternal rivalry.

===Jim Petrie strips (1962–2001)===

In 1962, when Baxendale left D.C. Thomson, a new artist was taken on to continue Minnie&#x27;s adventures. Young art teacher Jim Petrie was given the opportunity. His first strip, coincidentally, started similarly to Baxendale&#x27;s in that Minnie is seen being asked by her mother to read rather than minx. Much to her mother&#x27;s dismay, Minnie&#x27;s chosen book influences her to take up red Indian traditions in which she gets up to much mischief. In the end, however, after aggravating a sleeping bull, Minnie is caught by a farmer and taken home to be slippered by her father. Despite the pain, it appears Minnie still attempts to ensure to the public that she is still an Indian stating her name is &#x27;Minnie – Ha!&#x27;. She appeared once again alongside Dennis in issue 1894, in which she states that Dennis&#x27; famous jersey is actually her trademark, so he has no right to call them &#x27;Dennis Jerseys&#x27;.

&quot;The Beano&quot;″s 50th Anniversary issue in 1988 was significant, as an increase in the number of colour pages in the comic led to Minnie appearing in full colour for the first time. In the strip itself, Minnie dressed up as Pansy Potter in compliance with the editor&#x27;s wishes. Throughout the strip she attempts impossible feats in hope to appear just like Pansy. This even consists of attempting to sink war submarines, something the old character used to do during The Beano&#x27;s war times. Despite the fact she is weaker than Pansy, Minnie does manage to withhold four sailors before they finally manage to catch her and tie her up leaving her before her father. However, previously she had filled her father&#x27;s jumper with balloons and using Pansy&#x27;s unique hairstyle, manages to burst the balloons causing her father to flee home in the nude, the thought of punishing his daughter forgotten.

Minnie also made a cameo in the 1992 &quot;Beano Annual&quot; story, &quot;Dennis Through The Beano Book&quot;, in which she played the Queen of Hearts. She has also been the star of several Beanotown pantomimes, playing the role of Cinderella in each.

With the turn of the new century, Minnie was featured in a feature-length strip alongside Dennis the Menace, Roger the Dodger and The Bash Street Kids. The plot revolved around treasure which was apparently buried sometime near the end of the 19th century. Minnie was called over to Dennis&#x27; house by Roger who had gained a copy of the Treasure Map due to Smiffy, the dipsy member of The Bash Street Kids, leaving the original in the photocopier machine in Beanotown Library. Upon finding out The Bash Street Kids were also hunting for the treasure, the trio followed them to London. Once the mystery had unfolded that the treasure was buried deep in the Millennium Dome, the Bash Street Kids instantly found it and celebrated their victory. However, Dennis attempts to intimidate the treasure off Fatty but he quickly flattened leaving Minnie and Roger to chase after Danny, who had just run off with the treasure. Finding him hiding in a storage cupboard, Roger forms a plan to get Danny to duel with Dennis for the treasure. Whilst all seems fair at first, it is quickly discovered that the three menaces had no intent on fair play when it comes to treasure and it is revealed that Roger had in fact tied Danny&#x27;s catapult to a piece of string, thus yanking it away at a pinnacle moment. Appearing to have won, the trio leave a humiliated Danny and head home. However, a plot quickly unravels that Roger wasn&#x27;t the only one who was intent on unfair play. Danny had switched the treasure with pebbles whilst he was hiding in the storage cupboard. Alongside Dennis, Minnie chased Roger through the streets of Beanotown, giving Danny the opportunity to switch the treasure.

Minnie also attended Dennis the Menace&#x27;s 50th Birthday House Party. Like the other guests, Minnie bought Dennis a &quot;Beano Annual&quot; 2001. She participated in all menacing party games but, due to her friendship with Dennis, she was one of few to not get menaced. She can also be seen fighting in the final food fight and twirling her beret when the celebrities and Dandy characters arrive.

Petrie decided to retire, with his final strip appearing on 13 January 2001. The story consisted of Minnie meeting her former artist and bidding farewell. The strip was Petrie&#x27;s 2000th and last, a tally for one artist drawing the same strip in the Beano, only surpassed by David Sutherland on the Bash Street Kids.

===Tom Paterson strips (2001–2008)===

The following week, Calamity James artist Tom Paterson took over the strip, adding his own distinct trademarks and ideas on Minnie&#x27;s canon. In 2003, Brain Duane from The Dandy visited Beanotown and proceeded to mock Minnie for her lack of intelligence. Choosing brawn over brains and fuelled with jealousy over Duane&#x27;s new gadget-filled car, Minnie threatened Duane into making her a custom-built skateboard. The next week, after asking to meet Dennis she proceeds to minx him with her new weapon-filled vehicle. This causes Dennis to get his revenge the next week with his own Menace Buggy. It was revealed in succeeding issues that this, along with several other strips from around the same time, was a buildup to a brand new PC Game Beanotown Racing. She appeared as a playable character in the video game upon its release date in 2003.

Initially Paterson drew the vast majority of strips, with the occasional story drawn by Keith Reynolds, but, by 2003, other artists, such as Leslie Reavey, began to ghost the strip due to Tom Paterson&#x27;s workload. Through 2004 and 2005, ghosted strips became increasingly common, and eventually, in early 2006, Steve Horrocks took up the artistic duties. However, in the autumn of that year, Paterson returned to the strip, but in a different style, the most notable change being that Minnie&#x27;s Parents appeared to look very similar to those of Sweeney Toddler. The following year, Tom Paterson&#x27;s style changed again, and the changes made to her parents were largely reversed, although Minnie&#x27;s Dad&#x27;s moustache was still absent. In October 2007, Minnie&#x27;s jumper changed colour from her familiar black and red stripes to red and yellow, with her skirt also changing from black to blue. This style was also seen on the cover of the 1965 Beano book.

===Ken Harrison strips (2008–2012)===
By 2007, Minnie was struggling in the readers&#x27; poll and, in early 2008, several significant changes were made in response to this. Iain McLaughlin took over as writer and, in Beano issue 3422, dated 15 March 2008, former Desperate Dan artist Ken Harrison took over as the strip&#x27;s artist. Harrison re-introduced many aspects of Leo Baxendale&#x27;s original depiction of the character and reverted her jumper to its original colours. However, the style of writing changed, with McLaughlin placing greater emphasis on the relationship between Minnie and her Dad. Some minor changes were made to her appearances, with her standard brown or grey school shoes replaced with the more modern trainers. A new tagline was introduced, citing Minnie as the World&#x27;s Wildest Tom Boy, similar to Dennis the Menace&#x27;s original tagline of being the World&#x27;s Wildest Boy. Minnie&#x27;s Teacher also became a regular character during this time, and Minnie now attends what appears to be an all-girls school. The changes reinvigorated the strip as Minnie soon returned to a top four position in the poll.

Although Harrison has been the main artist throughout this time, when he has been unavailable to draw the strip, the main ghost artist has been Laura Howell. Since 2009, occasional Jim Petrie reprints have been used, particularly during the postal strikes in autumn 2009.

In the summer of 2010, Minnie began a quest for fame which received a lot of media attention in the UK. Cheryl Cole, who was spotted sporting a red and black dress in her music video, was featured as well as Wayne Rooney and Jamie Oliver. Each attempt landed Minnie in more trouble than the last so, in her final strip, she decided to give up the search for fame and instead continue her day-to-day minxing.

On 30 July 2011, Minnie and several of her Beano co-stars were a part of a UK advertising campaign for National Trust. This included a special of The Beano which included a comic strip of her and her father exploring Northern Ireland for Finn McCool and the Giant&#x27;s Causeway.

In November 2012, Minnie loses her second page as it is reserved for Funsize Funnies (Gnash Gnews, Little Plum, Winston and Rasher)

===Current Strips (2012–present)===
Ken Harrison drew his last Minnie the Minx strip in November 2012, drawing the first Minnie story reduced down to a single page. The week after, Nigel Parkinson took over and both wrote and drew the strip from then on. He confirmed that he was the new Minnie artist some months later, on his blog. For the 75th anniversary special, Minnie the Minx met Andy Murray in a tennis battle. Minnie also met Harry Hill, Jeremy Clarkson and Matt Smith (plus others) in the 2013 Comic Relief special. During Parkinson&#x27;s time he tried to surprise the readers by never following a script template and allowing Minnie&#x27;s character to dictate storylines. In 2013, Minnie stories went back up to two pages, with Nigel Parkinson and Paul Palmer and, later in 2015, Cavan Scott writing the scripts.

In 2018, as the Beano celebrated an eightieth anniversary, there was a collector&#x27;s edition magazine- &quot;Minnie – 65 Years of Minxing&quot;. Laura Howell began drawing Minne in 2018, the first woman to draw Minnie. , her work has appeared in 127 Beano issues.

==Personality traits==

Minnie is known as a typical tomboy, preferring mischievous and violent antics over those that would be normal for a typical ten-year-old girl. As opposed to Dennis&#x27; boisterous menacing methods, Minnie favours a more impish style of causing trouble which she refers to as &#x27;minxing&#x27;. Despite this, she is still keen to get into brawls much like her other fellow Beano characters. She also seems to have a distinct hatred for snob-like behaviour and spoilt children. Minnie can be deemed as hyperactive as evident in several strips which show her destroying furniture in her home or a shop whilst playing one of her games. She also considers herself to be a rebel citing she &quot;hates&quot; people telling her what to do.

===Rivalries and friendships===
Minnie has had a problem with many of her neighbours. One example is a baby called Delilah, who had a snob of a mother. She got Minnie plenty of punishments, including extra baths. Minnie defeated her by tricking her into eating a frighteningly hot curry and embarrassing her mother. The mother had just entered Delilah in a baby contest. The curry effect on Delilah happened at the time her boastful mother had arranged for a journalist to take her photo. Her mother was similar to another mother called &quot;Mrs Proudpants&quot; who was boasting about her baby who she said was sure to win the contest, just like Delilah&#x27;s mother. She also appears to have a small rivalry with The Bash Street Kids, as shown in feature-length strips drawn by Mike Pearse. However, she seems to be on friendly terms with the female member, Toots.

Minnie, like most characters, is depicted as a loner; however, she is shown to have a friendship with Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger, often seen teaming up with them in crossovers and occasionally with them in the background. Some strips have even hinted at her having a crush on Dennis and a flash-forward in the Beano Annual of 2006 revealed that Dennis and Minnie eventually get married, though the canonicity of this story is debatable and the two have yet to pursue a romantic interest in one another in the regular strips. This was retconned however, as the two of them are now cousins.

==Other characters in the strip==

===Minnie&#x27;s family===
Like most DC Thomson characters, Minnie&#x27;s parents are not normally mentioned by name and are referred to simply as Minnie&#x27;s dad and Minnie&#x27;s mum. However, in issue 2258 (dated 26 October 1985), her dad reveals that his name is &#x27;Victor&#x27;. In a later issue, one of his colleagues addresses him as &#x27;Mr Minx&#x27;. In the Beano Videostars, his boss says that Minnie&#x27;s Dad&#x27;s name is George. In one issue, Dennis&#x27; Dad calls him Malcom. Whether any of these names can be considered &#x27;official&#x27; is unclear. As of 2021, the Beano website states that her parents are named Darren and Vicky Makepeace, and that Vicky is the older sister of Sandra Menace, making Dennis and Minnie cousins.

Chester is Minnie&#x27;s pet cat. Chester has occasionally been seen in separate strips alongside fellow feline Beano characters Dodgecat (Roger the Dodger&#x27;s pet cat) and Winston (from the Bash Street Kids).

===Other children===
Soppy Susan, a character similar to Walter the Softy but a girl. The character appeared during Jim Petrie&#x27;s time as the artist and has recently returned to the strip, as well as appearing in the 2015 Beano annual.

The Haarm twins, two twins who often tease Minnie but usually end up being beaten up by her. The characters began appearing in the 2000s and appear irregularly.

Skippy Simmy, a new character who is Minnie&#x27;s best friend, introduced on 2 November 2021. He goes to Posh Street School in Beanotown, attending sixth grade.

Francis &quot;Fatty&quot; Fudge, as his name suggests, is a fat child. He is also sometimes called upon to assist Minnie in a particularly elaborate plot since his services can always be bought with a bag of sweets. He was briefly the subject of a spin-off strip in the early 1990s that parodied famous films, usually in ways involving the character&#x27;s love of food (examples including &#x27;You Only Eat Rice&#x27; and &#x27;20,000 Leeks Under The Sea&#x27;).

===Other characters===

PC Thyme is a policeman similar to Dennis the Menace&#x27;s Sergeant Slipper but this character pre-dates him. This character like the aforementioned Soppy Susan mainly appeared during Jim Petrie&#x27;s time as artist however a similar character appeared during Tom Paterson&#x27;s time as the Minnie artist called PC Pimple this character was similar to PC Thyme but as the name suggests had pimples.

Minnie&#x27;s Teacher is as the name suggests Minnie&#x27;s teacher this character is one of the newest recurring characters in the strip only appearing since Ken Harrison took over as the artist. It was revealed in Issue 3636 that she was 31.

==Reception and legacy==

Since her debut in 1953, Minnie has been hallowed as a national treasure amongst British children for generations. Long considered one of the readers&#x27; favourite characters, she was created during what many fans feel is the Beano&#x27;s golden age where other famous characters, such as Dennis the Menace and Roger the Dodger, were created. Alongside the &quot;Dandy&quot;&#x27;s Desperate Dan, she was given her own statue in Dundee in 2001 (part of the Dundee Public Art Programme). She was also featured in the line-up of McDonald&#x27;s happy meal toys in Britain and has several models and figurines. As well as featuring on much of the &quot;Beano&quot; Merchandise, such as T-shirts and figures, Minnie is often featured in the comic&#x27;s countless spin-offs such as videos, annuals and video games.

==In other media==
===Videos===
* Minnie appeared in the direct to video release &quot;The Beano Video&quot; in 1993, alongside other famous Beano characters. It was re-titled &#x27;The Beano All-Stars&#x27; when ported onto DVD. Minnie was voiced by Susan Sheridan. It was aired on ITV.
* Minnie was also included in the direct to Video release &quot;The Beano Videostars&quot; in 1994. In the film, the Beano stars were invited to a premiere of an all-new Beano feature getting up to mischief along the way. Minnie was voiced by Nicola Stapleton. It was aired on ITV.

===Video games===

* Minnie is a playable character in Beanotown Racing using her customised skateboard as a vehicle.

===Theme parks===

* Minnie was a Meet &amp; Greet character in the Beano Land section in Chessington World of Adventures from its opening in 2000 until it was re-furbished into Wild Asia in 2009. Her silhouette could be seen alongside other characters in the main entrance and her image was posted around different areas of the land. She was also featured on the trademark water fountain which would spray water at unsuspecting guests at random intervals.

===TV Show===
In 2018, it was announced that Minnie would appear in her own live-action TV show, called The Magnificent Misadventures of Minnie written by Danielle Ward. , the show has not been released, presumed cancelled.

<text>Mastering, a form of audio post production, is the process of preparing and transferring recorded audio from a source containing the final mix to a data storage device (the master), the source from which all copies will be produced (via methods such as pressing, duplication or replication). In recent years, digital masters have become usual, although analog masters—such as audio tapes—are still being used by the manufacturing industry, particularly by a few engineers who specialize in analog mastering.

Mastering requires critical listening; however, software tools exist to facilitate the process. Results depend upon the intent of the engineer, their skills, the accuracy of the speaker monitors, and the listening environment. Mastering engineers often apply equalization and dynamic range compression in order to optimize sound translation on all playback systems. It is standard practice to make a copy of a master recording—known as a safety copy—in case the master is lost, damaged or stolen.

==History==

===Pre-1940s===
In the earliest days of the recording industry, all phases of the recording and mastering process were entirely achieved by mechanical processes. Performers sang or played into a large acoustic horn and the master recording was created by the direct transfer of acoustic energy from the diaphragm of the recording horn to the mastering lathe, typically located in an adjoining room. The cutting head, driven by the energy transferred from the horn, inscribed a modulated groove into the surface of a rotating cylinder or disc. These masters were usually made from either a soft metal alloy or from wax; this gave rise to the colloquial term &quot;waxing&quot;, referring to the cutting of a record.

After the introduction of the microphone and electronic amplifier in the mid-1920s, the mastering process became electro-mechanical, and electrically driven mastering lathes came into use for cutting master discs (the cylinder format by then having been superseded). Until the introduction of tape recording, master recordings were almost always cut direct-to-disc. Only a small minority of recordings were mastered using previously recorded material sourced from other discs.

===Emergence of magnetic tape===
In the late 1940s, the recording industry was revolutionized by the introduction of magnetic tape. Magnetic tape was invented for recording sound by Fritz Pfleumer in 1928 in Germany, based on the invention of magnetic wire recording by Valdemar Poulsen in 1898. Not until the end of World War II could the technology be found outside Europe. The introduction of magnetic tape recording enabled master discs to be cut separately in time and space from the actual recording process.

Although tape and other technical advances dramatically improved the audio quality of commercial recordings in the post-war years, the basic constraints of the electro-mechanical mastering process remained, and the inherent physical limitations of the main commercial recording media—the 78 rpm disc and later the 7-inch 45 rpm single and 33-1/3 rpm LP record—meant that the audio quality, dynamic range, and running time of master discs were still limited compared to later media such as the compact disc.

===Electro-mechanical mastering process===
From the 1950s until the advent of digital recording in the late 1970s, the mastering process typically went through several stages. Once the studio recording on multi-track tape was complete, a final mix was prepared and dubbed down to the master tape, usually either a single-track mono or two-track stereo tape. Prior to the cutting of the master disc, the master tape was often subjected to further electronic treatment by a specialist mastering engineer.

After the advent of tape it was found that, especially for pop recordings, master recordings could be made so that the resulting record would sound better. This was done by making fine adjustments to the amplitude of sound at different frequency bands (equalization) prior to the cutting of the master disc.

In large recording companies such as EMI, the mastering process was usually controlled by specialist staff technicians who were conservative in their work practices. These big companies were often reluctant to make changes to their recording and production processes. For example, EMI was very slow in taking up innovations in multi-track recording and did not install 8-track recorders in their Abbey Road Studios until the late 1960s, more than a decade after the first commercial 8-track recorders were installed by American independent studios.

===Digital technology===

In the 1990s, electro-mechanical processes were largely superseded by digital technology, with digital recordings stored on hard disk drives or digital tape and mastered to CD. The digital audio workstation (DAW) became common in many mastering facilities, allowing the off-line manipulation of recorded audio via a graphical user interface (GUI). Although many digital processing tools are common during mastering, it is also very common to use analog media and processing equipment for the mastering stage. Just as in other areas of audio, the benefits and drawbacks of digital technology compared to analog technology are still a matter for debate. However, in the field of audio mastering, the debate is usually over the use of digital versus analog signal processing rather than the use of digital technology for storage of audio.

Digital systems have higher performance and allow mixing to be performed at lower maximum levels. When mixing to 24-bits with peaks between −3 and −10 dBFS on a mix, the mastering engineer has enough headroom to process and produce a final master. Mastering engineers recommend leaving enough headroom on the mix to avoid distortion. The reduction of dynamics by the mix or mastering engineer has resulted in a loudness war in commercial recordings.

== Process ==

The source material, ideally at the original resolution, is processed using equalization, compression, limiting and other processes. Additional operations, such as editing, specifying the gaps between tracks, adjusting level, fading in and out, noise reduction and other signal restoration and enhancement processes can also be applied as part of the mastering stage. The source material is put in the proper order, commonly referred to as assembly (or &#x27;track&#x27;) sequencing. These operations prepare the music for either digital or analog, e.g. vinyl, replication.

If the material is destined for vinyl release, additional processing, such as dynamic range reduction or frequency-dependent stereo–to–mono fold-down and equalization may be applied to compensate for the limitations of that medium. For compact disc release, &quot;start of track&quot;, &quot;end of track&quot;, and &quot;indexes&quot; are defined for playback navigation along with International Standard Recording Code (ISRC) and other information necessary to replicate a CD. Vinyl LP and cassettes have their own pre-duplication requirements for a finished master. Subsequently, it is rendered either to a physical medium, such as a CD-R or DVD-R, or to computer files, such as a Disc Description Protocol (DDP) file set or an ISO image. Regardless of what delivery method is chosen, the replicator factory will transfer the audio to a glass master that will generate metal stampers for replication.

The process of audio mastering varies depending on the specific needs of the audio to be processed. Mastering engineers need to examine the types of input media, the expectations of the source producer or recipient, the limitations of the end medium and process the subject accordingly. General rules of thumb can rarely be applied.

Steps of the process typically include the following:
# Transferring the recorded audio tracks into the Digital Audio Workstation (DAW)
# Sequence the separate songs or tracks as they will appear on the final release
# Adjust the length of the silence between songs
# Process or sweeten audio to maximize the sound quality for the intended medium (e.g. applying specific EQ for vinyl)
# Transfer the audio to the final master format (CD-ROM, half-inch reel tape, PCM 1630 U-matic tape, etc.)

Examples of possible actions taken during mastering:
# Editing minor flaws
# Applying noise reduction to eliminate clicks, dropouts, hum and hiss
# Adjusting stereo width
# Equalize audio across tracks for the purpose of optimized frequency distribution
# Adjust volume
# Dynamic range compression or expansion
# Peak limit
# Inserting ISRC codes and CD text
# Arranging tracks in their final sequential order
# Fading out the ending of each song
# Dither

==Engineer==
A mastering engineer is a person skilled in the practice of taking audio (typically musical content) that has been previously mixed in either the analogue or digital domain as mono, stereo, or multichannel formats and preparing it for use in distribution, whether by physical media such as a CD, vinyl record, or as some method of streaming audio.

===Education and experience===
The mastering engineer is responsible for a final edit of a product and preparation for manufacturing copies. Although there are no official requirements to work as an audio mastering engineer, practitioners often have comprehensive domain knowledge of audio engineering, and in many cases, may hold an audio or acoustic engineering degree. Most audio engineers master music or speech audio material. The best mastering engineers might possess arrangement and production skills, allowing them to troubleshoot mix issues and improve the final sound. Generally, good mastering skills are based on experience, resulting from many years of practice.

===Equipment===
Generally, mastering engineers use a combination of specialized audio-signal processors, low-distortion-high-bandwidth loudspeakers (and corresponding amplifiers with which to drive them), within a dedicated, acoustically-optimized playback environment. The equipment and processors used within the field of mastering are almost entirely dedicated to the purpose; engineered to a high standard, often possessing low signal-to-noise ratios [at nominal operating levels] and in many cases, the incorporation of parameter-recall, such as indented potentiometers, or in some more-sophisticated designs, via a digital-controller. Some advocates for digital software claim that plug-ins are capable of processing audio in a mastering context, though without the same degree of signal degradation as those introduced from processors within the analog domain. The quality of the results varies according to the algorithms used within these processors, which in some cases, can introduce distortions entirely exclusive to the digital domain.

Real-time analyzers, phase oscilloscopes, and also peak, RMS, VU and K meters are frequently used within the audio analysis stage of the process as a means of rendering a visual representation of the audio, or signal, being analyzed.

===Aspects of their work===
Most mastering engineer accolades are given for their ability to make a mix consistent with respect to subjective factors based on the perception of listeners, regardless of their playback systems and the environment. This is a difficult task due to the varieties of systems now available and the effect it has on the apparent qualitative attributes of the recording. For instance, a recording that sounds great on one speaker/amplifier combination playing CD audio, may sound drastically different on a computer-based system playing back a low-bitrate MP3. Some engineers maintain that the main mastering engineer&#x27;s task is to improve upon playback systems translations while the position of others is to make a sonic impact.

Prolonged periods of listening to improperly mastered recordings usually leads to hearing fatigue that ultimately takes the pleasure out of the listening experience.

<doc id="254879" wikidata="Q179115" url="?curid=254879" title="Widow">
<text>A widow (female) or widower (male) is a person whose spouse has died and has usually not remarried. The male form, &quot;widower&quot;, is first attested in the 14th century, by the 19th century supplanting &quot;widow&quot; with reference to men. The adjective for either sex is &quot;widowed&quot;. These terms are not applied to a divorcé(e) following the death of an ex-spouse.

The state of having lost one&#x27;s spouse to death is termed &quot;widowhood&quot;. The term &quot;widowhood&quot; can be used for either sex, at least according to some dictionaries, but the word &quot;widowerhood&quot; is also listed in some dictionaries. An archaic term for a widow is &quot;relict&quot;, literally &quot;someone left over&quot;; this word can sometimes be found on older gravestones. Occasionally, the word &quot;viduity&quot; is used.

== Effects on health ==
The increased mortality rate after the death of a spouse is called the &quot;widowhood effect&quot;. It is &quot;strongest during the first three months after a spouse&#x27;s death, when they had a 66-percent increased chance of dying&quot;. There remains controversy over whether women or men are worse off, and studies have attempted to make each case, while others suggest there are no sex differences.

While it is disputed as to whether sex plays a part in the intensity of grief, sex often influences how a person&#x27;s lifestyle changes after a spouse&#x27;s death. Research has shown that the difference falls in the burden of care, expectations, and how they react after the spouse&#x27;s death. For example, women often carry more of an emotional burden than men and are less willing to go through the death of another spouse. After being widowed, men and women may react very differently and frequently change their lifestyles. Women tend to miss their husbands more if they died suddenly; men tend to miss their wives more if they died after suffering a long terminal illness. In addition, both men and women have been observed to experience lifestyle habit changes after the death of a spouse. Both sexes tend to have a harder time looking after themselves without their spouse to help, though these changes may differ based on the sex of the widow and the role the spouse played in their life.

The older spouses grow, the more aware they are of being alone due to the death of their husband or wife. This negatively impacts the mental as well as physical well-being in both men and women.

== Mourning practices ==
In some parts of Europe and Latin America, including Russia, Slovakia, the Czech Republic, Greece, Italy, Portugal, Spain and Mexico, widows used to wear black for the rest of their lives to signify their mourning, a practice that has largely died out. Orthodox Christian immigrants may wear lifelong black in the United States to signify their widowhood and devotion to their deceased husband.

After the Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856 in India, the status of widowhood for Hindu women was accompanied by a body symbolism - The widow&#x27;s head was shaved as part of her mourning, she could no longer wear a red dot sindoor on her forehead, was forbidden to wear wedding jewellery, had to keep her bosoms uncovered and was expected to walk barefoot. These customs are mostly considered backward but still prevalent among Hindus.

In some parts of South Asia, a woman is often accused of causing her husband&#x27;s death and is not allowed to look at another person as her gaze is considered bad luck.

Some Nigerians prefer a widow to drink the water her dead husband&#x27;s body was washed in, or otherwise sleep next to her husband&#x27;s grave for three days.

In the folklore of Chiloé of southern Chile, widows and black cats are important elements that are needed when hunting for the treasure of the carbunclo.

== Economic position ==
In societies where the husband is the sole provider, his death can leave his family destitute. The tendency for women generally to outlive men can compound this.

The Bible has written several commandments about caring for the widow, the prohibition against harming her and the duty to make her happy during the holidays, for example: &quot;Be joyful at your festival—you, your sons and daughters, your male and female servants, and the Levites, the foreigners, the fatherless and the widows who live in your towns&quot;.(Hebrew Bible, Book of Deuteronomy 16:14)

In 19th-century Britain, widows had greater opportunity for social mobility than in many other societies. Along with the ability to ascend socio-economically, widows—who were &quot;presumably celibate&quot;—were much more able (and likely) to challenge conventional sexual behaviour than married women in their society.

It may be necessary for a woman to comply with the social customs of her area because her fiscal stature depends on it, but this custom is also often abused by others as a way to keep money within the deceased spouse&#x27;s family. It is also uncommon for widows to challenge their treatment because they are often &quot;unaware of their rights under the modern law…because of their low status, and lack of education or legal representation.&quot;. Unequal benefits and treatment generally received by widows compared to those received by widowers globally has spurred an interest in the issue by human rights activists. During the HIV pandemic, which particularly hit gay communities, companions of deceased men had little recourse in estate court against the deceased’s family. Not yet able to have been legally married the term widower was not considered socially acceptable. This situation was usually blessed with an added stigma being attached to the surviving man.

As of 2004, women in United States who were widowed younger are at greater economic hardship risk. Married women who are in a financially unstable household are more likely to become widows &quot;because of the strong relationship between mortality [of the male head] and wealth [of the household].&quot; In underdeveloped and developing areas of the world, conditions for widows continue to be much more severe. The United Nations Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women (ratified by 135 countries) while slow, is working on proposals which will make certain types of discrimination and treatment of widows (such as violence and withholding property rights) illegal in the countries that have joined CEDAW.

In the United States, Social Security offers a Survivor&#x27;s Benefit to qualified people once for a loss through their 50th birthday after which a second marriage may be considered when applying for benefits. The maximum still remains the same but here the survivor has options between accessing their earned benefits or one of their qualifying late spouses at chosen intervals to maximize the increased benefits for delaying a filing (i.e. at age 63 claim husband one&#x27;s reduced benefit, then husband two&#x27;s full amount at 67 and your own enhanced benefit at 68).

==Abuse==
===Sexual violence===

In parts of Africa, such as Kenya, widows are viewed as impure and in need of cleansing. This often requires having sex with someone. Those refusing to be cleansed risk getting beaten by superstitious villagers, who may also harm the woman and her late husband&#x27;s children. It is argued that this notion arose from the idea that if a husband dies, the woman may have performed witchcraft against him.

Use of widows in harem has been recorded in Ancient Egypt, medieval Europe, and Islamic empires.

===Ritual killing===
Sati was a practice in South Asia where a woman would immolate herself upon her husband&#x27;s death. These practices were outlawed in 1827 in British India and again in 1987 in independent India by the Sati Prevention Act, which made it illegal to support, glorify or attempt to commit sati. Support of sati, including coercing or forcing someone to commit sati, can be punished by the death sentence or life imprisonment, while glorifying sati is punishable with one to seven years in prison.

The people of Fiji practised widow-strangling. When Fijians adopted Christianity, widow-strangling was abandoned.

===Witch hunts===

Those likely to be accused and killed as witches, such as in Papua New Guinea, are often widows.

===Forced remarriage===

Widow inheritance (also known as bride inheritance) is a cultural and social practice whereby a widow is required to marry a male relative of her late husband, often his brother.

===Banned remarriage===

The Hindu Widows&#x27; Remarriage Act, 1856, enacted in response to the campaign of the reformer Pandit Ishwar Chandra Vidyasagar, to encourage widow remarriage and provided legal safeguards against loss of certain forms of inheritance for remarrying a Hindu widow, though, under the Act, the widow forsook any inheritance due her from her deceased husband.

Social stigma in Joseon Korea required that widows remain unmarried after their husbands&#x27; death. In 1477, Seongjong of Joseon enacted the Widow Remarriage Law, which strengthened pre-existing social constraints by barring the sons of widows who remarried from holding public office. In 1489, Seongjong condemned a woman of the royal clan, Yi Guji, when it was discovered that she had cohabited with her slave after being widowed. More than 40 members of her household were arrested and her lover was tortured to death.

===Theft===
In some parts of the world, such as Zimbabwe, the property of widows, such as land, is often taken away by her in-laws. While illegal, since most marriages are conducted under customary law and not registered, redressing the issue of property grabbing is complicated.

<text>Bottrop () is a city in west-central Germany, on the Rhine–Herne Canal, in North Rhine-Westphalia. Located in the Ruhr industrial area, Bottrop adjoins Essen, Oberhausen, Gladbeck, and Dorsten. The city had been a coal-mining and rail center and contains factories producing coal-tar derivatives, chemicals, textiles, and machinery. Bottrop grew as a mining center beginning in the 1860s, was chartered as a city in 1921, and bombed during the Oil Campaign of World War II. In 1975, it unified with the neighbouring communities of Gladbeck and Kirchhellen, but Gladbeck left it in 1976, leading to Kirchhellen becoming a district of Bottrop as Bottrop-Kirchhellen. It is also twinned with Blackpool, England.

==Boroughs==
The total area of the municipal territory is about . The longest north-south distance is , and from west to east . The highest peak within the city&#x27;s territory is , the lowest one being above sea level.

Bottrop is divided into three boroughs: Bottrop-Mitte (Bottrop-Center), Bottrop-Süd (Bottrop South) and Bottrop-Kirchhellen, each having a borough representation and a borough ruler.

These boroughs are further subdivided into city parts, partly named after their traditional names, while the newly built parts are only recently named:

*Bottrop-Mitte: Eigen, Fuhlenbrock, Stadtmitte, and Marktviertel
*Bottrop-Süd: Batenbrock, Boy, Ebel, Lehmkuhle, Vonderort, Gartenstadt Welheim (Garden city Welheim), and Welheimer Mark 
*Bottrop-Kirchhellen: Ekel, Feldhausen, Grafenwald, Hardinghausen, Holthausen, Im Loh, Kirchhellen, Kuhberg, and Overhagen

For statistical reasons, Bottrop is also divided into &quot;statistical&quot; boroughs. They are (with their official numbering):

===Kirchhellen===
From 1919 until 1976, Kirchhellen was its own town. Following a communal reorganization reform in 1975, both Kirchhellen and Gladbeck joined the city of Bottrop. This resulted in the nickname &quot;GlaBotKi&quot;. Gladbeck left the city in 1976, and became part of the district of Recklinghausen.

Most of Kirchhellen is Catholic (around 65%). It has three churches, including one Lutheran church.

==Politics==
===Mayor===
The current mayor of Bottrop is Bernd Tischler of the Social Democratic Party (SPD) since 2009. The most recent mayoral election was held on 13 September 2020, and the results were as follows:

<text>Eof (also Eoves) was a swineherd who claimed to have seen a vision of the Virgin Mary at Evesham in England, about 701. Eof related this vision to Egwin, Bishop of Worcester, who founded the great Evesham Abbey on the site of the apparition. &quot;Evesham&quot; means Eof&#x27;s ham (homestead).

==Legend==
The standard &quot;Lives&quot;, and &quot;Saint Egwin and his Abbey of Evesham&quot; say Eof was a swineherd. A letter, apparently written by Ecgwin, says &quot;... primum cuidam pastori gregum ...&quot;, and the Acta Sanctorum (Lives of the Saints) states something similar: &quot; ...pastores gregum ...&quot; The Latin means either a shepherd or a herdsman. William Dugdale in &quot;Monasticon Anglicanum&quot; says &quot;Eoves, a herdsman of the bishop ...&quot;. George May, the most eminent of Evesham historians, gives both herdsman and swineherd.

The story that Eof was a swineherd goes back at least to William of Malmesbury, writing in the twelfth century. The obverse of the conventual seal of Evesham Abbey clearly shows stylised pigs rather than sheep; the monks of the Abbey clearly thought Eof kept pigs.

The legend of Eof&#x27;s vision has been commemorated by a bronze statue sited in the town centre paid for by public subscription and created by the British born sculptor John McKenna. The statue was unveiled in a public ceremony that took place on Sunday 15 June 2008.

==Eof vs. Eoves==
The question of whether the swineherd was named Eof or Eoves is a long-standing 
question still argued about today. Writing in 1920 however, the historian O.G. Knapp argued that &quot;It is impossible that Eoves should have been the Swineherd’s name for several reasons. In the first place the letter ‘V’ is not found in the Saxon alphabet, having been brought to this country by the Normans; so that Eofeshamme, given in one of the charters, indicates the older and better form of the name ... But even if Eofes is older and more accurate than Eoves it cannot be the original form of the name. A moment’s reflection will show that if Evesham means the meadow of some person, the name of that person must be in what Grammarians call the Genitive (or Possessive) Case, Singular. This in modern English is nearly always denoted by ’s placed at the end of the word; the apostrophe showing that a vowel has dropped out of the termination. Anglo-Saxon had a larger selection of endings for the Genitive Case, but the one in –es (the original form of our modern ’s) belonged to what are called ‘strong’ Masculine nouns, which usually ended in a consonant. Eofes, therefore, would be the natural Genitive of a man’s proper name, Eof. Ferguson suggests that the original form of the name might have been Eofa, but such a name would correspond to the ‘weak’ nouns which made their Genitive by adding not –es but –an; in which case the name of the town would have been Eofanham, as is shown in the case of Offenham, the Ham of Offa or Uffa. We may therefore take it as certain that the real name of the Swineherd was not Eoves, Eofes, or even Eofa, but Eof.&quot;

<text>Evesham Abbey was founded by Saint Egwin at Evesham in Worcestershire, England between 700 and 710 following an alleged vision of the Virgin Mary by a swineherd by the name of Eof.

According to the monastic history, Evesham came through the Norman Conquest unusually well, because of a quick approach by Abbot Æthelwig to William the Conqueror. The abbey is of Benedictine origin, and became in its heyday one of the wealthiest in the country. Simon de Montfort (1208–1265) is buried near the high altar of the ruined abbey, the spot marked by an altar-like memorial monument dedicated by the Archbishop of Canterbury in 1965.

During the 16th-century dissolution of the monasteries, almost all of the abbey was demolished. Today, only one section of walling survives from the abbey itself, although fragments of the 13th-century chapter house, together with the almonry, the 16th-century bell tower and a gateway remain. The abbey&#x27;s site is a scheduled monument and has several listed structures within it and adjacent to it, of which four are designated at the highest Grade I level.

== Foundation ==

The year of the foundation of the abbey (that is, when a monastic community was first established) is problematic. William Tindal (1794) comments that &quot;I have a MS. but without name or reference, which says that he [i.e. Ecgwine] began his Abbey in the year 682. This is before he was made bishop, and seems improbable. Tanner [Not. Mon. p.168] says in 701. The date of Pope Constantine’s charter may decide the point as to the consecration of his Abbey, but there is reason to suppose that Egwin began to build as early as the year 702&quot;. George May gives 701 as the year that Ethelred conferred on Ecgwine the whole peninsula with the erection of the monastery commencing in the same year.

On the other hand, the year of the consecration derives from the grant of the first privilege to the abbey from Pope Constantine &quot;written in the seven hundred and ninth year of our Lord’s incarnation.&quot; Ecgwine allegedly returned from Rome bearing this charter, which was apparently read out by Archbishop Berhtwald at a council of &quot;the whole of England&quot; held at Alcester, although that meeting was probably fictitious. Thomas of Marlborough records that, in accordance with the apostolic command, a community of monks was then established (meaning the foundation has also been dated to 709):

&quot;When the blessed Ecgwine saw that longed-for day when the place which he had built would be consecrated, and a monastic order established to serve God in that place, he then abandoned all concerns for worldly matters, and devoted himself to a contemplative way of life. Following the example of the Lord by humbling himself, he resigned his bishop&#x27;s see, and became abbot of the monastery.&quot;

The alleged charter of Ecgwine (purportedly written in 714) records that on the feast of All Saints &quot;Bishop Wilfrid and I consecrated the church which I had built to God, the Blessed Mary, and to all Christ’s elect&quot;. The feast of All Saints became established in the West after 609 or 610 under Pope Boniface IV; its observance on 1 November dates from the time of Pope Gregory III (died 741). A Bishop Wilfrid was Egwin’s successor to the see of Worcester (though he is sometimes confused with Wilfrid, Bishop of York, who died c. 709).

Although the exact year of the foundation remains unclear, it has sometimes been assumed that the date of the abbey&#x27;s consecration was the feast of All Saints in 709. That the consecration occurred on this feast day would provide a neat connection with All Saints&#x27; Church in Evesham. That Abbot Clement Lichfield lies buried beneath the Chantry Chapel, now known as the Lichfield Chapel in consequence, provides a link to the closing days of the life of the abbey.

==Surviving structures==

During the dissolution of the monasteries, on its surrender to the king in 1540 the abbey was plundered and razed to the ground, although the bell tower built earlier that century was saved. The tower stands tall and is a Grade I listed building. Other remains include:

* The abbey&#x27;s almonry, from the 15th century and earlier, Grade I listed, has been restored and houses the Almonry Museum and Heritage Centre
* The L-shaped house which is now numbers 53 and 54, Merstow Green, incorporates the abbey&#x27;s Great Gate from the early 14th century and a vaulted passage from the same period; Grade I listed
* Abbot Reginald&#x27;s gateway and wall, c.1120 with 15th-century room above; Grade I listed
* Part of the south wall of the abbey precinct, restored, including an arched doorway
* A 13th-century archway which led to the chapter house
* Fragmentary remains of the west wall of the north transept of the abbey
* A wall, blocked arches and a window which are the remains of the abbey stables, 14th and 15th centuries; Grade II* listed
The full area of the abbey precincts, most of which is today a public park, was designated as a scheduled monument in 1949. , the site in general and in particular the almonry and Abbot Reginald&#x27;s wall, are on Historic England&#x27;s Heritage at Risk register owing to their vulnerable condition.

Other buildings linked to the history of the abbey include Middle Littleton tythe barn.

== Relics of saints ==
*Saint Egwin, third bishop of Worcester and founder of Evesham Abbey
*Saint Credan, abbot of the abbey during the reign of King Offa of Mercia
*Saint Wigstan of Mercia (aka Wulstan and Wystan)
*Saint Odulf, a Frisian saint and missionary (d. 855) recorded in the Hagiographies of Secgan, &#x27;Saint Ecgwine&#x27;, and hagiography of St Odulf, the &quot;Ave presul gloriose Augustine&quot; psalter, and Chronicon Abbatiae de Evesham

== Other burials ==

*Simon de Montfort, 6th Earl of Leicester
*Henry de Montfort
*Hugh le Despencer, 1st Baron le Despencer
*Robert de Stafford
*Thomas of Marlborough

==Prints and paintings==

Prints of picturesque ruins accompanied the growth of domestic tourism in Britain during the second half of the 18th century, among which can be found striking images of the remains of the abbey walls and bell tower at Evesham. These, accompanied by scenic and historical descriptions, were collected, for example, in such works as Francis Grose&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of England and Wales&quot; (1786) and, more particularly, Samuel Ireland&#x27;s &quot;Picturesque Views on the Upper or Warwickshire Avon&quot; (1795). Among the visiting artists who came to paint them was J. M. W. Turner, who in 1793 made pen and wash studies of the abbey gateway and of the Church of St Laurence seen through the bell tower&#x27;s arch. An anonymous artist of the period also left a panorama of the tower and churches behind it as seen from the river.

In the following century, the antiquary Edward Rudge began excavations of the abbey remains on parts of his property, between 1811 and 1834. The results were given to the Society of Antiquaries of London; illustrations of the discoveries were published in their &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot; with a memoir by his son, Edward John Rudge and illustrations by his wife, Anne Rudge.

== Conservation ==
Evesham Abbey Trust, a charity and charitable incorporated organisation registered in 2016, aims to conserve, preserve and improve the abbey site and environs. Since May 2017, the trust owns the freehold of much of the site following its gifting by the Rudge family. The trust in 2019 obtained over £1m of funding from the National Lottery Heritage Fund, Historic England and other local and regional funders to begin the conservation and restoration of the abbey walls and the creation of a set of interpretive gardens. The work was completed in 2023.

== Commemoration ==
One of the Great Western Railway Star class locomotives was named Evesham Abbey and numbered 4065. It was subsequently rebuilt as a Castle class locomotive, being renumbered as 5085 while retaining the name Evesham Abbey.

<doc id="254920" wikidata="Q920642" url="?curid=254920" title="Fra Diavolo">
<text>Fra Diavolo (lit. Brother Devil; 7 April 1771–11 November 1806), is the popular name given to Michele Pezza, a guerrilla leader who resisted the French occupation of Naples, proving an &quot;inspirational practitioner of popular insurrection&quot;. Pezza figures prominently in folk lore and fiction. He appears in several works of Alexandre Dumas, including &quot;The Last Cavalier: Being the Adventures of Count Sainte-hermine in the Age of Napoleon&quot;, not published until 2007 and in Washington Irving&#x27;s short story &quot;The Inn at Terracina&quot;.

==Biography==
The nickname &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; came about due to an old Itrano custom: Until early in the twentieth century Itrani boys and girls who had recently recovered from serious illnesses were dressed as monks on the second Sunday after Easter, for a procession in honor of St. Francis of Paola, the patron of sick children. On one of these solemn occasions little Michele, who was apparently a handful to begin with, proved so naughty that someone called him &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; (Brother Devil) which stuck.

=== Early life ===
The notion that Pezza &quot;was born of low parentage&quot; has received wide circulation but is hardly accurate; it forms part of a hostile tradition derived from French propaganda. The Pezzas had some land in olives and were also engaged in the wool trade. The family home has some interesting architectural details, which also suggests some wealth, and they were related to several of the most prominent families in Itri, such as the Ialongo and the Pennachia.

Although little is known with certainty of his early life, Pezza learned to read and write, hardly a common accomplishment at the time, and further indication of some wealth in the family. As a young man he secured employment as a courier for the Neapolitan Royal Mail, making the round trip between Terracina and Naples twice a week for 50 ducats a year, a considerable sum, while becoming intimately familiar with the local terrain, which had a reputation for brigandage, knowledge that would later serve him in good stead. In 1797, while so employed, he vied for the affections of a young woman with another young man. One night his rival and another man ambushed Pezza, intending to do him some harm. Pezza, who reportedly had a &quot;fiery temper&quot;, managed to kill both of his attackers. He took to the hills, but was soon caught. Tried, he was convicted of manslaughter, since the slaying had been committed in self-defense, and on 25 October 1797 he was sentenced to a tour in the army in lieu of prison.

On 20 January 1798 Pezza was enrolled in the &quot;Reggimento di Messapi&quot;, stationed at Fondi, about a dozen miles north of Itri and perhaps a dozen south of the frontier with the Papal States. Pezza rose quickly, becoming a sergeant, probably because he was literate and, as a member of the middle class and a former Royal courier, already familiar with firearms. In November of late 1798 Pezza took part in the disastrous attempt of the Neapolitan Army to oust the French from the Papal States.

The French responded quickly to the Neapolitan incursion, forcing them to retreat, and then undertook an invasion of the Kingdom of Naples. Plagued by cold and heavy rains, the Neapolitans fell back along the Appian Way. Thousands of troops deserted and many more were captured. Pezza, who was with the rear guard, was almost captured by the French, but escaped by donning peasant dress, and took to the hills above Itri. During the retreat, the Neapolitan &quot;Reggimento di Lucania&quot; fortified an old Roman sanctuary, the &quot;Fortino di San Andrea&quot;, located about a few miles northwest of Itri, where a pass carries the Appian Way over the Aurunci Mountains. On 26 December, reinforced by some irregulars hastily recruited by Pezza, the regiment ambushed elements of the French &quot;Polish Legion&quot;, touching off a three-day skirmish. Unable to get through the easily defended defile, some French troops passed down the coast road, along the ancient Via Flacca, from Terracina to capture Sperlonga. The weather was foul, very cold with incessant rains that turned to ice. From Sperlonga, the French began working their way overland across the mountains, to outflank the Neapolitans at the old villa, and by dawn on the 29th were in position to attack. But the French movement had been detected by Pezza&#x27;s irregulars, who were patrolling the hills, and they guided the Neapolitan troops safely out of the encirclement, so that they could fall back on the great fortress of Gaeta, about 15 miles down the coast. The French pressed on, and over the next few weeks, despite unusually cold and icy weather, overran the rest of Naples, capturing the city itself on 22 January 1799 and proclaiming the Parthenopaean Republic. For Pezza, the most critical event of this period occurred on 30 December, when French and Polish troops captured Itri. A band of peasants from the vicinity attempted to resist, but were rapidly overcome. The invaders then shot their prisoners, plundered the town a bit, proclaimed a new age of freedom, erected a &quot;Liberty Tree&quot;, and held a ball.

=== Resistance to French rule 1798–1799===

Though many reform-minded nobles and some intellectuals backed it, the French puppet regime in Naples, the Parthenopaean Republic, had little popular support. In addition, French and Polish troops acted abominably; looting and rape were common. French atrocities were so blatant that their commander in Naples, General Jean Étienne Championnet, was sacked by Guillaume-Charles Faipoult, one of the government representatives on mission, and subsequently imprisoned.

Irregular resistance had begun almost as soon as the invaders entered the country, and French atrocities only served to send more young men into the hills to join the insurgency. Attacks on French soldiers became common. The French retaliated swiftly and brutally, which only made matters worse. The experience of Itri was typical. On 15 January two French soldiers were killed while patrolling the Appian Way near the town. The next day a mixed force of French and Polish troops inflicted severe reprisals on the town, looting, raping, and murdering, leaving 60 men, women, and children lying dead in the streets; Michele Pezza&#x27;s 67-year-old father was among the dead.

Meanwhile, although in exile in Sicily, the Neapolitan government, effectively controlled by Queen Maria Carolina, wife of King Ferdinand IV of Naples, appointed Fabrizio Ruffo, a progressive government minister and one of the last laymen to hold the dignity of cardinal in the Roman Catholic Church, to organize a resistance movement. On 8 February 1799, British and Neapolitan ships landed 5,000 troops and volunteers under Ruffo&#x27;s command in Calabria. This force soon expanded into an unruly army of laymen and clerics, nobles and peasants, rich and poor, men, women, and children. Dubbed &quot;la Armata cristiana della Santa Fede&quot; (&quot;the Christian Army of the Holy Faith&quot;), this horde made up for its lack of training and equipment with enthusiasm, ferocity, and suicidal courage.

Pezza had already organized a small band of irregulars in the northern part of the Terra di Lavoro, and soon became one of Ruffo&#x27;s principal subordinate commanders. His &quot;massa&quot; (&quot;band&quot;) quickly grew to some 4,000 men, including his three brothers and the scions of a number of the leading families of Itri, such as Pasquale-Maria Nofi, who served as his adjutant with the rank of lieutenant. With these men, he raided French outposts far and wide. On one occasion he slipped into heavily occupied Fondi in the guise of a priest — thus becoming once again &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; — to cut down the &quot;Liberty Tree&quot; which the French had planted there, replacing it with a cross that still stands. He even harassed French forces holding Gaeta, the great fortress dominating the northwestern route into the Kingdom of Naples, ambushing supply trains (once making off with 1,400 sheep) and couriers. Pezza made the &quot;Fortino di San Andrea&quot; his base of operations, and spread terror against French supporters over a wide area. He soon had a substantial price on his head.

The city of Naples was liberated from the French in June, Gaeta was recaptured at the end of July by royal troops and Pezza&#x27;s men, aided by the British fleet. By late September the French had largely been driven out of the kingdom, and a Neapolitan army had gone on to liberate Rome. The Neapolitan insurrection had probably cost the lives of 50,000 or 60,000 people in the kingdom.

A hard, tough leader, Pezza gave no quarter. His men committed &quot;most monstrous misdeeds&quot;, torturing and murdering hundreds of prisoners of war, including a French general. He was so ferocious that for a time Cardinal Ruffo placed him under arrest for his many atrocities. Nevertheless, for his services, Pezza was made a colonel in the army, ennobled as the Duke of Cassero, granted an annual pension of 2,500 ducats — making him one of the richest men in the district — and even given a lock of the queen&#x27;s hair. He settled down near Itri with his wife, Fortunata Rachele Di Franco, a local beauty whom he had married in July 1799, when she was just 18, and he was en route to the liberation of Rome. For the next few years they lived quietly, while producing two sons.

===Resistance to French rule 1806===
In 1806 Napoleon, Emperor of the French, decided to place his brother Joseph Bonaparte on the Neapolitan throne. Some 32,000 French troops invaded Naples in January, in three columns under General Laurent de Gouvion-Saint-Cyr, later a Marshal of France; about 12,000 men marched down the Adriatic coast, 15,000 more attacked down the Apennines, which form the spine of Italy, and General Jean Louis Reynier led about 10,000 troops down the Appian Way. The Neapolitan Army, with barely 13,000 men available for mobile operations, fell back on Calabria as the French quickly occupied frontier areas and pressed on. By February Reynier&#x27;s column had captured Fondi and continued on towards Itri. Some Neapolitan troops were garrisoned at Pezza&#x27;s old base, the &quot;Fortino di San Andrea,&quot;, but they fled south to Itri when the French turned up. The French pursued. There was a short skirmish at Itri, which hardly impeded the French advance. Reynier sent a regiment ahead to seize Gaeta by a &quot;coup de main&quot;, but the fortress, commanded by Louis, Landgrave of Hesse-Philippsthal, resisted stoutly. The Siege of Gaeta lasted until 18 July. The French found the rest of Naples easier prey. The capital fell on 14 February as the king and queen once more fled to Sicily, and the French soon overran most of the rest of the kingdom.

When the French invaded, Pezza was recalled to active duty, and ordered to organize a guerrilla column to resist the attackers. But the French moved so fast he was barely able to escape, and fled with his brothers to Sicily. He soon returned, however, and, on 23 March 1806, clashed with the French near Itri. Shortly afterwards, Pezza was recalled to Sicily to gather more forces, and in April joined an expedition to reinforce Gaeta that was led by the British admiral Sir Sidney Smith, one of Napoleon&#x27;s most inveterate foes.

Hesse-Philippsthal gave Pezza command of a band of irregulars who were landed along the coast near the mouth of the Garigliano River, about 20 miles southeast of Gaeta, with instructions to stir up guerrilla resistance in the French rear. Pezza conducted several raids against French outposts, but then undertook an ill-advised attack against a substantial French force. Defeated, he fled back to Gaeta, assuming a disguise so as to trick a French officer into giving him a pass through the siege lines. To Hesse-Philippsthal this smacked of treachery, and he decided that Pezza was secretly in league with the French. Pezza was arrested and sent in chains to Palermo in May 1806. Sir Sidney quickly cleared Pezza&#x27;s name, however, and for a few weeks he conducted seaborne raids against French outposts along the coast from Ponza and the other islands in the Gulf of Gaeta.

On 4 July, a small British and Sicilian force inflicted a stunning defeat on the French in the Battle of Maida, in Calabria. Hoping to follow up this victory, Pezza and a band of followers landed at Amante, in Calabria, on the 26th. Pezza proved to be the most effective of the many guerrilla leaders who had sprung up in the aftermath of the invasion, and soon attracted considerable local support. The French were soon closely invested at Cosenza. Given time the guerrillas might have taken the city. But Gaeta had fallen to the French on 18 July, after twelve days of heavy bombardment, during which Hesse-Phillipsthal had been gravely wounded. This released some 10,000 French troops, most of whom were promptly sent into Calabria. The various guerrilla leaders unwisely attempted to make a stand at Lauria. There, on 8 August, Marshal André Masséna defeated them, virtually annihilating their forces in a no quarter fight. Although on 14 August, with the support of Sir Sydney&#x27;s ships, Pezza managed to capture Fort Licosa from the enemy, that very same day the French relieved Cosenza. As by this time enormously superior French forces were on the march, the British decided to withdraw their expedition; this withdrawal arguably prevented the Neapolitan insurgency from developing into an &quot;ulcer&quot; such as the Peninsular War in Spain beginning in 1808.

Despite the withdrawal of the British, for a time the guerrilla fighting in Calabria intensified. It was a horribly bloody affair, with the French often slaughtering whole villages, and the people massacring French prisoners. Surprisingly, Pezza proved far less ferocious than he had been in 1799. He even turned French prisoners over to the British in return for money and supplies, and once proved enormously courteous to the some French officers&#x27; wives whom he had captured. Nevertheless, the French posted a 50,000 ducat reward for anyone who killed or captured him, a sum equivalent to millions of dollars today.

=== Capture and death ===
Late in August 1806, Sir Sidney transferred Pezza and about 300 of his guerrillas by sea to the coast near Sperlonga, north of Gaeta. For a couple of weeks Pezza caused considerable trouble for the French, raiding local garrisons and ambushing convoys. On 5 September he ambushed and massacred a considerable French force near Itri. As a result, the French organized a &quot;flying column&quot;, which pinned him down near Itri on the 28th. A hot battle resulted, but the French were able to storm his position from three different directions, resulting in the defeat of Pezza&#x27;s band, which lost more than one hundred killed and about 60 taken prisoner, all of whom were immediately shot by the French. Pezza himself was reported dead, but survived.

With the remnants of his band, Pezza fled eastwards over the mountains. He was soon operating near Sora in the Abruzzi, with two thousand men and two cannon, having joined forces with other guerrilla leaders. A much stronger French force converged on his base. Pezza failed to retreat in time, and the French closed in on 24 October, storming his base camp. Most of his men were killed or captured, and Pezza was again initially thought to be dead, but he had escaped, though wounded; it was, however, to no avail. On 1 November, while at Baronissi, near Avellino, he was betrayed and captured in a pharmacy by French Corsican troops under the command of Major Joseph Léopold Sigisbert Hugo, father of the novelist Victor Hugo.

The French offered Pezza an enormous bribe if he would join them. When he refused, they tried him on charges of banditry, and sentenced him to death. The French spurned an offer by Queen Maria Carolina to exchange 200 French prisoners for him, and on 9 November they hanged him in the Piazza del Mercato at Naples, ostensibly for banditry.
Pezza&#x27;s last words reportedly were &quot;It pains me that I am condemned as a bandit and not a soldier&quot;.

Pezza&#x27;s death did not end the insurrection against the French, as it was not until 1811 that widespread resistance came to an end, and there were still sporadic outbreaks as late as 1815. Over 33,000 suspected guerrillas were arrested during the fighting, and thousands – men, women, and children alike – were killed.

==Legacy==
In addition to the works by Alexandre Dumas and Washington Irving, noted above, Pezza figures in a number of other artistic endeavors.

Daniel Auber&#x27;s opera &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot; is founded on traditions associated with the legend, but has very little historical accuracy. Laurel and Hardy starred as &quot;Stanlio&quot; and &quot;Ollio&quot; in the 1933 feature film &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Brother&quot; (sometimes titled as &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;) based on Auber&#x27;s opera.

There are several other films about Fra Diavolo, a complete listing of which may be found in the Italian Wikipedia site. The most important of these is &quot;Fra Diavolo,&quot; made in 1942 by Luigi Zampa and based on a play of the same name by Luigi Bonelli, later a prolific screenwriter. In the film, Pezza is a Robin Hood-like figure fighting the French.

The only Italian film about Pezza to be available in English is the 1964 Giovanni production, &quot;The Legend of Fra Diavolo&quot;, with an Italian cast, but starring Tony Russel, which was released in the US by Globe Films International. The film is rather more realistic than the Bonelli effort.

Paul Féval, père used the character of Fra Diavolo in his &quot;Les Habits Noirs&quot; book series. In it, Michele Bozzo (sic) is the nearly immortal Colonel Bozzo-Corana, feared leader of an international criminal brotherhood.

Fra diavolo sauce is believed to be named after Pezza.

<doc id="254921" wikidata="Q1577545" url="?curid=254921" title="Operation Nougat">
<text>Operation Nougat was a series of 44 nuclear tests conducted (with one exception) at the Nevada Test Site in 1961 and 1962, immediately after the Soviet Union abrogated a testing moratorium, with the US&#x27; &quot;Mink&quot; test shot taking place the day before the Soviets test-detonated the Tsar Bomba. Most tests were limited-yield underground test shots. New designs would be further developed in atmospheric testing during &quot;Operation Dominic I and II&quot;.

&quot;Operation Dominic I and II&quot; would follow &quot;Operation Nougat&quot;, with some testing overlap. &quot;Operation Hardtack II&quot; preceded Nougat and the testing moratorium.

==Tests==
===Antler===
Antler was the first shot fired as part of the resumption of nuclear testing by the United States. Fired 15 September 1961, containment was immediately lost when the shot vented via the tunnel portal, destroying much of the test data. This was a recurring problem for tunnel tests of the era. The problem was thought to be caused by water above the blast zone draining into the explosion cavity where it was vaporised and escaped as steam.

===Shrew===
Shrew was the first Los Alamos test after the resumption of testing. The device was buried to a depth of in a canister long. The shaft was wide, lined with steel, and backfilled with sand to above the canister and concrete to the surface. Post-test, some radioactivity was detected by sampling aircraft.

==British tests==
Some accounts include the first British nuclear weapons test at the Nevada Test Site, shot &quot;Pampas&quot;, as part of Nougat. See British nuclear testing in the United States for more details.

<text>Diamond was, according to legend, Sir Isaac Newton&#x27;s favourite dog, who, by upsetting a candle, set fire to manuscripts containing his notes on experiments conducted over the course of twenty years. According to one account, Newton is said to have exclaimed: &quot;O Diamond, Diamond, thou little knowest the mischief thou hast done.&quot; The story is largely apocryphal: according to another account, Newton simply left a window open when he went to church, and the candle was knocked over by a gust of wind. Some historians claim that Newton never owned pets.

The story of &quot;Newton&#x27;s Mischief&quot; has been reproduced over the centuries as early as 1833 in &quot;The Life of Sir Isaac Newton&quot; by David Brewster and later in &quot;St. Nicholas Magazine&quot;. In 1816 Walter Scott used the story in the third of his &quot;Waverley Novels&quot;, &quot;The Antiquary&quot; (volume 2, chapter 1).

This pet of Newton&#x27;s was also mentioned in Thomas Carlyle&#x27;s book &quot;The French Revolution: A History&quot;, employed in discussing the deathbed of Louis XV. Carlyle writes &quot;To the eye of History many things, in that sick room of Louis, are now visible, which to the courtiers there present were invisible. For indeed it has been well said, &#x27;in every object there is inexhaustible meaning; the eye sees in it what the eye brings means of seeing.&#x27; To Newton and to Newton&#x27;s dog Diamond, what a different pair of Universes; while the painting on the optical retina of both was, most likely, the same!&quot;

Nevertheless, Diamond is the subject of several anecdotes concerning Newton. In another tale, Newton is said to have claimed that the dog discovered two theorems in a single morning. He added, however, that &quot;one had a mistake and the other had a pathological exception.&quot;

<text>A band-pass filter or bandpass filter (BPF) is a device that passes frequencies within a certain range and rejects (attenuates) frequencies outside that range.
It is the inverse of a &quot;band-stop filter&quot;.

==Description==
In electronics and signal processing, a filter is usually a two-port circuit or device which removes frequency components of a signal (an alternating voltage or current). A band-pass filter allows through components in a specified band of frequencies, called its &quot;passband&quot; but blocks components with frequencies above or below this band. This contrasts with a high-pass filter, which allows through components with frequencies above a specific frequency, and a low-pass filter, which allows through components with frequencies below a specific frequency. In digital signal processing, in which signals represented by digital numbers are processed by computer programs, a band-pass filter is a computer algorithm that performs the same function. The term band-pass filter is also used for optical filters, sheets of colored material which allow through a specific band of light frequencies, commonly used in photography and theatre lighting, and acoustic filters which allow through sound waves of a specific band of frequencies.

An example of an analogue electronic band-pass filter is an RLC circuit (a resistor–inductor–capacitor circuit). These filters can also be created by combining a low-pass filter with a high-pass filter.

A &quot;bandpass signal&quot; is a signal containing a band of frequencies not adjacent to zero frequency, such as a signal that comes out of a bandpass filter.

An ideal bandpass filter would have a completely flat passband: all frequencies within the passband would be passed to the output without amplification or attenuation, and would completely attenuate all frequencies outside the passband.

In practice, no bandpass filter is ideal. The filter does not attenuate all frequencies outside the desired frequency range completely; in particular, there is a region just outside the intended passband where frequencies are attenuated, but not rejected. This is known as the filter roll-off, and it is usually expressed in dB of attenuation per octave or decade of frequency. Generally, the design of a filter seeks to make the roll-off as narrow as possible, thus allowing the filter to perform as close as possible to its intended design. Often, this is achieved at the expense of pass-band or stop-band &quot;ripple&quot;.
The bandwidth of the filter is simply the difference between the upper and lower cutoff frequencies. The shape factor is the ratio of bandwidths measured using two different attenuation values to determine the cutoff frequency, e.g., a shape factor of 2:1 at 30/3 dB means the bandwidth measured between frequencies at 30 dB attenuation is twice that measured between frequencies at 3 dB attenuation.

== Q factor ==

A band-pass filter can be characterized by its factor. The -factor is the reciprocal of the fractional bandwidth. A high- filter will have a narrow passband and a low- filter will have a wide passband. These are respectively referred to as &quot;narrow-band&quot; and &quot;wide-band&quot; filters.

==Applications==
Bandpass filters are widely used in wireless transmitters and receivers. The main function of such a filter in a transmitter is to limit the bandwidth of the output signal to the band allocated for the transmission. This prevents the transmitter from interfering with other stations. In a receiver, a bandpass filter allows signals within a selected range of frequencies to be heard or decoded, while preventing signals at unwanted frequencies from getting through. Signals at frequencies outside the band which the receiver is tuned at, can either saturate or damage the receiver. Additionally they can create unwanted mixing products that fall in band and interfere with the signal of interest. Wideband receivers are particularly susceptible to such interference. A bandpass filter also optimizes the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity of a receiver.

In both transmitting and receiving applications, well-designed bandpass filters, having the optimum bandwidth for the mode and speed of communication being used, maximize the number of signal transmitters that can exist in a system, while minimizing the interference or competition among signals.

Outside of electronics and signal processing, one example of the use of band-pass filters is in the atmospheric sciences. It is common to band-pass filter recent meteorological data with a period range of, for example, 3 to 10 days, so that only cyclones remain as fluctuations in the data fields.

===Loudspeaker enclosures===
==== Compound or band-pass ====

A 4th order electrical bandpass filter can be simulated by a vented box in which the contribution from the rear face of the driver cone is trapped in a sealed box, and the radiation from the front surface of the cone is into a ported chamber. This modifies the resonance of the driver. In its simplest form a compound enclosure has two chambers. The dividing wall between the chambers holds the driver; typically only one chamber is ported.

If the enclosure on each side of the woofer has a port in it then the enclosure yields a 6th order band-pass response. These are considerably harder to design and tend to be very sensitive to driver characteristics. As in other reflex enclosures, the ports may generally be replaced by passive radiators if desired.

An eighth order bandpass box is another variation which also has a narrow frequency range. They are often used in sound pressure level competitions, in which case a bass tone of a specific frequency would be used versus anything musical. They are complicated to build and must be done quite precisely in order to perform nearly as intended.

===Economics===

Bandpass filters can also be used outside of engineering-related disciplines. A leading example is the use of bandpass filters to extract the business cycle component in economic time series. This reveals more clearly the expansions and contractions in economic activity that dominate the lives of the public and the performance of diverse firms, and therefore is of interest to a wide audience of economists and policy-makers, among others.

Economic data usually has quite different statistical properties than data in say, electrical engineering. It is very common for a researcher to directly carry over traditional methods such as the &quot;ideal&quot; filter, which has a perfectly sharp gain function in the frequency domain. However, in doing so, substantial problems can arise that can cause distortions and make the filter output extremely misleading. As a poignant and simple case, the use of an &quot;ideal&quot; filter on white noise (which could represent for example stock price changes) creates a false cycle. The use of the nomenclature &quot;ideal&quot; implicitly involves a greatly fallacious assumption except on scarce occasions. Nevertheless, the use of the &quot;ideal&quot; filter remains common despite its limitations.

Fortunately, band-pass filters are available that steer clear of such errors, adapt to the data series at hand, and yield more accurate assessments of the business cycle fluctuations in major economic series like Real GDP, Investment, and Consumption - as well as their sub-components. An early work, published in the Review of Economics and Statistics in 2003, more effectively handles the kind of data (stochastic rather than deterministic) arising in macroeconomics. In this paper entitled &quot;General Model-Based Filters for Extracting Trends and Cycles in Economic Time Series&quot;, Andrew Harvey and Thomas Trimbur develop a class of adaptive band pass filters. These have been successfully applied in various situations involving business cycle movements in myriad nations in the international economy.

=== 4G and 5G wireless communications ===
Band pass filters can be implemented in 4G and 5G wireless communication systems. Hussaini et al.(2015) stated that, in the application of wireless communication, radio frequency noise is a major concern. In the current development of 5G technology, planer band pass filters are used to suppress RF noises and removing unwanted signals.

Combine, hairpin, parallel-coupled line, step impedance and stub impedance are the designs of experimenting the band pass filter to achieve low insertion loss with a compact size. The necessity of adopting asymmetric frequency response is in behalf of reducing the number of resonators, insertion loss, size and cost of circuit production.

4-pole cross-coupled band pass filter is designed by Hussaini et al.(2015). This band pass filter is designed to cover the 2.5-2.6  GHz and 3.4-3.7  GHz spectrum for the 4G and 5G wireless communication applications respectively. It is developed and extended from 3-pole single-band band pass filter, where an additional resonator is applied to a 3-pole single-band band pass filter. The advanced band pass filter has a compact size with a simple structure, which is convenient for implementation. Moreover, the stop band rejection and selectivity present a good performance in RF noise suppression. Insertion loss is very low when covering the 4G and 5G spectrum, while providing good return loss and group delay.

=== Energy scavengers ===
Energy scavengers are devices that search for energy from the environment efficiently. Band pass filters can be implemented to energy scavengers by converting energy generated from vibration into electric energy. The band pass filter designed by Shahruz (2005), is an ensemble of cantilever beams, which is called the beam-mass system. Ensemble of beam-mass systems can be transformed into a band pass filter when appropriate dimensions of beams and masses are chosen. Although the process of designing a mechanical band pass filter is advanced, further study and work are still required to design more flexible band pass filters to suit large frequency intervals. This mechanical band pass filter could be used on vibration sources with distinct peak-power frequencies.

===Other fields===

In neuroscience, visual cortical simple cells were first shown by David Hubel and Torsten Wiesel to have response properties that resemble Gabor filters, which are band-pass.

In astronomy, band-pass filters are used to allow only a single portion of the light spectrum into an instrument. Band-pass filters can help with finding where stars lie on the main sequence, identifying redshifts, and many other applications.

<text>Dr. Martens, also known as Doc Martens, Docs, or DMs, is a British footwear and clothing brand. Although most known for its footwear, it also makes a range of accessories, including clothing and bags. The footwear is distinguished by its air-cushioned sole, upper shape, welted construction, and yellow stitching. The company&#x27;s global head office and design studio is located in Camden Town, London. 

Dr. Martens manufactures in the UK (at the brand&#x27;s historic Cobbs lane factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire), China, Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand. The company is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is a constituent of the FTSE 250 Index. According to the BBC, &quot;the company still makes more than half of its revenues from the original &quot;1460&quot; boot and sister product the &quot;1461&quot; shoe. The numbers refer to the dates they were introduced — 1 April 1960 and 1961.&quot;

==History==
=== Founding ===
Klaus Märtens was a doctor in the German Army during World War II. After he injured his ankle, while skiing, in 1945, he found that his standard-issue army boots were too uncomfortable on his injured foot. While recuperating, he designed improvements to the boots, with soft leather and air-padded soles made of tyres. When the war ended and Germans looted valuables from their own cities, Märtens purchased leather from a shoemaker&#x27;s shop. With that leather he made himself a pair of boots with air-cushioned soles.

In 1947, Märtens did not have much success selling his shoes until he met up with an old university friend Herbert Funck in Munich. Funck was intrigued by the new shoe design, and the two went into business that year in Seeshaupt, Germany, using discarded rubber shaped by moulds. The comfortable soles were a big hit with housewives, with 80 percent of sales in the first decade to women over the age of 40.

=== Expansion in the United Kingdom ===

Sales had grown so much by 1952 that they opened a factory in Munich. In 1959, the company had grown large enough that Märtens and Funck looked at marketing the footwear internationally. Almost immediately, British shoe manufacturer R. Griggs Group bought patent rights to manufacture the shoes in the United Kingdom. The R. Griggs Group anglicised the company name to &quot;Dr. Martens&quot;. The heel was reshaped for a better fit and the trademark yellow stitching was added. The sole was formally trademarked.

The first Dr. Martens boot in the UK with an eight-eyelet cherry-red coloured smooth leather design became known as &quot;style 1460&quot; and are still in production today. There are now many variations of this classic design which was introduced on 1 April 1960. The three-eyelet shoe was issued exactly one year later with the style number &quot;1461&quot;. The original &quot;1460&quot; and &quot;1461&quot; remain the company&#x27;s best-selling DMs. The Dr. Martens boots were made in their Cobbs Lane factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire, where they continued to be made, in addition to production elsewhere, until at least 2018. Jane Schaffer, senior lecturer in footwear and accessories at the University of Northampton, says the classic range has &quot;become iconic&quot;. 
In addition a number of shoe manufacturers in the Northamptonshire area and further afield produced the boots under licence, as long as they passed quality standards. The boots were popular among workers such as postmen, police officers and factory workers. By the later 1960s, skinheads started to wear them, &quot;Docs&quot; or &quot;DMs&quot; being the usual naming, and by the late 1970s, they were popular among scooter riders, punks, some new wave musicians, and members of other youth subcultures. The shoes&#x27; popularity among politically right-wing skinheads led to the brand gaining an association with violence. Alexei Sayle sang the song &quot;Dr. Martens&#x27; Boots&quot; in a 1982 episode of the TV comedy &quot;The Young Ones&quot;.
In 1989, the Accent Group became the first manufacturer of Dr. Martens outside the UK, obtaining the rights to make them in Dunedin, New Zealand, which they did for several years. The boots and shoes became popular in the 1990s as grunge fashion arose. In late November 1994, a six-storey Dr. Martens department store was opened in Covent Garden in London which also sold food, belts, and watches. At this time the R. Griggs company employed 2,700 people, expected to earn annual revenue of £170 million, and could produce up to 10 million pairs of shoes per year.

=== Sponsorship ===
The Dr. Martens company sponsored Rushden &amp; Diamonds F.C. from 1998 to 2005. Diamonds approached owner and local businessman Max Griggs to request sponsorship from his company. A new main stand was built at Nene Park in 2001, named the Airwair Stand. Dr. Martens were also the principal sponsors of Premier League club, West Ham United F.C. from 1998 to 2003, renaming the upgraded west stand &#x27;The Dr Martens Stand&#x27;.

=== Trademark disputes ===
In 1999, Dr. Martens fought lawsuits in US courts. The brand filed a number of lawsuits in 2016 based primarily on trademark law.

=== Expansion ===

In the 2000s, Dr. Martens were sold exclusively under the AirWair name in dozens of different styles, including conventional black shoes, sandals and steel-toed boots. AirWair International Ltd revenue fell from $412 million in 1999 to $127 million in 2006. In 2003 the Dr. Martens company came close to bankruptcy. On 1 April that year, under pressure from declining sales, the company ceased making shoes in the UK, and moved all production to China and Thailand. Five factories and two shops were closed in the UK, and more than of the firm&#x27;s employees lost their jobs. Following the closures, the R. Griggs company employed only 20 people in the UK, all in the firm&#x27;s head office. Five million pairs of Dr. Martens were sold during 2003, half the 1990s level of sales.

In 2004, a new range of Dr. Martens was launched in an attempt to appeal to a wider market, especially young people. The shoes and boots were intended to be more comfortable, and easier to break in, and included some new design elements. Dr. Martens also began producing footwear again at the Cobbs Lane Factory in Wollaston, England in 2004 as part of the &quot;Vintage&quot; line, which the company advertises as being made to the original specifications. Sales of these shoes are low in comparison to those made in Asia, however; in 2010, the factory was producing about 50 pairs per day. In 2005, under turnaround CEO David Suddens the R. Griggs company was given an award by the &quot;Institute for Turnaround&quot; for implementing a successful restructure.

In 2006, the &quot;1460&quot; Dr. Martens AirWair boot was named in the list of British design icons, alongside the Mini.

Worldwide sales of Dr. Martens shoes grew strongly in the early 2010s, and in 2012 it was the eighth-fastest-growing British company. Over 100 million pairs of Dr. Martens shoes were sold from 1960 to 2010, and in 2010 the company offered 250 different models of footwear. The R. Griggs company opened fourteen new Dr. Martens retail stores in the United Kingdom, United States and Hong Kong between 2009 and 2011, and also launched a line of clothing during 2011.

=== Private equity investment ===
The private equity company Permira acquired R. Griggs Group Limited, the owner of the Dr. Martens brand, for £300 million in October 2013. For a time Dr. Martens footwear was sold under a &quot;for life&quot; scheme, under which it would repair or replace worn-out DM shoes forever for a price somewhat more than twice the normal price for a pair. This offer was available in 2016, but was withdrawn for new sales from May 2018. After Permira purchased Dr. Martens the former brand president of Vans was hired as CEO.

=== Production issues ===

In 2018, ten million pairs of Dr. Martens shoes were produced, only one percent in the UK. Annual revenue in 2019 was £454 million, six times more than in 2013. The most popular model remained the 1460 boots. In 2019 Dr. Martens announced plans to double the production of shoes and boots in the UK, to 165,000 pairs annually in 2020. Dr Martens&#x27; design studio is in Camden Town, London.

In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported concerns that the quality of Dr. Martens shoes had declined since either production was moved to Asia or Permira acquired the brand. Many of the newspaper&#x27;s readers reported that recently produced Dr. Martens products did not last as long as older production. The company responded that there had been no change in the materials used or production processes since manufacturing was moved to Asia, and only 0.5% of its footwear was defective.

In January 2022, the Dr. Martens factory in Wollaston, Northamptonshire featured on the BBC programme &quot;Inside the Factory&quot;; Series 6, Leather boots.

=== Listing on the London Stock Exchange ===
Dr. Martens was listed on the London Stock Exchange at a value of £3.7 billion in January 2021.

== Subcultural significance ==

Described by Lauren Cochrane of &quot;The Guardian&quot; as &quot;fashion&#x27;s subversive smash hit&quot;, Dr. Martens have garnered significant following and ownership within various subcultures since the brand was established in England in 1960, including punk, goth, Gen x, LGBT, grunge, Britpop, nu-metal and early emo.

Notable customers of the brand have included Pete Townshend of the Who, who according to the BBC &quot;became the first high-profile person to wear them, as a symbol of his own working-class pride and rebellious attitude&quot;, Sex Pistols, the Clash, the Cure, Madness, Pope John Paul II, Miley Cyrus, Rihanna, Madonna, Spice Girls, Avril Lavigne, Gwen Stefani and the 14th Dalai Lama. Under John Paul II, the Swiss Guard were provided with Dr. Martens boots. In the 1975 British rock musical fantasy film &quot;Tommy&quot;, Elton John wore 4ft 6in (137cm) DMs.

<doc id="254938" wikidata="Q40847" url="?curid=254938" title="Scissors">
<text>Scissors are hand-operated shearing tools. A pair of scissors consists of a pair of blades pivoted so that the sharpened edges slide against each other when the handles (bows) opposite to the pivot are closed. Scissors are used for cutting various thin materials, such as paper, cardboard, metal foil, cloth, rope, and wire. A large variety of scissors and shears all exist for specialized purposes. Hair-cutting shears and kitchen shears are functionally equivalent to scissors, but the larger implements tend to be called shears. Hair-cutting shears have specific blade angles ideal for cutting hair. Using the incorrect type of scissors to cut hair will result in increased damage or split ends, or both, by breaking the hair. Kitchen shears, also known as kitchen scissors, are intended for cutting and trimming foods such as meats.

Inexpensive, mass-produced modern scissors are often designed ergonomically with composite thermoplastic and rubber handles.

==Terminology==
The noun &quot;scissors&quot; is treated as a plural noun, and therefore takes a plural verb (e.g., &quot;these scissors are&quot;). Alternatively, the tool is referred to by the singular phrase &quot;a pair of scissors&quot;. The word &quot;shears&quot; is used to describe similar instruments that are larger in size and for heavier cutting.

==History==

The earliest known scissors appeared in Mesopotamia 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. These were of the &#x27;spring scissor&#x27; type comprising two bronze blades connected at the handles by a thin, flexible strip of curved bronze which served to hold the blades in alignment, to allow them to be squeezed together, and to pull them apart when released.

Spring scissors continued to be used in Europe until the 16th century. However, pivoted scissors of bronze or iron, in which the blades were pivoted at a point between the tips and the handles, the direct ancestor of modern scissors, were invented by the Romans around 100 AD. They entered common use in not only ancient Rome, but also China, Japan, and Korea, and the idea is still used in almost all modern scissors.

===Early manufacture===
During the Middle Ages and Renaissance, spring scissors were made by heating a bar of iron or steel, then flattening and shaping its ends into blades on an anvil. The center of the bar was heated, bent to form the spring, then cooled and reheated to make it flexible.

The Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan Company in Hangzhou, China, has been manufacturing scissors since 1663.

William Whiteley &amp; Sons (Sheffield) Ltd. was producing scissors by 1760, although it is believed the business began trading even earlier. The first trade-mark, 332, was granted in 1791. The company is still manufacturing scissors today, and is the oldest company in the West to do so.

Pivoted scissors were not manufactured in large numbers until 1761, when Robert Hinchliffe of Sheffield produced the first pair of modern-day scissors made of hardened and polished cast steel. His major challenge was to form the bows; first, he made them solid, then drilled a hole, and then filed away metal to make this large enough to admit the user&#x27;s fingers. This process was laborious, and apparently Hinchliffe improved upon it in order to increase production. Hinchliffe lived in Cheney Square (now the site of Sheffield Town Hall), and set up a sign identifying himself as a &quot;fine scissor manufacturer&quot;. He achieved strong sales in London and elsewhere.

During the 19th century, scissors were hand-forged with elaborately decorated handles. They were made by hammering steel on indented surfaces known as &#x27;bosses&#x27; to form the blades. The rings in the handles, known as bows, were made by punching a hole in the steel and enlarging it with the pointed end of an anvil.

In 1649, in Swedish-ruled Finland, an ironworks was founded in the village of Fiskars between Helsinki and Turku. In 1830, a new owner started the first cutlery works in Finland, making, among other items, scissors with the Fiskars trademark.

===Modern manufacturing regions===

====China====

The vast majority of global scissor manufacturing takes place in China. As of 2019, China was responsible for 64.3% of worldwide scissors exports. When combined with Chinese Taipei exports, this rises to 68.3%. The primary scissors producing region in China is in Guandong Province.

The Hangzhou Zhang Xiaoquan Company, founded in 1663, is one of the oldest continuously operating scissor manufacturers in the world. The company was nationalized in 1958 and now employs 1500 people who annually mass-produce an estimated seven million pairs of inexpensive scissors that retail for an average of US$4 each.

====France====

In the late 14th century, the English word &quot;scissors&quot; came into usage. It was derived from the Old French word , which referred to shears.

There are several historically important scissor-producing regions in France: Haute-Marne in Nogent-en Bassigny, Châtellereault, Thiers and Rouen. These towns, like many other scissor-producing communities, began with sabre, sword and bayonet production, which transitioned to scissors and other blades in the late 18th and early 19th centuries.

Thiers, in the Puy-de-Dôme department of Auvergne, remains an important centre of scissor and cutlery production. It is home to both the Musée de la Coutellerie, which showcases the town&#x27;s 800-year history of blade-making, as well as Coutellia, an industry tradeshow that advertises itself as one of the largest annual gatherings of artisanal blade-makers in the world.

====Germany====

Germany was responsible for manufacturing just under 7% of global scissors exports in 2019. Often called &quot;The City of Blades&quot;, Solingen, in North Rhine-Westphalia, has been a center for the manufacturing of scissors since medieval times. At the end of the 18th century it&#x27;s estimated that there were over 300 scissorsmiths in Solingen.

In 1995 the City of Solingen passed The Solingen Ordinance, an update to a 1930s law that decreed &quot;Made in Solingen&quot; stamps could only be applied to products almost entirely manufactured in the old industrial area of Solingen. In 2019 this applied to approximately 150 companies making high-quality blades of all kinds, including scissors.

Friedrich Herder, founded in Solingen in 1727, is one of the oldest scissors manufacturers still operating in Germany.

====Italy====

Premana, in Lecco Province, has its origins in ironworks and knife manufacturing beginning in the 16th century. In 1900 there were ten scissor manufacturing workshops, 20 in 1952 and 48 by 1960. Today, Consorzio Premax, an industrial partnership, organizes over 60 local companies involved in the manufacture of scissors for global markets. In 2019 Italy exported 3.5% of scissors manufactured globally.

One of the oldest Premanese scissor manufacturing firms still in operation is Sanelli Ambrogio, which was founded in 1869.

====Japan====

Scissormaking in Japan evolved from sword making in the 14th century. Seki, in Gifu Prefecture, was a renowned center of swordmaking beginning in the 1200s. After citizens were no longer permitted to carry swords, the city&#x27;s blacksmiths turned to making scissors and knives. There are many specialized types of Japanese scissors, but sewing scissors were introduced by American Commodore Matthew Perry from the United States in 1854.

The Sasuke workshop in Sakai City south of Osaka is run by Yasuhiro Hirakawa, a 5th generation scissorsmith. The company has been in operation since 1867. Yasuhiro Hirakawa is the last traditional scissormaker in Japan, making scissors in the traditional style where the blades are believed to be thinner, lighter and sharper than European scissors. In 2018 he was profiled in a documentary that featured a pair of his bonsai snips which retailed for US$35,000.

====Spain====

In Solsona, Spain, scissor manufacturing began in the 16th century. At the industry&#x27;s peak in the 18th century there were 24 workshops, organized as the Guild of Saint Eligius, the patron saint of knife makers. By the mid-1980s there were only two, and by 2021, Pallarès Solsona, founded in 1917 by Lluìs and Carles Pallarès Canal, and still family-operated, was the town&#x27;s sole remaining artisanal scissor manufacturer.

====United Kingdom====

Sheffield was home to the first mass production of scissors beginning in 1761. By the 19th century there were an estimated 60 steel scissor companies in Sheffield. However, since the 1980s, industry globalization and a shift towards cheaper, mass-produced scissors created price deflation that many artisanal manufacturers could not compete with. The Sheffield scissor industry consisted of just two local companies in 2021.

The two remaining Sheffield scissor manufacturers are William Whiteley, founded in 1760, and Ernest Wright, which was established in 1902. Both now focus on high-end/niche crafting of &quot;products for life&quot; rather than mass production. Between these two firms it is estimated that there are no more than ten &quot;putter-togetherers&quot; or &quot;putters&quot; who are the master-trained craftspeople responsible for high quality Sheffield scissor assembly. In 2020, Ernest Wright was recognized with the Award for Endangered Crafts by the British Heritage Crafts Association.

==Description and operation==

A pair of scissors consists of two pivoted blades. In lower-quality scissors, the cutting edges are not particularly sharp; it is primarily the shearing action between the two blades that cuts the material. In high-quality scissors, the blades can be both extremely sharp, and tension sprung – to increase the cutting and shearing tension only at the exact point where the blades meet. The hand movement (pushing with the thumb, pulling with the fingers) can add to this tension. An ideal example is in high-quality tailor&#x27;s scissors or shears, which need to be able to perfectly cut (and not simply tear apart) delicate cloths such as chiffon and silk.

Children&#x27;s scissors are usually not particularly sharp, and the tips of the blades are often blunted or &#x27;rounded&#x27; for safety.

Mechanically, scissors are a first-class double-lever with the pivot acting as the . For cutting thick or heavy material, the mechanical advantage of a lever can be exploited by placing the material to be cut as close to the fulcrum as possible. For example, if the applied force (at the handles) is twice as far away from the fulcrum as the cutting location (i.e., the point of contact between the blades), the force at the cutting location is twice that of the applied force at the handles. Scissors cut material by applying at the cutting location a local shear stress which exceeds the material&#x27;s shear strength.

Some scissors have an appendage, called a finger brace or finger tang, below the index finger hole for the middle finger to rest on to provide for better control and more power in precision cutting. A finger tang can be found on many quality scissors (including inexpensive ones) and especially on scissors for cutting hair (see hair scissors pictured below). In hair cutting, some claim the ring finger is inserted where some place their index finger, and the little finger rests on the finger tang.

For people who do not have the use of their hands, there are specially designed foot-operated scissors. Some quadriplegics can use a motorized mouth-operated style of scissor.

== Right-handed and left-handed scissors ==

Most scissors are best suited for use with the right hand, but &quot;left-handed&quot; scissors are designed for use with the left hand. Because scissors have overlapping blades, they are not symmetric. This asymmetry is true regardless of the orientation and shape of the handles and blades: the blade that is on top always forms the same diagonal regardless of orientation. Human hands are asymmetric, and when closing the scissors the thumb and fingers do not close vertically, but have a lateral component to the motion. Specifically, the thumb pushes out from the palm and the fingers pull inwards. For right-handed scissors held in the right hand, the thumb blade is closer to the user&#x27;s body, so that the natural tendency of the right hand is to push the cutting blades together. Conversely, if right-handed scissors are held in the left hand, the natural tendency of the left hand would be to push the cutting blades apart. Furthermore, with right-handed scissors held by the right hand, the shearing edge is visible, but when they are used with the left hand, the cutting edge of the scissors is behind the top blade, and the cutter cannot see what is being cut.

There are two varieties of left-handed scissors. Many common left-handed scissors (often called &quot;semi&quot;-left-handed scissors) simply have reversed finger grips. The blades open and close as with right-handed scissors, so that users tend to pull the blades apart as they are cutting. This can be challenging for craftspeople as the blades still obscure the cut. &quot;True&quot; left-handed scissors have both reversed finger grips and reversed blade layout, like mirror images of right-handed scissors. A left-handed person accustomed to using semi-left handed scissors may find using true left-handed scissors difficult at first, as they may have learned to rely heavily on the strength of their thumb to pull the blades apart vs. pushing the blades together in order to cut.

Some scissors are marketed as ambidextrous. These have symmetric handles so there is no distinction between the thumb and finger handles, and have very strong pivots so that the blades rotate without any lateral give. However, most &quot;ambidextrous&quot; scissors are in fact still right-handed in that the upper blade is on the right, and hence is on the outside when held in the right hand. Even if they cut successfully, the blade orientation will block the view of the cutting line for a left-handed person. True ambidextrous scissors are possible if the blades are double-edged and one handle is swung all the way around (to almost 360 degrees) so that what were the backs of the blades become the new cutting edges. was awarded for true ambidextrous scissors.

If the bridegroom answered to his name being called, the scissors would then be snapped shut and the bridegroom would be unable to consummate his marriage with his bride.
*Asia
**In Pakistan, some believe that scissors should never be idly opened and closed without purpose; this is believed to cause bad luck.

<text>A hinge is a mechanical bearing that connects two solid objects, typically allowing only a limited angle of rotation between them. Two objects connected by an ideal hinge rotate relative to each other about a fixed axis of rotation, with all other translations or rotations prevented; thus a hinge has one degree of freedom. Hinges may be made of flexible material or moving components. In biology, many joints function as hinges, such as the elbow joint.

==History==
Ancient remains of stone, marble, wood, and bronze hinges have been found. Some date back to at least Ancient Egypt, although it is nearly impossible pinpoint exactly where and when the first hinges were used.

In Ancient Rome, hinges were called and gave name to the goddess Cardea and the main street Cardo. This name cardō lives on figuratively today as &quot;the chief thing (on which something turns or depends)&quot; in words such as &quot;&quot;.

According to the Oxford English Dictionary, the English word &quot;hinge&quot; is related to &quot;&quot;.

==Door hinges==

; Barrel hinge: A barrel hinge consists of a sectional barrel (the &quot;knuckle&quot;) secured by a pivot. A &quot;barrel&quot; is simply a hollow cylinder. The vast majority of hinges operate on the barrel principle.

; Butt hinge / Mortise hinge: Any hinge designed to be set into a door frame and/or door is considered a butt hinge or mortise hinge. A hinge can also be made as a half-mortise, where only one half is mortised and the other is not. Most mortise hinges are also barrel hinges because of how they pivot (i.e., a pair of leaves secured to each other by knuckles through which runs a pin).

; Butterfly / Parliament (UK) hinge: A decorative variety of barrel hinge with leaves somewhat resembling the wings of a butterfly. 

; Case hinge: Similar to butt hinges, but usually more decorative; most commonly used in suitcases, briefcases, and the like. 

;Concealed hinge: Used for furniture doors (with or without a self-closing features and/or damping systems), they consist of two parts: (1.) the &quot;cup&quot; and &quot;arm&quot;, and (2.) the mounting plate. They are also called &quot;cup hinges&quot;, or &quot;Euro hinges&quot;, as they were developed in Europe and use metric installation standards. Most concealed hinges offer the advantage of full &quot;in situ&quot; adjustability for standoff distance from the cabinet face, as well as pitch and roll by means of two screws on each hinge.

; Continuous / Piano hinge: This variety of barrel hinge runs the entire length of a door, panel, box, etc. They are manufactured with or without holes.

; Flag hinge: A simple two-part hinge, where a single leaf, attached to a pin, is inserted into a leaf with a hole. This allows the hinged objects to be easily removed (such as removable doors). They are made in right- and left-hand configurations.

;H hinge: These H-shaped barrel hinges are used on flush-mounted doors. Small H hinges () tend to be used for cabinets, while larger ones () are for passage doors and closet doors.

; HL hinge: Commonly used for passage doors, room doors, and closet doors in the 17th, 18th, and the 19th centuries. On taller doors, H hinges were occasionally used between them.

; Pivot hinge: This hinge pivots in openings in the floor and the top of the door frame. Also referred to as double-acting floor hinges, they are found in ancient dry stone buildings and, rarely, in old wooden buildings. They are a low-cost alternative for use with lightweight doors. Doors with these hinges may be called haar-hung doors.

; Self-closing hinge: This is a spring-loaded hinge with a speed control function. The same as &quot;spring hinge&quot;, usually use &quot;spring&quot; to provide force to close the door and provide a mechanical or hydraulic damper to control door close speed. That can prevent door slamming problem while auto closes a door.

;Spring hinge: A spring-loaded hinge that provides assistance in closing or opening the hinge leaves. An inner spring applies force to keep the hinge closed or opened.

;Swing Clear hinge: Also called &quot;offset door hinges&quot;, they are ideal for residential and commercial doors, they allow doors to swing completely clear of their openings. They can easily comply with Fair Housing Act (FHA) code by providing a minimum ADA 32” clearance when using a 34” door slab.
;Living hinge: A hinge of flexible plastic that creates a join between two objects without any knuckles or pins. Molded as a single piece, they never rust or squeak, and have several other advantages over other hinges, but are more susceptible to breakage.

Other types of hinges include:
*Coach
*Counter Flap
*Cranked or storm-proof
*Double action non-spring
*Double action spring
*Flush

==Building access==
Since at least medieval times, there have been hinges to draw bridges for defensive purposes for fortified buildings. Hinges are used in contemporary architecture where building settlement can be expected over the life of the building. For example, the Dakin Building in Brisbane, California, was designed with its entrance ramp on a large hinge to allow settlement of the building built on piles over bay mud. This device was effective until October 2006, when it was replaced due to damage and excessive ramp slope.

==Large structures==
Hinges appear in large structures such as elevated freeway and railroad viaducts, to reduce or eliminate the transfer of bending stresses between structural components, typically in an effort to reduce sensitivity to earthquakes. The primary reason for using a hinge, rather than a simpler device such as a slide, is to prevent the separation of adjacent components. When no bending stresses are transmitted across the hinge, it is called a &quot;zero moment hinge&quot;.

== Spacecraft ==

A variety of self-actuating, self-locking hinges have been developed for spacecraft deployable structures such as solar array panels, synthetic aperture radar antennas, booms, radiators, etc.

==Terminology==

===Components===
;Pin: The rod that holds the &quot;leaves&quot; together, inside the &quot;knuckle&quot;. Also known as a pintle.
;Knuckle: The hollow—typically circular—portion creating the joint of the hinge through which the &quot;pin&quot; is set. The &quot;knuckles&quot; of either &quot;leaf&quot; typically alternate and interlock with the &quot;pin&quot; passing through all of them. (aka. loop, joint, node or curl)
;Leaf: The portions (typically two) that extend laterally from the &quot;knuckle&quot; and typically revolve around the &quot;pin&quot;.

===Characteristics===
; End play: Axial movement between the &quot;leaves&quot; along the axis of the &quot;pin&quot;. This motion allows the leaves to rotate without binding and is determined by the typical distance between &quot;knuckles&quot; (knuckle gap) when both edges of the &quot;leaves&quot; are aligned.
; Gauge: Thickness of the &quot;leaves&quot;.
;Hinge width: Length from the outer edge of one &quot;leaf&quot; to the outer edge of the other &quot;leaf&quot;, perpendicularly across the &quot;pin&quot; (aka open width).
; Hinge length: The length of the &quot;leaves&quot; parallel to the pin.
; Knuckle length: The typical length of an individual &quot;knuckle&quot; parallel to the pin.
; Leaf width: Length from the center of the &quot;pin&quot; to the outer edge of the &quot;leaf&quot;.
; Pitch: Distance from the end of a knuckle to the same edge of its adjacent knuckle on the same leaf
; Door Stop: A colloquialism referring to loose angular movement of the leaves relative to the pin.

==Other types==
;Butler tray hinge: Folds to 90 degrees and also snaps flat. They are for tables that have a tray top for serving.
;Card table hinge: Mortised into edge of antique or reproduction card tables and allow the top to fold onto itself.
;Carpentier joint: A hinge consisting of several thin metal strips of curved cross section.
;Drop-leaf table hinge: Mounted under the surface of a table with leaves that drop down. They are most commonly used with rule joints.
;Hinged expansion joint: an expansion joint with hinges that allow the unit to bend in a single plane
;Hinged handcuffs: a restraint device designed to secure an individual&#x27;s wrists in proximity to each other consisting of two cuffs linked with a double or triple hinge. Hinged handcuffs cuffs tend to restrict movement more than chain-linked handcuffs, and they can be used to generate more leverage to force a suspect&#x27;s hands behind the back, or to apply pain against the wrist, forcing the subject to comply and stop resisting.
;Hinge region: portion of antibody structure between the fragment antigen-binding region and the fragment crystallizable region
;Living hinge: a hinge consisting of material that flexes
;Piano hinge: (or coffin hinge) a long hinge, originally used for piano lids, but now used in many other applications where a long hinge is needed.

<text>Fort-de-France (, , ; ) is a commune and the capital city of Martinique, an overseas department and region of France located in the Caribbean.

==History==

In 1638, Jacques Dyel du Parquet (1606–1658), nephew of Pierre Belain d&#x27;Esnambuc and first governor of Martinique, decided to have Fort Saint Louis built to protect the city against enemy attacks. The fort was soon destroyed, and rebuilt in 1669, when Louis XIV appointed the Marquis of Baas as governor general. Under his orders and those of his successors, particularly the Count of Blénac, the fort was built with a Vauban design.

Originally named Fort-Royal, the administrative capital of Martinique was over-shadowed by Saint-Pierre, the oldest city in the island, which was renowned for its commercial and cultural vibrancy as &quot;The Paris of the Caribbean&quot;.

The name of Fort-Royal was changed to a short-lived &quot;Fort-La-Republique&quot; during the French Revolution, and finally settled as Fort-de-France sometime in the 19th century. The old name of Fort-Royal is still used today familiarly in its Creole language form of &quot;Foyal&quot;, with the inhabitants of the city being &quot;Foyalais&quot;.

The city was captured by a British expedition which captured Martinique in 1762, but the island was returned to French control in the Treaty of Paris. In 1839, the city was struck by a minor earthquake and 1890 saw an outbreak of fire which razed part of the city. The Hôtel de Ville (town hall) was completed in 1901.

By the turn of the 20th century, however, Fort-de-France became economically important after the volcanic eruption of Mount Pelée destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre in 1902.

Until 1918, when its commercial growth began, Fort-de-France had an inadequate water supply, was partly surrounded by swamps, and was notorious for yellow fever. Now the swamps are drained to make room for extensive suburbs.

On 3 August 1945, Fort-de-France&#x27;s hydrobase became the site of Martinique&#x27;s first fatal airliner crash. A Sikorsky S-43 (NC15066) on Pan Am Flight 216 arriving from Port of Spain at 10:11 was landed in poor weather conditions due to safety concerns by the crew and subsequently sank within 10 minutes, killing 4 of the 14 occupants.

==Geography==
Fort-de-France, also known as the Fort of France, lies on Martinique&#x27;s west coast at the northern entrance to the large Fort-de-France Bay, at the mouth of the Madame River. The city occupies a narrow plain between the hills and the sea but is accessible by road from all parts of the island.

==Climate==
Fort-de-France has a tropical rainforest climate (Köppen &quot;Af&quot;), characterised by very warm to hot and humid weather year-round. The wettest months are from July to November when hurricanes are a frequent threat, although substantial rainfall occurs in all months. The hottest month on average is September, and the coldest month on average is February.
==Population==

==Naval port==
Fort Saint Louis in Fort-de-France is a French naval base.

==Government==
As of 27 June 2021, the Mayor of Fort de France is Serge Letchimy replacing Alfred Marie-Jeanne as the new mayor of the capitol. With a participation rate of little over 44% the Letchimy Party Alians Matinik received 37,72% of the votes, whereas Marie Jeanna who came in a close second with Gran Sanblé Pou Matinik acquired 35,27% of the votes. The commune of Fort-de-France makes up Martinique&#x27;s 3rd constituency for the National Assembly.

<text>Mount Pelée or Mont Pelée ( ; , ; ), meaning &quot;bald mountain&quot; or &quot;peeled mountain&quot; in French, is an active volcano at the northern end of Martinique, an island and French overseas department in the Lesser Antilles Volcanic Arc of the Caribbean. Its volcanic cone is composed of stratified layers of hardened ash and solidified lava. Its most recent eruption was in 1932.

The stratovolcano&#x27;s 1902 eruption destroyed the town of Saint-Pierre, killing 29,000 to 30,000 people in the space of a few minutes, in the worst volcanic disaster of the 20th century. The main eruption, on 8 May 1902, left only three known survivors. Ludger Sylbaris survived because he was in a poorly ventilated, dungeon-like jail cell. Léon Compère-Léandre, living on the edge of the city, escaped with severe burns. The third was a young girl named Havivra Da Ifrile, who fled to a nearby sea cave in a boat, enduring burns from falling ash.

In 2023, it was listed as UNESCO World heritage site.

==Geographical setting and description==

Mount Pelée is the result of a typical subduction zone. The subduction formed the Lesser Antilles island arc, a curved chain of volcanoes approximately in length, between Puerto Rico and Venezuela, where the Caribbean Plate meets Atlantic oceanic crust belonging to the South American Plate. Other volcanoes in the island arc are also known for their volcanic activity, including Saint Vincent&#x27;s La Soufrière, Guadeloupe&#x27;s La Grande Soufriere volcano, Montserrat&#x27;s Soufrière Hills, and the submarine volcano Kick &#x27;em Jenny.

==Geological history==

Volcanologists have identified three different phases in the evolution of Mount Pelée volcano: initial, intermediate, and modern. In an initial phase, called the &quot;Paléo-Pelée&quot; stage, Mount Pelee was a common stratovolcano. The cone of Paléo-Pelée was composed of many layers of lava flows and fragmented volcanic debris. Remains of the Paléo-Pelée cone are still visible at the northern view at the volcano today.

A second stage, now called the intermediate phase, started around 100,000 years ago, after a long period of quiescence. This stage is grouped by the formation of the Morne Macouba lava dome, then later on, the Morne Macouba caldera. During the intermediate phase, there were several eruptions which produced pyroclastic flows like those that destroyed Saint-Pierre in the 1902 eruption. Around 25,000 years ago, a large southwest sector collapse occurred, forming a landslide. This event was similar to the eruption of Mount St. Helens in 1980.

The modern stage of the evolution of Mount Pelée has created most of the current cone, with deposits of pumice and the results of past pyroclastic flows. More than 30 eruptions have been identified during the last 5,000 years of the volcano&#x27;s activity.

Three thousand years ago, following a large pumice eruption, the Étang Sec (French for Dry Pond) caldera was then formed. The 1902 eruption took place within the Étang Sec crater. This eruption formed many pyroclastic flows and produced a dome that filled the caldera. Mount Pelée continued to erupt until 4 July 1905. Thereafter, the volcano was dormant until 1929.

On 16 September 1929, Mount Pelée began to erupt again. This time, there was no hesitation on the part of authorities and the danger area was immediately evacuated. The 1929 eruption formed a second dome in the Étang Sec caldera and produced pyroclastic flows emptying into the Blanche River valley. Although there were pyroclastic flows, the activity was not as violent as the 1902 activity. It culminated in another &quot;spine&quot; or lava plug, albeit smaller than the 1902 plug, being emplaced at the summit. The activity ended in late 1932.

==Current status==

The volcano is currently active. A few volcano tectonic earthquakes occur on Martinique every year, and Mount Pelée is under continuous watch by geophysicists and volcanologists (IPGP). Before the 1902 eruption—as early as the summer of 1900—signs of increased fumarole activity were present in the Étang Sec crater. Relatively minor phreatic (steam) eruptions that occurred in 1792 and 1851 were evidence that the volcano was active. Signs of unrest are likely to precede any future eruptive activity from Mount Pelée, and its past activity (including the violent eruptions uncovered by carbon dating) is an extremely important factor for hazard assessment.

The city of Saint-Pierre was never fully rebuilt, though some villages grew up in its place. The estimated population of the Commune of Saint-Pierre in 2017 was 4,123.

On 6 December 2020, The Martinique Volcano Observatory (MVO) raised Mount Pelee&#x27;s alert level to Yellow [Restless] from Green [Normal] due to an increase in seismicity under the volcano beginning in April 2019, and observations of tremors the previous month.

As far as was known, this was the first sign of activity since the end of the 1929–1932 eruption. This volcano is, of course, highly dangerous, and great vigilance of its activity is required. Whether or not it is going to enter a new eruptive period is currently unknown.

According to the MVO press release: 
The increase in seismicity of superficial volcanic origin (up to below the summit) observed since April 2019, is therefore clearly above the base level characteristic for Mount Pelée.

In April 2019, volcanic seismicity appeared at depth around and under Mount Pelée (more than below sea level). It could correspond to the arrival at depth of magmatic fluids.

Finally, new recorded tremor-type signals were observed on November 8 and 9, 2020: they could correspond to a reactivation of the hydrothermal system.

Even if, in the current state of measurements, there is no deformation of the volcano on the scale of the observation network, the appearance, in a few months, of these three different types of seismic signals of volcanic origin shows a clear change in the behavior of the volcanic system, the activity of which is increasing from the base level observed over several decades.

==Biology==
The Martinique volcano frog, &quot;Allobates chalcopis&quot;, is endemic to Mount Pelée, and the only species among related frogs (family Aromobatidae) endemic to an oceanic island.

===Important bird area===
A largely forested tract, encompassing the mountain and extending to the sea on its north-western side, has been recognised as an Important Bird Area (IBA) by BirdLife International because it supports populations of bridled quail doves, Lesser Antillean swifts, green and purple-throated caribs, blue headed and Antillean crested hummingbirds, Caribbean elaenias, Lesser Antillean flycatchers, Lesser Antillean pewees, scaly-breasted and pearly-eyed thrashers, brown and grey tremblers, rufous-throated solitaires, Antillean euphonias, Martinique orioles, Lesser Antillean saltators and Lesser Antillean bullfinches.

== Protection ==
On September 16, 2023, the volcanoes and forests of Mount Pelée and the pitons of northern Martinique were listed as UNESCO World Heritage Site. The volcanic mountain range represents 12% of Martinique&#x27;s territory. It is the 7th natural site in France to be listed as a UNESCO World Heritage site. World Heritage status could also have a positive impact on tourism and the economy, increasing visitor numbers by 30 to 40%, according to the Martinique Nature Park.

==In literature==
*&quot;The Day The World Ended&quot; by Gordon Thomas and Max Morgan Witts (Stein and Day, 1969, 306 pp). The authors used contemporary records and survivor accounts to construct a historical novel of the events and lives of residents of Martinique, leading up to and through the eruption of May 8, 1902.
* &quot;Texaco&quot; by Patrick Chamoiseau (Gallimard, 1992. Trans. Rose-Myriam Réjouis and Val Vinokurov, Vintage International, 1998). In this novel that retraces several generations of Martinique&#x27;s history, Esternome, the protagonist of the novel&#x27;s first part, witnesses firsthand the destruction caused by the volcano. Marie-Sophie Laborieux, Esternome&#x27;s daughter and the novel&#x27;s narrator, recounts her father&#x27;s experiences and also discusses the traces of this event she has seen herself, including burn scars on her father&#x27;s body and ossuaries in the ruins of Saint-Pierre. The eruption and its aftermath are discussed in the section &quot;Amour grillée&quot; (&quot;Barbecued Love&quot;).
*&quot;Ti-Coyo and his shark&quot; (by Clément Richer. Trans. Gerard Hopkins) (Rupert Hart-Davis 1 January 1951) (First published 1 January 1941 as &quot;Ti-Coyo et son requin&quot;). In this humorous fable, wickedness triumphs because it is charming. Set on the exotic Caribbean island of Martinique before, during, and after the infamous eruption of Mont Pelée in 1902. Ti-Coyo, a shrewd and winning mixed race boy, rescues a wounded baby shark, which becomes his faithful companion as it grows into a monster fearful to everyone but him. With the help of this behemoth, Ti-Coyo becomes rich and wins the flaxen-haired princess of his dreams. It is the shark, too, who saves Ti-Coyo, his ill-assorted parents, and his sweetheart when Mont Pelée pours destruction over St. Pierre.

<text>The Dragon King, also known as the Dragon God, is a Chinese water and weather god. He is regarded as the dispenser of rain, commanding over all bodies of water. He is the collective personification of the ancient concept of the &quot;lóng&quot; in Chinese culture.

There are also the cosmological &quot;Dragon Kings of the Four Seas&quot; (; Sihai Longwang).

Besides being a water deity, the Dragon God frequently also serves as a territorial tutelary deity, similarly to Tudigong &quot;Lord of the Earth&quot; and Houtu &quot;Queen of the Earth&quot;.

== Dragon Kings of Bhutan ==
Also the Kings of Bhutan are called the Dragon King as Bhutan in its native language is known as Drukyul which translates as &quot;The Land of Dragon&quot;. Thus, while kings of Bhutan are known as Druk Gyalpo meaning Dragon King (Bhutan). Bhutanese people call themselves the Drukpa, meaning &quot;people of Druk (Bhutan)&quot;. Present King Jigme Khesar Namgyel Wangchuck is the 5th Dragon King.

== Singular Dragon King ==
The Dragon King has been regarded as holding dominion over all bodies of water, and the dispenser of rain, in rituals practiced into the modern era in China. One of his epithets is Dragon King of Wells and Springs.

=== Rainmaking rituals ===

Dragon processions have been held on the fifth and sixth moon of the lunar calendar all over China, especially on the 13th day of the sixth moon, held to be the Dragon King&#x27;s birthday, as ritualized supplication to the deity to make rain. In Changli County, Hebei Province a procession of sorts carried an image of the Dragon King in a basket and made circuit around nearby villages, and the participants would put out in front of their house a piece of yellow paper calligraphed with the text: &quot;The position [=tablet] of the Dragon King of the Four Seas , Five Lakes, Eight Rivers and Nine Streams&quot;, sprinkle it with water using willow withes, and burning incense next to it. This ritual was practiced in North of China into the 20th century.

In the past, there used to be Dragon King miao shrines all over China, for the folk to engage in the worship of dragon kings, villages in farm countries would conduct rites dedicated to the Dragon Kings seeking rain.

=== Daoist pantheon ===
Within the Daoist pantheon, the Dragon King is regarded the zoomorphic representation of the &quot;yang&quot; masculine power of generation. The dragon king is the king of the dragons and he also controls all of the creatures in the sea. The dragon king gets his orders from the Jade Emperor.

== Dragon Kings of the Five Regions ==

Historically there arose a cult of the Five Dragon Kings. The name &quot;Wufang longwang&quot; (, &quot;Dragon Kings of the Five Regions/Directions&quot;) is registered in Daoist scripture from the Tang dynasty, found in the Dunhuang caves. Veneration of chthonic dragon god(s) of the five directions still persists today in southern areas, such as Canton and Fujian. It has also been conflated with the cult of Lord Earth, Tugong (Tudigong), and inscriptions on tablets invoke the &quot;Wufang wutu longshen&quot; (, &quot;Dragon Spirits of the Five Directions and Five Soils&quot;) in rituals current in Southeast Asia (Vietnam).

=== Description ===
The Azure Dragon or Blue-Green Dragon ( &quot;Qīnglóng&quot;), or Green Dragon ( &quot;Cānglóng&quot;), is the Dragon God of the east, and of the essence of spring. The Red Dragon ( &quot;Chìlóng&quot; or &quot;Zhūlóng&quot;, literally &quot;Cinnabar Dragon&quot;, &quot;Vermilion Dragon&quot;) is the Dragon God of the south and of the essence of summer. The White Dragon ( &quot;Báilóng&quot;) is the Dragon God of the west and the essence of autumn. The Yellow Dragon ( &quot;Huánglóng&quot;) is the Dragon God of the center, associated with (late) summer. The Black Dragon ( &quot;Hēilóng&quot;), also called &quot;Dark Dragon&quot; or &quot;Mysterious Dragon&quot; ( &quot;Xuánlóng&quot;), is the Dragon God of the north and the essence of winter.

=== Broad history ===

Dragons of the Five Regions/Directions existed in Chinese custom, established by the Former Han period (Cf. §Origins below) The same concept couched in &quot;dragon king&quot; (&quot;longwang&quot;) terminology was centuries later, the term &quot;dragon king&quot; being imported from India (Sanskrit &quot;naga-raja&quot;), vis Buddhism, introduced in the 1st century AD during the Later Han.

The five &quot;Dragon Kings&quot; which were correlated with the Five Colors and Five Directions are attested uniquely in one work among Buddhist scriptures (&quot;sūtra&quot;), called the &quot;Foshuo guanding jing&quot; (; &quot;Consecration Sūtra Expounded by the Buddha&quot; early 4th century). Attributed to Po-Srimitra, it is a pretended translation, or &quot;apocryphal sutra&quot; (post-canonical text), but its influence on later rituals (relating to entombment) is not dismissable.

The dragon king cult was most active around the Sui-Tang dynasty, according to one scholar, but another observes that the cult spread farther afield with the backing of Song dynasty monarchs who built Dragon King Temples (or rather Taoist shrines), and Emperor Huizong of Song (12th century) conferred investiture upon them as local kings. But the dragon king and other spell incantations came to be discouraged in Buddhism within China, because they were based on eclectic (apocryphal) sutras and the emphasis grew for the orthodox sutras, or put another way, the quinary system (based on number 5) was being superseded by the number 8 or number 12 being held more sacred.

During the Tang period, the dragon kings were also regarded as guardians that safeguard homes and pacify tombs, in conjunction with the worship of Lord Earth. Buddhist rainmaking ritual learned Tang dynasty China by

The concept was transmitted to Japan alongside esoteric Buddhism, and also practiced as rites in &quot;Onmyōdō&quot; during the Heian Period.

=== Five dragons ===
;(Origins)
The idea of associating the five directions/regions (&quot;wufang&quot;; ) with the five colors is found in Confucian classic text,

The &quot;Huainanzi&quot; (2nd cent. BC) describes the five colored dragons (azure/green, red, white, black, yellow) and their associations (Chapter 4: Terrestrial Forms), as well as the placement of sacred beasts in the five directions (the Four Symbols beasts, dragon, tiger, bird, tortoise in the four cardinal directions and the yellow dragon.

And the &quot;Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals&quot; attributed to Dong Zhongshu (2nd cent. BC) describes the ritual involving five colored dragons.

=== Attestations of Five Dragon Kings ===

==== Consecration Sutra ====
The apocryphal &quot;Foshuo guanding jing&quot; (; &quot;Consecration Sūtra Expounded by the Buddha&quot; early 4th century, attributed to Po-Srimitra ), which purports to be Buddhist teachings but in fact incorporates elements of Chinese traditional belief, associates five dragon kings with five colored dragons with five directions, as aforementioned.

The text gives the personal names of the kings. To the east is the Blue Dragon Spirit King () named Axiuhe (), with 49 dragon kings under him, with 70 myriad myllion lesser dragons, mountain spirits, and assorted &quot;mei&quot; demons as minions. The thrust of this scripture is that in everywhere in every direction, there are the minions causing poisonings and ailments, and their lord the dragon kings must be beseeched in prayer to bring relief. In the south is the Red Dragon Spirit King named Natouhuati (), in the west the White, called Helousachati (), in the north the Black, called Nayetilou () and at center the Yellow, called Duluoboti (), with different numbers subordinate dragon kings, with minion hordes of lesser dragons and other beings. Though connection of poison to rainmaking may not be obvious, it has been suggested that this poison-banishing sutra could have viably been read as a replacement in the execution of the ritual to pray for rain (&quot;shōugyōhō&quot;, ), in Japan. A medieval commentary (&quot;Ryūō-kōshiki&quot;, copied 1310) has reasoned that since the Great Peacock (Mahāmāyūrī) sūtra mandates one to chant dragon names in order to detoxify, so shall offerings made to dragon lead to &quot;sweet rain&quot;.

==== Divine Incantations Scripture ====

The &quot;wangfang&quot; (&quot;five position&quot;) dragon kings are also attested in the &quot;Taishang dongyuan shenzhou jing&quot; (; &quot;Most High Cavernous Abyss Divine Spells Scripture&quot;), though not explicitly under the collective name of &quot;five position dragon kings&quot;, but individually as &quot;Eastern Direction&#x27;s Blue Emperor Blue Dragon King ()&quot;, and so forth. It gives a laundry list of dragon kings by different names, stating that spells to cause rain can be performed by invoking dragon kings.

=== Ritual process ===

An ancient procedural instruction for invoking five-colored dragons to conduct rainmaking rites occurs in the &quot;Luxuriant Dew of the Spring and Autumn Annals&quot;, under its &quot;Seeking Rain&quot; chapter (originally 2nd century B.C.). It prescribes earthenware figurines of greater and lesser dragons of a specific color according to season, namely blue-green, red, yellow, white, black, depending on whether it was spring, summer, late summer (), autumn, or winter. And these figures were to be placed upon the alter at the assigned position/direction (east, south, center, west, or north).

This Chinese folk rain ritual later became incorporated into Daoism. The rituals were codified into Daoist scripture or Buddhist sūtras in the post-Later Han () period, but Dragon King worship did not come into ascendancy until the Sui-Tang dynasties. The rain rituals in Esoteric Buddhism in the Tang dynasty was actually an adaptation of indigenous Chinese dragon worship and rainmaking beliefs, rather than pure Buddhism.

As a point of illustration, a comparison can be made against Buddhist procedures for rainmaking during the Tang dynasty. The rainmaking tract in the (Book 11, under the chapter for &quot;Rain Prayer Altar Method, &quot;qiyu tanfa&quot;; ) prescribes an altar to be built, with mud figures of dragon kings placed on the four sides, and numerous mud-made lesser dragons arranged within and without the altar.

==Dragon Kings of the Four Seas==

Each one of the four Dragon Kings of the Four Seas ( &quot;Sìhǎi Lóngwáng&quot;) is associated with a body of water corresponding to one of the four cardinal directions and natural boundaries of China: the East Sea (corresponding to the East China Sea), the South Sea (corresponding to the South China Sea), the West Sea (Qinghai Lake), and the North Sea (Lake Baikal). 

They appear in the classical novels like &quot;The Investiture of the Gods&quot; and &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, where each of them has a proper name, and they share the surname Ao (, meaning &quot;playing&quot; or &quot;proud&quot;).

=== Dragon of the Eastern Sea ===

His proper name is Ao Guang ( or ), and he is the patron of the East China Sea.

=== Dragon of the Western Sea ===

His proper names are Ao Run (), Ao Jun () or Ao Ji (). He is the patron of Qinghai Lake.

=== Dragon of the Southern Sea ===
He is the patron of the South China Sea and his proper name is Ao Qin ().

=== Dragon of the Northern Sea ===
His proper names are Ao Shun () or Ao Ming (), and his body of water is Lake Baikal.

== Japan ==

As already mentioned, Esoteric Buddhists in Japan who initially learned their trade from Tang dynasty China engaged in rainmaking ritual prayers invoking dragon kings under a system known as or &quot;shōugyō&quot; [&quot;no&quot;] &quot;hō&quot;, established in the Shingon sect founded by the priest Kūkai, who learned Buddhism in Tang China. It was first performed by Kūkai in the year 824 at Shinsen&#x27;en, according to legend, but the first occasion probably took place historically in the year 875, then a second time in 891. The rain ritual came to be performed regularly.

The &quot;shōugyōhō&quot; ritual used two mandalas that featured dragon kings. The Great Mandala that was hung up was of a design that centered around Sakyamuni Buddha, surrounded by the , the ten thousand dragon kings, Bodhisattvas (based on the &quot;Dayunlun qingyu jing&quot; , &quot;Scripture of [Summoning] Great Clouds and Petitioning for Rain&quot;). The other one was a &quot;spread-out mandala”(&quot;shiki mandara&quot; ) laid flat out on its back, and depicted five dragon kings, which were one-, three-, five-, seven-, and nine-headed (based on the &quot;Collected Dhāraṇī Sūtras&quot;).

Also, there was the &quot;Five Dragons Festival/ritual&quot; (&quot;Goryūsai&quot;. ) that was performed by &quot;onmyōji&quot; or yin-yang masters. The oldest mention of this in literature is from &quot;Fusō Ryakuki&quot;, the entry of Engi 2/902AD, 17th day of the 6th moon. Sometimes, the performance of the rain ritual by Esoteric Buddhists (&quot;shōugyōhō&quot;) would be followed in succession by the Five Dragons Ritual from the . The Five Dragon rites performed by the &quot;onmyōji&quot; or yin yang masters had their heyday around the 10–11th centuries. There are &quot;mokkan,&quot; or inscribed wooden tablets, used in these rites that have been unearthed (e.g., from an 8–10th century site and a 9th-century site).

In Japan, there also developed a legend that the primordial being Banko (Pangu of Chinese myth) sired the Five Dragon Kings, who were invoked in the ritual texts or read in Shinto or Onmyōdō rites, but the five beings later began to be seen less as monsters and more as wise princes.

==Worship of the Dragon God==
Worship of the Dragon God is celebrated throughout China with sacrifices and processions during the fifth and sixth moons, and especially on the date of his birthday the thirteenth day of the sixth moon. A folk religious movement of associations of good-doing in modern Hebei is primarily devoted to a generic Dragon God whose icon is a tablet with his name inscribed on it, utilized in a ritual known as the &quot;movement of the Dragon Tablet&quot;. The Dragon God is traditionally venerated with dragon boat racing.

In coastal regions of China, Korea, Vietnam, traditional legends and worshipping of whales (whale gods) have been referred to Dragon Kings after the arrival of Buddhism.

==Buddhism==
Some Buddhist traditions describe a figure named Duo-luo-shi-qi or Talasikhin as a Dragon King who lives in a palace located in a pond near the legendary kingdom of Ketumati. It is said that during midnight he used to drizzle in this pond to cleanse himself of dust.

<text>Jacques Pierre Joseph Rode (; 16 February 1774 – 25 November 1830) was a French violinist and composer.

==Life and career==
Born in Bordeaux, Aquitaine, France, Pierre Rode traveled in 1787 to Paris and soon became a favourite pupil of the great Giovanni Battista Viotti, who found the boy so talented that he charged him no fee for the lessons. Rode inherited his teacher&#x27;s style, to which he added more mildness and a more refined tone. It is also recorded that he made extensive use of portamento. He collaborated with Baillot and Kreutzer on the official Violin Method of the Conservatoire de Paris, published in 1802.

Rode served as violin soloist to Napoleon and toured extensively in the Netherlands, Germany, England and Spain, staying with François-Adrien Boieldieu in Saint Petersburg from 1804 until 1809, and later spending much time in Moscow.

When he returned to Paris, he found that the public no longer responded with much enthusiasm to his playing. Spohr, who heard him both before and after his Russian sojourn, wrote that Rode&#x27;s playing had become “cold and full of mannerism”. However, according to some sources, he suffered from a lymphatic infection caused by streptococcus bacteria that affected his right arm, reducing his ability to bow with any force or rapidity.

Ludwig van Beethoven wrote his last violin sonata (Op. 96) for Rode when the violinist was visiting Vienna. He also performed chamber music, but the backbone of his repertoire was formed by Viotti&#x27;s concertos, which served as models for his own concertos. These, as well as the 24 &quot;Caprices&quot; in all the major and minor keys, were written from 1814 to 1819 when he lived in Berlin.

In 1828 Rode made a last attempt at a public concert in Paris. It was such a fiasco that it was widely believed (as reported by Schuenemana, in citation above) that it hastened his death, on 25 November 1830 at Château de Bourbon near Damazan, Lot-et-Garonne, in his native Aquitaine.

==Compositions==
In all, Pierre Rode composed 13 violin concertos and many other works for violin, including at least four &quot;Quatuors brillants&quot; for violin and string trio. Although Rode&#x27;s violin concertos have some significance in the development of the Romantic concerto, they are nowadays rarely performed. His major enduring contribution to the literature are his &quot;24 Caprices&quot;, which are a standard part of the repertoire for advanced study of the violin. He also had a major influence on younger violinists, such as Louis Spohr, who adopted his style and developed it further.

<text>Rosalind Chao (born September 23, 1957) is an American actress, best known for playing Soon-Lee Klinger in the mid-1980s CBS show &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, Rose Hsu Jordan in the 1993 movie &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot;, the recurring character Keiko O&#x27;Brien on &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot; in the 1990s, and Dr. Kim on &quot;The O.C.&quot; in 2003. She also played Hua Li, Mulan&#x27;s mother, in the live-action 2020 remake of &quot;Mulan&quot;. In 2024 she starred as Ye Wenjie in the Netflix production of &quot;3 Body Problem&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Rosalind Chao was born in Los Angeles, California, and raised in Anaheim. Her parents were performers with the Peking opera before they relocated to Anaheim, where they ran a successful pancake restaurant, Chao&#x27;s Chinese and American Restaurant, across the street from Disneyland. Chao worked there from an early age.

She attended Pomona College in Claremont, California, and then the University of Southern California, where she earned a degree in broadcast journalism in 1978. She worked at Disneyland as an international tour guide, and contemplated pursuing journalism as a career.

==Career==
Chao&#x27;s parents were instrumental in her decision to pursue acting. She began acting at the age of five, in the California-based Peking opera traveling company with which her parents were involved. During the summer, they sent her to Taiwan for further acting study and experience.

As a child, she played the daughter of a laundry owner (played by James Hong) on a 1970 episode of &quot;Here&#x27;s Lucy&quot;, &quot;Lucy the Laundress&quot;.

Deciding not to pursue acting, Chao enrolled in the communications department at the University of Southern California where she earned her degree in journalism. However, after a year as a radio newswriting intern at the CBS-owned Hollywood radio station KNX, she returned to acting.

Chao&#x27;s breakthrough role was that of Soon-Lee, a South Korean refugee, in the final episodes of the TV series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Soon-Lee married longtime starring character Maxwell Klinger (Jamie Farr) in the series finale &quot;Goodbye, Farewell and Amen&quot;, which aired on February 28, 1983, and was the most-watched U.S. sitcom television episode of all time as of 2021. Chao repeated the role in the &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; sequel, 1983&#x27;s &quot;AfterMASH&quot;, her first role billed at co-star status.

Chao played Japanese exo-botanist Keiko O&#x27;Brien on the television series &quot;Star Trek: The Next Generation&quot; and &quot;Star Trek: Deep Space Nine&quot;. In 2010, a preliminary casting memo for &quot;The Next Generation&quot; from 1987 was published, revealing that Chao was originally considered for the part of &quot;Enterprise&quot; security chief Tasha Yar.

In August 2018, Chao was cast as Mulan&#x27;s mother in the 2020 live-action retelling of &quot;Mulan&quot;. In 2019, she was invited to join the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, citing her contributions to the critically acclaimed films &quot;The Joy Luck Club&quot; and &quot;I Am Sam&quot;.

==Personal life==
Chao met her husband Simon Templeman while they were working in theatre at the Mark Taper Forum. They have a son and a daughter.

<text>The Sunrays (previously known as the Renegades, the Renegade 5, Larry Tremaine &amp; the Renegades, the Rangers and the Dirt Riders) were an American band from Pacific Palisades, California. The group was led by singer/songwriter/drummer Rick Henn, who was a friend of the Beach Boys member Carl Wilson. Other members of the band were guitarists Eddy Medora and Byron Case, keyboard player Marty DiGiovanni, and bassist Vince Hozier.

==Career==
Their first job as the Renegades (in the late 1950s) was at the Seaside Session at Palisades Park in Pacific Palisades. In 1961 they teamed up with Larry Tremaine, and became Larry Tremaine and the Renegades, a rock and roll cover band, consisting of: Larry Tremaine, Steve O&#x27;Riley (now deceased), Marty DiGiovanni, Rick Henn, Eddy Medora (November 28, 1945 – October 27, 2006), and Vince Hozier (February 26, 1946 – March 18, 2007). Tremaine booked them every week at radio dances, UCLA, clubs, celebrity parties, and corporate events.

They appeared at Crescendo Interlude on the Sunset Strip with Joey Dee and the Starliters, the Teen Age Fair at Pacific Ocean Park, the after party for the 1963 Academy Awards, The Bob Eubanks TV Dance Party, and every Friday night as the house dance party band at the San Bernardino, California Civic Auditorium.

In 1963, Tremaine went into the radio stations KBLA and KRLA, and later television, and became the host of the syndicated nationwide &quot;Casino Royale Dance Party&quot;.

In 1964, Murry Wilson, the father of Brian, Carl, and Dennis Wilson of the Beach Boys, started managing them and changed their name to The Sunrays. Eddy Medora switched from the saxophone to rhythm guitar. Steve O&#x27;Riley, who played lead guitar and sang, left the band when &quot;I Live for the Sun&quot; began to break, saying &quot;I don&#x27;t wanna be in the group anymore, I think I can make it on my own.&quot; O&#x27;Riley was replaced by Byron Case.

Their hits included &quot;I Live for the Sun&quot; (1965) (No. 51 US, No. 20 Australia), &quot;Andrea&quot; (1966) (No. 41 US), and &quot;Still&quot; (1966) (No. 93 US).

They toured the United States and opened for the Beach Boys in the U.S. and Canada.

<doc id="254972" wikidata="Q1333063" url="?curid=254972" title="Crest of the Stars">
<text>is a three-volume space opera science fiction novel written by Hiroyuki Morioka with cover illustrations by Toshihiro Ono. This was followed by a second, ongoing novel series, &quot;Banner of the Stars&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Seikai no Senki&quot;, currently six volumes) and a series of books collecting short stories set in the same universe known as .

Beginning in 1999, the novels were adapted into anime and manga series, the first of which ran for 13 episodes on WOWOW. A recap movie, &quot;Crest of the Stars Special Edition&quot;, was also released in 2000.

==Plot==
&quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; chronicles how Jinto met Lafiel and the events that followed before the war.

When Jinto was a young boy, his world is invaded by the Abh empire. His father who was then president of the Hyde Star System, surrendered the system and earned for himself and his family a nobility within Abh society. Young Jinto is sent off to school in planet Delktou to learn the ways of Abh nobility and the story of Crest of the Stars picks up as he meets the young Abh princess, Lafiel who as a pilot trainee has been assigned to escort him to the patrol ship Gothlauth, a.k.a. Gosroth). Soon, they find themselves unready participants in the incident that would ignite the war between the Abh Empire and the Four Nations Alliance of Humankind — an anti-Abh alliance of the democratic nations of the United Mankind, the Federation of Hania, the Republic of Greater Alcont, and the People&#x27;s Sovereign Union of Planets.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
:
: Years after his father surrendered the Hyde Star System to the Abh Empire, Jinto is on his way to the capital to attend military school in preparation for claiming his title and succeeding his father as the next territorial lord. He befriends Lafiel not knowing that she is royalty. Although completely unused to life in space, he is quite dependable when on a planet surface.
:
: Lafiel is the pilot trainee assigned to escort Jinto from the spaceport of Delktou to the patrol ship Gosroth. Although she is a member of the Abriel Imperial Family, she befriends him and allows him to call her by her name. As a space-dweller, she is somehow clueless of life in the surface world. She is self-sacrificing and strong-willed but eventually begins to have more faith in Jinto. She is a very good shot.

===Minor characters===
; Lexshue Wef-Robell Plakia
: The captain of the patrol ship Gosroth, she decides to send Jinto and Lafiel to Sufugnoff once it is confirmed that the ship is about to be attacked. 

; Atosryua Syun-Atos Lyuf Febdash Klowal
: The third Baron of Febdash, an obscure star system where Jinto and Lafiel made a stopover en route to Sufugnoff (Sfagnaumh). He is ambitious and at the same time embarrassed of his heritage. He tried to detain Lafiel and imprison Jinto, which brought dire consequences onto himself. 

; Atosryua Syun-Atos Lyuf Raika Febdash Srguf
: The second Baron of Febdash and father of Klowal and Loïc. Due to his being a genetic &quot;grounder,&quot; his own son despised him resulting in confinement and isolation. He became friends with Jinto and aided Lafiel in &quot;punishing&quot; Klowal.

; Seelnay
: A vassal of the Barony of Febdash who helped Lafiel take over the control room of the baron&#x27;s mansion. 

; Inspector Entryua
: Chief of the Police Department of Lune Biga, a city on Planet Clasbul in the Sufugnoff Star System. He is forced to cooperate with the invading forces of the United Mankind to search for Jinto and Lafiel. 

; Lt. Kyte
: An Alliance military police officer from the United Mankind who led the search for Jinto and Lafiel in Clasbul. Because he is also genetically engineered, he is despised by most citizens of the United Mankind and is prevented from rising amongst the ranks of the military. This results in deep hatred against the Abh. 

;Anti-imperialist group of Clasbul
: Though not necessarily &quot;anti-Abh&quot;, it is a group seeking freedom to run their own shipping, transportation, and trade. They help the pair to flee Sufugnoff and escape the clutches of the United Mankind. For their assistance, as well as to meet the legal requirement for ship leasees to be ranking Abh nobles, they are raised to the rank of an Abh dame/equestrian (reucec).

==Development==
The series is notable for Morioka&#x27;s creation of an entire language, Baronh, and an accompanying alphabet, Ath, used by the Abh. Almost all written text in the anime is in Baronh, with occasional text in other invented languages; at least one planet is shown to have adopted Ath to write their own language.

==Media==

===Books===
Despite being commonly dubbed as a trilogy, the work is actually a three-volume novel. The three volumes were originally released by Hayakawa Publishing from April to June 1996.

The novel volumes were translated and released in English in softcover format by Tokyopop in 2006 and 2007.

On April 20, 2019, J-Novel Club announced they had licensed both &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; and &quot;Banner of the Stars&quot; for digital and physical release. The J-Novel Club version of &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; features a new translation. The digital release followed J-Novel Club&#x27;s model of releasing &quot;prepub&quot; chapters on their website for premium members before the digital retail release on their site and other platforms like Amazon. The physical release for both series is in hardcover omnibus format, with three volumes per issue, with &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; released on March 3, 2020.

===Anime===

&quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; was released in Japan in 1999 and in the United States by Bandai in 2001. At the end of 2002, TechTV announced that &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; was to be one of the initial titles as part of their new &quot;Anime Unleashed&quot; programming and began broadcast at the end of 2002 and through 2003. Following the closure of Bandai Entertainment in 2012, Sunrise announced at Otakon 2013, that Funimation had licensed &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot;, &quot;Banner of the Stars I&quot; and &quot;II&quot; and &quot;Passage of the Stars&quot;. On December 25, 2019, &quot;Crest of The Stars&quot; and its sequel series &quot;Banner of the Stars&quot; were released on Blu-ray in Japan.
===Radio drama===
Radio drama adaptation was broadcast on FM Osaka, and has been released as CDs in three volumes. The cast is practically the same as the anime version, but with some changes.

===Manga===
Dengeki Comics released a one-volume manga adaptation of the novel on March 27, 2000, after serializing it in &quot;Monthly Comic Dengeki Daioh&quot; magazine in 1999. The manga was illustrated by Toshihiro Ono and written by Aya Yoshinaga, who has also written the anime adaptation. Hiroyuki Morioka is also credited on the cover as the original creator. 
Much like the anime series, it covers all three volumes. It was licensed by Tokyopop and released on June 8, 2004, under the name &quot;Seikai Trilogy, Vol. 1: Crest of the Stars&quot;, dubbed the first part of the &quot;Seikai Trilogy&quot;, since two other companion manga were also released, adapting &quot;Banner of the Stars&quot; &quot;I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;.

The first chapter of a new web manga adaptation of &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; by Kōichirō Yonemura was published by Flex Comix in volume five of &quot;Nico Nico FlexComix Next&quot; digital magazine released on May 8, 2012 and on &quot;FlexComix Next&quot; site on May 22; the manga was transferred to &quot;Comic Meteor&quot; on September 5. The last chapter was released online on April 28, 2021. The first print volume of the manga went on sale on May 11, 2013 and the eighth and last was released on April 12, 2021. Both were released digitally three days earlier.

===Video game===
Roughly a year after the anime finished airing, on May 25, 2000 Bandai Visual released a video game adaptation for the PlayStation. It features a story inspired by both the &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; and the &quot;Banner of the Stars&quot; novels, incorporating some of their characters. The game consists of 67 different space battles, with a story split in two paths with three possible endings each.

==Reception==
In 1996, the world of Japanese science fiction novels was in a slump. Many people considered the genre dead to such an extent that authors avoided it. The appearance of the &quot;Crest of the Stars&quot; novel was not only a surprise but also earned it the Seiun Award.

* Kurtwood Smith as Captain Scanlon

==Episodes==
The two-hour television movie backdoor pilot for this series aired on August 11, 1982.

==Broadcast history==
After the success of the movie &quot;The Warriors&quot;, Hollywood looked to take the youth gang concept and market it to TV. In 1981, Swayze did a TV show, &quot;Return of the Rebels&quot;, about an aging motorcycle gang who get together to help a friend who owns a popular campground that is being threatened by a band of arrogant groupies. However, the show didn&#x27;t catch on and was quickly canceled.

Brother team Lawrence and Charles Gordon tried to market Swayze&#x27;s rebel look, combine the gang concept with a police angle and came up with &quot;The Renegades&quot;. Roger Spottiswoode directed the TV movie pilot that premiered on August 11, 1982 and a six-episode series was broadcast in Spring 1983. It had weak ratings and ABC cancelled the show.

<text>Asa Philip Randolph (April 15, 1889 – May 16, 1979) was an American labor unionist and civil rights activist. In 1925, he organized and led the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, the first successful African-American-led labor union. In the early Civil Rights Movement and the Labor Movement, Randolph was a prominent voice. His continuous agitation with the support of fellow labor rights activists against racist labor practices helped lead President Franklin D. Roosevelt to issue Executive Order 8802 in 1941, banning discrimination in the defense industries during World War II. The group then successfully maintained pressure, so that President Harry S. Truman proposed a new Civil Rights Act and issued Executive Orders 9980 and 9981 in 1948, promoting fair employment and anti-discrimination policies in federal government hiring, and ending racial segregation in the armed services.

Randolph was born and raised in Florida. He was educated at Cookman Institute, then moved to New York City as part of the early Great Migration, leaving behind the discriminatory Jim Crow–era south. There he became convinced that overcoming racism required collective action and he was drawn to socialism and workers&#x27; rights. He unsuccessfully ran for state office on the socialist ticket in the early 1920s, but found more success in organizing for African American workers&#x27; rights.

In 1963, Randolph was the head of the March on Washington, organized by Bayard Rustin, at which Reverend Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. Randolph inspired the &quot;Freedom Budget&quot;, sometimes called the &quot;Randolph Freedom budget&quot;, which aimed to deal with the economic problems facing the black community. It was published by the Randolph Institute in January 1967 as &quot;A Freedom Budget for All Americans&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Asa Philip Randolph was born April 15, 1889, in Crescent City, Florida, the second son of James William Randolph, a tailor and minister in an African Methodist Episcopal Church, and Elizabeth Robinson Randolph, a seamstress. In 1891, the family moved to Jacksonville, Florida, which had a thriving, well-established African-American community.

From his father, Randolph learned that color was less important than a person&#x27;s character and conduct. From his mother, he learned the importance of education and of defending oneself physically against those who tried to hurt one or one&#x27;s family, if necessary. Randolph remembered vividly the night his mother sat in the front room of their house with a loaded shotgun across her lap, while his father tucked a pistol under his coat and went off to prevent a mob from lynching a man at the local county jail.

Asa and his brother, James, were superior students. They attended the Cookman Institute in East Jacksonville, the only academic high school in Florida for African Americans. Asa excelled in literature, drama, and public speaking; he also starred on the school&#x27;s baseball team, sang solos with the school choir, and was valedictorian of the 1907 graduating class.

After graduation, Randolph worked odd jobs and devoted his time to singing, acting, and reading. Reading W. E. B. Du Bois&#x27;s &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; convinced him that the fight for social equality was most important. Barred by discrimination from all but manual jobs in the South, Randolph moved to New York City in 1911, where he worked odd jobs and took social sciences courses at City College.

===Marriage and family===
In 1913, Randolph courted and married Lucille Campbell Green, a widow, Howard University graduate, and entrepreneur who shared his socialist politics. She earned enough money to support them both. The couple had no children.

===Early career===
Shortly after Randolph&#x27;s marriage, he helped organize the Shakespearean Society in Harlem. With them he played the roles of Hamlet, Othello, and Romeo, among others. Randolph aimed to become an actor but gave up after failing to win his parents&#x27; approval. Randolph&#x27;s background as a Shakespearean actor gave him a &quot;deep, resonant voice&quot; that he to use with considerable effect in his speeches while his delignified &quot;courtly&quot; bearing assisted with negotiations.

In New York, Randolph became familiar with socialism and the ideologies espoused by the Industrial Workers of the World. He met Columbia University Law student Chandler Owen, and the two developed a synthesis of Marxist economics and the sociological ideas of Lester Frank Ward, arguing that people could be free only if not subject to economic deprivation. At this point, Randolph developed what became his distinctive form of civil rights activism, which emphasized the importance of collective action as a way for black people to gain legal and economic equality. To this end, he and Owen opened an employment office in Harlem to provide job training for southern migrants and encourage them to join trade unions.

Like others in the labor movement, Randolph favored immigration restriction. He opposed African Americans&#x27; having to compete with people willing to work for low wages. But unlike other immigration restrictionists, he rejected the notions of racial hierarchy that became popular in the 1920s.

In 1917, Randolph and Owen founded &quot;The Messenger&quot; with the help of the Socialist Party of America. It was a radical monthly magazine that campaigned against lynching, opposed U.S. participation in World War I, and urged African Americans to resist being drafted, fight for an integrated society, and join radical unions. The Department of Justice called &quot;The Messenger&quot; &quot;the most able and the most dangerous of all the Negro publications.&quot; When it began publishing the work of black poets and authors, a critic called it &quot;one of the most brilliantly edited magazines in the history of Negro journalism.&quot;

Soon thereafter, the editorial staff of &quot;The Messenger&quot; became divided by three issues: the growing rift between West Indian and African Americans, support for the Bolshevik revolution, and support for Marcus Garvey&#x27;s Back-to-Africa movement. In 1919, most West Indian radicals joined the new Communist Party, while African-American leftists—Randolph included—mostly supported the Socialist Party. The infighting left &quot;The Messenger&quot; short of financial support, and it went into decline.

Randolph unsuccessfully ran on the Socialist Party ticket for New York State Comptroller in 1920 and for Secretary of State of New York in 1922.

===Union organizer===

Randolph&#x27;s first experience with labor organization came in 1917, when he organized a union of elevator operators in New York City. In 1919 he became president of the National Brotherhood of Workers of America, a union that organized among African-American shipyard and dock workers in the Tidewater region of Virginia. The union dissolved in 1921 under pressure from the American Federation of Labor.

Randolph&#x27;s greatest success came with the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters (BSCP), which elected him president in 1925. This was the first serious effort to form a labor institution for employees of the Pullman Company, a major employer of African Americans. The railroads had dramatically expanded in the early 20th century, and the jobs offered relatively good employment at a time of widespread racial discrimination. But because porters were not unionized, most had poor working conditions and were underpaid.

Under Randolph&#x27;s direction, the BSCP enrolled 51 percent of porters within a year, to which Pullman responded with violence and firings. In 1928, after failing to win mediation under the Watson-Parker Railway Labor Act, Randolph planned a strike. This was postponed after rumors circulated that Pullman had 5,000 replacement workers ready to take the place of BSCP members. As a result of its perceived ineffectiveness, membership in the union declined; by 1933 it had only 658 members and electricity and telephone service at headquarters had been disconnected because of nonpayment of bills.

The BSCP&#x27;s fortunes changed with the 1932 election of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. With amendments to the Railway Labor Act in 1934, porters were granted rights under federal law. Membership in the Brotherhood jumped to more than 7,000. After years of bitter struggle, the Pullman Company began to negotiate with the Brotherhood in 1935, and agreed to a contract with it in 1937. Employees gained $2,000,000 in pay increases, a shorter workweek, and overtime pay. Randolph maintained the Brotherhood&#x27;s affiliation with the American Federation of Labor through the 1955 AFL-CIO merger.

===Civil rights leader===

Through his success with the BSCP, Randolph emerged as one of the most visible spokespeople for African-American civil rights. Randolph called shaping public opinion &quot;the most powerful weapon in America&quot; and by 1940 had become the face of the civil rights movement in the United States. In September 1940 at the annual convention of the BSCP in Harlem, Randolph urged the Roosevelt administration to have no discrimination in the Selective Training and Service Act, which was being debated in Congress at the time. A guest speaker at the convention was the First Lady, Eleanor Roosevelt, and through her, Randolph was able to have a meeting at the White House with her husband, President Franklin D. Roosevelt. At the meeting at the White House on 27 September 1940, Roosevelt promised Randolph there would be no segregation in the military, saying he was sympathetic towards the civil rights movement. Two weeks later, the War Department issued a statement saying &#x27;the policy of the War Department is not to intermingle colored and white enlisted personnel&quot;. Feeling betrayed, Randolph decided to launch nation-wide protests demanding that the end of segregation in not only the military, but also in the industries that made weapons for the military. At the time, the Roosevelt administration was gearing up to make the United States &quot;the arsenal of democracy&quot; by supplying a massive number of weapons to the United Kingdom and its allies that were fighting in World War Two, and banning segregation in the defense-related industry would be a huge gain for the civil rights movement. Randolph told an aide: &quot;I think we ought to have 10, 000 Negros march down Pennsylvania Avenue...We shall not call upon our white friends to march with us. There are some things that Negros must do on their own&quot;. 

In 1941, he, Bayard Rustin, and A. J. Muste proposed a march on Washington to protest racial discrimination in war industries, an end to segregation, access to defense employment, the proposal of an anti-lynching law and of the desegregation of the American Armed forces. Randolph&#x27;s belief in the power of peaceful direct action was inspired partly by Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s success using such tactics against British occupation in India. Randolph threatened to have 50,000 blacks march on the city. On 18 June 1941, Randolph again met with Roosevelt at the White House with the mayor of New York, Fiorello La Guardia, serving as a mediator. Roosevelt asked Randolph to call off the march, saying &quot;questions like this cannot be settled with a sledge hammer&quot; and vaguely promised to have discussions if the march was cancelled. Randolph remained unyielding, saying the march would not be cancelled unless Roosevelt gave way. Le Guardia broke the impasse by saying: &quot;Gentlemen, it is clear that Mr. Randolph is not going to call off the march, and I suggest we all begin to seek a formula&quot;. The march was canceled after Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802, or the Fair Employment Act. Some activists, including Rustin, felt betrayed because Roosevelt&#x27;s order banned discrimination only within war industries, not the armed forces. Nonetheless, the Fair Employment Act is generally considered an important early civil rights victory. Executive Order 8802 read: &quot;There shall be no discrimination in the employment of workers in defense industries or the government because of race, creed, color or national origin&quot;. The proposed march on Washington was a turning point in the civil rights movement as one black newspaper noted at the time &quot;it demonstrated to the Doubting Thomases among us that only mass action can pry open the doors that have been erected against America&#x27;s black minority&quot;.. Before 1941, black leaders had generally sought to lobby white politicians to change the laws. After 1941, there was a tendency to by-pass the politicians and instead engage in protests. Executive Order 8802 led to a exodus of blacks out of the South that was comparable to the Great Migration of the early 20th century. In every month in 1942, about 10, 000 Afro-Americans from the South, mostly from Texas and Louisiana, settled in the Los Angeles area, mostly to take jobs in the well-paying aviation industry. 

And the movement continued to gain momentum. Unlike World War One, Randolph supported the war effort in World War Two under the slogan &quot;Double Victory&quot;, namely victory over fascism abroad and victory over racism at home. In 1942, an estimated 18,000 blacks gathered at Madison Square Garden to hear Randolph kick off a campaign against discrimination in the military, war industries, government agencies, and labor unions.

Following passage of the Act, during the Philadelphia transit strike of 1944, the government backed African-American workers&#x27; striking to gain positions formerly limited to white employees.
In 1943, Randolph visited Memphis to launch a personal campaign for free speech after Boss E.H. Crump, a Democratic ally of the president, had successfully used strong-arm and political pressure tactics to drive two prominent local black Republicans, J.B. Martin and Randolph&#x27;s friend Robert Church Jr., out of the city. After he came to Memphis, Crump denied Randolph venues and intimidated local black leaders into declining speaking invitations by threatening them with jail. When Randolph urged Eleanor Roosevelt, who had friendly political ties with Crump, to do something to counter Crump&#x27;s &quot;fascist&quot; denial of free speech, she refused. Her reply to Randolph on December 18 read in full: &quot;I referred your letter to a friend of mine when I received it and I am sorry it has not been answered before. I was advised not to do anything, as it might do more harm than good.&quot;

Randolph and other activists continued to press for rights of African Americans. In 1947, Randolph and colleague Grant Reynolds renewed efforts to end discrimination in the armed services, forming the Committee Against Jim Crow in Military Service, later renamed the League for Non-Violent Civil disobedience. When President Truman asked Congress for a peacetime draft law, Randolph urged young black men to refuse to register. Since Truman was vulnerable to defeat in 1948 and needed the support of the growing black population in northern states, he eventually capitulated. On July 26, 1948, Truman began a process of ending racial segregation in the armed forces with Executive Order 9981.

In 1950, along with Roy Wilkins, Executive Secretary of the NAACP, and Arnold Aronson, a leader of the National Jewish Community Relations Advisory Council, Randolph founded the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights (LCCR). LCCR has been a major civil rights coalition. It coordinated a national legislative campaign on behalf of every major civil rights law since 1957.
Randolph and Rustin also formed an important alliance with Martin Luther King Jr. In 1957, when schools in the south resisted school integration following &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;, Randolph and King organized the Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom. In 1958 and 1959, Randolph organized Youth Marches for Integrated Schools in Washington, D.C. At the same time, he arranged for Rustin to teach King to organize peaceful demonstrations in Alabama and form alliances with progressive whites. The protests, directed by James Bevel in cities such as Birmingham and Montgomery, provoked a violent backlash by police and the local Ku Klux Klan in the summer of 1963, which was captured on television and broadcast throughout the nation and the world. Rustin later remarked that Birmingham &quot;was one of television&#x27;s finest hours. Evening after evening, television brought into the living-rooms of America the violence, brutality, stupidity, and ugliness of [police commissioner] Eugene &quot;Bull&quot; Connor&#x27;s effort to maintain racial segregation.&quot; Partly as a result of the violent spectacle in Birmingham, which was becoming an international embarrassment, the Kennedy administration drafted civil rights legislation aimed at ending Jim Crow once and for all.

Randolph finally realized his vision for a March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom on August 28, 1963, which attracted between 200,000 and 300,000 to the nation&#x27;s capital. The rally is often remembered as the high point of the Civil Rights Movement, and it did help keep the issue in the public consciousness. But when President Kennedy was assassinated three months later, civil rights legislation stalled in the Senate. In 1964, under President Lyndon B. Johnson, the Civil Rights Act finally passed. In 1965, the Voting Rights Act passed. King and Bevel deserve great credit for these legislative victories, but the importance of Randolph&#x27;s contributions to the Civil Rights Movement is large.

===Religion===
Randolph avoided speaking publicly about his religious beliefs to avoid alienating his diverse constituencies. Though he is sometimes identified as an atheist, particularly by his detractors, Randolph identified with the African Methodist Episcopal Church he was raised in. He pioneered the use of prayer protests, which became a key tactic of the civil rights movement. In 1973, he signed the &quot;Humanist Manifesto II&quot;.
===Death===
Randolph died in his Manhattan apartment on May 16, 1979. For several years before his death, he had a heart condition and high blood pressure. He had no known living relatives, as his wife Lucille had died in 1963, before the March on Washington.

<doc id="254980" wikidata="Q4712421" url="?curid=254980" title="Albino (chess)">
<text>An Albino is a type of chess problem, &quot;in which, at some point in the solution, a white Pawn on its starting square makes each of its four possible moves (forward one square, forward two squares, capture to the left, capture to the right).&quot; When a Black pawn exhibits similar activity or a quadruple defense instead of &quot;Albino&quot; it is termed a &quot;[[Chess problem terminology#P|Pickaninny]]&quot; (see: albino and pickaninny). The Albino is, &quot;the four possible moves of a WP [white pawn] on its initial square (excluding squares a2 and h2),&quot; and, the Pickaninny, &quot;the four possible moves of a BP [black pawn] on its initial square (excluding squares a7 and h7)&quot;. The latter term was coined by Frank Janet by 1916.

==Examples==
A simple example of an Albino is the problem to the right, a mate in 2 (White moves first and must checkmate Black in two moves against any defense). It is by Camil Seneca and was first published in the April 1949 edition of the &quot;Bulletin Ouvrier des Echecs&quot;. The first move of the solution (or &quot;key&quot;) is 1.Nb1. This threatens 2.Ra3#. Black has four ways to defend against this, each of which leads to a different move of the White pawn. After 1...Bb3, the only move that mates is 2.cxb3# (the pawn captures to the left). After 1..Bd3, the only mate is 2.cxd3# (capturing to the right). After 1...Bb5 only 2.c3# will do (forward one square; 2.c4 is no good because the b4 square needs to be covered by the pawn now the White queen has been cut off). After 1...Bd5 only 2.c4# will do (2.c3 is no good, because Black could play 2...Bb3).

The Albino pawn moves need not necessarily be in the post-key play of the problem; they can instead be &quot;tries&quot;: moves which almost solve a problem but which fail to a single Black defense. The mate in 2 to the right, which combines the Albino with a Pickaninny, is an example. It is by Lev Loshinsky and was published in &quot;Moskau-Rostow&quot; in 1930. The key is 1.Nfd5 (threatening 2. Qf4#) with the variations 1...g5 2. h8=Q#; 1...Rxc3/Rxd5 2.Qf5#; and 1...Rd4 2.Qxg7/f5#. The main point of the problem however, is in the Albino tries, each of which is refuted by a Pickaninny defense. The relevant variations are:

*1.exd3 (capture to the left; threatens 2.Nd7#) fails to 1...gxf6 (capture to the right)
*1.exf3 (capture to the right; threatens 2.Qg5# and 2.f4#) fails to 1...gxh6 (capture to the left)
*1.e3 (one square forward; threatens 2.Qf4#) fails to 1...g5 (two squares forward)
*1.e4 (two squares forward; threatens 2. Qf5#) fails to 1...g6 (one square forward)

In each of these cases there are other ways for Black to counter White&#x27;s threat, but the Pickaninny move is the only one that doesn&#x27;t give White a new mate (for example, after 1.exf3, Bg6 prevents White&#x27;s threats, but is not any good because it allows 2.Rxe6#).


The nature of the Albino theme is such that in orthodox chess there must be at least four variations to show the four different moves of the White pawn. However, if the rules of circe chess are applied, the number of required variations can be reduced to two (circe is a chess variant in which captured pieces, rather than being removed from the board, are returned to their home squares). The problem to the right is an example; it is by Adrian Storisteanu and was first published in the &quot;British Chess Magazine&quot; in 1977. The problem is a helpmate in 2, which means Black moves first and cooperates with White to move to a position where Black is in checkmate after White&#x27;s second move. This problem features grasshoppers (represented here by inverted queens), a fairy chess piece which moves along the same lines as a queen, but which must &quot;hop&quot; over another piece (friendly or enemy) and land on the square immediately beyond.

There are two solutions to the problem (note that in helpmates, Black&#x27;s moves are given first):

*1.Rd3 c3+ 2.Gaxc3(pc2) cxd3(Ra8)#
*1.Rb3 c4+ 2.Gxc4(pc2) cxb3(Ra8)#

The first solution has the White pawn moving forward one square, then, after its rebirth on c2, capturing to the right; the second solution has the pawn first moving two squares and then capturing to the left. Problems like this, showing an Albino with fewer than four variations, are very unusual.

<text>Passport to Pimlico is a 1949 British comedy film made by Ealing Studios and starring Stanley Holloway, Margaret Rutherford and Hermione Baddeley. It was directed by Henry Cornelius and written by T. E. B. Clarke. The story concerns the unearthing of treasure and documents that lead to a small part of Pimlico to be declared a legal part of the House of Burgundy, and therefore exempt from the post-war rationing or other bureaucratic restrictions in Britain.

&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; explores the spirit and unity of wartime London after the war and offers an examination of the English character. Like other Ealing comedies, the film pits a small group of British people against a series of changes to the &quot;status quo&quot; from an external agent. The story was an original concept by the screenwriter T. E. B. Clarke. He was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth, the baby was born on Dutch territory and would not lose her right to the throne.

&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; was well-received on its release. The film was released in the same year as &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; and &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;. &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film and the Academy Award for Writing (Story and Screenplay). There have since been two BBC Radio adaptations: the first in 1952, the second in 1996.

==Plot==
The film&#x27;s opening credits end with the words &quot;dedicated to the memory of&quot;, with an image of Second World War British food and clothing ration coupons.

In post-Second World War London, an unexploded bomb detonates in Miramont Gardens, Pimlico. The explosion reveals a long-buried cellar containing artwork, coins, jewellery and an ancient manuscript. The document is authenticated by the historian Professor Hatton-Jones as a royal charter of Edward IV that ceded a house and its estates to Charles, the last Duke of Burgundy, when he sought refuge there after being presumed dead at the 1477 Battle of Nancy. As the charter had never been revoked, an area of Pimlico is declared to still be a legal part of Burgundy.

As the British government has no legal jurisdiction, it requires the local residents to form a representative committee according to the laws of the long-defunct dukedom before negotiating with them. Ancient Burgundian law requires that the duke himself appoint a council. Sébastien de Charolais arrives and presents his claim to the title, which is verified by Professor Hatton-Jones. He forms the governing body, which includes Spiller, the local policeman; Mr. Wix, the manager of the bank branch; and Arthur Pemberton, a neighbourhood shopkeeper, who is appointed as Burgundy&#x27;s prime minister. The council begin discussions with the government, particularly about the Burgundian treasure.

After it dawns on people that Burgundy is not subject to post-war rationing or other bureaucratic restrictions, the district is quickly flooded with black marketeers and shoppers. Spiller is unable to handle the rising tide of problems by himself. In response, the British authorities surround the Burgundian territory with barbed wire. The residents retaliate against what they see as heavy-handed bureaucratic action; they stop a London Underground train as it passes through Burgundy, and ask to see passports of all passengers: those without documents are prevented from proceeding.

The British government responds by breaking off negotiations and isolating Burgundy. Power, water and deliveries of food are all cut off at the border. The residents are invited to &quot;emigrate&quot; to England, but they are defiant. Late one night, the Burgundians covertly connect a hose to a nearby British water main and fill a bomb crater, solving the water problem, but this floods the food store. Unable to overcome this new problem, the Burgundians prepare to give up. Sympathetic Londoners begin to throw food parcels across the barrier, and soon others join in. A helicopter pumps milk through a hose, and pigs are parachuted into the area.

Meanwhile, the British government comes under public pressure to resolve the situation. It becomes clear to the British diplomats assigned to find a solution that defeating the Burgundians through starvation is both difficult and unpopular with the British people, so they negotiate. The sticking point turns out to be the disposition of the unearthed treasure. Wix, now the Burgundian chancellor of the exchequer, suggests a Burgundian loan of the treasure to Britain. With the final piece of the deadlock eliminated, Burgundy reunites with Britain, which also sees the return of rationing for food and clothing to the area. The celebratory outdoor banquet is interrupted by heavy rain and the temperature plunges.

==Cast==
==Themes==
&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; contains numerous references to the Second World War and the postwar Labour Government to accentuate the spirit within the small Burgundian enclave. The scholar of film studies, Charles Barr, in his examination of the Ealing films, observes that in opposing the British government, the Burgundians &quot;recover the spirit, the resilience and local autonomy and &quot;unity&quot; of wartime London&quot;. Barr suggests the actions &quot;re-enact, ... in miniature, the war experience of Britain itself&quot;. The film historian Mark Duguid, writing for the British Film Institute, considers that the opposition is a &quot;yearning nostalgia for the social unity of the war years&quot;.

The film historians Anthony Aldgate and Jeffrey Richards describe &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; as a progressive comedy because it upsets the established social order to promote the well-being of a community. The view of the community put forward in the film has been criticised as being anachronistic, as the wartime unity had already passed by 1949. According to Aldgate and Richards, the welcome return to the ration books at the end of the film signifies an acceptance that the measures of the British government are in the best interests of the people.

The device of pitting a small group of British against a series of changes to the &quot;status quo&quot; from an external agent leads the British Film Institute to consider &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, along with other of the Ealing comedies, as &quot;conservative, but &#x27;mildly anarchic&#x27; daydreams, fantasies&quot;. At the close of the story, when the summer heatwave turns to a torrential downpour, the film has &quot;something of the quality of a fever-dream&quot;, according to Aldgate and Richards.

According to the film historian Robert Sellers, &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; &quot;captures the most quintessential English traits of individualism, tolerance and compromise&quot;; Duguid sees the examination of the English character as being &quot;at the heart&quot; of the film. This was one of the aspects that appealed to Margaret Rutherford, who liked the way the British were portrayed &quot;accentuating their individuality and decency, while acknowledging some parochial idiosyncracies&quot;.

==Production==
&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; was produced by Michael Balcon, the head of Ealing Studios; he appointed Henry Cornelius as director. The film was one of three comedies to be produced simultaneously, alongside &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; and &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;; all three were released into UK cinemas over two months.

The plot was an original story by T. E. B. Clarke, a writer of both comedy and drama scripts for Ealing; his other screenplays for the studio include &quot;Hue and Cry&quot; (1947), &quot;Against the Wind&quot; (1948), &quot;The Blue Lamp&quot; (1950), &quot;The Lavender Hill Mob&quot; (1951) and &quot;The Titfield Thunderbolt&quot; (1953). Clarke was inspired by an incident during the Second World War, when the maternity ward of Ottawa Civic Hospital was temporarily declared extraterritorial by the Canadian government so that when the then-Princess Juliana of the Netherlands gave birth to Princess Margriet of the Netherlands, the baby was born on Dutch territory, and would not lose her right to the throne. The airlift of food supplies into the Burgundian enclave was influenced by the flights of food and supplies during the Berlin Blockade of June 1948 – May 1949. 

The music for the film was composed by Georges Auric, who had been involved in several other productions for Ealing Studios.

The lead part of Pemberton was initially offered to Jack Warner. He turned down the role because he was committed to another film, and so the part was instead offered to Stanley Holloway. Alastair Sim was offered the role of Professor Hatton-Jones, but after he turned it down, Margaret Rutherford was cast instead.

===Filming===
&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; is set during a heatwave that occurred in Britain in 1947, but, despite this, filming took place during 1948&#x27;s abnormally wet summer. The poor weather caused delays in production, which led to the film being over-time and over-budget. Shooting started early each day, in an attempt to get the first successful shot completed before 9:00 am. An average of ten takes a day were taken, in an attempt to get two and a half minutes of usable film per day. There were arguments between Cornelius and Balcon throughout the production, because Balcon was unhappy with what he saw as poor direction. Cornelius left Ealing Studios after working on &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; and did not work for the studio again.

The outdoor scenes were not shot in Pimlico, but about a mile away in Lambeth. A set was built on a large Second World War bombsite just south of the Lambeth Road at the junction of Hercules Road. At the conclusion of filming, the site had to be returned to the same bomb-damaged state as before, to enable the locals to claim war damage compensation. The site has since been built on, and now features 1960s municipal flats.

==Release==
&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; was released into UK cinemas on 28 April 1949; the film was financially successful. For the US release on 23 October 1949, soil was imported and placed in front of the cinema; commissionaires in the uniform of a British policeman would hand out mock passports and invite passers-by to step onto English soil to see the film. The film was shown at the 1949 Cannes Film Festival, although it was not entered into the competition.
==Reception==
===Box office===
The film earned distributor&#x27;s gross receipts of £104,444 in the UK of which £81,436 went to the producer. The film made a loss of £251,938.
===Critical===
Critics warmly praised &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; on its release. Several commended the script. The reviewer for &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; thought that &quot;the chief credit for ... [this] joy of a film should go to T. E. B. Clarke&quot;. The unnamed reviewer for &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; considered that &quot;every line, every &#x27;gag&#x27;, is a little masterpiece of wit&quot;, while the critic C. A. Lejeune, writing for &quot;The Observer&quot;, thought that the writing and direction were excellent; she went on to record that &quot;the end comes too soon, which is something that can be said of very few films&quot;.

The acting was also praised by many of the critics; Lejeune thought that &quot;the acting of the countless small character parts that the plot brings together is splendid&quot;, while the reviewer for &quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; considered that &quot;each character, and indeed every individual member of the lengthy cast, provides a gem of comedy acting at its highest and best&quot;. &quot;The Manchester Guardian&quot; reviewer was critical about aspects of the direction which, it was said, was undertaken &quot;with barely sufficient skill to sustain the fun&quot;. The critic Henry Raynor, writing for &quot;Sight and Sound&quot;, thought that the film &quot;sacrificed a comic enquiry into motives and personality to a farcical romp ... It was carried through, not by wit or polish, but by a sometimes hysterical jollity&quot;.

&quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot; was nominated for the British Academy Film Award for Best British Film, alongside &quot;Whisky Galore!&quot; and &quot;Kind Hearts and Coronets&quot;, although they lost to &quot;The Third Man&quot; (1949); the film was also nominated for the Academy Award for Writing (Story and Screenplay), where it lost to &quot;Battleground&quot; (1949).

==Adaptations==
In 1952, a radio adaptation, written by Charles Hatton, was broadcast on the BBC&#x27;s Light Programme. Charles Leno played Pemberton, in a cast that included Christopher Lee, Gladys Henson and Kenneth Williams. A BBC Radio 4 adaptation, written by John Peacock, was broadcast on 20 January 1996. George Cole played the part of Pemberton; Michael Maloney and Joan Sims also appeared.

The 1993 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World 2&quot; was originally planned to be a remake of &quot;Passport to Pimlico&quot;, but shortly before filming was to begin, executives at Paramount Pictures realized that the studio had not acquired rights to the earlier film and ordered writer/star Mike Myers to write a new screenplay with a different plot.

<text>The Guanghua Temple (), also known as the South Mountain Guanghua Temple (), is a Buddhist temple located at the foot of Mount Phoenix (), about south of Putian City, Fujian Province, People&#x27;s Republic of China.

Built in the penultimate year of the Southern Chen dynasty (588 CE), it is one of the most influential Chinese Buddhism temples in China as well as one of the most scenic visitor attractions in Fujian Province.

==Location==
The temple stands about from the entrance to the Longmen Stone Cave () and is spread over an area of more than ,

== History and development ==

===Ancient times===
Constructed in 558 CE, the second year of Emperor Wu of Chen&#x27;s &quot;Yongding&quot; () era, the temple was originally called the Jinxian Monastery (), after its first abbot, Master Jinxian. In 589 CE, founding Sui dynasty Emperor Wen, a Buddhist adherent, extended the building and renamed it the &quot;Guanghua Temple&quot;.

During Emperor Xuanzong of Tang&#x27;s reign (685–762 CE), Indian monks came to discuss and lecture on Buddhism at the temple. Xuanzong also built a tower in the grounds. The temple changed its name again during the Tang dynasty when in 771 CE, the second year of his Jingyun () era, Emperor Ruizong of Tang dubbed it the Lingyan Temple () and had a signboard created by the renowned calligrapher Liu Gongquan.

Finally, during the early reign of Emperor Taizong of Song (r. 976–997 CE), the temple once more became the Guanghua Temple.

The establishment flourished during the Song (1279–1368) and Ming (1368–1644) Dynasties. Along with Fuzhou&#x27;s Gushan Spring Temple (), Quanzhou&#x27;s Kaiyuan Temple (), and Xiamen&#x27;s Nanputuo Temple, the Guanghua Temple was known as one of the four great Buddhist monasteries or &quot;Conglin&quot; () of Fujian Province.

In 1341 CE the Guanghua Monastery was destroyed during a war then rebuilt between 1368 and 1424 CE only to be once more razed to the ground by fire in 1562. In the second half of the sixteenth century the monastery underwent alterations and reconstruction.

Qing Kangxi Emperor carried out a comprehensive building program at the temple during 1692 and merged it with the nearby Fahai Temple ().

===Modern era===
By 1886 only the Avalokitesvara Pavilion, with two resident monks, remained of the monastery.

In 1890 Shanhe became president of the Guanghua Monastery and began a rebuilding program. The Jeweled Hall of the Great Heroes, Parlour, the Mediation Hall, the Abbot&#x27;s Room and the Brahma-carya Hall were all rebuilt to form the present-day complex. Master Benru built the additional Sutra Pavilion as an extension to the Dharma Hall, after Emperor Xuantong&#x27;s 1910 donation of more than 7,000 rolls of Dragon Sutra. In 1933, the Avalokitesvara Pavilion and the Heavenly King Palace were also rebuilt.

Until 1949 monasteries were built in other Southeast Asian countries by monks of the Guanghua Monastery to spread Chinese Buddhism. Presently, the Guanghua Monastery has seven branches in the Malay Peninsula and Indonesia.

At the foundation of the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 1949 the temple had a resident population of 60 monks, a figure which by 1965 had declined to 57. Used as a factory for a period during the turmoil of the Cultural Revolution (1966–1976), the monks were dispelled and all statues of deities smashed.

With opening up and reform during the late 1970s and the advent of religious freedom, Master Yuanchan () from the Yechengguang Garden Temple () in Indonesia together with other overseas Chinese began to support the Guanghua Temple. In 1979, a six-year restoration program began under the supervision of then 70-year-old Venerable Master Yuanzhou ().

In 1983 the temple became one of the Chinese Buddhism Regional Temples () whilst 36-year-old Master Yiran () became abbot. The same year, Venerable Master Yuanzhou funded the establishment of the new Fujian Buddhism Academy () on the site.

During the summer of 1996, in association with the Buddhist Association of China, more than 300 novice monks were initiated over a 108-day period. As of 2010, there are around 250 resident monks at the Guanghua Temple.

<doc id="254995" wikidata="Q183381" url="?curid=254995" title="Vasily Zaitsev (sniper)">
<text>Vasily Grigoryevich Zaitsev (; 23 March 1915 – 15 December 1991) was a Soviet sniper during World War II.

Between 22 September 1942 and 19 October 1942, he killed 40 enemy soldiers. Between 10 October 1942 and 17 December 1942, during the Battle of Stalingrad, he killed 225 enemy soldiers.

Zaitsev became a celebrated figure during the war and later a Hero of the Soviet Union, and he remains lauded for his skills as a sniper. His life and military career have been the subject of several books and films: his exploits, as detailed in William Craig&#x27;s 1973 book &quot;Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad&quot;, served as the story for the 2001 film &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot;, with Jude Law portraying Zaitsev. He is also featured in David L. Robbins&#x27;s 1999 historical novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot;.

==Early life==
Zaitsev was born in Yeleninskoye, Orenburg Governorate in a Russian peasant family and grew up in the Ural Mountains, where he learned marksmanship by hunting deer and wolves with his grandfather and older brother. He brought home his first trophy at the age of 12, a wolf that he killed with a single bullet from his first personal gun (given to him by his grandfather), a single-shot 20-gauge shotgun.

In 1930, Zaitsev graduated from construction college in the city of Magnitogorsk, where he received the speciality of fitter. He also studied accounting.

From 1937, Zaitsev served in the Pacific Fleet, where he was clerk of the artillery department. After studying at military school, he was appointed head of the finance department of the Pacific Fleet in Transfiguration Bay.

==Military career==
Zaitsev was serving in the Soviet Navy as a clerk in Vladivostok when Germany invaded the Soviet Union in Operation Barbarossa. Like many of his comrades, he volunteered for transfer to the front line. He had attained the rank of chief petty officer in the Navy and was assigned the rank of senior warrant officer upon transfer to the army. He was assigned to the 1047th Rifle Regiment of the 284th &quot;Tomsk&quot; Rifle Division, which became part of the 62nd Army at Stalingrad on 17 September 1942.

Zaitsev&#x27;s accuracy with a rifle led to him becoming a sniper. Zaitsev would conceal himself in various locations, for example on high ground, under rubble, or in water pipes. After a few kills, he would change his position or relocate. Together with his partner, Nikolai Kulikov, Zaitsev perfected his hide and sting tactics. One method was to cover a large area from three positions, with two men at each point – a sniper and a scout. This tactic, known as the &quot;sixes&quot;, is still in use today by Russian forces and was implemented during the Chechen wars.

Zaitsev fought at the Battle of Stalingrad until January 1943, when a mortar attack injured his eyes. Some conflicting stories state it was a landmine, but the doctor who treated Zaitsev and eventually restored his eyesight was ophthalmologist Vladimir Filatov, founder of the Filatov Institute of Eye Diseases and Tissue Therapy in Odessa, and a pioneer in corneal transplantation. Had Zaitsev been injured by a landmine, an ophthalmologist would not have treated him. According to Soviet sources, before his injury he had killed 225 people in the Battle of Stalingrad alone.

On 22 February 1943, Zaitsev was awarded the title Hero of the Soviet Union. Zaitsev recruited and trained other marksmen during his service in Stalingrad. He returned to the front, and finished the war at the Battle of the Seelow Heights in Germany, with the military rank of captain. He became a member of the All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks) in 1943.

==Civilian life==
After the war, Zaitsev settled in Kiev (now Kyiv), where he studied at a textile university before obtaining employment as an engineer. He rose to become the director of a textile factory, where he remained until his death on 15 December 1991 in Kiev, at the age of 76, just 11 days before the dissolution of the Soviet Union. He was buried in Kiev, although he wished to be buried in the Stalingrad land that he had defended.

==2006 commemoration==

On 31 January 2006, Vasily Zaitsev was reburied with full military honors at the Stalingrad memorial at Mamayev Kurgan in Volgograd, Russia.

==In popular culture==
===Film===
A feature-length film, &quot;Enemy at the Gates&quot; (2001), starring Jude Law as Zaitsev, was based on part of William Craig&#x27;s book &quot;Enemy at the Gates: The Battle for Stalingrad&quot; (1973), which includes a &quot;snipers&#x27; duel&quot; between Zaitsev and a Wehrmacht sniper school director, Major Erwin König. Zaitsev indicates in his own memoirs that a three-day duel did indeed occur and that the sniper he killed was the head of a sniper school near Berlin; however, historian Sir Antony Beevor states that the Russian Ministry of Defence archives contradict this and that the duel had been created by the Soviet propaganda. Russian researcher Oleg Kaminsky suggests that the duel could have been between Zaitsev and the German corporal Hermann Stoff of the 295th Infantry Division, who was responsible for 103 killed Red Army soldiers and commanders and who died in Stalingrad at this time.

===Literature===
David L. Robbins&#x27;s historical novel &quot;War of the Rats&quot; (1991) includes a sniper duel in Stalingrad, but between Zaitsev and a German adversary named Colonel Heinz Thorvald, identified in the author&#x27;s introduction as an actual combatant. Ramón Rosanas wrote a comic about the conflict between Zaitsev and König.

<doc id="255000" wikidata="Q2188747" url="?curid=255000" title="Brownies (Scouting)">
<text>Brownies are the section in the Girl Guides (or in the United States, Girl Scouts) organisation for girls aged seven years old to ten years old. Exact age limits are slightly different in each organisation.

==History==
Brownies, originally called Rosebuds, were first organised by Lord Baden-Powell in 1914 to complete the range of age groups for girls in Scouting. They were first run as the youngest group in the Guide Association by Agnes Baden-Powell, Lord Baden-Powell&#x27;s younger sister. In 1918, his wife, Lady Olave Baden-Powell, took over the responsibility for the Girl Guides and thus for Brownies.

Originally, the girls were called Rosebuds, but were renamed by Lord Baden-Powell after they complained that they did not like their name. Their name comes from the story &quot;The Brownies&quot; by Juliana Horatia Ewing, written in 1870. In the story, two children, Tommy and Betty, learn that children can be helpful brownies instead of being lazy boggarts.

In November 2022, the Girl Guides in Canada announced by January 2023 that they would rename this section of Guides, as it was deemed &quot;a barrier to racialised girls and women&quot; and to be more inclusive. In January 2023, the name Brownies was changed to Embers.

===Italy===
In some scouting associations in Italy, the term was maintained and extended to boys, coexisting with Wolf Cubs.

===United Kingdom===

In the United Kingdom, Brownies were originally called Rosebuds. Rosebuds was started in 1914 and was originally for girls aged 8–11. Rosebuds was renamed to Brownies in 1915. In 1937 Princess Margaret became the first royal Brownie.

Brownies is the second youngest section of Girlguiding in the UK, catering for girls aged 7–10. A group of Brownies who meet together is called a unit. Brownies work in small groups called sixes: each six is named after either fairies or woodland creatures. A six is led by a Sixer and has a Second who acts as deputy. The Brownie programme is called the Brownie Adventure. It is split into 3 parts: you, community, world.

Brownies work towards interest badges. there are 57. These can be done in meetings with the unit or at home or in clubs such as swimming. Brownies can also work towards their Adventure badges. These are gained over a period of time and require girls to complete many different activities, such as going on an adventure, taking part in an activity with another unit and earning an interest badge.

There are a few Brownie songs that some packs sing at the beginning of the meeting:

This is usually sung as each six skips under the brownie bridge and into the circle. It is often followed by the next song:

There are slight variations of the songs.

Some packs also sing one of the traditional songs to end a meeting, to the tune of the Cambridge Chimes:

The UK headquarters of Guides and Brownies is on Buckingham Palace Road in London.

<text>Pablo Soto Bravo (born 1979) is a Spanish software developer. He was municipal councillor of Madrid from 2015 to 2019.

In 2001 he developed the .MANOLITO protocol, Blubster and Piolet - two peer-to-peer file-sharing servants. In May 2006, Soto released Manolito, a third clone application, and new versions of Blubster and Piolet.

He apparently left the MP2P Community in 2004; subsequently Blubster and Piolet slowly began to lose their user base. By the end of 2004, when discussions on P2Pforums.com were focused on whether or not he had left the community for financial reasons, it was known that he has a rare form of muscular dystrophy, that has forced him to move in wheelchair.

Soto later put his energy into , an open source peer-to-peer software for storage space sharing (distributed computing).

In June 2008, Warner Music, Universal Music, Emi, Sony and the Spanish association PROMUSICAE filed a lawsuit against his company MP2P Technologies, demanding 13 million euros for &quot;unfair competition&quot;. He was acquitted on the charges of copyright violation in December 2011.

After the 2015 local elections Soto became a member of the City Council of Madrid with Ahora Madrid. He announced plans to promote usage of free software for the municipal software platforms, and is head of open government for the city. He has launched &quot;Decide Madrid&quot;, an online platform whereby citizens can propose policy for the city: a proposal supported by a number of users equal to 1 percent of the adult population is put before voters in a referendum. He renounced to his office as city councillor on 8 October 2019, after sexual misconduct allegations.

<doc id="255012" wikidata="Q435311" url="?curid=255012" title="Matthias Flacius">
<text>Matthias Flacius Illyricus (Latin; ) or Francovich () (3 March 1520 – 11 March 1575) was a Lutheran reformer from Istria, present-day Croatia. He was notable as a theologian, sometimes dissenting strongly with his fellow Lutherans, and as a scholar for his editorial work on the &quot;Magdeburg Centuries&quot;.
== Biography ==
=== Early life and education ===
Flacius was born in Labin (Albona) in Istria, son of Andrea Vlacich (Andrija Vlačić) alias Francovich and Jacobea (Jakovica) Luciani, daughter of a wealthy and powerful Albonian civic family. Her family was related by marriage to the local Lupetino (Lupetina) family: Jacobea&#x27;s brother, Luciano Luciani, married Ivanka Lupetina, the sister of the friar Baldo Lupetino (Lupetina), likewise born in Labin, who later was condemned to death in Venice for his Lutheran sympathies.

Andrea Vlacich was a small landowner, who died during his son&#x27;s early childhood. Flacius went also by the name Franković. He matriculated at the University of Basel in 1539 under the name &quot;Mattheus de Francistis [Franković] de Albona&quot;. Further, he himself signed a payment slip at the University of Wittenberg as &quot;Mathias Francovich Illyricus&quot;. The origin of the double surname is not clear, but it might have been a double last name resulting from marriage, his or some of his ancestors&#x27;. Likewise, the &#x27;Illyricus&#x27; is of uncertain origin, likely in reference to his place of origin, the historical province of Illyricum.

At the age of sixteen, Flacius went to study in Venice, where he was taught by the humanist Giambattista Cipelli (Baptista Aegnatius / Battista Egnazio). At the age of seventeen, he intended to join a monastic order, with a view to sacred learning. His intention, however, was diverted by his uncle-in-law, Baldo Lupetina, provincial of the Franciscans and sympathetic to the Reformation cause, who convinced him to start a university career.

Flacius continued his studies in Basel in 1539, then went to Tübingen and finally ended up in Wittenberg, where in (1541) he was welcomed by Philip Melanchthon. In Tübingen, Flacius was received into the house of Matthias Garbitius (Matija Grbac) a humanist and a professor of Greek at the University of Tübingen, who, like Flacius, was from Istria, and was called &quot;fellow countryman&quot; (&quot;conterraneous&quot;) by Flacius. There he came under the influence of Martin Luther. In 1544, Flacius was appointed professor of Hebrew at Wittenberg. He finished his master&#x27;s degree on 24 February 1546, ranking first among the graduates.

=== Career and teachings ===
Soon, Flacius was prominent in the theological discussions of the time, strenuously opposing the &quot;Augsburg Interim&quot;, and the compromise of Melanchthon known as the &quot;Leipzig Interim&quot;. Melanchthon wrote of him with venom as a renegade (&quot;aluimus in sinu serpentem&quot;, &quot;we have nourished a snake in our bosom&quot;). In 1549, Flacius moved to Magdeburg. On 7 May 1557, he was appointed professor of New Testament at the theological faculty in Jena but was soon involved in controversy with his colleague Victorinus Strigel on the synergistic question (relating to the function of the will in the conversion). He remained at the university between 1557 and 1562.

Affirming the natural inability of man, he adopted a position on sin as not being an accident of human nature, but involved in its substance, since The Fall of Man. Holding to a strong view of what Calvinists later called total depravity, Flacius insisted that human nature was entirely transformed by original sin, human beings were transformed from goodness and almost wholly corrupted with evil, making them kin to the Devil in his view, so that within them, without divine assistance, there lies no power even to cooperate with the Gospel when they hear it preached. Human acts of piety are valueless in themselves, and humans are entirely dependent on the grace of God for salvation. Those who agreed with him on this point, for example, Cyriacus Spangenberg, were termed Flacians.

Resisting ecclesiastical censure, he left Jena in December 1561 to found an academy at Regensburg. That assignment was not successful, so in October 1566 he accepted a call from the Lutheran community at Antwerp. Thence he was driven in early 1567 by the exigencies of war, and went to Frankfurt, where the authorities stood against him. He proceeded to Strasbourg where he was well received by the superintendent Johannes Marbach. Here again, his religious views caused controversies. The authorities ordered him to leave the city by May Day 1573. The prioress Catharina von Meerfeld of the secretly harboured him and his family in Frankfurt where he fell ill and died on 11 March 1575.

=== Impact and aftermath ===
Flacius&#x27; life was eventful in a turbulent epoch. He represents in some sense a move in the direction of the scientific study of church history in the modern sense and similarly of hermeneutics, though no doubt his impelling motive was not dispassionate but polemical, namely to prove the false premises of Roman Catholicism. His characteristic formula, &quot;historia est fundamentum doctrinae&quot;, is better understood now than in his own day.

According to Emil Petru Rațiu, the Moldovan president of the Andrei Glavina Cultural Association of the Istro-Romanians, Flacius could have been an ethnic Istro-Romanian. He based these claims on the fact that there used to be a notorious Istro-Romanian presence in Labin during the times in which Flacius lived, in the surname of his father (&quot;Vlacich&quot;, which could originate from &quot;Vlach&quot; and have been Latinized as &quot;Flacius&quot;) and other arguments.

=== Family life ===
In 1545, while at Wittenberg, Flacius married a pastor&#x27;s daughter. He had twelve children with his first wife before she died in 1564. He remarried the same year in Regensburg and had six more children with his second wife. His son was professor of logic and medicine at Rostock.

<text>Richard Jobson (fl. 1620–1623) was an English explorer of West Africa. He is only known from his writings on his 1620–1621 voyage to the Gambia River.
==Life==
He was appointed in 1620 to command an expedition to explore the River Gambia, for a group of adventurers. Former attempts in 1618 and 1619 had been failure, because of consequence of the hostility of the Portuguese and health problems.

Jobson, sailing from England on 25 October 1620, and arriving at the mouth of the Gambia on 17 November, went up the river beyond the Barrakunda Falls, to an area he called Tenda, meaning river crossing in Mandinka. Jobson visited several places recognizable in modern places names including Wuli, Kantora, and Sutukoba. He did not find the gold he sought.

Somewhere in Gambia, Jobson refused to purchase some female slaves, stating that &quot;We were a people, who did not deal in any such commodities, neither did wee buy or sell one another, or any that had our owne shapes;&quot;

After his return to England in 1621, Jobson published &quot;The Golden Trade&quot;. He gives accounts of the Africans, then largely unknown to the English, though they had overland trade 
to the north coast.

<text>Richard Jobson (born 6 October 1960) is a Scottish filmmaker (director, writer, producer) who also works as a television presenter. He is also known as the singer-songwriter of the band Skids.

==Early life==
Jobson was born in Kirkcaldy and grew up in Crosshill and Ballingry in Fife, the son of a miner and a worker at Rosyth Dockyard. He attended St Columba&#x27;s Roman Catholic High School, Dunfermline. His family were of Irish Catholic descent.

==Skids==
Jobson is the lead singer with the punk rock group Skids, whose original run was from 1977-1982. Jobson&#x27;s singing-style with Skids was highly distinctive, and he wrote the lyrics, while Stuart Adamson wrote most of the music.

&quot;Scared to Dance&quot;, the first Skids album, included the 1979 hit single &quot;Into the Valley&quot;, the group&#x27;s most successful single. Jobson appeared on BBC Television&#x27;s &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; singing it. &quot;The Saints are Coming&quot; was also on the album. Jobson said it was about the death of a friend in the British Army. Much of &quot;Scared to Dance&quot; featured local references, and also Jobson&#x27;s fascination with the two world wars.

The fourth album by Skids, &quot;Joy&quot;, released in 1981, was almost entirely written by Jobson and Russell Webb, as the other two band members left, one of whom was Jobson&#x27;s long-time songwriting partner Stuart Adamson who moved on to form his new band Big Country.

In September 2006 Green Day and U2 recorded a cover version of &#x27;The Saints are Coming&#x27; for charitable purposes.

Skids including Jobson reformed from 2007 to 2010, and again from 2016 to present.

==Other musical work==
Jobson and Russell Webb both shared a common interest in the War Poets, a theme which was in evidence for Jobson&#x27;s solo album &quot;Ballad of Etiquette&quot; and which bore a credit for &#x27;Virginia &amp; Josephine&#x27; (Wells). This album was released in November 1981, and peaked on the UK indie charts at number 24. At the same time Astley, Nicky Holland and Kate St John auditioned for Bill Drummond at the Zoo Club in Liverpool where they made their live debut.

In 1983, Jobson formed another band with Russell Webb and John McGeoch, called The Armoury Show — named after a 1913 New York modernist art exhibition. Jobson and Webb also worked with Virginia Astley. Webb co-produced her first album &quot;From Gardens Where We Feel Secure&quot;.

Both Astley and Jobson did recording sessions for Les Disques Du Crépuscule, a Belgian record label, and Jobson made several albums for the label, usually of poetry readings with Astley as his accompanist. At the same time the final Skids album &quot;Joy&quot; was released, Astley and Nicky Holland appeared as backing vocalists; Astley also played flute on the single &quot;Fields&quot;.

Jobson was doing poetry readings at Richard Strange&#x27;s Cabaret Futura club, in 1981 and &#x27;82, and featured on an album of live performances recorded at the club. The album, Fools Rush In Where Angels Dare to Tread, was issued on the Martyrwell label by Strange and Nick Stewart via Island Records and was engineered by Astley&#x27;s brother Jon Astley. Amongst a lot of strange-sounding and difficult music was the first ever recording by Kissing the Pink.

For Crépuscule&#x27;s various artists compilation LP &quot;The Fruit of the Original Sin&quot;, Jobson performed a poem called &#x27;Homage To Marguerite Duras&#x27; with music by Astley.

In the mid-1980s Astley and Jobson toured Japan to promote his album &quot;An Afternoon in Company&quot;. Much of Jobson&#x27;s spoken-word material for the Cocteau and Crépuscule labels has been reissued on CD by the LTM label.

==Television and film career==
From the mid-1980s, Jobson became a prolific front man for music and arts programmes on the BBC, ITV and Sky.
Jobson became a presenter on arts magazine programme &quot;01 for London&quot; from 1988 to 1992, as well as being music reporter and interviewer across the same period for BBC daytime show &quot;The Garden Party&quot;. He was also a film reviewer for Sky Television, and in the mid 1990s presented a late-night ITV series &quot;Hollywood Report&quot; that aired in many of the network&#x27;s regions. Katie Wagner worked as a reporter on the show. 

In June 2013, Jobson was awarded an honorary degree (Doctor of Arts) from Edinburgh Napier University.

<doc id="255026" wikidata="Q330100" url="?curid=255026" title="A. J. Muste">
<text>Abraham Johannes Muste ( ; January 8, 1885 – February 11, 1967), usually cited as A. J. Muste, was a Dutch-born American clergyman and political activist. He is best remembered for his work in the labor movement, pacifist movement, antiwar movement, and civil rights movement.

==Early life==
Muste was born on January 8, 1885, in the small port city of Zierikzee, Zeeland, in the southwestern Netherlands. His father, Martin Muste, was a coachman who drove for a family that was part of Zeeland&#x27;s hereditary nobility. With his economic prospects limited in the Netherlands, Martin decided to follow four brothers of his wife, Adriana, and emigrate to America. They made the trans-Atlantic trip as third-class passengers in January 1891.

Muste&#x27;s mother became ill aboard ship and remained hospitalized for a month at Ellis Island after the family&#x27;s arrival. Upon her recovery, the family headed west for Grand Rapids, Michigan, where Adriana&#x27;s four brothers worked at in a variety of small business pursuits.

The family attended services at the Grand Rapids Dutch Reformed Church, a Calvinist congregation in which religious services were conducted in Dutch. Its very existence was testimony to the number of Dutch immigrants in the area. Dancing was prohibited as sin by the church. Also, the singing of secular music and the viewing of dramatic performances were forbidden.

Members of the denomination tended to be of the working class, like most other Dutch people in the area, who were regarded as a source of cheap labor in the years before World War I by the longer-established English-speaking population. Muste later recalled of his fellow Dutch Reformed Church members that they were &quot;all Republicans and would no more have voted for a Democrat than turned horse thief.&quot;

Along with the rest of his family, he became naturalized as an American citizen in 1896. He was only 11 years old at the time of his naturalization.

==Education and pastoral career==
Muste attended Hope College in Holland, Michigan, just west of Grand Rapids, on the coast of Lake Michigan. He graduated in 1905 with a bachelor&#x27;s degree at age 20. At Hope College, he was class valedictorian, captain of the school&#x27;s basketball team, and played second base for the baseball squad.

After his graduation, Muste taught Latin and Greek for the 1905–06 academic year at Northwestern Classical Academy (now Northwestern College) in Orange City, Iowa.

In the fall of 1906, Muste went east to New Brunswick, New Jersey, to attend the Theological Seminary of the Dutch Reformed Church (now the New Brunswick Theological Seminary). While there, Muste took courses in philosophy at New York University and Columbia University, attended lectures by William James, and met John Dewey, who became a personal friend. While he remained in training to become a minister of the Reformed Church, Muste seems to have begun to question the church&#x27;s fundamental principles at that time.

He graduated in June 1909 and married his sweetheart from his Hope College days, Anna Huizenga. Muste then was appointed pastor of the Fort Washington Collegiate Church in the Washington Heights neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. In his spare time, he used his new parish&#x27;s proximity to the theologically-liberal Union Theological Seminary to take additional courses there. He ultimately received a Bachelor of Divinity from Union, graduating &quot;magna cum laude.&quot;

Muste was influenced by the prevalent theology of the social gospel and began reading the ideas of various radical thinkers of the day. He voted for Socialist candidate Eugene V. Debs for U.S. president in 1912. Muste would later state that he never again voted for a Republican or Democrat for a major national or state office.

Muste remained as pastor of the Fort Washington Collegiate Church on Washington Heights until 1914, when he became increasingly uncomfortable with the Reformed Church and left it.

Thereafter, he became an independent Congregationalist minister and accepted a pastorate at the Central Congregational Church of Newtonville, Massachusetts in February 1915.

A committed pacifist, Muste joined the Fellowship of Reconciliation shortly after its foundation in 1916. He participated in a peace demonstration late in the summer of 1916, with US entry into the First World War looming and some parishioners withdrawing from his congregation. Pressure began to build further over Muste&#x27;s pacifist views in April 1917, when the United States formally declared war on the German and Austro-Hungarian Empires. After taking two months of vacation leave in the summer of 1917, he decided that the time had come to leave. In December 1917, he formally resigned his pastorate position.

After his resignation, Muste did volunteer work for Boston chapter of the new Civil Liberties Bureau, a legal-aid organization that defended both political and pacifist war resisters.

Later in 1918, he moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he was enrolled as a Religious Society of Friends (Quaker) minister. He received the use of a home and money for expenses in exchange for pastoral services. An array of political publications was kept in a large room in the basement of the Providence Meeting House, and each Saturday, pacifists, radicals, and an eclectic mix of individuals gathered there to discuss issues of concern.

==1919 Lawrence textile strike==
Muste became involved in trade union activity in 1919, when he took an active part as a leader of a 16-week-long textile strike in Lawrence, Massachusetts. Workers in the mills worked an average of 54 hours a week, at an average rate of just over 20 cents per hour, and were threatened with a loss of income by an uncompensated cut of working hours. A demand grew among the millworkers for 54 hours of pay for the new working week of 48 hours.

However, as most workers were new immigrants who spoke English poorly or not at all, they were without effective leadership to express their demands. When dissident workers walked off the job in February 1919 only to be met by police truncheons on the picket line, Muste and two friends, also ministers, became involved. He spoke to assembled workers, assured them that he would lend whatever help he could in raising money for the relief of strikers and their families, and was soon invited to become executive secretary of the &quot;ad hoc&quot; strike committee that had been established by the still unorganized workers. 
He became the spokesman for some 30,000 striking workers from more than 20 countries. Himself pulled from the picket line as a strike leader, isolated, and clubbed by police, he was eventually deposited into a wagon and hauled to jail when he could no longer stand. After a week behind bars, the case against Muste for allegedly disturbing the peace was dismissed. More than 100 strikers were jailed but the strike continued.

While the police anticipated more violence and even placed machine guns at critical points along Lawrence&#x27;s principal streets, Muste and the strike committee chose nonviolence. He advised the striking textile workers to &quot;smile as we pass the machine guns and the police.&quot; Despite the efforts of agents provocateurs, the strike remained peaceful.

The strike was eventually settled after 16 weeks, after both sides neared exhaustion and became willing to compromise. The ultimate agreement called for a shortened working week, a 12% hike in hourly and piecework wages, and the recognition of shop grievance committees in all departments.

==Amalgamated Textile Workers of America==
While the Lawrence textile strike was going on, Muste traveled to New York City to attend a convention of trade union activists in the textile industry. The gathering resulted in the formation of the Amalgamated Textile Workers of America (ATWU). Based upon his prominence as the head of the Lawrence textile strike and shutdown, he was elected secretary of the new union.

Muste would serve as head of the fledgling union for two years until he stepped down from his post in 1921.

==Brookwood and CPLA==
Upon leaving the ATWU, Muste became the first chairman of the faculty at Brookwood Labor College in Katonah, New York, where he remained from 1921 to 1933. He cemented his reputation as a recognized leader of the American labor movement.

In 1929, Muste attempted to organize radical unionists opposed to the passive policies of American Federation of Labor President William Green under the banner of the new Conference for Progressive Labor Action (CPLA).

Muste also was a member of the League for Independent Political Action (LIPA), a group of liberals and socialists that was headed by philosopher John Dewey and sought the establishment of a new labor-based third party. He resigned his position on the LIPA Executive Committee in December 1930 in protest over Dewey&#x27;s appeal to US Senator George W. Norris of Nebraska to quit the Republican Party to head the third-party movement. Muste declared that any such movement must start from the bottom up by the action of organized workers if it was to survive and that it was &quot;of the utmost importance to avoid every appearance of seeking messiahs who are to bring down a third party out of the political heavens.&quot;

==Party politics==

In 1933, Muste&#x27;s CPLA took the step of establishing itself as the core of a new political organization, the American Workers Party, which was informally referred to as &quot;Musteite&quot; by its contemporaries.

The AWP then merged with the Trotskyist Communist League of America in 1934 to establish the Workers Party of the United States. Muste meanwhile remained a labor activist and led the victorious Toledo Auto-Lite strike in 1934.

==Return to pacifism==

In 1936, Muste resigned from the Workers Party and left socialist politics to return to his roots as a Christian pacifist. He became director of the Presbyterian Labor Temple in New York City from 1937 to 1940 where he paid special attention to combating Marxism and to proclaiming Christianity as a revolutionary doctrine. He also lectured at Union Theological Seminary and Yale Divinity School.

From 1940 to 1953, he was the executive director of the Fellowship of Reconciliation, an influential Protestant pacifist organization, where he did antiwar work, advocated nonviolence within the Protestant ecumenical movement, and helped mentor a number of the future leaders of the Civil Rights Movement, including Bayard Rustin. Rustin, a close advisor of Martin Luther King Jr., later claimed that he never made a difficult decision without talking about it first with Muste.

Muste supported the presidential candidacies of Debs and Robert M. La Follette Sr. and also had close friendships with Dewey and socialist leader Norman Thomas. Muste&#x27;s support for civil liberties led him to oppose McCarthyism during the Cold War. That led to accusations of communism, although his writings after 1936 are deeply critical of communism.

In 1951, to protest the Cold War, he and 48 others filed Thoreau&#x27;s essay &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot; instead of their 1040 Forms.

In 1956, he and David Dellinger founded &quot;Liberation&quot; as a forum for the pacifist and antiwar left.

In 1957, Muste headed a delegation of pacifist and democratic observers to the 16th National Convention of the Communist Party. He was also on the national committee of the War Resisters League (WRL) and received its Peace Award in 1958. Always a creative activist, he led public opposition with Dorothy Day to civil defense activities in New York City during the 1950s and 1960s.

At the end of his life, Muste took a leadership role in the movement against the Vietnam War. According to legend, he stood outside the White House every night during the Vietnam War, holding a candle whether or not it was raining. In fact, he worked many days and nights during the last two years of his life to build a coalition of antiwar groups, including the Spring Mobilization Committee to End the War in Vietnam, which organized massive protests against the war.

In 1966, Muste traveled with members of the Committee for Non-Violent Action to Saigon and Hanoi. He was arrested and deported from South Vietnam but received a warm welcome in North Vietnam from its leader Ho Chi Minh.

==Death and legacy==
Muste died February 11, 1967, at age 82. Norman Thomas remembered him as someone who made a &quot;remarkable effort to show that pacifism was by no means passivism and that there could be such a thing as a non-violent social revolution.&quot;

The A.J. Muste Memorial Institute was located at 339 Lafayette Street in New York City, the so-called &quot;Peace Pentagon,&quot; until sold in 2016 because it required prohibitively expensive structural repairs. The Institute provides office space for various activist groups, which now reside at its new location at 168 Canal Street in Chinatown. Tenant organizations include the War Resisters League and the Socialist Party USA.

During a 1969 debate with William F. Buckley Jr., Noam Chomsky cited Muste as &quot;someone who did take a very strong, and I think very honourable position&quot; on opposing World War II. Chomsky discusses Muste&#x27;s legacy in &quot;American Power and the New Mandarins&quot;.

<text>Nicholas Udall (or Uvedale Udal, Woodall, or other variations) (1504 – 23 December 1556) was an English playwright, cleric, schoolmaster, the author of &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot;, generally regarded as the first comedy written in the English language.

==Biography==
Udall was born in Hampshire and educated at Winchester College, then at Corpus Christi College, Oxford, where he held a scholarship. In 1524 he was elected a probationer fellow and probably took his B.A. He was tutored under the guidance of Thomas Cromwell, who mentions him in a letter to John Creke of 17 August 1523 as &#x27;Maister Woodall&#x27;.

In 1527/1528, Udall was in trouble with his college for having or reading heretical books, but he was allowed to remain in college. In 1533 he was a schoolmaster at a grammar school in London. 

In 1534 Udall took the degree of M.A. and was appointed headmaster of Eton College. He appears in Cromwell&#x27;s accounts for 1535 as &#x27;Nicholas Woodall Master of Eton&#x27;. He taught Latin at Eton and was headmaster there until 1541, when he was forced to leave after being convicted of offences against his pupils under the Buggery Act 1533. The felony of buggery, like all other felonies, carried a sentence of capital punishment by hanging, but Udall wrote an impassioned plea to his old friends from Cromwell&#x27;s household Thomas Wriothesley and Sir Ralph Sadler, then joint king&#x27;s Secretaries, and his sentence was commuted to imprisonment for just under a year, which he served in the Marshalsea. The boys in question were not prosecuted. A former pupil, the poet Thomas Tusser, later claimed that Udall had flogged him without cause.

An adherent of the Reformed Church of England, Udall flourished under Edward VI and survived into the reign of the Roman Catholic Mary I. In 1547, he became Vicar of Braintree, in 1551 of Calborne, Isle of Wight, and in 1554 returned to teaching as headmaster of Westminster School.

Udall died in 1556 and was buried in the churchyard of St Margaret&#x27;s, Westminster. No monumental inscription can now be traced.

==Works==
Udall translated part of the &quot;Apophthegms&quot; by Erasmus, and translated in part and oversaw the English version of the &quot;Paraphrases of Erasmus&quot;, published in 1548 as &quot;The first tome or volume of the Paraphrase of Erasmus vpon the newe testamente&quot;. Other works he translated were Pietro Martire&#x27;s &quot;Discourse on the Eucharist&quot; and Thomas Gemini&#x27;s &quot;Anatomia&quot;. His most famous work, the play &quot;Ralph Roister Doister&quot;, was probably presented to Queen Mary as an entertainment around 1553, but not published until 1566.

With John Leland, he wrote a number of songs in Latin and English for pageants marking the coronation of Anne Boleyn on 31 May 1533, using his Latinized name &quot;Udallus&quot;. In the same year, he published &quot;Flovres for Latine Spekynge&quot;, a collection of material from his comedy and works by the Roman poet Terence put together for his pupils.

Udall wrote a propaganda tract in response to the Prayer Book Rebellion in 1549, &quot;An Answer to the Articles of the Commoners of Devonshire and Cornwall Declaring to the Same How they have been Seduced by Evil Persons&quot;. This tract has sometimes been wrongly attributed to Philip Nichols.

It has been argued that Udall is the author of the dramatic interlude &quot;Respublica&quot;, which was acted before Queen Mary in 1553.

==In literature==
In Ford Madox Ford&#x27;s trilogy of historical novels &quot;The Fifth Queen&quot;, the character Magister Nicholas Udal is a decidedly heterosexual profligate, who serves as Latin tutor to Princess Mary and to Henry VIII&#x27;s fifth queen, Katharine Howard. He defends himself against charges that he was &quot;thrown out of his mastership at Eton for his foul living&quot; by claiming that he, a Protestant, &quot;was undone by Papist lies.&quot;

<text>Meizhou Island (; Pu-Xian Min: &quot;Mî-ciu-doh&quot;), Meichow; Meichou, is a small island close to the coast of China. Meizhou Town () is an administrative unit of Xiuyu District, Putian, Fujian, China. It is known for being the birthplace of the goddess Mazu. Meizhou has 38,000 inhabitants, most of whom are involved in the fishing industry. The local language spoken is Pu-Xian Min.

== History ==

An open provincial tourism economic region () since June 1988, in April 1992 Meizhou Island introduced a landing visa policy for visitors from Taiwan. In October of the same year it became a national tourism-vacation region (). The island was formally opened to visitors from overseas in October 1999.

Annually, Taiwanese pilgrims come to Meizhou to see the place where Mazu once lived. Under Xi Jinping, Mazu-related pilgrimages have become an avenue for Chinese Communist Party influence operations to promote Chinese unification. 

==Administration==
Meizhou Island is administered by Meizhou Town, an area that is divided into 11 villages:
* Gaozhu ()
* Xiashan () &quot;Downhill&quot;
* Lianche () &quot;Lotus Pond&quot;
* Beidai (北埭 dài) &quot;North Dam&quot;
* Dongcai () &quot;The East Cais&quot;
* Xiting () &quot;The Western Pavilion&quot;
* Ganglou () &quot;The Tower by the Port&quot;
* Zhaixia () &quot;Lower Village&quot;
* Dayang () &quot;Great Ocean&quot;

along with three others.

== Geography ==

Located in the northern part of the mouth of Meizhou Bay, Meizhou Island covers an area of and measures north-south, and east-west. The beach runs for around .

== Tourist attractions ==
The Heavenly Empress Palace-Meizhou Ancestral Temple () began as a small shrine soon after Mazu&#x27;s death in the 10th century. It has now been renovated and greatly enlarged to accommodate pilgrims.

<doc id="255030" wikidata="Q7288034" url="?curid=255030" title="Ralph Roister Doister">
<text>Ralph Roister Doister is a sixteenth-century play by Nicholas Udall, which was once regarded as the first comedy to be written in the English language.

The date of its composition is disputed, but the balance of opinion suggests that it was written in about 1552, when Udall was a schoolmaster in London, and some theorise the play was intended for public performance by his pupils—who were all male, as were most actors in that period. The work was not published until 1567, 11 years after its author&#x27;s death.

==Sources==
Roister Doister seems to have been inspired by the works of Plautus and Terence. The title character is a variation on the &quot;Braggart Soldier&quot; archetype, but with the innovation of a parasitic tempter which stems from the morality play tradition. By combining the structures, conventions, and styles of the ancient Greek and Roman comedies with English theatrical traditions and social types (especially the relatively new and burgeoning English middle classes), Udall was able to establish a new form of English comedy, leading directly through to Shakespeare and beyond. The play blends the stock plot-elements and stock characters of the ancient Greek and Roman theatre with those of chivalric literature and the English mediaeval theatre.

==Plot==
The play is written in five acts. The plot of the play centres on a rich widow, Christian Custance, who is betrothed to Gawyn Goodluck, a merchant. Ralph Roister Doister is encouraged throughout by a con-man trickster figure (Matthew Merrygreeke) to woo Christian Custance, but his pompous attempts do not succeed. Ralph then tries with his friends and servants (at Merrygreek&#x27;s behest) to break in and take Christian Custance by force, but they are defeated by her maids and run away. The merchant Gawyn arrives shortly after and the play concludes happily with reconciliation, a prayer and a song.

==Characters==
*Ralph Roister Doister
*Mathew Merygreeke
*Gawyn Goodluck, affianced to Dame Custance
*Tristram Trustie, his friend
*Dobinet Doughtie, servant to Roister Doister
*Tom Trupenie, servant to Dame Custance
*Sym Suresby, servant to Goodluck
*Scrivener
*Harpax, servant to Roister Doister
*Dame Christian Custance, a widow
*Margerie Mumblecrust, her nurse
*Tibet Talkapace, her maid
*Annot Alyface, her maid

==Performance history==
Readings and stagings of the play have taken place throughout the 20th century, notably a 1910 production by the Philolexian Society of Columbia University and a 1953 presentation by Oxford University students at the Edinburgh Festival. Three adaptations of the play appeared in the 1930s, 1960s, and 1980s.

<text>Hydrangeaceae is a family of flowering plants in the order Cornales, with a wide distribution in Asia and North America, and locally in southeastern Europe.

==Description==
The genera are characterised by leaves in opposite pairs (rarely whorled or alternate), and regular, bisexual flowers with four (rarely 5–12) petals. The fruit is a capsule or berry containing several seeds, the seeds with a fleshy endosperm.

==Genera==
The following genera are accepted:
* &quot;Carpenteria&quot; 
* &quot;Deutzia&quot; 
* &quot;Fendlera&quot; 
* &quot;Fendlerella&quot; 
* &quot;Hydrangea&quot; 
* &quot;Jamesia&quot; 
* &quot;Kirengeshoma&quot; 
* &quot;Philadelphus&quot; 
* &quot;Whipplea&quot; 

== Phylogeny ==
The family Hydrangeaceae has two subfamilies, namely Jamesioideae and Hydrangeoideae. The subfamily Jamesioideae comprises the genera Jamesia and Fendlera. They are the sister group to the remaining Hydrangeaceae. The subfamily Hydrangeoideae has two tribes: Hydrangeae consists of Hydrangea s.l., and Philadelpheae consists of &quot;Philadelphus&quot;, &quot;Carpenteria&quot;, &quot;Deutzia&quot;, &quot;Kirengeshoma&quot;, &quot;Whipplea&quot;, and &quot;Fendlerella&quot;. &quot;Carpenteria&quot; is the sister group to &quot;Philadelphus&quot;. &quot;Deutzia&quot; is the sister group to &quot;Kirengeshoma&quot;, and &quot;Fendlerella&quot; is the sister group to &quot;Whipplea&quot;. However the relationships among those three clades within the tribe Philadelphae are a bit unclear. The following cladogram summarizes results from different studies, and for each node it is noted which studies support the sister group positions of the following branches:

<doc id="255039" wikidata="Q10713" url="?curid=255039" title="Luwian language">
<text>Luwian (), sometimes known as Luvian or Luish, is an ancient language, or group of languages, within the Anatolian branch of the Indo-European language family. The ethnonym Luwian comes from &quot;Luwiya&quot; (also spelled &quot;Luwia&quot; or &quot;Luvia&quot;) – the name of the region in which the Luwians lived. Luwiya is attested, for example, in the Hittite laws.

The two varieties of Luwian are known after the scripts in which they were written: Cuneiform Luwian (&quot;CLuwian&quot;) and Hieroglyphic Luwian (&quot;HLuwian&quot;). There is no consensus as to whether these were a single language or two closely related languages.

==Classification==

Several other Anatolian languages – particularly Carian, Lycian, and Milyan (also known as Lycian B or Lycian II) – are now usually identified as related to Luwian – and as mutually connected more closely than other constituents of the Anatolian branch. This suggests that these languages formed a sub-branch within Anatolian. Some linguists follow Craig Melchert in referring to this broader group as Luwic, whereas others refer to the &quot;Luwian group&quot; (and, in that sense, &quot;Luwian&quot; may mean several distinct languages). Likewise, Proto-Luwian may mean the common ancestor of the whole group, or just the ancestor of Luwian (normally, under tree-naming conventions, were the branch to be called Luwic, its ancestor should be known as Proto-Luwic or Common Luwic; in practice, such names are seldom used). Luwic or Luwian (in the broad sense of the term), is one of three major sub-branches of Anatolian, alongside Hittite and Palaic.

As Luwian has numerous archaisms, it is regarded as important to the study of Indo-European languages (&quot;IE&quot;) in general, the other Anatolian languages, and the Bronze Age Aegean. These archaisms are often regarded as supporting the view that the Proto-Indo-European language (&quot;PIE&quot;) had three distinct sets of velar consonants: plain velars, palatovelars, and labiovelars. For Melchert, PIE &#x27; → Luwian &quot;z&quot; (probably ); &#x27; → &quot;k&quot;; and &quot;&quot; → &quot;ku&quot; (probably ). Luwian has also been enlisted for its verb &quot;kalut(t)i(ya)-&quot;, which means &quot;make the rounds of&quot; and is probably derived from &quot;*kalutta/i-&quot; &quot;circle&quot;. It has been argued that this derives from a proto-Anatolian word for &quot;wheel&quot;, which in turn would have derived from the common word for &quot;wheel&quot; found in all other Indo-European families. The wheel was invented in the 5th millennium BC and, if &quot;kaluti&quot; does derive from it, then the Anatolian branch left PIE after its invention (so validating the Kurgan hypothesis as applicable to Anatolian). However, &quot;kaluti&quot; need not imply a wheel and so need not have been derived from a PIE word with that meaning, and the IE words for a wheel may well have arisen in those other IE languages after the Anatolian split.

==Geographic and chronological distribution==
Luwian was among the languages spoken during the 2nd and 1st millennia BC by groups in central and western Anatolia and northern Syria. The earliest Luwian texts in cuneiform transmission are attested in connection with the Kingdom of Kizzuwatna in southeastern Anatolia, as well as a number of locations in central Anatolia. Beginning in the 14th century BC, Luwian-speakers came to constitute the majority in the Hittite capital Hattusa. It appears that by the time of the collapse of the Hittite Empire &quot;ca&quot;. 1180 BC, the Hittite king and royal family were fully bilingual in Luwian. Long after the extinction of the Hittite language, Luwian continued to be spoken in the Neo-Hittite states of Syria, such as Milid and Carchemish, as well as in the central Anatolian kingdom of Tabal that flourished in the 8th century BC.

A number of scholars in the past attempted to argue for the Luwian homeland in western Anatolia. According to James Mellaart, the earliest Indo-Europeans in northwest Anatolia were the horse-riders who came to this region from the north and founded Demircihöyük (Eskişehir Province) in Phrygia c. 3000 BC. They were allegedly ancestors of the Luwians who inhabited Troy II, and spread widely in the Anatolian peninsula. He cited the distribution of a new type of wheel-made pottery, Red Slip Wares, as some of the best evidence for his theory. According to Mellaart, the proto-Luwian migrations to Anatolia came in several distinct waves over many centuries. The recent detailed review of Mellaart&#x27;s claims suggests that his ethnolinguistic conclusions cannot be substantiated on archaeological grounds.

Other arguments were advanced for the extensive Luwian presence in western Anatolia in the late second millennium BC. In the Old Hittite version of the Hittite Code, some, if not all, of the Luwian-speaking areas were called &quot;Luwiya&quot;. Widmer (2007) has argued that the Mycenaean term &quot;ru-wa-ni-jo&quot;, attested in Linear B, refers to the same area. but the stem *&quot;Luwan-&quot; was recently shown to be non-existent. In a corrupt late copy of the Hittite Code the geographical term &quot;Luwiya&quot; is replaced with &quot;Arzawa&quot; a western Anatolian kingdom corresponding roughly with Mira and the Seha River Land. Therefore, several scholars shared the view that Luwian was spoken—to varying degrees—across a large portion of western Anatolia, including Troy (&quot;Wilusa&quot;), the Seha River Land (&quot;Sēḫa&quot; ~ &quot;Sēḫariya&quot;, i.e., the Greek Hermos river and Kaikos valley), and the Mira-Kuwaliya kingdom with its core being the Maeander valley. In a number of recent publications, however, the geographic identity between Luwiya and Arzawa was rejected or doubted. In the post-Hittite era, the region of Arzawa came to be known as Lydia (Assyrian &quot;Luddu&quot;, Greek Λυδία), where the Lydian language was in use. The name &quot;Lydia&quot; has been derived from the name &quot;Luwiya&quot; (Lydian *&quot;lūda&quot;- &lt; *&quot;luw(i)da&quot;- &lt; &quot;luwiya&quot;-, with regular Lydian sound change &quot;y&quot; &gt; &quot;d&quot;). The Lydian language, however, cannot be regarded as the direct descendant of Luwian and probably does not even belong to the Luwic group (see Anatolian languages). Therefore, none of the arguments in favour of the Luwian linguistic dominance in Western Asia Minor can be regarded as compelling, although the issue continues to be debated.

==Script and dialects==
Luwian was split into many dialects, which were written in two different writing systems. One of these was the &quot;Cuneiform Luwian&quot; which used the form of Old Babylonian cuneiform that had been adapted for the Hittite language. The other was &quot;Hieroglyphic Luwian&quot;, which was written in a unique native hieroglyphic script. The differences between the dialects are minor, but they affect vocabulary, style, and grammar. The different orthographies of the two writing systems may also hide some differences.

According to Hittitologist Alwin Kloekhorst, Hieroglyphic Luwian may also be known as Empire Luwian or Iron Age Luwian, and is &quot;closely related&quot; to Cuneiform Luwian. Similarly, Alice Mouton and Ilya Yakubovich separate Luwian into two distinct varieties: cuneiform and hieroglyphic – the latter of a more prestigious and elite use.

===Cuneiform Luwian===

Cuneiform Luwian (or Kizzuwatna Luwian) is the corpus of Luwian texts attested in the tablet archives of Hattusa; it is essentially the same cuneiform writing system used in Hittite. In Laroche&#x27;s &quot;Catalog of Hittite Texts,&quot; the corpus of Hittite cuneiform texts with Luwian insertions runs from CTH 757–773, mostly comprising rituals. Cuneiform Luwian texts are written in several dialects, of which the most easily identifiable are Kizzuwatna Luwian, Ištanuwa Luwian, and Empire Luwian. The last dialect represents the vernacular of Hattusan scribes of the 14th–13th centuries BC and is mainly attested through &quot;Glossenkeil&quot; words in Hittite texts.

Compared to cuneiform Hittite, logograms (signs with a set symbolic value) are rare. Instead, most writing is done with the syllabic characters, where a single symbol stands for a vowel, or a consonant-vowel pair (either VC or CV). A striking feature is the consistent use of &#x27;full-writing&#x27; to indicate long vowels, even at the beginning of words. In this system a long vowel is indicated by writing it twice. For example, &quot;īdi&quot; &quot;he goes&quot; is written &quot;i-i-ti&quot; rather than &quot;i-ti&quot;, and &quot;ānda&quot; &quot;in&quot; is written &quot;a-an-ta&quot; rather than &quot;an-ta&quot;.

===Hieroglyphic Luwian===

Hieroglyphic Luwian (&quot;luwili&quot;) is the corpus of Luwian texts written in a native script, known as Anatolian hieroglyphs. It is recorded in official and royal seals and a small number of monumental inscriptions. Once thought to be a variety of the Hittite language, &quot;Hieroglyphic Hittite&quot; was formerly used to refer to the language of the same inscriptions, but this term is now obsolete. The dialect of Luwian hieroglyphic inscriptions appears to be either Empire Luwian or its descendant, Iron Age Luwian.

The earliest hieroglyphs appear on official and royal seals, dating from the early 2nd millennium BC, but only from the 14th century BC is the unequivocal evidence for a full-fledged writing system. Dutch Hittitologist Willemijn Waal has argued that Luwian Hieroglyphic was already used for writing on wooden writing boards from the early second millennium BC onwards, but the argument has not been widely accepted. The first monumental inscriptions confirmed as Luwian date to the Late Bronze Age, c. 14th to 13th centuries BC. After some two centuries of sparse material, the hieroglyphs resume in the Early Iron Age, c. 10th to 8th centuries BC. In the early 7th century BC, the Luwian hieroglyphic script, by then aged more than 700 years, falls into oblivion.

The first report of a monumental inscription dates to 1850, when an inhabitant of Nevşehir reported the relief at Fraktin. In 1870, antiquarian travellers in Aleppo found another inscription built into the south wall of the Al-Qaiqan Mosque. In 1884, Polish scholar discovered an inscription near Köylütolu, in western Turkey. The largest known inscription was excavated in 1970 in Yalburt, northwest of Konya. Luwian hieroglyphic texts contain a limited number of lexical borrowings from Hittite, Akkadian, and Northwest Semitic; the lexical borrowings from Greek are limited to proper nouns, although common nouns borrowed in the opposite direction do exist.

A decipherment was presented by Emmanuel Laroche in 1960, building on partial decipherments proposed since the 1930s. Corrections to the readings of certain signs as well as other clarifications were given by David Hawkins, Anna Morpurgo Davies and Günther Neumann in 1973, generally referred to as &quot;the new readings&quot;.

====Script====

A more elaborate monumental style is distinguished from more abstract linear or cursive forms of the script. In general, relief inscriptions prefer monumental forms, and incised ones prefer the linear form, but the styles are in principle interchangeable. Texts of several lines are usually written in boustrophedon style. Within a line, signs are usually written in vertical columns, but as in Egyptian hieroglyphs, aesthetic considerations take precedence over correct reading order.

The script consists of the order of 500 unique signs, some with multiple values; a given sign may function as a logogram, a determinative or a syllabogram, or a combination thereof. The signs are numbered according to Laroche&#x27;s sign list, with a prefix of &#x27;L.&#x27; or &#x27;*&#x27;. Logograms are transcribed in Latin in capital letters. For example, *90, an image of a foot, is transcribed as PES when used logographically, and with its phonemic value &quot;ti&quot; when used as a syllabogram. In the rare cases where the logogram cannot be transliterated into Latin, it is rendered through its approximate Hittite equivalent, recorded in Italic capitals, e.g. *216 &quot;ARHA&quot;. The most up-to-date sign list is that of Marazzi (1998).

Hawkins, Morpurgo-Davies and Neumann corrected some previous errors about sign values, in particular emending the reading of symbols *376 and *377 from &quot;i, ī&quot; to &quot;zi, za&quot;.

Some signs are used as reading aid, marking the beginning of a word, the end of a word, or identifying a sign as a logogram. These are not mandatory and are used inconsistently.

== Phonology ==
The reconstruction of the Luwian phoneme inventory is based mainly on the written texts and comparisons with the known development of other Indo-European languages. Two series of stops can be identified, one transliterated as geminate in the cuneiform script. These fortis and lenis stops may have been distinguished by either voicing or gemination. The contrast was lost initially and finally, suggesting that any voicing only appeared intervocalically.

The following table provides a minimal consonant inventory, as can be reconstructed from the script. The existence of other consonants, which were not differentiated in writing, is possible.

There are only three vowels, &quot;a&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, and &quot;u&quot;, which could be short or long. Vowel length is not stable but changes with the stress and word position. For example, &quot;annan&quot; occurs alone as an adverb as &quot;ānnan&quot; (&#x27;underneath&#x27;) but as a preposition, it becomes &quot;annān pātanza&quot; (&#x27;under the feet&#x27;).

The characters that are transliterated as &quot;-h-&quot; and &quot;-hh-&quot; have often been interpreted as pharyngeal fricatives and . However, they may have instead been uvular and or velar fricatives and . In loans to Ugaritic, these sounds are transcribed with &lt;ḫ&gt; and &lt;ġ&gt;, while in Egyptian they are transcribed with &quot;ḫ&quot; and &quot;g.&quot; As both of these languages had pharyngeal consonants, the Luwian sounds are unlikely to have been pharyngeal.

In transcriptions of Luwian cuneiform, &quot;š&quot; is traditionally distinguished from &quot;s&quot;, since they were originally distinct signs for two different sounds, but in Luwian, both signs probably represented the same &quot;s&quot; sound.

A noteworthy phonological development in Luwian is rhotacism; in some cases, &quot;d&quot;, &quot;l&quot;, and &quot;n&quot; become &quot;r&quot;. For example, *&quot;īdi&quot; (&#x27;he gets&#x27;) becomes &quot;īri&quot; and &quot;wala-&quot; (&#x27;die&#x27;) becomes &quot;wara-&quot;. Additionally, a &quot;d&quot; in word final position can be dropped, and an &quot;s&quot; may be added between two dental consonants and so &quot;*ad-tuwari&quot; becomes &quot;aztuwari&quot; (&#x27;you all eat&#x27;) (&quot;ds&quot; and &quot;z&quot; are phonetically identical).

== Morphology ==
=== Nouns ===
There were two grammatical genders: animate and inanimate/neuter. There are two grammatical numbers: singular and plural. Some animate nouns could also take a collective plural in addition to the regular numerical plural.

Luwian had six cases:
# nominative
# genitive
# dative/locative
# accusative
# ablative/instrumental
# vocative

The vocative case occurs rarely in surviving texts and only in the singular.

In the animate gender, an &quot;-i-&quot; is inserted between the stem and the case ending. In hieroglyphic Luwian, the particle &quot;-sa/-za&quot; is added to the nominative/accusative inanimate case ending. In the genitive case, cuneiform and hieroglyphic Luwian differ sharply from each other. In cuneiform Luwian the possessive suffix &quot;-assa&quot; is used for the genitive singular and &quot;-assanz-&quot; is used for the genitive plural. In hieroglyphic Luwian, as in Hittite, the classical Indo-European suffixes &quot;-as&quot; for the genitive singular and &quot;-an&quot; for the plural are used. The special form of possessive adjectives with a plural possessor is restricted to Kizzuwatna Luwian and probably represents a calque from Hurrian.

Because of the prevalence of &quot;-assa&quot; place names and words scattered around all sides of the Aegean Sea, the possessive suffix was sometimes considered evidence of a shared non-Indo-European language or an Aegean Sprachbund preceding the arrivals of Luwians and Greeks. It is, however, possible to account for the Luwian possessive construction as a result of case attraction in the Indo-European noun phrase.

=== Adjective ===
Adjectives agree with nouns in number and gender. Forms for the nominative and the accusative differ only in the animate gender and even then, only in the singular. For the sake of clarity, the table includes only the endings beginning with &quot;-a&quot;, but endings can also begin with an &quot;-i&quot;. The forms are largely derived from the forms of the nominal declension, with an &quot;-as-&quot; before the case ending that would be expected for nouns.

=== Pronouns ===
In addition to personal pronouns typical of Anatolian languages, Luwian also has demonstrative pronouns, the which are formed from &quot;apa-&quot; and &quot;za-/zi-&quot;. The case endings are similar those of Hittite, but not all cases are attested for personal pronouns. In the third person, the demonstrative pronoun &quot;apa-&quot; occurs instead of the personal pronoun.

Possessive pronouns and demonstrative pronouns in &quot;apa-&quot; are declined as adjectives. All known forms of the personal pronouns are given, but it is not clear how their meanings differed or how they changed for different cases.

In addition to the forms given in the table, Luwian also had a demonstrative pronoun formed from the stem &quot;za-/zi-&quot;, but not all cases are known, and also a relative pronoun, which was declined regularly: &quot;kwis&quot; (nominative singular animate), &quot;kwin&quot; (accusative singular animate), &quot;kwinzi&quot; (nominative/accusative plural animate), &quot;kwati&quot; (ablative/instrumental singular), &quot;kwanza&quot; (dative/locative plural), &quot;kwaya&quot; (nominative/accusative plural inanimate). Some indefinite pronouns whose meanings are not entirely clear are also transmitted.

=== Verbs ===
Like many other Indo-European languages, Luwian distinguishes two numbers (singular and plural) and three persons. There are two moods: indicative and imperative but no subjunctive. There are two tenses: the present, which is used to express future events as well, and the preterite.

The following active voice endings have been attested:

The conjugation is very similar to the Hittite &quot;ḫḫi&quot; conjugation.

For the mediopassive, the following endings are attested:

A single participle can be formed with the suffix &quot;-a(i)mma&quot;. It has a passive sense for transitive verbs and a stative sense for intransitive verbs. The infinitive ends in &quot;-una&quot;.

== Syntax ==
The usual word order is subject-object-verb, but words can be moved to the front of the sentence for stress or to start a clause. Relative clauses are normally before the antecedent, but they sometimes follow the antecedent. Dependent words and adjectives are normally before their head word. Enclitic particles are often attached to the first word or conjunction.

Various conjunctions with temporal or conditional meaning are used to link clauses. There is no coordinating conjunction, but main clauses can be coordinated with the enclitic &quot;-ha&quot;, which is attached to the first word of the following clause. In narratives, clauses are linked by using the prosecutive conjunctions: &quot;a-&quot; before the first word of the following clause means &#x27;and then&#x27;, and &quot;pā&quot;, can be an independent conjunction at the start of a clause and the enclitic &quot;-pa&quot; indicates contrast or a change of theme.

The following example sentence demonstrates several common features of Luwian: a final verb, the particle chain headed by the conjunction &quot;a-&quot;, the quotative clitic &quot;-wa&quot;, and the preverb &quot;sarra&quot; adding directionality to the main verb &quot;awiha&quot;.


== Vocabulary and texts ==
The known Luwian vocabulary consists mostly of words inherited from Proto-Indo-European. Loan words for various technical and religious concepts derive mainly from Hurrian, and were often subsequently passed on through Luwian to Hittite.

The surviving corpus of Luwian texts consists principally of cuneiform ritual texts from the 16th and 15th centuries BC and monumental inscriptions in hieroglyphs. There are also some letters and economic documents. The majority of the hieroglyphic inscriptions derive from the 12th to 7th centuries BC, after the fall of the Hittite empire.

Another source of Luwian are the hieroglyphic seals which date from the 16th to the 7th centuries BC. Seals from the time of the Hittite empire are often digraphic, written in both cuneiform and hieroglyphics. However, the seals nearly always are limited to logograms. The absence of the syllabic symbols from the seals makes it impossible to determine the pronunciation of names and titles that appear on them, or even to make a certain attribution of the text to a specific language.

==History of research==
After the decipherment of Hittite, Cuneiform Luwian was recognised as a separate, but related language by Emil Forrer in 1919. Further progress in the understanding of the language came after the Second World War, with the publication and analysis of a larger number of texts. Important work in this period was produced by Bernhard Rosenkranz, Heinrich Otten and Emmanuel Laroche. An important advance came in 1985 with the reorganisation of the whole text-corpus by Frank Starke.

The decipherment and classification of Hieroglyphic Luwian was much more difficult. In the 1920s, there were a number of failed attempts. In the 1930s some individual logograms and syllabic signs were correctly identified. At this point the classification of the language was not yet clear and, since it was believed to be a form of Hittite, it was referred to as &quot;Hieroglyphic Hittite&quot;. After a break in research due to the Second World War, there was breakthrough in 1947 with the discovery and publication of a Phoenician-Hieroglyphic Luwian bilingual text by Helmuth Theodor Bossert. The reading of several syllabic signs was still faulty, however, and as a result it was not realised that the cuneiform and hieroglyphic texts recorded the same language.

In the 1970s, as a result of a fundamental revision of the readings of a large number of hieroglyphs by John David Hawkins, Anna Morpurgo Davies, and Günter Neumann, it became clear that both cuneiform and hieroglyphic texts recorded the same Luwian language. This revision resulted from a discovery outside the area of Luwian settlement, namely the annotations on Urartian pots, written in the Urartian language using the hieroglyphic Luwian script. The sign , which had hitherto been read as &quot;ī&quot; was shown to be being used to indicate the sound &quot;za&quot;, which triggered a chain reaction resulting in an entirely new system of readings. Since that time, research has concentrated on better understanding the relationship between the two different forms of Luwian, in order to gain a clearer understanding of Luwian as a whole.

==Trojan hypothesis==
Luwian has been deduced as one of the likely candidates for the language spoken by the Trojans.

After the 1995 finding of a Luwian biconvex seal at Troy VII, there has been a heated discussion over the language that was spoken in Homeric Troy. Frank Starke of the University of Tübingen demonstrated that the name of Priam, king of Troy at the time of the Trojan War, is connected to the Luwian compound &quot;Priimuua&quot;, which means &quot;exceptionally courageous&quot;. &quot;The certainty is growing that Wilusa/Troy belonged to the greater Luwian-speaking community,&quot; but it is not entirely clear whether Luwian was primarily the official language or it was in daily colloquial use.

<text>The Fellowship of Reconciliation (FoR or FOR) is the name used by a number of religious nonviolent organizations, particularly in English-speaking countries. They are linked by affiliation to the International Fellowship of Reconciliation (IFOR).

In the United Kingdom, the acronym &quot;FoR&quot; is normally typeset with a lower-case &quot;o&quot;; elsewhere, it is usually typeset in all capital letters, as &quot;FOR&quot;, such as in &quot;IFOR&quot;.

==The FoR in the United Kingdom==
The first body to use the name &quot;Fellowship of Reconciliation&quot; was formed as a result of a pact made in August 1914 at the outbreak of the First World War by two Christians, Henry Hodgkin (an English Quaker) and Friedrich Siegmund-Schultze (a German Lutheran), who were participating in a Christian pacifist conference in Konstanz in southern Germany. On the platform of the railway station at Cologne, they pledged to each other that, &quot;We are one in Christ and can never be at war.&quot;

There were a number of people involved in the creation of the organisation, among them Lilian Stevenson, Pierre Cérésole, and its first secretary, Richard Roberts. 
Stevenson later wrote up the first history of the organisation.

To take that pledge forward, Hodgkin organised in 1915 a conference in Cambridge at which over a hundred Christians of all denominations agreed to found the FoR. They set out the principles that had led them to do so in a statement which became known as &quot;The Basis&quot;. It states:
*That love as revealed and interpreted in the life and death of Jesus Christ, involves more than we have yet seen, that is the only power by which evil can be overcome and the only sufficient basis of human society.
*That, in order to establish a world-order based on Love, it is incumbent upon those who believe in this principle to accept it fully, both for themselves and in relation to others and to take the risks involved in doing so in a world which does not yet accept it.
*That therefore, as Christians, we are forbidden to wage war, and that our loyalty to our country, to humanity, to the Church Universal, and to Jesus Christ our Lord and Master, calls us instead to a life-service for the enthronement of Love in personal, commercial and national life.
*That the Power, Wisdom and Love of God stretch far beyond the limits of our present experience, and that He is ever waiting to break forth into human life in new and larger ways.
*That since God manifests Himself in the world through men and women, we offer ourselves to His redemptive purpose to be used by Him in whatever way He may reveal to us.

Because the membership of the FoR included many members of the Society of Friends (Quakers), who reject any form of written creed, it has always been stressed that the Basis is a statement of general agreement rather than a fixed form of words. Nonetheless the Basis has been an important point of reference for many Christian pacifists.

The FoR had a prominent role in acting as a support network for Christian pacifists during the war and supporting them in the difficult choice to become conscientious objectors - and in taking its consequences, which in many cases included imprisonment. In the interwar years it grew to be an influential body in United Kingdom Christianity, with federated associations in all the main denominations (the Anglican Pacifist Fellowship, the Methodist Peace Fellowship, the Baptist Peace Fellowship, etc.) as well as a strong membership among the Society of Friends (Quakers). At one time the Methodist Peace Fellowship claimed a quarter of all Methodist ministers among its members.

During the 1930s, the FoR&#x27;s members included George Lansbury.

The FoR was active in the anti-war movement of the 1930s, and provided considerable practical support for active pacifism during and after the Spanish Civil War. It could be argued that it lost influence when the Second World War came, was won, and was widely perceived as morally justified, especially as the horrors of Nazism became known in the post-war period. Equally, it could be argued that the questionable morality of the Cold War threat of mutually assured nuclear destruction again vindicated the FoR philosophy. The FoR retained considerable strength in post-second world war British Christianity, and many of its members were active in the Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament in the 1950s and 1960s. Prominent members included Donald Soper, a high-profile President of the Methodist Conference of the period and later a member of the House of Lords. With the continuing decline of Christianity in Britain, the FoR has lost influence, although active Christians in the UK are now probably further to the left politically, on average, than they were in the 1930s or 1950s.

A history of British FoR from 1914 to 1989, entitled Valiant For Peace, was published in 1991.

FoR remains active: Norman Kember, the British peace activist kidnapped in Iraq in December 2005 was a member of the Baptist Peace Fellowship and a Trustee of the FoR in England. There are Roman Catholic members of FoR, and although most Catholic pacifists affiliate instead to the specifically Catholic peace organisation, Pax Christi, FoR and Pax Christi work closely together. Although many members have universalist sympathies and are happy to co-operate with pacifists of other faiths or none, the FoR has remained a distinctively Christian organisation. However, with a number of Hindu, Buddhist and other supporters, members, and staff, there is a degree of flux here as well.

Currently, there are separate FoR organisations for England and Scotland, and for Wales. The Welsh branch is called .

==The FOR in the United States==

United States Fellowship of Reconciliation (FOR USA) was founded in 1915 by sixty-eight pacifists, including A. J. Muste, Jane Addams and Bishop Paul Jones. Norman Thomas, at first skeptical of its program, joined in 1916 and would become the group&#x27;s president. It was formed in opposition to the entry of the United States into World War I. The American Civil Liberties Union developed out of FOR&#x27;s conscientious objectors program and the Emergency Committee for Civil Liberties.

The FOR USA claims to be the &quot;largest, oldest interfaith peace and justice organization in the United States.&quot; Its programs and projects involve domestic as well as international issues, and generally emphasize nonviolent alternatives to conflict and the rights of conscience. Unlike the U.K. movements, it is an interfaith body, though its historic roots are in Christianity.

==The FoR in Canada==

Among the first chapters in Canada were those established in Toronto by Richard Roberts in the late 1920s and in Montreal by J. Lavell Smith in the mid-1930s.

==Fellowship Europe==
The Fellowship also has a European branch. In the post-World War Two period, the secretary of the European
FOR was Pastor André Trocmé, known for saving Jews at Collège Cévenol during the 
Nazi occupation of France.

==Religious Peace Fellowships==
Since 1935, FOR has helped form, launch, and strengthen peace fellowships of many faith
traditions to form a network of faith-based nonviolent action. Membership of these peace fellowships has changed and grown over the past decades; what follows are fellowships that are currently affiliated with FOR:

*Adventist Peace Fellowship 
*Baptist Peace Fellowship
*Buddhist Peace Fellowship 
*Catholic Peace Fellowship 
*Church of God Peace Fellowship 
*Disciples Peace Fellowship 
*Episcopal Peace Fellowship 
*Jewish Peace Fellowship 
*Lutheran Peace Fellowship
* Muslim Peace Fellowship
*Presbyterian Peace Fellowship 
*Unitarian Universalist Peace Fellowship

<text>The Gutenberg Museum is one of the oldest museums of printing in the world, located opposite the cathedral in the old part of Mainz, Germany. It is named after Johannes Gutenberg, the inventor of printing from movable metal type in Western Europe. The collections include printing equipment and examples of printed materials from many cultures.

==History==
A group of people founded the museum in 1900, 500 years after Johannes Gutenberg’s birth, to honor the inventor and present his technical and artistic achievements to the public at large. They also aimed to exhibit the writing and printing of as many different cultures as possible.

Publishers, manufacturers of printing machines and printing houses donated books, apparatus and machines, which formed the basis of the collection. In its first few years the museum was part of the city library, meaning that the most beautiful and characteristic volumes from the library’s extensive collection could be requisitioned for the museum. Visitors were thus presented with a survey of almost 500 years of the printed book. In time the museum expanded to include sections on printing techniques, book art, job printing and ex-libris, graphics and posters, paper, the history of writing of all cultures of the world and modern artists’ books.

The Gutenberg Museum was originally laid out in two rooms at the Kurfürstliches Schloß (Electoral Palace Mainz), which also accommodated the city library. The museum moved into the new library building on the Rheinallee in 1912. The same year, 1925, saw the installation of a reconstruction of Gutenberg&#x27;s workshop which soon became one of the museum&#x27;s main attractions. Type founding, typesetting and printing could now be demonstrated visually. The replica of Gutenberg&#x27;s printing press, rebuilt according to the 15th- and 16th-century woodcuts, proved an object of great interest to visitors and was henceforth shown at a large number of exhibitions all over the world.

In 1927 the museum was able to move into the building &quot;Zum Römischen Kaiser&quot; (1664) in Mainz. This is now where the museum&#x27;s administration, the restoration workshop, library, Gutenberg Society and the domicile of the Mainzer Stadtschreiber are housed. The Late Renaissance building was heavily bombed in 1945; the museum&#x27;s contents had been stored in a safe place and thus remained intact. In 1962, the restoration of the Römischer Kaiser was complete. A new, modern exhibition building was also opened in the place where once the guest house &quot;König von England&quot; stood.

==Acquisitions==
The museum made several important acquisitions in the following years, among them a second Gutenberg Bible, the Shuckburgh Bible in two volumes (1978), and two block books printed using wooden formes and today extremely rare. Another major change was the introduction of the museum&#x27;s educational unit in 1989. In 2000, the old museum building was restored and extended.

==Exhibitions==
The Bookplate Collection

The Gutenberg Museum&#x27;s collection of bookplates, or ex-libri, is the most comprehensive public collection in the Federal Republic of Germany and one of the most important worldwide. The collection began in the mid-twentieth century with donation of a few dozen bookplates and grew greatly in 1963 when Willy Tropp, one of the most important bookplate collectors of the time, donated approximately 50,000 bookplates. The collection contains bookplates that belonged to such famous and infamous figures as Charles Lindbergh, Albert Einstein, Charles Dickens, Franklin D. Roosevelt and Adolf Hitler. Today the collection numbers at around 100,000 bookplates. 

Printed Graphics

The Gutenberg-Museum has an extensive collection of printed graphics which include depictions of printers and technical illustrations and artists’ prints representing various techniques. Exhibited at various points throughout the museum&#x27;s permanent displays, the collection also consists of thousands of stored prints that can be viewed through appointment upon request to the museum.

Small Presses

The Mainzer Minipressen-Archiv is an archive of literary works by small printing shops rarely admitted to mainstream libraries. Included in the collections are books, magazines, videos, posters, flyers and leaflets from small presses throughout Europe.

<doc id="255046" wikidata="Q1128871" url="?curid=255046" title="March on Washington">
<text>The March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom (commonly known as the March on Washington or the Great March on Washington) was held in Washington, D.C., on August 28, 1963. The purpose of the march was to advocate for the civil and economic rights of African Americans. At the march, Bob Dylan performed four songs, alongside Joan Baez, and many people gave speeches. The most notable speech came from the final speaker, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., standing in front of the Lincoln Memorial, as he delivered his historic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech in which he called for an end to legalized racism and racial segregation.

The march was organized by Bayard Rustin and A. Philip Randolph, who built an alliance of civil rights, labor, and religious organizations that came together under the banner of &quot;jobs and freedom.&quot; Estimates of the number of participants varied from 200,000 to 300,000, but the most widely cited estimate is 250,000 people. Observers estimated that 75–80% of the marchers were black. The march was one of the largest political rallies for human rights in United States history. Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, was the most integral and highest-ranking white organizer of the march.

The march is credited with helping to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1964. It preceded the Selma Voting Rights Movement, when national media coverage contributed to passage of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 that same year.

==Background==

African Americans were legally freed from slavery under the Thirteenth Amendment and granted citizenship in the Fourteenth Amendment, and African American men were elevated to the status of citizens and granted full voting rights by the Fifteenth Amendment in the years soon after the end of the American Civil War, but Democrats regained power after the end of the Reconstruction era (in 1877) and imposed many restrictions on people of color in the South. At the turn of the century, Southern states passed constitutions and laws that disenfranchised most black people and many poor whites, excluding them from the political system. The whites imposed social, economic, and political repression against black people into the 1960s, under a system of legal discrimination known as Jim Crow laws, which were pervasive in the American South. Black people suffered discrimination from private businesses as well, and most were prevented from voting, sometimes through violent means. Twenty-one states prohibited interracial marriage.

During the 20th century, civil rights organizers began to develop ideas for a march on Washington, DC, to seek justice. Earlier efforts to organize such a demonstration included the March on Washington Movement of the 1940s. A. Philip Randolph—the president of the Brotherhood of Sleeping Car Porters, president of the Negro American Labor Council, and vice president of the AFL–CIO—was a key instigator in 1941. With Bayard Rustin, Randolph called for 100,000 black workers to march on Washington, in protest of discriminatory hiring during World War II by U.S. military contractors and demanding an Executive Order to correct that. Faced with a mass march scheduled for July 1, 1941, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued Executive Order 8802 on June 25. The order established the Committee on Fair Employment Practice and banned discriminatory hiring in the defense industry, leading to improvements for many defense workers. Randolph called off the March.

Randolph and Rustin continued to organize around the idea of a mass march on Washington. They envisioned several large marches during the 1940s, but all were called off (despite criticism from Rustin). Their Prayer Pilgrimage for Freedom, held at the Lincoln Memorial on May 17, 1957, featured key leaders including Adam Clayton Powell, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., and Roy Wilkins. Mahalia Jackson performed.

The 1963 march was part of the rapidly expanding Civil Rights Movement, which involved demonstrations and nonviolent direct action across the United States. 1963 marked the 100th anniversary of the signing of the Emancipation Proclamation by President Abraham Lincoln. Leaders represented major civil rights organizations. Members of The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP) and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference put aside their differences and came together for the march. Many whites and black people also came together in the urgency for change in the nation.

That year violent confrontations broke out in the South: in Cambridge, Maryland; Pine Bluff, Arkansas; Goldsboro, North Carolina; Somerville, Tennessee; Saint Augustine, Florida; and across Mississippi. In most cases, white people attacked nonviolent demonstrators seeking civil rights. Many people wanted to march on Washington, but disagreed over how the march should be conducted. Some called for a complete shutdown of the city through civil disobedience. Others argued that the civil rights movement should remain nationwide in scope, rather than focus its energies on the nation&#x27;s capital and federal government. There was a widespread perception that the Kennedy administration had not lived up to its promises in the 1960 election, and King described Kennedy&#x27;s race policy as &quot;tokenism&quot;.

On May 24, 1963, Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy invited African-American novelist James Baldwin, along with a large group of cultural leaders, to a meeting in New York to discuss race relations. However, the meeting became antagonistic, as black delegates felt that Kennedy did not have an adequate understanding of the race problem in the nation. The public failure of the meeting, which came to be known as the Baldwin–Kennedy meeting, underscored the divide between the needs of Black America and the understanding of Washington politicians. But the meeting also provoked the Kennedy administration to take action on the civil rights of African Americans. On June 11, 1963, President Kennedy gave a notable civil rights address on national television and radio, announcing that he would begin to push for civil rights legislation. That night (early morning of June 12, 1963), Mississippi activist Medgar Evers was murdered in his own driveway, further escalating national tension around the issue of racial inequality. After Kennedy&#x27;s assassination, his proposal was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson as the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

== Planning and organization ==
A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin began planning the march in December 1961. They envisioned two days of protest, including sit-ins and lobbying followed by a mass rally at the Lincoln Memorial. They wanted to focus on joblessness and to call for a public works program that would employ black people. In early 1963 they called publicly for &quot;a massive March on Washington for jobs&quot;. They received help from Stanley Aronowitz of the Amalgamated Clothing Workers; he gathered support from radical organizers who could be trusted not to report their plans to the Kennedy administration. The unionists offered tentative support for a march that would be focused on jobs.

On May 15, 1963, without securing the cooperation of the NAACP or the Urban League, Randolph announced an &quot;October Emancipation March on Washington for Jobs&quot;. He reached out to union leaders, winning the support of the UAW&#x27;s Walter Reuther, but not of AFL–CIO president George Meany. Randolph and Rustin intended to focus the March on economic inequality, stating in their original plan that &quot;integration in the fields of education, housing, transportation and public accommodations will be of limited extent and duration so long as fundamental economic inequality along racial lines persists.&quot; As they negotiated with other leaders, they expanded their stated objectives to &quot;Jobs and Freedom&quot;, to acknowledge the agenda of groups that focused more on civil rights.

In June 1963, leaders from several different organizations formed the Council for United Civil Rights Leadership, an umbrella group to coordinate funds and messaging. This coalition of leaders, who became known as the &quot;Big Six&quot;, included: Randolph, chosen as titular head of the march; James Farmer, president of the Congress of Racial Equality; John Lewis, chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee; Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., president of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference; Roy Wilkins, president of the NAACP; and Whitney Young, president of the National Urban League. King in particular had become well known for his role in the Birmingham campaign and for his Letter from Birmingham Jail. Wilkins and Young initially objected to Rustin as a leader for the march, worried that he would attract the wrong attention because he was a homosexual, a former Communist, and a draft resister. They eventually accepted Rustin as deputy organizer, on the condition that Randolph act as lead organizer and manage any political fallout.

About two months before the march, the Big Six broadened their organizing coalition by bringing on board four white men who supported their efforts: Walter Reuther, president of the United Automobile Workers; Eugene Carson Blake, former president of the National Council of Churches; Mathew Ahmann, executive director of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice; and Joachim Prinz, president of the American Jewish Congress. Together, the Big Six plus four became known as the &quot;Big Ten.&quot; John Lewis later recalled, &quot;Somehow, some way, we worked well together. The six of us, plus the four. We became like brothers.&quot;

On June 22, the organizers met with President Kennedy, who warned against creating &quot;an atmosphere of intimidation&quot; by bringing a large crowd to Washington. The civil rights activists insisted on holding the march. Wilkins pushed for the organizers to rule out civil disobedience and described this proposal as the &quot;perfect compromise&quot;. King and Young agreed. Leaders from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) and Congress of Racial Equality (CORE), who wanted to conduct direct actions against the Department of Justice, endorsed the protest before they were informed that civil disobedience would not be allowed. Finalized plans for the March were announced in a press conference on July 2. President Kennedy spoke favorably of the March on July 17, saying that organizers planned a peaceful assembly and had cooperated with the Washington, D.C., police.
Mobilization and logistics were administered by Rustin, a civil rights veteran and organizer of the 1947 Journey of Reconciliation, the first of the Freedom Rides to test the Supreme Court ruling that banned racial discrimination in interstate travel. Rustin was a long-time associate of both Randolph and Dr. King. With Randolph concentrating on building the march&#x27;s political coalition, Rustin built and led the team of two hundred activists and organizers who publicized the march and recruited the marchers, coordinated the buses and trains, provided the marshals, and set up and administered all of the logistic details of a mass march in the nation&#x27;s capital. During the days leading up to the march, these 200 volunteers used the ballroom of Washington DC radio station WUST as their operations headquarters.

The march was not universally supported among civil rights activists. Some, including Rustin (who assembled 4,000 volunteer marshals from New York), were concerned that it might turn violent, which could undermine pending legislation and damage the international image of the movement. The march was condemned by Malcolm X, spokesperson for the Nation of Islam, who termed it the &quot;farce on Washington&quot;.

March organizers disagreed about the purpose of the march. The NAACP and Urban League saw it as a gesture of support for the civil rights bill that had been introduced by the Kennedy Administration. Randolph, King, and the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) believed it could raise both civil rights and economic issues to national attention beyond the Kennedy bill. CORE and SNCC believed the march could challenge and condemn the Kennedy administration&#x27;s inaction and lack of support for civil rights for African Americans.

Despite their disagreements, the group came together on a set of goals:

*Passage of meaningful civil rights legislation;
*Immediate elimination of school segregation (the Supreme Court had ruled that segregation of public schools was unconstitutional in 1954, in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot;);
*A program of public works, including job training, for the unemployed;
*A Federal law prohibiting discrimination in public or private hiring;
*A $2-an-hour minimum wage nationwide ();
*Withholding Federal funds from programs that tolerate discrimination;
*Enforcement of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution by reducing congressional representation from States that disenfranchise citizens;
*A Fair Labor Standards Act broadened to include employment areas then excluded;
*Authority for the Attorney General to institute injunctive suits when constitutional rights of citizens are violated.

Although in years past, Randolph had supported &quot;Negro only&quot; marches, partly to reduce the impression that the civil rights movement was dominated by white communists, organizers in 1963 agreed that white and black people marching side by side would create a more powerful image.

The Kennedy Administration cooperated with the organizers in planning the March, and one member of the Justice Department was assigned as a full-time liaison. Chicago and New York City (as well as some corporations) agreed to designate August 28 as &quot;Freedom Day&quot; and give workers the day off.

To avoid being perceived as radical, organizers rejected support from Communist groups. However, some politicians claimed that the March was Communist-inspired, and the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) produced numerous reports suggesting the same. In the days before August 28, the FBI called celebrity backers to inform them of the organizers&#x27; communist connections and advising them to withdraw their support. When William C. Sullivan produced a lengthy report on August 23 suggesting that Communists had failed to appreciably infiltrate the civil rights movement, FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover rejected its contents. Strom Thurmond launched a prominent public attack on the March as Communist, and singled out Rustin in particular as a Communist and a gay man.

Organizers worked out of a building at West 130th St. and Lenox in Harlem. They promoted the march by selling buttons, featuring two hands shaking, the words &quot;March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom&quot;, a union bug, and the date August 28, 1963. By August 2, they had distributed 42,000 of the buttons. Their goal was a crowd of at least 100,000 people.

As the march was being planned, activists across the country received bomb threats at their homes and in their offices. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; received a message saying its headquarters would be bombed unless it printed a message calling the president a &quot;Nigger Lover&quot;. Five airplanes were grounded on the morning of August 28 due to bomb threats. A man in Kansas City telephoned the FBI to say he would put a hole between King&#x27;s eyes; the FBI did not respond. Roy Wilkins was threatened with assassination if he did not leave the country.

==Convergence==
Thousands traveled by road, rail, and air to Washington, D.C., on Wednesday, August 28. Marchers from Boston traveled overnight and arrived in Washington at 7am after an eight-hour trip, but others took much longer bus rides from cities such as Milwaukee, Little Rock, and St. Louis. Organizers persuaded New York&#x27;s MTA to run extra subway trains after midnight on August 28, and the New York City bus terminal was busy throughout the night with peak crowds. A total of 450 buses left New York City from Harlem. Maryland police reported that &quot;by 8:00 a.m., 100 buses an hour were streaming through the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel.&quot; The United Automobile Workers financed bus transportation for 5,000 of its rank-and-file members, providing the largest single contingent from any organization.

One reporter, Fred Powledge, accompanied African Americans who boarded six buses in Birmingham, Alabama, for the 750-mile trip to Washington. &quot;The New York Times&quot; carried his report:
The 260 demonstrators, of all ages, carried picnic baskets, water jugs, Bibles and a major weapon—their willingness to march, sing and pray in protest against discrimination. They gathered early this morning [August 27] in Birmingham&#x27;s Kelly Ingram Park, where state troopers once [four months previous in May] used fire hoses and dogs to put down their demonstrations. It was peaceful in the Birmingham park as the marchers waited for the buses. The police, now part of a moderate city power structure, directed traffic around the square and did not interfere with the gathering ... An old man commented on the 20-hour ride, which was bound to be less than comfortable: &quot;You forget we Negroes have been riding buses all our lives. We don&#x27;t have the money to fly in airplanes.&quot;

John Marshall Kilimanjaro, a demonstrator traveling from Greensboro, North Carolina, said:
Contrary to the mythology, the early moments of the March—getting there—was no picnic. People were afraid. We didn&#x27;t know what we would meet. There was no precedent. Sitting across from me was a black preacher with a white collar. He was an AME preacher. We talked. Every now and then, people on the bus sang &#x27;Oh Freedom&#x27; and &#x27;We Shall Overcome,&#x27; but for the most part there wasn&#x27;t a whole bunch of singing. We were secretly praying that nothing violent happened.

Other bus rides featured racial tension, as black activists criticized liberal white participants as fair-weather friends.

Hazel Mangle Rivers, who had paid $8 for her ticket—&quot;one-tenth of her husband&#x27;s weekly salary&quot;—was quoted in the August 29 &quot;New York Times&quot;. Rivers said that she was impressed by Washington&#x27;s civility:
The people are lots better up here than they are down South. They treat you much nicer. Why, when I was out there at the march a white man stepped on my foot, and he said, &quot;Excuse me,&quot; and I said &quot;Certainly!&quot; That&#x27;s the first time that has ever happened to me. I believe that was the first time a white person has ever really been nice to me.

Some participants who arrived early held an all-night vigil outside the Department of Justice, claiming it had unfairly targeted civil rights activists and that it had been too lenient on white supremacists who attacked them.

=== Security preparations ===
The Washington, D.C., police forces were mobilized to full capacity for the march, including reserve officers and deputized firefighters. A total of 5,900 police officers were on duty. The government mustered 2,000 men from the National Guard, and brought in 3,000 outside soldiers to join the 1,000 already stationed in the area. These additional soldiers were flown in on helicopters from bases in Virginia and North Carolina. The Pentagon readied 19,000 troops in the suburbs. All of the forces involved were prepared to implement a coordinated conflict strategy named &quot;Operation Steep Hill&quot;.

For the first time since Prohibition, liquor sales were banned in Washington D.C. Hospitals stockpiled blood plasma and cancelled elective surgeries. Major League Baseball cancelled two games between the Minnesota Twins and the last place Washington Senators although the venue, D.C. Stadium, was nearly four miles from the Lincoln Memorial rally site.

Rustin and Walter Fauntroy negotiated some security issues with the government, gaining approval for private marshals with the understanding that these would not be able to act against outside agitators. The FBI and Justice Department refused to provide preventive guards for buses traveling through the South to reach D.C. William Johnson recruited more than 1,000 police officers to serve on this private force. Julius Hobson, an FBI informant who served on the March&#x27;s security force, told the team to be on the lookout for FBI infiltrators who might act as agents provocateurs. Jerry Bruno, President Kennedy&#x27;s advance man, was positioned to cut the power to the public address system in the event of any incendiary rally speech.

=== Venue and sound system ===
The organizers originally planned to hold the march outside the Capitol Building. However, Reuther persuaded them to move the march to the Lincoln Memorial. He believed the Lincoln Memorial would be less threatening to Congress and the occasion would be appropriate underneath the gaze of President Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s statue. The committee, notably Rustin, agreed to move the site on the condition that Reuther pay for a $19,000 (equivalent to $172,500 in 2021) sound system so that everyone on the National Mall could hear the speakers and musicians.

Rustin pushed hard for the expensive sound system, maintaining that &quot;We cannot maintain order where people cannot hear.&quot; The system was obtained and set up at the Lincoln Memorial, but was sabotaged on the day before the March. Its operators were unable to repair it. Fauntroy contacted Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy and his civil rights liaison Burke Marshall, demanding that the government fix the system. Fauntroy reportedly told them: &quot;We have a couple hundred thousand people coming. Do you want a fight here tomorrow after all we&#x27;ve done?&quot; The system was successfully rebuilt overnight by the U.S. Army Signal Corps.

==March==
The march commanded national attention by preempting regularly scheduled television programs. As the first ceremony of such magnitude ever initiated and dominated by African Americans, the march also was the first to have its nature wholly misperceived in advance. Dominant expectations ran from paternal apprehension to dread. On &quot;Meet the Press&quot;, reporters grilled Roy Wilkins and Martin Luther King Jr. about widespread foreboding that &quot;it would be impossible to bring more than 100,000 militant Negroes into Washington without incidents and possibly rioting.&quot; &quot;Life&quot; magazine declared that the capital was suffering &quot;its worst case of invasion jitters since the First Battle of Bull Run.&quot; The jails shifted inmates to other prisons to make room for those arrested in mass arrest. With nearly 1,700 extra correspondents supplementing the Washington press corps, the march drew a media assembly larger than the Kennedy inauguration two years earlier. Students from the University of California, Berkeley came together as black power organizations and emphasized the importance of the African-American freedom struggle. The march included black political parties; and William Worthy was one of many who led college students during the freedom struggle era.
On August 28, more than 2,000 buses, 21 chartered trains, 10 chartered airliners, and uncounted cars converged on Washington. All regularly scheduled planes, trains, and buses were also filled to capacity.

Although Randolph and Rustin had originally planned to fill the streets of Washington, D.C., the final route of the March covered only half of the National Mall. The march began at the Washington Monument and was scheduled to progress to the Lincoln Memorial. Demonstrators were met at the monument by the speakers and musicians. Women leaders were asked to march down Independence Avenue, while the male leaders marched on Pennsylvania Avenue with the media.

The start of the March was delayed because its leaders were meeting with members of Congress. To the leaders&#x27; surprise, the assembled group began to march from the Washington Monument to the Lincoln Memorial without them. The leaders met the March at Constitution Avenue, where they linked arms at the head of a crowd in order to be photographed &#x27;leading the march&#x27;.

Marchers were not supposed to create their own signs, though this rule was not completely enforced by marshals. Most of the demonstrators did carry pre-made signs, available in piles at the Washington Monument. The UAW provided thousands of signs that, among other things, read: &quot;There Is No Halfway House on the Road to Freedom,&quot; &quot;Equal Rights and Jobs NOW,&quot; &quot;UAW Supports Freedom March,&quot; &quot;in Freedom we are Born, in Freedom we must Live,&quot; and &quot;Before we&#x27;ll be a Slave, we&#x27;ll be Buried in our Grave.&quot;

About 50 members of the American Nazi Party staged a counter-protest and were quickly dispersed by police. The rest of Washington was quiet during the March. Most non-participating workers stayed home. Jailers allowed inmates to watch the March on TV.

== Speakers ==

Representatives from each of the sponsoring organizations addressed the crowd from the podium at the Lincoln Memorial. Speakers (dubbed &quot;The Big Ten&quot;) included The Big Six; three religious leaders (Catholic, Protestant, and Jewish); and labor leader Walter Reuther. None of the official speeches was by a woman. Dancer and actress Josephine Baker gave a speech during the preliminary offerings, but women were limited in the official program to a &quot;tribute&quot; led by Bayard Rustin, at which Daisy Bates also spoke briefly (see &quot;excluded speakers&quot; below.)

Floyd McKissick read James Farmer&#x27;s speech because Farmer had been arrested during a protest in Louisiana; Farmer wrote that the protests would not stop &quot;until the dogs stop biting us in the South and the rats stop biting us in the North.&quot;

The order of the speakers was as follows:
*1. A. Philip Randolph – March Director
*2. Daisy Bates – Little Rock, Arkansas
*3. Dr. Eugene Carson Blake – United Presbyterian Church and the National Council of Churches
*4. John Lewis – Chair, SNCC
*5. Walter Reuther – UAW, AFL–CIO
*6. Floyd McKissick – CORE
*7. Rabbi Uri Miller -- President of the Synagogue Council of America
*8. Whitney Young – National Urban League
*9. Mathew Ahmann - NCCIJ
*10. Roy Wilkins – NAACP
*11. Rabbi Joachim Prinz – American Jewish Congress
*12. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. – SCLC. His &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech has become celebrated for its vision and eloquence.
Closing remarks were made by A. Philip Randolph and Bayard Rustin, March Organizers, leading with The Pledge and a list of demands.

=== Official program ===

The actual order of events differed slightly from the official printed program. Noted singer Marian Anderson was scheduled to lead the national anthem but was unable to arrive on time; Camilla Williams performed in her place. Washington&#x27;s Roman Catholic Archbishop Patrick O&#x27;Boyle delivered the invocation.

The opening remarks were given by march director A. Philip Randolph, followed by a tribute to &quot;Negro Women Fighters for Freedom&quot;, in which Daisy Bates spoke briefly in place of Myrlie Evers, who had missed her flight. The tribute introduced Daisy Bates, Diane Nash, Prince E. Lee, Rosa Parks, and Gloria Richardson.

Following that, speakers were Presbyterian Church leader Eugene Carson Blake, SNCC chairman John Lewis, labor leader Walter Reuther, and CORE chairman Floyd McKissick (substituting for arrested CORE director James Farmer). The Eva Jessye Choir sang, and Rabbi Uri Miller (president of the Synagogue Council of America) offered a prayer. He was followed by National Urban League director Whitney Young, NCCIJ director Mathew Ahmann, and NAACP leader Roy Wilkins. After a performance by singer Mahalia Jackson, American Jewish Congress president Joachim Prinz spoke, followed by SCLC president Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Rustin read the March&#x27;s official demands for the crowd&#x27;s approval, and Randolph led the crowd in a pledge to continue working for the March&#x27;s goals. The program was closed with a benediction by Morehouse College president Benjamin Mays.

Although one of the officially stated purposes of the march was to support the civil rights bill introduced by the Kennedy Administration, several of the speakers criticized the proposed law as insufficient. Two government agents stood by in a position to cut power to the microphone if necessary.

=== Roy Wilkins ===
Roy Wilkins announced that sociologist and activist W. E. B. Du Bois had died in Ghana the previous night, where he had been living in exile; the crowd observed a moment of silence in his memory. Wilkins had initially refused to announce the news because he despised Du Bois for becoming a Communist—but insisted on making the announcement when he realized that Randolph would make it if he did not. Wilkins said: &quot;Regardless of the fact that in his later years Dr. Du Bois chose another path, it is incontrovertible that at the dawn of the twentieth century his was the voice that was calling you to gather here today in this cause. If you want to read something that applies to 1963 go back and get a volume of &quot;The Souls of Black Folk&quot; by Du Bois, published in 1903.&quot;

=== John Lewis ===
John Lewis of SNCC was the youngest speaker at the event. He planned to criticize the Kennedy Administration for the inadequacies of the Civil Rights Act of 1963. Other leaders insisted that the speech be changed to be less antagonistic to the government. James Forman and other SNCC activists contributed to the revision. It still complained that the Administration had not done enough to protect southern black people and civil rights workers from physical violence by whites in the Deep South. Deleted from his original speech at the insistence of more conservative and pro-Kennedy leaders were phrases such as:
Lewis&#x27; speech was distributed to fellow organizers the evening before the march; Reuther, O&#x27;Boyle, and others thought it was too divisive and militant. O&#x27;Boyle objected most strenuously to a part of the speech that called for immediate action and disavowed &quot;patience.&quot; The government and moderate organizers could not countenance Lewis&#x27;s explicit opposition to Kennedy&#x27;s civil rights bill. That night, O&#x27;Boyle and other members of the Catholic delegation began preparing a statement announcing their withdrawal from the March. Reuther convinced them to wait and called Rustin; Rustin informed Lewis at 2 A.M. on the day of the march that his speech was unacceptable to key coalition members. (Rustin also reportedly contacted Tom Kahn, who had edited the speech and inserted the line about Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea. Rustin asked, &quot;How could you do this? Do you know what Sherman &quot;did&quot;?) But Lewis did not want to change the speech. Other members of SNCC, including Stokely Carmichael, were also adamant that the speech not be censored. The dispute continued until minutes before the speeches were scheduled to begin. Under threat of public denouncement by the religious leaders, and under pressure from the rest of his coalition, Lewis agreed to omit the &#x27;inflammatory&#x27; passages. Many activists from SNCC, CORE, and SCLC were angry at what they considered censorship of Lewis&#x27;s speech. In the end, Lewis added a qualified endorsement of Kennedy&#x27;s civil rights legislation, saying: &quot;It is true that we support the administration&#x27;s Civil Rights Bill. We support it with great reservation, however.&quot; Even after toning down his speech, Lewis called for activists to &quot;get in and stay in the streets of every city, every village and hamlet of this nation until true freedom comes&quot;.

=== Martin Luther King Jr. ===

The speech given by SCLC president King, who spoke last, became known as the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, which was carried live by TV stations and subsequently considered the most impressive moment of the march. In it, King called for an end to legalized racism in the United States. It invoked the Declaration of Independence, the Emancipation Proclamation, and the United States Constitution. At the end of the speech, Mahalia Jackson shouted from the crowd, &quot;Tell them about the dream, Martin!&quot;, and King departed from his prepared text for a partly improvised peroration on the theme of &quot;I have a dream&quot;. Over time it has been hailed as a masterpiece of rhetoric, added to the National Recording Registry and memorialized by the National Park Service with an inscription on the spot where King stood to deliver the speech.

=== Randolph and Rustin ===
A. Philip Randolph spoke first, promising: &quot;we shall return again and again to Washington in ever growing numbers until total freedom is ours.&quot; Randolph also closed the event along with Bayard Rustin. Rustin followed King&#x27;s speech by slowly reading the list of demands. The two concluded by urging attendees to take various actions in support of the struggle.

=== Walter Reuther ===
Walter Reuther urged Americans to pressure their politicians to act to address racial injustices. He said,
American democracy is on trial in the eyes of the world ... We cannot successfully preach democracy in the world unless we first practice democracy at home. American democracy will lack the moral credentials and be both unequal to and unworthy of leading the forces of freedom against the forces of tyranny unless we take bold, affirmative, adequate steps to bridge the moral gap between American democracy&#x27;s noble promises and its ugly practices in the field of civil rights.

According to Irving Bluestone, who was standing near the platform while Reuther delivered his remarks, he overheard two black women talking. One asked, &quot;Who is that white man?&quot; The other replied, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know him? That&#x27;s the white Martin Luther King.&quot;

=== Excluded speakers ===
Author James Baldwin was prevented from speaking at the March because his comments would be too inflammatory. Baldwin later commented on the irony of the &quot;terrifying and profound&quot; requests that he prevent the March from happening:
In my view, by that time, there was, on the one hand, nothing to prevent—the March had already been co-opted—and, on the other, no way of stopping the people from descending on Washington. What struck me most horribly was that virtually no one in power (including some blacks or Negroes who were somewhere next door to power) was able, even remotely, to accept the depth, the dimension, the passion, and the faith of the people.
Despite the protests of organizer Anna Arnold Hedgeman, no women gave a speech at the March. Male organizers attributed this omission to the &quot;difficulty of finding a single woman to speak without causing serious problems vis-à-vis other women and women&#x27;s groups&quot;. Hedgeman read a statement at an August 16 meeting, charging:
In light of the role of Negro women in the struggle for freedom and especially in light of the extra burden they have carried because of the castration of our Negro men in this culture, it is incredible that no woman should appear as a speaker at the historic March on Washington Meeting at the Lincoln Memorial.

The assembled group agreed that Myrlie Evers, the new widow of Medgar Evers, could speak during the &quot;Tribute to Women&quot;. However, Evers was unavailable, having missed her flight, and Daisy Bates spoke briefly (less than 200 words) in place of her. Earlier, Josephine Baker had addressed the crowd before the official program began. Although Gloria Richardson was on the program and had been asked to give a two-minute speech, when she arrived at the stage her chair with her name on it had been removed, and the event marshal took her microphone away after she said &quot;hello&quot;. Richardson, along with Rosa Parks and Lena Horne, was escorted away from the podium before Martin Luther King Jr. spoke.

Early plans for the March would have included an &quot;Unemployed Worker&quot; as one of the speakers. This position was eliminated, furthering criticism of the March&#x27;s middle-class bias.

==Singers==
Gospel legend Mahalia Jackson sang, &quot;I&#x27;ve been &#x27;buked, and I&#x27;ve been scorned&quot;, and &quot;How I Got Over&quot;. Marian Anderson sang &quot;He&#x27;s Got the Whole World in His Hands&quot;. This was not Marian Anderson&#x27;s first appearance at the Lincoln Memorial. In 1939, the Daughters of the American Revolution refused permission for Anderson to sing to an integrated audience in Constitution Hall. With the aid of First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt and her husband Franklin D. Roosevelt, Anderson performed a critically acclaimed open-air concert on Easter Sunday, 1939, on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial.
Joan Baez led the crowds in several verses of &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot; and &quot;Oh Freedom&quot;. Musician Bob Dylan performed &quot;When the Ship Comes In&quot;, for which he was joined by Baez. Dylan also performed &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot;, a provocative and not completely popular choice because it asserted that Byron De La Beckwith, as a poor white man, was not personally or primarily to blame for the murder of Medgar Evers.

Peter, Paul and Mary sang &quot;If I Had a Hammer&quot; and Dylan&#x27;s &quot;Blowin&#x27; in the Wind&quot;. Odetta sang &quot;I&#x27;m On My Way&quot;.

Some participants, including Dick Gregory, criticized the choice of mostly white performers and the lack of group participation in the singing. Dylan himself said he felt uncomfortable as a white man serving as a public image for the Civil Rights Movement. After the March on Washington, he performed at few other immediately politicized events.

==Celebrities==
The event featured many prominent celebrities in addition to singers on the program. Josephine Baker, Harry Belafonte, Sidney Poitier, James Baldwin, Jackie Robinson, Sammy Davis Jr., Dick Gregory, Eartha Kitt, Ossie Davis, Ruby Dee, Diahann Carroll, and Lena Horne were among the black celebrities attending. There were also quite a few white and Latino celebrities who attended or helped fund the March in support of the cause: Tony Curtis, James Garner, Robert Ryan, Charlton Heston, Paul Newman, Joanne Woodward, Rita Moreno, Marlon Brando, Bobby Darin and Burt Lancaster, among others. Judy Garland was part of the planning committee and was also scheduled to perform but had to drop out at the last minute due to commitments to her TV variety series.

== Meeting with President Kennedy ==
After the March, the speakers travelled to the White House for a brief discussion of proposed civil rights legislation with President Kennedy. As the leaders approached The White House, the media reported that Reuther said to King, &quot;Everything was perfect, just perfect.&quot; Kennedy had watched King&#x27;s speech on TV and was very impressed. According to biographer Thomas C. Reeves, Kennedy &quot;felt that he would be booed at the March, and also didn&#x27;t want to meet with organizers before the March because he didn&#x27;t want a list of demands. He arranged a 5 p.m. meeting at the White House with the 10 leaders on the 28th.&quot;

In full, these participants were Mathew Ahmann of the National Catholic Conference for Interracial Justice; Whitney Young of the National Urban League; Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. (SCLC); John Lewis of the SNCC; Rabbi Joachim Prinz of the American Jewish Congress; Reverend Eugene Carson Blake of the United Presbyterian Church; A. Philip Randolph; labor leader Walter Reuther; Roy Wilkins of the NAACP and (not visible shown in the image to the right) Secretary of Labor Willard Wirtz and Floyd McKissick of CORE.

During the meeting, Reuther described to Kennedy how he was framing the civil rights issue to business leaders in Detroit, saying, &quot;Look, you can&#x27;t escape the problem. And there are two ways of resolving it; either by reason or riots.&quot; Reuther continued, &quot;Now the civil war that this is gonna trigger is not gonna be fought at Gettysburg. It&#x27;s gonna to be fought in your backyard, in your plant, where your kids are growing up.&quot; The March was considered a &quot;triumph of managed protest&quot; and Kennedy felt it was a victory for him as well—bolstering the chances for his civil rights bill.

Allowing civil rights leaders to engage in conversation with Kennedy may be considered an example of speaking truth to power.

==Media coverage==
Media attention gave the march national exposure, carrying the organizers&#x27; speeches and offering their own commentary. In his section &quot;The March on Washington and Television News&quot;, William Thomas notes: &quot;Over five hundred cameramen, technicians, and correspondents from the major networks were set to cover the event. More cameras would be set up than had filmed the last Presidential inauguration. One camera was positioned high in the Washington Monument, to give dramatic vistas of the marchers&quot;. The major networks broadcast some of the March live, though they interspersed footage of interviews with politicians. Subsequent broadcasts focused heavily on the &quot;I have a dream&quot; portion of King&#x27;s speech.

The Voice of America translated the speeches and rebroadcast them in 36 languages. The United Information Agency organized a press conference for the benefit of foreign journalists, and also created a documentary film of the event for distribution to embassies abroad. Commented Michael Thelwell of SNCC: &quot;So it happened that Negro students from the South, some of whom still had unhealed bruises from the electric cattle prods which Southern police used to break up demonstrations, were recorded for the screens of the world portraying &#x27;American Democracy at Work.&#x27;&quot;

Some media figures, especially conservative ones, criticized the march. Syndicated columnist David Lawrence called it a &quot;public disgrace&quot; and &quot;the mess in Washington.&quot;

==Responses and memories==

=== Organizers ===
Although the mass media generally declared the March successful because of its high turnout, organizers were not confident that it would create change. Randolph and Rustin abandoned their belief in the effectiveness of marching on Washington. King maintained faith that action in Washington could work, but determined that future marchers would need to call greater attention to economic injustice. In 1967–1968, he organized a Poor People&#x27;s Campaign to occupy the National Mall with a shantytown.

===Critics===
Black nationalist Malcolm X, in his Message to the Grass Roots speech, criticized the march, describing it as &quot;a picnic&quot; and &quot;a circus&quot;. He said the civil rights leaders had diluted the original purpose of the march, which had been to show the strength and anger of black people, by allowing white people and organizations to help plan and participate in the march. One SNCC staffer commented during the march, &quot;He&#x27;s denouncing us as clowns, but he&#x27;s right there with the clown show.&quot; But the membership of SNCC, increasingly frustrated with the tactics of the NAACP and other moderate groups, gradually embraced Malcolm X&#x27;s position.

Segregationists including William Jennings Bryan Dorn criticized the government for cooperating with the civil rights activists. Senator Olin D. Johnston rejected an invitation to attend, writing: &quot;You are committing the worst possible mistake in promoting this March. You should know that criminal, fanatical, and communistic elements, as well as crackpots, will move in to take every advantage of this mob. You certainly will have no influence on any member of Congress, including myself.&quot;

=== Participants ===

Many participants said they felt the March was a historic and life-changing experience. Nan Grogan Orrock, a student at Mary Washington College, said: &quot;You couldn&#x27;t help but get swept up in the feeling of the March. It was an incredible experience of this mass of humanity with one mind moving down the street. It was like being part of a glacier. You could feel the sense of collective will and effort in the air.&quot; SNCC organizer Bob Zellner reported that the event &quot;provided dramatic proof that the sometimes quiet and always dangerous work we did in the Deep South had had a profound national impact. The spectacle of a quarter of a million supporters and activists gave me an assurance that the work I was in the process of dedicating my life to was worth doing.&quot;

Richard Brown, then a white graduate student at Harvard University, recalls that the March fostered direct actions for economic progress: &quot;Henry Armstrong and I compared notes. I realized the Congress of Racial Equality might help black employment in Boston by urging businesses to hire contractors like Armstrong. He agreed to help start a list of reliable contractors that CORE could promote. It was a modest effort—but it moved in the right direction.&quot;

Other participants, more sympathetic to Malcolm X and the black nationalists, expressed ambivalence. One marcher from New York explained:
It&#x27;s like St Patrick&#x27;s Day. I came out of respect for what my people are doing, not because I believe it will do any good. I thought it would do some good in the beginning. But when the march started to get all the official approval from &quot;Mastah&quot; Kennedy, &quot;Mastah&quot; Wagner, &quot;Mastah&quot; Spellman, and they started setting limits on how we had to march peacefully, I knew that the march was going to be a mockery, that &quot;they&quot; were giving &quot;us&quot; something again.

Marcher Beverly Alston thought that the day had its greatest impact within the movement: &quot;Culturally, there has been tremendous progress over the past forty years. Black awareness and self-determination has soared. Politically, I just don&#x27;t think we&#x27;ve made enough progress.&quot; Fifteen-year-old Ericka Jenkins from Washington said:
I saw people laughing and listening and standing very close to one another, almost in an embrace. Children of every size, pregnant women, elderly people who seemed tired but happy to be there, clothing that made me know that they struggled to make it day to day, made me know they worked in farms or offices or even nearby for the government. I didn&#x27;t see teenagers alone; I saw groups of teenagers with teachers. 
White people [were] standing in wonder. Their eyes were open, they were &quot;listening&quot;. Openness and nothing on guard—I saw that in everybody. I was so happy to see that in the white people that they could listen and take in and respect and believe in the words of a black person. I had never seen anything like that.

Some people discussed racism becoming less explicit after the March. Reverend Abraham Woods of Birmingham commented: &quot;Everything has changed. And when you look at it, nothing has changed. Racism is under the surface, and an incident that could scratch it, can bring it out.&quot;

== Effects and legacy ==
The symbolism of the March has been contested since before it even took place. In the years following the March, movement radicals increasingly subscribed to Malcolm X&#x27;s narrative of the March as a co-optation by the white establishment. However, some black nationalist intellectuals did not see that the liberal reforms of the Johnson administration would assure &quot;full integration&quot; based upon the existing power structures and persisting racist culture of daily life in America. Former Communist Party member Harold Cruse posited that full integration was &quot;not possible within the present framework of the American system&quot;. Black Panther Party member and lawyer Kathleen Cleaver held radical views that only revolution could transform American society to bring about the redistribution of wealth and power that was needed to end the historical facts of exclusion and inequality.

Liberals and conservatives tended to embrace the March, but focused mostly on King&#x27;s &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech and the legislative successes of 1964 and 1965. The mass media identified King&#x27;s speech as a highlight of the event and focused on this oration to the exclusion of other aspects. For several decades, King took center stage in narratives about the March. More recently, historians and commentators have acknowledged the role played by Bayard Rustin in organizing the event.

The March was an early example of social movements conducting mass rallies in Washington, D.C., and was followed by several other marches in the capital, many of which used similar names.

For the 50th Anniversary of the March, the United States Postal Service released a forever stamp that commemorated it.

=== Political effects ===
Soon after the speakers ended their meetings with Congress to go join the March, both houses passed legislation to create a dispute arbitration board for striking railroad workers.

The March is credited with propelling the U.S. government into action on civil rights, creating political momentum for the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.

The cooperation of a Democratic administration with the issue of civil rights marked a pivotal moment in voter alignment within the U.S. The Democratic Party gave up the Solid South—its undivided support since Reconstruction among the segregated Southern states—and went on to capture a high proportion of votes from Black people from the Republicans.

=== Anniversary marches ===
The 1963 March also spurred anniversary marches that occur every five years, with the 20th and 25th being some of the most well known. The 20th Anniversary theme was &quot;We Still have a Dream ... Jobs*Peace*Freedom.&quot;

At the 50th anniversary march in 2013, President Barack Obama conferred a posthumous Presidential Medal of Freedom on Bayard Rustin and 15 others.

==== 2020 Virtual March on Washington ====
On July 20, 2020, the NAACP, one of the original organizers of the 1963 march, announced that it would commemorate it by organizing another rally on the steps of the Lincoln Memorial, in which King&#x27;s oldest son, Martin Luther King III, would join civil rights leaders and the families of black men and women who died as a result of police brutality. An online tie-in event was also planned, called the 2020 Virtual March on Washington. It was held August 27 and 28, the latter being the anniversary of the iconic &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech, and the day after President Trump was scheduled to accept his party&#x27;s nomination for president at the Republican National Convention. Addressing the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, the organizers explained that the virtual component of the rally was organized to enable participation by people unable to travel to Washington D.C. or safely participate in the in-person event. The NAACP&#x27;s Virtual March featured performances from Macy Gray, Burna Boy, and speeches from Stacey Abrams, Nancy Pelosi, Cory Booker, and Mahershala Ali, among many others. It was a two-night event broadcast on ABC News Live, Bounce TV, TV One and on online platforms.

====2021 Voting Rights and D.C. Statehood March====
On August 28, 2021, a march calling for voting rights and statehood for Washington D.C. was held in Washington D.C on the 58th anniversary of the March on Washington. Though the numbers in the march permit revealed that 100,000 people were expected to attend, it was estimated that only 50,000 people attended. However, the smaller crowd size did match the National Action Network&#x27;s earlier estimate. Among the speakers were Martin Luther King III, his wife and Drum Major Institute president Arndrea Waters King, daughter Yolanda, National Action Network leader Rev. Al Sharpton and Washington D.C. Mayor Muriel Bowser. Other speakers at the event included Democratic U.S. Representatives Joyce Beatty, of Ohio, Terri Sewell, of Alabama, Sheila Jackson Lee and Al Green, both of Texas, and Mondaire Jones, of New York; NAACP president Derrick Johnson; and Philonise Floyd, activist and brother of George Floyd.

==== 2023 60th Anniversary March ====
On August 26, 2023, a march was held in Washington D.C on the 60th anniversary of the March on Washington. Organizers include Martin Luther King III, his wife and Drum Major Institute president Arndrea Waters King, daughter Yolanda and National Action Network leader Rev. Al Sharpton. Tens of thousands of people gathered for a five-hour program that featured dozens of speakers.

==Analysis==
In 2013, the Economic Policy Institute launched a series of reports around the theme of &quot;The Unfinished March&quot;. These reports analyze the goals of the original march and assess how much progress has been made. They echo the message of Randolph and Rustin that civil rights cannot transform people&#x27;s quality of life unless accompanied by economic justice. They contend that many of the March&#x27;s primary goals—including housing, integrated education, and widespread employment at living wages—have not been accomplished. They further argued that although legal advances were made, black people still live in concentrated areas of poverty (&quot;ghettoes&quot;), where they receive inferior education and suffer from widespread unemployment.

Dedrick Muhammad of the NAACP writes that racial inequality of income and homeownership have increased since 1963 and worsened during the recent Great Recession.

<text>Nondestructive testing (NDT) is any of a wide group of analysis techniques used in science and technology industry to evaluate the properties of a material, component or system without causing damage.
The terms nondestructive examination (NDE), nondestructive inspection (NDI), and nondestructive evaluation (NDE) are also commonly used to describe this technology.
Because NDT does not permanently alter the article being inspected, it is a highly valuable technique that can save both money and time in product evaluation, troubleshooting, and research. The six most frequently used NDT methods are eddy-current, magnetic-particle, liquid penetrant, radiographic, ultrasonic, and visual testing. NDT is commonly used in forensic engineering, mechanical engineering, petroleum engineering, electrical engineering, civil engineering, systems engineering, aeronautical engineering, medicine, and art. Innovations in the field of nondestructive testing have had a profound impact on medical imaging, including on echocardiography, medical ultrasonography, and digital radiography.

Non-Destructive Testing (NDT/ NDT testing) Techniques or Methodologies allow the investigator to carry out examinations without invading the integrity of the engineering specimen under observation while providing an elaborate view of the surface and structural discontinuities and obstructions. The personnel carrying out these methodologies require specialized NDT Training as they involve handling delicate equipment and subjective interpretation of the NDT inspection/NDT testing results.

NDT methods rely upon use of electromagnetic radiation, sound and other signal conversions to examine a wide variety of articles (metallic and non-metallic, food-product, artifacts and antiquities, infrastructure) for integrity, composition, or condition with no alteration of the article undergoing examination. Visual inspection (VT), the most commonly applied NDT method, is quite often enhanced by the use of magnification, borescopes, cameras, or other optical arrangements for direct or remote viewing. The internal structure of a sample can be examined for a volumetric inspection with penetrating radiation (RT), such as X-rays, neutrons or gamma radiation. Sound waves are utilized in the case of ultrasonic testing (UT), another volumetric NDT method – the mechanical signal (sound) being reflected by conditions in the test article and evaluated for amplitude and distance from the search unit (transducer). Another commonly used NDT method used on ferrous materials involves the application of fine iron particles (either suspended in liquid or dry powder – fluorescent or colored) that are applied to a part while it is magnetized, either continually or residually. The particles will be attracted to leakage fields of magnetism on or in the test object, and form indications (particle collection) on the object&#x27;s surface, which are evaluated visually. Contrast and probability of detection for a visual examination by the unaided eye is often enhanced by using liquids to penetrate the test article surface, allowing for visualization of flaws or other surface conditions. This method (liquid penetrant testing) (PT) involves using dyes, fluorescent or colored (typically red), suspended in fluids and is used for non-magnetic materials, usually metals.

Analyzing and documenting a nondestructive failure mode can also be accomplished using a high-speed camera recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplished using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera. These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture some non-destructive failures. After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording. The captured images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happened before, during and after the nondestructive event, image by image.

==Applications==
NDT is used in a variety of settings that covers a wide range of industrial activity, with new NDT methods and applications, being continuously developed. Nondestructive testing methods are routinely applied in industries where a failure of a component would cause significant hazard or economic loss, such as in transportation, pressure vessels, building structures, piping, and hoisting equipment.

===Weld verification===
In manufacturing, welds are commonly used to join two or more metal parts. Because these connections may encounter loads and fatigue during product lifetime, there is a chance that they may fail if not created to proper specification. For example, the base metal must reach a certain temperature during the welding process, must cool at a specific rate, and must be welded with compatible materials or the joint may not be strong enough to hold the parts together, or cracks may form in the weld causing it to fail. The typical welding defects (lack of fusion of the weld to the base metal, cracks or porosity inside the weld, and variations in weld density) could cause a structure to break or a pipeline to rupture.

Welds may be tested using NDT techniques such as industrial radiography or industrial CT scanning using X-rays or gamma rays, ultrasonic testing, liquid penetrant testing, magnetic particle inspection or via eddy current. In a proper weld, these tests would indicate a lack of cracks in the radiograph, show clear passage of sound through the weld and back, or indicate a clear surface without penetrant captured in cracks.

Welding techniques may also be actively monitored with acoustic emission techniques before production to design the best set of parameters to use to properly join two materials. In the case of high stress or safety critical welds, weld monitoring will be employed to confirm the specified welding parameters (arc current, arc voltage, travel speed, heat input etc.) are being adhered to those stated in the welding procedure. This verifies the weld as correct to procedure prior to nondestructive evaluation and metallurgy tests.

===Structural mechanics===
Structure can be complex systems that undergo different loads during their lifetime, e.g. Lithium-ion batteries. Some complex structures, such as the turbo machinery in a liquid-fuel rocket, can also cost millions of dollars. Engineers will commonly model these structures as coupled second-order systems, approximating dynamic structure components with springs, masses, and dampers. The resulting sets of differential equations are then used to derive a transfer function that models the behavior of the system.

In NDT, the structure undergoes a dynamic input, such as the tap of a hammer or a controlled impulse. Key properties, such as displacement or acceleration at different points of the structure, are measured as the corresponding output. This output is recorded and compared to the corresponding output given by the transfer function and the known input. Differences may indicate an inappropriate model (which may alert engineers to unpredicted instabilities or performance outside of tolerances), failed components, or an inadequate control system.

Reference standards, which are structures that intentionally flawed in order to be compared with components intended for use in the field, are often used in NDT. Reference standards can be with many NDT techniques, such as UT, RT and VT.

===Relation to medical procedures===
Several NDT methods are related to clinical procedures, such as radiography, ultrasonic testing, and visual testing. 
Technological improvements or upgrades in these NDT methods have migrated over from medical equipment advances, including digital radiography (DR), phased array ultrasonic testing (PAUT), and endoscopy (borescope or assisted visual inspection).

==Notable events in academic and industrial NDT==
*1854 Hartford, Connecticut – A boiler at the Fales and Gray Car works explodes, killing 21 people and seriously injuring 50. Within a decade, the State of Connecticut passes a law requiring annual inspection (in this case visual) of boilers.
*1880–1920 – The &quot;Oil and Whiting&quot; method of crack detection is used in the railroad industry to find cracks in heavy steel parts. (A part is soaked in thinned oil, then painted with a white coating that dries to a powder. Oil seeping out from cracks turns the white powder brown, allowing the cracks to be detected.) This was the precursor to modern liquid penetrant tests.
*1895 – Wilhelm Conrad Röntgen discovers what are now known as X-rays. In his first paper he discusses the possibility of flaw detection.
*1920 – Dr. H. H. Lester begins development of industrial radiography for metals.
*1924 – Lester uses radiography to examine castings to be installed in a Boston Edison Company steam pressure power plant.
*1926 – The first electromagnetic eddy current instrument is available to measure material thicknesses.
*1927-1928 – Magnetic induction system to detect flaws in railroad track developed by Dr. Elmer Sperry and H.C. Drake.
*1929 – Magnetic particle methods and equipment pioneered (A.V. DeForest and F.B. Doane.)
*1930s – Robert F. Mehl demonstrates radiographic imaging using gamma radiation from Radium, which can examine thicker components than the low-energy X-ray machines available at the time.
*1935–1940 – Liquid penetrant tests developed (Betz, Doane, and DeForest)

Extracts from the first two paragraphs of this seminal patent for a nondestructive testing method succinctly describe the basics of ultrasonic testing. &quot;My invention pertains to a device for detecting the presence of inhomogeneities of density or elasticity in materials. For instance if a casting has a hole or a crack within it, my device allows the presence of the flaw to be detected and its position located, even though the flaw lies entirely within the casting and no portion of it extends out to the surface.&quot; Additionally, &quot;The general principle of my device consists of sending high frequency vibrations into the part to be inspected, and the determination of the time intervals of arrival of the direct and reflected vibrations at one or more stations on the surface of the part.&quot; Medical echocardiography is an offshoot of this technology.
*1946 – First neutron radiographs produced by Peters.
*1950 – The Schmidt Hammer (also known as &quot;Swiss Hammer&quot;) is invented. The instrument uses the world&#x27;s first patented non-destructive testing method for concrete.

== ISO 9712 ==
This ISO 9712 requirements for principles for the qualification and certification of personnel who perform industrial non-destructive testing(NDT).

The system specified in this International Standard can also apply to other NDT methods or to new techniques within an established NDT method, provided a comprehensive scheme of certification exists and the method or technique is covered by International, regional or national standards or the new NDT method or technique has been demonstrated to be effective to the satisfaction of the certification body.

The certification covers proficiency in one or more of the following methods: a) acoustic emission testing; b) eddy current testing; c) infrared thermographic testing; d) leak testing (hydraulic pressure tests excluded); e) magnetic testing; f) penetrant testing; g) radiographic testing; h) strain gauge testing; i) ultrasonic testing; j) visual testing (direct unaided visual tests and visual tests carried out during the application of another NDT method are excluded).

==Methods and techniques==
NDT is divided into various &quot;methods&quot; of nondestructive testing, each based on a particular scientific principle. These methods may be further subdivided into various &quot;techniques&quot;. The various methods and techniques, due to their particular natures, may lend themselves especially well to certain applications and be of little or no value at all in other applications. Therefore, choosing the right method and technique is an important part of the performance of NDT.

==Personnel training, qualification and certification==

Successful and consistent application of nondestructive testing techniques depends heavily on personnel training, experience and integrity. Personnel involved in application of industrial NDT methods and interpretation of results should be certified, and in some industrial sectors certification is enforced by law or by the applied codes and standards.

NDT professionals and managers who seek to further their growth, knowledge and experience to remain competitive in the rapidly advancing technology field of nondestructive testing should consider joining NDTMA, a member organization of NDT Managers and Executives who work to provide a forum for the open exchange of managerial, technical and regulatory information critical to the successful management of NDT personnel and activities. Their annual conference at the Golden Nugget in Las Vegas is a popular for its informative and relevant programming and exhibition space

===Certification schemes===

There are two approaches in personnel certification:

# Employer Based Certification: Under this concept the employer compiles their own &quot;Written Practice&quot;. The written practice defines the responsibilities of each level of certification, as implemented by the company, and describes the training, experience and examination requirements for each level of certification. In industrial sectors the written practices are usually based on recommended practice SNT-TC-1A of the American Society for Nondestructive Testing. ANSI standard CP-189 outlines requirements for any written practice that conforms to the standard. For aviation, space, and defense (ASD) applications NAS 410 sets further requirements for NDT personnel, and is published by AIA – Aerospace Industries Association, which is made up of US aerospace airframe and powerplant manufacturers. This is the basis document for EN 4179 and other (USA) NIST-recognized aerospace standards for the Qualification and Certification (employer-based) of Nondestructive Testing personnel. NAS 410 also sets the requirements also for &quot;National NDT Boards&quot;, which allow and proscribe personal certification schemes. NAS 410 allows ASNT Certification as a portion of the qualifications needed for ASD certification.
# Personal Central Certification: The concept of central certification is that an NDT operator can obtain certification from a central certification authority, that is recognized by most employers, third parties and/or government authorities. Industrial standards for central certification schemes include ISO 9712, and ANSI/ASNT CP-106 (used for the ASNT ACCP scheme). Certification under these standards involves training, work experience under supervision and passing a written and practical examination set up by the independent certification authority. EN 473 was another central certification scheme, very similar to ISO 9712, which was withdrawn when CEN replaced it with &quot;EN ISO 9712&quot; in 2012.

In the United States employer based schemes are the norm, however central certification schemes exist as well. The most notable is &quot;ASNT Level III&quot; (established in 1976–1977), which is organized by the American Society for Nondestructive Testing for Level 3 NDT personnel. &quot;NAVSEA 250-1500&quot; is another US central certification scheme, specifically developed for use in the naval nuclear program.

Central certification is more widely used in the European Union, where certifications are issued by accredited bodies (independent organizations conforming to ISO 17024 and accredited by a national accreditation authority like UKAS). The Pressure Equipment Directive (97/23/EC) actually enforces central personnel certification for the initial testing of steam boilers and some categories of pressure vessels and piping. European Standards harmonized with this directive specify personnel certification to EN 473. Certifications issued by a national NDT society which is a member of the European Federation of NDT (EFNDT) are mutually acceptable by the other member societies under a multilateral recognition agreement.

Canada also implements an ISO 9712 central certification scheme, which is administered by Natural Resources Canada, a government department.

The aerospace sector worldwide sticks to employer based schemes. In America it is based mostly on the Aerospace Industries Association&#x27;s (AIA) AIA-NAS-410 and in the European Union on the equivalent and very similar standard EN 4179. However EN 4179:2009 includes an option for central qualification and certification by a &quot;National aerospace NDT board&quot; or &quot;NANDTB&quot; (paragraph 4.5.2).

===Levels of certification===

Most NDT personnel certification schemes listed above specify three &quot;levels&quot; of qualification and/or certification, usually designated as &quot;Level 1&quot;, &quot;Level 2&quot; and &quot;Level 3&quot; (although some codes specify Roman numerals, like &quot;Level II&quot;). The roles and responsibilities of personnel in each level are generally as follows (there are slight differences or variations between different codes and standards):

* Level 1 are technicians qualified to perform only specific calibrations and tests under close supervision and direction by higher level personnel. They can only report test results. Normally they work following specific work instructions for testing procedures and rejection criteria.
* Level 2 are engineers or experienced technicians who are able to set up and calibrate testing equipment, conduct the inspection according to codes and standards (instead of following work instructions) and compile work instructions for Level 1 technicians. They are also authorized to report, interpret, evaluate and document testing results. They can also supervise and train Level 1 technicians. In addition to testing methods, they must be familiar with applicable codes and standards and have some knowledge of the manufacture and service of tested products.
* Level 3 are usually specialized engineers or very experienced technicians. They can establish NDT techniques and procedures and interpret codes and standards. They also direct NDT laboratories and have central role in personnel certification. They are expected to have wider knowledge covering materials, fabrication and product technology.

==Terminology==
The standard US terminology for Nondestructive testing is defined in standard ASTM E-1316. Some definitions may be different in European standard EN 1330.

;Indication : The response or evidence from an examination, such as a blip on the screen of an instrument. Indications are classified as &quot;true&quot; or &quot;false&quot;. &quot;False indications&quot; are those caused by factors not related to the principles of the testing method or by improper implementation of the method, like film damage in radiography, electrical interference in ultrasonic testing etc. &quot;True indications&quot; are further classified as &quot;relevant&quot; and &quot;non relevant&quot;. &quot;Relevant indications&quot; are those caused by flaws. &quot;Non relevant indications&quot; are those caused by known features of the tested object, like gaps, threads, case hardening etc.
;Interpretation : Determining if an indication is of a type to be investigated. For example, in electromagnetic testing, indications from metal loss are considered flaws because they should usually be investigated, but indications due to variations in the material properties may be harmless and nonrelevant.
;Flaw : A type of discontinuity that must be investigated to see if it is rejectable. For example, porosity in a weld or metal loss.
;Evaluation : Determining if a flaw is rejectable. For example, is porosity in a weld larger than acceptable by code?
;Defect : A flaw that is rejectable – i.e. does not meet acceptance criteria. Defects are generally removed or repaired.

==Reliability and statistics==
Probability of detection (POD) tests are a standard way to evaluate a nondestructive testing technique in a given set of circumstances, for example &quot;What is the POD of lack of fusion flaws in pipe welds using manual ultrasonic testing?&quot; The POD will usually increase with flaw size. A common error in POD tests is to assume that the percentage of flaws detected is the POD, whereas the percentage of flaws detected is merely the first step in the analysis. Since the number of flaws tested is necessarily a limited number (non-infinite), statistical methods must be used to determine the POD for all possible defects, beyond the limited number tested. Another common error in POD tests is to define the statistical sampling units (test items) as flaws, whereas a true sampling unit is an item that may or may not contain a flaw. Guidelines for correct application of statistical methods to POD tests can be found in ASTM E2862 Standard Practice for Probability of Detection Analysis for Hit/Miss Data and MIL-HDBK-1823A Nondestructive Evaluation System Reliability Assessment, from the U.S. Department of Defense Handbook.

<text>I Know What You Did Last Summer is a 1997 American slasher film directed by Jim Gillespie and written by Kevin Williamson. It stars Jennifer Love Hewitt, Sarah Michelle Gellar, Ryan Phillippe, and Freddie Prinze Jr., with supporting roles played by Johnny Galecki, Bridgette Wilson, Anne Heche, and Muse Watson. The first installment in the &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; franchise, it is loosely based on the 1973 novel by Lois Duncan. The film centers on four teenage friends, who are stalked by a hook-wielding killer one year after covering up a car accident in which they supposedly killed a man. It also draws inspiration from the urban legend known as &quot;the Hook&quot;, as well as the slasher films &quot;Prom Night&quot; (1980) and &quot;The House on Sorority Row&quot; (1982).

Williamson was approached to adapt Duncan&#x27;s source novel by producer Erik Feig. Where &quot;Scream&quot;, released the previous year, contained prominent elements of satire and self-referentiality, Williamson&#x27;s script for &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; reworked the novel&#x27;s central plot to resemble a straightforward 1980s-era slasher film.

&quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; was released theatrically in the United States on October 17, 1997. It received a mixed reception from critics and was a sizeable commercial hit, grossing $125.3million worldwide on a budget of $17million, staying in first place at the U.S. box office for three consecutive weeks. The film was parodied in &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000) and is frequently referenced in popular culture, as well as being credited alongside &quot;Scream&quot; with revitalizing the slasher genre in the 1990s.

The film was followed by a sequel, &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (1998), in which Hewitt, Prinze Jr., and Watson reprised their roles. A straight-to-video standalone sequel, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; (2006), featured an entirely new cast. Following a television series adaptation released by Amazon Prime Video in 2021, a direct legacy sequel to the first two films is scheduled to be released by Sony Pictures on July 18, 2025.

==Plot==
On July 4, 1996, in Southport, North Carolina, Julie James and her friends Ray Bronson, Helen Shivers, and Barry Cox drive to the beach. On the way back, they accidentally hit a pedestrian. Julie&#x27;s friend Max passes by them on the road. Barry and Helen try to dump the body in the water, but the pedestrian wakes up and grabs Helen. Barry pushes him into the water and the group swears to never discuss what happened.

One year later, Julie returns home from college for the summer. The friends have gone their separate ways, with none of them pursuing their dreams due to struggling with the incident. Julie receives a letter stating, &quot;I know what you did last summer!&quot; She and Helen take the note to Barry, who suspects Max. Julie meets Ray, who now works as a fisherman. Max is killed by a figure in a raincoat wielding a hook. That night, Barry is ambushed by the assailant stealing and driving his car.

Julie researches newspaper articles, believing that the man they ran over was a local named David Egan. Helen and Julie meet David&#x27;s sister Missy at her home. Missy explains that a friend of David&#x27;s named Billy Blue visited her to pay his respects. That night, the killer sneaks into Helen&#x27;s house and cuts off her hair while she sleeps.

The following morning, Julie finds Max&#x27;s corpse wearing Barry&#x27;s stolen jacket and covered in crabs in the trunk of her car. When she brings the others to see it, the body has been removed. Julie, Helen and Barry confront Ray, who claims to also have received a letter. Julie goes back to visit Missy, while Barry and Helen participate in the 4th of July parade. Missy reveals that David allegedly committed suicide out of guilt for the death of his girlfriend, Susie Willis, in a car accident and shows David&#x27;s suicide note. As the writing matches that of the note she received, Julie realizes it was not a suicide note, but a death threat.

At the Croaker Beauty Pageant, Helen witnesses Barry being murdered on the balcony but finds no sign of the killer or Barry. The police officer escorting her home is murdered by the killer. Helen runs to her family&#x27;s store, where the killer murders her sister Elsa. She escapes and runs toward the street, but the killer slashes her to death.

Julie finds an article mentioning Susie&#x27;s father, Ben Willis, and realizes Ben was the man they had run over a year earlier, moments after he killed David to avenge his daughter. She goes to tell Ray, but notices Ray&#x27;s boat is called &quot;Billy Blue&quot;. A fisherman knocks Ray unconscious, inviting Julie to hide on his boat. On the boat, she finds photos and articles about her and her friends, and pictures of Susie. The boat leaves the docks, and the fisherman is revealed to be Ben Willis, targeting them in revenge for leaving him for dead.

Ben chases Julie below deck, where she uncovers the bodies of Helen and Barry in the icebox. Ray awakens and goes to rescue Julie. He ultimately uses the rigging to sever Ben&#x27;s hand and send him overboard. He explains that he posed as David&#x27;s friend and visited Missy out of guilt. The couple reconciles, relieved not to have actually killed anyone after all.

One year later, Julie is in college in Boston. As she enters the shower, she notices the words &quot;I still know&quot; written in the steam on the shower door. A dark figure then crashes through the door as she screams.

==Production==
===Development and writing===
====Background====
Written by Kevin Williamson, the screenplay for &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; was rushed into production—having previously been disregarded—by Columbia Pictures upon the success of the Williamson-written &quot;Scream&quot;,
released in 1996.

The film is based on the 1973 novel by Lois Duncan, a youth-oriented suspense novel about four teenagers who are involved in a hit-and-run accident involving a young boy.

====Development====
Producer Erik Feig pitched the idea of a screen adaptation to Mandalay Entertainment, and subsequently appointed Williamson to retool the core elements of Duncan&#x27;s novel, rendering a screenplay more akin to a 1980s slasher film. Inspired by his father, who had been a commercial fisherman, Williamson changed the setting of the novel to a small fishing village, and made the villain a hook-wielding fisherman.

The killer&#x27;s arming of himself with a hook is a reference to the urban legend &quot;the Hook&quot;, which the four main characters recount at the beginning of the film around a campfire. According to Williamson, he wrote the scene as a way of indicating what was to come: &quot;Basically what I was doing was I was setting the framework to say, &#x27;All right, audience: That&#x27;s that legend. Now here&#x27;s a new one.&#x27;&quot; Unlike Williamson&#x27;s screenplay for the film&#x27;s contemporary, &quot;Scream&quot;, which incorporated satire of the slasher film, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; was written more as a straightforward slasher film. Gillespie commented in 2008: &quot;The joy of this film for me as a filmmaker was in taking [the] elements that we&#x27;ve seen before, and saying to the audience: &#x27;Here&#x27;s something you&#x27;ve seen before&#x27;—knowing that they&#x27;re saying &#x27;We&#x27;ve seen this before&#x27;—and still getting them to jump.&quot; Gillespie also claimed that he felt Williamson&#x27;s screenplay did not resemble a &quot;slasher horror movie&quot; and that he saw it rather as simply &quot;a really good story&quot; with a morality tale embedded within it.

===Pre-production===
According to producer Stokely Chaffin, the producers sought out actors who were &quot;beautiful, but likable&quot;. Director Gillespie recalled that, though he had been unfamiliar with the screenplay&#x27;s source material, that &quot;roughly 60 to 65%&quot; of the young women auditioning had read the novel as children. Jennifer Love Hewitt, who at the time was mainly known for her role on the television series &quot;Party of Five&quot;, was cast in the lead of Julie James based on her &quot;ability to project vulnerability&quot;, which the producers, director Gillespie and writer Williamson unanimously agreed upon. Initially, Hewitt was considered for the role of Helen. Melissa Joan Hart was offered a role, but she turned it down, because she felt that the film was a rip-off of &quot;Scream&quot;. For the role of Barry, the crew had envisioned an actor with a &quot; quarterback&quot; appearance, as the character had been written as an intimidating figure. Ryan Phillippe was ultimately cast in the part based on his audition, despite the fact that he was not as physically tall as the script had called for. Director Gillespie chose Freddie Prinze Jr. for the role of Ray, because he felt Prinze himself had an &quot;everyman&quot; quality much like the character.

Sarah Michelle Gellar was the last of the lead performers to be cast in the role of Helen. Like Hewitt, Gellar was also known to American audiences at the time for her roles in television. Gillespie commented on casting Gellar: &quot;I wanted an actress that had a warmth to her, but could still come off as being a bitch.&quot; For the supporting role of Missy, Gillespie sought an actress with significant screen presence, as the character, despite appearing in only two scenes, is central to several major plot points. Anne Heche was cast in the role, which she recalled as being two days&#x27; worth of work that required her to &quot;be scary&quot;.

===Filming===

Scottish director Jim Gillespie was hired to direct the film after being suggested by writer Williamson. Star Hewitt would later state in 2008 that Gillespie was to date her &quot;favorite director [she&#x27;s] ever worked with.&quot; Principal photography began on March 31, 1997, and took place over a period of ten weeks throughout the late spring-early summer of 1997. Approximately seven weeks of the ten-week shoot took place at night, which Gillespie says was difficult for the cast and crew, and also created commotion in primary small-town locations in which they shot. Gillespie devised a color scheme with cinematographer Denis Crossan which was marked by heavy blues throughout and a notable lack of bright colors.

For the beginning of the film, coastal areas of Sonoma County, California stood in for North Carolina, where the film is set. The opening shots of the sun setting on a rugged coast were filmed at Kolmer Gulch, just north of the town of Jenner, on Highway 1. The car crash scene was also filmed on Highway 1 in the same area. The scene in which the four friends are seated around a campfire on the beach next to a wrecked boat was inspired by a painting Gillespie had seen in a reference book; to achieve the image, the art department purchased an old boat in Bodega Bay, cut it in half and placed it at the beach location.

The remaining scenes were filmed primarily around the town of Southport, North Carolina. Specific sites included the Amuzu Theater, where the beauty pageant is held, the Old Yacht Basin and Southport Fish Company. Julie&#x27;s house is on Short Street just north of Southport Marina. The daytime sequences shot on the marina show multiple vessels traversing the water; though real vessels, the boat traffic was orchestrated by a marine traffic coordinator to make the waterway appear lively. The Shiver&#x27;s Department Store setting in the film was discovered on location in Southport by director Gillespie, who was so impressed by the location that he reworked elements of the script in order to incorporate it into the film; it eventually became the primary setting for Helen&#x27;s extended chase sequence with the killer. The exterior sequences of Julie&#x27;s Boston college campus were in fact shot at Duke University, while the hospital sequence was filmed at Southport&#x27;s Dosher Memorial Hospital in an unused wing of the hospital.

There is a climatic scene where Jennifer Love Hewitt&#x27;s character walks into the middle of the street and screams to the killer &quot;What are you waiting for?!&quot;. According to Hewitt, that scene was conceived and directed by a child who won a contest to &quot;come on and create a moment for the movie&quot;. In an interview with &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, she stated that she disliked the idea but still went through with it, and noted that the scene &quot;became the biggest part of the movie&quot; and that ultimately it was &quot;a great idea&quot;.

The final sequence on the boat was shot on an actual water-bound vessel on the Cape Fear River, which proved difficult for the actors and crew. According to Gillespie, the filmmakers nearly lost the boat while attempting to dock it due to the volatile waters, after which they were forced to leave and shoot other footage until the following day.

===Post-production===
Gillespie chose to film virtually no onscreen blood as he did not want the film to be overly gratuitous in terms of violence. The scene in which Elsa has her throat slashed while standing against a glass door had originally been shot from behind without any blood appearing on the glass. However, producer Feig worried that the scene appeared &quot;medically impossible&quot; after which Gillespie re-shot it (post-principal photography) with a visual effect of blood spattering across the glass. Upon test screenings of the film, Gillespie and the producers decided that a death sequence needed to occur earlier in the film to establish a sense of legitimate danger for the main characters. The scene in which Max is murdered in the crab factory was subsequently filmed and implemented into the final cut to achieve this (in the original script, his character was not killed).

The original ending of the film featured a sequence in which Julie receives an email reading: &quot;I Still Know&quot;. This ending was scrapped for the more dramatic ending featured in the final cut of the film, in which Julie finds the same message scrawled on a shower stall just before the killer comes crashing through the glass. This footage was also shot after principal photography, on a soundstage next-door to where Hewitt was filming &quot;Party of Five&quot;.

==Music==
The film produced two soundtracks. One of them featured the score composed by John Debney, while the other contained various rock songs found in the film.



Additional songs featured in the film (but not on a soundtrack):
* &quot;Forgotten Too&quot; by Ugly Beauty
* &quot;Wake Up Call&quot; by The Mighty Mighty Bosstones
* &quot;Where Did You Sleep Last Night&quot; by Lead Belly
* &quot;You&#x27;re a Grand Old Flag&quot; by George M. Cohan
* &quot;Beautiful Girl&quot; by Bing Crosby
* &quot;Free&quot; by Ultra Naté

==Release==
===Marketing and lawsuit===
In anticipation of its release, distributor Columbia Pictures began a summer marketing campaign that presented the film as being &quot;From the creator of &quot;Scream&quot;,&quot; meaning writer Kevin Williamson. Miramax Films subsequently filed a lawsuit against Columbia, arguing the statement was misleading as it suggested that Wes Craven, the director of &quot;Scream&quot;, had been involved with the production.

The week following the film&#x27;s theatrical release, a federal judge awarded Miramax an injunction requiring that Columbia remove the claim from their advertising. (Williamson himself had already requested its removal by this point after spotting it on a theater poster.) Miramax won the lawsuit against Columbia during a March 1998 hearing. In a press release, executive Bob Weinstein noted plans to &quot;vigorously pursue&quot; damage claims against Columbia Pictures.

=== Home media ===
The film was released on VHS and DVD by Columbia TriStar Home Video in the US on June 16, 1998. Special features included a theatrical trailer and the filmmaker&#x27;s commentary.

Sony Pictures Home Entertainment released the film on Blu-ray for the first time on July 22, 2008, with additional special features including the director&#x27;s short film, &quot;Joyride&quot;. On September 30, 2014, Mill Creek Entertainment re-released the film on Blu-ray as a budget disc, featuring the film alone with no bonus materials. On September 27, 2022, Sony Pictures Home Entertainment re-released the film for the first time on Ultra HD Blu-ray for its 25th anniversary.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; opened theatrically in North America on October 17, 1997. The film was made on a $17 million budget, and grossed $15,818,645 in 2,524 theaters in its opening weekend in the United States and Canada, ranking number one; it remained in the number one position for an additional two weekends. By the end of its theatrical run in December 1997, it had grossed $72,586,134 in the U.S. and Canada and $53 million in other countries for a worldwide total of $126 million.

According to data compiled by Box Office Mojo, &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; is the seventh highest-grossing slasher film as of 2021.

In retrospect, Jim Gillespie said: &quot;It was meant to be kind of a stand-alone revisit of those classic &#x27;80s horror films. It worked! The movie was number one three weeks in a row. It just clicked with the audience. The title clicked and everything just seemed to work. Third week was Halloween weekend and it was number one in its third week. I couldn&#x27;t believe it stuck there for three weeks.&quot;

===Critical response===
On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 47% based on 79 reviews, with an average rating of 5.4 out of 10. The site&#x27;s critics consensus reads: &quot;A by-the-numbers slasher that arrived a decade too late, the mostly tedious &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; will likely only hook diehard fans of the genre.&quot; On Metacritic, it has a weighted average score of 52 out of 100 based on reviews from 17 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B−&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

The film drew both positive and negative comparisons to &quot;Scream&quot;, also written by Williamson. Mick LaSalle considered the movie inferior to its predecessor. Richard Harrington, on the other hand, cited &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; as superior to &quot;Scream&quot;; he described the newer picture as &quot;... a smart and sharply-drawn genre-film with a moral center, and with a solid cast of young actors to hold it.&quot; Derek Elley of &quot;Variety&quot; was also enthusiastic, calling the film a &quot;polished genre piece with superior fright elements that should perform at better-than-average theatrical levels.&quot; Roger Ebert gave the movie one of four stars and wrote that &quot;The best shot in this film is the first one. Not a good sign.&quot; &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised Jennifer Love Hewitt&#x27;s performance, noting that she &quot;knows how to scream with soul&quot;.

Lawrence Van Gelder of &quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote of the picture: &quot;This isn&#x27;t real life. It&#x27;s the grand guignol of &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, laying its claim to succeed &quot;Scream&quot; as a high-grossing and blood-drenched date-night crowd-pleaser. And why shouldn&#x27;t it?&quot; James Kendrick of the &quot;Q Network&quot; wrote that &quot;Williamson&#x27;s characters are all generic types; but they&#x27;re still believable as people, and they react realistically according to the situations.&quot; Kendrick added that the film was &quot;head and shoulders above earlier &#x27;dead teenager&#x27; movies&quot;.

&quot;TV Guide&quot;″s Maitland McDonagh awarded the movie two out of five stars, noting: &quot;Screenwriter Kevin Williamson takes a step backward and writes the kind of movie &quot;Scream&quot; mocks. You can see him now, soaking up videos of &quot;Friday the 13th&quot; and &quot;Halloween&quot;—not to mention the lesser likes of &quot;He Knows You&#x27;re Alone&quot;, &quot;Terror Train&quot; and &quot;My Bloody Valentine&quot;—and saying, &#x27;I can do that!&#x27; And boy, does he ever.&quot;

Critic James Berardinelli credited both &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; and &quot;Scream&quot; with igniting a new boom of slasher films, adding: &quot;There is one minor aspect of the plot that elevates &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; above the level of a typical &#x27;80s slasher flick -- it has an interesting subtext. I&#x27;m referring to the way the lives and friendships of these four individuals crumble in the wake of their accident. Guilt, confusion and doubt build in them until they can no longer stand to be with each other or look at themselves in the mirror. Sadly, this potentially-fascinating element of the movie is dismissed quickly to facilitate a higher body count. And, as I said before, a few extra deaths can only make a slasher movie better, right?&quot;

Movie historian Leonard Maltin gave the film 2 out of a possible 4 stars; he described it as &quot;...Too routine to succeed overall...Despite being based on a young-adult novel, this is absolutely not for kids. Still, it&#x27;s a classic compared to the sequel.&quot;

Motion picture scholar Adam Rockoff notes in his book &quot;Going to Pieces: The Rise and Fall of the Slasher Film, 1978–1986&quot; that, at the time of its release, many critics branded &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; as an imitation of &quot;Scream&quot;. However, he contends that it is a &quot;much different film&quot;, despite both screenplays being penned by the same writer:

Lois Duncan, the author of the original novel, heavily criticized the film adaptation; she stated in a 2002 interview she was &quot;appalled&quot; that her story was turned into a slasher film.

===Accolades===
== Sequels ==

A sequel titled &quot;I Still Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; was released in 1998, with a direct-to-video film, &quot;I&#x27;ll Always Know What You Did Last Summer&quot;, released in 2006. In the first sequel, Love Hewitt, Prinze Jr. and Watson reprised their roles. The third film has very little relation to the first two, other than the premise, the villain and the producers. It featured new characters and a different setting.

In February 2023, a legacy sequel was announced to be in development with Jennifer Love Hewitt and Freddie Prinze Jr. in negotiations to reprise their respective roles. Jennifer Kaytin Robinson was selected to direct the film from a script written by Leah McKendrick, based on an idea by Robinson and McKendrick. Neal H. Moritz would serve as producer. The plot is said to be similar in approach to &quot;Scream&quot; (2022), in which characters from the original film are included in a story featuring a younger cast. The film is scheduled to be released on July 18, 2025.

=== Remakes ===
This film was unofficially remade in India by Anil V. Kumar as &quot;Kucch To Hai&quot; (2003), starring Tusshar Kapoor. However, in an interview to &quot;Hindustan Times&quot;, Kapoor denied that the makers of his film copied this particular film.

In September 2014, Sony Pictures revealed plans to remake the film, with Mike Flanagan and Jeff Howard writing the script. The film was a high priority and was initially set for release in 2016. Further, the new direction and scope of the film would need an estimated budget of $15–20million. Flanagan confirmed that this new iteration of the franchise would not include elements of the 1973 novel (the antagonist being a central character) nor of the 1997 feature film (fisherman Ben Willis and the four protagonists Julie James, Helen Shivers, Barry Cox and Ray Bronson). The project was ultimately never made and was subsequently canceled.

=== Television adaptation ===

A television series adaptation of the novel was released in October 2021, with Neal H. Moritz and James Wan producing and Shay Hatten writing the pilot. Amazon ordered a straight-to-series order in October 2020.

== In popular culture ==
The &quot;Dawson&#x27;s Creek&quot; season one episode &quot;The Scare&quot; spoofs &quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; alongside &quot;Scream&quot;, all written by Williamson. The episode opens with the characters Dawson and Joey viewing the former.

&quot;I Know What You Did Last Summer&quot; has been referenced in various films and television series, and its central plot was parodied at length in the spoof films &quot;Scary Movie&quot; (2000) and &quot;Shriek If You Know What I Did Last Friday the 13th&quot; (2000).

The teen drama &quot;Popular&quot; spoofed the film in the season two episode &quot;I Know What You Did Last Spring Break.&quot;

It was also spoofed by Anthony Horowitz in the Diamond Brothers novella, I Know What You Did Last Wednesday (2002) and later in &quot;The Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Treehouse of Horror X&quot; as &quot;I Know What You Diddily-Iddily-Did&quot;, with Ned Flanders as the killer.

<doc id="255051" wikidata="Q2011881" url="?curid=255051" title="Destructive testing">
<text>In destructive testing (or destructive physical analysis, DPA) tests are carried out to the specimen&#x27;s failure, in order to understand a specimen&#x27;s performance or material behavior under different loads. These tests are generally much easier to carry out, yield more information, and are easier to interpret than nondestructive testing. 

==Applications==
Destructive testing is most suitable, and economic, for objects which will be mass-produced, as the cost of destroying a small number of specimens is negligible. It is usually not economical to do destructive testing where only one or very few items are to be produced (for example, in the case of a building). 

==Analyzing and documenting destructive failure mode==
Analyzing and documenting the destructive failure mode is often accomplished using a high-speed camera recording continuously (movie-loop) until the failure is detected. Detecting the failure can be accomplished using a sound detector or stress gauge which produces a signal to trigger the high-speed camera. These high-speed cameras have advanced recording modes to capture almost any type of destructive failure. After the failure the high-speed camera will stop recording. The captured images can be played back in slow motion showing precisely what happens before, during and after the destructive event, image by image.

==Methods and techniques==

===Testing of large structures===

Building structures or large nonbuilding structures (such as dams and bridges) are rarely subjected to destructive testing due to the prohibitive cost of constructing a building, or a scale model of a building, just to destroy it.

Earthquake engineering requires a good understanding of how structures will perform at earthquakes. Destructive tests are more frequently carried out for structures which are to be constructed in earthquake zones. Such tests are sometimes referred to as &quot;crash tests&quot;, and they are carried out to verify the designed seismic performance of a new building, or the actual performance of an existing building. The tests are, mostly, carried out on a platform called a shake-table which is designed to shake in the same manner as an earthquake. Results of those tests often include the corresponding shake-table videos.

Testing of structures in earthquakes is increasingly done by modelling the structure using specialist finite element software.

===Software testing===

Destructive software testing is a type of software testing which attempts to cause a piece of software to fail in an uncontrolled manner, in order to test its robustness and to help establish range limits, within which the software will operate in a stable and reliable manner.

==Automotive testing==

Automobiles are subject to crash testing by both automobile manufacturers and a variety of agencies.
Individual manufacturers also carry out sample testing to verify non destructive line side tests, usually by means of ultrasonic inspection.

==Aircraft testing==
There has also been extensive destructive testing of passenger and military aircraft, conducted by aircraft manufacturers and organizations like NASA. The 2012 Boeing 727 crash experiment was conducted and filmed by the Discovery channel. It is now standard procedure to test to destruction the first few production models of new airplanes by loading various components until they fail. The 1951 movie, No Highway in the Sky starring James Stewart and Marlene Dietrich told the story of an eccentric engineer who pioneered research into destructive testing of complete components against a great deal of skepticism.

== Material testing and process ==
After a material is formed, various processes can be used to measure its strength, dexterity, durability, and other important properties. Some of these testing methods are commonly used in engineering to determine whether a material is suitable for a project or if an alternative needs to be considered.

Material testing can involve stretching and pulling a sample to assess its elasticity, and how well it retains its shape after being deformed. This helps determine whether the material can return to its original form before sustaining major damage. Additionally, these tests evaluate how well a material withstands rigorous conditions before breaking, providing insights into its overall strength and hardness.

Material testing can also involve using electricity to evaluate different metal types for conductivity, overheating resistance, and durability under electrical strain. This information is crucial for determining which materials are suitable for electrical poles and systems, ensuring both efficiency and worker safety.

<doc id="255054" wikidata="Q7275611" url="?curid=255054" title="RAF Strike Command">
<text>The Royal Air Force&#x27;s Strike Command was the military formation which controlled the majority of the United Kingdom&#x27;s bomber and fighter aircraft from 1968 until 2007 when it merged with Personnel and Training Command to form the single Air Command. It latterly consisted of two formations – No. 1 Group RAF and No. 2 Group RAF. The last Commander-in-Chief was Air Chief Marshal Sir Joe French.

==History==
Strike Command was formed on 30 April 1968 by the merger of Bomber Command and Fighter Command, which became No. 1 Group and No. 11 Group respectively. Signals Command was absorbed on 1 January 1969, Coastal Command was absorbed on 28 November 1969, becoming No. 18 Group RAF. The former component Coastal Command groups became the Northern Maritime Air Region and Southern Maritime Air Region. Air Support Command (formerly Transport Command) was absorbed on 1 September 1972, becoming No. 46 Group RAF.

=== NATO Role ===
In 1975, the Command doubled as NATO, Commander-in-Chief United Kingdom Air Forces (UKAIR). UKAIR fell under NATO&#x27;s Allied Command Europe in Mons in Belgium. In case of war with the Warsaw Pact the command would have commanded all Royal Air Force units in the United Kingdom as well as the US Air Force&#x27;s Third Air Force based at RAF Mildenhall with its subordinate wings and squadrons. Reinforcements coming from the continental United States, as well as units transitioning to other European fronts, would have also come under UKAIR.

=== Post Cold War ===
RAF Germany was absorbed as No. 2 (Bomber) Group on 1 April 1993. As of 1 April 2000, the structure was altered to leave No. 1 Group with tactical fast jet forces, No. 2 Group with air transport, air refueling, and reconnaissance, the RAF Regiment, and No. 32 (The Royal) Squadron RAF. No. 3 Group was to include Nimrod long-range Maritime Patrol aircraft, Search and rescue helicopters, and the Joint Force 2000, later to become Joint Force Harrier. Flag Officer Naval Aviation moved over to command No. 3 Group, the first incumbent becoming Rear Admiral Iain Henderson. &quot;At the core of the structure [were] to be the central air staffs, responsible to Deputy Chief of Staff Operations for air power, ongoing operations, joint training, and force development.&quot; The Air Warfare Centre at Waddington and the Military Air Traffic Organisation at Uxbridge also joined Strike Command.

The RAF&#x27;s Process and Organisation Review concluded that Strike Command and Personnel and Training Command should be co-located at a single command headquarters: it was subsequently decided that both commands should be located at High Wycombe and in 2007 Strike Command and Personnel and Training Command were merged into a single command – Air Command.

==Structure==
Headquarters Strike Command (often abbreviated to HQSTC) was located at RAF High Wycombe in Buckinghamshire. The Command was divided into a number of Groups, which at first reflected the function of the old Fighter, Bomber and Coastal Command. Subsequent reorganisations changed things greatly and before the final reorganization, the two Groups which made up Strike Command were:

*No. 1 Group RAF – the &quot;Air Combat Group&quot;
*No. 2 Group RAF – the &quot;Air Combat Support Group&quot;

Component groups of Strike Command included:

* No. 1 Group RAF 1 April 1968 – 1 April 2007
* No. 2 Group RAF 1 April 1993 – 1 April 1996, 7 January 2000 – 1 April 2007
* No. 3 Group RAF 1 April 2000 – 1 April 2006
* No. 11 Group RAF 1 April 1968 – 1 April 1996
* No. 18 Group RAF 28 November 1969 – 1 April 1996
* No. 11/18 Group RAF 1 April 1996 – 7 January 2000
* No. 38 Group RAF 1 July 1972 – 17 November 1983
* No. 46 Group RAF 1 September 1972 – 1 January 1976
* No. 90 Group RAF 1 January 1969 – 1 September 1972
* Royal Observer Corps 1 April 1968 – 31 December 1995

<doc id="255059" wikidata="Q3518150" url="?curid=255059" title="Tensor (intrinsic definition)">
<text>In mathematics, the modern component-free approach to the theory of a tensor views a tensor as an abstract object, expressing some definite type of multilinear concept. Their properties can be derived from their definitions, as linear maps or more generally; and the rules for manipulations of tensors arise as an extension of linear algebra to multilinear algebra.

In differential geometry, an intrinsic geometric statement may be described by a tensor field on a manifold, and then doesn&#x27;t need to make reference to coordinates at all. The same is true in general relativity, of tensor fields describing a physical property. The component-free approach is also used extensively in abstract algebra and homological algebra, where tensors arise naturally.

==Definition via tensor products of vector spaces==
Given a finite set of vector spaces over a common field , one may form their tensor product , an element of which is termed a tensor.

A tensor on the vector space is then defined to be an element of (i.e., a vector in) a vector space of the form:
formula_1
where is the dual space of .

If there are copies of and copies of in our product, the tensor is said to be of and contravariant of order and covariant of order and of total order . The tensors of order zero are just the scalars (elements of the field ), those of contravariant order 1 are the vectors in , and those of covariant order 1 are the one-forms in (for this reason, the elements of the last two spaces are often called the contravariant and covariant vectors). The space of all tensors of type is denoted
formula_2

Example 1. The space of type tensors, formula_3 is isomorphic in a natural way to the space of linear transformations from to . 

Example 2. A bilinear form on a real vector space , formula_4 corresponds in a natural way to a type tensor in formula_5 An example of such a bilinear form may be defined, termed the associated &quot;metric tensor&quot;, and is usually denoted .

==Tensor rank==
A simple tensor (also called a tensor of rank one, elementary tensor or decomposable tensor) is a tensor that can be written as a product of tensors of the form
formula_6
where are nonzero and in or – that is, if the tensor is nonzero and completely factorizable. Every tensor can be expressed as a sum of simple tensors. The rank of a tensor is the minimum number of simple tensors that sum to .

The zero tensor has rank zero. A nonzero order 0 or 1 tensor always has rank 1. The rank of a non-zero order 2 or higher tensor is less than or equal to the product of the dimensions of all but the highest-dimensioned vectors in (a sum of products of) which the tensor can be expressed, which is when each product is of vectors from a finite-dimensional vector space of dimension .

The term &quot;rank of a tensor&quot; extends the notion of the rank of a matrix in linear algebra, although the term is also often used to mean the order (or degree) of a tensor. The rank of a matrix is the minimum number of column vectors needed to span the range of the matrix. A matrix thus has rank one if it can be written as an outer product of two nonzero vectors:
formula_7

The rank of a matrix is the smallest number of such outer products that can be summed to produce it:
formula_8

In indices, a tensor of rank 1 is a tensor of the form
formula_9

The rank of a tensor of order 2 agrees with the rank when the tensor is regarded as a matrix, and can be determined from Gaussian elimination for instance. The rank of an order 3 or higher tensor is however often to determine, and low rank decompositions of tensors are sometimes of great practical interest. In fact, the problem of finding the rank of an order 3 tensor over any finite field is NP-Complete, and over the rationals, is NP-Hard. Computational tasks such as the efficient multiplication of matrices and the efficient evaluation of polynomials can be recast as the problem of simultaneously evaluating a set of bilinear forms
formula_10
for given inputs and . If a low-rank decomposition of the tensor is known, then an efficient evaluation strategy is known.

==Universal property==
The space formula_11 can be characterized by a universal property in terms of multilinear mappings. Amongst the advantages of this approach are that it gives a way to show that many linear mappings are &quot;natural&quot; or &quot;geometric&quot; (in other words are independent of any choice of basis). Explicit computational information can then be written down using bases, and this order of priorities can be more convenient than proving a formula gives rise to a natural mapping. Another aspect is that tensor products are not used only for free modules, and the &quot;universal&quot; approach carries over more easily to more general situations.

A scalar-valued function on a Cartesian product (or direct sum) of vector spaces
formula_12
is multilinear if it is linear in each argument. The space of all multilinear mappings from to is denoted . When , a multilinear mapping is just an ordinary linear mapping, and the space of all linear mappings from to is denoted .

The universal characterization of the tensor product implies that, for each multilinear function
formula_13
(where can represent the field of scalars, a vector space, or a tensor space) there exists a unique linear function
formula_14
such that
formula_15
for all in and in .

Using the universal property, it follows, when is finite dimensional, that the space of -tensors admits a natural isomorphism
formula_16

Each in the definition of the tensor corresponds to a inside the argument of the linear maps, and vice versa. (Note that in the former case, there are copies of and copies of , and in the latter case vice versa). In particular, one has
formula_17

==Tensor fields==
Differential geometry, physics and engineering must often deal with tensor fields on smooth manifolds. The term &quot;tensor&quot; is sometimes used as a shorthand for &quot;tensor field&quot;. A tensor field expresses the concept of a tensor that varies from point to point on the manifold.

<text>A guide is a person who leads travelers, sportspeople, or tourists through unknown or unfamiliar locations. The term can also be applied to a person who leads others to more abstract goals such as knowledge or wisdom.

==Travel and recreation==
Explorers in the past venturing into territory unknown by their own people invariably hired guides. Military explorers Lewis and Clark were hired by the United States Congress to explore the Pacific Northwest. They in turn hired the better qualified Native American Sacagawea to help them. Wilfred Thesiger hired guides in the deserts that he ventured into, such as Kuri on his journey to the Tibesti Mountains in 1938.

===Tour guide===
Tour guides lead visitors through tourist attractions and give information about the attractions&#x27; natural and cultural significance. Often, they also act as interpreters for travelers who do not speak the local language. Automated systems like audio tours are sometimes substituted for human tour guides. Tour operators often hire guides to lead tourist groups.

===Mountain guide===

Mountain guides are those employed in mountaineering; these are not merely to show the way but stand in the position of professional climbers with an expert knowledge of rock and snowcraft, which they impart to the amateur, at the same time assuring the safety of the climbing party. This professional class of guides arose in the middle of the 19th century when Alpine climbing became recognized as a sport.

In Switzerland, the central committee of the Swiss Alpine Club issues a guides’ tariff which fixes the charges for guides and porters; there are three sections, for the Valais and Vaudois Alps, for the Bernese Oberland, and for central and eastern Switzerland.

In Chamonix (France) a statue has been raised to Jacques Balmat, who was the first to climb Mont Blanc in 1786. Other notable European guides are Christian Almer, Jakob and Melchior Anderegg, Klemens Bachleda, Auguste Balmat, Alexander Burgener, Armand Charlet, Michel Croz, François Devouassoud, Angelo Dibona, Andreas Heckmair, the Innerkofler family, Conrad Kain, Christian Klucker, and Matthias Zurbriggen.

===Wilderness guide===
A wilderness guide leads paid parties through back country areas that may variously include land, water bodies, and high country — but not so high and technical as to require the skills of a mountain guide. Wilderness guides in the United States are historically and romantically particularly associated with the Adirondack Mountains of New York State, where they first established the application of their skills as a broadly accepted and financially compensated trade.

Wilderness guides are expected to have a command of survival skills (such as making shelters, fire-making, navigation, and first aid) and an understanding of the ecology and history of the location where they guide. Other common skills among guides include traditional handicrafts and cooking methods, fishing, hunting, bird watching, and nature conservation.

Wilderness tours usually take place on foot, though aids such as skis and snowshoes, and conveyances such as canoes, kayaks, sledges, pack animals, and snowmobiles are utilized as appropriate.

===Hunting guide===
Hunting guides are employed by those seeking to hunt wildlife, especially big game animals in the wild. European hunting guides working in Africa are sometimes called white hunters, although the term is most commonly used in the context of the early 20th century.

===Safari guide===
Guides are employed on safari, today usually just to observe and photograph wildlife, historically for big-game hunting. Safari guides are either self-employed or work for or through a guide service. There are no set qualifications or universal licensing procedures; customs and requirements vary by location. In lieu, many guides choose to belong to a professional association. These are typically linked to specific countries and are governed by their laws and policies. Associations such as &quot;The Field Guides Association of Southern Africa (FGASA)&quot; and &quot;Uganda Safari Guides Association (USAGA)&quot; play an important role in training and educating safari guides to improve their knowledge and group safety. Many famed safari guides are found on the list of famous big-game hunters.

===Fishing guide===

Fishing guides have a long history. Their work spans from aiding fly fishing in small brooks or lakes to deep saltwater big game fishing. Some areas where fishing guides are popular include the Norwegian coast, Swedish archipelago, the Florida coast, and various parts of Canada. The vernacular terms &quot;fishing charter&quot; or &quot;charter boat&quot; imply the services of a guide, whether the vessel&#x27;s captain, a qualified hand, or experienced sportsman.

===River guide===
River guides lead clients on day trips and overnight expeditions on rivers. They are expected to identify and navigate river features effectively in their watercraft of choice. A wide variety of watercraft are used, including inflatable rafts, canoes, inflatable and hard-shell kayaks, stand-up paddleboards, drift boats, and jet boats. Guides who routinely work on or around fast moving water practice swift water rescue techniques, and employ them when necessary. Some river guides offer other services, such as fishing and wildlife viewing.

==Military guides==
Historically in areas where detailed maps were unavailable, guides with local knowledge were employed for scouting and advance leadership during military operations. In 18th century Europe, the stricter organization of military resources led in various countries to the special training of guide officers who had the primary duty of finding, and if necessary establishing, routes for military units.

===Guides regiments===
The genesis of the &quot;guides&quot; regiments may be found in a short-lived Corps of Guides formed by Napoleon in Italy in 1796, which appears to have been a personal escort or bodyguard composed of men who knew the country. Following the unification of Italy in 1860, the new national army included a cavalry regiment designated: Guides Regiment.

In the Belgian Army the two guides regiments, created respectively in 1833 and 1874, constituted part of the light cavalry and came to correspond to the guard cavalry of other nations. Until the outbreak of World War I, they wore a distinctive uniform comprising a plumed busby, green dolman braided in yellow, and crimson breeches. Mechanised in October 1937, both regiments formed armored battalions in the post World War II Belgian Army. Following a series of amalgamations the Belgian guides ceased to exist in 2011.

In the Swiss army prior to 1914, the squadrons of guides acted as divisional cavalry. In this role these light cavalry units were called upon, on occasion, to lead columns and provide scouts.

The Corps of Guides of the British Indian Army consisted of a unique combination of infantry companies and cavalry squadrons. After World War I the infantry element was incorporated in the 12th Frontier Force Regiment and the Guides Cavalry formed a separate regiment - the 10th Queen Victoria&#x27;s Own Corps of Guides Cavalry (Frontier Force). This unit still exists as the 2nd (Guides) Battalion of the Frontier Force Regiment of the modern Army of Pakistan.

In drill, a &quot;guide&quot; is an officer or non-commissioned officer who regulates the direction and pace of movements.

==Metaphysics==

===Trip sitter===
A psychedelic guide is someone who guides a drug user&#x27;s experiences as opposed to a sitter who merely remains present, ready to discourage bad trips and handle emergencies but not otherwise getting involved. Guides are more common amongst spiritual users of entheogens. Psychedelic guides were strongly encouraged by Timothy Leary and the other authors of &quot;The Psychedelic Experience: A Guide Based on the Tibetan Book of the Dead&quot;. Trip sitters are also mentioned in the Responsible Drug User&#x27;s Oath.

===Guided meditation===

===In Islam===

In Islam &quot;ar-Rashid&quot;, one of the 99 Names of God, means &quot;the Guide&quot;. From this is derived the common Arabic name Rashid.

<text>Filipendula ulmaria, commonly known as meadowsweet or mead wort, is a perennial herbaceous plant in the family Rosaceae that grows in damp meadows. It is native throughout most of Europe and Western Asia (Near East and Middle East). It has been introduced and naturalised in North America.

Meadowsweet has also been referred to as queen of the meadow, pride of the meadow, meadow-wort, meadow queen, lady of the meadow, dollof, meadsweet, and bridewort.

==Description==

The stems, growing to tall, erect and furrowed, reddish to sometimes purple. The leaves are dark-green on the upper side and whitish and downy underneath, much divided, interruptedly pinnate, having a few large serrate leaflets and small intermediate ones. Terminal leaflets are large, 4–8 cm long, and three- to five-lobed.

Meadowsweet has delicate, graceful, creamy-white flowers clustered close together in irregularly-branched cymes, having a very strong, sweet smell redolent of antiseptic. They flower from early summer to early autumn and are visited by various types of insects, in particular &quot;Musca&quot; flies.

The flowers are small and numerous, they show 5 sepals and 5 petals with 7 to 20 stamens.

== Names ==
The English common name meadowsweet dates from the 16th century. It did not originally mean &#x27;sweet plant of the meadow&#x27;, but a plant used for sweetening or flavouring mead. An earlier common name dating from the 15th century was &#x27;meadsweet&#x27;.

Meadowsweet is known by many other names. In Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;The Knight&#x27;s Tale&quot; it is known as meadwort and was one of the ingredients in a drink called &quot;save&quot;. It was also known as bridewort, because it was strewn in churches for festivals and weddings, and often made into bridal garlands. In Europe, it took its name &quot;queen of the meadow&quot; for the way it can dominate a low-lying, damp meadow.

The specific epithet ulmaria means &quot;elmlike&quot;, possibly in reference to its individual leaves which resemble those of the elm (&quot;Ulmus&quot;). The generic name, &quot;Filipendula&quot;, comes from &quot;filum&quot;, meaning &quot;thread&quot; and &quot;pendulus&quot;, meaning &quot;hanging&quot;. This is said to describe the slender attachment of root tubers, which hang characteristically on the genus, on fibrous roots.

=== Synonyms ===
&quot;Filipendula denudata&quot; 

== Distribution and habitat ==
Meadowsweet is common throughout the British Isles in damp areas and is dominant in fens and wet woods.

&quot;Juncus subnodulosus&quot;-&quot;Cirsium palustre&quot; fen-meadow and purple moor grass and rush pastures BAP habitat plant associations of Western Europe consistently include this plant.

== Diseases ==
Many insects and fungi cause disease in meadowsweet.
 Meadowsweet leaves are commonly galled by the bright orange-rust fungus &quot;Triphragmium ulmariae&quot;, which creates swellings and distortions on the stalk and/or midrib.

The fungus &quot;Ramularia ulmariae&quot; causes purple blotches on the leaves.

The fungus &quot;Podosphaera filipendulae&quot; causes mildew on the leaves and flower heads, coating them with a white powder.

The midge &quot;Dasineura ulmaria&quot; causes pinkish-white galls on the leaves that can distort the leaf surface.

==Uses==
The whole herb possesses a pleasant taste and flavour, the green parts having a similar aromatic character to the flowers, hence the use of the plant as a strewing herb, strewn on floors to give the rooms a pleasant aroma, and its use to flavour vinegar, wine, and beer. The flowers can be added to stewed fruit and jams, giving them a subtle almond flavour. Some foragers also use the flowers to flavour desserts such as panna cotta. It has many medicinal properties. The whole plant is a traditional remedy for an acidic stomach. The dried flowers are used in potpourri. It is also a frequently used spice in Scandinavian varieties of mead.

Chemical constituents include salicin, flavone glycosides, essential oils, and tannins. In 1838, Raffaele Piria obtained salicylic acid from the buds of meadowsweet. Thereafter in 1899, scientists at the firm Bayer used salicylic acid derived from meadowsweet to synthesise acetylsalicylic acid (aspirin), which was named after the old botanical name for meadowsweet, &quot;Spiraea ulmaria&quot;. The name then became aspirin.

A natural black dye can be obtained from the roots by using a copper mordant.

A tea made from &quot;Filipendula ulmaria&quot; flowers or leaves has been used in traditional Austrian herbal medicine for the treatment of rheumatism, gout, infections, and fever.

==In culture==
White-flowered meadowsweet has been found with the cremated remains of three people and at least one animal in a Bronze Age cairn at Fan Foel, Carmarthenshire. Similar finds have also been found inside a beaker from Ashgrove, Fife, and a vessel from North Mains, Strathallan. These could indicate mead or flavoured ale, or might suggest that the plant was placed on the grave as a scented flower.

In Welsh mythology, Gwydion and Math created a woman out of oak blossom, broom, and meadowsweet and named her Blodeuwedd (&quot;flower face&quot;).

In the 16th century, when it was customary to strew floors with rushes and herbs (both to give warmth underfoot and to overcome smells and infections), it was a favorite of Elizabeth I of England. She desired it above all other herbs in her chambers.

<text>The Somoza family () is a political family which ruled Nicaragua for forty-three years – from 1936 to 1979. Their family dictatorship, founded by Anastasio Somoza García, was continued by his two sons Luis Somoza Debayle and Anastasio Somoza Debayle. Anastasio Somoza García served as the President of Nicaragua from 1937 until 1956. He was succeeded by his elder son, Luis Somoza Debayle, who held the presidency from 1957 to 1963. The younger Somoza son, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, had two presidential terms: 1967–1972 and 1974–1979. Although the Somozas did not hold the presidency for the full forty-three years, they continued to rule through puppet presidents and via their control of the National Guard.

While the Somoza family moved towards modernizing Nicaragua, their rule featured repression and inequality. Over four decades, the Somoza family accumulated wealth through corporate bribes, land-grabbing and foreign-aid siphoning. The family received support from the government of the United States, and the leadership styles of each Somoza president was different from one another.

Ultimately, the Somoza family was overthrown by the socialist Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) during the Nicaraguan Revolution of 1961–1990. Widespread discontent with the Somoza regime emerged following the Managua earthquake of 1972. Anastasio Somoza Debayle declared himself the Head of the National Emergency Committee and used his power to participate in looting and in the mismanagement of international-aid funding. Discomfort increased in the light of the rise of the Sandinista National Liberation Front and in response to the Somoza government&#x27;s human-rights violations. Various opposition groups emerged, and two key approaches to overthrow the dictatorship became clear. While the Broad Opposition Front (, FAO) attempted to reach a solution via negotiation, the FSLN pushed insurrection. When negotiations failed, the insurrection movement, with military support from the Soviet Union through Cuba, launched a successful offensive into the cities, with human rights violations committed by the National Guard resulting in the Somoza government&#x27;s international, political and military isolation. On 17 July 1979, Anastasio Somoza Debayle resigned as President of Nicaragua, marking the end of the Somoza-family dictatorship.

The family accumulated wealth through corporate bribes, industrial monopolies, land grabbing, and foreign aid siphoning. By the 1970s, the family owned around 23 percent of the land in Nicaragua. The Somoza&#x27;s wealth is speculated to have reached approximately $533 million, which amounted to half of Nicaragua&#x27;s debt and 33 percent of the country&#x27;s 1979 GDP.

Three of the Somoza family members served as President of Nicaragua. They were:

* Anastasio Somoza García &quot;Tacho&quot; (1896–1956; President 1937–1947, 1950–1956), the father.
* Luis Somoza Debayle (1922–1967, President 1956–1963), his eldest legitimate son.
* Anastasio Somoza Debayle &quot;Tachito&quot; (1925–1980, President 1967–1972, 1974–1979), his second legitimate son.

Other members of the Somoza family include:

* José R. Somoza, the half-brother of Anastasio Somoza Debayle
* Hope Portocarrero, the wife of Anastasio Somoza Debayle
* Lillian Somoza de Sevilla Sacasa, the daughter of Anastasio Somoza García
* Isabel Urcuyo (1924–2014), the wife of Luis Somoza Debayle
* Anastasio Somoza Portocarrero, a son of Anastasio Somoza Debayle and his wife
* Carolina Somoza Portocarrero, a daughter of Anastasio Somoza Debayle and his wife, who is married to James Minskoff Sterling, son of New York real estate developer Henry H. Minskoff
* Martha Debayle, a niece of Anastasio Somoza Debayle, Nicaraguan Mexican radio hostess and entrepreneur
* Anastasia Somoza, American disability rights advocate and granddaughter of Luis Somoza Debayle

==Anastasio Somoza García==
Anastasio Somoza García (1 February 1896 – 29 September 1956) was the founder of the Somoza dictatorship. He was born into a wealthy coffee planter family as the son of senator Anastasio Somoza Reyes and Julia García. He was educated at the Instituto Nacional de Oriente and the Pierce School of Business Administration in Philadelphia. During his time in the United States, he learned the English language and met his wife Salvadora Debayle Sacasa, the daughter of a wealthy and politically connected family.

After returning to Nicaragua, Anastasio Somoza García joined the Liberal revolt in 1926. He worked as an interpreter during peace talks between the United States and the Nicaraguan factions, improving his reputation among United States officials. When José María Moncada assumed the presidency in 1929, Somoza served as the governor of León, the Consul to Costa Rica, the Minister of Foreign Affairs, and Moncada&#x27;s personal aide. When the United States Marines organized the Nicaraguan National Guard, Somoza became an officer and later an assistant to the Commander. Following the departure of the U.S. Marines in 1933, Somoza became the Head of the National Guard.

In 1936, Anastasio Somoza García executed a military coup. Leveraging his control of the National Guard, he overthrew President Juan Bautista Sacasa and replaced him with his own candidate for Acting President, Carlos Brenes Jarquín. Somoza was nominated for the presidency a week later at a Liberal Party convention on 16 June 1936 and was inaugurated into office on 1 January 1937.

Anastasio Somoza García was the President of Nicaragua for the next nineteen years. He occupied the presidency directly for most of this period, only occasionally ruling through puppets. To maintain support from the National Guard, he put family members and close friends in positions of power. He fostered the support of the United States, with his regime backing U.S. foreign policy. He pursued economic developmentalism and sought to modernize Nicaragua. Somoza&#x27;s policies focused on growing exports, as well as creating economic infrastructure and public agencies. These policies did little for the common citizen, but benefited Somoza&#x27;s fortune significantly.

Anastasio Somoza García was assassinated in 1956. He was shot by poet Rigoberto López Pérez and died several days later on 29 September 1956.

==Luis Somoza Debayle==
Luis Somoza Debayle (18 November 1922 – 13 April 1967) was the eldest son of Anastasio Somoza García. He was born in León, Nicaragua and received an American education at Saint Leo College Prep School, La Salle Military Academy and Louisiana State University. He became a captain in the National Guard by the age of eighteen and entered Congress by 1950. By 1956 he became the President of Congress, constitutionally empowering him to fill the Presidency in the instance of an unexpected vacancy. Upon his father&#x27;s assassination in 1956, Luis Somoza Debayle became the Acting President of Nicaragua. He was formally elected to the presidency through fraudulent elections in 1957, making him the 26th President of Nicaragua.

Luis Somoza Debayle&#x27;s presidential term made attempts at modernisation and political liberalisation. In 1959, he restored the constitutional ban on immediate re-election and presidential succession by relatives. This prevented his younger brother, Anastasio Somoza Debayle, from running in the 1963 presidential election. In 1960, Nicaragua established the Central American Common Market alongside El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras. This improved Nicaragua&#x27;s Central American relations and led to rapid growth of the Nicaraguan economy. Luis maintained his father&#x27;s favourability to the United States. Luis&#x27; government condemned the Cuban Revolution and played a leading role in the failed Bay of Pigs Invasion in 1961. He put in place numerous socio-economic reforms in public housing, education, social security and agrarian reform, closely coinciding with the United States’ Alliance for Progress initiative. While these policies created jobs, they further enriched the privileged and had limited benefit for impoverished Nicaraguans.

Luis Somoza Debayle&#x27;s presidential term ended in 1963. Between 1963 and 1967, he ruled through puppet presidents. René Schick won the 1963 presidential election and ruled until his death in 1966. He was succeeded by Lorenzo Guerrero. Luis Somoza Debayle died of a heart attack in 1967.

==Anastasio Somoza Debayle==
Anastasio Somoza Debayle (5 December 1925 – 17 September 1980) was the youngest son of Anastasio Somoza García. He received an American education at West Point and was the Head of the National Guard from 1955.

Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s first presidential term was from 1967 to 1972. His leadership differed from his older brother&#x27;s and marked a return to his father&#x27;s harsher style of personalist dictatorship. He relied on military power and exercised no restraint in using public office for personal enrichment. He encouraged corruption and protected his officers from prosecution. He developed a reputation as a human rights violator and replaced his brother&#x27;s skilled administrators with unqualified political allies. By the 1970s, the government was becoming corrupt and inefficient.

While his first term was meant to expire in 1971, Anastasio Somoza Debayle amended the re-election ban in the constitution, allowing him to serve as president for an additional year. Somoza ruled through puppets in the period between his first and second presidential terms. He organised a pact with Fernando Agüero, the leader of the Conservative party, whereby he would transfer power to a triumvirate. Under the arrangement, the triumvirate would rule temporarily while an election was held, and a new constitution was written. When the transfer took place in 1972, Somoza returned to his role as the Head of the National Guard. He was later re-elected as president in 1974.

The downfall of the Somoza dictatorship coincided with Anastasio Somoza Debayle&#x27;s second presidential term. He resigned as president in July 1979 and was assassinated in September 1980.

==Downfall==
===Managua earthquake, 1972===

On 23 December 1972, an earthquake devastated the Nicaraguan capital city of Managua. The earthquake killed 10,000 people, left many homeless and caused widespread infrastructural damage. Although he was not president at the time, Anastasio Somoza Debayle quickly established the National Emergency Committee of which he was the head. This put him in the position to allocate relief funds, which he did in a corrupt and self-serving manner. International aid enriched the Somoza family instead of reaching victims. Emergency housing funds received from the United States Agency for International Development went disproportionately into the construction of luxury housing for National Guard officers, with the homeless provided hastily constructed wooden shacks. Furthermore, as Head of the National Guard, Somoza allowed the National Guard to participate in the looting of the remaining business establishments, purchasing land and industries that would figure lucratively in the reconstruction. The promised reconstruction of the city never took place with reconstruction of roads, drainage systems and public transportation grossly mishandled.

It was at this point that open expressions of discontent with the Somoza regime began to surface. In particular, the Somoza government began to lose the support from Nicaragua&#x27;s economic elite. As a result, the business community began financially supporting the FSLN, an opposition group.

===Rise of the FSLN===

In 1961, the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN) was formally organised. The FSLN began as a group of Marxist, antigovernment student activists at the National Autonomous University of Nicaragua in the late 1950s. By the early 1970s, the group had gained enough support to launch limited military initiatives.

On 27 December 1974, a group of FSLN guerrillas seized the home of former government official, José Maria Castillo, and held a group of leading Nicaraguan officials hostage, many of whom were Somoza relatives. The FSLN made their demands known and an agreement was made between the Somoza government and the guerrillas on 30 December 1974. As a result, the guerrillas received a US$1 million ransom and had a FSLN declaration read over the radio and printed in &quot;La Prensa&quot;. Furthermore, the guerrillas negotiated the release and transportation of fourteen FSLN prisoners to Cuba along with themselves. The success of the operation saw the FSLN&#x27;s prestige soar and damaged perceptions of the Somoza regime.

===Human rights violations===
Anastasio Somoza Debayle responded to the increasing opposition brought about by the FSLN by imposing a state of siege and censoring the press. During this time, the National Guard engaged in widespread torture, rape, arbitrary imprisonment and execution of opponents and peasants. These human rights violations led to national and international condemnation of the Somoza regime and built support for the FSLN.

In 1977, the Jimmy Carter administration made United States military assistance conditional on improvements to human rights. This, accompanied by condemnation, led Somoza to lift the state of siege and reinstated freedom of the press in September 1977.

===Growing opposition===
Reinstated freedoms allowed newspapers to cover opposition activities and the rights violations of the Somoza government. This led to rising discomfort with the Somoza government and strengthened support of the opposition.

The FSLN attacked National Guard outposts across the country and gained support from Los Doce, an opposition group composed of Nicaragua&#x27;s elite calling for the inclusion of the FSLN in any post-Somoza government.

On 10 January 1978, Pedro Joaquín Chamorro, the owner of La Prensa and founder of the Democratic Liberation Union opposition group, was assassinated. Somoza&#x27;s son and the National Guard were held responsible, provoking mass demonstrations against the Somoza government.

===Two approaches to a solution===

During the Somoza regime, numerous opposition groups emerged in addition to the FSLN. In May 1978, the Conservative Party joined the Democratic Liberation Union, Los Doce and the Nicaraguan Democratic Movement in creating the Broad Opposition Front (FAO). FAO aimed to achieve a negotiated solution with the Somoza government, operating through strikes and mediation. The FSLN responded to FAO by establishing the United People&#x27;s Movement. The United People&#x27;s Movement had a different approach to reaching a solution, promoting warfare and nationwide insurrection as the means to overthrow the dictatorship.

In August 1978, the FSLN took over the National Palace, holding government officials and members of congress hostage. Somoza had no choice but to meet their demands, further tarnishing the Somoza image and undermining the regime&#x27;s power.

By late 1978, FAO&#x27;s failure to obtain a negotiated solution led to the increasing strength of the insurrection movement. Los Doce withdrew from FAO in October and many FAO members resigned. The mediation effort officially collapsed in January 1979, when Somoza refused to hold a national plebiscite and insisted on remaining in power until 1981. As a result, the insurrection movement gained momentum and fighting increased.

In February 1979, the FSLN seized the opportunity afforded by the collapse of negotiations to broaden its support base and form the National Patriotic Front which included Los Doce, the Independent Liberal Party and Popular Social Christian Party. Heavy fighting broke out all over Nicaragua and the FSLN&#x27;s final offensive was launched in May 1979. These efforts saw the National Guard lose control over many areas of the country. By the end of June, most of Nicaragua was under FSLN control.

The Somoza regime&#x27;s political, international and military isolation forced Anastasio Somoza Debayle to consider resignation. A provisional Nicaraguan government in exile was organised in Costa Rica on 18 June 1979. The five-member junta promised a mixed economy, a nonaligned foreign policy and political pluralism.

===Resignation===
On 17 July 1979, Anastasio Somoza Debayle resigned as President of Nicaragua and fled to Miami, marking the end of the Somoza family dictatorship. Senate President Pablo Rener fled with him. Somoza handed over power to President of the Chamber of Deputies Francisco Urcuyo who would in turn transfer the government to the junta. Anastasio Somoza Debayle lived in Paraguay until 17 September 1980 when he was assassinated by Argentine guerrillas.

<doc id="255070" wikidata="Q277716" url="?curid=255070" title="Chlamydoselachidae">
<text>Chlamydoselachidae is a family of primitive deep-sea sharks in the order Hexanchiformes. They are one of only two extant families in the order alongside the cow sharks in the family Hexanchidae, and the only members of the suborder Chlamydoselachoidei.

They are now represented only by two extant species in the genus &quot;Chlamydoselachus&quot;: the frilled shark (&quot;C. anguineus&quot;) and the Southern African frilled shark (&quot;C. africana&quot;). However, they are thought to have been more diverse during the Late Cretaceous, where all three extant and extinct genera are known, and one other genus (&quot;Rolfodon&quot;) survived up to the Pliocene. The earliest remains of the family are indeterminate teeth from the Turonian of Japan. Members of this family appear to have always been closely associated with deep-sea habitats. Some extinct taxa such as &quot;Rolfodon goliath&quot; and &quot;Dykeius&quot; could grow to very large sizes.

<text>Lance Allan Ito (born August 2, 1950) is an American retired judge, best known for presiding over the criminal trial for the O. J. Simpson murder case, held in the Los Angeles County Superior Court in 1995.

== Early life and career ==

Ito was born in Los Angeles to Jim Ito and Toshi Ito. Both his parents were kept in internment camps for Japanese Americans with their families during the Second World War. Ito was enrolled in Sunday School at the Mount Hollywood Congregational Church. Ito attended John Marshall High School, where he was student body president and received the Scholar Athlete award in 1968. He earned his bachelor&#x27;s degree with honors from the University of California, Los Angeles in 1972, and his J.D. degree from the then University of California, Berkeley, Boalt School of Law in 1975. He then joined the Los Angeles district attorney&#x27;s office in 1977, working in the hardcore gang unit and the organized crime and terror unit, among others. During his time he successfully prosecuted Brandon Tholmer.

In 1981, he married Margaret Ann York, the first woman to attain the rank of Deputy Chief in the Los Angeles Police Department and that department&#x27;s highest ranking woman officer when she retired in 2002. The two met while at an Eagle Rock murder scene.

Republican Governor George Deukmejian appointed Ito to the Municipal Court in 1987, and then elevated him to Superior Court in 1989.

In a high-profile case in 1991, Ito determined that Soon Ja Du, a convenience store owner who had shot and killed Latasha Harlins, was not a flight risk, denying the deputy district attorney&#x27;s request to revoke Du&#x27;s bail.

In 1992, he initially handled the indictment against Lyle and Erik Menendez, two brothers who were accused and later convicted of murdering their parents.

==Charles H. Keating Jr. trial==
In 1992, Ito presided over the trial of financier Charles H. Keating Jr. Keating&#x27;s ensuing ten-year sentence was later overturned on appeal because Ito had neglected to instruct the jury to determine whether Keating &quot;intended&quot; to defraud investors. It was the prosecution&#x27;s position that Keating was liable as a matter of strict liability.

==O. J. Simpson murder trial==

Ito presided over the 1995 murder trial of O. J. Simpson, at which Simpson was acquitted. His decision to allow television coverage of the trial was controversial, and Ito faced criticism for seeming to enjoy the press and for allowing too many sidebars and recesses.

During the trial, the prosecution requested that Ito recuse himself when it came to light that his wife, Margaret York, had been detective Mark Fuhrman&#x27;s superior officer in the past. Fuhrman had been called to testify by the prosecution regarding his discovery of evidence in the case. During cross-examination, Fuhrman claimed that he had not used racial epithets to refer to African-Americans during the last ten years. Simpson&#x27;s defense team unearthed tapes in which Fuhrman had used racial epithets as recently as 1988, and they wished to introduce them as evidence to prove that Fuhrman had perjured himself, in order to discredit his testimony. However, in the tapes, Fuhrman disparages York&#x27;s appearance and suggests that she used her gender to advance in the police force. The prosecution requested that Ito step down because they felt that derogatory remarks toward his wife might bias Ito against Fuhrman, though prosecutors later withdrew the request out of fear that it would result in a mistrial.

==Post-Simpson trial career==
Ito declined to give interviews regarding the Simpson murder trial because ethical guidelines for California trial-court judges forbid commenting on pending matters or matters likely to come before the courts. He has noted his disbelief that public interest in the trial extended through the turgid DNA section of the trial. He has used his status to work on issues of judicial reform, such as increasing the number of interpreters and enforcing rules for foreign-national defendants in the court. 

In 2002, he was the appointed to be the judge in the case of Efren Saldivar. Los Angeles County announced in April 2012 that Ito&#x27;s courtroom, along with 55 others, would be closed due to budget cuts. Ito retired in 2015.

<doc id="255075" wikidata="Q270785" url="?curid=255075" title="Symphony No. 8 (Beethoven)">
<text>The Symphony No. 8 in F major, Op. 93 is a symphony in four movements composed by Ludwig van Beethoven in 1812. Beethoven fondly referred to it as &quot;my little Symphony in F&quot;, distinguishing it from his Sixth Symphony, a longer work also in F.

The Eighth Symphony is generally light-hearted, though not lightweight, and in many places loud, with many accented notes. Various passages in the symphony are heard by some listeners to be musical jokes. As with various other Beethoven works such as the Opus 27 piano sonatas and the later Ninth Symphony, the symphony deviates from Classical tradition in making the last movement the weightiest of the four.

==Composition, premiere and reception==
The work was begun in the summer of 1812, immediately after the completion of the Seventh Symphony. At the time Beethoven was 41 years old. According to Antony Hopkins, the mood of the work betrays nothing of the events that were taking place in Beethoven&#x27;s life at the time, which involved his interference in his brother Johann&#x27;s romantic relationships. The work took Beethoven only four months to complete, and is, unlike many of his works, without dedication.

The premiere took place on 27 February 1814, at a concert in the Redoutensaal, Vienna, at which the Seventh Symphony (which had been premiered two months earlier) was also played. Beethoven was growing increasingly deaf at the time, but nevertheless insisted on leading the premiere. Reportedly, &quot;the orchestra largely ignored his ungainly gestures and followed the principal violinist instead.&quot;

When asked by his pupil Carl Czerny why the Eighth was less popular than the Seventh, Beethoven is said to have replied, &quot;because the Eighth is so much better.&quot; A critic wrote that &quot;the applause it received was not accompanied by that enthusiasm which distinguishes a work which gives universal delight; in short—as the Italians say—it did not create a furor.&quot; According to Czerny, Beethoven was angered by this reception. George Bernard Shaw, in his capacity as a music critic, agreed with Beethoven&#x27;s assessment of the work, writing that &quot;In all subtler respects the Eighth is better [than the Seventh].&quot; More recently, Jan Swafford has described the Eighth as &quot;a beautiful, brief, ironic look backward to Haydn and Mozart.&quot; Martin Geck has commented on the authenticity of the Eighth, noting that it contains &quot;all the relevant hallmarks, including motivic and thematic writing notable for its advanced planning, defiant counterpoint, furious cross-rhythms, sudden shifts from &quot;piano&quot; to &quot;forte&quot;, and idyllic and even hymnlike episodes.&quot;

==Form==

#Allegro vivace e con brio (F major)
#Allegretto scherzando quasi andante (B major)
#Tempo di menuetto (F major)
#Allegro vivace (F major)

The symphony is scored for two flutes, two oboes, two clarinets in B, two bassoons, two horns in F (in B basso for the second movement), two trumpets in F, timpani, and strings.

It is approximately 26 minutes in duration.

===First movement===
This movement is in the home key of F major and is in fast time. As with most of Beethoven&#x27;s first movements of this period, it is written in sonata form, including a fairly substantial coda. Hopkins observed that the movement is slightly unusual among Beethoven&#x27;s works in that it reaches its dramatic climax not during the development section, but at the onset of the recapitulation. The concluding bars of the development form a huge crescendo and the return of the opening bars is marked (&quot;fortississimo&quot;, i.e. extremely loud), which rarely appears in Beethoven&#x27;s works, but has precedents in the Sixth and Seventh symphonies. This is balanced by the quiet closing measures of the movement.

The opening theme is in three sections of four bars each, with the pattern &quot;forte&quot;–&quot;piano&quot;–&quot;forte&quot;. At the onset of the recapitulation, the theme is made more emphatic by omitting the middle four bars.

According to Dutch musicologist Cees Nieuwenhuizen, Beethoven may have originally envisioned this movement as a piano concerto first movement.

===Second movement===
There is a widespread belief that this movement is an affectionate parody of the metronome, which had only recently been invented (or more accurately, merely improved) by Beethoven&#x27;s friend, Johann Maelzel. Specifically the belief was that the movement was based on a canon called &quot;Ta ta ta... Lieber Maelzel,&quot; WoO 162, said to have been improvised at a dinner party in Maelzel&#x27;s honor in 1812. However, there is no evidence corroborating this story and it is likely that WoO 162 was not written by Beethoven but was constructed after-the-fact by Anton Schindler. A more likely inspiration was the similar rhythmic parody of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s &quot;Clock&quot; Symphony.

The movement begins with even staccato chords in 16th-notes (semiquavers) played by the wind instruments, and a basic 16th-note rhythm continues steadily through the piece. Richard Wagner has argued that the third movement was intended as the slow movement of this symphony and that the second should be played as a scherzo.

The key is B major, the subdominant of F, and the organization is what Charles Rosen has called &quot;slow movement sonata form&quot;; that is, at the end of the exposition there is no development section, but only a simple modulation back to B for the recapitulation; this also may be described as sonatina form.

The second subject includes a motif of very rapid sixty-fourth notes. This motif is played by the whole orchestra at the end of the coda.

&lt;/score&gt;

The style of Beethoven&#x27;s minuet is not particularly close to its 18th-century predecessors, as it retains a rather coarse, thumping rhythm; such as how after the initial upbeat Beethoven places the dynamic indication &quot;sforzando&quot; ( ) on each of the next five beats. This makes the minuet stylistically close to the other movements of the symphony, which likewise rely often on good-humored, thumping accents.

The minuet is written in ternary form, with a contrasting trio section containing prized solos for horns and clarinet. The clarinet solo is of significant importance in that it was the first major example of a solo clarinet playing a written G6. Igor Stravinsky praised the &quot;incomparable instrumental thought&quot; shown in Beethoven&#x27;s orchestration of the trio section. &lt;!--
The symphony ends with a very long passage of loud tonic harmony. Tchaikovsky called this movement &quot;One of the greatest symphonic masterpieces of Beethoven.&quot;

<doc id="255078" wikidata="Q2000320" url="?curid=255078" title="An Open Letter to Hobbyists">
<text>&quot;An Open Letter to Hobbyists&quot; is a 1976 open letter written by Bill Gates, the co-founder of Microsoft, to early personal computer hobbyists, in which Gates expresses dismay at the widespread duplication of software taking place in the hobbyist community, particularly with regard to his company&#x27;s software.

In the letter, Gates expressed frustration with most computer hobbyists who were using his company&#x27;s Altair BASIC software without having paid for it. He asserted that such widespread use of his software in effect discouraged developers from investing time and money in creating high-quality software. He cited the unfairness of gaining the benefits of software authors&#x27; time, effort, and capital without paying them as a rationale for refusing to publish the source code for his company&#x27;s flagship product, thereby making it unavailable to lower-income hobbyists who could have borrowed such program blueprints from their local library and entered the program into their hobby computer by data entry.

== Altair BASIC ==


In December 1974, Gates, a student at Harvard University, alongside Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen, who worked at Honeywell in Boston, both saw the Altair 8800 computer in the January 1975 issue of &quot;Popular Electronics&quot; for the first time. They had both written BASIC language programs since their days at Lakeside School in Seattle, and knew the Altair computer was powerful enough to support a BASIC interpreter. Both Gates and Allen wanted to be the first to offer BASIC for the Altair computer, and expected the software development tools they had previously created for their Intel 8008 microprocessor-based Traf-O-Data computer to give them a head start.

By early March of the following year, Allen, Gates and Monte Davidoff, a fellow Harvard student, had created a BASIC interpreter that worked under simulation on a PDP-10 mainframe computer at Harvard. Allen and Gates had been in contact with Ed Roberts of MITS, and in March 1975, Allen visited Albuquerque, New Mexico, to test the software on an actual machine. To both Allen and Roberts&#x27; surprise, the software worked. MITS agreed to license the software from Allen and Gates. Allen left his job at Honeywell, and became the Vice President and Director of Software at MITS with a salary of $30,000 () a year; Gates remained a student at Harvard, and worked under MITS as a contractor instead, with the October 1975 company newsletter giving his title at the company as &quot;Software Specialist&quot;.

On July 22, 1975, MITS signed the contract with Allen and Gates, who would receive $3000 at the signing and a royalty for each copy of BASIC sold; $30 for the 4K version, $35 for the 8K version and $60 for the expanded version. The contract had a cap of $180,000, with MITS retaining an exclusive worldwide license to the program for 10 years. MITS would supply the computer time necessary for development on a PDP-10 owned by the Albuquerque school district.

The April 1975 issue of MITS&#x27;s &quot;Computer Notes&quot; had the banner headline &quot;Altair Basic – Up and Running&quot;. The Altair 8800 computer was a break-even sale for MITS, who would need to sell additional memory boards, I/O boards, and other add-on options to make a profit. When purchased with two 4K memory boards and an I/O board, the 8K BASIC cost just $75, the initial standalone price for BASIC being $500. To promote the computer, MITS purchased a camper van and outfitted it with the complete product line, dubbed the &quot;MITS-Mobile&quot;; the company used this van to tour the United States, giving seminars featuring the Altair Computer and Altair BASIC.
==1975 Homebrew Computer Club and subsequent copying of Altair BASIC==
The Homebrew Computer Club was an early computer hobbyist club in Palo Alto, California. At the first meeting in March 1975, Steve Dompier gave an account of his visit to the MITS factory in Albuquerque, where he had attempted to pick up his order for one of everything. He left with a computer kit with 256 bytes of memory. At the April 16, 1975 club meeting, Dompier keyed in a small program that played the song &quot;The Fool on the Hill&quot; on a nearby AM radio, through the use of radio frequency interference or static controlled by the timing loops in the program. Gates, who could not figure out how the computer could broadcast to the radio, described this in the July 1975 edition of &quot;Computer Notes&quot; as &quot;the best demo program I&#x27;ve seen for the Altair&quot;.

The June 1975 &quot;Homebrew Computer Club Newsletter&quot; carried this item written by Fred Moore, Editor:

The MITS MOBILE came to Rickey&#x27;s Hyatt House in Palo Alto June 5th &amp; 6th. The room was packed (150+) with amateurs and experimenters eager to find out about this new electronic toy. 
At the same June seminar, a paper tape containing a pre-release version of Altair BASIC disappeared. The tape was given to Dompier, who passed it on to Dan Sokol, who had access to a high speed tape punch. At the next Homebrew Computer Club meeting, 50 copies of Altair BASIC on paper tape appeared in a cardboard box.

MITS offered a complete Altair system with two MITS 4K Dynamic RAM boards, a serial interface board and Altair BASIC for $995. However, the $264 MITS RAM boards were unreliable, due to several component and design problems. An enterprising Homebrew Computer Club member, Robert Marsh, designed a 4K static memory that was plug-in compatible with the Altair 8800, and sold it for $255. His company, Processor Technology, became one of the most successful Altair compatible board suppliers. As a result of Dompier&#x27;s copying of Altair BASIC and Marsh&#x27;s third-party 4K static memory plug-in, many Altair 8800 computer owners came to skip purchasing the bundled package from MITS directly, instead purchasing their memory boards from a third-party supplier and using a &quot;borrowed&quot; copy of Altair BASIC.

Ed Roberts acknowledged the 4K Dynamic RAM board problems in the October 1975 &quot;Computer Notes&quot;. The price was reduced from $264 to $195, and existing purchasers got a $50 rebate; the full price for 8K Altair BASIC was reduced to $200, though Roberts declined a customer&#x27;s request that MITS give BASIC to customers for free, noting that MITS had made a &quot;$180,000 royalty commitment to Micro Soft&quot;. Roberts also wrote that &quot;Anyone who is using a stolen copy of MITS BASIC should identify himself for what he is, a thief&quot;, and described third-party hardware suppliers as &quot;parasite companies&quot;. The newly released Processor Technology static RAM board drew more current than the MITS dynamic RAM board, with the addition of two or three boards taxing the Altair 8800&#x27;s power supply. As a consequence, Howard Fullmer began selling a power supply upgrade for the Altair, naming his company Parasitic Engineering as a nod to Roberts&#x27; comments. Fullmer would later help define the industry standard for Altair compatible boards, the S-100 bus standard. The next year, 1976, would see many Altair bus computer clones such as the IMSAI 8080 and the Processor Technology Sol-20.

== Open letter ==

At the end of 1975, MITS was shipping a thousand computers a month, but copies of BASIC were selling in the low hundreds. Additional software projects required more resources; the MITS 8-inch floppy disk system was about to be released, as was the MITS 680B computer based on the Motorola 6800. A high school friend of Allen and Gates, Ric Weiland, was hired to convert the 8080 BASIC to the 6800 microprocessor. David Bunnell, &quot;Computer Notes&quot; Editor, was sympathetic to Gates&#x27; position. He wrote in the September 1975 issue that &quot;customers have been ripping off MITS software&quot;.

Now I ask you--does a musician have the right to collect the royalty on the sale of his records or does a writer have the right to collect the royalty on the sale of his books? Are people who copy software any different than those who copy records and books? 

Gates, keen to attempt to explain the cost of developing software to the hobbyist community, restated much of what Bunnell had written in September and what Roberts had written in October; however, the tone of his letter was different, instead emphasising Gates&#x27; view that hobbyists were stealing from him personally, and not from a corporation.

Why is this? As the majority of hobbyists must be aware, most of you steal your software. Hardware must be paid for, but software is something to share. Who cares if the people who worked on it get paid?

One of the principal targets of the letter was the Homebrew Computer Club, with a copy sent to the club directly. The letter also appeared in &quot;Computer Notes&quot;. To ensure the letter would be noticed, Bunnell sent the letter via special delivery mail to every major computer publication in the country.

In the letter, Gates also mentioned the development of the APL programming language for the 8080 and 6800 microprocessors, a programming language in vogue with some other computer scientists in the 1970s. The language, which used a character set based on the Greek alphabet, required special terminals to implement that most hobbyist terminals did not have; as well as not displaying symbols from the Greek alphabet, most hobbyist terminals did not even display lowercase letters. Though Gates was enamored with APL, Allen did not believe it could be sold as a product; interest in the project soon faded, and the software itself was never completed.

== Reaction ==
Following the difficulties with receiving piecemeal royalties, Microsoft switched to a fixed-priced contract with MITS, who would pay $31,200 for a non-exclusive license of 6800 BASIC. The future sales of BASIC for the Commodore PET, the Apple II, the Radio Shack TRS-80 and others were all fixed-price contracts.

In early 1976 ads for its Apple I computer, Apple Inc made the claims that &quot;our philosophy is to provide software for our machines free or at minimal cost&quot;, emphasising that Apple BASIC was free.

Microsoft&#x27;s software development was done on a DEC PDP-10 mainframe computer system, with Allen having developed a program that could completely simulate a new microprocessor system. This allowed Microsoft to write and debug software before the new computer hardware was complete. The company was charged by the hour and by the amount of resources (such as storage and printing) used, the &quot;$40,000 of computer time&quot; mentioned in the letter. As a result of these software developments, the 6800 BASIC was complete before the Altair 680 was finished, with the 680 hardware arriving months late.

Hal Singer of the &quot;Micro-8 Newsletter&quot; published an open letter to Roberts, pointing out that MITS promised a computer for $395, but that the price for a working system was $1000. He suggested a class action lawsuit or a Federal Trade Commission investigation into false advertising was in order. Hal also noted that rumors were circulating that Gates had developed BASIC on a Harvard University computer funded by the US government, and that customers should not pay for software already paid for by the taxpayer. Gates, Allen and Davidoff had used a PDP-10 at Harvard&#x27;s Aiken Computer Center, the computer system of which had been funded by the Department of Defence through its Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency; Harvard officials were not pleased that Gates and Allen (who was not a student) had used the PDP-10 to develop a commercial product, but determined that the computer itself, which technically belonged to the military, was not covered by any Harvard policy; the PDP-10 was controlled by Professor Thomas Cheatham, who felt that students could use the machine for personal use. Harvard placed restrictions on the computer&#x27;s use, and Gates and Allen had to use a commercial time share computer in Boston to finalize the software.

In 2008, Homebrew member Lee Felsenstein recalled similar doubts about Gates&#x27; $40,000 number: &quot;Well, we all knew [that] the evaluation of computer time was the ultimate in funny money. You never pay that much for the computer time and I think that research will show that they were using someone else&#x27;s computer time; someone else was paying for that. It could have been Honeywell where Paul Allen was working. So we all knew this to be a spurious argument.&quot;

According to Felsenstein, Gates&#x27; letter &quot;delineated a rift [between] the actual industry where there&#x27;s trying to make money and there&#x27;s those hobbyist where we&#x27;re trying to make things happen&quot;;

The industry needs the hobbyists and this was illustrated by what happened eventually. When National Semiconductor, which made their own microprocessor chips in &#x27;77 or &#x27;78, decided they needed a BASIC ... they asked, &#x27;What&#x27;s the most popular BASIC?&#x27; And the answer was Microsoft BASIC because everybody had copied it and everybody was using it. So we made Microsoft the standard BASIC. National Semiconductor went to Microsoft and bought a license, they were in business that way. This was the marketing function and the hobbyists did the marketing with a complete antipathy of the company in question. There were other BASICs and, you know, some of them might even have been better. ... [Gates&#x27; later success] was in a certain measure because of what we did, that he said we shouldn&#x27;t do, we were thieves to do it, and all.

Jim Warren, Homebrew Computer Club Member and editor of &quot;Dr. Dobb&#x27;s Journal&quot;, wrote in the July 1976 ACM Programming Language newsletter about the successful Tiny BASIC project. The goal was to create BASIC language interpreters for microprocessor based computers. The project had started in late 1975, but the &quot;Open Letter&quot; motivated many hobbyists to participate. Computer clubs and individuals from all parts of the United States and the world soon created Tiny BASIC interpreters for the Intel 8080, the Motorola 6800 and MOS Technology 6502 processors. The assembly language source code was published or the software was sold for five or ten dollars.

<text>Freda Josephine Baker (; June 3, 1906 – April 12, 1975), naturalized as Joséphine Baker, was an American-born French dancer, singer, and actress. Her career was centered primarily in Europe, mostly in France. She was the first black woman to star in a major motion picture, the 1927 French silent film &quot;Siren of the Tropics&quot;, directed by and .

During her early career, Baker was among the most celebrated performers to headline the revues of the in Paris. Her performance in its 1927 revue caused a sensation in the city. Her costume, consisting only of a short skirt of artificial bananas and a beaded necklace, became an iconic image and a symbol both of the Jazz Age and the Roaring Twenties. Baker was celebrated by artists and intellectuals of the era, who variously dubbed her the &quot;Black Venus&quot;, the &quot;Black Pearl&quot;, the &quot;Bronze Venus&quot;, and the &quot;Creole Goddess&quot;. Born in St. Louis, Missouri, she renounced her U.S. citizenship and became a French national after her marriage to French industrialist Jean Lion in 1937. She raised her children in France.

Baker aided the French Resistance during World War II. After the war, she was awarded the Resistance Medal by the French Committee of National Liberation, the by the French military, and was named a Chevalier of the Legion of Honour by General Charles de Gaulle. Baker sang: &quot;I have two loves: my country and Paris.&quot; On November 30, 2021, Baker was inducted into the Panthéon in Paris, the first black woman to receive one of the highest honors in France. As her resting place remains in Monaco Cemetery, a cenotaph was installed in vault 13 of the crypt in the Panthéon.

Baker, who refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, is also noted for her contributions to the civil rights movement. In 1968, she was offered unofficial leadership in the movement in the United States by Coretta Scott King, following Martin Luther King Jr.&#x27;s assassination. After thinking it over, Baker declined the offer out of concern for the welfare of her children.

==Early life==
Josephine Baker was born Freda Josephine McDonald in St. Louis, Missouri. Baker&#x27;s ancestry is unknown—her mother, Carrie, was adopted in Little Rock, Arkansas, in 1886 by Richard and Elvira McDonald, both of whom were former slaves of African and Native American descent. Baker&#x27;s estate identifies vaudeville drummer Eddie Carson as her natural father despite evidence to the contrary. In 1993, Josephine Baker&#x27;s foster son Jean-Claude Baker published a biography titled &quot;Josephine: The hungry Heart&quot;, which was the culmination of decades of exhaustive research into Baker&#x27;s life and career. In the book, he discusses at length the circumstances surrounding Baker&#x27;s birth:

Josephine McDonald spent her early life on 212 Targee Street (known by some St. Louis residents as Johnson Street) in the Chestnut Valley neighborhood of St. Louis, a racially mixed low-income area near Union Station, consisting mainly of rooming houses, brothels, and apartments without indoor plumbing. She was poorly dressed, hungry as a child, and developed street smarts playing in the railroad yards of Union Station.

Her mother married Arthur Martin, &quot;a kind but perpetually unemployed man&quot;, with whom she had a son and two more daughters. She took in laundry; her mother placed her there due to her family being impoverished; she worked there in order to increase the income of her family and, at eight years old, Josephine began working as a live-in domestic for white families in St. Louis. One woman abused her, burning Josephine&#x27;s hands when the young girl put too much soap in the laundry.

In 1917, when she was 11, a terrified Josephine McDonald witnessed racial violence in East St. Louis. In a speech years later, she recalled what she had seen:I can still see myself standing on the west bank of the Mississippi looking over into East St. Louis and watching the glow of the burning of Negro homes lighting the sky. We children stood huddled together in bewilderment ... frightened to death with the screams of the Negro families running across this bridge with nothing but what they had on their backs as their worldly belongings... So with this vision I ran and ran and ran...

By age 12, she had dropped out of school. At 13, she worked as a waitress at the Old Chauffeur&#x27;s Club at 3133 Pine Street. She also lived as a street child in the slums of St. Louis, sleeping in cardboard shelters, scavenging for food in garbage cans, making a living with street-corner dancing. It was at the Old Chauffeur&#x27;s Club that Josephine met Willie Wells, whom she married at age 13, but the marriage lasted less than a year. Following her divorce from Wells, she found work with a street performance group called the Jones Family Band.

In her teens, she struggled to have a healthy relationship with her mother, who opposed her becoming an entertainer and scolded her for not tending to her second husband, William Howard Baker, whom she had married in 1921, at age 15. She soon left him when her vaudeville troupe was booked into a New York City venue. They divorced in 1925, during a period when her career success was beginning. Still, she continued to use his last name professionally for the rest of her life. Though Baker was often on the road, returning with gifts and money for her mother and younger half-sister, larger career opportunities drew her farther afield, to France.

== Career ==
=== Early career ===
Baker&#x27;s unrelenting badgering of a local show manager led to her recruitment for the St. Louis Chorus vaudeville act. At the age of 13, she headed to New York City during the Harlem Renaissance and performed at the Plantation Club, Florence Mills&#x27;s old stomping ground. After several auditions, she secured a role in the chorus line of a touring production of the groundbreaking and hugely successful Broadway revue &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; (1921) that helped bring public attention to Florence Mills, Paul Robeson, and Adelaide Hall.

In &quot;Shuffle Along&quot;, Baker was a dancer at the end of a chorus line. Fearing she might be overshadowed by the others, she used her position to introduce a hint of comedy into her routine, making her stand out from her fellow dancers. She began in &quot;Shuffle Along&quot; with one of the U.S. touring companies, but, once she came of age, she was transferred to the Broadway production, where she remained for several months, until the show closed, in 1923. Next, Baker was cast in &quot;The Chocolate Dandies&quot;, a revue that opened on September 1, 1924. Again, she was relegated to the chorus line. The show ran for 96 performances, finally closing on November 22, 1924.

=== Pre War Paris and rise to fame ===

Baker sailed to Paris in 1925 and opened on October 2 in &quot;&quot; at Théâtre des Champs-Élysées. She was 19 at the time. In a 1974 interview with &quot;The Guardian&quot;, she explained that her first big break came in this bustling European city:

In Paris, she became an instant success for her erotic dancing and for appearing practically nude onstage. After a successful tour of Europe, she broke her contract and returned to France in 1926 to star at the Folies Bergère, setting the standard for her future acts.
Baker performed the , wearing little more than a skirt of strung-together artificial bananas. Her success coincided with the 1925 , which gave birth to the term &quot;Art Deco&quot;, as well as a renewed interest in non-Western art forms, including those of African origin, which Baker would represent. In later shows in Paris, she was often accompanied on stage by her pet cheetah, &quot;Chiquita&quot;, donning a diamond collar. Chiquita frequently escaped into the orchestra pit, terrorizing the musicians and adding another element of excitement to the show.

After a while, Baker became the most successful American entertainer in France. Ernest Hemingway called her &quot;the most sensational woman anyone ever saw.&quot; The author spent hours talking with her in Parisian bars. Picasso depicted her alluring beauty. Jean Cocteau became friendly with her and helped vault her to international stardom. Baker endorsed a &quot;Bakerfix&quot; hair gel, as well as bananas, shoes, and cosmetics, among other products.

In 1929, Baker became the first African-American star to visit Yugoslavia, which she included on a tour through Central Europe via the Orient Express. In Belgrade, she performed at Luxor Balkanska, then the city&#x27;s most luxurious venue. In a nod to local culture, she included a Pirot kilim in her routine, and donated some of the show&#x27;s proceeds to poor children of Serbia. In Zagreb, adoring crowds greeted her at the train station, but opposition from local clergy and morality police led to the cancellation of some of her shows.

During her travels in Yugoslavia, Baker was accompanied by &quot;Count&quot; Giuseppe Pepito Abatino. At the start of her career in France, Abatino, a Sicilian former stonemason who passed himself off as a count, persuaded her to let him manage her. He became not only Baker&#x27;s manager, but her lover as well. The two could not marry because she was not yet divorced from her second husband, Willie Baker.

During this period, she released her most successful song, &quot;J&#x27;ai deux amours&quot; (1931). The song expresses the sentiment that &quot;I have two loves, my country and Paris.&quot; In a 2007 book, Tim Bergfelder, Sue Harris, and Sarah Street claimed that &quot;by the 1930&#x27;s, Baker&#x27;s assimilation into French popular culture had been completed by her association with the song.&quot; She starred in four films, which found success only in Europe: the silent film &quot;Siren of the Tropics&quot; (1927), &quot;Zouzou&quot; (1934) and &quot;Princesse Tam Tam&quot; (1935). She starred in &quot;Fausse Alerte&quot; in 1940. Bergfelder, Harris, and Street wrote that the silent film &quot;Siren of the Tropics&quot; &quot;rehearses the &#x27;primitive-to-Parisienne&#x27; narrative that would become the staple of Baker&#x27;s cinema career, and exploited in particular her comic stage persona based on loose-limbed athleticism and artful clumsiness.&quot; The sound films &quot;Zouzou&quot; (1934) and &quot;Princesse Tam Tam&quot; were both star vehicles for Baker.

Under the management of Abatino, Baker&#x27;s stage and public persona, as well as her singing voice, were transformed. In 1934, she took the lead in a revival of Jacques Offenbach&#x27;s opera &quot;La créole&quot;, which premiered in December of that year for a six-month run at the Théâtre Marigny on the Champs-Élysées of Paris. In preparation for her performances, she went through months of training with a vocal coach. In the words of Shirley Bassey, who has cited Baker as her primary influence, &quot;... she went from a with a decent voice to ... I swear in all my life I have never seen, and probably never shall see again, such a spectacular singer and performer.&quot;

Despite her popularity in France, Baker never attained the equivalent reputation in America. Her star turn in a 1936 revival of &quot;Ziegfeld Follies&quot; on Broadway was not commercially successful, and later in the run she was replaced by Gypsy Rose Lee. &quot;Time&quot; magazine referred to her as a &quot;Negro wench ... whose dancing and singing might be topped anywhere outside of Paris&quot;, while other critics said her voice was &quot;too thin&quot; and &quot;dwarf-like&quot; to fill the Winter Garden Theatre. She returned to Europe heartbroken. This contributed to Baker&#x27;s becoming a legal citizen of France and giving up her American citizenship.

Baker returned to Paris in 1937, married the French industrialist Jean Lion, and became a French citizen. They were married in the French town of Crèvecœur-le-Grand, in a wedding presided over by the mayor, Jammy Schmidt.

Between 1933 and 1937, Baker was a guest at the start of the Tour de France on four occasions. In 1938, after enduring severe hostility in Germany and Eastern Europe during the late 1920s—where she was targeted by storm troopers with ammonia bombs and told to &quot;Go back to Africa&quot;—Josephine Baker became a French citizen by marrying Jean Lion in 1937. This significant event in her life spurred her to actively participate in the French Resistance against the Nazis.

=== World War II ===

In September 1939, when France declared war on Germany in response to the invasion of Poland, Baker was recruited by the Deuxième Bureau, the French military intelligence agency, as an &quot;honorable correspondent&quot;. Baker worked with Jacques Abtey, the head of French counterintelligence in Paris.
She socialized with the Germans at embassies, ministries, night clubs, charming them while secretly gathering information. Her café-society fame enabled her to rub shoulders with those in the know, from high-ranking Japanese officials to Italian and Vichy bureaucrats, reporting to Abtey what she heard. She attended parties and gathered information at the Italian embassy without raising suspicion. Baker&#x27;s espionage work went beyond merely gathering information at social events. She collected detailed intelligence on German troop movements, as well as the locations and activities of airfields and harbors. Confident in her celebrity status and the protections it afforded, Baker believed she could operate without raising suspicion. To covertly transport sensitive information, she used ingenious methods, such as writing notes on her hands and arms, pinning them inside her clothing, and using invisible ink. Her boldness paid off, allowing her to smuggle intelligence across borders and deliver critical reports to the French Resistance.

When the Germans invaded France, Baker left Paris and went to the Château des Milandes, her home in the Dordogne in the south of France. The Château des Milandes became, especially in World War II, one of the most important hideaways; She would shelter resistance fighters and Jewish refugees, providing them with documents and even money for food, cloth, and forged documents she usually financed herself. Her estate also provided the center of resistance activities, including the installation of a radio transmitter in order to be in touch with the Allied forces and storing weapons in its cellar. As an entertainer, Baker had an excuse for moving around Europe, visiting neutral nations such as Portugal, as well as some in South America. She carried information for transmission to England, about airfields, harbors, and German troop concentrations in the West of France. Notes were written in invisible ink on Baker&#x27;s sheet music. As described in &quot;Jazz Cleopatra&quot;, &quot;She specialized in gatherings at embassies and ministries, charming people as she had always done, but at the same time trying to remember interesting items to transmit&quot;.

Later in 1941, she and her entourage went to the French colonies in North Africa. The stated reason was Baker&#x27;s health (since she was recovering from another case of pneumonia), but the real reason was to continue helping the Resistance. From a base in Morocco, she made tours of Spain. She pinned notes with the information she gathered inside her underwear. She met the Pasha of Marrakech, whose support helped her through a miscarriage (the last of several). After the miscarriage, she developed an infection so severe it required a hysterectomy. The infection spread and she developed peritonitis and then sepsis. After her recovery (which she continued to fall in and out of), she started touring to entertain British, French, and American soldiers in North Africa. The Free French had no organized entertainment network for their troops, so Baker and her entourage managed for the most part on their own. They allowed no civilians and charged no admission.

After the war, Baker was awarded the Resistance Medal by the French Committee of National Liberation, the by the French military, and was named a Chevalier of the by General Charles de Gaulle.

Baker&#x27;s last marriage, to French composer and conductor Jo Bouillon, ended around the time she adopted her 11th child.

=== Post War ===

In 1949, a reinvented Baker returned in triumph to the Folies Bergère. Bolstered by recognition of her wartime heroism, Baker the performer assumed a new gravitas, unafraid to take on serious music or subject matter. The engagement was a rousing success and reestablished Baker as one of Paris&#x27; pre-eminent entertainers. In 1951, Baker was invited back to the United States for a nightclub engagement in Miami. After winning a public battle over desegregating the club&#x27;s audience, Baker followed up her sold-out run at the club with a national tour. Rave reviews and enthusiastic audiences accompanied her everywhere, climaxed by a parade in Harlem in honor of her new title: NAACP&#x27;s &quot;Woman of the Year&quot;.

In 1952, Baker was hired to crown the Queen of the Cavalcade of Jazz for the famed eighth Cavalcade of Jazz concert held at Wrigley Field in Los Angeles, which was produced by Leon Hefflin, Sr. on June 1. Also featured to perform that day were Roy Brown and His Mighty Men, Anna Mae Winburn and Her Sweethearts, Toni Harper, Louis Jordan, Jimmy Witherspoon and Jerry Wallace.
An incident at the Stork Club in New York in October 1951 interrupted and overturned her plans. Baker criticized the club&#x27;s unwritten policy of discouraging Black patrons, then scolded columnist Walter Winchell, an old ally, for not rising to her defense. Winchell responded swiftly with a series of harsh public rebukes, including accusations of Communist sympathies (a serious charge at the time). The ensuing publicity resulted in the termination of Baker&#x27;s work visa, forcing her to cancel all her engagements and return to France. It was almost a decade before U.S. officials allowed her back into the country.

In January 1966, Fidel Castro invited Baker to perform at the &quot;Teatro Musical de La Habana&quot; in Havana, Cuba, at the seventh-anniversary celebrations of his revolution. Her spectacular show in April broke attendance records. In 1968, Baker visited Yugoslavia and made appearances in Belgrade and in Skopje. In her later career, Baker faced financial troubles. She commented, &quot;Nobody wants me, they&#x27;ve forgotten me&quot;; but family members encouraged her to continue performing. In 1973 she performed at Carnegie Hall to a standing ovation.

The following year, she appeared in a Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium, and then at the Monegasque Red Cross Gala, celebrating her 50 years in French show business. Advancing years and exhaustion began to take their toll; she sometimes had trouble remembering lyrics, and her speeches between songs tended to ramble. She still continued to captivate audiences of all ages.

== Civil rights activism ==
Although based in France, Baker supported the American Civil Rights Movement during the 1950s. When she arrived in New York with her husband Jo, they were refused reservations at 36 hotels because of racial discrimination. This led her to write several articles about segregation in the United States. She also traveled in the South, giving a talk at Fisk University, a historically black college in Nashville, Tennessee, on &quot;France, North Africa and the Equality of the Races in France&quot;. In the 1950s the FBI tracked everything she did; opening a file on her. The intent of doing so was to deter other countries from allowing her to take the stage. During her travels to foreign countries, she would leverage her influence to bring light to the racial discrimination in the United States which created a rift between her and her homeland.

On October 16, 1951, Josephine Baker experienced a public incident where she was said to have been refused service at the upscale Stork Club in New York City. Determined to expose this injustice, Baker set out to publicize her story, expecting support from one of America&#x27;s most powerful conservative journalists and one of the regulars at the club: Walter Winchell. Instead of solidarizing with Baker, Winchell launched a media attack on her. He labeled her as an anti-American communist sympathizer, which turned the public attention away from the discrimination she had to face. This was an incident that proved that, on one hand, Baker faced racism, while on the other, influential people were also up against her efforts to fight against the same. Undaunted by such opposition, she continued to use her platform to advocate for civil rights and challenge systemic injustice.

She refused to perform for segregated audiences in the United States, although she was offered $10,000 by a Miami club; the club eventually met her demands. Her insistence on mixed audiences helped to integrate live entertainment shows in the Las Vegas Valley. After this incident, she began receiving threatening phone calls from people claiming to be from the Ku Klux Klan but said publicly that she was not afraid of them.

In 1951, Baker made charges of racism against Sherman Billingsley&#x27;s Stork Club in Manhattan, where she had been refused service. Actress Grace Kelly, who was at the club at the time, rushed over to Baker, took her by the arm and stormed out with her entire party, vowing never to return (although she returned on 3 January 1956 with Prince Rainier of Monaco). The two women became close friends after the incident.

When Baker was near bankruptcy, Kelly—by then the princess consort—offered her a villa and financial assistance. (During his work on the &quot;Stork Club&quot; book, author and &quot;New York Times&quot; reporter Ralph Blumenthal was contacted by Jean-Claude Baker, one of Baker&#x27;s sons. He indicated that he had read his mother&#x27;s FBI file and, using comparison of the file to the tapes, said he thought the Stork Club incident was overblown.)

Baker also worked with the NAACP. Her reputation as a crusader grew to such an extent that the NAACP had Sunday, May 20, 1951, declared &quot;Josephine Baker Day&quot;. She was presented with life membership with the NAACP by Nobel Peace Prize winner Ralph Bunche. The honor she was paid spurred her to further her crusading efforts with the &quot;Save Willie McGee&quot; rally. McGee was a black man in Mississippi convicted of raping a white woman in 1945 on the basis of dubious evidence, and sentenced to death. Baker attended rallies for McGee and wrote letters to Fielding Wright, the governor of Mississippi, asking him to spare McGee&#x27;s life. Despite her efforts, McGee was executed in 1951. As the decorated war hero who was bolstered by the racial equality she experienced in Europe, Baker became increasingly regarded as controversial; some black people even began to shun her, fearing that her outspokenness and racy reputation from her earlier years would hurt the cause.

In 1963, she spoke at the March on Washington at the side of Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. Baker was the only official female speaker. While wearing her Free French uniform emblazoned with her medal of the Légion d&#x27;honneur, she introduced the &quot;Negro Women for Civil Rights&quot;. Rosa Parks and Daisy Bates were among those she acknowledged, and both gave brief speeches. Not everyone involved wanted Baker present at the March; some thought her time overseas had made her a woman of France, one who was disconnected from the Civil Rights issues going on in America. In her speech, one of the things Baker said:

I have walked into the palaces of kings and queens, and into the houses of presidents and much more. But I could not walk into a hotel in America and get a cup of coffee, and that made me mad. And when I get mad, you know that I open my big mouth. And then look out, &#x27;cause when Josephine opens her mouth, they hear it all over the world ...

After King&#x27;s assassination, his widow Coretta Scott King approached Baker in the Netherlands to ask if she would take her husband&#x27;s place as leader of the Civil Rights Movement. After many days of thinking it over, Baker declined, saying her children were &quot;too young to lose their mother.&quot;

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships ===

Baker&#x27;s first marriage was to American Pullman porter Willie Wells when she was only 13 years old. The union was reportedly very unhappy, and the couple divorced soon after marrying. Another short-lived marriage followed in 1921, to William Howard Baker. Since her career was already taking off under that last name, she retained it after the divorce. Jean-Claude Baker wrote that Josephine was bisexual and had several relationships with women.

In 1925, she began an extramarital relationship with the Belgian novelist Georges Simenon. On an ocean liner, in 1929, en route from South America to France, Baker had an affair with the Swiss-French architect Le Corbusier (Charles-Édouard Jeanneret). In 1937, Baker married Frenchman Jean Lion, but they separated in 1940. She married French composer and conductor Jo Bouillon in 1947, and their union lasted 14 years before also ending in divorce. Later, she was involved with the artist Robert Brady for a time, but they never married. Speculation exists that Baker was also involved in sexual liaisons, if not relationships, with blues singer Clara Smith, Ada &quot;Bricktop&quot; Smith, French novelist Colette, and Frida Kahlo.

=== Children ===
During her participation in the civil rights movement, Baker began to adopt children, forming a family which she often referred to as &quot;The Rainbow Tribe&quot;. Baker wanted to prove that &quot;children of different ethnicities and religions could still be brothers.&quot; She often took the children with her cross-country, and when they were at Château des Milandes, she arranged tours so visitors could walk the grounds and see how natural and happy the children were in &quot;The Rainbow Tribe&quot;. Her estate featured hotels, a farm, rides, and the children singing and dancing for the audience. She charged an admission fee to visitors who entered and partook in the activities, which included watching the children play.

She created dramatic backstories for them, picking them with clear intent in mind: at one point, she wanted and planned to adopt a Jewish baby, but she settled for a French one. She also raised them in different religions in order to further her model for the world, taking two children from Algeria and raising one child as a Muslim and raising the other child as a Catholic. One member of the Tribe, Jean-Claude Baker, said: &quot;She wanted a doll&quot;.

Baker raised two daughters, French-born Marianne and Moroccan-born Stellina, and 10 sons, Japanese-born Janot (born Teruya) and Akio, Colombian-born Luis, Finnish-born Jari (now Jarry), French-born Jean-Claude, Noël, and Moïse, Algerian-born Brahim (later Brian), Ivorian-born Koffi, and Venezuelan-born Mara. Later on, Josephine Baker would become the legal guardian of another boy, also named Jean-Claude, and considered him an unofficial addition to the Rainbow Tribe. For some time, Baker lived with her children and an enormous staff in the château in Dordogne, France, with her fourth husband, Jo Bouillon. Bouillon claimed that Baker bore one child, though it was stillborn in 1941, an incident that precipitated an emergency hysterectomy.

Baker forced Jarry to leave the château and live with his adoptive father, Jo Bouillon, in Argentina, at the age of 15, after discovering that he was gay (though it appears that the two were able to reconcile in later years.) Moïse died of cancer in 1999, and Noël was diagnosed with schizophrenia and is in a psychiatric hospital as of 2009. Jean-Claude Baker, the unofficial addition to the Rainbow Tribe, committed suicide in 2015, aged 71.

== Later years and death ==
In her later years Baker converted to Catholicism. In 1968, Baker lost her château owing to unpaid debts; afterwards Princess Grace offered her an apartment in Roquebrune, near Monaco.

Baker was back on stage at the Olympia in Paris in 1968, in Belgrade and at Carnegie Hall in 1973 and at the Royal Variety Performance at the London Palladium and at the &quot;Gala du Cirque&quot; in Paris in 1974. On April 8, 1975, Baker starred in a retrospective revue at the Bobino in Paris, &quot;Joséphine à Bobino 1975&quot; celebrating her 50 years in show business. The revue, financed by Prince Rainier, Princess Grace, and Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis, opened to rave reviews. Demand for seating was such that fold-out chairs had to be added to accommodate spectators. The opening-night audience included Sophia Loren, Mick Jagger, Shirley Bassey, Diana Ross and Liza Minnelli.

Four days later, Baker was found lying peacefully in her bed surrounded by newspapers with glowing reviews of her performance. She was in a coma after suffering a cerebral hemorrhage. She was taken to Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital, where she died, aged 68, on April 12, 1975.

Baker received a full Catholic funeral at L&#x27;Église de la Madeleine, attracting more than 20,000 mourners. The only American-born woman to receive full French military honors at her funeral, Baker&#x27;s funeral was the occasion of a huge procession. After a family service at Saint-Charles Church in Monte Carlo, Baker was interred at the .

Baker was a Freemason.

== Legacy ==

Place Joséphine Baker in the Montparnasse Quarter of Paris was named in her honor. She has also been inducted into the St. Louis Walk of Fame, and on March 29, 1995, into the Hall of Famous Missourians. St. Louis&#x27;s Channing Avenue was renamed Josephine Baker Boulevard, and a wax sculpture of Baker is on permanent display at The Griot Museum of Black History.

In 2015, she was inducted into the Legacy Walk in Chicago, Illinois. The Piscine Joséphine Baker is a swimming pool along the banks of the Seine in Paris named after her.

Writing in the online &quot;BBC Magazine&quot; in late 2014, Darren Royston, historical dance teacher at RADA, credited Baker with being the Beyoncé of her day, and bringing the Charleston to Britain. Two of Baker&#x27;s sons, Jean-Claude and Jarry (Jari), grew up to go into business together, running the restaurant Chez Josephine on Theatre Row, 42nd Street, New York City. It celebrates Baker&#x27;s life and works.
Château des Milandes, a castle near Sarlat in the Dordogne, was Baker&#x27;s home where she raised her twelve children. It is open to the public and displays her stage outfits including her banana skirt (of which there are apparently several). It also displays many family photographs and documents as well as her Legion of Honour medal. Most rooms are open for the public to walk through including bedrooms with the cots where her children slept, a huge kitchen, and a dining room where she often entertained large groups. The bathrooms were designed in art deco style but most rooms retained the French chateau style.

Baker continued to influence celebrities more than a century after her birth. In a 2003 interview with &quot;USA Today&quot;, Angelina Jolie cited Baker as &quot;a model for the multiracial, multinational family she was beginning to create through adoption.&quot; Beyoncé performed Baker&#x27;s banana dance at the Fashion Rocks concert at Radio City Music Hall in September 2006.

As a commemoration of Baker&#x27;s one hundredth birthday, a multi-media performance was written and shown in 2006. The following year, &quot;Josephine Baker: A Life of Le Jazz Hot!&quot; was recorded from the Baker inspired production by Imani Winds.

Writing on the 110th anniversary of her birth, &quot;Vogue&quot; described how her 1926 &quot;danse sauvage&quot; in her famous banana skirt &quot;brilliantly manipulated the white male imagination&quot; and &quot;radically redefined notions of race and gender through style and performance in a way that continues to echo throughout fashion and music today, from Prada to Beyoncé.&quot;

On June 3, 2017, the 111th anniversary of her birth, Google released an animated Google Doodle, which consists of a slideshow chronicling her life and achievements.

On Thursday, November 22, 2018, a documentary entitled &quot;Josephine Baker: The Story of an Awakening&quot;, directed by Ilana Navaro, premiered at the Beirut Art Film Festival. It contains rarely seen archival footage, including some never before discovered, with music and narration.

In August 2019, Baker was one of those inducted in the Rainbow Honor Walk, a walk of fame in San Francisco&#x27;s Castro District noting LGBTQ people who have &quot;made significant contributions in their fields&quot;.

The Staatliche Museen zu Berlin (Berlin State Museums) hosted an exhibition &quot;Josephine Baker: Icon in Motion&quot; from January 26 through April 28, 2024. The show displays photographs, film, and drawings covering her entertainment career through her involvement in civil rights. The exhibit includes Baker inspired works by her contemporaries.

Josephine Baker appears on the French 20-cent euro coins released in March 2024.

=== Panthéon in Paris ===

In May 2021, an online petition was set up by writer Laurent Kupferman asking that Joséphine Baker be honoured by being reburied at the Panthéon in Paris or being granted Panthéon honours, which would make her only the sixth woman at the mausoleum alongside Simone Veil, Geneviève de Gaulle-Anthonioz, Marie Curie, Germaine Tillion, and Sophie Berthelot. In August 2021 the French President, Emmanuel Macron, announced that Baker&#x27;s remains would be reburied at the Panthéon in November 2021, following the petition and continued requests from Baker&#x27;s family since 2013. Her son Claude Bouillon-Baker, however, told Agence France-Presse that her body would remain in Monaco and only a plaque would be installed at the Panthéon. It was later announced that a symbolic casket containing soil from various locations where Baker had lived, including St. Louis, Paris, the South of France and Monaco, would be carried by the French Air and Space Force in a parade in Paris before a ceremony at the Panthéon where the casket was interred. The ceremony took place on Tuesday, November 30, 2021, and Baker thus became the first black woman to be honored in the secular temple to the &quot;great men&quot; of the French Republic.
