<text>Continental climates often have a significant annual variation in temperature (warm to hot summers and cold winters). They tend to occur in central and eastern parts of the three northern-tier continents (North America, Europe, and Asia), typically in the middle latitudes (40 to 55 or 60 degrees north), often within large landmasses, where prevailing winds blow overland bringing some precipitation, and temperatures are not moderated by oceans. Continental climates occur mostly in the Northern Hemisphere due to the large landmasses found there. Most of northeastern China, eastern and southeastern Europe, much of Russia south of the Arctic Circle, central and southeastern Canada, and the central and northeastern United States have this type of climate. Continentality is a measure of the degree to which a region experiences this type of climate.

In continental climates, precipitation tends to be moderate in amount, concentrated mostly in the warmer months. Only a few areas—in the mountains of the Pacific Northwest of North America and in Iran, northern Iraq, adjacent Turkey, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and Central Asia—show a winter maximum in precipitation. A portion of the annual precipitation falls as snowfall, and snow often remains on the ground for more than a month. Summers in continental climates can feature thunderstorms and frequent hot temperatures; however, summer weather is somewhat more stable than winter weather. Continental climates are considered as temperate climate varieties due to their location in the temperate zones, but are classified separately from other temperate climates in the Köppen climate classification system where they are identified by their first letter, a capital D. In the Trewartha climate classification, they are identified as Dc.

==Köppen climate classification==
Continental climate has at least one month averaging below and at least one month averaging above .

* &quot;Dfa&quot; = Hot-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), at least one month&#x27;s average temperature above , and at least four months averaging above . No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).
* &quot;Dfb&quot; = Warm-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), all months with average temperatures below , and at least four months averaging above . No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).
* &quot;Dfc&quot; = Subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below (or ) and one–three months averaging above . No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).
* &quot;Dfd&quot; = Extremely cold subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below and one–three months averaging above . No significant precipitation difference between seasons (neither the abovementioned set of conditions fulfilled).

* &quot;Dwa&quot; = Monsoon-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), at least one month&#x27;s average temperature above , and at least four months averaging above . At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter.
* &quot;Dwb&quot; = Monsoon-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), all months with average temperatures below , and at least four months averaging above . At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter.
* &quot;Dwc&quot; = Monsoon-influenced subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below (or ) and one–three months averaging above . At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter.
* &quot;Dwd&quot; = Monsoon-influenced extremely cold subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below and one–three months averaging above . At least ten times as much rain in the wettest month of summer as in the driest month of winter.

* &quot;Dsa&quot; = Mediterranean-influenced hot-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), average temperature of the warmest month above and at least four months averaging above . At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than .
* &quot;Dsb&quot; = Mediterranean-influenced warm-summer humid continental climate; coldest month averaging below (or ), average temperature of the warmest month below and at least four months averaging above . At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than .
* &quot;Dsc&quot; = Mediterranean-influenced subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below (or ) and one–three months averaging above . At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than .
* &quot;Dsd&quot; = Mediterranean-influenced extremely cold subarctic climate; coldest month averaging below and one–three months averaging above . At least three times as much precipitation in the wettest month of winter as in the driest month of summer, and the driest month of summer receives less than .

==Seasons==
Annual precipitation in this zone is usually between and , The timing of intermediate spring-like or autumn-like temperatures in this zone vary depending on latitude and/or elevation. For example, spring may arrive as soon as March (in Northern hemisphere, September in Southern hemisphere) in the southern (in Northern hemisphere, northern in Southern hemisphere), parts of this zone or as late as May (November) in the north (south). Summers are warm or hot while winters are below freezing and sustain lots of frost.

==Climatology==
Continental climates exist where cold air masses infiltrate during the winter from shorter days and warm air masses form in summer under conditions of high sun and longer days. Places with continental climates are as a rule either far from any moderating effect of oceans or are so situated that prevailing winds tend to head offshore. Such regions get quite warm in the summer, achieving temperatures characteristic of tropical climates but are colder than any other climates of similar latitude in the winter.

==Neighboring climates==
In the Köppen climate system, these climates grade off toward temperate climates equator-ward where winters are less severe and semi-arid climates or arid climates where precipitation becomes inadequate for tall-grass prairies and shrublands. In Europe these climates may grade off into oceanic climates (Cfb) or subpolar oceanic climates (Cfc) in which the influence of cool oceanic air masses is more marked toward the west. In western and eastern Asia, and the central United States these climates grade off toward humid subtropical climates (Cfa/Cwa), subtropical highland climates (Cwb), or Mediterranean climates (Csa/Csb) to the south.

==List of locations with a continental climate==
The climate is continental if the 0 °C coldest-month isotherm is used, but it is temperate if the -3 °C isotherm is used.

<doc id="249618" wikidata="Q17435" url="?curid=249618" title="Same-sex marriage in Belgium">
<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in Belgium since 1 June 2003. A bill for the legalization of same-sex marriages was passed by the Senate on 28 November 2002, and by the Chamber of Representatives on 30 January 2003. King Albert II granted his assent, and the bill entered into force on 1 June. Polling indicates that a significant majority of Belgians support the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Belgium was the second country in the world to legalise same-sex marriage, after the Netherlands.

&quot;Statutory cohabitation&quot;, a form of civil union open to any two legally consenting cohabiting persons, has been available since 1 January 2000.

==Statutory cohabitation==
===Legislative action===
In 1995, a bill was introduced in the Federal Parliament to provide for a legal framework of &quot;cohabitation agreements&quot;. It was mostly intended as a response to the lowering marriage rates rather than giving rights to same-sex couples. In 1998, the bill was changed to &quot;statutory cohabitation&quot; (, ; , ; , ) and finally voted on. The Chamber of Representatives approved it by a 98–10 vote with 32 abstentions and the Senate by a 39–8 vote with 19 abstentions. The &quot;Act establishing statutory cohabitation&quot;, also known as the &quot;Act of 23 November 1998&quot;, amended certain provisions of the Belgian Civil Code and the Belgian Judicial Code to give limited rights to registered same-sex and opposite-sex couples. However, being a couple is not a requirement to make a declaration of statutory cohabitation; relatives can do so too. The law was legally published on 12 January 1999 but would not go into effect until 1 January 2000.

===Statistics===
Since 2010, the number of statutory cohabitations contracted every year has remained relatively constant, numbering around 38,000 new unions per year. In 2019, 40,801 new unions were registered (compared to 44,270 marriages) and 26,301 unions were dissolved (compared to 22,435 divorces). In 2022, same-sex couples accounted for about 4% of all unions.

==Same-sex marriage==
===History===
Same-sex marriage has been legal in Belgium since 1 June 2003, making it the second country in the world to open marriage to same-sex couples, after the Netherlands, and 9 days ahead of the Canadian province of Ontario. Legislation to grant marriage rights to same-sex couples was passed by both chambers of the Federal Parliament in November 2002 and January 2003 with the support of most political parties, and received royal assent on 13 February 2003. In Belgian public discourse, same-sex marriage is commonly known as &quot;marriage for all&quot; or as &quot;homomarriage&quot;.

In the late 1990s, gay rights organisations in Belgium lobbied for the legalization of same-sex marriage. Belgian civil law did not explicitly require that two people be of opposite gender to be able to marry, as this was considered self-evident. Private member&#x27;s bills in the 1990s by Vlaams Blok senators to add this as an explicit requirement were never considered.

====Verhofstadt Government====
The election programmes of the Socialist Party Differently (SP; Flemish Social Democrats), Agalev (Flemish Greens) and the Flemish Liberals and Democrats (VLD; Flemish Liberals) for the 13 June 1999 elections included the aim of legalising same-sex marriage. The Verhofstadt I Government formed after the elections was made up of a coalition of liberal, socialist and green parties and excluded the long-dominant Christian People&#x27;s Party, who lost the elections due to the Dioxin Affair. The coalition agreement included &quot;implementing a full legal partnership scheme&quot; as well as &quot;immediately making the Act of 23 November 1998 enter into force&quot;, which had not been done yet. A royal order signed on 14 December and published on 23 December 1999 made the law on statutory cohabitation go into effect on 1 January 2000.

In 1999, the Socialist Party (PS; French-speaking Social Democrats) and Ecolo (French-speaking Greens) also announced their support for the legalisation of same-sex marriage. At that point, the only remaining party in government that opposed same-sex marriage was the French-speaking Liberal Reformist Party (PRL), which later merged into the Reformist Movement (MR), mainly because it was opposed to adoption rights for same-sex couples. PRL agreed not to block same-sex marriage if adoption rights were excluded. As the first same-sex marriage in the Netherlands was performed on 1 April 2001, the Belgian Government, mostly under the lead of Minister of Health Magda Aelvoet (Agalev), began considering it as well. On 22 June, the Council of Ministers formally approved opening marriage to same-sex couples. In September, the largest opposition party, the Christian People&#x27;s Party, held a party convention where they rebranded into Christian Democratic and Flemish (CD&amp;V), with a renewed party platform, including the aim of legalising same-sex marriage, put forward by their youth wing.

On 30 November 2001, however, the Council of State gave a negative legal opinion on the bill, saying that &quot;marriage is defined as the union of a man and a woman&quot;. LGBT organisations and government ministers criticised the opinion and said they would proceed with the legislation. The Council of Ministers formally approved the government bill on 8 December 2001 and in second reading on 30 January 2002, and submitted it to the Chamber of Representatives on 14 March 2002, where it faced a Justice Committee overloaded with bills to consider. In May 2002, the government bill was withdrawn from the Chamber and instead introduced as a private member&#x27;s bill (which does not require opinions by the Council of State) in the Senate by the group leaders of the majority parties, Jeannine Leduc (VLD), Philippe Mahoux (PS), Philippe Monfils (MR), Myriam Vanlerberghe (SP), Marie Nagy (Ecolo) and Frans Lozie (Agalev).

As Minister Aelvoet resigned on 28 August 2002 and elections were to be held in June 2003, the fate of the bill was unclear. Some politicians also accused Philippe Monfils of deliberately stalling the bill. Nevertheless, new momentum was gained at the start of the new parliamentary year in October 2002. The Senate Justice Committee held hearings and voted 11–4 to approve the bill. It passed in the full Senate on 28 November 2002, with 46 votes to 15 (and 4 abstentions), and on 30 January 2003 the bill passed the Chamber of Representatives by 91 votes to 22 (and 9 abstentions). The Flemish Liberals and Democrats, Christian Democratic and Flemish, the Socialist Party, the Socialist Party Differently, Ecolo, Agalev and the People&#x27;s Union voted generally in favour except for several abstentions, whereas the Vlaams Blok and National Front voted against, the Humanist Democratic Centre voted against with several abstentions and the Reformist Movement voted mostly against.

King Albert II signed and promulgated the bill on 13 February 2003. It was published in the &quot;Belgian Official Gazette&quot; on 28 February and came into force on 1 June.

The first paragraph of article 143 of the Belgian Civil Code (Book I, Title V, Chapter I) now reads as follows:
:* in Dutch: 
:* in French: 
:* in German: 
:: (&quot;Two persons of different sex or of the same sex may contract marriage.&quot;)

The first female couple married on 6 June 2003 and the first male couple on 13 June 2003, both in Kapellen near Antwerp.

In November 2003, opponents of same-sex marriage petitioned the Arbitration Court to invalidate the law as unconstitutional. Their main argument held that treating fundamentally different situations the same way violated the equality principle of the Constitution. In October 2004, the Arbitration Court, nowadays known as the Constitutional Court, rejected the request.

====Subsequent changes====
Originally, Belgium allowed the marriages of foreign same-sex couples only if their country of origin also allowed these unions. A circulaire issued by Minister of Justice Laurette Onkelinx on 23 January 2004, however, permits any couple to marry in Belgium if at least one of the spouses has lived in the country for a minimum of three months. This was codified into the Code of Private International Law, which took effect on 1 October 2004.

The same-sex marriage law did not permit adoption by same-sex partners, and as birth within a same-sex marriage did not imply affiliation, the same-sex spouse of the biological parent had no way to become a legal parent. A proposal to permit adoption was approved 77–62 with 7 abstentions by the Chamber of Representatives on 1 December 2005, and 34–33 with 2 abstentions by the Senate on 20 April 2006. It received royal assent on 18 May and went into force on 30 June 2006.

A legal inequality compared to heterosexual couples still existed with regard to children: the husband of the biological mother is automatically legally recognised as the father (by article 135 of the Civil Code), but this was not the case in a same-sex union for the wife of the mother. To be recognised as the co-mother, she had to complete an adoption procedure. This accounted for the large majority of adoption cases in Belgium. The Di Rupo Government promised to fix this, and in 2014, as the Netherlands had recently passed similar legislation, LGBT organisations pressured the government about their promise. Subsequently, legislators worked to agree on a solution. A bill to this end was approved by the Senate on 3 April 2014 on a 48–2 vote with one abstention, and by the Chamber of Representatives on 23 April on a 114–10 vote with one abstention. The bill received royal assent by King Philippe of Belgium on 5 May and went into effect on 1 January 2015. Since this change, female same-sex couples are treated equally to heterosexual couples: the co-mother married to the mother is automatically recognised as a parent, and an unmarried partner can formally recognise the child at the civil registry. An equivalent solution for male same-sex couples has not been agreed upon, due to the controversy surrounding surrogacy.

===Royal same-sex weddings===
In October 2021, the government confirmed that members of the royal family may enter into a same-sex marriage without having to forfeit the crown or lose their royal titles and privileges or their place in the line of succession. This followed similar announcements concerning other European royal families.

===Statistics===
According to Statistics Belgium, approximately 2,000 same-sex couples were married between June 2003 and December 2004 (874 in 2003 and 1,133 in 2004). This constituted 1.9 percent of the total number of marriages in Belgium during that period, with male couples accounting for about 58% of all same-sex marriages. The share of same-sex marriages among all marriages differs from region to region. In 2023, almost 3.7% of marriages in Brussels, 3.3% in Flanders and 2.9% in Wallonia were same-sex marriages. The province with the lowest rate was Luxembourg (1.9%) and the one with the highest rate was Antwerp (3.8%). The German-speaking Community had an even lower share of same-sex marriages, at 1.7%.

Figures for 2020 are lower than previous years because of the restrictions in place due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

===Religious performance===
The United Protestant Church in Belgium has allowed its congregations to perform same-sex marriages since 2007. Pastors are under no obligation to solemnize same-sex marriages if this would violate their personal beliefs. Solemnizations of same-sex marriages are also possible in the Old Catholic Church of Belgium.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In February 2010, Father Germain Dufour, a former Ecolo parliamentarian, blessed the marriage of a same-sex couple in a Catholic church in Liège, provoking much controversy in Catholic circles. In September 2022, Roman Catholic bishops in Flanders issued a document permitting same-sex unions to be blessed in their churches. The document allows for a ritual which includes a prayer and a final benediction in front of family and friends. It emphasised that while such blessings did not alter the Catholic doctrine on &quot;sacramental marriage,&quot; the move would allow the Church to be &quot;pastorally close to homosexual persons&quot; and a &quot;welcoming [place] that excludes no one.&quot; In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Bishop of Antwerp Johan Bonny welcomed the declaration, saying, &quot;It helps us move forward.&quot;

==Public opinion==
The 2006 Eurobarometer found that 62% of Belgian respondents thought same-sex marriages should be allowed in Europe. A 2008 survey by Delta Lloyd Life found that 76% of Belgians supported same-sex marriage and 46% thought that same-sex couples could raise children just as well as opposite-sex couples. A May 2013 Ipsos poll found that 67% of respondents were in favour of same-sex marriage and another 12% supported another form of recognition for same-sex couples. According to an Ifop poll conducted that same month, 71% of Belgians supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.

The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 77% of Belgians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 20% were opposed. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted between April and August 2017 and published in May 2018, showed that 82% of Belgian people supported same-sex marriage, 10% were opposed and 8% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by religion, 88% of religiously unaffiliated people, 83% of non-practicing Christians and 66% of church-attending Christians supported same-sex marriage. Opposition was 9% among 18–34-year-olds.

The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 82% of Belgians thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 17% were opposed. The 2023 Eurobarometer found that support was 79%, while 19% were opposed. The survey also showed that 80% of Belgians thought that &quot;there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex&quot;, while 18% disagreed.

<doc id="249620" wikidata="Q17447" url="?curid=249620" title="Same-sex marriage in Canada">
<text>Same-sex marriage was progressively introduced in several provinces and territories of Canada by court decisions beginning in 2003 before being legally recognized nationwide with the enactment of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; on July 20, 2005. On June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario issued a decision immediately legalizing same-sex marriage in Ontario, thereby becoming the first province where it was legal. The introduction of a federal gender-neutral marriage definition made Canada the fourth country in the world, and the first country outside Europe, to legally recognize same-sex marriage throughout its borders. Before the federal recognition of same-sex marriage, court decisions had already introduced it in eight out of ten provinces and one of three territories, whose residents collectively made up about 90 percent of Canada&#x27;s population. More than 3,000 same-sex couples had already married in those areas before the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; was passed. In 2023, polling by Pew Research suggested that more than three-quarters of Canadian residents supported the legal recognition of same-sex marriage. Most legal benefits commonly associated with marriage had been extended to cohabiting same-sex couples since 1999.

The &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; was introduced by Prime Minister Paul Martin&#x27;s Liberal minority government to the House of Commons of Canada on February 1, 2005, as &quot;Bill C-38&quot;. It was passed by the House of Commons on June 28, 2005, and by the Senate on July 19, 2005, it received royal assent the following day. Following the 2006 election, which was won by a Conservative minority government under Prime Minister Stephen Harper, the House of Commons defeated a motion to reopen the matter by a vote of 175 to 123 on December 7, 2006, effectively reaffirming the legislation. This was the third vote supporting same-sex marriage taken by three parliaments under three prime ministers.

==Same-sex marriage by province/territory==
Same-sex marriage was legally recognized in the provinces and territories as of the following dates:
*June 10, 2003: Ontario
*July 8, 2003: British Columbia
*March 19, 2004: Quebec
*July 14, 2004: Yukon
*September 16, 2004: Manitoba
*September 24, 2004: Nova Scotia
*November 5, 2004: Saskatchewan
*December 21, 2004: Newfoundland and Labrador
*June 23, 2005: New Brunswick
*July 20, 2005 (&quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;): Alberta, Prince Edward Island, Nunavut and the Northwest Territories

In some of these cases, some marriages were in fact legal at an earlier date (for example, an Ontario ruling held that marriages performed in January 2001 were legal when performed), but the legality was questioned. As of the given dates, the legality was authoritatively established. The decision of the Government of Ontario to recognize two marriages that took place in Toronto on January 14, 2001, retroactively made Canada the first country in the world to have a government-legitimized same-sex marriage (the Netherlands and Belgium, which legalized same-sex marriage before Canada, had their first in April 2001 and June 2003, respectively).

==Overview==
Same-sex marriage was originally recognized by law as a result of cases in which courts in eight out of the ten Canadian provinces, and in one of its three territories, ruled existing bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. Thereafter, many same-sex couples obtained marriage licences in those provinces; like opposite-sex couples, they did not need to be residents of any of those provinces to marry there.

The legal status of same-sex marriages in these jurisdictions created an unusual jurisdictional issue. According to the Constitution of Canada, the definition of marriage is the exclusive responsibility of the federal government; this interpretation was upheld by a December 9, 2004, opinion of the Supreme Court of Canada (&quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot;). Until July 20, 2005, the federal government had not yet passed a law redefining marriage to conform to recent court decisions. Until the passage of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, the previous definition of marriage remained binding in the four jurisdictions (two provinces and two territories) where courts had not yet ruled it unconstitutional, but void in the nine jurisdictions (eight provinces and one territory) where it had been successfully challenged before the courts. Before the enactment of federal legislation recognizing same-sex marriage, therefore, the application of federal marriage law differed depending on the province or territory.

Given the Supreme Court ruling, the role of precedent in Canadian law, and the overall legal climate, it was very likely that any challenges to legalize same-sex marriage in the remaining four jurisdictions would be successful as well. Federal lawyers had ceased to contest such cases, and only Alberta&#x27;s Conservative provincial government remained officially opposed. Premier Ralph Klein threatened to invoke the notwithstanding clause of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; to avoid having to comply with the ruling. Many commentators opined that a province likely could not use the notwithstanding clause to avoid recognizing same-sex marriage because the federal government had jurisdiction over marriage. Alberta Attorney General Ron Stevens agreed with that conclusion, stating: &quot;Since the court ruled the authority over same-sex marriage falls to the federal government, it is only the federal government who can invoke the notwithstanding clause to maintain the traditional definition of marriage.&quot;

On June 17, 2003, Prime Minister Jean Chrétien announced that the government would present a bill to grant same-sex couples equal rights to marry. A draft of what would become &quot;Bill C-38&quot; was released on July 17, 2003, by Justice Minister Martin Cauchon. Before introducing it to Parliament, the Cabinet submitted the bill as a reference to the Supreme Court (&quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot;), asking the court to rule on whether limiting marriage to heterosexual couples was consistent with the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and if same-sex civil unions were an acceptable alternative. On December 9, 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the marriage of same-sex couples is constitutional, that the federal government has the sole authority to amend the definition of marriage, and the &quot;Charter&quot;&#x27;s protection of freedom of religion grants religious institutions the right to refuse to perform marriage ceremonies for same-sex couples.

Following the Supreme Court&#x27;s decision, Justice Minister Irwin Cotler introduced &quot;Bill C-38&quot; on February 1, 2005, to legalize marriage between persons of the same sex across Canada. The government of Prime Minister Paul Martin supported the bill but allowed a free vote by its backbench MPs in the House of Commons. Defeat of the bill in Parliament would have continued the &quot;status quo&quot; and probably incremental legalization, jurisdiction by jurisdiction, via court challenges. This trend could have been reversed only through Parliament passing a new law that explicitly restricted marriage to opposite-sex couples notwithstanding the protection of equality rights afforded by the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; or by amending the Canadian Constitution by inserting the clause &quot;marriage is defined as being between a man and a woman&quot;, as was recommended by several conservative religious groups and politicians. Given the composition of the House of Commons at the time, such a measure would have been very unlikely to pass. Premier Klein proposed putting the question to the public at large via a national referendum, but his suggestion was rejected by all four party leaders.

==History==

===Court rulings===

====Background====
In 1999, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled in &quot;M v H&quot; that same-sex couples in Canada were entitled to receive many of the financial and legal benefits commonly associated with marriage. However, this decision stopped short of giving them the right to full legal marriage. Most laws which affect couples are within provincial rather than federal jurisdiction. As a result, rights varied somewhat from province to province.

On January 14, 2001, Reverend Brent Hawkes forced the issue by performing two same-sex marriages, taking advantage of the fact that Ontario law authorizes him to perform marriages without a previous license, via the issuance of banns of marriage. The registrar refused to accept the records of marriage, and a lawsuit was commenced over whether the marriages were legally performed. In other provinces, lawsuits were launched seeking permission to marry.

In 2002 and 2003, decisions in the superior trial courts of Ontario and Quebec, &quot;Halpern v Canada (AG)&quot; and &quot;Hendricks and Leboeuf v. Quebec&quot;, held that the restriction of marriage to opposite-sex couples was discriminatory and contrary to the equality clause of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights of Freedoms&quot;, while the Supreme Court of British Columbia ruled oppositely. On May 1, 2003, the British Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the superior court decision. The courts in each case suspended the effect of the declarations of invalidity for two years, to allow the federal government to consider legislative responses to the rulings. However, on June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled on an appeal in the &quot;Halpern&quot; case. The court agreed with the lower court that the heterosexual definition of marriage was discriminatory and that same-sex marriage was legally permitted. However, unlike the previous three court decisions, the Court of Appeal did not suspend its decision to allow Parliament to consider the issue. Instead, it ruled that the 2001 marriages were legal and same-sex marriage was available throughout Ontario immediately. The federal government had appealed the trial decisions to the provincial courts of appeal, but following the decision on the Ontario Court of Appeal, Prime Minister Chrétien announced on June 17, 2003, that the federal government would not seek to appeal the decisions to the Supreme Court. Instead, it would propose a draft &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; and refer it to the Supreme Court for an advisory opinion.

====Ontario decision====
In 2003, the couples in &quot;Halpern v. Canada&quot; appealed the decision, requesting that the decision take effect immediately instead of after a delay. On June 10, 2003, the Court of Appeal for Ontario confirmed that current Canadian law on marriage violated the equality provisions in the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; in being restricted to heterosexual couples. The court did not allow the province any grace time to bring its laws in line with the ruling, making Ontario the first jurisdiction in North America to recognize same-sex marriage. The city of Toronto announced that the city clerk would begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples. The first same-sex couple to marry, just hours after the Court of Appeal decision, were Michael Leshner and Michael Stark, long-time advocates for marriage equality for same-sex couples who had been litigants and intervenors in various court cases addressing the issue, including the Court of Appeal decision. The next day, Attorney General Norm Sterling announced that his government would comply with the ruling. The court also ruled that Kevin Bourassa and Joe Varnell, and Elaine and Anne Vautour, two same-sex couples who were married on January 14, 2001, at a wedding ceremony in the Metropolitan Community Church of Toronto following an ancient common-law procedure called the reading of the banns, would be considered legally married.

On September 13, 2004, the Ontario Court of Appeal declared the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; also unconstitutional for excluding same-sex marriages. It ordered same-sex marriages read into that act, permitting the plaintiffs, a lesbian couple, to divorce.

====British Columbia decision====
A ruling, quite similar to the Ontario ruling, was issued by the British Columbia Court of Appeal on July 8, 2003. Another decision in British Columbia in May of that year had required the federal government to change the law to permit same-sex marriages, &quot;Barbeau v. British Columbia&quot;. The July ruling stated that &quot;any further delay... will result in an unequal application of the law between Ontario and British Columbia&quot;. A few hours after the announcement, Antony Porcino and Tom Graff became the first two men to be legally wed in British Columbia.

====Quebec decision====

On March 19, 2004, the Quebec Court of Appeal ruled similarly to the Ontario and British Columbia courts, upholding &quot;Hendricks and Leboeuf v. Quebec&quot; and ordering that it take effect immediately. The couple who brought the suit, Michael Hendricks and René Leboeuf, immediately sought a marriage licence; the usual 20-day waiting period was waived, and they were wed on April 1 at the Palais de justice in Montreal.

Given the populations of Ontario, British Columbia and Quebec, more than two-thirds of Canada&#x27;s population lived in provinces where same-sex marriage had been legalized after the Quebec decision.

====Yukon decision====
On July 14, 2004, in &quot;Dunbar &amp; Edge v. Yukon (Government of) &amp; Canada (A.G.)&quot;, the Supreme Court of Yukon issued another similar ruling with immediate effect. Rather than reproducing the &quot;Charter&quot; equality arguments used by the other courts, the court ruled that since the provincial courts of appeal had ruled that the heterosexual definition of marriage was unconstitutional, it was unconstitutional across Canada. The position was strengthened by the Attorney General&#x27;s refusal to appeal those rulings. It further ruled that to continue to restrict marriages in Yukon to opposite-sex couples would result in an unacceptable state of a provision&#x27;s being in force in one jurisdiction and not another.

On August 16, 2004, Justice Minister Irwin Cotler indicated that the federal government would no longer oppose court cases to implement same-sex marriage in the provinces and territories.

====Manitoba decision====

On September 16, 2004, Justice Douglas Yard of the Manitoba Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench declared the then-current definition of marriage unconstitutional. The judge said that his decision had been influenced by the previous decisions in British Columbia, Ontario and Quebec. This decision followed suits brought by three couples in Manitoba requesting that they be issued marriage licences. Both the provincial and federal governments had made it known that they would not oppose the court bid. One of the couples, Chris Vogel and Richard North, had legally sought the right to marry in a high-profile case in 1974, but had been denied.

====Nova Scotia decision====
In August 2004, three couples in Nova Scotia brought suit in &quot;Boutilier et al. v. Canada (A.G) and Nova Scotia (A.G)&quot; against the provincial government requesting that it issue marriage licences to same-sex couples. On September 24, 2004, Justice Heather Robertson of the Nova Scotia Supreme Court ruled the then-current law unconstitutional. Neither the federal nor the provincial governments opposed the ruling.

====Saskatchewan decision====
Five couples brought suit in Saskatchewan for the recognition of their marriage in a case that was heard by the Saskatchewan Court of Queen&#x27;s Bench in chambers on November 3, 2004. On November 5, 2004, the judge ruled that excluding same-sex couples from marriage violated the &quot;Charter&quot;&#x27;s right to equality and that the common-law definition was discriminatory, thereby bringing same-sex marriage to Saskatchewan.

====Newfoundland and Labrador decision====
Two lesbian couples brought suit on November 4, 2004, to have Newfoundland and Labrador recognize same-sex marriage. As with the previous decisions, the provincial government did not oppose the suit; moreover, the federal government actually supported it. The case went to trial on December 20 and the next day, Justice Derek Green ordered the provincial government to begin issuing marriage licences to same-sex couples, an order with which the provincial government announced it would comply.

====New Brunswick decision====
Two same-sex couples in New Brunswick brought suit in April 2005 to request an order requiring the provincial government to issue them marriage licences. This was granted in June 2005. Premier Bernard Lord, who personally opposed same-sex marriage, pledged to follow a directive to provide for same-sex marriages from the courts or from Parliament.

====Proceedings in the Northwest Territories====
On May 20, 2005, a gay male couple with a daughter brought suit in the Northwest Territories for the right to marry. Territorial Justice Minister Charles Dent had previously said that the government would not contest such a lawsuit. The case was to be heard on May 27 but ended when the federal government legalized same-sex marriage.

===Discussion in Parliament, 1995–2003===
The shift in Canadian attitudes towards acceptance of same-sex marriage and recent court rulings caused the Parliament of Canada to reverse its position on the issue. On September 18, 1995, the House of Commons voted 124 to 52 to reject a motion introduced by openly gay member of Parliament Réal Ménard calling for the legal recognition of same-sex relationships. A 2006 study by Mark W. Lehman suggested that between 1997 and 2004, Canadian public opinion on legalizing same-sex marriage underwent a dramatic shift, moving from minority support to majority support and that this support was the result of a significant shift in positive feelings towards gays and lesbians.

The first bill to legalize same-sex marriage was a private member&#x27;s bill tabled in the House of Commons by New Democratic MP Svend Robinson on March 25, 1998. Like most private members&#x27; bills, it did not progress past first reading, and was reintroduced in several subsequent parliaments. In 1999, the House of Commons overwhelmingly passed a resolution to re-affirm the definition of marriage as &quot;the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others&quot;. The following year, this definition of marriage was included in the revised &quot;Bill C-23&quot;, the &quot;Modernization of Benefits and Obligations Act 2000&quot; (), which continued to bar same-sex couples from full marriage rights. In early 2003, the issue once again resurfaced, and the House of Commons Standing Committee on Justice and Human Rights proceeded to undertake a formal study of same-sex marriage, including a cross-country series of public hearings. Just after the Ontario court decision, it voted to recommend that the federal government not appeal the ruling.

Civil status is of provincial jurisdiction in Canada. However, the definition of marriage is a matter of federal jurisdiction. On June 17, 2003, Prime Minister Chrétien announced that the government would not appeal the Ontario ruling, and that his government would introduce legislation to recognize same-sex marriage but protect the rights of religious groups to decide which marriages they would solemnize.

A draft of the bill was issued on July 17. It read:
#Marriage, for civil purposes, is the lawful union of two persons to the exclusion of all others.
#Nothing in this Act affects the freedom of officials of religious groups to refuse to perform marriages that are not in accordance with their religious beliefs.

The draft bill was subsequently referred to the Supreme Court of Canada.

On September 16, 2003, a motion was brought to Parliament by the Canadian Alliance (now the Conservative Party) to once again reaffirm the heterosexual definition of marriage. The same language that had been passed in 1999 was brought to a conscience vote, with members asked to vote for or against the 1999 definition of marriage as &quot;the union of one man and one woman to the exclusion of all others&quot;. Motions are not legislatively binding in Canada, and are mostly done for symbolic purposes. The September vote was extremely divisive, however. Prime Minister Chrétien reversed his previous stance and voted against the motion, as did Paul Martin (who later became prime minister) and many other prominent Liberals. Several Liberals retained their original stance, however, and thus the vote was not defined purely along party lines. Controversially, over 30 members of the House did not attend the vote, the majority of whom were Liberals who had voted against legalizing same-sex marriage in 1999. In the end, the motion was narrowly rejected by a vote of 137–132.

===Supreme Court &quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot;===

In 2003, the Liberal government referred a draft bill on same-sex marriage to the Supreme Court of Canada, essentially asking it to review the bill&#x27;s constitutionality before it was introduced. The reference, as originally posed by the Chrétien government, asked three questions:
#Is the annexed Proposal for an Act respecting certain aspects of legal capacity for marriage for civil purposes within the exclusive legislative authority of the Parliament of Canada? If not, in what particular or particulars, and to what extent?
#If the answer to question 1 is yes, is section 1 of the proposal, which extends capacity to marry to persons of the same sex, consistent with the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;? If not, in what particular or particulars, and to what extent?
#Does the freedom of religion guaranteed by paragraph 2(a) of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; protect religious officials from being compelled to perform a marriage between two persons of the same sex that is contrary to their religious beliefs?

The government of Prime Minister Martin later added a fourth question in January 2004:
The addition of a fourth question considerably delayed the opening of the court reference until well after the June 2004 general election, raising accusations of stalling. In its hearings that began in October 2004, the Supreme Court of Canada accused the government of using the court for other goals when it declined to appeal rulings that altered the definition of marriage in several provinces; &quot;Justice Ian Binnie said it &#x27;may not fulfill any useful purpose&#x27; to examine traditional marriage all over again, &#x27;given the policy decision of the government&#x27;&quot;. The Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the government has the authority to amend the definition of marriage but did not rule on whether or not such a change is required by the equality provisions of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;. The court stated that such a ruling is not necessary because the federal government had accepted the rulings of provincial courts to the effect that the change was required. The court also ruled that given the freedom of religion provisions in the &quot;Charter&quot;, and the wording of provincial human rights codes, it was highly unlikely that religious institutions could be compelled to perform same-sex marriages, though because solemnization of marriage is a matter for provincial governments, the proposed bill could not actually guarantee such protections.

===Debate prior to C-38&#x27;s introduction===
On December 9, 2004, Prime Minister Martin indicated that the federal government would introduce legislation expanding marriage to same-sex couples. The government&#x27;s decision was announced immediately following the court&#x27;s answer in the &quot;Reference Re Same-Sex Marriage&quot; reference question. The parliamentary bill caused rifts in the House of Commons, especially among the governing Liberals. Many Liberal MPs indicated that they would oppose the government&#x27;s position in favour of same-sex marriage at a free vote. The majority of each of the Liberal Party, the New Democratic Party and the Bloc Québécois voted in favour of the bill; the majority of the Conservative Party voted against the bill.

In 2000, Alberta had amended its &quot;Marriage Act&quot; to define marriage as being between &quot;a man and a woman&quot;. The law included a notwithstanding clause in an attempt to protect the amendment from being invalidated under the &quot;Charter&quot;. However, the amendment was invalid since, under the Canadian Constitution, the definition of marriage is a federal right.

Complicating matters, Conservative Party leader Stephen Harper indicated that a Conservative government would work to restore the prohibition on same-sex marriage if Parliament voted to do so in a free vote. Following the court decision on December 9, Premier Ralph Klein of Alberta suggested that a national referendum be held on same-sex marriage, a measure Prime Minister Martin rejected.

===Legislative progress of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;===
&quot;Bill C-38&quot;, the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; (), was introduced to Parliament for its first reading in the House of Commons on February 1, 2005. Prime Minister Martin launched the debate on February 16. The bill passed second reading on May 4 and third reading on June 28, with votes of 164–137 and 158–133, respectively. It then moved to the Senate, and received its first reading on June 29. Debate was launched on July 4, and a Liberal closure motion limited debate on the bill to only four hours. Second reading and committing the bill occurred on July 6, with a vote of 43–12. The Senate passed the legislation on third reading by a margin of 47 to 21 on July 19, 2005. It received royal assent at the hand of Beverley McLachlin (in her capacity as the Deputy of the Governor General of Canada) on July 20, 2005.

===Same-sex marriage in the 39th Parliament===
The Conservative Party, led by Harper, won a minority government in the federal election on January 23, 2006. Harper had campaigned on the promise of holding a conscience vote on a motion to re-open the debate on same-sex marriage. The motion would re-open the same-sex marriage debate, but did not prescribe restoring the opposite-sex definition of marriage. A news report from CTV News on May 31, 2006, showed that a growing number of Conservatives were wary about re-opening the debate on same-sex marriage. One cabinet minister stated he just wanted the issue &quot;to go away&quot;, while others including Chuck Strahl and Bill Casey were undecided, instead of directly opposed. Foreign Affairs Minister Peter MacKay noted that not a single constituent had approached him on the issue, and Minister for Fisheries and Oceans Loyola Hearn was against re-opening the debate.

By November 2006, the debate had shifted and it was the supporters of same-sex marriage that were arguing for a fall vote on the issue and the opponents who were lobbying for a delay. On December 6, 2006, the government brought in a motion asking if the issue of same-sex marriage debate should be re-opened. This motion was defeated the next day in a vote of 175 (nays) to 123 (yeas). Prime Minister Harper afterwards told reporters, &quot;I don&#x27;t see reopening this question in the future.&quot;

===Recognition of foreign legal unions===
In &quot;Hincks v. Gallardo&quot;, the Ontario Superior Court of Justice decided on January 7, 2013, that same-sex partners who entered into civil partnerships in the United Kingdom are to be treated as married for the purposes of Canadian law.

===Marriage statistics===
From June 2003 (date of the first same-sex marriages in Ontario) to October 2006, 12,438 same-sex marriages were contracted in Canada.
By 2011, 21,015 same-sex marriages had been performed in Canada, with an additional 43,560 cohabiting same-sex couples. According to the 2016 census, there were 72,880 same-sex couples residing in Canada, of which 24,370 (33.4 per cent) were married. In British Columbia, 38.5 per cent of all same-sex couples were married, compared to 38.2 per cent in Ontario and 22.5 per cent in Quebec. 10,020 children were living in same-sex families.

==Other same-sex partner benefits in Canada==

===Other kinds of partnership===

Canadian cohabiting same-sex couples are entitled to many of the same legal and financial benefits as married opposite-sex couples. In 1999, after the court case of &quot;M v H&quot;, the Supreme Court of Canada declared that same-sex partners must also be extended the rights and benefits of common-law relationships.

The province of Quebec also offers civil unions to same-sex couples. Nova Scotia&#x27;s domestic partnerships offer similar benefits. Legislative changes between 2001 and 2004 extended the benefits of common-law relationships in Manitoba to same-sex couples as well as those of different sex. In 2003, Alberta passed a law recognizing adult interdependent relationships. These relationships provide specific financial benefits to interdependent adults, including blood relations.

===Recognition in other provinces and territories===
The legal status of same-sex marriages in provinces and territories that did not perform them was uncertain prior to the passage of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;. One of the couples that brought suit in Nova Scotia acted so that their Ontario marriage would be recognized.

Premier Ralph Klein wanted to prevent same-sex marriages from being performed or recognized in Alberta, but eventually admitted that the province&#x27;s chances of doing so were slim to none, and said Alberta would obey the legislation. By contrast, the other remaining province without same-sex marriage, Prince Edward Island, announced that it would voluntarily bring its laws into compliance with the federal legislation.

In October 2003, Premier Paul Okalik announced that Nunavut would recognize same-sex marriages performed in other provinces and territories.

===Immigration===
Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) acknowledges same-sex marriages contracted in Canada between immigration applicants and Canadian citizens or permanent residents. Canadians may also sponsor their same-sex common-law or civil union partners for family-class immigration, provided they meet various requirements, including proof of legitimacy and cohabitation for at least one year.

After the enactment of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;, IRCC adopted an interim immigration policy which did not recognize same-sex marriages conducted outside of Canada. For example, a Canadian citizen, legally married in the Netherlands to his or her same-sex Dutch partner, could not sponsor his or her Dutch partner for immigration as a spouse, despite the fact that both Dutch law and Canadian law made no distinction between opposite-sex and same-sex civil marriages, and despite the fact that IRCC did recognize a Dutch opposite-sex marriage.

On December 12, 2006, New Democratic Party MP Bill Siksay introduced a motion in the House of Commons of Canada Standing Committee on Citizenship and Immigration calling on the IRCC to immediately rescind the interim policy and &quot;recognize legal marriages of gay and lesbian couples performed in jurisdictions outside Canada for purposes of immigration in exactly the same way as the legal marriages of heterosexual couples are recognized&quot;; the committee voted to recommend that the government do this. In late January 2007, Citizenship and Immigration Minister Diane Finley informed the committee that this would be done. In February 2007, the IRCC website was updated to reflect the fact that the policy had been updated.

===Military===

Since September 2003, military chaplains have been allowed to bless same-sex unions and to perform these ceremonies on a military base.

===Survivor benefits===
On December 19, 2003, an Ontario court ruled that survivor benefits for Canadians whose same-sex partners died should be retroactive to April 1985, the date the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; came into effect. The federal government appealed. On March 1, 2007, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government must pay Canada Pension Plan benefits to surviving same-sex spouses. Initial news reports indicated that the court limited retroactive benefits to only 12 months&#x27; worth, but in fact, some survivors may be entitled to benefits dating back to 2000.

==Same-sex divorce in Canada==
On September 13, 2004, a lesbian couple known as &quot;M.M.&quot; and &quot;J.H.&quot; (the initials of their respective lawyers) in Ontario were granted Canada&#x27;s first same-sex divorce. Their initial divorce application had been denied based on the fact that the federal &quot;Divorce Act&quot; () defined spouse as &quot;either of a man or a woman who are married to each other&quot;. However, Madam Justice Ruth Mesbur of the Ontario Superior Court of Justice ruled in &quot;M.M. v J.H&quot; that the definition of &quot;spouse&quot; in the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; was unconstitutional. In June 2005, a lesbian couple residing in British Columbia obtained a similar ruling.

The &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; in 2005 amended the &quot;Divorce Act&quot; to permit same-sex divorce. However, prior to 2013, a married couple (same-sex or opposite-sex) could file for divorce in Canada only if at least one spouse was then residing in Canada and had been for at least one full year when the divorce was filed.

In 2012, after the Attorney General of Canada, Rob Nicholson, suggested in a divorce case brought in the Ontario Superior Court of Justice that non-residents of Canada did not have valid marriages if such marriages were not recognized by their home jurisdictions, the Conservative government announced that they would fix this &quot;legislative gap&quot;. A government bill, the &quot;Civil Marriage of Non-residents Act&quot; (), positively declaring such marriages legal in Canada and allowing non-residents to divorce in a Canadian court if prohibited from doing so in their home jurisdictions, was introduced and received first reading on February 17, 2012, and passed third and final reading on June 18, 2013. The bill then received a quick passage through the Senate and passed third and final reading on June 21, receiving royal assent by Governor General David Johnston on June 26. The law came into effect on August 14 by Order of the Governor General in Council made the previous day.

==Church and state==
Based on the 2001 census, 80 per cent of the Canadian population were initiated into one of the three main Abrahamic religions (Judaism, Islam, and Christianity). All three have texts interpreted by some to declare sexual relations between people of the same sex as forbidden and sinful, and have been opposed to the recognition of same-sex unions. However, some major religious groups spoke in favour of legalizing same-sex marriage. The largest Protestant denomination in the country, the United Church of Canada, offers church weddings to same-sex couples and supports same-sex marriages, testifying to this effect during the cross-country Justice Committee hearings. Unitarian Universalist congregations also solemnize same-sex marriages, as do the Religious Society of Friends (Quakers), the Metropolitan Community Church and the Evangelical Lutheran Church in Canada. Some progressive Jewish congregations have also supported same-sex marriage.

The General Synod of the Anglican Church of Canada passed an initial motion in July 2016 to perform same-sex marriages in their churches. The measure had to be approved a second time at the next General Synod in 2019 to come into force. The Anglican Church of Canada does not specifically prohibit same-sex marriage. On July 12, 2019, the General Synod did not approve the motion at its second reading. In spite of support by the laity and clergy, the motion did not pass because it was not supported by a full two-thirds of the bishops. Director of Communications Meghan Kilty said that many dioceses have been performing same-sex marriages, including the dioceses of Toronto, Ottawa, British Columbia and others. Kilty added that many dioceses would continue to perform such services since there is no specific prohibition by the Church.

In July 2003, the hierarchy of the Catholic Church in Canada protested the government&#x27;s plans to include same-sex couples in civil marriage. This was significant because Catholicism has a larger number of adherents in Canada than any other religion or denomination, with 43.6 per cent of the population identifying themselves as Catholic in 2005. The church criticisms were accompanied by Vatican claims that Catholic politicians should vote according to their personal beliefs rather than the policy of the government. Amid a subsequent backlash in opinion, the Church remained remarkably quiet on the subject, at least in public, until late 2004, when two Catholic bishops clearly stated their opposition to same-sex marriage. The Bishop of Calgary, Frederick Henry, in a pastoral letter urged Catholics to fight against the legalization of same-sex marriage, calling homosexual behaviour &quot;an evil act&quot;. Bishop Henry&#x27;s letter also seemed to urge the outlawing of homosexual acts, saying, &quot;Since homosexuality, adultery, prostitution and pornography undermine the foundations of the family, the basis of society, then the State must use its coercive power to proscribe or curtail them in the interests of the common good.&quot; Two human rights complaints were filed against Henry soon afterwards under the &quot;Alberta Human Rights Act&quot;, one of which was dropped at the conciliation stage.

The Hutterite Brethren spoke out against same-sex marriage in a letter written to Prime Minister Martin in February 2005. The group has historically not involved themselves with politics. The Humanist Association of Canada, which endorses a non-theistic, non-religious ethical philosophy to life and full separation of church and state, has been supportive of same-sex marriage. Local affiliate groups of the Humanist Association offer officiancy services across Canada. Representatives of the World Sikh Organization testified before the Senate Committee on Legal and Constitutional Affairs in favour of the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot;.

==Public opinion==
A 1996 Angus Reid Institute/&quot;Southam News&quot; opinion poll, conducted across Canada, found that 49 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage, while 47 per cent were opposed. Support was highest in Quebec (58 per cent) and among 18–34-year-olds (67 per cent), and lowest in Alberta (38 per cent) and people over the age of 54 (25 per cent). In 1999, the group found support at 53 per cent with 44 per cent opposed.

An April 2001 Environics Research Group survey showed that 45 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage (29 per cent &quot;strongly&quot; and 16 per cent &quot;somewhat&quot;), while 41 per cent opposed (30 per cent &quot;strongly&quot; and 11 per cent &quot;somewhat&quot;). A June 2002 survey conducted by Focus on the Family Canada, a group opposed to same-sex marriage, found that 46 per cent of Canadians agreed same-sex marriage should be legalized whereas 44 per cent disagreed. A poll conducted by the Centre for Research and Information on Canada in October 2002 showed that 53 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage, while 41 per cent were opposed. A November 2002 Ekos/CBC poll asked respondents if they would vote &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot; in a referendum on the issue of same-sex marriage. 47 per cent answered &quot;no&quot; and 45 per cent answered &quot;yes&quot;, while 8 per cent did not know.

A 2005 opinion poll taken shortly before Parliament voted on the &quot;Civil Marriage Act&quot; found that 42 per cent of Canadians favoured the nationwide legalization of same-sex marriage, while 40 per cent were opposed and 18 per cent did not respond or were undecided. A June 2006 poll conducted by Ekos asked respondents if the debate on same-sex marriage should be reopened. 62 per cent considered same-sex marriage settled, 27 per cent wanted to reopen the issue, and 11 per cent either had no opinion or did not respond.

In 2012, a poll by Forum Research showed that 66.4 per cent of Canadians approved of legalized same-sex marriage, while 33.6 per cent were opposed. Support for same-sex marriage was highest in Quebec (72 per cent) and British Columbia (70.2 per cent), while lowest in Alberta (45.6 per cent). A May 2013 Ipsos poll of residents of 16 countries found that 63 per cent of respondents in Canada were in favour of same-sex marriage and another 13 per cent supported other forms of recognition for same-sex couples.

After same-sex marriage in the United States was legalized by their Supreme Court in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in June 2015, a poll by Forum Research showed that 70 per cent of Canadians approved of same-sex marriage, while 22 per cent disapproved.

In May 2016, members of the Conservative Party of Canada voted 1,036–462 to change the party&#x27;s political platform from defining marriage as &quot;a union between one man and one woman&quot; to a neutral stance. As a compromise, the party did not elect to support the right to same-sex marriage, allowing members &quot;the freedom to hold personal opinions against same-sex marriage&quot;.

A 2017 CROP poll showed that 74 per cent of Canadians found it &quot;great that in Canada, two people of the same sex can get married&quot;, while 26 per cent disagreed. Support for same-sex marriage was higher among women (79 per cent) than men (70 per cent) and higher among French speakers (82 per cent) than English speakers (73 per cent). Those with a higher income, a university degree or who were born in Canada were also more likely to support same-sex marriage. When divided by age, young people were overwhelmingly in support (82 per cent among 18–24-year-olds and 86 per cent among 25–34-year-olds) and, while people over 65 were less likely to be in favour, same-sex marriage still enjoyed 66 per cent popular support among people of that age group. The most supportive province was Quebec (80 per cent), followed by 78 per cent in the four Atlantic provinces, 75 per cent in British Columbia, 73 per cent in Ontario, 70 per cent in Manitoba and Saskatchewan and 68 per cent in Alberta. The 2017 AmericasBarometer showed that 76 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage. A 2020 Research Co. poll found that 67 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage remaining legal. A 2022 Research Co. poll found that number had remained quite stable, at 66 per cent.

A Pew Research Center poll conducted between February and May 2023 showed that 79 per cent of Canadians supported same-sex marriage, 15 per cent were opposed and 6 per cent did not know or refused to answer. When divided by political affiliation, support was highest among those on the left and the centre of the political spectrum at 85 per cent, followed by those on the right at 71 per cent.

<doc id="249623" wikidata="Q17476" url="?curid=249623" title="Same-sex marriage in the United States">
<text>The availability of legally recognized same-sex marriage in the United States expanded from one state (Massachusetts) in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015 through various court rulings, state legislation, and direct popular votes. States each have separate marriage laws, which must adhere to rulings by the Supreme Court of the United States that recognize marriage as a fundamental right guaranteed by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, as first established in the 1967 landmark civil rights case of &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot;.

Civil rights campaigning in support of marriage without distinction as to sex or sexual orientation began in the 1970s. In 1972, the now overturned &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot; saw the Supreme Court of the United States decline to become involved. The issue became prominent from around 1993, when the Supreme Court of Hawaii ruled in &quot;Baehr v. Lewin&quot; that it was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Hawaii for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. That ruling led to federal and state actions to explicitly abridge marriage on the basis of sex in order to prevent the marriages of same-sex couples from being recognized by law, the most prominent of which was the 1996 federal Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA). In 2003, the Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; that it was unconstitutional under the Constitution of Massachusetts for the state to abridge marriage on the basis of sex. From 2004 through to 2015, as the tide of public opinion continued to move towards support of same-sex marriage, various state court rulings, state legislation, direct popular votes (referendums and initiatives), and federal court rulings established same-sex marriage in thirty-six of the fifty states.

The most prominent supporters of same-sex marriage are human rights and civil rights organizations, while the most prominent opponents are religious groups, though some religious organizations support marriage equality. The first two decades of the 21st century saw same-sex marriage receive support from prominent figures in the civil rights movement, including Coretta Scott King, John Lewis, Julian Bond, and Mildred Loving. In May 2012, the NAACP, the leading African-American civil rights organization, declared its support for same-sex marriage and stated that it is a civil right.

In June 2013, the Supreme Court of the United States struck down DOMA for violating the Fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution in the landmark civil rights case of &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, leading to federal recognition of same-sex marriage, with federal benefits for married couples connected to either the state of residence or the state in which the marriage was solemnized. In June 2015, the Supreme Court ruled in the landmark civil rights case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; that the fundamental right of same-sex couples to marry on the same terms and conditions as opposite-sex couples, with all the accompanying rights and responsibilities, is guaranteed by both the Due Process Clause and the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. On December 13, 2022, DOMA was repealed and replaced by the Respect for Marriage Act, which recognizes and protects same-sex and interracial marriages under federal law and in interstate relations.

Gallup found that nationwide public support for same-sex marriage reached 50% in 2011, 60% in 2015, and 70% in 2021. In the 2020 United States census, same-sex married couples accounted for 0.5% of all U.S. households while unmarried same-sex couples accounted for 0.4% of all U.S. households.

A study of nationwide data from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teens, with the effect being concentrated among teens of a minority sexual orientation, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer teens attempting suicide each year in the United States.

==History==

The history of same-sex marriage in the United States dates from the early 1970s, when the first lawsuits seeking legal recognition of same-sex relationships brought the question of civil marriage rights and benefits for same-sex couples to public attention, though they proved unsuccessful. The subject became increasingly prominent in U.S. politics following the 1993 Hawaii Supreme Court decision in &quot;Baehr v. Miike&quot; that suggested the possibility that the state&#x27;s prohibition might be unconstitutional. That decision was met by actions at both the federal and state level to restrict marriage to male-female couples, notably the enactment at the federal level of the &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; (DOMA).

On May 17, 2004, Massachusetts became the first U.S. state and the sixth jurisdiction in the world to legalize same-sex marriage following the Supreme Judicial Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot; six months earlier. Just as with the Hawaii decision, the legalization of same-sex marriage in Massachusetts provoked a reaction from opponents that resulted in further legal restrictions being written into state statutes and constitutions. On August 4, 2004, a Washington jurist became the first trial judge in the nation to rule a state defense of marriage act unconstitutional in Andersen v. King County; the King County Superior Court ruling was narrowly overturned on appeal in 2006. The movement to obtain marriage rights for same-sex couples expanded steadily from that time until, in late 2014, lawsuits had been brought in every state that still denied marriage licenses to same-sex couples. 

By late 2014, same-sex marriage had become legal in states that contained more than 70% of the United States population. In some jurisdictions, legalization came through the action of state courts or the enactment of state legislation. More frequently, it came as the result of the decisions of federal courts. On November 6, 2012, Maine, Maryland, and Washington became the first states to legalize same-sex marriage through popular vote. Same-sex marriage had been legalized in the District of Columbia and 21 Native American tribal nations as well.

The June 2013 decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; striking down the law barring federal recognition of same-sex marriage gave significant impetus to the progress of lawsuits that challenged state bans on same-sex marriage in federal court. Since that decision, with only a few exceptions, U.S. District Courts and Courts of Appeals have found state bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, as have several state courts. The exceptions have been a state court in Tennessee, U.S. district courts in Louisiana and Puerto Rico, and the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear appeals from that circuit&#x27;s decision.

On June 26, 2015, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage, legalized it in all fifty states, and required states to honor out-of-state same-sex marriage licenses in the case &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;. The United States was the seventeenth country in the world and the second in North America after Canada, to allow same-sex couples to marry nationwide.

==Legal issues==

The legal issues surrounding same-sex marriage in the United States are determined by the nation&#x27;s federal system of government, in which the status of a person, including marital status, is determined in large measure by the individual states. Prior to 1996, the federal government did not define marriage; any marriage recognized by a state was recognized, even if that marriage was not recognized by one or more states, as was the case until 1967 with interracial marriage, which some states banned by statute.

Prior to 2004, same-sex marriage was not performed or recognized in any U.S. jurisdiction, but subsequently began to be performed and recognized by law in different jurisdictions through legislation, court rulings, tribal council rulings, and popular referendums.

The Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; ended all inter-state legal complications surrounding same-sex marriage, as it orders states to both perform the marriages of same-sex couples and to recognize the marriages of same-sex couples performed in other states.

===Federal law===
According to the Government Accountability Office (GAO) in 2004, 1,138 federal rights and protections are conferred to U.S. citizens upon marriage; areas affected include Social Security benefits, veterans&#x27; benefits, health insurance, Medicaid, hospital visitation, estate taxes, retirement savings, pensions, family leave, and immigration law.

Since July 9, 2015, married same-sex couples throughout the United States have had equal access to all the federal benefits that married opposite-sex couples have.

The &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; (DOMA) was enacted in 1996. DOMA&#x27;s Section 2 says that no state needs to recognize the legal validity of a same-sex relationship even if recognized as marriage by another state. It purports to relieve a state of its reciprocal obligation to honor the laws of other states as required by the Constitution&#x27;s Full Faith and Credit Clause. Even before DOMA, however, states sometimes refused to recognize a marriage from another jurisdiction if it was counter to its &quot;strongly held public policies&quot;. Most lawsuits that sought to require a state to recognize a marriage established in another jurisdiction argue on the basis of equal protection and due process, not the Full Faith and Credit Clause.

DOMA&#x27;s Section 3 defined marriage for the purposes of federal law as a union of one man and one woman. It was challenged in the federal courts. On July 8, 2010, Judge Joseph Tauro of the District Court of Massachusetts held that the denial of federal rights and benefits to lawfully married Massachusetts same-sex couples is unconstitutional under the Equal Protection Clause of the U.S. Constitution. Beginning in 2010, eight federal courts found DOMA Section 3 unconstitutional in cases involving bankruptcy, public employee benefits, estate taxes, and immigration. On October 18, 2012, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals became the first court to hold sexual orientation to be a quasi-suspect classification and applied intermediate scrutiny to strike down Section 3 of DOMA as unconstitutional in &quot;Windsor v. United States&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled in &quot;Windsor&quot; on June 26, 2013, that Section 3 violated the Fifth Amendment.

As a result of the &quot;Windsor&quot; decision, married same-sex couples—regardless of domicile—have federal tax benefits (including the ability to file joint federal income tax returns), military benefits, federal employment benefits, and immigration benefits. In February 2014, the Justice Department expanded federal recognition of same-sex marriages to include bankruptcies, prison visits, survivor benefits and refusing to testify against a spouse. Likewise in June 2014, family medical leave benefits under the &quot;Family Medical Leave Act 1975&quot; were extended to married same-sex couples. With respect to social security and veterans benefits, same-sex married couples are eligible for full benefits from the Veterans Affairs (VA) and the Social Security Administration (SSA). Prior to the Supreme Court&#x27;s ruling in &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; on June 26, 2015, the VA and SSA could provide only limited benefits to married same-sex couples living in states where same-sex marriage was not legal. Effective March 27, 2015, the definition of spouse under the &quot;Family and Medical Leave Act of 1993&quot; includes employees in a same-sex marriage regardless of state of residence. Following the &quot;Obergefell&quot; decision, the Justice Department extended all federal marriage benefits to married same-sex couples nationwide.

The federal government recognizes the marriages of same-sex couples who married in certain states in which same-sex marriage was legal for brief periods between the time a court order allowed such couples to marry and that court order was stayed, including Michigan. It also recognized marriages performed in Utah from December 20, 2013, to January 6, 2014, even while the state didn&#x27;t. Under similar circumstances, it never took a position on Indiana or Wisconsin&#x27;s marriages performed in brief periods, though it did recognize them once the respective states announced they would do so. It had not taken a position with respect to similar marriages in Arkansas prior to the &quot;Obergefell&quot; decision legalizing and recognizing same-sex marriages in all fifty states. The State Marriage Defense Act was proposed in Congress to force the federal government to follow individual state laws regarding same-sex marriage although it never passed either chamber.

Opponents of same-sex marriage have worked to prevent individual states from recognizing same-sex unions by attempting to amend the United States Constitution to restrict marriage to heterosexual unions. In 2006, the &quot;Federal Marriage Amendment&quot;, which would have prohibited states from recognizing same-sex marriages, was approved by the Senate Judiciary Committee on a party-line vote and was debated by the full Senate, but was ultimately defeated in both houses of Congress. On April 2, 2014, the Alabama House of Representatives adopted a resolution calling for a constitutional convention to propose an amendment to ban same-sex marriage nationwide.

In 2022, Justice Clarence Thomas named &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; as a case that should be revisited in his concurrence of &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot;, which had overturned &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; on the basis that abortion protection was not a &quot;deeply rooted&quot; right in the Constitution. To prevent the loss of the right to same-sex marriage, the House of Representatives passed the Respect for Marriage Act which would nullify DOMA and protect existing same-sex and interracial marriage licenses. In July, the bill passed 267–157, with 47 Republican representatives joining the Democrats. In December, the Senate passed the bill 61–36, and the House again voted 258–169 to pass it. President Joe Biden signed it into law on December 13, 2022.

===State and territorial recognition===

Same-sex marriages are licensed in and recognized by all U.S. states and the District of Columbia, as well as all U.S. territories except American Samoa. However, under the Respect for Marriage Act, American Samoa must recognize all marriages between two people that were legally performed in another jurisdiction.

On January 6, 2016, Alabama&#x27;s Chief Justice, Roy Moore, issued a ruling forbidding state officials from issuing marriage licenses to same-sex couples. The ruling had no effect as all Alabama counties continued either issuing marriage licenses to all couples or not issuing licenses at all. In May 2016, Moore was charged with ethics violations by the state Judicial Inquiry Commission for the ruling, subsequently being suspended from the bench for the remainder of his term on September 30 of that year.

====Counties not issuing marriage licenses====
As of 2020, there are apparently no counties in the United States that do not (or would not) register the marriages of same-sex couple. 
* Officials of one Texas county, Irion, issued marriage licenses, but claimed they would refuse same-sex couples. Starting in 2017, they refused to comment on what they would do if a same-sex couple were to apply for license. However, as of March 2020, the Irion County clerk stated she would issue marriage licenses to same-sex couples and the form available on the office&#x27;s website was not gender specific and stated no restrictions as to the genders of the applicants.
* Officials in several Alabama counties initially stopped issuing any marriage licenses rather than issue them to same-sex couples. By 2017, the number of counties doing this to avoid issuing them to same-sex couples dropped to eight. This was in accordance with a state law, which was passed in 1961 to preserve racial segregation by making it optional for county clerks to issue marriage licenses. The Alabama Legislature passed a bill replacing marriage licenses with marriage certificates in May 2019. These final eight counties resumed allowing couples to marry on August 29, 2019.
* Several Kentucky counties initially refused to marry same-sex couples. In response, Kentucky reformed its marriage license forms and removed the name of the county clerk from the licenses. As of June 2016, Chris Hartmann, director of the Kentucky-based Fairness Campaign, said that to his knowledge &quot;there are no counties where marriage licenses are being denied&quot; in his state.

====Parental rights====

Post-&quot;Obergefell&quot;, six states have, on occasion, attempted to deny same-sex couples full adoption rights to varying degrees. In Arkansas, Florida, Indiana, and Wisconsin, same-sex couples have been met with rejection when trying to get both parents&#x27; names listed on the birth certificate. In &quot;V.L. v. E.L.&quot;, Alabama&#x27;s highest court attempted to void an adoption decree obtained by a same-sex couple in Georgia, but the U.S. Supreme Court reversed, restoring joint custody to the adoptive mother on March 7, 2016. Mississippi had once banned same-sex couples from adopting, but the law requiring this was ruled unconstitutional by the United States District Court for the Southern District of Mississippi on March 31, 2016. With that ruling, adoption by same-sex couples became legal in all fifty states.

On June 26, 2017, the Supreme Court ruled by a 6–3 vote in the case of &quot;Pavan v. Smith&quot; that under their decision in &quot;Obergefell&quot;, same-sex couples must be treated equally to opposite-sex couples in the issuance of birth certificates. In December 2016, the Supreme Court of Arkansas upheld a state law only allowing opposite-sex couples to be automatically listed as parents on their children&#x27;s birth certificates, while prohibiting same-sex couples from being allowed the same on an equal basis. The Supreme Court summarily reversed the Arkansas Supreme Court, finding that the disparity in treatment violated their decision in &quot;Obergefell&quot;.

===Tribal law===

The Supreme Court decision legalizing same-sex marriage in the states and territories did not legalize same-sex marriage in Native American tribal nations. In the United States, Congress (not the federal courts) has legal authority over Native reservations. Thus, unless Congress passes a law regarding same-sex marriage on such reservations, federally recognized Native American tribes have the legal right to form their own marriage laws. As of the time of the &quot;Obergefell&quot; ruling, 25 tribal nations legally recognized same-sex marriage. Some tribes have passed legislation specifically addressing same-sex relationships and some specify that state law and jurisdiction govern tribal marriages. As of April 2022, same-sex marriage is legally recognized in at least 47 tribal nations.

===Local laws prior to &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;===

Prior to &quot;Obergefell&quot;, same-sex marriage was legal to at least some degree in thirty-eight states, one territory (Guam) and the District of Columbia; of the states, Missouri, Kansas, and Alabama had restrictions. Until &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, it was only legal in 12 states and the District of Columbia. Beginning in July 2013, over forty federal and state courts cited &quot;Windsor&quot; to strike down state bans on the licensing or recognition of same-sex marriage. Missouri recognized same-sex marriages from out of state and same-sex marriages licensed by the City of St. Louis under two separate state court orders; two other jurisdictions issued such licenses as well. In Kansas, marriage licenses were available to same-sex couples in most counties, but the state did not recognize their validity. Some counties in Alabama issued marriage licenses to same-sex couples for three weeks until the state Supreme Court ordered probate judges to stop doing so. That court&#x27;s ruling did not address the recognition of same-sex marriages already licensed in Alabama, but referred to them as &quot;purported &#x27;marriage licenses. In two additional states, same-sex marriages were previously legal between the time their bans were struck down and then stayed. Michigan recognized the validity of more than 300 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples and those marriages. Arkansas recognized the more than 500 marriage licenses issued to same-sex couples there, and the Federal Government had not taken a position on Arkansas&#x27;s marriage licenses.

&quot;Note: This table shows only states that licensed and recognized same-sex marriages or had legalized them, before Obergefell v. Hodges. It does not include states that recognized same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions but did not license them.&quot;

==Debate==
===Support===

In the United States and Canada, professional organizations including the American Anthropological Association, the American Counseling Association, the American Academy of Pediatrics, the American Medical Association, the American Academy of Nursing, the American Psychological Association, the American Psychiatric Association, the Canadian Psychological Association, the American Sociological Association, the National Association of Social Workers, the American Psychoanalytic Association, the American Association for Marriage and Family Therapy, and the American Academy of Family Physicians have stated that the scientific evidence supports the following conclusions: homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, sexual orientation is not a choice, gay people form stable and committed relationships that are essentially equivalent to the relationships of heterosexuals, same-sex parents are no less capable than opposite-sex parents to raise children, no civilization or viable social order depends on restricting marriage to heterosexuals, and the children of same-sex couples fare just as well or even better than the children of opposite-sex couples.

Prominent figures in the civil rights movement have expressed their support for same-sex marriage. In 2004, Coretta Scott King, a leader of the civil rights movement and the widow of Martin Luther King Jr., expressed her support for same-sex marriage and publicly denounced attempts to define marriage as the &quot;union of a man and a woman&quot; as a form of &quot;gay bashing&quot;. In 2007, Mildred Loving, the joint plaintiff alongside her husband Richard Loving in the landmark civil rights case of &quot;Loving v. Virginia&quot; in 1967, in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down all state bans on inter-racial marriage, issued a statement on the 40th anniversary of the ruling in which she expressed her support for same-sex marriage and described it as a civil right akin to inter-racial marriage, stating that &quot;I believe all Americans, no matter their race, no matter their sex, no matter their sexual orientation, should have that same freedom to marry&quot;. In 2009, Julian Bond, a leader of the civil rights movement and a chairman of the NAACP, expressed his support for same-sex marriage and stated that &quot;gay rights are civil rights&quot;. In 2015, John Lewis, a leader of the civil rights movement and a chairman of the SNCC, welcomed the outcome of the landmark civil rights case of &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in which the Supreme Court of the United States struck down all state bans on same-sex marriage, stating that &quot;races don&#x27;t fall in love, genders don&#x27;t fall in love—people fall in love&quot;.

The NAACP, the leading African-American civil rights organization, has pledged its support for gay rights and same-sex marriage, stating that they &quot;support marriage equality consistent with equal protection under the law provided under the Fourteenth Amendment of the United States Constitution&quot;, and has declared that same-sex marriage is a civil right.

The Human Rights Campaign, the largest LGBTQ rights organization in the United States, states that &quot;many same-sex couples want the right to legally marry because they are in love — many, in fact, have spent the last 10, 20 or 50 years with that person — and they want to honor their relationship in the greatest way our society has to offer, by making a public commitment to stand together in good times and bad, through all the joys and challenges family life brings.&quot;

Journalist Gail Mathabane likens prohibitions on same-sex marriage to past prohibitions on interracial marriage in the United States. Author Fernando Espuelas argues that same-sex marriage should be allowed because it recognizes the civil right of a minority. Historian Nancy Cott rejects alternatives to same-sex marriage (such as civil unions), reasoning that &quot;there really is no comparison, because there is nothing that is like marriage except marriage.&quot;

====Role of social media====
Supporters of same-sex marriage successfully utilized social media websites such as Facebook to help achieve their aims. Some have argued that the successful use of social media by LGBTQ rights organizations played a key role in the defeat of religion-based opposition.

One of the largest scale uses of social media to mobilize support for same-sex marriage preceded and coincided with the arrival at the U.S. Supreme Court of high-profile legal cases for Proposition 8 and DOMA in March 2013. The &quot;red equal sign&quot; project started by the Human Rights Campaign was an electronic campaign primarily based on Facebook that encouraged users to change their profile images to a red equal sign to express support for same-sex marriage. At the time of the court hearings, an estimated 2.5 million Facebook users changed their profile images to a red equal sign.

===Opposition===
Opposition to same-sex marriage is based on claims such as the beliefs that homosexuality is unnatural and abnormal, that the recognition of same-sex unions will promote homosexuality in society, and that children are better off when raised by opposite-sex couples. While some researchers question the definitiveness of the evidence, others assert that science has shown that homosexuality is a natural and normal human sexuality, that sexual orientation cannot be chosen, and that the children of same-sex couples fare just as well as children of opposite sex couples.

Others argue that the word &quot;marriage&quot; has always had a very specific meaning, &quot;i.e.&quot; the union of a man and a woman. By this argument, calling same-sex unions &quot;marriages&quot; is not a question of law but an example of Newspeak: same-sex unions are an inherently different entity than a marriage, and that entity has only gained legitimacy through Orwellian brainwashing. Critics of this position counter that historical changes in marriage traditions negate any fixed definition, so the word &quot;marriage&quot; can be infinitely redefined according to the needs of the culture.

Some of the opponents of same-sex marriage are religious groups such as the Catholic Church and the Southern Baptist Convention which desire for marriage to remain restricted to opposite-sex marriages. However, there are faith-based supporters of same-sex marriage, and homosexual people of faith, within every faith group. The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints opposed the legalization of same-sex marriage but in 2022, endorsed a federal bill requiring states and territories to honor same-sex marriages solemnized in other states (though it reiterated that church doctrine would not change).

Political donations in opposition of same-sex marriage have been an issue of great dispute. Both judges and the IRS have ruled that it is either questionable or illegal for campaign contributions to be shielded by anonymity.

===Politicians and media figures===
President Barack Obama&#x27;s views on same-sex marriage varied over the course of his political career and became more consistently supportive of it over time. In the 1990s, he had supported same-sex marriage while campaigning for the Illinois Senate. During the 2008 presidential campaign, he was opposed to same-sex marriage, but he also opposed the 2008 California referendum that aimed at reversing a court ruling establishing same-sex marriage there. In 2009, he opposed two opposing federal legislative proposals that would have banned or established same-sex marriage nationally, stating that each state had to decide the issue. In December 2010, he expressed support for civil unions with rights equivalent to marriage and for federal recognition of same-sex relationships. He opposed a federal constitutional amendment to ban same-sex marriage. He also stated that his position on same-sex marriage was &quot;evolving&quot; and that he recognized that civil unions from the perspective of same-sex couples was &quot;not enough&quot;. On May 9, 2012, President Obama became the first sitting president to support same-sex marriage. He still said the legal question belonged to the states. In October 2014, Obama told an interviewer that his view had changed:
Shortly after winning the 2016 election, President Donald Trump said he&#x27;s &quot;fine&quot; with same-sex marriage and believes it to be settled law: &quot;It&#x27;s law. It was settled in the Supreme Court. I mean, it&#x27;s done.&quot; This somewhat contrasted with a previous statement he made in June 2015, after &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot;, in which he said he&#x27;s personally for &quot;traditional marriage&quot; and that he believed same-sex marriage should be left to the states. In that same statement, however, Trump admitted that overturning &quot;Obergefell&quot; is not realistic. Several of his federal appointments have also, subsequently, announced they will uphold same-sex marriage and enforce the Supreme Court ruling, while still being personally against same-sex marriage, namely Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Secretary of Education Betsy DeVos.

Former presidents Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, and Barack Obama, former vice presidents Dick Cheney, Al Gore, Walter Mondale, and Joe Biden have voiced their support for same-sex marriage, as have former first ladies Laura Bush, Hillary Clinton, Michelle Obama, and Nancy Reagan. Former President George H. W. Bush and his wife former First Lady Barbara Bush served as witnesses to a same-sex wedding, but neither publicly affirmed support for same-sex marriage in general; George W. Bush reportedly offered to officiate the same wedding, but has similarly not made a public statement regarding his position on the issue (as president, he was opposed). Fifteen U.S. senators announced their support in the spring of 2013. By April 2013, a majority of the Senate had expressed support for same-sex marriage. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio became the first sitting Republican senator to endorse same-sex marriage in March 2013, followed by Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois in April, Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska in June, and Senator Susan Collins of Maine a year later.

Politicians who have notably opposed same-sex marriage have included Rick Santorum, Mike Huckabee, and Sarah Palin.

Prominent politicians who have shifted from opposing to supporting same-sex marriage include Republican Senator Rob Portman, and Republican Representative Bob Barr (the author of the 1996 &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot;).

In an interview on &quot;The O&#x27;Reilly Factor&quot; in August 2010, when Glenn Beck was asked if he &quot;believe(s) that gay marriage is a threat to [this] country in any way&quot;, he stated, &quot;No I don&#x27;t. ... I believe that Thomas Jefferson said: &#x27;If it neither breaks my leg nor picks my pocket what difference is it to me?

==Studies==
The overall effects of legal access to same-sex marriage have been summarized by Badgett and co-authors. The review found that sexual minority individuals took-up legal marriage when it became available to them (but at lower rates than different-sex couples). There is instead no evidence that same-sex marriage legalization affected different-sex marriages. On the health side, same-sex marriage legalization increased health insurance coverage for individuals in same-sex couples in the US, and it led to improvements in sexual health among men who have sex with men, while there is mixed evidence on mental health effects among sexual minorities. In addition, the study found mixed evidence on a range of downstream social outcomes such as attitudes toward LGBTQ+ people and employment choices of sexual minorities.

===Adolescent attempted suicide===
The establishment of same-sex marriage is associated with a significant reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teenagers, with the effect being concentrated among teens of a minority sexual orientation. A study of nationwide data from across the United States from January 1999 to December 2015 revealed that the rate of attempted suicide among all students in grades 9–12 declined by 7% and the rate of attempted suicide among those of a minority sexual orientation in grades 9–12 declined by 14% in states which established same-sex marriage, resulting in approximately 134,000 fewer teens attempting suicide each year in the United States. The researchers took advantage of the gradual manner in which same-sex marriage was established in the United States (expanding from one state in 2004 to all fifty states in 2015) to compare the rate of attempted suicide among teens in each state over the time period studied. Once same-sex marriage was established in a particular state, the reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teens in that state became permanent. No reduction in the rate of attempted suicide among teens occurred in a particular state until that state recognized same-sex marriage. The lead researcher of the study observed that &quot;laws that have the greatest impact on gay adults may make gay kids feel more hopeful for the future&quot;.

===Economic impact on same-sex couples===
Until the Supreme Court&#x27;s June 2013 ruling in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; required the Federal Government to treat lawfully married same-sex couples on an equal basis with lawfully married opposite-sex couples, same-sex married couples faced severe disadvantages. The Federal Government did not recognize those marriages for any purpose. According to a 1997 General Accounting Office study, at least 1,049 U.S. federal laws and regulations include references to marital status. A 2004 study by the Congressional Budget Office found 1,138 statutory provisions &quot;in which marital status is a factor in determining or receiving &#x27;benefits, rights, and privileges. Many of these laws govern property rights, benefits, and taxation. Same-sex couples whose marriages were not recognized by the Federal Government were ineligible for spousal and survivor Social Security benefits and were ineligible for the benefits of the spouse of a federal government employee. One study found that the difference in Social Security income for same-sex couples compared to opposite-sex married couples was US$5,588 per year.

Compared to similarly situated opposite-sex married couples, same-sex couples faced the following financial and legal disadvantages:
* Legal costs associated with obtaining domestic partner documents to gain legal abilities granted automatically by legal marriage, including power of attorney, health care decision-making, and inheritance
* A person can inherit an unlimited amount from a deceased spouse without incurring an estate tax, but was subject to taxes if inheriting from a same-sex partner
* Same-sex couples were not eligible to file jointly as a married couple and thus could not take the advantages of lower tax rates when the individual income of the partners differs significantly
* Employer-provided health insurance coverage for a same-sex partner incurred federal income tax
* Higher health costs associated with lack of insurance and preventive care: 20% of same-sex couples had a member who was uninsured compared to 10% of married opposite-sex couples
* Inability to protect jointly owned home from loss due to costs of potential medical catastrophe
* Inability of a U.S. citizen to sponsor a same-sex spouse for citizenship

Some 7,400 companies were offering spousal benefits to same-sex couples as of 2008. In states that recognized same-sex marriages, same-sex couples could continue to receive those same benefits only if they married. Only 18% of private employers offered domestic partner health care benefits.

Same-sex couples face the same financial constraints of legal marriage as opposite-sex married couples, including the marriage penalty in taxation. While social service providers usually do not count one partner&#x27;s assets toward the income means test for welfare and disability assistance for the other partner, a legally married couple&#x27;s joint assets are normally used in calculating whether a married individual qualifies for assistance.

A 2019 study found an increase in employment among same-sex couples after the legalization of same-sex marriage. The author of the study provided additional evidence suggesting that this change in employment was driven by a decline in discrimination.

===Economic impact on the state and federal governments===
The 2004 Congressional Budget Office study, working from an assumption &quot;that about 0.6 percent of adults would enter into same-sex marriages if they had the opportunity&quot; (an assumption in which they admitted &quot;significant uncertainty&quot;) estimated that legalizing same-sex marriage throughout the United States &quot;would improve the budget&#x27;s bottom line to a small extent: by less than $1 billion in each of the next 10 years&quot;. This result reflects an increase in net government revenues (increased income taxes due to marriage penalties more than offsetting decreased tax revenues arising from postponed estate taxes). Marriage recognition would increase the government expenses for Social Security and Federal Employee Health Benefits but that increase would be more than made up for by decreased expenses for Medicaid, Medicare, and Supplemental Security Income.

According to a study published in May 2020 by the Williams Institute on Sexual Orientation and Gender Identity Law and Public Policy, the legalization of same-sex marriage boosted state and local economies by an estimated 3.8 billion dollars. The Williams Institute estimated that the 300,000 same-sex couples who married in the U.S. since 2015 generated about $3.2 billion for local and state economies. In addition, traveling wedding guests spent an additional $544 million, and about 45,000 jobs were supported by same-sex weddings. $244 million was generated in state and local taxes.

===Mental health===
Based in part on research that has been conducted on the adverse effects of stigmatization of gays and lesbians, numerous prominent social science organizations have issued position statements supporting same-sex marriage and opposing discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation; these organizations include the American Psychoanalytic Association and the American Psychological Association.

Several psychological studies have shown that an increase in exposure to negative conversations, media messages, and negative reactions among peers about same-sex marriage creates a harmful environment for LGBTQ people that may affect their health and well-being, especially among its younger members.

One study surveyed more than 1,500 lesbian, gay and bisexual adults across the nation and found that respondents from the 25 states that have outlawed same-sex marriage had the highest reports of &quot;minority stress&quot;—the chronic social stress that results from minority-group stigmatization—as well as general psychological distress. According to the study, the negative campaigning that comes with a ban is directly responsible for the increased stress. Past research has shown that minority stress is linked to health risks such as risky sexual behavior and substance abuse.

Two other studies examined personal reports from LGBTQ adults and their families living in Memphis, Tennessee, immediately after a successful 2006 ballot campaign banned same-sex marriage. Most respondents reported feeling alienated from their communities. The studies also found that families experienced a kind of secondary minority stress, says Jennifer Arm, a counseling graduate student at the University of Memphis.

At the &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot; trial, expert witness Ilan Meyer testified that the mental health outcomes for gays and lesbians would improve if laws such as Proposition 8 did not exist because &quot;when people are exposed to more stress...they are more likely to get sick...&quot; and that particular situation is consistent with laws that say to gay people &quot;you are not welcome here, your relationships are not valued.&quot; Such laws have &quot;significant power&quot;, he said.

===Physical health===
In 2009, a pair of economists at Emory University tied the passage of state bans on same-sex marriage in the US to an increase in the rates of HIV/AIDS infection. The study linked the passage of same-sex marriage ban in a state to an increase in the annual HIV rate within that state of roughly 4 cases per 100,000 population.

A study by the Columbia Mailman School of Public Health found that gay men in Massachusetts visited health clinics significantly less often following the legalization of same-sex marriage in that state.

==In popular culture==
The Fox sitcom &quot;Roc&quot; was the first sitcom to feature a same-sex marriage in 1991. Since then, several shows and series have featured same-sex marriages, including amongst others &quot;Married...with Children&quot;, &quot;Roseanne&quot; (&quot;December Bride&quot;), &quot;Glee&quot;, &quot;Friends&quot; (&quot;The One with the Lesbian Wedding&quot;), &quot;Brooklyn Nine-Nine&quot;, &quot;Modern Family&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot; (&quot;There&#x27;s Something About Marrying&quot;), &quot;The Ellen DeGeneres Show&quot;, &quot;Brothers &amp; Sisters&quot;, &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;Will &amp; Grace&quot;, &quot;Conan&quot;, &quot;Steven Universe&quot;, &quot;Shameless&quot;, &quot;The Fosters&quot;, etc.

The 22nd season premier of the PBS animated-show &quot;Arthur&quot; featured the marriage of teacher Mr. Ratburn and his male partner. Alabama&#x27;s public television channel refused to air the episode.

==Marriage statistics==
There is no complete data on the number of same-sex marriages conducted in the United States. Marriages and divorces are recorded by states, counties, and territories, plus New York City and the District of Columbia, but not by the Federal Government. States such as Oregon do not distinguish between opposite-sex and same-sex marriages in their official records. The legal records on marriage and divorce belong to the states.

In August 2016, the Treasury Department estimated the number of same-sex marriages by linking the tax returns of same-sex couples who had filed jointly in 2014 with their Social Security records. (Although this method excluded couples who file singly, these are small in number; of all married couples who file taxes, 97.5% file jointly.) This research showed that in 2014 there were about 183,280 married same-sex couples in the country, or &quot;roughly a third of 1 percent of all marriages&quot; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Numbers from 2015 showed a large increase to 250,450 marriages. According to Census Bureau data, heterosexual marriages still accounted for about 98 percent of marriages for people under 35 in 2021.

According to the 2015 statistics, female couples were four times more likely to have children than male couples. Additionally, male couples earned a pretax average of $165,960 per year, while lesbian couples earned $118,415 and straight couples earned $115,210. The highest rates of female same-sex marriage were found in Oakland (2.1% of all marriages), Seattle, San Francisco, Springfield (MA) and Portland (OR), whereas gay male marriages were most frequent in San Francisco (3.2%), Washington D.C., New York City, Seattle and Fort Lauderdale.

The United States Census Bureau has collected data on unmarried same-sex households since 2005. Since 2013 following &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, the Bureau began recording married same-sex households in its &quot;Same-Sex Couples&quot; report. 

It recorded about 252,000 same-sex &quot;spouses&quot; in 2013; 335,000 in 2014; 425,000 in 2015; 487,000 in 2016; 555,000 in 2017; 593,000 in 2018. In 2018, the states of California, Texas and New York had the highest total number of same-sex households, whereas Wyoming, Vermont, South Dakota and Connecticut had the most married same-sex households in comparison to unmarried households (92.4% of Wyoming same-sex households were married, followed by Vermont at 79.3%, South Dakota at 77.8% and Connecticut at 70.7%). Nationally, 59.5% of cohabiting same-sex couples were married.

The Population Reference Bureau reported that by October 2015 approximately 486,000 same-sex marriages had taken place in the United States. It estimated that 45% of all same-sex couples in the country were married at that time.

According to Gallup, the percent of cohabiting same-sex couples who are married rose from 38% in 2015 to 49% in 2016 and to 61% in 2017.

==Case law==

United States federal and state case law regarding same-sex marriage:

===1970s===
* &quot;Anonymous v. Anonymous&quot;, 67 Misc.2d 982 (N.Y. 1971). The law makes no provision for a &quot;marriage&quot; between persons of the same sex.
* &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot;, 191 N.W.2d 185 (Minn. 1971). Upholds a Minnesota law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman. (Overruled by &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; in 2015; see below)
* &quot;Jones v. Hallahan&quot;, 501 S.W.2d 588 (Ky. 1973). Upholds the denial of a marriage license to two women in Kentucky based on dictionary definitions of marriage, despite the fact that state statutes do not specify the gender of marriage partners.
* &quot;Frances B. v. Mark B.&quot;, 78 Misc.2d 112 (1974). Marriage is and always has been a contract between a man and a woman.
* &quot;Singer v. Hara&quot;, 522 P.2d 1187 (Wash. Ct. App. 1974). The historical definition of marriage is between one man and one woman, and same-sex couples are inherently ineligible to marry. This ban does not constitute sex discrimination.

===1980s===
* &quot;Adams v. Howerton&quot;, 673 F.2d 1036 (9th Cir. 1982), &quot;cert. denied&quot;, 458 U.S. 1111. A same-sex marriage does not make one a &quot;spouse&quot; under the &quot;Immigration and Nationality Act&quot;.
* &quot;De Santo v. Barnsley&quot;, 476 A.2d 952 (Pa. Super. Ct. 1984). Same-sex couples cannot divorce because they cannot form a common law marriage.

===1990s===
* &quot;In re Estate of Cooper&quot;, 149 Misc.2d 282 (Sur. Ct. Kings Co. 1990). The state has a compelling interest in fostering the traditional institution of marriage and prohibiting same-sex marriage.
* &quot;Baehr v. Lewin&quot;, 852 P.2d 44 (Haw. 1993). A statute limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples violates the Hawaii Constitution&#x27;s equal protection clause unless the state can show that the statute is both justified by compelling state interests and also narrowly tailored. This ruling prompted the adoption of Hawaii&#x27;s constitutional amendment allowing the State Legislature to restrict marriage to different-sex couples and the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot;.
* &quot;Dean v. District of Columbia&quot;, 653 A.2d 307 (D.C. 1995). DC does not authorise same-sex marriage; denial of a marriage license does not violate the Due Process Clause of the United States Constitution.
* &quot;Storrs v. Holcomb&quot;, 645 N.Y.S.2d 286 (App. Div. 1996). New York does not recognize or authorize same-sex marriage. Overturned in part by &quot;Martinez v. County of Monroe&quot; in 2008.
* &quot;In re Estate of Hall&quot;, 707 N.E.2d 201, 206 (Ill. App. Ct. 1998). Illinois does not recognize a same-sex marriage. The petitioner&#x27;s claim to be in a same-sex marriage was not in a marriage recognized by law.
* &quot;Baker v. Vermont&quot;, 170 Vt. 194; 744 A.2d 864 (Vt. 1999). The Common Benefits Clause of the Constitution of Vermont requires that same-sex couples be granted the same legal rights as married persons, though it need not be called &quot;marriage&quot;.

===2000s===
* &quot;Frandsen v. County of Brevard&quot;, 828 So. 2d 757 (Fla. 2001). The Florida Constitution will not be construed to recognize same-sex marriage; sex classifications not subject to strict scrutiny under the Constitution.
* &quot;Burns v. Burns&quot;, 560 S.E.2d 47 (Ga. Ct. App. 2002). Marriage is the union of one man and one woman.
* &quot;In re Estate of Gardiner&quot;, 42 P.3d 120 (Kan. 2002). A post-operative male-to-female transsexual is not a woman within the meaning of the statutes and cannot validly marry a man.
* &quot;Rosengarten v. Downes&quot;, 806 A.2d 1066 (Conn. Ct. App. 2002). Connecticut will not dissolve a Vermont civil union.
* &quot;Standhardt v. Superior Court ex rel. County of Maricopa&quot;, 77 P.3d 451 (Ariz. Ct. App. 2003). The Constitution of Arizona does not provide the right to same-sex marriage.
* &quot;Goodridge v. Dept. of Public Health&quot;, 798 N.E.2d 941 (Mass. 2003). The denial of marriage licenses to same-sex couples violated provisions of the Massachusetts State Constitution guaranteeing individual liberty and equality, and it was not rationally related to a legitimate state interest.
* &quot;Morrison v. Sadler&quot;, 821 N.E.2d 15 (Ind. Super. Ct. 2005). Indiana&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; is valid.
* &quot;Langan v. St. Vincent&#x27;s Hospital&quot;, 802 N.Y.S.2d 476 (App. Div. 2005). For the purposes of New York&#x27;s wrongful death statute, the survivor partner from a Vermont civil union lacks standing as a &quot;spouse&quot;.
* &quot;Citizens for Equal Protection v. Bruning&quot;, 455 F.3d 859 (8th Cir. 2006). Nebraska&#x27;s Initiative Measure 416 does not violate the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause, was not a bill of attainder, and does not violate the First Amendment.
* &quot;Lewis v. Harris&quot;, 908 A.2d 196 (N.J. 2006). Prohibiting same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; does not violate the New Jersey Constitution, but the state must extend all the rights and responsibilities of marriage to same-sex couples. The New Jersey Legislature had 180 days to amend the marriage laws or create a &quot;parallel structure&quot;.
* &quot;Andersen v. King County&quot;, 138 P.3d 963 (Wash. 2006). Washington&#x27;s &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; does not violate the State Constitution.
* &quot;Hernandez v. Robles&quot;, 855 N.E.2d 1 (N.Y. 2006). The New York Constitution does not require that marriage rights be extended to same-sex couples.
* &quot;Conaway v. Deane&quot;, 932 A.2d 571 (Md. 2007). Upholds a Maryland law defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman.
* &quot;Martinez v. County of Monroe&quot;, 850 N.Y.S.2d 740 (App. Div. 2008). Because New York recognizes the marriages of opposite-sex couples from other jurisdictions, it must do the same for same-sex couples.
* &quot;In re Marriage Cases&quot;, 183 P.3d 384 (Cal. 2008). Limiting marriage to opposite-sex couples is invalid under the equal protection clause of the California Constitution. Full marriage rights, not merely domestic partnership, must be offered to same-sex couples.
* &quot;Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health&quot;, 957 A.2d 407 (Conn. 2008). The availability of civil unions but not marriage to same-sex partners is a violation of the equality and liberty provisions of the Connecticut Constitution.
* &quot;Strauss v. Horton&quot;, 207 P.3d 48 (Cal. 2009). Proposition 8 was validly adopted, and marriages contracted before its adoption remain valid.
* &quot;Varnum v. Brien&quot;, 763 N.W.2d 862 (Iowa 2009). Barring same-sex couples from marriage violates the equal protection provisions of the Iowa Constitution. Equal protection requires full marriage, rather than civil unions or some other substitute, for same-sex couples.

===2010s===
;Challenges to DOMA Section 3
* &quot;Gill v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; (2009–2013). Section 3 of the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The First Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that ruling and stays implementation pending appeal. &quot;Windsor&quot; finds Section 3 unconstitutional and appeal of &quot;Gill&quot; is denied by the Supreme Court.
* &quot;Massachusetts v. United States Department of Health and Human Services&quot; (2009–2013). Decided alongside &quot;Gill&quot; with the same outcome.
* &quot;Golinski v. Office of Personnel Management&quot; (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court, which determines that sexual orientation is a quasi-suspect classification requiring the court to apply intermediate scrutiny, that is, to determine whether Section 3 relates to an important government interest. On appeal, the case is held in abeyance pending the decision of the U.S. Supreme Court in &quot;Windsor&quot;, which settles the issues raised in &quot;Golinski&quot;, the appeal of which to the Supreme Court is then denied.
* &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot; (2010–2013). Section 3 of the federal &quot;Defense of Marriage Act&quot; is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court. The Second Circuit Court of Appeals affirms that ruling, as does the U.S. Supreme Court. The U.S. Government began implementing the decision the same week.
;California Proposition 8
* &quot;Hollingsworth v. Perry&quot; (2009–2013). California&#x27;s Proposition 8, a voter-endorsed constitutional amendment banning same-sex marriage, is found unconstitutional in U.S. district court in &quot;Perry v. Schwarzenegger&quot;. The proposition&#x27;s backers appeal to the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals, which upholds the district court&#x27;s finding of unconstitutionality in &quot;Perry v. Brown&quot;. The U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the proposition&#x27;s backers lacked standing to appeal and left the district court ruling intact.
;Same-sex marriage rights
* &quot;Christiansen v. Christiansen&quot;. On June 6, 2011, the Supreme Court of Wyoming grants a divorce to two women who married in Canada, but says its decision does not apply &quot;in any context other than divorce&quot;.
* &quot;Port v. Cowan&quot; (2010–2012). Maryland must recognize valid out-of-state same-sex marriages under doctrine of comity.
* &quot;Garden State Equality v. Dow&quot; (2011–2013), New Jersey&#x27;s civil unions violate due process guarantees; denying same-sex marriage ruled unconstitutional in state superior court. The N.J. Supreme Court refuses to stay the ruling and the state defendants drop their appeal.
* &quot;Griego v. Oliver&quot;, 316 P.3d 865 (N.M. 2013). The New Mexico Supreme Court rules that the State Constitution requires marriage rights to be extended to same-sex couples.
* &quot;Kitchen v. Herbert&quot;, 961 F. Supp. 2d 1181 (2013). U.S. district court rules Utah&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. The Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals upholds that ruling on June 25, 2014. All parties support review by the U.S. Supreme Court, and that court denied review on October 6.
* &quot;Whitewood v. Wolf&quot; (Pennsylvania). On May 20, 2014, Judge John E. Jones III rules that Pennsylvania&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban is unconstitutional.
* &quot;Geiger v. Kitzhaber&quot; and &quot;Rummell v. Kitzhaber&quot; (Oregon). On May 19, 2014, district judge Michael J. McShane declares Oregon&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban unconstitutional.
* &quot;Bostic v. Schaefer&quot; (Virginia). The Fourth Circuit on July 28, 2014, in a 2–1 decision, affirms a district court ruling that Virginia&#x27;s denial of marriage rights to same-sex couples is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied review on October 6.
* &quot;Baskin v. Bogan&quot; (Indiana) and &quot;Wolf v. Walker&quot; (Wisconsin). The Seventh Circuit consolidated these cases and on September 4, 2014, upheld two district court rulings that had found Indiana&#x27;s and Wisconsin&#x27;s bans on same-sex marriage unconstitutional. The U.S. Supreme Court denied review on October 6.
* &quot;Bishop v. Smith&quot; (Oklahoma). On July 18, 2014, the Tenth Circuit upholds the district court ruling that Oklahoma&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage is unconstitutional. The Supreme Court denied review on October 6.
* &quot;Barrier v. Vasterling&quot; (Missouri). State circuit judge J. Dale Youngs rules on October 3, 2014, that Missouri&#x27;s refusal to recognize same-sex marriages from other jurisdictions violates the plaintiff same-sex couples&#x27; right to equal protection under both the state and federal constitutions.
* &quot;Caspar v. Snyder&quot; (Michigan). On January 15, 2015, U.S. district judge Mark A. Goldsmith ruled that the state must recognize the validity of &quot;window marriages&quot; established on March 21 and 22, 2014, before the Sixth Circuit Court of Appeals stayed a district court ruling in &quot;DeBoer v. Snyder&quot; that found Michigan&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, despite the fact that &quot;DeBoer&quot; was later reversed. The state chose not to appeal.
* &quot;Obergefell v. Hodges&quot; (2013–2015). U.S. Supreme Court case finding state bans on same-sex marriage to be unconstitutional under the 14th Amendment. (Overturned &quot;Baker v. Nelson&quot;)

==Public opinion==

Americans began to be polled occasionally on the topic in the 1980s and more regularly in the 1990s. From 1988 to 2009, support for same-sex marriage increased between 1% and 1.5% per year. In the 2010s, it increased more quickly.

Gallup found that nationwide public support reached 50% in May 2011, 60% in May 2015, and 70% in May 2021.

The Pew Research Center similarly found 40% in 2010, 50% in 2013 and 61% in 2019.

 83% of Americans aged 18–29 supported same-sex marriage.

 there was majority support for same-sex marriage in 47 states, ranging from 50% in South Carolina to 85% in Massachusetts. There was plurality support in Alabama, with 49% supporting and 47% opposing. Only Mississippi and Arkansas had majority opposition to same-sex marriage; in Mississippi, 55% opposed and 44% supported, while in Arkansas, 52% opposed and 47% supported same-sex marriage.

 60% of Americans said they would not mind if their child married someone of the same gender.

Annual polling conducted by Gallup each May in 2017, 2018, 2019 and 2020 has found support for same-sex marriage stable, with two-thirds of Americans indicating that same-sex marriage should be recognized as valid under law (a range of 63% to 67% was recorded). In a 2024 &quot;Gallup&quot; poll, 69% of respondents stated that same-sex marriage should be legally recognized as valid under the law (83% of Democrats, 74% of independents and 46% of Republicans), while 29% were opposed.

As V.P., Broidy took charge of operations early in 1945 and later that year was named president. In 1946 Broidy formed Allied Artists Productions and Monogram changed to that name in 1953.

He remained president of Allied Artists until 1965, when he left to form his own company, Motion Pictures International. As an independent, Broidy produced &quot;Good Times&quot; (Columbia), &quot;The Fox&quot; (Claridge Pictures, 1967), and &quot;80 Steps to Jonah&quot; (Warner Bros.-Seven Arts, 1969). He also produced, uncredited, &quot;The Poseidon Adventure&quot; in 1972.

<doc id="249627" wikidata="Q1061437" url="?curid=249627" title="Midway International Airport">
<text>Chicago Midway International Airport is a major commercial airport on the southwest side of Chicago, Illinois, located approximately 12 miles (19 km) from the city&#x27;s Loop business district, and divided between the city&#x27;s Clearing and Garfield Ridge communities. Established in 1927, Midway served as Chicago&#x27;s primary airport until the opening of O&#x27;Hare International Airport in 1944. Midway is one of the busiest airports in the nation and the second-busiest airport both in the Chicago metropolitan area and the state of Illinois, serving 22,050,489 passengers in 2023.

Midway is a base for Southwest Airlines, which carries over 90% of the passengers at the airport. The airport&#x27;s name is in honor of the Battle of Midway. The defunct Midway Airlines, once headquartered at Midway, took its name from the airport. The airfield is located in a square mile bounded by 55th and 63rd Streets, and Central and Cicero Avenues. The terminal complex was completed in 2001. The terminal bridges Cicero Avenue and contains 43 gates with facilities for international passengers. The CTA rapid transit Orange Line provides transit to Downtown Chicago, where it connects with other subway/elevated rapid transit lines.

==History==


===Early history (1923–1962)===
Originally named Chicago Air Park, Midway Airport was built on a plot in 1923 with one cinder runway mainly for airmail flights. In 1926, the city leased the airport and named it Chicago Municipal Airport on December 12, 1927. By 1928, the airport had twelve hangars and four runways, which were lit for night operations.

A major fire early on June 25, 1930, destroyed two hangars and 27 aircraft, &quot;12 of them tri-motor passenger planes.&quot; The loss was estimated at more than two million dollars. The hangars destroyed belonged to the Universal Air Lines, Inc. and the Grey Goose Airlines, the latter under lease to Stout Air Lines. The fire followed an explosion of undetermined cause in the Universal hangar.
In 1931, a new passenger terminal opened at 62nd St; the following year the airport claimed to be the &quot;World&#x27;s Busiest&quot; with over 100,846 passengers on 60,947 flights. (The July 1932 Official Aviation Guide (OAG) shows 206 scheduled airline departures a week.)

More construction was funded in part by $1 million from the Works Progress Administration; the airport expanded to fill the square mile in 1938–41 after a court ordered the Chicago and Western Indiana Railroad to reroute tracks that had crossed the square along the northern edge of the older field.

The March 1939 OAG shows 47 weekday departures: 13 on United, 13 American, 9 TWA, 4 Northwest, and two each on Eastern, Braniff, Pennsylvania Central, and C&amp;S. New York&#x27;s airport (Newark, then LaGuardia by the end of 1939) was then the busiest airline airport in the United States, but Midway passed LaGuardia in 1948 and kept the title until 1960. The record-breaking 1945 Japan–Washington flight of B-29s refueled at the airport on their way to Washington, DC.

In July 1949, the airport was renamed after the Battle of Midway. That year, Midway saw 3.2 million passengers; passengers peaked at 10 million in 1959. The diagram on the January 1951 C&amp;GS approach chart shows four parallel pairs of runways, all 4240 ft or less except for 5730-ft runway 13R (current runway 13C) and 5230-ft runway 4R.

The April 1957 OAG shows 414 weekday fixed-wing departures from Midway: 83 American, 83 United, 56 TWA, 40 Capital, 35 North Central, 28 Delta, 27 Eastern, 22 Northwest, 19 Ozark, 11 Braniff, 5 Trans-Canada, and 5 Lake Central. Air France, Lufthansa, and REAL (of Brazil) had a few flights per week.

Unfortunately, Midway being surrounded by buildings on all sides meant that the airport was running out of room; its runways were too short to safely handle larger four-engine jetliners (the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8) that appeared in 1959. Instead, every Chicago jet flight was directed to use O&#x27;Hare, which had opened to airlines in 1955. Lighter aircraft like turboprop Lockheed L-188 Electras and Vickers Viscounts could have continued to fly out of Midway, but O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s new terminal opened in 1962, allowing airlines to consolidate their flights. From July 1962 until United returned in July 1964, Midway&#x27;s only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter. In August 1966, a total of four fixed-wing arrivals were scheduled, all United 727s (United was alone at Midway until early 1968).

===Post-O&#x27;Hare reconstruction (1963–1993)===
By 1967, reconstruction began at the airport, adding three new concourses with 28 gates and three ticket counters, and in 1968, the city invested $10 million in renovation funds. (For a few months during the 1967 renovation, Midway had no scheduled airline flights.) The funds partly supported construction of the Stevenson Expressway, and Midway saw the return of major airlines that year, with 1,663,074 passengers on smaller-capacity, shorter range twin-jet and trijet airliners such as the McDonnell Douglas DC-9, BAC One-Eleven, Boeing 727, and Boeing 737 that could use Midway&#x27;s runways, which the Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 could not. In May 1968 there were 22 scheduled departures: six United 727s to MSP, DCA and LGA, 12 Northwest 727s to MSP and CLE, one Delta DC-9 to STL and three Ozark FH227s.

The December 1970 OAG shows 86 weekday arrivals (77 jet) on 13 fixed-wing airlines from 31 airports, but the August 1974 shows 14 arrivals (all jet) on four airlines, and in 1976–79 Midway had only the two or three Delta DC-9s from St Louis. Midway Airlines arrived on October 31, 1979, with DC-9 nonstops to Kansas City, Detroit and Cleveland Lakefront; they expanded greatly in the 1980s. Their September 1989 timetable shows 117 weekday departures to 29 cities, plus 108 departures on their commuter affiliates to 22 more cities. Midway ceased flying in 1991 due to financial challenges.

In 1982, the city of Chicago purchased Midway Airport from the Chicago Board of Education for $16 million. Three years later, Southwest Airlines began operations at Midway. Midway was a focus city for Vanguard Airlines from 1997 to 2000.

The Carlton Midway Inn moved to allow the Chicago Transit Authority to create a new CTA terminal at the airport on Halloween 1993. This development helped launch the Chicago &#x27;L&#x27; Orange Line, connecting Midway to the Loop. Midway Airport serves as the terminus for the Orange Line, which traverses the southwestern section of the city before encircling the Loop. In contrast to the CTA Blue Line, which operates continuously throughout the day, the Orange Line runs from approximately 4:00 am to 1:00 am, nearly providing 24-hour service with trains arriving at intervals of about 8 minutes. For those traveling during the overnight hours, the N62 Archer bus offers an alternative mode of transportation. The journey from Midway to the Loop takes roughly 25 minutes once the train has departed.

===Years of ATA (1994–2008)===
In 1996, after failing to get his Lake Calumet Airport and having received harsh criticism for the idea of turning the airport into an industrial park, Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley announced the Midway Airport Terminal Development Program, which was launched the following year. At the time, it was the largest public works project in the state. The Midway Airport parking garage opened in 1999, bringing covered parking to the airport for the first time. The garage is connected to the Midway terminal building for convenient access to ticket counters and baggage claim areas.

Continuing with the expansion project, a pedestrian bridge over Cicero Avenue was built in 2000, connecting the new terminal to the new concourses. In 2001 the new Midway Airport terminal building opened, with larger ticket counters, spacious baggage claim areas, traveler information, and a short walking distance to gates. A food court opened with Chicago-style food and retail options.

The expansion project culminated with a short lived period of great airline diversity at Midway as Vanguard Airlines, National Airlines and AirTran Airways all expanded their services to the airport.

ATA Airlines (ATA) took over Chicago Express Airlines, also known as ATA Connection, whose primary hub was at Midway.
Chicago Express served as a regional airline connecting to airports around the Great Lakes regions.

Following the September 11 attacks, which resulted in a drop in passenger service, along with other problems for the airline industry, both Vanguard and National ceased operations at Midway and became defunct in 2002, with MetroJet being dissolved and refolded into US Airways&#x27; main line in late 2001.

In 2002, Midway welcomed the return of international service after a 40-year absence with the opening of the new Federal Inspection Service facility in Concourse A.

In June 2004, Mayor Daley and airline officials celebrated the completion of the Terminal Development Program. The project, designed by HNTB resulted in the addition of 14 gates (from 29 to 43). A new 6,300-space economy parking garage, including a new bridge and roadway for buses shuttling passengers to and from the terminal, opened in December 2005.

Simultaneous to Midway&#x27;s expansion, ATA Airlines began rapid expansion at Midway in the early 2000s (decade), and was the airport&#x27;s dominant carrier prior to 2004, using 14 of the 17 gates in Concourse A. However, after the airline declared bankruptcy in October 2004, scheduled service from Midway significantly decreased.

For over 16 years, Midway had been the main hub for Indianapolis-based ATA, but the airline announced in March 2008 that it would end all flights from Midway on June 7, 2008. Even before that could happen, though, ATA filed for bankruptcy on April 2, 2008, and ceased all flights the following day.

In November 2008, Porter Airlines, which flies between Midway and Billy Bishop Toronto City Airport, was the only international route served from Chicago–Midway after ATA Airlines, which had flights to Mexico, ceased operations in April that year. On December 13, 2010, a second carrier, Volaris, began flights between Guadalajara and Midway.

Starting in early 2009, a construction project added a new walkway and food court to Concourse A. The project also connected gates A4A and A4B to the main A concourse. Expansions were completed in the spring of 2010.

===Privatization attempts===
Chicago has considered privatizing the airport, but the deals fell through in 2009 and 2013.

On April 20, 2009, a $2.5 billion deal to privatize the airport via a 99-year lease fell through when the consortium could not put together financing. The city would have kept $125 million in the down payment. The consortium operating under the name of Midway Investment and Development Company LLC consisted of Vancouver Airport Services, Citi Infrastructure Investors, and Boston&#x27;s John Hancock Life Insurance. It was awarded the contract in October 2008 by the City Council, which voted 49–0 to approve it. The consortium would have operated the airport and collected airport parking, concession, and passenger facility charges. However, Chicago would have continued to provide fire and police services.

In September 2013, Mayor Rahm Emanuel terminated new negotiations to privatize the airport, noting that the process was no longer competitive after one of the two finalists had backed out. The one remaining was Great Lakes Airport Alliance – a partnership of Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets and Ferrovial. Macquarie was one of the investors in the Chicago Skyway. The group that had backed out was a group that included the Australia-based Industry Funds Management and Manchester Airports Group. The Great Lakes proposal had been valued at $2 billion and would have involved a 40-year lease.

=== Modernization program ===
Construction began on expansions of the security checkpoint and main parking garage. The bridge spanning Cicero Ave is being widened from 50 feet to over 400 feet, allowing up to 17 security lanes and a streamlined queue. As the current terminal opened just a few months prior to the September 11th attacks, the security area was quickly rendered too small for the new screening measures and subsequently was forced to expand inward, taking away from space in the concourses. Space that is reclaimed by moving security outward into the bridge will be redeveloped with an expansion of the central food court. The main parking garage is being extended eastward over the CTA L tracks to add 1,500 spaces and streamline the entrance way. In addition to the redeveloped central food court, new concession options will open in phases including a food court in Concourse A utilizing previously unused space built during the 2010 rebuild of the Gate A4A/B connecting walkway. The program is the largest capital improvements project at the airport since the 2001 terminal redevelopment and has been completed

==Facilities==

All terminals and hangars were on the square periphery. By the late 1970s, the shorter north–south and east–west runway pairs had been closed, though some were converted to taxiways. The other four runways remain in use, all strengthened and enhanced, but about the same lengths as always. A short runway (13R/31L) for light aircraft was added in 1989.

Chicago Midway International Airport covers just over one square mile () and has four active runways:

* 13C/31C: , air carrier runway, ILS-equipped
* 4R/22L: , air carrier runway, ILS-equipped
* 4L/22R: , general aviation and air taxi
* 13R/31L: , light aircraft only

Midway is surrounded by buildings and other development, so the landing thresholds of the runways are displaced to provide obstacle clearance. The FAA and the airlines ensure safety by adhering to calculated load limits and various weather minimums. Because of the displaced landing thresholds, the runways have shorter distances available for landings than for takeoffs. 13C/31C, the longest runway, only has an available landing distance of in the southeast direction, and to the northwest. The largest aircraft normally seen at Midway is the Boeing 757. Normally, commercial planes only take off from and land on runways 4R/22L and 13C/31C. The other runways are used by smaller aircraft and, per the US FAA Chart Supplement, are restricted from use by large commercial aircraft except in emergency. Runway 13L/31R was permanently closed after 82 years on August 9, 2023, and was converted to Taxiway H.

===Terminal===
Midway has 43 aircraft gates on three concourses.

*Concourse A has 17 gates.
*Concourse B has 23 gates. 
*Concourse C has 3 gates.

==Accidents and incidents==
On December 8, 1972, United Air Lines Flight 553, a Boeing 737-200, crashed into a residential area outside Midway during landing. The crash of the 737-200 killed 43 of the 61 on board, and two on the ground. One of the victims on the plane was Dorothy Hunt, the wife of Watergate conspirator E. Howard Hunt. She was carrying $10,000 in cash. James McCord alleged that she supplied the Watergate defendants with money for legal expenses.

Exactly 33 years later, on December 8, 2005, Southwest Airlines Flight 1248, a Boeing 737-700 inbound from Baltimore–Washington International Airport in Baltimore, Maryland, slid off the runway while attempting to land at the airport in a heavy snow storm. The airplane broke through the barrier fence of the airport, and came to rest at the intersection of 55th Street and Central Avenue bordering the airport at its northwest corner. A 6-year-old boy was killed as a passenger in a vehicle that was struck by the plane after it skidded into the street.

<doc id="249637" wikidata="Q200682" url="?curid=249637" title="Battle of Queenston Heights">
<text>The Battle of Queenston Heights was the first major engagement of the War of 1812. The battle took place on 13 October 1812 at Queenston in Upper Canada (now Ontario) and was a decisive British victory.

United States regulars and New York militia led by Major General Stephen Van Rensselaer crossed the Niagara River from Lewiston and engaged British regulars and Canadian militia led by Major General Isaac Brock. Major General Roger Hale Sheaffe took command of British forces after Brock was killed. Mohawk warriors led by John Norton supported the British during the battle.

The battle was an American attempt to establish a foothold on the Canadian side of the Niagara River before campaigning ended with the onset of winter. The British victory was mainly due to the poorly managed American offensive. Despite their numerical advantage and the widely dispersed British forces defending the Niagara frontier, the Americans were unable to get the bulk of their invasion force across the Niagara River because of British artillery and the reluctance of the inexperienced American militia. As a result, British reinforcements arrived, defeated the unsupported American forces, and forced a surrender. The battle is considered historically significant mainly due to the loss of the British commander.

==Background==
The United States invasion across the Niagara River was originally intended to be part of a four-pronged attack on Upper and Lower Canada. Brigadier General William Hull would attack Amherstburg from Detroit, Major General Van Rensselaer would attack across the Niagara River, another attack would cross Lake Ontario to take Kingston, and Major General Henry Dearborn, the commander-in-chief of the United States Army, would use the Lake Champlain route to capture Montreal. These attacks were expected to bring the two British colonies to their knees and ensure a quick victory.

The attacks failed or were never launched. Hull was besieged at Detroit and, fearing a massacre by Britain&#x27;s Indigenous allies, surrendered Fort Detroit and his entire command on 13 August. Meanwhile, Dearborn and his forces remained inactive at Albany, New York and seemed to be in no hurry to attack Kingston or Montreal.

Van Rensselaer was unable to launch an attack across the Niagara River in the summer of 1812 due to the lack of men and supplies. Although he held the rank of major general in the New York state militia he had also never commanded soldiers in battle. Van Rensselaer was considered the leading Federalist candidate for the governorship of New York. Hoping to get Van Rensselaer out of the way, New York governor Daniel Tompkins had put Van Rensselaer&#x27;s name forward to command the army on the Niagara. Van Rensselaer officially took command on 13 July 1812. He secured the appointment of his second cousin, Lieutenant Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer, as his aide-de-camp. Solomon van Rensselaer was an experienced soldier who had been wounded at the Battle of Fallen Timbers in 1794, and a valuable source of advice to his cousin.

==Prelude==
===British moves===
Major General Isaac Brock was both the civil administrator of Upper Canada and the commander of the military forces there. He was an aggressive commander, and his successful capture of Detroit in August 1812 had won him praise, the reputation as the &quot;Saviour of Upper Canada&quot; and a knighthood, the news of which would not reach Upper Canada until after his death. His superior at Quebec, Lieutenant General Sir George Prevost, was of a more cautious bent, and the two clashed over strategy.

After his victory at Detroit, Brock had hastened back east, planning to cross the Niagara River and attack Van Rensselaer before he could be reinforced. Prevost, however, vetoed this plan and ordered Brock to behave more defensively. Not only was Prevost concerned by Brock&#x27;s apparently rash actions, but he was also aware that the British Government had revoked the Orders in Council which had hampered American trade with France, thus removing one of the stated causes of the war. Provost believed that peace negotiations might ensue and did not wish to prejudice any talks by taking offensive action. He opened talks with Major General Dearborn, who agreed to an informal armistice. President Madison rejected Dearborn action and ordered him &quot;to proceed with the utmost vigor in your operations.&quot; Hostilities resumed on 4 September.

While Brock had been at Detroit, Major General Sheaffe had been in command of the troops on the Niagara frontier. Acting under Prevost&#x27;s orders, Sheaffe had negotiated an armistice with Lieutentant Colonel Van Rensselaer on 20 August, and had voluntarily restricted the movement of British troops and supplies. Brock returned to Niagara on 22 August, to find the armistice in effect. The terms of the armistice permitted the use of the river by both powers as a common waterway and the British could only watch as American reinforcements and supplies arrived. When the truce ended, Major General Van Rensselaer&#x27;s forces were in much better shape than they had been previously.

===American moves===
The only significant American military presence along the Niagara River before June 1812 had been a company of artillery at Fort Niagara. In early June, a regiment of 600 militia volunteers commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Philetus Swift was dispatched to reinforce the garrison and establish camps at Black Rock and Lewiston. In early July, and additional 400 regulars and 1,200 militia arrived under the command of Brigadier General William Wandsworth. When Van Rensselaer arrived in mid-August this number had been reduced to roughly 1,400 due to sickness, desertions and furloughs, however, additional soldiers and artillery continued to arrive over the next several weeks. By the end of September, a brigade of 1,200 regulars under the command Brigadier General Alexander Smyth were encamped at Black Rock. Canadian historian Robert Malcolmson has calculated that at the time of the Battle of Queenston Heights, Van Rensselaer&#x27;s army consisted of roughly 2,484 regulars, 4,070 New York militia and 160 Pennsylvania militia.

Although Hull had failed at Detroit, and Dearborn had yet to make any move against Montreal or Kingston, Van Rensselaer was convinced he had the strength to invade Upper Canada. He planned to cross the Niagara River from Lewiston and take the heights above Queenston, while Smyth crossed the river near Fort Niagara and captured Fort George. Smyth, however, failed to attend a council of officers in early October to plan the attack. Although a lawyer by trade, Smyth was a regular officer who refused to acknowledge that Van Rensselaer outranked him. Van Rensselaer, an amiable politician in a hurry to launch the invasion, chose to proceed with the attack from Lewiston only. His goal was to establish a fortified bridgehead around Queenston, where he could maintain his army in winter quarters while planning for a campaign in the spring.

On 9 October, American sailors, artillerymen, and volunteers from the militia, commanded by Lieutenant Jesse Elliot, launched a successful boarding attack on the brigs &quot;Caledonia&quot; and &quot;Detroit&quot;, anchored near Fort Erie at the head of the Niagara River. Both brigs were captured, although &quot;Detroit&quot; subsequently ran aground and was set on fire to prevent it being recaptured. Brock feared this might presage an attack by Smyth from Black Rock and galloped to Fort Erie. He soon realized that there was no immediate danger from Smyth, and returned to his headquarters in Niagara that night. It was mistakenly reported to Van Rensselaer that Brock had left in haste for Detroit. 

Van Rensselaer decided to launch his attack in the early hours of 11 October, even though Colonel Van Solomon Rensselaer, who was to lead the attack&#x27;s first wave, was ill. He Van Rensselaer sent orders to Smyth to march his brigade to Lewiston in preparation for the attack &quot;with every possible dispatch.&quot; Smyth&#x27;s brigade set out upon receipt of the letter, however, because of foul weather, the route to Lewiston was so bad that abandoned wagons could be seen &quot;sticking in the road.&quot; The same weather drenched Van Rensselaer&#x27;s men at Lewiston as they waited to embark. The officer in charge of the boats is alleged to have rowed his boat away and deserted the army, taking with him most of the oars. By the time the oars could be replaced, the attack had to be postponed.

When Smyth received word that the attack had been delayed, he ordered his men back to their camp at Black Rock, rather than press on to Lewiston. He wrote to Van Rensselaer on 12 October that his brigade would not be in condition to move out again until 14 October. Van Rensselaer, however, had decided that a second attempt would be made on 13 October.

===Advanced warning===
Brock was aware of the failed American attempt to cross the Niagara River at Queenston on 11 October but believed it may have been a faint to distract him from a major attack elsewhere. On 12 October, Brock&#x27;s Brigade Major, Major Thomas Evans crossed the Niagara River under a flag of truce to request an exchange of prisoners taken in Elliot&#x27;s raid on the British brigs three days before. He attempted to see Colonel Solomon Van Rensselaer but was told the Colonel was ill. Instead, he was met by a man who called himself Toock, who claimed to be General Stephen Van Rensselaer&#x27;s secretary. Toock, who was probably Van Rensselaer&#x27;s military secretary Major John Lovett, repeatedly insisted that no exchange could be arranged for a couple of days at least. Evans was struck by the repetition of this phrase and had also spotted several boats hidden under bushes along the shore. He deduced that a crossing was planned for 13 October, but when he returned to the British lines a gathering of officers responded to his statement with skepticism. Brock, however, took Evans aside and after a private meeting became convinced of the possibility. He instructed his officers to be ready for immediate action and sent dispatch riders to warn the nearby militia commanders.

==Battle==
===British dispositions===

The village of Queenston is located on the west side of the Niagara River at the north end of the Niagara Gorge. In 1812, it was home to roughly 300 inhabitants and 20 scattered dwellings surrounded by gardens and orchards. A wharf and stone guardhouse had been constructed in 1791. South of the village, the ground rose to the promontory known as Queenston Heights. The slope from from the river to the heights was steep but overgrown with shrubs and trees, making it possible to climb. The river was fast-flowing and roughly wide but was described as being &quot;little trouble to even an indifferent oarsman.&quot;

Queenston was protected by 450 regulars and militia under the command of Captain James Dennis. In the village was Dennis&#x27;s grenadier company of the 49th Regiment of Foot, the two flank companies of the 2nd Regiment of York Militia, the two flank companies of the 5th Regiment of Lincoln Militia, and a ten-man detachment from the 41st Regiment of Foot. A nine-pounder gun had been positioned near the guardhouse, and an 18-pounder gun and eight-inch mortar were positioned in a redan two-thirds of the way up the escarpment above Queenston. The guns were manned by members of the 1st Lincoln Artillery, supervised by a small detachment of Royal Artillery personnel. The light company of the 49th Regiment under Captain John Williams protected the redan.

A 12-pounder gun and a 18-pounder carronade, also manned by the 1st Lincoln Artillery, were sited at Vrooman&#x27;s Point, a mile north of the village, while a nine-pounder gun and a second 18-pound carronade were at Brown&#x27;s Point two miles further to the north. These positions were guarded by the two flank companies of the 3rd Lincoln.

An additional 260 regulars and 300 militia were based at Fort George ten miles to the north. Nearby was a encampment of the Six Nations of the Grand River that could field 160 warriors, while at Chippewa to the south were 150 members of the 41st Regiment and 100 militia from the 2nd Lincoln.

===American landing===
Queenston was attacked by the 6th, 13th, and 23rd Infantry Regiments Joining the attack were the 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th, and 20th Regiments of New York Militia, supported by a detachment of volunteer riflemen Van Rensselaer&#x27;s plan called for 900 regulars and 2,650 militia to cross the river. The Americans had twelve batteaux, each of which could carry thirty men, and two larger batteux which were fitted with platforms on which field guns or wagons could be carried. The first wave of the boats would carry 40 artillerymen, 150 militia, and 150 regulars. Lieutenant Colonel Van Rensselaer would lead the militia contingent while Lieutenant Colonel John Chrystie of the 13th U.S. Infantry would lead the regulars.

The invasion was supported the 2nd Artillery Regiment, commanded by Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott, two companies of the New York State Militia Artillery, and an artillery detachment from Fort Niagara. Two 18-pounder guns had been placed in an earthwork named &quot;Fort Gray&quot; on Lewiston Heights with a mortar located nearby. Scott&#x27;s two 6-pounder field guns were positioned just south of the village of Lewiston several hundred yards north of the embarkation point.
The Americans began crossing the river a few hours before dawn on 13 October. Three of the boats, including Chrystie&#x27;s, struggled against the current and returned to the American side of the river. The remaining ten boats under Lieutenant Colonel van Rensselaer approached the narrow gravel beach south of the village. British guards spotted the boats as they approached and opened fire before hastening to the village to spread the alarm. After landing, the Americans climbed the riverbank, formed a column and began advancing towards the village, but were met by a detachment of British regulars and militia under the command of Captain Dennis. During the intense firefight that followed, Lieutenant Colonel Van Rensselaer was hit in the thigh by a musket ball then hit five more times in the heel, thighs and calf. Although he survived, he spent the of the battle out of action, weak from loss of blood. Captain John E. Wool of the 13th U.S. Infantry, who had also been wounded, took over command. Wool pulled his men back to the landing point while Dennis withdrew back to the village.

Meanwhile, the British artillery opened fire on the boats and embarkation point, while the American artillery attempted to silence the British guns. As a second wave of boats started across the river, the crews of three of them, one of which was carrying Chrystie, panicked when they came under fire and turned back. One of the others was sunk by the British 9-pounder in the village but as dawn approached, American artillery fire disabled the gun. 

A number of boats carrying Lieutenant Colonel John Fenwick (formerly the commandant at Fort Niagara) and 80 men came under intense fire they landed at Hamilton Cove at the north end of the village. Captain Dennis moved quickly to prevent the Americans from establishing a foothold by rushing more of the 49th and the militia to the cove, while Captain William&#x27;s company moved down from the redan to the south end of village. During the fierce engagement, Fenwick was hit at least three times including once in the eye. General Van Rensellaer&#x27;s aide-de-camp, Major John Lovett, wrote that Fenwick was &quot;clothed with bullets.&quot; With their boats&#x27; hulls perforated from musket fire, and with many of their comrades killed or wounded, Fenwick&#x27;s detachment quickly surrendered. One officer and five other men managed to escape in a boat carrying six of the wounded.

Meanwhile Captain Peter Oglivie with the rest of the 13th Infantry had crossed the river and reinforced Van Rensellaer and Wool. Before Van Rensellaer was evacuated with the wounded, he ordered Wool and Oglivie to head upstream, climb the heights and storm the redun battery. Lieutenant John Gansevoort who had been posted at Fort Niagara before the war and knew the area, was ordered to guide them.

At Niagara, Brock had been awakened by the noise of the artillery at Queenston. Although he thought the attack might only be a diversion, he decided to ride there immediately, followed shortly afterwards by his aides, Lieutenant Colonel John Macdonnell and Captain John Glegg. At Brown&#x27;s Point he encountered the detachment of the 3rd York preparing to march to Queenston and urged them onwards. He briefly stopped at Vrooman&#x27;s Point, and after learning that the enemy was out of range of the carronade, continued galloping towards Queenston where he arrived shortly after dawn.

By this time, Wool and Oglivie had ascended the heights and concealed by the forest had moved into position behind the redan. Without Captain Williams&#x27;s company to protect them, the artillerymen fled as soon as the Americans emerged from the trees. Brock immediately dispatched a message to Major General Sheaffe at Fort George, ordering him to send reinforcements.

Brock resolved to retake the redan without waiting for reinforcements. At the foot of the escarpment he assembled a body of men from Williams&#x27;s company and from the flank companies of the 2nd York and 5th Lincoln, and placing himself at the head of the soldiers from the 49th, led them up the slope in a frontal attack against the redan. Brock was struck in the wrist by a musket ball but continued upwards towards the enemy. His height, energetic gestures, and officer&#x27;s uniform made him an obvious target. An American soldier stepped forward from a thicket and fired at the general from a range of barely . The ball struck Brock in the chest, killing him almost instantly. While the British continued their attack, several men, supervised by Captain Glegg, carried Brock&#x27;s body from the field and hid in a house diagonally opposite the home of Laura Secord. Williams then pull everyone back into the forested area west of the redan where he was joined by Lieutenant Colonel Macdonell and the detachment of the 3rd York from Vrooman&#x27;s Point.

Although he was lawyer by trade with little military experience, Lieutenant Colonel Macdonell led a second attempt, together with Williams, to retake the redan. Macdonell and Williams slowly advanced through the shelter of trees until they were about from the enemy, unaware that Wool and Oglivie had been reinforced. The 49th and 3rd York charged forward and began pushing the Americans back. Someone at the redan panicked and spiked the 18-pounder, however, the battle&#x27;s momentum turned when a musket ball hit Macdonell&#x27;s mount, causing it to rear and twist around. A second shot hit Macdonell in the small of the back, causing him to fall from his horse. At the same time, Williams was knocked unconscious by a musket ball that grazed his skull. As the British attack faltered, the Americans pressed forward and took 21 prisoners. Williams, who despite his wound had regained consciousness, retreated with the rest of his men to the village, bringing with them the mortally wounded Macdonell down to Queenston. Captain Dennis then ordered his forces to abandon Queenston and pull back to Durham&#x27;s Farm near Vrooman&#x27;s Point.

According to popular legend, Brock&#x27;s last words were &quot;Push on, brave York Volunteers,&quot; however, the consensus among most historians and biographers is that the general died without saying a word. Forensic analysis of his uniform coat (now in the collection of the Canadian War Museum) and the eyewitness account of George Jarvis, support this theory.

Jarvis, a gentleman volunteer with the 49th Regiment wrote that Brock:

The location of the gunshot hole in the coat indicates that the projectile likely passed through Brock&#x27;s sternum and ruptured his aorta and pulmonary arteries. Death would have been almost instananeous and Brock would have been incapable of saying anything. It is possible, however, that Brock did say &quot;Push on, brave York Volunteers,&quot; or words to that effect, as he passed the 3rd York at Brown&#x27;s Point.

===Midday===
By mid-morning, the Americans were only opposed by the 12-pounder at Vrooman&#x27;s Point which was at its maximum range. The Americans moved several hundred fresh reinforcements and a 6-pounder field gun across the river to the Queenston landing, then up to the heights. They unspiked the 18-pounder in the redan but its field of fire on the west side of the river was limited. Meanwhile, American soldiers entered the village and began looting. 
Lieutenant Colonel Chrystie finally succeeded in crossing to Queenston and briefly took command of the American troops on the heights. When Brigadier-General William Wadsworth arrived, Christie returned to Lewiston to brief General Van Rensselaer. Unaware that Wadsworth had crossed the river, Van Rensselaer had asked Lieutenant Colonel Winfield Scott of the 2nd Artillery to take command at Queenston Heights. When Scott arrived, Wadsworth, who was nominally present as a volunteer, waived his right to command and took charge of the militia. Scott&#x27;s command consisted of a collection of unorganised detachments, some without their officers. Likewise, some officers had crossed the river but their men had refused to follow them. It has been calculated that roughly 1,350 American soldiers crossed the river on 13 October.

Sheaffe arrived at Durham&#x27;s Farm in the mid-morning followed closely by the first of the British reinforcements from Fort George. A detachment of the Royal Artillery under Captain William Holcroft, with two 6-pounder guns and a 5.5 inch howitzer, advanced on the village, supported by a company of the 41st under Captain William Derenzy. Captain Alexander Hamilton of the Niagara Light Dragoons guided them to firing positions near his home overlooking the river. When the artillery opened fire it once again became hazardous for the American boats to cross the river. Two American boats were sunk, and the two six-pounders near Lewiston were repeatedly silenced by shrapnel fire. Meanwhile, Derenzy slowly began pushing the Americans out of the village. 

At the same time, Mohawk warriors from the Grand River under John Norton had climbed the escarpment well to the west of Queenston and were approaching Scott&#x27;s position from the south. Norton encountered a militia scouting party that fled towards the safety of their line. A body of infantry moved forward to cover the patrol&#x27;s retreat and exchanged fire with the Mohawk. Unwilling to mount a frontal attack, Norton headed west into the woods, then silently circled around to the north side of the American lines. Norton &quot;discharged Leaden death among them&quot; then pulled back to the west. In response Scott led several companies in a slow advance westwards, halting to deliver volleys before entering the woods. In the ensuing skirmish both the Mohawk and the Americans suffered casualties. Faced with mounting casualties, Scott&#x27;s men began an orderly withdrawal back to their lines, while Norton continued to harass the Americans. 

Major General Van Rensselaer finally crossed over to Queenston but did not ascend to the heights until after Scott had pulled back to the American lines. Van Rensselaer decided to return to Lewiston and arrange for ammunition and more men to be sent across. At the landing he witnessed a group of soldiers suddenly swarm a boat and shove off, desperate to reach the safely of the other side. In the aftermath of Norton&#x27;s attack, a significant number of American soldiers had begun to abandon their posts, badly affected by the sight of the dead and wounded, and the war cries of the Mohawk. 

After returning to the eastern shore, Van Rensselaer discovered that none of the militia were willing to cross the river. He later reported that &quot;...to my utter astonishment, I found that at the very moment when complete victory was in our hands, the ardor of the unengaged troops had entirely subsided. I rode in all directions—urged men by every consideration to pass over—but in vain.&quot; He dispatched a message to Wadsworth and Scott which left the decision whether to stand and fight or retreat across the river to them, promising to send boats if the decision was made to withdraw.

===Sheaffe&#x27;s attack===
At Durham&#x27;s farm, additional reinforcements had arrived from Niagara. In addition to the most of the force that had been in Queenston, Sheaffe now had at his disposal two more companies of the 41st Regiment; the flank companies of the 1st Lincoln, 4th Lincoln, and 1st York; Runchey&#x27;s Coloured Company, and the Niagara Dragoons. An artillery detachment under Lieutenant William Crowther of the 41st arrived with two three-pounder field guns transported by the Provincial Royal Artillery Drivers or &quot;Car Brigade,&quot; a militia unit commanded by Captain Isaac Swayze and responsible for moving field guns and munitions during military engagements. Sheaffe sent a dispatch to Chippewa, ordering the three companies of the 41st Regiment and the flank companies of the 2nd Lincoln to march north and rendezvous with him to the south of the heights.

Sheaffe set out with approximately 650 men and marched across fields to ascend the escarpment about a mile west of Queenston. His forces then circled around to south, having following the path that Norton had taken earlier. Sheaffe positioned the main body of his regulars facing north and directly in front of the American line at a distance of about . The two light companies of regulars, Runchey&#x27;s Coloured Company, and Norton&#x27;s Mohawks moved into position west of the American position. When the reinforcement from Chippewa arrived, Sheaffe ordered them into position on his eastern flank.

Just after 3:00 p.m, Sheaffe gave the order to advance. His regulars marched forward to within of the American line then volleyed &quot;en masse&quot;. The Americans volleyed in return then began to pull back. The British continued to advance by platoon, halting and firing as they did so, until they were exchanging point-blank fire with the retreating Americans. Meanwhile the light companies, the Coloured Company and the Mohawks moved in from the west. While some of the Americans were able to make an orderly retreat towards the landing, others panicked and threw down their weapons or fell to the deaths trying to climb down the cliff. As they retreated they encountered many of those who had earlier abandoned the posts and had taken shelter among the trees along the river. They soon discovered that no boats were waiting to evacuate them. Some tried to swim to safety and were shot at. Scott wrote that it took three attempts with a flag of truce to surrender before the British finally ceased firing roughly an hour after the attack began.

===Casualties===
The British official casualty return gave 14 killed, 77 wounded, and 21 missing, not including casualties suffered by the Mohawk. Malcomson, however, determined that the official return underestimated casualties and has calculated that the regulars and militia suffered 16 killed, 83 wounded, and 21 captured, with a further five killed, two wounded, and one captured among the Mohawk. Among the wounded was James Secord, the husband of Laura Secord.

The number of Americans killed in the battle has been variously estimated at between 60 and 100. 82 severely wounded Americans were evacuated across the Niagara before the surrender, of whom two died soon after. 955 Americans were initially captured by the British, including 120 severely wounded officers and men. This was more than the hospital at Niagara could accommodate, so some of them had to be cared for in the court house or in nearby churches. The number of the walking wounded, who were seen by the British surgeons and then kept with the other prisoners, has not been recorded. Of the severely wounded prisoners, 30 died within a few days.The report on prisoners issued on 15 October recorded 19 officers and 417 enlisted men from the regulars, and 54 officers and 435 other ranks from the militia. The 80 surviving wounded in the American hospital, and the 90 surviving wounded prisoners were presumably the basis for General Van Rensselaer&#x27;s statement, in a letter to Dearborn on 20 October, that &quot;the aggregate&quot; of his information would indicate that 170 Americans had been wounded in the battle. This gives total American casualties of 60 to 100 killed, 80 wounded, 90 wounded prisoners and 835 other prisoners. Six officers (four regular and two militia) were among the killed; 11 officers (six regular and five militia) were among the wounded who escaped captured and eight officers (four regular and four militia) were among the wounded prisoners. Those captured included Brigadier General Wadsworth, Lieutenant Colonel Scott and four other lieutenant colonels. A six-pounder gun and the colours of a New York Militia regiment were also captured.

==Aftermath==
After the battle, Sheaffe proposed a temporary truce and invited Van Rensselaer to send surgeons to assist in treating the wounded. Within days all of the walking wounded as well as all of the militia prisoners were paroled and sent back across the river including Wadsworth. The regulars, including Scott and Christie, were sent down to Quebec and were exchanged at the end of November.

 On October 16, Van Rensselaer turned over command of his remaining forces to Alexander Smyth, the officer whose insolence had badly injured the invasion attempt. Smyth still had his regulars at Black Rock but refused to launch any attacks across the river until he had 3,000 men under his command. At the end of November, he launched a raid to prepare the ground for a full-scale invasion. Known as the Battle of Frenchman&#x27;s Creek, the raid was successful, but two subsequent attempts to cross the river near Fort Erie were called off due to the arrival of British reinforcements, the lack of boats, and inclement weather. With his men suffering from illness and poor morale, and faced with desertions and a breakdown of discipline, Smyth requested a month&#x27;s leave to visit his family, but failed to return from leave and was removed from the Army rolls three months later.

The question of who was to blame for the defeat was the subject of heated debate after the war. Stephen Van Rensselaer&#x27;s popularity remained high enough that he was able to continue his attempt to unseat Daniel Tompkins as Governor of New York, and although he was unsuccessful, he later served in the United States House of Representatives. General John Armstrong, Jr., who became the Secretary of War in 1813, pinned the blame the general in his &quot;Notices of the War of 1812&quot;, published in 1836. This provoked an indignant response from Solomon Van Rensselaer, who compared Armstrong to Benedict Arnold and laid the blame squarely on Lieutenant Colonel Chrystie (who had died of natural causes in July 1813). Van Rensselaer accused of Chrystie of cowardice and said &quot;to his failure may mainly be attributed all our disasters.&quot;

Despite the victory, the loss of Major General Brock was a major blow to the British. Brock had inspired his own troops and the militia and civilian authorities in Upper Canada by his confidence and constant activity. Sheaffe, his successor, received a baronetcy for his part in the victory but did not command the same respect, and was known as a harsh disciplinarian. His success where Brock had rashly sacrificed himself could not help him escape censure for not having followed up the victory at Queenston Heights with an attack on Fort Niagara (which had been evacuated by its garrison after a bombardment from British batteries that afternoon). The following April, Shaeffe was defeated by a numerically superior American force at the Battle of York. Although his decision to retreat with his few regulars was accepted by his superiors (and his American opponents), it left the local militia, the Assembly of Upper Canada and the population of York feeling abandoned and aggrieved. Shaeffe was removed from his civil and military commands and later recalled to Britain.

==Legacy==

A 56 metre (185 foot) column atop Queenston Heights, known as Brock&#x27;s Monument, commemorates the battle as well as the memory of the British general who died there. Brock and Lieutenant-Colonel John Macdonell, are interred at the monument&#x27;s base. The monument was built between 1853 and 1856 and replaced an earlier monument that was destroyed in 1840. Brock is further commemorated by a bust at the Valiants Memorial in Ottawa.

The misspelled battle honour &quot;Queenstown&quot; was awarded to the 41st Regiment of Foot and the 49th Regiment of Foot. Their successor units in the modern British Army are the Royal Welsh Regiment and The Rifles Regiments. In the Canadian Army, the Lincoln and Welland Regiment, the 56th Field Artillery Regiment, the Queen&#x27;s York Rangers, and the Royal Hamilton Light Infantry perpetuate the history and heritage of the militia units that took part in the battle. These regiments also carry the &quot;Queenston&quot; battle honour.

Many poems and songs have been written about the battle. The song &quot;MacDonell on the Heights&quot;, was composed by Stan Rogers and included in Rogers&#x27;s 1984 posthumous album &quot;From Fresh Water&quot;. The song commemorates the role of John MacDonell in the battle. In 1959, as an answer to Johnny Horton&#x27;s hit record, &quot;The Battle of New Orleans&quot;, Toronto radio station CHUM recorded &quot;The Battle of Queenston Heights&quot;, with disk jockey Mike Darow on lead vocals. Credited to &quot;Mike Darrow and the CHUMS&quot;, the number became a regional hit in its own right, reaching #17 on CHUM&#x27;s own chart.

Brock University in St. Catharines, the city of Brockville, and several Ontario schools are named after Major General Brock, as are many municipal roads throughout Ontario. Ontario&#x27;s Highway 405 that connects the Queenston-Lewiston International Bridge to the Queen Elizabeth Way was designated the General Brock Parkway in 2006.

<doc id="249650" wikidata="Q1918047" url="?curid=249650" title="Mommie Dearest">
<text>Mommie Dearest is a memoir and exposé written by Christina Crawford, the adopted daughter of Academy Award winning actress Joan Crawford. Officially released by William Morrow and Company on November 10, 1978 (though thousands of copies had already been placed in bookstores in October), the book attracted much controversy for its portrayal of Joan Crawford as a cruel, unbalanced, and alcoholic mother, with Crawford&#x27;s other twin daughters, household staff, and family friends denouncing it as sensationalized fiction. It was turned into a 1981 film of the same title starring Faye Dunaway.

==Synopsis==
In the book, Christina alleges that Joan Crawford placed far more importance on her cinematic career than her family life, and that Joan later was an alcoholic in the 1960s. She also claims that Joan had sexual affairs with various men, whom Christina was required to call &quot;Uncle.&quot; Christina claimed that Joan&#x27;s controlling behavior continued throughout Christina&#x27;s adulthood, asserting that Joan was jealous of Christina&#x27;s acting career in the 1960s, to the point of taking over Christina&#x27;s role in the soap opera &quot;The Secret Storm&quot; while Christina was in the hospital recovering from an operation to remove an ovarian cyst. The book culminates with Christina learning that she and her brother, Christopher, were intentionally disinherited upon the death of their mother for &quot;reasons which are well known to them.&quot;

== Reactions ==
The book&#x27;s publication in 1978 created an enormous amount of attention. Some of Crawford&#x27;s friends disputed the version of events presented in &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;. Among them were Van Johnson, Katharine Hepburn, Cesar Romero, Bob Hope, Barbara Stanwyck, Sydney Guilaroff, Ann Blyth, Gary Gray, and Myrna Loy.

Douglas Fairbanks Jr., Crawford&#x27;s first husband, stated, &quot;The Joan Crawford that I&#x27;ve heard about in &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; is not the Joan Crawford I knew back then.&quot; Crawford&#x27;s other daughters, Cindy and Cathy, have stated many times that they did not witness or experience any of the events described in the book. Christopher Crawford, while never stating Joan outright abused him, did state, &quot;I honestly to this day do not believe that she ever cared for me.&quot;

Bette Davis, longtime rival of Crawford, denounced the book, stating, &quot;I was not Miss Crawford&#x27;s biggest fan, but, wisecracks to the contrary, I did and still do respect her talent. What she did not deserve was that detestable book written by her daughter. I&#x27;ve forgotten her name. Horrible.&quot;

Liz Smith, writing in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and other newspapers that carried her syndicated column, said, &quot;I was inclined to believe Joan was misguided in her attempts to &#x27;mold&#x27; her children—and was vain and self-absorbed like most great stars—but the stories of beatings and near-madness were over the top.&quot; 

Joan Crawford&#x27;s secretary for nearly 50 years, Betty Barker, also stated that while Joan was strict, Christina and Christopher were never abused.

On May 28, 1981, Christina&#x27;s sister, Cathy Crawford LaLonde, appeared on &quot;Good Morning America&quot; to deny the allegations made by Christina. She said on air &quot;My mother was a very warm person. She was always there when we needed her. She was a working mother, but she always had time for us, and as far as &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, it&#x27;s a great work of fiction. Christina must have been in another household.&quot;

In October 1981, &quot;People&quot; magazine published an article titled &quot;Was She Devil or Doting Mom?: &#x27;Dearest&#x27; Stirs A Row Among Joan Crawford&#x27;s Adopted Kids&quot;. During the interview, Cathy Crawford LaLonde, stated &quot;Christina says Joan was rotten, and I say she was a good person,&quot; further going on to say, &quot;I just can&#x27;t feel for anybody who would do that to their own mother. It&#x27;s very immoral.&quot;

Crawford&#x27;s other daughter, Cindy Crawford Jordan, told reporters in 1979, &quot;I can&#x27;t understand how people believe this stupid stuff Tina has written.&quot; 

In her 1987 autobiography, Myrna Loy stated &quot;She [Christina] wanted to be Joan Crawford. I think that&#x27;s the basis of the book she wrote afterward and everything else. I saw what Christina&#x27;s mind created, the fantasy world she lived in.&quot; 

Christina&#x27;s husband, producer Harvey Medlinsky, said in response to Christina&#x27;s memoir, &quot;I have only good things to say about Joan Crawford. She was always nice to me and Christina while we were married.&quot; 

&quot;The Secret Storm&quot; producer Gloria Monty, countered Christina&#x27;s allegation that Joan &quot;stole&quot; Christina&#x27;s role on the television show when she fell ill in 1968. According to Monty, Christina lied regarding this situation. Monty stated that she and CBS asked Joan to substitute for her daughter on the show, and that Joan agreed only in the interest of not allowing Christina to be permanently replaced by another actress until she could return to the show. Monty added, &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you that I saw Joan Crawford do everything she could to save that girl&#x27;s life and job.&quot; 

Helen Hayes, June Allyson, and Vincent Sherman stated they had witnessed strict discipline. For example, Hayes and Sherman both stated in their autobiographies that they felt Joan was too strict a parent. Allyson stated in her autobiography that she witnessed Joan put Christina in &quot;time-out&quot;, and did not let her go to a friend&#x27;s birthday party as a punishment. However these people never stated they witnessed any outright abuse.

On July 20, 1998, Cathy Crawford LaLonde filed a lawsuit against her sister Christina Crawford for defamation of character. LaLonde stated in her lawsuit that during the 20th-anniversary book tour of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, Christina publicly claimed to interviewers that LaLonde and her twin sister, Cynthia, were not biological sisters and that their adoption was never legal. Lalonde stated neither claim by Christina was true and attached copies of the twin girls&#x27; birth certificates and adoption documentation to the lawsuit. The lawsuit was later settled out of court for $5,000 plus court costs. Lawyer Richard Orloski, representing the twins at the time, said, “We proved our point, and her adopted sister should now be careful in the future, knowing she&#x27;ll be held accountable for her words&quot;.

== Epilogue ==
In 1981, the book was adapted into a movie, starring Faye Dunaway. Christina gave negative feedback about the film. For example, Christina never alleged to have been beaten by her mother; specifically, that she was never hit with a wire hanger, or that her mother chopped down a tree with an axe.

The last pages of Christina&#x27;s book suggest that she was not about to let her mother have the &quot;last word&quot; by omitting her daughter from her will. Biographer Fred Laurence Guiles later reported that Christina began writing her book before Crawford&#x27;s death. He has suggested that Joan&#x27;s knowledge of its contents may have been a factor in her cutting her daughter from her will.

Christina later released a &quot;20th Anniversary Edition&quot;, which included 100 pages of new material and omitted about 50 pages of original material. The second edition names specific individuals not named in the original book and focuses more on Christina&#x27;s relationship with her mother from high school graduation until the 1970s. It also reveals what became of her brother and describes several incidents involving him.

Released by a smaller publishing company, the second edition included some novel promotional methods. This included Christina appearing at presentations of the &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; film (based on the first edition of her book), where Christina lectured about the new edition of her book. Christina also appeared at readings with drag entertainer Lypsinka, who has made numerous appearances as Joan Crawford during stage acts.

In 2017 Crawford worked with lyricist and composer David Nehls on a stage musical adaptation of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;, which was produced by Out of the Box Theatrics in New York City.

==References in other media==

&quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a sketch parodying &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; on the ninth episode of its fourth season, airing on December 16, 1978. Jane Curtin portrayed Joan Crawford as mercurial, ill-tempered, and micromanaging. Gilda Radner played an exaggerated version of young Christina as mute and possibly mentally handicapped, puffing her cheeks out and crossing her eyes as she sauntered around the set. This sketch, which took place around Christmas, also featured Dan Aykroyd as Clark Gable, Bill Murray as Cary Grant, Laraine Newman as Katharine Hepburn, and guest host Elliott Gould as fictional character Archer Armstrong.

Victoria Beckham referenced the famous wire hangers scene in her music video for &quot;Let Your Head Go&quot;.

An episode of the PBS Kids American-Canadian television series &quot;Arthur&quot; featured an episode titled &quot;Caught In the Crosswires&quot; in which the character Muffy Crosswire, who is extremely wealthy, shouts at her butler, Bailey, for hanging her clothes on wire hangers. She shouts out, &quot;wire hangers? &quot;Wire&quot; hangers!?&quot; before proceeding to tear her clothes from the hangers and squish the hangers with her bare hands; the scene was a reference to the infamous &quot;wire hangers&quot; scene from the &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot; book and its film adaptation.

Four years after Joan Crawford&#x27;s death, Blue Öyster Cult released the song &quot;Joan Crawford&quot; as part of their album &quot;Fire of Unknown Origin&quot; (1981). In the final third of the song, there is a voice calling &quot;Christina&quot; with the lines &quot;Mother&#x27;s home&quot; and &quot;Come to mother&quot;. In the background, the word &quot;No&quot; is repeated over and over. This is in reference to parts described in the book.

The 1989 book &quot;Daddy&#x27;s Boy: A Son&#x27;s Shocking Account of Life with a Famous Father&quot;, is a comedic account of Chris Elliott&#x27;s childhood, with rebuttals from his father, comedian Bob Elliott. It is an obvious parody of &quot;Mommie Dearest&quot;.

<doc id="249654" wikidata="Q455968" url="?curid=249654" title="Erma Bombeck">
<text>Erma Louise Bombeck (&quot;née&quot; Fiste; February 21, 1927 – April 22, 1996) was an American humorist who achieved great popularity for her newspaper humor column describing suburban home life, syndicated from 1965 to 1996. Fifteen books of her humor have been published; most became bestsellers.

Between 1965 and April 17, 1996 – five days before her death – Bombeck wrote over four thousand newspaper columns, using broad and sometimes eloquent humor, chronicling the ordinary life of a Midwestern suburban housewife. By the 1970s, her columns were read semi-weekly by 30 million readers of the nine hundred newspapers in the United States and Canada. Her work stands as a humorous chronicle of middle-class life in America after World War II, among the generation of parents who produced the Baby Boomers.

==Early life==
Erma Fiste was born in Bellbrook, Ohio, to a working-class family, and was raised in Dayton. Her parents were Erma (&quot;née&quot; Haines) and Cassius Edwin Fiste, who was the city crane operator. Young Erma lived with her elder paternal half-sister, Thelma. She began elementary school one year earlier than usual for her age, in 1932, and became an excellent student and an avid reader. She particularly enjoyed the popular humor writers of the time. After Erma&#x27;s father died in 1936, she moved, with her mother, into her grandmother&#x27;s home. Her mother remarried in 1938, to Albert Harris (a moving van owner). Erma practiced tap dance and singing, and worked for a local radio station for a children&#x27;s revue for eight years.

===Formative years===
Erma entered Emerson Junior High School in 1940, and began writing a humorous column for its newspaper, &quot;The Owl&quot;. In 1942, she entered Parker (now Patterson) Vocational High School, where she wrote a serious column, mixing in bits of humor. That same year she began work at the &quot;Dayton Herald&quot; as a copygirl, sharing her full-time assignment with a girlfriend. In 1944, for her first journalistic work, she interviewed Shirley Temple, who visited Dayton, and the interview became a newspaper feature.

She completed high school in 1944 and sought to earn a college scholarship fund; for a year she worked as a typist and stenographer, for the &quot;Dayton Herald&quot; and several other companies, and also did minor journalistic assignments (obituaries, etc.) for the &quot;Dayton Herald&quot;. Using the money she earned, Erma enrolled in Ohio University at Athens, Ohio, in 1946. However, she failed most of her literary assignments and was rejected for the university newspaper. She left after one semester when her funds ran out.

Erma later enrolled in the University of Dayton, a Catholic college. She lived in her family home and worked at Rike&#x27;s, a department store, where she wrote humorous material for the company newsletter. In addition, she worked two part-time jobs – as a termite control accountant at an advertising agency and as a public-relations person at the local YMCA. While she was in college, her English professor, Bro. Tom Price, commented to Erma about her great prospects as a writer, and she began to write for the university student publication, &quot;The Exponent&quot;. She graduated in 1949 with a degree in English, and became a lifelong active contact for the university — helping financially and participating personally — and became a lifetime trustee of the institution in 1987. In 1949, she converted to Catholicism, from the United Brethren church, and married Bill Bombeck, a former fellow student of the University of Dayton, who was a veteran of the World War II Korean front. His subsequent profession was that of educator and school supervisor. Bombeck remained active in the church for the rest of her life.

==Housewife column==

===Housewife (1954–1964)===
The Bombecks were told by doctors that having a child was improbable, so they adopted a girl, Betsy, in 1953. Bombeck decided to become a full-time housewife and relinquished her career as a journalist. During 1954, Bombeck nevertheless wrote a series of humorous columns in the &quot;Dayton Shopping News&quot;.

Despite the former difficult diagnoses, Bombeck gave birth to her first son, Andrew, in 1956 and had her second son, Matthew, in 1958. The Bombeck family moved in 1959 to Centerville, Ohio, into a tract housing development, and were neighbors of Phil Donahue. The Bombeck home was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2015.

===&quot;At Wit&#x27;s End&quot; (1965)===
Bombeck resumed her writing career for the local &quot;Kettering-Oakwood Times&quot; in 1964, with weekly columns that yielded $3 each. She wrote in her small bedroom. The following year the &quot;Dayton Journal Herald&quot; requested new humorous columns as well, and Bombeck agreed to write two weekly 450-word columns for $50. After three weeks, the articles went into national syndication through the Newsday Newspaper Syndicate, into 36 major U.S. newspapers, with three weekly columns under the title &quot;At Wit&#x27;s End&quot;.

Bombeck quickly became a popular humorist nationwide. Beginning in 1966, she began doing lectures in the various cities where her columns appeared. In 1967, her newspaper columns were compiled and published by Doubleday, under the title &quot;At Wit&#x27;s End&quot;. And after a humorous appearance on Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s radio show, she became a regular radio guest on the show.

==Diversified production==

===Success (1970s)===
Aaron Priest, a Doubleday representative, became Bombeck&#x27;s agent. By 1969, five hundred U.S. newspapers featured her &quot;At Wit&#x27;s End&quot; columns, and she was also writing for &quot;Good Housekeeping&quot;, &quot;Reader&#x27;s Digest&quot;, &quot;Family Circle&quot;, &quot;Redbook&quot;, &quot;McCall&#x27;s&quot;, and &quot;Teen&quot; magazines. Bombeck and her family moved to Phoenix, Arizona, to a lavish hacienda on a hilltop in Paradise Valley.

By 1978, nine hundred U.S. newspapers were publishing Bombeck&#x27;s column.

===McGraw-Hill (1976)===
In 1976, McGraw-Hill published Bombeck&#x27;s &quot;The Grass Is Always Greener Over the Septic Tank&quot;, which became a best-seller. In 1978, Bombeck arranged both a million-dollar contract for her fifth book, &quot;If Life Is a Bowl of Cherries, What Am I Doing in the Pits?&quot; and a 700,000-copy advance for her subsequent book, &quot;Aunt Erma&#x27;s Cope Book&quot; (1979).

===Television===
At the invitation of television producer Bob Shanks, Bombeck participated in ABC&#x27;s &quot;Good Morning America&quot; from 1975 until 1986. She began doing brief commentaries, which were recorded in Phoenix, and eventually did both gag segments and serious interviews.

For several years, Bombeck was occupied with multiple writing and TV projects. In 1978, she attempted a television pilot of &quot;The Grass Is Always Greener&quot; on CBS. In 1981, Bombeck wrote and produced her own show, the also unsuccessful &quot;Maggie&quot;, for ABC. It aired for just four months (eight episodes) to poor reviews. Bombeck was quickly becoming overworked, returning from Los Angeles to Phoenix only during weekends. Bombeck was offered a second sitcom attempt but she declined.

===Equal Rights Amendment (1978)===
In 1978, Bombeck was involved in the Presidential Advisory Committee for Women, particularly for the final implementation of the Equal Rights Amendment, with the ERA America organization&#x27;s support. Bombeck was strongly criticized for this by conservative figures, and some U.S. stores reacted by removing her books. In 1972, the Equal Rights Amendment was proposed by the United States Congress to the states. Congress specified a seven-year period for ratification. Under Article V of the United States Constitution, ratification by at least three-fourths of the states is necessary, but at the end of the seven-year period, only 35 states had ratified, three less than the requirement. Of the 35 states that ratified the proposed amendment, five rescinded their ratifications prior to the deadline. Bombeck expressed dismay over this development..

===Great popularity (1980s)===
By 1985, Bombeck&#x27;s three weekly columns were being published by 900 newspapers in the United States and Canada, and were also being anthologized into a series of best-selling books. She was also making twice-weekly &quot;Good Morning America&quot; appearances. Bombeck belonged to the American Academy of Humor Columnists, along with other famous personalities. During the 1980s, Bombeck&#x27;s annual earnings ranged from $500,000 to $1 million a year.

She was the grand marshal for the 97th Tournament of Roses Parade held on January 1, 1986. The parade theme was &quot;A Celebration of Laughter&quot;.

==Death==
Bombeck was diagnosed with polycystic kidney disease (an incurable and untreatable genetic condition) when she was twenty years old. She survived breast cancer and a mastectomy and kept secret the fact that she had kidney disease, enduring daily dialysis. She went public with her condition in 1993. After she spent years on a waiting list for a transplant, one kidney had to be removed, and the remaining one ceased to function. On April 3, 1996, she received a kidney transplant. She died on April 22, 1996, aged sixty-nine, from complications of the operation. Her remains are interred in the Woodland Cemetery, Dayton, Ohio. She was survived by her husband, Bill Bombeck (1927–2018), and their three children.

==Legacy==
The Erma Bombeck Writers&#x27; Workshop started in 2000 at the University of Dayton as a one-time event to commemorate the Bombeck family&#x27;s gift of her papers to the university. The event proved so popular that it has been held every other year since then. The two-day, three-night workshop includes keynote speakers and breakout sessions on the topics of humor writing, human-interest writing, the publishing process, marketing for authors, and blogging, among other areas. Past keynote speakers have included Art Buchwald, Nancy Cartwright, Dave Barry, Garrison Keillor, Mike Peters, Bil Keane and Phil Donahue. More than 350 writers from around the country attend each workshop, which is held on the University of Dayton campus.

In 2004, University of Dayton alumnus Ralph Hamberg and his wife, Cindy, gave a $100,000 gift to start an endowment fund for the workshop, in memory of her cousin, Tom Price, a University of Dayton English professor who told Bombeck, &quot;You can write!&quot; The endowment helps keep the workshop affordable for writers. In addition, the University of Dayton&#x27;s Alumni Association underwrites the cost of scholarships that allow University of Dayton students to attend for free.

The workshop has spawned a blog, Humorwriters.org; a documentary produced by ThinkTV and distributed nationally through American Public Television; an international writing competition hosted by the Washington-Centerville Public Library; an Ohio historical marker on the University of Dayton&#x27;s campus; a monthly e-newsletter; a Facebook page; a Twitter feed; and an active online discussion group.

In 2006, the workshop created the world&#x27;s longest Mad Lib. In 2010, &quot;CBS Sunday Morning With Charles Osgood&quot; aired a Mother&#x27;s Day tribute to Bombeck, using the workshop as a backdrop. In 2013, &quot;AAA Journeys&quot; magazine traced Dayton&#x27;s literary heritage and pointed to the University of Dayton&#x27;s efforts to keep Bombeck&#x27;s legacy alive through a workshop in her name. In 2014, &quot;Parade&quot; magazine featured a series of pieces about the workshop and Bombeck&#x27;s enduring appeal.

A Chinese language translation of one of her works about her stepfather Albert Harris, &quot;Father&#x27;s Love&quot; (), is included as one of the sixty oral reading passages in China&#x27;s Putonghua Proficiency Test.

<doc id="249658" wikidata="Q15608352" url="?curid=249658" title="Tack (sailing)">
<text>A tack is the windward side of a sailing craft (side from which the wind is coming while under way)—the starboard or port tack. Generally, a craft is on a starboard tack if the wind is coming over the starboard (right) side with sails on port (left) side. Similarly, a craft is on a port tack if the wind is coming over the port (left). 

Tack is also a nautical term both for the lower, windward corner of a sail. 

==Windward side of course sailed==
As a point of reference, tack is the alignment of the wind with respect to a sailing craft under way. If the wind is from the starboard side of the sailing craft, it is on &quot;starboard tack&quot;, and if from port, on &quot;port tack&quot;. The International Regulations for Preventing Collisions at Sea for vessels underway declare that when the courses of two sailing vessels converge, the vessel on &quot;port tack&quot; must give way to a vessel on &quot;starboard tack&quot;. The maneuver of changing a sailing craft&#x27;s course from one tack to the other during which the wind direction is brought across the bow is called tacking; with the wind direction brought across the stern, it is called jibing for fore-and-aft rigged sailing craft, or &quot;wearing ship&quot; for square-rigged vessels.

When a boat is running with the wind coming directly from astern and the mainsail and jib are on opposite sides of the vessel, the windward side is considered to be that opposite to the site on which the mainsail is being carried. On a starboard tack the mainsail is on the port side; on a port tack the mainsail is on the starboard side.

== Sail corner ==
The tack is the corner on a fore-and-aft sail where the &quot;luff&quot; (the forward edge) and &quot;foot&quot; (the bottom edge) connect and, on a mainsail, is located near where the boom and mast connect. On a square sail or a spinnaker, the tack is the windward &quot;clew&quot; (lower corner) and also the line holding down that corner; when the vessel changes course to have the other vertical edge of the sail to the wind, the other clew becomes the tack.

<doc id="249662" wikidata="Q255565" url="?curid=249662" title="Carol Burnett">
<text>Carol Creighton Burnett (born April 26, 1933) is an American comedian, actress, and singer. Her comedy-variety series, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, which originally aired on CBS, was one of the first to be hosted by a woman. Burnett has performed on Broadway, on television, and in dramatic and comedic film roles. She has received numerous awards and accolades, including seven Golden Globe Awards, seven Primetime Emmy Awards, a Tony Award, and a Grammy Award. Burnett was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2005, the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor in 2013, and the Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award in 2015.

Burnett was born and raised in San Antonio, Texas, until her family moved to Hollywood, living a block away from Hollywood Boulevard. She attended Hollywood High School and eventually studied theater and musical comedy at UCLA. Later, she performed in nightclubs in New York City and had a breakout success on Broadway in 1959 in &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;, for which she received a Tony Award nomination. She soon made her television debut, regularly appearing on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; for the next three years, and won her first Emmy Award in 1962.

Eventually, Burnett moved back to Los Angeles and began an 11-year run as star of &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; on CBS television from 1967 to 1978. With its vaudeville roots, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; was a variety show that combined comedy sketches with song and dance. The comedy sketches included film parodies and character pieces. Burnett created many memorable characters during the show&#x27;s run, and both she and the show won numerous Emmy and Golden Globe Awards. During and after her variety show, Burnett appeared in many television and film projects.

Burnett&#x27;s film roles include &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972), &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974), &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981), &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992), and &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; (2008). She has acted in the dramas &quot;6 Rms Riv Vu&quot; (1974) and &quot;Friendly Fire&quot; (1979); in guest roles such as in &quot;Mad About You&quot;, for which she won an Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Comedy Series; and in various specials with Julie Andrews, Dolly Parton, and Beverly Sills. She returned to Broadway in &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot; (1995), receiving another Tony Award nomination. Recent acting roles include the AMC drama series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot; (2022) and the Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;Palm Royale&quot; (2024). Burnett wrote and narrated several memoirs, earning Grammy nominations for almost all of them, including a win for &quot;In Such Good Company&quot;. 

In 2019, the Golden Globes created the Carol Burnett Award for career achievement in television, giving Burnett the first award. She was honored with an NBC special &quot;Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love&quot; celebrating her 90th birthday.

== Early life and education ==

Carol Creighton Burnett was born on April 26, 1933, at Nix Hospital in San Antonio, Texas, the daughter of Ina Louise (née Creighton), a publicity writer for movie studios, and Joseph Thomas Burnett, a movie theater manager. Her maternal grandparents were William Henry Creighton (1873–1918) and Mabel Eudora &quot;Mae&quot; Jones (1885–1967). Her parents divorced in the late 1930s. Subsequently, both parents independently moved to Hollywood and Burnett moved with her grandmother to a one-room apartment near her mother. They lived in an impoverished area of Hollywood, California, in a boarding house with Burnett&#x27;s younger half-sister Chrissie.

When Burnett was in second grade, she briefly invented an imaginary twin sister named Karen, with Shirley Temple-like dimples. She later recalled that, motivated to further the pretense, she &quot;fooled the other boarders in the rooming house where we lived by frantically switching clothes and dashing in and out of the house by the fire escape and the front door. Then I became exhausted and Karen mysteriously vanished.&quot; When Burnett was nine, she taught herself how to do the &quot;Tarzan yell&quot;, which she realized years later was a good vocal exercise for volume, and it became a fan favorite. Burnett&#x27;s first experiences with singing were with her family. Her grandmother was a trained musician who could play the piano (although they did not have one at the time), and her mother played the ukulele, so they sometimes sang popular songs in harmony together around the kitchen table. Her grandmother frequently took Burnett and her sister to the movies. They would take a few rolls of toilet paper home from the theater. The movies she saw in her youth influenced the sketch content in &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;.
Burnett worked as an usherette at the Warner Brothers Theater (now the Hollywood Pacific Theatre). When the cinema screened Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Strangers on a Train&quot; (1951), having already seen and enjoyed the film, she advised two patrons arriving during the last five minutes of a showing to wait until the beginning of the next showing to avoid spoiling the ending for them, but the couple insisted on being seated. The manager observed Burnett not letting the couple in and fired her, stripping the epaulettes from her uniform on the spot. Years later in the 1970s after achieving TV stardom, when the Hollywood Chamber of Commerce offered her a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, they asked her where she wanted it. She replied &quot;Right in front of where the old Warner Brothers Theater was, at Hollywood and Wilcox&quot;, which is where it was placed, at 6439 Hollywood Blvd.

After graduating from Hollywood High School in 1951, Burnett received an anonymous envelope containing $50 for one year&#x27;s tuition at UCLA, where she initially planned on studying journalism. During her first year of college, she switched her focus to theater arts and English, with the goal of becoming a playwright. She found she had to take an acting course to enter the playwright program. On the subject, she later reflected: &quot;I wasn&#x27;t really ready to do the acting thing, but I had no choice.&quot; During her first performance, she got a sudden impulse to speak her lines in a new way. &quot;Don&#x27;t ask me why, but when we were in front of the audience, I suddenly decided I was going to stretch out all my words and my first line came out &#x27;I&#x27;m baaaaaaaack!&#x27;&quot; The audience response moved her deeply:

During this time, she performed in several university productions, garnering recognition for her comedic and musical abilities. Her mother disapproved of her acting ambitions:

The young Burnett, always insecure about her looks, responded many years later to her mother&#x27;s advice of &quot;You can always write, no matter what you look like&quot; by noting &quot;God, that hurt!&quot; in her memoir &quot;One More Time&quot; (1986).

During her junior year at UCLA in 1954, a professor invited Burnett and some other students to perform at a party in place of their class final that had been canceled (which required a performance in front of an audience). Afterwards, a man and his wife approached her while Burnett was stuffing cookies in her purse to take home to her grandmother. Instead of reprimanding her, the man complimented her performance and asked about her future plans. When he learned that she wanted to travel to New York in order to try her luck in musical comedy but could not afford the trip, he offered her and her boyfriend (Don Saroyan) each, on the spot, a $1,000 () interest-free loan; the man, who was a millionaire from La Jolla, California, wasn&#x27;t affiliated with show business and had earned his wealth from the shipbuilding industry. His conditions were simply that the loans were to be repaid within five years, his name was never to be revealed, and if she achieved success, she would help other aspiring talents to pursue their artistic dreams. Burnett took him up on his offer, and she and Saroyan left college and moved to New York to pursue acting careers. That same year, her father died of causes related to his alcoholism.

==Career==
===1955–1966: Rise to prominence ===
Burnett spent her first year in New York working as a hat-check girl and trying to land acting jobs. She and other girls living at the Rehearsal Club (a boarding house for women seriously pursuing acting careers) put on &quot;The Rehearsal Club Revue&quot; on March 3, 1955. They mailed invitations to agents, who showed up along with stars like Celeste Holm and Marlene Dietrich. Such attendance opened doors for several of the girls.

Burnett was cast in a minor role on &quot;The Paul Winchell and Jerry Mahoney Show&quot; in 1955. She played the girlfriend of a ventriloquist&#x27;s dummy on the popular children&#x27;s program. This role led to her starring role opposite Buddy Hackett in the short-lived sitcom &quot;Stanley&quot; from 1956 to 1957.

After &quot;Stanley&quot;, Burnett found herself unemployed for a short time. A few months later she bounced back, becoming highly popular as a performer on the New York circuit of cabarets and night clubs, most notably for a hit parody number called &quot;I Made a Fool of Myself Over John Foster Dulles&quot; (Dulles was Secretary of State at the time). In 1957, she performed this number on both &quot;The Tonight Show&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;. Dulles was asked about her on &quot;Meet the Press&quot; and joked, &quot;I never discuss matters of the heart in public.&quot;
Around this time she also worked as a regular on one of television&#x27;s earliest game shows, &quot;Pantomime Quiz&quot;. On January 10, 1958, just as she was achieving her first small successes, her mother died. In October 1960, Burnett debuted at New York City&#x27;s Blue Angel Supper Club, where she was discovered by scouts for &quot;The Jack Paar Show&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

Burnett&#x27;s first true taste of success came with her appearance on Broadway in the 1959 musical &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award; in the same year, she paid back her mysterious benefactor &quot;to the day&quot; after agreeing to her non-obligatory unsecured loan of $1,000. The same year, she became a regular player on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, a job that lasted until 1962. She won an Emmy Award that year for her &quot;Outstanding Performance in a Variety or Musical Program or Series&quot; on the show. She portrayed a number of characters, most memorably the put-upon cleaning woman. The character later became her signature alter-ego. With her success on the &quot;Moore Show&quot;, Burnett finally rose to headliner status and appeared in the special &quot;Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall&quot; (1962), co-starring with her friend Julie Andrews. The show was produced by Bob Banner, directed by Joe Hamilton and written by Mike Nichols and Ken Welch. &quot;Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall&quot; won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Program Achievement in the Field of Music, and Burnett won an Emmy for her performance. She also guest-starred on a number of shows during this time, including &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;Cavender Is Coming&quot;. In July 1963 Burnett starred as Calamity Jane in the Dallas State Fair Musicals production of &quot;Calamity Jane&quot; and had her television special debut in 1963 when CBS aired that production on November 12, 1963.

In 1964, Burnett starred in the Broadway musical &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; but was forced to withdraw after sustaining a neck injury in a taxi accident. She returned to the show later but withdrew again to participate in a variety show, &quot;The Entertainers&quot;, opposite Caterina Valente and Bob Newhart. The producers of &quot;Fade Out – Fade In&quot; sued the actress for breach of contract after her absences from the popular show caused its failure, but the suit was later dropped. &quot;The Entertainers&quot; ran for only one season. Around the same time, Burnett became good friends with Jim Nabors, who was enjoying great success with his series &quot;Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.&quot; As a result of their close friendship, she played a recurring role on Nabors&#x27; show as a tough corporal and later as a gunnery sergeant (starting with the episode &quot;Corporal Carol&quot;). Later, Nabors would be the first guest on her variety show each season, as she considered him to be her good-luck charm.

In 1959, Lucille Ball became a friend and mentor to Burnett. After having guested on Burnett&#x27;s highly successful CBS-TV special &quot;Carol + 2&quot; (1966) and having the younger performer reciprocate by appearing on &quot;The Lucy Show&quot; (1966–1967), it was rumored that Ball offered Burnett a chance to star on her own sitcom. In truth, Burnett was offered (but declined) &quot;Here&#x27;s Agnes&quot; by CBS executives. The two women remained close friends until Ball&#x27;s death in 1989. Ball sent flowers every year on Burnett&#x27;s birthday. When Burnett awoke on the day of her 56th birthday in 1989, she discovered via the morning news that Ball had died. Later that afternoon, flowers arrived at Burnett&#x27;s house with a note reading, &quot;Happy Birthday, Kid. Love, Lucy.&quot;

In 1963 she made her feature film debut in comedy &quot;Who&#x27;s Been Sleeping in My Bed?&quot; starring opposite Dean Martin and Elizabeth Montgomery. Burnett said of her role in the film, &quot;I should have been given the award for “Worst Performance Ever Given in Movies by an Actress.” I was confused, bored and I missed the [live] audience. Nothing was spontaneous.&quot; During this time she acted in the CBS variety show &quot;The Entertainers&quot; alongside Bob Newhart and in an episode of the Mel Brooks and Buck Henry created spy comedy series &quot;Get Smart&quot; in 1966.

===1967–1978: &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;===


In 1967, after CBS offered Burnett &quot;Here&#x27;s Agnes&quot;, she exercised a stipulation in her ten-year contract with CBS that said she had five years from the date &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; ended to &quot;push the button&quot; on hosting thirty one-hour episodes of a music/comedy variety show. As a result, the hour-long &quot;Carol Burnett Show&quot; was born and debuted in September 1967, eventually garnering 23 Emmy Awards and winning or being nominated for multiple Emmy and Golden Globe Awards every season it was on the air. Its ensemble cast included Tim Conway (who was a guest player until the ninth season), Harvey Korman, Lyle Waggoner and the teenaged Vicki Lawrence, whom Burnett discovered and mentored. The network initially did not want her to do a variety show because it believed only men could be successful at variety, but her contract required that it give her one season of whatever kind of show she wanted to make. She chose to carry on the tradition of past variety show successes. During this time Burnett was the first celebrity to appear on the children&#x27;s series &quot;Sesame Street&quot;, appearing on that series&#x27; first episode on November 10, 1969. She also made occasional returns to the stage in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1974, she appeared at the Muny Theatre in St. Louis, Missouri, in &quot;I Do! I Do!&quot; with Rock Hudson.
A true variety show, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; struck a chord with viewers. Among other subjects, it parodied films (&quot;Went with the Wind!&quot; for &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;), television (&quot;As the Stomach Turns&quot; for the soap opera &quot;As the World Turns&quot;) and commercials. There were also frequent musical numbers. Burnett and her team struck gold with the original sketch &quot;The Family&quot;, which eventually was spun off into the television show &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, starring Vicki Lawrence. She opened most shows with an impromptu question-and-answer session with the audience, lasting a few minutes, during which she often demonstrated her ability to humorously ad lib. On numerous occasions, she obliged when asked to perform her trademark Tarzan yell. She ended each show by tugging on her left ear, which was a message to her grandmother. This was done to let her know that she was doing well and that she loved her. During the show&#x27;s run, her grandmother died. On an &quot;Intimate Portrait&quot; episode about Burnett, she tearfully recalled her grandmother&#x27;s last moments: &quot;She said to my husband Joe from her hospital bed &#x27;Joe, you see that spider up there?&#x27; There was no spider, but Joe said he did anyhow. She said &#x27;Every few minutes a big spider jumps on that little spider and they go at it like rabbits!!&#x27; And then she died. There&#x27;s laughter in everything!&quot; 

She continued the tradition of tugging her ear. The show ceased production in 1978. Four post-script episodes were produced and aired on ABC during the summer of 1979 under the title &quot;Carol Burnett &amp; Company&quot;. The productions used essentially the same format and, with the exception of Harvey Korman and Lyle Waggoner, the same supporting cast. Beginning in 1977, the comedy sketches of her series were edited into half-hour episodes for syndication entitled &quot;Carol Burnett and Friends&quot;, which for many years proved to be extremely popular in syndication. In the digital age, the series began airing on MeTV in January 2015. Burnett starred in a few films while her variety show was running, including &quot;Pete &#x27;n&#x27; Tillie&quot; (1972) and &quot;The Front Page&quot; (1974). She was nominated for an Emmy in 1974 for her role in the drama &quot;6 Rms Riv Vu&quot;. The show&#x27;s enduring popularity surprised many when a 2001 retrospective containing outtakes and discussions with the cast, and a tribute to Bob Mackie, drew in 30 million viewers, topping the Emmy Awards as well as all but the final game of that year&#x27;s World Series. Her Grammy-winning memoir &quot;In Such Good Company&quot; is about the show, and Burnett tells about how it was developed, with anecdotes about improvisations, the cast, crew, and guests.

=== 1979–1999: Film roles and return to Broadway ===

After her show ended, she assumed a number of roles that departed from comedy. She appeared in several dramatic roles, most notably in the television movie &quot;Friendly Fire&quot;. She appeared as Beatrice O&#x27;Reilly in the film &quot;Life of The Party: The Story of Beatrice&quot;, a story about a woman fighting her alcoholism. Her other film work includes Robert Altman&#x27;s comedy-drama &quot;A Wedding&quot; (1978), Alan Alda&#x27;s romantic comedy &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; (1981), John Huston&#x27;s musical film &quot;Annie&quot; (1982), and Peter Bogdanovich&#x27;s comedy &quot;Noises Off&quot; (1992). She took the supporting role of Carlotta Campion in the 1985 concert performance of Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Follies&quot;. In 1995, after an absence of 30 years, she was back on Broadway in &quot;Moon Over Buffalo&quot;, for which she was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play. Four years later, she appeared in the Broadway revue &quot;Putting It Together&quot;.

In the 1980s and 1990s, she made several attempts at starting a new variety program. She also appeared briefly on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&#x27;s&quot; &quot;The Family&quot; sketches&#x27; spinoff, &quot;Mama&#x27;s Family&quot;, as her stormy character, Eunice Higgins. She played the matriarch in the cult comedy miniseries &quot;Fresno&quot;, which parodied the primetime soap opera &quot;Falcon Crest&quot;. In 1987 she starred in a variety sketch special, &quot;Carol, Carl, Whoopi and Robin&quot; alongside Carl Reiner, Whoopi Goldberg, and Robin Williams. That same year she starred in the TV movie &quot;Plaza Suite&quot; with Dabney Coleman and Hal Holbrook. She reunited with Julie Andrews in the ABC special &quot;Julie &amp; Carol: Together Again&quot; which they performed at the Pantages Theatre in Hollywood. She returned to television with the comedy series &quot;Carol &amp; Company&quot; from 1990 to 1991. She guest starred as herself in &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; in 1992 and in the sitcom &quot;Mad About You&quot;, playing Theresa Stemple, the mother of main character Jamie Buchman (Helen Hunt), for which she won the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Comedy Series.

She made frequent appearances as a panelist on the game show &quot;Password&quot;, an association she maintained until the early 1980s (Mark Goodson awarded her his Silver Password All-Stars Award for best celebrity player; she&#x27;s also credited with coming up with the title &quot;Password Plus&quot;, when it was originally titled &quot;Password &#x27;79&quot;). Burnett had long been a fan of the soap opera &quot;All My Children&quot; and realized a dream when Agnes Nixon created the role of Verla Grubbs for her in 1983. Burnett played the long-lost daughter of Langley Wallingford (Louis Edmonds), causing trouble for her stepmother Phoebe Tyler-Wallingford (Ruth Warrick). She made occasional appearances on the soap opera in each decade thereafter. She hosted a 25th-anniversary special about the show in 1995 and made a brief cameo appearance as Verla Grubbs on the January 5, 2005, episode which celebrated the show&#x27;s 35th anniversary. She reprised her role as Grubbs in September 2011 as part of the series&#x27; finale. She also starred in television films such as &quot;Seasons of the Heart&quot; (1994).

=== 2000–present: Pause and return to acting ===
Burnett&#x27;s first voice role was in &quot;The Trumpet of the Swan&quot; in 2001. In 2008, she had her second role as an animated character in the film &quot;Horton Hears a Who!&quot; In 2012, she had another voice role as the character Hara in the US Disney-dubbed version of &quot;The Secret World of Arrietty&quot;. In 2019, she voiced a talking chair, named Chairol Burnett, in &quot;Toy Story 4&quot;.
Burnett similarly returned to film in 2005 to star in a different role as Queen Aggravain in the movie version of &quot;Once Upon a Mattress&quot;. She guest-starred in season two episodes of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot; as Bree&#x27;s stepmother, Elanor Mason. In 2009, she made a guest appearance on the &quot;Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit&quot;, for which she was nominated for the Emmy Award for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series. In November 2010, she guest-starred on an episode of &quot;Glee&quot; as the mother of cheerleading coach Sue Sylvester. In 2014, Burnett joined two-time Tony Award Winner, Brian Dennehy, on Broadway in A. R. Gurney&#x27;s &quot;Love Letters&quot;. She appeared on the reboot of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; as Steve McGarrett&#x27;s Aunt Debbie. Her appearances, traditionally on Thanksgiving-themed episodes, were featured from 2013 until the character died of cancer in the January 15, 2016, episode.
Burnett has mostly stayed away from the spotlight, yet she still earns honorary awards for her groundbreaking work in comedy. For instance in 2013, she received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor at the Kennedy Center. Those who were there to honor Burnett included her longtime friends and collaborators Julie Andrews, Vicki Lawrence and Tim Conway, as well as Tina Fey, Amy Poehler, Maya Rudolph, Rashida Jones and Martin Short. In 2017, CBS aired &quot;The Carol Burnett Show: 50th Anniversary Special&quot;. The event featured Burnett, original cast members Vicki Lawrence and Lyle Waggoner, costume designer Bob Mackie and special guests Jim Carrey, Kristin Chenoweth, Stephen Colbert, Harry Connick Jr., Bill Hader, Jay Leno, Jane Lynch, Bernadette Peters, Maya Rudolph and Martin Short. Burnett spoke about the adversity she endured, saying &quot;They said it was a man&#x27;s game—Sid Caesar, Dean Martin, Milton Berle—because it hadn&#x27;t been done. But that doesn&#x27;t mean it couldn&#x27;t be done.&quot;

In 2019, the Golden Globes created an award in Burnett&#x27;s name, the Carol Burnett Award, for career achievement in television. Burnett was also announced as the first recipient of the award. The Hollywood Foreign Press said in a statement, &quot;For more than 50 years, comedy trailblazer Carol Burnett has been breaking barriers while making us laugh&quot;. Steve Carell presented the award to Burnett. In June 2022, Burnett guest starred in the second half of the sixth and final season of American drama series &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, a spin-off, prequel, and sequel to &quot;Breaking Bad&quot;. Burnett was announced to be portraying a character named &quot;Marion&quot; on June 27, 2022, by AMC. Of how she got the role Burnett stated, &quot;I was a big fan of &quot;Breaking Bad&quot; and I knew Vince Gilligan...When they started &quot;Better Call Saul&quot;, I got hooked on that and he said, &#x27;you know, maybe I&#x27;ll write something for you for Saul.&#x27; I said, I don&#x27;t care if it&#x27;s one sentence. I&#x27;ll be there. Because I just love their writing. I spent two and a half months in New Mexico doing that and it was just a delight.&quot; Upon Burnett missing out on an Emmy nomination for her role, Daniel Feinberg of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Burnett, lamenting the outcome and describing her performance &quot;as a subtle symphony of world-weary nuance, a characterization that simultaneously matches the spirit-draining black-and-white texture of the series&#x27; Omaha interludes and ties in perfectly with one of the most colorful chapters in the life of Bob Odenkirk&#x27;s Jimmy McGill/Saul Goodman.&quot;

On April 26, 2023, Burnett was honored for her music, film, television, and theater roles by her friends and fellow actors and singers on her 90th birthday in the NBC special &quot;Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love&quot;, which was filmed at the Avalon Hollywood Theatre Numerous stars came out to pay tribute to Burnett including Julie Andrews, Cher, Ellen DeGeneres, Lily Tomlin, Amy Poehler, and Kristin Wiig. The special won the Emmy for Outstanding Variety Special (pre-recorded) at the 75th Creative Emmy Arts Emmy Awards. As an executive producer of the special, Burnett accepted the Emmy on behalf of the special&#x27;s team. Burnett also presented the Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Comedy Series to Quinta Brunson for &quot;Abbott Elementary&quot; at the 75th Primetime Emmy Awards. Upon accepting the Emmy from Burnett, Brunson started to choke up saying, &quot;I don’t even know why I’m so emotional. I think, like, the Carol Burnett of it all&quot;.

In March 2024, Burnett co-starred alongside Kristen Wiig, Allison Janney, and Laura Dern in the Apple TV+ comedy series &quot;Palm Royale&quot;. Her performance earned praise from critics, with Tom Gliatto of &quot;People&quot; highlighting Burnett as the series&#x27; &quot;strongest performance&quot;, adding: &quot;Burnett plays Norma with an unforgiving toughness — even when she’s comatose — and, by some miracle, she projects the slapstick kick of her old CBS comedy show.&quot; Judy Berman of &quot;Time&quot; wrote &quot;the legendary Carol Burnett [plays] the funniest convalescent you&#x27;ll ever meet.&quot; Burnett said that while &quot;Palm Royale&quot; was &quot;probably&quot; her last acting appearance, she was pursuing other projects as a writer, producer, or presenter.

== Acting credits and accolades ==
Burnett has received 23 Primetime Emmy Award nominations with 6 wins for her work in &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;, &quot;Julie and Carol at Carnegie Hall&quot;, &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot; and &quot;Mad About You&quot;, and &quot;Palm Royale.&quot; In 2024 at age 91, she became the oldest nominee for a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series, for her work in &quot;Palm Royale&quot;.

She also received 18 Golden Globe Award nominations, winning 7 Awards, for her work on &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;. She also received 3 Tony Awards and 3 Grammy Awards nominations, winning one of each.

Burnett also received various honors including 2 Peabody Awards, a Screen Actors Guild Life Achievement Award and a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2003, she was honored with the Kennedy Center Honor. In 2005, she received the Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded to her by President George W. Bush. In 2013, she received the Mark Twain Prize for American Humor. In 2019 she became the first recipient of the Carol Burnett Lifetime Achievement Award for Television, which was named in her honor.

On her 90th birthday she was honored with an NBC variety special entitled, &quot;Carol Burnett: 90 Years of Laughter + Love&quot; where various collaborators and performers paid tribute to her. This included Julie Andrews, Vicki Lawrence, Lily Tomlin, Steve Carell, Amy Poehler, Ellen DeGeneres, Bob Odenkirk, and Cher among many others.

==Personal life==
=== Marriages and family ===
Burnett married her college sweetheart Don Saroyan on December 15, 1955. They divorced in 1962.

On May 4, 1963, Burnett married television producer Joe Hamilton, a divorced father of eight and brother of actress Kipp Hamilton who had produced her 1962 Carnegie Hall concert. He later produced &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, among other projects. The couple had three daughters:
* Carrie Hamilton (December 5, 1963 – January 20, 2002), who died at the age of 38 from pneumonia as a complication of lung and brain cancer. She was a writer and an actress.
* Jody Hamilton (born January 18, 1967), a film producer and, as of 2023, the executive producer of &quot;The Stephanie Miller Show&quot; and an occasional actress.
* Erin Hamilton (born August 14, 1968), a singer.

In early 1965 she had a miscarriage while in her ninth week of pregnancy.

Their marriage ended in divorce in 1984. The challenge of coping with Carrie&#x27;s drug problems was mentioned as part of the reason for the separation, but the couple took the opportunity to inform other parents about handling such problems and raised money for the clinic in which Carrie was treated. In 1988, Burnett and Carrie took a trip to Moscow to help introduce the first Alcoholics Anonymous branch in the Soviet Union. Joe Hamilton died of cancer in 1991. Also in the 1980s, Burnett participated in a publicity campaign for MedicAlert, of which she is symbolically the
one millionth member with the one millionth bracelet.

On November 24, 2001, Burnett married drummer Brian Miller who is 23 years her junior.

Burnett has enjoyed close friendships with Lucille Ball, Beverly Sills, Jim Nabors (who became the godfather to her daughter Jody), Julie Andrews and Betty White. She is the acting mentor to Vicki Lawrence. They share a close friendship, as noted by Lawrence in a testimonial speech during her appearance at Burnett&#x27;s 2013 Mark Twain Award in Washington, D.C. (recorded and broadcast on PBS Television).

In August 2020, Burnett and her husband petitioned to receive guardianship of Burnett&#x27;s teenage grandson. Burnett is already &quot;educational rights holder&quot;, meaning that she is the one who makes decisions about her grandson Dylan&#x27;s schooling. Burnett and Miller subsequently held temporary guardianship of the child from September 2020 to November 2021, at which point Dylan&#x27;s case worker assumed the role.

=== Philanthropy ===
In keeping with her promise to the anonymous benefactor who assisted her in 1954, she has contributed to scholarship programs at UCLA and the University of Hawaii to help people in financial need.

 Memoirs 

Burnett and her oldest daughter, Carrie Hamilton, co-wrote &quot;Hollywood Arms&quot; (2002), a play based on Burnett&#x27;s bestselling memoir, &quot;One More Time&quot; (1986). The show was developed at the 1998 Sundance Theatre Lab and The Goodman Theatre before arriving on Broadway, directed by Harold Prince. Sara Niemietz and Donna Lynne Champlin shared the role of Helen (the character based on Burnett), while Michele Pawk played Louise, Helen&#x27;s mother, and Linda Lavin played Helen&#x27;s grandmother. For her performance, Pawk received the 2003 Tony Award for Best Performance by a Featured Actress in a Play. The show received a staging at New York&#x27;s Merkin Concert Hall in 2015.

Burnett has written and recorded three memoirs, each voice recording receiving a nomination for Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album. &quot;In Such Good Company&quot; won the Grammy for Best Spoken Word at the 59th Grammy Awards.

==Litigation==
Burnett v. National Enquirer, Inc.
In 1976, a false report in the tabloid newspaper &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; incorrectly implied that Burnett had been drunk and boisterous in public at a restaurant with U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to her. Through years of persistent litigation, she won a judgment against the &quot;Enquirer&quot; in 1981. Though the initial jury award of $1.6 million was reduced to $200,000 after a series of appeals, and the final settlement was out of court, the event was widely viewed as a historic victory for libel victims of tabloid journalism.

Carol Burnett and Whacko, Inc. vs. Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation

In 2007, Burnett and Whacko, Inc. brought a suit against 20th Century Fox demanding at least $2 million in damages after an animated likeness of Burnett appeared in the 2006 episode &quot;Peterotica&quot; of the animated sitcom &quot;Family Guy&quot;. In the episode, the characters discuss the cleanliness of a porn shop, Glenn Quagmire stating that it is so clean because Burnett works there as a janitor. Burnett is then shown as her well-known charwoman character, mopping the floor in the porn shop, while a modified version of &quot;Carol&#x27;s Theme&quot;, the theme song used in &quot;The Carol Burnett Show&quot;, plays. The characters subsequently discuss Burnett&#x27;s ear tug and make a crude comment about it. The lawsuit alleged copyright infringement, violation of publicity rights and misappropriation of Burnett&#x27;s name and likeness. In addition to damages, Burnett and her company demanded that Fox remove all references to her, the theme and the character. The studio refused. The court ruled in favor of the defendant because the bit was a parody, which is protected by the First Amendment, particularly by Fair Use doctrine.

<text>Rottweil is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. It is part of the Schwarzwald-Baar-Heuberg region in the Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald regional district. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Freudenstadt, Zollernalbkreis, Tuttlingen, Schwarzwald-Baar and Ortenaukreis.

== History ==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Rottweil&quot;, which was created in 1806/08 when the previously free imperial city Rottweil became part of Württemberg. In 1934 it was renamed to &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district). 1938 the two neighboring districts Sulz and Oberndorf were dissolved, and most of the district Oberndorf and a small part of Sulz was added to the district Rottweil. During World War II, a series of Nazi concentration camps, collectively known as KZ Schörzingen-Rottweil-Zepfenhan, were located in the area. In 1973 in another communal reform several municipalities from the districts Horb, Wolfach, Hechingen and Villingendorf were added.

== Geography ==
The district covers part of the mountains of the Black Forest and the Swabian Alb. The Neckar River bisects the district from south to north as it flows towards the Rhine River.

== Economy ==
Today, the economy of Rottweil is predominantly medium-sized. The town of Rottweil, the oldest town in Baden-Württemberg, used to be a flourishing imperial city during the Middle Ages.

The annual average unemployment rate in Rottweil was 3.4 Percent in 2019.

== Coat of arms ==
The imperial eagle in the coat of arms derives from the coat of arms of the free imperial city Rottweil. Below the eagle is a deer antler, the symbol of Württemberg, as part of the district belonged to the kingdom Württemberg well before Rottweil itself became part of it. The shield on the breast of the eagle show the colors of Austria, symbolizing the area around the city of Oberndorf which was acquired by Austria in 1381.

<text>A strange star, also called a strange quark star, is a hypothetical compact astronomical object, a quark star made of strange quark matter.

Strange stars might exist without regard to the Bodmer–Witten assumption of stability at near-zero temperatures and pressures, as strange quark matter might form and remain stable at the core of neutron stars, in the same way as ordinary quark matter could. Such strange stars will naturally have a crust layer of neutron matter. The depth of the crust layer will depend on the physical conditions and circumstances of the entire star and on the properties of strange quark matter in general. Stars partially made up of quark matter (including strange quark matter) are also referred to as &quot;hybrid stars&quot;.

The collapse of the crust layer of strange stars is one of the proposed causes of fast radio bursts.

==Theoretical description==

Neutron stars are formed when the collapse of a star occurs with such intense force that gravity forces subatomic particles such as protons and electrons to merge into neutrally charged neutron particles, releasing a shower of neutrinos. If the resultant neutral core is able to maintain form and not collapse into a black hole, the result is an incredibly dense celestial body composed entirely of neutral uncharged particles.

Protons and neutrons are composed of three quarks: a proton by two up quarks and one down quark, a neutron by two down quarks and one up quark. It is hypothesized that within neutron stars, the conditions are so extreme that a process known as deconfinement occurs: where subatomic particles dissolve and leave their constituent quarks behind as free particles. The temperature and pressure would then force these quarks to be squeezed together to such an extent that they would form a hypothetical phase of matter known as quark matter. If this occurs, the neutron star becomes a &quot;quark star&quot;. If the pressure is great enough, the quarks could be affected even further and transform into strange quarks, which would then interact with the other &quot;non-strange&quot; quarks to form strange matter. If this occurs, the quark star would then become a strange star.

==Characteristics==
Early work on strange quark matter suggested that it would be a homogeneous liquid, but other models propose a heterogeneous alternative with positively charged &quot;strange quark nuggets&quot; embedded in a negatively charged electron gas. This structure decreases the stars&#x27; external electric field and density variation from previous theoretical expectations, with the result that such stars appear nearly indistinguishable from ordinary neutron stars. 

Other theoretical work contends that:
Addressing key parameters like surface tension and electrical forces that were neglected in the original study, the results show that as long as the surface tension is below a low critical value, the large strangelets are indeed unstable to fragmentation and strange stars naturally come with complex strangelet crusts, analogous to those of neutron stars.

==Crust collapse==
For a strange star&#x27;s crust to collapse, it must accrete matter from its environment in some form.

The release of even small amounts of its matter causes a cascading effect on the star&#x27;s crust. This is thought to result in a massive release of magnetic energy as well as electron-positron pairs in the initial phases of the collapsing stage. This release of high-energy particles and magnetic energy in such a short period of time causes the newly released electron-positron pairs to be directed towards the poles of the strange star due to the increased magnetic energy created by the initial secretion of the strange star&#x27;s matter. Once these electron-positron pairs are directed to the star&#x27;s poles, they are then ejected at relativistic velocities, which is proposed to be one of the causes of fast radio bursts.

==Primordial strange stars==
Theoretical investigations have revealed that quark stars might not only be produced from neutron stars and powerful supernovae, they could also be created in the early cosmic phase separations following the Big Bang.

If these primordial quark stars can transform into strange quark matter before the external temperature and pressure conditions of the early universe renders them unstable, they might become stable, if the Bodmer–Witten assumption holds true. Such primordial strange stars could survive to this day.

==Observability==
Strange dwarfs, unlike neutron stars with strange cores, are postulated to be different from white dwarfs. A database of white dwarfs has been analyzed. Knowledge of the mass and surface gravity of a star allows calculation of its radius. A team that compared 40,000 white dwarfs to the mass–radius relation for white dwarfs discovered that most of them followed that relation. Eight exceptions were much smaller in size and matched predictions for a strange dwarf.

<doc id="249686" wikidata="Q94111" url="?curid=249686" title="New Chronology (Rohl)">
<text>The New Chronology is an alternative chronology of the ancient Near East developed by English Egyptologist David Rohl and other researchers beginning with &quot;A Test of Time: The Bible - from Myth to History&quot; in 1995. It contradicts mainstream Egyptology by proposing a major revision of the established Egyptian chronology, in particular by re-dating Egyptian kings of the Nineteenth through Twenty-fifth Dynasties, bringing forward conventional dating by up to 350 years. Rohl asserts that the New Chronology allows him to identify some of the characters in the Hebrew Bible with people whose names appear in archaeological finds.

The New Chronology, one of several proposed radical revisions of the conventional chronology, has not been accepted in academic Egyptology, where the conventional chronology or small variations of it remains standard. Amélie Kuhrt, head of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College London, in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, notes, 
Rohl&#x27;s most vocal critic has been Kenneth Kitchen, one of the leading experts on biblical history and the author of the standard work on the conventional chronology of the Third Intermediate Period of Egypt, the period most directly affected by the New Chronology&#x27;s redating of the Nineteenth to Twenty-fifth Dynasties.

== Rohl&#x27;s New Chronology ==
David Rohl&#x27;s published works &quot;A Test of Time&quot; (1995), &quot;Legend&quot; (1998), &quot;The Lost Testament&quot; (2002), and &quot;The Lords of Avaris&quot; (2007) set forth Rohl&#x27;s theories for re-dating the major civilisations of the ancient world. &quot;A Test of Time&quot; proposes a down-dating (bringing closer to the present), by several centuries, of the New Kingdom of Egypt, thus needing a major revision of the conventional chronology of ancient Egypt. Rohl asserts that this would let scholars identify some of the major events in the Hebrew Bible with events in the archaeological record and identify some of the well-known biblical characters with historical figures who appear in contemporary ancient texts. Lowering the Egyptian dates also dramatically affects the dating of dependent chronologies, such as that currently used for the Greek Heroic Age of the Late Bronze Age, removing the Greek Dark Ages, and lowering the dates of the Trojan War to within two generations of a ninth-century-BC Homer and his most famous composition, the &quot;Iliad&quot;.

The New Chronology lowers the Egyptian dates (established within the traditional chronology) by up to 350 years at points before the universally accepted fixed date of 664 BC for the sacking of Thebes by Ashurbanipal. For example, the New Chronology would redate the beginning of Egypt&#x27;s 19th Dynasty from 1295 BC to 961 BC.

Before the 1995 publication of &quot;A Test of Time&quot;, Thomas L. Thompson, a theologian associated with Biblical Minimalism, had insisted that any attempt to write history based on a direct integration of biblical and extra-biblical sources was &quot;not only dubious but wholly ludicrous&quot;. Rohl explained his view on the issue in &quot;The Lost Testament&quot; (2007): &quot;Is the Old Testament history or myth? The only way to answer that question is to investigate the biblical stories using the archaeological evidence, combined with a study of the ancient texts of the civilisations which had a role to play in the Bible story. But this has to be done with an open mind. In my view the biblical text – just like any other ancient document – should be treated as a potentially reliable historical source until it can be demonstrated to be otherwise.&quot; Rohl had previously remarked in &quot;A Test of Time&quot; (1995) that he &quot;did not originally set out to challenge our current understanding of the Old Testament narratives. This has come about simply because of the need to explore the ramifications of my TIP [Egyptian Third Intermediate Period] research. I have no religious axe to grind – I am simply an historian in search of some historical truth.&quot;

Rohl&#x27;s redating is based on criticism of three of the four arguments which he considers are the original foundations of the conventional chronology for the Egyptian New Kingdom:
* He asserts that the identification of &quot;Shishaq [Shishak], King of Egypt&quot; (1 Kings 14:25f; 2 Chronicles 12:2-9) with Shoshenq I, first proposed by Jean-François Champollion, is based on incorrect conclusions. Rohl argues instead that Shishaq should be identified with Ramesses II (probably pronounced Riamashisha), which would move the date of Ramesses&#x27; reign forward some 300 years.
* Rohl also asserts that the record in the Ebers Papyrus of the rising of Sirius in the ninth regnal year of Amenhotep I, which is used in conventional chronology to fix that year to either 1542 BC or 1517 BC, has been misread, and instead should be understood as evidence for a reform in the Egyptian calendar.
* Papyrus Leiden I.350, which dates to the 52nd year of Ramesses II, records a lunar observation which places that year of Ramesses&#x27;s reign in one of 1278, 1253, 1228 or 1203 BC within the date-range of the conventional chronology. Having questioned the value of the Ebers Papyrus, Rohl argues that, since the lunar cycle repeats itself every 25 years, it is only useful for fine tuning a chronology and could equally apply to dates 300 years later as in the New Chronology.

Thus, Rohl is of the opinion that none of these three foundations of the conventional Egyptian chronology are secure, and that the sacking of Thebes by the Assyrian king Ashurbanipal in 664 BC is the earliest fixed date in Egyptian history.

===Evidence adduced===
Rohl bases his revised chronology (the New Chronology) on his interpretation of numerous archeological finds and genealogical records from Egypt. For example:

* Rohl notes that no Apis bull burials are recorded in the Lesser Vaults of the Serapeum of Saqqara for the Twenty-first and early Twenty-second Dynasties. He also argues that the reburial sequence of the mummies of the New Kingdom pharaohs in the Royal Cache (TT 320) shows that these two dynasties were contemporary (thus explaining why there are too few Apis burials for the period). Rohl finds that in the royal burial ground at Tanis it appears that the tomb of Osorkon II of the 22nd Dynasty was built before that of Psusennes I of the 21st Dynasty; in Rohl&#x27;s view this can only be explained if the two dynasties were contemporary.
* Rohl offers inscriptions that list three non-royal genealogies which, when one attributes 20 to 23 years to a generation, show, according to Rohl, that Ramesses II flourished in the 10th century BC as Rohl advocates. In the conventional chronology, all three genealogies would be missing seven generations. He also argues that there are no genealogies that confirm the conventional dates for Ramesses II in the 13th century BC.
* One of Rohl&#x27;s methods is the use of archaeoastronomy, which he employs to fix the date of a near-sunset solar eclipse during the reign of Akhenaten and observed from the city of Ugarit. Based on calculations, using computer astronomy programs, Rohl asserts that the only time when this eclipse could have occurred during the whole second millennium BC was on 9 May 1012 BC. This is approximately 350 years later than the conventional dates for Akhenaten (1353-1334 BC).
* Rohl&#x27;s dates for Amenemhat III of the Twelfth Dynasty in the 17th century BC have found support in the work of astronomer David Lappin, whose research finds matches for a sequence of 37 out of 39 lunar month lengths recorded in 12th Dynasty contracts; the conventional chronology matches at best 21. According to Lappin, this pattern provides &quot;startling&quot; support for Rohl&#x27;s chronology.

===Shishaq===
Most Egyptologists accept Shishaq as an alternative name for Shoshenq I. Rohl disputes that Shoshenq&#x27;s military activity fits the biblical account of Shishaq on the grounds that the two kings&#x27; campaigns are completely different and Jerusalem does not appear in the Shoshenq inscription as a subjected town. He also points out that Ramesses did campaign against Israel and that he had a short form of his formal name which was in use in Palestine. That name was Sysw, whilst the early Hebrew alphabet did not distinguish between S and SH, so the biblical name may have originally been Sysq. Rohl has also argued that the qoph ending may be a later misreading of the early sign for waw which in the 10th century was identical to the 7th century sign for qoph. Thus 7th-century Sysq may have been a mistaken later reading of 10th-century Sysw.

The theory that Ramesses II (hypocoristicon &quot;Sysa&quot;), rather than Shoshenq I, should be identified with the biblical Shishak is not widely accepted.

Kevin Wilson agrees only partially with David Rohl. Wilson accepts that there is a mismatch between the triumphal relief of Shoshenq I and the biblical description of King Shishak. However, he does not think that this discrepancy gives sufficient reason for doubting the identification of Shoshenq I with King Shishak of the Bible. Wilson writes about Shoshenq&#x27;s inscription, &quot;Contrary to previous studies, which have interpreted the relief as a celebration of his Palestine campaign, neither the triumphal relief nor any of its elements can be utilized as a source for historical data about that campaign. … the triumphal relief can unfortunately play no role in the reconstruction of Shoshenq’s campaign.&quot;
Wilson&#x27;s view is not supported by Kenneth Kitchen who states: &quot;That the great topographical list of Shoshenq I at Karnak is a document of the greatest possible value for the history and nature of his campaign against Judah and Israel is now clearly established beyond all dispute, thanks to the labours expended on that list by a series of scholars. However, the composition and interpretation of the list still require further examination and clarification&quot;. Other leading scholars who have studied the campaign relief point out that it is indeed a unique list of subjected towns and not a copy of an earlier campaign by a more celebrated pharaoh. This originality makes it far more likely that it is a true representation of cities and locations brought under Egyptian control by the military activities of Shoshenq I.

==Implications of the New Chronology==

The implications of a radical down-dating of the conventional Egyptian chronology, such as that proposed by Rohl and other revisionists, are complex and wide-ranging. The New Chronology affects the historical disciplines of Old Testament studies, Levantine archaeology, Aegean and Anatolian archaeology and Classical studies, and raises major issues concerning Mesopotamian chronology and its links with Egypt and Anatolia.

===Implications for Egypt and its neighbors===

Redating the reign of Ramesses II to three centuries later than that given by the conventional chronology would reposition the date of the Battle of Kadesh and revise the linked chronology of Hittite history, and would need a revision of the chronology of Assyrian history before 911 BC. Given the dependence of Hittite chronology on Egyptian chronology, a lowering of Egyptian dates would result in a lowering of the end of the Hittite New Kingdom and a resulting reduction (or complete removal) of the Anatolian Dark Age.

During the Amarna period, a chronological synchronism between Egypt and Assyria is attested through the correspondence of Pharaoh Akhenaten and a King Ashuruballit. In the conventional chronology, this Ashuruballit is identified with Ashur-uballit I of the early Middle Assyrian Empire, but the New Chronology has proposed the addition of an otherwise unknown King Ashuruballit &quot;II&quot; during the Middle Assyrian &quot;dark age&quot; as the author of the Amarna letters. Given that the Ashuruballit I synchronism with Akhenaten has become the crucial link between Egyptian and Mesopotamian history in recent years, this issue is a key area of focus and dispute.

===Implications for the Bible===

As explained above, the New Chronology rejects the identification of Shoshenq I with the biblical Shishaq, and instead offers Ramesses II (also known by his nickname &quot;Sysa&quot;) as the real historical figure behind the Shishaq narrative.

Rohl identifies Labaya, a local ruler in Canaan whose activities are documented in the Amarna Letters, with Saul, and identifies David with Dadua (&quot;Tadua&quot;), also mentioned in Amarna Letter EA256. Saul and Labaya share the same demise - &quot;both die in battle - against a coalition of city states from the coastal plain - on or near Mount Gilboa, both as a result of betrayal.&quot; Both also have a surviving son whose name translates as &quot;Man of Baal.&quot;

The New Chronology places Solomon at the end of the wealthy Late Bronze Age rather than in the relatively impoverished Early Iron Age. Rohl and other New Chronology researchers contend that this fits better with the Hebrew Bible&#x27;s description of Solomon&#x27;s wealth.

Furthermore, Rohl shifts the Israelite Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest from the end of the Late Bronze Age to the latter part of the Middle Bronze Age (from the Nineteenth Dynasty to the Thirteenth/Hyksos period). Rohl claims that this solves many of the problems associated with the historicity issue of the biblical narratives. He makes use of the archaeological reports from Avaris, in the eastern Nile Delta, which show that a large Semitic-speaking population lived there during the Thirteenth Dynasty. These people were culturally similar to the population of Middle Bronze Age (MB IIA) Canaan. Rohl identifies these Semites as the people upon whom the biblical tradition of the Israelite Sojourn in Egypt was subsequently based.

Towards the end of the Middle Bronze Age (late MB IIB) archaeologists have revealed a series of city destructions which John Bimson and Rohl have argued correspond closely to the cities attacked by the Israelite tribes in the Joshua narrative. Most importantly, the heavily fortified city of Jericho was destroyed and abandoned at this time. On the other hand, there was no city of Jericho in existence at the end of the Late Bronze Age, drawing William Dever to conclude that &quot;Joshua destroyed a city that wasn’t even there&quot;. Rohl claims that it is this lack of archaeological evidence to confirm biblical events in the Late Bronze Age which lies behind modern scholarly skepticism over the reliability of the Hebrew Bible narratives before the Divided Monarchy period. He gives the example of Israeli professor of archaeology, Ze&#x27;ev Herzog, who caused an uproar in Israel and abroad when he gave voice to the &quot;fairly widespread&quot; view held among his colleagues that &quot;there had been no Exodus from Egypt, no invasion by Joshua and that the Israelites had developed slowly and were originally Canaanites,&quot; concluding that the Sojourn, Exodus and Conquest was “a history that never happened.” However, Rohl contends that the New Chronology, with the shift of the Exodus and Conquest events to the Middle Bronze Age, removes the principal reason for that widespread academic skepticism.

==Identifications in the New Chronology==

===Geographical identifications===

Rohl, in addition to his chronology, also has some geographical ideas that are different from the conventional notions. These include:

*The Garden of Eden (the urheimat [homeland] of the Sumerians), according to Rohl, was located in what is now northwestern Iran, between Lake Urmia and the Caspian Sea.
*The Tower of Babel, according to Rohl, was built in the ancient Sumerian capital of Eridu.
*The site of the ancient city of Sodom is &quot;a little over 100 metres beneath the surface of the Dead Sea,&quot; a few kilometers south-by-southeast from En-Gedi.
*The Amalekites defeated by King Saul were not the ones living in the Negev and/or the Sinai, but a northern branch of this people, &quot;in the territory of Ephraim, on the highlands of Amalek&quot; - or, in an alternative translation &quot;in the Land of Ephraim, the mountains of the Amalekites&quot; (Judges 12:15). This is supported by the report that, immediately following his destruction of the Amalekites, &quot;Saul went to Carmel and set up a monument&quot; (I Samuel 15:12). Once Saul is removed from the Negev and the Sinai, &quot;Saul&#x27;s kingdom as described in the Bible is precisely the area ruled over by Labaya according to the el-Amarna letters.&quot;

==Reception==

===In Egyptology===
Mainstream Egyptology has not adopted the New Chronology, continuing to employ the standard chronology in mainstream academic publications. Rohl&#x27;s most vocal critic has been Professor Kenneth Kitchen, formerly of Liverpool University, who called Rohl&#x27;s thesis &quot;100% nonsense.&quot; By contrast, other Egyptologists recognise the value of Rohl&#x27;s work in challenging the bases of the Egyptian chronological framework. Professor Erik Hornung acknowledges that &quot;...there remain many uncertainties in the Third Intermediate Period, as critics such as David Rohl have rightly maintained; even our basic premise of 925 [BC] for Shoshenq’s campaign to Jerusalem is not built on solid foundations.&quot; Academic debate on the New Chronology, however, has largely not taken place in Egyptological or archaeological journals. Most discussions are to be found in the Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences&#x27; &quot;Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum&quot; (1985–2006).

Chris Bennett (1996), while saying &quot;I am quite certain that Rohl’s views are wrong&quot; notes that besides academic debate on problems with the conventional chronology, such as those associated with the Thera eruption, a &quot;far deeper challenge ... has been mounted in the public arena.&quot; The history of this challenge to mainstream consensus outside of academic debate originates with the 1991 &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot; by Peter James, together with Rohl, co-founder of the Institute for the Study of Interdisciplinary Sciences. &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot; postulated 250 years of non-existent &quot;phantom time&quot; in the conventional chronology based on an archaeological &quot;Dark Age&quot;.

Kenneth Kitchen&#x27;s arguments against the New Chronology have focused on Rohl&#x27;s Third Intermediate Period revision which proposes an overlap between the 21st and 22nd Dynasties. In particular Kitchen challenges the validity of the chronological anomalies raised by Rohl, questioning whether they are true anomalies and offering his own explanations for the apparent problems raised by Rohl. Kitchen accuses New Chronologists of being obsessed with trying to close gaps in the archaeological record by lowering the dating.

Grouping all radical revisions of Egyptian chronology together without distinction, Erik Hornung, in his Introduction to the &quot;Handbook of Ancient Egyptian Chronology&quot;, makes the following statement:

We will always be exposed to such attempts, but they could only be taken seriously if not only the arbitrary dynasties and rulers, but also their contexts, could be displaced... In the absence of such proofs we can hardly be expected to &quot;refute&quot; such claims, or even to respond in any fashion ... It is thus neither arrogance nor ill-will that leads the academic community to neglect these efforts which frequently lead to irritation and distrust outside of professional circles (and are often undertaken with the encouragement of the media). These attempts usually require a rather lofty disrespect of the most elementary sources and facts and thus do not merit discussion. We will therefore avoid discussion of such issues in our handbook, restricting ourselves to those hypotheses and discussions which are based on the sources.

Bennett (1996), whilst not accepting Rohl&#x27;s thesis, suggests that such out-of-hand rejection may be inappropriate in Rohl&#x27;s case, since &quot;there is a world of difference between [Rohl&#x27;s] intellectual standing and that of Velikovsky, or even Peter James&quot; since, unlike &quot;popular radicalisms&quot; such as those of Velikovsky, Bauval or Hancock, &quot;Rohl has a considerable mastery of his material.&quot;

Professor Amélie Kuhrt, head of Ancient Near Eastern History at University College, London, in one of the standard reference works of the discipline, states:

An extreme low chronology has been proposed recently by a group devoted to revising the absolute chronology of the Mediterranean and Western Asia: P. James et al., &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot;, London, 1991; similar, though slightly diverging revisions, are upheld by another group, too, and partly published in the &quot;Journal of the Ancient Chronology Forum&quot;. The hub for the dating of other cultures is Egypt, so much of the work of both groups focuses on Egyptian evidence. Many scholars feel sympathetic to the critique of weaknesses in the existing chronological framework presented in these volumes, but most archaeologists and ancient historians are not at present convinced that the radical redatings proposed stand up to close examination.

===Radiocarbon dating===
In 2010, a series of corroborated radiocarbon dates were published for dynastic Egypt which suggest some minor revisions to the conventional chronology, but do not support Rohl&#x27;s proposed revisions.

===In popular media===
In 1995, Rohl published his version of the New Chronology, in the best-selling book &quot;A Test of Time&quot;, accompanied by a 1995 Channel 4 three-part series &quot;Pharaohs and Kings - A Biblical Quest&quot;. &quot;A Test of Time&quot; takes up the general scenario presented by James, adding many details omitted in 1991, including the &quot;dramatic results&quot; pertaining to Biblical chronology. Whilst the New Chronology has not been broadly accepted in academia, it has been widely disseminated to the public since the 1990s via Rohl&#x27;s best-selling books and the 1995 Channel 4 television documentary, aired in the United States in 1996 on The Learning Channel. Berthoud (2008) contrasts the &quot;near-unanimous&quot; rejection of Rohl&#x27;s theories in Egyptology with the &quot;sensational effect&quot; his books, combined with the television series, had on the general public.

The reaction of some leading figures from the academic establishment has been very hostile. Kenneth Kitchen presented a &quot;savage review&quot; of &quot;Centuries of Darkness&quot; in the &quot;Times Literary Supplement&quot;, and the British Museum banned &quot;A Test of Time&quot; from its museum store.

===By evangelicals===

In December 1999, the Dutch language internet journal &quot;Bijbel, Geschiedenis en Archeologie&quot; (Bible, History and Archaeology) devoted space to a debate about Rohl&#x27;s New Chronology. According to evangelical scholar, J.G. van der Land, editor of the journal, Rohl&#x27;s time-line resolves some archaeological anomalies surrounding ancient Egypt, but creates conflicts with other areas that make it untenable. His arguments were then countered by Peter van der Veen and Robert Porter. In the final article in the issue, van der Land identified some new issues for Rohl&#x27;s chronology arising from recent finds in Assyrian letters.

<doc id="249689" wikidata="Q937590" url="?curid=249689" title="Long Island MacArthur Airport">
<text>Long Island MacArthur Airport , formerly known as Islip Airport, is a public airport in Ronkonkoma, New York, within the Town of Islip in Suffolk County, on Long Island. Covering , the airport was established in 1942, was activated in 1943, and began serving as a commercial airport in 1960. It has three runways and two helipads.

Owned and operated by the Town of Islip, MacArthur Airport serves Nassau and Suffolk counties as an alternative to John F. Kennedy and LaGuardia airports – both of which are located in the Borough of Queens in New York City. Shuttle buses connect the airport to the Long Island Rail Road&#x27;s Ronkonkoma station.

The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) designated LIMA an Official Metro Airport in early 2011, meaning it is now grouped with LaGuardia, Kennedy, and Newark in travel and informational searches for New York airports, thus providing better exposure. MacArthur Airport does not share the congested airspace of the city-centric airports, and it has an exceptional record of on-time performance. In 2009, 83.6% of flights arrived on time and 85.6% of flights departed on time.

In 2016, it had 124,154 aircraft operations, an average of 340 per day; 84% general aviation; 7% scheduled airline; 6% air taxi and 2% military. In 2017, the airport served more than 1.29 million airline passengers. In July 2018, 247 aircraft were based at Islip: 141 single-engine, 30 multi-engine, 36 jets, 31 helicopters, and 9 military. The town-owned Foreign Trade Zone is next to the airport property.

==History==
=== Early years ===
In April 1942, the Town of Islip contracted with the federal government to build an airfield on town-owned land for military use. Within months, the Civil Aeronautics Administration – the predecessor to today&#x27;s Federal Aviation Administration – funded the construction of the airport and three paved runways through the federally-funded Development of Landing Areas for National Defense (DLAND) program. Originally named Islip Airport, at the suggestion of Charles H. Duryea – a local elected official, the airport was renamed MacArthur Airport after U.S. Army General Douglas MacArthur, whose dramatic escape from the Philippines during World War II had captured the attention of the world. The airport was officially activated in May 1943.

In 1944, Lockheed Aircraft Corporation built the first hangar at the airport. Five years later, the Town of Islip built the airport&#x27;s first terminal building, in preparation for airline flights. Through the 1950s, the Sperry Corporation conducted aerospace research at the airport.

In 1947, the Town of Islip offered the airport to the Port of New York Authority (which is today the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey). The offer was rejected by the authority because of the airport&#x27;s location outside of the port region.

=== Commercial service era===
In 1960, Allegheny Airlines was the first scheduled passenger airline at Islip, flying to Boston, Philadelphia, and Washington, D.C. The March 1961 Official Airline Guide lists five weekday Convair 440 departures: a nonstop to Washington National, one to Baltimore, and three flights direct to Boston via several stops. The General Douglas MacArthur Terminal was completed in 1966. In 1967 Mohawk Airlines began two Fairchild Hiller FH-227 flights a day, to Bridgeport and Albany and beyond with one flight continuing to Toronto. By 1969 Mohawk was flying BAC One-Elevens nonstop to Syracuse. In 1972 Mohawk had nonstops to Albany with direct service to Buffalo and Rochester. Mohawk would soon be merged into Allegheny Airlines.

In 1971, American Airlines began flying nonstop Boeing 727-100s to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. By 1974 Allegheny had started BAC One-Elevens and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s nonstop to Albany and Ronald Reagan Washington National Airport, and direct jets to Burlington, Vermont, Cincinnati, and Detroit. Allegheny continued operating Convair 580s nonstop to Albany, Boston, Bridgeport, and Washington, D.C., in addition to direct Convair 580s to Buffalo and Rochester. Allegheny would be renamed USAir, which then became US Airways, with these respective airlines operating service into the airport for many years before US Airways was merged into American.

The Official Airline Guide (OAG) shows the following passenger jets to Long Island MacArthur nonstop from the following at various times from the late 1960s to the late 1990s, with types:

* Allegheny Airlines: Albany, New Haven, Washington, D.C., National Airport – &quot;BAC One-Eleven&quot;, &quot;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30&quot;
* American: Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, Raleigh/Durham – &quot;Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200,&quot; &quot;Fokker 100,&quot; &quot;McDonnell Douglas MD-80&quot;
* Braniff International Airlines: Orlando – &quot;Boeing 727-200&quot;
* Carnival Air Lines: Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Orlando, Tampa, West Palm Beach – &quot;Boeing 737-400&quot;
* Continental: Washington, D.C., Dulles International Airport – &quot;Boeing 737-300&quot;
* Delta Express: Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa – &quot;Boeing 737-200&quot;
* Eastern Airlines: Atlanta, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Providence – &quot;Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200&quot;
*Mohawk Airlines: Syracuse – &quot;BAC One-Eleven&quot;
* New York Air: Washington, D.C., Dulles International Airport - &quot;McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30&quot; 
* Northeastern International Airways: Boston, Fort Lauderdale, Hartford, Orlando, Philadelphia, St. Petersburg, West Palm Beach – &quot;Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200, Douglas DC-8&quot;
* Spirit Airlines: Detroit, Fort Lauderdale, Fort Myers, Tampa, West Palm Beach – &quot;McDonnell Douglas MD-80, McDonnell Douglas MD-87&quot;
* United: Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport – &quot;Boeing 727-100, Boeing 727-200&quot;
* USAir: Albany, Baltimore, Charlotte, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Pittsburgh, Syracuse, Washington, D.C., National Airport – &quot;Boeing 727-200, Boeing 737-200, Boeing 737-300, Boeing 737-400, BAC One-Eleven, Fokker F28, Fokker 100, McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30&quot;

A number of commuter and regional airlines served the airport from the late 1970s to the late 1990s, including Allegheny Commuter, Altair Airlines, Atlantic Coast Airlines operating as United Express, Business Express Airlines operating as Delta Connection, Continental Express, Empire Airlines (1976-1985), Mall Airways, Metro Airlines Northeast operating as Trans World Express, Mohawk Airlines (a later commuter air carrier version), NewAir and its predecessor New Haven Airways, Piedmont Regional Airlines operating on behalf of Piedmont Airlines (1948-1989), Pilgrim Airlines, Precision Airlines operating as Northwest Airlink, Ransome Airlines and USAir Express and its successor US Airways Express. According to the OAG, prop types operated by these smaller airlines to the airport included the ATR-42, Beechcraft 99, Beechcraft 1900C, BAe Jetstream 31, de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otter, de Havilland Canada DHC-7 Dash 7, de Havilland Canada DHC-8 Dash 8, Dornier 228, Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, Nord 262, Piper Navajo, Saab 340, Short 330, Short 360 and Swearingen Metro.

In 1989, construction of two small, four-gate concourses connected to the existing terminal building commenced. The project was completed in 1990; the two concourses included the first jet bridges installed at the airport.

In 1994, Continental Express was operating ATR-42s nonstop between the airport and the Continental Airlines hub at Newark Airport. By 1999, Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) flying as Delta Connection was operating Canadair CRJ-200s nonstop to the Delta Air Lines hub in Atlanta while Comair, also flying as Delta Connection, was operating Canadair CRJ-200s nonstop to Delta&#x27;s hub in Cincinnati. Also in 1999, Continental Express was flying Embraer ERJ-145s nonstop to the Continental Airlines hub in Cleveland. Southwest Airlines also arrived at Islip in 1999, with nonstop Boeing 737-700s to Baltimore, Chicago Midway Airport, Nashville, and Tampa.

In the early 2000s, Continental Express continued to serve the airport with nonstop regional jets to Cleveland while Continental Connection scheduled nonstop turboprops to Albany, New York; both services ended in 2005. Spirit Airlines scheduled flights to several Florida cities and Detroit, before moving to LaGuardia Airport in 2001; in May 2008 the airline resumed service to Fort Lauderdale from MacArthur, but dropped it shortly thereafter. Delta Express, which had nonstops to Orlando and Fort Lauderdale, dropped MacArthur Airport in 2003 after a decline in traffic. Delta Connection regional jet service to Atlanta flown by Atlantic Southeast Airlines (ASA) on behalf of Delta Air Lines ended on May 1, 2008, following a mid-April announcement that Delta and Northwest Airlines were planning to merge – a move that led to changes for the merged airline.

Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, MacArthur Airport saw a 25% decrease in passenger traffic. Passenger traffic later increased, but they decreased again in 2006. Charts depicting annual operations and passenger boardings are in Appendix C and D. In 2005 MacArthur Airport had 173,135 total operations; during this year 1,055,832 passenger were enplaned, 7.07% more than 2004. In 2006 MacArthur had 189,390 total operations with 1,138,061 passenger boardings. The year 2007 brought total operations at MacArthur down to 184,760 but passenger boardings increased to 1,167,515, MacArthur&#x27;s highest boardings in the last 6 years. In 2008, total operations at MacArthur were 179,230 and passenger boardings were down to 1,048,768; in 2009, 159,736 total operations and 929,902 passenger boardings. From 2005 to 2009 almost every category of MacArthur&#x27;s operations has declined: airline, military, air taxi, and general aviation. A figure was released in the 2010s citing a 46.4% decrease from 2007 to 2012, the most loss in any small hub airport. The figures rose back up as the decade progressed, but temporarily dipped down again in 2020 due to COVID-19. By 2023, the figures had again increased, with 1,278,000 passengers recorded that year.

In 2004, MacArthur Airport embarked on an expansion that included a new, Gensler-designed Southwest Airlines terminal built by the airline at a cost of $65million. Phase one of the expansion included four gates to be used by Southwest, as well as space for shops and restaurants. Phase two, completed in November 2006, added four more gates for a total of eight new gates. Prior to the expansion project, passengers had to pass back through the ticketing area of the airport to reach the baggage claim area. With the completion of Phase two, the new concourse provided a more convenient exit point to baggage claim, ground transportation, and the airport&#x27;s roadway exit. Nevertheless, the location of the baggage claim area still requires most travelers using the airport&#x27;s long-term parking lots to pass back through the ticketing area of the airport to reach their vehicles. The construction of the 2004 expansion caused a scandal when it was discovered that the new concourse was built without the needed approvals from New York State and with numerous violations. 

The then-Suffolk County District Attorney Thomas J. Spotta, who was involved in the investigation of the scandal, stated that large portions of the new concourse were in violation of fire and safety codes, causing risks to public safety. Violations included the main electrical control room being built with improperly-placed fire sprinklers, creating an explosion risk – and natural gas pipes being constructed right below the terminal&#x27;s air conditioning intake manifolds, creating a risk for gas entering the terminal through its ventilation systems in the event of a gas leak. Town officials eventually pled guilty to corruption charges in connection to the scandal, and work was done to rectify the violations and bring the terminal up to all safety and fire codes.

A major proponent of the airport&#x27;s 2004–2006 expansion projects was Peter J. McGowan, then the Islip Town Supervisor; the new concourse was named after McGowan. The terminal was renamed the Veterans Memorial Concourse in homage to Long Island&#x27;s distinction as home to more military veterans than almost any other community in the United States.

In late September 2007, Ryanair, an ultra-low cost airline based in Ireland, proposed to fly between MacArthur Airport and its hub in Dublin, Ireland. The proposal was ultimately called off.

A new control tower was completed in 2010 and opened in 2011 to replace the tower built in the early 1960s, which had become functionally obsolete and had fallen into disrepair. In 2010, construction also began on a new Fuel Farm, which would the open the following year and increase the airport&#x27;s jet fuel supply; it was built through a partnership between the Town of Islip and Southwest Airlines. Soon thereafter, the roadway in front of the terminal was reconfigured; another taxiway was also constructed along with other projects using FAA airport improvement program funds. Development of the West Side, home to a thriving general aviation sector, was to be underway in late 2010.

While the airport continues to expand it has added numerous amenities, including free courtesy cell phone parking. In November 2009, MacArthur Airport became the only airport in the tri-state region to offer free wireless Internet service in the entire terminal and in the courtesy cell phone parking lot. In addition, the airport launched several tools designed to provide up-to-date information to travelers, including its first official website, flyLIMA.com.

In 2014, the airport opened an international arrivals &amp; U.S. Customs facility for private plane passengers, which is able to accommodate non-U.S. Citizens.

In January 2016, plans were announced to build a U.S. Customs Station at MacArthur Airport for commercial flights, with help from financial assistance from New York State Governor Andrew Cuomo – an attempt at making MacArthur an international destination and at enticing airlines to add MacArthur to their destinations; the proposal had been discussed for a number of years by local, state, and federal officials. A marketing campaign for the airport was soon launched by the Town of Islip, including through advertisements on public transportation, digital marketing, and radio spots. Additionally, a new logo and slogan were unveiled.

As of December 2022, Southwest operated year-round, non-stop service to Baltimore, Fort Lauderdale, Orlando, Tampa, Nashville, and West Palm Beach. Allegiant Air previously operated two weekly flights on a seasonal basis to Fort Myers/Punta Gorda, Florida using McDonnell Douglas MD-80s but no longer serves the airport. PenAir began operating two daily nonstop flights to Boston in July 2013, but stopped flying to MacArthur a year later. The last legacy carrier to serve Islip was American Airlines with Embraer ERJ-145 code share flights operated by its American Eagle Airlines regional affiliate Piedmont Airlines to Philadelphia. Service to Washington–National ended on July 2, 2014, after the merger between US Airways and American. The newly merged airline had to cut service to 17 cities from Washington–National because of an antitrust lawsuit preventing the airline from monopolizing slots at National Airport. American Airlines reapplied for nonstop service between MacArthur Airport and Washington–National when two slots opened up, but the airline lost the bid for both in early 2015.

In January 2017, the airport was used as the landing location for the aircraft carrying Joaquin &quot;El Chapo&quot; Guzman to New York with law enforcement agents for his persecution, following his arrest and extradition to the United States from Mexico.

On July 17, 2017, Frontier Airlines announced service to 10 new cities using aircraft as large as the Airbus A321, which approaches the Boeing 757 in range and passenger capacity – a first for the airport in that past decade. Breeze Airways began service to and from the airport in 2022 and added additional routes in 2023.

In 2020, a new general aviation hangar opened at the airport. Ground was also broken that year on a new intermodal transportation facility.

In September 2022, American Airlines ended service to Islip citing a regional pilot shortage as the main reason behind the cut. Also taking place in 2022 was the opening of a new ground transportation center at the airport. This facility houses all of the rental car agencies present on-site at the airport.

In February 2023, the airport property was designated as a superfund site due to chemicals being detected in the soil and groundwater; negotiations between the New York State Department of Environmental Conservation and the Town of Islip soon started, with both parties working to ensure the site&#x27;s cleanup. 

Also taking place in February 2023 was the commencement of a major, $26million terminal renovation project. The Airport received an additional $2.7million in federal funds for further terminal renovations that June.

In February 2024, the Federal Aviation Administration approved the Town of Islip&#x27;s plan to erect a new terminal on the north side of the airport, to be built as part of the Midway Crossing project. The $3.3 billion project will consist of a new terminal and parking facilities; the new terminal will be directly connected to the Ronkonkoma Long Island Rail Road station via a pedestrian walkway. The first phase of the terminal&#x27;s construction will see the construction of eight gates.

In June 2024, JetBlue Airways announced that it would commence service at MacArthur Airport, with flights set to begin that October. The airline&#x27;s service at MacArthur Airport, by the end of 2024, became profitable faster than at any other airport it served. 

On January 15, 2025, JetBlue announced in that it would begin operating seasonal daily non-stop service between Islip and Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, starting that April.

MacArthur Airport’s original terminal opened in 1966. The terminal was expanded between 1989 and 1990, with the creation of two concourses with two gates each. In 2004, construction commenced on the current terminal through an expansion and renovation project funded by Southwest Airlines; the terminal expansion was built off and replaced portions of the existing 1966 terminal, while other, existing portions were renovated.

Additionally, the radio station WRCN-FM maintains its offices and studios within the airport.

=== Air navigation ===
MacArthur Airport has a control tower, located on the south side of the airport. The tower, which replaced one built in the early 1960s, was built at a cost of roughly $20 million (2010 USD) and includes a control cab.

The airport is also equipped with an Automated Surface Observing System (ASOS) for weather forecasting, in addition to having an Automatic Terminal Information Service (ATIS).

Furthermore, the New York Air Route Traffic Control Center (ZNY) – known as an ARTCC for short – is located on the grounds of the airport.

Until the early 1990s, the 2nd Battalion (Attack) of the regiment was based at MacArthur Airport, equipped with Bell Helicopter AH-1 Cobra (F model) gunships. In 2006, the 3rd Battalion (Assault), 142nd Aviation Regiment moved its headquarters from Latham, New York to Long Island MacArthur Airport, bringing its Black Hawk helicopters. In May 2007, following yet another reorganization in which the battalion was re-configured, the unit received its mobilization alert order to participate in Operation Iraqi Freedom. Over the course of their deployment, the unit – which came to be known as Task Force Jester – flew more than 15,000 flight hours. The last of the battalion&#x27;s troops returned home to Long Island MacArthur Airport in May 2009. An Army Aviation Support Facility is also housed at the airport.

<text>Westchester County Airport is a county-owned airport in Westchester County, New York, United States, three miles (6 km) northeast of downtown White Plains, with territory in the towns of North Castle and Harrison, New York, and the village of Rye Brook, New York. It is sometimes referred to as the White Plains Airport and is so identified by the Official Airline Guide (OAG).

The airport primarily serves Westchester County, New York, and Fairfield County, Connecticut; the New York–Connecticut state border runs along its eastern perimeter. Located approximately 33 miles (53 km) north of Midtown Manhattan, it is also considered a satellite or reliever airport for the New York metropolitan area.

The National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015 categorized HPN as a &quot;primary commercial service&quot; airport. Per Federal Aviation Administration records, the airport had 872,023 passenger enplanements in calendar year 2019.

==History==
Westchester County Airport was built during World War II in 1942 as a home to an Air National Guard unit to protect New York City and Rye Lake, part of the city&#x27;s water supply system. In May 1983, with the growth of suburban Westchester, the Guard unit abandoned Westchester Air National Guard Base and moved to Stewart International Airport, in Orange County.

The first scheduled airline flights were by American Airlines in late 1949 with a weekday morning flight from New York LaGuardia Airport to HPN continuing to Syracuse Hancock International Airport and beyond and returning in the evening. Mohawk Airlines replaced American in 1955; Mohawk and successor Allegheny Airlines served HPN until 1979. The first scheduled jet flight was a Mohawk BAC One-Eleven in 1965. Before the federal Airline Deregulation Act in 1978, the airport was served in 1976 by Allegheny Airlines BAC One-Elevens and by several commuter air carriers including Air Speed, Command Airways and Commuter Airlines. Air Florida arrived in 1980 and United Airlines during the mid-1980s. American Airlines also resumed mainline service. Regional carrier Independence Air ceased operations at HPN on January 5, 2006.

Major airlines that previously served the airport include American Airlines, Northwest Airlines, Republic Airlines (1979-1986), United Airlines and USAir (now part of American Airlines). New start up carriers Air Florida, AirTran Airways, Carnival Air Lines, Midway Airlines and New York Air also served the airport. AirTran Airways began service at the airport in 2006 with flights to Atlanta, Orlando and West Palm Beach. These flights ended on August 11, 2012. Smaller regional and commuter air carriers that previously operated flights included Air North, Altair Airlines, Business Express Airlines, Boston-Maine Airways (operating as Pan Am Clipper Connection), Brockway Air, Command Airways, Commuter Airlines, Continental Express (now United Express), Empire Airlines, Independence Air, Island Air, Mall Airways and USAir Express. These airlines operated the following jets to the airport:

* Air Florida – Boeing 737-200
* AirTran – Boeing 717-200
* Allegheny Airlines – BAC One-Eleven
* American Airlines – Fokker 100
* Carnival Air Lines – Boeing 737-200
* Continental Express – Embraer ERJ-135 (operated by ExpressJet for Continental Airlines)
* Empire Airlines – Fokker F28 Fellowship
* Midway Airlines – Douglas DC-9-10
* Mohawk Airlines – BAC One-Eleven
* New York Air – McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32
* Northwest Airlines – McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30
* Northwest Jetlink (operated by Mesaba Airlines on behalf of Northwest Airlines) - Avro RJ85
* Republic Airlines (1979-1986) – McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30
* United Airlines – Boeing 737-200, 737-300 and 737-500
* USAir – Fokker 100

In the summer of 1981 Air Florida&#x27;s timetable listed international nonstop Boeing 737-200 service to Bermuda from the airport.

In June 2005, a drunken teenager and two of his friends stole a Cessna 172 from nearby Danbury Municipal Airport around 1 a.m. and landed on a taxiway at Westchester County Airport around 4 a.m. The aircraft was low on fuel and allegedly flying erratically. HPN airport was closed at the time and no runway lights were illuminated. Police arrived on the scene and reported beer bottles falling out of the aircraft as they arrested the teens, all of whom were charged with various felonies relating to the unauthorized use of the aircraft, theft, and alcohol impairment.

JetBlue began service at the airport in 2007 and is currently the airport&#x27;s largest carrier by scheduled passengers.

In June 2009, Cape Air commenced service to Westchester with flights to Martha&#x27;s Vineyard and Nantucket in Massachusetts. They then introduced service to Lebanon (NH) in early 2010. In Summer 2022, they eliminated all flights out of White Plains except for subsidized essential air service routes from Lebanon.

In May 2011, the New York State Department of Transportation published the &quot;New York Statewide Airport Economic Impact Study,&quot; highlighting the economic impacts of public-use airports in New York state for fiscal year 2009. The study noted that HPN was one of only three airports in the state that increased its enplanements, surpassing the U.S. benchmark. It also noted that the cumulative economic activity for the airport was approximately $736 million.

On April 27, 2020, the airport was closed to general aviation traffic for one week and commercial airlines for about a month so Runway 16/34 could be repaved, a project originally scheduled to span four months with construction only occurring from midnight to 6 AM. This decision was made in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic-related air travel cuts, which drastically reduced commercial airline service to the airport. Some operators were forced to ferry their aircraft to nearby airports where they could continue flights. This was the first total shutdown of a U.S. commercial airport for reasons relating to the COVID-19 pandemic.

On April 20, 2022, Breeze Airways announced several new routes from the airport, including the airport&#x27;s first-ever commercial transcontinental services – although all of the transcontinental routes were later cut.

==Facilities and aircraft==
Westchester County Airport covers 702 acres (284 ha) at an elevation of 439 feet (134 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt paved runways: 16/34 is 6,549 by 150 feet (1,996 x 46 m) and 11/29 is 4,451 by 150 feet (1,357 x 46 m). Runway 29&#x27;s threshold is displaced 1,297 feet (395 m) due to trees obstructing the approach path. The trees (in Connecticut) are 37 ft (11 m) tall and 370 ft (113 m) from the end of the runway.

Westchester County Airport has several fixed-base operators (FBOs), including Signature Flight Support East and West, Atlantic Aviation East and West, NetJets, and Million Air. Although varied in services offered, the FBOs at Westchester County Airport provide Jet A and 100LL fueling services, repairs and maintenance, aircraft tie-downs, de-icing, United States Customs, and other aircraft services.

Westchester County Airport is also the home of the New York Wing Civil Air Patrol headquarters, the Lt. Anthony L. Willsea Cadet Squadron (NY-422).

Aircraft Rescue Fire Fighting (ARFF) is provided by Airport Operations Crews. The airport owns three ARFF apparatuses (three Oshkosh Striker 1500s), two of which are in service full-time. The ARFF Crews only respond to aircraft emergencies. All structure-related fire and rescue calls are deferred to the local fire departments. The Purchase Fire Department, for example, handles all structure calls on the southern part of the airfield, the Armonk Fire Department handles calls on the northern part and the Rye Brook/Port Chester Fire Department handle all calls on the east end, including the main terminal. EMS calls are handled by Port Chester-Rye-Rye Brook EMS, Harrison EMS and Armonk Fire/EMS depending on location of call.

In 2010, the airport had 191,017 total aircraft operations, an average of 523 per day: 23% commercial aviation, 48% heavy general aviation, and 29% light general aviation. 316 aircraft, including helicopters, are based out of this airport.
An aircraft must have a maximum gross weight of 120,000 pounds or less, or permission from the manager, to land at the airport.

===Terminal===

Westchester County Airport has one small, three-level terminal with six gates, of which only four can be used simultaneously because only four aircraft can be scheduled to use the terminal&#x27;s ramp at any given time. The $35 million terminal was built in 1995 and designed by Lothrop Associates. Gates 1, 2, 3, and 4 have jetways. The terminal also has a luggage carousel, a baggage claim office and two Transportation Security Administration (TSA) screening lanes. Passenger amenities include a gift shop, departure lounge, and food concessions.

In November 2015, the airport began a $30 million construction project to expand the terminal and ramp areas. The project expanded the terminal by 20% and include additional check-in, screening and passenger waiting areas. The expansion also included the addition of four new jet bridges. A separate terminal with &quot;lodge-like ambiance&quot; to serve passengers of private jets opened in 2019.

==Operations==
In its effort to mitigate aircraft noise pollution in neighboring communities, HPN maintains six major noise abatement programs that are in effect daily.

One of them is its Voluntary Restraint from Flying Program (VRFF), sometimes referred to as a voluntary curfew, that helps assuage anti-airport complainants by requesting—not mandating—that operators refrain from flying into the airport between midnight and 6:30 AM. Those that breach the VRFF are reminded of the initiative and notified of any noise complaints that may have resulted from their operations.

The airport&#x27;s Airport Noise and Operations Monitoring System (ANOMS) collects noise data from remote noise-monitoring terminals, and both registered aircraft and community noise levels are published in the Airport Monitor. This system works in conjunction with the High Range Noise Event (HRNE) Program; ANOMS staff can identity any operator who causes a maximum noise level event of 90.0 decibels or higher at any of its remote noise monitor terminals and advise them in order to prevent future noise level transgressions. As of September 2020, there are no fines, penalties, or aircraft restrictions associated with this program.

Additionally, HPN prohibits intersection takeoffs from its runways and restricts maintenance run-ups &amp; the use of reverse thrust. It also employs Advanced Authorization for operations.

The airport&#x27;s environmental management performance is monitored through its ISO 14001 certified Airport Environmental Management System (AEMS). This enables operators to report the airport&#x27;s impacts on surface water, groundwater, and noise. Airport-wide environmental management practices are also continually revised with this technology, and annual objectives and targets are determined to avoid or mitigate adverse environmental impacts. In addition, airport employees receive environmental training. In 2004, HPN was the third airport in the U.S. to achieve this level of environmental performance.

=== Controversies ===
Expansion of the airport has raised concerns over adverse environmental impacts by numerous community advocacy groups and area residents. The facility lies between the Blind Brook watershed and the Rye Lake watershed/Kensico Reservoir. The Citizens for a Responsible County Airport, which count the Sierra Club Lower Hudson and Federated Conservationists of Westchester as supporters, has raised safety concerns about the stormwater runoff directed towards Westchester and New York City&#x27;s drinking water supply. They are especially alarmed about PFAS discovered in groundwater tests between the Airport and the Kensico watershed.

In addition to the longtime controversy over the airport and its proposed expansions, concerns have also arisen regarding travelers seeking relief from long delays at the other New York metropolitan area airports, such as John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK) and LaGuardia Airport (LGA). More recently, these concerns pertain to flight paths and vehicular congestion. The latter has been addressed by the County of Westchester with the introduction of Bee-Line Bus service from downtown White Plains, and the encouragement of carpooling.

== Access ==

===Car===
The airport can be accessed from I-684&#x27;s Exit 2 onto New York State Route 120, via County Route 135. It can also be accessed by New York State Route 120A from the east, via Rye Lake Avenue.

===Public transportation===

Bee-Line Route 12 provides regular daily service between the passenger terminal and the White Plains TransCenter and the adjacent White Plains Metro-North Railroad station in White Plains – in addition to SUNY Purchase College and Manhattanville University in Purchase.

==Accidents and incidents==
* December 18, 1954: A Lockheed Model 18 Lodestar, aircraft registration number &quot;N711SE&quot;, clipped trees about before it struck the ground on a knoll located on the instrument landing system (ILS) approach path. The ceiling was with visibility. Both pilots were killed.
* February 11, 1981: A Lockheed Jetstar 731, registration &quot;N520S&quot;, crashed from the approach end of runway 16 into a heavily wooded area in Armonk, New York. The aircraft&#x27;s electrical system had malfunctioned causing a deviation of the flightpath. The two crew and six passengers died.
* December 24, 1988: A Beechcraft A36 Bonanza, registration &quot;N555ST&quot;, crashed and was destroyed after departure in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC); the pilot and two passengers were killed. The crash occurred about 35 seconds after the pilot acknowledged an air traffic control (ATC) instruction to change radio frequencies, and witnesses reported that the aircraft was flying in a circle before impact. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to spatial disorientation, pilot distraction, and the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain the climb; poor visibility was a contributing factor.
* June 14, 1990: A Cessna 337G Skymaster, registration &quot;N72476&quot;, went into a stall and crashed after flying through low clouds on approach. The pilot, who did not have an instrument rating nor any documented experience with instrument flight rules (IFR) operations, had been given a special visual flight rules (SVFR) landing clearance after being advised of IMC at the airport. The aircraft was destroyed and the pilot and single passenger were killed. The NTSB attributed the accident to the pilot&#x27;s decision to fly under visual flight rules into instrument meteorological conditions (VFR into IMC) and his subsequent loss of aircraft control. Bad weather and the pilot&#x27;s lack of IFR experience were contributing factors.
* June 22, 2001: A Piper PA-32R-301, registration &quot;N13VH&quot;, struck the ground while the pilot was executing a missed approach in low visibility; the crash destroyed the aircraft and killed the pilot, who was the sole aircraft occupant. Immediately prior to the accident, the pilot had failed to respond to ATC, and performed a series of erratic ascents and descents. Post-crash toxicology tests found signs of chlorpheniramine, a sedating antihistamine, in the pilot&#x27;s blood and urine. The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) attributed the accident to loss of control and spatial disorientation. Contributing factors were fog and the pilot&#x27;s use of sedating medication.
* December 31, 2001: A Beechcraft BE-23-B24R Sierra, registration &quot;N2173W&quot;, lost altitude in a steep turn and crashed in a parking lot while maneuvering to land. The crash and ensuing fire destroyed the aircraft and killed the pilot, who was the sole aircraft occupant. The pilot had diverted to Westchester County Airport after losing radio communications; the cause of the radio failure was not conclusively determined. The NTSB attributed the accident to a loss of aircraft control.
* April 23, 2005: A Cessna 172R, registration &quot;N61AF&quot;, crashed into trees about short of runway 16 during a practice ILS approach in IMC. The aircraft was destroyed and the student pilot and flight instructor were killed. The NTSB attributed the accident to the pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain adequate altitude. Contributing factors were low ceilings, fog, and gusty wind.
* June 18, 2011: A Cessna T210N, registration &quot;N210KW&quot;, crashed on approach after the pilot took off from Westchester County Airport, immediately declared an emergency of an unspecified nature, and attempted to return. The aircraft came to rest inverted and was consumed in a post-crash fire, killing the pilot and all three passengers. Witnesses reported that the engine ran poorly before the flight and that the pilot performed an unusually large number of engine runups, while post-crash examination of the engine found evidence of severe detonation and improper timing of one magneto. Furthermore, noise abatement recordings from the airport revealed that the engine was significantly quieter on approach than during departure, suggesting that the pilot had reduced the power setting. The NTSB attributed the accident to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s decision to depart on the flight with a suspected mechanical deficiency and his subsequent decision to fly the final approach at a reduced power setting. Contributing to the accident was the improper timing of the magneto(s) that resulted in a severe detonation event.&quot;
* June 13, 2014: A Piper PA-46-500TP, registration &quot;N5335R&quot;, crashed into trees at high speed immediately after an IMC takeoff, destroying the aircraft and killing the pilot, who was the sole occupant. Reportedly in a rush, the pilot arrived at the airport 1 hour and 15 minutes prior to his scheduled departure time, demanding that the aircraft be readied immediately; the aircraft departed 23 minutes later. The accident was attributed to &quot;The pilot&#x27;s failure to maintain a positive climb rate after takeoff due to spatial disorientation (somatogravic illusion). Contributing to the accident was the pilot&#x27;s self-induced pressure to depart and his decision to depart in low-ceiling and low-visibility conditions.&quot;
* January 19, 2023: a Beechcraft A36 Bonanza, registration &quot;N19MT&quot;, crashed into trees on the northern edge of Rye Lake, which is located next the airport, killing both occupants, the pilot and a passenger. The aircraft, en route to Cuyahoga County Airport from John F. Kennedy International Airport, reported low oil pressure and then engine problems to White Plains ATC approximately a mile away from the airport at 5:25pm ET. 5 minutes later, contact with the aircraft was lost, before reportedly crashing at around 5:38pm ET. The FAA and NTSB are currently investigating the crash.
* December 12, 2024: a Tecnam P2008, registration &quot;N298PM&quot;, crashed around 6:45 PM on Interstate 684 near the airport, killing one aircraft occupant and critically injuring the other. The flight took off from Linden, New Jersey, around 6 PM. The pilot reported engine issues prior to the crash. The New York State Police, the FAA, and the NTSB initiated investigations.

== Airport code ==
The IATA code for Westchester County Airport is HPN. The origins of this code are in dispute. Some believe it is derived from the name of the city, White Plains (IATA codes normally do not begin with W because those are reserved for radio signals), while others maintain the IATA code represents the first letter of the airport&#x27;s three neighboring communities, Harrison, Purchase, and North Castle. The full ICAO code for Westchester County Airport is KHPN.

== In popular culture ==
* The airport was a filming location for &quot;The Best Man&quot;, &quot;Random Hearts&quot;, and &quot;Meet The Parents&quot;.
* In &quot;The West Wing&quot; episode &quot;Celestial Navigation&quot;, Leo tells Toby and Sam to &quot;Fly to Westchester County Airport and rent a car&quot; to get their United States Supreme Court nominee, Roberto Mendoza, out of jail in Connecticut.
* In an episode of &quot;The Newsroom&quot;, Don Keefer explains to Sloan Sabbith that the most likely airports for out-of-town equity firm executives to use while visiting New York City in their private jets would be either &quot;Teterboro or White Plains.&quot;
* In &quot;Shaft 2000&quot; Walter Wade Jr. lands in his personal jet in this airport after two-year flight from justice. After the landing he is rearrested by John Shaft right in the airport.

<text>The Dutch Golden Age was a period in Dutch history, roughly equivalent to the 17th century, in which Dutch trade, science and art were top ranking in the world until Tulip Mania in 1637 and onwards.

*Hendrick de Keyser (1565–1621), preferred a style that was much more sober than his contemporary Lieven de Key, built the &quot;Zuiderkerk&quot; (1606–1614), the &quot;Westerkerk&quot; (1620–1638) and the &quot;Exchange&quot; (1608–1611) in Amsterdam, &quot;Town Hall&quot; of Delft (1619), several canal houses in Amsterdam (see also section sculpture)
*Jacob van Campen (1595–1657), embraced classicism fully and served as an example for many colleagues, built the &quot;Mauritshuis&quot; in The Hague (1635), the Dam Palace in Amsterdam (1648–1655), which was originally the town hall, now a royal palace

Less famous architects from this period were:

== Literature ==
The most famous Dutch men of letters of the 17th century were: 
*Joost van den Vondel (1587–1679), poet and playwright, who wrote more than 30 plays, many of those based on biblical stories. After &quot;The Gijsbrecht&quot; (see above) his best known drama is &quot;Lucifer&quot; (1654). He translated many French, Italian, Latin and Greek works. A recurring theme is man&#x27;s inner conflicts, on the one hand rebellious, on the other hand pledging obedience to God.
*Gerbrand Adriaensz. Bredero (1585–1618), poet (sonnets) and dramatist (comedies), his most famous comedy, &quot;De Spaanse Brabander&quot; (English: &quot;The Spanish Brabanter&quot;), describes the seamy side of life in Amsterdam
*Pieter Corneliszoon Hooft (1581–1647), historian, poet and dramatist, who wrote &quot;Nederlandsche Historiën&quot; (English: &quot;Dutch History&quot;), which was never completed, but highly valued. His poetry was of high standard as well. He introduced French and Italian lyricism into Dutch poetry.
*Jacob Cats (1577–1660), poet, famous for his moralistic writings. &quot;Houwelijck&quot; and &quot;Trouringh&quot; (English:&quot;Marriage&quot; and &quot;Wedding ring&quot;) are two major volumes to educate the Dutch about these serious affairs. Indeed, his all too serious tone, lacking humour and esprit, made him a lesser writer than the three named above, and sometimes the object of mockery. His &quot;Kinderen zijn hinderen&quot; (English: &quot;Children are a nuisance&quot;) is still a Dutch saying, often followed by the remark that Cats probably had forgotten that he had been a child himself.

Less famous literary men from this period were:
*Roemer Visscher (1547–1620), writer of epigrams and emblemata
*Karel van Mander (1548–1606), wrote the &quot;Schilderboeck&quot;, a book about painting, and also several biographies about painters

*Artus I Quellinus (1609–1668), Artus II Quellinus (his nephew) (1625–1700) and Rombout Verhulst (1625–1696).

<text>New York Stewart International Airport – colloquially known as Stewart International Airport, is a public/military airport in Orange County, New York, United States. It is in the southern Hudson Valley, west of Newburgh, south of Kingston, and southwest of Poughkeepsie, approximately north of Manhattan, New York City. 

Stewart Airport is located within the towns of Newburgh and New Windsor. It is included in the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2017–2021, in which it is categorized as a non-hub primary commercial service facility.

Developed in the 1930s as a military base to allow cadets at the nearby United States Military Academy at West Point to learn aviation, it has grown into a significant passenger airport for the mid-Hudson region and continues as a military airfield, housing the 105th Airlift Wing of the New York Air National Guard and Marine Aerial Refueler Transport Squadron 452 (VMGR-452) of the United States Marine Corps Reserve. The airport was designated as an emergency landing site for the Space Shuttle.

After its closure as a U.S. Air Force base in the 1970s, an ambitious plan by Governor Nelson Rockefeller to expand and develop the airport led to a protracted struggle with local landowners that led to reforms in the state&#x27;s eminent domain laws but no actual development of the land acquired. In 1981 the 52 American hostages held in Iran made their return to American soil at Stewart.

In 2000 the airport became the first U.S. commercial airport privatized when United Kingdom-based National Express was awarded a 99-year lease on the airport. After postponing its plans to change the facility&#x27;s name after considerable local opposition, it sold the rights to the airport seven years later; the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey board voted to acquire the remaining 93 years of the lease and later awarded AFCO AvPorts the contract to operate the facility. The Port Authority rebranded the airport as New York Stewart International Airport in 2018 to emphasize its proximity to New York City.

==History==

===Stewart Dairy Farm===
In 1930 Thomas &quot;Archie&quot; Stewart, an early aviation enthusiast and descendant of prominent local dairy farmer Lachlan Stewart, convinced his uncle Samuel Stewart to donate &quot;Stoney Lonesome&quot;, split between the towns of Newburgh and New Windsor, to the nearby city of Newburgh for use as an airport. With the city strapped for cash due to the Depression, however, it was unable to develop it in any way.
===Stewart Airfield===
In 1934 Douglas MacArthur, then superintendent of the United States Military Academy, proposed flight training cadets at the airport. The city sold the land to the military academy for one dollar. A small dirt airstrip was cleared and graded. One of the gates at USMA has been known as Stoney Lonesome Gate ever since.

During World War II many barracks and other buildings, which still stand, were built on the base. In January 2008, the Town of New Windsor received a $2.5 million grant from the state to demolish 30–40 buildings as part of the redevelopment of the former base. First Columbia, the developer, said that 20–30 could be retained and reused.
===Stewart Air Force / Air National Guard Base===


After the creation of the United States Air Force following World War II, the army airfield was converted to an air force base while still being used for training of cadets at West Point. Stewart became the home of Headquarters 1st Region Army Air Defense Command in 1966. It remained so until the deactivation of the Nike Hercules system at the end of 1974. The air force base was deactivated in 1970 and it officially remained unoccupied by the Air Force until 1983, when the 105th Airlift Wing (105 AW) and the 213th Engineer Installation Squadron (213 EIS) of the New York Air National Guard took up quarters. The Air National Guard unit has flown support missions not only for U.S. military operations in Iraq and Afghanistan but also for humanitarian relief efforts.

This area of the airport, now called Stewart Air National Guard Base, was home to the Air Force C-5 Galaxy aircraft before being replaced by the newer and smaller C-17 Globemaster III in 2011. Stewart ANGB also hosted VMGR-452, a Marine Corps Reserve squadron flying the KC-130J, until 2022.

===Stewart International Airport===

====MTA Expansion plan====
In the early 1970s, Governor Nelson Rockefeller&#x27;s administration saw the potential for Stewart to support the metropolitan area. Its long runway made it particularly attractive for intercontinental service via supersonic transport (SST), then under development in the U.S. and elsewhere.

The Metropolitan Transportation Authority was the first government body to try to convert it into the New York metropolitan area&#x27;s fourth major airport. It tripled the airport&#x27;s territory, extending its land well beyond its previous western boundary at Drury Lane, a two-lane rural road. The state government used its eminent domain powers to take 7,500 acres (30 km) for terminals, runways and a buffer zone expanding the airport from Newburgh into neighboring towns of Montgomery and a small portion of Hamptonburgh. The land was bounded by I-84 to the north, Route 207 along the south and roughly by Rock Tavern and Maybrook in the west.

====Local opposition====
Area residents who were already fighting a large power plant proposal at nearby Storm King Mountain fiercely fought the expansion. They took the state to court, ultimately forcing the legislature to write and pass the New York State Eminent Domain Procedure Act, a sweeping overhaul of its existing law on the subject. In order to get the last holdouts off their land, state officials pledged that outside the proposed airport facilities, none of the land taken would ever be redeveloped, a promise that was to haunt them years later.

By the time the land was finally available, the 1973 oil crisis and the attendant increase in the price of jet fuel had forced airlines to cut back, and some of the airport&#x27;s original backers began arguing it was no longer economically viable. US SST development was canceled in 1971, undercutting another argument for the project. Malcolm Wilson, Rockefeller&#x27;s successor, put the project on hold; and his successor, Hugh Carey, ended it permanently in 1976.

====New York State Department of Transportation ownership====
In early 1981, the 52 U.S. hostages held at the former U.S. Embassy in Tehran, Iran, returned to American soil at Stewart International following two weeks at U.S. bases in Germany and 444 days of captivity, ending the Iran hostage crisis. The route they took from Stewart International to West Point is marked today as &quot;Freedom Road.&quot;

The next year the state transferred control from MTA to its own Department of Transportation (NYSDOT), with a mandate to improve and develop the airport. Three years later W.R. Grace became the first private tenant when it built a corporate jet hangar, and the following year an industrial park was built nearby. Finally, in 1990, commercial airline service began with American Airlines offering service with three daily round trips to both Chicago and Raleigh/Durham.

=====Continuing development issues=====
As the 1980s wore on, veterans of earlier battles over Stewart returned to start new ones. NYSDOT and the Stewart Airport Commission found themselves overseeing not only the airport but the acres of now-vacant land the state had acquired a decade before. After turning over management of most of the property to the state&#x27;s Department of Environmental Conservation (DEC), which was better equipped for the task, it still faced the problem of what to do with the land.

The region&#x27;s needs had changed. With IBM and other large industrial concerns cutting workers and closing plants, and people leaving, a large swath of buildable land with few environmental problems was seen by many in the local business community as a goose&#x27;s golden egg. It couldn&#x27;t be a sprawling airport, but it could be something else, they thought.

But those people who remained or moved up from more crowded areas to the south had begun to enjoy the outdoor recreation possibilities the lands, referred to variously as the Stewart Properties or the buffer, offered. Mountain bikers, horses, dirt bikers, ATVers, and hikers had all begun to explore and create trails, and DEC&#x27;s management opened up the area as a popular spot for local hunters and anglers. DEC had also released captured beavers on the properties, who built dams and created new wetlands.

One local hunter, Ben Kissam, formed the Stewart Park and Reserve Coalition (SPARC) in 1987 to oppose efforts to develop the lands. They and other environmentalists and conservationists argued that the whole area would be better off left as a park, pointing to the growing diversity of species on the lands and the state&#x27;s original promise not to redevelop the area. They were joined, too, by some area residents who said that the existing air traffic, particularly the military C-5s, was noisy enough as it was.

Also generating a lot of noise was the continuing debate in Orange County about what to do with the land, with participants&#x27; choice of words (&quot;buffer&quot; vs. &quot;properties&quot;) suggesting where they stood, and interpretations differing about just how much of the land was really meant to serve as a buffer.

The administration of Mario Cuomo tried several times to come up with a plan that would balance these interests, but failed. As one of its last acts, it started a renovation of the passenger terminal using a federal grant.

SWF had occasionally had scheduled air-taxi service, but in April 1990 American Airlines arrived with three Boeing 727-200 nonstops a day to Chicago and three more to its new hub in Raleigh–Durham. Nonstop flights to Dallas Fort/Worth were later added as well. Jet nonstops to Atlanta (Delta) and Pittsburgh (USAir) appeared in the next couple of years; Delta later added Cincinnati and USAir tried Baltimore.
====Privatization====
In 1994 George Pataki campaigned on improving efficiencies by privatizing money-losing state projects. Ronald Lauder, who had written a book about European successes in privatizations, suggested Stewart be privatized. Pataki created the New York State Council on Privatization and appointed Lauder its chair.

Federal law at the time required that all airports providing passenger service had to be owned by some public entity. With much support from the New York delegation, the United States Congress eventually passed legislation allowing five airports to be privatized as a pilot program, providing certain conditions, such as approval by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and by the carriers representing at least two-thirds of the airport&#x27;s flights.

In 1997 the state formally began, through the Empire State Development Corporation (ESDC), the process of soliciting bids for a 99-year lease on the airport and, potentially, the adjacent undeveloped lands as well, whatever bidders wanted. Efforts by SPARC, now headed by Kissam&#x27;s widow Sandra, and other citizen activists to find out about who might be bidding and what they planned to do with Stewart were blocked by the state&#x27;s invocation of a clause in its State Finance Law prohibiting disclosure of competitive bids prior to the award of the contract: an interpretation that survived a court challenge.

Two years later, after approval by the state&#x27;s attorney general and comptroller as well as the FAA and the carriers, the contract was awarded to the UK-based National Express PLC, the only one of five bidders to have declined to present at a special forum organized a week prior to award, and also a company Lauder had praised in his book for its success with the UK&#x27;s national bus service and subsequent acquisition of East Midlands Airport, leading to some suspicions that the state had always intended to give it the airport from the beginning. NEG (National Express Group) was prepared to pay $35 million for the lease, and after working out the details Pataki handed over a ceremonial key at the passenger terminal in late 2000.

The award also ended, for the most part, the controversy over whether to develop the properties or not. NEG was uninterested in the lands west of Drury Lane, and Pataki announced with the privatization deal that he was directing that ownership as well as management of 5,600 acres (22.4 km2) of the lands west of an envelope DOT retained around Drury for possible future development or disposal be transferred directly to DEC, which has since made that portion Stewart State Forest.

Stewart was one of the many regional airports to be used during the Emergency Ground Stop after the September 11th Attacks, taking in dozens of planes forced to land.

====The Drury Lane exit====

Simultaneously with the privatization, the state proceeded with long-held plans to build a new interchange on Interstate 84 at Drury Lane, which would also be widened. A four-lane east–west access road, International Boulevard, would also be created to better solve the airport&#x27;s longstanding access problems (see below). Conveniently, the initial price tag, $35 million, was exactly the amount bid by National Express. The new exit, designated 5A, was opened in the fourth quarter of 2007. The new north–south route is now designated Route 747.

Another complication emerged due to the proximity of the Catskill Aqueduct of New York City&#x27;s water supply system to the exit; a proposed widening of Drury between the interstate and Route 17K would have required that a bridge be built over the aqueduct to protect it from the vibrations associated with heavy trucks, adding to the cost of the whole project. An alternative emerged during a value-engineering study of simply rerouting Drury Lane to create another four-way intersection farther down 17K, which was ultimately done. Whether the properties along Drury lane could even be developed in any measure remains to be seen, as a good portion of that parcel is either wetlands or a trapezoid-shaped Runway Protection Zone in which the FAA mandates that nothing be built – and the remainder is land considered by conservationists to be the best land in the properties. SPARC, the Orange County Federation of Sportsmen&#x27;s Clubs and the national Sierra Club filed a lawsuit in federal court alleging that required environmental reviews were not done or done improperly; that action tied up the exit&#x27;s construction for a while. In March 2005, an area slated for wetlands mitigation under the plans was found to harbor purple milkweed, a Species of Special Concern on the National Heritage Program&#x27;s rare plant list. SPARC and its co-plaintiffs sought an injunction against further action such as the consideration of bids, yet that went ahead anyway.

The controversy was settled by a deal announced on November 21 of that year. SPARC accepted a compromise where in exchange for the construction of the exit and access road 1,700 acres (6.8 km2) of the remaining buffer lands would be added to the forest and restrictions would be imposed on development of the remaining 400 acres (1.6 km2) in the northeast corner of the properties, near the exit.

In July 2006, the state formally transferred ownership of the state forest from DOT to DEC, ending the process of creating Stewart State Forest. Orange County was not thrilled with the state&#x27;s decision to charge it $3.7 million for the area near the exit, saying that it was too much on top of the costs it would incur putting in infrastructure. DOT said it was just asking fair market value for the land.

====NEG Management====
NEG&#x27;s marketing initiatives included several proposed new names for the airport to emphasize its proximity to the city. The last one, in 2006, which would have dropped the &quot;Stewart&quot; name entirely, met with local opposition and was ultimately dropped.

Stewart has a limited selection of flights available and is relatively uncrowded most of the day. Some tenants have moved into nearby former military buildings, but most remain as unoccupied as they were the day the base was closed. It has drawn some passengers from western Connecticut who might otherwise have flown out of Hartford. But most of the fliers within Stewart&#x27;s catchment area have continued to prefer Albany International Airport, Newark or other metropolitan airports.

Delta pulled out of the airport shortly after the privatization announcement, ostensibly to better serve new routes it had won to Latin America, leaving it to codeshare partners Comair and ASA. Even one of the &quot;tourist draws&quot; for the airport evaporated in 2003 when the Concorde was retired. Its pilots had sometimes used the lengthy runway to practice touch-and-go landings.

NEG&#x27;s dealings with the state were not as harmonious as they were initially represented; documents made public by SPARC after the privatization was completed showed that there were many lingering issues between the two parties even at that time and that NEG had in fact considered breaking the deal at one point (as it would later ultimately do). The company has gone through some local management shuffles as well, and the parent corporation&#x27;s sale of East Midlands, considered the example it would follow with Stewart, was a cause for concern in the region.

While some local officials expressed disappointment, others saw NEG as getting out of the airport business entirely to concentrate on its core business in the bus and rail sectors. They hoped at first that another European company with experience running privatized airports would be interested, and industry analysts said the timing was good. Governor Eliot Spitzer promised area leaders that Stewart would be a top priority for his administration, and the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, which runs the New York area&#x27;s three main airports, expressed interest in assuming NEG&#x27;s obligations. Allegiant Air pulled out of Stewart in early 2007 but later returned and as of 2024 serves the airport. Both AirTran Airways and JetBlue announced plans for service from Stewart in 2007. AirTran, which had previously served Newburgh in 1995, was subsequently acquired by and merged into Southwest Airlines, which in turn currently does not serve the airport.

In 2005, the airport was used to transport emergency personnel and supplies to help the cleanup after the destruction of Hurricane Katrina, which devastated the Gulf Coast.

====Port Authority takeover and end of privatization====
On January 25, 2007, the Port Authority voted to buy the lease for Stewart. It took over operating control on November 1, 2007, after New Jersey&#x27;s acting governor Richard Codey signed a bill the New Jersey Legislature had to pass, changing the law to allow the move. PANYNJ will pay NEG $78.5 million for the remaining 93 years on its lease. The day after the takeover, an opening ceremony was held in which New York State Governor Eliot Spitzer attended and the Port Authority flag was raised. It has set aside $500 million in its ten-year capital improvement plan to expand the airport.

The Port Authority sees Stewart as offering relief to those airports and (especially) Teterboro, estimating it could handle five times its present passenger volume. It will probably follow its standard procedure and contract the actual operations of the airport out.

Although 2006&#x27;s bad numbers may have led NEG to pull out, Stewart&#x27;s commercial service seemed to be on the rise. Shortly after taking over, PANYNJ reported that the airport&#x27;s traffic for 2007 would be triple that of 2006. It was reported in January 2008 that Stewart had achieved its goal and had handled 970,000 passengers in 2007.

A 2007 plan envisioned changing Stewart&#x27;s image over the next 20 years: major renovations such as a new terminal, a train station next to the new terminal connecting the airport to Metro North via a new spur from the Port Jervis Line, a extension of runway 16–34, new taxiways, and a major expansion of the cargo facilities. A new control tower has been built. In the fourth quarter of 2007 Interstate 84&#x27;s new Drury Lane exit, NY Route 747, and International Boulevard opened.

In addition to commercial and passenger services, Stewart excels in many other areas not seen by the public. NEG had some success selling private helicopter shuttle service to midtown Manhattan&#x27;s heliports to business travelers from Stewart at rates competitive with those offered from JFK Airport; it also remains a popular place to service corporate jets due to the large space available.

Cargo services are also part of the mix – FedEx Express maintains a large distribution presence just outside the airport, as does the U.S. Postal Service, whose main general-mail facility for the mid-Hudson region is not far away. Importers of plant and animal products also route their flights to Stewart and the USDA inspection facility for those is nearby, on Drury Lane.

With its long runway, Stewart bills itself as an &quot;efficient diversion airport&quot; for aircraft intending to land at one of the three major New York City airports (Newark, LaGuardia, and JFK), especially during bad weather. The largest such diversion occurred during the January 2018 blizzard, when a Singapore Airlines Airbus A380 on a Frankfurt-JFK flight diverted to Stewart after JFK closed. While the airport&#x27;s runways are sufficiently long to allow such a large aircraft to land and take off, the plane was so large it could not use any of the terminal building&#x27;s gates. Passengers had to leave the plane using stairs, and were transported to New York City by bus.

American Airlines, which had served Stewart since 1990, ended American Eagle regional jet service to Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport on September 5, 2007. In 1991, American was operating up to five mainline departures a day nonstop to Chicago O&#x27;Hare with Boeing 727-200 jetliners.

In February 2008, the PA&#x27;s new general manager, Diannae Ehler, said she had been discussing the possibility of foreign flights with a number of European carriers. She felt encouraged and hoped that by 2009 there could be regular passenger service between Stewart and some European destinations. AirTran Airways ended service to the airport that same year.

In September 2010, it was announced that Apple Vacations would begin non-stop charter service to Cancún. Flights are operated by Allegiant Air.

On August 20, 2013, Allegiant Air announced that it would be returning to Stewart with new flights to St. Petersburg/Clearwater after leaving the airport in 2007. Flights began on October 31, 2013.

In May 2015, the Port Authority announced it was considering changing the airport&#x27;s name to &quot;New York International Airport at Stewart Field.&quot; Its stated rationale was to give the airport &quot;global status,&quot; to ensure that its name appears higher in Internet searches done by travelers abroad, in keeping with the business model followed by many low-cost European airlines of flying into less busy airports further from the cities they serve in order to keep expenses down. Many local residents were cool to the idea, since the Stewart family name has a long history with the airport and the PA had promised it would never change the name when it took over.

On December 5, 2016, General Manager Edmond Harrison announced that Norwegian Air Shuttle planned to set up a base at Stewart for flights to Europe using its Irish subsidiary. The destinations out of Stewart were Belfast–International, Bergen, Dublin, Edinburgh and Shannon. The first international flight departed for Edinburgh on June 15, 2017. On September 14, 2019, Norwegian Air Shuttle ended service.

By 2020, American Eagle had reduced service to one daily flight to Philadelphia. This flight was suspended on October 7, 2020, was resumed on January 5, 2021, and then ended for a final time on September 30, 2021.

On June 9, 2022, Icelandic airline Play began a daily service to Keflavik with connections to other European destinations.

On May 12, 2023, Frontier Airlines announced that their Stewart to Orlando flights would be cut after July 2, 2023, meaning that their presence in the airport would be coming to an end after less than 2 years. Between October 2021 and July 2, 2023, Frontier had commenced and ended flights to Atlanta, Miami, Orlando, Raleigh, and Tampa from SWF. This left Allegiant Air as the only airline in Stewart with domestic destinations.

On November 8, 2023, Breeze Airways announced year-round, twice-weekly service to Orlando, FL beginning February 15, 2024 and seasonal, twice-weekly service to Charleston, SC beginning May 10, 2024. 

On September 17, 2024, Atlantic Airways discontinued service to Stewart.

==Facilities and operations==
New York Stewart International Airport covers 1,552 acres (628 ha) at an elevation of 491 feet (150 m) above mean sea level. It has two asphalt runways and one helipad.

The east–west runway 9–27 is long by wide, but the landing threshold at each end is displaced . Aircraft landing to the east have a landing distance available restriction, an additional reduction in length, making only usable for landing. Runway 27 has available for landing. The full length is available for takeoff in both directions. Runway 9 has an instrument landing system for category I and category II approaches and an ALSF2 approach lighting system. Runway 27 got an instrument landing system in recent years, but without any approach lighting landing minimums for this runway are higher.

The crosswind runway 16–34 is long by wide and each end has GPS-based instrument approaches.

The helipad H1 is asphalt, 40 by 40 feet (12 x 12 m).

==Statistics==
For the 12-month period ending April 30, 2023 the airport had 37,133 aircraft operations, an average of 102 per day: 63% general aviation, 9% air taxi, 17% military, and 11% scheduled commercial. In April 2023, 54 aircraft were then based at this airport: 30 jet, 3 multi-engine, 9 military, 6 single-engine, and 6 helicopter.

Federal Aviation Administration records say the airport had 392,464 passenger boardings (enplanements) in calendar year 2008, 197,655 in 2009 and 201,684 in 2010.

===Annual traffic===
==Ground transportation==
One of the biggest impediments to the use of Stewart by more airlines and passengers has been getting to it. The Drury Lane exit and the access road, International Boulevard, are intended to remedy this.

There have been plans to possibly implement a light rail connection along Broadway in Newburgh that could conceivably go out to Stewart from the ferry connection with the Metro-North passenger line across the Hudson River in Beacon. This project does not appear likely to happen any time soon. As of 2024, the only connection is via a shuttle bus.

In 2006, with construction of the Drury Lane exit underway, Senator Charles Schumer put his weight behind getting federal aid for another long-discussed access improvement: a rail link to the nearby Metro-North Port Jervis Line, to give passengers an express train trip from the airport into the city or Newark Airport via Secaucus Junction. This would entail acquiring property and laying new tracks, to link to the existing line somewhere near the Salisbury Mills station. NEG had had success with the similar Gatwick Express and Midland Mainline rail-air connections in its native Britain. While the federal government has approved the idea, the money has not yet been appropriated.

===Bus transportation===

Starting in June 2017, to support Norwegian&#x27;s growth in making the airport a terminal for visitors to New York City, Coach USA began providing a bus service between the airport and Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan. This service operates under the name &quot;Stewart Airport Express.&quot;

==Accidents and incidents==

* On the morning of August 20, 1987, an Emery Worldwide (operating as Rosenbalm Aviation Flight 74) Douglas DC-8-63 collided with Airborne Express Flight 124, operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-31, on Runway 09/27 in fog. The Emery airplane landed without first receiving clearance while the Airborne Express plane, which had landed just prior to the DC-8, was taxiing on the runway. Both aircraft were repaired and returned to service.
* In the early-morning hours of September 5, 1996, the pilots of Federal Express Flight 1406, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 from Memphis to Boston reported smoke in the cargo compartment and made an emergency landing at Stewart to fight the fire. All five crewmembers escaped with only minor injuries but, despite a prompt effort by the firefighting teams from the ANG base (which also handle the civilian airport&#x27;s fire protection needs) the fire completely consumed the aircraft. Two years later, the National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) traced the source of the fire to an area where some flammables had been stored but could not pin down exactly which had combusted, and faulted the captain for failing to get full information on potentially hazardous materials being shipped.
* Early on the morning of November 21, 2007, a single-engine Cirrus piloted by Brian Early of Wayne, Pennsylvania, got lost in the fog on its approach and crashed in the state forest. He had been dropping off his two passengers, a son and one of his friends, to visit friends of theirs at West Point for Thanksgiving. It took rescuers three hours to find the wreckage using the plane&#x27;s transponder. Early was killed but the younger men survived.
* A small aerobatic plane crashed at the airport August 28, 2015, killing the pilot, who was practicing stunts at Stewart for the two-day New York Air Show that was to be held there starting the following day. The two-seater single-engine fixed-wing Giles G-202, a homebuilt aircraft, assembled from a kit, was completing dramatic climbs and dives as a crowd of mostly journalists watched below. Around 2 p.m., as the pilot went into a dive followed by a steep corkscrew climb, part of the tail appeared to break off, witnesses said and photographs indicated. The plane then crossed the crowd line and spun over the heads of spectators, crashing in a wooded area behind the crowd. The pilot, the plane&#x27;s only occupant, was identified as the plane&#x27;s owner, Andrew Wright of Austin, Texas. The National Transportation Safety Board and the New York State Police were to investigate to determine the crash&#x27;s probable cause, the state police and Federal Aviation Administration said. The NTSB determined that the resin bond between two parts had failed under stress after repeated aileron rolls. Examination of the bond between the horizontal stabilizer and the flange that attached it to the left side of the fuselage revealed that a portion had a poor bond, with the resin inadequately transferring between the two surfaces. The accident was compared to a similar event in France on the same type of aircraft. As a result of these accidents, the Giles&#x27; designer specified several new procedures for aircraft flight handling and inspection.
* On August 21, 2018, a Gulfstream IV carrying musician Post Malone and 15 other people made a successful precautionary landing after two main tires blew during takeoff from Teterboro Airport. After circling Teterboro for nearly an hour, in hopes of making an emergency landing, the plane was diverted to Westfield-Barnes Regional Airport in western Massachusetts where it once again circled the airspace, burning fuel before its descent attempt in order to lighten the plane&#x27;s weight. Once again, the plane was diverted to Stewart International Airport due to Stewart being equipped with longer runways, meaning pilots would not need to engage reverse thrusters or spoilers, thereby lessening the weight on the landing gear and the plane&#x27;s remaining tires. Ultimately, the plane landed on Runway 9, which is nearly double the length of the longest runway at Teterboro Airport.

<text>The Battle of Palmito Ranch, also known as the Battle of Palmito Hill, is considered by some criteria the final battle of the American Civil War. It was fought May 12 and 13, 1865, on the banks of the Rio Grande east of Brownsville, Texas, and a few miles from the seaport of Los Brazos de Santiago, at the southern tip of Texas. The battle took place more than a month after the surrender of the Army of Northern Virginia under Robert E. Lee to Union forces at Appomattox Court House, which had since been communicated to both commanders at Palmito. However, in early May Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith had rejected a proposal from Union Major-General John Pope to surrender Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on the same terms that General Ulysses S. Grant had given to Robert E. Lee. As such Kirby-Smith only officially surrendered all Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865.

Union and Confederate forces in southern Texas had been observing an unofficial truce since the beginning of 1865, but Union Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, newly assigned to command an all-black unit and never having been involved in combat, ordered an attack on a Confederate camp near Fort Brown for unknown reasons. The Union attackers captured a few prisoners, but the following day the attack was repulsed near Palmito Ranch by Colonel John Salmon Ford, and the battle resulted in a Confederate victory. Union forces were surprised by artillery said to have been supplied by the French Army garrison occupying the up-river Mexican town of Matamoros.

Casualty estimates are not dependable, but Union Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana Infantry Regiment is believed to have been the last man killed during the engagement. He could then arguably be considered the last man killed in the American Civil War.
==Background==

After July 27, 1864, the Union Army withdrew most of the 6,500 troops deployed to the lower Rio Grande Valley, including Brownsville, which they had occupied since November 2, 1863. The Confederates were determined to protect their remaining ports, which were essential for cotton sales to Europe and the importation of supplies. The Mexicans across the border tended to side with the Confederates because of the lucrative cotton export trade. Beginning in early 1865, the rival armies in south Texas honored a gentlemen&#x27;s agreement, as they saw no point in further hostilities between them.

Union Major General Lew Wallace proposed a negotiated end of hostilities in Texas to Confederate Brigadier General James E. Slaughter, and met with Slaughter and his subordinate Colonel Ford at Port Isabel on March 11–12, 1865. Despite Slaughter&#x27;s and Ford&#x27;s agreement that combat would prove tragic, Slaughter&#x27;s superior, Confederate Maj. Gen. John G. Walker, rejected the ceasefire in a scathing exchange of letters with Wallace. Despite this, both sides honored a tacit agreement not to advance on the other without prior written notice.

A brigade of 1,900 Union troops commanded by Col. Robert B. Jones of the 34th Indiana Veteran Volunteer Infantry were on blockade duty at the Port of Brazos Santiago at the mouth of the present-day ship channel of the Port of Brownsville. The 400-man 34th Indiana was an experienced regiment that had served in the Vicksburg Campaign and was reorganized in December 1863 as a &quot;Veteran&quot; regiment, composed entirely of veterans from several other regiments whose original enlistments had expired. The 34th Indiana deployed to Los Brazos de Santiago on December 22, 1864, replacing the 91st Illinois Volunteer Infantry, which returned to New Orleans. The brigade also included the 87th and 62nd United States Colored Infantry Regiments (&quot;United States Colored Troops&quot;, or U.S.C.T.) which had a combined strength of about 1,100. Shortly after Gen. Walker rejected the armistice proposal, Col. Jones resigned from the army to return to Indiana. He was replaced in the regiment by Lt. Col. Robert G. Morrison and at Los Brazos de Santiago by Colonel Theodore H. Barrett, commander of the 62nd U.S.C.T.

The 30-year-old Barrett had been an army officer since 1862, but he had yet to see combat. Anxious for higher rank, he volunteered for the newly raised &quot;colored&quot; regiments and was appointed in 1863 as colonel of the 1st Missouri Colored Infantry. In March 1864, the regiment became the 62nd U.S.C.T. Regiment. Barrett contracted malaria in Louisiana that summer, and while he was on convalescent leave, the 62nd was posted to Los Brazos de Santiago. He joined it there in February 1865.

==Reasons for fighting==

Historians still debate why this engagement at Palmito Ranch took place. Lee had surrendered to Grant in Appomattox Court House, Virginia, on April 9, triggering a series of formal surrenders in other places throughout the country. The Confederate and Union officers in Brownsville knew that Lee had surrendered, effectively ending the war. However, the Confederate General commanding the Trans-Mississippi Department, Edmund Kirby-Smith, had not yet surrendered.

Soon after the battle, Barrett&#x27;s detractors claimed he desired &quot;a little battlefield glory before the war ended altogether.&quot; Others have suggested that Barrett needed horses for the 300 unmounted cavalrymen in his brigade and decided to take them from his enemy. Louis J. Schuler, in his 1960 pamphlet &quot;The last battle in the War Between the States, May 13, 1865: Confederate Force of 300 defeats 1,700 Federals near Brownsville, Texas&quot;, asserts that Brig. Gen. Egbert B. Brown of the U.S. Volunteers had ordered the expedition to seize as contraband 2,000 bales of cotton stored in Brownsville and sell them for his own profit, but Brown was not even appointed to command at Brazos Santiago until later in May.

According to historian Jerry Thompson:
:What was at stake was honor and money. With a stubborn reluctance to admit defeat, Ford asserted that the dignity and manhood of his men had to be defended. Having previously proclaimed that he would never capitulate to &quot;a mongrel force of Abolitionists, Negroes, plundering Mexicans, and perfidious renegades&quot;...Ford was not about to surrender to invading black troops... Even more important was the large quantity of Richard King and Mifflin Kenedy&#x27;s cotton stacked in Brownsville waiting to be sent across the river to Matamoros. If Ford did not hold off the invading Federal force, the cotton would be confiscated by the Yankees and thousands of dollars lost.&quot;

==Battle==

Union Lieutenant Colonel David Branson wanted to attack the Confederate encampments commanded by Ford at White and Palmito ranches near Fort Brown outside Brownsville. Branson&#x27;s Union forces consisted of 250 men of the 62nd U.S.C.T. in eight companies and two companies of the (U.S.) 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion. The 300-man 2nd Texas, like the earlier-formed 1st Texas Cavalry Regiment, was composed largely of Texans of Mexican origin who remained loyal to the United States. They moved from Brazos Santiago to the mainland. At first Branson&#x27;s expedition was successful, capturing three prisoners and some supplies, although it failed to achieve the desired surprise. During the afternoon, Confederate forces under Captain William N. Robinson counterattacked with less than 100 cavalry, driving Branson back to White&#x27;s Ranch, where the fighting stopped for the night. Both sides sent for reinforcements; Ford arrived with six French guns and the remainder of his cavalry force (for a total of 300 men), while Barrett came with 200 troops of the 34th Indiana in nine under-strength companies.

The next day, Barrett started advancing westward, passing a half-mile to the west of Palmito Ranch, with skirmishers from the 34th Indiana deployed in advance. Ford attacked Barrett&#x27;s force as it was skirmishing with an advance Confederate force along the Rio Grande about 4 p.m. He sent a couple of companies with artillery to attack the Union right flank and the remainder of his force into a frontal attack. After some confusion and fierce fighting, the Union forces retreated toward Boca Chica. Barrett attempted to form a rearguard, but Confederate artillery prevented him from rallying a force large enough to do so. During the retreat, which lasted until 14 May, 50 members of the 34th Indiana&#x27;s rearguard company, 30 stragglers, and 20 of the dismounted cavalry were surrounded in a bend of the Rio Grande and captured. The battle is recorded as a Confederate victory.
Fighting in the battle involved Caucasian, African-American, Hispanic, and Native American troops. Reports of shots from the Mexican side, the sounding of a warning to the Confederates of the Union approach, the crossing of Imperial cavalry into Texas, and the participation by several among Ford&#x27;s troops are unverified, despite many witnesses reporting shooting from the Mexican shore.

In Barrett&#x27;s official report of August 10, 1865, he reported 115 Union casualties: one killed, nine wounded, and 105 captured. Confederate casualties were reported as five or six wounded, with none killed. Historian and Ford biographer Stephen B. Oates, however, concludes that Union deaths were much higher, probably around 30, many of whom drowned in the Rio Grande or were attacked by French border guards on the Mexican side. He likewise estimated Confederate casualties at approximately the same number.

Using court-martial testimony and post returns from Brazos Santiago, historian Jerry D. Thompson of Texas A&amp;M International University determined that:
* the 62nd U.S.C.T. incurred two killed and four wounded;
* the 34th Indiana had one killed, one wounded, and 79 captured; and
* the 2nd Texas Cavalry Battalion had one killed, seven wounded, and 22 captured,
* totaling four killed, 12 wounded, and 101 captured.

Private John J. Williams of the 34th Indiana was the last fatality during the Battle at Palmito Ranch, likely making him the final combat death of the entire war.

==Aftermath==
President Jefferson Davis was captured and imprisoned on May 10, 1865, marking the effective end of the Confederate government. In addition, that day United States President Andrew Johnson declared &quot;armed resistance ...virtually at an end.&quot; Historian James McPherson joins other historians in concluding that the war ended when the Confederate government ended.

Confederate General Edmund Kirby Smith officially surrendered all Confederate forces in the Trans-Mississippi Department on June 2, 1865, except those under the command of Brigadier General Chief Stand Watie in the Indian Territory. Stand Watie, of the 1st Cherokee Mounted Rifles, on June 23, 1865, became the last Confederate general to surrender his forces, in Doaksville, Indian Territory. On that same day, United States President Andrew Johnson ended the Union blockade of the Southern states.
Many senior Confederate commanders in Texas (including Smith, Walker, Slaughter, and Ford) and many troops with their equipment fled across the border to Mexico. Wanting to resist capture, they may also have intended to ally with French Imperial forces, or with Mexican forces under deposed President Benito Juárez.

The Military Division of the Southwest (after June 27 the Division of the Gulf), commanded by Maj. Gen. Phillip H. Sheridan, occupied Texas between June and August. Consisting of the IV Corps, XIII Corps, the African-American XXV Corps, and two 4,000-man cavalry divisions commanded by Brig. Gen. Wesley Merritt and Maj. Gen. George A. Custer, it aggregated a 50,000-man force on the Gulf Coast and along the Rio Grande to pressure the French intervention in Mexico and garrison the Reconstruction Department of Texas.

In July 1865, Barrett proffered charges of disobedience of orders, neglect of duty, abandoning his colors, and conduct prejudicial to good order and military discipline against Morrison for actions in the battle, resulting in the latter&#x27;s court martial. Confederate Col. Ford, who had returned from Mexico at the request of Union Gen. Frederick Steele to act as parole commissioner for disbanding Confederate forces, appeared as a defense witness and assisted in absolving Morrison of responsibility for the defeat at Palmito Ranch.

The history of this engagement provides accounts of the roles of Hispanic Confederate veterans and of the treatment by Confederates in South Texas of black prisoners of war. Hispanic Confederates served at Fort Brown in Brownsville and on the field of Palmito Ranch. Col. Santos Benavides, who was the highest-ranking Hispanic in either army, led between 100 and 150 Hispanic soldiers in the Brownsville Campaign in May 1865.

When Colonel Ford surrendered his command following the campaign of Palmito Ranch, he urged his men to honor their paroles. He insisted that &quot;The negro had a right to vote.&quot;

==&quot;Last battle of the Civil War&quot;==

Although officially most historians say this was the last land action fought between the North and the South, some sources suggest that the battle on May 19, 1865, of Hobdy&#x27;s Bridge, located near Eufaula, Alabama, was the last skirmish between the two forces. Union records show that the last Northern soldier killed in combat during the war was Corporal John W. Skinner in this action. Three others were wounded, also from the same unit, Company C, 1st Florida U.S. Cavalry.

Historian Richard Gardiner stated in 2013 that on May 10, 1865:
:A confrontation took place at Palmetto Ranch. There was no Confederacy in existence when the &quot;battle&quot; occurred. The ex-Confederates at Palmetto Ranch were aware that Lee had surrendered and that the war was over. What happened in Texas can only be understood as a &quot;post-war&quot; encounter between Federals and ex-Confederate &quot;outlaws.&quot;

The Confederates won this engagement, but as there was no organized command structure, there has been controversy about the Union casualties. In 1896 these same men had their pensions cut, although this was quickly rectified by an appeal to the commissioner of pensions. The assistant secretary to the commissioner overturned the pension cut, legally ruling the men as the last Union casualties of the war.

On April 2, 1866, President Johnson declared the insurrection at an end, except in Texas. There a technicality concerning incomplete formation of a new state government prevented declaring the insurrection over. Johnson declared the insurrection at an end in Texas and throughout the United States on August 20, 1866.

==Battlefield==

The area has remained relatively unchanged, with the marshy, windswept prairies almost the same as they were in 1865. The site is more than in size, and was designated as a National Historic Landmark in 1997. The area is indicated by a large highway marker telling the history of the engagement, installed on the &quot;Boca Chica Highway&quot; (Texas State Highway 4) near where Palmito Ranch originally stood. The Civil War Trust (a division of the American Battlefield Trust) and its partners have acquired and preserved of the battlefield.

<doc id="249712" wikidata="Q939303" url="?curid=249712" title="Mummichog">
<text>The mummichog (Fundulus heteroclitus) is a small killifish found along the Atlantic coast of the United States and Canada. Also known as Atlantic killifish, mummies, gudgeons, and mud minnows, these fish inhabit brackish and coastal waters including estuaries and salt marshes. The species is noted for its hardiness and ability to tolerate highly variable salinity, temperature fluctuations from , very low oxygen levels (down to 1 mg/L), and heavily polluted ecosystems. As a result, the mummichog is a popular research subject in embryological, physiological, and toxicological studies. It is also the first fish ever sent to space, aboard Skylab in 1973.

==Taxonomy==
The genus name &quot;Fundulus&quot; comes from &quot;&quot;, meaning bottom, from the fish&#x27;s habit of swimming near muddy bottoms. The species name &quot;heteroclitus&quot; means irregular or unusual. The type specimen was first described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766, from near Charleston, South Carolina. Other scientific names now considered synonyms for this species include &quot;Cobitis heteroclita&quot;, &quot;Fundulus fasciatus&quot;, &quot;Fundulus pisculentus&quot;, and &quot;Fundulus nigrofasciatus&quot;. The mummichog belongs to the order Cyprinodontiformes, and the family Fundulidae. There are two subspecies: &quot;F. h. heteroclitus&quot; (Linnaeus, 1766), in the south and &quot;F. h. macrolepidotus&quot; (Walbaum, 1792) in the north. As &quot;F. mudfish&quot; this species was designated the type species of &quot;Fundulus&quot; when Lacépède created the genus in 1803.

The name mummichog is derived from a Narragansett term meaning &quot;going in crowds&quot;, which reflects the mummichog&#x27;s strong shoaling tendency. Colloquial names include mummy, killie, kelley, chub, salt water minnow, mud minnow, mud dabbler, marsh minnow, brackish water chub, gudgeon, and common killifish. Some of these terms may lead to confusion: the term minnow should be reserved for species of the family Cyprinidae, the mudminnows are members of the family Umbridae, and the name gudgeon is used for various bottom-dwelling species of cyprinid, eleotrid, and ptereleotrid fishes, none of which belongs to the same family as the fundulid mummichog.

==Description==

The body of the mummichog is elongate but thick, with a deep caudal peduncle. Usual length is but a maximum length of up to is possible. The mouth is upturned and the lower jaw protrudes when the mouth is closed. Pectoral and tail fins are round. Mummichogs have 10–13 dorsal fin rays, 9–12 anal fin rays and 16–20 pectoral fin rays. Males have larger dorsal and anal fins than females. There is no lateral line on the body, but lateral line pores are present on the head. The colour is variable (and may even change in shade within the same individual when placed near different backgrounds) but is generally olive-brown or olive-green. There can be vertical bars on the sides that are thin, wavy, and silvery. Colors are more intense in males during the reproductive season, as they become dark olive-green on the back, steel-blue on the sides with about 15 silvery bars, and yellow or orange-yellow on the underside; the dorsal fin is mottled and a small eyespot may be present near the rear edge. Females tend to be paler, without bars or the intense yellow on the belly, and their dorsal fin is uniformly coloured.

Adults of the two subspecies can be distinguished based on slight morphological and genomic differences. Further, eggs of the northern subspecies have filaments (adhesive chorionic fibrils) that eggs of the southern subspecies lack. While the northern subspecies deposits eggs in the sand, the southern subspecies often deposits eggs inside empty mussel shells.

The mummichog is very similar to the banded killifish, &quot;Fundulus diaphanus&quot;, and indeed the two species have been known to interbreed. The two species may overlap in their choice of habitat, but in general the banded killifish is more commonly found in freshwater, which is not the case for the mummichog. The banded killifish tends to have thin dark bars on a light side, whereas in the mummichog the bars are thin and light on a dark side. Internally, the banded killifish has 4–7 gill rakers, as opposed to 8–12 in the mummichog.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species ranges along the Atlantic coast of North America, from Gaspé Peninsula, Anticosti Island and Port au Port Bay in the north to northeastern Florida in the south. It is present on Sable Island, southeast of the closest point of mainland Nova Scotia in the Atlantic Ocean. The approximate geographical division between the two subspecies lies in New Jersey, Delaware and Virginia.

Introduced populations have become established on the Atlantic coast of Portugal and southwestern Spain, starting in the 1970s and some have now reached the western Mediterranean basin. There may also be introduced populations in Hawaii and the Philippines. As bait fish, mummichogs are sometimes released in freshwater habitats, where they can survive, and there have been reports of individuals in New Hampshire ponds, as well as the upper Ohio River and Beaver River.

The mummichog is a common fish in coastal habitats such as salt marshes, muddy creeks, tidal channels, brackish estuaries, eelgrass or cordgrass beds, and sheltered shorelines. It can be found within coastal rivers but seldom beyond the head of tide. A few landlocked populations may exist in freshwater lakes close to shore, for example on Digby Neck, Nova Scotia.

==Diet==
Mummichogs are agastric omnivores. Analyses of their gut contents have found diatoms, amphipods and other crustaceans, molluscs, fish eggs (including their own species), very small fish, insect larvae, and bits of eelgrass.

==Physiology==
This fish is well known for its ability to withstand a variety of environmental conditions. They can survive temperatures between ; even within the same tidal cycle they can tolerate rapid temperature changes from . They are able to survive this vast temperature range by altering their metabolic rates at high and low temperatures. This is partly achieved by varying the isoenzyme of the lactate dehydrogenase (Ldh-B) enzyme expressed in warm or cold waters. These two versions of the enzyme allow for faster catalytic function and metabolism depending on if the fish is in northern, colder waters or southern, warmer waters. Based on genetic studies, the enzymes serum esterase (SERE) and malate dehydrogenase (MDH) also appear to play an important role in mummichog temperature control.

They are also among fish species most tolerant of salinity changes (euryhaline). Mummichog larvae can grow in salinities ranging from 0.4 to 100 parts per thousand, the latter being about three times the normal salinity of seawater. Adult mummichogs tolerate low oxygen levels down to 1 mg/L, at which they resort to aquatic surface respiration (breathing in the surface layer of water, richer in oxygen because of contact with air) to survive. They can even survive for a few hours in moist air outside of water, breathing air directly.

Populations have developed resistance to methylmercury, kepone, dioxins, polychlorinated biphenyl, and polyaromatic hydrocarbons. One study has looked at the genomic variation exhibited by mummichogs populations living in Newark Bay, New Bedford Harbor, and the Elizabeth River (Virginia) (in some areas heavily polluted with polychlorinated biphenyls and creosote, a complex mixture containing dioxin-like chemicals) and has found that about 20% of their genes were modified as compared to populations living in clean sites.

==Behavior==
Mummichogs live in dense shoals that can include several hundred individuals.

During cold winter months in the northern parts of their range, mummichogs move to upstream tidal pools, where they burrow into the mud at depths up to to overwinter. They can also bury themselves in mud if they are caught in a drying tidal pool between spring tides. Alternatively, they can travel short distances on land to get back to the sea.

In the laboratory, mummichogs have yielded clear examples of free-running circadian rhythms, in both body colour and swimming activity. For the latter, clear rhythms were obtained in single individuals as well as in groups of 5 or 25 individuals. Evidence of free-running semi-lunar rhythms have also been obtained in mummichogs: in constant laboratory conditions, egg production peaked every 14.8 days for up to 5 months.

===Reproduction===
Spawning takes place from spring through fall. In the southernmost populations, up to eight spawnings are possible in a season. Spawning takes place most often at high tide and when the moon is new or full. Maximal spawning occurs when high spring tides coincide with night, though spawning during the day remains possible.

During courtship, males may pursue females, and females may attract males by turning on their sides near the bottom and flicking their tails. A male and female may swim together for a while, after which the male crowds the female against a rock or a plant and clasps her: the male&#x27;s larger dorsal and anal fins curve around the female&#x27;s body. Fingerlike projections that develop on the male&#x27;s scales behind and below the dorsal fin may help the male maintain contact with the female. The pair quivers vigorously and eggs and sperm are released.

The eggs are pale yellow, about in diameter, and strongly adhesive. During a spawning event, a female can deposit up to 740 eggs in separate clutches of 10 to 300 eggs at a time. The eggs adhere to plants, algal mats, empty mussel shells, sand, or mud at sites that are reached by water only at high spring tides. Eggs therefore develop while exposed to moist air, and they hatch when the next high spring tides reach them. The eggs cannot hatch in air, nor can they do so in moving water; hatching is initiated by a lack of oxygen, something that can happen in the boundary layer of relatively still water surrounding the metabolically active egg at high tide, but not in air or in moving water.

As opposed to their northern counterparts, the southern subspecies have eggs that lack filaments (adhesive chorionic fibrils) and they often deposit those eggs inside empty mussel shells. The two subspecies are also distinguished based on slight morphological and genomic differences.

Most mummichogs become sexually mature when two years old, around in length. Normal lifespan is four years.

==Parasites==

Mummichogs are hosts to a parasitic fluke, &quot;Homalometron pallidum&quot;, which has a complex lifecycle involving the aquatic snail, &quot;Ecrobia truncata&quot;. Other parasite species reported in mummichogs include 10 protozoans, eight trematodes, one nematode, two acanthocephalans, and two crustaceans. A study in New Jersey found that mummichogs heavily infested with the digenean gill parasite &quot;Ascocotyle phagicola&quot;, spent more time near the surface and exhibited conspicuous behaviors such as jerking, an example of a parasite affecting the behavior of its host in a way beneficial to the parasite, as conspicuous behaviors near the surface make the fish more likely to be noticed by predatory wading birds, the next host in the parasite&#x27;s life cycle.

==Interest to humans==
Mummichogs readily eat mosquito larvae and attempts have been made to use them as biocontrol agents of mosquito populations.

===Fishing===
Mummichogs are sold as bait in sport fisheries for marine species such as summer flounder and bluefish, or even sometimes for freshwater species. They are the most popular baitfish species in the Northeast of America and traditionally when used as bait they were lip hooked and then dressed with a piece of squid.

===Scientific utility===

Mummichogs are considered an important environmental model organism because of their ability to tolerate various extremes of chemical (pollution, etc.) and physical (temperature, salinity, oxygen, etc.) conditions. They are relatively abundant in nature and can be easily captured, transported and reared in laboratory facilities. They are commonly used in scientific studies of stress biology, thermal physiology and toxicology, and have also been studied in the contexts of evolutionary biology, developmental biology, endocrinology, cancer biology, and chronobiology (study of circadian rhythms). With the successful sequencing and assembly of the full killifish genome, they serve as a premier scientific model for studying biochemical and physiological responses to varying environmental conditions.

Their remarkable ability to tolerate various extremes of temperature and salinity has made them popular subjects in scientific studies of toxicology. For decades the killifish has been a useful laboratory model for toxicological studies that include exposures to single chemicals, chemical mixtures, and complex contaminated media. It is sometimes the only fish species found in severely polluted and oxygen-deprived waterways, such as the Elizabeth River in Virginia and, in New Jersey, the Hackensack River and the Arthur Kill. A 2008 Virginia Institute of Marine Science report stated that 38% of mummichogs from Elizabeth River had cancerous lesions, and &quot;more than half had pre-cancerous lesions. That was largely due to high levels of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons&quot;.

Killifish eggs are used in developmental studies and when teaching embryology because the eyes, the beating heart, and the different stages of ontogenesis can be easily examined. Embryos are also extremely durable and easy to manipulate in the laboratory.

Mummichogs were the first fish sent to space. In 1973 a couple of them were flown in a plastic bag aquarium aboard Skylab, during the Skylab 3 mission. In the absence of gravity the fish at first exhibited an unusual swimming behavior: they constantly pitched forward and therefore described tight circles. However, by day 22 of the mission they swam normally. Fifty eggs at an advanced stage of development had also been taken on board, and 48 of them hatched during the flight. The hatchlings swam normally. More experiments with mummichogs in space followed as part of the Apollo-Soyuz Test Project and as part of a biological package aboard the Bion 3/Kosmos 782 satellite.

<doc id="249713" wikidata="Q359945" url="?curid=249713" title="Melito of Sardis">
<text>Melito of Sardis ( &quot;Melítōn Sárdeōn&quot;; died ) was the bishop of Sardis near Smyrna in western Anatolia, and who held a foremost place among the early Christian bishops in Asia due to his personal influence and his literary works, most of which have been lost. What has been recovered, however, has provided a great insight into Christianity during the second century. Jerome, speaking of the Old Testament canon established by Melito, quotes Tertullian to the effect that he was esteemed as a prophet by many of the faithful. This work by Tertullian has been lost, but Jerome quotes sections regarding Melito for the high regard in which he was held at that time. Melito is remembered for his work on developing the first Old Testament Canon. Though it cannot be determined what date he was elevated to the episcopacy, it is probable that he was bishop during the controversy that arose at Laodicea in regard to the observance of Easter, a controversy that led to his writing his most famous work, an Apology for Christianity to Marcus Aurelius. Little is known of his life outside the works which were quoted or had been read by Clement of Alexandria, Origen, and Eusebius.

A letter of Polycrates of Ephesus to Pope Victor dated about 194 (Eusebius, Church History V.24) states that &quot;Melito the eunuch [this is interpreted &quot;the virgin&quot; by Rufinus in his translation of Eusebius], whose whole walk was in the Holy Spirit&quot;, was buried at Sardis. His feast day is celebrated on April 1.

==Jewish and Hellenistic roots==
Polycrates of Ephesus, a notable bishop of the time, was a contemporary of Melito, and in one of his letters preserved by Eusebius, Polycrates describes Melito as having lived fully in the Spirit. Jewish by birth, Melito lived in an atmosphere where Christianity bore a strong Jewish imprint. Though Melito&#x27;s extant writings never quote directly from the New Testament corpus, it is thought that his orientation represents the Johannine tradition, and that his theological understanding of Christ often mirrored that of John. However, like most of his contemporaries, Melito was fully immersed in Greek culture. This Johannine tradition led Melito to consider the Gospel of John as the chronological timeline of Jesus&#x27;s life and death. This in turn led to Melito&#x27;s standpoint on the proper date of Easter discussed in &quot;Peri Pascha&quot;. For him, the date was the 14th of Nisan. He is often described, based on a passage in Eusebius, as a Quartodecimanist.

Formerly the capital of the Kingdom of Lydia, Sardis underwent a process of Hellenization due to the influence of Alexander the Great, and it had thus became a thoroughly Greek city long before Melito was born. Trained in the art of rhetorical argumentation, Melito is believed to have been greatly influenced by two Stoic philosophers in particular, namely, Cleanthes and Poseidonius. Melito was also proficient in the allegorical interpretation of Homer, a legacy of his being schooled by sophists. It is highly likely that his background in Stoicism fed into his writing and how he interpreted past events and figures of religious significance such as Moses and the Exodus. Both his Jewish and his Stoic background affected his opinion that the Christian Passover, celebrated during Holy Week, should be celebrated at the same time as the Jewish Passover. His belief in the Old Covenant being fulfilled in Jesus Christ also led to his opinion regarding the date of Easter.

==&quot;Peri Pascha&quot;==

Written during the second century AD, and only coming to light within the modern world due to the efforts of Campbell Bonner in 1940, some have argued that &quot;Peri Pascha&quot; (&quot;On the Passover&quot;) is not a homily, but is a liturgy based on the haggadah, which is a retelling of the works of God at Passover. The Quartodeciman celebration mainly being a commemoration of Christ&#x27;s passion and death, Melito stood by the belief that Christ died on the evening of the 14th, when the Passover meal was being prepared. F. L. Cross states that Melito&#x27;s treatise on Pascha is “the most important addition to Patristic literature in the present century”. Aside from the liturgical function of the &quot;Peri Pascha&quot;, this early Christian document has traditionally been perceived as a somewhat reliable indicator concerning how early Christians felt toward Judaism in general. The &quot;Peri Pascha&quot; provides an accurate description of Christian feelings towards Jews at the time and their opinion of Judaism. The Jewish people are explicitly blamed for killing Christ. Melito does not blame Pontius Pilate for the crucifixion of Jesus Christ, and his presentation helped to feed and establish the anti-Jewish tropes that persist to this day. Melito is widely remembered for his supersessionism, a belief that the Jewish people fail to fulfill the Old Covenant due to their lack of belief in Jesus Christ. However, he was not satisfied with dismissing Judaism as misguided, and compared Jewish practice to a first draft that, in the wake of Christianity, ought to be &quot;destroyed&quot; or &quot;dissolved.&quot; He closes with the fervid accusation &quot;you smashed the Lord to the ground, you were razed to the ground. And you lie dead, while he rose from the dead.

== Quartodeciman controversy==
Attracting the attention of persons such as Epiphanius, Chrysostom, and Pseudo-Hippolytus, Quartodeciman practices have encouraged many to deeply ponder questions pertaining to the duration of the period of fasting, and when it should end within the celebration of any Christian Passover. Another question which bothered many individuals was whether everyone ought to uniformly observe Easter on the same day. Melito thought that the Christian Passover should be on the 14th of Nisan, but the Council of Nicaea determined that Jesus Christ&#x27;s resurrection from the dead should always be celebrated on a Sunday. Uniformity in church practice was thus the primary drive behind this initiative. Known for following a Johannine chronology, and for believing in a paschal lamb typology, Quartodeciman thought is constituted as such. One of the issues raised is that Quartodeciman thought is the idea that Christian Passover would be celebrated at the same time as Jewish Passover. Ultimately the Council of Nicea decided otherwise and agreed that it would always be on a Sunday.

==Apology to Marcus Aurelius==
During the controversy in Laodicea over the observance of Easter, Melito presented an Apology for Christianity to Marcus Aurelius, according to Eusebius, in his Chronicon, during the years 169–170 AD. A Syriac translation of this apology was rediscovered and placed in a British museum where it was translated into English by Cureton. In this apology, Melito describes Christianity as a philosophy that had originated among the barbarians, but had attained to a flourishing status under the Roman Empire. Melito asks the emperor to rethink the accusations against the Christians and to renounce the edict against them. Melito argues that Christianity had in no way weakened the empire which continued to grow despite the presence of Christianity. Complaining about how the godly are being persecuted and harassed by new decrees, Christians are openly robbed and plundered by those who are taking advantage of the said ordinances. The suffering of Christians at the time in regard to these decrees was mostly of property and taxations while not as much physical suffering. Certainly Christians were persecuted physically as well but in terms of the decrees they were openly robbed and considered to be incestuous and take part in ritualistic acts such as eating children. Melito aimed to dispel the suffering of the Christian people and to change the Greek opinion of them. Demonstrating how Christian thought first flourished among the Gentiles, and how it has benefited the empire, Melito tried to convince the emperor to rethink his current policies since Christianity only brought greatness and success to Rome. Reminding the emperor of the virtuous conduct of Hadrian, Melito called for an end to all violence toward the growing Christian communities within the empire.

==Melito&#x27;s high Christology==
Emphasizing, like John, the unity of Christ and the Father, Melito declared that Christ is at once God and a perfect man. Having two essences while being one and the same, his godhead was demonstrated by way of all of the signs and miracles he performed after being baptized. Successfully managing to hide his divinity from the world before that central event occurred with John the Baptist, Jesus felt the pangs of hunger just like everyone else. Writing against Marcion, Melito focused on Christ&#x27;s divinity and humanity in order to counter the claim that Jesus was simply and uniquely divine; having no material counterpart. Melito does not anthropomorphize the divine nature of Christ and keeps the attributes of the divine nature and the human nature wholly separate. While he describes the attributes of each nature separately, he also speaks of the two natures of Christ combined. The form of speech used is that of two natures in one Christ. According to Melito, Jesus Christ was both entirely human and entirely divine.

==Old Testament canon==

Melito gave the first Christian list of the canon in the Old Testament. In his canon he excludes the Book of Esther, Book of Nehemiah and all the Apocrypha. It is argued that Esdras is referring to another book which isn&#x27;t the Book of Ezra, and Lamentations (that is not seperately named in the canon) is left out. The standard reading tells us that Esdras is just Ezra, which would have likely included Nehemiah, and that Lamentations would have been included as part of the mentioning of Jeremiah. There is also debate on whether he includes Wisdom of Solomon. Scholars have argued that this is an alternative name for the  Book of Proverbs however Eusebius mentions it as a separate book, so the standard reading would conclude that the Wisdom of Solomon is included in Melito&#x27;s canon. Around 170 after traveling to The Levant, and probably visiting the library at Caesarea Maritima, Melito compiled the earliest known Christian canon of the Old Testament, a term he coined. A passage cited by Eusebius contains Melito&#x27;s famous canon of the Old Testament. In &quot;Eklogai&quot;, six books of extracts from the Law and the Prophets concerning Christ and the Christian faith, Melito presented elaborate parallels between the Old Testament or Old Covenant, which he likened to the form or mold, and the New Testament or New Covenant, which he likened to the truth that broke the mold.

==Millennialism==
It is thought by some that Melito, following the likes of Irenaeus, was a chiliast who expected a millennial reign of Christ on Earth. This impression is sometimes based upon information conveyed by Jerome and Gennadius. These ancient sources, however, are far from conclusive on Melito&#x27;s position. Jerome nowhere mentions Melito in connection with millennialism, even if at &quot;Comm. on Ezek.&quot; 36 he does mention Tertullian, Lactantius, Victorinus of Petovium, Irenaeus, and Apollinaris of Laodicea as being chiliasts. Nor does Jerome suggest that Melito was a chiliast in his description of Melito&#x27;s life and work in &quot;On Virtuous Men&quot; 24. The same is true for the source on which Jerome likely draws for his information on Melito: Eusebius of Caesarea&#x27;s &quot;Church History&quot; 4.26.2–4. Gennadius (&quot;De Dogm. Eccl.,&quot; Ch. 52) likely does not refer to Melito of Sardis at all in his reference to the Meletians but rather to Meletius of Lycopolis, who together with his followers may have been chiliasts.

==Death and legacy==
In regard to the death of Melito, there is not much information preserved or recorded. Polycrates of Ephesus, in a letter addressed to Pope Victor (A.D. 196) preserved in Eusebius’ history, says, “What shall I say of Melito, whose actions&#x27; were all guided by the operations of the Holy Spirit? Who was interred at Sardis, where he waits the resurrection and the judgement?&quot;. From this it may be deduced that at some point prior to the date of this letter, Melito he had died at Sardis, the latter being the place of his interment.
 Melito&#x27;s reputation as a writer remained strong into the Middle Ages: numerous works were pseudepigraphically ascribed to him. Melito was especially skilled in the literature of the Old Testament, and was one of the most prolific authors of his time. Eusebius furnished a list of Melito&#x27;s works. While many of these works are lost, the testimony of the fathers remains to inform us how highly they were viewed. Eusebius presents some fragments of Melito&#x27;s works and some others are found in the works of different writers. Fragments&#x27; of his works found preserved in a Syriac translation are now stored in the library of the British Museum. Cureton has translated some and others have been published in Kitto&#x27;s Journal of Sacred Literature, vol 15. Due to Melito&#x27;s reputation, many works are falsely attributed to him due to the lack of recorded literature surrounding him.

<text>The Seaview is a golf club and resort on the East Coast of the United States, located in Galloway Township, New Jersey, north of nearby Atlantic City. The club hosted the ShopRite LPGA Classic in 1986-87, from 1998-2006 and again starting in 2010. During World War II, it hosted the PGA Championship in 1942, Sam Snead&#x27;s first major title. The course also cooperates with Rutgers University on testing of new turf breeds and natural control of mosquitoes.

The resort has two golf courses, Bay and Pines, and a 300-room hotel with tennis courts, swimming pools, two mini basketball courts, jogging trails, a fitness center, and a spa.

On September 1, 2010, The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey took ownership of the hotel and the Bay course.

On August 1, 2018, it was announced that The Richard Stockton College of New Jersey sold the club to Florida-based KDG Capital LLC for $21 million.

==History==
The golf club dates from 1914, when public utility magnate Clarence H. Geist founded the Seaview Country Club. The original golf course, known today as the Bay Course, was partially designed by Hugh Wilson (who also designed the two courses at Merion Golf Club). In 1915, Donald Ross completed the course by adding the sand bunkers. In 1998, the course was restored by Bob Cupp Jr. to be close to the original design. Today the course plays as a par 71, 
, or from the back tees. In 2006, the hole numbers were rearranged to improve logistics.

In 1929, the club opened a nine-hole course designed by William S. Flynn and Howard C. Toomey. A second nine holes were built by Flynn disciple William Gordon in 1957, and the rearranged layout became known as the Pines Course. Three holes were removed in 1990 to make room for a practice facility, with replacements designed by Al Janis. Today, the course is from the back tees and is also a par 71.
In 1984, the Marriott Corporation bought the club, and turned it into a resort open to the public. Marriott sold the property to LaSalle Hotel Properties in 1998, but continued to manage it until 2009. Marriott Vacation Club owns the adjacent Fairway Villas vacation condominium complex and the Pines course, but both courses and recreational facilities are seamlessly open to guests from the hotel and the vacation club. Dolce Hotels and Resorts took over management of the hotel and Troon Golf was retained to manage the golf courses.

In 2009, Seaview was honored by &quot;Golfweek&quot; magazine as one of the “Best Courses You Can Play” in New Jersey, and by &quot;Golf World&quot; magazine with a 2009 Readers&#x27; Choice Award.

In July 2010, it was reported that the Richard Stockton College of New Jersey was negotiating with LaSalle Hotel Properties regarding the possible purchase of the hotel. On September 1, 2010, Stockton College finalized the deal for 20 million.

===Tournaments===
The Seaview Country Club hosted the 1942 PGA Championship, then a match play event. Sam Snead won the final match at 2 &amp; 1 over Jim Turnesa to claim the first of his seven major championships. He closed out the match by holing a chip shot for birdie on the 35th hole. A composite course was used for the event, using the front nine of the Bay Course coupled with the nine holes designed by Flynn.

In 1986, the Bay Course hosted the inaugural Atlantic City Classic, an LPGA Tour event, and did so again the following year. The tournament, by then named the ShopRite LPGA Classic, returned in 1998 and remained at the club through 2006, and was revived as an annual event in 2010.

<text>Church Crookham is a large suburban village and civil parish, contiguous with the town of Fleet, in northeast Hampshire, England. It is west-southwest of London. Formerly a separate village, it figures as a southern suburb of Fleet.

==History==

Crookham (in many of the earliest records, Crokeham) dates back at least as far as the Domesday Book, though Church Crookham, including Crookham Village (its west part in traditional terms), was a hamlet until the first and only Anglican church was built in 1840. This is dedicated to Christ and for which Church Crookham is named and to reflect all of the local land&#x27;s ecclesiastical freehold farms and manors until the dissolution of the monasteries, as there is a Crookham in Berkshire and in Northumberland. In the 13th to 14th centuries, the De Burgh family held notable lands in Crookham of (under) the Prior and Convent of Saint Swithun, Winchester. During this time, one of the family saw a confirmation (re-grant) and was bailiff of the priory, in 1257. One of his grandsons passed all the lands of his mother in the &quot;hamlets&quot; of &quot;Crookham&quot; and &quot;Velmeads&quot; to another such grandson.

The parent sprawling parish of Crondall (in Crondall Hundred) was mostly rural at this time, with the 1831 edition of Samuel Lewis&#x27;s &quot;Topographical Dictionary of England&quot;, which used the census returns to assess that Crookham had 623 inhabitants and not even mentioning the (at the time) much smaller Fleet. Other than Crondall tithing, this parish in 1800 consisted of four other tithings, Crookham (otherwise Church Crookham), Ewshot, Swanthorpe, and portions of Dippenhall (partly in Surrey, in Farnham Hundred). The soil is sandy here and in Ewshot, but is chalky in Swanthorpe and has some clay in other tithings.

Crookham was made its own church parish in 1842; Fleet was (before in this parish) in 1863. The same zones gained civil parishes counterpart statuses in 1894. The canal has served as the traditional divide of the two since Fleet was separated into its own church parish. In the centre west of Church Crookham is the Anglican church that continues to serve both the suburb and the older Crookham Village to the west. The ecclesiastical parish is roughly a broad rectangle with the church at the true centre.

Forestry was significant in eastern Crookham with several &#x27;old copse enclosures&#x27; and areas of &#x27;woodland&#x27;. A few of the neediest poor were housed in almshouses, by request of Isabelle Cottrell of Bath.

In 1903, the noted large homes and their owner-occupiers were:
In 1903, the commercial crops were corn and root vegetables. Defunct hop farming is noted. This saw a revival ending in 1974 (see Crookham Village).

===The Second World War===

Church Crookham lies on GHQ Line – the most important of a number of fortified stop lines constructed as a part of British anti-invasion preparations of World War II – and was at one of the most heavily fortified sections of that line.

===Notable large newer neighbourhoods===
In Crookham (a term only used in historic studies and as a local shorthand) southwest of Church Crookham and southeast of Crookham Village is Zebon Copse, over two hundred homes built in the late 1980s. A much larger development followed in the early 2010s at Crookham Park, on the former Queen Elizabeth Barracks site.

==Economy==
===Past notable employers and innovators===
Vertu mobile phones were made at its Crookham headquarters until the business folded in 2014. The head office of Ferranti Thomson Sonar Systems was on the Redfields Industrial Estate until 2004.

====Tobacco plantation and growers association====
Church Crookham hosted Britain&#x27;s only commercially successful tobacco plantation, which produced among other brands &quot;Blue Pryor&quot; cigarettes and pipe tobacco. Whole-process growing and manufacturing ended in 1938.

Redfields hosted the British Pioneer Tobacco Growers Association (BPTGA) after World War II. Tobacco was grown there, cured and a commercial brand &#x27;Trowards Rayon D&#x27;or&#x27; was produced alongside the main purpose of supplying plants to members, curing and shredding their leaves then returning for their smoking. Charles Baggs served as the general manager, and Admiral Sir Clement Moody was among members. A BBC film was made during the 1950s entitled &quot;Tobacco Road&quot;, which featured the Redfields site and their site in nearby Crondall. The BPTGA closed after the death of owner Troward but Baggs supplied plants and cure the members&#x27; product some time after. The BPTGA employed twenty to thirty local staff. The site is now Redfields Garden Centre, save for Redfields House, which is now part of the buildings of St Nicholas&#x27; School.

===Present notable employers and innovators===
HSES Group&#x27;s headquarters are in the suburb.

==Politics and administration==

As currently drawn for the purpose of electing particular councillors to the District Council, approximately Church Crookham constitutes two (Crookham East, and Crookham West and Ewshot) of the 11 wards of the Hart District. Per the Hart District Council (Reorganisation of Community Governance) (Church Crookham) Order 2018, the parish is further divided into the parish wards of Crookham East, Gally Hill and Queen Elizabeth.

==Notes of interest==
Motorists entering Fleet from the south and west are met with signs welcoming them to Church Crookham, whereas those entering the town from the north and east are welcomed to Fleet instead.

The Basingstoke Canal bounds the northeast and briefly the northwest of Church Crookham. Across this are modern outer neighbourhoods of Fleet.

The English poet John Keble was a regular visitor to Church Crookham&#x27;s Christ Church.

Replaced by housing (Crookham Park) and landscaping from 2012, the British Army&#x27;s 1938 to 2000 Queen Elizabeth Barracks was quite central in the parish.

===Tweseldown race course===
Tweseldown race course is a point-to-point horse racing track. This racing track was used for the eventing steeplechase in the 1948 London Olympics.

===Filming location ===
Church Crookham has hosted scenes for several films. These include the 2002 James Bond movie &quot;Die Another Day&quot;, which used woodland and flat ground between the village and Aldershot to represent the demilitarised zone between North and South Korea. Church Crookham was also one of several English towns and villages (others including nearby Aldershot, Farnham, and Chobham) that served as filming locations for the 2006 movie &quot;Children of Men&quot;.

<doc id="249724" wikidata="Q111436" url="?curid=249724" title="Elmer Bernstein">
<text>Elmer Bernstein ( &quot;&quot;; April 4, 1922August 18, 2004) was an American composer and conductor. In a career that spanned over five decades, he composed &quot;some of the most recognizable and memorable themes in Hollywood history&quot;, including over 150 original film scores, as well as scores for nearly 80 television productions. For his work, he received an Academy Award for &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967) and a Primetime Emmy Award. He also received seven Golden Globe Awards, five Grammy Awards, and two Tony Award nominations.

He composed and arranged scores for over 100 film scores, including &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; (1952), &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960), &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; (1962), &quot;The World of Henry Orient&quot; (1964), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), &quot;Hud&quot; (1963), &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; (1967), &quot;True Grit&quot; (1969), &quot;My Left Foot&quot; (1989), &quot;The Grifters&quot; (1990), &quot;Cape Fear&quot; (1991), &quot;Twilight&quot; (1998), and &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002). He is known for his work on the comedic films &quot;Animal House&quot; (1978), &quot;Meatballs&quot; (1979), &quot;Airplane!&quot; (1980), &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; (1980), &quot;Stripes&quot; (1981), &quot;Trading Places&quot; (1983), &quot;Ghostbusters&quot; (1984), &quot;Spies Like Us&quot; (1985), and &quot;Three Amigos&quot; (1986).

He also worked on frequent collaborations with directors Martin Scorsese, Robert Mulligan, John Landis, Ivan Reitman, John Sturges, Bill Duke, George Roy Hill, Richard Fleischer, John Frankenheimer, and Henry Hathaway.

==Early life==
Bernstein was born to a Jewish family in New York City, the son of Selma (née Feinstein, 1901–1991), from Ukraine, and Edward Bernstein (1896–1968), from Austria-Hungary.

He was not related to the celebrated composer and conductor Leonard Bernstein, though they were friends. Within the world of professional music, they were distinguished from each other by the use of the nicknames &quot;Bernstein West&quot; (Elmer) and &quot;Bernstein East&quot; (Leonard), based on their bases of operation: East for New York City, West for Hollywood/Los Angeles. They also pronounced their surnames differently; Elmer pronounced his name &quot;BERN-steen&quot;, and Leonard used &quot;BERN-styne&quot;.

During his childhood, Bernstein performed professionally as a dancer and an actor, in the latter case playing the part of Caliban in &quot;The Tempest&quot; on Broadway, and he also won several prizes for his painting. He attended Manhattan&#x27;s progressive Walden School and gravitated toward music. At the age of 12 he was awarded a piano scholarship by Henriette Michelson, a Juilliard teacher who guided him throughout his entire career as a pianist. She took him to play some of his improvisations for composer Aaron Copland, who was encouraging and selected Israel Citkowitz as a teacher for the young boy.

Bernstein was drafted into the United States Army Air Forces during the World War II era where he wrote music for the Armed Forces Radio.

Elmer Bernstein&#x27;s music has some stylistic similarities to Copland&#x27;s music, most notably in his western scores, particularly sections of &quot;Big Jake,&quot; in the Gregory Peck film &quot;Amazing Grace and Chuck&quot;, and in his spirited score for the 1958 film adaptation of Erskine Caldwell&#x27;s novel &quot;God&#x27;s Little Acre&quot;.

He had a lifelong enthusiasm for an even wider spectrum of the arts than his childhood interests would imply and, in 1959, when he was scoring &quot;The Story on Page One&quot;, he considered becoming a novelist and asked the film&#x27;s screenwriter, Clifford Odets, to give him lessons in writing fiction.

==Career==
=== Early career ===

Bernstein wrote the theme songs or other music for more than 200 films and TV shows, including &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;, &quot;The Great Escape&quot;, &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), &quot;Johnny Staccato (1959 TV Theme and Capitol Records album)&quot; received little attention in the US but the single went to #4 in Britain, &quot;True Grit&quot;, &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot;, &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;, &quot;Robot Monster&quot;, &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Baby the Rain Must Fall&quot; (1965), and the fanfare used in the National Geographic television specials.

His theme for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; is also familiar to television viewers, as it was used in commercials for Marlboro cigarettes. Bernstein also provided the score to many of the short films of Ray and Charles Eames.

In 1961 Bernstein co-founded Äva Records, an American record label based in Los Angeles together with Fred Astaire, Jackie Mills and Tommy Wolf.

===Broadway===
In addition to his film music, Bernstein wrote the scores for two Broadway musicals, &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot;, with lyricist Carolyn Leigh, in 1967 and &quot;Merlin&quot;, with lyricist Don Black, in 1983.

One of Bernstein&#x27;s tunes has since gained a lasting place in U.S. college sports culture. In 1968, University of South Carolina football head coach Paul Dietzel wrote new lyrics to &quot;Step to the Rear&quot;, from &quot;How Now, Dow Jones&quot;. The South Carolina version of the tune, &quot;The Fighting Gamecocks Lead the Way&quot;, has been the school&#x27;s fight song ever since.

===1950s: Hollywood Blacklist===
Along with many other artists in Hollywood, Bernstein faced censure during the McCarthy era of the early 1950s. Bernstein was called by the House Un-American Activities Committee when it was discovered that he had written some music reviews for a Communist newspaper. After he refused to name names, pointing out that he had never attended a Communist Party meeting, he found himself composing music for movies such as &quot;Robot Monster&quot; and &quot;Cat-Women of the Moon&quot;, a step down from his earlier &quot;Sudden Fear&quot; and &quot;Saturday&#x27;s Hero&quot;.

===1980s: Comedic works ===
John Landis grew up near Bernstein, and befriended him through his children. Years later, he requested that Bernstein compose the music for &quot;National Lampoon&#x27;s Animal House&quot;, over the studio&#x27;s objections. He explained to Bernstein that he thought that Bernstein&#x27;s score, playing it straight as if the comedic Delta frat characters were actual heroes, would emphasize the comedy further.

The opening theme of the film is based upon a slight inversion of a secondary theme from Brahms&#x27;s &quot;Academic Festival Overture&quot;. Bernstein accepted the job, and it sparked a second wave in his career, where he continued to compose music for high-profile comedies such as &quot;Ghostbusters&quot;, &quot;Stripes&quot;, &quot;Airplane!&quot; and &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot;, as well as most of Landis&#x27;s films for the next 15 years, including &quot;An American Werewolf in London&quot;, &quot;Trading Places&quot;, and the music video to the Michael Jackson song &quot;Thriller&quot;.

===1990s: Continued work===

When Martin Scorsese announced that he was re-making &quot;Cape Fear&quot;, Bernstein adapted Bernard Herrmann&#x27;s original score to the new film. Bernstein leapt at the opportunity to work with Scorsese, as well as to pay homage to Herrmann. Scorsese and Bernstein subsequently worked together on two more films, &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993) and &quot;Bringing Out the Dead&quot; (1999). Bernstein had previously conducted Herrmann&#x27;s original unused score for Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s 1966 &quot;Torn Curtain&quot;.

==Classical==
Having studied composition under Aaron Copland, Roger Sessions, and Stefan Wolpe, Bernstein also performed as a concert pianist between 1939 and 1950 and wrote numerous classical compositions, including three orchestral suites, two song cycles, various compositions for viola and piano and for solo piano, and a string quartet.

As president of the Young Musicians Foundation, Bernstein became acquainted with classical guitarist Christopher Parkening and wrote a Concerto for Guitar and Orchestra, which Parkening recorded with the London Symphony Orchestra under Bernstein&#x27;s baton for the Angel label in 1999. In addition, Bernstein was a professor at the University of Southern California&#x27;s Thornton School of Music and conductor of the San Fernando Valley Symphony in the early 1970s.

==Personal life and death==
Bernstein was married three times, first to Rhoda Federgreen. Their marriage lasted from 1942 to 1946. Bernstein&#x27;s second wife was Pearl Glusman, whom he wed in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, on December 21, 1946. After the couple&#x27;s divorce in 1965, Bernstein married Eve Adamson. They remained together for 39 years, until his death.

In the 1960s, Bernstein was an owner in the Triad Stable Thoroughbred racing partnership, named for a music term. His partners included his assistant, Robert Helfer, and the wife of the Triad Stable&#x27;s trainer Morton Lipton.

The Bernsteins in the 1990s resided in Hope Ranch, a suburb of Santa Barbara, California. Later, they moved to a home in Ojai, California, where Bernstein died of cancer on August 18, 2004. His publicist Cathy Mouton simply stated at the time that Bernstein had died following a lengthy illness. He was survived by his wife Eve and their two daughters, Emilie and Elizabeth; by his two sons, Peter and Gregory Bernstein, from his earlier marriage to Pearl Glusman; and by five grandchildren.

==Influences and legacy ==
Bernstein considered these artists as influences on his work: Benny Goodman, Count Basie, Dimitri Tiomkin, Duke Ellington, Erich Wolfgang Korngold, Franz Waxman, Miklós Rózsa, Jimmie Lunceford, Max Steiner, Victor Young, Aaron Copland, Bernard Herrmann, Nino Rota, Roger Sessions, Stefan Wolpe.

Composers who have acknowledged the influence of Bernstein&#x27;s work on their own include James Newton Howard, Alan Silvestri, Georges Delerue, Howard Shore, John Barry, Lalo Schifrin, Dick Hyman, Hans Zimmer, James Horner, Jerry Goldsmith, John Williams, Trevor Jones, Mark Isham, Bear McCreary, Ennio Morricone, Danny Elfman, Alan Menken, Randy Newman, and Randy Edelman.

==Compositions==
==Awards and nominations==
Over the course of his career, Bernstein won an Academy Award, an Emmy Award, and two Golden Globe Awards. In addition, he was nominated for the Tony Award three times and a Grammy Award five times. He received 14 Academy Award nominations and was nominated at least once per decade from the 1950s until the 2000s, but his only win was for &quot;Thoroughly Modern Millie&quot; for Best Original Music Score. Bernstein was recognized by the Hollywood Foreign Press Association with Golden Globes for his scores for &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; and &quot;Hawaii&quot;. In 1963, he won the Primetime Emmy Award for his score of &quot;The Making of The President 1960&quot;. He is the recipient of Western Heritage Awards for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; (1960) and &quot;The Hallelujah Trail&quot; (1965).

Additional honors included lifetime achievement awards from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, American Society of Composers, Authors and Publishers (ASCAP), the Society for the Preservation of Film Music, the US, Woodstock, Santa Barbara, Newport Beach and Flanders International Film Festivals and the Foundation for a Creative America. In 1996, Bernstein was honored with a star on Hollywood Boulevard. In 1999, he received an honorary Doctorate of Music from Five Towns College in New York and was honored by the American Film Institute in Los Angeles. Bernstein again was honored by ASCAP with its marquee Founders Award in 2001 and with the NARAS Governors Award in June 2004. Bernstein was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2003 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel at London&#x27;s Royal Albert Hall, after conducting the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra as part of his 80th year celebrations.

His scores for &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot; and &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; were ranked by the American Film Institute as the eighth and seventeenth greatest American film scores of all time, respectively, on the list of AFI&#x27;s 100 Years of Film Scores. Bernstein, Bernard Herrmann, Max Steiner, and Jerry Goldsmith are the only composers to have two scores listed, and are therefore in second place for the most scores on the list, behind John Williams, who has three. Other Bernstein film scores nominated for the list are as follows: &quot;The Age of Innocence&quot; (1993), &quot;Far from Heaven&quot; (2002), &quot;The Great Escape&quot; (1963), &quot;Hawaii&quot; (1966), &quot;The Man with the Golden Arm&quot; (1955), &quot;Summer and Smoke&quot; (1961), &quot;Sweet Smell of Success&quot; (1957), &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot; (1956), and &quot;Walk on the Wild Side&quot; (1962).

<text>Mixed radix numeral systems are non-standard positional numeral systems in which the numerical base varies from position to position. Such numerical representation applies when a quantity is expressed using a sequence of units that are each a multiple of the next smaller one, but not by the same factor. Such units are common for instance in measuring time; a time of 32 weeks, 5 days, 7 hours, 45 minutes, 15 seconds, and 500 milliseconds might be expressed as a number of minutes in mixed-radix notation as:

 ... 32, 5, 07, 45; 15, 500
 ... ∞, 7, 24, 60; 60, 1000

or as

:32∞5707244560.15605001000

In the tabular format, the digits are written above their base, and a semicolon indicates the radix point. In numeral format, each digit has its associated base attached as a subscript, and the radix point is marked by a full stop or period. The base for each digit is the number of corresponding units that make up the next larger unit. As a consequence there is no base (written as ∞) for the first (most significant) digit, since here the &quot;next larger unit&quot; does not exist (and one could not add a larger unit of &quot;month&quot; or &quot;year&quot; to the sequence of units, as they are not integer multiples of &quot;week&quot;).

==Examples==
The most familiar example of mixed-radix systems is in timekeeping and calendars. Western time radices include, both cardinally and ordinally, decimal years, decades, and centuries, septenary for days in a week, duodecimal months in a year, bases 28–31 for days within a month, as well as base 52 for weeks in a year. Time is further divided into hours counted in base 24 hours, sexagesimal minutes within an hour and seconds within a minute, with decimal fractions of the latter.

A standard form for dates is , which would be a mixed radix number by this definition, with the consideration that the quantities of days vary both per month, and with leap years. One proposed calendar instead uses base 13 months, quaternary weeks, and septenary days.

A mixed radix numeral system is often best expressed with a table. A table describing what can be understood as the 604800 seconds of a week is as follows, with the week beginning on hour 0 of day 0 (midnight on Sunday):

In this numeral system, the mixed radix numeral 37172451605760 seconds would be interpreted as 17:51:57 on Wednesday, and 0702402602460 would be 00:02:24 on Sunday. Ad hoc notations for mixed radix numeral systems are commonplace.

The Maya calendar consists of several overlapping cycles of different radices. A short count &quot;tzolk&#x27;in&quot; overlaps base 20 named days with tridecimal numbered days. A &quot;haab&#x27;&quot; consists of vigesimal days, octodecimal &quot;months&quot;, and base-52 years forming a &quot;round&quot;. In addition, a &quot;long count&quot; of vigesimal days, octodecimal &quot;winal&quot;, then base 24 &quot;tun&quot;, &quot;k&#x27;atun&quot;, &quot;b&#x27;ak&#x27;tun&quot;, etc., tracks historical dates.

A second example of a mixed-radix numeral system in current use is in the design and use of currency, where a limited set of denominations are printed or minted with the objective of being able to represent any monetary quantity; the amount of money is then represented by the number of coins or banknotes of each denomination. When deciding which denominations to create (and hence which radices to mix), a compromise is aimed for between a minimal number of different denominations, and a minimal number of individual pieces of coinage required to represent typical quantities. So, for example, in the UK, banknotes are printed for £50, £20, £10 and £5, and coins are minted for £2, £1, 50p, 20p, 10p, 5p, 2p and 1p—these follow the 1-2-5 series of preferred values.

Prior to decimalisation, monetary amounts in the UK were described in terms of pounds, shillings, and pence, with 12 pence per shilling and 20 shillings per pound, so that &quot;£1 7s 6d&quot;, for example, corresponded to the mixed-radix numeral 1∞720612.

United States customary units are generally mixed radix systems, with multipliers varying from one size unit to the next in the same manner that units of time do.

Mixed-radix representation is also relevant to mixed-radix versions of the Cooley–Tukey FFT algorithm, in which the indices of the input values are expanded in a mixed-radix representation, the indices of the output values are expanded in a corresponding mixed-radix representation with the order of the bases and digits reversed, and each subtransform can be regarded as a Fourier transform in one digit for all values of the remaining digits.

==Manipulation==
Mixed-radix numbers of the same base can be manipulated using a generalization of manual arithmetic algorithms. Conversion of values from one mixed base to another is easily accomplished by first converting the place values of the one system into the other, and then applying the digits from the one system against these.

APL and J include operators to convert to and from mixed-radix systems.

== Factorial number system ==
Another proposal is the so-called factorial number system:

For example, the biggest number that could be represented with six digits would be 543210 which equals 719 in decimal: 5×5! + 4×4! + 3×3! + 2×2! + 1×1! It might not be clear at first sight but the factorial based numbering system is unambiguous and complete. Every number can be represented in one and only one way because the sum of respective factorials multiplied by the index is always the next factorial minus one:

: formula_1

There is a natural mapping between the integers 0, ..., &quot;n&quot;! − 1 and permutations of &quot;n&quot; elements in lexicographic order, which uses the factorial representation of the integer, followed by an interpretation as a Lehmer code.

The above equation is a particular case of the following general rule for any radix (either standard or mixed) base representation which expresses the fact that any radix (either standard or mixed) base representation is unambiguous and complete. Every number can be represented in one and only one way because the sum of respective weights multiplied by the index is always the next weight minus one:

: formula_2, where formula_3,
which can be easily proved with mathematical induction.

== Primorial number system ==

Another proposal is the number system with successive prime numbers as radix, whose place values are primorial numbers, considered by S. S. Pillai, Richard K. Guy , and other authors:

: formula_4 where formula_5, and &quot;pj&quot; = &quot;j&quot;th prime, &quot;p&quot;0# = &quot;p&quot;0 = 1.

<text>Steven Van Zandt (né Lento; born November 22, 1950), also known as Little Steven or Miami Steve, is an American musician and actor. He is a member of Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band, in which he plays guitar and mandolin. He has appeared in several television drama series, including as Silvio Dante in &quot;The Sopranos&quot; (1999–2007) and as Frank Tagliano in &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; (2012–2014). Van Zandt has his own solo band called Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, intermittently active since the 1980s. 

In 2014, Van Zandt was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the E Street Band. Van Zandt has produced music, written songs, and had his own songs covered by Springsteen, Meat Loaf, Nancy Sinatra, Pearl Jam, Southside Johnny, Artists United Against Apartheid, and the Iron City Houserockers, among others.

==Early life==
Van Zandt was born Steven Lento on November 22, 1950, in Winthrop, Massachusetts, to Mary Henrietta Lento and Vince Borello, and raised in Watertown, Massachusetts. He has Italian ancestry; one grandfather was from Calabria and one grandmother&#x27;s parents were from Naples. 

His mother remarried in 1957, and he took the last name of his stepfather, William Brewster Van Zandt. Actor Billy Van Zandt is Van Zandt&#x27;s half-brother and actress Adrienne Barbeau is his ex-sister-in-law. He also has a half-sister named Kathi, who is a writer.

When he was seven, the family moved from Massachusetts to Middletown Township, New Jersey.

Van Zandt found his love for music at an early age, when he learned how to play the guitar. He watched the performances of the Beatles on &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot; and the Rolling Stones on &quot;Hollywood Palace&quot; in 1964, and referred to the former as &quot;The Big Bang of Rock n&#x27; Roll&quot;. He said that when he was 13, George Harrison was his favorite Beatle, and he later became friends with Paul McCartney and Ringo Starr. 

Around August 1964, he formed his first band, the Whirlwinds, which was short-lived. He later formed the Mates in 1965 and joined the Shadows in May 1966. Van Zandt has cited British Invasion bands such as the Dave Clark Five, as well as Ravi Shankar and the culture of India, as early influences.

Van Zandt attended Middletown High School in Middletown Township, New Jersey, where he was expelled after refusing to cut his long hair. He later returned to school in 1968, largely to appease his mother. As a teenager, he was involved in a car accident that caused him to smash his head through the windshield, leaving several scars on his head. To cover this up, he began wearing hats, and later, large bandanas, which has become his characteristic look.

==Career==
Van Zandt grew up in the Jersey Shore music scene, and was an early friend of Bruce Springsteen, before the formation of the E Street Band. The two first met when Springsteen was at the Hullabaloo club in Middletown, New Jersey, and heard Van Zandt was performing &quot;Happy Together&quot; with the Shadows. They performed together in bands such as Steel Mill and the Bruce Springsteen Band. 

During the early 1970s, Van Zandt worked in road construction for two years before returning to show business. 

In 1973, he toured with The Dovells. The tour ended in Miami on December 31, 1974, with Dick Clark&#x27;s &quot;Good Old Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Show&quot; at the Deauville Star Theater. 

After returning to New Jersey, Van Zandt continued wearing Hawaiian shirts because he did not particularly like winter, which was how he got the nickname &quot;Miami Steve&quot;.

===Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes===

He co-founded Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, in addition to The Miami Horns, who got their name from Van Zandt&#x27;s nickname. Van Zandt helped establish the rhythm and blues oriented style of music that the band performed. He also produced Southside Johnny&#x27;s first three albums. Van Zandt wrote the bulk of the group&#x27;s music, contributing substantially to its success.

===E Street Band===

Van Zandt then started to switch between writing for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes and touring with the E Street Band. He confirmed in an interview on &quot;The Howard Stern Show&quot; that he arranged the horns on &quot;Tenth Avenue Freeze-Out&quot; in 1975 when Springsteen was at a loss, earning him a spot in the E Street Band shortly thereafter. In the &quot;Wings For Wheels&quot; documentary, Springsteen revealed that Van Zandt was partially responsible for the signature guitar line in &quot;Born to Run,&quot; described as &quot;Arguably Steve&#x27;s greatest contribution to my music.&quot; Ultimately, Van Zandt officially joined the E Street Band on July 20, 1975, during the first show of the Born to Run Tour.

In those early years, Van Zandt supplied a great deal of the lead guitar work for the band in concert, as can be seen on the 1975 concert DVD within &quot;Born to Run 30th Anniversary Edition&quot; (later released as the CD &quot;Hammersmith Odeon London &#x27;75&quot;). In 1984, Van Zandt left the E Street Band. He originally joined to see Springsteen rise in success, and once the band rose to that success he left. Despite leaving the band, he appeared as a special guest at some concerts on the Born in the U.S.A. Tour and appeared in a couple of videos, including &quot;Glory Days&quot;.

Van Zandt later returned to the E Street Band when it was reformed (briefly in 1995, and on an ongoing basis since 1999) and remains a member. By this time, his guitar playing had mostly been reduced to a background rhythm role, due to Nils Lofgren&#x27;s position in the band and his capability as a lead guitarist. In addition, Springsteen had begun taking many more guitar solos as his music became more guitar-centered. Van Zandt said on the &quot;Howard Stern Show&quot; that he is okay with being second in command, especially since he has been in charge before with his solo music and his role in &quot;Lilyhammer&quot;. 

Among E Street Band members, Van Zandt often had the second-most &quot;face time&quot; in concert after Clarence Clemons, frequently mugging and posing for the audience and sometimes delivering his unpolished, nasal backing vocals while sharing a microphone with Springsteen. His playing or singing is most prominently featured on the songs &quot;Glory Days&quot;, &quot;Two Hearts&quot;, &quot;Long Walk Home&quot;, which featured a Van Zandt outro vocal solo during live performances &quot;Land of Hope and Dreams&quot;, &quot;Badlands&quot;, &quot;Ramrod&quot;, and &quot;Murder Incorporated&quot;, among others like the live versions of &quot;Rosalita&quot;. He often trades vocals with Springsteen in live versions of &quot;Prove It All Night&quot;. He features prominently in the video for &quot;Glory Days&quot;, sharing the spotlight with Springsteen during the choruses, while swapping lines with him during the (non)fade, and in live versions he does the same. During the E Street Band&#x27;s performance at the Super Bowl in 2009, Van Zandt was the most prominently featured member of the band, playing a guitar solo on the final number of the set, &quot;Glory Days,&quot; as well as sharing lead vocals and exchanging humorous banter with Springsteen.

===Songwriter, arranger, producer===
Van Zandt became a songwriter and producer for fellow Jersey shore act Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes in 1974, penning their signature song &quot;I Don&#x27;t Want to Go Home&quot;, co-writing other songs for them with Springsteen, and producing their most-acclaimed record, &quot;Hearts of Stone&quot;. As such, Van Zandt became a key contributor to the Jersey Shore sound. He also produced two Gary U.S. Bonds albums. Van Zandt then went on to share production credits on the classic Springsteen albums &quot;The River&quot; and &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; The first Springsteen song he co-produced was &quot;Hungry Heart.&quot; In 1989, Jackson Browne covered the 1983 Van Zandt composition &quot;I Am A Patriot&quot; on his &quot;World in Motion&quot; album. Van Zandt has produced a number of other records, including an uncredited effort on the Iron City Houserockers&#x27; &quot;Have A Good Time (But Get Out Alive)&quot;. Less successful was his work on Lone Justice&#x27;s second album &quot;Shelter&quot;, which was a career-ending flop for the Los Angeles cowpunk band.

In 1989, Van Zandt wrote &quot;While You Were Looking at Me&quot; for Michael Monroe&#x27;s album &quot;Not Fakin&#x27; It&quot; and co-wrote video hits &quot;Dead, Jail or Rock&#x27;n Roll&quot; and &quot;Smoke Screen&quot;. He was an arranger and backing vocalist for a few songs on the album. In 1992, he produced Austin, Texas-based Arc Angels&#x27; debut album. In 1991 Van Zandt produced a successful album, &quot;Spirit of Love&quot;, for Nigerian superstar and reggae icon, Majek Fashek. In 1992, Van Zandt wrote and produced &quot;All Alone on Christmas&quot; for the soundtrack of the Chris Columbus film &quot;Home Alone 2: Lost in New York&quot;, which yielded singer Darlene Love her first hit since &quot;A Fine, Fine Boy&quot; from 1963, thirty-one years earlier.

In 1994, Van Zandt produced the eponymous debut album of the punk rock band Demolition 23 which featured ex-Hanoi Rocks members Michael Monroe and Sami Yaffa. Van Zandt also co-wrote six songs for the album with Monroe and Jude Wilder. In 1995, Van Zandt aided Meat Loaf with the song &quot;Amnesty Is Granted&quot; off of his &quot;Welcome to the Neighborhood&quot; album. In 2004, he contributed the song &quot;Baby Please Don&#x27;t Go&quot; to Nancy Sinatra&#x27;s self-titled album.

===Solo artist===

During the summer of 1981, EMI-America approached Van Zandt with a record deal due to his success with the E Street Band, Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, and Gary U.S. Bonds. He began fronting an on-and-off group known as Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul, while Springsteen was working on &quot;Nebraska&quot;. The band included Dino Danelli on drums, Jean Beauvoir on bass, and the Miami Horns. They made their live debut at the Peppermint Lounge on July 18, 1982. In October 1982, Van Zandt&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Men Without Women&quot;, was released. This album earned the most critical praise and Jay Cocks of &quot;TIME&quot; magazine dubbed it one of the ten best albums of the year. Van Zandt released four more solo albums, and has written that these albums are each elements in a five-part political concept cycle: the individual, the family, the state, the economy, and religion. These albums range from soul music to hard rock to world music. Van Zandt&#x27;s second album, &quot;Voice of America&quot;, did the best on the U.S. albums chart, although none of his albums were much of a commercial success. 

After touring with the E Street Band during The River Tour in 1980–81, he started to realize and understand the perceptions of Americans held by people in other countries. He started to become interested in politics and, with &quot;Voice of America&quot;, his music became explicitly political. One of the album&#x27;s leading singles, &quot;Solidarity&quot;, is a general statement of international common ground. 

In April 1984, shortly before the release of &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; and &quot;Voice of America&quot;, Van Zandt left the E Street Band, but rejoined in 1999.

Continuing his involvement in issues of the day, in 1985 he created the music-industry activist group Artists United Against Apartheid as an action against the Sun City resort in South Africa. Forty-nine recording artists, including Springsteen, U2, Bob Dylan, Pete Townshend, Joey Ramone, Tom Petty, Afrika Bambaataa, and Run DMC, collaborated on a song called &quot;Sun City&quot; in which they pledged to never perform at the resort. The song was modestly successful, and played a part in the broad international effort to bring attention to apartheid, which the South African government later ended. Van Zandt also produced the award-winning documentary &quot;The Making of Sun City&quot; and oversaw the production of the book, &quot;Sun City by Artists United Against Apartheid, the Struggle for Freedom in South Africa: The Making of the Record&quot;, as well as the teaching guide.

In 1987, he released the album &quot;Freedom - No Compromise&quot;, which continued the political messaging. Some U.S. appearances in that year as opening act for U2&#x27;s arena-and-stadium Joshua Tree Tour continued in the same vein, but were not well received by some audiences. Both the record and his concerts were popular in Europe. He also performed at the &quot;Nelson Mandela 70th Birthday Tribute&quot; concert at Wembley Stadium in 1988.

His fourth album, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot;, attracted little attention. Later in 1989, Van Zandt recorded another album, &quot;Nobody Loves and Leaves Alive&quot; with his garage band The Lost Boys. Although the album remains unreleased, several tracks from it were heard on the &quot;Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; television shows: including &quot;Nobody Loves and Leaves Alive&quot;, &quot;Affection&quot;, and &quot;Come for Me&quot;. &quot;Affection&quot; appeared on &quot;The Sopranos: Peppers &amp; Eggs (Music From the HBO Original Series)&quot;.

Due to a loss of recording contract, his next album, &quot;Born Again Savage&quot;, which was recorded in 1994, was not released until 1999. In 1995, Van Zandt wrote, produced, and sang &quot;The Time of Your Life&quot; for the soundtrack to the film &quot;Nine Months&quot;. He also toured with Bon Jovi during the first European leg of their These Days Tour.

Van Zandt&#x27;s song &quot;Under The Gun&quot; was covered by Carla Olson &amp; The Textones on their &quot;Detroit &#x27;85 Live &amp; Unreleased&quot; album which was released in 2008. Another of his songs, &quot;All I Needed Was You&quot;, appeared on the 2013 Carla Olson album &quot;Have Harmony, Will Travel&quot;.

On April 29, 2013, Van Zandt performed a cover of Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;My Kind of Town&quot; at a Springsteen concert in Oslo, Norway, during the Wrecking Ball Tour. Although the song was featured in the &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; season one episode &quot;My Kind of Town,&quot; it was not released as a single until September 23, 2014, when it was &quot;the Coolest Song in the World&quot; on &quot;Underground Garage&quot; to help promote the show. It was released under the title &quot;Frank Tagliano Sings! My Kind of Town&quot; and the lyrics were changed to be about Lillehammer, Norway, instead of Chicago. Van Zandt performed the song on &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon&quot; on December 9, 2014, to help promote the series. Van Zandt performed all the music for &quot;Lilyhammer&quot; from season 2 on and released &quot;Lilyhammer: The Score&quot; on December 16, 2014.

Van Zandt reformed his band, the Disciples of Soul, for the first time since 1990 to play their only European show of 2016 at the O2 Indigo Lounge in London for BluesFest on October 29, 2016. The new Disciples included Richie Sambora and Marc Ribler on guitar, Eddie Manion on saxophone, Hook Herrara on harmonica, Leo Green on tenor sax, Richard Mecurio on drums, Jack Daley on bass, Andy Burton on B3 organ, Clifford Carter on piano, Danny Sadownick on percussion, Tommy Walsh and Matt Holland on trumpet, Neil Sidwell on trombone, George Millard on flute, and a women&#x27;s section called the Divas of Soul (Julie Maguire, Sarah Carpenter and Jess Greenfield) on backing vocals. They played a series of Van Zandt&#x27;s own solo songs, songs he wrote for Southside Johnny and the Asbury Jukes, a song he co-wrote for the Breakers, cover songs, and &quot;Goodbye&quot;, a song that he performed with the Lost Boys. His plans included a European tour during the summer of 2017 and a tour of the United States in the fall. Van Zandt insists that he is not leaving the E Street Band and he is only touring because the band is not on the road.

Van Zandt announced in November 2016 that he was in the process of remastering and reissuing his albums for a 2017 release, including the unreleased Lost Boys album. Additionally, Van Zandt has stated that he was planning on releasing a new cover album, including a cover of Etta James&#x27; &quot;The Blues Is My Business&quot;, as well as new recordings of songs Van Zandt wrote for others, including Southside Johnny, that he describes as &quot;me covering me.&quot; The album is a soul record, composed of a 15 piece band including 5 horns and 3 singers. Van Zandt revealed that Richie Mercurio plays drums on the album.
On February 9, 2017, Van Zandt released &quot;Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day,&quot; a cover of the song, &quot;Saint Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre,&quot; that he originally wrote for the Cocktail Slippers, as a single. The song was repeatedly played on the &quot;Underground Garage&quot; radio show.

He debuted his new album at the annual Rock and Roll for Children event at the Fillmore Theater in Silver Spring, Maryland, on March 18, 2017. Van Zandt debuted a doo-wop song called &quot;The City Weeps Tonight,&quot; that was an outtake from &quot;Men Without Women&quot;. At the end of the show, he covered &quot;Bye Bye Johnny&quot; as a tribute to the late Chuck Berry. According to &quot;Backstreets&quot;, Van Zandt&#x27;s new album was going to be called &quot;Soulfire&quot;, titled after the song he co-wrote for the Breakers. The album was officially released on May 19, 2017. Van Zandt was selected as the commencement speaker and received a honorary degree from Rutgers University in May 2017.

Van Zandt released his first official live album, &quot;Soulfire Live!&quot;, recorded with the Disciples of Soul during their 2017 tour of the same name, on April 27, 2018, via iTunes. A 7 LP vinyl box set, CD, and two-disc Blu-ray video were released on February 15, 2019, via Wicked Cool Records/UMe. Consisting of the best performances from their North American and European concerts, the collection feature Little Steven and his 15-strong band taking you on a musical history lesson as they blast through an arsenal of songs spanning rock, pop, soul, blues, funk, doo-wop, reggae and everything in between. Of note, is a performance of &quot;I Saw Her Standing There&quot; recorded at The Roundhouse in London with a special appearance by Paul McCartney.

Little Steven and the Disciples of Soul recorded a cover of Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;Santa Claus Is Back in Town&quot;, featuring actor Kurt Russell on lead vocals, for the 2018 film &quot;The Christmas Chronicles&quot;.

On March 8, 2019, Van Zandt announced the May 3, 2019, CD, digital and vinyl release of &quot;Summer of Sorcery&quot; via Wicked Cool/UME. It was written, arranged, and produced by him at his Renegade Studios in New York City and marks his first new album of original material in 20 years. A tour for the album began in May 2019, but was cancelled in September 2019 due to illness.

Van Zandt finally reissued his albums in the 7 LP and 4-CD box set, &quot;Rock N Roll Rebel: The Early Work&quot;, released on December 6, 2019. Limited to 1,000 copies, it includes the first United States pressing of 1989&#x27;s &quot;Revolution&quot;, as well as the first vinyl release of &quot;Born Again Savage&quot;, originally released in 1999. The box set also includes rare outtakes and live performances. The Lost Boys album, however, remains unreleased. Van Zandt stated that the album contains his favorite songs that he recorded and wants to wait until the album can be &quot;properly promoted.&quot;

=== Actor ===
Until 1999, Van Zandt had no professional acting experience. His main focus had been music, whether it was the multiple bands he participated in, groups he composed pieces for, or music he wrote on his own. Then, he was asked to play a part in &quot;The Sopranos,&quot; and from there on, acting became part of Van Zandt&#x27;s career.

====&quot;The Sopranos&quot;====

In 1999, Van Zandt took one of the lead roles in &quot;The Sopranos&quot;, playing level-headed but deadly mob &quot;consigliere&quot; and strip club owner Silvio Dante. The casting choice was made by series creator David Chase, who invited Van Zandt to audition after seeing him induct The Rascals at the 1997 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and being impressed with his humorous appearance and presence. Though Van Zandt had never acted before, he auditioned for the role of Tony Soprano. HBO felt that the role should go to an experienced actor, however, so Chase wrote a part especially for Van Zandt. Van Zandt eventually agreed to star on the show as Silvio Dante, and his real-life spouse Maureen (née Santoro) was cast as his on-screen wife Gabriella.

====&quot;Tussles in Brussels&quot;====
Van Zandt recorded the narration for The Hives biography on their concert DVD &quot;Tussles in Brussels&quot; (2004).

====&quot;Hotel Cæsar&quot;====

In 2010, Van Zandt appeared as himself in the Norwegian soap opera &quot;Hotel Cæsar&quot;, broadcast on Norway&#x27;s biggest commercial channel TV2 Norway. He also appeared on Scandinavia&#x27;s largest talkshow &quot;Skavlan&quot;.

====&quot;Lilyhammer&quot;====
In 2011, he starred in, co-wrote, and was the executive producer for an English and Norwegian language series entitled &quot;Lilyhammer&quot;, the first original Netflix series that was produced in collaboration with Norwegian broadcaster NRK. The name recalls the city of Lillehammer, which hosted the 1994 Winter Olympics. On the show, Van Zandt portrays a &quot;Sopranos&quot;-like role of an ex-mafioso who enters the witness protection program and flees to Norway to escape a colleague against whom he testified. The show premiered on NRK television on January 25, 2012, with an audience of 998,000 viewers (one fifth of Norway&#x27;s population), and ran for three seasons before being cancelled in 2015.

====&quot;The Irishman&quot;====
Van Zandt appears in the Martin Scorsese-produced gangster epic &quot;The Irishman&quot; as singer Jerry Vale, lip-syncing Vale&#x27;s &quot;Al Di La.&quot;

===Radio host and entrepreneur===

====Radio host====
Since 2002, Van Zandt has hosted &quot;Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage&quot;, a weekly syndicated radio show that celebrates garage rock and similar rock subgenres from the 1950s to the present day. As of December 2006, the show is heard on over 200 US radio stations and in some international markets. For example, in Spain it has beamed through Rock &amp; Gol since 2007 and later on Rock FM Radio in Finland; Radio Helsinki started beaming &quot;Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage&quot; in August 2008.

On October 20, 2011, the program recorded its 500th show in front of a sold-out crowd at the Hard Rock Cafe in New York&#x27;s Times Square. The guests included the band Green Day; Steve Buscemi, star of &quot;The Sopranos&quot; and &quot;Boardwalk Empire&quot;; Vincent Pastore, aka &quot;Big Pussy Bonpensiero&quot; from &quot;The Sopranos&quot;; actor and director Tim Robbins; and singer Debbie Harry of the group Blondie.

====Program director====
Van Zandt is also the program director for two radio channels for the Sirius Satellite Radio network. The channels continuously broadcast on satellite radio in the US, and worldwide on Sirius Internet Radio. One channel, named &quot;Underground Garage&quot;, has the same philosophy and musical mandate as his own radio show. On-air hosts on the channel include original Rolling Stones manager/producer Andrew Loog Oldham, singer/guitarist Joan Jett, former record executive Kid Leo, punk rock singer Handsome Dick Manitoba and rock entrepreneur Kim Fowley. The second channel, named the &quot;Outlaw Country&quot;, presents the edgier side of country music, both roots and contemporary. On-air hosts for this channel include pop-culture satirist Mojo Nixon.

====Record label====
In December 2004, Van Zandt launched his own record label, Wicked Cool Records.

The first album released by Wicked Cool was &quot;Fuzz for the Holidays&quot; by Davie Allan and the Arrows, released on December 14, 2004. The first set of records released by Wicked Cool also included new albums from Underground Garage favorites the Charms, the Chesterfield Kings and the Cocktail Slippers; and &quot;CBGB Forever&quot;, a tribute to the famous, now-defunct venue. The label continues to release new albums from the next generation of garage rockers including the Cocktail Slippers as well as volumes of &quot;Little Steven&#x27;s Underground Garage presents The Coolest Songs in the World,&quot; a compilation of selected songs from the &quot;Underground Garage&quot; radio show&#x27;s popular feature, the &quot;Coolest Song in the World This Week&quot;. In 2007, the label signed The Launderettes. The label&#x27;s first Halloween and Christmas themed compilations were released in 2008. Lost Cathedral is a subsidiary label of Wicked Cool Records and home to the band Crown of Thorns.

===Rock and Roll Forever Foundation===
In 2007, Van Zandt launched the non-profit Rock and Roll Forever Foundation and its TeachRock project, which creates K-12 national curriculum. TeachRock includes interdisciplinary, arts-driven materials. The initiative features lesson plans covering topics in social studies, general music, language arts and media studies.

===Musical director===
In September 2006, Van Zandt assembled and directed an all-star band to back Hank Williams Jr. on a new version of &quot;All My Rowdy Friends Are Coming Over Tonight&quot; for the season premiere (and formal ESPN debut) of &quot;Monday Night Football&quot;. The all-star lineup included Little Richard, Rick Nielsen (Cheap Trick), Joe Perry (Aerosmith), Questlove (The Roots), Charlie Daniels, Bootsy Collins, Chris Burney (Bowling for Soup), and Bernie Worrell.

Since 2007, Van Zandt has been the director of a music selection committee for the video game &quot;Rock Band&quot;; he is in charge of selecting new music for the game.

=== Activist career ===
After leaving the E Street Band in 1984, Van Zandt used his celebrity as a musician to fight issues surrounding apartheid in South Africa by creating a group called the Artists United Against Apartheid.

This activist group was created in 1985 by Van Zandt and record producer Arthur Baker. Van Zandt and Baker assembled over 54 different artists to record an album entitled &quot;Sun City&quot; in order to raise awareness about the apartheid policy in South Africa. The title referred to a resort in South Africa that catered to wealthy white tourists. The resort upheld racist apartheid policies, yet many famous entertainers chose to perform there. Artists that took part in the making of the album included Bruce Springsteen, Peter Gabriel, Miles Davis, Bob Dylan, Bono, and Lou Reed.

The &quot;Sun City&quot; project was originally meant to only be one song, but other musicians contributed their own pieces which transformed it into a full-length album. &quot;Sun City&quot; was one of the first musical collaborations among major recording stars to support a political cause rather than a social cause. The album raised over $1 million in support of anti-apartheid efforts. The primary goal of the album and foundation was to draw attention to South Africa&#x27;s racist policy of apartheid and to support a cultural boycott of the country.

Van Zandt was a part of the 1989 charity single, &quot;Spirit of the Forest&quot;, dedicated to saving rain forests.

Later in his career, Van Zandt worked to raise awareness about the U.S. military interference in governments of Central America and other issues.

Her first Broadway appearances were in Galt MacDermot&#x27;s space opera &quot;Via Galactica&quot; (1972), directed by Peter Hall, and The Young Vic&#x27;s &quot;Scapino&quot;, starring Jim Dale (1974).

Chartoff&#x27;s first TV role came in 1976 when she played a nurse on &quot;Search For Tomorrow&quot;, after which she appeared in the 1978 motion picture &quot;American Hot Wax&quot;. She first became a nationally known figure on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Fridays&quot;, which was ABC&#x27;s attempt to create its own version of &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. Chartoff immediately stood out on the series, partly thanks to her regular role as the anchor on the show&#x27;s fake newscasts, but also due to her comedic skills (particularly an impression of Nancy Reagan). On one sketch, Melanie was cold-cocked on live TV when co-star Maryedith Burrell failed to pull her punch during a skit and chipped Chartoff&#x27;s tooth.

Between the demise of &quot;Fridays&quot; in 1982 and her return to a regular series in 1990 with &quot;Parker Lewis Can&#x27;t Lose&quot; (in which she co-starred for three seasons as the high-strung Principal Grace Musso), Chartoff continued to work steadily on television throughout the 1980s, including appearances on &quot;Mr. Belvedere&quot;, &quot;Wiseguy&quot;, and &quot;St. Elsewhere&quot;, as well as a recurring role on &quot;Newhart&quot; as Dr. Kaiser. She made two appearances on &quot;Seinfeld&quot;, including one in the 1998 series finale in which four of her former &quot;Fridays&quot; co-stars were also involved (including Michael Richards). She appeared in the 2006 season finale of &quot;Desperate Housewives&quot;.

In the Los Angeles premiere of Bill Finn and James Lapine&#x27;s musical &quot;March of the Falsettos&quot; (1982), for which she won a Drama-Logue Award, she played Trina. She played Mary Jane Wilkes in the La Jolla Playhouse premiere of &quot;Big River&quot; (1984). At South Coast Repertory she appeared in the world Premiere of &quot;On the Jump&quot;. She played Dot in the West Coast premiere of &quot;Sunday in the Park with George&quot; at San Francisco&#x27;s American Conservatory Theater (1986).

===Inventing===
In 1991, Chartoff and fellow voice actor Michael Bell conceived the Grayway Rotating Drain, a device that recycles shower and sink greywater to flush toilets in the home. In 1992 they collaborated with Ronald K. Ford who applied for, and in 1994 received a patent on the product .

===Voice acting and other projects===
Chartoff&#x27;s first voice-over work was a guest role on &quot;Challenge of the Superfriends&quot;. She has continued her work as an in-demand voice actress and also takes occasional TV and stage roles. Chartoff works as a coach to both actors and non-actors to make them more charismatic in public performances. In 2005, she interviewed Laraine Newman for &quot;Autograph Collector&quot; magazine. Chartoff writes for &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, &quot;The Jewish Journal&quot;, &quot;Defenestration Magazine&quot;, and &quot;The Funny Times&quot;. She performs her original material at such Los Angeles venues as Comedy Central&#x27;s &quot;Sit n&#x27; Spin,&quot; &quot;Tasty Words,&quot; and &quot;I Love a Good Story.&quot;

===&quot;Rugrats&quot;===
From 1991 to 2008, Chartoff voiced Didi Pickles and her mother Grandma Minka on the Nickelodeon series &quot;Rugrats&quot;, for which she won a Daytime Emmy. She continued to voice Didi on the &quot;Rugrats&quot; spin-off series, &quot;All Grown Up!&quot;. For the 2021 revival series of the same name, Chartoff was replaced by actress Ashley Spillers.

===Awards===
Aside from Drama-Logue and Daytime Emmy Awards, she was awarded by the City of Hope for creating and producing the yearly event Halloween for Hope to benefit children&#x27;s cancer research and received a Certificate of Appreciation from the Mayor of Los Angeles for her concerts for the homeless. Chartoff is listed in Who&#x27;s Who in California, and Who&#x27;s Who in American Colleges and Universities.
