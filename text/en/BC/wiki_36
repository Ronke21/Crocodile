<text>Tin Pan Alley was a collection of music publishers and songwriters in New York City that dominated the popular music of the United States in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Originally, it referred to a specific location on West 28th Street, between Fifth and Sixth Avenues in the Flower District of Manhattan, as commemorated by on 28th Street between Broadway and Sixth. Several buildings on Tin Pan Alley are protected as New York City designated landmarks, and the section of 28th Street from Fifth to Sixth Avenue is also officially co-named Tin Pan Alley.

The start of Tin Pan Alley is usually dated to about 1885, when a number of music publishers set up shop in the same district of Manhattan. The end of Tin Pan Alley is less clear cut. Some date it to the start of the Great Depression in the 1930s when the phonograph, radio, and motion pictures supplanted sheet music as the driving force of American popular music, while others consider Tin Pan Alley to have continued into the 1950s when earlier styles of music were upstaged by the rise of rock &amp; roll, which was centered on the Brill Building. Brill Building songwriter Neil Sedaka described his employer as being a natural outgrowth of Tin Pan Alley, in that the older songwriters were still employed in Tin Pan Alley firms while younger songwriters such as Sedaka found work at the Brill Building. 

==Origin of the name==
There are conflicting explanations regarding the origins of the term &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot;. The most popular account holds that it was originally a derogatory reference made by Monroe H. Rosenfeld in the &quot;New York Herald&quot; to the collective sound made by many &quot;cheap upright pianos&quot; all playing different tunes being reminiscent of the banging of tin pans in an alleyway. &quot;The Grove Dictionary of American Music&quot; also cites Rosenfeld as originator of the term, dating its first use from 1903. However, while an article on Tin Pan Alley can be found in the &quot;St. Louis Post-Dispatch&quot; from May of that year, this is unattributed and no piece by Rosenfeld that employs the phrase has been discovered.

Simon Napier-Bell quotes an account of the origin of the name published in a 1930 book about the music business. In this version, popular songwriter Harry von Tilzer was being interviewed about the area around 28th Street and Fifth Avenue, where many music publishers had offices. Von Tilzer had modified his expensive Kindler &amp; Collins piano by placing strips of paper down the strings to give the instrument a more percussive sound. The journalist told von Tilzer, &quot;Your Kindler &amp; Collins sounds exactly like a tin can. I&#x27;ll call the article &#x27;Tin Pan Alley&#x27;.&quot; In any case, the name was firmly attached by the fall of 1908, when &quot;The Hampton Magazine&quot; published an article titled &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; about 28th Street.

According to the Online Etymology Dictionary, &quot;tin pan&quot; was slang for &quot;a decrepit piano&quot; (1882), and the term came to mean a &quot;hit song writing business&quot; by 1907.

With time, the nickname came to describe the American music publishing industry in general. The term then spread to the United Kingdom, where &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; was also used to describe Denmark Street in London&#x27;s West End. In the 1920s the street became known as &quot;Britain&#x27;s Tin Pan Alley&quot; because of its large number of music shops.

==Origin of song publishing in New York City==
In the mid-19th century, copyright control of melodies was not as strict, and publishers would often print their own versions of the songs popular at the time. With stronger copyright protection laws late in the century, songwriters, composers, lyricists, and publishers started working together for their mutual financial benefit. Songwriters would bang on the doors of Tin Pan Alley businesses to get new material.

The commercial center of the popular music publishing industry changed during the course of the 19th century, starting in Boston and moving to Philadelphia, Chicago and Cincinnati before settling in New York City under the influence of new and vigorous publishers which concentrated on vocal music. The two most enterprising New York publishers were Willis Woodard and T.B. Harms, the first companies to specialize in popular songs rather than hymns or classical music. Naturally, these firms were located in the entertainment district, which, at the time, was centered on Union Square. Witmark was the first publishing house to move to West 28th Street as the entertainment district gradually shifted uptown, and by the late 1890s most publishers had followed their lead.

The biggest music houses established themselves in New York City, but small local publishers – often connected with commercial printers or music stores – continued to flourish throughout the country, and there were important regional music publishing centers in Chicago, New Orleans, St. Louis, and Boston. When a tune became a significant local hit, rights to it were usually purchased from the local publisher by one of the big New York firms.

===New York Before Tin Pan Alley===

The American music publishing industry before Tin Pan Alley was largely based on European “art” songs in an effort to get around copyright royalty fees. American music was expensive to produce in the 19th century which meant only about 10-30% of the music printed in the United States, including New York, was written by American composers. This industry, however, laid the groundwork for the publishing industry that would be built upon to create Tin Pan Alley. 

Beginning in the early 1860s, the pianist and composer J.N. Pattison (active 1862-1890) published sheet music out of a piano and organ salesroom in Union Square in downtown Manhattan. He was one of the few musicians or composers to publish his own sheet music, capitalizing on the boom in that medium as America emerged out of the Civil War, and urban middle classes grew. Piano ownership was widespread in middle-class families, and if one wanted to hear a popular new song or melody, one would buy the sheet music and then perform the piece at home.

==In its prime==
The song publishers who created Tin Pan Alley frequently had backgrounds as salesmen. Isadore Witmark previously sold water filters and Leo Feist had sold corsets. Joe Stern and Edward B. Marks had sold neckties and buttons, respectively. The music houses in lower Manhattan were lively places, with a steady stream of songwriters, vaudeville and Broadway performers, musicians, and &quot;song pluggers&quot; coming and going.

Aspiring songwriters came to demonstrate tunes they hoped to sell. When tunes were purchased from unknowns with no previous hits, the name of someone with the firm was often added as co-composer (in order to keep a higher percentage of royalties within the firm), or all rights to the song were purchased outright for a flat fee (including rights to put someone else&#x27;s name on the sheet music as the composer). Many Jewish immigrants became music publishers and songwriters on Tin Pan Alley. Among the songwriters who frequented Tin Pan Alley were Harold Arlen, Irving Berlin, George M. Cohan, Dorothy Fields, Scott Joplin, and Fats Waller. Songwriters who became established producers of successful songs were hired to be on the staff of the music houses.

&quot;Song pluggers&quot; were pianists and singers who represented the music publishers, making their living demonstrating songs to promote sales of sheet music. Most music stores had song pluggers on staff. Other pluggers were employed by the publishers to travel and familiarize the public with their new publications. Among the ranks of song pluggers were George Gershwin, Harry Warren, Vincent Youmans and Al Sherman. A more aggressive form of song plugging was known as &quot;booming&quot;: it meant buying dozens of tickets for shows, infiltrating the audience and then singing the song to be plugged. At Shapiro, Bernstein &amp; Co., Louis Bernstein recalled taking his plugging crew to cycle races at Madison Square Garden: &quot;They had 20,000 people there, we had a pianist and a singer with a large horn. We&#x27;d sing a song to them thirty times a night. They&#x27;d cheer and yell, and we kept pounding away at them. When people walked out, they&#x27;d be singing the song. They couldn&#x27;t help it.&quot;

When vaudeville performers played New York City, they would often visit various Tin Pan Alley firms to find new songs for their acts. Second- and third-rate performers often paid for rights to use a new song, while famous stars were given free copies of publisher&#x27;s new numbers or were paid to perform them, the publishers knowing this was valuable advertising.

Initially Tin Pan Alley specialized in melodramatic ballads and comic novelty songs, but it embraced the newly popular styles of the cakewalk and ragtime music. Later, jazz and blues were incorporated, although less completely, as Tin Pan Alley was oriented towards producing songs that amateur singers or small town bands could perform from printed music. In the 1910s and 1920s Tin Pan Alley published pop songs and dance numbers created in newly popular jazz and blues styles.

Tin Pan Alley also acted as another approach to modernism. This can be seen in the use of certain influences such as, &quot;a vernacular African-American impact coming from ragtime, &#x27;coon&#x27; songs, the blues and jazz&quot;, as well as &quot;input from high and middlebrow white culture&quot;. Many of these new styles were used to help fuel the economy of Tin Pan Alley, allowing composers to be more creative, as well as have a continuous influx of innovative music. 

==Influence on law and business==

A group of Tin Pan Alley music houses formed the Music Publishers Association of the United States on June 11, 1895, and unsuccessfully lobbied the federal government in favor of the Treloar Copyright Bill, which would have changed the term of copyright for published music from 24 to 40 years, renewable for an additional 20 instead of 14 years. The bill, if enacted, would also have included music among the subject matter covered by the Manufacturing clause of the International Copyright Act of 1891.

The American Society of Composers, Authors, and Publishers (ASCAP) was founded in 1914 to aid and protect the interests of established publishers and composers. New members were only admitted with sponsorship of existing members.

The term and established business methodologies associated with Tin Pan Alley persisted into the 1960s when artists like Bob Dylan helped establish new norms. Referring to the dominant conventions of music publishers of the early 20th century, &quot;Tin Pan Alley is gone&quot;, Dylan proclaimed in 1985, &quot;I put an end to it. People can record their own songs now.&quot;

==Contributions to World War II==
During the Second World War, Tin Pan Alley and the federal government teamed up to produce a war song that would inspire the American public to support the fight against the Axis, something they both &quot;seemed to believe ... was vital to the war effort&quot;. The Office of War Information was in charge of this project, and believed that Tin Pan Alley contained &quot;a reservoir of talent and competence capable of influencing people&#x27;s feelings and opinions&quot; that it &quot;might be capable of even greater influence during wartime than that of George M. Cohan&#x27;s &#x27;Over There&#x27; during World War I.&quot; In the United States, the song &quot;Over There&quot; has been said to be the most popular and resonant patriotic song associated with World War I. Due to the large fan base of Tin Pan Alley, the government believed that this sector of the music business would be far-reaching in spreading patriotic sentiments.

In the United States Congress, congressmen quarreled over a proposal to exempt musicians and other entertainers from the draft in order to remain in the country to boost morale. Stateside, these artists and performers were continuously using available media to promote the war effort and to demonstrate a commitment to victory. However, the proposal was contested by those who strongly believed that only those who provided more substantial contributions to the war effort should benefit from draft exemption.

As the war progressed, those in charge of writing the would-be national war song began to understand that the interest of the public lay elsewhere. Since the music would take up such a large amount of airtime, it was imperative that the writing be consistent with the war message that the radio was carrying throughout the nation. In her book, &quot;God Bless America: Tin Pan Alley Goes to War&quot;, Kathleen E. R. Smith writes that &quot;escapism seemed to be a high priority for music listeners&quot;, leading &quot;the composers of Tin Pan Alley [to struggle] to write a war song that would appeal both to civilians and the armed forces&quot;. By the end of the war, no such song had been produced that could rival hits like &quot;Over There&quot; from World War I.

Whether or not the number of songs circulated from Tin Pan Alley between 1939 and 1945 was greater than during the First World War is still debated. In his book &quot;The Songs That Fought the War: Popular Music and the Home Front&quot;, John Bush Jones cites Jeffrey C. Livingstone as claiming that Tin Pan Alley released more songs during World War I than it did in World War II. Jones, on the other hand, argues that &quot;there is also strong documentary evidence that the output of American war-related songs during World War II was most probably unsurpassed in any other war&quot;.

==Impact==

=== Landmark designation and co-naming ===
In 2019, the New York City Landmarks Preservation Commission took up the question of preserving five buildings on the north side of the street as a Tin Pan Alley Historic District. The agency designated five buildings (47–55 West 28th Street) individual landmarks on December 10, 2019, after a concerted effort by the &quot;Save Tin Pan Alley&quot; initiative of the 29th Street Neighborhood Association. Following successful protection of these landmarks, project director George Calderaro and other proponents formed the Tin Pan Alley American Popular Music Project.

On April 2, 2022, 28th Street between Broadway and 6th Avenue was officially co-named &quot;Tin Pan Alley&quot; by the City of New York.

=== In popular culture ===
*The Bob Geddins blues song &quot;Tin Pan Alley (AKA The Roughest Place in Town)&quot;, recorded by Jimmy Wilson, was a top 10 hit on the R&amp;B chart in 1953 and became a popular song among West Coast blues performers. The song was also covered by Stevie Ray Vaughan.
*In the 1970s to early 1980s, a Times Square bar named Tin Pan Alley, its owners, Steve d&#x27;Agroso and Maggie Smith, and many of its patrons were the real-life inspiration for the HBO series &quot;The Deuce&quot;. The bar was renamed The Hi-Hat in the series.
*The song &quot;Who Are You&quot; by The Who has the stanza &quot;I stretched back and I hiccupped / And looked back on my busy day / Eleven hours in the Tin Pan / God, there&#x27;s got to be another way&quot;, which references a long legal meeting with music publisher Allen Klein.
*The last lines in the Dire Straits song &quot;It Never Rains&quot; on the album &quot;Love Over Gold&quot;, refers to a woman in the entertainment industry being taken advantage of in &#x27;Vaudeville Valley&#x27; and Tin Pan Alley.

<text>The canton of Zurich is an administrative unit (canton) of Switzerland, situated in the northeastern part of the country. With a population of (as of ), it is the most populous canton of Switzerland. Zurich is the &quot;de facto&quot; capital of the canton, but is not specifically mentioned in the constitution. The official language is German. The local Swiss German dialect, called &quot;Züritüütsch&quot;, is commonly spoken.

The canton has the highest Human Development Index score (0.994) out of 1,790 subnational regions as of 2022, coming the closest to a perfect score of 1. It is also a global financial center and has the fourth-highest GRP in Switzerland behind Basel-Stadt, Zug and Geneva by GDP per capita.

==History==
===Early history===

The prehistoric pile dwellings around Lake Zurich, which are located around Lake Zurich in the cantons of Schwyz, St. Gallen and Zurich, make up a considerable portion of the 56 sites in Switzerland that are included in the UNESCO World Heritage Prehistoric pile dwellings around the Alps. Nine of these UNESCO World Heritage sites are located on the shore of Lake Zurich: Freienbach–Hurden Rosshorn, Freienbach–Hurden Seefeld, Rapperswil-Jona/Hombrechtikon–Feldbach, Rapperswil-Jona–Technikum, Erlenbach–Winkel, Meilen–Rorenhaab, Wädenswil–Vorder Au, Zürich–Enge Alpenquai and Kleiner Hafner. Because the lake has grown in size over time, the original piles are now around to under the water level of . Within an area of about around Lake Zurich, there also the settlements Greifensee–Storen/Wildsberg at the Greifensee and Wetzikon–Robenhausen at the Pfäffikersee. As well as being part of the 56 Swiss sites of the UNESCO World Heritage Site, each of these 11 prehistoric pile dwellings is also listed as a &quot;Class object&quot; in the Swiss inventory of cultural property of national and regional significance.

Zurihgauuia (Zürichgau) was a subdivision of Turgowe (Thurgau) in the Duchy of Alamannia, consisting roughly of the territory between Reuss and Töss. From the 740s, substantial portions of Zürichgau were owned by the Abbey of St. Gall. In , an administrative re-organisation under counts Ruthard and Warin exempted the castle town of Zurich from comital rule. A county of Zürichgau was established under Louis the Pious, for a count Ruadker, in 820. Zürichgau (&quot;Zurichgeuue&quot;) remained a nominally separate territory in the later 9th century but was often ruled by the same count as Thurgau. In 915, Zürichgau together with Thurgau fell to the Bucharding dukes of Swabia. In the late 10th century, the county of Zurich was ruled by the Nellenburger, and during 1077–1172 by the Lenzburger.

By the 13th century, Zürichgau was divided between the Habsburgs and the Kyburger, who held the territory west and east of Lake Zurich, respectively.

===City state===
The territory of the canton of Zurich corresponds to the lands acquired by the city of Zurich after it became &quot;reichsfrei&quot; in 1218. Zurich pursued a policy of aggressive territorial expansion especially during the century following the revolution of the guilds in 1336. Zurich joined the Swiss Confederacy in 1351.
Zurich claimed and lost the Toggenburg in the Old Zürich War of the 1440s. The northern parts up to the river Rhine came to the canton after the city of Zurich purchased Winterthur from the Habsburgs in 1468. 
In 1651, Zurich purchased Rafzerfeld from the counts of Sulz. At this point, almost all of the territory of the modern canton (as well as some territories beyond its modern borders) was owned by Zurich; exceptions include Wülflingen (acquired 1760), Buch (acquired 1761), Dietikon, which was a condominium, and Rheinau (owned by Rheinau Abbey).

In the 18th century, the &quot;inner bailiwicks&quot; (&quot;Innere Vogteien&quot;) were under direct administration of city officials, while the &quot;outer bailiwicks&quot; (&quot;Äussere Vogteien&quot;) were ruled by the reeves of Kyburg, Grüningen, Greifensee, Eglisau, Regensberg, Andelfingen, Wädenswil, and Knonau. The city of Winterthur was nominally subject to Zurich but retained far-reaching autonomy.

&quot;Zürichgau&quot;, the name of the medieval &quot;pagus&quot;, was in use for the territories of the city of Zurich during the 15th and 16th century; the term &quot;canton&quot; (&quot;Kanton&quot;) gradually entered use in the 16th century, but &quot;Zürichgau&quot; remained widely used well into the 19th century (becoming obsolescent after the formation of the modern canton in 1831).

Under the short-lived Helvetic Republic (1798–1803), the canton of Zurich became a purely administrative division. In 1803, some former possessions of Zurich to the west gained independence as part of the Canton of Aargau. In 1804 the Kantonspolizei Zürich was established as &quot;Landjägerkorps&quot; (rural police).

===Modern canton===
A cantonal constitution was drawn up in 1814 and replaced in 1831 by a radical-liberal constitution. The Züriputsch, an armed uprising of the conservative rural population against the radical-liberal order, led to the dissolution of the cantonal government, and a provisional conservative government was installed by colonel Paul Carl Eduard Ziegler.
Under the threat of intervention of the other radical-liberal cantons of the Confederacy, the provisional government declared that the 1831 constitution would remain in effect. In a tumultuous session on 9 September 1839, the cantonal parliament declared its dissolution 
In the so-called &quot;Septemberregime&quot;, the newly elected cantonal government replaced all cantonal officials with conservatives, but it was again ousted by a radical-liberal election victory in 1844.

Alfred Escher was a member of the new cantonal parliament of 1844; he was elected to the cantonal government in 1848 and later in the same year into the first National Council under the new federal constitution. 
The radical-liberal era of 1844–1868 was dominated by the so-called &quot;System Escher&quot;, a network of liberal politicians and industrialists built by Alfred Escher. Escher governed the canton almost in monarchical fashion, and was popularly dubbed &quot;Alfred I.&quot; or &quot;Tsar of All Zurich&quot;. Escher controlled all cantonal institutions, at first with very little political opposition, expunging all trace of the conservative takeover of 1839. Under Escher, the city of Zurich rose to the status of economic and financial center it still retains.
Opposition against the dominance of &quot;Sytstem Escher&quot; increased after 1863. The cantonal government was accused to continue the system of aristocratic rule liberalism had claimed to abolish. The oppositional &quot;Democratic Movement&quot; was centered in Winterthur, led by mayor Johann Jakob Sulzer and publicist Salomon Bleuler. They succeeded in imposing the introduction of the direct democratic instrument of the popular initiative in 1865, which precipitated a revision of the cantonal constitution.
In April 1869, a new cantonal constitution was adopted by popular vote, introducing additional direct democratic elements and the popular election of both the cantonal government and the cantonal representatives in the federal Council of States. 
The new constitution also abolished the death penalty (the last execution by hanging in Zurich took place in 1810, the last public execution by guillotine in 1865), guaranteed freedom of religion and freedom of association and introduced progressive taxes.

In 1877, the Cantonal Laboratory Zurich was founded in order to regulate the quality of food and drinking water. The first cantonal chemist was Haruthiun Abeljanz, who was instrumental in setting up the new laboratory, moving it from an unpromising start in converted storage rooms to Lintheschergasse 10, which was located just behind the Pestalozziwiese, a memorial to Johann Heinrich Pestalozzi.

The Cantonal Bank was established in 1870 to regulate cantonal loans at fixed interest rates to farms and businesses.

A law of proportional representation was passed in 1916, favouring the rise of the Social Democrats. 
A proposal for the introduction of female suffrage was rejected in 1920; female suffrage was introduced on the municipal level in 1969 and on the cantonal level in 1970, shortly before its imposition by federal law, passed in 1971.

Economic growth continued in the 20th century. A first airport was built at Dübendorf in 1910, replaced by the international airport at Kloten in 1948. Rapid urbanisation expanded throughout the canton and beyond in the final decades of the 20th century, further accelerated by the S-Bahn from 1990, with only a few municipalities in Weinland, Knonaueramt and Oberland remaining out of easy commuting distance to the city.

The current constitution replaced the one of 1869 in January 2006.

The Antiquarische Gesellschaft in Zürich is an organization devoted to preserving the canton&#x27;s history, the Staatsarchiv Zürich houses the state archives.

==Geography==

The canton of Zurich is situated in the eastern part of the Swiss plateau. It is entirely within the drainage basin of the High Rhine.
It is characterized by Glacial landform and traversed by a series of rivers generally flowing south-east to north-west, listed west to east: Reuss, Reppisch, Sihl, Linth-Limmat (forming Lake Zurich), Glatt, Töss and Thur. The main lakes are the Lake Zurich (Linth-Limmat, 88 km2), Greifensee (Glatt, 8.4 km2) and Pfäffikersee (Glatt, 3.3 km2). Minor lakes include Türlersee (Limmat), Katzensee (Glatt), Hüttnersee (Sihl), Lützelsee (Limmat).

Its neighbouring cantons are Schaffhausen to the north, Aargau to the west, the cantons of Zug and Schwyz to the south and the cantons of Thurgau and St. Gallen to the east.

It also has an international border with the German district of Waldshut and though only for ) the district of Konstanz in Baden-Württemberg owing to its short border with Stemmer, an outlying hamlet belonging to the municipality which forms the small German enclave of Büsingen am Hochrhein.

The canton can be roughly divided into the city and lake, the Unterland in the northwest, the Oberland in the southeast, the Weinland and Winterthur in the northeast, and the Knonaueramt southwest of the Albis. The Zurich Metropolitan Area extends beyond the cantonal borders.

The canton has an area, , of . Of this area, 43.4% is used for agricultural purposes, while 30.7% is forested. Of the rest of the land, 20.1% is settled (buildings or roads) and 5.8% is unproductive land.

Most of the canton consists of shallow river valleys which drain towards the High Rhine to the north. Rafzerfeld is a territory north of the Rhine acquired by the canton in 1651. In the northwest and southeast of the canton the territory rises towards the Jura and Alps, respectively. The valley of the Linth leads into the Lake Zurich and continues as the Limmat. This valley is the most significant valley of the canton of Zurich. The valley of the Glatt originates in the Greifensee and is separated from the Limmat by ridges. The valley of the Töss is gorge-like. It is located in the east of the canton and is separated from the Toggenburg area in the canton of St. Gallen by a mountainous area.

The &quot;Hörnli&quot; (1133 m) is the highest elevation of this mountain ridge. The valley of the river Sihl is located in the west of the canton. In converges with the Limmat in the city of Zurich. The Sihl is separated from the lake of Zurich by the &quot;Albis Range&quot;. The &quot;Albishorn&quot; () is the highest elevation of this range. 
The Schnebelhorn is a mountain located near Fischenthal in the Töss Valley, between the cantons of Zurich (west) and St. Gallen (east). It is the highest summit () of the canton of Zurich. The &quot;Uetliberg&quot; is part of the Albis Range. This mountain is popular with the population of the city of Zurich for recreation.

The vast majority of the canton lies to the south of the Rhine, the exceptions being Rafzerfeld as mentioned and a tiny portion of the village of Laufen-Uhwiesen called Nohl.

<doc id="245632" wikidata="Q211503" url="?curid=245632" title="Clan">
<text>A clan is a group of people united by actual or perceived kinship
and descent. Even if lineage details are unknown, a clan may claim descent from a founding member or apical ancestor who serves as a symbol of the clan&#x27;s unity. Many societies&#x27; exogamy rules are on a clan basis, where all members of one&#x27;s own clan, or the clans of both parents or even grandparents, are excluded from marriage as incest.

Clans preceded more centralized forms of community organization and government, and have existed in every country. Members may identify with a coat of arms or other symbol.

== Etymology ==
The English word &quot;clan&quot; is derived from old English word meaning &quot;children&quot;, &quot;offspring&quot;, &quot;progeny&quot; or &quot;descendants&quot;. According to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;, the word &quot;clan&quot; was introduced into English in around 1406, as a descriptive label for the organization of society in Ireland and the Scottish Highlands.

None of the Irish and Scottish Gaelic terms for kinship groups is cognate to English &quot;clan&quot;; Scottish Gaelic &quot;&quot; means &quot;children&quot;:
* &quot;&quot; means (English) &quot;clan&quot;
* &quot;&quot; means &quot;family&quot; in the sense of the nuclear family, or can include more distant relatives living in the same house
* &quot;&quot; means either &quot;family&quot; in the sense of &quot;household&quot;, or everyone who lives in the house, including non-relatives
* &quot;&quot; means &quot;family&quot; in the broad sense of &quot;kinsfolk&quot;
== Clans as political units ==
In different cultures and situations, a clan usually has different meaning than other kin-based groups, such as tribes and bands. Often, the distinguishing factor is that a clan is a smaller, integral part of a larger society such as a tribe, chiefdom, or a state. In some societies, clans may have an official leader such as a chief, matriarch or patriarch; or such leadership role is performed by elders. In others, leadership positions may have to be achieved.

Examples include Irish, Scottish, Chinese, Korean, and Japanese clans, which exist as distinct social groupings within their respective nations. Note, however, that tribes and bands can also be components of larger societies. The early Norse clans, the , are often translated as &quot;house&quot; or &quot;line&quot;. The Biblical &quot;tribes&quot; of Israel were composed of many clans. Arab clans are sub-tribal groups within Arab society. Native American and First Nations peoples, often referred to as &quot;tribes&quot;, also have clans. For instance, Ojibwa bands are smaller parts of the Ojibwa people or tribe in North America. The many Native American peoples are distinguished by language and culture, and most have clans and bands as the basic kinship organizations. In some cases tribes recognized each other&#x27;s clans; for instance, both the Chickasaw and Choctaw tribes of the Southeast United States had fox and bear clans, who felt a kinship that reached beyond their respective tribes.

Apart from these different historical traditions of kinship, conceptual confusion arises from colloquial usages of the term. In post-Soviet countries, for example, it is quite common to speak of &quot;clans&quot; in reference to informal networks within the economic and political sphere. This usage reflects the assumption that their members act towards each other in a particularly close and mutually supportive way, approximating the solidarity among kinsmen. Similar usage of the term applies to specific groups of various cultures and nationalities involved in organized crime. Polish clans differ from most others as they are a collection of families who bear the same coat of arms, as opposed to claiming a common descent (see Polish heraldry). There are multiple closely related clans in the Indian subcontinent, especially South India.

Romani people have many clans which are called &quot;vitsa&quot; in Romani.

=== Scottish Clans ===

Scottish clans are social groupings that have played a pivotal role in the history and culture of Scotland. Unlike some other clans that focus solely on common descent or a shared coat of arms, Scottish clans are unique in their elaborate systems of tartans, insignias, and mottos. Clan culture in Scotland also extends to community events such as clan gatherings and Highland Games. Each clan may have an official leader known as a &quot;Chieftain&quot; or &quot;Chief.&quot;

Members of Scottish clans often have a shared interest in preserving their historical and cultural landmarks, as well as the natural environment and wildlife of Scotland. The clan system in Scotland has also been influenced by key historical events like the Highland Clearances and the Jacobite uprisings, which have left lasting impacts on clan structures and Scottish diaspora.

===Clannism===
Clannism (in Somali culture, qabiilism) is a system of society based on clan affiliation.

The Islamic world, the Near East, North and the Horn of Africa in general, and Somali culture specifically, is patriarchal and traditionally centered on patrilineal clans or tribes.

<text>The Birmingham Thunderbolts were a short-lived springtime American football team based in Birmingham, Alabama. This team was part of the failed XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States.

==Opening Season==
The Thunderbolts played in the Eastern Division, with the Chicago Enforcers, Orlando Rage and the New York/New Jersey Hitmen. They finished the only year of XFL play – 2001 – in last place with the worst record in the league, at 2-8.

The Thunderbolts played their home games at Birmingham&#x27;s legendary Legion Field. They were coached by Brooklyn-native Gerry DiNardo, a former star player at the University of Notre Dame, and previously head coach at Vanderbilt University and Louisiana State University. Following the collapse of the XFL, he went on to coach at Indiana University. One of DiNardo&#x27;s assistants with the Thunderbolts was his predecessor at LSU, Curley Hallman, who was Brett Favre&#x27;s head coach for three seasons at the University of Southern Mississippi. Hallman also coached at Legion Field with the Alabama Crimson Tide during two stints as an assistant under Bear Bryant, Gene Stallings and Mike DuBose. 

The team&#x27;s colors were purple, yellow, and white. Their logo was a stylized &#x27;B&#x27; with six lightning bolts extending from it. On the teams helmets, the logo was placed at the front, instead of the customary position on each side, with only the upper three lightning bolts visible. The team was frequently referred to by fans and the media as simply the Bolts. Team merchandise almost always used the shortened Bolts moniker.

Allegedly, the league had originally planned to name the team the Blast; the XFL had named all of its teams with references to insanity and criminal activity, and the name &quot;Birmingham Blast&quot; likewise invoked images of the 1963 bombing of the 16th Street Baptist Church and of Eric Rudolph&#x27;s 1998 bombing of a local abortion clinic, two tragic events in Birmingham history. As the league soon realized that such a name would have been in extremely poor taste, at the last minute the league changed it to &quot;Thunderbolts,&quot; or &quot;Bolts&quot; for short. The team&#x27;s logo is said to be the same one originally designed for the Blast. The Thunderbolts were unusual in that their nickname was benign.

While XFL players were encouraged to use nicknames instead of their last names on the backs of their jerseys, DiNardo, who earned a reputation as a strict disciplinarian during his college coaching stops, banned Thunderbolts players from doing so.

After losing the opening game to the Memphis Maniax, the Thunderbolts posted wins over the Chicago Enforcers and the New York/New Jersey Hitmen. These would ultimately become the only victories the Thunderbolts would ever see. The Bolts would finish with a 2-8 record.

Birmingham went through all 3 quarterbacks during the season. Former Florida State quarterback Casey Weldon was signed as the starter. Former University of Alabama quarterback Jay Barker was signed as the backup, despite the crowds (averaging only 17,000 fans a game, second-lowest in the league) chanting his name during the home games. Barker (who became much more famous when he married country singing star Sara Evans in 2007) would become the starter after Weldon injured his shoulder. Barker suffered a concussion in Chicago when he collided with Enforcers&#x27; cornerback Ray Austin while attempting a bootleg run on a broken play. He was replaced by third string QB Graham Leigh.

NBC dropped the XFL after the first (2001) season due to dismal ratings, and the league was disbanded shortly thereafter.

==Post-XFL developments==
After the league folded, head coach Gerry DiNardo joined the staff of Birmingham sports talk radio station WJOX 690, as did Jay Barker, who also did sports commentary on local CBS TV affiliate WIAT channel 42. Barker currently hosts &quot;The Opening Drive&quot; on WJOX 94.5 in Birmingham with Tony Kurre and former NFL kicker Al Del Greco.

DiNardo returned to his college football coaching roots in 2002 as the head coach of the Indiana Hoosiers football team. The team was sometimes jokingly nicknamed &quot;The Fighting DiNardos&quot; in his honor. He was fired at the end of the 2004 season. He is currently a studio analyst for the Big Ten Network.

The Thunderbolts were the last playing stop for defensive back Anthony Blevins, after the team folded, Blevins went into coaching at first the high school, then college and NFL levels. In 2023, Blevins was named the head coach of the Vegas Vipers of the re-established XFL becoming one of the only links between the new XFL and the original one.

<text>The Chicago Enforcers were an American football team of the XFL based at Soldier Field in Chicago, Illinois. The XFL was begun by Vince McMahon of the WWE and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. NBC dropped XFL broadcasts after the first season in 2001 due to dismal ratings, and the league was dissolved shortly thereafter.

The team name references mob enforcers, alluding to Chicago&#x27;s history of mafia influence. The team&#x27;s fight song would later become the entrance music for professional wrestler Brock Lesnar who had signed a contract with the WWE but was yet to debut.

The &quot;Chicago Enforcers&quot; name is used by the Chicago Police Department for their works team in the National Public Safety Football League.

==2001 season==

Originally, rumors swirled that former Chicago Bears defensive coordinator and Philadelphia Eagles head coach Buddy Ryan would be hired as the team&#x27;s coach. Ultimately, Hall of Fame linebacker Dick Butkus was hired for the position. However, just before the season started, he resigned to take a position in the XFL office. He was replaced by Ron Meyer, a former NFL head coach from the 1980s who had not coached professional football since 1994 with the Las Vegas Posse.

Among their players was former NFL running back LeShon Johnson, who had played for the Green Bay Packers, Arizona Cardinals and the New York Giants and was a finalist for the 1993 Heisman Trophy. He was starting tailback for the Cardinals for most of 1996. He led the Enforcers with 6 rushing touchdowns, which was second in the league. They also had former NFL running back John Avery who played for the Miami Dolphins. Their wide receiver/kick returner Roell Preston (who previously played for the Atlanta Falcons, Green Bay Packers, Miami Dolphins, San Francisco 49ers, and Tennessee Titans) held the distinction of being the only former Pro Bowler (1998 as a Packer) to play in the XFL. The team&#x27;s starting right guard, Bennie Anderson, went on to be a starter for the Baltimore Ravens and Buffalo Bills, and last played professional football in 2006 for the Miami Dolphins.

The Enforcers got off to a slow start, losing their first four games with Tim Lester; at the time, Lester was working as a math teacher and assistant football coach at Wheaton Warrenville South High School in the suburbs of Chicago and played for the Enforcers effectively as a semi-professional player. In week 5, the team replaced Lester with the former Notre Dame Quatrerback Kevin McDougal, cut Lester, and brought in Craig Whelihan (an established NFL backup who had been third string on the Memphis Maniax at the time) to serve as McDougal&#x27;s backup. The team went 5–1 in the rest of the season (winning their last four in a row), coming from behind to make the XFL playoffs at 2nd place in the Eastern Division. In addition to their potent rushing attack led by league leading running back John Avery, they were also known for their hard hitting defense. They lost to eventual XFL champion Los Angeles Xtreme in the crossover semifinals.

The Enforcers were part of the Eastern Division with the Orlando Rage, New York/New Jersey Hitmen and the Birmingham Thunderbolts. Their radio flagship station was WMVP, ESPN Radio 1000.

Poor attendance and the pending renovation of Soldier Field would have meant that, even if the league had continued, the Enforcers would have not; the league was exploring relocating the team to Milwaukee at the time of the league&#x27;s closure.

<text>The Memphis Maniax were an American football team based in Memphis, Tennessee. The team was part of the XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. Home games were played at Liberty Bowl Memorial Stadium.

==History==
The team&#x27;s name and logo were designed to lead the team&#x27;s fans into calling the team &quot;The Ax&quot;, a shortened form of the word &quot;maniacs&quot;.

The Maniax Director of Player Personnel was Steve Ortmayer, who had become respected in the pro football world for helping to build the Super Bowl XVIII-champion Los Angeles Raiders. Steve Ehrhart, who had managed both the Memphis Showboats and Memphis Mad Dogs, returned as general manager for the Maniax. The head coach was Kippy Brown.

At slightly over 20,000 fans per game, the Maniax were in the lower half of league average attendance; this figure was higher than the Mad Dogs had drawn, and comparable to that of the NFL&#x27;s Tennessee Oilers during their lone season in Memphis, but lower than the Showboats.

They were in the Western Division with the Los Angeles Xtreme, San Francisco Demons, and Las Vegas Outlaws. They finished tied for second place at 5-5 with the Demons, but did not make the playoffs as the Demons had the better division record during the season. The Maniax were one of two teams to beat the eventual league champion Xtreme, and the only team to beat them twice, going 2-0 vs. their divisional rivals in the regular season; not coincidentally, they, along with the Xtreme and Demons, were the only three XFL teams to maintain the same starting quarterback through the entire season.

NBC officials wanted to move the XFL games to afternoons after the first season (2001) due to dismal ratings, and when, somewhat to McMahon&#x27;s surprise and disappointment the United Paramount Network (UPN) wanted to follow suit, the league was then folded and the team disbanded.

Ehrhart would later claim that he was originally approached by the XFL to sell the intellectual property rights of the United States Football League to them, but that he owned the rights to the league, received royalties from them, and refused to sell. (Ehrhart&#x27;s claims are somewhat dubious as he never held any ownership stake in the league, the original XFL had an Attitude Era aesthetic which did not match the brands the USFL had, and the United States Patent and Trademark Office has never recognized any claims from any vestige of the USFL, which dissolved in 1990, regarding the league&#x27;s intellectual properties and has allowed other organizations to register the trademarks.)

<doc id="245646" wikidata="Q7103167" url="?curid=245646" title="Orlando Rage">
<text>The Orlando Rage was an American football team based in Orlando, Florida as part of the XFL, begun by Vince McMahon of the World Wrestling Federation and by NBC, a major television network in the United States.

==History==

The team&#x27;s colors were scarlet, yellow, navy blue and white with jersey numbers in a unique jagged font. They played their home games at Orlando&#x27;s Florida Citrus Bowl, which was configured so that the upper deck was closed off and all fans were seated in the lower bowl to give a better appearance for television (a move that was effective, as the Rage had one of the stronger fan bases in the league, with average attendance at over two-thirds of the lower bowl&#x27;s capacity; the team sold out all 36,000 lower bowl seats for its home opener). The team&#x27;s General Manager was Tom Veit a former Major League Soccer Vice-president and were coached by former Florida Gators head coach Galen Hall. They were in the XFL&#x27;s Eastern Division with the NY/NJ Hitmen, Chicago Enforcers and Birmingham Thunderbolts.

The Rage were one of the two teams who opted not to don nicknames on the back of their jerseys. In the Rage&#x27;s case, the decision was made by a majority vote of the players (despite the objections of starting quarterback Jeff Brohm, who openly embraced the XFL&#x27;s approach to sports entertainment and wanted to wear &quot;J Bro&quot; on his jersey).

Jeff Brohm, at the time also under contract to the Cleveland Browns, was the quarterback of the Rage for most of the regular season, amassing a 6–0 record as starter during his first time at the helm. The team looked to be the league&#x27;s powerhouse franchise under Brohm and was on pace for a perfect season (coincidentally, Orlando&#x27;s next professional football team, the Florida Tuskers, would also win their first six games in a row before losing the seventh). He showed his toughness after he suffered an injury from a devastating hit by at the hands of Memphis Maniax defensive end Shante Carver in Week 5. Despite suffering a concussion in the hit and doctors&#x27; advice not to play, Brohm came back a week later against Las Vegas, giving a rousing speech stating that he was returning because it was the XFL and he still had a pulse. The following week he suffered a shoulder injury against the Los Angeles Xtreme and his season (and playing career) was done for good. It led to him being replaced by Brian Kuklick after six games. While Kuklick filled in the role of quarterback acceptably, the team lost a valuable leader on offense. The team went 2–2 in Kuklick&#x27;s care; Kuklick, despite only starting four games, led the league in interceptions with 10.

The team finished their only regular season with an 8–2 record, the best in the league, but were upset in the first round of the playoffs by the 5–5 San Francisco Demons. Orlando had an early 16–0 advantage but allowed San Francisco to pull ahead and take a 26–16 lead by the fourth quarter. Using the XFL&#x27;s newly introduced three-point conversion rule on a subsequent touchdown, the Rage got within one point but the Demons successfully ran out the clock and won 26–25. San Francisco would go on to lose the XFL Championship Game versus Los Angeles 38–6. Many in the league were disappointed, hoping for a match-up against the two division champions. NBC dropped the XFL after the first season (2001) due to dismal ratings, and the league folded soon afterward.

===XFL returns to Florida===

In December 2018, the revival of the XFL announced that it would return to Florida. Because the Alliance of American Football&#x27;s Orlando Apollos already laid claim to the Orlando market, the XFL opted to place the new team in Tampa, Florida, southwest of Orlando and connected to that city by way of Interstate 4. The league was exploring relocating the Vipers to Orlando shortly before the league suspended operations and went bankrupt in April 2020. In 2022, the league, under new ownership, announced that the New York Guardians would relocate to Orlando as the Orlando Guardians. The team took the field on February 18, 2023. Following the XFL merger with the USFL that was the last season in Orlando

<doc id="245650" wikidata="Q470364" url="?curid=245650" title="Caodaism">
<text>Caodaism (; ; Mandarin: , ) or Cao Đài is a Vietnamese monotheistic syncretic religion that retains many elements from Vietnamese folk religion such as ancestor worship, as well as &quot;ethical precepts from Confucianism, occult practices from Taoism, theories of karma and rebirth from Buddhism, and a hierarchical organization from Roman Catholicism&quot;. It was officially established in the city of Tây Ninh in Southern Vietnam in 1926.

The full name of the religion is  ( &#x27;The Great Faith [for the] Third Universal Redemption&#x27;).

Adherents engage in practices such as prayer, veneration of ancestors, nonviolence, and vegetarianism with the goal of union with God and freedom from saṃsāra. Estimates of the number of Caodaists in Vietnam vary; government figures estimate 4.4 million Caodaists affiliated to the Cao Đài Tây Ninh Holy See, with numbers rising up to 6 million if other branches are added. 

The United Nations found about 2.5 million Cao Dai followers in Vietnam as of January 2015. An additional number of adherents in the tens of thousands, primarily ethnic Vietnamese, live in North America, Cambodia, Europe and Australia as part of the Cao Dai diaspora.
==History==
Adherents maintain that Ngô Văn Chiêu, a district head of the French administration in Cochinchina, was the first to worship and receive messages from Cao Đài in 1921. He received a vision of the Divine Eye which is now the symbol for Cao Đài as well as the focus for worship on all Cao Đài altars.

Adherents maintain that on Christmas Eve 1925, God identified himself to the first group of Cao Đài mediums, which included Phạm Công Tắc, Cao Quỳnh Cư and Cao Hoài Sang. These three figures were to play an essential role in the growing religion as the three founding spirit mediums of the Hiệp Thiên Đài or &quot;Palace Uniting Heaven and Earth&quot;. Phạm Công Tắc was the head spirit medium or (&quot;Defender of the Dharma), while Cao Quỳnh Cư was the (his Sacred Assistant) and Cao Hoài Sang was the (his Secular Assistant).

On 7 October 1926, Lê Văn Trung (a former elected official of the Colonial Council of Cochinchina and a member of the ), and a leading group of 27 Caodaists, the first disciples of Cao Đài, signed the &quot;Declaration of the Founding of the Cao Đài Religion&quot; and presented it to the French Governor of Cochinchina. The Cao Đài faith brought together a number of once underground sects into a new national religion.

Officially called the &quot;Great Way of the Third Time of Redemption&quot; (), it became popular in its first few decades, gathering over a million members and converting a fifth to a fourth of the population of Cochinchina by 1940.
Ngô Văn Chiêu, who had never intended Cao Đài to become a mass organization, left the movement and eventually established in 1932 an independent, esoteric branch known as Chiếu Minh, headquartered in Vĩnh Long, which still exists and only admits a limited number of committed adepts.

In the 1930s, the leader criticized the French colonial regime, though he also emphasized dialogue with the French. This stance was controversial, and contrasted with the liturgy of dozens of &quot;dissident&quot; branches of Caodaism that followed a more Taoist model.

During the First and Second Indochina Wars, members of Cao Đài (along with several other Vietnamese sects, such as Hòa Hảo) were active in political and military struggles against both French colonial forces and South Vietnamese Prime Minister Ngô Đình Diệm, who later became president.

Their criticism of the communist forces until 1975 was a factor in their repression after the fall of Saigon in April 1975, when the incoming communist government banned the practice of Caodaism. In 1997, Caodaism was granted legal recognition and unrestricted practice once again.

==Religious mission==

The official name of the Cao Đài religion (or Caodaism) is . Translated directly it means &quot;The Third Great Universal Religious Amnesty&quot; ( – &quot;Great Faith&quot;, – &quot;Third Period&quot;, – &quot;to announce&quot; and – &quot;to save&quot;).

According to Cao Đài&#x27;s dogma, this Third Period will be of intense religious activity which will unite God and humanity in ways not yet imagined. Cao Đài also states that the Third Amnesty will establish a new great faith for the salvation of living beings before the universal destruction. The primary objective of the Third Amnesty is the unity of all religions, which will bring mankind together in a universal family for universal peace.

Caodaism teaches that, throughout human history, God the Father has revealed his truth many times through the mouths of many prophets, but these messages were always either ignored or forgotten due to humanity&#x27;s susceptibility to secular desires. Adherents believe that the age has now come when God speaks to humanity directly.

In the nineteenth century, Spiritism became established in Europe. The likes of Madam Blavatsky, Allan Kardec and Victor Hugo championed new religious possibilities. In Vietnam, the age-old traditions of Asian divination and mediumship began to mix with the new traditions of European Spiritism.

To highlight this objective of unity, there is a representation of the Divine Covenant of The Third Amnesty (The Third Alliance) inside every Cao Đài Temple. This Covenant between Heaven and Earth is written and presented to humanity by the Venerable Saints Victor Hugo, Sun Yat Sen, and Trạng Trình Nguyễn Bỉnh Khiêm. Their mission is said to guide humanity into the way of the Third Amnesty. The Covenant is written in French: ; and in Chinese: . This translates into English as: &quot;God and Humanity [for] Love and Justice.&quot;

==Theology and theosophy==
===God===

&quot;Cao Đài&quot; refers to God the Father (also known as the Supreme Being, Creator, and &quot;Ultimate Reality of the Universe,&quot; as well as the Ngọc Hoàng). , as God&#x27;s full title, indicates a combination of three religions—namely, Confucianism, Taoism, and Mahayana Buddhism—that significantly influenced Caodaist theology.
; : literally means &quot;High Tower/Palace&quot; (that is, the place where God reigns over the universe) represents Confucianism.

; : is the largest rank in Taoism.

; : literally means Great Bodhisattva the Great Being (Mahasattva) in Buddhism.
Together, they represent not only the unification of the three main religions but also the humility of God who presents himself as the lowest rank of Divinity.

According to Caodaism, God permeates all things in the Universe, both living and inanimate, reminiscent of Panentheism. It is believed that part of God&#x27;s spirit is within all people and creatures.

God has many different names depending on each person&#x27;s worldview.

Caodaism posits that all religions are derived from the same source; it is a pluralist theology. The unique name for the Caodaist deity is intended to capture the development of God&#x27;s revelation throughout evolutionary history: Cao Đài Tiên Ông Đại Bồ Tá Ma Ha Tát, Chaos, Taoism, Ông Trời, Thượng Đế, Đấng Sáng Tạo, Allah, Tathāgata, Atenism, Brahma, Yahweh, Great Spirit, God of the gaps, &quot;Waheguru&quot;, etc.

===Cosmology===

Caodaists adopt the traditional Chinese idea of (yin) and (yang) duality constituting the harmonious balance of the universe. Before the creation of the universe there was the &quot;dao&quot;, the infinite, nameless, formless, unchanging, eternal source. The negative and positive principles of the universe are the components of the eternal nature.

There are two main Gods, the (&quot;Highest Lord&quot;) and the or (&quot;Holy Buddha Mother&quot;). They represent respectively the yang and yin forces. is viewed as the heart of the universe, the common Father of all beings. He imparts part of him into each living being, including even rocks, in the form of consciousness. is venerated as the Mother of the universe, responsible for giving visible forms, consciousness and emotions to all life. Ultimately, she has to follow the orders of , who is revered as the Supreme Being of both Heaven and Earth.

All other Divine Beings are to obey the orders of these two Creators during the course of evolution of the universe. Each of them carries a specific role as designated by their Father and Mother. Any being who falls out against them is considered devils in nature. These devils are led by the most powerful being, named Kim Quang Sứ (Satan).

In terms of the cosmos, faithful Caodaists believe there are heaven and hell, which are the main destinations for souls after death. Heaven consists of thirty six planes and many heavenly realms upon each of them, e.g. the &quot;Realm of Saints&quot;, the &quot;Realm of the Holy Mother&quot;, the &quot;Realm of the Perfect Beings&quot;, the &quot;Divine Court Realm&quot;, the &quot;Paradise of Extreme Joy&quot;, etc. Meanwhile, hell has ten key realms to carry out punishments in accordance with sins of souls.

In order to go to heaven, souls are required to cultivate their virtues and / or devote themselves to spiritual causes. Without merit from the latter, they cannot escape the cycle of birth and death, but can improve their virtues and merit gradually to reach better places in the universe, including the 72 planets (Earth being the 68th), the 3,000 worlds, the four great cosmic regions, and the thirty six heavenly planes. True liberation can only be attained when souls ultimately rejoin God the Father in Heaven.

===Three-fold revelation===
The father of the universe, Cao Đài, is believed to have communed with men since the beginning of times, revealing his will. According to Cao Đài doctrine, history is divided into three times () of revelation. In the first two periods, there were teachings of Dipankara Buddha, sages, Phục Hy / Fu Xi, Gautama Buddha, Laozi, Confucius and Jesus, who received the will of the Highest Power, and founded their respective religions to serve and / or educate humanity. However, due to the frailty of the messengers and the common men, the will of the Highest Power was misled into corrupted forms. Caodaists also believe that former revelations were culture-bound, being applicable only for certain ethnicities, and primarily intended for specific ages. The third and final form of revelation is disclosed through the teachings of the Cao Đài faith.

===Twelve-fold hierarchy===
Caodaists believe that there are various ranks of divine spirits: (&quot;Holy Spirits&quot;), (&quot;saints&quot;), (&quot;Immortals&quot;), and (&quot;Buddhas&quot;). Each of these ranks can be further divided in the three grades of (Heavenly), (Human) and (Earthly), forming a twelve-fold hierarchy that reflects the twelve-fold earthly hierarchy of the Caodaist church. Below those ranks are the spirits of matters, plants, animals and humans. All spirits may evolve to attain higher rank based on present deeds. Disembodied spirits fulfill a number of roles: they are benefactors of mankind, messengers and instructors of the truth. Quan Âm is regarded as the exemplary goddess of the Buddhas, Lý Bạch (Li Bai) of the Immortals, and Quan Vũ (Guan Yu) of the Saints.

The Cao Đài pantheon counts three main prophets, as illustrated on a plaque at the entrance of the Tay Ninh Temple: Victor Hugo (to please the French), since he gave many teachings and also the text of a number of important prayers. He himself practiced spiritism on the island of Jersey from 1852 to 1855, and predicted that he would become the prophet of a new religion to merge European and Asian mysticism. Sun Yat-sen (for the Chinese) and Trạng Trình, the Vietnamese Nostradamus (for the Vietnamese).

==Fundamental rules and values==
The doctrines of the Cao Đài faith tends not only to reconcile all religious views, but also to adapt itself to all degrees of spiritual evolution. A basic principle of Caodaism is &quot;All Religions are One&quot;. Cao Đài has been described from five different points of view:
# From a moral point of view, Cao Đài Religion reminds people of their duties towards themselves, their family, their society (a broader family), then toward humanity (the universal family).
# From a philosophical point of view, Cao Đài Religion preaches renunciation of honors, riches and luxury, in other words, deliverance from servitude to materialism in the attainment of full spiritual quietude of soul.
# From the point of view of worship, Cao Đài Religion prescribes the adoration of God, the veneration of Divine Beings and the worship of ancestors.
# From a spiritual point of view, Cao Đài Religion confirms, in harmony with other religions, the existence of the spirits and the soul, their survival beyond the physical body, and their evolution by successive reincarnations, according to the Karmic Law.
# From the initiates&#x27; point of view, Cao Đài Religion communicates to worthy adherents and reveals teachings that enable them, by a process of spiritual evolution, to reach the ecstasies of happiness.

==Worship rituals==
Believers worship God the Father, Holy Mother, and the Divine Beings with all their heart. They also venerate the Great Religious Prophets of history and honour the ancestors.

There are four daily ceremonies, that is, at 06:00, Midday, 18:00, and midnight, either at the temple or in front of the home altar. Monthly rituals take place at midnight on the 1st and 15th days of the lunar month. There is also a special anniversary ceremony once a year for God the Father, the Holy Mother, the five founders of the world&#x27;s major religions, and the founders of the Cao Dai religion.
The rituals differ between places, depending on who they pray to.
; At the Holy See: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer to the Ngọc Hoàng (God the Father), prayer to Dipankara Buddha (Buddhism), prayer to Thái Thượng Lão Quân or Taishang Laojun (Taoism), prayer to Confucius (Confucianism), one of the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges.
; At the Holy Mother temple: Prayers include incense offering, ceremony opening, prayer describing the role of the Holy Mother, prayer to express gratitude to the Holy Mother, one of the three jewel offering prayers (flower, wine, and tea), and the five pledges.
There are also differences between monthly rituals, and anniversary ones.

Ceremonial prescriptions such as actions, dress and music were organized in detail by God the Father. These include ceremonies for initiations, marriages and funerals. Particular attention is paid to death, and it has been revealed to the religion how the soul journeys towards heaven and how, on earth, co-religionists can pray for souls to help them on their way.

==Symbols==
The Caodaism Holy See, Caodaism Temples, and religious buildings host a rich array of symbols, all of which are instructed by either God the Father or Divine Beings. No symbol is redundant, and none is meaningless. They each tell a different story that reveals the beliefs, values, cosmic secrets, prophecies, etc. When combined, they lay out the journey of the Tao throughout the history of mankind and the universe, as well as its way forward.

===The Divine Eye===

In spirit and in pictorial representation, the Eye serves to remind Cao Đài believers that the God witnesses everything, everywhere, constantly. At the Holy See, there are in total 50 Divine Eyes of five different shapes; each carrying a different meaning related to various spiritual aspects. The One on the globe shows the Supreme Being above the North Star in the Ursa Minor constellation. The One on the façade of the Holy See has 35 rays of light which represent the three major religions and five main religious doctrines of the world. At the local Cao Đài Temples, the Divine Eye has 16 rays of light emanating from it. Nine radiate upward representing the nine levels of heaven, and seven radiating downward representing the seven emotions, which believers must control.

===The religious banner and emblem===
In accordance with the religious mission, the three colors of Cao Đài banner represent the three main non-Hinduistic Asian religions of the world; yellow stands for Buddhism, blue for Taoism, and red for Confucianism. Under the Divine Eye is the religious emblem which also represents the essence of the three religions; the bowl of charity for Buddhist compassion and asceticism, the feather duster for Taoist purification; the Spring and Autumn Annals for Confucianist virtue and love.

==Scriptures==
There are various Caodaist scriptures. Some of those belonging to the Holy See of Tây Ninh are: &quot;Kinh Thiên Đạo Và Thế Đạo&quot; (&quot;Prayers of the Heavenly and the Earthly Way&quot;), &quot;Pháp Chánh Truyền&quot; (&quot;the Religious Constitution of Cao Đài Religion&quot;), &quot;Tân Luật&quot; (&quot;The Canonical Codes&quot;), and &quot;Con Đường Thiêng Liêng Hằng Sống&quot; (&quot;Divine Path to Eternal Life&quot;). Other sects have additional scriptures.

===The Canonical Codes===
This scripture sets out the rules and boundaries for different aspects of the religion, from a believer to the Pope, from education to marriage, etc. There are ten sections in the scripture with the following content:
# Hierarchy of religious dignitaries
# Initiation and ranks of believers
# Establishment of a parish
# The five interdictions
# The four commandments
# Education
# Sanctions
# Promulgation of laws and regulations
# Secular rules
# The house of meditation

===The Religious Constitution===
The &quot;Pháp Chánh Truyền&quot; (The Religious Constitution of Caodaism) was delivered to the religion as a series of divine messages. These are the guiding texts of the religion&#x27;s organisation, stipulating the authority, responsibility, limits, as well as religious vestment for each rank in the religion.

==Organisational structure==

The organisational structure of the Caodaist church has similarities with that of a state. There are similarities between the hierarchy of the Caodaist clergy and that of the Catholic Church. Besides the Pope, the Caodaist hierarchy has Cardinals, Bishops, Priests, and further ranks.

Caodaism stresses equality among men and women in society. However, in the spiritual domain, ordained women may not attain the two highest positions: the Legislative Cardinal and the Pope. The church claims this is ordered by the Highest Lord, who declared that because &quot;Dương&quot; (Yang) represents male and &quot;Âm&quot; (Yin) corresponds to female, Yin cannot dominate Yang spiritually or else chaos ensues.

The Religion is governed by two powers, the spiritual and earthly ones.

The spiritual power (Bát Quái Đài): This is the heavenly council, that is, the Spirit and Soul of the New Religion. The council directs all activities of the universe. The council is the invisible part, made up of the Divine Beings, and directed by Duc Cao Dai (God the Father). The Divine Beings represent different religions of the world, including:
; Founders of five religions:
:* The Buddha (Buddhism),
:* Lao Tze (Taoism),
:* Confucius (Confucianism),
:* Jesus Christ (Christianity),
:* Jiang Ziya (Geniism).
; Founders and teachers of Caodaism: who represent the doctrines of Buddhism, Taoism, and Confucianism:
:* Guanyin (Buddhism),
:* Li Bai (Taoism),
:* Guan Yu (Confucianism).

The earthly power: To avoid dictatorship, God divided the earthly power into two bodies – an Executive Body (Cửu Trùng Đài) headed by the Pope, and a Legislative Body (Hiệp Thiên Đài) headed by the Hộ Pháp (Protector of Laws and Justice). The former takes charge of the administration of the Religion and its missionary activities, while the latter oversees legislation, jurisdiction and communication with God or Divine Beings. There is also the Charitable Body placed under the supervision of the Legislative Body, and a Lay Committee of selected professional specialists among worthy followers.

===The Executive Body (Cửu Trùng Đài)===
The &quot;Cửu Trùng Ðài&quot; is the Executive Body of Caodaism which takes charge of the administration of the Religion and missionary activities. Head of &quot;Cửu Trùng Ðài&quot; is &quot;Giáo-Tông&quot; (Pope).
There are nine ranks in its hierarchy:
For male dignitaries of the Executive Body, from the rank of Censor Cardinal to that of Student Priest, each echelon is subdivided into three branches corresponding to the three principal religions:
:; Buddhist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in yellow.
:; Taoist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in azure.
:; Confucianist Branch: These dignitaries are dressed in red.
Dignitaries of the same echelon, either Confucianist, Taoist or Buddhist, have the same attributes.

At the Holy See, there are three governing councils:
:; The Popular Council: composed of Student Priests, Sub-dignitaries, and representatives of adherents in the ratio of one delegate per 500 members. The Popular Council makes plans for the future.
:; The Sacerdotal Council: composed of Priests, Bishops, Archbishops, and Principal Archbishops. The Sacerdotal Council examines the plans made by the Popular Council.
:; The High Council: composed of Cardinals, Legislative Body Cardinals, and the Pope.
All plans made by the Popular Council and favoured by the Sacerdotal Council are submitted to High Council for approval.

In addition, there is also a Central Administration body chaired by three Cardinals. Each of them is assisted by three Principal Archbishops to oversee three religious ministries:
:; The Principal Archbishops of the Buddhist branch: take care of finances, supply, and public works.
:; The Principal Archbishops of the Taoist branch: take care of education, health, and agriculture.
:; The Principal Archbishops of the Confucianist branch: take care of interior, rites, and justice.

The administrative network which functions throughout Vietnam consists of:
:; The Religious Region (&quot;Trấn Đạo&quot;): comprising several provinces, headed by a Bishop who is called the Regional Religious Chief / Khâm Trấn Đạo.
:; The Religious Province (&quot;Châu Đạo&quot;): comprising several districts / delegations, headed by a Priest who is called Provincial Religious Chief / Khâm Châu Đạo.
:; The Religious District (&quot;Họ Đạo&quot;): comprising several villages, headed by a Student Priest who is called the Religious Chief of Delegation (&quot;Đầu Tộc Đạo / Đầu Họ Đạo / Đầu Phận Đạo&quot;).
:; The Religious Village (&quot;Hương Đạo&quot;): headed by a Sub-dignitary who is called Village Religious Chief (&quot;Đầu Hương Đạo&quot;). He is assisted by one (or more) &quot;Phó Trị Sự&quot; (Deputy Chief for Administration of a religious village) representing the Executive Body and one (or more) &quot;Thông Sự&quot; representing the Legislative Body. The Religious Village is made up of Religious Hamlets (&quot;Ấp Đạo&quot;).

=== Palace Uniting Heaven and Earth (Hiệp Thiên Đài) ===
This Body has the duty of communicating with Divine Beings, to preserve the religious laws and listen to the complaints of the unhappy. It is headed by the &quot;Hộ Pháp&quot; (Defender of the Dharma,protector of laws and justice), and assisted by the &quot;Thượng Phẩm&quot; (Director of religious affairs) and &quot;Thượng Sanh&quot; (Director of secular affairs).
; &quot;Hộ-Pháp&quot; (護法) (The head of Legislative Body Affairs): unveils the Mystery of the Invisible and is the Maintainer of the Rules and Laws of the New Religion. He is the one who pronounces judgments on the dignitaries and adepts, elevates the dignity of the fervent through their merit and brings sanctions against those who have committed faults. Defender of the Dharma holds control over the Legislative Body Power both exoterically and esoterically. He watches over the positive progress of the disciples in the Way of God, and guides all evolved souls to Bát-Quái-Đài for the union with Angels, Saints, Immortals and Buddhas.
; &quot;Thượng-Phẩm&quot; (上品) (The head of Religious Affairs): Representative of the Ho-Phap in the formation of virtuous souls of the Sacerdotal Council. He depends on the Hộ-Pháp in all his missions. In a word, the Thượng-Phẩm helps the Cửu Trùng Đài to live in an atmosphere of happiness; he reveals the Heavenly Voice to virtuous souls, and guides them to the Divine Phase of the Great Spirits, while closing behind them the door of regression. He considers the priestly laws to take up the defence of all office-bearers and adepts; he prevents all perversion of the Divine Rules, and helps all initiates to attain their aim. He is simultaneously the President of the Hall of Defence and protector of all disciples. The Thượng-Phẩm is &quot;Leader of the Spiritual Power&quot;.
; &quot;Thượng–Sanh&quot; (上生) (The head of Secular Affairs): has control of all the laws and rules which relate to the worldly life of all adepts to guide them out of the sea of sufferings. He may present a formal complaint before the religious Tribunal against all those who impede the faithful as they move along the Way of God. He is the President of the Hall of Accusation.

Four &quot;zodiacal dignitaries&quot; under each of these branches carry the four key responsibilities of conservation, renovation, reformation, and legislation. They are further assisted by twelve technical academicians, including Bảo Huyền Linh Quân (Theosophy), Bảo Tinh Quân (Astronomy), Bảo Cô Quân (Orphanage), Bảo Văn pháp quân (Culture), Bảo Học Quân (Education), Bảo Y Quân (Health), Bảo Vật Quân (Science and Industry, Bảo Sĩ Quân (Literature), Bảo Sanh Quân (Social work), Bảo Nông Quân (Agriculture), Bảo Công Quân (Public Works), Bảo Thương Quân (Economics).

==Community structure==
Any local area having more than 500 believers is authorized to establish a Parish (Họ Đạo/Tộc Đạo) with a Thánh-Thất (Temple, Church, Holy House) which is led by the authority of a dignitary.
Parishes can be established only with the permission and authority of the Giao-Tong/Pope.

Twice a month, the first and the fifteenth day of the lunar calendar, the believers must meet at the Thánh-Thất of the local area to attend the ceremony and listen to the teachings. Exception can be made for those with reasonable excuses.

==The Holy See==
Located north-west of Ho Chi Minh City (formerly Saigon) in Tây-Ninh Province is the Caodaist Holy See. At the centre of this city stands the Great Divine Temple. As well as being a major centre of pilgrimage, the Caodaism Holy See is also one of Vietnam&#x27;s major tourist attractions.

==Branches==
&quot;The period between 1934 and 1975 witnessed not only the robust development of the Cao Dai religion but also saw the separation of the Cao Dai religion into different independent sects, sometimes as many as 30&quot; As of July 2014, &quot;central and provincial authorities have granted legal recognition&quot; to 11 Cao Dai sects.

These sects generally divide along geographic lines. The largest is based in Tây Ninh Province, where the religion was founded in 1926 and where the seat of the Caodaist authority is located.

The Caodaist Executive Council of Tây Ninh Province received official government recognition in 1997. Independent Caodaist groups allege that government interference has undermined the independence of the Tây Ninh group, and it no longer faithfully upholds &quot;Cao Đài&quot;&#x27;s principles and traditions. Religious training takes place at individual temples rather than at centralized seminaries. Some Caodaist sects that have broken away from the Tây Ninh Holy See are Cầu Kho, Bến Tre, Minh Chơn Lý, Minh Chơn Đạo, Tiên Thiên, and Hội Thánh Truyền Giáo Trung Việt. Ngô Văn Chiêu founded Chiếu Minh when he left the original church structure, refusing his appointment as Caodaism&#x27;s first pope.

<text>The San Francisco Demons (originally named San Jose Demons) were a short-lived springtime American football team based in San Francisco, California. This team was part of the failed XFL begun by Vince McMahon of World Wrestling Entertainment and by NBC, a major television network in the United States. Originally they were to be based in San Jose but prior to the start of the season they were moved to San Francisco. They were in the Western Division with the Los Angeles Xtreme, Las Vegas Outlaws and Memphis Maniax.

The team played in Pacific Bell Park in San Francisco; despite having the smallest stadium in the league, they also had the highest average attendance (34,954). The fans had a cheering section nicknamed &quot;The Hellhole&quot;.

The team was coached by Jim Skipper, former running backs coach for the New York Giants.

==History==
In their only season of existence, the Demons went 5-5 to capture 2nd place in the regular season and qualified for post season play. In the first round, the Demons defeated the Orlando Rage, who had the best regular season record (8-2), by a score of 26-25. In the XFL&#x27;s Million Dollar Game, which was the league championship game and last game in its history, the Demons were defeated by the Los Angeles Xtreme 38-6.

NBC dropped the XFL after the first season (2001) due to dismal ratings, and the league folded soon afterwards. The Demons played their home games in what was then Pacific Bell Park, now Oracle Park, the home of Major League Baseball&#x27;s San Francisco Giants.

The most notable Demons players were Mike Pawlawski and Pat Barnes. Both played quarterback for the Demons in 2001. Pawlawski and Barnes both played for the California Golden Bears. Pawlawski was signed by the Demons after playing Arena Football for the Albany Firebirds. Barnes had been invited to training camp by the Oakland Raiders.

<doc id="245653" wikidata="Q1683042" url="?curid=245653" title="Jasper Maskelyne">
<text>Jasper Maskelyne (29 September 1902 – 15 March 1973) was a British stage magician in the 1930s and 1940s. He was one of an established family of stage magicians, the son of Nevil Maskelyne and a grandson of John Nevil Maskelyne. He is most remembered for his accounts of his work for the British military during the Second World War, in which he claimed to have created large-scale ruses, deception, and camouflage in an effort to defeat the Nazis.

==Early life==
Maskelyne was born in Wandsworth, London, England in 1902, to magician Nevil Maskelyne and his wife Ada Mary Ardley.

==Career==
===Stage magician===

Maskelyne was a successful stage magician. His 1936 &quot;Maskelyne&#x27;s Book of Magic&quot; describes a range of stage tricks, including sleight of hand, card and rope tricks, and illusions of &quot;mind-reading&quot;.

In 1937, Maskelyne appeared in a Pathé film, &quot;The Famous Illusionist&quot;, in which he performed his well-known trick of appearing to swallow razor blades.

===Wartime service===


When the Second World War broke out, Maskelyne, believing his skills could be used for camouflage, joined the Royal Engineers. According to one account, he convinced skeptical officers, including inspector of training Viscount Gort, of his bona fides by camouflaging a machine gun position in plain sight and creating the illusion of the German warship &quot;Graf Spee&quot; on the Thames using mirrors and a model.

In 1940, Maskelyne was trained at the Camouflage Development and Training Centre at Farnham Castle. He found the training boring, asserting in his book that &quot;a lifetime of hiding things on the stage&quot; had taught him more about camouflage &quot;than rabbits and tigers will ever know&quot;. The camoufleur Julian Trevelyan commented that he &quot;entertained us with his tricks in the evenings&quot; at Farnham, but that Maskelyne was &quot;rather unsuccessful&quot; at actually camouflaging &quot;concrete pill-boxes&quot;.

Brigadier Dudley Clarke, the head of the &#x27;A&#x27; Force deception department, recruited Maskelyne to work for MI9 in Cairo. He created small devices intended to assist soldiers to escape if captured and lectured on escape techniques. These included tools hidden in cricket bats, saw blades inside combs, and small maps on objects such as playing cards.

Maskelyne was then briefly a member of Geoffrey Barkas&#x27;s camouflage unit at Helwan, near Cairo, set up in November 1941. He was made head of the subsidiary &quot;Camouflage Experimental Section&quot; at Abbassia. By February 1942, it became clear that this command was not successful, so he was &quot;transferred to welfare&quot;—in other words, to entertaining soldiers with magic tricks. Peter Forbes writes that the &quot;flamboyant&quot; magician&#x27;s contribution was

There are several references to Maskelyne supporting the work of British double agent Eddie Chapman. Maskelyne was involved in making the de Havilland factory complex appear to have been destroyed when viewed by German reconnaissance flights to help secure Chapman&#x27;s trust with the Germans. This included scattering what appeared to be damaged aircraft, damage to main structures and damage to the airstrip.

His nature was &quot;to perpetuate the myth of his own inventive genius, and perhaps he even believed it himself&quot;. However, Clarke had encouraged Maskelyne to take credit for two reasons: as cover for the true inventors of the dummy machinery and to encourage confidence in these techniques amongst Allied high command.

Maskelyne&#x27;s ghost-written book about his exploits, &quot;Magic: Top Secret&quot;, was published in 1949. Forbes describes it as lurid, with &quot;extravagant claims of cities disappearing, armies re-locating, dummies proliferating (even submarines)—all as a result of his knowledge of the magic arts&quot;. Forbes also notes that David Fisher, writing in his biography of Maskelyne, &quot;The War Magician&quot;, was &quot;clearly under the wizard&#x27;s spell&quot;. Maskelyne claimed in his book that his team produced

====Doubts raised====
According to magician Richard Stokes, Maskelyne&#x27;s role in the war was marginal, much of the information presented in the books &quot;Magic: Top Secret&quot; and &quot;War Magician&quot; is pure invention, and no unit called the &quot;Magic Gang&quot; ever existed. Stokes contextualised them within contemporary literary and military sources, and the recollections of Jasper Maskelyne’s surviving son, Alistair Maskelyne, in 21 articles from November 1997 to October 2005 for the Sydney-based &quot;Genii Magic Journal&quot;.

Christian House, reviewing Rick Stroud&#x27;s book &quot;The Phantom Army of Alamein&quot; in The Independent, describes Maskelyne as &quot;one of the more grandiose members&quot; of the Second World War desert camouflage unit and &quot;a chancer tasked with experimental developments, who fogged his own reputation as much as any desert convoy&quot;.

David Hambling, writing on Wired, critiques David Fisher&#x27;s uncritical acceptance of Maskelyne&#x27;s stories: &quot;A very colourful account of Maskelyne&#x27;s role is given in the book &quot;The War Magician&quot;—reading it you might think he won the war single-handed&quot;. Hambling denies Maskelyne&#x27;s supposed concealment of the Suez Canal: &quot;[I]n spite of the book&#x27;s claims, the dazzle light[s] were never actually built (although a prototype was once tested)&quot;.

In the book on World War II deception, &quot;Ghosts of the ETO&quot;, Jonathan Gawne argued that Maskelyne was not responsible for all the deception work he claimed and that Dudley Clarke deserved the lion&#x27;s share of credit. In 2002 &quot;The Guardian&quot; wrote: &quot;Maskelyne received no official recognition. For a vain man this was intolerable and he died an embittered drunk. It gives his story a poignancy without which it would be mere chest-beating&quot;.

==Later life and death==
After the war, Maskelyne resumed his magic career. In 1950, he moved to the African continent, where he developed his show into a touring performance that travelled between South Africa and British possessions in East Africa. He eventually settled in Nairobi, where he founded a successful driving school. During the Mau Mau Uprising, Maskelyne led a mobile squad of police. In addition, he managed the Kenya National Theatre. Maskelyne died in Nairobi on 15 March 1973.

==Family==
On 24 June 1926 Maskelyne married Evelyn Enid Mary Home-Douglas (died 24 March 1947), who had worked as a magician&#x27;s assistant in his stage show. They were the parents of two children, son Alistair (1927-2019) and daughter Jasmine (born 1928), who was known as &quot;Bobbie&quot;. On 11 March 1948 Maskelyne married Evelyne Mary Scotcher, who was known as Mary.

==Possible film adaptations==
In 2003, director Peter Weir and actor Tom Cruise were working on a film based on &quot;The War Magician&quot;. When questions rose about how much of &quot;The War Magician&quot; was factual and how much was invented by the author, the project was dropped while still in pre-production.

In 2015, Benedict Cumberbatch was reported as signing on to play the lead role in a Maskelyne film. At the time, the project was pending the selection of a director.

In 2021, it was announced that Colin Trevorrow would direct &quot;War Magician&quot;, with Cumberbatch as the star.

<text>Ramadi ( &quot;Ar-Ramādī&quot;; also formerly rendered as &quot;Rumadiyah&quot; or &quot;Rumadiya&quot;) is a city in central Iraq, about west of Baghdad and west of Fallujah. It is the capital and largest city of Al Anbar Governorate which touches on Syria, Jordan and Saudi Arabia. The city extends along the Euphrates which bisects Al Anbar. Founded by the Ottoman Empire in 1879, by 2018 it had about 223,500 residents, near all of whom Sunni Arabs from the Dulaim tribal confederation. It lies in the Sunni Triangle of western Iraq.

Ramadi occupies a highly strategic site on the Euphrates and the road west into Syria and Jordan. This has made it a hub for trade and traffic, from which the city gained significant prosperity. Its position has meant that it has been fought over several times, during the two World Wars and again during the Iraq War and Iraqi insurgency. It was heavily damaged during the Iraq War, when it was a major focus for the insurgency against occupying United States forces. Following the withdrawal of US forces from Iraq in 2011, the city was contested by the Iraqi government and the extremist group Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and fell to ISIL in May 2015. On 28 December 2015, the Iraqi government declared, confirming media testimonies, that it had re-taken Ramadi, that government&#x27;s first major military victory since its loss.

==Population and demography==
Ramadi&#x27;s population was reported by the World Food Programme to number 375,000 people in 2011, though the number is likely to have decreased since then given the impact of the Iraq war and insurgency. Its population grew rapidly during the last half of the 20th century, from 12,020 people in 1956 to 192,556 in 1987. The population is very homogeneous, over 90 per cent Sunni Arab. The vast majority of its population come from the Dulaim tribal confederation, which inhabits Syria and Jordan as well as Iraq and has over a thousand individual clans, each headed by a sheik selected by tribal elders.

==History==
Ramadi is located in a fertile, irrigated, alluvial plain, within Iraq&#x27;s Sunni Triangle. A settlement already existed in the area when the British explorer Francis Rawdon Chesney passed through in 1836 on a steam-powered boat during an expedition to test the navigability of the Euphrates. He described it as a &quot;pretty little town&quot; and noted that the black tents of the Bedouin could be seen along both banks of the river all the way from Ramadi to Fallujah. The modern city was founded in 1869 by Midhat Pasha, the Ottoman Wali (Governor) of Baghdad. The Ottomans sought to control the previously nomadic Dulaim tribe in the region as part of a programme of settling the Bedouin tribes of Iraq through the use of land grants, in the belief that this would bind them more closely to the state and make them easier to control.

Ramadi was described in 1892 as &quot;the most wide awake town in the whole Euphrates valley. It has a telegraph office and large government barracks. The bazaars are very large and well filled.&quot; Sir John Bagot Glubb (&quot;Glubb Pasha&quot;) was posted there in 1922 &quot;to maintain a rickety floating bridge over the river [Euphrates], carried on boats made of reeds daubed with bitumen&quot;, as he put it. By this time the Dulaim were mostly settled, though they had not yet fully adopted an urbanised lifestyle. Glubb described them as &quot;cultivators along the banks of the Euphrates, watering their wheat, barley and date palms by &quot;kerids&quot;, or water lifts worked by horses. Yet they had but recently settled, and still lived in black goat-hair tents.&quot; A British military handbook published during World War I noted that &quot;some European travellers have found the inhabitants of Rumadiyah [Ramadi] inclined to religious fanaticism&quot;.

===World Wars I and II===

Ramadi was twice fought over during the Mesopotamian Campaign of World War I. It was held initially by the forces of the Ottoman Empire, which garrisoned it in March 1917 after losing control of Fallujah to the east. The British Army&#x27;s Lieutenant General Frederick Stanley Maude sought to drive out the garrison in July 1917 but faced severe difficulties due to exceptional heat during both day and night. A force of around 600 British soldiers plus cavalry units faced 1,000 Turks with six artillery pieces. The attack was a costly failure and a combination of exhaustion, disorganisation, Turkish artillery fire and an unexpected sandstorm forced Maude to call off the attack with heavy losses. More than half of the 566 British casualties were caused by the heat.

Maude tried again during a cooler period in September 1917. This time the attacking force, led by Major General H.T. Brookings, was better organised and the British force was able to cope with the temperatures. The British mounted their attack from a direction that the Turks had not expected and managed to cut off their enemy&#x27;s line of retreat. Many members of the Turkish garrison were killed or forced to surrender and the British were able to take control of Ramadi.

Ramadi was contested again during World War II following the 1941 Iraqi coup d&#x27;état. The coup leader, Rashid Ali al-Gaylani, initiated a siege of the British base at RAF Habbaniya near Ramadi. This prompted a British counter-attack to break the siege, sparking the brief Anglo-Iraqi War. An Iraqi brigade occupied Ramadi under the auspices of a training exercise. The British assembled an &quot;ad hoc&quot; relief force dubbed &quot;Habforce&quot; which advanced from the British Mandate of Palestine into Iraq. The force succeeded in relieving RAF Habbaniya and Iraqi resistance rapidly crumbled as their counter-attacks were defeated, allowing a British column to seize control of Ramadi.

===Post-war===
The Ramadi Barrage was built near the city in 1955 to feed water into Lake Habbaniyah to the southeast. The University of Anbar was founded there in 1987 and, together with Ramadi&#x27;s trade and transport links, gave the city a more cosmopolitan, liberal and secular culture than others in the Sunni Triangle. Many high-ranking officials of the ruling Ba&#x27;ath Party came from Ramadi. Its local elites were also closely tied to the regime. The Anbar tribes in and around the city were largely co-opted to support the regime and Ramadi was the home base of the Iraqi Army&#x27;s combat engineers, special forces and many active and retired senior officers.

Ramadi was the scene of large-scale demonstrations against Saddam Hussein in 1995. This made it virtually unique in Sunni Iraq, where support for Saddam was strongest. The demonstrations were prompted by Saddam&#x27;s execution of a prominent member of the Dulaim tribe from Ramadi, Iraqi Air Force General Muhammad Madhlum al-Dulaimi, and three other Dulaimi officers. The four had criticized the regime and Saddam&#x27;s notoriously violent and dissolute son Uday. After their execution, the bodies were sent back to Ramadi. The regime&#x27;s security forces put down the demonstrations which ensued and Saddam subsequently viewed the Dulaimis with suspicion, though he was unable to purge them without risking a full-scale tribal revolt.

===U.S. invasion and Iraqi insurgency===

The policy of de-Ba&#x27;athification and the disbandment of the Iraqi Army, implemented by the United States following the 2003 invasion of Iraq, hit Ramadi particularly hard because of its links to the party and the army. Many senior officials and military figures in the city suddenly found themselves excluded from public life. This gave them both the motivation and the means, given their connections and technical expertise, to mount a campaign of violence against coalition forces. As a result, Ramadi became a hotbed of insurgency between 2003 and 2006 and was badly affected by the Iraq War especially during the 2006 Battle of Ramadi.

===ISIS (Islamic State in Iraq and al-Sham)===
Following the withdrawal of US and Coalition forces in 2011, Ramadi was contested by Iraq and the Islamic State of Iraq (ISI) during the ongoing Iraqi insurgency. On 15 May 2015 Ramadi was captured by ISIS after an assault that included suicide car bombs, mortars, and rocket launchers. CNN reported that ISIS took over 50 high-level security personnel prisoners during the assault. The ISIS flag was also raised at the Ramadi government headquarters. By 17 May 2015 Ramadi had been completely captured by ISIS forces.

Since the ISIS occupation of Ramadi, efforts have been made to re-take the city. In November 2015, Iraqi government forces completed an encirclement of Ramadi. On 28 December, Iraqi forces advanced into the centre of the city of Ramadi and liberated it.

===Iraq&#x27;s recapture of the city===
On 28 December 2015, Iraq&#x27;s government claimed that it retook the city from the Islamic insurgency group ISIS. The operation started in early November. The city&#x27;s recapture is seen as a major reversal for ISIS. ISIS occupied the city beginning in May 2015. The ISIS occupation of the city was a major defeat for the Iraqi government forces. The recapture of Ramadi was backed by US-led coalition air strikes and an Iraqi advance into the city, but made slow progress, mainly due to stiff resistance from ISIS militants inside the southern half of the city and also because the government chose not to use the powerful Shia-dominated paramilitary force PMF that had previously helped it regain the mainly Sunni northern city of Tikrit, to avoid increasing sectarian tensions. The military said remaining ISIS militants have headed out to the north-east of Ramadi. The PM of Iraq declared that 30 December as celebrations of the recapture of Ramadi. However, Ramadi was highly damaged afterwards, with some estimates as high as 90% of the city being destroyed during the fighting.

==Transportation==

Ramadi stands on an important trade route leading across the desert to Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. The main Amman–Baghdad road passes through the city. A railway line also runs through the southern outskirts of Ramadi, heading east to Baghdad and west to Haditha and the Syrian border.

==Geography==

At the start of the 21st century, Ramadi stretched over an area of about east to west by north to south. The center of the city is densely built up, with numerous more spread-out residential suburbs surrounding it. The city center is bounded to the north by the Euphrates, to the east by suburbs, to the south by the railway line between Baghdad and Haditha, and to the west by the Habbaniyah Canal. More suburbs exist to the west and northwest of the canal and north of the Euphrates.

The city center is connected to the suburbs by two major bridges, one across the Euphrates and the other across the canal, while the western and northern suburbs are connected by a major highway that crosses the Euphrates north of the city. Various tribal groups live in separate districts within the suburbs, with dozens of sheikhs being responsible for maintaining the security and well-being of their particular grouping. The suburbs are extensively criss-crossed with canals that are used to irrigate the farmland around the city.

Ramadi&#x27;s recent origins mean that it is dominated by modern concrete buildings, mostly flat-roofed two- or three-story structures but with a number of taller buildings in the city center. Its modern origins mean that it lacks features typical of older Iraqi cities, such as a kasbah. The Japanese-built city hospital, with seven stories, is the tallest building in Ramadi. The city was badly damaged during the Iraq war and insurgency. Many buildings were destroyed and many more were rendered uninhabitable.

==Climate==
Ramadi has a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) in the Köppen–Geiger climate classification system. Most rain falls in the winter. The average annual temperature in Ramadi is . About of precipitation falls annually. Sand storms often occur in the warmer months in this region.

formula_4 for all inputs formula_5 and formula_6.

A key property of the beta function is its close relationship to the gamma function:

:formula_7

A proof is given below in .

The beta function is also closely related to binomial coefficients. When (or , by symmetry) is a positive integer, it follows from the definition of the gamma function that

:formula_8

== Relationship to the gamma function ==
To derive this relation, write the product of two factorials as integrals. Since they are integrals in two separate variables, we can combine then into an iterated integral:

:formula_9

Changing variables by and , because and , we have that the limits of integrations for are 0 to ∞ and the limits of integration for are 0 to 1. Thus produces

:formula_10

Dividing both sides by formula_11 gives the desired result. 

The stated identity may be seen as a particular case of the identity for the integral of a convolution. Taking

:formula_12

one has:

:formula_13

See &quot;The Gamma Function&quot;, page 18–19 for a derivation of this relation.

== Differentiation of the beta function ==

We have

:formula_14

:formula_15

where formula_16 denotes the digamma function.

==Approximation==
Stirling&#x27;s approximation gives the asymptotic formula

:formula_17

for large and large . 

If on the other hand is large and is fixed, then

:formula_18

== Other identities and formulas ==
The integral defining the beta function may be rewritten in a variety of ways, including the following:
:formula_19

where in the second-to-last identity is any positive real number. One may move from the first integral to the second one by substituting formula_20.

For values formula_21 we have:

:formula_22

The beta function can be written as an infinite sum
: formula_23 
If formula_24 and formula_25 are equal to a number formula_26 we get:
:formula_27
: (where formula_28 is the rising factorial)
and as an infinite product
: formula_29

The beta function satisfies several identities analogous to corresponding identities for binomial coefficients, including a version of Pascal&#x27;s identity

:formula_30

and a simple recurrence on one coordinate: 

:formula_31

The positive integer values of the beta function are also the partial derivatives of a 2D function: for all nonnegative integers formula_32 and formula_33,
:formula_34
where
:formula_35
The Pascal-like identity above implies that this function is a solution to the first-order partial differential equation
:formula_36

For formula_37, the beta function may be written in terms of a convolution involving the truncated power function formula_38:
:formula_39

Evaluations at particular points may simplify significantly; for example, 
:formula_40
and
:formula_41

By taking formula_42 in this last formula, it follows that formula_43.
Generalizing this into a bivariate identity for a product of beta functions leads to:
:formula_44

Euler&#x27;s integral for the beta function may be converted into an integral over the Pochhammer contour as

:formula_45

This Pochhammer contour integral converges for all values of and and so gives the analytic continuation of the beta function.

Just as the gamma function for integers describes factorials, the beta function can define a binomial coefficient after adjusting indices:
:formula_46

Moreover, for integer , can be factored to give a closed form interpolation function for continuous values of :
:formula_47

==Reciprocal beta function==
The reciprocal beta function is the function about the form

:formula_48

Interestingly, their integral representations closely relate as the definite integral of trigonometric functions with product of its power and multiple-angle: 

:formula_49

:formula_50

:formula_51

:formula_52

==Incomplete beta function==
The incomplete beta function, a generalization of the beta function, is defined as

:formula_53

For , the incomplete beta function coincides with the complete beta function. The relationship between the two functions is like that between the gamma function and its generalization the incomplete gamma function. For positive integer &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot;, the incomplete beta function will be a polynomial of degree &quot;a&quot; + &quot;b&quot; - 1 with rational coefficients.

By the substitution formula_54 and formula_55, we show that 
:formula_56

The regularized incomplete beta function (or regularized beta function for short) is defined in terms of the incomplete beta function and the complete beta function:

:formula_57

The regularized incomplete beta function is the cumulative distribution function of the beta distribution, and is related to the cumulative distribution function formula_58 of a random variable following a binomial distribution with probability of single success and number of Bernoulli trials :

:formula_59

===Properties===

:formula_60

===Continued fraction expansion===

The continued fraction expansion

:formula_61

with odd and even coefficients respectively

:formula_62
:formula_63

converges rapidly when formula_24 is not close to 1. The formula_65 and formula_66 convergents are less than formula_67, while the formula_68 and formula_69 convergents are greater than formula_67.

For formula_71, the function may be evaluated more efficiently using formula_72.

==Multivariate beta function==
The beta function can be extended to a function with more than two arguments:

:formula_73

This multivariate beta function is used in the definition of the Dirichlet distribution. Its relationship to the beta function is analogous to the relationship between multinomial coefficients and binomial coefficients. For example, it satisfies a similar version of Pascal&#x27;s identity:

:formula_74

== Applications ==
The beta function is useful in computing and representing the scattering amplitude for Regge trajectories. Furthermore, it was the first known scattering amplitude in string theory, first conjectured by Gabriele Veneziano. It also occurs in the theory of the preferential attachment process, a type of stochastic urn process. The beta function is also important in statistics, e.g. for the beta distribution and beta prime distribution. As briefly alluded to previously, the beta function is closely tied with the gamma function and plays an important role in calculus.

==Software implementation==
Even if unavailable directly, the complete and incomplete beta function values can be calculated using functions commonly included in spreadsheet or computer algebra systems. 

In Microsoft Excel, for example, the complete beta function can be computed with the codice_1 function (or codice_2 in Python&#x27;s SciPy package):
:codice_3

This result follows from the properties listed above.

The incomplete beta function cannot be directly computed using such relations and other methods must be used. In GNU Octave, it is computed using a continued fraction expansion.

The incomplete beta function has existing implementation in common languages. For instance, codice_4 (incomplete beta function) in MATLAB and GNU Octave, codice_5 (probability of beta distribution) in R and codice_4 in SymPy. In SciPy, codice_7 computes the regularized incomplete beta function—which is, in fact, the cumulative beta distribution. To get the actual incomplete beta function, one can multiply the result of codice_7 by the result returned by the corresponding codice_9 function. In Mathematica, codice_10 and codice_11 give formula_75 and formula_76, respectively.

<text>The Oath (original title, French: &quot;Le serment de Kolvillàg&quot;) is a novel by Elie Wiesel. It tells the story of Azriel, the only surviving Jewish member of the small (fictionally named) Hungarian town of Kolvillàg after a pogrom perpetrated by neighboring Christians. Azriel carries the secret of Kolvillàg&#x27;s destruction within him, forbidden to share his experiences. However, when Azriel meets a young man on the brink of suicide fifty years later, he realizes that he must pass on his secret to save the young man&#x27;s life - yet, he is bound by his promise to the dead.

&quot;Le serment de Kolvillàg&quot; is a work told in fragments - the point of view changes from present-day Azriel, the Azriel of the past, the young man in the present, and the young man&#x27;s past. It is unstructured to the point where it borders on Surrealism. Some of the themes of &quot;Le serment de Kolvillag&quot; include pogroms, death, old age, secrecy, silence, and modernity.

<doc id="245678" wikidata="Q159603" url="?curid=245678" title="Władysław Gomułka">
<text>Władysław Gomułka (; 6 February 1905 – 1 September 1982) was a Polish Communist politician. He was the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of post-war Poland from 1947 until 1948, and again from 1956 to 1970. 

Born in 1905 in Galicia, Gomulka was of proletarian origin. A plumber from the age of fourteen, he joined the revolutionary movement, made propaganda in the trade unions and suffered the rigours of the Witos government, then of the Pilsudski dictatorship. When Nazi Germany invaded Poland in 1939, he was imprisoned in Lwow, but was later released. He moved to Warsaw and became one of the most energetic organisers of the resistance against the Nazis. In 1943, he became the leader of the left-wing resistance fighters, the general secretary of the underground workers&#x27; party. When Poland was occupied by the Red Army, he collaborated with the Lublin government, formed by the Soviets with the Polish Bierut group, which received Stalin&#x27;s blessing.

Following the Polish October, he became leader again from 1956 to 1970. Gomułka was initially relatively popular for his reforms; his seeking a &quot;Polish way to socialism&quot;; and giving rise to the period known as &quot;Polish thaw&quot;. During the 1960s, however, he became more rigid and authoritarian—afraid of destabilizing the system, he was not inclined to introduce or permit changes. In the 1960s he supported the persecution of the Catholic Church, and the anti-communist opposition.

In 1967 to 1968, Gomułka allowed outbursts of anti-Zionist and antisemitic political campaign, pursued primarily by others in the Party, but utilized by Gomułka to retain power by shifting the attention from the stagnating economy. Many of the remaining Polish Jews left the country. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media. Gomułka supported Poland&#x27;s participation in the Warsaw Pact invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.

In the treaty with West Germany, signed in December 1970 at the end of Gomułka&#x27;s period in office, West Germany recognized the post-World War II borders, which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in Central Europe. In the same month, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent bloody clashes with shipyard workers on the Baltic coast, in which several dozen workers were fatally shot. The tragic events forced Gomułka&#x27;s resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, Edward Gierek took over the Party leadership and tensions eased.

==Childhood and education==

Władysław Gomułka was born on 6 February 1905 in Białobrzegi Franciszkańskie village on the outskirts of Krosno, into a worker&#x27;s family living in the Austrian Partition (the Galicia region) (now Poland). His parents had met and married in the United States, where each had immigrated to in search of work in the late 19th century, but returned to occupied Poland in the early 20th century because Władysław&#x27;s father Jan was unable to find gainful employment in America. Jan Gomułka then worked as a laborer in the Subcarpathian oil industry. Władysław&#x27;s older sister Józefa, born in the US, returned there upon turning eighteen to join her extended family, most of whom had emigrated, and to preserve her US citizenship. Władysław and his two other siblings experienced a childhood of the proverbial Galician poverty: they lived in a dilapidated hut and ate mostly potatoes. Władysław received only rudimentary education before being employed in the oil industry of the region.

Gomułka attended schools in Krosno for six or seven years, until the age of thirteen when he had to start an apprenticeship in a metalworks shop. Throughout his life Gomułka was an avid reader and accomplished a great deal of self-education, but remained a subject of jokes because of his lack of formal education and demeanor. In 1922, Gomułka passed his apprenticeship exams and began working at a local refinery.

==Early revolutionary activities==

===Involvement with labor unions and first imprisonment===

The re-established Polish state of Gomułka&#x27;s teen years was a scene of growing political polarization and radicalization. The young worker developed connections with the radical Left, joining the &quot;Siła&quot; (Power) youth organization in 1922 and the Independent Peasant Party in 1925. Gomułka was known for his activism in the metal workers and, from 1922, chemical industry unions. He was involved in union-organized strikes and in 1924, during a protest gathering in Krosno, participated in a polemical debate with Herman Lieberman. He published radical texts in leftist newspapers. In May 1926 the young Gomułka was for the first time arrested but soon released because of worker demands. The incident was the subject of a parliamentary intervention by the Peasant Party. In October 1926, Gomułka became a secretary of the managing council in the Chemical Industry Workers Union for the Drohobych District and remained involved with that communist-dominated union until 1930. He around this time learned on his own basic Ukrainian.

In late 1926, while in Drohobych, Gomułka became a member of the illegal-but-functioning Communist Party of Poland (&quot;Komunistyczna Partia Polski&quot;, KPP) and was arrested for political agitation. Technically, at this time he was a member of the Communist Party of Western Ukraine, which was an autonomous branch of the Communist Party of Poland. He was interested primarily in social issues, including the trade and labor movement, and concentrated on practical activities. In mid-1927, Gomułka was brought to Warsaw, where he remained active until drafted for military service at the end of the year. After several months, the military released him because of a health problem with his right leg. Gomułka returned to communist party work, organizing strike actions and speaking at gatherings of workers at all major industrial centers of Poland. During this period he was arrested several times and lived under police supervision.

Gomułka was an activist in the leftist labor unions from 1926, and in the Central Trade Department of the KPP Central Committee from 1931. In the summer of 1930, Gomułka illegally embarked on his first foreign trip with the intention of participating in the Red International of Labor Unions Fifth Congress held in Moscow from 15 to 30 July. Traveling from Upper Silesia to Berlin, he had to wait there for the issuance of Soviet documents and arrived in Moscow too late to participate in the deliberations of the Congress. He stayed in Moscow for a couple of weeks and then went to Leningrad, from where he took a ship to Hamburg, stayed in Berlin again and through Silesia returned to Poland.

In August 1932, he was arrested by the Sanation police while participating in a conference of textile worker delegates in Łódź. When he later tried to escape, Gomułka sustained a gunshot wound in the left thigh which ultimately left him with permanent walking impairment.

===Journey to the Soviet Union and second imprisonment===

Despite being sentenced to a four-year prison term on 1 June 1933, he was temporarily released for surgery on his injured leg in March 1934. Following his release, Gomułka requested that the KPP send him to the Soviet Union for medical treatment and further political training. He arrived in the Soviet Union in June and went to the Crimea for several weeks, where he underwent therapeutic baths. Gomułka then spent more than a year in Moscow, where he attended the Lenin School under the name Stefan Kowalski. The ideology-oriented classes were arranged separately for a small group of Polish students (one of them was Roman Romkowski (Natan Grünspan [Grinszpan]-Kikiel), who would later persecute Gomułka in Stalinist Poland) and included a military training course conducted by Karol Świerczewski. In a written opinion issued by the school Gomułka was characterized in highly positive terms, but his extended stay in the Soviet Union caused him to become disillusioned with the realities of Stalinist communism and highly critical of the agrarian collectivization practice. In November 1935, he illegally returned to Poland.

Gomułka resumed his communist and labor conspiratorial activities and kept advancing within the KPP organization until, as the secretary of the Party&#x27;s Silesian branch, he was arrested in Chorzów in April 1936. He was then tried by the District Court in Katowice and sentenced to seven years in prison where he remained jailed until the beginning of World War II. Ironically, this internment most likely saved Gomułka&#x27;s life, because the majority of the KPP leadership would be murdered in the Soviet Union in the late 1930s, caught up in the Great Purge under Joseph Stalin&#x27;s orders.

Gomułka&#x27;s experiences turned him into an extremely suspicious and distrustful person and contributed to his lifelong conviction that Sanation Poland was a fascist state, even if Polish prisons were the safest place for Polish Communists. He differentiated this belief from his positive feelings toward the country and its people, especially members of the working class.

==World War II==

===Invasion of Poland===

The outbreak of the war with Nazi Germany freed Gomułka from his prison confinement. On 7 September 1939, he arrived in Warsaw, where he stayed for a few weeks, working in the besieged capital on the construction of defensive fortifications. From there, like many other Polish communists, Gomułka fled to eastern Poland which was invaded by the Soviet Union on 17 September 1939. In Białystok he ran a home for former political prisoners arriving from other parts of Poland. To be reunited with his luckily found wife, at the end of 1939 Gomułka moved to Soviet-controlled Lviv.

Like other members of the dissolved Communist Party of Poland, Gomułka sought a membership in the Soviet All-Union Communist Party (Bolsheviks). The Soviet authorities allowed such membership transfers only from March 1941 and in April of that year Gomułka received his party card in Kiev.

The circumstances of the Polish communists&#x27; lives changed dramatically after 1941 German attack on the Soviet positions in eastern Poland. Reduced to penury in now German-occupied Lviv, the Gomułkas managed to join Władysław&#x27;s family in Krosno by the end of 1941. However, a momentous development soon took place in the sphere of communist political activity: in January 1942, Joseph Stalin reestablished in Warsaw a Polish communist party under the name of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR).

In 1942, Gomułka participated in the reformation of a Polish communist party (the KPP was destroyed in Stalin&#x27;s purges in the late 1930s) under the name Polish Workers&#x27; Party (&quot;Polska Partia Robotnicza&quot;, PPR). Gomułka became involved in the creation of party structures in the Subcarpathian region and began using his wartime conspiratorial pseudonym &quot;Wiesław&quot;. In July 1942, Paweł Finder brought Gomułka to occupied Warsaw. In August, the secretary of the PPR&#x27;s regional Warsaw Committee was arrested by the Gestapo and &quot;Wiesław&quot; was entrusted with his job. In September, Gomułka became a member of the PPR&#x27;s Temporary Central Committee.

In late 1942 and early 1943, the PPR experienced a severe crisis because of the murder of its first secretary Marceli Nowotko. Gomułka participated in the party investigation directed against another member of the leadership, Bolesław Mołojec, that resulted in Mołojec&#x27;s execution. Together with Paweł Finder, who was made First Secretary of the party, and Franciszek Jóźwiak, Gomułka (under the pseudonym &quot;Wiesław&quot;) was included in the Party&#x27;s new inner leadership, established in January 1943. The Central Committee was enlarged in the following months to include Bolesław Bierut, among others.

In February 1943, Gomułka led the communist side in a series of important meetings in Warsaw between the PPR and the Government Delegation of the London-based Polish government-in-exile and the Home Army. The talks produced no results because of the divergent interests of the parties involved and a mutual lack of confidence. The Delegation officially discontinued the negotiations on April 28, three days after the Soviet government broke diplomatic relations with the Polish government. He became the Party&#x27;s main ideologist. He wrote the &quot;What do we fight for?&quot; (&quot;O co walczymy?&quot;) publication dated 1 March 1943, and the much more comprehensive declaration that emerged under the same title in November. &quot;Wiesław&quot; supervised the Party&#x27;s main editorial and publishing undertaking.

Gomułka made efforts, largely unsuccessful, to secure for the PPR cooperation of other political forces in occupied Poland. Bierut, meanwhile, was indifferent to any such attempts and counted simply on compulsion provided by a future presence of the Red Army in Poland. The different strategies resulted in a sharp conflict between the two communist politicians.

===State National Council, Polish Committee of National Liberation===

In the fall of 1943, the PPR leadership began discussing the creation of a Polish quasi-parliamentary, communist-led body, to be named the State National Council (&quot;Krajowa Rada Narodowa&quot;, KRN). After the Battle of Kursk the expectation was of a Soviet victory and liberation of Poland and the PPR wanted to be ready to assume power. Gomułka came up with the idea of a national council and imposed his point of view on the rest of the leadership. The PPR intended to obtain consent from the Comintern leader and their Soviet contact Georgi Dimitrov. However, in November the Gestapo arrested Finder and Małgorzata Fornalska, who possessed the secret codes for communication with Moscow and the Soviet response remained unknown. In the absence of Finder, on 23 November Gomułka was elected general secretary (chief) of the PPR and Bierut joined the three-person inner leadership.

The founding meeting of the State National Council took place in the late evening of 31 December 1943. The new body&#x27;s chairman Bierut was becoming Gomułka&#x27;s main rival. In mid-January 1944 Dimitrov was finally informed of the KRN&#x27;s existence, which surprised both him and the Polish communist leaders in Moscow, increasingly led by Jakub Berman, who had other, competing ideas concerning the establishment of a Polish communist ruling party and government.

Gomułka felt that the Polish communists in occupied Poland had a better understanding of Polish realities than their brethren in Moscow and that the State National Council should determine the shape of the future executive government of Poland. Nevertheless, to gain Soviet approval and to clear any misunderstandings a KRN delegation left Warsaw in mid-March heading for Moscow, where it arrived two months later. By that time Stalin concluded that the existence of the KRN was a positive development and the Poles arriving from Warsaw were received and greeted by him and other Soviet dignitaries. The Union of Polish Patriots and the Central Bureau of Polish Communists in Moscow were now under pressure to recognize the primacy of the PPR, the KRN and Władysław Gomułka, which they ultimately did only in mid-July.

On 20 July, the Soviet forces under Marshal Konstantin Rokossovsky forced their way across the Bug River and on that same day the combined meeting of Polish communists from the Moscow and Warsaw factions finalized the arrangements regarding the establishment (on 21 July) of the Polish Committee of National Liberation (PKWN), a temporary government headed by Edward Osóbka-Morawski, a socialist allied with the communists. Gomułka and other PPR leaders left Warsaw and headed for the Soviet-controlled territory, arriving in Lublin on 1 August, the day the Warsaw Uprising erupted in the Polish capital.

==Post-war political career==

===Role in communist takeover of Poland===

Gomułka was a deputy prime minister in the Provisional Government of the Republic of Poland (&quot;Rząd Tymczasowy Rzeczypospolitej Polskiej&quot;), from January to June 1945, and in the Provisional Government of National Unity (&quot;Tymczasowy Rząd Jedności Narodowej&quot;), from 1945 to 1947. As a minister of Recovered Territories (1945–48), he exerted great influence over the rebuilding, integration and economic progress of Poland within its new borders, by supervising the settlement, development and administration of the lands acquired from Germany. Using his position in the PPR and government, Gomułka led the leftist social transformations in Poland and participated in the crushing of the resistance to communist rule during the post-war years. He also helped the communists in winning the &quot;Trzy razy tak&quot; (&quot;Three Times Yes&quot;) referendum of 1946. A year later, he played a key role in the 1947 parliamentary elections, which were fraudulently arranged to give the communists and their allies an overwhelming victory. After the elections, all remaining legal opposition in Poland was effectively destroyed, and Gomułka was now the most powerful man in Poland. In June 1948, because of the impending unification of the PPR and PPS, Gomułka delivered a talk on the subject of the history of the Polish worker movement.

In a memo written to Stalin in 1948, Gomułka argued that &quot;some of the Jewish comrades don&#x27;t feel any link to the Polish nation or to the Polish working class … or they maintain a stance which might be described as ‘national nihilism’&quot;. As a result, he considered it &quot;absolutely necessary not only to stop any further growth in the percentage of Jews in the state as well as the party apparatus, but also to slowly lower that percentage, especially at the highest levels of the apparatus&quot;. Nikita Khrushchev, who was intimately involved in Polish affairs in the 1940s, according to Khrushchev′s memoirs, believed that Gomułka had a valid point in opposing the personnel policies pursued by Roman Zambrowski, Jakub Berman, and Hilary Minc, all of them of Jewish descent and brought to Poland from the Soviet Union. Nevertheless, Khrushchev attributed Gomułka′s subsequent downfall to his rivals having succeeded in portraying Gomułka as being pro-Yugoslav; the charges were not made public but were brought to Stalin′s attention and became crucial in his decision-making on whose side he would support — in view of the Soviet–Yugoslavia rift that occurred in 1948.

===Temporary withdrawal from politics===

In the late 1940s, Poland&#x27;s communist government was split by a rivalry between Gomułka and President Bolesław Bierut. Gomułka led a home national group while Bierut headed a group reared by Stalin in the Soviet Union. The struggle ultimately led to Gomułka&#x27;s removal from power in 1948. While Bierut advocated a policy of complete subservience to Moscow, Gomułka wanted to adapt the Communist blueprint to Polish circumstances. Among other things, he opposed forced collectivization and was skeptical of the Cominform. The Bierut faction had Stalin&#x27;s ear, and on Stalin&#x27;s orders, Gomułka was sacked as party leader for &quot;rightist-nationalist deviation,&quot; replaced by Bierut. In December, soon after the PPR and Polish Socialist Party merged to form Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR) (which was essentially the PPR under a new name), Gomułka was dropped from the merged party&#x27;s Politburo. He was stripped of his remaining government posts in January 1949 and expelled from the party altogether in November. For the next eight years, he performed no official functions and was subjected to persecution, including almost four years of imprisonment from 1951 to 1954.

Bierut died in March 1956, during a period of de-Stalinization in Poland which gradually developed after Stalin&#x27;s death. Edward Ochab became the new first secretary of the Party. Soon afterward, Gomułka was partially rehabilitated when Ochab conceded that Gomułka should not have been jailed, while reiterating the charges of &quot;rightist-nationalist deviation&quot; against him.

===Rise to power===

In June 1956, violent worker protests broke out in Poznań. The worker riots were harshly suppressed and dozens of workers were killed. However, the Party leadership, which now included many reform-minded officials, recognized to some degree the validity of the protest participants&#x27; demands and took steps to placate the workers.

The reformers in the Party wanted a political rehabilitation of Gomułka and his return to the Party leadership. Gomułka insisted that he be given real power to implement further reforms. He wanted a replacement of some of the Party leaders, including the pro-Soviet Minister of Defense Konstantin Rokossovsky.

The Soviet leadership viewed events in Poland with alarm. Simultaneously with Soviet troop movements deep into Poland, a high-level Soviet delegation flew to Warsaw. It was led by Nikita Khrushchev and included Anastas Mikoyan, Nikolai Bulganin, Vyacheslav Molotov, Lazar Kaganovich, Ivan Konev and others. Ochab and Gomułka made it clear that Polish forces would resist if Soviet troops advanced, but reassured the Soviets that the reforms were internal matters and that Poland had no intention of abandoning the communist bloc or its treaties with the Soviet Union. The Soviets yielded.

Following the wishes of the majority of the Politburo members, First Secretary Ochab conceded and on 20 October the Central Committee brought Gomułka and several associates into the Politburo, removed others, and elected Gomułka as the first secretary of the Party. Gomułka, the former prisoner of the Stalinists, enjoyed wide popular support across the country, expressed by the participants of a massive street demonstration in Warsaw on 24 October. Seeing that Gomułka was popular with the Polish people, and given his insistence that he wanted to maintain the alliance with the Soviet Union and the presence of the Red Army in Poland, Khrushchev decided that Gomułka was a leader that Moscow could live with.

==Leadership of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic==

===Relations with other Eastern Bloc countries===

A major factor that influenced Gomułka was the Oder-Neisse line issue. West Germany refused to recognize the Oder-Neisse line and Gomułka realized the fundamental instability of Poland&#x27;s unilaterally imposed western border. He felt threatened by the revanchist statements put out by the Adenauer government and believed that the alliance with the Soviet Union was the only thing stopping the threat of a future German invasion. The new Party leader told the 8th Plenum of the PZPR on 19 October 1956 that: &quot;Poland needs friendship with the Soviet Union more than the Soviet Union needs friendship with Poland... Without the Soviet Union we cannot maintain our borders with the West&quot;. The treaty with West Germany was negotiated and signed in December 1970. The German side recognized the post-World War II borders, which established a foundation for future peace, stability and cooperation in Central Europe.

During the events of the Prague Spring, Gomułka was one of the key leaders of the Warsaw Pact and supported Poland&#x27;s participation in the invasion of Czechoslovakia in August 1968.

===Domestic policies===

In 1967–68, Gomułka allowed outbursts of &quot;anti-Zionist&quot; political propaganda, which developed initially as a result of the Soviet bloc&#x27;s frustration with the outcome of the Arab-Israeli Six-Day War. It turned out to be a thinly veiled antisemitic campaign and purge of the army, pursued primarily by others in the Party, but utilized by Gomułka to keep himself in power by shifting the attention of the populace from the stagnating economy and mismanagement. The result was the emigration of the majority of the remaining Polish citizens of Jewish origin. At that time he was also responsible for persecuting protesting students and toughening censorship of the media.

===Resignation and retirement===

In December 1970, economic difficulties led to price rises and subsequent protests. Gomułka along with his right-hand man Zenon Kliszko ordered the regular Army under General Bolesław Chocha, to shoot striking workers with automatic weapons in Gdańsk and Gdynia. Over 41 shipyard workers of the Baltic coast were killed in the ensuing police-state violence, while well over a thousand people were wounded. The events forced Gomułka&#x27;s resignation and retirement. In a generational replacement of the ruling elite, Edward Gierek took over the Party leadership and tensions eased.

Gomułka&#x27;s negative image in communist propaganda after his removal was gradually modified and some of his constructive contributions were recognized. He is seen as an honest and austere believer in the socialist system, who, unable to resolve Poland&#x27;s formidable difficulties and satisfy mutually contradictory demands, grew more rigid and despotic later in his career. A heavy smoker, he died in 1982 at the age of 77 of lung cancer. Gomułka&#x27;s memoirs were not published until 1994, long after his death, and five years after the collapse of the communist regime which he served and led.

The American journalist John Gunther described Gomułka in 1961 as being &quot;professorial in manner, aloof, and angular, with a peculiar spry pepperiness&quot;.

Gomułka was buried at Powązki Military Cemetery in Warsaw.

<text>Tell Taylor (aka Tellie &quot;né&quot; Tell Roberts;(October 28, 1876 – November 23, 1937). Tell was born October 28, 1876 to Clarinda Jane Roberts (1854-1930) and John Asbury Taylor (1853-1928), on a farm near the Village of Vanlue, Amanda Township, Hancock County, Ohio. He was an American traveling vaudeville performer, tenor vocalist, playwright, music publisher, composer, and lyricist who had written over 200 popular songs. His biggest hit was &quot;Down by the Old Mill Stream&quot; from 1910, one of the most commercially successful Tin Pan Alley publications of the era. The song was published by Tell Taylor, Inc., which he had co-founded in 1907. Taylor performed vaudeville theaters and founded a Chicago music publishing house bearing his name. His other notable songs include &quot;He Sleeps Beneath the Soil of France,&quot; &quot;I Love You Best of All,&quot; &quot;If Dreams Come True,&quot; &quot;Little Old Home in the Valley,&quot; &quot;Rock Me to Sleep in the Old Rocking Chair,&quot; &quot;Some Day,&quot; and &quot;When the Maple Leaves Were Falling.&quot; Taylor also wrote the Broadway comedies &quot;Tiger Lillee&quot; and &quot;In New York Town&quot;.

== Career highlights ==
Theater

: By 1892, at the age of 16, Taylor&#x27;s name as a thespian began to be published in theater reviews of newspapers in and around New York, Wisconsin, Illinois, Ohio, Indiana, Iowa, and Missouri. Among the plays of that year featuring Taylor was &quot;By Wits Outwitted&quot;, written by Edward Owings Towne, where Taylor played the audacious hero (Valentine Navaro), and Florence Modena playing the pretty heroine (Fernanda). Taylor also played the part of &quot;Bill Smith,&quot; a farm hand, in &quot;A Glimpse of Paradise,&quot; by Frank S. Pixley, a one-act play that often preceded the three-act &quot;By Wits Outwitted.&quot;

Music publishing and songwriting

: Before launching his Chicago publishing firm in 1907, Taylor had co-founded one of the original Tin Pan Alley publishing houses in New York City with fellow composer, Ernest R. Ball, and former New York City Mayor who then was a state senator, James J. Walker. In 1918, Earl Kelly Smith (1886–1954), who had been affiliated with Taylor&#x27;s Chicago publishing house since 1908, opened a branch in New York City. In Chicago, Taylor composed songs and ran his own sheet music publishing firm from 1907 to 1922.
Post publishing &amp; singing

: In 1922, Taylor sold his Chicago publishing firm and purchased a farm for his parents near his boyhood home, on the outskirts of Findlay, Ohio, and spent the rest of his life there. In May, he formally assigned his catalog to Forster Music Publishers, Inc. 216 South Wabash Ave., Chicago, However, &quot;Down By The Old Mill Stream,&quot; his top selling composition, was not assigned until 1931.

 Death
: In the Autumn of 1937, prior to embarking on a trip to California to discuss a motion picture about his life, Taylor entered a Chicago bar and ordered a drink. Tell sat at a table, put his head down to rest and died from a heart attack at the age of 61 on November 23, 1937, in Chicago. He was buried in Van Horn Cemetery, Findlay, Ohio.

Posthumous lawsuit over song
: In 1937, when the original copyright for &quot;Down By The Old Mill Stream&quot; was expiring, Earl Kelly Smith (1886–1954) filed an application to renew the copyright as co-composer. The renewal was granted. Jerry Vogel Music Company began publishing it. Forster Music, which had acquired the rights to the song from the heirs of Tell Taylor, filed suit to stop Vogel from publishing the song. In 1944, a US District Court in New York ruled in favor of Forster.

== Marriages ==

On November 4, 1907, Taylor married Buda Godman &quot;(née&quot; Helen Julia Godman; 1888–1945), the daughter of Otho and Julia Godman &quot;(née&quot; Conklin) of Chicago. Buda had met Taylor about two years prior when Taylor had been a dinner guest at the St. Joseph&#x27;s Convent and Academy in Adrian, Michigan, where Helen had been attending school. Taylor had just started his songwriting career and was appearing with a traveling stage company in Adrian. Buda and Tell had become friends before dinner was over, but did not correspond afterward. Two years later, while attending the performance of &quot;The Girl Question,&quot; by Howard, Adams, and Hough, at a theater in Chicago, Buda recognized Tell and sent a note to him backstage, and they became reacquainted. After spending time together lunching and dining during the following week, they met for dinner at a Chicago hotel, and sent for a judge to marry them in the hotel&#x27;s parlor.

In 1910, Tell Taylor filed for divorce from Buda in Chicago. In late September of that year, the divorce was granted, with Tell accusing Buda of having &quot;affinities&quot; with other vaudevillains. In the divorce proceedings, Tell stated that &quot;I married Buda when we both were drunk and I found out she was quite incapable of loyalty to anyone.&quot;

On July 8, 1913, Tell Taylor married again to Blanche Irene King (maiden; born 1887) in McLean County, Illinois. In 1921, Blanch filed for, and was granted a divorce from Tell Taylor in Chicago.

<text>Edward Gierek (; 6 January 1913 – 29 July 2001) was a Polish communist politician who served as the &quot;de facto&quot; leader of the Polish People&#x27;s Republic between 1970 and 1980. Gierek replaced Władysław Gomułka as the First Secretary of the ruling Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR).

Gierek came from a coal mining family and grew up in France from a young age, becoming active in the French communist movement and the Polish community in France. Gierek was deported to the Second Polish Republic for his communist advocacy in 1934 but moved to Belgium and was active in the Belgian Resistance during World War II. Gierek returned to Poland in 1948 and attended in the founding of the PZPR as a representative of Silesia, being appointed to the Sejm in 1952, the Central Committee of the PZPR under Bolesław Bierut in 1956, and the Politburo of the PZPR in 1959. Gierek was known for his openness and public speaking, emerging as one of the most respected and progressive politicians in the Poland whilst becoming a strong opponent to Gomułka.

Gierek became First Secretary when Gomułka was removed from office after the 1970 Polish protests were violently suppressed on his authority. Gierek&#x27;s first years were marked by improvements in living and working conditions with the construction of blocks of flats, growing industrialization, as well as the loosening of state censorship and openness to new Western ideas which turned Poland into the most liberal country of the Eastern Bloc. Gierek opened the first fully-operational highway in Poland from Warsaw to Katowice in 1976. Gierek&#x27;s policies were funded by large foreign loans and Poland continued to submerge into economic decline by the end of the 1970s. Gierek&#x27;s government was unable to pay its creditors and the country was so heavily indebted that rationing was introduced due to shortages. Gierek was removed from power after the Gdańsk Agreement between the state and workers of the emerging Solidarity movement, which was seen as a move to renounce communism by the PZPR&#x27;s leadership who replaced him as First Secretary with Stanisław Kania. Gierek was expelled from the PZPR and arrested briefly in 1981 during martial law in Poland, living the remainder of his life in retirement until his death in 2001.

Gierek is fondly remembered for his patriotism and modernization policies despite dragging Poland into financial and economic decline; over 1.8 million flats were constructed to house the growing population, and he was also responsible for initiating the production of the Fiat 126 car in Poland, and the construction of Warszawa Centralna railway station, the most modern European station at the time of its completion. Numerous aphorisms and sayings were popularized during his term; those referring to food shortages were later promoted by Ronald Reagan.

==Youth and early career==

Edward Gierek was born in Porąbka, now part of Sosnowiec, into a coal-mining family. His father was killed in an accident at a pit when he was four. His mother remarried and emigrated to northern France, where he lived from the age of 10 and worked in a coal mine from the age of 13. Gierek joined the French Communist Party in 1931, and in 1934 was deported to Poland for organizing a strike. After completing compulsory military service in Stryi in southeastern Poland (1934–1936), Gierek married Stanisława Jędrusik, but was unable to find employment. The Giereks went to Belgium, where Edward worked in the coal mines of Waterschei, where he contracted pneumoconiosis (black lung disease). In 1939 Gierek joined the Communist Party of Belgium. During the German occupation, he participated in communist anti-Nazi Belgian resistance activities. After the war Gierek remained politically active among the Polish immigrant community. He was a co-founder of the Belgian branch of the Polish Workers&#x27; Party (PPR) and a chairman of the National Council of Poles in Belgium.

==Polish United Workers&#x27; Party activist==
Gierek, who in 1948 was 35 and had spent 22 years abroad, was directed by the PPR authorities to return to Poland, which he did with his wife and their two sons. Working in the Katowice district PPR organization, in December 1948, as a Sosnowiec delegate he participated in the PPR-PPS unification congress, which resulted in the establishment of the Polish United Workers&#x27; Party (PZPR). In 1949, he was designated for and attended a two-year higher party course in Warsaw, where he was judged to be poorly qualified for intellectual endeavors but highly motivated for party work. In 1951 Roman Zambrowski sent Gierek to a striking coal mine, charging him with restoring order. Gierek was able to resolve the situation using persuasion; the use of force was avoided. He was a member of the &quot;Sejm&quot;, Polish parliament, from 1952. During the II Congress of the PZPR (March 1954), he was elected a member of the party&#x27;s Central Committee. As chief of the Central Committee&#x27;s Heavy Industry Division, he worked directly under First Secretary Bolesław Bierut in Warsaw.

In March 1956, when Edward Ochab became the party&#x27;s first secretary, Gierek became a secretary of the Central Committee, even though he publicly expressed doubts about his own qualifications. On 28 June 1956 he was sent to Poznań, where a workers&#x27; protest was taking place. Afterward, delegated by the Politburo, he headed the commission charged with investigating the causes and course of the Poznań events. They presented their report on 7 July, blaming a hostile anti-socialist foreign-inspired conspiracy that took advantage of worker discontent in Poznań enterprises. In July Gierek became a member of the PZPR Politburo, but lasted in that position only until October, when Władysław Gomułka replaced Ochab as first secretary. Nikita Khrushchev criticized Gomułka for not retaining Gierek in the Politburo; he remained a Central Committee secretary responsible for economic affairs, however. He returned to the Politburo in March 1959, at the III Congress of the PZPR.
==Katowice industrial district leader==

In March 1957, in addition to his Central Committee duties, Gierek became the first secretary of the Katowice Voivodeship PZPR organization, a job he kept until 1970. He created a personal power base in the Katowice region and became the nationally recognized leader of the young technocrat faction of the party. On the one hand Gierek was regarded as a pragmatic, non-ideological and economic progress-oriented manager, on the other he was known for his servile attitude toward the Soviet leaders, for whom he was a source of information concerning the PZPR and its personalities. Both the industrial supremacy of Gierek&#x27;s well-run Upper Silesia territory and the special relationship with the Soviets he cultivated made many believe that Gierek was a likely successor to Gomułka.

The Warsaw University law professor Mieczysław Maneli, who had known Gierek since 1960, wrote about him in 1971: &quot;Edward Gierek is an old‐fashioned Communist, but without fanaticism or zealousness. His Marxism is encumbered by few dogmas. It is almost pragmatic. He believes profoundly in the leading role that history conferred upon Communist parties and lives by the maxim that a government should be strong and rule unshakably...Gierek&#x27;s party nickname was &#x27;Tshombe,&#x27; and Silesia was the &#x27;Polish Katanga.&#x27; There he operated almost as a sovereign prince, a talented organizer with a real gift for finding efficient and loyal henchmen. All professions were represented in his court: engineers, economists, professors, writers, party apparatchiks and security agents&quot;.

Gierek may have tried to make his move during the 1968 Polish political crisis. Soon after the student rally on 8 March in Warsaw, on 14 March in Katowice he led a mass gathering of 100,000 party members from the entire province. He was the first Politburo member to speak publicly on the issue of the protests then taking place and later claimed that his motivation was to demonstrate support for Gomułka&#x27;s rule, threatened by Mieczysław Moczar&#x27;s intra-party conspiring. Gierek used strong language to condemn the purported &quot;enemies of People&#x27;s Poland&quot; who were &quot;disturbing the peaceful Silesian water&quot;. He showered them with propaganda epithets and alluded to their bones being crushed if they persevered in their attempts to turn the &quot;nation&quot; away from its &quot;chosen course.&quot; Gierek was supposedly embarrassed when participants at the party conference in Warsaw on 19 March shouted his name along with that of Gomułka, as an expression of support. The 1968 events strengthened Gierek&#x27;s position, also in the eyes of his sponsors in Moscow.

==First secretary of the PZPR==

When the 1970 Polish protests were violently suppressed, Gierek replaced Gomułka as the first secretary of the party, becoming the most powerful politician in Poland. In late January 1971, he put his new authority on the line and traveled to Szczecin and Gdańsk, to bargain personally with the striking workers. Consumer price increases that had triggered the recent revolt were rescinded. Among Gierek&#x27;s popular moves was the decision to rebuild the Royal Castle in Warsaw, destroyed during World War II and not included in the post-war restoration of the city&#x27;s Old Town. State-controlled media stressed his foreign upbringing and his fluency in French.

The arrival of the Gierek team meant the final generational replacement of the ruling communist elite, a process begun in 1968 under Gomułka. Many thousands of party activists, including important elder leaders with background in the prewar Communist Party of Poland, were removed from positions of responsibility and replaced with people whose careers started after World War II. Much of the overhaul was accomplished during and after the VI Congress of the PZPR, convened in December 1971. The resulting governing class was one of the youngest in Europe. The role of the administration was expanded at the expense of the party, according to the maxim &quot;the party leads, the government governs&quot;. Throughout the 1970s, the most highly visible member of the top leadership after Gierek was Prime Minister Piotr Jaroszewicz. From May 1971, Gierek&#x27;s rival party politician Mieczysław Moczar was increasingly marginalized.

According to historian Krzysztof Pomian, early in his term Gierek abandoned the regime&#x27;s long-standing practice of on-and-off confrontation with the Polish Catholic Church, and opted for cooperation, giving the Church and its leaders a privileged position for the duration of communist rule in Poland. The Church markedly expanded its physical infrastructure and also became a crucial political third force, often involved in mediating conflict between the authorities and opposition activists.

===Economic expansion and decline===
As the riots that had brought down Gomułka were caused primarily by economic difficulties, Gierek promised economic reform and instituted a program to modernize industry and increase the availability of consumer goods. His &quot;reform&quot; was based primarily on large-scale foreign borrowing, not accompanied by major systemic restructuring. The need for deeper reform was obscured by the investment boom the country was enjoying in the first half of the 1970s. The first secretary&#x27;s good relations with Western leaders, especially France&#x27;s Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and West Germany&#x27;s Helmut Schmidt, were a catalyst for his receiving foreign aid and loans. Gierek is widely credited with opening Poland to political and economic influence from the West. He himself extensively traveled abroad and received important foreign guests in Poland, including three presidents of the United States. Gierek also was trusted by Leonid Brezhnev, which meant that he was able to pursue his policies (globalization of Poland&#x27;s economy) without much Soviet interference. He had readily granted the Soviets concessions that his predecessor Gomułka would have considered contrary to the Polish national interest.


The standard of living increased markedly in Poland in the first half of the 1970s, and for a time Gierek was hailed as a miracle worker. Poles, to an unprecedented degree, were able to purchase desired consumer items such as compact cars, travel to the West rather freely, and even a solution to the intractable housing supply problem seemed to be on the horizon. Decades later many remembered the period as the most prosperous in their lives. The economy, however, began to falter during the 1973 oil crisis, and by 1976 price increases became necessary. The June 1976 protests were forcibly suppressed, but the planned price increases were canceled. The greatest accumulation of foreign debt occurred in the late 1970s, as the regime struggled to counter the effects of the crisis.

===Crisis, protests, organized opposition===
The period of Gierek&#x27;s rule is notable for the rise of organized opposition in Poland. Changes to the constitution proposed by the regime caused considerable controversy at the turn of 1975 and 1976. The intended amendments included formalizing the &quot;socialist character of the state&quot;, the leading role of the PZPR and the Polish-Soviet alliance. The widely opposed alterations led to numerous protest letters and other actions, but were supported at the VII Congress of the PZPR in December 1975 and largely implemented by the &quot;Sejm&quot; in February 1976. Organized opposition circles developed gradually and reached 3,000–4,000 members by the end of the decade.

Because of the deteriorating economic situation, at the end of 1975 the authorities announced that the 1971 freeze in food prices would have to be lifted. Prime Minister Jaroszewicz forced the price rises, in combination with financial compensation favoring upper income brackets; the policy ultimately was adopted despite strong objections from the Soviet leadership. The increase, supported by Gierek, was announced by Jaroszewicz in the &quot;Sejm&quot; on 24 June 1976. Strikes broke out the following day, with particularly serious disturbances, brutally suppressed by the police, taking place in Radom, at Warsaw&#x27;s Ursus Factory and in Płock. On 26 June, Gierek engaged in the traditional party crisis-confronting mode of operation, ordering mass public gatherings in Polish cities to demonstrate people&#x27;s supposed support for the party and condemn the &quot;trouble makers&quot;.

Ordered by Brezhnev not to attempt any further manipulations with prices, Gierek and his government undertook other measures to rescue the market destabilized in the summer of 1976. In August &quot;merchandise coupons&quot; were introduced to ration sugar. The politics of &quot;dynamic development&quot; was over, as evidenced by such ration cards, which were retained until July 1989.

In the aftermath of the June 1976 protests, a major opposition group, the Workers&#x27; Defence Committee (KOR), commenced its activities in September to help the persecuted worker protest participants. Other opposition organizations were also established in 1977–79, but historically the KOR proved to be of particular importance.
In 1979, Poland&#x27;s ruling communists reluctantly allowed Pope John Paul II (born Karol Wojtyła, a Pole) to make his first papal visit to Poland (2–10 June), despite Soviet advice to the contrary. Gierek, who had previously met Pope Paul VI at the Vatican, talked with the Pope during his visit.

==Downfall==

Although Gierek, distressed by the 1976 price increase policy failure, was persuaded by his colleagues not to resign, divisions within his team intensified. One faction, led by Edward Babiuch and Piotr Jaroszewicz, wanted him to remain in power, while another, led by Stanisław Kania and Wojciech Jaruzelski, was less interested in preserving his leadership.

In May 1980, after the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan and the subsequent Western boycott of the Soviet Union, Gierek arranged a meeting between Valéry Giscard d&#x27;Estaing and Leonid Brezhnev in Warsaw. As was the case with Władysław Gomułka a decade earlier, a foreign policy success created an illusion that the Polish party leader was secure in his statesman aura, while the paramount political facts were being determined by the deteriorating economic situation and the resultant labor unrest. In July Gierek went to the Crimea, his usual vacation spot. For the last time he talked there with his friend Brezhnev. He responded to Brezhnev&#x27;s gloomy assessment of the situation in Poland (including the out-of-control indebtedness) with his own upbeat predictions, possibly not fully cognizant of the country&#x27;s, and his own, predicament.

High foreign debts, food shortages, and an outmoded industrial base were among the factors that forced a new round of economic reforms. Once again, in the summer of 1980 price increases set off protests across the country, especially in the Gdańsk and Szczecin Shipyards. Unlike on previous occasions, the regime decided not to resort to force to suppress the strikes. In the Gdańsk Agreement and other accords reached with Polish workers, Gierek was forced to concede their right to strike, and the Solidarity labor union was born.

Shortly thereafter, in early September 1980, he was replaced by the Central Committee&#x27;s VI Plenum as party first secretary by Stanisław Kania, and removed from power. A popular and trusted leader in the early 1970s, Gierek left surrounded by infamy and ridicule, deserted by most of his collaborators. The VII Plenum in December 1980 held Gierek and Jaroszewicz personally liable for the situation in the country and removed them from the Central Committee. The extraordinary IX Congress of the PZPR, in an unprecedented move, voted in July 1981 to expel Gierek and his close associates from the party, as the delegates considered them responsible for the Solidarity-related crisis in Poland, and the First Secretary Kania was unable to prevent their action. The next first secretary of the PZPR, General Wojciech Jaruzelski, introduced martial law on 13 December 1981. Gierek was interned for a year from December 1981. Unlike the (also-interned) opposition activists, the internment status brought Gierek no social respect; he ended his political career as the era&#x27;s main pariah.

Edward Gierek died in July 2001 of pneumoconiosis in a hospital in Cieszyn, near the southern mountain resort of Ustroń where he spent his last years. By then his rule was seen more favourably, and over 10,000 people attended his funeral.

With his lifelong wife, Stanisława &quot;née&quot; Jędrusik, Gierek had two sons, one of whom is MEP Adam Gierek.

==Legacy==

In 1990, two books, based on extended interviews with Gierek by Janusz Rolicki, were published in Poland; the books became bestsellers.

Polish society is divided in its assessment of Gierek. His government is fondly remembered by some for the improved living standards the Poles enjoyed in the 1970s under his rule. He was the only PZPR leader for whom the Polish public showed signs of nostalgia, discernible especially after his death. When polled, 45% of Poles assessed Gierek&#x27;s legacy as largely positive, while only 22% judged him negatively.

Others emphasize that the improvements were only made possible by the unwise and unsustainable policies based on huge foreign loans, which led directly to the economic crises of the 1970s and 1980s. Judged in hindsight, the more than 24 billion US dollars borrowed were not well-spent.

Upon becoming first secretary in December 1970, Gierek promised himself that under his watch people would not be shot on the streets. In 1976 the security forces did intervene in strikes, but only after giving up their firearms. In 1980, they did not use force at all.

According to sociologist and left-wing politician Maciej Gdula, the social and cultural transformation that took place in Poland in the 1970s was even more fundamental than in the 1990s, following the political transition. Regarding the politics of alliance of the political and later also money elites with the middle class at the expense of the working class, he said &quot;the general idea of the relationship of forces in our society has remained the same from the 1970s, and the period of mass solidarity was an exception&quot; (&quot;mass solidarity&quot; being the years 1980–81). Since the time of Gierek, Polish society has been hegemonized by cultural perceptions and norms of the (at that time emerging) middle class. Terms like management, initiative, personality, or the individualistic maxim &quot;get educated, work hard and get ahead in life&quot;, combined with orderliness, replaced class consciousness and the socialist egalitarian concept, as workers were losing their symbolic status, to be eventually separated into a marginalized stratum.

<text>Willard Frank Libby (December 17, 1908 – September 8, 1980) was an American physical chemist noted for his role in the 1949 development of radiocarbon dating, a process which revolutionized archaeology and palaeontology. For his contributions to the team that developed this process, Libby was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1960.

A 1931 chemistry graduate of the University of California, Berkeley, from which he received his doctorate in 1933, he studied radioactive elements and developed sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. During World War II he worked in the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University, developing the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment.

After the war, Libby accepted a professorship at the University of Chicago&#x27;s Institute for Nuclear Studies, where he developed the technique for dating organic compounds using carbon-14. He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine. In 1950, he became a member of the General Advisory Committee (GAC) of the Atomic Energy Commission (AEC). He was appointed a commissioner in 1954, becoming its sole scientist. He sided with Edward Teller on pursuing a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb, participated in the Atoms for Peace program, and defended the administration&#x27;s atmospheric nuclear testing.

Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959 to become professor of chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA), a position he held until his retirement in 1976. In 1962, he became the director of the University of California statewide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP). He started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972, and as a member of the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California&#x27;s air pollution standards.

==Early life and career==
Willard Frank Libby was born in Parachute, Colorado, on December 17, 1908, the son of farmers Ora Edward Libby and his wife Eva May (née Rivers). He had two brothers, Elmer and Raymond, and two sisters, Eva and Evelyn. Libby began his education in a two-room Colorado schoolhouse. When he was five, Libby&#x27;s parents moved to Santa Rosa, California. He attended Analy High School, in Sebastopol, from which he graduated in 1926. Libby, who grew to be tall, played tackle on the high school football team.

In 1927 he entered the University of California, Berkeley, where he received his BS in 1931, and his PhD in 1933, writing his doctoral thesis on the &quot;Radioactivity of ordinary elements, especially samarium and neodymium: method of detection&quot; under the supervision of Wendell Mitchell Latimer. Independently of the work of George de Hevesy and Max Pahl, he discovered that the natural long-lived isotopes of samarium primarily decay by emission of alpha particles.

Libby was appointed Instructor in the department of chemistry at the University of California, Berkeley, in 1933. He became an assistant professor of chemistry there in 1938. He spent the 1930s building sensitive Geiger counters to measure weak natural and artificial radioactivity. He joined Berkeley&#x27;s chapter of Alpha Chi Sigma in 1941. That year he was awarded a Guggenheim Fellowship, and elected to work at Princeton University.

==Manhattan Project==
On December 8, 1941, the day after the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II, Libby volunteered his services to Nobel Prize laureate Harold Urey. Urey arranged for Libby to be given leave from the University of California, Berkeley and to join him at Columbia University to work on the Manhattan Project, the wartime project to develop atomic bombs, at what became its Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories. During his time in the New York City area, Libby was a resident of Leonia, New Jersey.

Over the next three years, Libby worked on the gaseous diffusion process for uranium enrichment. An atomic bomb required fissile material, and the fissile uranium-235 made up only 0.7 percent of natural uranium. The SAM Laboratories therefore had to find a way of separating kilograms of it from the more abundant uranium-238. Gaseous diffusion worked on the principle that a lighter gas diffuses through a barrier faster than a heavier one at a rate inversely proportional to its molecular weight. But the only known gas containing uranium was the highly corrosive uranium hexafluoride, and a suitable barrier was hard to find.

Through 1942, Libby and his team studied different barriers and the means to protect them from corrosion from the uranium hexafluoride. The most promising type was a barrier made of powdered nickel developed by Edward O. Norris of the Jelliff Manufacturing Corporation and Edward Adler from the City College of New York, which became known as the &quot;Norris-Adler&quot; barrier by late 1942.

In addition to developing a suitable barrier, the SAM Laboratories also had to assist in the design of a gaseous separation plant, which became known as K-25. Libby helped with the engineers from Kellex to produce a workable design for a pilot plant. Libby conducted a series of tests that indicated that the Norris-Adler barrier would work, and he remained confident that with an all-out effort, the remaining problems with it could be solved. Although doubts remained, construction work began on the K-25 full-scale production plant in September 1943.

As 1943 gave way to 1944, many problems remained. Tests began on the machinery at K-25 in April 1944 without a barrier. Attention turned to a new process developed by Kellex. Finally, in July 1944, Kellex barriers began to be installed in K-25. K-25 commenced operation in February 1945, and as cascade after cascade came online, the quality of the product increased. By April 1945, K-25 had attained a 1.1% enrichment. Uranium partially enriched in K-25 was fed into the calutrons at Y-12 to complete the enrichment process.

Construction of the upper stages of the K-25 plant was cancelled, and Kellex was directed to instead design and build a 540-stage side feed unit, which became known as K-27. The last of K-25&#x27;s 2,892 stages commenced operation in August 1945. On August 5, K-25 starting producing feed enriched to 23 percent uranium-235. K-25 and K-27 achieved their full potential only in the early postwar period, when they eclipsed the other production plants and became the prototypes for a new generation of plants. Enriched uranium was used in the Little Boy bomb employed in the bombing of Hiroshima on August 6, 1945. Libby brought home a stack of newspapers and told his wife, &quot;This is what I&#x27;ve been doing.&quot;

==Radiocarbon dating==
After the war, Libby accepted an offer from the University of Chicago of a professorship in the chemistry department at the new Institute for Nuclear Studies. He returned to his pre-war studies of radioactivity. In 1939, Serge Korff had discovered that cosmic rays generated neutrons in the upper atmosphere. These interact with nitrogen-14 in the air to produce carbon-14:
:1n + 14N → 14C + 1p
The half-life of carbon-14 is 5,730±40 years. Libby realized that when plants and animals die they cease to ingest fresh carbon-14, thereby giving any organic compound a built-in nuclear clock. He published his theory in 1946, and expanded on it in his monograph &quot;Radiocarbon Dating&quot; in 1955. He also developed sensitive radiation detectors that could make the measurements required by the technique. Tests against sequoia with known dates from their tree rings showed radiocarbon dating to be reliable and accurate. The technique revolutionised archaeology, palaeontology and other disciplines that dealt with ancient artefacts. In 1960, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;for his method to use carbon-14 for age determination in archaeology, geology, geophysics, and other branches of science&quot;. He also discovered that tritium similarly could be used for dating water, and therefore wine.

==Atomic Energy Commission==
Atomic Energy Commission (AEC) Chairman Gordon Dean appointed Libby to its influential General Advisory Committee (GAC) in 1950. In 1954, he was appointed an AEC commissioner by President Dwight D. Eisenhower on the recommendation of Dean&#x27;s successor, Lewis Strauss. Libby and his family moved from Chicago to Washington, D.C. He brought with him a truckload of scientific equipment, which he used to establish a laboratory at the Carnegie Institution there to continue his studies of amino acids. Staunchly conservative politically, he was one of the few scientists who sided with Edward Teller rather than Robert Oppenheimer during the debate on whether it was wise to pursue a crash program to develop the hydrogen bomb. As a commissioner, Libby played an important role in promoting Eisenhower&#x27;s Atoms for Peace program, and was part of the United States delegation at the Geneva Conferences on Peaceful Uses of Atomic Energy in 1955 and 1958.

As the only scientist among the five AEC commissioners, it fell to Libby to defend the Eisenhower administration&#x27;s stance on atmospheric nuclear testing. He argued that the dangers of radiation from nuclear tests were less than that from chest X-rays, and therefore less important than the risk of having an inadequate nuclear arsenal, but his arguments failed to convince the scientific community or reassure the public. In January 1956, he publicly revealed the existence of Project Sunshine, a series of secret research studies to ascertain the impact of radioactive fallout on the world&#x27;s population that he had initiated in 1953 while serving on the GAC. The project caused controversy after it was revealed to the public and with the revelation it was found out that much of the research involved stealing the bodies of dead children without the parents&#x27; consent and doing radioactive experiments on them. Many of the 1,500 sample cadavers were babies and young children, and were taken from countries from Australia to Europe, often without their parents&#x27; consent or knowledge. By 1958, even Libby and Teller were supporting limits on atmospheric nuclear testing.

==UCLA==

Libby resigned from the AEC in 1959, and he became professor of chemistry at University of California, Los Angeles, a position he held until his retirement in 1976. He taught honors freshman chemistry. In 1962, he became the director of the University of California statewide Institute of Geophysics and Planetary Physics (IGPP), a position he also held until 1976. His time as director encompassed the Apollo space program and the lunar landings. 

Libby started the first Environmental Engineering program at UCLA in 1972. As a member of the California Air Resources Board, he worked to develop and improve California&#x27;s air pollution standards. He established a research program to investigate heterogeneous catalysis with the idea of reducing emissions from motor vehicles through more complete fuel combustion. The election of Richard Nixon as president in 1968 generated speculation that Libby might be appointed as Presidential Science Advisor. There was a storm of protest from scientists who felt that Libby was too conservative, and the offer was not made.

Although Libby retired and became a professor emeritus in 1976, he remained professionally active until his death in 1980.

==Awards and honors==
Libby was an elected member of the National Academy of Sciences, the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society. In addition to the Nobel Prize, he received numerous honors and awards, including Columbia University&#x27;s Chandler Medal in 1954, the Remsen Memorial Lecture Award in 1955, the Bicentennial Lecture Award from the City College of New York and the Nuclear Applications in Chemistry Award in 1956, the Franklin Institute&#x27;s Elliott Cresson Medal in 1957, the American Chemical Society&#x27;s Willard Gibbs Award in 1958, the Joseph Priestley Award from Dickinson College and the Albert Einstein Medal in 1959, the Geological Society of America&#x27;s Arthur L. Day Medal in 1961, the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement in 1961, the Gold Medal of the American Institute of Chemists in 1970, and the Lehman Award from the New York Academy of Sciences in 1971. He was elected a member of the National Academy of Sciences in 1950. Analy High School library has a mural of Libby, and a Sebastopol city park and a nearby highway are named in his honor. His 1947 paper on radiocarbon dating was honored by a Citation for Chemical Breakthrough Award from the Division of History of Chemistry of the American Chemical Society presented to the University of Chicago in 2016.

==Personal life==
In 1940, Libby married Leonor Hickey, a physical education teacher. They had twin daughters, Janet Eva and Susan Charlotte, who were born in 1945.

In 1966 Libby divorced Leonor and married Leona Woods Marshall, a distinguished nuclear physicist who was one of the original builders of Chicago Pile-1, the world&#x27;s first nuclear reactor. She joined him at UCLA as a professor of environmental engineering in 1973. Through this second marriage he acquired two stepsons, the children of her first marriage.

Libby died at the UCLA Medical Center in Los Angeles on September 8, 1980, from a blood clot in his lung complicated by pneumonia. His papers are in the Charles E. Young Research Library at UCLA. Seven volumes of his papers were edited by Leona and Rainer Berger and published in 1981.

<doc id="245686" wikidata="Q1763170" url="?curid=245686" title="Ritz Crackers">
<text>Ritz Crackers is a brand of snack cracker introduced by Nabisco in 1934. The original style crackers are disc-shaped, lightly salted, and approximately in diameter. Each cracker has seven perforations and a finely edge. Today, the Ritz cracker brand is owned by Mondelēz International.

A single serving of the original cracker (about 5 crackers or 15 grams) provides of food energy, 1 gram of protein, and 4 grams of fat; the whole wheat variety provides and 2.5 grams of fat.

==History==
In the early 1900s, the Jackson Cracker company of Jackson, Michigan, developed a small, round cracker called the Jaxon. The company was bought by Nabisco in 1919. Nabisco introduced the Ritz Cracker in 1934. Looking to compete with the similar &quot;Hi Ho&quot; cracker made by their competitor Sunshine Biscuits, they tasked an employee, Sydney Stern, to create a name and a marketing plan. Stern chose the name &#x27;Ritz&#x27;, which appealed to individuals enduring the privations of the Great Depression by offering them &quot;a bite of the good life&quot;. He also designed the blue circle/yellow lettering logo design, inspired by the round label inside his hat. 

Beyond the branding, the design of the crackers themselves plays a functional role. The seven holes punched into each cracker aren&#x27;t just for aesthetics; they allow steam to escape during baking, preventing air pockets and ensuring a uniform and consistent texture, without becoming overly crispy or flaky. 

In 2011, Ritz was identified in a YouGov poll as the &quot;best perceived snack brand&quot; among American consumers.

A cartoon drawing of a box of Ritz Crackers can be seen in &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Surprise Party&quot; (1939), an animated theatrical advertisement/cartoon short produced by Walt Disney Productions for Nabisco.

==Europe==
Ritz Crackers varieties include Original, Peanut Butter, Roasted Vegetable, Honey Wheat, Garlic Butter, Bacon, Reduced Fat, Hint of Salt, Whole Wheat, Everything and Ritz Fresh Stacks.

A 42-gram &quot;fresh stack&quot; sleeve typically consists of 13 crackers, and contains 220 calories. A standard 126-gram sleeve consists of 32 crackers, and contains 512 calories.

==International ==

Ritz Crackers are available in the United Kingdom and Ireland in three varieties: Original and Cheese flavour, which were sold in 200 g boxes, and Ritz Cheese Sandwich (a cheese spread sandwiched between two Ritz Crackers), available in 125 g roll packs and 33 g snack packs. They are available as mini-crackers in 25g multi-packs.

==Controversy==
In May 2024, 200 g boxes were replaced with 150 g boxes but the price remained the same. A BBC report cited this as an example of Shrinkflation.

<doc id="245688" wikidata="Q2162701" url="?curid=245688" title="Inverse Laplace transform">
<text>In mathematics, the inverse Laplace transform of a function formula_1 is a real function formula_2 that is piecewise-continuous, exponentially-restricted (that is, formula_3 formula_4 for some constants formula_5 and formula_6) and has the property:

:formula_7
where formula_8 denotes the Laplace transform.

It can be proven that, if a function formula_1 has the inverse Laplace transform formula_2, then formula_2 is uniquely determined (considering functions which differ from each other only on a point set having Lebesgue measure zero as the same). This result was first proven by Mathias Lerch in 1903 and is known as Lerch&#x27;s theorem.

The Laplace transform and the inverse Laplace transform together have a number of properties that make them useful for analysing linear dynamical systems.

==Mellin&#x27;s inverse formula==
An integral formula for the inverse Laplace transform, called the &quot;Mellin&#x27;s inverse formula&quot;, the &quot;Bromwich integral&quot;, or the &quot;Fourier–Mellin integral&quot;, is given by the line integral:
:formula_12
where the integration is done along the vertical line formula_13 in the complex plane such that formula_14 is greater than the real part of all singularities of formula_1 and formula_1 is bounded on the line, for example if the contour path is in the region of convergence. If all singularities are in the left half-plane, or formula_1 is an entire function, then formula_14 can be set to zero and the above inverse integral formula becomes identical to the inverse Fourier transform.

In practice, computing the complex integral can be done by using the Cauchy residue theorem.

==Post&#x27;s inversion formula==
Post&#x27;s inversion formula for Laplace transforms, named after Emil Post, is a simple-looking but usually impractical formula for evaluating an inverse Laplace transform.

The statement of the formula is as follows: Let formula_2 be a continuous function on the interval formula_20 of exponential order, i.e.

: formula_21

for some real number formula_22. Then for all formula_23, the Laplace transform for formula_2 exists and is infinitely differentiable with respect to formula_25. Furthermore, if formula_1 is the Laplace transform of formula_2, then the inverse Laplace transform of formula_1 is given by

: formula_29

for formula_30, where formula_31 is the formula_32-th derivative of formula_33 with respect to formula_25.

As can be seen from the formula, the need to evaluate derivatives of arbitrarily high orders renders this formula impractical for most purposes.
With the advent of powerful personal computers, the main efforts to use this formula have come from dealing with approximations or asymptotic analysis of the Inverse Laplace transform, using the Grunwald–Letnikov differintegral to evaluate the derivatives. 
Post&#x27;s inversion has attracted interest due to the improvement in computational science and the fact that it is not necessary to know where the poles of formula_1 lie, which make it possible to calculate the asymptotic behaviour for big formula_36 using inverse Mellin transforms for several arithmetical functions related to the Riemann hypothesis.

<doc id="245693" wikidata="Q597180" url="?curid=245693" title="Kilroy was here">
<text>Kilroy was here is a meme that became popular during World War II, typically seen in graffiti. Its origin is debated, but the phrase and the distinctive accompanying doodle became associated with GIs in the 1940s: a bald-headed man (sometimes depicted as having a few hairs) with a prominent nose peeking over a wall with his fingers clutching the wall.

&quot;Mr Chad&quot; or just &quot;Chad&quot; was the version that became popular in the United Kingdom. The character of Chad may have been derived from a British cartoonist in 1938, possibly pre-dating &quot;Kilroy was here&quot;. According to Dave Wilton, &quot;Some time during the war, Chad and Kilroy met, and in the spirit of Allied unity merged, with the British drawing appearing over the American phrase.&quot; Other names for the character include Smoe, Clem, Flywheel, Private Snoops, Overby, Eugene the Jeep, Scabooch, and Sapo.

According to Charles Panati, &quot;The outrageousness of the graffiti was not so much what it said, but where it turned up.&quot; It is not known if there was an actual person named Kilroy who inspired the graffiti, although there have been claims over the years.

== Origin and use of the phrase ==

The phrase may have originated through United States servicemen who would draw the picture and the text &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; on the walls and other places where they were stationed, encamped, or visited. An ad in &quot;Life&quot; magazine noted that WWII-era servicemen were fond of claiming that &quot;whatever beach-head they stormed, they always found notices chalked up ahead of them, that &#x27;Kilroy was here. &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; notes that it was particularly associated with the Air Transport Command, at least when observed in the United Kingdom. At some point, the graffiti (Chad) and slogan (Kilroy was here) must have merged.

Many sources claim origin as early as 1939. Earlier examples of the phrase dating from 1937 are unverified.

According to one story, German intelligence found the phrase on captured American equipment. This led Adolf Hitler to believe that Kilroy could be the name or codename of a high-level Allied spy. At the time of the Potsdam Conference in 1945, it was rumored that Stalin found &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; written in the VIP bathroom, prompting him to ask his aides who Kilroy was. War photographer Robert Capa noted a use of the phrase at Bastogne during the Battle of the Bulge in December 1944: &quot;On the black, charred walls of an abandoned barn, scrawled in white chalk, was the legend of Gen. Anthony McAuliffe&#x27;s soldiers: KILROY WAS STUCK HERE.&quot;

=== Foo was here ===
&quot;Digger History, the Unofficial history of the Australian &amp; New Zealand Armed Services&quot;, says of Foo that &quot;He was chalked on the side of railway carriages, appeared in probably every camp that the 1st AIF World War I served in and generally made his presence felt&quot;. If this is the case, then &quot;Foo was here&quot; predates the American version of World War II, &quot;Kilroy was here&quot;, by about 25 years. &quot;Foo&quot; was thought of as a gremlin by the Royal Australian Air Force. It has been claimed that Foo came from the acronym for Forward Observation Officer.

=== Real Kilroys ===

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; says simply that Kilroy was &quot;the name of a mythical person&quot;.

One theory identifies James J. Kilroy (1902–1962), an American shipyard inspector, as the man behind the signature. James Kilroy had served on the Boston City Council and represented the Roxbury district in the Massachusetts Legislature during the 1930s. He worked at the Fore River Shipyard in Quincy during the war checking the work of riveters paid by how many rivets they installed. Usually, inspectors made a small chalk mark which riveters used to erase, so that they would be paid double for their work. To prevent this, Kilroy marked work he had inspected and approved with the phrase &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; in more durable crayon.

More than 40 candidates claimed to have originated the phrase and cartoon in response to a 1946 contest conducted by the American Transit Association to establish the origin of the phenomenon. James Kilroy was credited after his claim was verified by shipyard officials and the riveters whose work he inspected. While Kilroy&#x27;s marks might normally have been painted over, interior painting was a low priority in the rush to launch ships, so Kilroy&#x27;s marks were seen by thousands of servicemen who sailed aboard troopships built at Quincy. A &quot;New York Times&quot; article noted that Kilroy had marked the ships as they were being built as a way to be sure that he had inspected a compartment, and the phrase would be found chalked in places that nobody could have reached for graffiti, such as inside sealed hull spaces. &quot;Brewer&#x27;s Dictionary of Phrase and Fable&quot; notes this as a possible origin, but suggests that &quot;the phrase grew by accident.&quot;

The &quot;Lowell Sun&quot; reported in November 1945 that Sgt. Francis J. Kilroy Jr. from Everett, Massachusetts, wrote &quot;Kilroy will be here next week&quot; on a barracks bulletin board at a Boca Raton, Florida, airbase while ill with flu, and the phrase was picked up by other airmen and quickly spread abroad. The Associated Press similarly reported Sgt. Kilroy&#x27;s account of being hospitalized early in World War II, and his friend Sgt. James Maloney wrote the phrase on a bulletin board. Maloney continued to write the shortened phrase when he was shipped out a month later, according to the AP account, and other airmen soon picked it up. Francis Kilroy only wrote the phrase a couple of times.

== Chad ==

The figure was initially known in the United Kingdom as &quot;Mr Chad&quot; and would appear with the slogan &quot;Wot, no sugar&quot; or a similar phrase bemoaning shortages and rationing. He often appeared with a single curling hair that resembled a question mark and with crosses in his eyes. The phrase &quot;Wot, no __?&quot; pre-dates &quot;Chad&quot; and was widely used separately from the doodle. Chad was used by the RAF and civilians; he was known in the army as Private Snoops, and in the navy he was called The Watcher. Chad might have first been drawn by British cartoonist George Edward Chatterton in 1938. Chatterton was nicknamed &quot;Chat&quot;, which may then have become &quot;Chad&quot;. &quot;Life Magazine&quot; wrote in 1946 that the RAF and army were competing to claim him as their own invention, but they agreed that he had first appeared around 1944. The character resembles Alice the Goon, a character in Popeye who first appeared in 1933, and another name for Chad was &quot;The Goon&quot;.

A spokesman for the Royal Air Force Museum London suggested in 1977 that Chad was probably an adaptation of the Greek letter omega, used as the symbol for electrical resistance; his creator was probably an electrician in a ground crew. &quot;Life&quot; suggested that Chad originated with REME, and noted that a symbol for alternating current resembles Chad (a sine wave through a straight line), that the plus and minus signs in his eyes represent polarity, and that his fingers are symbols of electrical resistors. The character is usually drawn in Australia with pluses and minuses as eyes and the nose and eyes resemble a distorted sine wave. &quot;The Guardian&quot; suggested in 2000 that &quot;Mr. Chad&quot; was based on a diagram representing an electrical circuit. One correspondent said that a man named Dickie Lyle was at RAF Yatesbury in 1941, and he drew a version of the diagram as a face when the instructor had left the room and wrote &quot;Wot, no leave?&quot; beneath it. This idea was repeated in a submission to the BBC in 2005 which included a story of a 1941 radar lecturer in Gainsborough, Lincolnshire, who drew the circuit diagram with the words &quot;WOT! No electrons?&quot; The RAF Cranwell Apprentices Association says that the image came from a diagram of how to approximate a square wave using sine waves, also at RAF Yatesbury and with an instructor named Chadwick. This version was initially called Domie or Doomie, and &quot;Life&quot; noted that Doomie was used by the RAF. REME claimed that the name came from their training school, nicknamed &quot;Chad&#x27;s Temple&quot;; the RAF claimed that it arose from Chadwick House at a Lancashire radio school; and the Desert Rats claimed that it came from an officer in El Alamein.

It is unclear how Chad gained widespread popularity or became conflated with Kilroy. It was, however, widely in use by the late part of the war and in the immediate post-war years, with slogans ranging from the simple &quot;What, no bread?&quot; or &quot;Wot, no char?&quot; to the plaintive; one sighting was on the side of a British 1st Airborne Division glider in Operation Market Garden with the complaint &quot;Wot, no engines?&quot; The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported in 1946 that Chad was &quot;the No. 1 doodle&quot;, noting his appearance on a wall in the Houses of Parliament after the 1945 Labour election victory, with &quot;Wot, no Tories?&quot; Trains in Austria in 1946 featured Mr. Chad along with the phrase &quot;Wot—no Fuehrer?&quot;

As rationing became less common, so did the joke. The cartoon is occasionally seen today as &quot;Kilroy was here&quot;, but &quot;Chad&quot; and his complaints have long fallen from popular use, although they continue to be seen occasionally on walls and in references in popular culture.

== Smoe ==

Writing about the Kilroy phenomenon in 1946, &quot; The Milwaukee Journal&quot; describes the doodle as the European counterpart to &quot;Kilroy was here&quot;, under the name Smoe. It also says that Smoe was called Clem in the African theater. It noted that next to &quot;Kilroy was here&quot; was often added &quot;And so was Smoe&quot;. While Kilroy enjoyed a resurgence of interest after the war due to radio shows and comic writers, the name Smoe had already disappeared by the end of 1946. A B-24 airman writing in 1998 also noted the distinction between the character of Smoe and Kilroy (who he says was never pictured), and suggested that Smoe stood for &quot;Sad men of Europe&quot;. Correspondents to &quot;Life&quot; magazine in 1962 also insisted that Clem, Mr. Chad or Luke the Spook was the name of the figure, and that Kilroy was unpictured. The editor suggested that the names were all synonymous early in the war, then later separated into separate characters.

== Other names ==
Similar drawings appear in many countries. Herbie (Canada), Overby (Los Angeles, late 1960s), Flywheel, Private Snoops, The Jeep, and Clem (Canada) are alternative names. An advertisement in &quot;Billboard&quot; in November 1946 for plastic &quot;Kilroys&quot; also used the names Clem, Heffinger, Luke the Spook, Smoe, and Stinkie. &quot;Luke the Spook&quot; was the name of a B-29 bomber, and its nose-art resembles the doodle and is said to have been created at the Boeing factory in Seattle. In Chile, the graphic is known as a &quot;sapo&quot; (slang for nosy).

In Poland, Kilroy is replaced with &quot;Józef Tkaczuk&quot; or &quot;M. Pulina&quot;. In Russia, the phrase &quot;Vasya was here&quot; () is a notorious piece of graffiti.

==In popular culture==
Peter Viereck wrote in 1948 that &quot;God is like Kilroy. He, too, Sees it all.&quot;

Kilroy is seen scrawling &quot;Kilroy is here&quot; on a wall in Tennessee Williams&#x27;s 1953 play &quot;Camino Real&quot;, which he revises to &quot;was&quot; before his final departure. Kilroy functions in the play as &quot;a folk character ... who here is a sort of Everyman.&quot; The graffiti appears on the cover of the first edition published by New Directions. Isaac Asimov&#x27;s short story &quot;The Message&quot; (1955) depicts a time-travelling George Kilroy from the 30th century as the writer of the graffiti.

Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s novel &quot;V.&quot; (1963) includes the proposal that the Kilroy doodle originated from a band-pass filter diagram.

The Move recorded a song called &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot;, written by Roy Wood, on their 1968 album &quot;Move&quot;. The lyrics specifically refer to the graffiti: &quot;Kilroy was here / Left his name around the place / Kilroy was here / But I&#x27;ve never seen his face.&quot; In his 2024 book on Wood, James R. Turner writes that the song&#x27;s narrator &quot;speculates about [Kilroy&#x27;s] identity using wonderful rhyming couplets, as well as commentating that Kilroy seems to get around a lot.&quot;

Ken Young wrote a parody of &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; which was transmitted to Apollo 8 on 25 December 1968. It featured the lines &quot;When what to his wondering eyes should appear, but a Burma-Shave sign saying, &#x27;Kilroy was here&#x27;.&quot;

In the 1975 &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; episode &quot;The Bus&quot;, Hawkeye Pierce (Alan Alda) writes &quot;Kilroy&quot; in a dust-encrusted bus window as B.J. Hunnicutt (Mike Farrell) peers out from behind the window, his hands and nose resting on its top edge.

In 1983, rock band Styx released their seventh studio album, &quot;Kilroy Was Here&quot;. The album functions as a light rock opera, telling the story of Robert Kilroy, a rock and roll performer who was placed in a futuristic prison for &quot;rock and roll misfits&quot; by the anti-rock-and-roll group the Majority for Musical Morality (MMM) and its founder Dr. Everett Righteous. When Jonathan Chance (played by guitarist Tommy Shaw) finally meets Kilroy at the very end of the song Mr. Roboto, Kilroy unmasks and yells, &quot;I&#x27;m Kilroy! Kilroy!&quot; ending the song.

Kilroy was also featured on New Zealand stamp #1422 issued on 19 March 1997.

In the opening credits of the 2009 American sitcom &quot;Community&quot;, two Kilroys are drawn in blue ink on the inside of a paper fortune teller, their noses forming the L&#x27;s of lead actor Joel McHale&#x27;s name.

==History==

===Overview===
Chicago Fire FC was founded as Chicago Fire Soccer Club on October 8, 1997. The club is named after the Great Chicago Fire of 1871; the official founding date of the team was the 126th anniversary of that event. The owner and chairman of the Fire is Joe Mansueto, who purchased the club in 2019. The club president is Ishwara Glassman-Chrein; Georg Heitz was appointed sporting director in December 2019; The Fire were originally based at Soldier Field from 1997 to 2006. From 2006 to 2019, the club played at SeatGeek Stadium, a stadium originally built for the club, at 71st and Harlem Avenue in Bridgeview. In 2019, with the change of ownership to Joe Mansueto, the Fire returned to Soldier Field for the 2020 MLS season. The Fire are currently one of the most successful clubs in the U.S. Open Cup, winning championships in 1998, 2000, 2003, and 2006.

Many notable players have worn the Fire shirt, including U.S. internationals Chris Armas, Carlos Bocanegra, Frank Klopas, DaMarcus Beasley, Brian McBride, Tony Sanneh, Cory Gibbs, Ante Razov, Josh Wolff, Eric Wynalda and Jon Busch. Some of the club&#x27;s other notable American professional players include C.J. Brown, Jesse Marsch, Chris Rolfe, and Zach Thornton. The Fire also have a reputation for importing international talent, from established veterans like Bastian Schweinsteiger, Pável Pardo, Piotr Nowak, Cuauhtémoc Blanco, Tomasz Frankowski, Luboš Kubík, Hristo Stoichkov and Jorge Campos; in addition to younger players such as Patrick Nyarko, Marco Pappa, Damani Ralph, Bakary Soumaré and Nery Castillo.

Chicago was once the home of the Chicago Sting who competed in the top-level North American Soccer League (NASL) from 1975 to 1984. They spread their home games at Soldier Field, Wrigley Field, and Comiskey Park. The Sting won the Soccer Bowl twice: 1981 and 1984. They were the only club other than the New York Cosmos to win multiple titles in the NASL. Some of the club&#x27;s notable players were Argentine striker Pato Margetic and German forwards Karl-Heinz Granitza and Arno Steffenhagen.

===Foundation and initial success (1997–2000)===

Founded in 1997 at Navy Pier, on the anniversary of the Great Fire, the Fire immediately tapped into the diverse ethnic makeup of the city. The team brought in Polish players Piotr Nowak, Jerzy Podbrożny, and Roman Kosecki; the Mexican Jorge Campos; and the Czech Luboš Kubík. While all showed their talent while playing for Chicago that first year, American players (Zach Thornton, Chris Armas, C.J. Brown) proved most integral to the Fire&#x27;s continued success. Under the club&#x27;s first head coach, Bob Bradley—and against all expectation—the team completed the double in its first competitive year, beating D.C. United in the 1998 MLS Cup Final, and defeating the Columbus Crew in Chicago to win the 1998 U.S. Open Cup a week later.

The team&#x27;s momentum continued, reaching the 2000 MLS Cup final &quot;(losing to Kansas City)&quot; and winning the 2000 U.S. Open Cup. Internationally experienced players such as Hristo Stoitchkov joined the Fire, while young American talents such as DaMarcus Beasley developed. The Fire quickly became cemented as one of the league&#x27;s preeminent teams.

===Nomadic times (2002–2004)===
With Soldier Field undergoing massive renovations, the Fire moved to the western Chicago suburb of Naperville in 2002. That same year, Bob Bradley abruptly departed the team to lead the MetroStars, from his home state of New Jersey. The Fire then selected the U.S. men&#x27;s national team&#x27;s top assistant, Dave Sarachan, to assume the vacant post.

Chicago qualified for the league final while also capturing the Supporters&#x27; Shield and 2003 U.S. Open Cup along the way. The team returned to Chicago and the renovated Soldier Field midway through the 2003 season.

After that season, longtime captain Piotr Nowak retired to take a position in the front office. He departed a year later to become manager of D.C. United. In this period new talent emerged, including Jamaican striker Damani Ralph. Still, stagnating performances and the building strength of the Eastern Conference made Chicago&#x27;s league position ever more tenuous. In 2004, the team missed the league playoffs for the first time in their history.

===Turmoil, and a permanent home (2005–2007)===
The 2005 season began with the unexpected dismissal of popular club president Peter Wilt by then-owners AEG, a move decried by fans, many players, and club staff. This came as a shock, given his brokering of a $100m deal to build the Fire a stadium in the collar suburb of Bridgeview. He was immediately replaced by MetroStars executive John Guppy.

Competitively, the season was most notable for the blockbuster visit of Milan from Italy&#x27;s Serie A, and the surprising 4–0 away defeat of D.C. United in the Eastern Conference Semi-finals.

2006 arrived, and the Fire moved from Soldier Field into its new stadium in Bridgeview, a southwest suburb of Chicago: Toyota Park, located at the corner of 71st Street and Harlem Avenue. In its first season, it played host to an unspectacular league campaign; but victory in the 2006 U.S. Open Cup marked a continuation of the club&#x27;s successes and promise for the future.

The anxiety to win another league title continued to grow, however. Sarachan entered 2007 (his fifth season in charge) under intense pressure from fans and the administration to produce a league championship. Tension mounted further on April 3, 2007, when the Fire signed Mexico and América star Cuauhtémoc Blanco to a Designated Player contract. After a perfect three matches to open the year, they won only one of their next eight, and Sarachan was dismissed. Following a brief search, Millonarios manager Juan Carlos Osorio was named the club&#x27;s third head coach.

=== Andell Inc. acquisition of the Fire (2007–2009)===

More change came soon afterward. On September 6, 2007, Andell Holdings, a Los Angeles-based private investment firm controlled by chairman Andrew Hauptman, acquired AEG&#x27;s interest in the Chicago Fire Soccer Club. Reports estimated the purchase price to be upwards of $35 million. The team has not won a major trophy since Hauptman bought the team.

On the field, behind Blanco and Wilman Conde, Osorio&#x27;s central defender at Millionarios, the Fire went on an extended unbeaten run to close the season, easily qualifying for the playoffs but were defeated at New England in the Eastern Conference Final. On December 10, 2007, the Fire announced Osorio&#x27;s resignation. He was named manager of the New York Red Bulls eight days later. Hauptman filed tampering charges with the league in protest, and the Fire were compensated by the Red Bulls with cash and draft picks.

Changes came quickly in Osorio&#x27;s wake. On January 17, 2008, former Fire star Frank Klopas was named Technical Director in charge of player personnel, and longtime Fire assistant Denis Hamlett was appointed manager. While the Fire struggled at home in 2008 the team found unusual success on the road, gathering 22 out of a possible 45 away points. Momentum grew with the long-anticipated signing of Chicago native Brian McBride on a free transfer in July 2008. After disposing of the Red Bulls 5–2 in the season&#x27;s final game, they decisively conquered New England in the first round of the playoffs with a 3–0 victory at home. This was Chicago&#x27;s first playoff advancement over the Revolution in four consecutive seasons. But triumph only lasted for a week, as they again missed the league final with their 2–1 Eastern Conference Final loss to eventual champion Columbus.

The 2009 season saw few alterations to the previous year&#x27;s roster. The story of the season was much the same, as continued poor home form offset excellent performances away from Toyota Park. This led to a second place Eastern Conference finish behind Columbus. Despite this, Real Salt Lake managed to upset the Crew in the quarterfinals, meaning Chicago would host the semi-final for the first time in six years. Chicago&#x27;s nearly flawless home playoff history meant little in the end, as they lost to Salt Lake, 5–3, on penalties after 120 scoreless minutes. Shortly thereafter, manager Denis Hamlett was dismissed.

===A team in flux (2010–2012)===
Leading up to 2010, Chicago hired Carlos de los Cobos as head coach, previously manager of El Salvador. Cuauhtémoc Blanco, Chris Rolfe and Gonzalo Segares all departed. More changes came in the summer transfer window with the trade of Justin Mapp to Philadelphia, the acquisition of Mexican international striker Nery Castillo, and the trade for former Swedish international midfielder Freddie Ljungberg. Defender Gonzalo Segares returned to the Fire, leaving Apollon Limassol after only six months away. Despite these reinforcements, the Fire failed to qualify for the playoffs for only the second time in club history. Former U.S. international Brian McBride and club original C.J. Brown retired at season&#x27;s end, followed closely by the departures of Wilman Conde, Ljungberg, and Castillo.

2011 began much in the way of 2010, with foundering performances both home and away. After nine winless matches, Carlos de los Cobos was let go on May 30, 2011. Technical Director Frank Klopas was named interim head coach. Behind summer reinforcements Pável Pardo and Sebastián Grazzini, as well as forward Dominic Oduro&#x27;s 12 goals after being acquired in a trade from Houston and Dan Gargan&#x27;s defensive addition, the Fire qualified for the U.S. Open Cup Final (lost at Seattle) and narrowly missed making the playoffs after gaining 24 points in their last 12 league matches. After the season&#x27;s conclusion, Klopas was given the permanent manager job on November 3, 2011.

Although expectations were modest for 2012, Klopas&#x27; first full season as coach, the year saw a change in fortune for the Fire. The spring and summer months saw several new acquisitions for the club, starting with the reacquiring of Chris Rolfe from Aalborg BK. Rolfe, who scored eight goals and 12 assists in the 21 games he played in 2012, would later be named the Fire&#x27;s MVP. Other signings included Brazilian midfielders Alex Monteiro de Lima from the Swiss side FC Wohlen, Alvaro Fernández from Seattle Sounders FC, forward Sherjill MacDonald from Beerschot AC of Belgium and veteran defender Arne Friedrich from VfL Wolfsburg. Although they would fall out of the U.S. Open tournament early that season, the Fire eventually compiled a 17–11–6 record, their best since 2000, and ranked as high as second in the Eastern Conference before ending the year in fourth place. On October 31, 2012, in their first playoff appearance since 2009, the Fire lost their first-round MLS Cup playoff match-up at home against the Houston Dynamo, 2–1.

=== Missing the playoffs (2013–2015) ===
In the 2012–2013 offseason, the franchise made some moves to improve on 2012&#x27;s success. The team acquired Joel Lindpere and Jeff Larentowicz and also traded Dominic Oduro for Dilly Duka and the rights to Robbie Rogers. The beginning of the season saw the team struggling to score goals, resulting in a record of 2–5–1 through April. After two successive losses to the Union in May, and with veteran Arne Friedrich still on injured reserve, the Fire acquired their former centerback Bakary Soumaré from Philadelphia. Also in May, Robbie Rogers expressed an interest to play in Southern California, at which point a deal was brokered for Rogers&#x27; rights in exchange for Chicago native Mike Magee from the Los Angeles Galaxy. On June 23, 2013, Friedrich, who had not played a 2012–13 game due to recurring injuries, announced his retirement. After starting the season 2–7–3, the additions of Soumare and Magee led to seven wins in the squad&#x27;s last 10 games. The Fire were busy in the transfer window as well, adding veteran defensive midfielder Arévalo Ríos and forward Juan Luis Anangonó. The Chicago Fire also advanced to host the semifinal of the 2013 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, but fell 2–0 to eventual champions D.C. United. Alleged fan actions in the stadium that night led to a famous editorial piece, &quot;What it means to be a part of the Fire family&quot;, being penned by the club&#x27;s Director of Communications, which was seen as an odd attack on the fan base and widely panned by local and national media. After a 12–6–6 finish to the season, the Fire narrowly missed the playoffs for the third time in the last four years—losing out to the Montreal Impact on goal difference. On October 30, 2013, the club announced that the president of soccer operations Javier Leon and head coach Frank Klopas had stepped down, but the Fire front office had a replacement one day later.
On October 31, 2013, Chicago Fire named Frank Yallop as its new head coach and director of soccer. On December 5, 2013, Fire MVP Mike Magee became the first Fire player to win the MLS MVP Award—beating out Los Angeles Galaxy&#x27;s Robbie Keane and Montreal Impact&#x27;s Marco Di Vaio for the honor.
Meanwhile, Yallop was busy recruiting a new coaching staff which included &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; member and Chicago Fire veteran C. J. Brown and former U.S. International striker Clint Mathis as the team&#x27;s assistant coaches, adding Columbus Crew&#x27;s Brian Bliss as Technical Director. Former Fire forward Brian McBride was added as an assistant coach in May 2014 for a short-term assignment.
The shake-up extended to the roster, as Yallop moved team veterans and starters and brought in youth prospects—reforming the team while freeing up cap space. Major exits in early 2014 included Chris Rolfe, Austin Berry, Jalil Anibaba, Daniel Paladini, and Paolo Tornaghi. Filling that void was a handful of youth prospects including Harrison Shipp (homegrown player), Benji Joya (via MLS &quot;weighted lottery&quot;), and Grant Ward on loan from Tottenham Hotspur. Despite rarely looking like a team that could advance to the MLS Cup Playoffs, the team once again advanced to the semifinals of the 2014 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, but were routed 6–0 by eventual champions Seattle Sounders FC on August 13. The result was the worst competitive defeat in club history and saw Frank Yallop issue an apology to Chicago Fire supporters on the club&#x27;s official website. As the Cup run had, the season ended in disappointment, with the Fire ending the season with a 6–18–10 record, with 18 draws, also setting a record for most draws in an MLS season in the process.

The club began 2015 with renewed hope, bringing three new Designated Player signings in David Accam, Shaun Maloney and Kennedy Igboananike to bolster an anemic attack. The club also signed products Michael Stephens and Eric Gehrig as well as Trinindad &amp; Tobago international Joevin Jones. With so many new pieces needing to adjust, 2015 marked the first time in club history the side began the season with an 0–3–0 record, but they showed signs of recovery by winning their next three matches. Unfortunately, April was the last time the club would be anywhere near equal on wins and losses, but the side did still advance to another Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup semifinal. Playing in front of a sparse crowd at the Philadelphia Union&#x27;s PPL Park, the Fire fell 1–0 at the same hurdle for the third straight season. Less than two weeks later, Maloney, who was the club&#x27;s center piece offseason signing, was transferred back to England with Hull City citing personal reasons.

Despite no hope for a Cup final, widespread fan protests and dim likelihood of a playoff berth, the club didn&#x27;t part ways with Frank Yallop until September 20, 2015, one day after another listless 1–0 home defeat to Orlando City SC. Along with Yallop&#x27;s departure, the club announced it had named long-time MLS executive Nelson Rodríguez as the club&#x27;s new general manager, with his first job being to commence a search for a new head coach. Technical director Brian Bliss was given the interim head coaching job, with former player and current club vice president Logan Pause assisting for the remaining five matches. The club has finished the 2015 season with an overall record of 8 wins, 20 losses and 6 ties. For the first time in the club&#x27;s history Fire finished the season with zero road wins (0–12–5). Twenty losses in a season became the highest in the club&#x27;s history.

=== Final years in Bridgeview, Illinois (2016–2019) ===
On November 18, 2015, Rodriguez made his first moves as GM, firing most of Yallop&#x27;s remaining technical staff, including goalkeeping coach Aron Hyde, fitness coach Adrian Lamb and Director of Scouting Trevor James. Rodriguez also parted ways with the club&#x27;s long-time Director of First Team Operations Ron Stern, Equipment Manager Charles Raycroft and Assistant Equipment Manager Allan Araujo. On November 24, 2015, the club announced that Veljko Paunovic, former coach of the Serbian U-20 side that won the 2015 FIFA U-20 World Cup, had been named the new head coach of the Chicago Fire. On January 5, 2016, technical director Brian Bliss also departed the Fire to join Sporting Kansas City as Director of Player Personnel, completing the total overhaul of the technical staff.

On March 21, 2017 Manchester United allowed Bastian Schweinsteiger to join Chicago Fire, subject to a medical and a visa being secured. The move from Manchester United was completed on March 29, 2017.

On July 11, 2018, the club announced that Hauptman had sold a 49 percent stake of his ownership to Joe Mansueto, the founder of Morningstar, Inc. On September 13, 2019, Hauptman sold his majority share to Mansueto, who became the sole owner.

=== Return to Soldier Field and rebrand (2020–present) ===

As the 2019 MLS campaign concluded, the Chicago Fire organization began the ambitious process of reinventing the franchise during the course of a three-month offseason. The changes included securing a downtown Chicago venue, adding new front office positions, shifting organizational roles, making major roster changes, and rolling out a new brand identity.

Two days after the end of the season, October 8, the Fire officially announced they would return to Soldier Field to play the 2020 MLS season, that same day Bastian Schweinsteiger announced his retirement. Two days later, the Fire announced the signing of midfielder Álvaro Medrán, eight days later Designated Player and former Golden Boot winner Nemanja Nikolic announced he would be leaving the team.

The first full month of the off-season saw the Fire continue their overhaul. On November 4, the team traded captain Dax McCarty to expansion side Nashville SC. Ten days later Homegrown Player Grant Lillard was dealt to MLS&#x27;s other expansion team Inter Miami CF. That same day, November 14, Chicago Fire President and general manager Nelson Rodríguez fired head coach Veljko Paunovic and his staff. News that the Chicago Fire would not be renewing the contract of their last-remaining DP, Nicolas Gaitan, as well as winger Aleksandar Katai was overshadowed by an even larger organizational unveiling one week later.

On November 21, the long-anticipated rebrand of the Chicago Fire franchise was announced. Developed with the help of marketing agency Doubleday &amp; Cartwright, the team revealed changes to its franchise colors, red and white to red, blue, and gold, its name from Chicago Fire Soccer Club to Chicago Fire FC and, most contentiously, its logo.

While the Fire organization made their second player acquisition of the offseason in early December, homegrown player Nicholas Slonina, a relatively quiet few weeks had some followers of the team concerned about their organizational progress. However the Fire were busy again in late December with Nelson Rodríguez relinquishing his on-field decision making responsibilities to new Sporting Director Georg Hietz, who swiftly named former US Soccer Youth National Coach Raphael Wicky as head coach and Sebastian Pelzer as Technical Director. Heitz has previously worked with Wicky at Swiss club FC Basel and &quot;worked closely&quot; with Pelzer at his management consultancy business Heusler Werthmüller Heitz (&quot;HWH&quot;).

The Fire opened the 2020 campaign with the signings of Argentinian duo Ignacio Aliseda from Defensa and Gaston Gimenez from Vélez Sarsfield, looking to bolster their squad after losing DP Nicolas Gaitan The Fire also announced the signing of Robert Beric from French outfit Saint-Étienne, who netted in his debut defeat against the Seattle Sounders FC (2–1).

==Colors and badge==
The club&#x27;s official primary colors are red, flag blue, deep blue, and white. Secondary colors such as navy blue, sky blue, gold, and black have also been used throughout the history of the Fire. The original logo of the Chicago Fire, used from 1997 to 2019, was derived from the Cross of Saint Florian, a common symbol for fire departments in the United States. A stylized &quot;C&quot; sat in the center, representing the city, similar to the logos of the Bears and Cubs. The six points in a ring around the center alluded to the stars in the Flag of Chicago, one of which commemorates the Great Chicago Fire of 1871. This style was chosen by the original general manager, Peter Wilt, to establish a timeless image evocative of both classic American sports (as in the logos of the NHL Original Six) and the traditions of European soccer.

Nike, the Fire&#x27;s original equipment supplier, intended for the team to be named the Chicago Rhythm. The Rhythm identity featured a turquoise, black and green color scheme, and a logo adorned with a cobra. Team officials ignored Nike&#x27;s work, and privately developed the Fire identity with the help of Adrenalin, Inc., a sports branding agency from Denver. The names &quot;Chicago Blues&quot; and &quot;Chicago Wind&quot; were also considered.
The original Fire jerseys were chosen because of their resemblance to a Chicago fireman&#x27;s coat, featuring broad horizontal stripes across the torso and sleeves. In the first year, the home jersey was red and white with a silver &quot;FIRE&quot; on the stripe; while the away shirts were white and black in the same style. The jersey maintained the same format of an all-red shirt with a white horizontal chest stripe through changes in equipment sponsor (from Nike, to Puma, and currently Adidas), until 2012 when the white stripe was exchanged for a blue stripe. Conversely, the Fire&#x27;s secondary shirts have changed much over the years from white with black, to white with navy, to white with red, to all-white style and the all-blue currently used. Third shirts have often been yellow (originally to honor the Chicago Sting, later for the expired partnership with Morelia). In 2005, and again from 2014 through 2016, the club wore third shirts with designs based on the Flag of Chicago.

The club and their fans make frequent use of the symbols of Chicago, as a show of civic pride. Most prominent are the six-pointed Chicago stars, but the light blue color associated with the city, the municipal device, and the city skyline appear regularly on materials produced by the club and its fans. The Flag of Chicago is also favored by fans and often seen at the stadium.

On November 21, 2019, the club unveiled its first major rebranding ahead of their move back to Soldier Field in Chicago. The club&#x27;s name was changed to Chicago Fire Football Club (Chicago Fire FC) and the original logo was replaced with an ovular crest marked with mirrored sets of three triangles called the &quot;Fire Crown&quot; to reference the revitalization of Chicago following the Great Fire. The crest used dark blue, red, and gold as its main colors. Secondary design colors are to be ivory and &quot;flag blue&quot;, a light blue color derived from the Chicago flag. Before its unveiling, the rebranding was leaked onto social media and garnered an &quot;overwhelmingly negative response&quot; from fans. Comparisons were made between the &quot;Fire Crown&quot; and the existing logo of the Vancouver Whitecaps FC, which uses a similar set of mirrored triangles, and some fans worried that the &quot;Fire Crown&quot; was reminiscent of the logo of the Latin Kings street gang. The team responded to the decidedly negative reaction by saying &quot;[new] brands take time and repetition to build meaning. They will be judged in years, not days&quot;, insisting that there are no plans to revive the old logo. The club ultimately unveiled a new crest in the middle of the 2021 season, with a full embrace of it beginning in 2022. This new logo was designed by Matthew Wolff.

==Stadium==

Chicago played its home games at SeatGeek Stadium, a soccer-specific stadium located at 71st Street and Harlem Avenue in the Chicago suburb of Bridgeview, Illinois, about 12 miles southwest from downtown Chicago from 2006 until the end of the 2019 season. The Village of Bridgeview owns and operates SeatGeek Stadium, which opened as Toyota Park on June 11, 2006, and originally cost approximately $100 million. After the end of the 2018 season, It was renamed from Toyota Park to SeatGeek Stadium, with an estimated naming rights fee between $2.5 million to $4 million per year.

For its first years in the league the Fire played at Soldier Field, the 61,500-capacity home of the Chicago Bears of the NFL and one of the main venues of the 1994 FIFA World Cup. While that stadium was undergoing a $632 million renovation, the Fire played at Cardinal Stadium in Naperville, Illinois, on the outskirts of the Chicago metropolitan area; the stadium was temporarily expanded to 15,000 seats to accommodate the team. Attempts to play at other venues, including Comiskey Park and the Arlington Park racecourse, were rejected by their respective owners. They returned to Soldier Field toward the end of 2003, remaining there through the end of 2005 while their soccer-specific stadium was under construction.

In April 2019, multiple sources reported the club in negotiations with Bridgeview to buy out the remainder of its lease at SeatGeek Stadium and return to Soldier Field. In July 2019, Chicago Fire reached a deal to leave SeatGeek Stadium for a payment of $65.5 million and move back to Soldier Field starting in 2020. The return to Soldier Field was finalized with an agreement with the Chicago Park District in September 2019.

===New Chicago Stadium===
According to Crain’s Chicago, team owner Joe Mansueto and the Fire are looking to purchase a parcel of land for a new stadium at one of two developments in the city, with The 78 site in South Loop and the Lincoln Yards development between Lincoln Park and Bucktown the two likely finalists. Mansueto has indicated interest in building a soccer-specific stadium within city limits, and said the stadium would be privately financed, a departure from the Chicago Bears and Chicago White Sox seeking a variety of public subsidies for their stadiums.

==Club culture==

===Supporters===
There is a noteworthy fan culture for the Fire, beginning with the original Fire SG Barn Burners, existing from the date the club was founded, and building on an enthusiasm throughout Chicago sports. At matches, supporters and ultras groups occupy a standing area directly behind the north goal, in the &quot;Harlem End&quot; of Toyota Park. This area is referred to as &quot;Section 8&quot;, originating from the numbering of the corresponding section at Soldier Field and the American military designation of mentally unfit soldiers. Section 8 Chicago, the Independent Supporters&#x27; Association (ISA) for the Fire, oversees the activities of these numerous groups. While incorporating a worldwide variety of styles with a Chicago bent, groups as part of &quot;Section 8&quot; generally fall under the ultras designation. Additionally, an associated spinoff group called &quot;Sector Latino&quot; which originally congregated in the corner-kick Section 101 at the stadium&#x27;s southwest end until season long discussions between the ISA and the Chicago Fire Front Office eventually saw the group moved to Section 137, directly behind the south goal. There are also several other affiliated ultras and supporters groups, including The Arsonists, Banter Buddies, Blitzer Mob, Husaria, Fire Ultras 98, Partisans, Red Scare, Second City North, The Western Front, Ultras Red-Side, Mike Ditka Street Crew (MDSC), and Whiskey Brothers Aught-Five. The Section 8 Chicago ISA is a registered 501(c)7 non-profit organization run by volunteers through an elected board of directors.
Match atmosphere is known for organized displays of stadium-wide support, particularly for matches of prime competitive importance. Call-and-response cheering amongst the crowd is commonplace. Fans at SeatGeek Stadium for Fire matches periodically choreograph tifo presentations both to show their pride and inspire the players on the field. SeatGeek Stadium remains one of the few American environments to conduct such fan-driven presentations on a large scale.

===Mascot===
Their official mascot is Sparky, an anthropomorphic Dalmatian dog. Sparky is usually shown wearing the club&#x27;s jersey but also arrives wearing firefighter attire.

===Rivalries===
While the Fire have heated rivalries with a number of different MLS teams, Fire supporters of different ages will likely give different responses as to who the club&#x27;s main rival is. The earliest Fire supporters would list Brimstone Cup rival FC Dallas as the Fire&#x27;s nemesis, or Los Angeles Galaxy following heated playoff and cup matches with Dallas and L.A. in the league&#x27;s early years.

After the Fire moved to the Eastern Conference, meetings with Dallas and LA became less frequent. Rivalries with D.C. United and New England Revolution were stoked following several thrilling playoff meetings. The Fire and Revolution are MLS&#x27; most frequent playoff matchup, meeting in the MLS Cup Playoffs 8 different times in 10 seasons from 2000 to 2009, splitting those encounters 4–4, with the Fire winning in 2000, 2003, 2008, and 2009. New England ended the Fire&#x27;s playoff runs in 2002, 2005, 2006, and 2007. Newer rivals include Columbus Crew, who up until the introduction of FC Cincinnati were the closest MLS team geographically to the Fire, and Atlanta United FC following quarrels between the two sets of fans.

In 2023 St. Louis City SC entered the league. As St. Louis and Chicago are considered historic rival cities, a rivalry has naturally emerged between the two teams.

==Broadcasting==

Beginning with the 2020 season, WGN Sports was added as a regional television rightsholder under a multi-year deal, with all regional matches airing on WGN-TV. The first season under the contract was concurrent with the final year of the existing ESPN+ regional rights. WGN had recently lost its legacy professional sports rights to NBC Sports Chicago and Marquee Sports Network. In April 2021, the club announced that their television broadcast team would consist of play-by-play commentator Tyler Terens, color analyst, Tony Meola. Play-by-play commentator Arlo White – whose Fire broadcast debut was postponed in 2020 because of the pandemic – was also expected to call several games. With every MLS game available on Apple TV via their rights deal in 2023, Chicago games will be broadcast almost exclusively on this service, with exceptions for certain national linear television broadcast partners.

Spanish-language radio station WRTO has aired Chicago Fire matches since 2017, replacing WEBG-HD2.

On April 26, 2023, the Fire announced a deal with Cumulus Media to carry Fire matches on English language radio, with matches to be broadcast on either WLS 890 am, or on the station&#x27;s website at wlsam.com. Max Thoma will provide play-by-play with former Fire player Dasan Robinson providing color commentary.

==Ring of Fire==
The &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; was established in 2003 by Chicago Fire Soccer Club and the Chicago Fire Alumni Association as permanent tribute to honor those who have made the club proud and successful over its history. Aside from the initial member Piotr Nowak, only &quot;Ring of Fire&quot; members can select new inductees, and no more than one can be selected any year. Names and numbers (if applicable) are prominently displayed inside SeatGeek Stadium.

There were no inductees in 2008, 2010, or 2011. In 2008, the members voted to honor two recently deceased fans (supporter leaders Dan Parry and Brandon Kitchens) but were overruled by the club chairman Andrew Hauptman. Parry and Kitchens were later made members of the Wall of Honor, a special recognition for Fire fans. In addition to Parry and Kitchens, the late Fire fans Euan McLean and Al Hack have been inducted into the Wall of Honor as of 2011. C.J. Brown was expected to be honored in 2011, but a new rule was established that inductees must have been away from the club for at least a calendar year. Brown, at the time an assistant head coach at Real Salt Lake, was officially inducted at the halftime ceremony during the home game vs. Real Salt Lake in Toyota Park on May 9, 2012.

On October 3, 2015, Ante Razov, the club&#x27;s all-time leading scorer, became the eighth individual to be inducted into the club&#x27;s Ring of Fire Hall of Fame. The ceremony took place on that day during the halftime of the regular season home match against New England Revolution. On February 10, 2024, former goalkeeper and current goalkeeping coach Zach Thornton was inducted into the Ring of Fire. The ceremony will be held on April 27 at Soldier Field during the match against Atlanta United.

<text>The Columbus Crew are an American professional soccer club based in Columbus, Ohio. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The team began play in 1996 as one of the 10 charter clubs of the league. The Crew are currently operated by an ownership group led by the Haslam family (also owners of the Cleveland Browns and Pilot Corporation) and former team physician Pete Edwards. The Haslam/Edwards group is the third ownership group in club history.

The franchise was founded in 1994. Its stadium is Lower.com Field, opened in 2021. From 1999 to 2021, the Crew played home games at Historic Crew Stadium (formerly Mapfre Stadium and Columbus Crew Stadium), the first soccer-specific stadium built for an MLS team, with a seating capacity of 19,968 as of the 2015 season. From 1996 to 1998, the Crew played its home games at Ohio Stadium on the campus of Ohio State University. In 2023, the team set club attendance records for both most cumulative attendance and most sellouts.

The Crew have won eight major trophies: the MLS Cup in 2008, 2020 and 2023; the Supporters&#x27; Shield in 2004, 2008, and 2009; the 2002 U.S. Open Cup; and the Leagues Cup in 2024. The Crew have qualified for the CONCACAF Champions Cup (or its predecessor, the CONCACAF Champions League) five times, reaching the quarter-finals on every occasion. In 2021, the club won their first continental trophy by winning the Campeones Cup, and in 2024, the Crew advanced to their first Champions&#x27; Cup final.

==History==
===The beginning (1994–1998)===

On June 15, 1994, Major League Soccer announced that Columbus, Ohio, would be home to one of the ten founding members of the new top flight North American professional soccer league. Columbus had promised construction of a soccer-specific stadium and had sold over 12,000 season ticket deposits. The team was tentatively named the Columbus Eclipse in its application to the league, as a solar eclipse had passed over the city after reaching the league&#x27;s 10,000-deposit minimum. Prior to the initial MLS season, a public contest was created to decide the name for the team. The name &quot;the Crew&quot;, was picked out of 2,500 entrants and 650 nickname suggestions. The winning individual linked it to Christopher Columbus, his voyages and the crew that accompanied him on his discoveries. However, by the time it was chosen as the official name of the team, it was detached from the famous explorer and instead pitched as representative of Midwestern hard work.

MLS investor Lamar Hunt, and his son Clark became the owners of both the Columbus Crew and Kansas City Wizards in 1996. The first players for the Crew were South African national team veteran Doctor Khumalo, by assignment, and Brian McBride. McBride was selected as the first overall pick in MLS&#x27;s first draft in 1996. Former U.S. National Team coach Timo Liekoski would be the team&#x27;s head coach for its first season.

The Crew played their first game on April 13, 1996, in front of a home crowd of 25,266 in Ohio Stadium against D.C. United and won 4–0. Columbus would struggle, however, winning only 5 of their next 21 games. After the 6–16 start, Tom Fitzgerald replaced head coach Liekoski. The Crew, under Fitzgerald, won 9 of their last 10 games to finish fourth in the Eastern Conference. They went on to lose in the conference playoff semi-finals.

The Black &amp; Gold finished 15–17 in both 1997 and 1998, which put them in third and fourth place, respectively, in the Eastern Conference. Each season ended with losses in the Conference Finals to D.C. United. In 1998, the Crew reached the U.S. Open Cup Final. However, the match was postponed due to a hurricane and was controversially relocated from Virginia Beach to Soldier Field in Chicago, the home of the Chicago Fire. The Fire would go on to win the match 2–1 after extra time. Stern John, in his first of two seasons with Columbus, was the 1998 scoring champion, amassing 26 goals and 5 assists.

===A new home (1999–2003)===
Columbus&#x27;s 1999 season began with the opening of Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium in the United States. Columbus won their first game in the stadium, 2–0, against New England Revolution in front of a sell-out crowd of 24,741. Columbus would finish in second place at 19–13, but would lose in the conference finals to D.C. United for the third straight season. The 1999 season was the last for Stern John who scored 52 goals in 65 games for the club. The team had the lowest goals against average in the Eastern Conference, and Mark Dougherty became the first goalkeeper in league history to record 50 wins, with a 4–2 win over the MetroStars on August 18, 1999, at Giants Stadium.

The Crew hosted the 2000 MLS All-Star Game, with Mike Clark, Brian McBride, and Dante Washington representing Columbus in the game. The aforementioned Dante Washington was acquired from the Dallas Burn to replace Stern John, but his 13 goals in 2000 was not enough to propel the Crew to the playoffs. For the first time, Columbus failed to reach the postseason. Columbus got off to a slow 1–3–2 start in 2001, which led to the replacement of coach Tom Fitzgerald. Fitzgerald, who had coached 161 of the Crew&#x27;s first 183 MLS matches over parts of six seasons between 1996 and 2001, was replaced by Greg Andrulis. Andrulis would lead the Black &amp; Gold to a 2nd-place finish in 2001 but the team was ousted from the playoffs in the league quarterfinals.

In 2002, Columbus would win the U.S. Open Cup for the first time in team history. They advanced to the finals by beating the Richmond Kickers, MetroStars, and Kansas City Wizards. In the final, they beat LA Galaxy, who had just won the MLS Cup earlier in the week. Freddy García scored the only goal and keeper Jon Busch posted the shutout in Columbus&#x27;s 1–0 win. It was the first championship in team history. The Crew finished 11–12–5 in the regular season and finished in a tie for first place. They lost in the league semi-finals to New England. Kyle Martino won rookie of the year in 2002, a first for the Crew. By winning the 2002 U.S. Open Cup, Columbus received a bid to play in the 2003 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. They advanced to the second round by beating Árabe Unido 4–2 on aggregate in the first round before losing to Monarcas Morelia, 6–2. McBride would play his final season with Columbus in 2003 before joining Fulham of the Premier League.

===Transitions (2004–2006)===
With the departure of Brian McBride, Columbus added Robin Fraser and Simon Elliott to the club. These additions proved to be vital as Fraser went on to win the Defender of the Year award in 2004. The Crew won the Supporters&#x27; Shield set a franchise record for points, 49, by going 12–5–13, thanks in part to an 18-game unbeaten streak (8–0–10) to end the season. Despite winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield for best record in the league, the club would be eliminated from the MLS Cup in the Eastern Conference semi-finals. In his last season for the Black &amp; Gold, Jeff Cunningham scored his 62nd goal, which tied him with McBride for the franchise record.

Over both of the next two seasons, Columbus battled injuries to several players and struggled to win many games. Despite winning the MLS Coach of the Year Award in 2004, Andrulis was replaced on an interim basis by Robert Warzycha midway through the 2005 season. After missing the playoffs in the 2005 season, the club would hire former L.A. Galaxy and UCLA head coach Sigi Schmid. Schmid had won an MLS Cup and U.S. Open Championship in his six seasons with Galaxy. Warzycha remained on staff under Schmid. In 2006, the Crew went on a 13-game winless streak (0–7–6) between June 10 and August 19. The season ended on a tragic note when team founder and owner Lamar Hunt died on December 14, 2006.

Around this time, Columbus Crew supporters began using the term &quot;Massive&quot; to describe the club and city, at first ironically, but then as a term of pride and endearment of the club that continuously fought the odds.

===The Barros Schelotto era (2007–2010)===

The 2007 season in Major League Soccer started with news that global icon David Beckham signed with the LA Galaxy. The Crew followed suit by signing Guillermo Barros Schelotto on April 19, 2007. Columbus also signed forward Alejandro Moreno to bolster its attack. Even with these new players, the Crew still missed the playoffs in 2007.

In 2008, the Crew won its first Eastern Conference title, and subsequently, its first MLS Cup. Led by Barros Schelotto, who scored seven goals and had 19 assists and won the MLS Most Valuable Player Award, the team also won its second Supporters&#x27; Shield. After going 17–7–6 in the regular season, the Black &amp; Gold won playoff games against Kansas City and Chicago Fire before beating the New York Red Bulls 3–1 in the final. Chad Marshall won MLS Defender of the Year award, and Sigi Schmid won Coach of the Year.

After the 2008 season, Sigi Schmid declined a contract offer from Columbus and became coach of Seattle Sounders FC. The Crew&#x27;s ownership believed that Schmid had been in contact with the Sounders despite being denied permission to talk to other teams during the season. It was also alleged that he shared confidential information with Seattle after his contract with the Crew had ended. Major League Soccer ruled that no tampering had occurred, but ordered Seattle to financially compensate the Crew. Columbus would then name former player and assistant coach Robert Warzycha head coach. In 2009, Barros Schelotto was rewarded with the honor of becoming the franchise&#x27;s first Designated Player. The club went 13–7–10 in the regular season, good enough for 49 points and their second consecutive Supporters&#x27; Shield. The Crew were eliminated by Real Salt Lake in the two-legged Eastern Conference semi-finals, 4–2 on aggregate. Chad Marshall won his second consecutive MLS Defender of the Year award.

Columbus started the 2010 season in the CONCACAF Champions League. They reached the quarterfinals but lost to Toluca in March. The club finished the season 14–8–8 but lost in the quarterfinals of the MLS Cup playoffs to the Colorado Rapids. The Crew lost 2–1 in the 2010 U.S. Open Cup Final at Qwest Field, home of the Seattle Sounders.

===Rebuilding and Warzycha&#x27;s final years (2011–2013)===
In May 2011, the Crew signed its first ever homegrown player, Aaron Horton. on June 28, a 10-man Columbus lost at home in the third round of the U.S. Open Cup to the Richmond Kickers of USL Pro, the first time in Columbus history that they were eliminated by a third division club. Columbus finished the regular season ninth in the league at 13–13–8, and lost in the wild card round of the playoffs to the Colorado Rapids. That loss marked the third consecutive season they were unable to advance past this stage.

The midst of the 2012 season was most notable for a tragedy that happened off the field, as rookie midfielder Kirk Urso passed away from arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy, an inherited heart disease caused by genetic defects of the parts of heart muscle. On the field, the club lost in the third round of the U.S. Open Cup to the Dayton Dutch Lions in USL Pro, and finished sixth in the Eastern Conference with 52 points and a 15–12–7 record. They would narrowly miss the playoffs.

On September 2, 2013, the Crew parted ways with Head Coach Robert Warzycha after an embarrassing home loss to the Seattle Sounders, combined with a highly frustrated fanbase. Brian Bliss, the Crew&#x27;s technical director, took over as interim head coach. This effectively ended his stay with the club since 1996, when he joined the club as a player.

===The Precourt era (2013–2018)===
On July 30, 2013, Anthony Precourt became the second investor-operator in the history of the club. Precourt upgraded portions of Crew Stadium, as well as evolving the team&#x27;s brand in a way that identified with the city of Columbus, all within his first 15 months with the club.

On November 6, 2013, Precourt announced that Gregg Berhalter would be the club&#x27;s new head coach. Berhalter also became the first sporting director in club history.

The 2014 season saw Columbus return to the postseason for the first time since 2011. Under Berhalter, the Crew finished the year 14–10–10, good enough for the third seed in the Eastern Conference of the MLS Cup Playoffs. The Crew had two of its players, center back Giancarlo González and left back Waylon Francis, participate in the 2014 FIFA World Cup, representing Costa Rica. González was praised for his performance, earning a spot on ESPN&#x27;s Best XI of the group stage. He was subsequently transferred out of Columbus for a $5 million fee. Berhalter was nominated for 2014 MLS Head Coach of the Year. Likewise, goalkeeper Steve Clark was nominated for 2014 Goalkeeper of the Year and Michael Parkhurst won the Individual Fair Play Award for the third time.

Off the field, the Black &amp; Gold announced sports industry veteran Andy Loughnane as its new President of Business Operations on August 16, 2014. The team set the all-time attendance record and sellout record for a single season at Crew Stadium. The combination of the club&#x27;s on-field success and off-field resurgence capped a successful full first year for Precourt and Berhalter.

On October 8, 2014, the Precourt ownership changed the name and logo of the club, changing the name from &quot;Columbus Crew&quot; to &quot;Columbus Crew SC&quot;.

The beginning of the 2015 season started in late 2014 with the return of Kei Kamara. Kamara proved to be beneficial as he scored 22 regular season goals and 4 playoff goals. Along with Kamara, Ethan Finlay and Waylon Francis received spots in the 2015 MLS All-Star Game versus English Premier League club Tottenham Hotspur. On September 26, 2015, Crew SC hosted their largest sellout crowd since 2008 with an announced attendance of 22,719. Crew SC came into the playoffs with a bye in the first round after securing second place in the Eastern Conference. Following the Eastern Conference semi-final and final match-ups, Crew SC played host to the Portland Timbers in the 2015 MLS Cup Final. This was the club&#x27;s second-ever MLS Cup Final appearance after the 2008 MLS Cup championship. The Crew were upset by the Portland Timbers at home following the 2–1 loss. All three goals were scored in the first half including the lone Crew SC goal scored by Kamara. Kamara was nominated for the Landon Donovan MLS MVP Award. Kamara was also nominated for and won the MLS WORKS Humanitarian of the Year Award. Wil Trapp was nominated for the MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award.

The 1,000th goal in club history was scored on August 12, 2017 by Justin Meram.

====Proposed relocation to Austin====
On October 17, 2017, Precourt announced intentions to relocate the franchise to Austin, Texas, if a downtown stadium could not be secured in Columbus. Following the news, fans and supporters of the club began a campaign and movement known as #SaveTheCrew. Many had been present in the city&#x27;s council building on behalf of the cause. Later in the month, it was revealed that Precourt had a clause in his purchase of the club that would allow him to relocate the franchise, but only to Austin.

On November 15, 2017, Precourt and MLS commissioner Don Garber met with Columbus mayor Andrew Ginther and civic and business leaders about the Crew&#x27;s future in Columbus. After the meeting, both sides issued press releases detailing the meeting. Per the delegation from Columbus, Precourt and MLS refused to take the relocation threat off the table. Per Precourt and MLS, Columbus leaders did not present any plan for a downtown stadium. On the issue, the mayor stated it was &quot;obvious that Don Garber nor PSV (Precourt Sports Ventures) had any commitment for the team to stay in Columbus&quot;.

In the annual state of the league conference, commissioner Garber addressed more on the potential move. He had stated the difficulties there has been present with the market over the years. Discussing in 2008, when the league began its initiative to end having ownership groups owning multiple franchises in the league, there was no success in finding a local ownership group in the market of Columbus, with an interested group wanting to purchase the team but with a very low value. It was then when the league&#x27;s executives hired a different company banker and expanded its search regionally where Anthony Precourt was involved. Garber stated that had Precourt not acquired the club, there was a possibility that Columbus would have ceased operations and ultimately folded. As to why the issues were not stated publicly, Don Garber stated that the league is a &quot;private business&quot; and what&#x27;s been happening has been seen in other major sport leagues in the country.

On March 5, 2018, Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine and Columbus city attorney Zach Klein filed a lawsuit against Precourt, citing a previously untested 1996 state law (the Modell Law) that prevents sports teams that benefited from public facilities or financial assistance from relocating to another city without a six-month notice and attempting to sell the team to a local ownership group. The bill was originally passed after the controversial relocation of the Cleveland Browns to Baltimore.

===Haslam era and two MLS Cups (2018–present)===
On October 12, 2018, the owner of the Cleveland Browns, Jimmy Haslam, released a statement stating he was in the process of buying the Crew, along with other local groups. MLS later released a statement stating their willingness to keep the Crew in Columbus, and that Precourt will get the rights to start a team in Austin if the deal goes through. As part of the deal, the lawsuit against Precourt was dismissed that day; the Modell Law remains untested as a result.

On January 1, 2019, control of the Crew franchise was officially transferred to the Haslam family and longtime team physician Dr. Pete Edwards, who took full ownership of the club after reaching a deal with Precourt Sports Ventures LLC. The new ownership group also quickly announced that they would be building a new stadium for the Crew in the Arena District of downtown Columbus.

The team then hired Tim Bezbatchenko as president from Toronto FC and Caleb Porter, previously with the Portland Timbers, as their new coach for the 2019 season, with previous head coach Gregg Berhalter having left to take the USMNT head coaching job. The 2019 season was a forgettable one as the Crew dealt with a myriad of injuries throughout the season, including a season ending ACL injury to Federico Higuaín.

Before the start of the 2020 MLS season, the Crew made two major signings, bringing in new designated player Lucas Zelarayán and midfielder Darlington Nagbe. The team started out the season well, winning their group in the MLS is Back Tournament before going out in the round of 16 and finishing in third place in the Eastern conference and fourth place overall. After making a run in the playoffs, the Crew won their second MLS Cup just two years into the Haslam era, defeating the Seattle Sounders 3–0 at Mapfre Stadium on December 12, 2020, in MLS Cup 2020.

Weeks into the 2021 season, the franchise announced they would now be known as Columbus SC, using &quot;Columbus Crew&quot; and &quot;The Crew&quot; in informal instances. The rebrand received strongly negative reception from supporters of the team. A statement by the Nordecke claimed that &quot;neither the Nordecke nor any Crew Supporters Group was involved at any time with the conception, development, or design of the rebrand. The Board was only shown the rebrand in the last few days, and it was presented to us as a completed product with no chance for input.&quot; The logo was further criticized as generic and harming the team&#x27;s identity. This was done despite promises of fan involvement by team president Tim Bezbatchenko, which led to him being labeled as a &quot;traitor&quot;. A petition was created on change.org to restore the team&#x27;s name. Other observers noted that the rebrand was part of a similar trend in MLS teams to emulate European naming conventions, and was compared to the rebranding of Chicago Fire FC two years earlier. On May 17, 2021, in response to the backlash surrounding the rebrand, the franchise announced that &quot;Columbus Crew&quot; would remain as their official name and that the new logo would be modified accordingly. In addition, the &quot;SC&quot; was dropped from the brand, with the team&#x27;s name being simply the &quot;Columbus Crew&quot; once again.

They recorded their first win at Lower.com Field on July 17, 2021.

Columbus fired Porter after the team failed to qualify for the 2022 MLS Cup Playoffs. In December 2022, they hired Wilfried Nancy from CF Montréal as Porter&#x27;s replacement. In Nancy&#x27;s first season, Columbus advanced through the playoffs, beating Atlanta United FC, Orlando City SC, and FC Cincinnati in a playoff edition of the Hell Is Real derby to reach MLS Cup 2023, played on December 9 at Lower.com Field. The Crew defeated holders Los Angeles FC by 2–1 to capture the third MLS Cup title in the club&#x27;s history.

The Columbus Crew played against Tigres UANL in the quarter-finals of the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup. The first leg took place at Lower.com Field and ended in a 1–1 draw. In the second leg in Mexico, Columbus advanced to the semi-finals after defeating Tigres 4–3 in a penalty shoot-out. This result marked the first time an American club eliminated a Mexican club away in the continental tournament. The Crew then defeated Monterrey in both legs of the semifinal, including a historic 3–1 victory away to mark the first MLS team win in Mexico in the tournament&#x27;s history to advance to their first continental final.

Columbus faced C.F. Pachuca in the final of the 2024 Champions Cup Tournament. This edition introduced a single-game final, replacing the previous home-and-away two-leg series. Pachuca, with a superior record in the tournament, hosted the match at Estadio Hidalgo which is situated at an altitude of 8,000 feet above sea level. The Crew lost 3–0 to Pachuca, with the high altitude and Pachuca&#x27;s strong performance cited as significant factors in the outcome. It was later revealed that several Columbus players were affected by an illness, with the team doctor suspecting food poisoning. Both the players and the head coach made similar insinuations.

== Colors and badge ==
The official colors of the Crew are black and gold. Columbus&#x27;s usual primary jersey is predominately bright yellow with black trim and has been nicknamed the &quot;banana kit&quot; or &quot;canary kit&quot; by fans. From 1996 until 1999, the Crew donned black as their primary uniform color, as the league required teams to have a dark uniform and a white uniform. in 2000, the Crew unveiled their first fully yellow jersey, but Columbus had to wait until 2004 to wear the yellow consistently at home, as league rules stated that a club could only wear their &quot;light&quot; jerseys four times at home.

The alternate uniform has historically been black. For the 2012 season, Columbus began shifting more towards a white uniform with yellow and black trim or stripes. Even so, the away uniforms are seldom worn by the Crew due to the strong favor shown to the traditional home uniform; and also due to the fact that the historically black jerseys compound the summer heat in the United States climate. For the 2015 season, the Crew returned to a black jersey for its alternate uniform. During the beginning of the 2016 season, Columbus maintained a black kit, and also unveiled a white kit with yellow, red, and periwinkle trim introduced as being inspired by the city of Columbus flag.

The club badge from 1996 to 2014 was unique amongst MLS teams in that it featured people, containing three silhouetted males wearing construction hats beneath a stylized &quot;Crew&quot; wordmark. The logo was intended to represent a crew of hard-working people, much like the hard-working, blue collar image the city of Columbus cultivates.

Citing a disconnect between what the crest stood for and the 21st-century identity of the city of Columbus, owner Anthony Precourt initiated a rebrand upon assuming ownership in 2013. Precourt said that Columbus was no longer a true blue collar town, and that the industrial/manufacturing motif was no longer representative. In fact, Columbus had grown into a 21st-century city and become much more &quot;dynamic and diverse&quot;.

On October 8, 2014, the Crew unveiled a new badge. The new circular-shaped badge features the club&#x27;s classic black and gold colors, a minimized original crest with &quot;96&quot; overlaid on top, and the black and gold checkerboard pattern predominantly seen on flags waving in the Nordecke. A great deal of symbolism was packed into the new badge. The horizontal stripes are representative of the ten original MLS franchises, and the shield is an homage to the club&#x27;s original badge with the 96 representing 1996 – the club&#x27;s first year in competition. The inset &quot;O&quot; in the badge mimics the same shape found in Ohio state flag, a nod to Columbus&#x27;s role as the state&#x27;s capital city. Finally, as a significant point of pride for the city of Columbus, &quot;Columbus&quot; was added to the new badge, along with &quot;SC&quot; to further define the brand more accurately as a soccer club.

With new ownership came a rebranding, and a new logo and name change was introduced in 2021, much to the dismay of supporters. On the new logo, the state of Ohio flag forms the overall shape of the shield, while a &quot;C&quot; that represents the Crew primarily, as well as the city Columbus dawns the interior of the badge, and a &quot;96&quot; in the bottom right corner that represents when the club began play as the first club in Major League Soccer.

The club&#x27;s nickname, the Crew, also evolved from its original meaning as a hard-working construction crew to a new, more relevant one as &quot;a tight-knit group of people who come together to share a passion for our club and the sport of soccer&quot;. The nickname, Crew, is now meant to symbolize a unique brand of family and friendship between the club, the fans and the communities who unite to embrace and celebrate the authenticity and heritage of the sport. With the rebrand, the club also identified three brand pillars: original, energetic, and authentically Columbus, in an effort to celebrate its history as a team of firsts – first club in Major League Soccer, first soccer-specific stadium, first major professional championship for Columbus – its youthful, passionate energy, as well as Columbus&#x27;s young, progressive culture.

;Uniform history: 

==Stadium==


On May 15, 1999, the Crew opened Columbus Crew Stadium, the first soccer-specific stadium in Major League Soccer, as the Crew beat the New England Revolution 2–0 before a sold-out crowd of 24,741. It has been the model stadium for the rest of the league, and one of the stadiums used by the United States national team in World Cup qualifying. In 2015, the naming rights for the stadium were purchased by Madrid-based insurance company Mapfre.

Previously, the Columbus Crew played their home games at the 102,000-capacity Ohio Stadium on the campus of the Ohio State University, home of the Ohio State Buckeyes college football team. They ended with a 33–20 record while playing there.

The team has also played U.S. Open Cup games at two other stadiums: two games in 2005 and 2016 at the Jesse Owens Memorial Stadium, also owned by the Ohio State University and home of the OSU soccer teams; and one in 2014 at the FirstEnergy Stadium–Cub Cadet Field on the campus of the University of Akron in Akron, Ohio.

As part of the new ownership proposal for the Crew unveiled in 2018, the club announced plans to build a new stadium in the Arena District of Downtown Columbus. The new stadium would cost $230 million and be located at the center of the Confluence Village neighborhood, a mixed-use development with residential and commercial buildings. It would seat 20,000 spectators and include 30 suites and 1,900 club seats. In 2020, a new authority took ownership of Mapfre Stadium, soon renamed Historic Crew Stadium, and its adjacent city sports park, with the team continuing to control that venue in terms of its use as a training facility. The training facility, the OhioHealth Performance Center, opened in June 2021. The new stadium had its groundbreaking ceremony in 2019 and was completed in mid-2021. On June 15, 2021, the new stadium was named Lower.com Field via a sponsorship deal with Columbus-based online real estate company Lower.com, and the Crew&#x27;s first game there was on July 3 against the New England Revolution.

==Revenue and profitability==
Having lost money in 2011, in 2012 the Crew identified three financial goals with the aim of achieving financial stability. First, the team wanted a different jersey sponsor, which it achieved when they reached a deal with Barbasol. Second, the team wanted to sell naming rights to Columbus Crew Stadium, hoping for $15 million over 10 years. Third, the Crew had announced in September 2011 that it aimed to increase season-ticket sales from its current levels (later revealed to be 4,000) to 10,000. By November 2012, Crew season tickets were at 6,000, and by August 2013, the Crew had surpassed 7,000 season ticket holders.

Under Precourt Sports Ventures, Anthony Precourt, and Andy Loughnane, the Crew&#x27;s goals have shifted from exclusively focusing on season ticket sales to selling out MAPFRE Stadium. In 2014, the club set all-time stadium attendance records for highest overall attendance and most sellouts in one season. Loughnane confirmed that the club was trending to increase its season ticket membership by 1,000 members per year and also stated his intent for the club to assimilate into the corporate community and fan culture, adding that he believes this transformation is happening rapidly. On March 3, 2015, the Crew announced that they had agreed to a multimillion-dollar stadium naming rights partnership with MAPFRE Insurance, a first for the stadium. In 2015, the Crew and EAS Sports Nutrition agreed to a naming rights deal for its training facilities. Merchandise sales grew double digits since the previous year, as did food and beverage sales. It was also announced that the club gained over 1,000 new season ticket members from the previous year.

===Sponsorship===
The team&#x27;s first shirt sponsor was Mars&#x27; Snickers chocolate bar, which signed a five-year deal worth $6 million that lasted from 1996 to 2000. After the deal ended, Columbus played without a shirt sponsor during the 2001 season. Pepsi then became the team&#x27;s sponsor from 2002 to 2004. Following a three-year gap with no sponsor, Glidden was announced as the new sponsor, with a three-year deal worth $1 million per year, from 2008 to 2010. In 2012, the Crew announced a new shirt sponsorship deal with Barbasol, a shaving cream brand based in Dublin, Ohio. The deal was worth $900,000 annually, and ran for five years. This was followed by a three-year deal with Acura, which was announced in February 2017 and was the largest annual commercial transaction in the club&#x27;s history, with a reported value of $1.8 million per year. On February 27, 2020, the Columbus Crew announced a multi-year deal with Nationwide, a Columbus-based insurance company. While the exact terms of the deal were not disclosed, the annual value was reported to be more than $3 million.

==Club culture==
===Supporters and &quot;Nordecke&quot;===

Before the 2008 season, the Columbus Crew front office demolished the north stands where the most ardent of Crew supporters stood, in order to build a stage that would provide additional revenue by facilitating concerts and other events. Prior to this, the team&#x27;s three supporters&#x27; groups (&quot;Crew Supporters Union&quot;, &quot;Hudson Street Hooligans&quot;, and &quot;La Turbina Amarilla&quot;) sat apart because of differences between the groups ranging from age to ethnicity. The building of the stage forced the groups to come together into the north corner of the stadium, forming one large block of vocal supporters. The three groups formed the &quot;Nordecke&quot; (), which is German for &quot;north corner&quot;, celebrating the city&#x27;s German heritage. In 2006 a large contingency of fans from the Nordecke began traveling together to support the Crew during their away campaigns. In late 2009/early 2010, the term &quot;NorOnTour&quot; grew popular on social networking, to describe the frequent fan traveling support.

===Mascot===
Columbus Crew&#x27;s first mascot was &quot;Crew Cat&quot;, who was the franchise&#x27;s mascot for almost 20 years. Columbus&#x27;s official mascot is &quot;S.C.&quot;, the son of &quot;Crew Cat&quot; that was introduced for the 2015 MLS season. As new ownership was employed in the 2019 season, the older &quot;Crew Cat&quot; returned and attends games alongside S.C.

===Rivalries===

The Crew has a rivalry with the Chicago Fire. Columbus is roughly a six-hour drive away from Chicago. Due to the relatively close proximity of the two cities, it is not uncommon for supporters of both teams to make the trip to support their club in matches between the two. In the 2008 season, Columbus defeated Chicago in the Eastern Conference Championship match. In 1998, Chicago defeated Columbus for the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup.

The Crew also plays for two rivalry cups during the regular season. One of the series is with Toronto FC for the Trillium Cup, due to the close proximity of the cities. The Crew also contests FC Dallas for the Lamar Hunt Pioneer Cup. This trophy was created due to Lamar Hunt being the owner of both teams until his death.

As a lower-division club, FC Cincinnati supporters claimed the Crew as a rival, although some Columbus supporters initially did not consider the former USL team a rival. The two sides first met in a 2017 Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup match in front of 30,000 spectators, the largest non-final crowd for an Open Cup fixture. The match ended in a 1–0 win for FC Cincinnati As Cincinnati moved to the league, the rivalry became solidified in league lore; this derby is known as the Hell is Real Derby, based on a Christian billboard along I-71 between Columbus and Cincinnati.

<text>Jan Žižka z Trocnova a Kalicha (; 1360 – 11 October 1424) was a Czech military leader and Knight who was a contemporary and follower of Jan Hus, and a prominent Radical Hussite who led the Taborite faction during the Hussite Wars. Renowned for his exceptional military skill, Žižka is celebrated as a Czech national hero. Žižka led the Hussite forces in battles against three crusades and remained undefeated throughout his military career.

Žižka was born in the village of Trocnov, located in the Kingdom of Bohemia, into a family of lower Czech nobility. According to Piccolomini&#x27;s &quot;Historia Bohemica&quot;, he maintained connections within the royal court during his youth and later held the office of Chamberlain to Queen Sofia of Bavaria. He fought in the Battle of Grunwald (15 July 1410), where he defended Radzyń against the Teutonic Order. Later, he played a prominent role in the civil wars in Bohemia. He led the Hussites during the first important clashes of the conflict in the Battle of Sudoměř (1420) and in the Battle of Vítkov Hill (1420). In the Battle of Kutná Hora (1421) he defeated the army of the Holy Roman Empire and the Hungarian Kingdom. The effectiveness of his field artillery against the royal cavalry in this battle made it a successful element of Hussite armies.

Žižka&#x27;s tactics were unorthodox and innovative. In addition to training and equipping his army according to their abilities, he used armored wagons fitted with small cannons and muskets, anticipating the tank of five hundred years later. He exploited geographic features to the full and maintained good discipline in his armies. He had to train peasants quickly to face highly-trained and -armored opponents repeatedly, who usually outnumbered his own troops. For those reasons, he is often regarded as one of the greatest military commanders of all time.

A monument was erected on the Vítkov Hill in Prague to honor Jan Žižka and his victory on this hill in 1420. It is the third-largest bronze equestrian statue in the world.

==Early life==
Jan Žižka was born in one of two Meierhofs of the village Trocnov (nowadays part of Borovany). An old legend says that he was born in the forest under an oak growing just next to the fields and little ponds belonging to the Meierhof. Žižka&#x27;s family belonged to the lower Czech gentry (&quot;&quot;) but did not own much estate. Little is known of the rest of the family. Jan Žižka had several siblings but the only names known to historians are brother Jaroslav and sister Anežka. The family had a crayfish in their coat of arms.

The date of Žižka&#x27;s birth is not known. A document dated 3 April 1378 mentions &quot;&quot; (Jan called Zizka of Trocnov) as a witness on a marriage contract. On the basis of this document, it is assumed that Žižka must have been of legal age at this time and was born around 1360. Nevertheless, there is no direct evidence whether Jan Žižka listed on this document was identical with the Hussite general. For example, Czech historian Tomek and his followers supposed it could have been the military leader&#x27;s father. They argued that if Žižka were adult in 1378, he would be too old to become such an able commander after 1419. Others, such as Šmahel, admitted that even such an age might not have prevented him from successful leadership. Furthermore, historian Petr Čornej notes that &quot;Žižka&quot; was not a family name but a specific nickname that is not attested in any other member of Žižka&#x27;s family.

In the years 1378–1384, Žižka&#x27;s name appears on several property documents, which indicate that he was struggling with long-term financial problems. In 1381, Žižka is attested in Prague, in connection with the settlement of the inheritance on the Trocnov estate. It is unclear how to connect this stay with Piccolomini&#x27;s later report that young Žížka received an education at the Prague royal court. A 1384 document also mentions some Kateřina, a wife of Johannes dictus Zizka. This document states that Žižka sold the field he had once acquired from Kateřina as a dowry. After this date, Žižka&#x27;s name disappears from historical documents for 20 years and it is generally assumed that he became a mercenary soldier.

==Žižka as an outlaw==
Although some of the south Bohemian nobility led by Henry III of Rosenberg took part in various revolts against king Wenceslaus IV of Bohemia at the turn of the 14th and 15th century (the king was even held captive in the Rosenberg castles of Příběnice and Český Krumlov for a short time), there is no evidence of Žižka&#x27;s participation in these conflicts. It is supposed that in the early years of the 15th century Jan Žižka already controlled his family property. However, the family probably got into financial problems and started selling parts of their estate. Some sources suggest that Žižka&#x27;s father took the place of the royal gamekeeper before he died in 1407 near Plzeň and Žižka himself might have been taken into the royal service, too, but the evidence is not clear enough.

However, beginning in 1406, Žižka starts appearing in the black book (&quot;&quot;) of the Rosenberg estate as an accused bandit. Unfortunately the reasons of this charge are not known, but the fact that he declared open hostility to Henry of Rosenberg and also to the city of Budějovice and their allies suggests that he was trying to fight some injustice against his house and to enforce some of his rights in this way. Šmahel assigns the boom of south-Bohemian banditry in that time to the continual growth of the estates of the rich house of Rosenberg (and of the church estates) and simultaneous indebtedness and pauperization of the lower gentry together with the thirst for land among their subjects, which resulted in social tension in the area. These circumstances may have eventually forced Žižka to leave his residence in Trocnov. Historian Tomek also speculated that he might have been forcibly deprived of his small hereditary property, which was not uncommon in that time. As a result, he started leading the life of an outlaw, partly supported by the local nobleman Valkoun.

In any case, violence broke out and Žižka tried to harm his enemies on any possible occasion using as his allies, also local bandits, led by Matěj Vůdce (Matthew the Leader) who were seeking only financial profit. The group camped in various places, including a farm in the village of Sedlo (nowadays part of Číměř), a mill not far from Lomnice nad Lužnicí, at a house of an unknown woman in Hlavatce or simply in the woods. During that period, robbery, holding people for ransom, and attacking small towns were the main source of the group&#x27;s income. They used it to pay their living expenses (including paying temporary hosts) and to pay spies. Žižka took part in these raids and at least one murder: a man belonging to the cohort of Henry of Rosenberg. Žižka and the bandits were also in touch with some more powerful enemies of Henry of Rosenberg. For example, in 1408 Žižka took part in preparations for conquering the castle Hus near Prachatice (whose burgrave was Mikuláš of Hus who later became one of first commandants in Žižka&#x27;s army in the beginning of the Hussite Wars). He also negotiated with Aleš of Bítov to secure Jan&#x27;s help attempting to conquer the towns of Nové Hrady and Třeboň. Another nobleman asking Jan&#x27;s help was Erhart of Kunštát who wanted to capture the stronghold of Slověnice.

Some of Žižka&#x27;s companions were eventually captured, tortured, and executed, including Matěj Vůdce. Žižka&#x27;s situation changed on 25 of April 1409 when king Wenceslas agreed that his conflict with the city of Budějovice should be finished and on 27 June he pardoned him (calling him &quot;faithful and beloved&quot;) by a special letter. At the same time he ordered the city council of Budějovice to do so too. This suggests that the king admitted that Žižka was at least partly justified in the conflict.

==Grunwald (1410)==
According to the Polish chronicler Jan Długosz, in the following year (1410) Žižka served as a mercenary during the Polish–Lithuanian–Teutonic War. It is assumed that he was on the winning Polish-Lithuanian side of the Battle of Grunwald, also called the 1st Battle of Tannenberg, one of the largest battles in Medieval Europe. It was fought on 15 July 1410, and the alliance of the Kingdom of Poland and the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, led respectively by King of Poland Jogaila (Władysław II Jagiełło) and Grand Duke Vytautas (Witold), decisively defeated the Teutonic Knights, led by Grand Master Ulrich von Jungingen. Długosz reports that after the battle, Žižka was serving in the garrison of the town of Radzyń.

==A stay in Prague==
The place of Žižka&#x27;s activity in the years 1411–1419 is not entirely certain. According to a later report by Lukáš Pražský (from 1527), Žižka entered the service of Sophia of Bavaria, the wife of Wenceslas IV, as her chamberlain, and he accompanied her when she was attending the preachings of Jan Hus. Given that Hus went to the South Bohemian exile in 1413, this report must relate to the years 1411–1412. According to the Hussite historian Vavřinec z Březové (Vavřinec of Březová), who knew Žižka personally and referred to the events of 1419, the future Hussite leader then served as a &quot;familiaris regis Bohemiae&quot; (literally &quot;a family member of the Bohemian king&quot;, i.e. a king&#x27;s courtier). This is confirmed by later chronicles from the 16th century, which specifically highlight the exceptional position that Žižka had among the servants of Wenceslas IV. It is possible that Žižka took part in the unsuccessful war of the Polish king against the Teutonic Knights in 1414, but concrete evidence is lacking. However, it is interesting that just one month after the end of this war campaign, on 7 November 1414, a house in Na Příkopě street in Prague was bought by the one-eyed royal &quot;doorman&quot; Janek &quot;(Janek portulanus regius)&quot;. Czech historiography generally accepts that this &quot;doorman&quot; was identical with Žižka. On 27 May 1416, the &quot;doorman&quot; Janek sold this house and buys another, smaller one in the Old Town.

==Rise to prominence==

Jan Žižka made his first significant mark in history on 30 July 1419 in Prague, when he joined a Hussite procession led by the priest Jan Želivský. The crowd gathered in front of the New Town hall and demanded the release of several Hussites held in prison. When these demands were rejected by the councilors, the crowd stormed the town hall and threw the councilors out of the windows. This so-called First Defenestration of Prague is regarded as the beginning of the Hussite revolution. Wenceslaus IV died 17 days after hearing about these events, likely from a heart attack. The Hussites subsequently seized the city and expelled all their opponents.

On 13 November 1419 a temporary armistice was concluded between the partisans of King Sigismund, the last Emperor of the House of Luxemburg and the citizens of Prague. Žižka disapproved of this compromise and left Prague for Plzeň, one of the richest cities of the kingdom, with his followers, but soon left that city. On 25 March 1420 he defeated the partisans of Sigismund at Sudoměř, the first pitched battle of the Hussite wars. He later arrived at Tábor, the then-recently established stronghold of the Hussite movement. The ecclesiastical organization of Tabor had a somewhat puritanical character with a very strict military discipline being instituted though the government was established on a thoroughly democratic basis. Žižka took a large part in the organization of the new military community and became one of the four captains of the people (&quot;hejtman&quot;) who were at its head.

===Wagenburg tactics===
Žižka helped develop tactics of using wagon forts, called &quot;vozová hradba&quot; in Czech or &quot;Wagenburg&quot; by the Germans, as mobile fortifications. When the Hussite army faced a numerically superior opponent they prepared carts for the battle by forming them into squares or circles. The carts were joined wheel to wheel by chains and positioned aslant, with their corners attached to each other, so that horses could be harnessed to them quickly, if necessary. In front of this wall of carts a ditch was dug by camp followers. The crew of each cart consisted of 16–22 soldiers: 4–8 crossbowmen, 2 handgunners, 6–8 soldiers equipped with pikes or flails (the flail was the Hussite &quot;national weapon&quot;), 2 shield carriers and 2 drivers.

The Hussites&#x27; battle consisted of two stages, the first defensive, the second an offensive counterattack. In the first stage the army placed the carts near the enemy army and by means of artillery fire provoked the enemy into battle. The artillery would usually inflict heavy casualties at close range.

In order to avoid more losses, the enemy knights finally attacked. Then the infantry hidden behind the carts used firearms and crossbows to ward off the attack, weakening the enemy. The shooters aimed first at the horses, depriving the cavalry of its main advantage. Many of the knights died as their horses were shot and they fell.

As soon as the enemy&#x27;s morale was lowered, the second stage, an offensive counterattack, began. The infantry and the cavalry burst out from behind the carts, striking violently at the enemy, mostly from the flanks. While fighting on the flanks and being shelled from the carts the enemy was not able to put up much resistance. They were forced to withdraw, leaving behind dismounted knights in heavy armor who were unable to escape the battlefield. The enemy armies suffered heavy losses and the Hussites soon had the reputation of not taking captives.

===Gunpowder weapons===
The Hussite wars also marked the earliest successful use of pistols on the battlefield and Žižka was an innovator in the use of gunpowder. He was the first European commander to maneuver on the field with cannon of medium caliber mounted on carts in between the wagons. The Czechs called the handgun a &quot;píšťala&quot;, and anti-infantry field guns &quot;houfnice&quot;, from which the English words &quot;pistol&quot; and &quot;howitzer&quot; have been derived. The Germans had just started corning gunpowder, making it suitable for use in smaller, tactical weapons. A handgunner on an open field armed with only a single-shot weapon and without a bayonette was no match for a charging knight on a horse; however, from behind a castle wall, or from within the enclosure of the wagenburg, massed and disciplined gunmen could use the handgun to its greatest potential. From his experiences at the Battle of Grunwald, Žižka knew exactly how his enemies would attack, and he found new ways to defeat forces numerically superior to his own.

==Hussite Crusades==
The Hussite Wars were fought to win recognition of faith of the Hussites, the forerunners of the Protestant Reformation, and though predominantly a religious movement, it was also propelled by social issues and strengthened Czech national awareness. The Catholic Church deemed Hus&#x27;s teachings heretical. He was excommunicated in 1411, condemned by the Council of Constance, and burned at the stake in 1415. The wars proper began in July 1419, with the First Defenestration of Prague, when protesting Hussites threw the town councillors and the judge out the windows of the New Town Hall. It has been reputed that King Wenceslaus IV was so stunned by the defenestration that he died from the shock shortly afterward on 16 August 1419. This led to the armed conflict in which Žižka was to earn his fame.

===The first anti-Hussite crusade===
King Sigismund was king of Hungary but only the titular king of Bohemia. Sigismund had acquired a claim on the Bohemian crown, though it was then in question (and remained so until much later) whether Bohemia was a hereditary or an elective monarchy, especially as the line through which Sigismund claimed the throne had accepted that the Kingdom of Bohemia was an elective monarchy elected by the nobles, and thus the regent of the kingdom (Čeněk of Wartenberg) also explicitly stated that Sigismund had not been elected as reason for Sigismund&#x27;s claim to not be accepted. A firm adherent of the Church of Rome, Sigismund was successful in obtaining aid from Pope Martin V, who issued a bull on 17 March 1420 which proclaimed a crusade &quot;for the destruction of the John Wycliffe, Hussites and all other heretics in Bohemia&quot;. Sigismund and many German princes arrived before the walls of Prague on 30 June at the head of a vast army of crusaders from all parts of Europe, largely consisting of adventurers attracted by the possibility of pillage. They immediately began a siege of the city and Žižka was compelled to defend the Kingdom. He was a pragmatist in developing his military strategy. His army consisted of farmers and peasants, lacking both the funds and equipment to be classic soldiers with sword, horse and armor, so Žižka used their farmers&#x27; skills to boost their military efficiency. He adapted tools of agriculture into tools of war. The agricultural flail was transformed into the flail.

Menaced by Sigismund, the citizens of Prague entreated the Taborites for assistance. Led by Žižka and their other captains, the Taborites set out to take part in the defence of the capital. At Prague, Žižka and his men took up a strong position on the hill just outside the city known as the Vítkov, now in Žižkov, a district of Prague named after the battle in his honour. On 14 July the armies of Sigismund made a general attack. A strong German Crusader-led force assaulted the position on the Vítkov, the stronghold that secured the Hussite communications with the open country. Thanks to Žižka&#x27;s personal leadership, the attack was thrown back and the forces of Sigismund abandoned the siege. On August 22 the Taborites left Prague and returned to Tábor. Though Sigismund had retired from Prague, the castles of Vyšehrad and Hradčany remained in possession of his troops. The citizens of Prague laid siege to the Vyšehrad (see Battle of Vyšehrad), and towards the end of October the garrison was on the point of capitulating through famine. Sigismund attempted to relieve the fortress, but was decisively defeated by the Hussites on November 1 near the village of Pankrác. The castles of Vyšehrad and Hradčany now capitulated, and shortly afterwards almost all Bohemia fell into the hands of the Hussites.

Žižka now engaged in constant warfare with the partisans of Sigismund, particularly with the powerful Romanist, Oldřich II of Rožmberk. Through this struggle, the Hussites obtained possession of the greater part of Bohemia from Sigismund. It was proposed to elect the Grand Duke of Lithuania Vytautas to the throne. However, the estates of Bohemia and Moravia met at Čáslav on 1 June 1421 and decided to appoint a provisional government, consisting of twenty members chosen from all the political and religious parties of the country. Žižka, who took part in the deliberations at Čáslav, was elected as one of the two representatives of Tábor.

Žižka summarily suppressed some disturbances on the part of a fanatical sect called the Adamites. He then continued his campaigns against the Romanists and the adherents of Sigismund, and having captured and rebuilt a small castle near Litoměřice (Leitmeritz), he retained possession of it, the only reward for his great services that he ever received or claimed. According to the Hussite custom he gave the Biblical name of &quot;Chalice&quot; (Kalich in Czech) to this new possession, and henceforth adopted the signature of &quot;Žižka of the Chalice&quot;. Jan Žižka did not capture any more properties for himself during the Hussite Wars. This fact was unusual for the time and distinguished Žižka from his contemporaries.

Later that year he was severely wounded while besieging the Rabí Castle, and lost the use of his remaining eye. Though now totally blind, he continued to command the armies of Tábor.

===The second anti-Hussite crusade===
At the end of 1421, Sigismund again attempted to subdue Bohemia and gained possession of the important town of Kutná Hora. The mainly German citizens of the city killed a few of the Hussites in the town and closed the city to Žižka, whose armies were camped outside the city walls. Sigismund&#x27;s armies arrived and surrounded the Hussites. Žižka was at the head of the united armies of Tábor and Prague and though trapped managed to execute what some historians call the first mobile artillery manoeuver in history. Žižka broke through the enemy lines and retreated to Kolín, but having received reinforcements he attacked and defeated Sigismund&#x27;s unsuspecting army at the village of Nebovidy between Kolín and Kutná Hora on 6 January 1422. Sigismund lost 12,000 men and only escaped himself by rapid flight. Sigismund&#x27;s forces made a last stand at Battle of Německý Brod on 10 January, but the city was stormed by the Czechs, and contrary to Žižka&#x27;s orders, its defenders were put to the sword.

==Civil war==

Early in 1423, internal dissent among the Hussites led to civil war. Žižka, as leader of the Taborites, defeated the men of Prague and the Utraquist nobles at Hořice on 20 April. Shortly afterwards came news that a new crusade against Bohemia was being prepared. This induced the Hussites to conclude an armistice at Konopiště on 24 June. As soon as the crusaders had dispersed, internal dissent broke out anew. During his temporary rule over Bohemia, Prince Sigismund Korybut of Lithuania had appointed Bořek, the lord of Miletínek, governor of the city of Hradec Králové. Bořek belonged to a moderate Hussite faction, the Utraquist party. After the departure of Sigismund Korybut, the city of Hradec Králové refused to recognize Bořek as its ruler, due to the democratic party gaining the upper hand. They called Žižka to its aid. He acceded to the demand and defeated the Utraquists under Bořek at the farm of Strachov (in the area of today&#x27;s Kukleny within Hradec Králové) on 4 August 1423.

Žižka now attempted to invade Hungary, which was under the rule of his old enemy King Sigismund. Though this Hungarian campaign was unsuccessful owing to the great superiority of the Hungarians, it ranks among the greatest military exploits of Žižka, on account of the skill he displayed in retreat. In 1424, civil war having again broken out in Bohemia, Žižka decisively defeated the &quot;Praguers&quot; and Utraquist nobles at the battle of Skalice on 6 January, and at the battle of Malešov on 7 June. In September, he marched on Prague. On the 14th of that month, peace was concluded between the Hussite parties through the influence of John of Rokycany, afterwards Utraquist archbishop of Prague. It was agreed that the now reunited Hussites should attack Moravia, part of which was still held by Sigismund&#x27;s partisans, and that Žižka should be the leader in this campaign.

However, Žižka died on the Moravian frontier near Přibyslav, during the siege of the castle in Přibyslav in what is today Žižkovo Pole, on 11 October 1424. Traditionally, it was said that he died of the plague; however, modern knowledge of historians excludes this theory. Even the theory of arsenic poisoning was ruled out after examining the skeletal remains. According to historians, the purulent disease carbuncle is considered the most likely cause of death.

According to chronicler Piccolomini, Žižka&#x27;s dying wish was to have his skin used to make drums so that he might continue to lead his troops even after death. Žižka was so highly regarded that when he died, his soldiers called themselves &quot;Sirotci&quot; (&quot;the Orphans&quot;) because they felt as if they had lost their father. His enemies said that &quot;The one whom no mortal hand could destroy was extinguished by the finger of God.&quot;

He was interred in the church of Saints Peter &amp; Paul in Caslau, but in 1623 his remains were removed and his grave destroyed by order of the Emperor Ferdinand II.

He was succeeded by Prokop the Great.

<text>Miami Fusion F.C. was an American professional soccer club based in the Miami metropolitan area. The club competed in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The team played from 1998 to 2001. Announced in 1997 as one of the league&#x27;s first two expansion teams, their best season was 2001, when they won the Supporters&#x27; Shield with the best regular season finish. In 2002, after four years of lackluster ticket sales and revenues, MLS contracted the Fusion along with its other Florida-based team, the Tampa Bay Mutiny. The Fusion played their home games at Lockhart Stadium.

==History==

===Early history===
Major League Soccer announced a South Florida team in 1998 as one of its first two expansions, along with the Chicago Fire. Miami businessman Ken Horowitz served as owner, the first new investor to join Major League Soccer since its founding in 1995. The team&#x27;s name, the Miami Fusion, was announced on July 8, 1997, at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel in New York City ahead of the MLS All-Star Game. The Fusion debuted in the 1998 MLS season, playing in the renovated Lockhart Stadium, considered a forerunner to the league&#x27;s later soccer-specific stadiums.

The Fusion started their inaugural season strong. Led by star midfielder Carter Stephens, the Fusion drew 20,450 to their first game at Lockhart Stadium against D.C. United, showing off the possibilities of a more intimate venue designed especially for soccer. Another 3,000 were turned away by police. However, interest waned through the year along with the team&#x27;s middling performance on the field. The Fusion replaced head coach Carlos &quot;Cacho&quot; Cordoba with Ivo Wortmann after game 19, and the team managed a playoff spot, losing to D.C. By the end of the year their average attendance had dropped to 10,284.

The Fusion continued to struggle both on and off the field for the next two years. After years of disagreement, the commissioner &quot;reassigned&quot; Carlos Valderrama back to Tampa Bay in 1999, and the team replaced head coach Ivo Wortmann with Ray Hudson mid-season in 2000. The team made a dramatic improvement in the 2001 season, winning the Supporters&#x27; Shield with the best regular season performance, taking the Eastern Conference, and advancing to the league semifinals. Attendance improved as well, but remained fourth worst in the league with an average of 11,177. In the front office, owner Ken Horowitz struggled with finances. He, along with Robert Kraft of the New England Revolution and Stuart Subotnick of the New York/New Jersey MetroStars, formed a faction among MLS owners who wanted to keep spending down, as opposed to Lamar Hunt and Philip Anschutz who wished to invest in long-term development. Despite the team&#x27;s improvements, by the end of the 2001 season they had the league&#x27;s lowest season ticket sales and the lowest revenues from sponsors.

===Demise===
Major League Soccer had reportedly lost an estimated $250 million during its first five years.
The league&#x27;s poor financial condition forced MLS to stop the bleeding. During the winter break between the 2000 and 2001 seasons, reports began circulating that MLS was considering trimming the league from 12 teams back to 10 teams. The team considered several measures to improve attendance and popularity, including changing their name to the South Florida Fusion to advertise to a wider geographical area. Rumors began circulating that the league might pull the plug on the Fusion, even though the Fusion had a low-cost stadium lease, and an improved performance in 2001 with increased fan attendance.

MLS announced in January 2002 that it had decided to contract the two Florida franchises, the Fusion and the Tampa Bay Mutiny. Both teams were withdrawn from the league, ceased operations and folded. Major League Soccer&#x27;s contraction reduced the league from 12 to 10 teams. The league had chosen to fold the Miami Fusion, in part because the Fusion&#x27;s ownership reportedly lacked financial resources, had been trying to run the Fusion on a bare-minimum budget, and had asked the league to pay some of the club&#x27;s expenses. Commissioner Garber stated that the Fusion had the lowest revenue in the league, due to fewer season tickets and almost no revenue from corporate sponsorships.

Miami ownership had reportedly experienced $15 million in operating losses since Miami joined the league. The Fusion&#x27;s owner, Ken Horowitz, described several difficulties with operating an MLS soccer franchise in South Florida. Many Miami residents were not originally from the area and didn&#x27;t identify with and support local sports teams. Additionally, the MLS season is in the summer, which is different from the youth soccer season, making it difficult to draw youth soccer teams to attend Fusion matches. There were also issues with local summertime heat and rain. Finally, Horowitz identified a lack of corporate support for the team.

On April 2, 2015, a new club with the name Miami Fusion FC joined the fourth-tier National Premier Soccer League. The club folded in 2018.

MLS returned to the South Florida area in 2018, when Inter Miami CF was announced. On January 29, 2018, the Miami Beckham United group, four years after the ownership&#x27;s original announcement of pursuing a team, was awarded the twenty-fifth MLS franchise and launched in the 2020 season, playing on the site of Lockhart Stadium at the new Chase Stadium from 2020 to 2025 until Miami Freedom Park was built within Miami city limits. Former Fusion coach Ray Hudson would go on to work as a color commentator for Inter Miami, while former Fusion player Chris Henderson is the club&#x27;s current Sporting Director. 

==Stadium==
The Fusion played their home games at Fort Lauderdale&#x27;s Lockhart Stadium. They had originally intended to play at the Miami Orange Bowl in downtown Miami, but could not reach an agreement with the city of Miami, as the city wanted a 10-year lease and a prohibition on the team relocating to another South Florida stadium. Subsequently, the Fusion reached an agreement with the Broward County School Board and the city of Fort Lauderdale to use Lockhart Stadium.

Originally constructed as a high school football and track stadium in 1959, Lockhart had hosted the Fort Lauderdale Strikers of the original North American Soccer League from 1977 to 1983, as well as other soccer games. Fusion owner Ken Horowitz spearheaded a $5 million renovation that converted Lockhart into a 20,000-seat soccer-specific stadium. The new stadium was the first of its kind in Major League Soccer; at the time all other teams played in much larger football stadiums. This innovation set a trend for similar facilities throughout the league that continues today.

The stadium site was redeveloped in 2019 and 2020 with the construction of DRV PNK Stadium for Major League Soccer club Inter Miami CF.

<doc id="245702" wikidata="Q213938" url="?curid=245702" title="Amanita">
<text>The genus Amanita contains about 600 species of agarics, including some of the most toxic known mushrooms found worldwide, as well as some well-regarded edible species (and many species of unknown edibility). The genus is responsible for approximately 95% of fatalities resulting from mushroom poisoning, with the death cap accounting for about 50% on its own. The most potent toxin present in these mushrooms is .

The genus also contains many edible mushrooms, but mycologists discourage mushroom hunters, other than experts, from selecting any of these for human consumption. Nonetheless, in some cultures, the larger local edible species of &quot;Amanita&quot; are mainstays of the markets in the local growing season. Samples of this are &quot;Amanita zambiana&quot; and other fleshy species in central Africa, &quot;A. basii&quot; and similar species in Mexico, &quot;A. caesarea&quot; and the &quot;Blusher&quot; &quot;A. rubescens&quot; in Europe, and &quot;A. chepangiana&quot; in Southeast Asia. Other species are used for colouring sauces, such as the red &quot;A. jacksonii&quot;, with a range from eastern Canada to eastern Mexico.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Amanita&quot; was first published with its current meaning by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1797. Under the &quot;International Code of Botanical Nomenclature&quot;, Persoon&#x27;s concept of &quot;Amanita&quot;, with &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; (L.) Pers. as the type species, has been officially conserved against the older &quot;Amanita&quot; Boehm (1760), which is considered a synonym of &quot;Agaricus&quot; L.

=== Etymology ===
The name is possibly derived from Amanus (), a mountain in Cilicia, or from Amantia, an ancient city in the transboundary region between Epirus or southern Illyria in antiquity.

==Toxicity==
Several members of the section &quot;Phalloidieae&quot; are notable for their toxicity, containing toxins known as amatoxins, which can cause liver failure and death. These include the death cap &quot;A. phalloides&quot;; species known as destroying angels, including &quot;A. virosa&quot;, &quot;A. bisporigera&quot; and &quot;A. ocreata&quot;; and the fool&#x27;s mushroom, &quot;A. verna&quot;.

More recently, a series in the subgenus &quot;Lepidella&quot; has been found to cause acute kidney failure, including &quot;A. smithiana&quot; of northwestern North America, &quot;A. pseudoporphyria&quot; of Japan, and &quot;A. proxima&quot; of southern Europe.
==Edibility==
Although many species of &quot;Amanita&quot; are edible, including all of &quot;sect. Caesareae&quot; and &quot;sect. Vaginatae&quot; (together comprising hundreds of species), many fungi experts advise against eating a member of &quot;Amanita&quot; unless the species is known with absolute certainty. Because so many species within this genus are so deadly toxic, if a specimen is identified incorrectly, consumption may cause extreme sickness and possibly death.

===Edible===
Edible species of &quot;Amanita&quot; include &quot;Amanita fulva&quot;, &quot;A. vaginata&quot; (grisette), &quot;A. calyptrata&quot; (coccoli), &quot;A. crocea&quot;, &quot;A. rubescens&quot; (blusher), &quot;A. caesarea&quot; (Caesar&#x27;s mushroom), and &quot;A. jacksonii&quot; (American Caesar&#x27;s mushroom).

===Inedible===
Inedible species of &quot;Amanita&quot; include &quot;Amanita albocreata&quot; (ringless panther), &quot;A. atkinsoniana&quot;, &quot;A. citrina&quot; (false death cap), &quot;A. excelsa&quot;, &quot;A. flavorubescens&quot;, &quot;A. franchetii&quot;, &quot;A. longipes&quot;, &quot;A. onusta&quot;, &quot;A. rhopalopus&quot;, &quot;A. silvicola&quot;, &quot;A. sinicoflava&quot;, &quot;A. spreta&quot;, and &quot;A. volvata&quot;.

===Poisonous===
Poisonous species include &quot;Amanita brunnescens&quot;, &quot;A. cokeri&quot; (Coker&#x27;s amanita), &quot;A. crenulata&quot;, &quot;A. farinosa&quot; (eastern American floury amanita), &quot;A. frostiana&quot;, &quot;A. muscaria&quot; (fly agaric), &quot;A. pantherina&quot; (panther cap), and &quot;A. porphyria&quot;, but not &quot;A. ceciliae&quot;.

===Deadly poisonous===
Deadly poisonous species include &quot;Amanita abrupta&quot;, &quot;A. arocheae&quot;, &quot;A. bisporigera&quot; (eastern NA destroying angel), &quot;A. exitialis&quot; (Guangzhou destroying angel), &quot;A. magnivelaris&quot;, &quot;A. ocreata&quot; (western NA destroying angel), &quot;A. phalloides&quot; (death cap), &quot;A. proxima&quot;, &quot;A. smithiana&quot;, &quot;A. subjunquillea&quot; (East Asian death cap), &quot;A. verna&quot; (fool&#x27;s mushroom), and &quot;A. virosa&quot; (European destroying angel).

==Psychoactive species==

=== &quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; ===
&quot;Amanita muscaria&quot; was widely used as an entheogen by many of the indigenous peoples of Siberia. Its use was known among almost all of the Uralic-speaking peoples of western Siberia and the Paleosiberian-speaking peoples of the Russian Far East. There are only isolated reports of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; use among the Tungusic and Turkic peoples of central Siberia and it is believed that on the whole entheogenic use of &quot;A. muscaria&quot; was not practiced by these peoples.

=== &quot;Amanita pantherina&quot; ===

&quot;Amanita pantherina&quot; contains the psychoactive compound muscimol, but is used as an entheogen much less often than its much more distinguishable relative &quot;A. muscaria&quot;.

=== Others ===
Other species identified as containing psychoactive substances include:

* &quot;Amanita citrina&quot;
* &quot;Amanita gemmata&quot;
* &quot;Amanita porphyria&quot;
* &quot;Amanita regalis&quot;
* &quot;Amanita strobiliformis&quot;

<doc id="245703" wikidata="Q2443148" url="?curid=245703" title="Top Fuel">
<text>Top Fuel is a type of drag racing whose dragsters are the quickest accelerating racing cars in the world and the fastest sanctioned category of drag racing, with the fastest competitors reaching speeds of and finishing the runs in 3.641 seconds.

A top fuel dragster accelerates from a standstill to in as little as 0.8 seconds (less than one third the time required by a production Porsche 911 Turbo to reach ) and can exceed in just . This subjects the driver to an average acceleration of about over the duration of the race and with a peak of over .

Because of the speeds, this class races a distance, not the traditional drag-race length of one-fourth of a statute mile, or . The rule was introduced in 2008 by the National Hot Rod Association after the fatal crash of Funny Car driver Scott Kalitta during a qualifying session at Old Bridge Township Raceway Park in Englishtown, New Jersey. The shortening of the distance was used by the FIA at some tracks, and as of 2012 is now the standard Top Fuel distance defined by the FIA. The International Hot Rod Association, which at the time sanctioned Top Fuel in Australia, dropped the 1/4-mile distance in September 2017 after a campaign by Santo Rapisarda, a car owner who often runs NHRA races in the United States.

==Top Fuel racing==

Before their run, racers often perform a burnout to clean and heat tires. The burnout also applies a layer of fresh rubber to the track surface, improving traction during launch.

At maximum throttle and RPM, the exhaust gases escaping from a dragster&#x27;s open headers produce about of downforce. The massive airfoil over and behind the rear wheels produces much more, peaking at around when the car reaches about .

The engine of a Top Fuel dragster generates around 150 dB of sound at full throttle, enough to cause physical pain or even permanent damage. Before a run, race announcers usually advise spectators to cover or plug their ears. Ear plugs and even earmuffs are often handed out to fans at the entrance of a Top Fuel event.

Dragsters are limited to a wheelbase of .

The most prolific active driver in Top Fuel is Tony Schumacher and the most successful crew chief is Alan Johnson, who was the crew chief for six of Schumacher&#x27;s championships, the back-to-back titles won by driver Gary Scelzi and was the crew chief for his brother Blaine for his entire professional career. The first female driver in the Top Fuel category is also the most associated female in the drag racing world, Shirley Muldowney, who won three championships during her career.

==Fuel==
Since 2015, NHRA regulations limit the composition of the fuel to a maximum of 90% nitromethane; the remainder is largely methanol. However, this mixture is not mandatory, and less nitromethane may be used if desired. While nitromethane has a much lower energy density () than either gasoline () or methanol (), an engine burning nitromethane can produce up to 2.4 times as much power as an engine burning gasoline. This is made possible by the fact that, in addition to fuel, an engine needs oxygen in order to generate force: the stoichiometric ratio of petrol is 14.7:1 air to petrol, and 1.7:1 air to nitromethane, which, unlike gasoline, already has oxygen in its molecular composition. For a given amount of air consumed, this means that an engine can burn 7.6 times more nitromethane than gasoline.

Nitromethane also has a high latent heat of vaporization, meaning that it will absorb substantial engine heat as it vaporizes, providing an invaluable cooling mechanism. The laminar flame speed and combustion temperature are higher than gasoline&#x27;s at and respectively. Power output can be increased by using very rich air-fuel mixtures. This also helps prevent pre-ignition, which is often a problem when using nitromethane.

Because of the relatively slow burn rate of nitromethane, very rich fuel mixtures are often not fully ignited, and some remaining nitromethane can escape from the exhaust pipe and ignite on contact with atmospheric oxygen, burning with a characteristic yellow flame. Additionally, after sufficient fuel has been combusted to consume all available oxygen, nitromethane can combust in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, producing hydrogen, which can often be seen burning from the exhaust pipes at night as a bright white flame. In a typical run the engine can consume between and of fuel during warmup, burnout, staging, and the quarter-mile run.

==Top Fuel engines==

===Rules===
Like many other motor sport formulas originating in the United States, NHRA-sanctioned drag racing favors heavy restrictions on engine configuration, sometimes to the detriment of technological development. In some cases, teams are required to use technologies that may be decades old, resulting in cars that may seem substantially less advanced than the average family car. However, while some basic facets of engine configuration are heavily restricted, other technologies, such as fuel injection, clutch operation, ignition, and car materials and design, are under constant development.

NHRA competition rules limit the engine displacement to . A bore with a stroke are customary dimensions. Larger bores have been shown to weaken the cylinder block. Compression ratio is about 6.5:1, as is common on engines with overdriven Roots-type superchargers.

===Engine===
The engine used to power a Top Fuel drag racing car is based on a second generation Chrysler RB Hemi, but is built exclusively of specialized parts. It retains the basic configuration with two valves per cylinder activated by pushrods from a centrally-placed camshaft. The engine has hemispherical combustion chambers, a 58-degree in. to ex. valve stem angle; bore pitch.

The block is machined from a piece of forged aluminum. It features press-fitted, ductile iron cylinder liners. There are no water passages in the block, which adds considerable strength and stiffness. The engine is cooled by the incoming air/fuel mixture and the lubricating oil. Like the original Hemi, the racing cylinder block has a deep skirt for strength. There are five main bearing caps, which are fastened with aircraft-standard-rated steel studs, with additional reinforcing main studs and side bolts (&quot;cross-bolting&quot;). There are three approved suppliers of these custom blocks; Keith Black, Brad Anderson, and Alan Johnson.

The cylinder heads are machined from aluminum billets. As such, they, too, lack water jackets and rely entirely on the incoming air/fuel mixture and lubricating oil for their cooling. The original Chrysler design of two large valves per cylinder is used. The intake valve is made from solid titanium and the exhaust from solid Nimonic 80A or similar. Seats are of ductile iron. Beryllium-copper has been tried but its use is limited due to its toxicity. Valve sizes are around for the intake and for the exhaust. In the ports there are integral tubes for the push rods. The heads are sealed to the block by copper gaskets and stainless steel o-rings. Securing the heads to the block is done with aircraft-rated steel studs and stud nuts.

The camshaft is billet steel, made from 8620 carbon or S7 through-hardened tool steel or similar. It runs in five oil pressure lubricated bearing shells and is driven by gears in the front of the engine. Mechanical roller lifters (cam followers) ride atop the cam lobes and drive the steel push rods up into the steel rocker arms that actuate the valves. The rockers are of roller tip type on the intake and exhaust sides. Like the cam follower rollers, the steel tip roller rotates on a steel roller bearing and the steel rocker arms rotate on a pair of through-hardened tool steel shafts within bronze bushings. Intake and exhaust rockers are billet. The dual valve springs are of coaxial type and made out of titanium. Valve retainers are also made of titanium, as are the rocker covers.

Billet steel crankshafts are used; they all have a cross plane a.k.a. 90 degree configuration and run in five conventional bearing shells. 180 degree crankshafts have been tried. Due to ease of laying out an exhaust system with even pulsation, the 180 degree crankshaft can offer increased power in engines with interacting exhaust. However this does not concern Top Fuel engines with separate exhaust pipes for each cylinder. A 180 degree crankshaft is about lighter than 90 degree crankshaft, but they create a lot of vibration. Such is the strength of a top fuel crankshaft that in one incident, the entire engine block was split open and blown off the car during an engine failure, and the crank, with all eight connecting rods and pistons, was left still bolted to the clutch.

Pistons are made of forged aluminum. They have three rings and aluminum buttons retain the steel wrist pin. The piston is anodized and Teflon coated to prevent galling during the high thrust load operation encountered. The top ring is an L-shaped section &quot;Dykes&quot; ring that provides the best seal during combustion, but a second ring must be used to prevent excessive oil from entering the combustion chamber during intake strokes, as the Dykes-style ring offers less than optimal reverse gas/oil sealing. The third ring is an oil scraper ring whose function is to scrape the majority of the oil film off the cylinder wall as the piston descends from top dead center (TDC), to prevent oil being exposed to combustion heat and contaminating the upcoming round of fuel/air. This &quot;oil scraping&quot; also provides a key heat removal step for the cylinder walls and piston skirts; the oil film is renewed as the piston moves upward after reaching bottom dead center (BDC).

The connecting rods are of forged aluminum and do provide some shock damping, which is why aluminum is used in place of titanium, endangering the bearings and thus the crankshaft and block. Each con rod has two bolts, shell bearings for the big end while the pin runs directly in the rod.

===Superchargers===
The supercharger must be a 14-71 type Roots blower. It has twisted lobes and is driven by a toothed belt. The supercharger is slightly offset to the rear to provide an even distribution of air. Absolute manifold pressure is usually , but up to is possible. The manifold is fitted with a burst plate. Air is fed to the compressor from throttle butterflies with a maximum area of . At maximum pressure, it takes approximately to drive the supercharger.

These superchargers are in fact derivatives of General Motors scavenging-air blowers for their two-stroke diesel engines, which were adapted for automotive use in the early days of the sport. The model name of these superchargers delineates their size – the once commonly used 6-71 and 4-71 blowers were designed for General Motors diesels having six cylinders of each, and four cylinders of each, respectively. Thus, the currently used 14-71 design can be seen to be a huge increase in power delivery over the early designs, purpose-built for the GM Detroit Diesel truck powerplants.

Mandatory safety rules require a secured Kevlar-style blanket over the supercharger assembly as &quot;blower explosions&quot; are not uncommon, from the volatile air/fuel mixture coming from the fuel injectors being drawn directly through them. The absence of a protective blanket exposes the driver, team and spectators to shrapnel in the event that nearly any irregularity in the induction of the air/fuel mixture, the conversion of combustion into rotating crankshaft movements, or in the exhausting of spent gasses is encountered.

===Oil and fuel systems===
The oil system has a wet sump which contains of SAE 70 mineral or synthetic racing oil. The pan is made of titanium or aluminum. Titanium can be used to prevent oil spills in the event of a blown rod. Teams are fined and points are lost if oil is spilled on the track surface, so all teams make provision for absorbent blankets/diapers below the engine. Oil pump pressure is somewhere around during the run, at start up, but actual figures differ between teams.

Fuel is injected by a constant flow injection system. There is an engine driven mechanical fuel pump and about 42 fuel nozzles. The pump can flow per minute at 7500 rpm and fuel pressure. In general 10 injectors are placed in the injector hat above the supercharger, 16 in the intake manifold and two per cylinder in the cylinder head. Usually a race is started with a leaner mixture, then as the clutch begins to tighten as the engine speed builds, the air/fuel mixture is enriched. As the increased engine speed builds up pump pressure, the mixture is made leaner to maintain a predetermined ratio that is based on many factors, especially race track surface friction. The stoichiometry of both methanol and nitromethane is considerably greater than that of racing gasoline, as they have oxygen atoms attached to their carbon chains and gasoline does not. This means that a &quot;fueler&quot; engine will provide power over a very broad range from very lean to very rich mixtures. Thus, to attain maximum performance, before each race, by varying the level of fuel supplied to the engine, the mechanical crew may select power outputs barely below the limits of tire traction. Power outputs which create tire slippage will &quot;smoke the tires&quot; and as a result the race is often lost.

===Ignition and timing===
The air/fuel mixture is ignited by two spark plugs per cylinder. These plugs are fired by two 44-ampere magnetos. Normal ignition timing is 58-65 degrees BTDC (This is dramatically greater spark advance than in a petrol engine as &quot;nitro&quot; and alcohol burn far slower). Directly after launch the timing is typically decreased by about 25 degrees for a short time as this gives the tires time to reach their correct shape. The ignition system limits the engine speed to 8400 rpm. The ignition system provides initial 60,000 volts and 1.2 amperes. The long duration spark (up to 26 degrees) provides energy of . The plugs are placed in such a way that they are cooled by the incoming charge. The ignition system is not allowed to respond to real time information (no computer-based spark lead adjustments), so instead a timer-based retard system is used.

===Exhaust===
The engine is fitted with eight individual open exhaust pipes, in diameter and long. These are made of steel and fitted with thermocouples for measuring of the exhaust gas temperature. They are called &quot;zoomies&quot; and exhaust gases are directed upward and backwards. Exhaust temperature is about at idle and by the end of a run. During a nighttime event, the slow-burning nitromethane can be seen to extend flames many feet out from the exhaust pipes.

The engine is warmed up for about 80 seconds. After the warm up the valve covers are taken off, oil is changed and the car is refueled. The run including tire warming is about 100 seconds which results in a &quot;lap&quot; of about three minutes. After each lap, the entire engine is disassembled and examined, and worn or damaged components are replaced.

===Performance===
Measuring the power output of a top fuel engine directly is not always feasible. Certain models use a torque sensor incorporated as part of the RacePak data system. Dynamometers that can measure the output of a Top Fuel engine exist; however, the main limitation is that a Top Fuel engine cannot be run at its maximum power output for more than 10 seconds without overheating or possibly destroying itself explosively. Making such high power levels from such relatively limited displacement is a result of using very high boost levels and running at extremely high RPMs; both of these stress the internal components to a high degree, meaning that the peak power can only safely be achieved for brief periods of time, and even then only by intentionally sacrificing components. The engine power output can also be calculated based upon the car&#x27;s weight and its performance. The calculated power output of these engines is most likely somewhere between , which is about twice as powerful as the engines installed on some modern diesel locomotives, with a torque output of approximately and a brake mean effective pressure of .

In late 2015, tests using sensors developed by AVL Racing showed peak power of over .

For the purposes of comparison, a 2009 SSC Ultimate Aero TT, which at the time was among the world&#x27;s most powerful production automobiles, produces of power and of torque.

From start to finish the engine will turn 240 revolutions. Including start up, burnout, staging and the race, the engine must survive just 500 revolutions before being rebuilt. This calculation assumes an average racing engine speed of roughly 3,800 revolutions per minute over a period of 3.8 seconds.

==Mandatory safety equipment==
Much of organized drag-racing is sanctioned by the National Hot Rod Association. Since 1955, the association has held regional and national events (typically organized as single elimination tournaments, with the winner of each two car race advancing) and has set rules for safety, with the more powerful cars requiring ever more safety equipment.

Typical safety equipment for contemporary top fuel dragsters: full face helmets with fitted HANS devices; multi-point, quick release safety restraint harness; full body fire suit made of Nomex or similar material, complete with face mask, gloves, socks, shoes, and outer sock-like boots, all made of fire-resistant materials; on board fire extinguishers; kevlar or other synthetic &quot;bullet-proof&quot; blankets around the superchargers and clutch assemblies to contain broken parts in the event of failure or explosion; damage resistant fuel tank, lines, and fittings; externally accessible fuel and ignition shut-offs (built to be accessible to rescue staff); braking parachutes; and a host of other equipment, all built to the very highest standards of manufacturing. Any breakthrough or invention that is likely to contribute to driver, staff, and spectator safety is likely to be adopted as a mandated rule for competition. The 54-year history of NHRA has provided hundreds of examples of safety upgrades.

In 2000, the NHRA mandated the maximum concentration of nitromethane in a car&#x27;s fuel be no more than 90%. In the wake of a Gateway International Raceway fatality in 2004, involving racer Darrell Russell, the fuel ratio was reduced to 85%. Complaints from teams in regards to cost, however, has resulted in the rule being rescinded starting in 2008, when the fuel mixture returns to 90%, as NHRA team owners, crew chiefs, and suppliers complained about mechanical failures that can result in oildowns or more severe crashes caused by the reduced nitromethane mixture. They also mandated enclosed roll cages.

The NHRA also mandated that different rear tires be used to reduce failure, and that a titanium &quot;shield&quot; be attached around the back-half of the roll-cage to prevent any debris from entering the cockpit. This also was the result of the fatal crash at Gateway International Raceway. The rear tire pressure is also heavily regulated by Goodyear Tire and Rubber on behalf of the NHRA, at , the absolute minimum pressure allowed.

At present, final drive ratios higher than 3.20 (3.2 engine rotations to one rear axle rotation) are prohibited, in an effort to limit top speed potential, thus reducing the level of danger.

== History ==
In 1958, NHRA banned nitro in all categories; the American Hot Rod Association (AHRA) still allowed it, and Fuel Dragsters (FD), Hot Roadsters (HR), and Fuel Coupés (FC): this led to Fuel Altereds (AA/FAs), Factory Experimentals (A/FXs), and (ultimately) Funny Cars (TF/FCs).

Independent drag strips, not NHRA sanctioned, offered venues for the fuel racers. Smokers Car Club hosted the first U.S. Fuel and Gas Championship at Famoso Raceway in March 1959. Bob Hansen won Top Fuel Eliminator (TFE) in his A/HR, with a speed of .

Jimmy Nix, who previously ran a Top Gas dragster; Jim Johnson, who ran a Dodge Polara stocker, and who had won the B/SA title in 1963; Jim Nelson; and Dode Martin pioneered TF/FC. (Nix tried to persuade Chrisman to get Mercury Racing Director Fran Hernandez to allow him to run his Comet&#x27;s 427 on nitro, as a way to gain leverage on NHRA, so Nix could use nitro himself). These cars ran in NHRA&#x27;s S/FX class, variously defined as &quot;Super Factory Experimental&quot; or &quot;Supercharged Factory Experimental&quot;.

They were shortly turning in E.T.s in the low 11s and trap speeds of over ; at Long Beach on 21 March, an 11.49 pass at was recorded.

Bob Sullivan&#x27;s &quot;Pandemonium&quot; (a &#x27;65 Plymouth Barracuda) joined about six other nitro-fuelled early funny cars facing fuel dragsters in the 1965 season.

In 1971, Don Garlits introduced the &quot;Swamp Rat XIV&quot;, a rear-engined Top Fuel dragster. While others had been developed in the previous decade, it was the first successful one, winning the 1971 NHRA Winternationals.

In 1984, Top Fuel was at a low point. It was having trouble attracting full sixteen-car fields, leading to cutting back to eight-car rosters, while the International Hot Rod Association dropped Top Fuel entirely. The same year, Joe Hrudka offered a major purse, the Cragar-Weld Top Fuel Classic and &quot;Big Daddy&quot; Don Garlits returned to Top Fuel full-time. By 1987, NHRA Top Fuel Funny Car was drawing twice as many entrants as positions available.

In 2012 enclosed cockpits were allowed to be used regularly used in top fuel by the NHRA.

<text>The Colorado Rapids are an American professional soccer club based in the Denver metropolitan area. The Rapids compete in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Western Conference. Founded in 1995, as part of the Anschutz Corporation, later to be a founding sports franchise of the global sports and entertainment concern AEG, the club is a founding member of MLS, playing their first season in 1996.

The Rapids are owned by the Kroenke Sports &amp; Entertainment, also owners of the Denver Nuggets of the NBA, Colorado Avalanche of the NHL, Colorado Mammoth of the NLL, and other sports teams outside of the state of Colorado.

Colorado won the MLS Cup in 2010, their second MLS Cup appearance. The first appearance was in 1997, losing to D.C. United. They were also runners-up of the U.S. Open Cup in the 1999 tournament, where they lost to the Rochester Raging Rhinos, the last time a non-MLS team won the Cup. The Rapids play their home games at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City, moving to the stadium after it opened during the 2007 season.

==History==

===Early years===

The Colorado Rapids were one of the ten founding clubs of Major League Soccer, owned and operated by the Anschutz Corporation. The inaugural 1996 season was a forgettable one for Colorado. Despite fielding experienced players like Shaun Bartlett, Chris Henderson, Chris Woods, Roy Wegerle and Marcelo Balboa, and head coach Bob Houghton, the team finished last in the Western Conference with the worst record in the league. Balboa became the first player ever to score for the club and also the first to record a goal at Mile High Stadium (in 1996).

For the following season, Glenn Myernick was hired as a new head coach and Dan Counce joined as a general manager. Myernick and Counce brought new faces to the squad including Paul Bravo, Wolde Harris, Ross Paule, and keeper Marcus Hahnemann. The team struggled early on, but rallied to grab a post-season spot. The Rapids pulled off two upsets and advanced to the 1997 MLS Cup final. Chris Henderson scored a mid-air scissor kick goal past Dallas keeper Mark Dodd in the 87th minute in the Western Conference final, ensuring Colorado&#x27;s place in the MLS Cup final. They scored in the MLS Cup (hosted at the home stadium of the opposing club) thanks to a goal by Adrián Paz, with the team and club barely able to make the trip thanks to an impending record snowstorm in Denver, but lost the final 2–1 to D.C. United.

Colorado continued on a roller coaster of success alternating with major disappointment: Myernick brought in more new players including Anders Limpar and Marcus Hahnemann and the club made it to the 1999 U.S. Open Cup final, only to be upset 2–0 by the Rochester Raging Rhinos.

The 2000 season boasted two of the more memorable moments in Rapids history. The first was Marcelo Balboa&#x27;s famous bicycle kick which garnered the Goal of the Year. The second was clinching a playoff spot in the final game of the season against the Los Angeles Galaxy, with Paul Bravo scoring in the 97th minute.

In 2001, Tim Hankinson took the reins as Colorado&#x27;s new head coach. Scottish striker John Spencer also joined the club that year. While Hankinson did bring effective players like Mark Chung, Chris Henderson, Carlos Valderrama, and Joe Cannon to the squad—and made the playoffs every year—Hankinson also signed a number of expensive and unsuccessful players including Zizi Roberts and Darryl Powell. During his coaching stint, the club also traded away club legend Marcelo Balboa, who would play one game for MetroStars before retiring.

The Rapids set a new MLS record for the lowest home Goals Against Average over an entire season with at 0.53 by only allowing eight goals in 15 matches at Invesco Field during the season, and never more than one in a single game. After Kansas City broke the Rapids&#x27; MLS record 16-game home undefeated streak on June 9, the Black &amp; Blue reeled off 11 more undefeated home games. On the year Colorado was undefeated when scoring more than one goal, a credit to the play of goalkeeper Joe Cannon and the suffocating defense.

===2007–13===
New head executive Jeff Plush took over the business responsibilities of the club when he was named Managing Director in January 2006. The club&#x27;s colors were changed to burgundy and blue, to align with other clubs owned by Kroenke Sports Enterprises. This accompanied the company&#x27;s commitment to building the world&#x27;s largest professional soccer stadium and fields complex, Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park, which opened to worldwide acclaim in March 2007, and formulating relationships with another KSE soccer club, Arsenal of the English Premier League and Pachuca of Mexico.

The Rapids enjoyed a successful inaugural year at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park, hosting numerous international exhibitions and tournaments on the stadium&#x27;s complex, and successfully bid and won the rights to host and produce the 2007 MLS All-Star Game; on the pitch though the team&#x27;s record was 9–13–8.
The team started out strong with a 2–1 victory over D.C. United in frigid conditions. Herculez Gomez became the first player to score in the Rapids&#x27; brand new stadium. The team had a long winless streak that saw them sink in the standings. Colorado ultimately finished just shy of a playoff spot. Major low points in the season included an embarrassing 5–0 loss to the Seattle Sounders in the Lamar Hunt U.S. Open Cup, and a defeat to Real Salt Lake that saw them lose both a playoff berth and the possession of the Rocky Mountain Cup. The club won the MLS Reserve League for the second consecutive year.

Heading into the 2008 season, Rapids GM Charlie Wright added depth to the midfield and defense. Major signings included Christian Gómez and Jose Burciaga Jr. The 2008 season saw a resurgent Rapids side, which started off the season with a complete thrashing of David Beckham and the LA Galaxy by a 4–0 score on Opening Day to launch the season. However, an inconsistent mid-season stretch where, for 13 games, the Rapids could not win two games in a row or lose 2 in a row, saw Clavijo resign from the head coach position for personal reasons, and saw Gary Smith, an assistant coach who came from the Arsenal F.C. system, take over on an interim basis with 11 games left in the season. Under Smith&#x27;s direction, the Rapids surged into the playoff race, with two key away wins, but fall short of the playoffs in the last game of the season, against Real Salt Lake. Salt Lake tied the Rapids 1–1 in the 90th minute of that game to eliminate the Rapids from playoff contention. 

The 2009 campaign featured head coach Gary Smith in his first full season. Smith&#x27;s first appointment was ex-England international Steve Guppy as his assistant; Guppy had spent the previous season at USL-1 team Rochester Rhinos as their player assistant coach. Shortly after, Rapids veteran midfielder Pablo Mastroeni re-signed with the club for four years after mulling potential offers from Europe. The Rapids also signed new four-year contracts with midfielders Colin Clark and Nick LaBrocca and defenders Jordan Harvey and Kosuke Kimura. The Colorado Rapids acquired former QPR and Chicago Fire goalkeeper Matt Pickens to replace Senegalese goalkeeper Bouna Coundoul. The other major roster move included the arrival of Iván Guerrero from D.C. United in exchange for midfielder Christian Gomez and backup goalkeeper Mike Graczyk. The media criticized the Rapids for not making more roster changes for the 2009 season. However, the core of the team remained intact.

====2010 MLS Cup Champions====
The 2010 campaign featured many roster moves: Danny Earls, Jeff Larentowicz, Claudio Lopez, Quincy Amarikwa, Ian Joyce, and Wells Thompson join the club. The offseason also included a new contract for star forward Conor Casey. The Colorado Rapids also excited many of the ultras supporter groups by the creation and construction of a supporters terrace within Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park. During the summer transfer window, the Colorado Rapids signed academy youth player Davy Armstrong, and brought in defender Anthony Wallace from FC Dallas. Colorado also sent Mehdi Ballouchy to New York Red Bulls in exchange for Macoumba Kandji and acquired Brian Mullan from Houston Dynamo in exchange for Colin Clark. Following these changes, Colorado qualified for the MLS Cup playoffs and defeated the Columbus Crew in the first round. On November 13, Colorado hosted the San Jose Earthquakes in the MLS Eastern Conference Championship and won by a score of 1–0, leading to the team&#x27;s first trip to the MLS Cup since 1997. Colorado faced off against FC Dallas in the finals. During the final, the Rapids trailed 1–0 at halftime. Conor Casey equalized in the second half to send the game to extra time. Macoumba Kandji helped set up the game-winner that went off FC Dallas defender George John. Colorado won the 2010 MLS Cup 2–1, Colorado&#x27;s first MLS Cup championship and first major trophy in the club&#x27;s history.

The 2011 campaign led to no roster changes. However, Sanna Nyassi and Tyrone Marshall were signed from Seattle Sounders FC. Joseph Nane and Josh Janniere were additions from Toronto FC. Local product Steven Emory was signed after an open tryout during preseason. The Rapids made the headlines when Irish International and former Hull City striker Caleb Folan signed with the club. The primary departure was defender Julian Baudet. Since Colorado won the 2010 MLS Cup, they automatically qualified for the group stages of the 2011–2012 CONCACAF Champions League. On September 9, Colorado signed versatile defender Miguel Comminges. The Guadeloupe International can play at either Left or Right back. On September 13, Comminges made his debut for Colorado as a substitute in a 4–1 home loss to Club Santos Laguna in the CONCACAF Champions League.

The 2012 season began with several changes to the club. Oscar Pareja was appointed head coach following the departure of Gary Smith. The team traded Sanna Nyassi to the Montreal Impact, and Macoumba Kandji to Houston Dynamo. Acquiring Hunter Freeman, Jaime Castrillón, Luis Zapata, and young Kamani Hill and the loan of young talent Martín Rivero the Rapids looked to begin on a positive note. After defeating the Columbus Crew 2–0 on opening day, things seemed promising. However, as the season ticked by, things started to turn for the worst. Looking for a turnaround, Hárrison Henao was loaned and Brazilian Edu was signed. In July, Kosuke Kimura was traded to the Portland Timbers. Shortly after, defender Tyson Wahl was brought in via trade from the Montreal Impact. After a poor season, the Rapids looked for a late-season turnaround when they signed Hendry Thomas from Wigan Athletic. The Rapids were eliminated from playoff contention in late September ending hopes for another MLS cup.

The 2013 season for the Rapids saw massive changes made to the team. All-time leading goal scorer Conor Casey was released and Omar Cummings would be traded during the offseason, the Forward duo combining for 89 goals in the Rapids&#x27; careers. With the majority of the 2010 MLS Champions team gone (only 5 players remaining on the squad), the team looked considerably different. Coach Oscar Pareja wanting a squad of younger, more athletic players. Colorado finished the 2013 season campaign with a 14–11–9 (W-L-T) record which placed them fifth in the Western Conference, eighth in the overall standings. They were eliminated in the knockout round in the playoffs. During the off-season, Oscar Pareja revealed his desire to return to FC Dallas to be the head coach there after taking the opportunity to do so. Eventually, Colorado found his successor which would be none other than Colorado veteran Pablo Mastroeni who had previously retired as a player.

===2014–2020===
Under Mastroeni&#x27;s first year as head coach, Colorado finished eighth in the West and seventeenth overall having 8 wins, 18 losses, and 8 ties having the Rapids fail to qualify for the MLS Cup Playoffs, after previously qualifying last year. Despite an upper-mid table performance to start the season, the club was plagued heavily by injuries, causing the team to go winless in their final fourteen matches of the season. In the U.S. Open Cup, the Rapids were eliminated from the tournament to the Atlanta Silverbacks. Additionally, they were unable to defend their Rocky Mountain Cup title, losing to rivals, Real Salt Lake.

During the off-season following the 2015 season, where Colorado finished last in the Western Conference, The Rapids had made major changes in their line up, which includes acquiring players: Shkelzen Gashi, Marco Pappa, Jermaine Jones and Tim Howard, who all joined by the summer transfer window. The club went on to having a successful 2016 campaign with a 15-game unbeaten streak and a trip to the western conference championship in which they lost to Seattle Sounders 3–1 aggregate. The 2017 campaign saw the departure of Jermaine Jones, and several weeks into the season, the Rapids made more changes to their roster by trading Sam Cronin and Marc Burch to new expansion side Minnesota United FC. The team struggled, and head coach Pablo Mastroeni was fired by the end of the season as the Rapids finished the 2017 season with 9 wins, 19 losses and 6 draws, good for 10th in the Western Conference.

For the 2018 season, the Rapids hired former New Zealand coach Anthony Hudson. The Rapids made many additions, including wingback Edgar Castillo and midfielder Jack Price while switching to Hudson&#x27;s preferred 3–5–2 formation. The season began with the Rapids being eliminated from the 2018 CONCACAF Champions League by Toronto FC, a tournament they had qualified for on the strength of the 2016 campaign. The middle of the 2018 saw another major trade with 2017&#x27;s leading goalscorer Dominique Badji being traded to FC Dallas for Kellyn Acosta. Despite the changes in the 2018 season, it ended with another 10th place Western Conference finish, with the Rapids accruing 8 wins, 19 losses and 7 draws.

For the 2019, the Rapids turned their attention to MLS veterans for additions to the roster adding Benny Feilhaber, Kei Kamara, Diego Rubio and Keegan Rosenberry. The team also added youngsters Jonathan Lewis, Matt Hundley, Sam Raben and Andre Shinyashiki to the squad. In the preseason, the Rapids parted ways with Sheklzen Gashi. Despite the changes to the team and scoring in every game but one, the Rapids began the 2019 season winless in their first 11 games. The Rapids parted ways with Hudson after going winless in the first nine games of the season. The club named Conor Casey as interim head coach on May 1. Casey led the Rapids to a record of 7 wins, 7 losses and 4 draws. On August 25, the Rapids named Robin Fraser the club&#x27;s ninth permanent head coach. Fraser posted a 5–2–0 (W-L-D) record, falling just shy of the postseason.

The Rapids made several moves ahead of 2020, trading for Auston Trusty and permanently acquiring Lalas Abubakar. The club also brought in Drew Moor, a 2010 MLS Cup champion with Colorado, as well as goalkeeper William Yarbrough, midfielder Nicolas Benezet and Designated Player Younes Namli. The Rapids started 2020 with two wins before MLS paused its season in early March due to COVID-19. Colorado was placed in Group D of the MLS is Back Tournament with Real Salt Lake, Sporting Kansas City and Minnesota United FC. The MLS regular season restarted in August with Colorado taking three points from four games. On September 12, the Rapids defeated Real Salt Lake 5–0, marking Colorado&#x27;s first ever win at Rio Tinto Stadium and beginning a run of three wins in four, including three shutouts. After several players and team staff tested positive for COVID-19, the Rapids paused their season, eventually cancelling five matches. After a full month between games, the Rapids returned to action with losses at Sporting KC and Minnesota. MLS changed the MLS Cup Playoffs qualifying format to points-per-game on Oct. 31. The Rapids then defeated defending MLS Cup champion Seattle Sounders FC, 3–1, before clinching a playoff berth with a 1–0 win at Portland Timbers on Nov. 4. Colorado closed the regular season with a 2–1 win at Houston Dynamo on Nov. 8. Colorado visited Minnesota in the first round of the Audi 2020 MLS Cup Playoffs, falling 3–0. The season featured break-out performances by Rapids Homegrown defender Sam Vines and Homegrown midfielder Cole Bassett. Vines played every minute of every regular season match, while Bassett led the team with five goals and five assists. Both were named to MLS 22 Under 22 for a second consecutive year.

==Colors and badge==

The Rapids&#x27; image has evolved a great deal since their inception. The team has undergone two complete re-brandings. Originally using green as the primary uniform color, the team changed to black and blue for the 2003 season.

As Colorado were preparing to move into Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park for the 2007 season, the club re-invented themselves again to more closely align with the DNA and color scheme of other KSE teams, changing their colors to burgundy and blue, and creating a brand new shield logo to fit in with more traditional global soccer marks.

Colorado has had three logos in their history. They originally first used the &quot;river&quot; logo as their primary crest with the &quot;circular&quot; logo as a secondary one. In 2002, the two logos would switch, with the &quot;circular&quot; one becoming the primary. For the 2007 re-branding, the Rapids created the new shield-style logo, which is the one that is currently used today. Its main features consist of a mountain representing the Rocky mountains in the region as well as the number 96, referring to the franchise&#x27;s Inaugural season.

The original look of the Rapids sported a predominantly white kit with green trim, when the club&#x27;s uniform supplier was Puma. Other minor colors such as gold and blue were occasionally incorporated, with the club&#x27;s association with Reebok. Eventually, black became more heavily used and eventually overtook white as the more dominant color that accompanied the green, when the club switched to Kappa.
The Rapids underwent an image change prior to the 2003 season. Following the club&#x27;s switch to Atletica, the uniform colors switched to black and blue vertical stripes, similar to the uniforms worn by Italian Serie A club Inter Milan. The blue and black vertical stripes remained almost unchanged when MLS adopted Adidas as their league-wide kit sponsor.

The uniforms underwent one last change for the 2007 season. The Rapids now sport burgundy (Pantone 202) and sky blue (Pantone 278) as their primary colors. The Colorado Rapids also have a brand new third uniform, consisting of a white shirt, white socks and burgundy shorts.

The Rapids&#x27; home jersey for 2013 featured the same burgundy primary color and featured the names of all season ticket holders imprinted in the fabric. The Rapids also had a special away jersey for the 2013 season, featuring the colors of the Colorado state flag.

The club&#x27;s use of burgundy led to Scottish pop band Little Eye, fronted by the brother of Rapids player Jamie Smith, writing a song about the team called &quot;Burgundy Sky&quot;, which is now used as the Rapids official anthem.

The Colorado Rapids were the last existing MLS club to earn a paid sponsorship deal on the front of their jerseys. In May 2014, the club announced a five-year sponsorship deal with Ciao Telecom. In October 2014, the Rapids sued Ciao for missed payments and quietly disassociated from the company. The club later reached an agreement with Transamerica as a jersey sponsor in 2015. The Rapids then extended their agreement with Transamerica and they would continue being partners until the end of the 2020 season. In November 2022, the Rapids confirmed a partnership with UCHealth, marking the end of a two-year period without a jersey sponsor. Under this agreement, UCHealth will serve as the team&#x27;s jersey sponsor until the conclusion of the 2029 Major League Soccer season.

==Stadium==


The Rapids play their home games at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park in Commerce City (approximately 8 miles north of downtown Denver). The stadium capacity is 19,680 and cost $131 million to construct. It is also referred to as a soccer-specific stadium, since it was constructed for the Colorado Rapids. The soccer stadium opened on April 7, 2007. The stadium complex includes youth soccer fields and various retail establishments, and is owned and operated by Kroenke Sports Enterprises (KSE) which also owns the Colorado Avalanche, Denver Nuggets, Colorado Crush and Colorado Mammoth sports franchises. The team had sought a soccer-specific stadium as early as 1999 due to the lack of control at Mile High.

The team&#x27;s first home stadium was Mile High Stadium, a large American football venue shared with the Denver Broncos. The Rapids played there until September 8, 2001, and had an average attendance of over 13,000 for most matches. The stadium closed at the end of the 2001 season and the Rapids moved to the Broncos&#x27; new stadium, Invesco Field at Mile High, after signing a three-year lease in January 2002. The Rapids would use the lower bowl of the stadium with a reduced capacity of 27,000 seats for most matches. The team had faced potential relocation or contraction without the long-term lease; other options in the Denver area, including Folsom Field in Boulder, were rejected for various issues.

The Rapids have one of the highest discrepancies between their home record and away record in MLS. From their inception in 1996 through the 2014 season, the Rapids record at home was 146–73–6, winning about 65% of their matches at home. However, the Rapids were only 70–164–4 on the road during that same time span, winning only 29% of their games on the road.

==Club culture==
===Rocky Mountain Cup===
In 2005, Real Salt Lake joined Major League Soccer and became the Rapids&#x27; closest neighbor. The supporters groups of the two clubs created a regular-season competition between the two sides to foster and memorialize this budding rivalry. Each season, the Rocky Mountain Cup is determined by the winner of the head-to-head fixtures within league play.

===Supporters===
The Rapids had strong fan attendance in 2002 when they led the league in average fans per game. For 2011–12 CONCACAF Champions League (CCL) games, the Supporters Terrace was officially closed. CONCACAF regulations require &quot;all-seater&quot; stadiums, and the terraces at Dick&#x27;s Sporting Goods Park are standing-only areas with no stadium seating. CCL group stage fixtures have seen the Pid Army and the Bulldog Supporters Group relocated to either midfield in the East stands (against Isidro Metapán) or directly behind the South goal in sections 117 and 118 (against Santos Laguna and Real España). In 2012, it was revealed that the Rapids had 3,561 season ticket holders after the club&#x27;s front office mistakenly emailed a spreadsheet that contained a list of every season ticket holder in the season ticket base. The front office admitted to the mistake in a follow-up email to the season ticket holders. On February 9, 2013, the leaders of the club&#x27;s three supporters groups—Class VI, the Pid Army and the Bulldog Supporters Group—announced that they would combine into one group going forward: Centennial 38.

==Broadcasting==
Rapids matches appeared on several channels including Altitude Television, which is owned by Kroenke Sports Entertainment as are the Colorado Avalanche and Denver Nuggets. Major League Soccer determined in 2007 that every game must be televised, either through a regional (or local) TV station, or a national channel.

Prior to 2013, the play-by-play duties were covered by a variety of voices, notably Todd Romero and Marc Stout, before the Rapids brought in former BBC sports broadcaster, Richard Fleming. Fleming spent 16 years at the BBC, covering the FIFA World Cup, Confederations Cup, the European Championship, the CAF Africa Cup of Nations, and the English Premier League. He even reported on a World Cup qualifier in North Korea, and later worked for Arsenal TV. He was joined by U.S. legend Marcelo Balboa as color analyst during the team&#x27;s era on Altitude.

Connor Cape and others also do play-by-play for Altitude Radio.

From 2023, every Rapids match is available via MLS Season Pass on the Apple TV app.

<doc id="245711" wikidata="Q309095" url="?curid=245711" title="New England Revolution">
<text>The New England Revolution are an American professional soccer club based in the Greater Boston area. The club competes in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. It is one of the ten charter clubs of MLS, having competed in the league since its inaugural season.

The club is owned by Robert Kraft, who also owns the New England Patriots along with his son, Jonathan Kraft. The name &quot;Revolution&quot; refers to the New England region&#x27;s significant involvement in the American Revolution that took place from 1775 to 1783.

New England plays their home matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts, located 21 miles (34 km) southwest of downtown Boston. The club played their home games at the adjacent and now-demolished Foxboro Stadium, from 1996 until 2001. The Revs are the only original MLS team to have every league game in their history televised.

The Revolution won their first major trophy in the 2007 U.S. Open Cup. The following year, they won the 2008 North American SuperLiga. They won their first Supporters&#x27; Shield in 2021. The Revolution have participated in five MLS Cup finals in 2002, 2005, 2006, 2007, and 2014, which are the most of clubs who have not won the MLS Cup.

==History==

===The early years (1996–2001)===
Soccer has a long history in the New England region. In 1862, the Oneida Football Club in Boston was the first organized team to play any kind of &quot;football/soccer&quot; in the United States. In the 1920s, the Boston Soccer Club (later renamed the Bears) and Fall River F.C. were formed and played in the professional American Soccer League, which comprised teams based in the Northeastern U.S. region. The &#x27;Marksmen&#x27; were one of the most successful soccer clubs in the United States, winning the National Challenge Cup four times. At the inaugural FIFA World Cup in 1930 in Uruguay, Bert Patenaude (from Fall River, Massachusetts) scored the first hat-trick in World Cup play. The USMNT finished in third place. The Boston area was next represented by the New England Tea Men (1978–80) and Boston Minutemen (1974–76), who played in the FIFA-backed, major professional North American Soccer League (NASL). However, each club struggled for financial solvency and folded. The NASL folded in 1984, leaving the United States without a top-level soccer league until Major League Soccer (MLS) began play in 1996.

The success of the 1994 FIFA World Cup (with Foxboro Stadium as one of nine venues) paved the way for a new era of sports in the Boston area and to bring professional soccer back to the region. On June 6, 1995, Robert Kraft became the founding investor/operator of the Revolution, joining Major League Soccer (MLS) as one of its 10 charter clubs for its inaugural season in 1996. Kraft is also the owner of the National Football League&#x27;s (NFL) New England Patriots and CEO of the Kraft Group.

The Revolution were the last of the MLS charter clubs to name a head coach, ultimately selecting Frank Stapleton on January 4, 1996, after conducting interviews with Osvaldo Ardiles and Brian Quinn. The Revolution played their first-ever league match on April 13, 1996, a 3–2 loss away to the Tampa Bay Mutiny. The match saw the Revolution&#x27;s first goal in club history scored by Robert Ukrop in the 20th minute (he would score the second goal in club history in the 71st minute). The Revolution recorded their first-ever club win a week later on April 20, a 1–0 victory over the MetroStars courtesy of a Nicola Caricola own goal. The Revolution played its first home match on April 27, 1996, beating D.C. United in a shoot-out in front of 32,864 fans at Foxboro Stadium.

The inaugural Revolution team featured several U.S. Men&#x27;s national team regulars returning from abroad to be part of the new league. Despite the presence of Alexi Lalas, Mike Burns, and Joe-Max Moore, however, the team was one of only two that failed to make the playoffs of the then 10 team league. Stapleton clashed with several Revolution players, with Lalas and defender Iain Fraser requesting trades. Stapleton would resign at the conclusion of the season, on September 26, with a record of 15 wins and 17 losses.

In November, Thomas Rongen, who had led Tampa Bay to the Supporter&#x27;s Shield the prior season, was appointed as Stapleton&#x27;s replacement. In 1997 the Revolution qualified the playoffs for the first time in team history, buoyed by the stand-out play of pre-season acquisition Walter Zenga and All-stars Alexi Lalas and Ted Chronopoulos. However the Revolution failed to advance past the first round, losing in the Conference Semifinals home and away to D.C. United. For the next five years, this playoff result would be the Revs&#x27; best (which they matched in the 2000 season), as a revolving door of players and head coaches failed to make much of an impact on the fledgling league.

In February 1998, the Revolution participated in the first three-team trade in league history, ultimately signing 1997 All-star and D.C. United stand-out striker Raúl Díaz Arce. Arce recorded 18 goals and 8 assists for the Revolution in 1998, but the team were unable to build on the success of the prior campaign, and Rongen announced his resignation on August 24. Zenga stepped in as manager for the remaining six matches of the season, and was named the league&#x27;s first player-manager on October 28.

In 1999, The Revolution traded for National Team captain John Harkes, as well as 1996 MLS All-Star Giovanni Savarese. Despite these additions, the team again missed the playoffs, and only recorded one additional win over their 1998 campaign. Zenga was relieved of his coaching and playing duties on September 30. Steve Nicol concluded the season as Revolution interim manager, and Fernando Clavijo was named head coach on November 29.

Clavijo led the Revolution to a .500 record - the best tally in the club&#x27;s history until that point, and also led them back to the playoffs for the first time since the 1997 season. Pre-season addition Wolde Harris led the club in scoring with 15 goals. The Revolution would again fail to advance beyond the first round of the playoffs, but did manage to record their first-ever playoff win, a 2–1 result over the Chicago Fire thanks to goals from Eric Wynalda and Mauricio Wright. Harkes represented the Revolution in the 2000 MLS All-Star Game.

The Revolution made history in the 2000 U.S. Open Cup, becoming the first-ever MLS team to lose to an amateur club, when they were defeated in the second round at home by the Mid Michigan Bucks 1-0.

The Revolution began their 2001 campaign with six straight defeats. They managed only 7 victories in the season, but did manage to make the final of the 2001 U.S. Open Cup - ultimately losing to the Los Angeles Galaxy on a golden goal by Danny Califf. It was a harbinger of finals to come for the Revolution.

Attendance in these early years was high despite the team&#x27;s poor on-field performances. More than 15,000 people per match regularly came to watch the Revolution play in the old Foxboro Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts.

===Steve Nicol era (2002–2011)===

Liverpool great Steve Nicol was appointed as head coach on a full-time basis during the 2002 season. He had previously held the position of interim head coach during the 1999 and 2002 seasons. After taking over, Nicol guided the Revolution to a playoff berth for a league-record eight straight seasons, failing for the first time in 2010. The first six of those berths (from 2002 to 2007) resulted in an appearance in the conference final or better, including three consecutive MLS Cup finals from 2005 to 2007. From the 2008 season until 2013, the Revs failed to go further than the first round of the playoffs. Still, Nicol was respected as one of the best coaches in the league.

====Playoff success (2002–2007)====
In his first season in charge, Nicol guided the Revs to a first-place finish in the Eastern Conference. The team advanced through the playoffs to MLS Cup 2002, where they lost to the Galaxy again, this time 1–0 on a golden goal by Carlos Ruiz. Held at Gillette Stadium, the Cup final was attended by 61,316 spectators, the largest figure for any MLS Cup until MLS Cup 2018, and the largest for a Revolution match until 2024.

====Consecutive MLS Cup finals====
Craig Tornberg was officially named the Revolution&#x27;s General Manager on December 16, 2003. The 2003 New England Revolution season saw the Revolution&#x27;s 3rd all-time hat trick, scored against the Chicago Fire on August 31 in a 5–1 win, by Revolution striker Chris Brown. In July 2003, the Revolution signed José Cancela from Deportivo Saprissa. On July 27, 2003, Gillette Stadium hosted a double-header, with FC Barcelona and Juventus FC playing at 4:00 PM as part of the ChampionsWorld Series, and New England playing DC United at 6:30. In front of 30,912 fans, the Revolution established a 2–0 lead on a brace from Twellman, with Cancela recording his first assist as a member of the team. However an 83rd-minute goal by Eliseo Quintanilla, as well as three second-half, stoppage-time goals by Quintanilla, Dema Kovalenko, and Alecko Eskandarian, would see the Revolution enter the All-Star break with a 4–2 defeat. The Revolution set new club records for goals in a half (4) and total goals scored (6) in their 6–1 September 18 victory over Colorado Rapids.

In 2004, former England international, Plymouth Argyle F.C., and Ipswich Town F.C. legendary striker Paul Mariner would join Nicol&#x27;s staff as an assistant coach.

After losing in the conference finals in 2003 and 2004, the Revs repeated their 2002 feat finishing tops in the east and losing the cup final to Los Angeles 1–0 in extra time again in 2005. New England had a real chance to win their first MLS championship, in MLS Cup 2006, against the Houston Dynamo. After Taylor Twellman scored in the 113th minute, the Revs allowed an equalizing header from the Dynamo&#x27;s Brian Ching less than a minute later that sent the game to penalty kicks, where the Revs lost 4–3. Their 2002 MLS Cup appearance granted them a spot in the 2003 CONCACAF Champions Cup, but they lost their first match-up 5:3 on aggregate after playing two games on the road to LD Alajuelense. The Revolution again faced LD Alajuelense of Costa Rica in the home and away 2006 CONCACAF Champions&#x27; Cup. The &quot;home&quot; game was played February 22, 2006, in Bermuda despite some fans feeling that playing at Gillette Stadium in the adverse conditions of winter in New England could have been advantageous. The Revs failed to advance, as they drew 0–0 in Bermuda and lost 0–1 in Costa Rica.

In the 2007 season, the Revs made it to two cup finals. The 2007 MLS Cup was a rematch from the previous year, though the result was the same as Houston defeated New England 2–1.

In the 2007 pre-season, New England sold Clint Dempsey to Fulham F.C. for a club, and league, record fee of $4m. Jose Cancela was lost in the 2006 MLS expansion draft to Toronto FC. The Revolution announced in November 2006 that they were not exercising the contract option of José Manuel Abundis. Daniel Hernandez would return to Liga MX and sign with Club Puebla. Offseason acquisitions overwhelmingly came through the 2007 MLS Superdraft, in which the Revolution made a joint-highest 6 selections, with 2 in the first round, selecting Wells Thompson and Amaechi Igwe.

Despite early season injuries limiting Joseph, Parkhurst, Franchino, and Noonan, The Revolution flew out of the gates to begin their 2007 campaign. Filling in for Noonan, rookie striker Adam Cristman, who the Revolution drafted with he fifth-to-last-pick in the Superdraft, had a strong year, contributing 4 goals and 3 assists. He would ultimately finish the season as a finalist for 2007 MLS Rookie of the Year. After dropping their season opener 1–0 to Chicago Fire, the Revolution went on a 7 match, 5-0-2 unbeaten run, which included an impressive 3–2 victory against LA Galaxy in Carson, which saw an 84th minute Tyrone Marshall equalizer nullified one minute later by an 85th minute Taylor Twellman winner.

This unbeaten run was snapped on May 26 in a 4–3 loss to Kansas City Wizards which featured historic hat trick from Eddie Johnson, who became the first MLS player to net three times in back-to-back matches.

Although he did not play in the match, newly signed David Beckham would travel with the LA Galaxy to Gillette in August, and a goal from Twellman would see off the Galaxy 1–0 in front of a regular-season record crowd of 35,402 fans, the highest-ever for a regular season home Revolution home game, and the second-highest in Revolution history, only topped by the 2002 MLS Cup final.

Results were primarily positive down the back end of the season, and the Revolution ultimately finished second in the Eastern Conference behind only D.C. United, with a 14–8–8 record, qualifying for the MLS Cup Playoffs for the sixth consecutive season. In the final regular season match against Toronto FC, Michael Parkhurst would score his first ever MLS goal, beating Toronto keeper Kyriakos Stamatopoulos from beyond midfield. The goal was named a finalist for 2007 MLS Goal of the Year Award.

The team was represented by five players (and its head coach) in the 2007 MLS Allstar game. In addition to being named to the 2007 MLS League XI alongside Joseph, Parkhurst also won MLS defender of the Year and MLS Humanitarian of the Year.

The Revolution stumbled into the 2007 MLS Cup Playoffs winless in their last 3 final regular season matches, but began their run by holding the New York Red Bulls to a 0–0 draw, and ousting them a week later on November 3 thanks to a 64th minute Taylor Twellman goal. The single-leg Eastern Conference Final saw the Revolution match up yet again with Chicago Fire. A 38th minute bicycle kick goal from Twellman would be enough to steer the Revolution past the Fire to their fourth Eastern Conference Championship, and into the MLS Cup Final match for the third consecutive time.

MLS Cup was held at RFK Stadium on November 18, 2007, in front of a crowd of 38,859. For the first time in league history the match would be contended between the two same sides in back to back years, as the Revolution were once again facing off against Houston Dynamo. The Revolution would take a regulation-lead for the first time in their championship history when Taylor Twellman headed home a Steve Ralston cross in only the 20th minute of the match.

In the second half, Houston would switch its formation from 4–4–2 to a more aggressive 3–5–2. The Dynamo were without star striker Brian Ching, who had controversially been chosen over Twellman for the 2006 FIFA World Cup USA Squad. Nevertheless, they conceded two goals in the space of 13 minutes to Joseph Ngwenya and Dwayne De Rosario. Jeff Larentowicz nearly converted a diving header on a cross served in by substitute Andy Dorman in the 87th minute, but the effort was parried away by Pat Onstad.

The Revolution hold the record for most losses in MLS Cup games. Though they lost the 2007 MLS Cup, they defeated FC Dallas 3–2 to win their first-ever trophy: the 2007 U.S. Open Cup.

====Rebuilding (2008–2010)====

The 2008 season saw many pieces of the Revolution&#x27;s MLS cup teams depart. After the 2007 season, contract negotiations with Andy Dorman fell through. He would sign for St Mirren F.C. in the Scottish Premiership. Pat Noonan&#x27;s 2008 option was not picked up, and he signed with AAalesunds FK in the Norwegian Eliteserien, where he would join former Rev Adin Brown. Defender James Riley was selected by San Jose Earthquakes in the 2007 MLS expansion draft, and Marshall Leonard was waived by the club after six seasons. In April, long-time defender Joe Franchino returned to the LA Galaxy in exchange for a second round 2009 MLS Superdraft pick. In May, Avery John would sign with Miami FC.

To reinforce their defense the Revolution traded for 3-time MLS Cup Champion defender and U.S. international Chris Albright. They additionally added Hondauran international midfielder Mauricio Castro from C.D. Olimpia and eventual Costa Rican international striker Argenis Fernández from Santos de Guápiles F.C. as a &quot;discovery player.&quot; In the summer transfer window, the club added Costa Rican international defender Gabriel Badilla from Deportivo Saprissa.

The 2007 U.S. Open Cup victory qualified the club for the preliminary round of the newly expanded CONCACAF Champions League. Additionally, their top-four finish qualified them for SuperLiga 2008. Therefore, the Revolution competed in four different competitions (MLS, Open Cup, Champions League, and SuperLiga) during the 2008 season. Uniquely, 2008 would mark the first time the Revolution would host a season-opening game.

The Revolution had an excellent run at the beginning of the 2008 season. By mid-July, they were leading the overall MLS table and had finished as the number one overall seed in SuperLiga. The team won the tournament, defeating Atlante F.C. in the semi finals, and the Houston Dynamo in the final on penalties to earn a small amount of revenge on for their successive MLS Cup defeats. The Revolution&#x27;s 2008 Superliga campaign saw the team making news off the field news as well, when, while traveling to their Group B match against Chivas USA in July on American Flight 725, GM Craig Tornberg in tandem with Gwynne Williams and Michael Burns subdued a naked man who had emerged from the bathroom and was &quot;speaking gibberish&quot; and making a &quot;beeline for the emergency door.&quot; The Federal Bureau of Investigation credited members of the Revolution with subduing the man, who was then taken into custody and placed under psychic evaluation. Two days later the Revolution would draw Chivas USA 1–1, securing their position atop Group B and earning in berth in the semi final.

The SuperLiga trophy, however, was the high point for the 2008 Revs. Fixture congestion led to a rash of injuries and general fatigue, and the team crashed out the Champions League with an embarrassing 4–0 home defeat to regional minnows Joe Public FC of Trinidad and Tobago (the tie ended 6–1 Joe Public on aggregate). The team also struggled in domestic play, limping to a third-place finish in the East and losing to the Chicago Fire in the first round of the playoffs 3–0 on aggregate. The Revs managed a semifinal appearance in the 2008 U.S. Open Cup, but lost to D.C. United.

In 2009, the Revs continued the mediocrity that had plagued the second half of their 2008 season. In the 2008-09 offeason, the club lost Michael Parkhurst to Danish Superliga club FC Nordsjælland when his contract expired at the end of 2008.

Khano Smith was selected by Seattle Sounders FC in the expansion draft. Rhode Island native Nico Colaluca joined in a trade with Colorado Rapids, seeing Rob Valentino&#x27;s tenure with the club end. Adam Cristman was traded to Kansas City Wizards in exchange for allocation money and a 2009 third round draft pick. In the 2009 MLS SuperDraft, the Revolution made a league-leading seven total selections, notable amongst these were a pair of defenders: #10 overall pick Kevin Alston, and Darrius Barnes, who would become the only rookie in MLS to play every minute of the 2009 MLS season. At the end of March, the Revolution would add Ghanaian defender Emmanuel Osei.

The Revolution went 4 straight matches unbeaten to begin the season, but were then thumped 6–0 by eventual-champion Real Salt Lake at Rio Tinto Stadium, with all 6 goals coming in the second half. The loss was the heaviest in the Revolution&#x27;s 14-year history to that point.

The Revolution would record some positive history, however, when Taylor Twellman became just the 5th player in Major League Soccer to record 100 goals, doing so with a brace in a 4–0 victory over New York Red Bulls on June 7 in only his second appearance of the year.

To bolster the club&#x27;s offense, the Revolution added journeyman Lithuanian striker Edgaras Jankauskas in the summer window. his week 26 goal against the Kansas City Wizards was nominated for the MLS Goal of the Year Award.

The Revolution concluded their 2009 campaign in 3rd place in the Eastern Conference and in 7th place in the overall league table. Shalrie Joseph led the team in regular season scoring with 8 goals and was named to the 2009 MLS Allstar Game roster. The Revolution entered the playoffs for the 8th straight season, and took on Chicago Fire in the Eastern Conference Semifinals. The Revolution won the home leg 2–1 behind goals from Emmanuel Osei and Shalrie Joseph, but would lose the away leg 2–0, bowing out of the playoffs on aggregate after an 83rd-minute goal from Cuauhtémoc Blanco. This would be the Revolution&#x27;s last playoff appearance for the next four years. The team also lost to Chicago in the semifinals of the 2009 North American SuperLiga.

Analysts expected the 2010 season to be &quot;interesting,&quot; as a rebuild was inevitable following the departure of yet more key pieces from the teams that had been so successful over the past six seasons. The 2009-10 offseason saw the retirement of Jay Heaps after 11 seasons, and also saw long-time captain Steve Ralston move to AC St. Louis after 11 years in the league and a league-leading 378 matches played. Long-time assistant coach Paul Mariner additionally would depart in the offseason, taking the reins at his former club Plymouth Argyle F.C. on December 10.

With Matt Reis still recovering from shoulder surgery, the Revolution were in need of a keeper to start the season, so they traded for former Southern New Hampshire University star Preston Burpo. The deal saw Jeff Larentowicz and Wells Thompson move to Colorado Rapids in exchange for Burpo and former Feyenoord defender Cory Gibbs.

In the 2010 MLS SuperDraft, the Revolution added Zack Schilawski and Seth Sinovic with their respective first and second round picks.

On March 26, winger Khano Smith would mark his return to the Revolution after a pre-season trial. The club also signed Marko Perović on a free transfer from FC Basel. Perović would end up as the team&#x27;s lead-scorer in 2010, and the winner of the team&#x27;s 2010 MVP award.

On April 10, 2010, Steve Nicol recorded his 100th win as Revolution manager in the Revolution&#x27;s 4–1 win over Toronto FC. In doing so Nicol became only the third coach in MLS history with 100 wins under his belt, and the only current coach to pass that milestone other than Sigi Schmid. In that victory, Superdraft pick Schilawski scored the ninth hat trick in Revolution history, and the first since Kheli Dube scored three times against Real Salt Lake at Gillette Stadium on Aug. 23, 2009. Unfortunately, following that performance, the Revolution would win only one of its next eleven matches.

Despite the dismal start, which saw the team failing to put together an unbeaten streak longer than three games until July, the unbeaten streak coincided with the Revs&#x27; third consecutive SuperLiga appearance, and for the second time in three years, the team made the competition&#x27;s final. In the 2010 North American SuperLiga, the Revolution finished atop Group B a perfect 3–0, defeating Chicago Fire FC, Club Universidad Nacional, and Monarcas Morelia by the same scoreline of 1–0. In the semi-finals, hosted at Gillette, a Kenny Mansally goal in the 56th minute would be canceled out by a goal from Nicolás Olivera two minutes later. The match would end in penalties, with the Revolution besting Puebla 5–3 after Reis, who converted a penalty, saved Edgar Lugo&#x27;s to end the match.

The 2010 Superliga Final was hosted at Gillette Stadium on September 1, 2010, in front of 10,414 fans. The Revolution would once again play Monarcas Morelia, who they&#x27;d beaten in group play. A 79th-minute goal from Kevin Alston was not enough to offset Miguel Sabah&#x27;s brace, and the Revolution would lose the championship 2–1. Results improved slightly in the second half of the season with the Revolution recording 5 wins, 7 defeats and 3 draws down the stretch. The Revolution would finish in 13th in the overall MLS table, 6th in the Eastern Conference and the season would mark the first in which the Revolution failed to qualify for the playoffs in Nicol&#x27;s tenure.

====Nicol&#x27;s Departure====

The 2011 season would go down as the worst in the club&#x27;s sixteen-year history. With a record of 5 wins, 16 defeats and 13 draws, the Revolution would finish at the bottom of the Eastern Conference, and second-to-last in the overall MLS table, with only expansion club Vancouver Whitecaps FC below them. The club&#x27;s 1–9–7 away record was joint-worst in the league, tied with Toronto FC.

Major roster news arrived soon after the conclusion of the 2010 season. On November 3, 2010, legendary Revolution striker Taylor Twellman announced his retirement. He would conclude his career as the Revolution&#x27;s top scorer, and the sixth highest scorer in MLS history with 101 goals in his 8 seasons of play. On November 15, 2010, the Revolution signed its first ever homegrown player, Diego Fagúndez, to a first team contract.

In January, the club added a pair of veteran French internationals, signing defender Didier Domi from Olympiacos F.C. and Ousmane Dabo, who had been a free agent for 7 months. The team made a joint-most five selections in the 2011 MLS SuperDraft, and used its sixth overall pick on defender A.J. Soares.

The club&#x27;s first win came on March 26, 2011, a 2–0 victory over DC United that saw goals by Shalrie Joseph and Zack Schilawski.

In April, the club would further strengthen its roster with the additions of U.S. international Benny Feilhaber via allocation ranking, and the signing of journeyman Danish international striker Rajko Lekić.

Results, however, did not particularly improve. In late April, 2010 standout Marko Perović would tear his ACL. He would be released in June. From May 21 to July 17 the club would go 9 games without a win. A July 20 1–0 win over DC United would be the club&#x27;s only 3 point tally in its next seven matches.

In the summer transfer window, the club added its first-ever Designated Player in Milton Caraglio, and signed Morocco international midfielder Monsef Zerka from Iraklis F.C.. Perhaps emblematic of the club&#x27;s 2011 struggles was a September 7 away fixture at Philadelphia Union, which marked Zerka&#x27;s debut and first goal. In the match, the Revolution established a 4–1 lead in the space of 33 minutes to then ultimately draw 4–4, conceding a goal to Freddy Adu in the 55th minute and a late brace to Sébastien Le Toux, whose second goal came in the 92nd minute of stoppage time. A win the following week would be the last of the Revolution&#x27;s season, and the club would close out the season with a six-game winless streak, losing five matches in a row.

The Revolution ultimately once again failed to make the playoffs in 2011, and at the end of the 2011 season, announced they had parted ways with manager Steve Nicol. Nicol had managed the team for a league-record 10 years, recording a 112–108–81 overall record, and delivering the club its first two pieces of silverware in its history.

=== Jay Heaps Era (2012–2017) ===

The club announced on November 9, 2011, that Brian Bilello and Mike Burns were being promoted to the positions of club President and General Manager, respectively. Six days later, on November 15, the club announced that it had hired former Revolution player (and then-acting Revolution color commentator) Jay Heaps as its new head coach. Heaps&#x27; first career victory as head coach came in the Revolution&#x27;s 2012 home opener; a 1–0 win over the Portland Timbers on March 24, 2012. The Revolution&#x27;s goal in that match was scored by Saër Sène, who had signed for the Revolution in the 2011-12 offseason in a free transfer from FC Bayern Munich. Sene would be the Revolution&#x27;s top scorer in 2012, notching 11 goals. Also in the 2011-12 offseason, the Revolution experienced a unique transfer saga while attempting to sign Colombian international striker Jose Moreno Mora on loan from Once Caldas. The Revolution announced the signing of Moreno on February 2, 2012. Despite this announcement, on February 7, Moreno reportedly publicly stated that he had chosen to remain with Once Caldas instead of reporting to the Revolution. On the 9th, Club President Brian Bilello wrote in an article on the Revolution&#x27;s website that all necessary paperwork had been filed to complete the loan deal, and that representatives from the team had been attempting to contact Moreno, but were unable to do so. Shortly thereafter, WUNR&#x27;s &quot;Deportes y Mas&quot; host Marino Velasquev reported that the Revolution, in conjunction with MLS, had sued Moreno for breach on contract. Velasquez added on February 13 that the team was taking the case to FIFA. Moreno would report to the Revolution nearly 7 weeks later, citing visa issues and a &quot;Personal Matter&quot; keeping him from arriving. He scored his only goal for the franchise in a 2–1 defeat to DC United on April 14. In August of that year, after making a total of 7 appearances, Moreno was waived by the club.

The 2012 season was another disappointment, with the Revolution ultimately finishing second from bottom in the Eastern Conference and 18 points out of a playoff berth. The 2012 season also saw the departure of Shalrie Joseph, who had spent 10 years with the club and had been nominated to four league-best XI&#x27;s during his tenure. In early July, the Revolution added Honduran international striker Jerry Bengtson as a Designated Player. The team would then go on a ten-game winless streak, finally snapped on September 5 thanks to Dimitry Imbongo&#x27;s first MLS goal.

Despite the lack of on-field results, the rebuild started by Heaps and Burns would set the team up for success in future seasons by building a core of talented players, adding U.S. international Lee Nguyen via weighted lottery and eventual U.S. international Kelyn Rowe via the MLS Superdraft. In the 2012 offseason and during the 2013 season, the club continued to rebuild its core. The Revolution would add eventual 2013 MLS best XI defender José Gonçalves, U.S. U18 international and Revolution homegrown Scott Caldwell, U.S. internationals Juan Agudelo and Charlie Davies, and the club&#x27;s first-ever 1st-overall draft pick Andrew Farrell as it restored itself as a contender.

This 2013 team would finish in 3rd place in the Eastern Conference, making the playoffs for the first time since 2009, and benefitting from a breakout season by budding homegrown player, Diego Fagúndez, who grew up in Leominster, Massachusetts, and who led the team with 13 goals, adding 7 assists, during the campaign. The Revolution&#x27;s season would end in the Eastern Conference semifinal round on November 6, 2013, with a 4–3 aggregate defeat to eventual MLS Cup champion Sporting Kansas City. Following the conclusion of the 2013 season, long-time Revolution keeper Matt Reis would announce his retirement. Kevin Alston would be named MLS Comeback Player of the Year in December, returning after his battle with chronic myelogenous leukemia .

In the April 2014 issue of &quot;Boston Magazine&quot;, journalist Kevin Alexander named the Kraft family as &quot;the Worst Owners in the League&quot; in an article that contrasted the family&#x27;s sparkling reputation as NFL owners with their alleged lack of interest in MLS and the Revolution.

==== 2014 Cup Run ====
Fans were optimistic entering the 2014 season. Heaps received credit for rebuilding a playoff-contending team in one season, and the Revolution returned a &quot;young and talented&quot; team with playoff expectations once again. Juan Agudelo would depart in January for Stoke City F.C., but the club traded for U.S. international striker Teal Bunbury in February to offset the loss.

Despite two straight losses to open the season, the Revolution would go on a 5-game winning streak throughout the month of May (their longest in nearly a decade) and found themselves in first place in the Eastern Conference entering a May 31 meeting with the Montreal Impact. A loss in that match would subsequently kick off an 8-game losing streak, tied for second longest in the club&#x27;s history, and the Revolution found themselves in 6th place in the East, and out of the playoffs, as the month of July concluded.

The Revolution&#x27;s fortunes would change when, via &quot;blind draw&quot;, the club signed U.S. national team member Jermaine Jones in late August on a designated player contract. The club then went on a 10–1–1 streak led by Jones and MVP candidate Lee Nguyen to finish in 2nd place in the regular season in the Eastern Conference. The Revolution breezed through the playoffs without losing a game, defeating the Columbus Crew 7–3 on aggregate in the semi-finals, and defeating the New York Red Bulls 4–3 on aggregate in the Eastern Conference Finals. Both series featured braces from New England-born striker Charlie Davies, as well as a pair of goals from Lee Nguyen and Teal Bunbury. Both series also featured heroics from Revolution goalkeeper Bobby Shuttleworth, who led the 2014 MLS Cup Playoffs in saves with a total of 18. The victory over New York Red Bulls saw the Revolution making it to the MLS Cup Final for the first time since 2007.

On December 7, 2014, in front of a 27,000 person sell-out crowd at the StubHub Center, New England met the LA Galaxy. The occasion marked the third time the two clubs had played each other in the final, with the Galaxy besting the Revolution on the two prior occasions. The Revolution would once again lose, this time by a score of 2–1. The Revolution&#x27;s lone goal was scored by Chris Tierney, a native of Wellesley, Massachusetts. This marked the club&#x27;s fifth MLS Cup loss in five MLS Cup Final appearances. The 2014 season also saw the Revolution establish a &quot;strategic partnership&quot; with Sporting CP.

==== Decline ====
The Revolution entered the 2015 season with high expectations, and many pundits backed the club as a contender not only for the Eastern Conference Championship, but also for MLS Cup. The club continued to bolster its squad prior to the season, re-adding Juan Agudelo, a key component of the 2013 squad, who was returning from Europe. Agudelo would finish 2nd in scoring for the Revolution in 2015, behind Charlie Davies&#x27; 10 goals in his second full campaign with the club. Nevertheless, the club was unable to replicate the success of 2014, in part due to injuries limiting Jermaine Jones to just 18 appearances, and the Revolution ultimately lost in the knockout round of the 2015 MLS Cup Playoffs 2–1 to DC United, in part to a red card issued to Jones for physicality towards referee Mark Geiger. Although the Revolution were unable to match or exceed their expectations in 2015, the club would set a new record attendance for a single match, when a crowd of 42,947 turned out for the home finale on October 15 against Montreal Impact.

In early 2016, the Revolution signed Xavier Kouassi as a Designated Player. The club additionally traded for Gershon Koffie, ostensibly as a replacement for Jermaine Jones, who they would trade to Colorado Rapids in March after failing to agree on a contract. Unfortunately, Kouassi would miss the entire 2016 season with a knee injury. The Revolution would trade for veteran MLS striker Kei Kamara in May in a &quot;blockbuster&quot; deal with Columbus Crew SC. Kamara would end the 2016 season joint-top scorer for the club, along with Juan Agudelo. The Revolution were competitive for the majority of the 2016 season, but would ultimately narrowly miss out on the playoff berth based on goal differential. Highlights from the 2016 season included Andrew Farrell being chosen as an MLS all star, and the team making a run in the 2016 U.S. Open Cup; ultimately reaching the 2016 U.S. Open Cup final, but falling 4–2 to FC Dallas. The regular season concluded with a 3–0 home victory over Montreal Impact in front of 39,587 fans. That attendance figure then-marked the second-highest home attendance figure for a Revolution regular season game, behind the 2015 regular season finale, and ahead of the 2007 August LA Galaxy match. It would also help boost the Revolution&#x27;s overall average home attendance figure to 20,201, a new club record.

The 2017 season brought a close to the Jay Heaps era in New England. The club would once again finish one spot outside of a playoff berth. Despite a stellar 12–2–3 home record, the team went a dismal 1–13–3 on the road. The Revolution would attempt to strengthen the roster in the summer transfer window, adding center back Claude Dielna as a designated player and trading $200,000 in Targeted Allocation Money, $200,000 in General Allocation Money and an international roster spot to Columbus for striker Krisztián Németh.

On September 13, 2017, New England suffered a record-breaking 7–0 defeat away to Atlanta United FC. The 7 goal margin of defeat tied the MLS record for largest margin of victory, and the Revolution became the first club in MLS history to not record a single shot in a match. On September 18, two days after a disappointing 3–1 loss to Sporting Kansas City, the Revolution announced it had parted ways with head coach Jay Heaps, and that Tom Soehn would be serving as interim for the remainder of the season. During his six seasons in charge of the Revolution, Heaps recorded a 75W-81L-43D record, leading the club to three successive MLS playoffs, an MLS Cup Final, and a U.S. Open Cup Final.

=== Brad Friedel Era (2018–2019) ===
In November 2017 the Revolution announced that the former United States men&#x27;s national team goalkeeper, and former U.S. U-19 coach Brad Friedel would be the club&#x27;s next head coach. Entering the 2018 season excitement surrounding the club&#x27;s ability to compete was tempered, as it was understood that with a new head coach came a change in philosophy which would take time to implement. Many analysts predicted the club would miss the playoffs entirely.

In the 2018 pre-season, the Revolution traded Kei Kamara to Vancouver Whitecaps FC in exchange for a 2019 first round draft pick, and a conditional 2020 second round pick. On loan from C.F. Pachuca, the team brought in Ecuadorian striker Cristian Penilla. Citing frustration over his contract (he was at the time the seventh-highest paid player on the team, making $500,000, despite ranking fifth in the league in over-all goals over the previous four seasons), Lee Nguyen reportedly demanded a trade at the end of the 2017 season on three separate occasions. The dispute would ultimately lead to his sitting-out the team&#x27;s 2018 pre-season training camp. Nguyen would ultimately be traded to Los Angeles FC on May 1, 2018, in exchange for $350,000 in General Allocation Money and $350,000 in Targeted Allocation Money. The Revolution started their 2018 campaign strongly, and on March 10, 2018, Friedel&#x27;s Revolution won its first game, 2–1 over the Colorado Rapids. Entering July, and the midpoint of the season, the Revolution were on a six-match unbeaten run, and sporting an impressive record of 7–4–6, six points above the playoff line, and earning their highest point total since the MLS moved to 34 games in 2011, and the most they’d had through 17 games since 2008. Their unbeaten run would end at 7 matches on July 14, when a 93rd minute Chris Pontius goal gave the LA Galaxy a 3–2 victory. That match was notable as the Revolution saw season-high attendance of 36,573, the largest crowd in 2 years. Offensively, Teal Bunbury recorded 10 goals in the season&#x27;s first 17 matches. Defensively, goalkeeper Matt Turner experienced breakout success, starting all four of New England&#x27;s matches to open the season while recording a 1.25 goals against average and 16 saves, and, on March 31, 2018, he recording his first MLS clean sheet in the club&#x27;s 2–0 win at BBVA Compass Stadium against Houston Dynamo FC. This was an impressive milestone, given that Turner was the first Revolution keeper to record a clean sheet since August 24, 2016. Cristian Penilla additionally had a very strong 2018 campaign, earning the nickname &quot;The Ecuadorian DeLorean&quot;, and ultimately contributing 12 goals and 7 assists, for which he was named JetBlue Team MVP, Players&#x27; Player of the Year, and won the club&#x27;s Golden Boot Award, in addition to being named Midnight Riders Man of the Year.
The team&#x27;s form dropped off considerably during the second half of the season. Following a 3–2 win over DC United in match week 17, the Revolution would only record three more wins on the season, losing nine and drawing five. During the months of July and August, the team would not win a single game, taking only 2 points from 8 matches. The team would ultimately finish in 8th place in the eastern conference, 9 points out of a playoff spot.

=== Bruce Arena era (2019–2023) ===


Despite adding eventual MLS 2019 Newcomer of the Year Carles Gil and 1st round draft pick Tajon Buchanan in the 2019 pre-season, the former for a then-club record fee of $2 million, the 2019 season opened poorly. Exiting match week 12, which featured a 6–0 loss to the Chicago Fire, the Revolution had earned only 8 points on the season, and had conceded 18 goals in their last four matches.

On May 9, 2019, coach Brad Friedel was fired by the Revolution after a 12–21–13 career record and a 2–8–2 record to open the 2019 season. Four days later on May 13, the Revolution announced the dismissal of General Manager Mike Burns. The following day, the club announced that former D.C. United, LA Galaxy and USMNT coach Bruce Arena would serve as both head coach and sporting director. Under Arena, the Revolution, who were at that point in last place in the Eastern Conference, went eleven games undefeated until losing 2–0 to the Los Angeles FC on August 3, 2019. Following that defeat, the Revolution closed out the season only losing two more matches on a 2-2-6 run, and qualifying for the playoffs for the first time since 2015. The summer transfer window marked the arrival of Arena&#x27;s first Revolution signing, Argentine striker Gustavo Bou, for a club-record fee reportedly in the range of $6–7 million, from Club Tijuana. Bou played a crucial role in the second half of the 2019 season, making 14 appearances, scoring 9 goals, and adding two assists.

After concluding the 2019 regular season with a 3–1 loss to Atlanta United FC, The Revolution would be eliminated in the 1st Round of the 2019 Playoffs by Atlanta United FC, getting shut out 1–0.

Arena&#x27;s Revolution entered the 2020 season as presumed playoff contenders. Pre-season, Arena strengthened the squad, adding Polish striker Adam Buksa for $4.5m as a Designated Player, and former Manchester United defender Alexander Büttner. Though the Revolution were beginning a season with three Designated Players for the first time in their history, results in the COVID-19-shortened 23 match season were inconsistent, with the club losing Carles Gil to an Achilles injury for all but 6 matches, the team struggled to create chances, and additionally struggled to hold on to leads, winning just two matches at home.

When play was suspended in early March due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Revolution were winless on the season. The club recorded the first win of its campaign in the MLS is Back Tournament group stage, where it ultimately finished 2nd and advanced to the round of 16, losing to Philadelphia Union 1–0 on a 63rd-minute goal from Sérgio Santos.

The Revolution were able to leave their 2020 regular season inconsistencies behind them as they entered the 2020 MLS Cup Playoffs. Fielding all three of their Designated Players, the Revolution defeated the Montreal Impact 2–1 in the tournament&#x27;s play in round, thanks to a 38th-minute goal from Carles Gil and a 2nd half goal by Gustavo Bou 5 minutes into stoppage time. Four days later, the Revolution would travel to Subaru Park to play the Supporter&#x27;s Shield-holding, first-playoff-seeded, Philadelphia Union. Behind goals from Adam Buksa and Tajon Buchanan, the Revolution would advance 2–0 to the Eastern Conference semi finals, where they would go on the road to play Orlando City SC. The win over Philadelphia marked the third time in franchise history in which the Revolution had defeated the top seed in the playoffs. It was additionally their first victory over Philadelphia in 6 matches. A brace from Gustavo Bou, a 17th-minute penalty from Carles Gil, and a penalty save from Matt Turner against Nani would see New England past Orlando and into the Eastern Conference Finals for the first time in 7 years. Matt Turner, who would finish second in MLS Goalkeeper of the Year voting for 2020, made six saves in the Eastern Conference Final, but a 59th-minute goal from Artur would prove enough to knock the Revolution out of the playoffs, and they would ultimately lose 1–0 to the Columbus Crew, who would eventually win the MLS Cup 2020.

====2021: Supporters&#x27; Shield winners====

The 2021 season saw the Revolution win their first Supporters&#x27; Shield in club history by having the best record in the regular season. New England set a new MLS record for points in a season (73), surpassing the previous mark of 72 set by Los Angeles FC in 2019. Goalkeeper Matt Turner won the MLS Goalkeeper of the Year Award, becoming the first Revolution player to ever win the award. Over his 28 starts, he recorded a 1.25 goals-against average, a 73.2 save percentage, and five shutouts. Tajon Buchanan, Carles Gil, Gustavo Bou, and Turner were all named to the 2021 MLS All-Star roster. Turner was named 2021 MLS All-Star Game MVP after making two penalty saves against the Liga MX All stars on August 25, 2021. He also set a club record with 17 regular season wins, which was tied for the most in the league. Carles Gil won the MLS Most Valuable Player Award, in addition to leading the league in assists, with 18, and winning the MLS Comeback Player of the Year Award. Adam Buksa concluded his 2021 regular season with 16 goals, making him the 5th highest scorer in the 2021 MLS season. Gustavo Bou finished as the 9th highest scorer in the league with 15 goals and 9 assists.

As they&#x27;d finished in first place, the Revolution received a first round bye in the 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs. This bye, coinciding with an international break, meant the Revolution had a 23-day layoff between their final regular season game and their first playoff game. In that match, an Eastern Conference Semifinal matchup against New York City FC, the Revolution would lose in penalties to the club that would become the eventual 2021 MLS Cup champion ending their hopes to be the first MLS team to complete the league double (winning both the Supporters&#x27; Shield and MLS Cup) since 2017.

The franchise&#x27;s turnaround since May 2019 has been credited to head coach and sporting director Bruce Arena.

====2022 and Arena&#x27;s Departure====


As well as the 2021 offseason departure of Tajon Buchannan, the 2022 season saw the departure of key players Matt Turner and Adam Buksa, and the Revolution were unable to repeat the success of their 2021 campaign, finishing the season 10th place in the Eastern Conference with a 10–10–12 record, and losing in the quarterfinals of the 2022 CONCACAF Champions League to Pumas UNAM despite winning the first leg of the tie 3–0.

The club would return to form in 2023, buoyed by the play of Đorđe Petrović, who would be sold to Chelsea F.C. in August for a reported £12.5 million, plus £1.5 million in add-ons.

On August 1, 2023, with the club in sole possession of 2nd place in the Eastern Conference, The Revolution released a statement that Bruce Arena had been suspended due to &quot;reports of inappropriate and insensitive remarks.&quot; On September 9, 2023, the Bruce Arena era would end after Arena&#x27;s resignation following a six-week investigation. In a club statement, The Revolution announced that Richie Williams would continue to serve as interim coach until the end of the 2023 season, with Curt Onalfo continuing to serve as interim Sporting Director. Three days later on September 12, the team announced that Clint Peay would be replacing Williams as interim manager. Assistant coaches Shalrie Joseph and Dave van den Bergh were additionally released by the club. During Peay&#x27;s tenure the Revolution would finish out the regular season with 2 wins, 1 draw, and 4 defeats, finishing 5th in the Eastern Conference and dropping both matches in the first round of the 2023 MLS Cup Playoffs to the Philadelphia Union 3–1 and 1–0. Although on-field results suffered after Arena&#x27;s suspension, fan support remained strong. The attendance for the regular season finale, a 2–1 win over the Philadelphia Union, was 41,355. That figure marked the second-highest ever for a regular-season Revolution match, and the third-highest figure in single-match Revolution attendance history (behind the 2002 MLS Cup and the 2015 final regular season match). It would also help bump the single-season average home attendance for the Revolution to 23,940, marking a new club record.

=== Caleb Porter era (2024–present) ===
The club elevated Curt Onalfo from interim to full time Sporting Director on November 30, 2023, and on December 19, 2023, announced that it had appointed Caleb Porter as its new head coach. Entering the 2024 season, pundits believed the Revolution would be a playoff contender. Porter would add three players in the offseason; acquiring defenders Nick Lima and Jonathan Mensah as well as goalkeeper Henrich Ravas. These additions would join Designated Player Tomás Chancalay, who the Revolution purchased for $3.1m in November following his loan to the club in the 2023 Summer Transfer Window. The 2023-24 offseason also saw the departure of Gustavo Bou, who would conclude his Revolution career with 48 goals and 21 assists in 108 league appearances over four seasons. The first win of the Porter era came on February 21, 2024, a 1–0 victory over C.A. Independiente de La Chorrera in the 2024 CONCACAF Champions Cup. The first league win came on April 6, a 1–0 home win against Charlotte FC. Three days later, the Revolution were eliminated from the Concacaf Champions Cup in the quarterfinals, losing 9–2 on aggregate to Club América. On April 27, in their match against Inter Miami CF and Lionel Messi, the Revolution set a new single-match attendance record of 65,612, beating the record set at the 2002 MLS Cup Final. The club concluded the 2024 season with an average attendance of 29,262, a club record high. On-field results were not a positive, as the club recorded the worst goal differential in the league (tied with San Jose), scored the fewest goals of any club in the league, and conceded the second-most goals of any club in the league. Following a four game winning streak in June, the Revolution managed to win only three more matches in the second half of the season, and were eliminated from post-season contention on October 5th with three matches left to play. The Revolution&#x27;s final match of the season gave them a chance to defend their 2021 single-season points record, which was being challenged by their opponent, Inter Miami. Miami would break the record with a win over the Revolution. The Revs jumped out to a 2–0 lead, but conceded six straight unanswered goals, losing 6–2 and allowing Miami to set a new points record.

==Team colors and crest==
The original club badge was stylized and based on the flag of the United States with some of the stars made into a soccer ball (similar to Adidas&#x27; ball for the UEFA Champions League), composed of six stars, representing the six New England states (Connecticut, Maine, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Rhode Island, Vermont). The overall design mirrored the 1994 FIFA World Cup logo. The Revolution was the last founding team of the MLS to keep its original crest. In 2014, the flag and ball were retained while the name was dropped.

In 2021, the club launched its new logo. They enlisted an independent third-party to conduct focus groups consisting of Boston sports fans to elicit feedback about what the re-branded badge should represent. It features an &quot;R&quot; sitting above a red strikethrough. The inner shape references traditional flag drapery which plays homage to the original Revolution logo. The &quot;R&quot;&#x27;s font references the Boston Tea Party mark and American Revolutionary era lettering. Red details around the logo itself are reminiscent of patriotic bunting and the strikethrough behind the logo is meant to symbolize defiance.

===Uniforms===
Traditionally, the Revolution have worn all-navy at home, with the exception of red shorts during the club&#x27;s first year in 1996. From 2014 to 2020, the club wore white shorts at home. To mark the club and the league&#x27;s 25th anniversary, the red shorts returned for the 2020 and 2021 seasons. The Revolution wore white secondary uniforms for their entire existence until 2015; that year club introduced a red away jersey with white and green accents in tribute to the flag of New England, and away uniforms demonstrated more design variation from there. The following is a partial list of kits worn by the Revolution.

==Stadium==
The Revolution play home matches at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough, Massachusetts. At its inception, the Revolution played their games at Foxboro Stadium, alongside the American football team New England Patriots of the National Football League (NFL). In 2002, Robert Kraft financed a $350-million project as a replacement for Foxboro Stadium which would come to be known as Gillette Stadium. In 2007, Kraft began to develop the land around Gillette Stadium, creating a $375-million open-air shopping and entertainment center called Patriot Place.

Gillette Stadium is a 66,000-seat stadium including luxury and box seating. The Revolution artificially limit the stadium&#x27;s capacity for MLS matches, with certain seating sections covered with tarpaulins, or made inaccessible. However, the club does open the entire stadium for international matches and MLS Playoffs. On October 20, 2002, during the 2002 MLS Cup final a record was established when a crowd of 61,316 attended a Revolution 1–0 loss against the Los Angeles Galaxy. This was the largest stand-alone MLS post-season crowd on record until the 2018 MLS Cup in Atlanta at Mercedes-Benz Stadium.

Although the Revolution have played on natural grass from 2002 to 2006, they currently play on FieldTurf which was upgraded in April 2014 to FieldTurf &quot;Revolution&quot; with &quot;VersaTile&quot; drainage system. Gillete Stadium&#x27;s FieldTurf surface was certified by FIFA with a two-star quality rating, the highest possible rating. Kraft, however, announced that he would be willing to switch the stadium to a natural grass playing field as part of his stadium bid for 2026 FIFA World Cup.

Kraft opened a new $35 million training center in 2019. The team&#x27;s training facilities and offices are located in the wetlands behind Gillette Stadium. Despite these new facilities, Kraft claimed that he was still committed to building a new soccer-specific stadium closer to the city limits of Boston.

===Plans for a soccer-specific stadium===

On June 14, 2006, Major League Soccer announced via press release that the MLS Commissioner&#x27;s Office would begin working with the Kraft Family to identify sites on which a soccer-specific stadium for the Revolution could be built.

On August 2, 2007, &quot;The Boston Herald&quot; reported that the city of Somerville and Revolution officials had held preliminary discussions about building a 50,000 to 55,000-seat stadium on a site off of Innerbelt Road near Interstate 93 In the Inner Belt / Brickbottom area. The stadium could cost anywhere between $50 and $200 million based on other similar MLS soccer-specific stadiums.

Additionally in 2007, then-Boston mayor Tom Menino wrote to MLS suggesting Roxbury, Boston&#x27;s &quot;Parcel 3,&quot; across from Boston Police Headquarters, be considered as a spot for a Revolution stadium. However, according to a 2007 &quot;Boston Globe&quot; editorial, the task force promised to investigate the site was never formed.

In a July 2010 interview, Kraft said that over $1 million had been invested in finding a suitable site, preferably in the urban core.

After a two-year hiatus, the Revolution renewed their plans to build a stadium in Somerville since the Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority finalized its Green Line maintenance facility plans. The team was this time focused on Assembly Row, and Somerville mayor Joseph Curtatone confirmed to the &quot;Somerville Journal&quot; that he&#x27;d been in contact with the team for months regarding the site.

In 2012, Revere Mayor Dan Rizzo expressed an interest in the Revolution building a stadium in Revere. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported on October 1, 2012, that the Revolution had held talks with the Mayor regarding building a stadium at the Wonderland Greyhound Park property if the city was able to acquire it as part of casino negotiations surrounding Suffolk Downs. Revere eventually lost the casino bid to Everett.

On October 16, 2012, Fall River, Massachusetts Mayor William Flanagan wrote a letter to Kraft pitching Fall River as a potential site for a Revolution, focusing on the city&#x27;s &quot;strong soccer culture,&quot; Flanagan invited Kraft to take a tour. Revolution spokesman Jeff Cournoyer stated to &quot;The Enterprise&quot; regarding the proposal that &quot;there has been significant interest and we&#x27;ve been contacted by several communities. We will continue to vet all opportunities.&quot;

On July 1, 2014, WPRI-TV reported that then-Providence Mayor Angel Taveras confirmed that the city had preliminary discussions with officials from the Revolution surrounding a stadium, and that then-Central Falls Mayor James Diossa had spoken to president Brian Bilello about a move to Central Falls.

On November 18, 2014, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that the Kraft family had met with city and state officials over a stadium in South Boston on a public lot off Interstate 93 on Frontage Road near Widett Circle. The proposed site is adjacent to an industrial site that has been identified for the main Olympic stadium by the organizing group for Boston&#x27;s now-failed bid to host the 2024 Summer Olympics, of which Robert Kraft was a member.

On April 28, 2017, &quot;Associated Press&quot; reported that talks between the Kraft Group and University of Massachusetts Boston over a proposed stadium location in Dorchester, Boston at South Boston&#x27;s Bayside Expo Center had ended. Talks had been ongoing since June 2016, but politicians were concerned over the rise in traffic a stadium would bring.

In 2019, &quot;The Providence Journal&quot; reported that 2017 conversations between Jonathan Kraft and then-Rhode Island governor Gina Raimondo led to Rhode Island&#x27;s Commerce Corporation assigning Boston design firm Utile to find suitable spots for a Revolution stadium in Rhode Island. The group ultimately identified The &quot;Tockwotton&quot; waterfront in East Providence, Rhode Island, The Port of Providence waterfront off Allens Avenue, The &quot;Tidewater&quot; property on the Seekonk River in Pawtucket, and The Apex building site near Slater Mill Historic Site as suitable.

On March 17, 2022, &quot;Boston.com&quot; reported that the Revolution may be interested in building a stadium at the site of the old Mystic Generating Station in Everett, Massachusetts, next to Encore Boston Harbor casino, after its acquisition by Wynn Resorts. On July 15, 2022, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported that The Massachusetts House of Representatives had passed legislation that could potentially allow the Revolution to build a stadium on said property by exempting the 43-acre parcel of land from environmental requirements. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; reported on August 1, 2022, that the bill containing this legislation did not pass.

On November 14, 2023, it was announced that language removing 43.11 acres of land on Alford Street in Everett, Massachusetts from the Mystic River designated port area &quot;for the purpose of converting the parcel into a professional soccer stadium and a waterfront park&quot; had been included in a supplemental budget released by the Massachusetts Senate the previous day. Though the wording was removed from the final Supplemental Budget, State Senator Sal DiDomenico would introduce a bill with the same intent on December 21, 2023. On April 2, 2024, a public hearing was held with the Massachusetts Legislature&#x27;s Joint Committee on Economic Development and Emerging Technologies and New England Revolution officials to discuss the stadium plans. Renderings of the potential stadium were presented by the team. At the end of the formal session in 2024, the measure died due to lack of House-Senate agreement on a broader economic development bill (the House version of which did not include the stadium provision).

On November 12, 2024, Massachusetts legislature announced that a provision stipulating the removal of the Everett 43-acre parcel of land&#x27;s &quot;Designated Port Area&quot; distinction had been included in the economic development bond bill.

==Player development==
===Reserves===
On October 9, 2019, the club announced the formation of a reserve team, New England Revolution II, in USL League One that would begin play in the 2020 season and that they would play at Gillette Stadium in Foxborough. On November 25, 2019, the club announced its first manager, Clint Peay.

The club announced on December 6, 2021, that it was joining the inaugural 21-team MLS Next Pro season starting in 2022.

===Academy system===
The New England Revolution Academy is an elite youth development program fully-funded by the senior club and recognized by U.S. Soccer as one of the top 10 youth development programs in the country. Competing in MLS Next, a successor to the U.S. Soccer Development Academy, the Revolution Academy provides local players throughout Greater Boston and beyond (regardless of their financial situation) a pathway to a professional career.

All Revolution youth team home matches are played at Gillette Stadium. However, due to scheduling conflicts, some home matches in the past have been hosted at the B.M.C. Durfee High School in Fall River, Massachusetts, and the Fruit Street Fields (located in Hopkinton, Massachusetts).

Since 2010 when Diego Fagúndez became the Revolution&#x27;s first ever MLS Homegrown Player Rule signing, the Revolution have promoted several other youth prospects from their academy team, including Scott Caldwell, Zachary Herivaux, Justin Rennicks, Noel Buck, Esmir Bajraktarević, and Damian Rivera.

==Club culture==

===Supporters===
The team&#x27;s supporter&#x27;s clubs are called the &quot;Midnight Riders&quot; and &quot;The Rebellion&quot;. The name &#x27;Midnight Riders&#x27; is in honor of the famous rides of Paul Revere and William Dawes, who announced the departure of British troops from Boston to Concord at the beginning of the American Revolution. The two groups together occupy the north stand of the stadium, which they have nicknamed &quot;The Fort&quot;. The Fort is a general admission section and draws its name from the revolutionary theme which runs through the team supporters. In the same theme, the Revolution also employ a corps known as the End Zone Militia, a group of American Revolutionary War reenactors founded in 1996 by Geoff Campbell. The reenactors wear authentic 18th century clothing including the iconic colonial tricorn hat, and carry flintlock black gunpowder muskets which are ceremoniously fired when the Revolution score a goal.

===Rivalries===

The club&#x27;s main rival is widely considered to be New York Red Bulls, due to the rivalry stemming from other Boston–New York rivalries in other professional sports such as the Knicks–Celtics rivalry in the NBA, the Jets–Patriots rivalry in the NFL and the Yankees-Red Sox rivalry in Major League Baseball. Beginning in 2002, the Revs had a 20 match undefeated streak against the Red Bulls for games at Gillette Stadium. This streak helped to intensify the rivalry between the teams. The streak came to an end on June 8, 2014, as the Red Bulls won 2–0 at Gillette Stadium.

The Revolution have also built rivalries with fellow Eastern Conference teams D.C. United and Chicago Fire. These teams have faced each other on numerous occasions in the playoffs. In a 2009 poll on the club&#x27;s official site, New England fans considered the Chicago Fire the Revs&#x27; most bitter rival as the clubs have clashed many times in the MLS playoffs and regular season.

Since 2015 a rivalry has also developed with newcomer club New York City FC, due to the latter club&#x27;s association with the Yankees and with Yankee Stadium being the club&#x27;s incumbent home ground. To further fuel this rivalry, New York City FC knocked out the Revolution in the eastern conference semifinals of the 2021 MLS Cup Playoffs in a 2–2 tie that eventually went to penalties, despite the Revolution having the superior regular season record that year.

==Broadcasting==

From 2021 to 2022, all Revolution matches were televised locally in high definition on either WBZ-TV or WSBK-TV; nationally televised matches aired on ESPN, Fox Sports, and Univision. All matches are broadcast on radio by 98.5 The Sports Hub, but this is a simulcast of the TV feed. Brad Feldman served as the team&#x27;s longtime play-by-play on both TV and radio, with former Revolution and USMNT player Charlie Davies doing color commentary. Prior to 2021, matches were aired locally on NBC Sports Boston.
In 2023, MLS partnered with Apple to launch MLS Season Pass, which would broadcast every regular and postseason MLS game for the 2023 season. As of the 2023 season, Revolution games are broadcast almost exclusively on this service, with exceptions for certain national linear television broadcast partners.

===Head coaches===
The head coach is Caleb Porter, who was announced on December 19, 2023. Porter took over after a months-long vacancy in the head coaching position, which had been temporarily filled first by interim head coach Richie Williams, then by Clint Peay. Before that, Bruce Arena helmed the club from 2019 until resigning in 2023 as a result of an investigation into misconduct. Previously, Mike Lapper was the interim replacement for Brad Friedel, who was appointed the position in 2017 and subsequently fired in 2019. There have been eight permanent managers and six interim managers of the Revolution since the appointment of the club&#x27;s first professional manager, Frank Stapleton in 1996. The club&#x27;s longest-serving head coach, in terms of both length of tenure and number of games overseen, is Steve Nicol, who managed the club between 2002 and 2011.

<doc id="245712" wikidata="Q421009" url="?curid=245712" title="Tampa Bay Mutiny">
<text>The Tampa Bay Mutiny were an American professional soccer team based in Tampa, Florida. The club competed in Major League Soccer (MLS) as a member of the Eastern Conference. The Mutiny were a charter member of MLS, playing from 1996 to 2001. The team played its home games at Tampa Stadium and then at Raymond James Stadium.

The Mutiny were established in 1994 and were owned and operated by MLS throughout its entire existence. The team was successful in their first years of play, winning the first MLS Supporters&#x27; Shield behind MLS MVP Carlos Valderrama and high-scoring forward Roy Lassiter, whose 27 goals in 1996 remained the MLS single-season record until 2018. However, in subsequent years, dropping attendance and revenues became problems, especially as the team&#x27;s on-field success declined and the lease at its second home field of Raymond James Stadium removed sources of gameday revenues. Owing to these issues, MLS attempted without success to find a local ownership group to take over operations from the league, and both the Mutiny and the league&#x27;s other Florida-based team, the Miami Fusion, were folded before the 2002 season.

==History==
In 1994, newly established Major League Soccer announced it would place one of its charter franchises in the Tampa Bay Area. The region was seen as a potentially fertile market for soccer due to the success of the Tampa Bay Rowdies in the old North American Soccer League in the 1970s and 1980s. The Mutiny took the field in 1996 when MLS began play. While the Mutiny had no direct connection to the Rowdies franchise, the Mutiny occasionally paid tribute to its predecessor by wearing green and gold alternative kits, once wearing both the Mutiny and Rowdies logos on the same shirt.

The Mutiny were owned and operated by MLS along with two other teams, the Dallas Burn and the San Jose Clash, with the league hoping eventually sell the franchises to private local owners. The team managed strong signings in 1995, including Carlos Valderrama, Roy Lassiter, and Martín Vásquez. They were successful in their first two years, particularly in 1996, when they won the first Supporters&#x27; Shield with the best regular-season finish behind Most Valuable Player Carlos Valderrama and Golden Boot winner Roy Lassiter.

On April 13, 1996, the Mutiny played their inaugural game against the New England Revolution, winning 3–2. Led by manager Thomas Rongen and Roy Lassiter, who scored a record 27 goals in the season, the Mutiny claimed the best record in the league at 20–12 and were the first winners (retroactively) of the Supporters&#x27; Shield. In the playoffs, they beat the Columbus Crew before losing in the conference final to eventual champions D.C. United.

In 1997, Thomas Rongen took over the New England Revolution, and was replaced by John Kowalski. Under him, the Mutiny finished the season with a record of 17–15, but were swept in the playoffs by the Columbus Crew. After the season, Kowalski resigned from the club. 1998 saw Tim Hankinson join the club as the new manager while star player Carlos Valderrama joined new MLS side Miami Fusion. As a result, the Mutiny would struggle through the season, finishing with a record of 12–20, missing the playoffs for the first time.

In 1999, the Mutiny reacquired Valderrama. Despite this, they struggled, being swept by the Columbus Crew in the first round of the playoffs, which they qualified for despite having a losing record. In the 2000 season, the Mutiny finished with a 16–12–4 record after rebounding from a poor start to the campaign. However, they were swept by the Los Angeles Galaxy in the first round of the playoffs. In 2001, Tim Hankinson was fired, but struggles continued with successors Alfonso Mondelo and Perry Van der Beck. Mondelo was fired midseason, and neither manager could revive the struggling franchise. On September 4, the Mutiny lost 2–1 to the Columbus Crew in what would be their last ever match. They managed just four wins and two draws, recording 21 losses over the course of the campaign. 

The city of Tampa demolished Tampa Stadium in 1998, and the Mutiny moved to new Raymond James Stadium for the 1999 season with a much less favorable lease. The club was hampered by declining attendance and low revenues which were exacerbated by a lease agreement that transferred most match day revenue to the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, resulting in an inability to secure a local ownership group. In 2001, the Mutiny had the worst record in MLS with only four wins in twenty-seven matches on the season and drew an average attendance of under 11,000 per game, among the league&#x27;s lowest. Faced with financial losses up to $2 million a year, MLS courted Malcolm Glazer and his family, owners of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers National Football League team, to purchase the Mutiny. The Glazers considered the deal but ultimately declined, leaving the league with no prospective owners willing to take over the team. MLS folded the Mutiny, as well as its other Florida-based team, the Miami Fusion, in 2002. The Glazers would purchase Manchester United in 2005.

While Major League Soccer has not had a team in the Tampa Bay area since the folding of the Mutiny, a preseason game on February 14, 2025 between the two current Florida teams Orlando City SC and Inter Miami CF at Raymond James Stadium was the first MLS game in the area since 2001.

<text>Yala (, Malay: Jala) is the southernmost Province (&quot;changwat&quot;) of Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from northwest clockwise) Songkhla, Pattani, and Narathiwat. Yala is one of two landlocked provinces in southern Thailand, the other being Phatthalung. Its southern part borders Kedah and Perak of Malaysia.

==Geography==
Yala province is in southern Thailand. The highest point of the Sankalakhiri Range (Northern Titiwangsa Mountains), the -high Ulu Titi Basah (ฮูลูติติปาซา), is on the Thai/Malaysian border between Yala province and Perak. The total forest area is or 32.5 percent of provincial area.
===National parks===
There are three national parks, along with two other national parks, make up region 6 (Pattani branch) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Budo–Su-ngai Padi National Park, 
* Bang Lang National Park, 
* Namtok Sai Khao National Park, 

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Yala&quot; is the Thai transliteration of the Malay word &quot;Jala&quot; (Jawi: جالا), meaning &quot;net&quot;, which was in turn derived from Sanskrit (Devanagari: जाल). The province is also known as &quot;Jala&quot; in Patani Malay language.

==History==

Historically, Pattani province was the centre of the Sultanate of Patani, a semi-independent Malay kingdom that paid tribute to the Thai kingdoms of Sukhothai and Ayutthaya. After Ayutthaya fell under Burmese control in 1767, the Sultanate of Patani gained full independence, but under King Rama I (reigned from 1782 to 1809), the area was again placed under Siam&#x27;s control in 1785 and made a &quot;mueang&quot;. In 1808, Mueang Pattani was split into seven smaller mueang including Yala and Reman.

The province was recognized as part of Siam by the Anglo-Siamese Treaty of 1909, negotiated with the British Empire, while Siam surrendered its claims to Kelantan, Kedah, Terengganu, and Perlis.

There is a separatist movement in Yala, which after being dormant for many years, emerged again in 2004 and has become increasingly violent. Eight bombs exploded in the province over two days, on 6–7 April 2014. The bombings resulted in one death and 28 injuries, as well as damage to a warehouse estimated at 100 million baht.

The British Foreign and Commonwealth Office (FCO) in 2014 advised its citizens to only undertake essential travel in the province, while the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade recommends that travellers completely avoid the province.

==Demographics==

Together with Narathiwat, Pattani and Satun, Yala is one of the four provinces of Thailand with a Muslim majority. About 72 percent of the people are Malay-speaking Muslims and mainly live in rural locations. The remainder are Thai and Thai Chinese Buddhists, who live in towns and cities.

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows a miner with simple mining tools including hoes, crowbars, and baskets. Yala was originally a mining town with tin and tungsten ores.

The provincial tree is the red saraca (&quot;Saraca declinata&quot;), and the provincial flower is the bullet wood (&quot;Mimusops elengi&quot;).

Khela mahseer (&quot;Tor douronensis&quot;) is the provincial fish, since it is a rare fish that can only be found in the lower southern region. Currently, Yala Provincial Fisheries Office is able to breed.

==Administrative divisions and provincial government==
Yala is divided into eight districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;), which are further divided into 56 subdistricts (&quot;tambon&quot;) and 341 villages (&quot;muban&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Yala Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 16 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Yala has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status and Sateng Nok and Betong have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 13 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 47 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations - SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Transportation==
In January 2022, Thailand&#x27;s transport ministry completed the 1.9 billion baht Betong Airport. It opened in March 2022. Designed to handle 300 arrivals per hour, it is projected to serve 300,000 per year, which will later increase to over one million passengers per year, generating three billion baht for the district. Nok Air, Bangkok Airways, and Malaysia&#x27;s Firefly Airlines had plans to fly to Betong in 2019. However, Nok Air was the only airline to operate flights to Betong; the service was terminated after 28 October 2022 due to high operational cost.

As of November 2024, Ezy Airlines had to operate a scheduled commercial flights from Betong to Hat Yai.

Yala is served by the State Railway of Thailand from the Yala Railway Station.

The province lies on Route 410 (Pattani–Betong Highway), which runs from Pattani through Yala and Betong before passing through the Thailand-Malaysia Border.

== Health ==
Yala&#x27;s main hospital is Yala Hospital, a regional hospital operated by the Ministry of Public Health.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>Erich Fritz Emil Mielke (; 28 December 1907 – 21 May 2000) was a German communist official who served as head of the East German Ministry for State Security (&quot;Ministerium für Staatsicherheit&quot; – MfS), better known as the Stasi, from 1957 until shortly after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. Dubbed &quot;The Master of Fear&quot; () by the West German press, Mielke was one of the most powerful, feared, and hated men in East Germany.

A working-class native of the Wedding slum district of Berlin and a second-generation member of the Communist Party of Germany, Mielke was one of two gunmen in the 1931 murders of Berlin Police captains Paul Anlauf and Franz Lenck. After learning that a witness had survived, Mielke escaped arrest by fleeing to the Soviet Union, where the NKVD recruited him. He was one of the key figures in the decimation of Moscow&#x27;s many German Communist refugees during the Great Purge as well as in the Red Terror; the witch-hunt by the Servicio de Información Militar for both real and imagined members of the anti-Stalinist Left within the International Brigade during the Spanish Civil War.

Following the end of World War II in 1945, Mielke returned to the Soviet Zone of Occupied Germany, which he helped organize into a Marxist–Leninist satellite state under the Socialist Unity Party (SED). The Stasi under Mielke has been called by historian Edward Peterson the &quot;most pervasive police state apparatus ever to exist on German soil&quot;. During the 1950s and 1960s, Mielke led the process of forcibly forming collectivised farms from East Germany&#x27;s family-owned farms, which sent a flood of refugees to West Germany. In response, Mielke oversaw the 1961 construction of the Berlin Wall and co-signed standing orders for the Border Guards to use lethal force against all East Germans who attempted to commit &quot;desertion of the Republic&quot;.

Throughout the Cold War, Mielke also oversaw the establishment of other pro-Soviet police states throughout the Third World. Mielke covertly trained and armed far-left guerrillas and militant organisations aimed at committing terrorist attacks and violent regime change in Western Europe, Latin America, Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. Due to his close ties to former dictator Mengistu Haile Mariam, John Koehler has accused Mielke and the Stasi military advisors he assigned to Ethiopia under the Derg of complicity in the Red Terror, genocide, and many other crimes against humanity. In addition to his role as head of the Stasi, Mielke was also an Army General in the National People&#x27;s Army ().

Mielke, who joined the SED&#x27;s ruling Politburo fairly late, was regarded as belonging to its pro-Moscow faction alongside Willi Stoph and Werner Krolikowski. During the later years of SED leader Erich Honecker&#x27;s rule, Mielke was part of the small clique of Politburo members who made all consequential decisions on their own, alongside Joachim Herrmann and Günter Mittag. He was instrumental in the removal of both major SED leaders Walter Ulbricht and Honecker, partly motivated by their respective transgressions of Soviet policies.

After German reunification in 1990, Mielke was prosecuted, convicted, and imprisoned for the 1931 policemen&#x27;s murders. A second murder trial for the 260 killings of defectors at the Inner German border was adjourned after Mielke was ruled not mentally competent to stand trial. Mielke was also charged, but never tried, with ordering two 1981 terrorist attacks by the Baader-Meinhof Group against United States military personnel in West Germany. Released from incarceration early due to ill health and senile dementia in 1995, Mielke died in a Berlin nursing home in 2000.

== Early life ==
Erich Mielke was born in a tenement in Berlin-Wedding, Brandenburg, on 28 December 1907. During the First World War, the neighborhood was known as &quot;Red Wedding&quot; due to many residents&#x27; Marxist militancy. In a handwritten biography written for the Soviet secret police, Mielke described his father as &quot;a poor, uneducated woodworker,&quot; and said that his mother died in 1911. Both were, he said, members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD). After his remarriage to &quot;a seamstress,&quot; the elder Mielke and his new wife joined the Independent Social Democratic Party of Germany and remained members when it was renamed the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). His son Erich claimed &quot;My younger brother Kurt and two sisters were Communist sympathisers.&quot;

Despite his family&#x27;s poverty, Mielke was sufficiently academically gifted to be awarded a free scholarship in the prestigious Köllnisches Gymnasium, but had to leave it a year later, for being &quot;unable to meet the great demands of this school.&quot; While attending the Gymnasium, Mielke joined the Communist Party of Germany in 1925, and worked as a reporter for the communist newspaper &quot;Rote Fahne&quot; from 1928 to 1931.

Under the Weimar Republic, the KPD was the largest communist party in Europe and was seen as the &quot;leading party&quot; of the communist movement outside the Soviet Union. Under Ernst Thälmann&#x27;s leadership, the KPD was completely obedient to Soviet General Secretary Joseph Stalin, and from 1928 the Party was both funded and controlled by the Comintern in Moscow.

Until the end of the Republic, the KPD viewed the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD), which dominated German politics between 1918 and 1931, as their mortal enemy. In keeping with Stalin&#x27;s policy towards social democracy, the KPD considered all SPD members to be &quot;social fascists&quot;. The KPD also believed that all other political parties were &quot;fascist&quot; and regarded itself as &quot;the only anti-fascist Party&quot; in Germany. Nevertheless, the KPD closely collaborated with the Nazi Party during the early 1930s and both Parties intended to replace the democratically elected government of the Weimar Republic with a totalitarian single party state.

Soon after joining the Party, Mielke joined the KPD&#x27;s paramilitary wing, or &quot;Parteiselbstschutz&quot; (&quot;Party Self Defense Unit&quot;). At the time, the &quot;Parteiselbstschutz&quot; in Berlin was commanded by KPD Reichstag Representatives Hans Kippenberger and Heinz Neumann.

According to John Koehler, &quot;Mielke was a special protege of Kippenberger&#x27;s having taken to his paramilitary training with the enthusiasm of a Prussian Junker. World War I veterans taught the novices how to handle pistols, rifles, machine guns, and hand grenades. This clandestine training was conducted in the sparsely populated, pastoral countryside surrounding Berlin. Mielke also pleased Kippenberger by being an exceptional student in classes on the arts of conspiratorial behavior and espionage, taught by comrades who had studied at the secret M-school of the GRU in Moscow.&quot;

According to John Koehler, members of the &quot;Parteiselbstschutz&quot; &quot;served as bouncers at Party meetings and specialized in cracking heads during street battles with political enemies.&quot; Besides the ruling SPD and its paramilitary Reichsbanner forces, the arch-enemies of the &quot;Parteiselbstschutz&quot; were the Stahlhelm, which was the armed wing of the Monarchist German National People&#x27;s Party (DVNP), Trotskyites, and &quot;radical nationalist parties.&quot;

According to Koehler, the KPD&#x27;s Selbstschutz men &quot;always carried a &quot;Stahlrute&quot;, two steel springs that telescoped into a tube seventeen centimeters long, which when extended became a deadly, 35-centimeter weapon. Not to be outdone by the Nazis, these street-fighters were often armed with pistols as well.&quot;

In a 1931 biography written for the Cadre Division of the Comintern, Mielke recalled, &quot;We took care of all kinds of work: terror acts, protecting illegal demonstrations and meetings, arms-trafficking, etc. The last work, which was accomplished by a Comrade and myself, was the Bülowplatz Affair&quot; ().

==Bülowplatz murders==
===Planning===
During the last days of the Weimar Republic, the KPD had a policy of assassinating two Berlin police officers in retaliation for every KPD member killed by the police.

On 2 August 1931, KPD Members of the Reichstag Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger received a dressing down from Walter Ulbricht, the Party&#x27;s leader in the Berlin-Brandenburg region. Enraged by police interference and by Neumann and Kippenberger&#x27;s failure to follow the policy, Ulbricht stated, &quot;At home in Saxony we would have done something about the police a long time ago. Here in Berlin we will not fool around much longer. Soon we will hit the police in the head.&quot;

Enraged by Ulbricht&#x27;s words, Kippenberger and Neumann decided to assassinate Paul Anlauf, the 42-year-old Captain of the Berlin Police&#x27;s Seventh Precinct. Captain Anlauf, a widower with three daughters, had been nicknamed &quot;Schweinebacke&quot;, or &quot;Pig Face&quot; by the KPD.

According to historian John Koehler, &quot;Of all the policemen in strife-torn Berlin, the reds hated Anlauf the most. His precinct included the area around KPD headquarters, which made it the most dangerous in the city. The captain almost always led the riot squads that broke up illegal rallies of the Communist Party.&quot;

On the morning of Sunday 9 August 1931, Kippenberger and Neumann gave a last briefing to the hit-team in a room at the Lassant beer hall. Mielke and Erich Ziemer were selected as the shooters. During the meeting, Max Matern gave a Luger pistol to fellow lookout Max Thunert and said, &quot;Now we&#x27;re getting serious. We&#x27;re going to give Schweinebacke something to remember us by.&quot;

Kippenberger then asked Mielke and Ziemer, &quot;Are you sure that you are ready to shoot Schweinebacke?&quot; Mielke responded that he had seen Anlauf many times during police searches of Party Headquarters. Kippenberger then instructed them to wait at a nearby beer hall which would permit them to overlook the entire Bülow-Platz. He further reminded them that Anlauf was accompanied everywhere by Senior Sergeant Max Willig, whom the KPD had nicknamed, &quot;Hussar&quot;.

Kippenberger concluded, &quot;When you spot Schweinebacke and Hussar, you take care of them.&quot; Mielke and Ziemer were informed that, after the assassinations were completed, a diversion would assist in their escape. They were then to return to their homes and await further instructions.

That evening, Anlauf was lured to Bülow-Platz by a violent rally demanding the dissolution of the Prussian Parliament.

According to Koehler, &quot;As was often the case when it came to battling the dominant SPD, the KPD and the Nazis had combined forces during the pre-plebiscite campaign. At one point in this particular campaign, Nazi propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels even shared a speaker&#x27;s platform with KPD agitator Walter Ulbricht. Both parties wanted the parliament dissolved because they were hoping that new elections would oust the SPD, the sworn enemy of all radicals. That fact explained why the atmosphere was particularly volatile this Sunday.&quot;

===Murder at the Babylon Cinema===

At eight o&#x27;clock that evening, Mielke and Ziemer waited in a doorway as Anlauf, Willig, and Captain Franz Lenck walked toward the Babylon Cinema, which was located at the corner of Bülowplatz and Kaiser-Wilhelm-Straße. As they reached the door of the movie house, the policemen heard someone scream, &quot;Schweinebacke!&quot;

As Anlauf turned toward the sound, Mielke and Ziemer opened fire at point blank range. Willig was wounded in the left arm and the stomach. However, he managed to draw his Luger pistol and fired a full magazine at the assailants. Lenck was shot in the chest and fell dead in front of the entrance. Willig crawled over and cradled the head of Anlauf, who was bleeding to death from two bullet wounds in his neck. Before Paul Anlauf died, Sergeant Willig heard the Captain gasp, () (&quot;So Long... Goodbye...&quot;).

Meanwhile, Mielke and Ziemer made their escape by running into the theater and out an emergency exit. They tossed their pistols over a fence, where they were later found by Homicide Detectives from the elite Mordkommission. Mielke and Ziemer then returned to their homes.

According to Koehler, &quot;Back at Bülowplatz, the killings had triggered a major police action. At least a thousand officers poured into the square, and a bloody street battle ensued. Rocks and bricks were hurled from the rooftops. Communist gunmen fired indiscriminately from the roofs of surrounding apartment houses. As darkness fell, police searchlights illuminated the buildings. Using megaphones, officers shouted, &quot;Clear the streets! Move away from the windows! We are returning fire!&quot; By now the rabble had fled the square, but shooting continued as riot squads combed the tenements, brutally beating and arresting hundreds of residents suspected of having fired weapons. The battle lasted until one o&#x27;clock the next morning. In addition to the two police officers, the casualties included one Communist who died of a gunshot wound and seventeen others who were seriously wounded.&quot;

Anlauf&#x27;s wife had died three weeks earlier of kidney failure. The murder of Anlauf thus left their three daughters as orphans. Their oldest daughter was forced to rush her planned wedding in order to keep her sisters from being put in an orphanage. Lenck was survived by his wife. Willig was hospitalized for 14 weeks, but made a full recovery and returned to active duty. In recognition for Willig&#x27;s courage, the Berlin Police promoted him to Lieutenant.

After the murders, the act was celebrated at the Lichtenberger Hof, a favorite beer hall of the Rotfrontkämpferbund, where Mielke boasted: &quot;Today we celebrate a job that I pulled!&quot; ()

===Fugitive===
According to Koehler, &quot;Kippenberger was alarmed when word reached him that Sergeant Willig had survived the shooting. Not knowing whether the sergeant could talk and identify the attackers, Kippenberger was taking no chances. He directed a runner to summon Mielke and Ziemer to his apartment at 74 Bellermannstrasse, only a few minutes walk from where the two lived. When the assassins arrived, Kippenberger told them the news and ordered them to leave Berlin at once. The parliamentarian&#x27;s wife, Thea, an unemployed schoolteacher and as staunch a Communist Party member as her husband, shepherded the young murderers to the Belgian border. Agents of the Communist International (Comintern) in the port city of Antwerp supplied them with money and forged passports. Aboard a merchant ship, they sailed for Leningrad. When their ship docked, they were met by another Comintern representative, who escorted them to Moscow.&quot;

Beginning in 1932, Mielke attended the Comintern&#x27;s Military Political school under the alias Paul Bach. He later graduated from the Lenin School shortly before being recruited into the OGPU.

===Trial===
According to Koehler, &quot;In mid-March 1933, while attending the Lenin School, Mielke received word from his OGPU sponsors that Berlin police had arrested Max Thunert, one of the conspirators in the Anlauf and Lenck murders. Within days, fifteen other members of the assassination team were in custody. Mielke had to wait six more months before the details of the police action against his Berlin comrades reached Moscow. On 14 September 1933, Berlin newspapers reported that all fifteen had confessed to their roles in the murders. Arrest warrants were issued for ten others who had fled, including Mielke, Ziemer, Ulbricht, Kippenberger, and Neumann.&quot;

On 19 June 1934, the 15 conspirators were convicted of murder. The three deemed most culpable, Michael Klause, Max Matern, and Friedrich Bröde were sentenced to death. Their co-defendants received sentences ranging from nine months to fifteen years incarceration at hard labor. Klause&#x27;s sentence was commuted to life in prison based upon his cooperation. Bröde hanged himself in his cell. As a result, only Matern was left to be executed by beheading on 22 May 1935.

Matern was subsequently glorified as a martyr by KPD and East German propaganda. Ziemer was officially killed in action while fighting on the Republican-side during the Spanish Civil War. Mielke, however, would not face trial for the murders until 1993.

== Career in Soviet intelligence ==

===The Great Terror===

Although Moscow&#x27;s German Communist community was decimated during Joseph Stalin&#x27;s Great Purge, Mielke survived and was promoted.

In a handwritten autobiography prepared after World War II, Mielke recalled, &quot;During my stay in the S.U. (Soviet Union), I participated in all Party discussions of the K.P.D. and also in the problems concerning the establishment of socialism and in the trials against the traitors and enemies of the S.U.&quot;

Among the German communists executed as a result of these &quot;discussions&quot; were Mielke&#x27;s former mentors Heinz Neumann and Hans Kippenberger.

Mielke further recalled, &quot;I was a guest on the honor grandstand of Red Square during the May Day and October Revolution parades. I became acquainted with many comrades of the Federation of World Communist Parties and the War Council of the Special Commission of the Comintern. I will never forget my meeting with Comrade Dimitrov, the Chairman of the Comintern, whom I served as an aide together with another comrade. I saw Comrade Stalin during all demonstrations at Red Square, especially when I stood on the grandstand. I mention these meetings because all these comrades are our models and teachers for our work.&quot;

During his time in the USSR, Mielke also developed a lifelong reverence for Felix Dzerzhinsky, the Polish aristocrat who founded the Soviet secret police. Mielke also began an equally permanent habit of calling himself a Chekist.

In a citation written decades later, Mielke described his philosophy of life, &quot;The Chekist is the political combatant. He is the loyal son of... the workers&#x27; class. He stands at the head of the battle to strengthen the power of our workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; state.&quot;

===Spanish Civil War===

From 1936 to 1939, Mielke served in Spain as an operative of the Servicio de Investigación Militar, the political police of the Second Spanish Republic. While attached to the staff of, &quot;veteran GRU agent,&quot; and future Stasi minister Wilhelm Zaisser, Mielke used the alias Fritz Leissner. Bernd Kaufmann, the director of the Stasi&#x27;s espionage school later said, &quot;The Soviets trusted Mielke implicitly. He earned his spurs in Spain.&quot;

At the time, the S.I.M. was heavily staffed by agents of the Soviet NKVD, whose Spanish rezident was General Aleksandr Mikhailovich Orlov. According to author Donald Rayfield, &quot;Stalin, Yezhov, and Beria distrusted Soviet participants in the Spanish war. Military advisors like Vladimir Antonov-Ovseenko, journalists like Koltsov were open to infection by the heresies, especially Trotsky&#x27;s, prevalent among the Republic&#x27;s supporters. NKVD agents sent to Spain were therefore keener on abducting and murdering anti-Stalinists among Republican leaders and International Brigade commanders than on fighting Franco. The defeat of the Republic, in Stalin&#x27;s eyes, was caused not by the NKVD&#x27;s diversionary efforts, but by the treachery of the heretics.&quot;

In a 1991 interview, Walter Janka, a fellow German communist exile and company commander in the International Brigade, recalled his encounters with Mielke. During the winter of 1936, Janka was summoned by the SIM and interrogated by Mielke. Mielke demanded to know why Janka had voluntarily traveled to Spain rather than being assigned there by the Party. When he told Mielke to get lost, the SIM demoted Janka to the ranks and then expelled him from the International Brigade. Years later, Janka recalled, &quot;While I was fighting at the front, shooting at the Fascists, Mielke served in the rear, shooting Trotskyites and Anarchists.&quot;

Upon the defeat of the Spanish Republic, Mielke fled across the Pyrenees Mountains to the Third French Republic, which interned him at Camp de Rivesaltes, Pyrénées-Orientales. Mielke, however, managed to send a message to exiled KPD members and, in May 1939, he escaped to Belgium. Although the Public Prosecutor of Berlin learned of Mielke&#x27;s presence and filed for his extradition, the Belgian Government refused to comply, regarding the assassinations of Captains Anlauf and Lenck as &quot;a political crime.&quot;

Both the Spanish Red Terror and the NKVD and the SIM&#x27;s witch hunt for both real and imagined anti-Stalinists, however, had deadly serious political consequences. They horrified numerous formerly pro-Soviet Westerners who had been witnesses, including John Dos Passos, Arthur Koestler and George Orwell, and caused them to permanently turn against the U.S.S.R.

Mielke&#x27;s belief in Stalin&#x27;s official explanation for the defeat, that anti-Stalinists had stabbed the Spanish Republic in the back, continued to shape his attitudes for the rest of his life. In a 1982 speech before a group of senior Stasi officers, Mielke said, &quot;We are not immune from villains among us. If I knew of any already, they wouldn&#x27;t live past tomorrow. Short shrift. It&#x27;s because I&#x27;m a Humanist, that I&#x27;m of this view.&quot;

In the same speech, Mielke also said, &quot;All this blithering over to execute or not to execute, for the death penalty or against—all rot, Comrades. Execute! And, when necessary, without a court judgment.&quot;

===World War II===

During World War II, Mielke&#x27;s movements remain mysterious. In a biography written after the war, he claimed to have infiltrated Organisation Todt under the alias Richard Hebel. Historian John O. Koehler considers this unlikely, but notes that Mielke&#x27;s real exploits &quot;must have been substantial. By war&#x27;s end, he had been decorated with the Order of the Red Banner, the Order of the Great Patriotic War First Class, and twice with the Order of Lenin. It is likely that he served as an NKVD agent, at least part of the time with guerrilla units behind German lines, for he knew all the partisan songs by heart and sang them in faultless Russian.&quot;

==Occupied Germany==

=== &quot;Komissariat-5&quot; ===
On 25 April 1945, Mielke returned to the Soviet Zone of Occupied Germany aboard a special Soviet aircraft that also carried fellow German Communists Walter Ulbricht, Wilhelm Zaisser, Ernst Wollweber, and many of the future leaders of East Germany.

That same month, Mielke&#x27;s future handler, NKGB General Ivan Serov, travelled to Germany from Warsaw and, from his headquarters in the Berlin suburb of Karlshorst, divided the Soviet Zone into &quot;Operative Sectors.&quot;

On 10 July 1945, Marshal Georgy Zhukov signed SMA Order No. 2, which legalized the re-establishment of &quot;anti-fascist&quot; political parties like the Communist Party of Germany (KPD). On 15 July 1945, Mielke walked into the KPD&#x27;s headquarters and volunteered his services.

In an autobiography written for the KPD, Mielke disclosed—truthfully—his involvement in the 1931 murders of Berlin Police Captains Anlauf and Lenck, and—mistakenly or misleadingly—that for this he had been tried &quot;in absentia&quot;, found guilty, and sentenced to death. In actuality, Mielke&#x27;s &quot;name was mentioned in the 1934 trials but he was never tried&quot;. He admitted—truthfully—fighting on the Republican side during the Spanish Civil War, but claimed—falsely—that he had been released from the French internment camps and had worked in Belgium for an underground Communist newspaper under the code name &quot;Gaston&quot;. Furthermore, Mielke concealed his past and contemporaneous involvement with the NKVD, NKGB, and the Nazi Organisation Todt (which he asserted he&#x27;d infiltrated).

According to Koehler, &quot;As might be expected, Mielke&#x27;s account of his past was approved by the Soviets. Had Serov not been part of the conspiracy, Mielke would have been instantly arrested or at least subjected to an intense internal investigation because of his membership in the Nazi Organisation Todt, which used thousands of slave laborers. But he was cleared in record time and by the end of June the Soviets had installed him as a station commander of the newly formed &quot;Volkspolizei&quot; (Vopo), the People&#x27;s Police.&quot;

On 16 August 1947, Serov ordered the creation of &quot;Kommissariat 5&quot;, the first German political police since the defeat of Nazi Germany.

According to Anne Applebaum, however, not everyone approved of the plan. In Moscow, Soviet Interior Minister Viktor Abakumov argued that a new secret police force would be demonized by Western governments and the media, which would paint the K-5 as a &quot;new Gestapo.&quot; Furthermore, Abakumov, like Stalin, intensely distrusted German Communists and alleged that there &quot;were not enough German cadres who have been thoroughly checked.&quot; Notwithstanding Abakumov&#x27;s objections, however, recruitment into the K-5 began almost immediately. It is possible, as Norman Naimark suspects, that the NKGB had realized that their officers&#x27; lack of fluency in the German language was engendering massive popular resentment.

Wilhelm Zaisser, who had been Mielke&#x27;s commanding officer in Republican Spain, was appointed the K-5&#x27;s head. Mielke was installed as his deputy.

According to John Koehler, &quot;The K-5 was essentially an arm of the Soviet secret police. Its agents were carefully selected veteran German communists who had survived the Nazi-era in Soviet exile or in concentration camps and prisons. Their task was to track down Nazis and anti-communists, including hundreds of members of the Social Democratic Party. Mielke and his fellow bloodhounds performed this task with ruthless precision. The number of arrests became so great that the regular prisons could not hold them. Thus, Serov ordered the establishment or re-opening of eleven concentration camps, including the former Nazi death camps of Buchenwald and Sachsenhausen.&quot;

According to Anne Applebaum, &quot;One of the few documents from that era to survive (most were removed by the KGB or perhaps destroyed, in 1989 or before) mentions a departmental training meeting and included a list of attendees. Topping the list is a group of Soviet advisers. In this sense, K-5 did resemble the political police in the rest of Eastern Europe: as in Hungary, Poland, and the USSR itself, this new political police force was initially extra-governmental, operating outside the ordinary rule of law.&quot;

According to Edward N. Peterson, &quot;Not surprisingly, K-5 acquired a reputation as bad as that of Stalin&#x27;s secret police and worse than that of the Gestapo. At least with the Nazis, albeit fanatically racist, their victims did not suddenly disappear into the GULAG.&quot;

===The Amalgamation===

Despite the K-5&#x27;s mass arrests of members of the Social Democratic Party of Germany (SPD) in the Soviet Zone, the number of SPD members continued to grow. By March 1946, SPD members outnumbered KPD members by more than 100,000. Fearing that they would lose the elections scheduled for the autumn, the leadership of the KPD asked for and received Stalin&#x27;s permission to merge the two parties. When the SPD&#x27;s leadership agreed only to schedule a vote for the rank and file to decide, permission was denied by the Soviet occupation authorities. The K-5 then began mass arrests of SPD members who refused to support the merger.

On 22 April 1946, the remaining leaders of the SPD in the Soviet Zone announced that they had united with the KPD to form the Socialist Unity Party of Germany (SED). The SPD in the western zones of Occupied Germany responded by forming the SPD East Bureau in order to support and finance those Social Democrats who refused to accept the merger. Those who joined or worked with the East Bureau were, however, in serious danger of arrest by the K-5 and trial by Soviet military tribunals. By 1950, more than 5,000 SPD members and sympathisers had been imprisoned in the Soviet Zone or transferred to the GULAG. More than 400 were either executed or died during their imprisonments.

John Koehler has written that, prior to the spring of 1946, many Germans in the Soviet Zone, &quot;merely shrugged at the wave of arrests, believing that the victims were former Nazi officials and war criminals.&quot; But then came the mass arrests of Social Democrats who opposed the merger, who, &quot;were joined by people who had been denounced for making anti-communist or anti-Soviet remarks, among their number hundreds who were as young as fourteen years. Although these arrests were made by Germans purporting to be officials of the criminal police, the existence of the K-5 political police eventually was exposed. Mielke, meanwhile, had risen to the post of vice-president of the German Administration for Interior Affairs – the equivalent of the NKVD – and continued his manipulations from behind the scenes.&quot;

===Investigation===

In January 1947, two retired Berlin policemen recognized Mielke at an official function. Informing the head of the criminal police in West Berlin, the policemen demanded that Mielke be arrested and prosecuted for the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. Wilhelm Kühnast, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin, was immediately informed and ordered a search of the Kammergericht archives. To his astonishment, the files of the 1931 murders had survived the wartime bombing of Germany. Finding ample evidence of Mielke&#x27;s involvement, Kühnast ordered the arrest of the communist policeman.

According to John Koehler, &quot;At that time, the city administration, including the police, was under the control of the Allied Control Commission, which consisted of U.S., British, French, and Soviet military officers. All actions by city officials, including the judiciary, were to be reported to the Commission. The Soviet representative alerted the MGB. Action was swift. Marshal Vasily Sokolovsky, who had replaced Zhukov, protested, and his representatives at the Commission launched a vicious campaign to discredit Kühnast.&quot;

The Soviet representatives falsely claimed that Kühnast, a jurist with an impeccable anti-Nazi record, had been an official of Roland Freisler&#x27;s People&#x27;s Court. Taking the Soviets at their word, the Western Allies removed Kühnast from his position and placed him under house arrest. During the Berlin airlift, Kühnast fled from his home in East Berlin and was granted political asylum in the American Zone.

Meanwhile, the Soviet authorities confiscated all documents relating to the murders of Captains Anlauf and Lenck. According to Koehler, &quot;The Soviets handed the court records to Mielke. Instead of destroying the incriminating papers, he locked them in his private safe, where they were found when his home was searched in 1990. They were used against him in his trial for murder.&quot;

=== &quot;Deutsche Wirtschaftskommission&quot; ===
In 1948, Mielke was appointed as security chief of the German Economic Commission (), the precursor to the future East German government.

Mielke&#x27;s task was to investigate the theft and sale of state property on the black market. He was also charged with intercepting the growing number of refugees fleeing to the French, British, and American Zones.

Those caught by Mielke&#x27;s security forces while attempting to defect were used as slave labor in the uranium mines that were providing raw material for the Soviet atomic bomb project.

==German Democratic Republic==
===Independence===
In 1949, the Soviet Military Administration ceded its legal functions to the newly created German Democratic Republic.

On 14 January 1950, Marshal Vasili Chuikov announced that all Soviet &quot;internment camps&quot; on German soil had been closed. Soon after, the DWK was absorbed into the newly created Ministry for State Security. In keeping with earlier syllabic abbreviations along the same lines (see OrPo, KriPo, and GeStaPo) East Germans immediately dubbed it the &quot;Stasi&quot; (from Staatssicherheit). With the approval of the Soviets, Mielke&#x27;s commanding officer from Spain and in the K5, Wilhelm Zaisser, was appointed as the Stasi&#x27;s head. Mielke was appointed to his staff with the rank of State Secretary. Mielke was also granted a seat in the SED&#x27;s ruling Politburo.

According to John Koehler, &quot;In the five years since the end of World War II, the Soviets and their vassals had arrested between 170,000 and 180,000 Germans. Some 160,000 had passed through the concentration camps, and of these about 65,000 had died, 36,000 had been shipped to the Soviet Gulag, and another 46,000 had been freed.&quot;

In 1949, as a response to the remilitarization of East Germany and the Soviet blockade of West Berlin, the United States, United Kingdom, France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Luxembourg, and Portugal formed the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, or NATO. In 1950, as a response to the outbreak of the Korean War, West Germany was also permitted to join NATO, which was then upgraded into a military alliance.

According to Koehler, however, &quot;As the Cold War intensified, living conditions in Soviet-occupied East Germany showed little improvement beyond the postwar level of bare subsistence. The new government of the DDR – a mere puppet of the Kremlin – relied more and more on the Stasi to quell discontent among factory workers and farmers. Ulbricht, claiming that the social unrest was fomented by capitalist agents, once ordered Mielke to personally visit one large plant and &#x27;arrest four or five such agents&#x27; as an example to the others. The Stasi deputy &#x27;discovered&#x27; the agents in record time.&quot;

===Field show trials===
Also in 1949, Noel Field, an American citizen who had spied for the NKVD from inside the U.S. State Department, the Office of Strategic Services, and the CIA, fled from his posting in Switzerland to Communist Czechoslovakia after his cover was blown by fellow mole Whittaker Chambers. On 11 May 1949, the Czechoslovakian secret police, or StB, in obedience to a direct order from KGB chief Lavrenti Beria, arrested Field in Prague. Field was then handed over to the Hungarian ÁVO. After his interrogation in Budapest, Field was used as a witness at show trials of senior Soviet Bloc Communists who, like László Rajk and Rudolf Slánský, stood accused of having spied for the United States. The real reason for the trials was to replace homegrown Communists in Eastern Europe with those who would be blindly loyal to Joseph Stalin and to blame the division of Germany on the intrigues of U.S. intelligence.

At the Rajk show trial, the prosecutor declared, &quot;Noel Field, one of the leaders of American espionage, specialized in recruiting spies from among left-wing elements.&quot;

In August 1950, six senior SED members, including Willi Kreikemeyer, the director of Deutsche Reichsbahn and head of Berliner Rundfunk, were accused of &quot;special connections with Noel Field, the American spy.&quot; All were either imprisoned or shot.

John Koehler writes, &quot;Similar purges were conducted in Czechoslovakia, Hungary, and Bulgaria, where Field appeared as a witness in show trials that resulted in some death sentences. The Soviets simply distrusted all Communists who had sought exile in the West. All the while, Mielke remained untouched and continued to serve as the deputy secret police chief. His survival reinforced the belief that he had spent the war years in the Soviet Union instead of France and Belgium as he had claimed in the 1945 questionnaire.&quot;

In June 1950, Erica Wallach, Noel Field&#x27;s adopted daughter, decided to search for him. From Paris, she telephoned Leo Bauer, the editor-in-chief of Berliner Rundfunk. The call was monitored by agents of the Soviet Ministry for Internal Affairs, and Bauer&#x27;s handler instructed him to invite Mrs. Wallach to East Berlin, where she was immediately arrested. Mielke personally interrogated her and, at one point, offered Mrs. Wallach immediate release if she named the members of her fictitious spy network. She was condemned to death by a Soviet military tribunal in East Berlin and shipped to the Lubianka prison in Moscow for her execution. After Joseph Stalin&#x27;s death in on 5 March 1953, Erica Wallach&#x27;s sentence was reduced to hard labor in Vorkuta, a region of the Gulag located above the Arctic Circle. She was released during the Khrushchev thaw in October 1955. At first, she was unable to join her husband and daughters in the U.S. because of the U.S. State Department&#x27;s concern over her former membership in the Communist Party of Germany. It took the personal intervention of CIA Director Allen Dulles to reunite Erica Wallach with her family in 1957. Wallach&#x27;s memoir of her experiences, &quot;Light at Midnight&quot;, was published in 1967.

===Death of Stalin===

After Soviet Premier Joseph Stalin died inside his Kuntsevo Dacha on 5 March 1953, the Central Committee of the East German Socialist Unity Party met in a special session and eulogized the dictator as the &quot;great friend of Germany who was always an advisor of and help to our people.&quot;

Two months later, on 5 May 1953, the SED&#x27;s General Secretary, Walter Ulbricht, and the rest of the leadership increased work quotas by 10%. They also decided to rename Chemnitz Karl-Marx-Stadt and to institute the Order of Karl Marx as the GDR&#x27;s highest award.

Two weeks later, Mielke accused &quot;a group of Party officials&quot; of &quot;plotting against the leadership&quot;, which &quot;resulted in more expulsions from the Politburo and the Central Committee.&quot;

===East German uprising of 1953===

Discontent among factory workers about a 10% increase of work quotas without a corresponding wage hike boiled over. On 16 June 1953, nearly one hundred construction workers gathered before work for a protest meeting at Stalinallee, in East Berlin. Words spread rapidly to other construction sites and hundreds of men and women joined the rally, which marched to the House of Ministries. The protesters chanted slogans for five hours, demanding to speak to Walter Ulbricht and Otto Grotewohl. Only Heavy Industry Minister Fritz Selbmann and Professor Robert Havemann, president of the GDR Peace Council, emerged. Their speech, however, was answered with jeers and the Ministers retreated into the heavily armed building. The regular and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei were summoned from their barracks, but made no move to attack the protesters, who returned to Stalinallee, where a general strike was called.

Following West Germany&#x27;s Federal Minister for All-German Questions Jakob Kaiser&#x27;s admonition in a late night broadcast to East Germans to shy away from provocations, RIAS, starting with its 11 pm news broadcast, and from then on in hourly intermissions, repeated the workers&#x27; demand to continue the strike the next day, calling specifically for all East Berliners to participate in a demo at 7am on the 17th at Strausberger Platz.

The following day, 17 June 1953, more than 100,000 protesters took to the streets of East Berlin. More than 400,000 protesters also took to the streets in other cities and towns throughout the German Democratic Republic. Everywhere, the demands were the same: free elections by secret ballot.

Outside of Berlin, the main centres of the protests included the industrial region around Halle, Merseburg, and Bitterfeld, as well as middle-size towns like Jena, Görlitz, and Brandenburg. No more than 25,000 people participated in strikes and demonstrations in Leipzig, but there were 32,000 in Magdeburg, 43,000 in Dresden, 53,000 in Potsdam – and in Halle, a figure close to 100,000.

In West Berlin, the American radio station RIAS and several other West German stations reported on the protests and on plans for a general strike. As East Germans listened to the broadcasts, 267,000 workers at State-owned plants in 304 cities and towns joined the general strike. In 24 towns, outraged East Germans stormed the Stasi&#x27;s prisons and freed between 2,000 and 3,000 political prisoners.

In response to orders, the Soviet Occupation Forces, the Stasi and the Kasernierte Volkspolizei went on the attack. Bloody street battles ensued and hundreds of policemen defected to the side of the protesters. Both police and Stasi stations were overrun and some government offices were sacked. The Party leadership retreated into a fortified compound in the Pankow district of East Berlin.

At noon, the Soviet authorities terminated all tram and metro traffic into the Eastern sector and all but closed the sector borders to West Berlin to prevent more demonstrators from reaching the city centre. An hour later, they declared martial law in East Berlin.

The repression took place outside East Berlin police HQ – where Soviet tanks opened fire on &quot;the insurgents&quot;.

According to John Koehler, &quot;... by late afternoon, Soviet tanks accompanied by infantry and MVD troops had rolled into East Berlin and other cities in the Soviet Zone. This made the people even angrier. At Berlin&#x27;s Potsdamer Platz, which bordered on the American Sector, irate protesters ignored machine gun fire and the menacing barrels of tank guns. They ripped cobblestones from the streets and hurled them at the tanks.&quot;

Fighting between the Red Army (and later GDR police) and the demonstrators persisted into the afternoon and night. In some cases, the tanks and the soldiers fired directly into the crowds.

Overnight, the Soviets (and the Stasi) started to arrest hundreds of people. Ultimately, up to 10,000 people were detained and at least 20, probably as many as 40, people were executed, including Red Army soldiers who refused to obey orders. With the SED leadership effectively paralysed at the Soviet headquarters in Karlshorst, control of the city passed to the Soviets.
In honor of the uprising, West Germany established 17 June as a national holiday, called Day of German Unity. The extension of the &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; boulevard to the west of the Brandenburg Gate, formerly called &quot;Charlottenburger Chaussee&quot;, was also renamed &quot;Straße des 17. Juni&quot; (&quot;17 June Street&quot;) in honor of the uprising.

According to John Koehler, &quot;Provisional prison camps were set up to hold the thousands of Stasi victims. Nearly 1,500 persons were sentenced in secret trials to long prison terms. On 24 June, Mielke issued a terse announcement that one Stasi officer, nineteen demonstrators, and two bystanders had been killed during the uprising. He did not say how many were victims of official lynching. The numbers of the wounded were given as 191 policemen, 126 demonstrators, and 61 bystanders.&quot;

Also according to Koehler, &quot;Calm returned to the streets of the Soviet Zone, yet escapes to the West continued at a high rate. Of the 331,390 who fled in 1953, 8,000 were members of the Kasernierte Volkspolizei, the barracked people&#x27;s police units, which were actually the secret cadre of the future East German Army. Also among the escapees were 2,718 members and candidates of the SED, the ruling Party.&quot;

==The Khrushchev thaw==
===Purges===

Alarmed by the uprising, Lavrenty Beria, the First Deputy Premier of the Soviet Union and head of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, personally travelled from Moscow to East Berlin. He conferred with Stasi Minister Wilhelm Zaisser and with Mielke, his deputy, both of whom he had known since the early 1930s. During both conversations, Beria demanded to know why the Stasi had failed to recognize the extreme discontent of the population and inform the Party leadership, which could then have prevented the uprising by taking extremely repressive measures in advance. Both Zaisser and Mielke answered Beria&#x27;s questions circumspectly, and were accordingly left in their posts.

In response to the uprising, Beria decided to replace several hundred MVD officers, including Major General Ivan Fadeykin, the MVD resident of East Germany. The Stasi, according to John Koehler, &quot;generally remained untouched except for the arrests and dismissals, for dereliction of duty, of a handful of officers in the provinces. One high-ranking Stasi officer shot himself.&quot;

Following Beria&#x27;s return to Moscow, however, he was arrested on 26 June 1953, in a coup d&#x27;état led by Nikita Khrushchev and Marshal Georgy Zhukov. Beria was tried on charges of 357 counts of rape and high treason. He was sentenced to death and shot by Red Army Colonel-General Pavel Batitsky on 23 December 1953.

In an interview to &quot;Neues Deutschland&quot;, the official party newspaper of East Germany, on 30 June 1953, the Party&#x27;s Minister of Justice, Max Fechner, declared that, &quot;illegal arrests,&quot; had been made and that being a member of a strike committee or suspicion of being a ringleader was not in itself grounds for arrest and conviction.

Meanwhile, when the East German Politburo met on 8 July, it seemed that Ulbricht would be deposed as Party General Secretary. Zaisser conceded that the whole Politburo was responsible for the &quot;accelerated construction of socialism&quot; and of the subsequent fallout. But he also added that to leave Ulbricht as Premier, &quot;would be opposed catastrophic for the New Course&quot;.

By the end of the meeting, only two Politburo members still supported Ulbricht&#x27;s leadership: Free German Youth League chief Erich Honecker and Party Control Commission Chairman Hermann Matern. Ulbricht only managed to forestall a decision then and there with a promise to make a statement at the forthcoming 15th SED CC Plenum, scheduled for later that month.

Meanwhile, Mielke informed a Party commission looking for scapegoats that his boss, Stasi Minister Wilhelm Zaisser, was calling for secret negotiations with West Germany and that, &quot;he believed the Soviet Union would abandon the DDR.&quot;

By late July, Ulbricht was completely certain that he had the support of the new Soviet First Secretary, Nikita Khrushchev. Therefore, he expelled his main opponents, Zaisser, Hernstadt and Ackermann, from the Politburo, and thus strengthened his position further.

SED Minister of Justice Max Fechner was personally arrested by Mielke and replaced by Hilde Benjamin, who was known to East German citizens as &quot;Red Hilde&quot;, &quot;The Red Freisler,&quot; and as, &quot;The Red Guillotine,&quot; for her role as a judge in the SED&#x27;s show trials.

Fechner was convicted of being, &quot;an enemy of the Party and the State,&quot; and served three years in Bautzen Prison.

Wilhelm Zaisser was replaced as head of the Stasi by Ernst Wollweber in 1953 and the Stasi was simultaneously downgraded to a State Secretariat under the Ministry of the Interior under the leadership of Willi Stoph. Mielke remained on staff as Wollweber&#x27;s deputy. Mielke would serve as Deputy State Secretary of State Security between 1953 and 1955.

The Stasi was restored to a ministry in 1955. Wollweber thus became Minister for State Security and Mielke Deputy Minister for State Security.

== Tenure as Stasi head ==

Mielke headed the Stasi from 1957 until the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989. As a Politburo member, Mielke moved into newly built secure housing zone for the leaders of East Germany in Waldsiedlung in 1960. Mielke occupied house number 14. There was, under the East German system, no provision for parliamentary oversight of the Stasi. However, starting in 1971 Mielke was required to provide a detailed intelligence briefing to party secretary Erich Honecker each Tuesday, directly following the weekly Politburo meeting. (Before 1971, under Walter Ulbricht, Mielke was not involved in routine intelligence briefings to the leadership which, instead, were provided directly to Ulbricht by Intelligence Chief Markus Wolf.)

According to Anna Funder&#x27;s award-winning exposé &quot;Stasiland&quot;, after becoming Minister for State Security in 1957, Mielke, in a backhanded compliment to George Orwell&#x27;s &quot;Nineteen Eighty-Four&quot;, ordered every room inside Stasi Headquarters renumbered so that his own office would be Room 101.

===Internal discipline===
During his tenure, Mielke enforced &quot;political and personal discipline reminiscent of the early French Foreign Legion&quot;. New recruits were required to take a solemn oath pledging &quot;to fight alongside the state security organs of all socialist countries against all enemies of socialism&quot; on pain of &quot;the severest punishment under the Republic&#x27;s laws and the contempt of the workers.&quot; Recruits were also required to sign a security pledge vowing never to make unauthorized visits to any &quot;capitalist countries&quot; and to report on any members of their families who did so.

Violations of the oath resulted in expulsion from the Stasi and blacklisting from all but the most menial jobs. Serious violations were tried before secret tribunals and led an estimated 200 Stasi agents to be shot. Colonel Rainer Wiegand once said, &quot;There was only one way to leave the MfS without being haunted for the rest of your life. You either retired or you died.&quot;

===Domestic activities===

Under Erich Mielke&#x27;s leadership, the Stasi employed 85,000 full-time domestic spies and 170,000 civilian informants () (IMs). East Germans coined a term to describe the Stasi&#x27;s pervasive surveillance of the population: &quot;blanket coverage&quot; (). For this reason, Anna Funder has referred to East Germany as, &quot;the most perfected surveillance state of all time.&quot;

According to John Koehler, &quot;...the Stasi&#x27;s tentacles probed every aspect of life. Full-time officers were posted to all major industrial plants. Without exception, one in every building was designated as a watchdog reporting to an area representative of the &quot;Volkspolizei&quot;...In turn, the police officer was the Stasi&#x27;s man. If a relative or friend came to stay overnight, it was reported. Schools, universities and hospitals were infiltrated from top to bottom. German academe was shocked to learn that Heinrich Fink, professor of theology and vice-chancellor of East Berlin&#x27;s Humboldt University, had been a Stasi informer since 1968. After Fink&#x27;s Stasi connections came to light, he was summarily fired. Doctors, lawyers, journalists, writers, actors, and sports figures were co-opted by Stasi officers, as were waiters and hotel personnel. Tapping about 100,000 telephone lines in East Germany and West Berlin around the clock was the job of 2,000 officers... Churchmen, including high officials of both Protestant and Catholic denominations, were recruited en masse as secret informants. Their offices and confessionals were infested with eavesdropping devices. Even the director of Leipzig&#x27;s famous Thomas Church choir, Hans-Joachim Rotzsch, was forced to resign when he was unmasked as a &quot;Spitzel&quot;, the people&#x27;s pejorative for a Stasi informant.&quot;

In an interview with journalist Anna Funder, an ex-Stasi officer recalled, &quot;Most often, people we approached would inform for us. It was very rare that they would not. However, sometimes we felt that we might need to know where their weak points were, just in case. For example, if we wanted a pastor, we&#x27;d find out if he&#x27;d had an affair, or had a drinking problem—things that we could use as leverage. Mostly though, people said yes.&quot;

On Mielke&#x27;s orders, and with his full knowledge, Stasi officers also engaged in arbitrary arrest, kidnapping, brutal harassment of political dissidents, torture, and the imprisonment of tens of thousands of citizens.

In a 1991 interview, Jewish Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said, &quot;The Stasi was much, much worse than the Gestapo, if you consider only the oppression of its own people. The Gestapo had 40,000 officials watching a country of 80 million, while the Stasi employed 102,000 to control only 17 million.&quot;

===Activities abroad===

During Mielke&#x27;s tenure, the Stasi&#x27;s operations beyond East Germany were overseen by Markus Wolf and the &quot;Hauptverwaltung Aufklärung&quot; (MfS-HVA).

Mielke and Wolf provided money, training, and surveillance equipment to help build pro-Soviet secret police forces in Fidel Castro&#x27;s Cuba, Baathist Syria, Sandinista-ruled Nicaragua, Mengistu Haile Mariam&#x27;s Ethiopia, Idi Amin&#x27;s Uganda, Kwame Nkrumah&#x27;s Ghana, South Yemen, and the Ministry of Public Security (MPS) in the Socialist Republic of Vietnam.

After the opening of Stasi archives, it was further revealed that West Germany was riddled with MfS-HVA moles. In what John Koehler has dubbed, &quot;The Invisible Invasion&quot;, some West German citizens collaborated out of Marxist beliefs, but others were recruited through blackmail, bribery, career frustrations, or sexual favors provided by Stasi operatives.

Another tactic was for Stasi military advisers assigned to African and Middle Eastern countries to request the arrest of West German tourists. Local police would then turn the prisoner over to the Stasi agent, who would offer the West German a choice between espionage or incarceration.

Senior politicians from the Social Democratic Party of Germany, the Free Democratic Party of Germany, and the Christian Democratic Union were exposed and, when still alive, prosecuted.

The 1974 arrest and exposure of Günter Guillaume, a highly placed Stasi mole inside the Social Democratic Party, resulted in the resignation of West Germany Chancellor Willy Brandt and the discrediting of the latter&#x27;s policy of &quot;Ostpolitik&quot;.

Mielke and Wolf also seriously compromised West Germany&#x27;s police departments, foreign and domestic intelligence services, diplomatic corps, military-industrial complex, and journalistic profession.

The Stasi also compromised the United States military and U.S. State Department presence in West Germany. The most damaging American to spy for the Stasi was United States Army Sergeant James Hall III, who volunteered his services to Soviet and East German intelligence in November 1981.

Sergeant Hall sold the Stasi 13,088 pages of classified documents, including detailed information about Project Trojan, a worldwide electronic network with the ability to pinpoint armored vehicles, missiles and aircraft by recording their signal emissions during wartime and the complete National SIGINT Requirements List (NSRL), a 4,258-page document about NSA operations at home and abroad.

In 1988, Sergeant Hall was tricked into confessing his espionage career to an undercover FBI Special Agent named Dimitry Droujinsky, a Russian-American, who was posing as Hall&#x27;s new KGB handler. When news of Sergeant Hall&#x27;s arrest became public, one Washington intelligence official called the breach, &quot;the Army&#x27;s Walker Case.&quot;

===Collusion with Nazism===

Beginning in 1960, Erich Mielke and Markus Wolf, who was ironically of German Jewish descent, used false flag recruitment to secretly organize and finance neo-Nazi organizations, which they then instructed to vandalize Jewish religious and cultural sites throughout West Germany. During the Jerusalem trial of Adolf Eichmann, Stasi agents sent letters to West German Neo-Nazis and Waffen-SS veterans, urging them to protest the trial and to donate money to pay for Eichmann&#x27;s defense attorney. This was done in order to lend credibility to Communist propaganda, which alleged throughout the Cold War that West Germany was a Fascist and neo-Nazi country.

According to German Jewish historian Michael Wolffsohn, &quot;There is no doubt that in the 1960s as now, there were Nazis who were unreconstructed, unchangeable and evil, but without the help of East Germany, these Nazis were incapable of a national, coordinated campaign. That was true of right-wing extremist criminals in the 1980s as well. The East German Communists used anything they could against West Germany, including the... fears by Western countries and Jews that a new Nazism could be growing in West Germany. There is... evidence that the East Germans continued to use Anti-Semitism as a tool against West Germany in the 1970s and perhaps right up until 1989.&quot;

In a 1991 interview with John Koehler, Holocaust survivor and Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal said of the Stasi, &quot;They not only terrorized their own people worse than the Gestapo, but the government was the most Anti-Semitic and Anti-Israeli in the entire Eastern Bloc. They did nothing to help the West in tracking down Nazi criminals; they ignored all requests from West German judicial authorities for assistance. We have just discovered shelves of files on Nazis stretching over four miles. Now we also know how the Stasi used those files. They blackmailed Nazi criminals who fled abroad after the war into spying for them. What&#x27;s more, the Stasi trained terrorists from all over the world.&quot;

===Support for paramilitary and terrorist groups===
During a 1979 visit to the GDR by senior PLO member Salah Khalaf, Mielke said, &quot;We are paying great attention to the Palestine resistance and the other revolutionary forces fighting against the policies of the United States and against the provocations of the Israeli aggressor. Together with the Soviet Union and other socialist countries, we will do everything to support this just battle.&quot;

With this in mind, Mielke ordered the Stasi to finance, arm, and train, &quot;urban guerrillas,&quot; from numerous countries. According to former Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand, Mielke&#x27;s ties to violent paramilitary groups were overseen by Markus Wolf and Department Three of the MfS-HVA. Members of the West German &quot;Baader-Meinhoff Group&quot;, the Chilean &quot;Manuel Rodríguez Patriotic Front&quot;, and &quot;Umkhonto we Sizwe&quot;, the paramilitary wing of the African National Congress, were brought to East Germany for training in the use of military hardware, insurgent tactics, and, &quot;the leadership role of the Party.&quot; Similar training was given to Palestinians from the &quot;Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine&quot;, &quot;Abu Nidal&quot;, and &quot;Black September&quot;.

Other Stasi agents worked as military advisers to Soviet-backed African guerrilla organizations and the governments they later formed. They included the Namibian &quot;SWAPO&quot; and the Angolan &quot;MPLA&quot; during the South African Border War, the &quot;FRELIMO&quot; during the Mozambican War of Independence and civil war, and Robert Mugabe&#x27;s &quot;ZANLA&quot; during the Rhodesian Bush War.

Colonel Wiegand revealed that Mielke and Wolf provided bodyguards from the Stasi&#x27;s counter-terrorism division for Venezuelan-born PLO terrorist Carlos the Jackal and &quot;Black September&quot; leader Abu Daoud during their visits to the GDR. Col. Wiegand had been sickened by the 1972 Munich massacre and was horrified that the GDR would treat the man who ordered it as an honored guest. When he protested, Wiegand was told that Abu Daoud was, &quot;a friend of our country, a high-ranking political functionary,&quot; and that there was no proof that he was a terrorist.

During the 1980s, Wiegand secretly blackmailed a Libyan diplomat into spying on his colleagues. Wiegand&#x27;s informant told him that the La Belle bombing and other terrorist attacks against American and West German citizens were being planned at the Libyan Embassy in East Berlin. When Wiegand showed him a detailed report, Mielke informed the SED&#x27;s Politburo, which ordered the Colonel to continue surveillance but not interfere with the plans of the Libyans.

According to John Koehler, &quot;Murder, kidnapping, extortion, bank robbery, and arson were felonies under the East German criminal code. However, if these offenses were committed under the banner of the &#x27;anti-imperialist struggle,&#x27; the communist system would look the other way. Moreover, it had assigned the Stasi to make sure that terrorists were properly trained for murder and sowing mayhem. There were no limits to the East German regime&#x27;s involvement with terrorism, so long as it could be ideologically justified.&quot;

==The Peaceful Revolution==
According to John Koehler, &quot;Increasingly concerned over the growing popular opposition, Stasi Minister Mielke early in 1989 ordered the creation of a special elite unit for crushing disturbances. Its personnel were carefully selected members of the counterespionage and counterterrorism directorate. They were equipped with special batons similar to electric cattle prods but much more powerful. In a secret speech to top-ranking Stasi officers on 29 June, Mielke warned that, &#x27;hostile opposing forces and groups have already achieved a measure of power and are using all methods to achieve a change in the balance of power.&#x27; Former Stasi Colonel Rainer Wiegand told me he was horrified when Mielke compared the situation with that of China two months earlier. Chinese students in Beijing had begun massive protests in April and in May, during a student demonstration in Tiananmen Square, security troops had opened fire on them killing hundreds. &#x27;Mielke said our situation was comparable and we had to be ready to counter it with all means and methods,&#x27; Wiegand recalled. &#x27;Mielke said that the Chinese leadership had succeeded in smothering the protests before the situation got out of hand.

On 9 September 1989, Mielke attended the match between BSG Energie Cottbus and BFC Dynamo at the Stadion der Freundschaft in Cottbus, together with fellow Poliburo member Egon Krenz and their entourage. This visit would eventually come to be his last visit to a match of BFC Dynamo as a minister.
Mielke was the first chairman of SV Dynamo and had been the honorary chairman of football club BFC Dynamo since its founding 1966.

===40th anniversary of the GDR===

As the fortieth anniversary of the GDR approached, Mielke ordered, &quot;We must stop the internal enemy. At the least hint of a disturbance of the celebration, isolate and arrest them.&quot;

One former Stasi Major recalled, &quot;We mixed inconspicuously with the demonstrators, accompanied by our IMs. Hundreds of us stood at the sides of the street in order to stop any activity before it got started. We barely got any sleep toward the end. Never did I sense that the people were afraid of the MfS. The Stasi was more afraid of the people than the people were of them.&quot;

According to Koehler, &quot;Despite the unrest, the regime celebrated its fortieth with a huge, pompous ceremony in Berlin on 7 October, while tens of thousands of outside the ornate building of the State Council. The People&#x27;s Police cordons were utterly ineffectual. As Stasi Minister Erich Mielke drove up and was greeted by General Günter Kratsch, the counterintelligence chief, Mielke screamed at police: &quot;Club those pigs into submission!&quot; () The police ignored Mielke&#x27;s ranting.

As more and more East Germans were arrested for protesting the 40th anniversary celebrations, many of them sang &quot;The Internationale&quot; in Vopo and Stasi custody to imply that they, rather than their captors, were the real working class and the real revolutionaries.

According to Anna Funder, &quot;There was a sea of red flags, a torchlight procession, and tanks. The old men on the podium wore light-grey suits studded with medals. Mikhail Gorbachev stood next to Honecker, but he looked uncomfortable among the much older Germans. He had come to tell them that it was over, to convince the leadership to adopt his reformist policies. He had spoken openly about the danger of not &#x27;responding to reality.&#x27; He pointedly told the Politburo that, &#x27;life punishes those who come too late.&#x27; Honecker and Mielke ignored him, just as they ignored the crowds when they chanted, &quot;Gorby, help us! Gorby, help us!&quot;

===Plan X===

On 8 October 1989, Mielke and Honecker ordered the Stasi to implement &quot;Plan X&quot;—the SED&#x27;s plan to arrest and indefinitely detain 85,939 East Germans during a state of emergency. According to John Koehler, Plan X had been in preparation since 1979 and was, &quot;a carbon copy of how the Nazi concentration camps got their start after Hitler came to power in 1933.&quot;

By 1984, 23 sites had been selected for &quot;isolation and internment camps.&quot; Those who were to be imprisoned in them ran into six categories, including anyone who had ever been under surveillance for anti-state activities, including all members of peace movements which were not under Stasi control.

According to Anna Funder, &quot;The plans contained exact provisions for the use of all available prisons and camps, and when those were full for the conversion of other buildings: Nazi detention centers, schools, hospitals, and factory holiday hostels. Every detail was foreseen, from where the doorbell was located on the house of each person to be arrested to the adequate supply of barbed wire and the rules of dress and etiquette in the camps...&quot;

However, when Mielke sent the orders, codenamed &quot;Shield&quot; (), to each local Stasi precinct to begin the planned arrests, he was not obeyed. Terrified of an East German version of the mass lynchings of Hungarian secret police agents during the 1956 Revolution, Stasi agents throughout the GDR fortified their office-buildings and barricaded themselves inside.

===Toppling Honecker===

Even as orders were going out to implement &quot;Plan X&quot;, Mielke had already thrown his support behind a faction in the SED&#x27;s Politburo that sought to oust Honecker. Although Mielke was of the same generation as Honecker and had matured in an environment where following orders was the rule, he was sober enough and politically savvy enough to realize this approach no longer worked. During a session on 10 October 1989, Mielke delivered a report attacking Honecker&#x27;s desire to violently suppress the demonstrations rather than implement &quot;Glasnost&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot; in the GDR.

In what Edward N. Peterson has called &quot;a remarkable disclaimer of responsibility for the violence,&quot; Mielke declared that Honecker&#x27;s orders to the Stasi &quot;were built on false situation judgments.&quot; He added that Honecker&#x27;s commands on 7 and 8 October &quot;were false and undifferentiated condemnations of those who think differently. Despite this evaluation, there was never any instructions to use violence against persons. There is nothing in our basic principles to consider a demonstration as part of a possible counterrevolutionary coup.&quot;

Mielke also claimed that &quot;the Party judged the situation falsely. We tried to tell them the true situation, but enough was not done.&quot; Mielke argued in favor of solving the demonstrations politically and giving &quot;every DDR citizen the right to travel.&quot;

On 17 October 1989, Mielke and the rest of the GDR&#x27;s Politburo met to follow Gorbachev&#x27;s demand, voiced in August, to remove Honecker as General Secretary of the SED and State Council chairman. Suspecting that Honecker&#x27;s personal bodyguards might try to arrest the members of the Central Committee when they met to vote Honecker out in favour of Egon Krenz, Mielke saw to it that Stasi agents who were loyal to him were stationed near the meeting room. While deliberations were underway, Mielke told Honecker that &quot;we simply cannot start shooting with tanks,&quot; and tried to impress upon Honecker that it was &quot;the end&quot;.

After the vote to oust Honecker passed, Mielke &quot;got nasty,&quot; and accused Honecker of corruption. Honecker responded that Mielke should not open his mouth so much. Mielke responded by putting the last nail into Honecker&#x27;s coffin. He announced that the Stasi had a file on the now-ousted Premier. It contained proof of Honecker&#x27;s corrupt business practices, allegedly deviant sexual activities, and how, as a member of the underground Communist Party of Germany during the Nazi years, he had been arrested by the Gestapo and had named names.

To the shock of both the Politburo and the Stasi, Krenz&#x27;s first televised addresses failed to win popular support. Despite his assurances that the SED was at last ready to embrace Gorbachev&#x27;s reformist policies, Krenz&#x27;s approval ratings remained extremely low.

Former Politburo member Günter Schabowski later recalled, &quot;We made a palace revolution without offering a real alternative... We had not quickly and thoroughly enough whittled away from Stalin&#x27;s methods.&quot;

===Defeat===
On 7 November 1989, Mielke resigned, along with eleven out of eighteen members of the SED&#x27;s Council of Ministers, in response to the increasing disintegration of the GDR.

Two days later, Schabowski announced on television that the east–west border was open without restriction.

According to Anna Funder, there was panic at Stasi Headquarters in Berlin-Lichtenberg, &quot;Stasi officers were instructed to destroy files, starting with the most incriminatingthose naming westerners who spied for them, and those that concerned deaths. They shredded the files until the paper shredders overheated and shorted out. Among other shortages in the East, there was a shredder shortage, so they had to send agents out under cover to West Berlin to buy more. In Building 8 alone, the citizens&#x27; movement found over a hundred burnt out shredders. When they ran out of working shredders from the West and could not procure more they began using scissors to cut the documents by hand.

According to William F. Buckley, Jr., &quot;In the weeks after 9 November, Stasi offices were stormed in various cities around East Germany. Stasi commissars in three of those cities committed suicide. But not one was lynched or executed.&quot;

===Televised humiliation===

On 13 November 1989, Mielke was summoned to deliver a briefing about the protests to the GDR parliament, or &quot;Volkskammer&quot;. Formerly a &quot;rubber stamp parliament,&quot; the disintegration of the SED&#x27;s power had allowed the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; to begin exercising real authority over the GDR. Therefore, Mielke, as the head of the Stasi (known as the &quot;shield and sword of the [SED] party&quot;), was summoned before the newly empowered parliament to justify his position in government.

As his speech was broadcast live, Mielke began by using overly bombastic, flag-waving language, saying &quot;We have, comrades, dear assembly members, an extraordinarily high amount of contact with all working people.&quot; () To his shock, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; responded with boos, whistles, and catcalls.

His face grief-stricken and pale, Mielke then tried to defuse the situation, &quot;Yes, we have such contact, let me tell let me tell you why. I am not afraid to stand here and to give you an unbiased answer.&quot; () Mielke continued, speaking of the &quot;triumph&quot; of the socialist economy, continuing all the while to address the members of the Volkskammer as &quot;Comrades&quot; (). In response, Volkskammer member Dietmar Czok of the Christian Democratic Union, rose from his seat and raised his hand. The Volkskammer&#x27;s president, Günther Maleuda, interrupted Mielke and urged Czok to speak.

With his voice dripping with contempt, Czok told Mielke, &quot;As a point of order, I will not tell you this again. There are more people sitting in this Chamber than just your Comrades!&quot; (). In response, many in the Volkskammer burst into applause, cheers, and shouts of &quot;We are not your Comrades!&quot; ().

Trying to appear magnanimous, Mielke responded, &quot;This is a natural, humanistic question! This is just a question of formality.&quot; (), leading to further shouts of displeasure from the members of the Volkskammer. In a last ditch effort, Mielke &quot;raised his arms like an evangelist,&quot; and cried, &quot;I love all humanity! I really do! I&#x27;m committed to it!&quot; ()

Everyone in the room, including staunch SED members such as Egon Krenz and Günter Schabowski, burst out laughing, with some also pointing at him or making obscene gestures. John Koehler later wrote, &quot;Mielke was finished.&quot;

Mielke&#x27;s address to the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; remains the most famous broadcast in the history of German television. Anna Funder has written, &quot;When they think of Mielke, East Germans like to think of this.&quot;

===The Fall===
On 17 November 1989, the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; renamed the MfS the &quot;Amt für Nationale Sicherheit&quot; (AfNS – Office for National Security). The following day, Mielke&#x27;s tenure in office ended when the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; appointed &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Wolfgang Schwanitz as the new director of the AfNS.

On 1 December 1989 the &quot;Volkskammer&quot; revoked the clause of the GDR constitution that declared the GDR to be a socialist state under the leadership of the SED, formally ending Communist rule in East Germany. Two days later, the SED announced that Mielke&#x27;s party membership had been permanently revoked. Years later, he lamented, &quot;Millions have died for nothing. Everything we fought for – it has all amounted to nothing.&quot; He also said, &quot;If the party had given me the task, then there would perhaps still be a GDR today. On that you can rely.&quot;

==Prosecution==

===Indictments===
On 7 December 1989, Erich Mielke was arrested and taken into solitary confinement for embezzlement of public funds in order to improve his hunting estate. He was charged with &quot;Damaging the People&#x27;s Economy&quot; (). Mielke was initially imprisoned in the Hohenschönhausen Prison Complex and investigated by the East German military prosecutor&#x27;s office. On 7 January 1990, he was further charged with high treason () and conspiring with Erich Honecker to bug the telephones and open the mail of every one of East Germany&#x27;s citizens.

Mielke was released on 9 March 1990 for being unfit for imprisonment. However, he would be imprisoned again three months later. In May 1990, the East German Attorney general took over the investigation. On 26 July 1990, Mielke was arrested again. Mielke was now indicted for ordering the shootings of defectors at the Berlin Wall. He would also be charged with misuse of office, breach of trust, and incitement to pervert the course of justice. Mielke spent time at the Rummelsburg prison and then at the Plötzensee Prison, before he was sent to the Moabit Prison, where he would remain for a longer time.

In the meanwhile, the Federal Constitutional Court announced that Mielke had also been indicted for having ordered two terrorist attacks by the Baader-Meinhoff Group against United States military personnel who were stationed on West German soil. The first was the car bomb attack against the United States Air Force at Ramstein Air Base on 31 August 1981. The second was the attempted murder with an RPG-7 anti-tank rocket of United States Army General Frederick Kroesen, his wife, and the West German Federal Police (BKA) officer who was driving their armored Mercedes at Heidelberg on 15 September 1981.

===Bülowplatz trial===

In February 1992, Mielke was put on trial for the 1931 murders of Berlin Police Captains Anlauf and Lenck as well as the attempted murder of Senior Sergeant Willig. The evidence for Mielke&#x27;s guilt was drawn from the original police files, the transcripts from the 1934 trial of his co-conspirators, and a handwritten memoir in which Mielke revealed that his role in, &quot;the Bülowplatz Affair,&quot; had been his reason for fleeing to Moscow from the Weimar Republic in 1931. All had been found in Mielke&#x27;s house safe during a police search in 1990. Mielke was believed to have kept the documents for the purpose of &quot;blackmailing Honecker and other East German leaders.&quot; Former Associated Press reporter and White House Press Secretary John Koehler also testified that Mielke had boasted of his involvement in the Bülowplatz murders during a confrontation at Leipzig in 1965.

During his trial, Mielke appeared increasingly senile, admitting his identity but otherwise remaining silent, taking naps, and showing little interest in the proceedings. In a widely publicized incident, Mielke appeared to mistake the presiding judge for a prison barber. When a journalist for &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; attempted to interview him in Plötzensee Prison, Mielke responded, &quot;I want to go back to my bed&quot; (). Opinion was divided whether Mielke was suffering from senile dementia or was pretending in order to evade prosecution.

After twenty months of one-and-a-half-hour daily sessions, Erich Mielke was convicted on two counts of murder and one of attempted murder. On 26 October 1993, a panel of three judges and two jurors sentenced him to six years&#x27; imprisonment. At his sentencing, Mielke started to cry. In pronouncing sentence, Judge Theodor Seidel, told Mielke that he &quot;will go down in history as one of the most fearsome dictators and police ministers of the 20th century.&quot;

===Imprisonment===
In one of the most highly anticipated of the &quot;&quot;, Mielke was then put on trial for ordering the shootings of East Germans who were trying to defect to the West. In November 1994, the presiding judge adjourned the proceedings, ruling that Mielke was not mentally competent to stand trial.

During his incarceration, at JVA Moabit corrections officers supplied Mielke with a red telephone like the one in his office at Stasi Headquarters. Although it was not connected to the outside world, Mielke enjoyed having imaginary conversations with non-existent Stasi agents. His other favorite pastime was watching game shows on television.

In 1995, parole officers and Mielke&#x27;s attorneys argued that he was &quot;totally confused&quot; and obtained his release. At 87 years of age, Erich Mielke was Germany&#x27;s oldest prison inmate and had been incarcerated for 1,904 days. Days before his release, the Public Prosecutor of Berlin announced that he was &quot;not interested in chasing an 87-year-old man anymore&quot; and that all further prosecution of Mielke had been indefinitely suspended. In an interview with John O. Koehler, former Stasi political prisoner Werner Juretzko commented resignedly about the leniency the post-1989 German legal system has shown to East German officials who were guilty of crimes against humanity, &quot;I guess the Germans have lost their balls.&quot;

According to Koehler, &quot;[Mielke&#x27;s] bank account, which held more than 300,000 Marks (about US$187,500), was confiscated. Before his arrest in 1989, the most feared man in East Germany had lived in a luxurious home with access to an indoor pool. In addition, he owned a palatial hunting villa, complete with a movie theater, trophy room, 60 servants, and a hunting preserve.&quot;

Koehler continued, &quot;After he was released from prison Mielke was obliged to move into a two-room, 55-square-meter flat. Like all Stasi pensioners, he would henceforth have to live on 802 marks (about US$512) a month.&quot; There he lived a secluded life together with his wife Gertrud. On Christmas Day, he attended services in the nearby Protestant parish in the locality of Wartenberg. Mielke&#x27;s apartment, with number 4.03, was located on the fourth floor in a cookie cutter 16-storey plattenbau on Prendener Straße 92 in today&#x27;s locality of Neu-Hohenschönhausen in the borough of Lichtenberg in former East Berlin.

==Death==

Erich Mielke died on 21 May 2000, aged 92, in a Berlin nursing home in Neu-Hohenschönhausen. After being cremated at the crematorium in Meissen, an urn containing Mielke&#x27;s ashes was buried in an unmarked grave at the Zentralfriedhof Friedrichsfelde in Berlin. An estimated 100 people reportedly attended the funeral. Erich Mielke&#x27;s grave is outside the memorial section established at the entrance in 1951 by East German leaders for communist heroes. Within hours of his funeral, the flowers and wreaths left at Mielke&#x27;s grave were ripped to shreds by persons unknown.

==Legacy==
Writing in 2003, Australian journalist Anna Funder declared, &quot;The name Mielke has now come to mean &#x27;Stasi.&#x27; Victims are dubiously honored to find his signature in their files: on plans for someone to be observed &#x27;with all possible methods&#x27;, on commands for arrest, for kidnapping, instructions to judges for sentencing, orders for &#x27;liquidation&#x27;. The honor is dubious because... he signed so many.&quot;

In 2012, the museum at the former Stasi headquarters opened Mielke&#x27;s office as a permanent exhibit. Soon after, &quot;The Guardian&quot; correspondent Tam Eastley visited the exhibit and numerous sites in Berlin connected to Mielke&#x27;s life, times, and legacy. When she visited Mielke&#x27;s grave, Eastley found that it had become a shrine for adherents of &quot;Ostalgie&quot;.

==Sports==
Mielke was the president of sports association SV Dynamo from its founding in 1953 until 1989. The sports association would eventually include as many as 278,000 members and 380 sports communities. As the President of SV Dynamo, Mielke was one of the most important politicians in East German sports, alongside Manfred Ewald and Rudolf Hellmann. BFC Dynamo was known to be his favourite football team. He was elected honorary president at the club&#x27;s founding in 1966 and barely missed a home match of the team. Mielke was also a keen supporter of ice hockey. His favourite ice hockey team was SC Dynamo Berlin, today known as Eisbären Berlin.

East Germany had the world&#x27;s smallest ice hockey league for a long time. The sport was demoted in 1970 following the 1969 Competitive Sports Resolution (). Ice hockey was considered too expensive in relation to the expected medal yield. Funding for ice hockey was halted and the DDR-Oberliga risked being shut down. However, ice hockey enthusiast Mielke intervened against this development to ensure that the sport could continue. As a result, a compromise was reached and the DDR-Oberliga was allowed to continue operate with two teams affiliated to SV Dynamo: SC Dynamo Berlin and SG Dynamo Weißwasser.

Mielke worked to preserve ice hockey in East Germany and defended the sport on several occasions against the President of the German Gymnastics and Sports Federation (DTSB) Manfred Ewald. Mielke is said to have said the following to Ewald in 1986: &quot;I know, comrade Ewald, that you are against ice hockey, but I am for it. It&#x27;s a beautiful sport that inspires the masses and the players too, and that&#x27;s why they should play&quot;. The DDR-Oberliga continued to operate as a championship between SC Dynamo Berlin and SG Dynamo Weißwasser until 1990. Both teams survived the end of East Germany and were eventually admitted into the 1990–91 Bundesliga.

==Personal life==
Erich Mielke was a fitness enthusiast, a non-smoker, and drank very little. He was a keen hunter and owned a large area of ground where he would hunt animals with other East German and visiting Soviet officials.

During the late 1940s, when Mielke was working as security chief of the DWK, he began a relationship with Gertrud Mueller, a seamstress. On 18 December 1948, shortly after the birth of their son Frank Mielke, Erich and Gertrud married in a civil ceremony in the Wedding section of Berlin.

According to the newspaper &quot;Bild&quot;, the Mielkes adopted an orphaned girl named Ingrid, who was born in 1950. Like the Mielkes&#x27; son Frank, Ingrid Mielke attended the Wilhelm Pieck School. She ultimately became a captain in the Stasi and married a Stasi Lieutenant named Norbert Knappe. As of 1999, the Knappes had both refused to grant an interview to &quot;Bild&quot; reporters.

==In popular culture==
Erich Mielke has appeared as a character in both films and novels set in the GDR.

* Volker Schlöndorff&#x27;s &quot;The Legend of Rita&quot; (2000), which focuses on Stasi collusion with the West German far-left terrorist organization &quot;Rote Armee Fraktion&quot;. In conversation with fictional Stasi officer Erwin Hull, Mielke (played by Dietrich Körner) expresses admiration for the RAF&#x27;s campaign against the United States, West Germany, and the State of Israel, which he compares with his own activities against the Weimar Republic and the Nazis. The RAF members are then brought to a training camp, where Stasi agents instruct them in the use of grenade launchers and other kinds of military hardware. Mielke&#x27;s name is never disclosed and Agent Hull addresses him only as, &quot;Comrade General&quot;. ()
* Florian Henckel von Donnersmarck&#x27;s &quot;The Lives of Others&quot; (2006), which focuses on the Stasi&#x27;s surveillance and repression of the East German population. In the film, a previously loyal GDR playwright named Georg Dreymann publishes an anonymous article in the West German magazine &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; which accuses East Germany&#x27;s Minister of Culture of having persecuted a blacklisted stage director until he hanged himself. Soon after the article goes to press, Mielke&#x27;s voice is heard over the telephone giving a dressing down to fictional Stasi Lieutenant Colonel Anton Grubitz. Addressed only as &quot;Genosse Armeegeneral&quot; (Mielke was the only person in the Stasi to ever hold that rank), Mielke threatens to throw Grubitz in front of a firing squad if he fails to identify and arrest the article&#x27;s author.
* In Philip Kerr&#x27;s novel &quot;Field Grey&quot; (2010), Mielke first appears in 1931 Berlin, when protagonist Bernie Gunther saves him from being murdered by Nazi Brownshirts. The novel then flashes forward to 1954, when Gunther is recruited into a CIA plot to abduct Mielke from East Berlin.
* Jens Becker and Maarten van der Duin&#x27;s docudrama &quot;Erich Mielke - Master of Fear&quot; (2015) focuses on Mielke&#x27;s personality, his role in the creation of the Stasi and his work as a minister. The film depicts Mielke at the height of his power in 1989, as well as his imprisonment in 1991. In the film, Mielke is portrayed by German actor Kaspar Eichel.
* Mielke is portrayed by Gunnar Helm in the German TV Series &quot;Kleo&quot; (2022), where he is shown to have been killed in 1990 by the protagonist, a former Stasi agent who blames him for being framed up and imprisoned.
