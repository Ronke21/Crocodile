<text>Sir William Hamo Thornycroft (9 March 185018 December 1925) was an English sculptor, responsible for some of London&#x27;s best-known statues, including the statue of Oliver Cromwell outside the Palace of Westminster. He was a keen student of classical sculpture and was one of the youngest artists to be elected to the Royal Academy, in 1882, the same year the bronze cast of &quot;Teucer&quot; was purchased for the British nation under the auspices of the Chantrey Bequest.

He was a leading figure in the establishment of the New Sculpture movement, which provided a transition between the neoclassical styles of the 19th century and later modernist developments.

==Biography==
===Early life and education===

William Hamo Thornycroft was born in London into the Thornycroft family of sculptors. Both his parents, Thomas and Mary, and his grandfather, John, were distinguished sculptors. As a young child, Hamo was sent to live with an uncle on a farm in Cheshire until, aged nine, he began studying at the Modern Free Grammar School in Macclesfield, before in 1863 returning to London as a pupil at the University College School. He subsequently, from 1869, studied at the Royal Academy, where his primary influence was the painter-sculptor Frederic Leighton. While a student, Thornycroft assisted his father, Thomas, on the monumental sculptural group &quot;Boadicea and Her Daughters&quot;, later installed beside Westminster Bridge in London. At the Royal Academy Schools, Hamo Thornycroft won two medals and obtained his first paid commission for a work, a bust of a Dr. Sharpey. 

In 1871, Thornycroft visited Italy and Paris and assisted his parents in creating the Poets&#x27; Fountain for Park Lane in London, by making several figures of poets in marble and bronze. The fountain was subsequently destroyed in the Second World War. During the first half of the 1870s he exhibited works on a regular basis at the Royal Academy, showing &quot;Fame&quot;, the Sharpey bust, a bust of Mrs Mordaunt and a model for an equestrian statue of Lord Mayo. In 1876 Thornycroft won the Gold Medal of the Royal Academy with the statue &quot;Warrior Bearing a Wounded Youth&quot;.

===Early career===
Thornycroft created a series of statues in the ideal genre in the late 1870s and early 1880s that sought to reanimate the format of the classical statue. These included &quot;Lot&#x27;s Wife&quot; (1878) and &quot;Artemis and her Hound&quot; (1880 plaster, 1882 marble). In 1880 he was elected an Associate of the Royal Academy, and produced the Homeric bowman &quot;Teucer&quot; (1881 plaster, 1882 bronze), and the &quot;Mower&quot; (1884 plaster, 1894 bronze), arguably the first life-size freestanding statue of a contemporary labourer in 19th-century sculpture. Both &quot;Artemis and her Hound&quot; and &quot;Teucer&quot; combined classical compositions with a increased sense of naturalism to imply movement and energy. A companion piece to the &quot;Mower&quot;, the &quot;Sower&quot;, was exhibited in 1886 at the Royal Academy. When, in 1894, the critic Edmund Gosse coined the term &quot;The New Sculpture&quot;, he formulated its early principles from Thornycroft&#x27;s work.

After 1884, Thornycroft&#x27;s reputation was secure and he won commissions for a number of major monuments, most notably the innovative &quot;General Gordon&quot; in Trafalgar Square and since moved to Victoria Embankment Gardens. Other significant works he created included an effigy of Harvey Goodwin, Bishop of Carlisle (1895; Carlisle Cathedral), and the statues of Oliver Cromwell (Westminster), Dean Colet (a bronze group, early Italianate in feeling, outside St Paul&#x27;s School, formerly in Hammersmith and now in Barnes, London), &quot;Alfred the Great&quot; (Winchester), the Gladstone Memorial (in the Strand, London) and Mandell Creighton, Bishop of London (bronze, erected in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral). Other significant memorials were built in several cities then in the British Empire.

===Architectural work===
The Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales (ICAEW) Council commissioned Thornycroft to produce a detailed sculpted frieze for their headquarters at Chartered Accountants&#x27; Hall for a cost of £3,000. Thornycroft&#x27;s frieze, carved between 1889 and 1893, includes a series of figures representing Arts, Sciences, Crafts, Education, Commerce, Manufacture, Agriculture, Mining, Railways, Shipping, India, the Colonies, and Building. The figure of the architect is based on the Hall&#x27;s architect, John Belcher, and the sculptor on Thornycroft himself. The figure of the solicitor is H. Markby of Markby, Stewart &amp; Co., who acted for ICAEW in its early years.

===Later works===
Thornycroft continued to be a central member of the sculptural establishment and the Royal Academy into the 20th century. He was awarded the medal of honour at the 1900 Paris Exhibition, and was knighted in 1917. In 1901, he began a series of small bronze statuettes for the home market while continuing to work on large commissions. His single largest work, the monument to Lord Curzon, was unveiled in Calcutta in 1913. 

Thornycroft exhibited &quot;The Kiss&quot;, a large ideal piece he had worked on for three years, at the Royal Academy in 1916, and received a standing ovation from his fellow artists when it was unveiled. He was awarded the first gold medal bestowed by the Royal Society of British Sculptors in 1924, although he had previously, in 1908, declined the offer of the presidency of that body. Thornycroft&#x27;s last major work was the tomb effigy of Bishop Huyshe Yeatman-Biggs which was shown at the Royal Academy in 1925 and subsequently installed in Coventry Cathedral.

Thornycroft became increasingly resistant to new developments in sculpture, although his work of the early 1880s helped to catalyse sculpture in the United Kingdom towards those new directions. In sum, he provided an important transition between the neoclassical and academic styles of the 19th century and its fin-de-siècle and modernist departures.

A blue plaque commemorates Thornycroft at 2b Melbury Road, Kensington, his studio designed by his lifelong friend the architect John Belcher, .

==Family==
In addition to his parents, Thornycroft&#x27;s grandfather John Francis was also a distinguished sculptor. His brother, Sir John Isaac Thornycroft, became a successful naval engineer; their sister, Theresa, was the mother of the poet Siegfried Sassoon; Theresa and sisters Alyce and Helen Thornycroft were artists.

In 1884, Hamo married Agatha Cox (1865–1958), who was fourteen years his junior. At a dinner in 1889, Agatha was introduced to Thomas Hardy, who later described her as &quot;the most beautiful woman in England&quot; and admitted that she was one of the models for the title character in his novel &quot;Tess of the D&#x27;Urbervilles&quot;. Agatha and her husband were interested in the concept of &quot;artistic dress&quot;, and a dress worn by her (presumed to be her wedding dress) is held in the costume collection of the Victoria &amp; Albert Museum, donated by their daughter, Elfrida Mary Manning, née Thornycroft (1901–1987), who was also his biographer.

<text>Cameo () is a method of carving an object such as an engraved gem, item of jewellery or vessel. It nearly always features a raised (positive) relief image; contrast with intaglio, which has a negative image. Originally, and still in discussing historical work, cameo only referred to works where the relief image was of a contrasting colour to the background; this was achieved by carefully carving a piece of material with a flat plane where two contrasting colours met, removing all the first colour except for the image to leave a contrasting background.

A variation of a carved cameo is a cameo incrustation (or sulphide). An artist, usually an engraver, carves a small portrait, then makes a cast from the carving, from which a ceramic type cameo is produced. This is then encased in a glass object, often a paperweight. These are very difficult to make but were popular from the late 18th century through the end of the 19th century. Originating in Bohemia, the finest examples were made by the French glassworks in the early to mid-nineteenth century.

Today the term may be used very loosely for objects with no colour contrast, and other, metaphorical, terms have developed, such as cameo appearance. This derives from another generalized meaning that has developed, the cameo as an image of a head in an oval frame in any medium, such as a photograph.

== Technique ==
Ancient and Renaissance cameos were made from semi-precious gemstones, especially the various types of onyx and agate, and any other stones with a flat plane where two contrasting colours meet; these are &quot;hardstone&quot; cameos. In cheaper modern work, shell and glass are more common. Glass cameo vessels, such as the famous Portland Vase, were also developed by the Romans.

Modern cameos can be produced by setting a carved relief, such as a portrait, onto a background of a contrasting colour. This is called an assembled cameo. Alternatively, a cameo can be carved by the traditional, but far more difficult, method directly out of a material with integral layers or banding, such as (banded) agate or layered glass, where different layers have different colours.

Sometimes dyes are used to enhance these colours. 

While traditional cameos were commonly crafted from onyx and agate, artisans have explored diverse materials over time. Rare examples include ancient cameos cut from precious stones like emeralds, lapis lazuli, and even unusual mediums such as ostrich eggshells, which produce a striking two-tone effect.

==History==

Sir Wallis Budge alleged that the noun &quot;cameo&quot; apparently comes from , a word used in kabbalistic slang to signify a &#x27;magical square&#x27;, i.e. a kind of talisman whereupon magical spells were carved.

Cameos are often worn as jewelry, but in ancient times were mainly used for signet rings and large earrings, although the largest examples were probably too large for this, and were just admired as objets d&#x27;art. Stone cameos of great artistry were made in Greece dating back as far as the 5th century BC. The Farnese Tazza (a cup) is the oldest major Hellenistic piece surviving. They were very popular in Ancient Rome, especially in the family circle of Augustus. The most famous stone &quot;state cameos&quot; from this period are the Gemma Augustea, the Gemma Claudia made for the Emperor Claudius, and the largest flat engraved gem known from antiquity, the Great Cameo of France. Roman cameos became less common around in the years leading up to 300AD, although production continued at a much reduced rate right through the Middle Ages.

The technique has since enjoyed periodic revivals, notably in the early Renaissance, and again in the 18th and 19th centuries. The Neoclassical revival began in France with Napoleon&#x27;s support of the glyptic arts, and even his coronation crown was decorated with cameos. 

Napoleon admired the exquisite craftsmanship of ancient cameos and saw them as emblems of France’s connection to Roman grandeur. He established a school in Paris for cameo making, bringing Sicilian artisans to train young French craftsmen in the glyptic arts, resulting in some of the most innovative cameo work of the period.

In Britain, this revival first occurred during King George III&#x27;s reign, and his granddaughter, Queen Victoria, was a major proponent of the cameo trend, to the extent that they would become mass-produced by the second half of the 19th century. After the death of her husband, Queen Victoria commissioned bejeweled cameos in onyx with portraits of herself and Prince Albert, which she gifted to members of the Royal Order of Victoria and Albert.

The visual art form of the cameo has even inspired at least one writer of more recent times, the 19th-century Russian poet Lev Mei, who composed a cycle of six poems entitled (&quot;Cameos&quot;, 1861), as reflections on each of the Roman rulers from Julius Caesar to Nero. In 1852 Théophile Gautier titled a collection of his highly polished, lapidary poems (&quot;Enamels and Cameos&quot;).

Historical patrons of cameo art included influential collectors like the Earl of Bessborough, who began an extensive collection in the 18th century, later acquired by the Duke of Marlborough. Edward Good’s renowned collection, housed at &#x27;Cameo Corner&#x27; in London, also contributed significantly to the appreciation of cameo craftsmanship, with notable pieces now residing in the British Museum and Sir John Soane&#x27;s Museum.

During the Victorian era, there was a marked revival of shell cameos, particularly made from conch and helmet shells. These Victorian cameos were admired for their delicate softness and intricate carvings, which often depicted mythological figures, famous individuals, or symbolic themes. This era&#x27;s cameos were softer and had a unique texture compared to the more rigid materials used in earlier periods, making them highly prized by collectors.

While the Victorian era popularized large shell cameos, these were often set in bright gold frames that, though eye-catching, sometimes overshadowed the intricate carvings. Wealthier patrons favored gold or silver settings, while the more affordable Pinchbeck frames enabled the middle class to partake in this popular trend.

===Roman glass cameos===

During the Roman period the cameo technique was used on glass blanks, in imitation of objects being produced in agate or sardonyx. Cameo glass objects were produced in two periods; between around 25 BC and 50/60 AD, and in the later Empire around the mid-third and mid-fourth century. Roman glass cameos are rare objects, with only around two hundred fragments and sixteen complete pieces known, only one of which dates from the later period. During the early period they usually consisted of a blue glass base with a white overlying layer, but those made during the later period usually have a colourless background covered with a translucent coloured layer. Blanks could be produced by fusing two separately cast sheets of glass, or by dipping the base glass into a crucible of molten overlay glass during blowing. The most famous example of a cameo from the early period is the Portland Vase.

===Shell cameos===
Although occasionally used in Roman cameos, the earliest prevalent use of shell for cameo carving was during the Renaissance, in the 15th and 16th centuries. Before that time, cameos were carved from hardstone. The Renaissance cameos are typically white on a grayish background and were carved from the shell of a mussel or cowry, the latter a tropical mollusk.

In the mid 18th century, explorations revealed new shell varieties. Helmet shells (&quot;Cassis tuberosa&quot;) from the West Indies, and queen conch shells (&quot;Eustrombus gigas&quot;) from the Bahamas and West Indies, arrived in Europe. This sparked a big increase in the number of cameos that were carved from shells. Conch shells carve very well, but their color fades over time.

After 1850 demand for cameos grew, as they became popular souvenirs of the Grand Tour among the middle class.

===Cameo subjects===
Classically the designs carved onto cameo stones were either scenes of Greek or Roman mythology or portraits of rulers or important dignitaries. In history, agate portrait cameos were often gifts from royalty to their subjects. These antique cameos, some more than 2000 years old, are either displayed in museums or are in private collections.

===Notable historic cameos===

* Gemma Augustea Cameo – Roman, after 10 AD. Two-layered onyx.
* &quot;Tazza Farnese&quot;. An ancient Hellenistic bowl made of a very large cameo and purchased by Lorenzo de&#x27; Medici during the Italian Renaissance.
* Cup of the Ptolemies, a large Roman or Hellenistic vessel.
* Portland Vase, the best known piece of cameo glass.
* Great Cameo of France – Roman, c. 23 AD. Sardonyx.
* Gemma Claudia Cameo – Roman, 49 AD. Five-layered onyx.
* Herophiloska Cameo – Roman, 14 to 37 AD. This portrait of a man with laurel wreath is probably of Emperor Tiberius. The work is signed (&#x27;Herophilus, son of Dioscorides&#x27;). The colour of the glass was intended by the artist to imitate turquoise.
* &quot;Gonzaga Cameo&quot;: Ptolemy II and Arsinoë II. Sardonyx. 3rd century BC.
* Agrippina the Elder Cameo. Carved in Italy in the period of 37–41 AD. The carving is a three layer agate.
* Ptolemaic double cameo — Hellenistic, 278–270/269 BC. Eleven-layered onyx.
* Blacas Cameo: Roman, about 20–50 AD. This head of Augustus was carved from a four-layered sardonyx. It is a fragment of a larger portrait of the Roman emperor-Augustus.
* &quot;The head of Flora Cameo&quot; – Benedetto Pistrucci. 1812 AD. In this cameo the top red-brown layer has been carved into roses. The face is carved from the white layer. The collector Richard Payne Knight purchased the Flora cameo from an Italian dealer, believing it to be Roman. The Italian carver Pistrucci claimed to have carved it himself. Payne challenged Pistrucci to carve a copy to prove his claim. The ensuing publicity earned Pistrucci several commissions.
* Schaffhausen onyx – Roman, Augustan-era, depicting Pax Augusta or Felicitas

==Modern cameos==

Many modern cameos are carved into layered agates. The layers are dyed to create strong color contrasts. The most usual colors used for two-layer stones are white on black, white on blue, and white on red-brown. Three-layer stones are sometimes made. The colors are usually black on white on black. The layers are translucent; this allows the artist to create shading effects by removing material to allow the background layer to show through. This way a very realistic, lifelike quality to a figure can be achieved. For example, thinning the top black layer on a three-layer stone changes its color to shades of brown. Removing material from the white layer creates shades of blue or grey, depending on the color of the base.

===Ultrasonic machine carved cameos===
The majority of modern agate cameos are carved with the aid of the ultrasonic mill. This is a process where multiple copies of a master design can be produced very quickly by pressing a master die onto the agate cameo blank. A film of diamond slurry is used to aid cutting and the die vibrates ultrasonically in a vertical motion. The master is often hand carved by a skilled cameo artist. The result is a cameo that has a satin surface texture described as &quot;freshly fallen snow&quot; (FFS) by Anna Miller. This texture and the lack of any undercutting are used by appraisers as markers to prove that the cameo is machine-made.

===Hand-worked portrait cameos===
These cameos are carved by hand, usually working from photographs of the subject. The fact that there is usually only one copy made means that the tooling costs involved rule out the ultrasonic carving process.

There are very few people working in this field, as this is one of the hardest challenges for any gemstone carver. The combination of a highly developed artistic ability, craft skill and many years of experience are needed to be able to create lifelike portraits.

It is quite rare, these days, for subjects other than portraits to be carved by hand as agate cameos. The traditional themes of classical scenes from mythology or a standard image of a young lady, are more likely to be made with the help of the ultrasonic carving machine as a limited collection of typically 50–200 pieces.

===Shell cameos===
Since the late 19th century, the species most used in good-quality cameos has been &quot;Cypraecassis rufa&quot;, the bullmouth helmet, the shell of which can be up to 6 inches long. In this species, the upper shell layer is whitish, and the lower shell layer is a rich orange-brown. Modern sources for this shell are Madagascar and South Africa. The finest hand-carving of these shells takes place in Italy.

The most highly prized shell for carving is the emperor or queen&#x27;s helmet shell, &quot;Cassis madagascariensis&quot;. This shell has white and dark brown layers and is known as sardonyx shell, and looks similar to the layered agate known as sardonyx. This shell is found in the waters of the Caribbean.
The world center for cameo carving in shell is Torre del Greco, Italy. The shells are first marked with a series of ovals in a process called signing, then cut into oval blanks for the cameo carver. The actual cameo is mainly cut with a metal scraping tool called a &quot;bulino,&quot; an invention of Jewish artisan Antonio Cimeniello. A number of metal gravers are used: flat-faced, round and three-cornered. To speed production, grinding wheels are used to quickly remove excess material. When the details are completed, the shell is then soaked in olive oil, cleaned with soap and water and selectively polished with a hand brush.

==Notable carvers==
*Giovanni Noto (1902–1985)-Torre del Greco, Italy
*Tommaso Saulini (1793–1864)-Rome, Italy
*Luigi Saulini (1819–1883)-Rome, Italy, (son of Tommaso)

<doc id="252942" wikidata="Q1034181" url="?curid=252942" title="Algernon Sidney">
<text>Algernon Sidney or Sydney (15 January 1623 – 7 December 1683) was an English politician, republican political theorist and colonel. A member of the middle part of the Long Parliament and commissioner of the trial of King Charles I of England, he opposed the king&#x27;s execution. Sidney was later charged with plotting against Charles II, in part based on his most famous work, &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;, which was used by the prosecution as a witness at his trial. He was executed for treason. After his death, Sidney was revered as a &quot;Whig patriot—hero and martyr&quot;.

The works of Algernon Sidney, along with those of contemporary John Locke, are considered a cornerstone of western thought. &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; cost Sidney his life. However, the ideas it put forth survived and ultimately culminated in the Glorious Revolution in England and the founding of the United States. Sidney directly opposed the theory of divine right of kings by suggesting ideas such as limited government, voluntary consent of the people and the right of citizens to alter or abolish a corrupt government. &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; has been called &quot;the textbook of the American revolution.&quot;

==Early life==
Sidney&#x27;s father was Robert Sidney, 2nd Earl of Leicester, a direct descendant of John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland and the great-nephew of Sir Philip Sidney. His mother was Dorothy Percy, daughter of Henry Percy, 9th Earl of Northumberland. Sidney was born at Baynard&#x27;s Castle, London, and was raised at Penshurst Place in Kent. His mother wrote to her husband in November 1636 that she had heard their son &quot;much commended by all that comes from you . . . [for] a huge deal of wit and much sweetness of nature&quot;.

==English Civil War and Republic==
Despite having earlier vowed that only &quot;extreme necessity shall make me think of bearing arms in England&quot;, Sidney served in the Army of the Eastern Association, becoming lieutenant colonel of the Earl of Manchester&#x27;s regiment of horse (cavalry). He fought at the Battle of Marston Moor in 1644, where an observer wrote: &quot;Colonel Sidney charged with much gallantry in the head of my Lord Manchester&#x27;s regiment of horses, and came off with many wounds, the true badges of his honor&quot;. He was later appointed colonel of the regiment when it was transferred to the New Model Army, but relinquished the appointment due to ill health.

In 1645 Sidney was elected to the Long Parliament as Member of Parliament for Cardiff where he opposed compromising with the King, Charles I. In 1648 he opposed the purge of moderates who had formed the Rump Parliament. Despite being a commissioner for the trial of Charles, Sidney opposed the decision to execute the king, believing it to be of questionable lawfulness and wisdom. He said in explaining his view:

By 1649 Sidney had changed his opinion, declaring the king&#x27;s execution as &quot;the justest and bravest act ... that ever was done in England, or anywhere&quot;.

In 1653 when Cromwell&#x27;s army entered Parliament to dissolve it after a Bill was introduced that would have made elections freer, Sidney refused to leave the House until threatened with physical removal. He regarded Cromwell as a tyrant.

In retirement, Sidney was bold enough to outrage the Lord Protector by allegedly putting on a performance of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot;, and playing the role of Brutus. He was for a time the lover of Lucy Walter, later the mistress of Charles II. Sidney regarded the Republic as vigorously pursuing England&#x27;s national interests (in contrast to the Stuarts&#x27; record of military failure), writing in his &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;:

==Baltic ambassador==

After Cromwell&#x27;s death in 1658, the army abolished the Protectorate in 1659 and reconvened the Rump Parliament, with Sidney taking up his seat in the Commons. During 1659 and 1660 he was part of a delegation to help arbitrate peace between Denmark and Sweden, as war would threaten England&#x27;s naval supplies, as well as those of the Dutch. The delegation was commanded by Edward Montagu, with Sidney and Sir Robert Honywood. The third planned plenipotentiary, Bulstrode Whitelocke, declined because: &quot;I knew well the overruling temper and height of Colonel Sydney&quot;.

Sidney discarded conventional diplomatic norms (&quot;a few shots of our cannon would have made this peace&quot;) to impose a peace favourable to England. Due to the Swedish king Charles X being unable to immediately receive them, the delegation negotiated with the Dutch on forming a joint fleet to impose peace terms. Charles X complained that the English &quot;wish to command all, as if they were masters&quot;. Sidney in person handed Charles the treaty proposal (already accepted by Denmark), threatening military action. He recorded that Charles &quot;in great choler ... told us, that we made projects upon our fleets, and he, laying his hand upon his sword, had a project by his side&quot;. Sidney would not back down and an observer wrote: &quot;Everyone is amazed how Sidney stood up to him&quot;. But, Montagu planned to go back to England with the fleet, leading Sidney to give &quot;his opinion, [that] for sending away the whole fleet he thought he should deserve to lose his head&quot;.

Despite this curtailment of England&#x27;s influence, Denmark, Sweden, France, England and Holland signed a treaty on 27 May 1660. It was during this period that Sidney signed the visitor&#x27;s book at the University of Copenhagen with: &quot;PHILIPPUS SIDNEY MANUS HAEC INIMICA TYRANNIS ENSE PETIT PLACIDAM CUM LIBERTATE QUIETEM&quot; (&quot;This hand, enemy to tyrants, by the sword seeks peace with liberty&quot;). This expression was incorporated into the Great Seal of Massachusetts in 1780 by an act of legislature during the American Revolutionary War.

==Exile==

Sidney was abroad when the monarchy was restored in 1660. His first reaction to the Restoration of the Stuart monarchy was to write:

Because in 1659 he had defended the execution of Charles I, Sidney thought it wise to remain in exile in Rome. While he was prepared to submit he would not, he wrote, countenance &quot;acknowledgement of our faults, in having bin against this king, or his father. ... I shall be better contented with my fortune, when I see theare was noe way of avoiding it, that is not worse than ruine&quot;. He was saved by a stranger from an assassination attempt. In 1663 during a trip to the Calvinist academy at the University of Geneva, Sidney wrote in the visitor&#x27;s book: &quot;SIT SANGUINIS ULTOR JUSTORUM&quot; (&quot;Let there be revenge for the blood of the just&quot;). In Augsburg in April 1665, he was the target of another assassination attempt.

When in Holland, Gilbert Burnet records, Sidney and other republicans:
In mid-1666 Sidney was in Paris, where he negotiated with the king, Louis XIV. Louis subsequently wrote that Sidney &quot;promised me to produce a great uprising ... but the proposition he put to me to advance him 100,000 ecus ... was more than I wished to expose on the word of a fugitive [so] I offered him [initially] only 20,000&quot;. He remained in France until 1677, when he returned to England.

==&quot;Court Maxims&quot;==
During 1665 and 1666 Sidney wrote &quot;Court Maxims&quot;, in which he argued for a reversal of the Restoration of the monarchy: &quot; ... as death is &quot;the greatest evil that can befall a person, monarchy is the worst evil that can befall a nation&quot;&quot;. Sidney also claimed that an English republic would have a natural &quot;unity of interest&quot; with the Dutch Republic in &quot;extirpat[ing] the two detested families of Stuart and Orange&quot;. This manuscript was not widely known, and &quot;Court Maxims&quot; was not published until 1996.

==Restoration Crisis: 1677–1683==
Sidney returned to England in early September 1677. On his father&#x27;s death, Sidney inherited £5,100, but to obtain his inheritance was forced to bring a lawsuit against his brothers, who as executors of the estate had refused to pay him the money, in the Court of Chancery. Although he won the case the proceedings were lengthy and required him to remain in England for several years. He stayed at Leicester House in London. Here he became involved in politics, with the French ambassador, Paul Barillon writing on 6 October:

Due to his helping gain the fall of Danby in December 1678, Sidney received 500 guineas from the French, getting another 500 guineas the next year. Sidney wished for an alliance of English and Dutch republicans against the Stuart–Orange alliance and told Barillon &quot;that it is an old error to believe that it is against the interest of France to suffer England to become a republic&quot;. Sidney believed that it was a &quot;fundamental principle that the House of Stuart and that of Orange are inseparably united&quot;.

After the dissolution of Charles II&#x27;s last Parliament in 1681, Sidney, according to Burnet, helped write the answer to the king&#x27;s declaration, entitled &quot;A Just and Modest Vindication of the Proceedings of the Two Last Parliaments&quot;: &quot;An answer was writ to the king&#x27;s declaration with great spirit and true judgment. It was at first penned by Sidney. But a new draught was made by Somers, and corrected by Jones&quot;.

Sidney united with Lord Shaftesbury and others in plotting against the perceived royal tyranny, of a &#x27;force without authority.&#x27; Sidney was later to be implicated in the Rye House Plot, a scheme to assassinate Charles and his brother James, who later became King James II.

===Trial and execution===
On 25 June 1683 Sidney&#x27;s arrest warrant was issued. During his arrest his papers were confiscated, including the draft of the &quot;Discourses&quot;. He was tried on 7 November 1683. William Howard, 3rd Baron Howard of Escrick was the only witness, and since the law stated that two witnesses were necessary, the government used the &quot;Discourses&quot; as its second witness. Lord Chief Justice Jeffreys (whose conduct of the trial caused much criticism, then and later) ruled: &quot;Scribere est agere&quot; (&quot;to write is to act&quot;).

Heneage Finch, the Solicitor General, described the &quot;Discourses&quot; as &quot;An argument for the people to rise up in arms against the King&quot;. In response, Sidney said that it was easy to condemn him by quoting his words out of context: &quot;If you take the scripture to pieces you will make all the penmen of the scripture blasphemous; you may accuse David of saying there is no God and of the Apostles that they were drunk.&quot; He argued that he was entitled to write what he chose, as long as he did not publish it. Jeffreys replied that no man has a right to curse the King, in public or in private. Sidney was found guilty of treason and sentenced to death on 26 November. Jeffreys, ill-tempered as ever, said that he hoped God would put Sidney into a proper state to enter the next world &quot;for I see you are not fit for this one&quot;.

In &quot;The Apology of Algernon Sydney, in the Day of his Death&quot;, Sidney wrote that his life&#x27;s work was to:
He petitioned the King for mercy on the grounds of Jeffreys&#x27; unprofessional conduct, and friends and relatives added their pleas: but the King was as implacable as he had been in the case of William Russell, Lord Russell. Sidney now resigned himself to death, remarking coarsely that for all he cared &quot;the King can make a snuffbox from my arse&quot;.

On the scaffold, Sidney argued that his conviction was unlawful, disputing the quality of the evidence against him and pointing out various deviations from proper legal procedure at his trial. He also reiterated his objections to absolute monarchy in &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;, arguing that these did not constitute treason. Still, he observed that he was abstaining from tackling truly &quot;great matters&quot; in this last speech of his, because &quot;We live in an age that makes truth pass for treason&quot;. He concluded by declaring that he was dying for the Good Old Cause.

He was beheaded on 7 December 1683, and his remains were buried at Penshurst.

==&quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot;==

For Sidney absolute monarchy was a great political evil. His &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; (the text for which Sidney lost his life) was written during the Exclusion Crisis, as a response to Robert Filmer&#x27;s &quot;Patriarcha&quot;, a defence of divine right monarchy, first published in 1680. The divine right of kings is a political system in which all powers of government are vested solely in the king and granted to him by God. Under this system, the king acts as God&#x27;s hand on earth. His power extends beyond government into the private religious life of his subjects. Under this system, citizens were often persecuted and imprisoned for their religious beliefs. It is this divine right of kings&#x27; government that Sidney strongly opposed. In 1698, his &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; was published outlining what he believed constituted a valid civil government.

Sidney believed that individuals have the right to choose their own form of government and that, if that government became corrupt, the people retained the power to abolish it and form another. In his own words, &quot;God leaves to man the choice of forms in government ... He who institutes, may also abrogate&quot;.

Sidney also argued that for a valid civil government to exist, it must be formed by general and voluntary consent. Sidney states in his &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; that, &quot;General consent ... is the ground of all just governments&quot;.

Furthermore, Sidney believed that civil government should have limited jurisdiction. He said the, &quot;only ends for which governments are constituted and obedience rendered to them, are the obtaining of justice and protection&quot;. This suggests a limited civil government whose primary purpose is to 1) render legal justice through its court system and 2) provide for the safety of its citizens. We can also conclude from Sidney that, if a government fails to accomplish these basic components, obedience to that government is no longer required.

Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; along with Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises on Government&quot; are recognized as critical works in the founding of the United States of America. The founding fathers read and studied these works during their years as students in the early colonial universities. Thomas Jefferson in particular, is known to have heavily studied and researched the works of Locke and Sidney. The &quot;Discourses Concerning Government&quot; has been called the &quot;textbook of the American Revolution.

==Legacy==
After his death, Sidney was revered as the &quot;Whig patriot—hero and martyr&quot;. Burnet said of Sidney:

Sidney&#x27;s influence on political thought in eighteenth-century Britain and Colonial America was probably second only to that of John Locke among seventeenth-century political theorists. In his study of political theory in Britain from 1689 to 1720, J. P. Kenyon said that Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses&quot; &quot;were certainly much more influential than Locke&#x27;s &quot;Two Treatises&quot;&quot;. The poet James Thomson, in his poem &quot;The Seasons&quot;, praised Sidney as &quot;the British Cassius&quot;, the hero &quot;warmed&quot; by &quot;ancient learning to the enlightened love/Of ancient freedom&quot;.

Sidney&#x27;s reputation suffered a blow when Sir John Dalrymple published his &quot;Memoirs of Great Britain and Ireland&quot; in 1771, which exposed him as a pensioner of Louis XIV. Dalrymple, who had greatly admired Sidney, wrote that he would hardly feel more shame if he had seen his own son run away from a battle.

The Whig MP Charles James Fox described Sidney and Lord Russell as &quot;two names that will, it is hoped, be ever dear to every English heart&quot; and predicted that &quot;when their memory shall cease to be an object of respect and veneration ... English liberty will be fast approaching its final consummation&quot;.

Sidney had a significant effect on the American conception of liberty. He was a hero of John Trenchard and Thomas Gordon, &quot;the best-read and most widely regarded pamphleteers of prerevolutionary times&quot;. In their 1720–1723 essays &quot;Cato&#x27;s Letters&quot;, they adopted Sidney&#x27;s argument that &quot;free men always have the right to resist tyrannical government&quot;; those essays, in turn, inspired the name of the modern libertarian think tank the Cato Institute. Thomas Jefferson believed Sidney and Locke to be the two primary sources for the Founding Fathers&#x27; view of liberty.

John Adams wrote to Jefferson in 1823 on the subject of Sidney:
The Whig historian Thomas Babington Macaulay said of Sidney in 1828:

But in 1848, Macaulay wrote of the Whig opposition to Charles II:

The libertarian philosopher Friedrich Hayek quoted Sidney&#x27;s &quot;Discourses&quot; on the title page of his &quot;The Constitution of Liberty&quot;: &quot;Our inquiry is not after that which is perfect, well knowing that no such thing is found among men; but we seek that human Constitution which is attended with the least, or the most pardonable inconveniences&quot;.

Algernon Sidney is one of the namesakes for Hampden–Sydney College in Virginia. The college formerly used the original spelling of Sidney. He was chosen because of the role his ideas played in moulding the beliefs of the American Revolutionary thinkers.

&quot;Sidney&quot; became widely used as a given name in the United States after the American Revolution due to admiration for Algernon Sidney as a martyr to royal tyranny.

<text>A birthmark is a congenital, benign irregularity on the skin which is present at birth or appears shortly after birth—usually in the first month. Birthmarks can occur anywhere on the skin. They are caused by overgrowth of blood vessels, melanocytes, smooth muscle, fat, fibroblasts, or keratinocytes.

Dermatologists divide birthmarks into two types: pigmented birthmarks and vascular birthmarks. Pigmented birthmarks caused by excess skin pigment cells include: moles, café au lait spots, and Mongolian spots. Vascular birthmarks, also called red birthmarks, are caused by increased blood vessels and include macular stains (salmon patches), hemangiomas, and port-wine stains. A little over 1 in 10 babies have a vascular birthmark present by age 1. Several birthmark types are part of the group of skin lesions known as nevi or naevi, which is Latin for &quot;birthmarks&quot;.

Birthmarks occur as a result of a localized imbalance in factors controlling the development and migration of skin cells. In addition, it is known that vascular birthmarks are not hereditary.

==Pigmented types==

===Mole===

Congenital melanocytic nevus is a type of melanocytic nevus, the medical term for what is colloquially called a &quot;mole&quot;, found in infants at birth. Occurring in about 1% of infants in the United States, it is located in the area of the head and neck 15% of the time, but may occur anywhere on the body. It may appear as light brown in fair-skinned people, to almost black in people with darker skin. Coming in a variety of sizes and appearances, they may be irregular in shape and flat, or raised and lumpy in appearance and feel. Such naevi can also manifest themselves as beauty marks, which most commonly appear on the face, neck or arms.

===Café au lait spot===

Café au lait spot macules may occur anywhere on the body. They are most commonly oval in shape and light brown, or milk coffee, in color. These birthmarks may be present at birth, or appear in early childhood, and do not fade much with age. One or two on an individual is common; however, four or more may be an indicator of neurofibromatosis. In the event of weight gain, the birthmark can stretch with the skin and become larger.

===Mongolian spot ===

A Mongolian blue spot (dermal melanocytosis) is a benign flat congenital birthmark with wavy borders and irregular shape, most common among East Asians and Turkic people (excluding Turks of Asia Minor), and named after Mongolians. It is also extremely prevalent among East Africans and Native Americans. It normally disappears three to five years after birth and almost always by puberty. The most common color is blue, although they can be blue-gray, blue-black or even deep brown.

The Mongolian spot is a congenital developmental condition exclusively involving the skin. The blue colour is caused by melanocytes, melanin-containing cells, that are deep under the skin. Usually, as multiple spots or one large patch, it covers one or more of the lumbosacral area (lower back), the buttocks, sides, and shoulders. It results from the entrapment of melanocytes in the dermis during their migration from the neural crest to the epidermis during embryonic development.

Among those who are not aware of the background of the Mongolian spots, it may sometimes be mistaken for a bruise indicative of child abuse.

==Vascular types==

===Stork bite===
Colloquially called a &quot;stork bite&quot;, &quot;angel&#x27;s kiss&quot; or &quot;salmon patch&quot;, telangiectatic nevus appears as a pink or tanned, flat, irregularly shaped mark on the knee, back of the neck, and/or the forehead, eyelids and, sometimes, the top lip. The skin is not thickened and feels no different from anywhere else on the body; the only difference is in appearance. Nearly half of all babies have such a birthmark.

===Strawberry mark===

An infantile hemangioma, colloquially called a strawberry mark, is a benign self-involuting tumor (swelling or growth) of endothelial cells, the cells that line blood vessels. It usually appears during the first weeks of life and resolves by age 10. It is the most common tumor of infancy.

PHACES Syndrome, a rare condition that often involves brain, heart, and arterial abnormalities, is generally accompanied by the presence of large facial hemangiomas. In such cases, what appears to be a small bruise or birthmark may grow rapidly and take on a puffy appearance in the first days or weeks of life.

===Port-wine stain===
Port-wine stains, also known as nevus flammeus and sometimes mistaken for strawberry marks, are present at birth and range from a pale pink in color, to a deep wine-red. Irregular in appearance, they are usually quite large, and caused by a deficiency or absence in the nerve supply to blood vessels. This causes vasodilation, the dilation of blood vessels, causing blood to pool or collect in the affected area. Over time, port-wine stains may become thick or develop small ridges or bumps, and do not fade with age. Such birthmarks may have emotional or social repercussions. Port-wine stains occur in 0.3% of the population, equally among males and females. They frequently express unilaterally, i.e., on only one side, not crossing the midline of the body. Often on the face, marks on the upper eyelid or forehead may be indicative of a condition called Sturge–Weber syndrome. Additionally, port-wine stains in these locations may be associated with glaucoma and seizures.

==Treatment==
Most birthmarks are harmless and do not require treatment. Pigmented marks can resolve on their own over time in some cases. Vascular birthmarks may require reduction or removal for cosmetic reasons. Treatments include administering oral or injected steroids, dermatological lasers to reduce size and/or color, or dermatologic surgery.

==Historical explanations==
Many explanations were given to explain the origin of birthmarks. Occasionally, it was said that children could be &#x27;marked&#x27; or &#x27;imprinted&#x27; upon by scares or frights given to the mother during the pregnancy, which draws on the outdated theory of maternal impression:

Other explanations claimed that birthmarks shaped like food were the direct result of the mother&#x27;s pregnancy cravings, or the mother touching a certain part of her body during a solar eclipse – her child&#x27;s birthmark will be in the same location.

<text>Fairy chess is the area of chess composition in which there are some changes to the rules of chess. It may involve changes to the board, pieces, or rules to express an idea or theme impossible in orthodox chess. An altered piece used in fairy chess is known as a fairy chess piece. The term &quot;fairy chess&quot; was introduced by Henry Tate in 1914. Thomas R. Dawson (1889–1951), the &quot;father of fairy chess&quot;, invented many fairy pieces and new conditions. He was also problem editor of &quot;Fairy Chess Review&quot; (1930–1951).

Although the term &quot;fairy chess&quot; is sometimes used for games, it is more usually applied in the context of problems. Variations on chess intended to create complete, playable games are more typically referred to as &quot;chess variants&quot;.

== Types of fairy chess problems ==
Types of changed rules in fairy chess problems include:
* &quot;New stipulations:&quot; The alterations most used by fairy chess players, like Thomas Dawson, are new stipulations about mate instead of a direct mate stipulation. Many of them were invented and some became established. Selfmates and helpmates are, in the 21st century, often considered to be orthodox (not fairy) stipulations. Among others are reflexmates and various types of seriesmovers.
* &quot;New conditions:&quot; Encompassing all changes of rules including rules for captures, checks, checkmates, and general movement abilities. Many were invented; some became established, including Circe chess, Madrasi chess, Andernach chess, monochromatic chess, patrol chess, Einstein chess, and Descartes chess.
* &quot;New chess pieces:&quot; Conventional chess pieces are generalized in many ways into fairy chess pieces, such as grasshopper, nightrider, and cannon.
* &quot;Different boards:&quot; One can vary board size from 8×8 to other sizes (10×10, 8×10, or 8x8 unusual board shapes, etc.) or use different geometries: cylinder (vertical and horizontal), anchor ring or torus and others.
There are fairy chess problems that combine some of these changed rules.

All entries in the world championships and in the FIDE Albums are divided into eight sections: (, and ), endgame studies, helpmates, selfmates, fairy chess, retros, and mathematical problems.

Books and pamphlets devoted to fairy chess:
Periodicals devoted to fairy chess:
* &quot;The Problemist Fairy Supplement&quot; (August 1930 – June 1936)
* &quot;Fairy Chess Review&quot; (August 1936 – April 1958)
* &quot;Feenschach&quot;, edited by W. Karsch

<text>The 16th arrondissement of Paris (; ) is the westernmost of the 20 arrondissements of Paris, the capital city of France. Located on the city&#x27;s Right Bank, it is adjacent to the 17th and 8th arrondissements to the northeast, as well as to the suburb of Boulogne-Billancourt, Hauts-de-Seine to the southwest. Across the Seine are the 7th and 15th arrondissements.

Notable sights of the 16th arrondissement include the (at the junction with the 8th and 17th arrondissements) and the , where the stands. This complex is used for three museums and one theatre. Other museums and cultural venues are also located in this arrondissement, including the Louis Vuitton Foundation opened in 2014.

With its ornate 19th-century buildings, large avenues, prestigious schools, museums, and various parks, the 16th arrondissement has long been known as one of French high society&#x27;s favourite places of residence (comparable to London&#x27;s Kensington and Chelsea or Berlin&#x27;s Charlottenburg) to such an extent that the phrase has been associated with great wealth in French popular culture. Indeed, the 16th arrondissement of Paris is France&#x27;s third-richest district for average household income, behind only its 7th arrondissement and the suburb of Neuilly-sur-Seine, both of which are adjacent.

The 16th arrondissement hosts several large sporting venues, including: the , which is the stadium where football club plays its home matches; Stadium, where the French Open tennis championships are held; and , home to the rugby union club. The , the second-largest public park in Paris (behind only the ), is also located in this arrondissement.

==History==
The 16th arrondissement was created by the Law of 16 June 1859 which incorporated the villages (now neighborhoods) of Auteuil, Passy and Chaillot into Paris; these villages had become communes after the French Revolution and had been in the Seine department ever since. When the law of 1859 was drafted, it was planned that these villages would form a new arrondissement that would be numbered the 13th arrondissement, but &quot;The rich and powerful moving in did not like the number. They pulled strings and became the 16th, the unlucky association and postmark being transferred to the blameless but less influential folks around Porte d&#x27;Italie.&quot;

==Geography==

<text>Vespro della Beata Vergine (&quot;Vespers for the Blessed Virgin&quot;), SV 206, is a musical setting by Claudio Monteverdi of the evening vespers on Marian feasts, scored for soloists, choirs, and orchestra. It is an ambitious work in scope and in its variety of style and scoring, and has a duration of around 90 minutes. Published in Venice (with a dedication to Pope Paul V dated 1 September 1610) as (&quot;Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices, and Vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers&quot;), it is sometimes called Monteverdi&#x27;s Vespers of 1610.

Monteverdi composed the music while musician and composer for the Gonzagas, the dukes of Mantua. The libretto is compiled from several Latin Biblical and liturgical texts. The thirteen movements include the introductory &quot;Deus in adiutorium&quot;, five Psalms, four &quot;concertato&quot; motets and a vocal sonata on the &quot;Sancta Maria&quot; litany, several differently scored stanzas of the hymn &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;, and a choice of two Magnificats. A church performance would have included antiphons in Gregorian chant for the specific feast day. The composition demonstrates Monteverdi&#x27;s ability to assimilate both the new &quot;seconda pratica&quot;, such as in the emerging opera, and the old style of the &quot;prima pratica&quot;, building psalms and Magnificat on the traditional plainchant as a cantus firmus. The composition is scored for up to ten vocal parts and instruments including cornettos, violins, viole da braccio, and basso continuo. Monteverdi travelled to Rome to deliver the composition to the Pope in person, and a partbook is held by the Vatican Library.

No performance during the composer&#x27;s lifetime can be positively identified from surviving documents, though parts of the work might have been performed at the ducal chapels in Mantua and at San Marco in Venice, where the composer became director of music in 1613. The work received renewed attention from musicologists and performers in the 20th century. They have discussed whether it is a planned composition in a modern sense or a collection of music suitable for Vespers, and have debated the role of the added movements, instrumentation, keys and other issues of historically informed performance. The first recording of excerpts from the Vespers was released in 1953; many recordings that followed presented all the music printed in 1610. In some recordings and performances, antiphons for a given occasion of the church year are added to create a liturgical vespers service, while others strictly present only the printed music. Monteverdi&#x27;s Vespers are regarded as a unique milestone of music history, at the transition from Renaissance to Baroque.
== History and context ==
=== Monteverdi in Mantua ===
Monteverdi, who was born in Cremona in 1567, was a court musician for the Gonzaga dukes of Mantua from 1590 to 1612. He began as a viol player under Duke Vincenzo Gonzaga and advanced to become &quot;maestro della musica&quot; in late 1601. He was responsible for the duke&#x27;s sacred and secular music, in regular church services and soirées on Fridays, and for extraordinary events. While Monteverdi was court musician in Mantua, the opera genre emerged, first as entertainment for nobility, to become public musical theatre later. The first work now considered as an opera is Jacopo Peri&#x27;s &quot;Dafne&quot; of 1597. In the new genre, a complete story was told through characters; as well as choruses and ensembles, the vocal parts included recitative, aria, and arioso. Monteverdi&#x27;s first opera was &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; which premiered in 1607. The duke was quick to recognise the potential of this new musical form for bringing prestige to those willing to sponsor it.

Monteverdi wrote the movements of the Vespers piece by piece, while responsible for the ducal services which were held at the Santa Croce chapel at the palace. He completed the large-scale work in 1610. He possibly composed the Vespers aspiring to a better position, and the work demonstrates his abilities as a composer in a great variety of styles. The setting was Monteverdi&#x27;s first published sacred composition after his initial publications nearly thirty years before and stands out for its assimilation of both the old and the new styles.

=== Vespers ===
The liturgical vespers is an evening prayer service according to the Catholic &quot;Officium Divinum&quot; (Divine Office). At Monteverdi&#x27;s time, it was sung in Latin, as were all Catholic services then. A vespers service at the time contained five psalms, a hymn and the Magnificat (Mary&#x27;s song of praise). The five psalms for Marian feasts (as well as other female saints) begin with Psalm 110 in Hebrew counting, but known to Monteverdi as Psalmus 109 in the numbering of the Vulgate:

The individual psalms and the Magnificat are concluded by the doxology Gloria Patri. The hymn for Marian feasts was &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;. Variable elements, changing with the liturgical occasion, are antiphons, inserted before each psalm and the Magnificat, which reflect the specific feast and connect the Old Testament psalms to Christian theology. Vespers are traditionally framed by the opening versicle and response from Psalm 70, and the closing blessing.

On ordinary Sundays, the vespers service might be sung in Gregorian chant, while on high holidays, such as the feast day of a patron saint, elaborate concertante music was preferred. In his Vespers, Monteverdi may have offered such music without necessarily expecting that all of it would be performed in a given service.

Monteverdi deviated from the typical vespers liturgy by adding motets (&quot;concerti&quot; or &quot;sacri concentus&quot;) between the psalms. Scholars debate if they were meant to replace antiphons or rather as embellishments of the preceding psalm. Monteverdi also included a Marian litany, &quot;Sancta Maria, ora pro nobis&quot; (Holy Mary, pray for us). All liturgical texts are set using their psalm tones in Gregorian chant, often as a cantus firmus.

Graham Dixon suggests the setting is more suited for the feast of Saint Barbara, claiming, for example, that the texts from the Song of Songs are applicable to any female saint but that a dedication to fit a Marian feast made the work more &quot;marketable&quot;. There are just two Marian songs in the whole work (&quot;Audi coelum&quot; and &quot;Ave maris stella&quot;); and the sonata could easily be rearranged to any saint&#x27;s name.

=== First publication ===
The first mention of the work&#x27;s publication is in a July 1610 letter by Monteverdi&#x27;s assistant, Bassano Casola, to Cardinal Ferdinando Gonzaga, the duke&#x27;s younger son. Casola described that two compositions were in the process to be printed, a six-part mass (&quot;Messa da Capella&quot;) on motifs from Nicolas Gombert&#x27;s &quot;In illo tempore&quot;, and psalms for a vespers setting for the Virgin (&quot;Salmi del Vespro della Madonna&quot;). He described the psalms as &quot;varying and diverse inventions and harmonies over a canto fermo&quot; (cantus firmus), and noted that Monteverdi would travel to Rome to personally dedicate the publication to the Pope in the autumn.

The printing was completed in Venice, then an important centre for music printing. The printing of collections of sacred music in Italy at the period has been described as &quot;a fast-growing and very large and lucrative market&quot;, with around 50 collections in 1610 alone, 36 of them for offices such as Vespers. The publisher was Ricciardo Amadino, who had published Monteverdi&#x27;s opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot; in 1609. While the opera was published as a score, the Vespers music appeared as a set of partbooks. It was published together with Monteverdi&#x27;s mass &quot;Missa in illo tempore&quot;. The cover describes both works: &quot;Sanctissimae Virgini Missa senis vocibus ad ecclesiarum choros, ac Vespere pluribus decantandae cum nonnullis sacris concentibus ad Sacella sive Principum Cubicula accommodata&quot; (Mass for the Most Holy Virgin for six voices for church choirs, and vespers for several voices with some sacred songs, suitable for chapels and ducal chambers).
One of the partbooks contains the basso continuo and provides a kind of short score for the more complicated movements: it gives the title of the Vespers as: &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine da concerto composta sopra canti firmi&quot; (Vesper for the Blessed Virgin for concertos, composed on cantus firmi).

Monteverdi&#x27;s notation is still in the style of Renaissance music, for example regarding the duration of notes and the absence of bar lines. There is no score, but a partbook for each voice and instrument. The corresponding continuo notes the beginnings of text lines, for example Magnificat, &quot;Et exultauit&quot;, &quot;Quia respexit&quot; and &quot;Quia fecit&quot;, and the names of instruments, for example cornetto, trombone and flauto. The initials of a title are embellished, such as the M of Magnificat, and in the voice part, the initials of a cantus firmus line begin with a larger letter, e.g. &quot;E &quot; and &quot;Q &quot;. Sections where the voice or instrument is silent are marked &quot;Tacet.&quot;. The notation poses challenges to editors adopting the current system of notation, which was established about a half-century after Vespers was written.

Monteverdi dedicated the work to Pope Paul V, who had recently visited Mantua, and dated the dedication 1 September 1610. The schedule seems to have resulted in some of the movements being printed in haste and some corrections had to be made. Monteverdi visited Rome, as anticipated, in October 1610 and it is likely that he delivered a copy to the Pope, given that the Papal Library holds an alto partbook. It is not clear whether he was honoured with a papal audience. The alto partbook which the Pope received, with hand-written corrections, survived in the Biblioteca Doria Pamphilij.

Monteverdi later wrote further music for vespers services, in the collection &quot;Selva morale e spirituale&quot;, published in 1641, and in another collection, &quot;Messa e Salmi&quot; (Mass and Psalms) which was published after his death in 1650. There is no indication that any of his publications of sacred music received a second edition.

=== Later publication ===
After the original print, the next time parts from the Vespers were published was in an 1834 book by Carl von Winterfeld devoted to the music of Giovanni Gabrieli. He chose the beginning of the Dixit Dominus and of the Deposuit from the Magnificat, discussing the variety of styles in detail. Luigi Torchi published the Sonata as the first complete movement from the Vespers at the turn of the 20th century. The first modern edition of the Vespers appeared in 1932 as part of Gian Francesco Malipiero&#x27;s edition of Monteverdi&#x27;s complete works. Two years later, Hans F. Redlich published an edition which dropped two psalms, arranged the other movements in different order, and implemented the figured bass in a complicated way. In 1966, Gottfried Wolters edited the first critical edition. Critical editions were published by, among others, Clifford Bartlett in 1986, Jerome Roche in 1994, and Uwe Wolf in 2013, while Antonio Delfino has edited the Vespers for a complete edition of the composer&#x27;s works.

=== Performance ===
The historical record does not indicate whether Monteverdi actually performed the Vespers in Mantua or in Rome, where he was not offered a post. He assumed the position of &quot;maestro di cappella&quot; at the Basilica di San Marco in Venice in 1613 and a performance there seems likely. Church music in Venice is well documented and performers can draw information for historically informed performances from that knowledge, for example that Monteverdi expected a choir of all male voices.

The Vespers is monumental in scale and requires a choir of ten or more vocal parts split into separate choirs, and seven soloists. Solo instrumental parts are written for violin and cornetto. Antiphons preceding each psalm and the Magnificat, sung in plainchant, would vary with the occasion. Some scholars have argued that the Vespers was not intended as a single work but rather as a collection to choose from.

The edition by Hans Redlich was the basis for performances in Zurich in February 1935 and of parts in New York in 1937, followed by Switzerland (mid-1940s), Brussels (1946) and London (on 14 May 1946 at Westminster Central Hall). It was printed in 1949 and used for the first recording in 1953. The first recording of the work with added antiphons was conducted in 1966 by Jürgen Jürgens. More recent performances have usually aimed to provide the complete music Monteverdi published.

== Music ==
=== Structure ===
&quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; is made up of 13 sections. The &quot;Ave maris stella&quot; is in seven stanzas set to different scoring, with interspersed ritornelli. The Magnificat is in twelve movements, which Monteverdi wrote in two versions.

The following table shows the section numbers according to the 2013 edition by Carus, then the function of the section within the Vespers, its text source, and the beginning of the text both in Latin and in English. The column for the voices has abbreviations SATB for soprano, alto, tenor, and bass. A repeated letter means the voice part is divided, for example TT means &quot;tenor1 and tenor2&quot;. The column for instruments often contains only their number, because Monteverdi did not always specify the instruments. The continuo plays throughout but is listed below (as &quot;continuo&quot;) only when it has a role independent of the other instruments or voices. The last column lists the page number of the beginning of the section in the Carus edition.

=== Sections ===
==== 1 Deus in adjutorium meum intende/Domine ad adjuvandum me festina ====
The work opens with the traditional versicle and response for vespers services, the beginning of Psalm 70 (Psalm 69 in the Vulgate), (Make haste, O God, to deliver me). It is sung by a solo tenor, with the response from the same verse, (Make haste to help me, O LORD), sung by a six-part choir. The movement is accompanied by a six-part orchestra with two cornettos, three trombones (which double the lower strings), strings, and continuo.

The music is based on the opening toccata from Monteverdi&#x27;s 1607 opera &quot;L&#x27;Orfeo&quot;, to which the choir sings a falsobordone (a style of recitation) on the same chord. The music has been described as &quot;a call to attention&quot; and &quot;a piece whose brilliance is only matched by the audacity of its conception&quot;.
==== 2 Dixit Dominus ====
The first psalm, Psalm 110, begins with (The LORD said unto my Lord). Monteverdi set it for a six-part choir with divided sopranos and tenors, and six instruments, prescribing . The first tenor begins alone with the cantus firmus. The beginnings of verses are often in falsobordone recitation, leading to six-part polyphonic settings.
==== 3 Nigra sum ====
The first motet begins (I am black, but beautiful), from the Song of Songs. It is written for tenor solo in the new style of monody (a melodic solo line with accompaniment).
==== 4 Laudate pueri ====
Psalm 113 begins (literally: &#x27;Praise, children, the Lord&#x27;; in the KJV: &#x27;Praise ye the Lord, O ye servants of the Lord&#x27;), and contains eight vocal parts and continuo. The second tenor begins alone with the cantus firmus.
==== 5 Pulchra es ====
The second motet begins (You are beautiful) from the Song of Songs. Monteverdi set it for two sopranos, who often sing in third parallels.
==== 6 Laetatus sum ====
The third psalm is Psalm 122, beginning (literally: &#x27;I was glad&#x27;), a pilgrimage psalm. The music begins with a walking bass, which the first tenor enters with the cantus firmus. The movement is based on four patterns in the bass line and includes complex polyphonic settings and duets.
==== 7 Duo Seraphim ====
The third motet begins (Two angels were calling one to the other), a text combined from Isaiah 6:2–3 and the First Epistle of John, 5:7. Monteverdi set it for three tenors. The first part, talking about the two angels, is a duet. When the text turns to the epistle mentioning the Trinity, the third tenor joins. They sing the text &quot;these three are one&quot; in unison. The vocal lines are highly ornamented.
==== 8 Nisi Dominus ====
The fourth psalm, Psalm 127, opens with the words (Except the Lord [build the house]), and is for two tenors singing the cantus firmus and two four-part choirs, one echoing the other in overlapped singing.
==== 9 Audi coelum ====
The fourth motet opens with the words (Hear my words, Heaven), based on an anonymous liturgical poem. It is set for two tenors, who sing in call and response (), and expands to six voices at the word (all).
==== 10 Lauda Jerusalem ====
The fifth psalm, Psalm 147, begins (Praise, Jerusalem), and is set for two three-part choirs (SAB) and tenors singing the cantus firmus.
==== 11 Sonata sopra Sancta Maria ====
The sonata is an instrumental movement with soprano singing of a cantus firmus from the Litany of Loreto (Holy Mary, pray for us), with rhythmic variants. The movement opens with an instrumental section comparable to a pair of pavane and galliard, the same material first in even metre, then in triple metre. The vocal line appears eleven times, while the instruments play uninterrupted virtuoso music reminiscent of vocal parts in the motets.
==== 12 Hymnus: Ave maris stella ====
The penultimate section is devoted to the 8th century Marian hymn &quot;. Its seven stanzas are set in different scoring. The melody is in the soprano in all verses except verse6, which is for tenor solo. Verse1 is a seven-part setting. Verses2 and3 are the same vocal four-part setting, verse2 for choir1, verse3 for choir3. Similarly, verses4 and5 are set for soprano, first soprano1, then soprano2. Verses1 to5 are all followed by the same ritornello for five instruments. Verse7 is the same choral setting as verse1, followed by Amen.

The hymn setting has been regarded as conservative, the chant melody in the upper voice throughout, but variety is achieved by different numbers of voices and interspersion of a ritornello. The instruments are not specified, to provide further variety. The last stanza repeats the first for formal symmetry.
==== 13 Magnificat ====
The last movement of a vespers service is the Magnificat. Monteverdi devotes a movement to every verse of the canticle, and two to the doxology. Depending on the mood of the text, the Magnificat is scored for a choir of up to seven voices, in solo, duo, or trio singing. Monteverdi uses the Magnificat tone in every movement, a tone similar to the psalm tones but with an &quot;initium&quot; (beginning) which provides the possibility of more harmonic variety.

The publication contains a second setting of the Magnificat for six voices and continuo accompaniment.

== Analysis ==
Monteverdi achieved a collection of great variety both in style and structure, which was unique at the time. Styles range from chordal falsobordone to virtuoso singing, from recitative to polyphonic setting of many voices, and from continuo accompaniment to extensive instrumental obbligato. Structurally, he demonstrated different organisation in all movements.

John Butt, who conducted a recording in 2017 with the Dunedin Consort using one voice per part, summarised the many styles:
Butt described the first three psalms as radical in style, while the other two rather follow the polychoral style of Gabrieli, suggesting that the first three may have been composed especially with the publication in mind.

The musicologist Jeffrey Kurtzman observed that the five free concertos (or motets) follow a scheme to first increase then decrease the number of singers, from one to three and back to one, but they increase the number of performers from the first to the last, adding more voices at the end of the fourth and having eight instruments play for the last. In prints by other composers, such concertos appear as a group, usually sorted by number of voices, while Monteverdi interspersed them with the psalms.

In Monteverdi&#x27;s time, it was common to improvise and make adjustments during performances, depending on the acoustics and the availability and capability of performers. The print of his Vespers shows unusual detail in reducing this freedom, for example, by precise notation of embellishments and even organ registration.

==Recordings==
The first recording of the Vespers was arguably an American performance in 1952, featuring musicians from the University of Illinois conducted by Leopold Stokowski. The recording was released in LP format, probably in 1953, but appears not to have been commercially distributed. The work has since been recorded many times in several versions, involving both modern and period instruments. Some recordings allocate the voice parts to choirs, while others use the &quot;one voice per part&quot; concept.

In 1964, John Eliot Gardiner assembled a group of musicians to perform the work in King&#x27;s College Chapel, Cambridge. The event became the birth of the later Monteverdi Choir. Gardiner recorded the Vespers twice, in 1974 and in 1989.

Although some musicologists argue that Monteverdi was offering a compendium of music for vespers services from which a selection could be made, most recordings present the composition as a unified work, deciding which of the two versions of scoring to perform. Recordings differ in presenting strictly what Monteverdi composed, or in liturgical context, with added antiphons for a specific feast day. In his 2005 version, Paul McCreesh also included music from other publications and changed the order of several movements.

== Modern reception ==
Kurtzman, who edited a publication of the work for Oxford University Press, notes: &quot;...it seems as if Monteverdi were intent in displaying his skills in virtually all contemporary styles of composition, using every modern structural technique&quot;. Monteverdi achieved overall unity by using the Gregorian plainchant as a cantus firmus, for the beginning, the psalms, the litany and the Magnificat. This &quot;rigorous adhesion to the psalm tones&quot; is similar to the style of Giovanni Giacomo Gastoldi, who was choirmaster at the Basilica palatina di Santa Barbara at the ducal palace in Mantua. Whenham summarised about the use of chant:
Musicologists have debated topics such as the role of the &quot;sacri concentus&quot; and &quot;sonata&quot;, instrumentation, keys (&quot;chiavette&quot;), and issues of historically informed performance.
The musicologist Tim Carter summarised in his entry for the composer for &quot;Grove&quot; in 2007: &quot;His three major collections of liturgical and devotional music transcend the merely functional, exploiting a rich panoply of text-expressive and contrapuntal-structural techniques.&quot; Kurtzmann concluded from his detailed research of Monteverdi&#x27;s &quot;Vespro della Beata Vergine&quot; and contemporary sacred music:

<doc id="252951" wikidata="Q6947820" url="?curid=252951" title="Mynga Futrell">
<text>Mynga Futrell (born 1944) is an American activist who cofounded the international constituency of Brights. Her varied pursuits center around civic pluralism (boosting social acceptance, civic engagement and equity for citizens who have supernatural-free worldviews).

== Early life and education ==
Although born in Harlan, Kentucky, Futrell grew up in Kentucky’s bluegrass region where her father chaired (1928-1966) the geography-geology department at the local college (now Eastern Kentucky University). For elementary and secondary levels, she attended the campus laboratory school and, after graduating (1962), she pursued undergraduate studies, graduating with a double major in Chemistry and Earth Science (B.S., 1966). Futrell carried out graduate studies (1970–74) at the University of Wyoming. She holds an M.S. (1972) in Natural Science and a Ph.D. (1974) in Curriculum and Instruction with a specialization in Science Education.

== Career and activism ==
Futrell is co-founder (with husband, Paul Geisert) of the Brights movement. She authored the definition of “a bright” and established an international online registry and organizational hub. The nonprofit Brights’ Net encourages persons who have a &quot;naturalistic&quot; (free-of-supernatural) &quot;worldview&quot; to be visible and to engage constructively in civic endeavors.

Futrell’s freethought activism is marked by her co-founding several additional nonprofit organizations:

1993: Atheists and Other Freethinkers

2002: “Freethought Day” (now California Freethought Day)

2014: Reason Center

She has served on the boards of directors of the American Humanist Association and the Atheist Alliance and on the advisory board of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

An educator at levels of instruction from elementary classroom through university professor, Futrell was a tenured Associate Professor at Gallaudet University in Washington, DC. She has also co-authored several books including, &quot;The Well-Trained Computer: Designing Systematic Instructional Materials for the Classroom Microcomputer&quot; (1984), &quot;Teachers, Computers, and Curriculum: Microcomputers in the Classroom&quot;, and &quot;Different Drummers: Nonconforming Thinkers in History&quot; (1999).

Activism in the education field includes serving on the advisory council of the California 3Rs (rights, respect, responsibility) religious liberty project for teachers initiated by the First Amendment Center. Futrell developed Worldview Education: Teaching about Religion in Support of Civic Pluralism, a religion-neutral professional web resource for educators.

<doc id="252953" wikidata="Q3074567" url="?curid=252953" title="Method of Fluxions">
<text>Method of Fluxions () is a mathematical treatise by Sir Isaac Newton which served as the earliest written formulation of modern calculus. The book was completed in 1671 and posthumously published in 1736.
==Background==
Fluxion is Newton&#x27;s term for a derivative. He originally developed the method at Woolsthorpe Manor during the closing of Cambridge due to the Great Plague of London from 1665 to 1667. Newton did not choose to make his findings known (similarly, his findings which eventually became the &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; were developed at this time and hidden from the world in Newton&#x27;s notes for many years). Gottfried Leibniz developed his form of calculus independently around 1673, seven years after Newton had developed the basis for differential calculus, as seen in surviving documents like “the method of fluxions and fluents...&quot; from 1666. Leibniz, however, published his discovery of differential calculus in 1684, nine years before Newton formally published his fluxion notation form of calculus in part during 1693.

==Impact==
The calculus notation in use today is mostly that of Leibniz, although Newton&#x27;s dot notation for differentiation formula_1 is frequently used to denote derivatives with respect to time.

==Rivalry with Leibniz==
Newton&#x27;s &quot;Method of Fluxions&quot; was formally published posthumously, but following Leibniz&#x27;s publication of the calculus a bitter rivalry erupted between the two mathematicians over who had developed the calculus first, provoking Newton to reveal his work on fluxions.

==Newton&#x27;s development of analysis==
For a period of time encompassing Newton&#x27;s working life, the discipline of analysis was a subject of controversy in the mathematical community. Although analytic techniques provided solutions to long-standing problems, including problems of quadrature and the finding of tangents, the proofs of these solutions were not known to be reducible to the synthetic rules of Euclidean geometry. Instead, analysts were often forced to invoke infinitesimal, or &quot;infinitely small&quot;, quantities to justify their algebraic manipulations. Some of Newton&#x27;s mathematical contemporaries, such as Isaac Barrow, were highly skeptical of such techniques, which had no clear geometric interpretation. Although in his early work Newton also used infinitesimals in his derivations without justifying them, he later developed something akin to the modern definition of limits in order to justify his work.

<text>Robert Stephenson , (16 October 1803 – 12 October 1859) was an English civil engineer and designer of locomotives. The only son of George Stephenson, the &quot;Father of Railways&quot;, he built on the achievements of his father. Robert has been called the greatest engineer of the 19th century. Stephenson&#x27;s death was widely mourned, and his funeral afforded marks of public honour. He is buried in Westminster Abbey.

==Early life==
Robert Stephenson was born on 16 October 1803, at Willington Quay, east of Newcastle upon Tyne, to George Stephenson and Frances ( Henderson), usually known as Fanny. She was twelve years older than George, and when they met she was working as a servant where George was lodging. After marrying, George and Fanny lived in an upper room of a cottage; George worked as a brakesman on the stationary winding engine on the Quay, and in his spare time he cleaned and mended clocks and repaired shoes.In 1804, George became a brakesman at the West Moor Pit, and the family moved to Killingworth. Fanny&#x27;s health deteriorated, and she died on 14 May 1806. Robert was first sent to a village school away in Long Benton. George had received little formal education but was determined that his son would have one and so sent the eleven-year-old Robert to be taught at the Percy Street Academy in Newcastle. Robert became a member of the Newcastle Literary and Philosophical Society and borrowed books for him and his father to read. In the evenings, he would work with his father on designs for steam engines. In 1816 they made a sundial together, which is still in place above the cottage door.

After leaving school in 1819, Stephenson was apprenticed to the mining engineer Nicholas Wood, manager of Killingworth colliery. As an apprentice Stephenson worked hard and lived frugally, and unable to afford to buy a mining compass, he made one that he would later use to survey the High Level Bridge in Newcastle.
==Personal life==
In 1829, Stephenson married Frances Sanderson; the couple had no children, and he did not remarry after her death in 1842. In 1847, he was elected Member of Parliament for Whitby, and held the seat until his death. Stephenson declined a British knighthood, for unstated reasons, as his father had before him. He did accept several non-British honours: He was decorated in Belgium with the Knight of the Order of Leopold, in France with the Knight of the Legion of Honour and in Norway with the Knight Grand Cross of the order of St Olaf. He was elected a Fellow of the Royal Society (FRS) in 1849. A later fellow of the society was Robert Stephenson Smyth Baden-Powell, who was Stephenson&#x27;s godson and named after him. Stephenson also served as President of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers and of the Institution of Civil Engineers. Oxford University conferred an honorary Doctor of Civil Law degree on Stephenson.

==Early career==
===Stockton and Darlington Railway===

Ways were investigated in the early 19th century to transport coal from the mines in the Bishop Auckland area to Darlington and the quay at Stockton-on-Tees, and canals had been proposed. The Welsh engineer George Overton suggested a tramway, surveyed a route in September 1818 and the scheme was promoted by Edward Pease at a meeting in November. A private bill for a Stockton and Darlington Railway (S&amp;DR) was presented to Parliament in 1819 but was opposed by landowners and did not pass. The route was changed, Overton carried out another survey and an act of Parliament, the Stockton and Darlington Railway Act 1821 (1 &amp; 2 Geo. 4. c. xliv), received royal assent on 19 April 1821; Pease and George Stephenson met for the first time in Darlington that same day, and by 23 July George had been appointed to make a fresh survey of the line.

Stephenson had not completed his apprenticeship, but he was showing symptoms of tuberculosis, and his work was hazardous; he was down West Moor Pit when there was an underground explosion. Wood agreed to release the 18-year-old so that he could assist his father during the survey. By the end of 1821 they reported that a usable line could be built within the bounds of the act of Parliament, but another route would be shorter and avoid deep cuttings and tunnels. George was elected engineer by shareholders with a salary of £660 per annum. He advocated the use of steam locomotives, Pease visited Killingworth in the summer of 1822, and the directors visited Hetton colliery railway, on which George had also introduced locomotives. During the survey of the George had been persuaded, mainly by the Scottish engineer Robert Bald, that Robert would benefit from a university education. George could have afforded to send his son to a full degree course at Cambridge but agreed to a short academic year as he wished that Robert should not become a gentleman but should work for his living. Robert first helped William James to survey the route of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway and then attended classes at Edinburgh University between October 1822 and April 1823.

On 23 May 1823, a second act of Parliament, the Stockton and Darlington Railway Act 1823 (4 Geo. 4. c. xxxiii), received royal assent with the Stephensons&#x27; deviations from the original route and permission for the use of &quot;loco-motives or moveable engines&quot;. In June 1823 the Stephensons and Pease opened Robert Stephenson and Company at Forth Street in Newcastle to build these locomotives, Pease lending Robert £500 so he could buy his share. As George was busy supervising the building of the railway, Robert was placed in charge of the works with a salary of £200 per annum. Robert also surveyed the route and designed the Hagger Leases branch, which was planned to serve the collieries at Butterknowle and Copley Bent. A new act of Parliament was required for the line, and Robert stayed in London for five weeks while the bill passed through its parliamentary process, with royal assent being given to the Stockton and Darlington Railway Act 1824 (5 Geo. 4. c. xlviii) in May 1824. The ordered two steam locomotives and two stationary engines from Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. on 16 September 1824, and the railway opened on 27 September 1825.

===Colombian mines===
On 18 June 1824, Stephenson sailed on the &quot;Sir William Congreve&quot; from Liverpool for South America with a contract for three years. At that time Colombia and Venezuela had not been independent of Spain for long, and they were both part of the same republic, Gran Colombia. The area&#x27;s natural resources were attracting some British investors, including the Colombian Mining Association which had been formed to reopen gold and silver mines worked by the Spanish in colonial times. A Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. partner, Thomas Richardson, was a promoter. Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. received orders for steam engines from the company, and Richardson suggested to Stephenson that he go to South America.

To prepare for the trip, Stephenson took Spanish lessons, visited mines in Cornwall, and consulted a doctor, who advised that such a change of climate would be beneficial to his health. After a five-week journey Robert arrived at the port of La Guayra in Venezuela on 23 July 1824. He investigated building a breakwater and pier at the harbour, and a railway to Caracas. A railway linking Caracas to its port was an ambitious project as Caracas is nearly 1,000 meters above sea level: one was not completed until the 1880s. Stephenson had potential backers for his railway in London, but he concluded that while the cost of a pier, estimated at £6,000, would be sustainable, that of a breakwater or railway would not.
He travelled overland to Bogotá, arriving on 19 January 1825. Travelling onward, Robert found the heavier equipment at Honda on the Magdalena River; there was no way to get it to the mines as the only route was a narrow and steep path. The mines were another from Mariquita, and Stephenson set up home at Santa Ana in a bungalow. The Mining Association sent Cornish miners to work the mine, but they proved difficult to manage and drank so heavily that only two-thirds were available for work on any given day. They refused to accept that Stephenson, who had not been brought up in Cornwall, could know anything about mining. 

His contract ended on 16 July 1827. He travelled to Cartagena to see if he could walk across the Panama Isthmus, but this proved too difficult. While waiting for a ship to New York, he met the railway pioneer Richard Trevithick, who had been looking for South American gold and silver in the mines of Peru and Costa Rica, and gave him £50 so he could buy passage home. 

Stephenson caught a ship to New York; en route this picked up shipwrecked survivors that were so weak they had to be winched aboard, before the ship he was on sank in another storm. Everyone was saved, but Stephenson lost his money and luggage. He noticed that one second-class passenger was given priority over first-class passengers in the lifeboats: the captain later said privately that he and the passenger were Freemasons and had sworn an oath to show such preference to each other in times of peril. Stephenson was impressed and became a Freemason in New York. Wishing to see something of North America, he and four other Englishmen walked the to Montreal via Niagara Falls. He returned to New York, caught the packet &quot;Pacific&quot; across the Atlantic and arrived in Liverpool at the end of November 1827.

===Locomotive designer===
In 1827 George was working as the chief engineer of the Liverpool and Manchester Railway (L&amp;MR). He had built the &quot;Experiment&quot; locomotive with sloping cylinders instead of the vertical ones on previous locomotives. Robert wanted to improve the way the wheels were driven and had a chance when an order arrived in January 1828 from the L&amp;MR. The &quot;Lancashire Witch&quot; was built with inclined cylinders that allowed the axles to be sprung, but the L&amp;MR withdrew the order in April; by mutual agreement the locomotive was sold to the Bolton and Leigh Railway. Several similar locomotives with four or six wheels were built in the next two years, one being sent to the US for the Delaware and Hudson Canal Company. As well as working at the locomotive works, Robert was also surveying routes for railways and advised on a tunnel under the River Mersey.
In March 1828 Robert wrote to a friend saying he had an attraction to Broad Street in London as Frances (Fanny) Sanderson lived there. Robert and Fanny had known each other before he had gone to South America, and after calling on her soon after returning he had an invitation from her father to be a frequent visitor. He introduced her to his father in August 1828, and she accepted his proposal of marriage at the end of that year. Robert spent so much time in London the following year that his partners accused him of neglecting his business. Robert had not wished for a long engagement, but it took some time until a suitable house was found at 5 Greenfield Place in Newcastle, and Robert and Fanny married in London on 17 June 1829.

The L&amp;MR directors had not decided whether to use fixed engines with ropes or steam locomotives and resolved to hold trials to see if a steam locomotive would meet their requirements. The trials were to be held at a two-mile (3.2 km) double-track railway that was to be built at Rainhill. Robert designed the locomotive for the trials during the summer of 1829. Only two of the wheels were driven, as experience had shown that wrought-iron wheels had a high rate of wear that quickly resulted in wheels of different size, and gears were provided for both forward and reverse running . The performance-enhancing idea to heat water using many small diameter tubes through the boiler was communicated to Robert via a letter from his father who heard about it from Henry Booth and Marc Seguin . With both George and Booth in Liverpool, Robert was responsible for the detail design, and he fitted twenty-five diameter tubes from a separate firebox through the boiler. In September the &quot;Rocket&quot; locomotive was sent to Rainhill where it was coupled with its tender.

The Rainhill trials started on 6 October, and between 10,000 and 15,000 people had assembled to watch. Five locomotives had arrived, but &quot;Perseverance&quot; did not compete, having been damaged on the way to Rainhill, and &quot;Cyclops&quot;, powered by two horses in a frame, was not a serious entry. Challenging &quot;Rocket&quot; was &quot;Novelty&quot;, built by John Ericsson and John Braithwaite in London, and &quot;Sans Pareil&quot;, built at the Shildon railway works by Timothy Hackworth, the locomotive supervisor of the S&amp;DR. On 8 October at 10:30 am &quot;Rocket&quot; started its journey forwards and backwards across the course. &quot;Rocket&quot; covered the first 35 miles in 3 hours and 12 minutes. Then, it took a 15 minutes break for replenishing its coke and water supplies before completing the course in another 2 hours 57 minutes. It had run at an average speed of , and the highest speed reached was over . &quot;Sans Pareil&quot; was found to be overweight but was allowed to run. She burnt fuel at more than three times the rate of &quot;Rocket&quot; before her boiler ran dry. &quot;Novelty&quot; was tried again the following day, was withdrawn after a joint failed again, and &quot;Rocket&quot; was declared the winner.

The L&amp;MR purchased &quot;Rocket&quot; and ordered four similar locomotives from Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. before the end of October. Four more similar locomotives followed, before &quot;Planet&quot; was delivered on 4 October 1830 with cylinders placed horizontally under the boiler. Hackworth was building &quot;Globe&quot; at the Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. works at the same time, and Edward Bury delivered &quot;Liverpool&quot; the same month, both with cylinders under the boiler. It has been alleged that Stephenson copied Hackworth or Bury; he later said he had no knowledge of &quot;Liverpool&quot; at the time he was designing &quot;Planet&quot;. &quot;John Bull&quot;, a &quot;Planet&quot; type locomotive, was shipped to the US and became the first movement by steam on a railway in New Jersey when it ran on the Camden and Amboy Railroad in 1831. So many orders for locomotives were received that Stephenson proposed in 1831 to open a second locomotive works. It was agreed that the Stephenson name would not be attached to any other works, and what was to become the Vulcan Foundry was developed at Newton-le-Willows.

==Civil engineer==
===George Stephenson and Son===
George Stephenson &amp; Son had been created on the last day of 1824, when Robert was in South America, with the same partners as Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. Formed to carry out railway surveys and construction, George and Robert were both listed as chief engineers and responsible for Parliamentary business, and the list of assistant engineers included Joseph Locke, John Dixon, Thomas Longridge Gooch and Thomas Storey. The company took on too much work that was delegated to inexperienced and underpaid men.

Soon after he had returned from America, Robert took over responsibility for overseeing the construction of the Canterbury &amp; Whitstable Railway, and this opened on 3 May 1830 with a locomotive similar to &quot;Rocket&quot; called &quot;Invicta&quot;, supplied by Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. He was also responsible for two branches of the L&amp;MR, the Bolton &amp; Leigh and Warrington &amp; Newton railways. The Leicester &amp; Swannington Railway was built to take coal from the Long Lane colliery to Leicester, and Stephenson was appointed engineer. Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. supplied &quot;Planet&quot; type locomotives, but these were found underpowered and were replaced in 1833.

===London and Birmingham Railway===
On 18 September 1830 George Stephenson &amp; Son signed a contract to survey the route for the London and Birmingham Railway. George recommended the route via Coventry, rather than an alternative via Oxford, but it was Robert that did most of the work; that same year Robert joined the Institution of Civil Engineers as a member. There were two surveys in 1830–31 which met opposition from landowners and those who lived in market towns on the coach route that would be bypassed. Robert stood as the engineering authority when a bill was presented to Parliament in 1832, and it was suggested during cross-examination that he had allowed too steep an angle on the side of the cutting at Tring. Remembering that Thomas Telford had cut through similar ground at Dunstable, Robert left with Gooch in post-chaise that night, and arrived at the cutting at dawn to find it the same angle he had proposed. He returned and was in the company solicitor&#x27;s office at 10 am. That year the bill passed through the Commons but was defeated in the Lords. After a public campaign and another survey by Robert, the necessary act of Parliament, the London and Birmingham Railway Act 1833 (3 &amp; 4 Will. 4. c. xxxvi), was obtained on 6 May 1833, and it was Robert, not yet 30 years old, that signed the contract on 20 September 1833 to build the railway from Camden Town to Birmingham.
Robert was awarded a salary of £1,500 plus £200 expenses per annum, and he and Fanny moved from Newcastle to London. He drew up plans and made detailed work estimates, dividing the line into 30 contracts, most of which were placed by October 1835. A drawing office with 20–30 draughtsmen was established at the empty Eyre Arms Hotel in St John&#x27;s Wood; George Parker Bidder, whom Robert had first met at Edinburgh University, started working for him there. Primrose Hill Tunnel, Wolverton embankment, and Kilsby Tunnel all had engineering problems and were completed using direct labour. 

The line permitted by the 1833 act of Parliament terminated north of Regent&#x27;s Canal at Camden (near Chalk Farm Underground station), as Baron Southampton, who owned the land to the south, had strongly opposed the railway in the House of Lords in 1832. Later Southampton changed his mind, and authority was gained for an extension of the line south over Regent&#x27;s Canal to Euston Square. This incline, with a slope between 1 in 75 and 1 in 66, was worked by a stationary engine at Camden − trains from Euston were drawn up by rope, whereas carriages would descend under gravity. The oft repeated statement that the rope-working was necessary because locomotives of the period were insufficiently powerful was denied in 1839 by Peter Lecount, one of the assistant engineers. In fact the incline was worked by locomotives from the opening date of the southern section of the line, 20 July 1837, until 14 October 1837, also whenever the stationary engine or rope were stopped for repairs, then for Mail Trains from November 1843, and entirely from 15 July 1844, without any real increase in the power of the locomotives. The reason given by Lecount for the rope working was the London and Birmingham Railway Act 1833, by which he said they were &#x27;restricted ... from running locomotive engines nearer London than Camden Town.&#x27; 

The L&amp;BR opened ceremonially on 15 September 1838. Construction had taken four years and three months, but had cost £5.5 million against the original estimate of £2.4 million.

===Great George Street===
In 1835 Robert travelled with his father to Belgium. George had been invited to advise King Leopold on the Belgian State Railway and was decorated with the Order of Leopold; Robert returned with his father two years later to celebrate the opening of the railway between Brussels and Ghent. By agreement with the L&amp;BR, Robert was not permitted to work on any other engineering project while the railway was being built, but he was permitted to act as consultant.

The Stephenson valve gear was developed in 1842 by Stephenson employees in Newcastle. The six-coupled Stephenson long-boiler locomotive design was developed into a successful freight locomotive but was unsuitable for sustained high speeds.

The Stanhope and Tyne Railroad Company (S&amp;TR) had been formed in 1832 as a partnership to build a railway between the lime kilns at Lanehead Farmhouse and the coal mines at Consett in County Durham. The partners had decided to build a railway instead of upgrading the existing Pontop Waggonway, and commissioned Robert as surveyor and consulting engineer, and with Thomas Elliot Harrison as acting engineer, construction started at Stanhope in July 1832, and the line opened in 1834. Instead of obtaining an act of Parliament the company had agreed wayleaves with the land owners, requiring payment of rent. The company borrowed heavily, and the debt grew to £440,000; by 1840 the lime kilns and the section from Stanhope to Carrhouse had closed, and the remaining Stanhope to Annfield section was losing money. A creditor sent a bill to Stephenson that the railway company could not pay, and Robert found that as the S&amp;TR was not a limited company, shareholders were liable for the debt. Fearing financial ruin Robert sought the advice of Parker, the insolvent railway company was dissolved on 5 February 1841 and a new limited company, the Pontop and South Shields Railway, was created to take over the line, Robert contributing £20,000. The southern section from Stanhope to Carrhouse was sold to the Derwent Iron Company at Consett. The Great North of England Railway opened in 1841 to York with a railway connection at Darlington to London, and the Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway (N&amp;DJR) was formed to extend this line to Newcastle using five miles of the Pontop and South Shields Railway. George Hudson, a railway financier known as the &quot;Railway King&quot;, was the chairman of the N&amp;DJR, and Robert was appointed engineer.

Some work still needed to be completed on the L&amp;BR, and the North Midland Railway and lines from Ostend to Liège and Antwerp to Mons in Belgium required Robert&#x27;s attention. In 1839 he visited France, Spain and Italy for three months to advise on railways, meeting the leading French railway engineer Paulin Talabot. When he returned he was in demand, travelling the country, giving evidence to Parliament and was often asked to arbitrate in disputes between railway companies and their contractors.

Robert, like his father, planned a railway line that avoided gradients as much as possible, extending the route if necessary, and proposed such a route for a line between London and Brighton, but an alternative was selected. In August 1841 Robert was made Knight of the Order of Leopold for his improvements to locomotive engines. 

In the summer of 1842 Robert was away working on the N&amp;DJR, in September in Cardiff and then in London working on a report for the French Railways. Fanny had been diagnosed with cancer two years previously and she grew seriously ill at the end of the month. She died on 4 October 1842. Her wish was that Robert remarry and have children, but he stayed single for the rest of his life. Her funeral was on 11 October, and Robert returned to work the following day, although he was to visit to her grave for many years.

===Cambridge Square===
Robert grew to dislike the house on Haverstock Hill after the death of his wife. He moved to Cambridge Square in Westminster to be nearer to London&#x27;s gentlemen&#x27;s clubs, but soon afterwards the house was damaged by fire and he lived in temporary accommodation for ten months. The Newcastle and Darlington Junction Railway opened on 18 June 1844. A special train left Euston at 5:03 am, and travelling via Rugby, Leicester, Derby, Chesterfield and Normanton, reached Gateshead, south of the River Tyne, at 2:24 pm. Festivities were held in the Newcastle Assembly Rooms, where George was introduced as the man who had &quot;constructed the first locomotive that ever went by its own spontaneous movement along iron rails&quot;, although there were people present who should have known better.

When George had built the Stockton &amp; Darlington and Liverpool &amp; Manchester he had placed the rails apart, as this was the gauge of the railway at the Killingworth Colliery. Isambard Kingdom Brunel, chief engineer to the Great Western Railway, had adopted the or broad gauge, arguing that this would allow for higher speeds. Railways built with the different gauges met for the first time at Gloucester in 1844, and although an inconvenience to passengers, this became a serious problem for goods, with delays and packages being lost at Gloucester. In 1845 a Royal Commission was appointed and of the forty-six witnesses that gave evidence, only Brunel and his colleagues at the Great Western supported the broad gauge. Comparisons between a Stephenson locomotive between York and Darlington and one built by Brunel between Paddington and Didcot showed the broad gauge locomotive to be superior, but the commissioners found in favour of a gauge, due in part to the greater number of route miles that had already been laid. Brunel also supported propelling trains using the atmospheric system. Robert sent assistants to the Dalkey Atmospheric Railway in Ireland to observe, but advised against its use as the failure of one pump would bring traffic to a stop.

Robert&#x27;s stepmother Elizabeth had died in 1845. That year George was returning ill from a trip to Spain and suffered an attack of pleurisy in the cabin of the packet bound for Southampton. He retired to Tapton House, near Chesterfield, and married his housekeeper early in 1848. Later that year he died on 12 August following a second attack of pleurisy, and was buried in Trinity churchyard, in Chesterfield. George had been the President of the newly formed Institution of Mechanical Engineers, and Robert took over that role until 1853.

===Bridge builder===

The Chester &amp; Holyhead Railway received its permission in 1845, and Robert became the chief engineer and designed an iron bridge to cross the River Dee just outside Chester. Completed in September 1846, it was inspected by the Board of Trade Inspector, Major-General Paisley, on 20 October. On 24 May 1847 the bridge gave way under a passenger train; the locomotive and driver made it across, but the tender and carriages fell into the river. Five people died. Conder attended the inquest at Chester: he recounts that Paisley was so agitated he was nearly unable to speak; Robert was pale and haggard and the foreman of the jury seemed determined to get a verdict of manslaughter. Robert had been prepared to admit liability but was persuaded to present a defence that the cast-iron girder could only have fractured because the tender had derailed from a broken wheel. Robert was supported by expert witnesses such Locke, Charles Vignoles, Gooch and Kennedy, and a verdict of accidental death was returned. Robert never used long cast-iron girders again, and a Royal Commission was later set up to look at the use of cast iron by the railway companies.

The Britannia Bridge was built for the Chester &amp; Holyhead Railway to cross the Menai Strait from Wales to the island of Anglesey. The bridge needed to be long, and the Admiralty insisted on a single span above the water. Problems during the launch of the wrought-iron steamship &quot;Prince of Wales&quot; meant that she fell with her hull not supported for , but was undamaged. Robert was inspired by this and with William Fairbairn and Eaton Hodgkinson designed a wrought-iron tubular bridge large enough for a train to pass through. They experimented with models in 1845 and 1846 and decided to use similar design on the Conwy Bridge to gain experience. The first Conwy tube was floated into position in March 1848 and lifted the following month, allowing a single line railway to open on 1 May. The second tube was lifted into position that October; on these days Brunel was with Robert supporting his friend. The positioning of the first of the four tubes for the Britannia Bridge was carried out in June 1849, when both Brunel and Locke were with Robert, and this was lifted into position in October. The second tube was in lifted into place 7 January 1850, a single line was open to public traffic through these tubes 18 March 1850, and the second line was open 19 October.

The route north of Newcastle to Edinburgh along the coast, via Morpeth and Berwick, had been recommended by George in 1838, and Hudson promoted this route for the Newcastle and Berwick Railway in 1843. The required act of Parliament, the Newcastle and Berwick Railway Act 1845 (8 &amp; 9 Vict. c. clxiii), was given royal assent in 1845, included a high level road and rail bridge across the Tyne at Newcastle and the Royal Border Bridge across the Tweed at Berwick. The High Level Bridge is long and high and made from cast-iron bows held taut by horizontal wrought-iron strings. The first train crossed the Tyne on a temporary wooden structure in August 1848; the iron bridge was formally opened by Queen Victoria in September 1849, Robert having been elected a Fellow of the Royal Society in June. The bridge across the Tweed is a 28-arch stone viaduct, and was opened by the Queen on 29 August 1850. At the celebratory dinner Robert sat beside the Queen; he had just been offered a knighthood, but had declined.

==Politics==
In August 1847, Robert was elected unopposed as the Member of Parliament for Whitby; he continued as their MP for the rest of his life. He entered Parliament as a member of the Conservative Party, holding strong protectionist Tory views and opposed to free trade. His maiden speech was in favour of the Great Exhibition and, with Brunel, he became one of the Commissioners. Robert spoke against educational reform, saying workmen needed only to learn how to do their jobs, although he made donations to educational organisations. In 1850, the pope appointed Bishop Wiseman as the first English Roman Catholic Cardinal since the Reformation; Robert wrote in a private letter that this was aggressive, saying that in the &quot;battle as to the mere &quot;form&quot; in which the creator is to be worshiped the true spirit of Christianity is never allowed to appear.&quot; He later voiced strong opposition to the Crimean War but supported the government in January 1855, although the government lost the vote and the prime minister resigned.

Robert had become a member of the in 1846, and the following year had accompanied Talabot and Alois Negrelli to look at the feasibility of a Suez canal. He advised against a canal, saying it would quickly fill up with sand, and assisted in the building of a railway between Alexandria and Cairo, with two tubular bridges that he had designed. This opened in 1854, and was extended to Suez in 1858. He spoke in Parliament against possible involvement in a Suez canal scheme in 1857 and 1858.

==The house that has no knocker==
Robert had moved to 34 Gloucester Square in 1847; when in London he would socialise at the Athenaeum and Carlton clubs, delaying returning home until late. By 1850, Robert had been involved in a third of the country&#x27;s railway system, and had prematurely aged and become ill with chronic nephritis, then known as Bright&#x27;s Disease.

Robert found that he attracted the unwelcome attention of inventors and promoters; if he was too ill to be at Great George Street they visited him at home in Gloucester Square. In part to defend himself from these intrusions in 1850 he commissioned a 100-ton yacht, calling her &quot;Titania.&quot; Finding that he had no unwanted visitors when aboard, he referred to her as &quot;the house that has no knocker&quot;; when he went aboard, he seemed to grow younger and would behave like an excited schoolboy. He joined the Royal Yacht Squadron in 1850, becoming its first member not from an upper-class background. &quot;Titania&quot; missed the 1851 Royal Squadron Cup race, which &quot;America&quot; won and started the America&#x27;s Cup challenge, but lost to &quot;America&quot; in a private race a few days later. A second yacht, also &quot;Titania&quot; but long and 184 tons, was built in 1853 after the first was destroyed by fire in 1852.

In 1850, the route for the Norwegian Trunk Railway from Oslo (then Christiania) to Lake Mjøsa was surveyed, and Robert became chief engineer. Bidder stayed on as resident engineer, Robert returning in 1851, 1852 and 1854. In August 1852 Robert travelled to Canada to advise the Grand Trunk Railway on crossing the St Lawrence River at Montreal. The Victoria Bridge had a 6,500-foot-long (2,000-metre-long) tube made up of 25 wrought iron sections, and was to become for a time the longest bridge in the world.
In 1853, he was elected a member of the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers and in 1854 was elected as one of the institute&#x27;s vice Presidents. In 1855 Robert was decorated Knight of the Legion of Honour by the Emperor of France.

Having served as vice-president of the Institution of Civil Engineers since 1847, he was elected president in 1856, and the following year received an Honorary Doctorate of Civil Law at Oxford along with Brunel and Livingstone.

During his life he had become close friends with Brunel and Locke, and in 1857, although weak and ill, he responded to a plea for help from Brunel in launching the SS &quot;Great Eastern&quot;. Robert fell from the slipway into riverside mud, but continued without an overcoat until the end of his visit. The following day he was confined to his bed for two weeks with bronchitis.

In late 1858, Robert sailed with some friends to Alexandria, where he stayed on board &quot;Titania&quot; or at Shepheard&#x27;s Hotel in Cairo. He dined with his friend Brunel on Christmas Day before returning to London, arriving in February 1859. He was ill that summer, but sailed to Oslo in the company of George Parker Bidder to celebrate the opening of the Norwegian Trunk railway and to receive the Knight Grand Cross of the order of St. Olaf. He fell ill at the banquet on 3 September and returned to England on board &quot;Titania&quot; in the company of a doctor, but the journey took seven days after the yacht ran into a storm. As Robert landed in Suffolk, Brunel was already seriously ill following a stroke and died the following day. Robert rallied, but died on 12 October 1859. He was three years older than Brunel.

==Legacy==
By 1850 Stephenson had been involved in the construction of a third of England&#x27;s railway system. He designed the High Level Bridge and Royal Border Bridge on the East Coast Main Line. With Eaton Hodgkinson and William Fairbairn he developed wrought-iron tubular bridges, such as the Britannia Bridge in Wales, a design he would later use for the Victoria Bridge in Montreal, for many years the longest bridge in the world. He eventually worked on 160 commissions from 60 companies, building railways in other countries such as Belgium, Norway, Egypt and France.

Robert&#x27;s death was deeply mourned throughout the country, especially since it happened just a month after the death of Brunel. His funeral cortège was given permission by the Queen to pass through Hyde Park, an honour previously reserved for royalty. Two thousand tickets were issued, but 3000 men were admitted to the service at Westminster Abbey, where he was buried beside the great civil engineer Thomas Telford. Ships on the Thames, Tyne, Wear and Tees placed their flags at half mast. Work stopped at midday on Tyneside, and the 1,500 employees of Robert Stephenson &amp; Co. marched through the streets of Newcastle to their own memorial service. 

Robert left about £400,000 (): the Newcastle locomotive works, Snibston collieries and £50,000 went to his cousin George Robert Stephenson, the only son of George&#x27;s younger brother Robert, £10,000 was left to Parker Bidder and the Newcastle Infirmary, and the rest was left to friends and as legacies to institutions. One of the bequests, for £2,000, was to the fund from which the North of England Institute of Mining and Mechanical Engineers was anticipating the creation of its permanent Newcastle Headquarters. Robert was a member of this institute.

<doc id="252958" wikidata="Q473033" url="?curid=252958" title="Old wives' tale">
<text>An &quot;old wives&#x27; tale&quot; is a colloquial expression referring to spurious or superstitious claims. They can be said sometimes to be a type of urban legend, said to be passed down by older women to a younger generation. Such tales are considered superstition, folklore or unverified claims with exaggerated and/or inaccurate details. Old wives&#x27; tales often centre on women&#x27;s traditional concerns, such as pregnancy, puberty, social relations, health, herbalism and nutrition.

== Origins ==
In this context, the word &quot;wife&quot; means &quot;woman&quot; rather than &quot;married woman&quot;. This usage stems from Old English &#x27; (&quot;woman&quot;) and is akin to the German &#x27; (also meaning &quot;woman&quot;). This sense of the word is still used in Modern English in constructions such as &quot;midwife&quot; and &quot;fishwife&quot;.

Old wives&#x27; tales are often invoked to discourage certain behaviours, usually of children, or to share knowledge of folk cures for ailments ranging from toothaches to dysentery.

The concept of old wives&#x27; tales has existed for centuries. In 1611, the King James Bible was published with the following translation of a verse: &quot;But refuse profane and old wives&#x27; fables, and exercise thyself [rather] unto godliness&quot; (1 Timothy 4:7).

Old wives&#x27; tales originate in the oral tradition of storytelling. They were generally propagated by illiterate women, telling stories to each other or to children. The stories do not attempt to moralise, but to teach lessons and make difficult concepts like death or coming of age easy for children to understand. These stories are also used to scare children so they don&#x27;t do undesirable things.

<text>Charles Synge Christopher Bowen, Baron Bowen, (1 January 1835 – 10 April 1894) was an English judge.

==Early life==
Bowen was born at Woolaston in Gloucestershire – his father, the Rev. Christopher Bowen, originally of Hollymount, County Mayo, being then curate of the parish and his mother, Catherine Steele (1807/8–1902); his younger brother was Edward Ernest Bowen, a long-serving Harrow schoolmaster. He was educated at Lille in France, Blackheath and Rugby schools, leaving the latter in 1853 having won a scholarship to Balliol College, Oxford. There he made good his earlier academic promise, winning the principal classical scholarships and prizes of his time. He was elected a fellow of Balliol in 1857 while an undergraduate and became President of the Oxford Union in 1857.

It was Bowen who, as President-Elect of the Oxford Union during the summer vacation of 1857, responded with enthusiasm to the plan of Dante Gabriel Rossetti and William Morris to paint the upper walls of the new debating chamber with scenes from the legends of King Arthur. Bowen&#x27;s support was crucial to ensuring the scheme happened. &#x27;Bowen,&#x27; said Edward Burne-Jones, ‘was beloved by all’, ‘A courteous and delightful fellow … whom Rossetti loved at once.’

==Career==
From Oxford, Bowen went to London, where he was called to the bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1861, and while studying law he wrote regularly for the &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, and also later for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. In 1861, he also played a single first-class match for Hampshire against the Marylebone Cricket Club: in Hampshire&#x27;s first innings he was dismissed for a duck by Caleb Robinson and in their second innings he scored 30*. His brother, Edward Ernest Bowen also played first-class cricket for Hampshire County Cricket Club.

For a time he had little success at the bar, and came near to exchanging it for the career of a college tutor, but he was persuaded by his friends to persevere. Soon after he had begun to make his mark he was briefed against the claimant in the famous Tichborne Case. Bowen&#x27;s services to his leader, Sir John Coleridge, helped to procure for him the appointment of junior counsel to the Treasury when Sir John had died, as he did while the trial proceeded, from the office of Solicitor General to that of Attorney-General; and from this time his practice became a very large one.

The strain, however, of the Tichborne trials was great, and his physical health became unequal to the tasks which his zeal for work imposed upon it. In 1879 his acceptance of a position as a High Court judge in the Queen&#x27;s Bench division, on the retirement of Mr Justice John Mellor, gave him the opportunity of comparative rest. He was knighted in June 1879.

The character of Charles Bowen&#x27;s intellect hardly qualified him for some of the duties of a puisne judge; but it was otherwise when, in 1882, in succession to Lord Justice Holker, he was raised to the Court of Appeal. As a Lord Justice of Appeal, he was conspicuous for his learning, his industry and his courtesy to all who appeared before him; and in spite of his failing health, he sat regularly until August 1893, when, on the retirement of Lord Hannen, he was made a Lord of Appeal in Ordinary, and a life peer with the title Baron Bowen, of Colwood in the County of Sussex. By this time, however, his health had finally broken down; he never sat as a law lord to hear appeals, and he gave but one vote as a peer, while his last public service consisted in presiding over the commission which sat in October 1893 to inquire into the Featherstone riots.

Lord Bowen was regarded with great affection by all who knew him professionally or privately. He had a polished and graceful wit, of which many instances might be given, although such anecdotes lose force in print. For example, when it was suggested on the occasion of an address to Queen Victoria, to be presented by her judges, that a passage in it, &quot;conscious as we are of our shortcomings,&quot; suggested too great humility, he proposed the emendation &quot;conscious as we are of one another&#x27;s shortcomings&quot;; and on another occasion he defined a jurist as &quot;a person who knows a little about the laws of every country except his own&quot;. Lord Bowen&#x27;s judicial reputation will rest upon the series of judgments delivered by him in the court of appeal, which are remarkable for their lucid interpretation of legal principles as applied to the facts and business of life.

==Literary work==
Of Lord Bowen&#x27;s literary works besides those already indicated may be mentioned his translation of Virgil&#x27;s &quot;Eclogues&quot;, and &quot;Aeneid&quot;, books i.-vi. and his pamphlet, &quot;The Alabama Claim and Arbitration considered from a Legal Point of View&quot;.

Some of the quotations attributed to him include 
&lt;poem&gt;
The rain it raineth on the just
And also on the unjust fella;
But chiefly on the just, because
The unjust hath the just’s umbrella.
&lt;/poem&gt;

and

When I hear of an &#x27;equity&#x27; in a case like this, I am reminded of a blind man in a dark room - looking for a black hat - which isn&#x27;t there.
==Personal life==
In 1862, he married Emily Frances, eldest daughter of the engineer James Meadows Rendel, by whom he had two sons and a daughter. His daughter, Ethel Kate Bowen, married Josiah Wedgwood IV (later 1st Baron Wedgwood) of the pottery dynasty.

==Judgments==
He is credited with coining the phrase &quot;the man on the Clapham omnibus&quot;, which was quoted by Sir Richard Henn Collins MR many years after his death in the case of &quot;McQuire v. Western Morning News&quot; ([1903] 2 KB 100). Amongst his judgments are:

*&quot;Imperial Hydropathic Hotel Co v Hampson&quot; - a UK company law, concerning the interpretation of a company&#x27;s articles of association in the matter of removal of directors. 
*&quot;Harben v Phillips&quot;
*&quot;Hutton v West Cork Rly Co&quot; - UK company law case concerning the limits of a director&#x27;s discretion to spend company funds for the benefit of non-shareholders.
*&quot;Speight v Gaunt&quot; - English trusts law concerning the extent of the duty of care owed by a fiduciary.
*&quot;Abrath v North Eastern Railway&quot;
*&quot;Thomas v Quartermaine&quot;
*&quot;Smith v Land and House Property Corp&quot; - English contract law case, concerning misrepresentation and holding that a statement of opinion can represent that one knows certain facts, and can amount to misrepresentation.
*&quot;Edgington v Fitzmaurice&quot; - &quot;the state of a man&#x27;s mind is as much a fact as the state of his digestion&quot;, securities-fraud case dealing with false statements of intention
*&quot;Falcke v Scottish Imperial Insurance Co&quot; - an English unjust enrichment law case, also concerning English contract law, and setting out some fundamental principles of construction of obligations, as viewed to exist by the late 19th-century English judiciary.
*&quot;In the Arbitration between Secretary of State for Home Department and Fletcher&quot; (1887) - upholding a Queen&#x27;s Bench decision supporting the authority of the Inspector of Mines to require the use of safety lamps; Bowen LJ dissenting.
*&quot;The Moorcock&quot; - English contract law giving rise to the &quot;Business Efficacy&quot; Test for common law implied terms. 
*&quot;Carlill v Carbolic Smoke Ball Company&quot; - an advertisement containing certain terms to get a reward constituted a binding unilateral offer that could be accepted by anyone who performed its terms.
*&quot;Vagliano v Bank of England&quot; - prepared the majority judgment of the court, held wrong in conclusion by the majority of the House of Lords
*&quot;Mogul Steamship Co Ltd v McGregor, Gow &amp; Co&quot; - English tort law case concerning the economic tort of conspiracy to injure.
*&quot;Angus v Dalton&quot;

<doc id="252969" wikidata="Q4530269" url="?curid=252969" title="Ecological model of competition">
<text>The ecological model of competition is a reassessment of the nature of competition in the economy. Traditional economics models the economy on the principles of physics (force, equilibrium, inertia, momentum, and linear relationships). This can be seen in the economics lexicon: terms like labour force, market equilibrium, capital flows, and price elasticity. This is probably due to historical coincidence. Classical Newtonian physics was the state of the art in science when Adam Smith was formulating the first principles of economics in the 18th century.

According to the ecological model, it is more appropriate to model the economy on biology (growth, change, death, evolution, survival of the fittest, complex inter-relationships, non-linear relationships). Businesses operate in a complex environment with interlinked sets of determinants. Companies co-evolve: they influence, and are influenced by, competitors, customers, governments, investors, suppliers, unions, distributors, banks, and others. We should look at this business environment as a business ecosystem that both sustains, and threatens the firm. A company that is not well matched to its environment might not survive. Companies that are able to develop a successful business model and turn a core competency into a sustainable competitive advantage will thrive and grow. Very successful firms may come to dominate their industry (referred to as &quot;category killers&quot;).

<doc id="252970" wikidata="Q1266882" url="?curid=252970" title="Oxyd">
<text>Oxyd is a 1990 puzzle video game developed for the Atari ST and ported to the Amiga, Macintosh, MS-DOS, and NeXT by Dongleware Verlags GmbH. It is a game of puzzles and tests to restart all the oxygen generators (called Oxyds) on the player&#x27;s home planet. The Oxyds must be restarted by opening them in pairs of matching patterns, and (in colour versions) matching colours.

The Atari ST version was developed with the Megamax Modula-2 programming language.

==Gameplay==
The player controls a small black marble that rolls around, touches things to activate them (Oxyds are opened by touching them), and bashes things to move them. The player has an inventory and can add some items to the inventory by rolling over them. The game&#x27;s playfield is called a landscape. The player must open all the Oxyds to progress to the next landscape. Oxyds must be matched in pairs. An unpaired Oxyd will close if an Oxyd of another pattern or colour is opened.

Some landscapes also contain textual clues, which the player can place in their inventory by rolling the marble over them. They can then be selected and read. There are clues on many landscapes: some are helpful, but others are confusing or not so helpful. Other useful items include bombs, dynamite, spades, keys and computer disks. These items may be placed in the inventory, and can create or destroy blocks, create holes, fill holes, and open doors. There are other interactive blocks, including movable wooden blocks, lasers, mirrors, hidden passages. There are also dangerous areas, including bottomless pits, crumbling floors (which collapse if the marble has been rolled on them several times), slides, pools of water to drown in, quicksand (which the marble will slowly sink in), and assorted traps.

Some levels invert the player&#x27;s controls, in later entries to the series, the player has to control several balls, which shatter if they touch each other.

There are two-player cooperative levels with one black and one white marble that can either be played by one player, alternating his mouse control between either marble, or by two players playing on two interconnected computers. The interconnection is accomplished by MIDI on the Atari ST, or by the serial ports on other machines.

==Release==
Dongleware offered for $4 shipping and handling the first ten levels of &quot;Oxyd&quot;, and the game was easily obtainable from shareware CDs or bulletin board systems. From the 11th level onward, at various intervals throughout the games, &quot;Magic Tokens&quot; blocked crucial parts and passageways of the landscapes, mostly rendering progress impossible. These stones could only be removed by entering a code. &quot;The Oxyd Book&quot; was sold separately for $39, with code tables matching the information given on the Magic Stone. This form of software protection used the book as a dongle or code wheel, but unlike other games which use the code book protection approach, the game itself was free.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in April 1993 called &quot;Oxyd&quot; &quot;my favorite new shareware title ... an exceptional offering, guaranteed to provide numerous hours of enjoyment&quot;. The magazine in April 1994 said that &quot;Oxyd Magnum&quot; &quot;will quickly pull players deeper and deeper into its 100 devilish mazes&quot;. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in May 1994 said that it &quot;is a game with very few flaws. The graphics are clean, and the mouse control is crisp&quot;, and praised the small size. The magazine concluded that &quot;&quot;Oxyd Magnum&quot; is a top notch puzzle game that will keep players up to the early hours of the morning attempting to solve &#x27;just one more level.

==Legacy==

&quot;Oxyd&quot; spawned a number of sequels: &quot;Oxyd Magnum&quot;, &quot;Oxyd Extra&quot;, and &quot;&quot; (also known as &quot;Oxyd 2&quot;). Additionally, &quot;Oxyd&quot; itself was a sequel to a lesser-known game, called &quot;Esprit&quot;.

Furthermore, Esprit is a derivative of Bolo for the Atari ST, also developed by Meinolf Amekudzi&quot;. Not to be confused with Bolo (1987 video game), released the same year&quot;. Bolo involves moving a paddle around, and is a derivative of Breakout, however the paddle can be moved anywhere on-screen, with the balls being able to bounce freely in any side or direction.

&quot;Enigma&quot; is an open source fangame with over a thousand different landscapes that can also read the original &quot;Oxyd&quot; level packs (they are not included for copyright reasons). Also, the included &quot;Dejavu&quot; level packs contain levels with similar ideas to the original levels.

Mad Data, with the permission of Dongleware, produced an official freeware game with the name &quot;Oxyd extra v2.0&quot;.

== Planned remake and re-releases ==
In summer 2019, Dongleware announced a completely new &quot;Oxyd&quot; release and a port of the classic version to the Nintendo Switch console. Around 2020, the Oxydgames twitter account was suspended. In March 2021, the Steam store page for the game was removed. In 2024, both the German and English website went down, with only the YouTube channel remaining. The current status of the re-releases is unknown.

<text>Railroad Tycoon is a business simulation game series. There are five games in the series; the original &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; (1990), &quot;Railroad Tycoon Deluxe&quot; (1993), &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot; (1998), &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3&quot; (2003), and &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads!&quot; (2006).

&quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; was written by game designer Sid Meier and published by MicroProse. Though it shares the &quot;Tycoon&quot; suffix, it is not related to other Microprose games such as &quot;RollerCoaster Tycoon&quot; and &quot;Transport Tycoon&quot;, which were developed by Scottish programmer Chris Sawyer.

The objective of the game is to build and manage a railroad company by laying track, building stations, and buying and scheduling trains. The railroad must be built in a certain time to win the game.

== &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon&quot; ==
The original version allowed the player to start companies in several settings: the U.S. West and Midwest or the Northeast, England, and (on a smaller scale including southern England) Europe.

The player manages the business as described above and may also handle individual train movement and build additional industries. The game also has other railroad companies attempting to put the player out of business with stock dealings and &quot;Rate Wars&quot;.

The player starts with one million dollars, half as equity, half as loan. The player can get more cash by selling $500,000 bonds at various interest rates (which depend on the current economic condition in the game).

As part of the release of the new &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads&quot;, 2K Games released the full version of the original Railroad Tycoon game for free, which is available on their website.

=== &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon Deluxe&quot; ===

An updated version of this game named &quot;Railroad Tycoon Deluxe&quot; was created and released in 1993. Despite a host of new features and graphics, &quot;Deluxe&quot; sold very poorly, due to some bugs and slow gameplay (most notoriously the F4 map screen, which brings the game to a crawl).

&quot;Deluxe&quot; is essentially the same game as Railroad Tycoon, with improved hi-resolution graphics, new sound effects, and several additions. The additions are: new maps (South America and Africa) with region-specific cargo types (e.g. troops for Africa), new time ranges and locomotives, bandits who can hijack trains, and sheriffs who will arrest them.

Although the game is called &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroad Tycoon Deluxe&quot;, Sid Meier himself had nothing to do with the development of this version.

== &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot; ==
A sequel featuring improved graphics and more complex gameplay was published by Gathering of Developers in 1998 after PopTop Software acquired rights to the name from MicroProse, Sid Meier&#x27;s original company which he himself left a year earlier to form Firaxis.

Some features of the first version are missing in this sequel, such as the ability to build tunnels and signal towers, but many new possibilities were added, such as the ability to have unlimited money, trains, and train routes, much better control of routes, dozens of new maps, and the ability to create and modify scenarios and maps.

The Dreamcast version was in full 3D.

There are dozens of new scenarios to play including ones in Africa, North America, Germany, the Swiss Alps, the jungles of South America, and even several places around the world in a possible future where Earth&#x27;s oceans have risen. Most of the ones in &quot;Railroad Tycoon 1&quot; are in &quot;Railroad Tycoon II&quot;. There are also many more first and second century campaigns to choose from than in &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot;.

An expansion pack &quot;Railroad Tycoon II: Second Century&quot; was later added which contained new scenarios focusing on modern and near-future times, plus added new elements to the economy. The game and its expansion were repackaged together in the &quot;Gold Edition&quot; and then, with 50 additional user-made scenarios, into the &quot;Platinum Edition&quot;.

A short lived, budget title &quot;The Next Millennium&quot; went on sale in 2000. It featured many scenarios and features of &quot;The Second Century&quot;, but no map editor. It had no instruction booklet and was sold only in a jewel case.

== &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3&quot; ==
The second sequel, &quot;Railroad Tycoon 3&quot;, was released in 2003. It featured a full 3D environment, overpasses and tunnels, and much improved graphics. Gameplay changed significantly, with dynamic pricing of goods across the entire map and cargo that can find alternate means of transportation if no train service is provided; track was no longer laid on discrete square tiles, but as curved track on a 3D map. A map editor is included but cannot be used during the game.

An expansion pack, &quot;Coast to Coast&quot;, was released for download in 2004 with new scenarios, including a map of the entire United States and eight new locomotives.

== Board game ==

&quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; is a railway-themed board game designed by Martin Wallace and Glenn Drover. The game, published in 2005 by Eagle Games, is derived from Wallace&#x27;s earlier railway-themed game &quot;Age of Steam&quot; with more stylistic box art and simplified rules. Originally using the &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; license and featuring box art very similar to the third entry in the series, it has been published under the title &quot;Railways of the World&quot; since 2009. &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; takes place in the eastern United States in 1830. Each player takes charge of a pioneering new railway company.

== &quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads!&quot; ==
&quot;Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads!&quot; was released in October 2006. It was the first game in the &quot;Railroad Tycoon&quot; series since the original to have direct input from Sid Meier himself. &quot;Railroads!&quot; features a variety of scenarios and trains from both North America and Europe and is less industry-focused than previous versions. It has a simpler user interface for track laying, full 3D graphics, and real time gameplay.

<text>Shoot &#x27;em ups (also known as shmups or STGs) are a sub-genre of action games. There is no consensus as to which design elements compose a shoot &#x27;em up; some restrict the definition to games featuring spacecraft and certain types of character movement, while others allow a broader definition including characters on foot and a variety of perspectives.

The genre&#x27;s roots can be traced back to earlier shooting games, including target shooting electro-mechanical games of the mid-20th-century, but did not receive a video game release until &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962). The shoot &#x27;em up genre was established by the hit arcade game &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, which popularised and set the general template for the genre in 1978, and has spawned many clones. The genre was then further developed by arcade hits such as &quot;Asteroids&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot; in 1979. Shoot &#x27;em ups were popular throughout the 1980s to early 1990s, diversifying into a variety of subgenres such as scrolling shooters, run and gun games and rail shooters. In the mid-1990s, shoot &#x27;em ups became a niche genre based on design conventions established in the 1980s, and increasingly catered to specialist enthusiasts, particularly in Japan. &quot;Bullet hell&quot; games are a subgenre of shooters that features overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles, often in visually impressive formations.

== Definition ==
A &quot;shoot &#x27;em up&quot;, also known as a &quot;shmup&quot; or &quot;STG&quot; (the common Japanese abbreviation for &quot;shooting games&quot;), is a game in which the protagonist combats a large number of enemies by shooting at them while dodging their fire. The controlling player must rely primarily on reaction times to succeed. Beyond this, critics differ on exactly which design elements constitute a shoot &#x27;em up. Some restrict the genre to games featuring some kind of craft, using fixed or scrolling movement. Others widen the scope to include games featuring such protagonists as robots or humans on foot, as well as including games featuring &quot;on-rails&quot; (or &quot;into the screen&quot;) and &quot;run and gun&quot; movement. Mark Wolf restricts the definition to games featuring multiple antagonists (&quot;&#x27;em&quot; being short for &quot;them&quot;), calling games featuring one-on-one shooting &quot;combat games&quot;. Formerly, critics described any game where the primary design element was shooting as a &quot;shoot &#x27;em up&quot;, but later shoot &#x27;em ups became a specific, inward-looking genre based on design conventions established in those shooting games of the 1980s.

=== Common elements ===
Shoot &#x27;em ups are a subgenre of action game. These games are usually viewed from a top-down or side-view perspective, and players must use ranged weapons to take action at a distance. The player&#x27;s avatar is typically a vehicle or spacecraft under constant attack. Thus, the player&#x27;s goal is to shoot as quickly as possible at anything that moves or threatens them to reach the end of the level, usually with a boss battle. In some games, the player&#x27;s character can withstand some damage or a single hit will result in their destruction. The main skills required in shoot &#x27;em ups are fast reactions and memorising enemy attack patterns. Some games feature overwhelming numbers of enemy projectiles and the player has to memorise their patterns to survive. These games belong to one of the fastest-paced video game genres.

Large numbers of enemy characters programmed to behave in an easily predictable manner are typically featured. These enemies may behave in a certain way dependent on their type, or attack in formations that the player can learn to predict. The basic gameplay tends to be straightforward with many varieties of weapons. Shoot &#x27;em ups rarely have realistic physics. Characters can instantly change direction with no inertia, and projectiles move in a straight line at constant speeds. The player&#x27;s character can collect &quot;power-ups&quot; which may afford the character&#x27;s greater protection, an &quot;extra life&quot;, health, shield, or upgraded weaponry. Different weapons are often suited to different enemies, but these games seldom keep track of ammunition. As such, players tend to fire indiscriminately, and their weapons only damage legitimate targets.

== Types ==
Shoot &#x27;em ups are categorized by their design elements, particularly viewpoint and movement:

Fixed shooters restrict the player and enemies to a single screen, and the player primarily moves along a single axis, such as back and forth along the bottom of the screen. Examples include &quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978), &quot;Galaxian&quot; (1979), &quot;Phoenix&quot; (1980), and &quot;Galaga&quot; (1981). In &quot;Pooyan&quot; (1982), the fixed axis of movement is vertical, along the right side of the screen. In &quot;Centipede&quot; (1980) and &quot;Gorf&quot; (1981), the player primarily moves left and right along the bottom, but several inches of vertical motion are also allowed within an invisible box.

Multidirectional shooters allow 360-degree movement where the protagonist may rotate and move in any direction such as &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) and &quot;Mad Planets&quot; (1983). Multidirectional shooters with one joystick for movement and one joystick for firing in any direction independent of movement are called twin-stick shooters. One of the first games to popularize twin-stick controls was &quot;&quot; (1982).

Space shooters are a thematic variant of involving spacecraft in outer space. Following the success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, space shooters were the dominant subgenre during the late 1970s to early 1980s. These games can overlap with other subgenres as well as space combat games.

Tube shooters feature craft flying through an abstract tube, such as &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) and &quot;Gyruss&quot; (1983). There is still a single axis of motion, making these a subset of fixed shooters.

Rail shooters limit the player to moving around the screen while following a specific route; these games often feature an &quot;into the screen&quot; viewpoint, with which the action is seen from behind the player character, and moves &quot;into the screen&quot;, while the player retains control over dodging. Examples include &quot;Space Harrier&quot; (1985), &quot;Captain Skyhawk&quot; (1990), &quot;Starblade&quot; (1991), &quot;Star Fox&quot; (1993), &quot;Star Wars: Rebel Assault&quot; (1993), &quot;Panzer Dragoon&quot; (1995), and &quot;Sin and Punishment&quot; (2000). Rail shooters that use light guns are called &quot;light gun shooters&quot;, such as &quot;Operation Wolf&quot; (1987), &quot;Lethal Enforcers&quot; (1992), &quot;Virtua Cop&quot; (1994), &quot;Point Blank&quot; (1994), &quot;Time Crisis&quot; (1995), &quot;The House of the Dead&quot; (1996) and &quot;Elemental Gearbolt&quot; (1997). Light-gun games that are &quot;on rails&quot; are usually not considered to be in the shoot-em-up category, but rather their own first-person light-gun shooter category.

Cute &#x27;em ups feature brightly colored graphics depicting surreal settings and enemies. Cute &#x27;em ups tend to have unusual, oftentimes completely bizarre opponents for the player to fight, with &quot;Twinbee&quot; and &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot; first pioneering the subgenre, along with &quot;Parodius&quot;, &quot;Cotton&quot;, and &quot;Harmful Park&quot; being additional key games. Some cute &#x27;em ups may employ overtly sexual characters and innuendo.

===Scrolling shooters===
Vertically scrolling shooters present the action from above and scroll up (or occasionally down) the screen.

Horizontally scrolling shooters usually present a side-on view and scroll left to right (or less often, right to left).

Isometrically scrolling shooters or isometric shooters, such as Sega&#x27;s &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1982), use an isometric point of view.

A popular implementation style of scrolling shooters has the player&#x27;s flying vehicle moving forward, at a fixed rate, through an environment. Examples are &quot;Scramble&quot; (1981), &quot;Xevious&quot; (1982), &quot;Gradius&quot; (1986), &quot;Darius&quot; (1987), &quot;R-Type&quot; (1987), &quot;Einhänder&quot; (1997). In contrast, &quot;Defender&quot; (1981) allows the player to move left or right at will.

Run and gun games have protagonists that move through the world on foot and shoot attackers. Examples include the vertically scrolling, overhead view games &quot;Front Line&quot; (1982), &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; (1986). Side-scrolling run and gun games often combine elements from platform games, such as the ability to jump: &quot;Contra&quot; (1987), &quot;Metal Slug&quot; (1996) and &quot;Cuphead&quot; (2017). Run and gun games may also use isometric viewpoints and may have multidirectional movement.

===Bullet hell===


 is a subgenre of shooters in which the screen becomes crowded with complex &quot;curtain fire&quot; enemy patterns. It is also characterized by collision boxes that are smaller than the sprites themselves, to accommodate maneuvering through these crowded firing patterns. This style of game, also known as &quot;manic shooters&quot; or &quot;maniac shooters&quot;, originated in the mid-1990s as an offshoot of scrolling shooters. The &quot;DonPachi&quot; and &quot;Touhou Project&quot; series are early titles establishing the principle of bullet hells.

A bullet heaven or reverse bullet hell is a subgenre characterized by the player character collecting or unlocking abilities and attacks whose visuals overlap and clutter the game screen as the game progresses. They also share a feature of many enemy characters, commonly called &quot;hordes&quot;, walking toward the player from off-screen. This genre is generally attributed to &quot;Vampire Survivors&quot;, released in 2022.

===Trance shooters===
A small subgenre of shooter games that emphasizes chaotic, reflex-based gameplay designed to put the player in a trance-like state. In trance shooters, enemy patterns usually have randomized elements, forcing the player to rely on reflexes rather than pattern memorization. Games of this type usually feature colorful, abstract visuals, and electronic music (often techno music). Jeff Minter is commonly credited with originating the style with &quot;Tempest 2000&quot; (1994) and subsequent games including &quot;Space Giraffe&quot;, &quot;Gridrunner++&quot;, and &quot;Polybius&quot; (2017). Other examples include the &quot;Geometry Wars&quot; series, &quot;Space Invaders Extreme&quot;, &quot;Super Stardust HD&quot;, and &quot;Resogun&quot;.

== History ==

=== Origins ===
The concept of shooting games existed before video games, dating back to shooting gallery carnival games in the late 19th century and target sports such as archery, bowling and darts. Mechanical target shooting games first appeared in England&#x27;s amusement arcades around the turn of the 20th century, before appearing in America by the 1920s. Shooting gallery games eventually evolved into more sophisticated target shooting electro-mechanical games (EM games) such as Sega&#x27;s influential &quot;Periscope&quot; (1965). Shooting video games have roots in EM shooting games.

Video game journalist Brian Ashcraft argues the early mainframe game &quot;Spacewar!&quot; (1962) was the first shoot &#x27;em up video game. It was developed at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in 1961, for the developers&#x27; amusement, and presents a space battle between two craft. It was remade four times as an arcade video game in the 1970s.

===Emergence of shoot &#x27;em up genre (late 1970s)===
&quot;Space Invaders&quot; (1978) is most frequently cited as the &quot;first&quot; or &quot;original&quot; in the genre. A seminal game created by Tomohiro Nishikado of Japan&#x27;s Taito, it led to proliferation of shooter games. It pitted the player against multiple enemies descending from the top of the screen at a constantly increasing speed. Nishikado conceived the game by combining elements of &quot;Breakout&quot; (1976) with those of earlier target shooting games, and simple alien creatures inspired by H. G. Wells&#x27; &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;. The hardware was unable to render the movement of aircraft, so the game was set in space, with a black background. It had a more interactive style of play than earlier target shooting games, with multiple enemies who responded to the player-controlled cannon&#x27;s movement and fired back at the player. The game ended when the player was killed by the enemies. While earlier shooting games allowed the player to shoot at targets, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; was the first where multiple enemies fired back at the player. It also introduced the idea of giving the player multiple lives and popularized the concept of achieving a high score.

With these elements, &quot;Space Invaders&quot; set the general template for the shoot &#x27;em up genre. It became one of the most widely cloned shooting games, spawning more than 100 imitators with only the most minor differences (if any) from the original. Most shooting games released since then have followed its &quot;multiple life, progressively difficult level&quot; paradigm, according to Eugene Jarvis.

=== Golden age and refinement (late 1970s to early 1980s) ===
Following the success of &quot;Space Invaders&quot;, shoot &#x27;em ups became the dominant genre for much of the golden age of arcade video games, from the late 1970s up until the early 1980s, particularly the &quot;space shooter&quot; subgenre. In 1979, Namco&#x27;s &quot;Galaxian&quot;—&quot;the granddaddy of all top-down shooters&quot;, according to IGN—was released. Its use of colour graphics and individualised antagonists were considered &quot;strong evolutionary concepts&quot; among space ship games. In 1981 &quot;Gorf&quot; brought joystick control and (limited) vertical as well as horizontal movement to the vertically-oriented fixed-shooter genre, while &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot; have only horizontal movement controlled by a pair of buttons. Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979) was a hit multi-directional shooter, taking from &quot;Spacewar!&quot; the ability for the player&#x27;s ship to roam the entire screen and to rotate, move and shoot in any direction.

The &quot;Space Invaders&quot; format evolved into the vertical scrolling shooter sub-genre. SNK&#x27;s debut shoot &#x27;em up &quot;Ozma Wars&quot; (1979) featured vertical scrolling backgrounds and enemies, and it was the first action game to feature a supply of energy, similar to hit points. Namco&#x27;s &quot;Xevious&quot;, released in 1982, was one of the first and most influential vertical scrolling shooters. &quot;Xevious&quot; is also the first to convincingly portray dithered/shaded organic landscapes as opposed to blocks-in-space or wireframe obstacles.

Side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em ups emerged in the early 1980s. &quot;Defender&quot;, introduced by Williams Electronics in late 1980 and entering production in early 1981, allowed side-scrolling in both directions in a wrap-around game world, unlike most later games in the genre. The scrolling helped remove design limitations associated with the screen, and it also featured a minimap radar. &quot;Scramble&quot;, released by Konami in early 1981, had continuous scrolling in a single direction and was the first side-scrolling shooter with multiple distinct levels.

In the early 1980s, Japanese arcade developers began moving away from space shooters towards character action games, whereas American arcade developers continued to focus on space shooters during the early 1980s, up until the end of the arcade golden age. According to Eugene Jarvis, American developers were greatly influenced by Japanese space shooters but took the genre in a different direction from the &quot;more deterministic, scripted, pattern-type&quot; gameplay of Japanese games, towards a more &quot;programmer-centric design culture, emphasizing algorithmic generation of backgrounds and enemy dispatch&quot; and &quot;an emphasis on random-event generation, particle-effect explosions and physics&quot; as seen in arcade games such as his own &quot;Defender&quot; and &quot;&quot; (1982) as well as Atari&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; (1979). &quot;Robotron: 2084&quot; was an influential game in the multi-directional shooter subgenre.

Some games experimented with pseudo-3D perspectives at the time. Nintendo&#x27;s attempt at the genre, &quot;Radar Scope&quot; (1980), borrowed heavily from &quot;Space Invaders&quot; and &quot;Galaxian&quot;, but added a three-dimensional third-person perspective; the game was a commercial failure, however. Atari&#x27;s &quot;Tempest&quot; (1981) was one of the earliest tube shooters and a more successful attempt to incorporate a 3D perspective into shooter games; &quot;Tempest&quot; went on to influence several later rail shooters. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Zaxxon&quot; (1981) introduced isometric video game graphics to the genre.

The term &quot;shmup&quot; is believed to have been coined in 1985 by the British Commodore 64 magazine &quot;Zzap!64&quot;. In the July 1985 issue, the term was used by the editor Chris Anderson and reviewer Julian Rignall.

1985 saw the release of Konami&#x27;s &quot;Gradius&quot;, which gave the player greater control over the choice of weaponry, thus introducing another element of strategy. The game also introduced the need for the player to memorise levels in order to achieve any measure of success. &quot;Gradius&quot;, with its iconic protagonist, defined the side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up and spawned a series spanning several sequels. The following year saw the emergence of one of Sega&#x27;s forefront series with its game &quot;Fantasy Zone&quot;. The game received acclaim for its surreal graphics and setting and the protagonist, Opa-Opa, was for a time considered Sega&#x27;s mascot. The game borrowed &quot;Defender&#x27;s&quot; device of allowing the player to control the direction of flight and along with the earlier &quot;TwinBee&quot; (1985), is an early archetype of the &quot;cute &#x27;em up&quot; subgenre. In 1986, Taito released &quot;KiKi KaiKai&quot;, an overhead multi-directional shooter. The game is notable for using a traditional fantasy setting in contrast to most shoot &#x27;em up games filled with science fiction motifs. &quot;R-Type&quot;, an acclaimed side-scrolling shoot &#x27;em up, was released in 1987 by Irem, employing slower paced scrolling than usual, with difficult, claustrophobic levels calling for methodical strategies. 1990&#x27;s &quot;Raiden&quot; was the beginning of another acclaimed and enduring series to emerge from this period.

===Run and gun and rail shooters (1980s to early 1990s)===
Run and gun games became popular in the mid-1980s. These games feature characters on foot, rather than spacecraft, and often have military themes. The origins of this type of shooter go back to &quot;Sheriff&quot; by Nintendo, released in 1979. SNK&#x27;s &quot;Sasuke vs. Commander&quot; (1980), which had relatively detailed background graphics for its time, pit a samurai against a horde of ninjas, along with boss fights. Taito&#x27;s &quot;Front Line&quot; (1982) introduced the vertical scrolling format later popularized by Capcom&#x27;s &quot;Commando&quot; (1985), which established the standard formula used by later run and gun games. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Ninja Princess&quot; (1985), which released slightly before &quot;Commando&quot;, was a run and gun game that was distinctive for its feudal Japan setting and female ninja protagonist who throws shuriken and knives. SNK&#x27;s &quot;TNK III&quot;, released later in 1985, combined the &quot;Front Line&quot; tank shooter format with unique rotary joystick controls, which they later combined with &quot;Commando&quot;-inspired run and gun gameplay to develop &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; (1986), which further popularized run and gun shooters. &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; also drew inspiration from the action film &quot;&quot; (1985), which it was originally intended to be an adaptation of. Contemporary critics considered military themes and protagonists similar to Rambo or Schwarzenegger prerequisites for a shoot &#x27;em up, as opposed to an action-adventure game. The success of &quot;Commando&quot; and &quot;Ikari Warriors&quot; led to run and gun games becoming the dominant style of shoot &#x27;em up during the late 1980s to early 1990s, with the term &quot;shoot &#x27;em up&quot; itself becoming synonymous with &quot;run and gun&quot; during this period.

Konami&#x27;s &quot;Green Beret&quot; (1985), known as &quot;Rush&#x27;n Attack&quot; in North America, adapted the &quot;Commando&quot; formula to a side-scrolling format. Later notable side-scrolling run and gun shooters include Namco&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Thunder&quot; (1986), which added cover mechanics to the formula, and Data East&#x27;s &quot;RoboCop&quot; (1988). In 1987, Konami created &quot;Contra&quot;, a side-scrolling coin-op arcade game, and later a NES game, that was particularly acclaimed for its multi-directional aiming and two-player cooperative gameplay. By the early 1990s and the popularity of 16-bit consoles, the scrolling shooter genre was overcrowded, with developers struggling to make their games stand out, with exceptions such as the inventive &quot;Gunstar Heroes&quot; (1993) by Treasure.

Sega&#x27;s pseudo-3D rail shooter &quot;Buck Rogers: Planet of Zoom&quot; demonstrated the potential of 3D shoot &#x27;em up gameplay in 1982. Sega&#x27;s &quot;Space Harrier&quot;, a rail shooter released in 1985, broke new ground graphically and its wide variety of settings across multiple levels gave players more to aim for than high scores. In 1986, Arsys Software released &quot;WiBArm&quot;, a shooter that switched between a 2D side-scrolling view in outdoor areas to a fully 3D polygonal third-person perspective inside buildings, while bosses were fought in an arena-style 2D battle, with the game featuring a variety of weapons and equipment. In 1987, Square&#x27;s &quot;3-D WorldRunner&quot; was an early stereoscopic 3-D shooter played from a third-person perspective, followed later that year by its sequel &quot;JJ&quot;, and the following year by &quot;Space Harrier 3-D&quot; which used the SegaScope 3-D shutter glasses. That same year, Sega&#x27;s &quot;Thunder Blade&quot; switched between both a top-down view and a third-person view, and featured the use of force feedback, where the joystick vibrates.

===Bullet hell and niche appeal (mid-1990s to present)===

Over the course of the 1990s, a new subgenre of shooters evolved, known as &quot; in Japan, and often referred to as &quot;bullet hell&quot; or &quot;manic shooters&quot; in English-speaking regions. These games are characterized by high numbers of enemy projectiles, often in complex &quot;curtain fire&quot; patterns, as well as collision boxes that are smaller than the sprites themselves, allowing the player to fit between the narrow gaps in enemy fire. 

Bullet hell games were first popularized in Japanese arcades during a time when 3D games and fighting games were eclipsing other games. The flashy firing patterns were intended to grab players attention. Toaplan&#x27;s &quot;Batsugun&quot; (1993) is often considered a pivotal point in the development of this subgenre. After the closure of Toaplan, the following year, a number of studios formed from former Toaplan staff that would continue to develop this style, including Cave (formed by &quot;Batsugun&#x27;s&quot; main creator Tsuneki Ikeda) who released 1995&#x27;s seminal &quot;DonPachi&quot;, and Takumi, who would develop the &quot;GigaWing&quot; series. Bullet hell games marked another point where the shooter genre began to cater to more dedicated players. Games such as &quot;Gradius&quot; had been more difficult than &quot;Space Invaders&quot; or &quot;Xevious&quot;, but bullet hell games were yet more inward-looking and aimed at dedicated fans of the genre looking for greater challenges. While shooter games featuring protagonists on foot largely moved to 3D-based genres, popular, long-running series such as &quot;Contra&quot; and &quot;Metal Slug&quot; continued to receive new sequels. Rail shooters have rarely been released in the new millennium, with only &quot;Rez&quot; and &quot;Panzer Dragoon Orta&quot; achieving cult recognition. In the early 2000s, the genre achieved recognition through the mobile game &quot;Space Impact&quot;, which is considered one of the important games in the history of mobile games.

Treasure&#x27;s shoot &#x27;em up, &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; (1998), introduced an element of narrative to the genre. It was critically acclaimed for its refined design, though it was not released outside Japan and remains a much sought-after collector&#x27;s item. Its successor &quot;Ikaruga&quot; (2001) featured improved graphics and was again acclaimed as one of the best games in the genre. Both &quot;Radiant Silvergun&quot; and &quot;Ikaruga&quot; were later released on Xbox Live Arcade. The &quot;Touhou Project&quot; series spans 28 years and 32 games as of 2024 and was listed in the Guinness World Records in October 2010 for being the &quot;most prolific fan-made shooter series&quot;. The genre has undergone something of a resurgence with the release of the Xbox 360, PlayStation 3 and Wii online services, while in Japan arcade shoot &#x27;em ups retain a deep-rooted niche popularity. &quot;Geometry Wars: Retro Evolved&quot; was released on Xbox Live Arcade in 2005 and in particular stood out from the various re-releases and casual games available on the service. The PC has also seen its share of dōjin shoot &#x27;em ups like &quot;Crimzon Clover&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Xenoslaive Overdrive&quot;, and the &quot;eXceed&quot; series. However, despite the genre&#x27;s continued appeal to an enthusiastic niche of players, shoot &#x27;em up developers are increasingly embattled financially by the power of home consoles and their attendant genres.

<doc id="252984" wikidata="Q1469546" url="?curid=252984" title="Running gag">
<text>A running gag, or running joke, is a literary device that takes the form of an amusing joke or a comical reference and appears repeatedly throughout a work of literature or other form of storytelling. Though they are similar, catchphrases are not considered to be running gags.

Running gags can begin with an instance of unintentional humor that is repeated in variations as the joke grows familiar and audiences anticipate reappearances of the gag. The humor in a running gag may derive entirely from how often it is repeated, but the underlying statement or situation will always be some form of joke. A trivial statement will not become a running gag simply by being repeated. A running gag may also derive its humor from the (in)appropriateness of the situation in which it occurs, or by setting up the audience to expect another occurrence of the joke and then substituting something else (&quot;bait and switch&quot;). Running gags are found in everyday life, live theater, live comedy, television shows, video games, films, books, comic strips, and potentially any other situation in which humor is possible and there is enough time for the repetitions to happen.

A running gag can be verbal or visual and may &quot;convey social values by echoing belligerent speakers with a barrage of caricatured threats&quot;. For example, a character may present others with a proposition that is so ridiculous or outrageous it is likely to be self-mocking to the point where the original request has little or no chance of actually being carried out and results in a humorous effect.

<doc id="252986" wikidata="Q332962" url="?curid=252986" title="Michael Ancram">
<text>Michael Andrew Foster Jude Kerr, 13th Marquess of Lothian, Baron Kerr of Monteviot, (7 July 1945 – 1 October 2024), commonly known as Michael Ancram, was a British politician and peer who served as Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party from 2001 to 2005. He was formerly styled Earl of Ancram until he inherited the marquessate in 2004, upon the death of his father.

Born in London and educated at Ampleforth College, Ancram studied History at Christ Church, Oxford, and read Law at the University of Edinburgh. After graduating from Edinburgh, he was called to the Scottish Bar and practised as an advocate before entering politics. He unsuccessfully contested West Lothian in 1970, but was elected as Member of Parliament (MP) for Berwick and East Lothian at the February 1974 general election and served until he lost the seat in the election held in October of that year. He re-entered Parliament in 1979, representing Edinburgh South until his defeat in 1987. During this time, he served as a minister at the Scotland Office in Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s government.

After being elected to represent Devizes at the 1992 general election, Ancram served at the Northern Ireland Office in John Major&#x27;s government. When Major was defeated at the 1997 general election, the Conservatives entered opposition and Ancram became Chairman of the Conservative Party under William Hague in 1998, having previously covered constitutional affairs in the Shadow Cabinet. This was followed by a period as deputy party leader under Iain Duncan Smith and Michael Howard, during which time he served in the Shadow Cabinet as shadow foreign secretary and shadow defence secretary respectively.

==Early life and career==
Ancram was born in London and is the elder son and second child of Peter Kerr, 12th Marquess of Lothian, and his wife Antonella. He was educated at Ampleforth College in North Yorkshire. He graduated as a Bachelor of Arts in History from Christ Church, Oxford, in 1966, later by convention converted to a Master of Arts. While at Oxford, he was a member of the Bullingdon Club. In 1968, he gained a Bachelor of Laws (LLB) degree from the University of Edinburgh. He was called to the Scottish Bar in 1970 and began to practise as an advocate.

==Political career==
===Member of Parliament===
Ancram unsuccessfully contested the West Lothian parliamentary seat in 1970. He was first elected to Parliament in the February 1974 general election, when he contested and won the seat of Berwick and East Lothian, but lost the seat in the October election of the same year. After losing his seat, he again took up legal practice.

Ancram re-entered Parliament at the 1979 election as the Member of Parliament for Edinburgh South, beating future Prime Minister Gordon Brown. He was a member of the House of Commons Energy Select Committee between 1979 and 1983, and Chairman of the Scottish Conservative and Unionist Party from 1980 to 1983. He was Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Scottish Office with responsibility for Home Affairs, Housing, Local Government, Rating Reform and the Environment from 1983 until 1987. He lost his seat again at the 1987 general election, being one of several prominent Conservatives defeated in Scotland in that contest.

After losing his seat in 1987, Ancram returned to Parliament at the 1992 general election representing Devizes. He was a member of the Public Accounts Committee and Chairman of the backbench Constitutional Affairs Committee from 1992 until May 1993, when he was appointed Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Northern Ireland Office. He was promoted to Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office in January 1994, and was sworn as a Privy Councillor in January 1996.

===Shadow Cabinet and failed leadership bid===
Following the Conservatives&#x27; defeat at the 1997 election, Ancram served in the Shadow Cabinet as Shadow Constitutional Affairs Spokesperson from June 1997 to June 1998. He then served as Chairman of the Conservative Party from December 1998 to September 2001.

In 2001, he ran against Iain Duncan Smith, Michael Portillo, Kenneth Clarke and David Davis in the election for the party leadership. In the first poll of Conservative MPs he and David Davis were tied for last place, leading to a re-run in which Ancram was placed bottom. He was eliminated, and Davis withdrew. Both swung their support behind Iain Duncan Smith, who went on to win, beating Clarke in the final vote of party members. Duncan Smith made Ancram Deputy Leader of the Conservative Party and Shadow Foreign Secretary in September 2001. He remained in this position after Michael Howard took over in 2003.

In the reshuffle following the 2005 election, Ancram was moved to Shadow Secretary of State for Defence but remained deputy leader. He stood down from the Shadow Cabinet in December 2005, following the election of David Cameron as Conservative Party Leader. In January 2006 he was appointed to the Intelligence and Security Committee, replacing James Arbuthnot.

===Later years as an MP===
Ancram was a founding signatory in 2005 of the Henry Jackson Society principles, advocating a proactive approach to the spread of liberal democracy across the world, including when necessary by military intervention. On 21 April 2006 he became one of the first senior Conservative MPs to call for British troops to withdraw from Iraq, saying it was effectively in a state of civil war and that &quot;It is time now for us to get out of Iraq with dignity and honour while we still can.&quot;

In 2006, Ancram set up Global Strategy Forum, a bi-partisan foreign affairs think tank based in London.

From 2008 to 2013, Ancram was chair of foreign policy forum Le Cercle.

Ancram was a founder member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

On 11 August 2009, Ancram announced that he was to stand down as the MP for Devizes at the 2010 general election due to heart problems. He retired when Parliament was dissolved on 12 April 2010; his successor as Conservative member for the Devizes constituency was Claire Perry.

==Personal life==
Ancram married Lady Jane Fitzalan-Howard, the fourth daughter of the 16th Duke of Norfolk, who on 7 April 2017 succeeded as the 16th Lady Herries of Terregles. They were both prominent Roman Catholics. She is a Patron of the Right to Life Trust and also a patroness of the Royal Caledonian Ball. The couple had three daughters and two grandchildren:

*Sarah Margaret Kerr (born and died 13 June 1976)
*Lady Clare Therese Kerr (25 January 1979) married in August 2010 The Right Honourable Nick Hurd, son of Lord Hurd of Westwell. Lady Clare is the heiress presumptive to her mother’s Scottish peerage. They have two children:
**Leila Rose Hurd (17 May 2012)
**Caspar Jamie Hurd (30 September 2014)
*Lady Mary Kerr (28 May 1981), who directed the award winning documentary &quot;Radioman&quot; (2012). She married Zackary Adler on 28 May 2016.

Ancram&#x27;s younger sister, Lady Cecil Cameron OBE, married Donald Angus Cameron of Lochiel, the Chief of Clan Cameron. Another sister, the former Lady Clare Kerr, is now Dowager Countess of Euston and mother of the 12th Duke of Grafton.

Ancram was a keen country music fan and often played acoustic guitar at Conservative Party conferences. He was a knight of Order of St John and Order of St Lazarus; he was also made a Freeman of Gibraltar in 2010.

He was appointed a Deputy lieutenant for Roxburgh, Ettrick and Lauderdale in 1990. He became a Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) in 1996.

A member of the House of Lords from 2010, he was the only marquess sitting in the chamber at the time of his death. Ancram was hereditary Chief of the Scottish Clan Kerr.

===Death===
Ancram died from a short illness on 1 October 2024, at the age of 79. He was succeeded by his brother, Ralph Kerr, as the 14th Marquess of Lothian.

==Name and titles==
Although his family name was Kerr, Michael Ancram was known from birth by the courtesy title Earl of Ancram as elder son and heir apparent of the 12th Marquess of Lothian. He is said to have dropped the use of this title in favour of plain &quot;Mr Michael Ancram&quot; after becoming a lawyer, supposedly because he believed it might confuse the jury if any judge were to have addressed him as &quot;My Lord&quot;.

Ancram was known to many of his friends as &quot;Crumb&quot;, a nickname attributed to a party in the sixties at which on arrival Ancram introduced himself as &quot;Lord Ancram&quot; and was duly announced as &quot;Mr Norman Crumb&quot;.

Ancram became Marquess of Lothian upon his father&#x27;s death in October 2004, but did not take up use of this title in public life whilst still sitting as an MP (although properly he should have ceased being styled by the courtesy title of &quot;Earl of Ancram&quot;). The House of Lords Act 1999 meant that, on acceding to the peerage, he was not disqualified from sitting in the House of Commons as hereditary peers no longer have an automatic right to sit in the House of Lords. Apart from Irish peers, he was, after the Viscount Thurso, and Viscount Hailsham, the third person to have sat in the House of Commons while simultaneously being a hereditary peer.

Ancram was created a life peer on 22 November 2010 as Baron Kerr of Monteviot, &quot;of Monteviot in Roxburghshire&quot;, and was introduced in the House of Lords the same day; by custom, he was referred to by his senior title as &quot;The Marquess of Lothian&quot; during all parliamentary business and in other official records such as &quot;Hansard&quot;.

As the Kerr family titles cannot pass through the female line, his younger brother Lord Ralph Kerr succeeded to his titles following his death. His elder daughter is her mother&#x27;s heir presumptive to be Lady Herries of Terregles. Ancram was also one of the five co-heirs to the barony of Butler, abeyant since 1905. Though the most junior heir by primogeniture, he held the strongest claim, as the other heirs had a lesser share to that title. On his death, his share was subdivided between his two daughters (leaving six co-heirs, each of the last baron&#x27;s three sisters now being represented by two co-heirs with 1/6 shares).

<doc id="252987" wikidata="Q1406891" url="?curid=252987" title="Armour-Geddon">
<text>Armour-Geddon is a 3D video game developed and published in 1991 by Psygnosis for Amiga, Atari ST, and MS-DOS.

A sequel was released in Europe in 1994, &quot;Armour-Geddon 2: Codename Hellfire&quot;, for the Amiga.

==Plot==
The setting for the game is post-nuclear holocaust Earth, where a privileged group of humans have made it through the war in purpose-built shelters while rest of the humankind suffered. People outside, disapproving how they have been treated, have secretly constructed a laser cannon to even the score.

==Gameplay==
The player takes the side of the Sheltered ones trying to prevent the outsiders from shooting the cannon. This is possible only by collecting all five pieces of an ancient neutron bomb and dropping it on the hostile beam cannon. In addition to this, the player must defend the base from enemy attacks and gain time by destroying generators powering the beam weapon.

There is a strategic view where player can allocate scientists to develop more effective weapons and engineers to manufacture them. In the 3D vehicle simulation, the player can pilot six different vehicles in the battlefield including heavy and light tanks, hovercraft, helicopters, fighters and bombers.

==Reception==
&quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; reviewed the game and stated that &quot;&quot;Armour-Geddon&quot; does much to recommend itself to anyone looking for a well-balanced sim.&quot; 1992 and 1994 surveys of science fiction games in &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave it two of five stars, writing that &quot;it can be fun, but resembles a Chinese take-out restaurant, i.e. a half-hour later, you are hungry for something with substance&quot;.

<text>The Perfect General is a computer wargame published in 1991 by Quantum Quality Productions.

==Publication==
The game was designed by Peter Zaccagnino and published in 1991 for the Amiga and DOS. A sequel, &quot;The Perfect General II&quot;, was released in 1994. The original game was modified for the 3DO by Game Guild in 1996 and published by Kirin Entertainment. The 3DO version includes a few scenarios which are absent from the personal computer versions. A refurbished version is available for Windows since 2003.

The rights for the original version were purchased by Mark Kinkead in 2002, and later released in 2003 as &quot;The Perfect General Internet Edition&quot; by Killer Bee Software. As the name suggests, this version can be played via Internet.

==Gameplay==
The game is a turn-based map-oriented military simulation game. Players take on the role of a military commander, managing resources and engaging in tactical battles in a hexagonal grid-based map.

Along with &quot;Modem Wars&quot; and &quot;Populous&quot;, it was one of the early games to offer an online multiplayer mode for real-time-matches via telecommunication networks. The original online-game was played via modem or null modem serial connection.

==Reception==
&quot;The Perfect General&quot; sold 75,000 copies by June 1993. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; in 1992 described The Perfect General as &quot;a wonderful game system with a mediocre AI and great two-player potential&quot;, and later named it the best wargame of the year. A 1993 survey in the magazine of wargames gave the game three-plus stars out of five, stating that it &quot;sacrifices realism for playability&quot;. A 1994 survey gave the &quot;Greatest Battles of the 20th Century&quot; two-plus stars out of five, noting the game&#x27;s ease of use and &quot;enjoyable&quot;, but inaccurate, scenarios.

In 1996, &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; declared &quot;The Perfect General&quot; the 107th-best computer game ever released. The magazine&#x27;s wargame columnist Terry Coleman named it his pick for the 12th-best computer wargame released by late 1996.

<text>Rubens Gonçalves Barrichello (; born 23 May 1972) is a Brazilian racing driver and broadcaster, who competes in the Stock Car Pro Series for Full Time Sports. Nicknamed &quot;Rubinho&quot;, Barrichello competed in Formula One from to , and twice finished runner-up in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and with Ferrari; he won 11 Grands Prix across 19 seasons. In stock car racing, Barrichello is a two-time champion of the Stock Car Pro Series in 2014 and 2022 with Full Time Sports.

Born and raised in São Paulo, Barrichello started his career in karting, winning several national titles before progressing to junior formulae in 1989. Barrichello moved to Europe the following year, winning his first title at the Formula Opel Lotus Euroseries before his victory at the 1991 British Formula Three Championship with West Surrey. He progressed to International F3000 in 1992, finishing third in his rookie season. Barrichello signed for Jordan in , making his Formula One debut at the . He retained his seat for , achieving his maiden podium at the as he finished sixth in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship. After two further seasons with Jordan—scoring another podium at the 1995 Canadian Grand Prix—Barrichello signed with Stewart for his campaign. Amidst a reliability-plagued debut season driving the SF01, Barrichello finished only three races, including second-place in Monaco. After a difficult campaign, Stewart improved greatly in , with Barrichello taking several podiums amongst his maiden pole position at the .

Barrichello signed for Ferrari in to partner Michael Schumacher, taking his maiden victory at the that year. Barrichello twice finished runner-up to Schumacher in and , contributing to five consecutive World Constructors&#x27; Championships for Ferrari with 51 podium appearances in 85 Grands Prix. After enduring a winless season, Barrichello joined Honda—later known as Brawn GP—in , finishing third in the World Drivers&#x27; Championship in and contributing to a sixth Constructors&#x27; Championship. He moved to Williams in , being appointed chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association. After two years with Williams, Barrichello retired from Formula One, having achieved 11 wins, 14 pole positions, 17 fastest laps and 68 podiums, the latter of which remains the record for a non-World Champion.

Outside of Formula One, Barrichello competed in the IndyCar Series in 2012 with KV Racing Technology. He then returned to Brazil to participate in the Stock Car Series, winning the championship in 2014 and 2022. In endurance racing, Barrichello finished runner-up at the 24 Hours of Daytona in 2016 with Wayne Taylor Racing. From 2013 to 2014, he was a commentator and pundit for TV Globo, later leaving to co-host motorsport YouTube channel &quot;Acelerados&quot;.

==Early life==
The paternal side of his family comes from Veneto, Italy (from the town of Riese, in the province of Treviso). His maternal side of the family is of Portuguese origin. Both his father and paternal grandfather are also named Rubens, and Barrichello shares his father&#x27;s birthday: 23 May. Therefore, Rubens Barrichello was known as &quot;Rubinho&quot; (Portuguese for &quot;little Rubens&quot;), which has become his nickname.

Barrichello won five karting titles in Brazil before going to Europe to race in the Formula Vauxhall Lotus series in 1990. In his first year, he won the championship, a feat he replicated the following year in the British Formula 3 Championship, beating David Coulthard. He very nearly joined Formula One, the highest category of single seater racing, at just 19 years of age. Instead he competed in Formula 3000 in 1992. He finished third in the championship, and joined the Jordan Formula One team for the 1993 Formula One season. During this time, and also early in his Formula One career, Barrichello lived in Cambridge, Cambridgeshire, UK.

==Formula One career==

===Jordan (1993–1996)===

In Barrichello&#x27;s third race, the , he started from 12th place in very wet conditions but was fourth by the end of the first lap. He ran as high as second and was running third, having passed the Williams of Damon Hill and Alain Prost, before encountering a fuel pressure problem. His Jordan&#x27;s reliability in 1993 was poor, and he finished few races. Barrichello regularly outpaced his more experienced teammates, Ivan Capelli and Thierry Boutsen. In the , he almost scored his first Grand Prix point (and the team&#x27;s first that year) but Michael Andretti passed him on the final lap for the sixth and final points-scoring position. His only points finish of the season came at the with fifth place, ahead of his new teammate Eddie Irvine. These 2 points put him in 18th place in the standings.

 started with a fourth place in Brazil and a third place at Aida, which was his first podium finish. These results put Barrichello in second place in the drivers&#x27; ranking, behind Michael Schumacher, who had won the two races. However, at the , he suffered a violent crash during Friday practice, hitting the wall at the &quot;Variante Bassa&quot; and flipping the car. The accident knocked him unconscious and threatened his life, with his tongue blocking his airway. Barrichello credited the on-track work of Sid Watkins for saving his life. The race weekend saw a succession of serious accidents, of which two were fatal: Roland Ratzenberger died during Saturday&#x27;s qualifying session when he crashed his Simtek at the &quot;curva Villeneuve&quot;, while on Sunday, during the race, Barrichello&#x27;s mentor Ayrton Senna crashed his Williams at &quot;Tamburello&quot; and also died. Barrichello was deeply affected by the deaths.

Later in the season, he took pole position at the , and led some laps at Estoril. His pole position at Spa-Francorchamps set the record for the youngest driver to secure pole position at that time. He concluded the season with fourth place in Adelaide. He finished the season sixth overall in the Drivers&#x27; Championship with 19 points, outscoring Irvine, who scored six.
During the season, Barrichello scored a second-place finish in Montreal, but the Jordan cars were less reliable than in 1994 mostly because Jordan took over the works Peugeot engine contract from the McLaren team. In three races he lost seven points on the final lap—a high-speed collision with Mark Blundell at Silverstone, and mechanical failures at Barcelona and in Hungary. Barrichello finished the season in 11th with 11 points, one ahead of Irvine.

There were high hopes for . The Benson &amp; Hedges cigarette brand brought an infusion of sponsorship to the team. Barrichello was amongst the frontrunners in Brazil, the second race of the season, before spinning off after his brakes overheated. However, as the season progressed, Jordan became less competitive. Barrichello&#x27;s relationship with team owner Eddie Jordan soured during 1996, and at the end of the year, after being linked to strong teams, including Benetton (the seat was later filled by Gerhard Berger due to the Austrian bringing in more sponsorship), he left for the newly formed Stewart Grand Prix. His final season at Jordan resulted in 14 points.

===Stewart (1997–1999)===
Stewart&#x27;s debut season in saw frequent reliability problems, and Barrichello finished only three races. The highlight was a second-place finish in Monaco, which put him 13th in the standings. Teammate Jan Magnussen scored no points. The same year, Barrichello married Silvana Giaffone on 24 February. She is a cousin of Brazilian Indy Car driver Felipe Giaffone and a niece of the Stock Car Brasil champions, Affonso Giaffone Filho and Zeca Giaffone.

 was not much better for Stewart, with two fifth places being the team&#x27;s best results. Despite the poor reliability of the team, Barrichello consistently beat teammate Magnussen, which resulted in the latter being dropped at the , replaced by Jos Verstappen, another teammate beaten by Barrichello.

 was a much better year for the Stewart team. Barrichello qualified third at his home race in Brazil, outpacing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s Ferrari, and led some laps, until his engine blew near &#x27;Subida dos Boxes&#x27;. He also took pole position in the wet qualifying session in France, and three podium finishes, at the San Marino, French, and European Grands Prix. The latter race was won by his teammate Johnny Herbert. Despite this, Barrichello again generally outpaced his teammate. Over the course of the year, he caught the eye of Ferrari boss Jean Todt, and he was signed for the season.

===Ferrari (2000–2005)===

In , Barrichello achieved his first Grand Prix victory at the at Hockenheim, when he and the team chose to stay on dry-weather tyres when it was raining on part of the circuit. This risky call saw him leap-frog the McLarens who chose to pit for wet weather tyres to win the race, having started from 18th on the grid. This was the longest any driver in Formula One history had waited for a maiden Grand Prix win at the time. Barrichello had a consistent debut season for Ferrari, finishing most races on the podium, but was outscored by Michael Schumacher, Mika Häkkinen and David Coulthard. Barrichello finished the season ranked fourth after supporting Schumacher as he battled and defeated Häkkinen for the Drivers&#x27; Championship, and helping Ferrari win the Constructors&#x27; Championship.

Barrichello finished the season in third place, achieving a total of 10 podium finishes and scoring a total of 56 championship points. He nearly achieved a win in Monza, in which the Ferrari pit crew performed badly. He finished the season winless, and again he played a major supporting role for Schumacher, helping him win his second Drivers&#x27; Championship with Ferrari and helping the team win the Constructors&#x27; Championship for the third consecutive year.

Barrichello&#x27;s success at Ferrari continued in , when he won four races for the team and finished a career-best second place in the Drivers&#x27; Championship, scoring 77 championship points. The year was marked by controversy, however, when Ferrari team orders required Barrichello to allow the trailing Schumacher to pass him on the final straight of the to take victory. Schumacher exchanged podium places with Barrichello at the podium ceremony and gave Barrichello the winner&#x27;s trophy. The drivers were fined for disrupting podium protocol and Ferrari&#x27;s blatant team orders led to the FIA banning team orders beginning in .

Barrichello finished the season in fourth place, scoring 65 points, including wins at Silverstone and Suzuka, and again played a crucial role in helping Schumacher and Ferrari win the drivers&#x27; and Constructors&#x27; Championships. In the season, Barrichello finished second behind Schumacher in only seven of the first thirteen races, but he won both the 2004 Italian Grand Prix and the 2004 Chinese Grand Prix to clinch second place in the championship, finishing the year with 114 points and 14 podiums. Though Barrichello had good cars during his Ferrari era, his best result at his home race was a third place in 2004. He failed to finish eleven of the nineteen Brazilian Grands Prix in which he competed.

In the season, Ferrari lacked the pace of previous years because of the changing of tyre rules. Ferrari used Bridgestone tyres, which were less effective than those of their competitors Michelin. Barrichello&#x27;s best results this season were two second places in Melbourne and then at the at Indianapolis, when all the Michelin-running cars retired after the formation lap, leaving only six cars in the race. He finished the season in eighth place in the drivers&#x27; standings with 38 points, his worst season with Ferrari.

In an August 2022 interview with Felipe Massa, he states that Barrichello had a contract with Ferrari running until 2006, after which he was to be replaced with Kimi Räikkönen for the 2007 season. But in early 2005, Honda had approached him to drive for them, and unhappy with the treatment Ferrari had given him, decided to ask the team to terminate his contract in 2005. He was thus replaced by Massa for the 2006 season.

===Honda (2006–2008)===
In August 2005 he announced that he would be leaving Ferrari at the end of the year to join Honda. Barrichello&#x27;s lucky number is &quot;11,&quot; which was the number his kart bore when he won his first race. In , his new teammate Jenson Button gave Barrichello the number for his car in goodwill. Barrichello was initially outpaced by Button, and claimed that the car did not suit his driving style, particularly under braking. After modifications to the car he was able to be more competitive. In Monaco, he nearly got his first podium with the team, but then he was given a drive-through penalty for speeding in the pit lane and finished fourth. Though he lost a podium, it was the best result at the Monaco Grand Prix for Honda (as a team) or any Japanese team. Aiming to raise charitable founds for the Brazilian children, for the race Barrichello exchanged helmet liveries with Tony Kanaan, a Brazilian Indy Car driver and one of his best friends; and in the same weekend, Kanaan raced in the 2006 Indianapolis 500 race using Barrichello&#x27;s helmet livery. Barrichello qualified third for the , ahead of Schumacher and Räikkönen. He finished the season seventh in the drivers&#x27; standings with 30 points, 26 behind Button.
Barrichello did not score any points during the 2007 season (unprecedented fact in his career in the category), because of the Honda RA107&#x27;s lack of pace. Despite retiring only twice, a ninth place in the British Grand Prix was his best result of the season and he only once qualified in the top 10. Despite this, Honda confirmed on 19 July 2007, that Barrichello would remain with the team as a race driver for the season. This gave him the opportunity of making the five race starts he required to break Riccardo Patrese&#x27;s record for the driver that has started the most Grands Prix, a record that had stood for 14 years.

In the first race of the 2008 season, Barrichello qualified 10th, ahead of Button. He finished 6th but was disqualified for ignoring a red light at the pit exit. He also received a stop-and-go penalty during the race for entering the pits while they were closed during a safety car period. In Malaysia, gearbox problems limited his performance and he finished 13th. In Bahrain he again finished out of the points.

The was Barrichello&#x27;s 257th Grand Prix, breaking Patrese&#x27;s record of 256 Grand Prix starts and becoming the most experienced driver in F1 history. The particular Grand Prix at which he broke this record has been disputed, as he technically did not start some races, such as the 2002 Spanish Grand Prix, but Barrichello and Honda chose Turkey to be the location of the official celebrations.

In Monaco, he scored his first points since 2006 and in Canada he scored consecutive points, finishing 7th after starting in 9th position. He led some laps because of the appearance of the safety car, but fell back down the order towards the end of the race. At Magny-Cours, Barrichello did not repeat his performance from the two previous races and qualified in 17th. After a gearbox change, he dropped to 20th. In the race, he finished 14th.

At Silverstone, which he said he considers to be his second home, he qualified 16th, outpacing Button. With heavy rain on race day, through good use of an extreme wet tyre he finished 3rd, achieving his first podium since 2005. However, in Germany, a collision with David Coulthard ended his hopes for points. In Hungary, he was lapped by the leader, repeating the same performance in Valencia. In Belgium he qualified 16th but had to retire because of a gearbox fault. At a wet Monza, he was second-fastest in Friday practice and started from 16th on the grid. He managed to get up to 9th but as a result of using the wrong type of tyre in his second pit stop he ended up 17th. At the first ever night race in Singapore he was in a good position to score some points after pitting before the pit lane closed for the safety car period, but shortly afterwards the engine failed and he had to retire. In Japan he started from 17th on the grid, but managed to get up to 13th by the end of the race. In China he managed to get into Q2 for the first time in ten races, and would have started 14th. But after Mark Webber had his ten place penalty for an engine change added he was moved up to 13th. On race day he had a good start, and got up to 10th early on and held a strong mid-table position all race and finished 11th, five places ahead of Button, who had struggled all weekend.

At his home Grand Prix in Brazil, he was sporting an alternative helmet design in tribute to Ingo Hoffmann, and finished 15th.

On 5 December 2008 Honda announced that they were quitting F1, because of the economic crisis. This led to months of uncertainty as to whether a buyer could be found, and whether they would retain Barrichello.

===Brawn GP (2009)===

Just weeks before the season opener in Melbourne, team manager Ross Brawn purchased the Honda team, renaming it Brawn GP and removing the threat of possible closure. Barrichello was the subject of persistent rumours suggesting he would lose his seat to the young Bruno Senna, nephew of his friend, idol and mentor Ayrton Senna. Ultimately Brawn elected to retain Barrichello to partner Jenson Button in 2009. At Barcelona during the final pre-season test, both Barrichello and Button surprised the paddock with extremely competitive lap times, outperforming others by as much as two seconds, and foreshadowing the performance the team would show in the early races.

In Melbourne, Barrichello topped the timesheets in the first two elements of qualifying, but qualified second on the grid behind teammate Button. Despite a poor start caused by his engine slipping into anti-stall, he did well to recover and lost only a couple of positions at the start. However, he sustained damage to the front wing and rear diffuser in the first corner incident when he was bumped from behind by Heikki Kovalainen in his McLaren that saw him hit Mark Webber in the Red Bull damaging Webber&#x27;s car as well as his hopes of a good finish. Despite this, Barrichello ultimately finished the race in second place after Sebastian Vettel and Robert Kubica collided with just 2 laps remaining. He started eighth in Malaysia after getting a grid penalty for a gearbox change and finished the race in fifth place after the race was abandoned at Sepang due to heavy rain.
At Shanghai, he outpaced Button in qualifying, but struggled with his car&#x27;s brakes when one of them stopped working in the first stint and finished in fourth, recording the race&#x27;s fastest lap. In Bahrain, his front wing adjustor failed during his qualifying run thereby compromising his aggressive 3-pit-stop race strategy, and thus managed only fifth place. He qualified third on the grid for the , but overtook Button and second place man Vettel on the first straight, to lead the race in the first corner. He was unable to capitalise on his three-stop strategy as a result of a lack of pace caused by massive amounts of understeer on his third set of tyres in his third stint, finishing behind Button, who changed to a 2-stop strategy during the race.

At Monaco, Barrichello was pipped for pole by a late-charging Button and Ferrari&#x27;s Kimi Räikkönen. A good start saw him leapfrog the Finn into Sainte Devote. Barrichello&#x27;s supersoft tyres did not last as well as Button&#x27;s in the first stint and he pitted earlier than planned, and Button took a commanding lead. The top three remained unchanged for the duration of the race, save some reshuffling during the pit stop windows. At the completion of lap 47, Barrichello became the driver who has completed most laps in Formula One history, surpassing Michael Schumacher&#x27;s total of 13,909 laps. In Turkey, he again had gearbox problems and retired for the first time in the season, leaving Button to increase his points advantage, while in Britain, Barrichello qualified second behind Vettel, before beating Button for the first time in 2009 en route to third place.
In Germany, Barrichello took the lead at the first corner but after his first stop, he came out behind Felipe Massa who held him up. A fuel rig problem during his second stop meant that he finished the race in sixth, a place behind teammate Jenson Button. After the race he publicly blamed Brawn GP saying &quot;It was a good show from the team in how to lose a race&quot; and &quot;They made me lose the race&quot;. Team principal Ross Brawn said of the incident &quot;He had the 11th-fastest time of the race. You can&#x27;t win a race with that speed&quot;. However, he refused to criticize Barrichello for his outburst. Barrichello has since admitted he overreacted, and he would not have won as the Red Bull cars were half a second a lap quicker than him.

In Hungary, the Brawn cars struggled and lacked pace because of problems with the tyres and aerodynamics. Barrichello finished 10th, his first finish outside the points in 2009, and three places behind Button. In Valencia, Barrichello took his 10th Grand Prix win, his first in five years and the 100th win by a Brazilian driver in Formula One, allowing him to move up to 2nd in the Championship. He paid tribute to injured compatriot Felipe Massa with a plaque on the top of his race helmet.
At Spa, he qualified 4th, but suffered from anti-stall for the third time in 2009 and he found himself last, but missed the first lap crash which took out four drivers including teammate Button. While the safety car was out he pitted and changed strategy which enabled him to climb back up to 7th. During the last three laps the car had an engine oil leak, but he still managed to finish, before his car caught fire in the pit lane after the race. At Monza, he qualified 5th, despite carrying more fuel to try a different strategy with only one stop. After passing Kovalainen at the start, Barrichello managed not to lose too much time, as he had the advantage of just one stop against Hamilton, Räikkönen and Sutil&#x27;s two-stop strategy. By Hamilton&#x27;s second pit stop, Button and Barrichello were running first and second. Hamilton tried to pressure Button by forcing his car, but on the last lap he crashed, giving third place to Räikkönen, and fourth to Sutil. Barrichello won the 11th race in his Formula One career, and gained more points on Button in their fight for the world title.

In Singapore, he had to change his gearbox and take a five place grid penalty. During qualifying he crashed his car while in fifth place. As a result of Nick Heidfeld starting from the pitlane, Barrichello would start 9th and finished sixth, while Button finished fifth. In Japan, he originally qualified 5th, but was given a five place grid penalty for failing to slow down during a yellow flag situation near the end of Q2 when Sébastien Buemi crashed. He was on course to finish fifth with Button behind, which would have been enough for Brawn GP to clinch the Constructors&#x27; Championship, but a safety car period in the closing stages of the race for Jaime Alguersuari&#x27;s crash meant that Nico Rosberg and Heidfeld were able to stay out ahead and save fuel, dropping Barrichello to seventh. With Button finishing eighth, Barrichello closed the points deficit to fourteen and putting Brawn almost out of reach for the Constructors&#x27; title.

In Brazil, Barrichello claimed pole in a rain-soaked, qualifying session with title rivals Button and Vettel down the order in 14th and 16th, respectively. A puncture cost Barrichello a chance of taking the title to the final race, as he failed to secure enough of an advantage over Button to do so. Button finished fifth to become champion. In Abu Dhabi he qualified and finished 4th. With Vettel winning the race, he secured second in the standings, with Barrichello finishing third in the championship with 77 points.

===Williams (2010–2011)===

In 2010, Barrichello was offered a contract by McLaren. He did not accept because he had already signed a contract with Williams, and did not want to renege on his pledge to that team. The McLaren seat was ultimately filled by Barrichello&#x27;s 2009 teammate Jenson Button. On 2 November 2009, Williams confirmed Barrichello and Nico Hülkenberg as their official race drivers for the season. This meant that Barrichello would be in Formula One for at least another season, and would go on to become the first driver in Formula One history to compete in over 300 Grands Prix.

In pre-season testing, Barrichello finished at the top of the timesheets once, because of rain. In some sessions, he was outpaced by his rookie teammate Hülkenberg. Williams was the second team in terms of kilometres covered and showed some reliability, but were off pace from front-runners Red Bull, Ferrari, and McLaren.

At the first race of the season in Bahrain, Barrichello qualified eleventh on the grid, and finished tenth in the race. In Australia, he went on to finish eighth, moving him to within two points of Senna&#x27;s mark. He stalled on the grid in Malaysia due to an overheating clutch, but recovered to twelfth place at the finish. In China, he finished twelfth again. In Spain he benefited from Lewis Hamilton&#x27;s late crash to score two points, finishing in 9th, despite starting 18th on the grid and equalling Senna&#x27;s record.

In Monaco, he qualified ninth and moved up to sixth position through the first corner. Later, he had a suspension failure caused by a loose drain cover and crashed heavily. After crashing he threw the car&#x27;s steering wheel out, as he was sitting in the middle of a 120 mph corner with his car on fire. This was then run over by Karun Chandhok&#x27;s Hispania.

At the , he qualified fifteenth. Due to an overheating clutch at the start, he dropped down to 20th position. A poor pit stop failed to help his cause and he finished in fourteenth position. It was similar at the , when Barrichello again finished in fourteenth. He qualified eleventh, narrowly missing Q3 but his anti-stall system kicked in at the start of the race. After recovering well, he later collided with Jaime Alguersuari when Alguersuari came across too late to cover his line, the damage blocking Barrichello&#x27;s left brake duct.

In Valencia, the Williams team brought big upgrades and ran their version of the F-duct. Barrichello qualified ninth with the same time as his teammate Hülkenberg. He was running seventh when the safety car was deployed at the end of lap nine, and pulled straight into the pits. When the safety car pitted he was able to fend off Kubica to finish fourth, his highest finish so far of the season. Post-race, nine cars were investigated for speeding under the safety car, and were later given a five-second penalty. This made no difference to Barrichello&#x27;s position, and he became the highest-scoring Brazilian driver in Formula One history, overhauling Ayrton Senna&#x27;s career tally of 614 points, that Barrichello had been tied on since the . He added further points to his total with fifth at Silverstone, and tenth in Hungary, with a twelfth at Hockenheim in between.

Barrichello celebrated his 300th Grand Prix at the , but retired in damp conditions after colliding with Fernando Alonso&#x27;s Ferrari on the first lap. Before the race, he was elected as Chairman of the Grand Prix Drivers&#x27; Association to replace the outgoing Nick Heidfeld.

At Monza, he qualified in tenth, and had a rather lonely run in the race to finish in the same place to score another point. In Singapore, the FW32 sported a new front wing, and Barrichello put this to good use to set the sixth fastest time in qualifying, although Williams technical director Sam Michael reckoned the car was fast enough to be a couple of positions higher. In the race despite losing places to Robert Kubica and Nico Rosberg at the start, Barrichello had a solid run to sixth at the finish. In Japan, he qualified in a strong seventh, he raced strongly before fading to ninth as he was overtaken by the two Saubers towards the closing stages of the race.

In Korea he qualified tenth despite being blocked by Michael Schumacher. In a wet race he suffered heavy tyre wear on the intermediates that he was running on, and in the closing stages of the race he was passed by Robert Kubica and Vitantonio Liuzzi, dropping him to seventh place at the finish. At Interlagos he qualified a strong sixth in variable conditions with teammate Hülkenberg starting from pole position. After a delayed pitstop, his traditional bad luck on home soil returned when he suffered a puncture after briefly colliding with Jaime Alguersuari, costing him any chance of scoring points. In Abu Dhabi he again qualified strongly in seventh place, and maintained that position shortly after the start. However, when the safety car was deployed following Michael Schumacher&#x27;s and Vitantonio Liuzzi&#x27;s crash, many drivers like Robert Kubica, Vitaly Petrov and Nico Rosberg took advantage of this by pitting early. This had a negative effect as they did not need to pit again, and Barrichello finished outside of the points.

On 15 November 2010, Williams confirmed Barrichello as one of the team&#x27;s drivers for the season. His teammate in 2011 was Pastor Maldonado.

In Australia he retired with a transmission problem. He retired again in Malaysia with leaking hydraulics. He finished outside the points in the next three races before a pair of ninth places in Monaco and Canada. He came twelfth in Valencia, and thirteenth in Britain, but retired in Germany because of an oil leak. After that, he finished every race outside the points, but made no further retirements. His final race at the 2011 Brazilian Grand Prix was a quiet farewell where he finished 14th, ahead of former teammate Michael Schumacher.

In a 2022 interview, Barrichello revealed he was fired by Frank Williams through a phone call in early January 2012, and on 17 January 2012, Williams confirmed that Bruno Senna would replace Barrichello at Williams for the season. Senna was chosen due to his financial backing.

===Planned comeback with Caterham (2014)===
Former Caterham F1 team principal Manfredi Ravetto said in an interview that a contract was signed with Barrichello to replace Kamui Kobayashi for the final three races of the season, providing the car would be competitive. It was not, and the Caterham team went into administration, so Barrichello did not join the team.

==IndyCar career==
On 25 January 2012, American journalist Robin Miller reported that Barrichello was to test an IndyCar for KV Racing Technology with friend Tony Kanaan. The test was held at Sebring over 30–31 January and 1 February. He also tested for the team at Infineon Raceway in late February.

On 1 March 2012 Barrichello joined KV Racing Technology for the 2012 season, to drive the team&#x27;s number eight entry alongside Kanaan and E. J. Viso, sponsored by Brazilian construction company, Embrase. Barrichello raced in his first Indianapolis 500 on 27 May 2012. He led a total of two laps and finished 11th, and in doing so won the 2012 Indianapolis 500 Rookie of the Year title. During the rest of the season he took two top six finishes, and finished the year in 12th position in the championship.

==Stock Car Pro Series (formerly Stock Car Brasil)==
Barrichello joined a Peugeot team of the Brazilian racing series Stock Car Brasil (now called &quot;Stock Car Pro Series&quot;) for the final three races of the 2012 season as a guest driver. Since 2013 he drives a Chevrolet as a regular member of the Full Time Sports team. Since Nonô Figueiredo already used the number 11, Barrichello&#x27;s lucky number, he chose 111 instead. In the 2013 season, he finished the season in 8th place overall, with a best race result was a second-place finish.

Continuing to drive a Chevrolet for Full Time Sports in 2014, Barrichello was crowned the 2014 champion, winning two races and securing a further 4 podium finishes. This was Barrichello&#x27;s first championship in 23 years, dating back to his 1991 British Formula 3 title. In 2015, Barrichello finished in 4th place overall. In 2016 he claimed three wins and nine podiums, finishing second overall behind Felipe Fraga. He finished 5th in 2017, 4th in 2018, 5th in 2019, 6th in 2020 and 2021, earning at least one individual win each year. In 2022 he won the series for the second time with three victories in the individual races.

In 2020, Toyota sent him to Argentina to compete in the Super TC 2000 and Top Race V6 championships.

==Australian S5000==
In September 2019, Barrichello made a one-off open wheel comeback when he appeared at the Sandown Raceway in Melbourne, Australia for the inaugural round of Australia&#x27;s new S5000 class. S5000, which were visioned as a modern day version of the old Formula 5000, used an Australian modified version of the Ligier JS F3, but powered by a 5.2L Ford Coyote V8 engine producing .

After having a shakedown run to get to know the JS F3-S5000 at the official S5000 test-day at the Phillip Island Grand Prix Circuit, racing for Australia&#x27;s Team BRM with his car painted red reminiscent of his old F1 Ferrari&#x27;s, Barrichello qualified 3rd at Sandown but trouble in both races saw him finish 7th in Heat 1 and 5th in Heat 2 for overall 4th place at the meeting.

==Helmet==

Barrichello&#x27;s helmet is white with an orange-red oval shape on the rear, an orange-red shape around the visor, an orange red line under the helmet and a blue circle on the top with azure and sky blue cylinders—similar to those on the helmet of former world champion Emerson Fittipaldi—with a golden star in the middle (usually five-pointed, although the recent designs had it six-pointed). The white part of the helmet changed to silver for some races during the 1999 season. After signing for Ferrari in 2000, teammate Michael Schumacher changed the colours of his helmet at the Monaco Grand Prix to avoid confusion, since the two drivers&#x27; original helmet colours were identical (the only real difference being that Schumacher&#x27;s helmet had a red band which wrapped around its back from the visor, fading into gold and back).

At the 2001 Brazilian Grand Prix, the oval shape and the shape around the visor were painted to resemble the Brazilian flag, and at his 300th Grand Prix, his helmet once again carried the Brazilian flag colours. At the 2006 Monaco Grand Prix he had the helmet livery of fellow Brazilian and good friend Tony Kanaan, who in turn had Barrichello&#x27;s helmet livery while racing in 2006 Indianapolis 500 which was held on the same day because they said it would be the closest either of them would get to competing in the biggest race of the year of the category the other raced in. At the 2008 Brazilian Grand Prix, Barrichello drove with a helmet in tribute to Ingo Hoffmann, former F1 driver and multiple Stock Car Brasil champion who was retiring that year. At the 1995 and 2011 Brazilian Grands Prix, he wore a helmet painted to include elements of his own helmet design, and the classic design of Ayrton Senna&#x27;s helmet.

During the 2009 season he used the Brawn GP fluorescent colours on his helmet.

==Personal life==
Barrichello lives in São Paulo. For commuting between races, Barrichello owned an Embraer Legacy 600.

Barrichello formerly held the fastest time by a Formula One driver around the &quot;Top Gear&quot; test track during the show&#x27;s Star in a Reasonably Priced Car segment. His lap time of 1:44.3 put him ahead of the Stig by 0.1 seconds. This led to Jeremy Clarkson making frequent references to the Stig developing a deep-seated hatred of Barrichello.

In February 2018, Barrichello was rushed to hospital after suffering headaches where it was discovered that he had a benign tumour which was later removed.
On F1&#x27;s podcast, &quot;Beyond The Grid&quot;, he revealed he got divorced in 2019.

Barrichello&#x27;s sons Eduardo and Fernando are also racing drivers, with Eduardo currently competing in the 2024 Stock Car Pro Series and Fernando contesting the 2024 Euroformula Open Championship.

<text>Vassar College ( ) is a private liberal arts college in Poughkeepsie, New York, United States. Founded in 1861 by Matthew Vassar, it was the second degree-granting institution of higher education for women in the United States. The college became coeducational in 1969. The college offers BA degrees in more than fifty majors. Vassar College&#x27;s varsity sports teams, known as the Brewers, play in the NCAA Division III as members of the Liberty League. Currently, there are close to 2,500 students.

The college is one of the historic Seven Sisters. The Vassar campus comprises over and more than 100 buildings. A designated arboretum, the campus features more than 200 species of trees, a native plant preserve, and a ecological preserve.

==History==

Vassar was founded as a women&#x27;s school under the name Vassar Female College in 1861. Its first president was Milo P. Jewett, who had previously been first president of another women&#x27;s school, Judson College; he led a staff of ten professors and twenty-one instructors. After one year, its founder, Matthew Vassar, had the word &quot;Female&quot; removed from the name, prompting some local residents of Poughkeepsie, New York, to quip that its founder believed it might one day admit male students. The college became coeducational in 1969.

Vassar was the second of the Seven Sisters colleges, higher education schools that were strictly for women, and historically sister institutions to the all-male Ivy League colleges. It was chartered by its namesake, brewer Matthew Vassar, in 1861 in the Hudson Valley, about north of New York City. The first person appointed to the Vassar faculty was astronomer Maria Mitchell, in 1865.

Vassar adopted coeducation in 1969. Immediately following World War II, Vassar accepted a small number of male students on the G.I. Bill. The formal decision to become co-ed came after its trustees declined an offer to merge with Yale University, its sibling institution, in the wave of mergers between the historically all-male colleges of the Ivy League and their Seven Sisters counterparts.
In its early years, Vassar was associated with the social elite of the Protestant establishment. E. Digby Baltzell writes that &quot;upper-class WASP families educated their children at colleges such as Harvard, Princeton, Yale, and Vassar.&quot; A select and elite few of Vassar&#x27;s students were allowed entry into the school&#x27;s secret society Delta Sigma Rho, founded in 1922. Before becoming President of the United States, Franklin Delano Roosevelt was a Trustee.

Approximately 2,450 students attend Vassar, and 98% live on campus. About 60% come from public high schools, and 40% come from private schools (both independent and religious). Vassar is currently 56% women and 44% men, at national average for national liberal arts colleges. Students are taught by more than 336 faculty members, virtually all holding the doctorate degree or its equivalent. The student-faculty ratio is 8:1, average class size, 17.

In recent freshman classes, students of color constituted 32–38% of matriculants. International students from over 60 countries make up 8-10% of the student body. In May 2007, Vassar returned to a need-blind admissions policy without regard to a student&#x27;s financial status.

Vassar president Catharine Bond Hill departed in 2016. She was succeeded by Elizabeth Howe Bradley in 2017.

The college was listed as a census-designated place (Vassar College CDP) in 2019.

===Presidents===

==Campus==
The campus is in Poughkeepsie Town, adjacent to Poughkeepsie City. The area around the campus appeared as a census-designated place (CDP) in the 2020 U.S. Census, with a population of 2,472.

===Architecture===

Vassar&#x27;s campus, also an arboretum, is and has more than 100 buildings, ranging in style from Collegiate Gothic to International, with several buildings of architectural interest. At the center of campus stands Main Building, one of the best examples of Second Empire architecture in the United States. When it was opened, Main Building was the largest building in the U.S. in terms of floor space. It formerly housed the entire college, including classrooms, dormitories, museum, library, and dining halls. The building was designed by Smithsonian architect James Renwick Jr. and was completed in 1865. It was preceded on campus by the original observatory. Both buildings are National Historic Landmarks. Rombout House was purchased by the college in 1915 and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1982.

Eero Saarinen made designs for several Vassar dormitories, but only one, the Emma Hartman Noyes House, was completed in 1958. Built for roughly 160 students, it was the first part of a circular construction that was to be continued in &quot;Noyes II.&quot; The starkly modernist building&#x27;s high cost and structural difficulties with the windows, however, led administrators to leave it at one. The dorm&#x27;s common area is famous for its futuristic design; readings and concerts are held there regularly. The Noyes building was also the home of an all-female football team, the Noyes Nymphs, who competed against Ivy League teams in the 1960s and 1970s.

===Libraries===

Vassar is home to one of the largest undergraduate library collections in the U.S. The library collection today – which actually encompasses eight libraries at Vassar – contains about 1 million volumes and 7,500 serial, periodical and newspaper titles, as well as an extensive collection of microfilm and microfiche, with special collections of Ellen Swallow Richards, Albert Einstein, Mary McCarthy, and Elizabeth Bishop. Vassar has been a Federal Depository library for selected U.S. Government documents since 1943 and currently receives approximately 25% of the titles available through the Federal Depository Program.

The interior and exterior of the Van Ingen Art Library was renovated from June 2008 – May 2009 in an effort to restore its original design and appearance. This was the library&#x27;s first major renovation since its construction in 1937.
===Frances Lehman Loeb Art Center===
In November 2016, the gallery opened the Hoene Hoy Photography gallery on the second floor, named after Anne Hoene Hoy from the class of 1963.

===Capital improvements===

In 2011, Vassar embarked on a $120 million project to improve science facilities at the college, centering on the construction of a new Bridge for Laboratory Sciences.

===Housing===
The majority of students in their first three years live on campus in the nine residence halls. Main House occupies the upper floors of Main Building, constructed at the college&#x27;s founding. To accommodate a growing student body, Strong House was constructed in 1893. Strong was made all-women&#x27;s housing after the college went coeducational in 1969; the house now also accepts nonbinary and other gender-nonconforming students. Similar Elizabethan-style houses—Raymond, Lathrop, and Davison—were built from 1897 to 1902 to form a residential quadrangle. A nine-story Tudor-style dormitory, Jewett House, was constructed in 1907 on the north end of the quadrangle. The second largest dormitory, Josselyn House, was built in 1912 to Jewett&#x27;s east. Cushing House was constructed outside of the quadrangle in 1927. In a departure from the architecture of the other dormitories, Noyes House was built in 1958 in a distinct modernist style, curved around a large green.

Most fourth-year students live in groups of four or five in on-campus apartments. Vassar has three apartment complexes: the Terrace Apartments, the Town Houses, and the South Commons. A cooperative house, Ferry House, opened in 1951 and houses 20 students. Vassar guarantees housing to all full-time students.

As part of a master plan to renovate all the dormitories, Jewett, Davison, and Josselyn were renovated from 2002 to 2011. The college opted for minor improvements to the rest of the dorms due to cost. 

Vassar maintains housing for faculty; the current complex opened in 2023. The previous faculty housing facility, Williams House, was to be demolished after 2020. School-age dependents living on the Vassar faculty complex, as well as other areas in the Vassar College CDP, are within the Arlington Central School District, which operates Arlington High School.

===Rankings===
The 2025 edition of &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s &quot;Best Colleges&quot; ranked Vassar as tied for the 12th best liberal arts college in the U.S. out of 211 rated. In previous years the college was ranked by &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; as high as tenth. In 2024, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Vassar second for &quot;Best Colleges for Veterans&quot;, 29th for &quot;Best Value&quot;, 15th for &quot;Top Performers on Social Mobility&quot;, and tied for 20th in &quot;Best Undergraduate Teaching&quot;. It also ranked Vassar tied for fourth among top liberal arts colleges for economic diversity as measured by low-income students receiving federal Pell Grants.

In its 2021 edition, &quot;Washington Monthly&quot; ranked Vassar 11th among 215 liberal arts colleges in the U.S. based on its contribution to the public good, as measured by social mobility, research, and promoting public service.

In its 2020 edition, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; rated Vassar first for &quot;Best Financial Aid&quot; of all colleges and universities in the United States. In its 2018 edition, &quot;The Princeton Review&quot; rated Vassar second best for financial aid and 41st best for &quot;best value&quot;. In 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; rated Vassar 26th among liberal arts colleges and 102nd overall in its America&#x27;s Top Colleges ranking, which includes 500 military academies, national universities, and liberal arts colleges. &quot;Kiplinger&#x27;s Personal Finance&quot; places Vassar 11th in its 2019 ranking of the 149 best value liberal arts colleges in the United States. &quot;Money&quot; magazine ranked Vassar 145th in the country out of 739 schools evaluated for its 2020 &quot;Best Colleges for Your Money&quot; edition.

In an article in &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, Vassar president emeritus Catharine Bond Hill argued that rankings &quot;will always be limited in what they can tell consumers. Part of higher education&#x27;s role about the rankings should be to remind students and their families that these are only one piece of information that they should take into account in deciding where to go to college. Intangibles will and should play a role in these decisions, but that doesn&#x27;t mean we shouldn&#x27;t also look at the tangibles&quot;.
===Post-graduation outcomes===
Over half of Vassar graduates pursue advanced study within five years of graduation, including one-fifth immediately post-graduation. Of the seniors who applied to medical school in 2017, 76% were accepted; to law school, 96% were accepted.

==Student life==

===Traditions===
Founder&#x27;s Day is an annual campus festival at Vassar College that usually takes place in late April or early May. It started as a surprise birthday party for college founder Matthew Vassar&#x27;s seventy-fourth birthday and evolved into an annual celebration. Originally, Founder&#x27;s Day was a spontaneous event consisting of lectures, but was soon replaced with plays, pageants, and more recreational activities. Circus and fair activities followed, with the eventual addition of the modern day music events over the course of two days. More recently themes have been added, including &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, Dinosaurs, Vintage 1800s Vassar, Nickelodeon, Nintendo, and &quot;Candyland&quot;. Recent artists at Founder&#x27;s Day have included The Walkmen, Edan, DJ /rupture, Odd Nosdam, Jel, Toro y Moi, and Odesza.

===Extracurricular organizations===
* The Night Owls, established in the 1940s, are, as of 2017, one of the oldest extant collegiate a cappella groups in the United States, and one of nine vocal music groups at Vassar. Other groups include the Vastards (specializing in the music of the 2000s), Broadway and More (BAM; showtunes), the Accidentals (the Axies; the sole all-men&#x27;s a cappella group at Vassar), Beauty and the Beats (focusing on music from Disney movies), Home Brewed (formerly Matthew&#x27;s Minstrels, the college&#x27;s first mixed-gender a cappella group), the Vassar Devils, Measure 4 Measure (both themeless groups), and AirCappella (an all-whistling ensemble). Some a cappella groups tour and compete, including the Vassar Devils, who competed in the 2015 International Championship of Collegiate A Cappella.
* The Philaletheis Society, which was founded in 1865 as a literary society, is the oldest theater group on campus. It has now become a completely student run theater group. Others include Unbound (experimental theater), Woodshed (a troupe focused on devised theater), and Idlewild (an all-female ensemble). Britomartis, Vassar&#x27;s only theater group exclusively creating devised theater, was founded in 2011. Further groups include the Future Waitstaff of America (for musical theater), Ebony Theatre Ensemble (focusing on Black theater), and two Shakespeare-specific troupes, Shakespeare Troupe and Merely Players. The college also hosts the Powerhouse Summer Theater workshop series.
* Happily Ever Laughter (&quot;HEL&quot;) is the college&#x27;s oldest continually active sketch comedy group, founded in 1993. Another comedy group, Big K!dz (formerly No Offense), which was started by two former members of an earlier group called Laughingstock (for which recognition by the student assembly was withdrawn in March 2000, as a result of a controversial sketch), was started in September 2000. Another sketch comedy group, The Limit, was started a few years later. Indecent Exposure, an all-women&#x27;s troupe performing both sketch and stand-up comedy, was founded in 2004. Comedy Normative, which began in 2009, performs exclusively stand-up comedy. Vassar has a tradition of improv comedy groups, which continue today.
* The Vassar Greens are Vassar&#x27;s environmental group.
* Vassar College Television (VCTV) is the college&#x27;s first student-run video production company.

===Campus publications===
* &quot;The Miscellany News&quot; has been the weekly paper of the college since 1866, making it one of the oldest college weeklies in the United States. It is available for free most Thursdays when school is in session
* &quot;Squirm&quot; &quot;is a submissions-based magazine about sex and sexuality. Squirm seeks to create a sex-positive forum on campus for the artistic, literary, and creative exploration of sex.&quot; The magazine, published annually since 1999, typically runs around 60 pages and is only distributed to the campus community.
* &quot;Boilerplate Magazine&quot; is a student-run publication that calls itself an &quot;alternative news source... that aims to publish radical pieces and creative works which address issues through a socially conscious lens.&quot; Due to its independence from collegiate funds, Boilerplate Magazine is generally more critical of the college than other student-run outlets.
* &quot;Unscrewed&quot; (October 1, 1976 - April 1, 1989) was a student-run consumer report on campus residential and classroom safety, local food and drug price comparison, an annual local pizza delivery survey, and long-term topics such as the college&#x27;s endowment and staffing.

===Radio station===
WVKR-FM, 91.3 FM, is the college&#x27;s radio station, established in 1971.

===Student government===
In March 2016, in a 15–2 vote, the Vassar Student Association (VSA) passed a resolution calling for the support of the Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement and the boycott of Israel. In April 2016, the BDS resolution went to a school-wide referendum, where it was defeated 573–503.

===Athletics===

Vassar teams, known as the Brewers, compete in Division III of the NCAA, as a member of the Liberty League. The nickname originates from the college&#x27;s founder and namesake Matthew Vassar, whose family ran a brewery in Poughkeepsie and would later amass a sizable fortune in the industry.

In 2008, the Vassar men&#x27;s volleyball team made the school&#x27;s first appearance in a national championship game, beating UC Santa Cruz 3–0 in the semifinal before falling to Springfield in the championship game.

In 2007, the Vassar cycling team hosted the Eastern Collegiate Cycling Championship in Poughkeepsie and New Paltz, New York. The competition included a road race over the Shawangunk Mountains in New Paltz as well as a criterium in Poughkeepsie just blocks from the school&#x27;s campus.

In a controversial move, on November 5, 2009, the athletics department leaders decided the men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rowing team would transition over a two-year period from a varsity to a club sport as a cost-saving measure.

In 1940, 1941 and 1942, Vassar athletes won national intercollegiate women&#x27;s tennis championships each year in both singles (Katharine Hubbell) and doubles (Hubbell, Carolyn &quot;Lonny&quot; Myers).

In 2018, the Vassar women&#x27;s rugby team won the school&#x27;s first team national championship, beating Winona State 50–13 in the final of the USA Rugby Women&#x27;s Division 2.

<text>Itzhak Avraham ben Zeev Spiegelman ( ; born February 15, 1948), professionally known as Art Spiegelman, is an American cartoonist, editor, and comics advocate best known for his graphic novel &quot;Maus&quot;. His work as co-editor on the comics magazines &quot;Arcade&quot; and &quot;Raw&quot; has been influential, and from 1992 he spent a decade as contributing artist for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. He is married to designer and editor Françoise Mouly and is the father of writer Nadja Spiegelman. In September 2022, the National Book Foundation announced that he would receive the Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters.

Spiegelman began his career with Topps (a bubblegum and trading card company) in the mid-1960s, which was his main financial support for two decades; there he co-created parodic series such as &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; in the 1960s and &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; in the 1980s. He gained prominence in the underground comix scene in the 1970s with short, experimental, and often autobiographical work. A selection of these strips appeared in the collection &quot;Breakdowns&quot; in 1977, after which Spiegelman turned focus to the book-length &quot;Maus&quot;, about his relationship with his father, a Holocaust survivor. The postmodern book depicts Germans as cats, Jews as mice, ethnic Poles as pigs, and citizens of the United States as dogs. It took 13 years to create until its completion in 1991. In 1992 it won a special Pulitzer Prize and has gained a reputation as a pivotal work.

Spiegelman and Mouly edited eleven issues of &quot;Raw&quot; from 1980 to 1991. The oversized and graphics magazine helped introduce talents who became prominent in alternative comics, such as Charles Burns, Chris Ware, and Ben Katchor, and introduced several foreign cartoonists to the English-speaking comics world. Beginning in the 1990s, the couple worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, which Spiegelman left to work on &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot; (2004), about his reaction to the September 11 attacks in New York in 2001.

Spiegelman advocates for greater comics literacy. As an editor, a teacher, and a lecturer, Spiegelman has promoted better understanding of comics and has mentored younger cartoonists.

==Family history==
Spiegelman&#x27;s parents were Polish Jews (1906–1982) and (1912–1968) Spiegelman. His father was born Zeev Spiegelman, with the Hebrew name Zeev ben Avraham. Władysław was his Polish name, and Władek (or Vladek in anglicized form) was a diminutive of this name. He was also known as Wilhelm under the German occupation, and Anglicized his name to William upon immigration to the United States. His mother was born Andzia Zylberberg, with the Hebrew name Hannah. She changed her name to Anna upon immigrating to the United States. In Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Maus&quot;, from which the couple are best known, Spiegelman used the spellings &quot;Vladek&quot; and &quot;Anja&quot;, which he believed would be easier for Americans to pronounce. The surname &quot;Spiegelman&quot; is German for &quot;mirror man&quot;.

In 1937, the Spiegelmans had one other son, Rysio (spelled &quot;Richieu&quot; in &quot;Maus&quot;), who died before Art was born, at the age of five or six. During the Holocaust, Spiegelman&#x27;s parents sent Rysio to Zawiercie to stay with an aunt, Tosha, with whom they believed he would be safe. In 1943, the aunt poisoned herself, along with Rysio and two other young family members in her care, so that the Nazis could not take them to the extermination camps. After the war, the Spiegelmans, unable to accept that Rysio was dead, searched orphanages all over Europe in the hope of finding him. Spiegelman talked of having a sort of sibling rivalry with his &quot;ghost brother&quot;; he felt unable to compete with an &quot;ideal&quot; brother who &quot;never threw tantrums or got in any kind of trouble&quot;. Of 85 Spiegelman relatives alive at the beginning of World War II, only 13 are known to have survived the Holocaust.

==Life and career==
===Early life===

He began cartooning in 1960 and imitated the style of his favorite comic books, such as &quot;Mad&quot;. In the early 1960s, he contributed to early fanzines such as &quot;Smudge&quot; and Skip Williamson&#x27;s &quot;Squire&quot;, and in 1962—while at Russell Sage Junior High School, where he was an honors student—he produced the &quot;Mad&quot;-inspired fanzine &quot;Blasé&quot;. He was earning money from his drawing by the time he reached high school and sold artwork to the original &quot;Long Island Press&quot; and other outlets. His talent caught the eyes of United Features Syndicate, who offered him the chance to produce a syndicated comic strip. Dedicated to the idea of art as expression, he turned down this commercial opportunity. He attended the High School of Art and Design in Manhattan beginning in 1963. He met Woody Gelman, the art director of Topps Chewing Gum Company, who encouraged Spiegelman to apply to Topps after graduating from high school. At age 15, Spiegelman received payment for his work from a Rego Park newspaper.

After he graduated in 1965, Spiegelman&#x27;s parents urged him to pursue the financial security of a career such as dentistry, but he chose instead to enroll at Harpur College to study art and philosophy. While there, he got a freelance art job at Topps, which provided him with an income for the next two decades.

Spiegelman attended Harpur College from 1965 until 1968, where he worked as staff cartoonist for the college newspaper and edited a college humor magazine. After a summer internship when he was 18, Topps hired him for Gelman&#x27;s Product Development Department as a creative consultant making trading cards and related products in 1966, such as the &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; series of parodic trading cards begun in 1967.

Spiegelman began selling self-published underground comix on street corners in 1966. He had cartoons published in underground publications such as the &quot;East Village Other&quot; and traveled to San Francisco for a few months in 1967, where the underground comix scene was just beginning to burgeon.

In late winter 1968, Spiegelman suffered an intense nervous breakdown, which cut short his university studies. He has said that at the time he was taking LSD with great frequency. He spent a month in Binghamton State Mental Hospital, and shortly after he exited it, his mother died by suicide following the death of her only surviving brother.

===Underground comics (1971–1977)===
In 1971, after several visits, Spiegelman moved to San Francisco and became a part of the countercultural underground comix movement that had been developing there. Some of the he produced during this period include &quot;The Compleat Mr. Infinity&quot; (1970), a ten-page booklet of explicit comic strips, and &quot;The Viper Vicar of Vice, Villainy and Vickedness&quot; (1972), a transgressive work in the vein of fellow underground cartoonist S. Clay Wilson. Spiegelman&#x27;s work also appeared in underground magazines such as &quot;Gothic Blimp Works&quot;, &quot;Bijou Funnies&quot;, &quot;Young Lust&quot;, &quot;Real Pulp&quot;, and &quot;Bizarre Sex&quot;, and were in a variety of styles and genres as Spiegelman sought his artistic voice. He also did a number of cartoons for men&#x27;s magazines such as &quot;Cavalier&quot;, &quot;The Dude&quot;, and &quot;Gent&quot;.

In 1972, Justin Green asked Spiegelman to do a three-page strip for the first issue of &quot;Funny &quot; . He wanted to do one about racism, and at first considered a story with African Americans as mice and cats taking on the role of the Ku Klux Klan. Instead, he turned to the Holocaust that his parents had survived. He titled the strip &quot;Maus&quot; and depicted the Jews as mice persecuted by &quot;die Katzen&quot;, which were Nazis as cats. The narrator related the story to a mouse named &quot;Mickey&quot;. With this story Spiegelman felt he had found his voice.

Seeing Green&#x27;s revealingly autobiographical &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; while in-progress in 1971 inspired Spiegelman to produce &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot;, an expressionistic work that dealt with his mother&#x27;s suicide; it appeared in 1973 in &quot;Short Order Comix&quot; 1, which he edited. Spiegelman&#x27;s work thereafter went through a phase of increasing formal experimentation; the &quot;Apex Treasury of Underground Comics&quot; in 1974 quotes him: &quot;As an art form the comic strip is barely in its infancy. So am I. Maybe we&#x27;ll grow up together.&quot; The often-reprinted &quot;Ace Hole, Midget Detective&quot; of 1974 was a Cubist-style nonlinear parody of hardboiled crime fiction full of non sequiturs. &quot;A Day at the Circuits&quot; of 1975 is a recursive single-page strip about alcoholism and depression in which the reader follows the character through multiple never-ending pathways. &quot;Nervous Rex: The Malpractice Suite&quot; of 1976 is made up of cut-out panels from the soap-opera comic strip &quot;Rex Morgan, M.D.&quot; refashioned in such a way as to defy coherence.

In 1973, Spiegelman edited a pornographic and psychedelic book of quotations and dedicated it to his mother. Co-edited with Bob Schneider, it was called &quot;Whole Grains: A Book of Quotations&quot;. In 1974–1975, he taught a studio cartooning class at the San Francisco Academy of Art.

By the mid-1970s, the underground comix movement was encountering a slowdown. To give cartoonists a safe berth, Spiegelman co-edited the anthology &quot;Arcade&quot; with Bill Griffith, in 1975 and 1976. &quot;Arcade&quot; was printed by The Print Mint and lasted seven issues, five of which had covers by Robert Crumb. It stood out from similar publications by having an editorial plan, in which Spiegelman and Griffith attempt to show how comics connect to the broader realms of artistic and literary culture. Spiegelman&#x27;s own work in &quot;Arcade&quot; tended to be short and concerned with formal experimentation. &quot;Arcade&quot; also introduced art from ages past, as well as contemporary literary pieces by writers such as William S. Burroughs and Charles Bukowski. In 1975, Spiegelman moved back to New York City, which put most of the editorial work for &quot;Arcade&quot; on the shoulders of Griffith and his cartoonist wife, Diane Noomin. This, combined with distribution problems and retailer indifference, led to the magazine&#x27;s 1976 demise. Spiegelman swore he would never edit another magazine.

Françoise Mouly, an architectural student on a hiatus from her studies at the Beaux-Arts in Paris, arrived in New York in 1974. While looking for comics from which to practice reading English, she came across &quot;Arcade&quot;. Avant-garde filmmaker friend Ken Jacobs introduced Mouly and Spiegelman, when Spiegelman was visiting, but they did not immediately develop a mutual interest. Spiegelman moved back to New York later in the year. Occasionally the two ran across each other. After she read &quot;Prisoner on the Hell Planet&quot; Mouly felt the urge to contact him. An eight-hour phone call led to a deepening of their relationship. Spiegelman followed her to France when she had to return to fulfill obligations in her architecture course.

Spiegelman introduced Mouly to the world of comics and helped her find work as a colorist for Marvel Comics. After returning to the U.S. in 1977, Mouly ran into visa problems, which the couple solved by getting married. The couple began to make yearly trips to Europe to explore the comics scene, and brought back European comics to show to their circle of friends. Mouly assisted in putting together the lavish, oversized collection of Spiegelman&#x27;s experimental strips &quot;Breakdowns&quot; in 1977.

===&quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;Maus&quot; (1978–1991)===
&quot;Breakdowns&quot; suffered poor distribution and sales, and 30% of the print run was unusable due to printing errors, an experience that motivated Mouly to gain control over the printing process. She took courses in offset printing and bought a printing press for her loft, on which she was to print parts of a new magazine she insisted on launching with Spiegelman. With Mouly as publisher, Spiegelman and Mouly co-edited &quot;Raw&quot; starting in July 1980. The first issue was subtitled &quot;The Graphix Magazine of Postponed Suicides&quot;. While it included work from such established underground cartoonists as Crumb and Griffith, &quot;Raw&quot; focused on publishing artists who were virtually unknown, avant-garde cartoonists such as Charles Burns, Lynda Barry, Chris Ware, Ben Katchor, and Gary Panter, and introduced English-speaking audiences to translations of foreign works by José Muñoz, Chéri Samba, Joost Swarte, Yoshiharu Tsuge, Jacques Tardi, and others.

With the intention of creating a book-length work based on his father&#x27;s recollections of the Holocaust Spiegelman began to interview his father again in 1978 and made a research visit in 1979 to the Auschwitz concentration camp, where his parents had been imprisoned by the Nazis. The book, &quot;Maus&quot;, appeared one chapter at a time as an insert in &quot;Raw&quot; beginning with the second issue in December 1980. Spiegelman&#x27;s father did not live to see its completion; he died on 18 August 1982. Spiegelman learned in 1985 that Steven Spielberg was producing an animated film about Jewish mice who escape persecution in Eastern Europe by fleeing to the United States. Spiegelman was sure the film, &quot;An American Tail&quot; (1986), was inspired by &quot;Maus&quot; and became eager to have his unfinished book come out before the movie to avoid comparisons. He struggled to find a publisher until in 1986, after the publication in &quot;The New York Times&quot; of a rave review of the work-in-progress, Pantheon agreed to release a collection of the first six chapters. The volume was titled &quot;Maus: A Survivor&#x27;s Tale&quot; and subtitled &quot;My Father Bleeds History&quot;. The book found a large audience, in part because it was sold in bookstores rather than in direct-market comic shops, which by the 1980s had become the dominant outlet for comic books.

Spiegelman began teaching at the School of Visual Arts in New York in 1978, and continued until 1987, teaching alongside his heroes Harvey Kurtzman and Will Eisner. &quot;: An Idiosyncratic Historical and Aesthetic Overview&quot;, a Spiegelman essay, was published in &quot;Print&quot;. Another Spiegelman essay, &quot;High Art Lowdown&quot;, was published in &quot;Artforum&quot; in 1990, critiquing the &quot;High/Low&quot; exhibition at the Museum of Modern Art.

In the wake of the success of the Cabbage Patch Kids series of dolls, Spiegelman created the parodic trading card series &quot;Garbage Pail Kids&quot; for Topps in 1985. Similar to the &quot;Wacky Packages&quot; series, the gross-out factor of the cards was controversial with parent groups, and its popularity started a gross-out fad among children. Spiegelman called Topps his &quot;Medici&quot; for the autonomy and financial freedom working for the company had given him. The relationship was nevertheless strained over issues of credit and ownership of the original artwork. In 1989 Topps auctioned off pieces of art Spiegelman had created rather than returning them to him, and Spiegelman broke the relation. In 1990, he received a Guggenheim Fellowship for Fine Arts. 

In 1991, &quot;Raw&quot; 2, 3 was published; it was to be the last issue. The closing chapter of &quot;Maus&quot; appeared not in &quot;Raw&quot; but in the second volume of the graphic novel, which appeared later that year with the subtitle &quot;And Here My Troubles Began&quot;. &quot;Maus&quot; attracted an unprecedented amount of critical attention for a work of comics, including an exhibition at New York&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art and a special Pulitzer Prize in 1992.

=== &quot;The New Yorker&quot; and public legitimacy (1992–2001) ===
Hired by Tina Brown as a contributing artist in 1992, Spiegelman worked for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; for ten years. His first cover appeared on the February 15, 1993, Valentine&#x27;s Day issue and showed a black West Indian woman and a Hasidic man kissing. The cover caused turmoil at &quot;The New Yorker&quot; offices. Spiegelman intended it to reference the Crown Heights riot of 1991 in which racial tensions led to the murder of a Jewish yeshiva student. Twenty-one &quot;New Yorker&quot; covers by Spiegelman were published, and he also submitted some which were rejected for being too outrageous.

Within &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s pages, Spiegelman contributed strips such as a collaboration, &quot;In the Dumps&quot;, with children&#x27;s illustrator Maurice Sendak and an obituary to Charles M. Schulz, &quot;Abstract Thought is a Warm Puppy&quot;. Another of Spiegelman&#x27;s essays, &quot;Forms Stretched to their Limits&quot;, in an issue was about Jack Cole, the creator of Plastic Man. It formed the basis for a book about Cole, &quot;Jack Cole and Plastic Man: Forms Stretched to Their Limits&quot; (2001).

The same year, Voyager Company published &quot;The Complete Maus&quot;, a CD-ROM version of &quot;Maus&quot; with extensive supplementary material, and Spiegelman illustrated a 1923 poem by Joseph Moncure March called &quot;The Wild Party&quot;. Spiegelman contributed the essay &quot;Getting in Touch With My Inner Racist&quot; in the September 1, 1997, issue of &quot;Mother Jones&quot;.

Spiegelman was comics editor of the &quot;New York Press&quot; in the early 1990s. He was comics editor of &quot;Details&quot; magazine in the late 1990s; in 1997 he began assigning comics journalism pieces in &quot;Details&quot; to a number of his cartoonist associates, including Joe Sacco, Peter Kuper, Ben Katchor, Peter Bagge, Charles Burns, Kaz, Kim Deitch, and Jay Lynch. The magazine published these works of journalism in comics form throughout 1998 and 1999, helping to legitimize the form in popular perception.
Spiegelman&#x27;s influence and connections in New York cartooning circles drew the ire of political cartoonist Ted Rall in 1999. In &quot;The King of Comix&quot;, an article in &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Rall accused Spiegelman of the power to &quot;make or break&quot; a cartoonist&#x27;s career in New York, while denigrating Spiegelman as &quot;a guy with one great book in him&quot;. Cartoonist Danny Hellman responded by sending a forged email under Rall&#x27;s name to 30 professionals; the prank escalated until Rall launched a defamation suit against Hellman for $1.5 million. Hellman published a &quot;Legal Action Comics&quot; benefit book to cover his legal costs, to which Spiegelman contributed a back-cover cartoon in which he relieves himself on a Rall-shaped urinal.

In 1997, Spiegelman had his first children&#x27;s book published, &quot;Open Me...I&#x27;m a Dog&quot;, with a narrator who tries to convince its readers that it is a dog via pop-ups and an attached leash. From 2000 to 2003, Spiegelman and Mouly edited three issues of the children&#x27;s comics anthology &quot;Little Lit&quot;, with contributions from &quot;Raw&quot; alumni and children&#x27;s book authors and illustrators.

===Post–September 11 (2001–present)===
Spiegelman lived close to the World Trade Center site, which was known as &quot;Ground Zero&quot; after the September 11 attacks that destroyed the World Trade Center. Immediately following the attacks Spiegelman and Mouly rushed to their daughter Nadja&#x27;s school, where Spiegelman&#x27;s anxiety served only to increase his daughter&#x27;s apprehensiveness over the situation. Spiegelman and Mouly created a cover for the September 24 issue of &quot;The New Yorker&quot; which at first glance appears to be totally black, but upon close examination it reveals the silhouettes of the World Trade Center towers in a slightly darker shade of black. Mouly positioned the silhouettes so that the North Tower&#x27;s antenna breaks into the &quot;w&quot; of &quot;The New Yorker&quot;″s logo. The towers were printed in black on a slightly darker black field employing standard four-color printing inks with an overprinted clear varnish. In some situations, the ghost images only became visible when the magazine was tilted toward a light source. Spiegelman was critical of the Bush administration and the mass media over their handling of the September 11 attacks.

Spiegelman did not renew his &quot;New Yorker&quot; contract after 2003. He later quipped that he regretted leaving when he did, as he could have left in protest when the magazine ran a pro-invasion of Iraq piece later in the year. Spiegelman said his parting from &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was part of his general disappointment with &quot;the widespread conformism of the mass media in the Bush era&quot;. He said he felt like he was in &quot;internal exile&quot; following the September 11 attacks as the U.S. media had become &quot;conservative and timid&quot; and did not welcome the provocative art that he felt the need to create. Nevertheless, Spiegelman asserted he left not over political differences, as had been widely reported, but because &quot;The New Yorker&quot; was not interested in doing serialized work, which he wanted to do with his next project.

Spiegelman responded to the September 11 attacks with &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot;, commissioned by German newspaper , where it appeared throughout 2003. &quot;The Jewish Daily Forward&quot; was the only American periodical to serialize the feature. &quot;In the Shadow of No Towers&quot; is an autobiographical reflection on the tragic events and a partial political satire on the War on Terror. The collected work appeared in September 2004 as an oversized board book of two-page spreads which had to be turned on end to read.

In the June 2006 edition of &quot;Harper&#x27;s Magazine&quot; Spiegelman had an article published on the Jyllands-Posten Muhammad cartoons controversy; some interpretations of Islamic law prohibit the depiction of Muhammad. The Canadian chain of booksellers Indigo refused to sell the issue. Called &quot;Drawing Blood: Outrageous Cartoons and the Art of Outrage&quot;, the article surveyed the sometimes dire effect political cartooning has for its creators, ranging from Honoré Daumier, who spent time in prison for his satirical work; to George Grosz, who faced exile. To Indigo the article seemed to promote the continuance of racial caricature. An internal memo advised Indigo staff to tell people: &quot;the decision was made based on the fact that the content about to be published has been known to ignite demonstrations around the world.&quot; In response to the cartoons, Iranian president Mahmoud Ahmadinejad promoted an Iranian cartoon contest seeking anti-Semitic cartoons. The organizers of the contest intended to highlight what they perceived as Western double standards surrounding anti-Semitism and Islamophobia. Spiegelman produced a cartoon of a line of prisoners being led to the gas chambers; one stops to look at the corpses around him and says, &quot;Ha! Ha! Ha! What&#x27;s really hilarious is that none of this is actually happening!&quot;

To promote literacy in young children, Mouly encouraged publishers to publish comics for children. Disappointed by publishers&#x27; lack of response, from 2008 she self-published a line of easy readers called Toon Books, by artists such as Spiegelman, Renée French, and Rutu Modan, and promotes the books to teachers and librarians for their educational value. Spiegelman&#x27;s &quot;Jack and the Box&quot; was one of the inaugural books in 2008.

In 2008 Spiegelman reissued &quot;Breakdowns&quot; in an expanded edition including &quot;Portrait of the Artist as a Young %@&amp;*!&quot; an autobiographical strip that had been serialized in the &quot;Virginia Quarterly Review&quot; from 2005. A volume drawn from Spiegelman&#x27;s sketchbooks, &quot;Be A Nose&quot;, appeared in 2009. In 2011, &quot;MetaMaus&quot; followed—a book-length analysis of &quot;Maus&quot; by Spiegelman and Hillary Chute with a DVD update of the earlier CD-ROM.

Library of America commissioned Spiegelman to edit the two-volume &quot;Lynd Ward: Six Novels in Woodcuts&quot;, which appeared in 2010, collecting all of Ward&#x27;s wordless novels with an introduction and annotations by Spiegelman. The project led to a touring show in 2014 about wordless novels called &quot;Wordless!&quot; with live music by saxophonist Phillip Johnston. &quot;Art Spiegelman&#x27;s Co-Mix: A Retrospective&quot; débuted at Angoulême in 2012 and by the end of 2014 had traveled to Paris, Cologne, Vancouver, New York, and Toronto. The book &quot;Co-Mix: A Retrospective of Comics, Graphics, and Scraps&quot;, which complemented the show, appeared in 2013.

In 2015, after six writers refused to sit on a panel at the PEN American Center in protest of the planned &quot;freedom of expression courage award&quot; for the satirical French periodical &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; following the shooting at its headquarters earlier in the year, Spiegelman agreed to be one of the replacement hosts, along with other names in comics such as writer Neil Gaiman. Spiegelman retracted a cover he had submitted to a Gaiman-edited &quot;saying the unsayable&quot; issue of &quot;New Statesman&quot; when the management declined to print a strip of Spiegelman&#x27;s. The strip, &quot;Notes from a First Amendment Fundamentalist&quot;, depicts Muhammad, and Spiegelman believed the rejection was censorship, though the magazine asserted it never intended to run the cartoon.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, Spiegelman worked on illustrating &quot;Street Cop&quot;, a dystopian short novel written by Robert Coover. Published in 2021, it tells the story of a crooked cop trying to solve a murder. 

A biographical documentary called &quot;Art Spiegelman: Disaster Is My Muse&quot; premiered at DOC NYC in November 2024 and was released in theaters in 2025. The documentary covers the role that tragedy has played in inspiring Spiegelman&#x27;s work, including the Holocaust, his mother&#x27;s suicide, and the September 11 attacks. At a Q&amp;A session after the screening, Spiegelman announced that he is working on a graphic novel about Gaza with Joe Sacco. He later clarified that the project wouldn&#x27;t be a full graphic novel but a three-page comic based on phone conversations the two had had. The collaborative comic called &quot;Never Again and Again&quot; was released in February 2025 in &quot;The New York Review&quot;.

==Personal life==
Spiegelman married Françoise Mouly on July 12, 1977, in a New York city hall ceremony. They remarried later in the year after Mouly converted to Judaism to please Spiegelman&#x27;s father. Mouly and Spiegelman have two children together: a daughter, Nadja Rachel, born in 1987, and a son, Dashiell Alan, born in 1992.

==Style==
Spiegelman suffers from a lazy eye, and thus lacks depth perception. He says his art style is &quot;really a result of [his] deficiencies&quot;. His is a style of labored simplicity, with dense visual motifs which often go unnoticed upon first viewing. He sees comics as &quot;very condensed thought structures&quot;, more akin to poetry than prose, which need careful, time-consuming planning that their seeming simplicity belies. Spiegelman&#x27;s work prominently displays his concern with form, and pushing the boundaries of what is and is not comics. Early in the underground comix era, Spiegelman proclaimed to Robert Crumb, &quot;Time is an illusion that can be shattered in comics! Showing the same scene from different angles freezes it in time by turning the page into a diagram—an orthographic projection!&quot; His comics experiment with time, space, recursion, and representation. He uses the word &quot;decode&quot; to express the action of reading comics and sees comics as functioning best when expressed as diagrams, icons, or symbols.

Spiegelman has stated he does not see himself primarily as a visual artist, one who instinctively sketches or doodles. He has said he approaches his work as a writer as he lacks confidence in his graphic skills. He subjects his dialogue and visuals to constant revision—he reworked some dialogue balloons in &quot;Maus&quot; up to forty times. A critic in &quot;The New Republic&quot; compared Spiegelman&#x27;s dialogue writing to a young Philip Roth in his ability &quot;to make the Jewish speech of several generations sound fresh and convincing&quot;.

Spiegelman makes use of both old- and new-fashioned tools in his work. He prefers at times to work on paper on a drafting table, while at others he draws directly onto his computer using a digital pen and electronic drawing tablet, or mixes methods, employing scanners and printers.

===Influences===
Harvey Kurtzman has been Spiegelman&#x27;s strongest influence as a cartoonist, editor, and promoter of new talent. Chief among his other early cartooning influences include Will Eisner, John Stanley&#x27;s version of &quot;Little Lulu&quot;, Winsor McCay&#x27;s &quot;Little Nemo&quot;, George Herriman&#x27;s &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, and Bernard Krigstein&#x27;s short strip &quot;&quot;.

In the 1960s Spiegelman read in comics fanzines about graphic artists such as Frans Masereel, who had made wordless novels in woodcut. The discussions in those fanzines about making the Great American Novel in comics later acted as inspiration for him. Justin Green&#x27;s comic book &quot;Binky Brown Meets the Holy Virgin Mary&quot; (1972) motivated Spiegelman to open up and include autobiographical elements in his comics.

Spiegelman acknowledges Franz Kafka as an early influence, whom he says he has read since the age of 12, and lists Vladimir Nabokov, William Faulkner, and Gertrude Stein among the writers whose work &quot;stayed with&quot; him. He cites non-narrative avant-garde filmmakers from whom he has drawn heavily, including Ken Jacobs, Stan Brakhage, and Ernie Gehr, and other filmmakers such as Charlie Chaplin and the makers of &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;.

==Beliefs==
Spiegelman is a prominent advocate for the comics medium and comics literacy. He believes the medium echoes the way the human brain processes information. He has toured the U.S. with a lecture called &quot;Comix 101&quot;, examining its history and cultural importance. He sees comics&#x27; low status in the late 20th century as having come down from where it was in the 1930s and 1940s, when comics &quot;tended to appeal to an older audience of GIs and other adults&quot;. Following the advent of the censorious Comics Code Authority in the mid-1950s, Spiegelman sees comics&#x27; potential as having stagnated until the rise of underground comix in the late 1960s. He taught courses in the history and aesthetics of comics at schools such as the School of Visual Arts in New York. As co-editor of &quot;Raw&quot;, he helped propel the careers of younger cartoonists whom he mentored, such as Chris Ware, and published the work of his School of Visual Arts students, such as Kaz, Drew Friedman, and Mark Newgarden. Some of the work published in &quot;Raw&quot; was originally turned in as class assignments.

Spiegelman has described himself politically as &quot;firmly on the left side of the secular-fundamentalist divide&quot; and a &quot;1st Amendment absolutist&quot;. As a supporter of free speech, Spiegelman is opposed to hate speech laws. He wrote a critique in &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot; on the controversial Muhammad cartoons in the &quot;Jyllands-Posten&quot; in 2006; the issue was banned from Indigo–Chapters stores in Canada. Spiegelman criticized American media for refusing to reprint the cartoons they reported on at the time of the &quot;Charlie Hebdo&quot; shooting in 2015.

Spiegelman is a non-practicing Jew and considers himself &quot;a-Zionist&quot;—neither pro- nor anti-Zionist; he has called Israel &quot;a sad, failed idea&quot;. He told &quot;Peanuts&quot; creator Charles Schulz he was not religious, but identified with the &quot;alienated diaspora culture of Kafka and Freud ... what Stalin pejoratively called rootless cosmopolitanism&quot;.

==Legacy==
&quot;Maus&quot; looms large not only over Spiegelman&#x27;s body of work, but over the comics medium itself. While Spiegelman was far from the first to do autobiography in comics, critics such as James Campbell considered &quot;Maus&quot; the work that popularized it. The bestseller has been widely written about in the popular press and academia—the quantity of its critical literature far outstrips that of any other work of comics. It has been examined from a great variety of academic viewpoints, though most often by those with little understanding of &quot;Maus&quot; context in the history of comics. While &quot;Maus&quot; has been credited with lifting comics from popular culture into the world of high art in the public imagination, criticism has tended to ignore its deep roots in popular culture, roots that Spiegelman has intimate familiarity with and has devoted considerable time to promote.

Spiegelman&#x27;s belief that comics are best expressed in a diagrammatic or iconic manner has had a particular influence on formalists such as Chris Ware and his former student Scott McCloud. In 2005, the September 11-themed &quot;New Yorker&quot; cover placed sixth on the top ten of magazine covers of the previous 40 years by the American Society of Magazine Editors. Spiegelman has inspired numerous cartoonists to take up the graphic novel as a means of expression, including Marjane Satrapi.

A joint ZDF–BBC documentary, &quot;Art Spiegelman&#x27;s Maus&quot;, was televised in 1987. Spiegelman, Mouly, and many of the &quot;Raw&quot; artists appeared in the documentary &quot;Comic Book Confidential&quot; in 1988. Spiegelman&#x27;s comics career was also covered in an Emmy-nominated PBS documentary, &quot;Serious Comics: Art Spiegelman&quot;, produced by Patricia Zur for WNYC-TV in 1994. Spiegelman played himself in the 2007 episode &quot;Husbands and Knives&quot; of the animated television series &quot;The Simpsons&quot; with fellow comics creators Daniel Clowes and Alan Moore. A European documentary, &quot;Art Spiegelman, Traits de Mémoire&quot;, appeared in 2010 and later in English under the title &quot;The Art of Spiegelman&quot;, directed by Clara Kuperberg and Joelle Oosterlinck and mainly featuring interviews with Spiegelman and those around him.

<text>The Aotearoa New Zealand Sex Workers&#x27; Collective (NZPC), formerly the New Zealand Prostitutes&#x27; Collective, is a New Zealand-based organisation that supports sex workers&#x27; rights and educates sex workers about minimising the risks of the job.

== Background ==
The New Zealand Prostitutes&#x27; Collective was founded in 1987 by Catherine Healy and others. Funding was received from a contract in 1988 for HIV/AIDS prevention from the Department of Health. Offices were established in Auckland, Wellington, and Dunedin, and a phone support service operated for Christchurch. These were all mostly run by approximately 40 volunteers, as the Collective had only 1.5 staff members. Advocacy was a big part of the work of the Collective, and they promoted legislative reform of the Crimes Bill which contained a legal double standard, which censured the prostitute, while condoning the client. The first submission they made to this bill was in 1989. They continued to play an active role in the New Zealand Labour Party-led Helen Clark administration passing the Prostitution Reform Act 2003, which decriminalised most forms of adult prostitution in New Zealand. The Prostitution Law Review Committee published in their final report in 2008 that there was no increase in prostitution, and that sex workers were safer.

During the early 1990s, the New Zealand Prostitutes&#x27; Collective faced significant opposition due to the stigma of sex work and attention around the legislative reform. An example described by Jan Jordan is: &quot;Even the supposedly simple task of having their phone number listed in the telephone directory had been a battle, with Telecom objecting to having the word &#x27;prostitutes&#x27; printed in their phone book.&quot;

In 1994, a television documentary directed by Clare O&#x27;Leary entitled &quot;A Double Standard,&quot; was produced to demonstrate the then current problems that the criminalization of sex workers under The Massage Parlour Act 1978 could and were causing before the Prostitution Reform Act 2003 was passed and enacted on 25 June, 2003. Any person committing an offence under the Massage Parlour Act 1978, upon conviction could be issued with a fine not exceeding NZ$200.

== Current ==

By 2018, the Collective employed more people, as well as using volunteers. Part of the success of NZPC is that it is staffed by sex workers; there are only two staff members who are not sex workers – a lawyer, and an accountant. There is a board of trustees, and they are all current or former sex workers. In 2018, NZPC founder Catherine Healy received a Dame Companion of the New Zealand Order of Merit, for services to the rights of sex workers, which is a turn-around in the acknowledgement and acceptance of sex work and the part that NZPC played in that.

NZPC receives funding from the Ministry of Health for sexual and reproductive health services. There are branches in Auckland, Tauranga, Manawatu, Hawkes Bay, Wellington, Christchurch, and Dunedin, and a helpline for other regions. A current advocacy focus is the discrimination faced by migrant sex workers in New Zealand because under the Prostitution Reform Act of 2003, migrant sex work is illegal. Ongoing outreach programs are run to support sex workers to be safe. In 2020, during New Zealand&#x27;s strict level 4 lockdown, as a response to the global COVID-19 pandemic, the collective&#x27;s Auckland manager Annah Pickering said: &quot;Covid-19 hit sex workers particularly hard because of the nature of the job, and also because a big bulk of their clientele comes from overseas — many who book months in advance.&quot;

<text>Cambridge () is a town in the Waipā District of the Waikato region of the North Island of New Zealand. Situated southeast of Hamilton, on the banks of the Waikato River, Cambridge is known as &quot;The Town of Trees &amp; Champions&quot;. The town has a population of , making it the largest town in the Waipā District, and the third largest urban area in the Waikato (after Hamilton and Taupō).

Cambridge was a finalist in the 2017 and 2019 New Zealand&#x27;s Most Beautiful Large Town awards, run by Keep New Zealand Beautiful. It was awarded the title New Zealand&#x27;s Most Beautiful Large Town in October 2019.

==History==
Prior to the arrival of Europeans there were a number of Maori pā in the vicinity of what would become Cambridge. In the 1850s missionaries and farmers from Britain settled in the area and introduced modern farming practices to local Maori, helping them set up two flour mills and importing grinding wheels from England and France. During the 1850s, wheat was a profitable crop but when merchants in Auckland began purchasing cheaper grain from Australia the market went into decline.

The European town of Cambridge was established when the 3rd Regiment of the Waikato Militia were settled there in 1864 following the Invasion of the Waikato. The town was named after Prince George, Duke of Cambridge, the Commander-in-Chief of the British Army at the time.

Electric street lights were first switched on in 1922.

==Demographics==
Cambridge covers and had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.

Before the 2023 census, the town had a smaller boundary, covering . Using that boundary, Cambridge had a population of 18,654 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 2,553 people (15.9%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 4,755 people (34.2%) since the 2006 census. There were 7,080 households, comprising 8,925 males and 9,726 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.92 males per female, with 3,690 people (19.8%) aged under 15 years, 3,147 (16.9%) aged 15 to 29, 7,908 (42.4%) aged 30 to 64, and 3,918 (21.0%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 90.1% European/Pākehā, 10.5% Māori, 1.5% Pacific peoples, 5.3% Asian, and 1.8% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 24.1, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 50.4% had no religion, 38.7% were Christian, 0.5% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.7% were Hindu, 0.2% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 2.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 3,279 (21.9%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 2,682 (17.9%) people had no formal qualifications. 3,045 people (20.3%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 7,413 (49.5%) people were employed full-time, 2,133 (14.3%) were part-time, and 408 (2.7%) were unemployed.

== Governance ==

Cambridge is administered by the Waipā District Council. It is the largest town in the district, but not the seat of the council, which is at Te Awamutu.

Nationally, Cambridge is part of the general electorate and the Māori electorate.

==Economy==
Cambridge&#x27;s main sources of employment and income come from dairy farming, tourism, the equine industry and sport. Dairy farming provides more than one in 10 jobs in the Waipā District. The tourism industry supports 12.7% of jobs in Waipā District. The equine industry provides more than 600 jobs in the Waikato, with many based in and around Cambridge. It is estimated that one in five Cambridge residents work in nearby Hamilton.

== Transport ==
Cambridge lies adjacent to State Highway 1, which connects the town with Hamilton in the northwest and Tauranga, Rotorua and Taupō in the southeast. Access to Cambridge from the north is via the Cambridge Road and Victoria Road interchanges, and from the south is via the Tirau Road interchange. Prior to the Waikato Expressway extension opening in December 2015, SH 1 ran through the centre of Cambridge, though in 1985 it had been diverted from the main shopping street, to run via Carters Flat.

State Highway 1B leaves SH 1 at the Victoria Road interchange and provides a route north to SH 1 at Taupiri, providing a route north towards Auckland while bypassing Hamilton to the east.

Hamilton Airport, 18 minutes drive from Cambridge, is the nearest airport and provides daily flights to all New Zealand&#x27;s main centres.

A public bus service connects Cambridge with central Hamilton via Tamahere and Waikato University several times daily.

Cambridge was formerly the terminus of the Cambridge Branch railway, but this closed beyond Hautapu in 1999.

Until the railway was built the Waikato River was the main form of transport, Cambridge being the limit of navigation. Steamers continued to serve Cambridge until the 1930s. The wharf was near the Karapiro Stream, where the river was wide enough for steamers to turn.

<text>Prostitution in New Zealand, brothel-keeping, living off the proceeds of someone else&#x27;s prostitution, and street solicitation are legal in New Zealand and have been since the Prostitution Reform Act 2003 came into effect. Coercion of sex workers is illegal. The 2003 decriminalisation of brothels, escort agencies and soliciting, and the substitution of a minimal regulatory model, created worldwide interest; New Zealand prostitution laws are now some of the most liberal in the world.

Until 2003, indoor prostitution in New Zealand was governed by the Massage Parlours Act 1978, which allowed brothels to operate in the guise of massage parlours. However, the act defined massage parlours as public places, so laws against soliciting in a public place applied to workers in parlours, and they were sometimes raided by police posing as clients. Workers in the parlours were also required to provide their names and addresses to the police. Advertising the sale of sex (&quot;soliciting&quot;), running a brothel, and living off the earnings of prostitution were illegal.

Despite the Massage Parlours Act and other laws meant to suppress prostitution, there was considerable toleration of sex work in practice in the last decades of the 20th century. These laws were all changed by the Prostitution Reform Act in June 2003.

==History==
===Before 2003===
The early examples of the exchange of sex for material gain in New Zealand occurred in the early period of contact between indigenous Māori and European and American sailors. Along with food, water, and timber, sex was one of the major commodities exchanged for European goods. The Bay of Islands and in particular the town of Kororareka was notorious for this and brothels proliferated. It is not clear whether all of these exchanges necessarily constituted prostitution in the usual sense of the word. In some cases, the sex may have been part of a wider partnership between a tribe and a ship&#x27;s crew, akin to a temporary marriage alliance. The amount of choice women had about their participation seems to have varied. Throughout this period there was a severe gender imbalance in the settler population and women were in short supply.

In the nineteenth century, prostitution was generally referred to as the &quot;Social Evil&quot;. As with other British dependencies, New Zealand inherited both statute and case law from the United Kingdom, for instance the 1824 UK Vagrancy Act was in force until New Zealand passed its own Vagrancy Act (1866–1884).
These included reference to the common prostitute. New Zealand was also amongst those dependencies that British authorities pressured into passing Contagious Diseases Acts; New Zealand&#x27;s was in force from 1869–1910. The Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union New Zealand continuously found for repeal of the Contagious Diseases Acts and ramped up its petitions and public letters with data from convictions in courts to prove how the law protected male predators and kept girls and women of all classes vulnerable to assault. These were oppressive Acts, based on the belief, expressed officially even in the 1922 report, that women represented vectors for the spread of venereal diseases. It was replaced by the Social Hygiene Act 1917, although these fears reappeared throughout the British Empire in both World Wars.
In the post-war period, the concern was more with &quot;promiscuity&quot;, although prostitution was seen as an extreme form of this. The gendered rationale and practice of venereal disease policy formed a focus for early feminist activism.

Prostitution-related statute law passed in the second half of the 20th century included the Crimes Act 1961, the Massage Parlours Act 1978, and the Summary Offences Act 1981. Section 26 of the Summary Offences Act prohibited soliciting, S 147 of the Crimes Act prohibited brothel-keeping, and S 148 living on the earnings of prostitution, and S 149 procuring. In 2000, the Crimes Act was amended to criminalise both clients and operators where workers were aged under 18 (the age of consent for sexual activity is 16). Young people under 18 were still classed as offenders after this came into force, until the passage of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003.

The Massage Parlours Act effectively allowed indoor commercial sex under a facade. Prostitutes advertised their services as &quot;escorts&quot;, and brothels advertised themselves as &quot;massage parlours&quot;. Workers in &quot;massage parlours&quot; were required to be registered with the police from the time the Massage Parlours Act 1978 came into force. In the mid-1990s, the police extended this registration ex-officio to other indoor workers in some areas of the country. The police had approached media outlets letting them know that they may be &quot;aiding and abetting&quot; sex workers committing crimes (such as brothel-keeping, etc.), and told the media that they should require such registration before accepting advertisements.

===Prostitution Reform Act 2003===
In 1997, a number of groups came together to hold a Women&#x27;s Forum in Wellington, out of which a working group developed to draft a bill, including the NZPC, academics, women&#x27;s groups (New Zealand Federation of Business and Professional Women, National Council of Women of New Zealand, YWCA), and the AIDS Foundation. Other individuals included legal volunteers and MPs, in particular Maurice Williamson (National, Pakuranga 1987–2017), Associate Minister of Health (1990–1996), and Katherine O&#x27;Regan (National, Waipa 1984–1996, List 1996–1999), who championed the bill in parliament.

Labour returned to power (1999–2008), and Tim Barnett (Labour Christchurch Central 1996–2008) assumed responsibility for introducing it as a Private Member&#x27;s Bill to decriminalise prostitution. This was based on the harm reduction model of New South Wales (1996). The bill was introduced on 21 September 2000, and placed in the ballot box, being drawn as number 3 and debated on 8 November as Bill 66-1 (87:21), passing first reading 87:21. Party support came from the Greens, notably Sue Bradford (List, 1999–2009). It was opposed by New Zealand First, who proposed the Swedish approach of criminalising the purchase of sex. It then proceeded to select committee (Justice and Electoral),
which received 222 submissions and heard 66 submissions, amending and reporting in favour of the Bill on 29 November 2002, following the 2002 election, the bill now being referred to as Bill 66-2. Dissenting minority opinions were recorded by the National, New Zealand First, ACT New Zealand, and United Future members. This was a Private Member&#x27;s Bill, and theoretically, members were allowed a conscience vote. However, the three members of the 1999–2002 coalition (Labour, Greens, Alliance) all had decriminalisation in their manifestos. Later, the Prime Minister, Helen Clark, lent her support to the bill.

During the parliamentary debates and committees, support came from some women&#x27;s rights groups, some human rights groups, and some public health groups. The police were neutral. Some feminists opposed the decriminalisation of brothels and pimping (see feminist views on prostitution), Christian groups were divided, and fundamentalist religious groups, including Right to Life, were opposed.

The Prostitution Reform Act (PRA) passed its third reading on 25 June 2003. This bill passed narrowly; of 120 member of parliaments, 60 voted for it, 59 against, and one politician, Labour&#x27;s Ashraf Choudhary, the country&#x27;s only Muslim MP, abstained. The result was a surprise, as most commentators had expected the bill to fail. An impassioned speech to parliament by Georgina Beyer, a transgender woman and former sex worker, was believed by many observers to have persuaded several wavering MPs, possibly including Mr Choudhary, to change their votes at the last minute.

The Act replaced the previous legislation, including repealing the Massage Parlours Act, largely removing voluntary adult (age 18 and over) prostitution from the criminal law and replacing it with civil law at both national and local level. A distinction was made between voluntary and involuntary prostitution. It remains a crime to coerce someone to provide sexual services. Sex work is also prohibited for those on temporary visas, and immigration for and investment in sex work is prohibited. Contracts between provider and client were recognised, and providers have the right to refuse services. Contested contracts can be referred to the Disputes Tribunal. Advertising is banned, with the exception of print media, which is restricted. The Summary Offences Act remains in force in relation to soliciting, which may be classed as offensive behaviour. The Criminal Records (Clean Slate) Act 2004 also allows sex workers to apply for previous convictions to be removed from the record. Sex work is recognised (but not promoted) as legitimate work by Work and Income New Zealand, who may not advertise vacancies in brothels or suggest people start sex work as a means of getting off a benefit. Now, workplace safety and health rules, developed in consultation with the prostitutes&#x27; collective, apply to sex work. Employment disputes can be referred to the Labour Inspectorate and Mediation Service. There is an obligation on employers and employees to practise and promote safe sexual practices. The Ministry of Health has the responsibility for enforcement. Registration of indoor sex workers with the police was replaced by certification at an administrative law level of brothel operators. Prior records have been destroyed. Refusal of a certificate is permitted for prior criminal offences (not necessarily related to prostitution). Police activities changed from the registration and prosecution of sex workers to protection. The Police Manual of Best Practice was amended to include prostitution.

Local government was empowered to develop by-laws for zoning and advertising, but not prohibit sex work.

In summary, the Act decriminalised soliciting, living off the proceeds of someone else&#x27;s prostitution, and brothel-keeping.

Following passage of the Act, the Maxim Institute and other conservative Christian organisations tried to gain an appropriate number of signatures for a citizens-initiated referendum under the Citizens Initiated Referendum Act 1993.
The initiative was sponsored by two United Future MPs, Gordon Copeland, the bill&#x27;s most outspoken critic, and Larry Baldock.
Although it was allowed an extension, anti-prostitution groups fell well short of gaining the number of authenticated signatures required for a citizen-initiated referendum.

Local Government New Zealand provided model by-laws and procedures. Court challenges have usually failed to uphold more restrictive council by-laws. By 2006, 17 of 74 local governments had drafted or implemented by-laws.

====2008 evaluation====
To help counter criticism, the Prostitution Reform Act included a requirement that a review of the effects of the new law had to be conducted three to five years after it came into force. An initial report in September 2006 indicated that the number of sex workers on the streets was approximately the same as before the Act came into force and, in some cases, even slightly reduced, contrary to allegations that it has increased. The extent of sex work was compared to 1999, the only notable change being a trend from managed sex work to the private sector. An examination of entry and exit factors showed that many sex workers said they desired to continue to sell sex, as financial return and independence were attractive features. Workers seemed more empowered, but there was still violence on the streets. It is clear that the Act did not decriminalise violence, and the police take action about violence when sex workers make complaints (c.f., R v Connolly, a police officer who was jailed in 2009 for blackmailing a sex worker into giving him free sex). Some deficiencies in safe practices, especially for oral sex, were identified. Perceived stigma remained a problem. Inconsistencies were noted between local and central government intent, the former being more restrictive, causing problems for some workers.

The Prostitution Law Review Committee presented its final report in May 2008. It found no evidence for the claims of critics at the time of introduction, and it concluded that there was no expansion of the industry. However, employment conditions still left a good deal to be desired. Stigma remained a major problem, and the traditional distrust of authorities also remained. Sex workers are now more willing to report crimes against them than they had been in the past.

Following the release of the evaluation, suggestions of bias were raised, and critics such as the evangelical Christian TEAR Fund&#x27;s Humanitarian Chronicle stated that authors of the report were &quot;supporters&quot; of the sex industry and thus not &quot;neutral&quot;. They stated that the situation was much worse than presented in the evaluation. Alex Penk, Maxim Institute&#x27;s Policy and Research Manager, said that: &quot;The report released by the Prostitution Law Review Committee today clearly shows that the Prostitution Reform Act is not making life safer for many of New Zealand&#x27;s most vulnerable men, women, and young people.&quot;

Melissa Farley, an opponent of the legislation, stated that the decriminalisation of prostitution had very negative effects (e. g., an increase in human trafficking and street prostitution), and that the NZ Prostitution Law Review Committee &quot;was biased and blatantly favored the sex industry&quot;. However, Farley has been criticised for failing to provide any facts or details to back up her assertions. Furthermore, Farley continues to use a claim that &quot;the numbers of those prostituting on the street in Auckland have increased by 400% since decriminalization&quot;. During an online debate in &quot;The Economist&quot;, Farley repeated these figures, claiming at paragraph 35:
However, in reply to the claims Farley and others make, the Prostitution Law Review Committee (2008: 40) stated: 
Furthermore, in relation to human trafficking, the PLRC (2008: 167) stated:
===Subsequent initiatives===
Moves to restrict prostitution in New Zealand continue. In 2010, National MP Tau Henare called for restricting premises from being opened near schools. However this actually falls under local municipal responsibility. The Kiwi Party called for the repeal of the Act. The party&#x27;s last remaining MP was voted out of Parliament in 2008, and it was subsequently absorbed into the Conservative Party of New Zealand. The party maintains the Kiwi Party&#x27;s earlier opposition to prostitution law reform, but, like the Kiwi Party before it, polls well under the minimum threshold required for parliamentary list-only representation.

In May 2013, Elizabeth Subritzky submitted a petition on behalf of Freedom from Sexual Exploitation that asked the House of Representatives to &quot;legislate for a national plan of action to combat street prostitution, including a law which makes the purchase of sexual services illegal&quot; (the Swedish model). The Ministry of Justice responded to the assumptions in Petition 2011/60 in September 2013, followed by a response by the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective (NZPC) in February 2014. On 7 November 2014, the Justice and Electoral Committee of the New Zealand Parliament issued its report which rejected the petition. In its concluding comment, the committee stated: &quot;We appreciate the petitioner&#x27;s concerns about street prostitution. However, we are aware that the eradication of street-based prostitution has not proved to be achievable in any jurisdiction, and simply banning it may have negative consequences for the health and safety of sex workers. We support the Prostitution Law Review Committee’s conclusion that local approaches are likely to be most effective in dealing with street prostitution.&quot; Reacting to the report, Dr Calum Bennachie from the New Zealand Prostitutes Collective stated that, &quot;When other groups are finally given rights by society, they rarely have to keep returning to parliament to protect those rights. Yet, sex workers, who have been given their rights by Parliament in 2003 when sex work was decriminalised, continually have to defend themselves in parliament, fight the same battles, and time after time have to refute the same tired arguments based on invented figures.&quot;

==Today==
As in other countries, New Zealand sex workers work in a variety of settings, including street prostitution and the indoor market in brothels and saunas, as well as for escort agencies and as independent workers.

=== Street prostitution ===
Street prostitution continues to dominate debates because of its visibility. For instance, sex workers often gather on and around Karangahape Road and Hunter&#x27;s Corner in Auckland, Cuba/Vivian/Marion Streets in Wellington, and Manchester Street in Christchurch amongst other places. Since the 22 February 2011 earthquake in Christchurch this has moved to Ferry Road and the residential end of Manchester Street.

Despite it being illegal (see Attorney General&#x27;s opinion on the New Zealand Bill of Rights) to discriminate against individuals on the basis of gender identity within New Zealand, the transgender community often finds that many of its younger members require survival sex for food, shelter and rest. As such, they are heavily represented within street sex work.

Conflicts in the South Auckland area of Manukau continue to be the focus of debate (see below).

=== Brothels and escort agencies ===
Many sex workers find employment in brothels or escort agencies. In the brothels, clients come to the place of business, which may be in a commercial area and fairly obvious, sometimes attached to a strip club, or more discreetly in a residential area. Escort agencies take phone calls from clients and arrange for the worker to go to their homes or motels. Typically the business will charge the worker a fee per shift, and will usually also take a set percentage of the client&#x27;s fee. It is illegal for brothel operators to fine workers for lateness, unprofessional conduct and other misdemeanours, but many legally charge what they call &#x27;shift fees&#x27;, and most require their workers to buy their own clothes and accessories. This means that on a slow night the worker may actually lose money. However, brothels and escort agencies are generally seen as preferable to street prostitution, as their environment appears to be relatively safe. Brothels vary in size between 3 sex workers on duty to up to approximately 30. Brothels and agencies advertise through a range of media, including billboards, the Internet, and late night television advertisements, but especially newspaper advertisements, particularly in &quot;New Zealand Truth&quot; until its closure in 2013.

One of the results of the law change is that 16- and 17-year-old sex workers are no longer allowed to work in brothels. With the exception of several well publicised cases this change has been successful.

Sex workers who do not wish to be employed often set up one-person or two-person brothels or agencies, commonly in their homes. Within the definitions of the act these are called small owner operated brothels (SOOBs). They tend to rely on classified newspaper advertisements or by advertising on the Internet.

The location of brothels within local territories has been a continuing area of litigation, and a poll conducted in March 2011 suggested that 66% of the population would support a ban on brothels in residential areas. The same poll showed a 50% support for banning street prostitution.

This poll published by NZ Herald was initially commissioned by the political conservative Christian group Family First and run by Curia Market Research. The research has drawn criticism as potentially representing bias due to the ties to Family First. Potential areas of result skew include: 
* An unusually high proportion of respondents from more conservative rural areas. 31% of respondents versus 8.4% population distribution. (Source: see table one)
* Age distributions not reflective of the general population instead favouring older more conservative age groups (although the overall effect of this is unknown as approval and disapproval varied significantly throughout age groups without clear trend towards changing attitudes with age).
* Respondents were 57% female and 43% male while population distributions show females as 51% of the population. This may have had significant effect as females were found to be more substantially more likely to disapprove of prostitution (For females 44% to 64% approve regulation, while in males 28% to 39% approve).

=== Conflict – the case of Manukau (Auckland) ===
Manukau City in South Auckland consistently opposed the legislation. Manukau felt that street prostitution was particularly problematic in its area. Manukau City Council&#x27;s portfolio leader for community safety, Councillor Dick Quax, was particularly critical. In 2009, he said that &quot;involvement of gangs and organised crime in street prostitution has become evident (...) Street prostitution also attracts offensive litter, disorder, drugs, and intimidation&quot;, and &quot;There are kids going to school with condoms lying on the street and prostitutes still standing around. It&#x27;s dangerous, not only for the workers themselves, but for the rest of the community. We&#x27;re sick of it (...) The community has had enough. It&#x27;s not fun to come out in the morning and be having to clean up condoms lying in your garden and on the fence. Cleaning up condoms and needles – it&#x27;s just not fair.&quot;

This has led to conflicts with the locals, which have attempted to curb this phenomenon, by trying to scare off prostitutes&#x27; customers, breaking negotiations between prostitutes and clients, and sending the prostitutes&#x27; clients letters, tracking them down through their car registration plates.

A private Bill, the Manukau City Council (Control of Street Prostitution) Bill 2005, led to hearings before a select committee, but failed to pass its second parliamentary reading on 11 October 2006 (46 votes to 73) following a Select Committee Report that stated that, &quot;initiatives supported by the local community, sex workers and their advocates, outreach workers, social agencies, and the police are a more effective and appropriate use of resources than the proposed legislated solution&quot;. A government review of the situation was carried out in 2009, and concluded no further special legislative action was required. This resulted in critics of the legislation to be dissatisfied. Councillor Quax said that the review was very disappointing: &quot;It ignores the fact that anti-social behaviour such as harassment and intimidation has become worse since the passing of the legislation decriminalising prostitution.&quot;

Manukau then made a further attempt to regulate prostitution with the Manukau City Council (Regulation of Prostitution in Specified Places) Bill 197-1 (2010).
This passed first reading 82 votes to 36 in a conscience vote on 8 September 2010. The Bill was opposed by the Māori Party.
The Bill&#x27;s purpose is stated as &quot;This Bill provides for local bylaw control over the locations where the business of prostitution or commercial sexual services may occur when that business or those services take place or are conducted other than in a brothel or a small owner-operated brothel in Manukau City&quot;
and was referred to the Local Government and Environment Select Committee, which required submissions by 5 November.
all of which have been posted on-line.

The future of the Bill was placed in doubt when Manukau City Council ceased to exist in late 2010, being absorbed into the Auckland Council. However, the new Auckland Council endorsed the bill
and in view of the municipal reorganisation Auckland was given till February 2011 to present its submission, the Committee hoping to report to parliament in March 2011, enabling a second reading of the bill.
The Auckland Council asked the NZPC to make a presentation to it on 15 February 2011.
On 27 January 2011, Council voted 11 to 7 to support a submission to the committee on the bill, in order to give them powers to prohibit street prostitution anywhere in Auckland.

However, in late June 2011, retiring Manurewa New Zealand Labour Party MP George Hawkins conceded that his private members bill had insufficient parliamentary support to pass its second reading, now scheduled for September 2011, and said that the perceived &quot;radical&quot; expansion of the bill to encompass the whole of Auckland City would adversely affect any subsequent passage. Other objections are local exemptions to national ambit legislation, and criticism from law enforcement and social service agencies that provide front-line health and social services to street sex workers. It was also seen as contravening the Bill of Rights. Despite such objections, local Papatoetoe businesses hope to invest in more closed-circuit television surveillance cameras to deal with what they view as &quot;anti-social&quot; and &quot;public nuisance&quot; behaviour allegedly ancillary to street sex work. Supporters of the sex workers argue that the behaviour in question may be unrelated to their presence, and linked to the early closure of public toilets and widespread alcohol outlets within the adjacent area.

The private member&#x27;s bill was later reintroduced to Parliament, with strong criticism from some members of the LGBT community. They argued that the bill would disproportionately affect transgender street sex workers, given that gender identity is not covered within New Zealand&#x27;s Human Rights Act 1993. They also argued that the Manukau and Auckland City Council had contributed to the situation through closure of public toilets and denial of the use of council rental accommodation to sex workers, and denounced what is argued to be vigilante tactics from some anti-sexworker local residents. They argued that in instances of inappropriate sex worker behaviour, local councils, concerned residents, police, and business interests should rely on the Summary Offences Act 1981. Furthermore, the council is stated to have exaggerated the number of street sex workers.

The Local Government and Environment Committee reported back to Parliament on the Manukau City Council (Regulation of Prostitution in Specified Places) Bill on 5 December 2014 and recommended that it not be passed. The Bill received its final vote on 25 February 2015 and was defeated 109–11, with only New Zealand First voting for the bill.

Whether or not this means that there will be a third private members bill to re-criminalize street sex work, despite this second consecutive defeat, is uncertain. Defeated former New Zealand First List MP Asenati Lole-Taylor was an advocate of such tactics, but she was too low down on her party list rankings to return to Parliament after the 2014 New Zealand general election. For her party, New Zealand First Deputy Leader Tracey Martin spoke in support of the bill&#x27;s passage during its second parliamentary reading and consequent defeat.

=== Prostitution and minors ===
Underage involvement in the sex industry continues to be a controversial issue in New Zealand, both before and after the passage of the PRA in 2003, with conflicting claims of its extent or relationship to the PRA.

====The law====
Child prostitution is illegal. The Prostitution Reform Act 2003 reads as follows:
Thus, it is legal for a person under 18 to be a sex worker, but it is illegal for anyone else to profit from them in this capacity, or cause, assist, facilitate, or encourage them to provide commercial sexual services to any person. It is also illegal for anyone to purchase sex from a person aged under 18. The media are likely to require photographic ID before placing advertisements to ensure they are complying with this law. The defence of &quot;reasonableness&quot; has been removed, but sex workers appearing under age may be asked by police to provide proof of age.

There appears to be no law prohibiting a person under 18 from being a client of a prostitute, thus the legal age for this is presumably 16, the legal age of consent in New Zealand.

==== Media publicity ====
Newspapers report on concerns about underage street workers,
stating that this is the commonest entry point into the trade for them and that some of them may be being pimped by gang members.

Reports have cited some community workers who stated that they had found girls &quot;as young as 10 or 11&quot; selling sex, and one mentioned students from a West Auckland high school who &quot;turned tricks&quot; at lunchtime. Children as young as 13 were also removed from the streets of South Auckland.

Convictions have been obtained against operators who did not check ID and hired under age workers. There have been several cases in Christchurch. Another case occurred in Whangārei.

In 2005, ECPAT New Zealand and the Stop Demand Foundation (agencies which combat the sexual exploitation of children), commenting on the Ministry of Justice&#x27;s report &quot;The Nature and Extent of the Sex Industry in New Zealand&quot;,
questioned the effectiveness of New Zealand&#x27;s legislation in relation to underage prostitution; the agencies pointed to a police survey of the New Zealand sex industry which showed that 210 children under the age of 18 years were identified as selling sex, with three-quarters being concentrated in one Police District.

In Christchurch in 2008, Salvation Army officer Major Wendy Barney from Christchurch&#x27;s Street Outreach Service (SOS) said underage prostitution was &quot;a big problem – but also a hidden one&quot;. Nevertheless, this anecdotal evidence is not supported by statement made by outreach workers from youth support agencies, including Youth and Cultural Development (YCD), who indicate that many of the young people are not working, but are &quot;hanging out&quot; on the streets.

Despite these claims, police have continued to bring prosecutions for underage prostitution against the brothels despite relaxed oversight.

====US Human Rights Reports====
The United States Department of State Human Rights Reports from 2004–2009 comment on child prostitution cases in New Zealand. 
The 2008 report states that prosecutors in Christchurch applied for the first time the law banning sexual slavery, adopted in 2006 in accordance with the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child. However this is not mentioned in domestic sources, and the PRA provides penalties for such actions; and the 2009 report does not mention it.

The NZ government has criticised the US reports as being based on faulty and biased data sets. For example, it appears that the State Department ignored material in the Prostitution Law Review Committee Report, which indicated there was no evidence of increased underage sex work in the New Zealand sex industry. This latter report is acknowledged in the 2009 US report.

==Support and services for sex workers==

The New Zealand Prostitutes&#x27; Collective (NZPC) is a New Zealand-based organisation that supports the rights of sex workers and educates prostitutes about minimising the risks of the job. It was founded in 1987 by, among others, Catherine Healy, and received funding from the Minister of Health in 1988, and subsequently the Department of Health (which became the Ministry of Health). The organisation played a major part in the decriminalisation of prostitution.

==Further information from evaluation process==
The report &quot;The Impact of the Prostitution Reform Act on the Health and Safety Practices of Sex Workers: Report to the Prostitution Law Review Committee&quot; from the Christchurch School of Medicine was a study of 772 sex workers in New Zealand, covering Auckland, Wellington and Christchurch as main urban centres, and Nelson and the Hawkes Bay as secondary centres. It and studies by the Crime and Justice Research Centre at Victoria University provided the Prostitution Law Review Committee with the evidence that it required to reach a conclusion about the effect of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003 on sex workers.

The researchers described this process further in a 2010 book titled &quot;Taking the crime out of sex work- New Zealand sex workers&#x27; fight for decriminalisation&quot;. It was written by Gillian Abel (a senior public health researcher and lecturer at the University of Otago, New Zealand), Lisa Fitzgerald (a public health sociologist and social science lecturer in the School of Population Health, University of Queensland), and Catherine Healy (a founding member of the New Zealand Prostitutes&#x27; Collective). The book includes the results of interviews with over 700 sex workers, and concludes that the decriminalisation has had positive effects for the prostitutes&#x27; safety and health.

In its 2008 &quot;Report of the Prostitution Law Review Committee on the Operation of the Prostitution Reform Act 2003&quot;, the committee provided further information on many of the cases and background of sex work in New Zealand. The Report also addressed issues raised by ECPAT New Zealand and the Stop Demand Foundation, and the claims made by those supporting the Manukau City Council (Control of Street Prostitution) Bill 2005.

<text>Robert Merle (; 28 August 1908 – 27 March 2004) was a French novelist.

==Early life==
Merle was born in 1908 in Tébessa, French Algeria. His father Félix, who was an interpreter &quot;with a perfect knowledge of literary and spoken Arabic&quot;, was killed in 1916 in the Dardanelles. Young Merle and his mother moved to Paris, where he attended three lycées and the Sorbonne.

==Career==
===Academia and World War II===
Merle was professor of English Literature at several universities until the outbreak of the Second World War in 1939. During the war, Merle was conscripted into the French army and assigned as an interpreter to the British Expeditionary Force. In 1940, he was in the Dunkirk evacuation on the beach of Zuydcoote — which he called a &quot;blind and abominable lottery&quot; — and was captured by the Germans. Merle was taken prisoner to Stalag VID at Dortmund, and escaped, but was recaptured at Belgian customs. He was repatriated in July 1943, and after the war was awarded the Croix du Combattant.

===Writing===
Merle used his experiences at Dunkirk in his 1949 novel &quot;Week-end at Zuydcoote&quot;, which became a &quot;sensational success&quot; and won the Prix Goncourt. A 1964 feature film adaptation, &quot;Weekend at Dunkirk&quot;, was directed by Henri Verneuil and starred Jean-Paul Belmondo. It was a box office hit and made both men famous.

Merle&#x27;s 1967 novel &quot;Un animal doué de raison&quot; (lit. &quot;A Sentient Animal&quot;), a stark Cold War satire inspired by John Lilly&#x27;s studies of dolphins and the Caribbean Crisis, was translated into English and filmed as &quot;The Day of the Dolphin&quot; (1973) starring George C. Scott. Merle&#x27;s post-apocalyptic novel &quot;Malevil&quot; (1972) was also adapted into a 1981 film. His 1952 novel &quot;La mort est mon métier&quot; was adapted into a 1977 film, his 1962 novel &quot;L&#x27;île&quot; was filmed as a 1987 miniseries and &quot;Le propre de l&#x27;homme&quot; (1989) was adapted into a 1996 TV movie.

Among Merle&#x27;s other works are the 1950 play &quot;Flamineo&quot;, based on John Webster&#x27;s &quot;The White Devil&quot;, the 1948 biography &quot;Oscar Wilde&quot; (extended in 1955 as &quot;Oscar Wilde, or The Destiny of Homosexuality&quot;), and various translations including Jonathan Swift&#x27;s &quot;Gulliver&#x27;s Travels&quot;. In 1965 Merle wrote &quot;Moncada: premier combat de Fidel Castro&quot; and &quot;Ahmed Ben Bella&quot;, and around this time translated the diaries of Che Guevara. Until the invasion of Afghanistan by the Red Army, Merle was a sympathizer of the French Communist Party. He said:
Merle&#x27;s &quot;major achievement&quot; was his 13-book series of historical novels, &quot;Fortune de France&quot; (1977–2003), which recreate 16th and 17th century France through the eyes of a fictitious Protestant doctor turned spy. A &quot;genuine scholar of language&quot;, Merle wrote the novels using many of the appropriate French speech rhythms and idioms of the historical period. The series made Merle a household name in France, with the author repeatedly called the Alexandre Dumas of the 20th century.

==Personal life==
Merle was married three times, and had four sons and two daughters. He died in 2004 at age 95 of a heart attack in Montfort-l&#x27;Amaury, France.

==Reception==
Kirkup called the &quot;Fortune de France&quot; series &quot;spectacular&quot; and dubbed it Merle&#x27;s &quot;major achievement&quot;. Douglas Johnson of &quot;The Guardian&quot; described the author as &quot;a master of the historical novel&quot;. The series made Merle a household name in France, and he has been repeatedly called the Alexandre Dumas of the 20th century. &quot;Le Monde&quot; dubbed Merle &quot;France&#x27;s greatest popular novelist&quot;, and &quot;Le Figaro&quot; observed, &quot;Robert Merle is one of the very few French writers who have attained both popular success and the admiration of critics.&quot;

Writing for &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, Allan Massie praised Merle&#x27;s &quot;thorough research, depth of understanding and popular touch&quot;, noting that &quot;one of the strengths of Merle’s novels in his ability to evoke the feeling and texture of everyday life as well as high politics&quot;. Massie compared the first novel in Merle&#x27;s series to Maurice Druon&#x27;s &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot; (&quot;Les Rois maudits&quot;), another famed French historical novel series, writing &quot;There is a philosophical depth to the novel absent from Druon, for the Brethren are attracted to the Reformed Protestant (or Huguenot) faith ... Though not as gripping as &quot;The Accursed Kings&quot;, &quot;The Brethren&quot; never strays, as Druon sometimes does, into the grotesque. It has a credibly human solidity.&quot; Toby Clements of &quot;The Telegraph&quot; wrote, &quot;There are set-piece discussions on the dilemmas of faith that are informative if not the stuff of high drama, and passages on the history of France that can only be made sense of with the aid of a map and a memory for names. But elsewhere there is much colour, and, overall, &quot;The Brethren&quot; gives a salty and plausible idea of just how different, odd and parlous life might have been.&quot;

As of 2014, &quot;Fortune de France&quot; had sold over five million copies in France.

<text>Her Majesty&#x27;s Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; is the former royal yacht of the British monarchy. She was in their service from 1954-97. She was the 83rd such vessel since King Charles II acceded to the throne in 1660, and is the second royal yacht to bear the name, the first being the racing cutter built for the Prince of Wales in 1893. During her 43-year career, the yacht travelled more than around the world to more than 600 ports in 135 countries. Now retired from royal service, &quot;Britannia&quot; is permanently berthed at Ocean Terminal, Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland, where it is a visitor attraction with over 300,000 visits each year.

==Construction==
HMY &quot;Britannia&quot; was built at the shipyard of John Brown &amp; Co. Ltd in Clydebank, Dunbartonshire. She was launched by Queen Elizabeth II on 16 April 1953, and commissioned on 11 January 1954. The ship was designed with three masts: a foremast, a mainmast, and a mizzenmast. The top aerial on the foremast and the top of the mainmast were hinged to allow the ship to pass under bridges.

&quot;Britannia&quot; it was claimed (as justification for the cost) was designed to be converted into a hospital ship in time of war, however when the need came in the Falklands War this capability was exposed as being spurious as HMY Britannia, unique among the Royal Navy&#x27;s fleet, required special fuel oil (unique to her) and had only a 200-bed capacity. Instead, the 16,907-gross-register-ton (47,880 m3) P&amp;O liner SS Uganda, which was in the Mediterranean on an educational cruise with a thousand schoolchildren on board, was requisitioned, and modified to become a hospital ship.

In the event of nuclear war, it was intended for the Queen and Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, to take refuge aboard &quot;Britannia&quot; off the north-west coast of Scotland.

==Crew==
Royal Navy officers were appointed for up to two years. The crew were volunteers from the general service of the Royal Navy. After 365 days&#x27; service, they could be admitted to the Permanent Royal Yacht Service as Royal Yachtsmen and serve until they chose to leave the service or were dismissed for medical or disciplinary reasons. As a result, some served for 20 years or more. The crew also included a detachment of Royal Marines. A contingent of Royal Marines Band members embarked whenever &quot;Britannia&quot; was on duty away from home port.

==History==
&quot;Britannia&quot; sailed on her maiden voyage from Portsmouth to Grand Harbour, Malta, departing on 14 April and arriving on 22 April 1954. She carried Prince Charles and Princess Anne to Malta in order for them to meet the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh at the end of the royal couple&#x27;s Commonwealth tour. The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh embarked on &quot;Britannia&quot; for the first time in Tobruk on 1 May 1954.

On 20 July 1959, &quot;Britannia&quot; sailed the newly opened Saint Lawrence Seaway en route from Canada to Chicago, where she docked, making the Queen the first British monarch to visit the city. U.S. president Dwight D. Eisenhower was aboard &quot;Britannia&quot; for part of this cruise; Presidents Gerald Ford, Ronald Reagan, and Bill Clinton were welcomed aboard in later years. Anne and Mark Phillips took their honeymoon cruise aboard the ship in 1973; Charles would do the same with Diana in 1981. The ship evacuated over 1,000 refugees from the civil war in Aden in 1986. The vessel sailed to Canada in 1991 and made a port of call in Toronto and Kingston, Ontario.

HMY &quot;Britannia&quot;, when on royal duties, was escorted by a Royal Navy warship. The yacht was a regular sight at Cowes Week in early August and, usually, for the remainder of the month, was home to the Queen and her family for an annual cruise around the islands off the west coast of Scotland (known as the &quot;Western Isles Tour&quot;).

During her career as Royal Yacht, &quot;Britannia&quot; conveyed the Queen, other members of the Royal Family and various dignitaries on 696 foreign visits and 272 visits in British waters. In this time, &quot;Britannia&quot; steamed .

===Decommissioning===

In 1994, the Conservative government announced the yacht&#x27;s retirement:

In January 1997, the government committed itself to replacing the Royal Yacht if reelected. The timing of the announcement, close to a general election, was controversial; &quot;The Guardian Weekly&quot; called it &quot;part of a populist appeal to wavering Tory voters in the run-up to the general election&quot; and reported that the Queen was &quot;furious&quot; that the Royal Family was &quot;dragged into the centre of the election campaign, just as it is fighting to restore its public image.&quot; Sir Edward Heath publicly objected to the government&#x27;s handling of the issue, stating &quot;The Conservative Party above all must be an honourable party. And I don&#x27;t believe the actions that have been taken are honourable ones and should never have been taken in this way.&quot;

The government argued that the cost was justified by its role in foreign policy and promoting British interests abroad, particularly through conferences held by British Invisibles, formerly the Committee on Invisible Exports. It was estimated by the Overseas Trade Board that events held on board the yacht helped raise £3 billion for HM Treasury between 1991 and 1995 alone.

The Labour opposition announced it would not commit the use of public funds for a replacement vessel for at least the first two years of any new Labour government. After its election victory in May 1997, the new government considered multiple options for the future of a royal yacht, but concluded in October of that year that &quot;Britannia&quot; would not be replaced:
The Royal Yacht&#x27;s final foreign mission was to convey the last Governor of Hong Kong, Chris Patten, and the Prince of Wales back from Hong Kong after its handover to the People&#x27;s Republic of China on 1 July 1997. &quot;Britannia&quot; was decommissioned on 11 December 1997. The Queen, normally undemonstrative in public, was reported to have cried at the decommissioning ceremony that was attended by most of the senior members of the Royal Family.

==Visitor attraction==
Listed as part of the National Historic Fleet, &quot;Britannia&quot; is a visitor attraction moored in the historic Port of Leith in Edinburgh, Scotland, and is cared for by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust, a registered charity. There was some controversy over the siting of the ship, with some arguing that she would be better moored on the River Clyde, where she was built, than in Edinburgh, with which the yacht had few links. Her positioning in Leith coincided with a redevelopment of the harbour area and the advent of Scottish devolution.

Entrance to the yacht is via the Ocean Terminal development, and over 300,000 people visit the Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; every year. She is one of the UK&#x27;s top evening events venues. On 18 May 2006, the Swiss-born Hollywood actress and first Bond girl, Ursula Andress, celebrated her 70th birthday on board. On 29 July 2011, a drinks reception was held on board &quot;Britannia&quot; for Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s granddaughter Zara Phillips and her then fiancé, Mike Tindall, to celebrate their forthcoming wedding.

An early Land Rover in much-restored shape is displayed in the on-board garage and a retired Rolls-Royce Phantom V state car is parked on the wharf below the ship. The tour of the five decks open to the public includes the Queen&#x27;s bedroom, which can be viewed behind a glass wall, and the state dining and drawing rooms, which hosted grand receptions for kings and queens, presidents and prime ministers throughout the world. The clocks on board are stopped at 3:01, the time that the Queen last disembarked. The royal deck tea room was added in 2009.

The 1936 racing yacht , once owned by the Queen and Prince Philip, is now berthed alongside &quot;Britannia&quot;. &quot;Bloodhound&quot; was one of the most successful ocean-racing yachts ever built and was the yacht on which King Charles III and the Princess Royal learned to sail. The Royal Yacht &quot;Britannia&quot; Trust bought &quot;Bloodhound&quot; in early 2010 and she is the centrepiece of an exhibition focusing on the Royal Family&#x27;s passion for sailing. Visitors can view &quot;Bloodhound&quot; from a specially built pontoon when the racing yacht is in port. During July and August, she is berthed in Oban marina and is available for private charter, as she sails around the islands once visited by the Royal Family during their annual fortnight holiday in the Western Isles of Scotland. During this period, Royal Yachtsmen (Yotties) from &quot;Britannia&quot;&#x27;s original crew sail the yacht for the Britannia Trust.

From 2019, the MV &quot;Fingal&quot; has been permanently berthed near to the &quot;Britannia&quot; at the Albert Dock Basin.  The &quot;Fingal&quot; is a former Northern Lighthouse Board ship converted into a boutique hotel owned by the Royal Yacht Britannia Trust.

==Proposals for successor==
Proposals for the construction of a new royal yacht, perhaps financed through a loan or by the royal family&#x27;s own funds, have made little headway. In December 2019 it was reported that the late Sir Donald Gosling donated £50 million in his will to pay for it.

In May 2021, it was reported that Prime Minister Boris Johnson would announce the construction of a new royal yacht, named after Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, &quot;within weeks&quot;. On 29 May, Johnson announced that the &quot;new national flagship&quot; – a ship rather than a luxury yacht – would enter service within the next four years and cost up to £200 million. The following day it was reported that government plans to name the ship after the Duke of Edinburgh were not well-received amongst royal sources, and these plans had subsequently been &quot;abandoned&quot;. By 2022 plans had progressed to two favoured design teams. It was reported in October 2022 that Chancellor Jeremy Hunt was planning to scrap plans for a new yacht as part of a package of spending cuts.

<text>Jhonen C. Vasquez (; born September 1, 1974) is an American cartoonist, writer, producer, and director. He is best known for creating the &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; comic book series (alongside its spin-offs &quot;Squee!&quot;, &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;, and &quot;Fillerbunny&quot;) and the Nickelodeon animated series &quot;Invader Zim&quot;.

==Early life==
Jhonen C. Vasquez was born in San Jose, California, on September 1, 1974. He is of Mexican and Venezuelan descent. He grew up in East San Jose and attended Mt. Pleasant High School, where he spent much of his class time drawing in sketchbooks.

Vasquez was a fan of Disney animated features growing up, and found himself even more fascinated by alternative animation by filmmakers such as Ralph Bakshi. Vasquez cited &quot;The Plague Dogs&quot; and &quot;Flight of Dragons&quot; as two of the most personally influential animated films he saw in childhood, while at the same time in live action, he found himself most influenced by Ridley Scott&#x27;s &quot;Alien&quot;.

Vasquez also read his older brother&#x27;s superhero comics as a child, but first became interested in exploring the medium through the original &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; comics by Peter Laird and Kevin Eastman. He said:

During high school, Vasquez took part in a contest to design a new look for his school&#x27;s mascot. He earned no prizes; however, on the back of a preliminary drawing for the contest, he drew his first sketch of who would later become the title character of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, and the student newspaper published a number of his comic strips featuring Johnny. He also created Happy Noodle Boy while attending Mt. Pleasant. 

After graduating in 1992, he became a film student at De Anza College in Cupertino, California. Despite having little formal artistic training, he soon dropped out of De Anza to pursue a career as a professional cartoonist. He met Roman Dirge and Rosearik Rikki Simons at Alternative Press Expo in 1995; Dirge later became a writer on Vasquez&#x27;s series &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, while Simons joined the show&#x27;s coloring team and voiced Zim&#x27;s erratic robot sidekick GIR. Simons also worked with Vasquez on the coloring seen in his two-issue comic &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;. In September 1996, Vasquez announced in his introductory text to the sixth issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot; that the comic book had been successful enough for him to quit his day job and focus on his art.

==Career==
===Comics===
&quot;Carpe Noctem&quot; magazine published early one-page strips featuring Johnny in the early 1990s. In 1995, Slave Labor Graphics began publishing a series of Johnny comics after Vasquez submitted samples of his artwork to them. Vasquez&#x27;s first comic, &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, ran for seven issues and was collected as a hardcover and a trade paperback book named &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac: Director&#x27;s Cut&quot;. The cover features the logo &quot;Z?&quot;, meaning &quot;question sleep&quot;, which appears frequently throughout Vasquez&#x27;s work and relates to his characters&#x27; insomnia and his own hypnophobia. The series follows Johnny as he searches for meaning in his life, a quest that frequently leads to the violent deaths of those around him as well as, briefly, his own. A photograph of one of Vasquez&#x27;s friends, Leah England, serves as the middle of a portrait collection on the cover for the second issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. England also gave Vasquez the inspiration for a filler strip about a child who was dangerously afraid of losing sight of his mother, as well as the notorious &quot;Meanwhile&quot; filler piece in the second issue of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;. Vasquez&#x27;s next project was &quot;The Bad Art Collection&quot;, a 16-page one-shot comic. He stated that he did the book&#x27;s art while he was in high school to discourage classmates from asking him to draw for them.

In 1997, Vasquez gave Squee, a supporting character from &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, his own four-issue series. It chronicles Squee&#x27;s encounters with aliens, Satan&#x27;s son, and eventually Satan himself. The trade version (which features a cover image of Squee with the words &quot;Buy me or I&#x27;ll die!&quot;) contains, in addition to the actual Squee comics, the Meanwhiles that were left out of the Director&#x27;s Cut of &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;, as well as comics of Vasquez&#x27;s &quot;real life&quot; and &quot;Wobbly-Headed Bob&quot;. Vasquez&#x27;s next project was &quot;I Feel Sick&quot;, colored by Rikki Simons. &quot;I Feel Sick&quot; follows a tortured artist named Devi (another character introduced in &quot;Johnny the Homicidal Maniac&quot;) as she tries to maintain her sanity in an insane vision of society, despite conversing with Sickness, one of her own paintings. Slave Labor has published three &quot;Fillerbunny&quot; mini-comics, the third having been released in March 2005. The Mini-Comic was a spin-off of a filler comic designed to replace a vacant page usually reserved for advertising space in the &quot;Squee!&quot; comics.

Vasquez said at the 2007 New York Comic Con that the original &quot;Fillerbunny&quot; comics would be done in a single night and he would rush through and do whatever he could in a small amount of time. The third issue, however, broke this mold. According to the introduction, it took over nine months to complete, and he feels it is of much higher quality than the first two. At Comic-Con 2005, Vasquez mentioned that his next comic was a love story. Since this, however, he attended an event in early 2007 and stated he was not working on his &quot;own&quot; comics – he was collaborating on two comics in the style of &quot;Everything Can Be Beaten&quot;, acting only as author. The first, titled &quot;Jellyfist&quot;, was intended for release on July 25, 2007, but the initial print run of &quot;Jellyfist&quot; was incredibly poor, and so it was re-released in October 2007. In 2009, Vasquez collaborated with other alternative artists in Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;Strange Tales&quot;, issue 2 of 3, with a story about MODOK. It sold extremely well and all three issues have been collected into a hardcover trade paperback. The next year he returned for Marvel&#x27;s &quot;Strange Tales&quot; II, issue 1 of 3, with a story about Wolverine.

In 2012, DC Comics announced that Vasquez joined the writing team for their digital comic &quot;Beyond the Fringe&quot;, based on the Fox TV series &quot;Fringe&quot;. In May 2014, Vasquez announced on his Tumblr page that he would be re-releasing his previous &quot;Fillerbunny&quot; comics into a new collection and additionally releasing his first new comic book in ten years.

===Television===
At Nickelodeon, Vasquez created the animated television series &quot;Invader Zim&quot;, which aired on the network and then later on Nicktoons. It focuses on the daily life of Zim, a naïve alien from the planet Irk who tries to conquer Earth and enslave humans, before his attempts are constantly thwarted by a young paranormal investigator Dib, who believes that Zim is an alien but no one believes him. The first episode aired on March 30, 2001. The series lasted for two seasons, before it was cancelled by Nickelodeon, saying that its main causes were low ratings, over-budget production and lack of interest in continuation of the series. The last episode before the show&#x27;s cancellation, &quot;The Most Horrible X-Mas Ever&quot; (a Christmas special), aired on December 10, 2002. Episodes of the third season and a finale then remained unfinished. Vasquez provided the voices for Zim&#x27;s computer, Old Kid, Minimoose, and various characters including himself as a background character (being credited as &quot;Mr. Scolex&quot;). Vasquez later returned to Nickelodeon in 2016 to write &quot;Invader Zim: Enter the Florpus&quot;, a TV movie based on &quot;Invader Zim&quot;.

Vasquez also did character designs for the Disney XD show &quot;Randy Cunningham: 9th Grade Ninja&quot;, as well as wrote for an episode of the online series &quot;Bravest Warriors&quot;. In July 2014, it was revealed that Disney Television Animation had picked up the pilot &quot;Very Important House&quot;, co-created by Vasquez and &quot;Rick and Morty&quot; production designer Jenny Goldberg, who previously collaborated with Vasquez on &quot;Jellyfist&quot;. However, on September 30, 2016, Vasquez announced on his official blog that &quot;Very Important House&quot; was ultimately not picked up for a full series. &quot;The Art of Invader Zim&quot;, which released in 2019 mentioned that &quot;Very Important House&quot; was passed due to executive leadership changes at Disney Branded Television.

===Other work===
Vasquez collaborated with Crab Scrambly to produce the storybook &quot;Everything Can Be Beaten&quot;, published by Slave Labor in 2002. Vasquez, credited as Chancre Scolex, wrote the story and Crab Scrambly illustrated it. &quot;Everything Can Be Beaten&quot; is about a strange person who lives in a room in which he can do nothing but beat kittens. However, an adventure into the outside world changes his perspective, and he discovers that &quot;everything can be beaten&quot;. The storybook inspired Urban Squall in 2008 to create the puzzle browser game &quot;Bloody Fun Day&quot;. Vasquez did the entire artwork for the deluxe edition of the Mindless Self Indulgence album &quot;If&quot; as well as the digital single &quot;Mastermind&quot;. He also directed the music videos for Mindless Self Indulgence&#x27;s &quot;Shut Me Up&quot; and The Left Rights&#x27; &quot;White&quot;. Jhonen made the cover art for the album &quot;Zero Day&quot; by MC Frontalot and also indicated that he shows his artwork in galleries from time to time. He also did an art rendition of &quot;BioShock 2&quot; called &quot;The Sisters&quot;. He was quoted saying the following about the rendition:

He also worked on a &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; short called &quot;Don Vs Raph&quot;, where Donatello and Raphael compete to see who is better, but the two always end up tying.

==Style==
Vasquez&#x27;s characters are often highly geometric and thin with heavy black outlines, almost to the point of resembling stick figures. The protagonists in his comics are typically mentally unstable characters who live in dysfunctional societies, and whose manias are able to speak through inanimate objects. His storylines tend to follow a basic dark comedy formula. His art style is very edgy and eccentric, and smiley faces are found throughout his artwork, trying to evoke an ironic sense of happiness in a world of chaos and darkness. Much of his writing conveys misanthropic and pessimistic themes, often for the purposes of parody and satire. Several of his works have featured goth characters or depictions of that subculture for the purpose of satire. In an interview on &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; in 2005, he responded to host Kevin Pereira&#x27;s comment that fans considered him &quot;a goth king&quot; by quipping, &quot;King, yeah, but not goth... I mean, that&#x27;s arrogant.&quot;

<doc id="253026" wikidata="Q41635" url="?curid=253026" title="Constantine V">
<text>Constantine V (; ; July 718 – 14 September 775) was Byzantine emperor from 741 to 775. His reign saw a consolidation of Byzantine security from external threats. As an able military leader, Constantine took advantage of civil war in the Muslim world to make limited offensives on the Arab frontier. With this eastern frontier secure, he undertook repeated campaigns against the Bulgars in the Balkans. His military activity, and policy of settling Christian populations from the Arab frontier in Thrace, made Byzantium&#x27;s hold on its Balkan territories more secure. He was also responsible for important military and administrative innovations and reforms.

Religious strife and controversy was a prominent feature of his reign. His fervent support of iconoclasm and opposition to monasticism led to his vilification by some contemporary commentators and the majority of later Byzantine writers, who denigrated him with the nicknames &quot;Dung-Named&quot; (), because he allegedly defaecated during his baptism, similarly &quot;Anointed with Urine&quot; (), and &quot;the Equestrian&quot; (), referencing the excrement of horses.

== Early life ==
Constantine was born in Constantinople, the son and successor of Emperor Leo III and his wife Maria. In the Easter of 720, at two years of age, he was associated with his father on the throne, and crowned co-emperor by Patriarch Germanus I. In Byzantine political theory more than one emperor could share the throne; however, although all were accorded the same ceremonial status, only one emperor wielded ultimate power. As the position of emperor was in theory, and sometimes in practise, elective rather than strictly hereditary, a ruling emperor would often associate a son or other chosen successor with himself as a co-emperor to ensure the eventual succession. To celebrate the coronation of his son, Leo III introduced a new silver coin, the &quot;miliaresion&quot;; worth one-twelfth of a gold &quot;nomisma&quot;, it soon became an integral part of the Byzantine economy. In 726, Constantine&#x27;s father issued the &quot;Ecloga&quot;; a revised legal code, it was attributed to both father and son jointly. Constantine married Tzitzak, daughter of the Khazar khagan Bihar, an important Byzantine ally. His new bride was baptized Irene (&quot;Eirēnē&quot;, &quot;peace&quot;) in 732. On his father&#x27;s death, Constantine succeeded as sole emperor on 18 June 741.

Historical accounts of Constantine make reference to a chronic medical condition, possibly epilepsy or leprosy; early in his reign this may have been employed by those rebelling against him to question his fitness to be emperor.

== Reign ==
=== Rebellion of Artabasdos ===
Immediately after Constantine&#x27;s accession in 741, his brother-in-law Artabasdos, husband of his older sister, Anna, rebelled. Artabasdos was the strategos (military governor) of the Opsikion &quot;theme&quot; (province) and had effective control of the Armeniac theme. The event is sometimes dated to 742, but this has been shown to be wrong.

Artabasdos struck against Constantine when their respective troops combined for an intended campaign against the Umayyad Caliphate; a trusted member of Constantine&#x27;s retinue, called Beser, was killed in the attack. Constantine escaped and sought refuge in Amorion, where he was welcomed by the local soldiers, who had been commanded by Leo III before he became emperor. Meanwhile, Artabasdos advanced on Constantinople and, with the support of Theophanes Monutes (Constantine&#x27;s regent) and Patriarch Anastasius, was acclaimed and crowned emperor. Constantine received the support of the Anatolic and Thracesian themes; Artabasdos secured the support of the theme of Thrace in addition to his own Opsikion and Armeniac soldiers.

The rival emperors bided their time making military preparations. Artabasdos marched against Constantine at Sardis in May 743 but was defeated. Three months later Constantine defeated Artabasdos&#x27; son Niketas and his Armeniac troops at Modrina and headed for Constantinople. In early November Constantine entered the capital, following a siege and a further battle. He immediately targeted his opponents, having many blinded or executed. Patriarch Anastasius was paraded on the back of an ass around the hippodrome to the jeers of the Constantinopolitan mob, though he was subsequently allowed to stay in office. Artabasdos, having fled the capital, was apprehended at the fortress of Pouzanes in Anatolia, probably located to the south of Nicomedia. Artabasdos and his sons were then publicly blinded and secured in the monastery of Chora on the outskirts of Constantinople.

=== Constantine&#x27;s support of iconoclasm ===

Like his father Leo III, Constantine supported iconoclasm, which was a theological movement that rejected the veneration of religious images and sought to destroy those in existence. Iconoclasm was later definitively classed as heretical. Constantine&#x27;s avowed enemies in what was a bitter and long-lived religious dispute were the iconodules, who defended the veneration of images. Iconodule writers applied to Constantine the derogatory epithet (&#x27;dung-named&#x27;, from , meaning &#x27;faeces&#x27; or &#x27;animal dung&#x27;, and &#x27;name&#x27;). Using this obscene name, they spread the rumour that as an infant he had defiled his own baptism by defaecating in the font, or on the imperial purple cloth with which he was swaddled.

Constantine questioned the legitimacy of any representation of God or Christ. The Church Father John of Damascus made use of the term &#x27;uncircumscribable&#x27; in relation to the depiction of God. Constantine, relying on the linguistic connection between &#x27;uncircumscribed&#x27; and &#x27;incapable of being depicted&#x27;, argued that the uncircumscribable cannot be legitimately depicted in an image. As Christian theology holds that Christ is God, he also cannot be represented in an image. The Emperor was personally active in the theological debate; evidence exists for him composing thirteen treatises, two of which survive in fragmentary form. He also presented his religious views at meetings organised throughout the empire, sending representatives to argue his case. In February 754, Constantine convened a council at Hieria, which was attended entirely by iconoclast bishops. The council agreed with Constantine&#x27;s religious policy on images, declaring them anathema, and it secured the election of a new iconoclast patriarch. However, it refused to endorse all of Constantine&#x27;s policies, which were influenced by the more extremist iconoclasts and were possibly critical of the veneration of Mary, mother of Jesus, and of the saints. The council confirmed the status of Mary as &quot;Theotokos&quot; (), or &#x27;Mother of God&#x27;, upheld the use of the terms &quot;saint&quot; and &quot;holy&quot; as legitimate, and condemned the desecration, burning, or looting of churches in the quest to suppress icon veneration.

The Council of Hieria was followed by a campaign to remove images from the walls of churches and to purge the court and bureaucracy of iconodules, however, the accounts of these events were written much later than they actually occurred, and by often vehemently anti-iconoclast sources, therefore their reliability is questionable. Since monasteries tended to be strongholds of iconophile sentiment and contributed little or nothing towards the secular needs of the state, Constantine specifically targeted these communities. He also expropriated monastic property for the benefit of the state or the army. These acts of repression against the monks were largely led by the Emperor&#x27;s general Michael Lachanodrakon, who threatened resistant monks with blinding and exile. Constantine organised numerous pairs of monks and nuns to be paraded in the hippodrome, publicly ridiculing their vows of chastity. According to Theophanes the Confessor, the iconodule abbot Stephen the Younger, was beaten to death by a mob at the behest of the authorities. However even his hagiography, the &quot;Life of St. Stephen the Younger&quot;, connects his execution more to treason against the Emperor, and indeed his punishments reflect those typically associated with an enemy of the state. Stephen was said to have trampled on a coin depicting the Emperor in order to provoke imperial retaliation and reveal the iconoclast hypocrisy of denying the force of sacred portraits but not of imperial portraits on coins. As a result of persecution, many monks fled to southern Italy and Sicily. The implacable resistance of iconodule monks and their supporters led to their propaganda reaching those close to the Emperor. On becoming aware of an iconodule-influenced conspiracy directed at himself, Constantine reacted uncompromisingly; in 765, eighteen high dignitaries charged with treason were paraded in the hippodrome, then variously executed, blinded or exiled. Patriarch Constantine II of Constantinople was implicated and deposed from office, and the following year he was tortured and beheaded.

According to later iconodule sources, for example Patriarch Nikephoros I of Constantinople&#x27;s &quot;Second Antirrheticus&quot; and treatise &quot;Against Constantinus Caballinus&quot;, Constantine&#x27;s iconoclasm had gone as far as to brand prayers to Mary and saints as heretical, or at least highly questionable. However, the extent of coherent official campaigns to forcibly destroy or cover up religious images or the existence of widespread government-sanctioned destruction of relics has been questioned by more recent scholarship. There is no evidence, for example, that Constantine formally banned the cult of saints. Pre-iconoclastic religious images did survive, and various existing accounts record that icons were preserved by being hidden. In general, the culture of pictorial religious representation appears to have survived the iconoclast period largely intact. The extent and severity of iconoclastic destruction of images and relics was exaggerated in later iconodule writings.

Scholars generally take the anathemas in the Council of Hieria condemning the one who &quot;does not ask for [the prayers of Mary and the saints] as having the freedom to intercede on behalf of the world according to the tradition of the church&quot;, as proof that Constantine never rejected the intercession of Mary and the saints, since they consider it inconceivable for an emperor to contradict the decisions of a council he convened. Moreover, the positive evidence that he rejected intercession is regarded as unreliable due to the iconodule motivation of its authors. Dissenting scholars point to the wealth of evidence, not only from Patriarch Nikephoros but from Theophanes and Patriarch Methodios I of Constantinople (847), who in his &quot;Life of Theophanes&quot; defends the intercession of saints, perpetuating a centuries-long controversy regarding the doctrine of soul-sleep, which if true would mean dead saints are incapable of intercession. They allege that it is conceivable that, although the moderate iconoclast party won at Hieria, which still affirmed the intercession of the saints, the radical iconoclasts who denied it briefly triumphed afterwards, with Constantine publicly interfering with religious practice by removing intercessory prayers to saints from church hymns and hagiographies, as described by the iconodule primary sources.

Iconodules considered Constantine&#x27;s death a divine punishment. In the 9th century, following the ultimate triumph of the iconodules, Constantine&#x27;s remains were removed from the imperial sepulchre in the Church of the Holy Apostles.

=== Domestic policies and administration ===

Assiduous in courting popularity, Constantine consciously employed the hippodrome, scene of the ever-popular chariot races, to influence the populace of Constantinople. In this he made use of the &#x27;circus factions&#x27;, which controlled the competing teams of charioteers and their supporters, had widespread social influence, and could mobilise large numbers of the citizenry. The hippodrome became the setting of rituals of humiliation for war captives and political enemies, in which the mob took delight. Constantine&#x27;s sources of support were the people and the army, and he used them against his iconodule opponents in the monasteries and in the bureaucracy of the capital. Iconoclasm was not purely an imperial religious conviction, it also had considerable popular support: some of Constantine&#x27;s actions against the iconodules may have been motivated by a desire to retain the approval of the people and the army. The monasteries were exempt from taxation and monks from service in the army; the Emperor&#x27;s antipathy towards them may have derived to a greater extent from secular, fiscal and manpower, considerations than from a reaction to their theology.

Constantine carried forward the administrative and fiscal reforms initiated by his father Leo III. The military governors (, ) were powerful figures, whose access to the resources of their extensive provinces often provided the means of rebellion. The Opsikion theme had been the power-base that enabled the rebellion of Artabasdos, and was also the theme situated nearest to the capital within Asia Minor. Constantine reduced the size of this theme, dividing from it the Bucellarian and, perhaps, the Optimaton themes. In those provinces closest to the seat of government this measure increased the number of &quot;stratēgoi&quot; and diminished the resources available to any single one, making rebellion less easy to accomplish.

Constantine was responsible for the creation of a small central army of fully professional soldiers, the imperial &quot;tagmata&quot; (&#x27;the regiments&#x27;). He achieved this by training for serious warfare a corps of largely ceremonial guards units that were attached to the imperial palace, and expanding their numbers. This force was designed to form the core of field armies and was composed of better-drilled, better-paid, and better-equipped soldiers than were found in the provincial &quot;themata&quot; units, whose troops were part-time soldier-farmers. Before their expansion, the vestigial Scholae and the other guards units presumably contained few useful soldiers, therefore Constantine must have incorporated former thematic soldiers into his new formation. Being largely based at or near the capital, the &quot;tagmata&quot; were under the immediate control of the Emperor and were free of the regional loyalties that had been behind so many military rebellions.

The fiscal administration of Constantine was highly competent. This drew from his enemies accusations of being a merciless and rapacious extractor of taxes and an oppressor of the rural population. However, the empire was prosperous and Constantine left a very well-stocked treasury for his successor. The area of cultivated land within the Empire was extended and food became cheaper; between 718 and c. 800 the corn (wheat) production of Thrace trebled. Constantine&#x27;s court was opulent, with splendid buildings, and he consciously promoted the patronage of secular art to replace the religious art that he removed.

Constantine constructed a number of notable buildings in the Great Palace of Constantinople, including the Church of the Virgin of the Pharos and the &quot;porphyra&quot;. The &quot;porphyra&quot; was a chamber lined with porphyry, a stone of imperial purple colour. In it expectant empresses underwent the final stages of labour and it was the birthplace of the children of reigning emperors. Constantine&#x27;s son Leo was the first child born here, and thereby obtained the title &quot;porphyrogénnētos&quot; (born in the purple) the ultimate accolade of legitimacy for an imperial prince or princess. The concept of a &#x27;purple birth&#x27; predated the construction of the chamber, but it gained a literal aspect from the chamber&#x27;s existence. The porphyry was reputed to have come from Rome and represented a direct link to the ancient origins of Byzantine imperial authority. Constantine also rebuilt the prominent church of Hagia Eirene in Constantinople, which had been badly damaged by the earthquake that hit Constantinople in 740. The building preserves rare examples of iconoclastic church decoration.

With the impetus of having fathered numerous offspring, Constantine codified the court titles given to members of the imperial family. He associated only his eldest son, Leo, with the throne as co-emperor (in 751), but gave his younger sons the titles of caesar for the more senior in age and nobelissimos for the more junior.

=== Campaigns against the Arabs ===

In 746, profiting by the unstable conditions in the Umayyad Caliphate, which was falling apart under Marwan II, Constantine invaded Syria, captured Germanikeia (his father&#x27;s birthplace) and recaptured the island of Cyprus. He organised the resettlement of part of the local Christian population to imperial territory in Thrace, strengthening the empire&#x27;s control of this region. In 747 his fleet destroyed the Arab fleet off Cyprus. The same year saw a serious outbreak of plague in Constantinople, which caused a pause in Byzantine military operations. Constantine retired to Bithynia to avoid the disease and, after it had run its course, resettled people from mainland Greece and the Aegean islands in Constantinople to replace those who had perished.

In 751 he led an invasion into the new Abbasid Caliphate under As-Saffah. Constantine captured Theodosiopolis and Melitene, which he demolished, and again resettled some of the population in the Balkans. The eastern campaigns failed to secure concrete territorial gains, as there was no serious attempt to retain control of the captured cities, except Camachum (modern Kemah), which was garrisoned. However, under Constantine the Empire had gone on the offensive against the Arabs after over a century of largely defensive warfare. Constantine&#x27;s major goal in his eastern campaigns seems to have been to forcibly gather up local Christian populations from beyond his borders in order to resettle Thrace. Additionally, the deliberate depopulation of the region beyond the eastern borders created a no-man&#x27;s land where the concentration and provisioning of Arab armies was made more difficult. This in turn increased the security of Byzantine Anatolia. His military reputation was such that, in 757, the mere rumour of his presence caused an Arab army to retreat. In the same year he agreed a truce and an exchange of prisoners with the Arabs, freeing his army for offensive campaigning in the Balkans.

=== Events in Italy ===
With Constantine militarily occupied elsewhere, and the continuance of imperial influence in the West being given a low priority, the Lombard king Aistulf captured Ravenna in 755, ending over two centuries of Byzantine rule in central Italy. The lack of interest Constantine showed in Italian affairs had profound and lasting consequences. Pope Stephen II, seeking protection from the aggression of the Lombards, appealed in person to the Frankish king Pepin the Short. Pepin cowed Aistulf and restored Stephen to Rome at the head of an army. This began the Frankish involvement in Italy that eventually established Pepin&#x27;s son Charlemagne as Holy Roman Emperor, and also instigated papal temporal rule in Italy with the creation of the Papal States.

Constantine sent a number of unsuccessful embassies to the Lombards, Franks and the papacy to demand the restoration of Ravenna, but never attempted a military reconquest or intervention.

=== Repeated campaigns against the Bulgarians ===

The successes in the east made it possible to then pursue an aggressive policy in the Balkans. Constantine aimed to enhance the prosperity and defence of Thrace by the resettlement there of Christian populations transplanted from the east. This influx of settlers, allied to an active re-fortification of the border, caused concern to the Empire&#x27;s northern neighbour, Bulgaria, leading the two states to clash in 755. Kormisosh of Bulgaria raided as far as the Anastasian Wall (the outermost defence of the approaches to Constantinople) but was defeated in battle by Constantine, who inaugurated a series of nine successful campaigns against the Bulgarians in the next year, scoring a victory over Kormisosh&#x27;s successor Vinekh at Marcellae. In 759, Constantine was defeated in the Battle of the Rishki Pass, but the Bulgarians were not able to exploit their success.

Constantine campaigned against the Slav tribes of Thrace and Macedonia in 762, deporting some tribes to the Opsician theme in Anatolia, though some voluntarily requested relocation away from the troubled Bulgarian border region. A contemporary Byzantine source reported that 208,000 Slavs emigrated from Bulgarian controlled areas into Byzantine territory and were settled in Anatolia.

A year later he sailed to Anchialus with 800 ships carrying 9,600 cavalry and some infantry, gaining a victory over Khan Telets. Many Bulgar nobles were captured in the battle, and were later slaughtered outside the Golden Gate of Constantinople by the circus factions. Telets was assassinated in the aftermath of his defeat. In 765 the Byzantines again successfully invaded Bulgaria, during this campaign both Constantine&#x27;s candidate for the Bulgarian throne, Toktu, and his opponent, Pagan, were killed. Pagan was killed by his own slaves when he sought to evade his Bulgarian enemies by fleeing to Varna, where he wished to defect to the Emperor. The cumulative effect of Constantine&#x27;s repeated offensive campaigns and numerous victories caused considerable instability in Bulgaria, where six monarchs lost their crowns due to their failures in war against Byzantium.

In 775, the Bulgarian ruler Telerig contacted Constantine to ask for sanctuary, saying that he feared that he would have to flee Bulgaria. Telerig enquired as to whom he could trust within Bulgaria, and Constantine foolishly revealed the identities of his agents in the country. The named Byzantine agents were then promptly eliminated. In response, Constantine set out on a new campaign against the Bulgarians, during which he developed carbuncles on his legs. He died during his return journey to Constantinople, on 14 September 775. Though Constantine was unable to destroy the Bulgar state, or impose a lasting peace, he restored imperial prestige in the Balkans.

== Assessment and legacy ==

Constantine V was a highly capable ruler, continuing the reformsfiscal, administrative and militaryof his father. He was also a successful general, not only consolidating the empire&#x27;s borders, but actively campaigning beyond those borders, both east and west. At the end of his reign the empire had strong finances, a capable army that was proud of its successes and a church that appeared to be subservient to the political establishment.

In concentrating on the security of the empire&#x27;s core territories he tacitly abandoned some peripheral regions, notably in Italy, which were lost. However, the hostile reaction of the Roman Church and the Italian people to iconoclasm had probably doomed imperial influence in central Italy, regardless of any possible military intervention. Due to his espousal of iconoclasm Constantine was damned in the eyes of contemporary iconodule writers and subsequent generations of Orthodox historians. Typical of this demonisation are the descriptions of Constantine in the writings of Theophanes the Confessor: &quot;a monster athirst for blood&quot;, &quot;a ferocious beast&quot;, &quot;unclean and bloodstained magician taking pleasure in evoking demons&quot;, &quot;a precursor of Antichrist&quot;. However, to his army and people he was &quot;the victorious and prophetic Emperor&quot;. Following a disastrous defeat of the Byzantines by the Bulgarian Khan Krum in 811 at the Battle of Pliska, troops of the &quot;tagmata&quot; broke into Constantine&#x27;s tomb and implored the dead emperor to lead them once more. The life and actions of Constantine, if freed from the distortion caused by the adulation of his soldiers and the demonisation of iconodule writers, show that he was an effective administrator and gifted general, but he was also autocratic, uncompromising and sometimes needlessly harsh.

All surviving contemporary and later Byzantine histories covering the reign of Constantine were written by iconodules. As a result of this, they are open to suspicion of bias and inaccuracy, particularly when attributing motives to the Emperor, his supporters and opponents. This makes any claims of absolute certainty regarding Constantine&#x27;s policies and the extent of his repression of iconodules unreliable. In particular, a manuscript written in north-eastern Anatolia concerning miracles attributed to St. Theodore is one of few probably written during or just after the reign of Constantine to survive in its original form; it contains little of the extreme invective common to later iconodule writings. In contrast, the author indicates that iconodules had to make accommodations with imperial iconoclastic policies, and even bestows on Constantine V the conventional religious acclamations: &#x27;Guarded by God&#x27; () and &#x27;Christ-loving emperor&#x27; ().

<text>Eddie Santiago (born Eduardo Santiago Rodríguez, August 18, 1955) is a salsa singer from Puerto Rico. He is one of the great figures of this musical genre, with popular songs such as “Me Haces Falta Tú&quot; on Soy el Mismo, “Lluvia&quot; on Sigo Atrevido, “Mía&quot; on Invasión de la Privacidad y “Tú me quemas&quot; on Atrevido y diferente.

==Early years==
At a young age, Santiago demonstrated great love for salsa music. He performed with several groups, including Generación 2000, Orquesta La Potente, Orquesta Opus, and the Orquesta Saragüey.

==Musical career==
Santiago&#x27;s career took off in 1986 in Puerto Rico and the rest of Latin America as a soloist, forming his own band, and recording songs including: &quot;Tú me quemas&quot; (&quot;You Burn Me&quot;), &quot;Qué Locura Enamorarme de Ti&quot; (&quot;What Madness To Fall in Love With You&quot;), &quot;Me Fallaste&quot; (&quot;You Failed Me&quot;), Antidoto y Veneno (&quot;Antidote and Venom&quot;), &quot;Tu Me Haces Falta&quot; (&quot;I Miss You&quot;), his best known hit &quot;Lluvia&quot; (&quot;Rain&quot;, not to be confused with Menudo&#x27;s hit of the same name), and many others. His fame eventually spread to Europe and the United States, making him one of the most popular salsa singers in the late 1980s and early 1990s. He was one of the main singers of &quot;salsa romántica&quot; (&quot;romantic salsa&quot;).
His first major recording on an international label was with Sony Music in 1999. He also recorded for the TH, EMI Latin, and Polygram labels, including the well regarded production inspired by the music of Rafael Hernández, entitled &quot;Enamorado&quot;.

In 1999, he released &quot;Celebration: Epic Duets&quot;. He was joined on that album by other stars in the Latin music scene, Víctor Manuelle, Huey Dunbar and Elvis Crespo. The album was named one of the best recordings of 1999 by the National Foundation for Popular Culture.

Santiago has earned both gold and platinum records, along with other awards.

==2004 to present==
In 2004, Eddie Santiago announced a return to commercial music, with his new CD, &quot;Despues del Silencio&quot; (&quot;After the Silence&quot;), a title that alludes to the long period since his previous CD was released.

He was nominated for the Salsa/Merengue Album of the Year in the 2006 Grammy Awards.

His song &quot;Black is Black&quot; was included on the &quot;Nacho Libre&quot; movie soundtrack.

<doc id="253035" wikidata="Q1113243" url="?curid=253035" title="Comair (United States)">
<text>Comair was a regional airline in the United States, a wholly owned subsidiary of Delta Air Lines, headquartered at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport in Boone County, Kentucky, United States. Operating under the brand name Delta Connection, Comair operated passenger services to destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas.

At the height of its operations in the 1990s and early 2000s, it was the world&#x27;s largest regional airline, and operated from 1977 until 2012.

==History==

The airline was established in March 1977, and started operations in April 1977. Patrick J. Sowers, Robert T. Tranter, David Mueller and his father Raymond founded the airline in Cincinnati. At the end of its first year of highly profitable operations, two of the company founders, Sowers and Tranter, abruptly resigned the day following the first annual meeting as a &quot;demand for immediate change&quot; after they had uncovered repeated unacceptable and unsafe operational practices by one of the other partners. Comair suffered a fatal crash the year following their departure. Comair began scheduled services to Akron/Canton, Cleveland, and Evansville with two Piper Navajo aircraft. Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante twin-engine turboprop commuter aircraft were added to Comair&#x27;s fleet in 1982.

=== Delta relationship and expansion ===

Under its parent Comair Holdings, it became a public company in July 1981. In 1984, Comair became a Delta Connection carrier with Delta Air Lines&#x27; establishment of a hub at Cincinnati/Northern Kentucky International Airport (CVG). 
That same year, Comair introduced its first international flights from Cincinnati to Toronto. Turboprop aircraft operated by Comair on Delta Connection code sharing flights serving the Cincinnati hub included the Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante, Embraer EMB-120 Brasilia, Saab 340, Short 330 and Swearingen Metro.

In July 1986 Delta Air Lines acquired 20% of Comair stock. The airline began operating a second hub at Orlando International Airport (MCO) during the late 1980s in support of the Delta hub at the airport. In 1992, Comair moved into Concourse C at CVG, as Delta Air Lines gradually continued to acquire more of the airlines stock. In 1993, Comair was the launch customer for the Canadair Regional Jet CRJ100 and would later operate the largest fleet in the world of this twin jet type. By 1999, Comair was the largest regional airline in the country worth over 2 billion, transporting 6 million passengers yearly to 83 destinations on 101 aircraft. That same year, in addition to shorter range flights from its Cincinnati and Orlando hubs, Comair as the Delta Connection was operating nonstop flights between Cincinnati and Nassau, Bahamas, nonstop between Cincinnati and Colorado Springs, nonstop between Boston and Myrtle Beach, nonstop between Boston and Montreal, and also nonstop between Tulsa and Las Vegas with the latter being the westernmost destination ever served by the airline. Delta Air Lines acquired full ownership on October 22, 1999 at a cost of over $2 billion.


=== 2000s ===
On March 26, 2001, Comair&#x27;s pilots went on strike. The strike cancelled the airline&#x27;s flights and grounded its fleet. The strike caused substantial disruption to Delta&#x27;s operations, grounding connections to 95 cities. A core issue was pilot salaries; pilots at regional airlines were paid substantially less than mainline carriers. The strike ended 89 days later, in June, after the pilots approved a contract that included pay raises.

Comair came to nationwide attention during winter 2004 when it canceled all of its flights on Saturday, December 25 and Sunday, December 26, stranding 30,000 people. The reason was a combination of record snow and a crew scheduling software flaw. On December 23 and 24, a record snowfall hit the Cincinnati area, forcing the airline to deplete its entire supply of deicing solution. With the area highways closed due to the blizzard, no additional deicing fluid could be delivered to the airport, and Comair was forced to cancel all flights beginning on Friday December 24. After receiving necessary supplies overnight, the airline began the process of startup when the computer system that handled flight crew assignments shut down. It had been designed with a hard coded limit of changes for a month, which were far exceeded due to the poor weather in the prior days. The software had been in the process of being phased out at the airline in favor of a new system with more capabilities.

Comair&#x27;s parent company Delta Air Lines filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy on September 14, 2005, bringing Comair into bankruptcy along with it. Comair announced that would cut costs by million dollars annually. These savings were achieved by aircraft, flight, and employee reductions.

In late 2006, Comair opened an additional crew base and hub at New York City&#x27;s JFK Airport. Comair had the lowest percentage of on-time flights of all major U.S. carriers during late 2006. This was the result of starting operations at JFK, a congested airport with poor staffing and an unfortunate terminal and aircraft ramp layout that severely dropped Comair&#x27;s ratings in the DOT listings. In 2008, Comair tied with American for the lowest on-time performance, with 70% of its flights arriving on-time.

During the course of 2007, Comair closed down its crew bases in Greensboro, North Carolina and Orlando, Florida.

On May 25, 2007, Delta announced that Comair would operate 14 stretched CRJ900 aircraft for Delta Connection. These aircraft were to replace 14 smaller CRJ100 aircraft in Comair&#x27;s fleet. Parent company Delta Air Lines replaced Comair&#x27;s service in these destinations with Atlantic Southeast Airlines, a subsidiary of SkyWest, Inc., and Chautauqua Airlines, a subsidiary of Republic Airways Holdings. In early 2008, Delta announced it was going to reduce its domestic capacity by 4-5%, in which Comair would reduce its 50-seat Canadair Regional Jet fleet by 8-14 aircraft. In March 2008, when the price of oil rose, Delta announced it would further reduce domestic capacity.

On February 10, 2009, Delta Connection announced that ground handling and gate service positions for Comair, Mesaba Airlines, and Compass Airlines would be transitioned to a new Delta Air Lines subsidiary. The interim name of the new company was Regional Handling Services until a new name was confirmed before September. Each airline maintained its own flying operations. Services including ticketing and baggage handling were to be handled by RHS beginning in the 3rd Quarter of 2009. There was to be a reduction in the workforce. The largest cut was to come from Comair which was to reduce its staffing by nearly half. A voluntary termination was introduced and involuntary cuts were possible later in the year as Delta mainline ground employees took over positions of Delta subsidiary ground employees that had been contracted to Comair and then Regional Elite Airline Services. 

=== 2010s ===

On September 1, 2010, Comair announced that it would reduce its fleet by eliminating all of its aging Bombardier CRJ100/200 aircraft, expecting to have retired them all sometime in 2012. Retirement would start in 2011. Also, it expected to operate a fleet of 44 aircraft, and planned to reduce its workforce. Layoffs were to begin after September 2010, furloughing the pilot group to around 500 pilots (down to a 1999 date of hire). The company&#x27;s fleet was to consist of only CRJ700 and CRJ900 aircraft.

In July 2012, Delta announced that it would be shutting down Comair. The last Comair flight flew from Jacksonville International Airport to Minneapolis/Saint Paul International Airport on September 29, 2012, ending more than three decades of operation.

==Destinations==
Comair operated passenger services to 83 destinations in the United States, Canada, Mexico and the Bahamas at its peak in 2005.

==Fleet==

Before its downsizing, Comair operated the largest number of Bombardier (formerly Canadair) regional jets of any airline with over 170 planes. At the time of closure, the Comair fleet consisted of just seven aircraft with an average age of 11.1 years, all of which were operated on Delta Connection services:

===Historical fleet===

==Headquarters==

Comair was headquartered in the Comair General Office Building on the grounds of Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport in unincorporated Boone County, Kentucky, United States, west of Erlanger, and south of Cincinnati, Ohio. As the airline ended operations, up to 30 employees were to remain working at the headquarters.

77 Comair Boulevard formerly served as the corporate headquarters of Comair. The building is on South Airfield Road. In 2010, after the airline began downsizing, it considered leaving the building and moving to another location near the airport. A spokesperson did not disclose how much office space the airline occupied; she said it was planning to reduce its space by 20 to 25 percent. In early 2011, Comair vacated the building. Amazon Air began leasing space in the building in 2018.

==Accidents==
*On October 8, 1979, Comair Flight 444 en route to Nashville, TN, a Piper PA-31 Navajo light aircraft, crashed shortly after takeoff from Cincinnati-Northern Kentucky International Airport. All eight people aboard were killed. The NTSB determined the probable cause of the accident was a partial loss of power immediately after liftoff. The pilot failed to take immediate corrective action, such as rejecting the takeoff or raising landing gear and flaps. Contributing factors were the pilot&#x27;s inexperience with multi-engine aircraft, a hurried departure, inadequate training, inexperienced company management, and ineffective FAA certification and surveillance of the operator.
*On November 8, 1990, a Comair Swearingen SA227-AC Metro III, registered as N445AC, was performing a flight test. Things went south when the pilots landed the aircraft with its landing gears up. All three occupants survived with no injuries but the airframe was a write-off.
*On January 9, 1997, Comair Flight 3272, an Embraer EMB 120 Brasilia, registered as N265CA, crashed while on approach into Detroit Metropolitan Wayne County Airport, killing all 29 people aboard.
*On March 19, 2001, Comair Flight 5054, an Embraer EMB 120RT Brasilia, registered as N266CA, sustained substantial damage after corkscrewing from 17000 feet due to icing. None out of the 28 on board were injured.
*On August 27, 2006, Comair Flight 5191, a Bombardier CRJ-100ER, crashed while taking off from Lexington&#x27;s Blue Grass Airport. 49 of the 50 on board, including all 47 passengers, were killed.

<doc id="253036" wikidata="Q6057965" url="?curid=253036" title="Mrs. Puff">
<text>Mrs. Penelope &quot;Poppy&quot; Puff is a fictional character in the Nickelodeon animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and all three films based on the franchise. Voiced by Mary Jo Catlett, Mrs. Puff debuted in the season one episode &quot;Boating School&quot; on August 7, 1999. Mrs. Puff was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He developed the character in response to a request from Nickelodeon that the show star a schoolteacher. Hillenburg did not want to portray SpongeBob as a school-age child, so Mrs. Puff was introduced as his driving instructor instead of an elementary school teacher.

Mrs. Puff is SpongeBob&#x27;s paranoid driving teacher and the owner of the town boating school, which is similar to a driver&#x27;s education facility. She would like nothing more than to pass SpongeBob, as he is her most dedicated student, but he routinely fails every driving test he takes. His failures often cause crashes that lead to mass destruction and endanger Mrs. Puff. While she tries her best to be friendly and patient with her students, Mrs. Puff finds SpongeBob&#x27;s unintentional recklessness exasperating and thus comes to somewhat resent him. SpongeBob&#x27;s actions even result in her having a criminal record, frequently getting in and out of jail or on parole in many episodes; she has been arrested nine times in the series. In later seasons, she is also portrayed as the girlfriend of Mr. Krabs, after previously kindling a romance in the season 2 episode &quot;Krusty Love&quot;.

The character has received a positive critical reception and has become well known in popular culture for her distinctive voice and temperamental personality. She was also a favorite of Hillenburg&#x27;s, as her creation led to the show getting green-lit while remaining true to the vision of both himself and Nickelodeon. Catlett received an Annie Award nomination in 2001 for her voice-over work as Mrs. Puff along with Tom Kenny as the title character, making them the first &quot;SpongeBob&quot; cast members to be nominated for an award. Mrs. Puff is featured regularly in a variety of merchandise, such as plush toys and video games, and has appeared at theme parks and in Toyota commercials.

==Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;==
Mrs. Puff is an anthropomorphic porcupine puffer, specifically a porcupinefish, who owns the underwater boating school that SpongeBob attends. Despite her efforts, she has been unsuccessful at teaching SpongeBob how to drive a boat. He is her most committed student, and knows the answer to every question on the oral exam, but panics every time he takes the driving part of her course. He often crashes her vehicles and causes town-wide destruction in the process. Mrs. Puff displays the pufferfish&#x27;s inflation defense mechanism when she is scared or when SpongeBob crashes, akin to a car&#x27;s airbag deploying.

Mrs. Puff&#x27;s friendliness toward other characters varies. She sympathizes with the short-tempered Squidward Tentacles, and considers him to be the prime example of an outstandingly good driver. Mrs. Puff also treats Patrick, who has attended her class multiple times, with respect despite his slow-wittedness. Of all the residents of Bikini Bottom, she is closest to SpongeBob. While she normally dreads having to drive with SpongeBob, she often acts as a motherly figure towards him.

A running gag in the series is Mrs. Puff&#x27;s extensive criminal record. As a result of SpongeBob&#x27;s reckless driving, he regularly lands Mrs. Puff in jail since she assumes responsibility for his actions. This gag is introduced in &quot;Hall Monitor&quot;, when Mrs. Puff is held responsible after SpongeBob inadvertently destroys Bikini Bottom. In &quot;Doing Time&quot;, SpongeBob and Patrick attempt to break her out of prison to no avail. It is revealed that she prefers prison to working as a teacher because she does not have to drive with SpongeBob. A few episodes also imply she has a dark past in which this criminal history extends beyond antics with SpongeBob; in &quot;No Free Rides&quot;, it is implied that Mrs. Puff once had to move to a new town and start a new school with a new name. In &quot;Lighthouse Louie&quot;, an old newspaper is very briefly seen which reads “DERANGED BOAT TEACHER MAKES GETAWAY: Distracts authorities with balloon animals” (referencing an otherwise non-sequitur moment in &quot;No Free Rides&quot; in which she makes a balloon animal before stealing SpongeBob’s newfound boat).

Mrs. Puff was married to another pufferfish named Mr. Puff in the past, but he was captured by humans and turned into a novelty lamp – SpongeBob tells Mr. Krabs that Mrs. Puff does not like to talk about the loss of her husband. Since then, she and Mr. Krabs have pursued a romantic relationship and gone on many dates together. As of the show&#x27;s tenth season, Mrs. Puff and Mr. Krabs had been dating on-and-off for sixteen years. Mr. Krabs&#x27; love for her is so strong that it can transcend his greed for money. She is one of only two characters, the other being his daughter Pearl, that he cares for more than his riches. He gives her a variety of in the series and in spin-off media. In his review of the third season, Bryan Pope of &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; examined the two characters&#x27; relationship and mistook Mrs. Puff for Krabs&#x27; wife.

==Character==
===Creation and design===

Mrs. Puff was conceived and designed by series creator Stephen Hillenburg. She was the last of the main &quot;SpongeBob&quot; characters to be designed, since she was not conceptualized until after Hillenburg had already completed the show bible. The June 2003 issue of &quot;Nickelodeon Magazine&quot; states that when Hillenburg pitched &quot;SpongeBob&quot; to Nickelodeon, he &quot;had yet to come up with the idea that Mrs. Puff and SpongeBob would be on an endless quest to get SpongeBob a driver&#x27;s license&quot;. Thus, some early development artwork for the show depicted SpongeBob driving submarine-esque vehicles with ease.

Mrs. Puff&#x27;s development was sparked by Nickelodeon&#x27;s request for SpongeBob to attend a school. Nickelodeon executives originally wanted to make SpongeBob a child since their most successful cartoons at the time focused on young, school-age characters. Hillenburg said that the network wanted SpongeBob to be like &quot;Arnold [from &quot;Hey Arnold!&quot;] under the sea,&quot; but he told them, &quot;No, that&#x27;s not the show.&quot; As a compromise, Hillenburg decided to &quot;put him in school - but it would be a [boat] driving school.&quot; This allowed him to keep writing SpongeBob as an adult while also using the school as a main plot element. Showrunner Vincent Waller suggested that if the network had creative control over the show, almost every episode would take place at Mrs. Puff&#x27;s school, not at a variety of locations. The choice to make Mrs. Puff a pufferfish, who inflates into a ball when SpongeBob crashes, was made to evoke the appearance of car airbags. Because she was created late in production, her design incorporates elements of the earlier characters&#x27; appearances, such as the same type of skirt as Pearl and the same rounded teeth as Squidward.

The episode &quot;Doing Time&quot; was one of the first to be written specifically from Mrs. Puff&#x27;s point of view; another early example was season two&#x27;s &quot;No Free Rides.&quot; In his 2013 book &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Experience&quot;, animation historian Jerry Beck argued that the former was the episode that &quot;elevated Mrs. Puff to star status&quot;.

===Voice===
Mrs. Puff is voiced by American actress Mary Jo Catlett, who is known for her live-action roles on television programs from the 1970s such as &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. As of 2017, voicing Mrs. Puff is Catlett&#x27;s only regular television role. Catlett described herself as &quot;basically retired&quot; in 2013, since she is good friends with the other &quot;SpongeBob&quot; cast members, making the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; recording booth an easy environment that requires less preparation than in-person performances. The About Group&#x27;s Nancy Basille noted in 2016 that Catlett&#x27;s &quot;rich, low tones as teacher Mrs. Puff recall other roles she has had,&quot; citing &quot;Diff&#x27;rent Strokes&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; as programs where she used a similar voice.

==Reception==

The character has received positive reactions from critics and fans. &quot;Yahoo! News&quot; called Mrs. Puff &quot;the most famous driving teacher on the planet.&quot; Fashion designer Peter Jensen, who designed a line of sweatshirts inspired by &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, called Mrs. Puff his &quot;absolute favorite&quot; character in an interview with &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot;. In 2004, &quot;New York Times&quot; chief film critic A. O. Scott named Mrs. Puff as one of his favorite characters on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, along with Squidward Tentacles and Sandy Cheeks. Mrs. Puff was ranked second on &quot;Chilango&quot;″s list of favorite cartoon teachers. KSL-TV listed Mrs. Puff in their countdown of &quot;13 teachers from pop culture you can&#x27;t help but love&quot;. Andrew Whalen of IBT Media called Mrs. Puff&#x27;s role in the &quot;Doing Time&quot; episode &quot;a series highlight&quot;. The &quot;Pittsburgh Post-Gazette&quot; reported in 2002 that episodes about Mrs. Puff&#x27;s Boating School were fan favorites. Scott Lecter of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; said that Mrs. Puff, Sandy and Squidward &quot;make for some of the biggest laughs in the episodes&quot;.

Francis Rizzo of &quot;DVD Talk&quot; called Mrs. Puff&#x27;s voice &quot;spot-on&quot; thanks to &quot;the perfectly cast Mary Jo Catlett&quot;. Catlett&#x27;s voice-over work as Mrs. Puff was nominated for a 2001 Annie Award in the category Outstanding Individual Achievement for Voice Acting by a Female Performer in an Animated Television Production. Tom Kenny was nominated at the same ceremony for voicing SpongeBob, making them the first actors to earn an award nomination for their work on the show. Catlett and some other main cast members were also nominated for Best Vocal Ensemble at the 2013 Behind the Voice Actors Awards.

During the controversy surrounding SpongeBob&#x27;s sexuality, Mrs. Puff&#x27;s name began to be criticized for supposedly referring to the slang term &quot;puff,&quot; a descriptor of gay men that can be derogatory or affectionate. The BBC first noted this in reports of the controversy in 2002 and again in 2004. In a 2005 issue of the &quot;Sarasota Herald-Tribune&quot;, columnist David Grimes challenged this interpretation, writing, &quot;I do not consider [Mrs. Puff&#x27;s name] damaging evidence. However, if SpongeBob were receiving lessons from &quot;Mr.&quot; Puff, that would be an entirely different matter.&quot; K. Sobschak of the &quot;St. Catharines Standard&quot; also denounced the debate, asking, &quot;What is wrong with taking boating lessons from a fish? This is a comedy for kids.&quot; The National Expert Commission of Ukraine on the Protection of Public Morality revived the criticism of Mrs. Puff&#x27;s name in 2012, citing it as one of the reasons for an attempted nationwide ban of the program. &quot;Mediaite&quot; Editor-in-Chief Andrew Kirell questioned this decision, asking rhetorically, &quot;What&#x27;s so offensive there? Well, &#x27;puff&#x27; is a term often used to describe a gay man, as if Ukrainian children knew that.&quot;

Mrs. Puff&#x27;s quotes and voice have also become popular with fans and casual viewers. &quot;The Sun&quot; writer Esther Cepeda humorously referred to Mrs. Puff&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Oh, SpongeBob!&quot; as &quot;immortal words&quot; in a 2011 article. Her quote &quot;Oh, Neptune&quot; became part of an Internet meme in 2016. Various memes covered by the comedy websites Smosh and BuzzFeed have featured other quotes from the character. In an interview with &quot;San Diego Gay &amp; Lesbian News&quot;, the cast of &quot;Surprise Surprise&quot; (which starred Catlett) mentioned that &quot;not one cast or crew person on the movie let a day [on the set] go by without calling some relative ... and handing their cell phones to Mary Jo [Catlett] to do her best &#x27;Oh noooooooo, SpongeBob, nooooooooooo!&#x27;&quot;

==In other media==

Mrs. Puff has appeared in many types of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; merchandise, including action figures, aquarium ornaments, and video games. Tie-in books have prominently featured the character. Board games based on the show, such as &quot;The Game of Life&quot; and &quot;Bikini Bottom Book of Games&quot;, use her schoolhouse as a playing location. In 2007, a Lego construction set based on Mrs. Puff&#x27;s school was released. &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s Boating Bash&quot;, a 2010 racing video game, centers on Mrs. Puff and takes place at the boating school. Mrs. Puff is a playable character in the Wii version, and acts as a guide for the player in the Nintendo DS game.

Theme parks and events have featured Mrs. Puff, often as a costumed character. She was included on a boating school float as part of Sea World Australia&#x27;s SpongeBob ParadePants parade, which opened in December 2011. She appeared at Universal Studios Hollywood&#x27;s &quot;SpongeBob Fan Shellabration&quot; in 2013, and at the 2015 SpongeBob SquarePants 400 in Kansas City. Mrs. Puff also made regular appearances at Nickelodeon Suites Resort and Nickelodeon Universe with Mr. Krabs. A section of the SpongeBob StorePants souvenir shop at the Universal Orlando Resort is modeled after Mrs. Puff&#x27;s boating school.

In 2011, Mary Jo Catlett provided the voice-over for a road traffic safety commercial hosted by Mrs. Puff. It was produced by Nickelodeon and Toyota as the first in a series of &quot;SpongeBob&quot; advertisements from the two companies. The 30-second infomercial incorporated clips from the fifth-season episode &quot;Boat Smarts&quot; along with new content. Catlett also sings a track as Mrs. Puff on &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot; album, titled &quot;Mrs. Puff&#x27;s Boating School Ad&quot;. It was released on September 12, 2006, by Nick Records. Rita Engelmann, who voices Mrs. Puff in the German dub of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;, recorded a single as her character titled &quot;Hinterher! (feat. Mrs. Puff)&quot;. The song is a parody of Icona Pop&#x27;s &quot;I Love It&quot; and was released in 2014 by Sony Music Entertainment. Mrs. Puff is mentioned in the book &quot;Shingaling&quot;, a 2015 sequel to &quot;Wonder&quot;.

Mrs. Puff plays a small role in the 2004 film &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; and its 2015 sequel. Her lack of screen time in both movies was criticized. Jessica Walsh of the &quot;Reading Eagle&quot; felt that the first film was &quot;missing something, since key characters, such as Sandy the Squirrel and Mrs. Puff, make only cameo appearances&quot;. Sandie Chen of Common Sense Media wrote that the decision to relegate characters like Mrs. Puff to small roles &quot;won&#x27;t go over well with some fans&quot;. About.com&#x27;s Nancy Basille considered this the first movie&#x27;s biggest flaw and asked, &quot;why didn&#x27;t they use more of Squidward, Mr. Krabs, Gary, Mrs. Puff and all our other favorite secondary characters?&quot; The novelization of the 2004 movie includes additional scenes starring Mrs. Puff and Squidward that were not in the motion picture. Mrs. Puff appears in the 2009 stage adaptation of &quot;The Sponge Who Could Fly&quot;, which debuted at the Liverpool Empire Theatre. The 2016 musical based on the series stars Abby C. Smith as Mrs. Puff.

SpongeBob&#x27;s inability to pass Mrs. Puff&#x27;s course has been referenced in popular culture. In 2011, ice hockey player Taylor Hall failed his driving test and likened it to SpongeBob&#x27;s situation at Mrs. Puff&#x27;s school. The writers of Engadget compared a remote-controlled, underwater camera to the boats in &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, remarking that Mrs. Puff should call her insurance agent if users channel their &quot;inner SpongeBob while remotely driving the thing&quot;. In a satirical 2011 article, writers at &quot;The Washington Post&quot; pretended to interview SpongeBob about his trouble graduating from Mrs. Puff&#x27;s boating school.

<doc id="253038" wikidata="Q13690" url="?curid=253038" title="Northern Mindanao">
<text>Northern Mindanao (; Maranao: &quot;Pangotaraan Mindanao&quot;; ) is an administrative region in the Philippines, designated as Region X. It comprises five provinces: Bukidnon, Camiguin, Misamis Occidental, Misamis Oriental, and Lanao del Norte, and two cities classified as &quot;highly urbanized&quot;, all occupying the north-central part of Mindanao island, and the island-province of Camiguin. The regional center and largest city is Cagayan de Oro. Lanao del Norte was transferred to Northern Mindanao from Region XII (then called &quot;Central Mindanao&quot;) by virtue of &quot;Executive Order No. 36&quot; in September 2001.

==Etymology==
The current name of the region was derived from its position on Mindanao island. The term was officially coined by the Americans after the establishment of American colonial rule in the Philippines due to the defeat of Filipino revolutionaries. There have been proposals to rename the current Northern Mindanao region, which is dominated by the Cebuano ethnic group, into the &quot;Amihanan&quot; region. &quot;Amihanan&quot; literally translates to &#x27;northern area&#x27; from the Cebuano language, which is the lingua franca of the region.

==Geography==

Northern Mindanao has a total land area of . More than 60% of Northern Mindanao&#x27;s total land area are classified as forest land. Its seas abound with fish and other marine products. The abundant vegetation, natural springs and high elevation contribute to the region&#x27;s cool, mild and invigorating climate.

===Administrative divisions===

The region is composed of five provinces: Bukidnon, the island province of Camiguin, Lanao del Norte, Misamis Occidental and Misamis Oriental. It has two &quot;highly urbanized&quot; cities, Cagayan de Oro and Iligan, that are administered independently from any province. The provinces are further subdivided into seven component cities and 84 municipalities, with a total of 2,022 barangays. The regional center is Cagayan de Oro.

==Demographics==
Northern Mindanao is the 8th most populous region in the Philippines and 2nd in Mindanao (after Davao Region) according to the 2015 Philippine Statistics Authority Census. The major urban area of Region X is Metro Cagayan de Oro which includes Cagayan de Oro and some municipalities and cities of Misamis Oriental and Bukidnon.

The vast majority of the region&#x27;s inhabitants descended from migrants from Cebu, Bohol, Siquijor and Negros Oriental. Some other inhabitants are of Bicolano, Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Ivatan, Kapampangan, Pangasinan, Tagalog, Waray, Zamboangueño, Maguindanaon, Maranao and Tausug descent, while the autochthonous Bukidnons and Manobos populate the inner highlands.

The largest religion is Christianity, with Roman Catholicism forming 72% of the population and Protestants forming a significant minority of 14%. The second largest religion is Islam, forming 8% of the population.

The main language spoken in the region is Cebuano which is spoken with Northern Mindanao variant that is slightly different from standard Cebuano. The region is also home to sizeable speakers of Bohol dialect of Cebuano. Higaonon, Manobo and Binukid are among the languages native in the region, as are Maguindanaon and Maranao. Also spoken varyingly in the region are Hiligaynon, Ilocano, Ivatan, Kapampangan and Waray. Tagalog (Filipino) and English are widely understood and often used for administrative functions by the local government, business and in education.
==Economy==
The economy of Northern Mindanao is the second largest regional economy in the island of Mindanao. While still a mainly agricultural region, there is also a booming growth of industries particularly in Cagayan de Oro and in Iligan. Del Monte Philippines is located in the province of Bukidnon and its processing plant is located in Cagayan de Oro, where it ships its products to the rest of the Philippines and Asia-Pacific region. The Agus-IV to VII Hydroelectric Plants in Iligan and Balo-i, Lanao del Norte supply most of its electrical power in Mindanao.

<doc id="253039" wikidata="Q1189756" url="?curid=253039" title="Sandy Cheeks">
<text>Sandy Cheeks is a fictional character in the American animated comedy television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; and the Nickelodeon franchise of the same name. She is voiced by Carolyn Lawrence and first appeared in the episode &quot;Tea at the Treedome&quot;, which premiered on May 1, 1999. She was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg who is also the creator of the series. Sandy is portrayed as an intelligent anthropomorphic flying squirrel who wears an astronaut-like diving suit and lives underwater.

The character&#x27;s reception from fans has been positive. Sandy has appeared in many &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; publications, toys, and other merchandise. She also appears in the series&#x27; three films.

==Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;==
Sandy is a close friend of SpongeBob SquarePants. She is a proud Texan and speaks in a stereotypical Southern drawl. In order to live underwater, Sandy resides in a bubble-like dome and wears an atmospheric diving suit when outside her house. Inside the treedome, her normal attire consists of a green and purple bikini. Conversely, as revealed in &quot;Tea at the Treedome&quot;, other characters must wear &quot;water helmets&quot; with opposite functionality when visiting her house. Sandy possesses extraordinary scientific skills such as the ability to construct complex inventions. Sandy is shown to possess a number of tough, tomboyish character traits and interests; she is skilled at karate, engages in bodybuilding, and is a rodeo champion. She is also a close friend of Patrick Star, SpongeBob&#x27;s best friend and neighbor, though she sometimes gets annoyed by him like Squidward.

==History and development==
===Creation and design===
Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an ocean education organization, where he had the idea to create a comic book titled &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, which led to the creation of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation.

A few years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, at an animation festival. Murray offered Hillenburg a job as a director of the series. Martin Olson, one of the writers for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, read &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot; and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not considered creating his own series, but soon realized that this was his chance. Shortly after production on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. Sandy has been shown in the episodes about her being in the tree dome. Whenever any aquatic creatures enter her home, they must wear helmets that are filled with water. Sandy works as a scientist, explorer, and inventor. She is also a rodeo champion with a number of athletic interests, such as &quot;sand-boarding&quot; and karate. Originally, in the pitch bible written by Tim Hill and Hillenburg, SpongeBob originally was a romantic interest for her, but this was quickly put out of the show.

===Voice===

The voice of Sandy Cheeks is provided by Carolyn Lawrence. Lawrence got the role of Sandy when she was in Los Angeles at Los Feliz. She met Donna Grillo, a casting director, on a sidewalk. Lawrence was with a friend who knew Grillo, and she said Lawrence had an interesting voice. Grillo brought Lawrence in to audition and she got the part.

Before a recording, Lawrence prepares when the crew sends a storyboard. She explains, &quot;I absolutely love that! Not only do I get to read the script, I can actually see what the artists have in mind. It is an amazing process and I feel so fortunate to be able to work that way! [...] I would prefer to let the script come alive in me before a taping.&quot;

Presley Williams voiced young Sandy in &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot;.

==Reception==
Film critic A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, in his review of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, that Sandy is one of his favorite characters on the show, along with Squidward Tentacles and Mrs. Puff. He wrote, &quot;I was sorry to see [them] pushed to the margins&quot;.

==In other media==
Sandy has been included in various &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;-related merchandise, including board games, books, plush toys, and trading cards. She is also a playable character in several SpongeBob games like &quot;Battle for Bikini Bottom&quot;. Sandy also appears as a playable character in &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl&quot;. The Sandy&#x27;s Blasting Bronco rollercoaster opened alongside the American Dream Mall&#x27;s Nickelodeon Universe theme park in 2019. This ride is the first attraction to be named and themed after the character. The ride-vehicle is themed to Sandy&#x27;s rocketship, from the SpongeBob SquarePants episode &quot;Sandy&#x27;s Rocket.&quot;

Sandy served as sideline reporter for Nickelodeon&#x27;s alternate telecast of Super Bowl LVIII.

=== &quot;Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie&quot; ===

A CGI/Live-action hybrid movie starring Sandy titled &quot;Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie&quot; was released on Netflix on August 2, 2024. This film is one of three character-centric SpongeBob movies in development for the streaming platform. The film was initially announced in May 2021, and its title was revealed on November 26, 2022.

<doc id="253042" wikidata="Q6824803" url="?curid=253042" title="Metrobius">
<text>Metrobius (; lived 1st century BC) was an actor and a talented singer, in the Roman Republic. He was said to be the lover of Lucius Cornelius Sulla Felix, the famed general and dictator. Metrobius is mentioned twice by Plutarch in his &quot;Parallel Lives&quot;, who clearly disapproves of his relationship with Sulla. These excerpts are as follows.

&quot;It was this laxity, as it seems, which produced in him [Sulla] a diseased propensity to amorous indulgence and an unrestrained voluptuousness, from which he did not refrain even in his old age, but continued his youthful love for Metrobius, an actor.&quot;

&quot;However, even though he [Sulla] had such a wife at home, he consorted with actresses, harpists, and theatrical people, drinking with them on couches all day long. For these were the men who had most influence with him now: Roscius the comedian, Sorex the archmime, and Metrobius the impersonator of women, for whom, though past his prime, he continued up to the last to be passionately fond, and made no denial of it.&quot;

Though Sulla took other partners during his career, by Plutarch&#x27;s account he remained in love with Metrobius until the end of his life.

==In fiction==
In the historical fiction series &quot;Masters of Rome&quot;, by Colleen McCullough, the adolescent Metrobius is Sulla&#x27;s sometime lover and later his client. He gives up the stage to accompany the former dictator Sulla into retirement in the year 79 BC.

In Raffaello Giovagnoli&#x27;s novel &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1874) an actor named Metrobius accidentally overhears a conversation concerning a gladiator&#x27;s plot and informs Julius Caesar about it.

<doc id="253043" wikidata="Q1064404" url="?curid=253043" title="Squidward Tentacles">
<text>Squidward J. Q. Tentacles (, ) is a fictional character voiced by actor Rodger Bumpass in the American animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants,&quot; produced by Nickelodeon&quot;.&quot; Squidward was created and designed by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg. He first appeared on television in the series&#x27; pilot episode &quot;Help Wanted&quot; on May 1, 1999.

Although his name has the word &quot;squid&quot; in it and he has only six tentacles, Squidward is an anthropomorphic octopus. He lives in a moai themed house between SpongeBob SquarePants&#x27; and Patrick Star&#x27;s houses on Conch Street in Bikini Bottom. The character is portrayed as short-tempered, impatient, arrogant, sassy, introverted, condescending, bitter, and misanthropic, and he despises his two neighbors&#x27; constant disruptive antics. However, the pair are unaware of Squidward&#x27;s dislike towards them and see him as a friend. Squidward works as a cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant, a job which he does not enjoy.

He also appears in the films &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot; (2004), &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; (2015), &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; (2020), and &quot;Saving Bikini Bottom: The Sandy Cheeks Movie&quot; (2024). The character&#x27;s reception from fans has been positive. Squidward has appeared in many &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; publications, toys, and other merchandise.

== Development ==
=== Creation and design ===
Stephen Hillenburg first became fascinated with the ocean and began developing his artistic abilities as a child. During college, he majored in marine biology and minored in art. After graduating in 1984, he joined the Ocean Institute, an ocean education organization, where he had the idea to create a comic book titled &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot;, which led to the creation of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. In 1987, Hillenburg left the institute to pursue a career in animation.
Several years after studying experimental animation at the California Institute of the Arts, Hillenburg met Joe Murray, creator of &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, at an animation festival. Murray offered Hillenburg a job as a director of the series. Martin Olson, one of the writers for &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, read &quot;The Intertidal Zone&quot; and encouraged Hillenburg to create a television series with a similar concept. At that point, Hillenburg had not considered creating his own series, but soon realized that this was his chance. Shortly after production on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot; ended in 1996, Hillenburg began working on &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;.

Hillenburg used some character designs from his comic book. He designed &quot;SpongeBob&#x27;s grumpy next door neighbor&quot; as an octopus because he liked the species&#x27; large head; he said octopuses &quot;have such a large bulbous head, and Squidward thinks he&#x27;s an intellectual, so of course he&#x27;s gonna have a large bulbous head.&quot; Hillenburg explained that Squidward is normally drawn with six limbs because &quot;it was really just simpler for animation to draw him with six legs instead of eight&quot;. Squidward is only shown with a full set of eight tentacles in two episodes: the live-action sequence in &quot;Pressure&quot; from season two, and briefly in &quot;Sold!&quot; from season nine. Hillenburg named the character Squidward after the squid, which is closely related to the octopus and has ten limbs. In the words of Squidward&#x27;s voice actor Rodger Bumpass, the name Octoward &quot;just didn&#x27;t work&quot;.

Of Squidward&#x27;s design, show writer and storyboard artist Vincent Waller said in 2010: Squidward is hard to drawhe has a very odd-shaped head. Fortunately, his emotions are pretty even, but to get a whole lot of big emoting out of him is a challenge. His nose splits everything in half, so it&#x27;s always like, &#x27;OK, how am I going to work this and still make it read?&#x27;

Hillenburg thought of making jokes with Squidward ejecting ink but retired it because, according to him, &quot;it always looks like he&#x27;s pooping his pants&quot;. Despite this, inking jokes would appear in the episodes &quot;Giant Squidward&quot; and &quot;Ink Lemonade&quot;. The sound of Squidward&#x27;s footsteps, which evokes that of suction cups pulling on the ground, is produced by rubbing hot water bottles. The footsteps, and those of the rest of the main characters, are recorded by the show&#x27;s foley crew. Sound designer Jeff Hutchins said that footstep sounds &quot;[help] tell which character it is and what surface they&#x27;re stepping on&quot;. Bumpass inspired the idea of having Squidward ride a recumbent bicycle; Bumpass owns one of these bicycles, which he rides around Burbank, California. Bumpass described it as his &quot;little inside joke&quot;.

=== Voice ===

Squidward&#x27;s voice is provided by actor Rodger Bumpass, who voices several other &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; characters, including Squidward&#x27;s mother. While creating the show and writing its pilot episode in 1997, Hillenburg and the show&#x27;s then-creative director Derek Drymon were also conducting voice auditions. Mr. Lawrence, who had worked with Hillenburg and Drymon on &quot;Rocko&#x27;s Modern Life&quot;, was Hillenburg&#x27;s first choice for the role. Hillenburg had invited Lawrence to audition for all the show&#x27;s characters. Instead of Squidward, Hillenburg decided to give Lawrence the part of Plankton, the series&#x27; villain.

According to Bumpass, Squidward was &quot;a very nasally, monotone kind of guy&quot;. He said the character became interesting to perform because of &quot;his sarcasm, and then his frustration, and then his apoplexy, and so he became a wide spectrum of emotions&quot;. Tom Kenny, the voice of SpongeBob, describes Bumpass recording his lines in the studio, saying, &quot;I love watching Rodger ... He&#x27;s right next to me&quot;. According to Kenny, when Bumpass &quot;goes apoplectic&quot; as Squidward while recording, his head turns red, &quot;and you&#x27;re afraid he&#x27;s going to have an embolism&quot;.

Several of the show&#x27;s crew praise Bumpass for his performance and similitude to the character. Kenny called Bumpass &quot;brilliant&quot; and said, &quot;[he] is sort of like Squidward&quot;. Staff writer Kent Osborne said, &quot;I remember thinking about how much Rodger talks and acts like Squidward. That&#x27;s why it&#x27;s such a good voice—he&#x27;s so connected to it&quot;. However, Bumpass said, &quot;I&#x27;m not him and he&#x27;s not me, but what I&#x27;m required to do for him and what I am enabled to do for him is what makes it like me. It fits my particular talents and skills very well. So in that respect, yeah, he is me, but I am not the cranky, sarcastic, underachieving kind of guy that he is. He&#x27;s easy to fall in, I will say that.&quot;

Squidward&#x27;s voice has been compared to that of Jack Benny. Kenny said, &quot;To me, there&#x27;s something just so funny about that Jack-Benny-loyal-to-nobody character that Rodger Bumpass does such a great job of playing [...] Squidward&quot;. Arthur Brown, author of &quot;Everything I Need to Know, I Learned from Cartoons!&quot;, said that Squidward &quot;sounds a lot like Jack Benny&quot;. Bumpass repudiated the relationship, saying &quot;Jack Benny, no. Although he does have this observational sarcasm he occasionally brought out.&quot;

== Appearances ==
===Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;===

Squidward is depicted as a grumpy and bitter turquoise octopus. He lives in the underwater city of Bikini Bottom in a moai situated between SpongeBob SquarePants&#x27; pineapple house and Patrick Star&#x27;s rock. Squidward is annoyed by his neighbors for their perpetual laughter and boisterous behavior, though SpongeBob and Patrick are oblivious to being a nuisance to Squidward.

Squidward lives in a constant state of self-pity and misery; he is unhappy with his lifestyle and yearns for celebrity status, wealth, hair, and a glamorous and distinguished career as a musician or painter with a passion for art and playing the clarinet, although he has no actual talent for either. However, he is left to endure the lowly status as a fast-food cashier at the Krusty Krab restaurant. Squidward resents his job and is irritated by his greedy employer Mr. Krabs and by having his own resented neighbor SpongeBob as a colleague.

=== Other media ===
Alongside the television series, Squidward appears in the February 2011 issues of &quot;SpongeBob Comics&quot;. He also appears in various &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot; video games, and in various theme parks and theme park parades including Sea World and Universal&#x27;s Superstar Parade. He also appears in &quot;Nickelodeon All-Star Brawl 2&quot; (2023). In 2004, Squidward appeared in the first feature-length film adaptation of the show, &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, which was released on November 19, 2004, and was financially successful, grossing over worldwide. He also appears in the film&#x27;s sequels, &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot; which was released in theaters on February 6, 2015, and &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge on the Run&quot; which was released in the United States on Paramount+ streaming service on March 4, 2021 and in other territories on Netflix earlier on November 5, 2020. In 2019, he also appeared in Super Bowl LIII halftime show, which, during a triumphant song performed by tuna, they introduced rapper Travis Scott. Squidward has also been included in various &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;-related merchandise, including board games, phone case, sneakers and vans, books, plush toys, and trading cards.

The episode &quot;The Sponge Who Could Fly&quot; was adapted in 2009 as a stage musical at the Liverpool Empire Theatre, and later in South Africa. Actor Charles Brunton originated the role of Squidward, later recalling that he loved the character, and the &quot;fun [of] trying to re-create a well established cartoon character into a live performance on stage.&quot; Brunton prepared for the role by buying nine DVDs of the series, acting out Squidward&#x27;s part in each episode, in his bedroom. He said, &quot;it took ages to perfect the voice and the way he used his arms&quot;. Brunton&#x27;s performance and the musical were well received by most critics. A critic from &quot;The Public Reviews&quot; wrote, &quot;Charles Brunton as Squidward really stole the show for us, his character was nailed to perfection, from his comic acting, voice and mannerisms this was a faultless performance&quot;. In his review for &quot;The Northern Echo&quot;, Viv Hardwick said, &quot;Charles Brunton makes a convincing Squidward&quot;. The role was played by Chris van Rensburg in South Africa.

=== 2016 stage musical ===

A stage musical based on the show was premiered in June 2016 at the Oriental Theatre in Chicago. Squidward is portrayed using two extra legs to replicate Squidward&#x27;s four-legged design. Characterization-wise, Squidward is still portrayed as grumpy like in the series while being humanized as much as possible. Notable additions to Squidward&#x27;s character include him having a dead mother, whom he talks to several times during the musical.

In the musical, Bikini Bottom is threatened by a volcano that will erupt in two days, so the townspeople decide to hold a concert to raise money so they can evacuate. While he wants to perform on the concert himself, Squidward is instead assigned to manage the event while rock band the Electric Skates is asked to play. When the band arrives, Squidward wants to be their opening act, but he is rejected because he fails to get one of the items that the Electric Skates requests. The band calls Squidward a loser, causing him to snap, and he drives the band away. Squidward then insists that he is not a loser and performs a tap-dance number backed by a chorus line until he realizes it is just his imagination (&quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot;). Because the concert and the evacuation plan fail, the town falls into chaos until SpongeBob, Patrick, and Sandy arrive and tell them that they have used a device that should stop the eruption. After the volcano does not erupt at the supposed time, Squidward is allowed to perform in a concert to celebrate the town&#x27;s survival.

==== Original portrayal ====
Actor Gavin Lee originated the role of Squidward in the Chicago run and reprised the role in the musical&#x27;s Broadway run and television adaptation &quot;The SpongeBob Musical: Live on Stage!&quot;. As Lee was not familiar with the show prior to his audition, Lee binge-watched eight &quot;SpongeBob&quot; episodes and listened to Rodger Bumpass&#x27; voice. Director Tina Landau encouraged the actors to not be a &quot;carbon copy&quot; of the cartoon characters and make something different, allowing Lee to not exactly replicate Bumpass&#x27; voice, especially during emotional parts.

Lee liked how Squidward is the one grumpy character in an upbeat musical. Three times in the musical, Squidward is stopped from singing, so that when his number &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; is finally sung in Act 2, &quot;the audience is just gagging for Squidward to finally express himself&quot;, as Gavin Lee described. &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; features Squidward tap-dancing backed by a chorus line of sea anemones.

To play the four-legged Squidward, Lee wore two extra fake legs. Lee said that he wanted the fake legs to be secure and asymmetrical to his real legs, which made the legs uncomfortable to wear, but he likes them as a gimmick and how the audience reacted positively to them. Since Squidward tap-danced with four legs in &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot;, Lee and choreographer Chris Gattelli worked together to figure out how Lee would tap-dance with two extra tap shoes, as neither had tap-danced like that before. Lee said that in order to make four tap noises, he tap-danced in a more &quot;sloppy&quot; way: &quot;Having loose ankles, but also having the tension there to make the noises with the extra [taps].&quot; Squidward&#x27;s four-legged tap dance has been compared to Lee&#x27;s previous role as Bert in the &quot;Mary Poppins&quot; musical where he tap-danced upside-down.

Lee&#x27;s performance as Squidward and his tap dance number &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; are considered a highlight of the show. In his review of the Chicago run, Steven Oxman of &quot;Variety&quot; called Squidward the &quot;unquestionable highlight&quot; and described &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; as &quot;a dose of true Broadway pizzazz, and expresses the character&#x27;s inner self with sensitivity and flair.&quot; Reviewing the Broadway run, Alexis Soloski of &quot;The Guardian&quot; called Lee&#x27;s tap number &quot;rapturous&quot;, while Peter Marks on &quot;The Washington Post&quot; considers it &quot;a particular joy&quot;. &quot;Vice&quot;&#x27;s Jo Rosenthal considered Lee&#x27;s performance of &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; as &quot;heart-rending&quot; and &quot;earned his standing ovation&quot;. In addition to calling &quot;I&#x27;m Not a Loser&quot; the musical&#x27;s highlight, David Rooney of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; praised Squidward&#x27;s four-legs costume as well. In 2018, for his performance in the Broadway run, Gavin Lee won a Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and was nominated for a Tony Award for Best Featured Actor in a Musical.

==== Subsequent portrayals ====
In the 2019–20 North American tour of the musical, Squidward was played by Cody Cooley. Although he was skeptical about the idea of a &quot;SpongeBob&quot; musical at first, Cooley is impressed when he watched the Broadway run. When Cooley watched the Broadway run with his friends, they commented that Cooley would be fit for Squidward because Cooley was considered grouchy. Cooley himself said that he relate to Squidward&#x27;s pessimism and sarcastic personality. Cooley had applied twice for the role before being called for audition and given the role. After being cast, Cooley rewatched the first three seasons of &quot;SpongeBob&quot; to study Squidward&#x27;s character.

Cooley said that Squidward&#x27;s tap number is his favorite part of the show. Prior to getting the role, Cooley already had tap-dancing experience. During the rehearsal in New York City, Cooley learned how to tap with the two extra tap shoes and practiced it usually twice a day to build up stamina. Cooley considered stamina important for the tap number because the extra legs weighs 25 pounds, he must dance for at least seven minutes and the number ends with a kickline. He also learned how to play clarinet for the part where Squidward plays it at the end of the show.

In the 2023 United Kingdom tour, Squidward is played by Gareth Gates and Tom Read Wilson depending on the venue. Gates described Squidward as a very different person compared to him due to Squidward&#x27;s grumpiness, which is his stated reason for liking the role. Gates had not tap-danced prior to getting this role, so he had to learn to tap dance by taking three lessons before the rehearsals.

== Reception ==
The character of Squidward has received a positive reception from critics and fans alike. SpongeBob&#x27;s voice actor Tom Kenny named Squidward his favorite character on the show: &quot;He has an extra dimension where SpongeBob and Patrick&#x27;s capacity of play mystifies him, but he&#x27;s also jealous of it. When he tries to participate, he just fails utterly because he doesn&#x27;t believe in it.&quot; Staff writer Casey Alexander said, &quot;Squidward is the character I relate to the most. In an exaggerated way, he&#x27;s the most human character. If I knew a human like SpongeBob, I probably would react to him like Squidward does&quot;. American singer Pharrell Williams, who is a fan of the show, stated that &quot;Squidward is my favorite, though. If he was a human, I would hang out with him.&quot; Mahejabeen Hossain Nidhi of &quot;The Daily Star&quot; stated that &quot;we are all secretly Squidward&quot; due to his personality in the movie.

Bill Treadway of DVD Verdict said that Squidward is &quot;a cross between Bert [of &quot;Sesame Street&quot;], Woody Allen, and Roger Addison [of &quot;Mr. Ed&quot;] ... but he has some heart, if you can find it&quot;. Treadway called him &quot;the straight man for his neighbor&#x27;s antics&quot;. Film critic A. O. Scott of &quot;The New York Times&quot; said, in his review of &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, that Squidward is one of his favorite secondary characters on the show, along with Sandy Cheeks and Mrs. Puff. He wrote, &quot;I was sorry to see [them] pushed to the margins&quot;. Also from the same publication, television critic Joyce Millman said that Squidward has &quot;the nasal bitchiness of Paul Lynde and the artistic pretensions of Felix Unger.&quot; Millman further wrote, &quot;Hmmm, Squidward is one gay squid, I think.&quot;

&quot;Band Geeks&quot;, an episode of the series&#x27; second season that focuses on Squidward, is often considered by many critics and fans alike as the show&#x27;s best episode. Writing for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Michael Cavna ranked &quot;Band Geeks&quot; as the fifth best episode of &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. In his review, Cavna said, &quot;Squidward&#x27;s mix of artistic aspiration in the face of goading, humiliation and unrelenting sub-mediocrity made this a kids&#x27; episode that adults can experience on a whole &#x27;nother level.&quot; On a less positive note, Squidward was listed among Common Sense Media&#x27;s &quot;10 Worst TV Role Models of 2012&quot;; author Sierra Filucci wrote that Squidward&#x27;s selfishness is his &quot;worst offense&quot;, calling him &quot;the mean and nasty cashier at the Krusty Krab [who] is nice only when he wants something.&quot;

At the 39th Daytime Emmy Awards in 2012, Bumpass was nominated for his vocal performance as Squidward in the Outstanding Performer in the Animated Program categorythe first cast member to be nominated in this category. The award was won by June Foray of &quot;The Garfield Show&quot;. Bumpass has said he was proud of the certificate he received for the nomination, but &quot;there wasn&#x27;t really a competition because one of the other nominees was June Foray and she is royalty in the animation world ... There was no way any of the other three guys had a chance. In fact, if any of us had won, there would have been a riot in that studio .&quot; He said he was &quot;happy to lose to June Foray&quot; and &quot;very pleased and grateful to get a nomination&quot;.

<text>Pearl Krabs is a fictional character in the Nickelodeon animated television series &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;. She is voiced by actress Lori Alan and first appeared in the season one episode &quot;Squeaky Boots&quot; on September 17, 1999. She was created by marine biologist and animator Stephen Hillenburg, who was inspired to design a whale character while supervising whale watches at the Ocean Institute in Dana Point, California.

Pearl is a adolescent sperm whale who lives in a hollow anchor with her father Eugene &quot;Mr.&quot; Krabs, the greedy founder of the popular Krusty Krab restaurant. Pearl will inherit the restaurant and become its owner when she grows older. She is currently employed at the local shopping center, the Bikini Bottom Mall. The identity and whereabouts of Pearl&#x27;s unseen mother have never been explained directly by the characters. While supplemental materials indicate her father married a whale who gave birth to Pearl, Hillenburg was strongly against revealing this in an episode.

Critical reception for Pearl has been largely positive. Her depiction as the child of a single parent has been praised by critics as an example of &quot;SpongeBob&quot;″s ability to challenge social norms. She has been featured frequently in a variety of merchandise, such as plush toys and video games, and at amusement park attractions. She appears in the 2004 feature film &quot;The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie&quot;, the 2017 Broadway musical based on the series, in &quot;Kamp Koral: SpongeBob&#x27;s Under Years&quot; as an infant, and as a young child in &quot;The Patrick Star Show&quot;.

==Role in &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;==
Because she is a whale and most other characters are small tide pool organisms, Pearl is depicted as extraordinarily tall and heavy. Her size compared to the other characters is often used for visual gags; for example, she is able to shake the entire Krusty Krab when she jumps and can fill the entire building with tears when she cries. The floors of the Krabs&#x27; residence are equipped with drain plugs so the house can be emptied after Pearl cries or spouts water from her blowhole. Wherever she goes, she stomps loudly and causes the ground to shake slightly.

Mr. Krabs attempts to interest Pearl in working at the Krusty Krab—their family business—but she does not want to work there until she graduates from high school, believing it would deprive her of a social life. Despite this, she manages the Krusty Krab when Mr. Krabs cannot, and fills in for other employees when needed. Being a sperm whale, Pearl has the largest brain of any Bikini Bottom resident and is gifted in math. Mr. Krabs has tried to use this to his own advantage and wants Pearl to eventually become a bookkeeper for his restaurant.

Pearl&#x27;s favorite activities are socializing at the Bikini Bottom Mall and using her father&#x27;s credit card to buy anything that is totally &quot;coral&quot; (Bikini Bottom slang for &quot;cool&quot;). Mr. Krabs disapproves of Pearl&#x27;s prodigious spending, but nonetheless pays for her items to avoid disappointing his daughter. Pearl is employed as an assistant at Grandma&#x27;s Apron, a store for elderly residents on the ground floor of the shopping center. Beatrice, her boss at Grandma&#x27;s Apron, was voiced by actress Betty White.

=== Fictional origin ===
The disparity in species between Pearl and her father has never been explained directly in an episode, but merchandise makers and production crew members have stated that Mr. Krabs was once married to a whale who gave birth to Pearl. A trivia book penned by former &quot;SpongeBob&quot; writer David Fain in 2000 states that Pearl &quot;takes after her mother,&quot; implying that she is the biological offspring of Mr. Krabs and a whale. According to creative director Vincent Waller, Stephen Hillenburg received many letters requesting a Pearl origin story, but was still &quot;very much against solving [the] mystery&quot; of how she joined the Krabs family. A step outline for an episode focusing on her origin was written and started early development stages, but the episode has been shelved indefinitely because of Hillenburg&#x27;s disapproval.

Pearl&#x27;s name, and the decision to portray her as motherless, were an homage to the phrase &quot;mother-of-pearl&quot;, which refers to the inner layer of some sea-dwelling mollusk shells. Mr. Krabs uses this phrase when he is startled, in a similar vein to &quot;Mother of God&quot;, as a reference to the absence of Pearl&#x27;s mother. His use of the phrase only when he is dismayed or shocked has led some viewers to believe something tragic happened to Mrs. Krabs.

At Dragon Con in 2016, Lori Alan and Rodger Bumpass addressed Pearl&#x27;s origins as their characters Pearl and Squidward. In the skit, Squidward asks Pearl if she is adopted. Pearl does not give a definite response, instead saying that she gets emotional over the topic. Later at the same event, the actors discussed the disappearance of Pearl&#x27;s mother. Alan affirmed that Mrs. Krabs&#x27; whereabouts are secret, and Bumpass joked that she had been taken to an oceanarium, saying: &quot;Two words: Sea World.&quot;

==Character==
===Creation and design===

Pearl was one of the first five characters Stephen Hillenburg created for &quot;SpongeBob&quot;. Her conceptualization is rooted in Hillenburg&#x27;s tenure as a teacher at the Orange County Marine Institute in Dana Point, California. Screenwriter Allan Neuwirth describes the Marine Institute as Hillenburg&#x27;s &quot;first stop on the road to &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants&quot;,&quot; as it inspired the development of many of the series&#x27; characters; Hillenburg&#x27;s decision to include a whale character was influenced by his regular supervision of whale watches, and a cetacean skeleton exhibit at the institute. Hillenburg&#x27;s original sketch of Pearl in the show bible included flukes and pigtails, which were dropped from her final design. Mr. Krabs and Pearl had matching yellow and orange clothes initially, but they were given individualized colors before the production of the pilot episode.

Hillenburg made Pearl a different species from her father because he wanted each member of the main cast to be a different type of animal. When he was first developing the characters, Hillenburg wanted Pearl and Mr. Krabs to travel around town in a caravan boat with a whale-sized teardrop trailer connected to it; while this element did make it into the series, it was only used sparsely in season one. The decision to have Mr. Krabs and Pearl live in an anchor was made after production of the first season had begun. The original map of the show&#x27;s setting, which Hillenburg showed Nickelodeon executives as part of his pitch to the network in 1997, did not include an anchor house, and instead labeled the Krusty Krab as both characters&#x27; residence.

Hillenburg originally planned for Pearl and Mr. Krabs to be mostly separate characters, with specific episodes dedicated to each character individually. This happened in several early episodes, such as &quot;The Chaperone,&quot; but the writers found it more natural to include Mr. Krabs in Pearl-centric stories. Hillenburg considered this the biggest difference between the series and how he originally envisioned it. Animation historian Jerry Beck has stated that Pearl&#x27;s breakout role was in &quot;Bossy Boots,&quot; which he considers the episode that best established her as one of the series&#x27; stars.

===Voice===
Pearl&#x27;s voice is provided by American actress Lori Alan in the series, both feature films, and the associated video games. During her audition for the role, she was shown an early drawing of Pearl with the other main characters. She noted how Pearl was much larger than the rest of the cast, and decided to reflect the character&#x27;s size in her voice by making it deep and full in tone. She also aimed to make the voice invoke the sound of whales’ low vocalizations while also sounding &quot;spoiled and lovable&quot;. In an interview with AfterBuzz TV, Alan said that she knew Pearl &quot;had to sound somewhat like a child,&quot; but at the same time needed &quot;an abnormally large voice&quot;.

Pearl&#x27;s catchphrase &quot;Daddy!&quot; was developed early during production of the first season, but was not used in an episode until later on. A script that the main voice actors were reading from during a rehearsal had the line fully capitalized, with the first syllable extended (&quot;daaaaddy!&quot;), so Alan knew to put particular emphasis on the line when it was in a script. Rodger Bumpass, the voice of Squidward Tentacles, describes Alan&#x27;s portrayal of Pearl as a &quot;unique and wonderful take on how this teenager should be ... No one else has a teenager that sounds like Pearl.&quot;

==Reception==
===Critical response===
Pearl&#x27;s character has received popularity and critical acclaim. In a review of the first official trailer for &quot;The SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water&quot;, Victoria McNally of &quot;The Mary Sue&quot; said that Pearl was her favorite character, and she was disappointed not to see her in the movie&#x27;s preview. She writes, &quot;if they can manage to work Pearl into the plot somewhere, I&#x27;ll take back everything I&#x27;ve already said about this film. Maybe she could get beached on the shore, I don&#x27;t know. Pearl&#x27;s the best.&quot; Joseph Foy, author of the novel &quot;SpongeBob SquarePants and Philosophy&quot;, felt that it was difficult not to sympathize with Pearl&#x27;s situation since she believes she is &quot;more important to her father than money,&quot; but &quot;we, the viewing audience, know differently&quot;. &quot;DVD Talk&quot;″s Paul Mavis wrote in his review of &quot;Legends of Bikini Bottom&quot; that he found Pearl &quot;annoyingly funny&quot;. In 2013, José Antonio Gómez Marín of &quot;El Mundo&quot; said that he felt Pearl brings an easily recognizable youthful tone to the show.

Like Mr. Krabs, Pearl has also been considered a stereotyped character; Sharon Lamb and Lyn Mikel Brown wrote in their 2007 book &quot;Packaging Girlhood&quot; that Pearl exhibits the traits of an archetypal girly girl. A study by the federal office of gender equality in Mexico, El Instituto Nacional de las Mujeres, found that Pearl&#x27;s roles sometimes rely on characteristics associated with stereotypes of women, such as vanity and materialism.

In an article for &quot;Complex&quot;, Debbie Encalada praised the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; series for challenging social norms; the portrayal of the Krabses as a single-parent family was specifically highlighted as an example of the show&#x27;s &quot;subversiveness by subtly challenging the idea of the nuclear family&quot;. Psychologist Steve Harriman covers the Krabs family dynamic in the 2005 Berkley Book &quot;Absorbing SpongeBob&quot;. He calls attention to the lack of explanation for the disparity between Pearl and Mr. Krabs&#x27; species, noting that it is only after watching several episodes that viewers realize the Krabs family is broken. He also questions the decision to focus on Patrick&#x27;s family, rather than Pearl&#x27;s, in the only episode dealing &quot;head-on with a core pathology of family&quot;—&quot;I&#x27;m with Stupid&quot;. In his review of the third season, Bryan Pope of &quot;DVD Verdict&quot; called Mr. Krabs and Pearl (as well as Krabs&#x27; girlfriend Mrs. Puff, whom he mistook for the character&#x27;s wife) one of &quot;the most head-scratching family units [he had] ever come across&quot;.

===Fan theories===
The absence of Pearl&#x27;s mother has caused much speculation among viewers since the series&#x27; debut. Various fan theories about how Pearl became Mr. Krabs&#x27; daughter have become popular on the internet. Jon Negroni, creator of &quot;the Pixar Theory,&quot; theorized that Mr. Krabs&#x27; fear of fish hooks in the episode &quot;Hooky&quot; suggests a fish hook was involved in the death of Pearl&#x27;s mother, who was presumably a whale like Pearl.

==In other media==

Pearl has been featured in a variety of merchandise such as plush toys, video games, comics and trading cards. The Krabs family restaurant, the Krusty Krab, has been the basis for a Lego playset, and many replicas at attractions. A float modeled after the Krusty Krab, featuring a costumed mascot of Pearl that greeted guests and an animatronic Mr. Krabs, regularly appeared at Sea World&#x27;s weekly &quot;SpongeBob ParadePants&quot; parade. A full-size replica of the building was built in Ramallah, Palestine in 2014. In January 2016, Nickelodeon&#x27;s parent company Viacom filed a lawsuit against the operators of a similar for-profit &quot;Krusty Krab&quot; restaurant to be opened in Texas. A Texas federal judge ruled in January 2017 that the planned restaurant violated Viacom&#x27;s rights to the &quot;SpongeBob&quot; property, thus halting its construction.

In 2011, the indie rock group Yo La Tengo performed a live version of Mr. Krabs and Pearl&#x27;s commercial from the episode &quot;As Seen on TV&quot; at the El Rey Theatre in Los Angeles, California. Included as part of Yo La Tengo&#x27;s first tour, it starred Ira Kaplan as Mr. Krabs and Laura Krafft as Pearl. Billy Gil of &quot;L.A. Record&quot; praised the performance in his review. An episode of the sketch comedy series &quot;Robot Chicken&quot; titled &quot;Major League of Extraordinary Gentlemen&quot; includes a skit that stars Mr. Krabs and Pearl. The segment, animated in stop motion like most other sketches on the program, features Mr. Krabs using crab legs as the secret ingredient for Krabby Patties. Before he is exposed for serving cannibal meals, Pearl is shown unsuspectingly eating the patties. Several tracks on &quot;The Best Day Ever&quot;, a 2006 soundtrack album, feature the vocal performance of Lori Alan as Pearl. The segment &quot;Pearl Krabs aka Caller #5!&quot; is a skit between Pearl and a disc jockey voiced by radio personality Jerry Blavat.

===Broadway musical===
In the 2017 Broadway musical based on &quot;SpongeBob&quot;, which premiered at the Palace Theatre in New York City, Pearl is played by Jai&#x27;len Christine Li Josey. Her attire in the musical was inspired by her animated counterpart; it includes a cheerleading uniform, an Afro styled into the shape of Pearl&#x27;s whale head, and a pair of platform sneakers that replicate Pearl&#x27;s signature loud stomping from the cartoon. In the production, Mr. Krabs plans to make her the Krusty Krab&#x27;s new manager rather than SpongeBob. However, Pearl wants to become a rock band singer instead and is troubled by her father&#x27;s disregard for her own hopes and dreams. She sings a duet with Mr. Krabs titled &quot;Daddy Knows Best,&quot; an original composition written by Alex Ebert that highlights the two characters&#x27; differences.

Josey&#x27;s performance as Pearl has been critically lauded, with some reviewers highlighting her as the breakout star of the musical. &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; named Josey one of the eight best Broadway debuts of 2017, writing that none of the musical&#x27;s other debuts &quot;were more impressive than Josey, who at 18, quite literally stormed the stage as the teenage sperm whale Pearl Krabs. Her looming presence was only matched by her stunning vocal performance.&quot; Josh Ferri of BroadwayBox.com included Pearl&#x27;s &quot;Daddy Knows Best&quot; on a list of his 15 favorite Broadway songs of 2017, calling it &quot;a rare star is born moment...this is for [Josey] what &#x27;Miss Marmelstein&#x27; was for young Streisand.&quot; Jo Rosenthal of &quot;Vice&quot; wrote that &quot;Josey nearly stole the entire show as Pearl, her voice eliciting roars of joy from the audience as she lamented the greed of her dad, Mr. Krabs.&quot; Casey Curtis of the &quot;New York Theatre Guide&quot; said that Josey&#x27;s voice &quot;was so beautifully strong and clear that it made me get misty-eyed.&quot; Vulture.com&#x27;s Sara Holdren said, &quot;Definitely try not to say &#x27;daaamn&#x27; under your breath [during] &#x27;Daddy Knows Best.&#x27; This whale can wail.&quot; Isabella Biedenharn of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; called Josey&#x27;s Pearl a &quot;vocal powerhouse&quot; and Siddhant Adlakha of &quot;Birth.Movies.Death.&quot; said that &quot;every solo she gets is a moment to behold.&quot; Audience reception was similarly positive; in an analysis of reviews from children who attended the musical, &quot;Newsday&quot; reported that Pearl&#x27;s character was &quot;a part of the show that everyone seemed to enjoy&quot; and that Josey&#x27;s vocal performance &quot;was an outstanding addition.&quot;

<doc id="253047" wikidata="Q590129" url="?curid=253047" title="Mobile Suit Victory Gundam">
<text>, is a 1993 Japanese science fiction anime television series. It consists of 51 episodes, and was directed by Gundam creator Yoshiyuki Tomino. The series was first broadcast on TV Asahi (and its ANN stations). It is the fourth TV anime installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, first series in the franchise released in Japan&#x27;s Heisei period, and the final full series to be set in the Universal Century calendar until Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX.

==Plot==
&quot;Victory Gundam&quot; is set in UC 0153, and succeeds the Federation Force and Crossbone Vanguard conflict of &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam F91&quot;. The Earth, still loosely controlled by the greatly weakened Earth Federation, comes under attack by BESPA, the armed forces of the space colony–based Zanscare Empire. Only a ragtag resistance movement, the League Militaire, stands in BESPA&#x27;s way as they swiftly conquer much of space and start their invasion of Earth, with the advanced mass-produced mobile suit, the Victory Gundam, as the League Militaire&#x27;s secret weapon. However, BESPA&#x27;s power continues to grow, using violent means, including public executions with guillotines, to strike fear into those living on Earth.

Living peacefully on Earth in the remote Eastern European town of Kasarelia, 13-year-old Üso Ewin and his childhood friend Shahkti Kareen are soon thrown into the conflict when they encounter ace BESPA pilot Chronicle Asher. Soon, Üso finds himself joining forces with Marbet Fingerhut and the rest of the League Militaire, piloting the Victory Gundam against BESPA, and soon discovering the horrors of war.

==Production==
===Development===

&quot;Victory Gundam&quot; is the fourth &quot;Gundam&quot; television series and the first of four &quot;Gundam&quot; television series that aired on TV Asahi and its sister ANN stations in Japan sequentially from 1993 through 1996. In order to attract the younger elementary school age demographic that &quot;SD Gundam&quot; was popular with at the time, the show featured the youngest protagonist in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, the thirteen-year-old Uso Ewin, and established a setting within Universal Century that was largely independent of previous &quot;Gundam&quot; works. Unlike previous &quot;Gundam&quot; series that started off in space colonies, the show starts off in Eastern Europe before moving to space 15 episodes later. The intent of this was for Tomino to dispel the association between &quot;Gundam&quot; and space. Nonetheless, the mature themes of the show, as well as the high casualty rate of the main cast, meant that the show would instead attract an older crowd, the young adults who had seen &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam ZZ&quot; a decade earlier.

The show was nonetheless able to more than double the sales of &quot;real&quot; Gundam models, which had been greatly lagging behind &quot;SD Gundam&quot; model sales. As &quot;SD Gundam&quot; model sales had been in a decline, Bandai&#x27;s &quot;Gundam&quot; toy sales ultimately increased as a result of the show, but still missed its targets of 10 million units sold. This compounded with the fact that the show had failed to attract its target audience led to a cancellation of Sunrise&#x27;s next Gundam series, which was under production at the time and was to be a war story featuring a conflict between Earth and Mars colonists, with a working title of . Instead, Sunrise would go on to create &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;.

The Bandai acquisition of Sunrise was also in the planning stages during &quot;Victory Gundam&quot;s development, with the former looking to address the declining popularity of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, which was a main source of revenue for them. Years later, Tomino would lament the fact that he had started production of this series not aware of that situation, which caused a rift between the director and Sunrise for many years.

===Release===
The entire series was released on DVD in Japan on January 23, 2004. The limited-edition DVD box release was notable for containing an interview of Tomino titled, . Tomino has also made a similar comment on a &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot; DVD interview.

Years after the show was first broadcast in Japan, the show aired on the anime satellite television network, Animax, in Japan and later its respective networks worldwide, including Hong Kong, Southeast Asia, East Asia, and other regions.

In 2015, Sunrise released &quot;Victory Gundam&quot; on Blu-Ray in two box sets using a new HD master and telecine. The sets also included audio commentary, exclusive booklets, and cover art by mechanical designer Hajime Katoki. As with the DVDs, Tomino reiterated his disdain for the series in promotional materials, claiming that he wished to &quot;deny [the show] completely&quot; and asked that viewers of the set &quot;find what went wrong with &#x27;Mobile Suit V Gundam&#x27;.&quot;

In 2016, Sunrise released the series on both Blu-ray and DVD in North America via Right Stuf Inc. in two sets.

==Other media==
=== Novelizations ===
A series of five novels were written by director Yoshiyuki Tomino and initially published under the Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko label. This adaptation generally follows the plot of the anime but is notable for additional scenes and dialogue that contain graphic sexual references. In addition, the Victory 2 Gundam does not appear in the novel. Instead it is replaced by a Victory-type with a mounted Minovsky Drive. The &quot;Bugs&quot;, which were the automatic manslaughtering weapons of &quot;Gundam F91&quot;, also make an appearance.

===Manga adaptations===
A more lighthearted manga adaptation of the anime by Toshiya Iwamura was published on the &quot;Comic BomBom&quot; manga magazine. The serious atmosphere from the show was absent from the manga, replaced by gags, less serious personalities, and more super robot-style action scenes.

A gag parody manga by Tsukasa Kotobuki entitled was published throughout 1993 to 1994 in the &quot;Media Comic Dyne&quot; and &quot;MS Saga&quot; magazines, and was later republished in 2012 by Kadokawa Shoten, which included two side-stories from &quot;Gundam Ace&quot; involving Kai Shiden, and a parody story of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot;.

===Spin-off manga===
A spin-off to the series by Yuichi Hasegawa, , titled during serialization and republished in 2012 as , was published in 1994 in the &quot;Shōnen Kids&quot; magazine and compiled into a tankobon in 1995. The manga occurs during the events of the anime, when Uso travels to Jupiter and encounters an old man by the name of Grey Stoke.

===Video games===
A Super Famicom side-scrolling action game based on the show was released in Japan on March 11, 1994. It was developed by Tose and published by Bandai. The series also made appearances in Banpresto&#x27;s (now Bandai Namco) &quot;Super Robot Wars&quot; series, debuting in &quot;Super Robot Wars 2G&quot; for the Game Boy and more recently, in the mobile game &quot;Super Robot Wars X-Ω&quot; and the &quot;Compati Hero Series&quot; as well as appearing in various &quot;Gundam&quot; crossover games.

<text>Mobile Fighter G Gundam, also known in Japan as (and commonly referred to as simply G Gundam), is a 1994 Japanese animated television series produced by Sunrise and the fifth installment in the long-running &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. The series is set in the &quot;Future Century&quot;, where space colonies representing countries have agreed to hold an organized fighting tournament known as the &quot;Gundam Fight&quot; every four years to settle their political differences in place of war. Each colony sends a representative fighter piloting a giant, humanoid mecha called a Gundam to battle on Earth until only one is left, and the winning nation earns the right to govern over all the colonies until the next tournament. The events of &quot;G Gundam&quot; follow Domon Kasshu, the pilot of Neo Japan&#x27;s Shining Gundam during the 13th Gundam Fight. Domon&#x27;s mission is to both win the tournament and to track down his older brother, who is believed to have stolen the mysterious Devil Gundam (AKA the Dark Gundam outside of Japan/Asia) from the Neo Japan government.

Commemorating the 15th anniversary of the &quot;Gundam&quot; brand, &quot;G Gundam&quot; was produced to reboot the waning popularity of the long-running franchise. It is the first &quot;Gundam&quot; series with a self-contained plot set in an alternate calendar era from the original &quot;Universal Century&quot; timeline. Additionally, the show casts aside many of the conventions set by its predecessors and takes many new steps for its franchise, such as a focus on martial arts and decisive, personal duels as opposed to large-scale military conflicts. &quot;G Gundam&quot; was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, with its settings and characters significantly influenced by the director&#x27;s interest in world cinema. The anime&#x27;s real-world locales were drawn from numerous foreign films and were planned using location scouting. &quot;G Gundam&quot; ran for 49 episodes on Japan&#x27;s TV Asahi from April 22, 1994, to March 31, 1995. An English-language version produced by Bandai Entertainment aired in the United States on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Toonami block beginning on August 5, 2002. Since its original broadcast, &quot;G Gundam&quot; has spawned manga, audio albums, video games, guide books, and several lines of scale models.

During its conception and Japanese television debut, &quot;G Gundam&quot; was met with controversy among its production staff, sponsors, and fans because the show takes a wildly different turn from all previous entries in the &quot;Gundam&quot; universe. However, for that very reason, the series is cited as a milestone in its long-running franchise and ultimately proved very popular in the region. Reception for &quot;G Gundam&quot; has been generally positive in North America. Reviewers praised the primary characters and mecha as unique and stylized, but strongly disagreed on the plot. While some critics enjoyed the bold and campy divergence from the more dramatic social and political undertones traditional of &quot;Gundam&quot;, others found &quot;G Gundam&quot;″s story diffusely shallow, repetitive, or not up to standards set by its anime predecessors.

== Plot ==

Unlike previous series in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise which are set in the &quot;Universal Century&quot; timeline, &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; takes place in an alternate &quot;Future Century&quot; universe. Within this timeline, much of mankind has abandoned a ruined Earth to live in space colonies. The countries on Earth have corresponding colonies just outside the planet&#x27;s atmosphere. Rather than fight wars for political and social dominance, the colonies agree to hold a &quot;Gundam Fight&quot; tournament every four years. Each country sends to Earth a representative piloting a highly advanced, humanoid mobile fighter called a Gundam. The Gundams compete with one another in one-on-one battles, under a strict set of rules, until only one fighter remains; the nation represented by the winner earns the right to rule all of space for that period. Each Gundam is controlled directly by the user within the cockpit using the &quot;Mobile Trace System&quot;, a gesture recognition and feedback mechanism whereby the Gundam mimics the pilot&#x27;s own body motion, combat skills, and weapon-wielding capabilities. &quot;G Gundam&quot; opens at the start of the 13th Gundam Fight in Future Century year 60 and follows Neo Japan&#x27;s Domon Kasshu, fighter of his nation&#x27;s Shining Gundam and bearer of the coveted &quot;King of Hearts&quot; martial arts crest. Aside from winning the tournament, Domon&#x27;s mission is to track down his fugitive, older brother Kyoji, who allegedly stole the experimental Devil Gundam from Neo Japan&#x27;s government, leaving their mother dead and their father (Dr. Raizo Kasshu) to be arrested and placed in a cryogenic state.

Under orders from Major Ullube Ishikawa, Domon and his childhood friend and mechanic Rain Mikamura travel from country to country, challenging each one&#x27;s Gundam while searching for clues to the whereabouts of Kyoji and the Devil Gundam. Domon&#x27;s initial matches with Neo America&#x27;s Chibodee Crocket, Neo France&#x27;s George DeSand, Neo China&#x27;s Sai Sai Ci, and Neo Russia&#x27;s Argo Gulskii end in draws, gaining mutual respect among the fighters. As they encounter Gundam pilots who had come in contact with the Devil Gundam, Domon and Rain learn of its unique cellular properties to regenerate, multiply, and evolve by infecting organic matter and causing violent behavior in living things. The duo then journey to Neo Tokyo, a city decimated by the Devil Gundam&#x27;s army of mobile weapons. Domon reunites with his esteemed martial arts instructor Master Asia, who is also the champion of the last Gundam Fight, the former King of Hearts, and one-time leader of an elite group of Gundam fighters called the Shuffle Alliance. After Domon and Rain help the city&#x27;s survivors defend their last outpost in Shinjuku, Master Asia reveals himself as a servant of the Devil Gundam, having also gained control over Chibodee, George, Sai Sai Ci, and Argo using Devil Gundam (DG) cells. The four remaining members of the Shuffle Alliance intervene and vow to destroy their previous leader for his crimes. Ultimately, the Alliance members offer their lives in purging the DG cells from Domon&#x27;s four comrades and bestow each of them with a Shuffle Alliance crest as their successors. Kyoji and the enormous Devil Gundam eventually appear from beneath the ground of Shinjuku but shortly thereafter vanish alongside Master Asia. As the Shuffle Alliance trains in the Guiana Highlands for the Gundam Fight finals, Master Asia and the Devil Gundam reappear. With the help of his friends and a new ally in Neo Germany&#x27;s masked warrior Schwarz Bruder, Domon defeats the Devil Gundam. When the Shining Gundam becomes incapacitated during the battle, Domon desperately manages to activate a newly acquired God Gundam, escape Master Asia, and make his way to the finals set in Neo Hong Kong.

The Gundam Fight finals are presided over by Wong Yunfat, Neo Hong Kong&#x27;s prime minister, and the current ruler of the space colonies and Earth. Wong chooses to have the qualifying nations battle in one-on-one and tag team preliminary matches to reach a battle royale on Lantau Island, where the tournament is to end with the winner facing the defending champion Master Asia. Having gained possession of the Devil Gundam, Wong secretly plots to revive and control it as his trump card to inevitably maintain his own power over space. Domon and his companions make their way to the battle royale while several truths concerning the Devil Gundam are unveiled. Rain&#x27;s father, Dr. Mikamura, eventually explains that the Devil Gundam (originally called the Ultimate Gundam) was constructed by Dr. Kasshu to rejuvenate the dying Earth. Jealous of his genius colleague, Dr. Mikamura had Neo Japan&#x27;s officials attempt to confiscate Kasshu&#x27;s creation. To prevent the military from using his father&#x27;s invention for its own agenda, Kyoji fled with and crash-landed the Gundam on Earth, where its computer malfunctioned, triggering its malevolent activity. Ullube subsequently had Dr. Kasshu arrested, framed Kyoji as a criminal, and used Domon and Rain as pawns in recovering the Gundam. In a separate confession, Master Asia discloses to Domon that, having been distressed by the utter destruction wrought by the Gundam Fights, he planned to use the Devil Gundam to wipe out humanity and allow Earth to heal naturally. The battle on Lantau Island culminates with Domon fatally besting Master Asia in a final confrontation, while Kyoji and Schwarz sacrifice themselves so that Domon can attack the Devil Gundam&#x27;s cockpit and disable it once again. Though the schemes of both Wong and Master Asia are foiled, Ullube quietly claims the Devil Gundam and transports it to Neo Japan&#x27;s space colony for his own purpose. Having been corrupted by DG cells with ambitions of supreme power, Ullube kidnaps Rain and places her into the Devil Gundam&#x27;s core to act as its energy source. The hulking monstrosity then merges with the colony and begins absorbing Earth itself. As the entire world&#x27;s Gundams unite to assault the Devil Gundam from the outside, the Shuffle Alliance breaks inside the colony and destroys Ullube. Finally, Domon professes his love for Rain and releases her from the core. Invoking the power of the King of Hearts, the couple vanquishes the Devil Gundam once and for all.

== Production ==

===Staff and conception===
&quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; was produced by Sunrise in association with advertising agencies Sotsu and Dentsu, and toy company Bandai. The series was created to commemorate the 15th anniversary of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, created by Yoshiyuki Tomino in 1979. &quot;G Gundam&quot; was directed by Yasuhiro Imagawa, known for his work on the &quot;Giant Robo&quot; and &quot;Getter Robo Armageddon&quot; original video animations (OVAs). &quot;G Gundam&quot; was chiefly written and supervised by Fuyunori Gobu, a veteran screenwriter for various Sunrise properties such as &quot;Shippū! Iron Leaguer&quot; and &quot;The King of Braves GaoGaiGar&quot;. Many of the principal production crew members for &quot;G Gundam&quot; were carried over the previous season&#x27;s &quot;Mobile Suit Victory Gundam&quot;, including character designer Hiroshi Ōsaka and mechanical designers Kunio Okawara and Hajime Katoki. Manga artist Kazuhiko Shimamoto collaborated on the show&#x27;s character designs. Kimitoshi Yamane acted as a back-up mechanical designer and has since worked on Sunrise&#x27;s acclaimed series &quot;Cowboy Bebop&quot; and &quot;The Vision of Escaflowne&quot;. Hirotoshi Sano, previously credited for &quot;Tekkaman Blade&quot;, was responsible for directing the mechanical animation in &quot;G Gundam&quot;, but also produced much of show&#x27;s promotional artwork seen on home media covers. The musical score for &quot;G Gundam&quot; was composed by Kohei Tanaka. The opening theme song &quot;Flying in the Sky&quot; performed by Yoshifumi Ushima and the closing theme by Etsuko Sai are played for the first 25 episodes of the series. The opening theme &quot;Trust You Forever&quot; by Ushima and the closing theme by Takehide Inoue are played for the remaining episodes.

Like other early mecha anime, the &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; franchise was backed by sponsors whose main interest was having television programs advertise plastic models and toys. &quot;Gundam&quot; fiction set itself apart from others in the same genre with its dramatic plot devices, morally complex characters, and depictions of the horrors of war. These aspects, combined with its &quot;Real Robot&quot; mecha approach, made &quot;Gundam&quot; immensely popular for several years. After the broadcast of &quot;Victory Gundam&quot; beginning in 1993, Imagawa, a young protégé of Tomino, was selected as the director of the next installment in the franchise, titled &quot;Polcarino Gundam&quot;. However, as &quot;Gundam&quot; popularity dwindled and sales began to drop by this time, the sponsors forced the creators to reboot the brand with the newly titled &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;. Conceived as a less realistic &quot;Super Robot&quot; series, &quot;G Gundam&quot; abandoned its military roots and was aimed at younger viewers to increase toy sales. Alterations including a lack of a warfare-centered plot, Gundams stereotypically based on nationality, and Earth as a ring were originally seen as blasphemous to Imagawa and much of Sunrise&#x27;s staff. Notwithstanding, Imagawa became more supportive of the changes after seeing some impressive, complex designs in &quot;G Gundam&quot;″s sponsor-created toys. He eventually settled into his position, taking advice from his mentor. &quot;If you continue to make a copy of a copy of a copy,&quot; he stated, &quot;eventually the image degrades to nothing.&quot; Imagawa thought it was important for creators and sponsors to buy into each other&#x27;s ideas for the benefit of a product&#x27;s success. The director also commented that in order to sell a product like &quot;G Gundam&quot; to an audience resistant of such ambitious changes, creators must instill their own personalities to overcome hardships and make the work unique. By the end of production, Imagawa considered it meaningless to compare &quot;G Gundam&quot; to other parts of the franchise and disregarded the concept of a &quot;conventional&quot; &quot;Gundam&quot; series. &quot;This is MY &quot;Gundam&quot;,&quot; he proclaimed, &quot;And I&#x27;ve made a &quot;Gundam&quot; that I can be proud of.&quot;

===Influences===
As a film fanatic, Imagawa perceived that referencing world cinema would help illustrate the real world settings in &quot;G Gundam&quot;. The production staff primarily wished to utilize sightseeing guide books, but found that these books did not show the locations from the perspective of everyday people. The battlegrounds in the first several episodes were conveyed using a number of multimedia works including films by Federico Fellini, Woody Allen, Alfred Hitchcock, and Yılmaz Güney; films based on Wong Fei-hung; video clips of the band Swing Out Sister; music by the groups Genesis and Magma; and scenery from Monty Python acts. Each episode&#x27;s introductory narration, provided by the character Stalker, was inspired by American television dramas such as &quot;Star Trek&quot; and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot;. In the same manner, certain &quot;G Gundam&quot; character names and their techniques were drawn from films, most prominently the Hong Kong &quot;wuxia&quot; genre. For instance, the alternate name of antagonist Master Asia, , is named directly after the protagonist of a film of the same title. Additionally, the villain Wong Yunfat is based heavily on Hong Kong star Chow Yun-fat, specifically the actor&#x27;s appearance in the film &quot;God of Gamblers&quot;. Some elements in &quot;G Gundam&quot; were taken from other anime and manga. A key scene at the series midpoint involving the Shining Gundam&#x27;s gold-colored &quot;Super Mode&quot; was inspired by &quot;Saint Seiya&quot;. Another instance towards the show&#x27;s climax, where the hero&#x27;s rivals join him to fight a greater opposing force, was a commonly used motif in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; comics, most notably &quot;Ring ni Kakero&quot;.

===Design===

Some of the settings in &quot;G Gundam&quot; were planned using location scouting, a technique Imagawa learned while working on his directorial debut, &quot;Mister Ajikko&quot;. He stated that this type of research can &quot;upgrade&quot; animation production quality when supplemented by indirect experience from watching films. For the prison in Neo Russia, Imagawa drew from the architecture of the Alcatraz Federal Penitentiary, which he coincidentally toured one year before &quot;G Gundam&quot;″s development. When his superiors requested he restrict the show&#x27;s setting to one location, Imagawa used the city Shinjuku (beginning in the 12th episode) as an opportunity for his staff to learn and practice location scouting within Japan. Changing countries every week in the show&#x27;s early run was overwhelming for the set designers and background artists, yet the crew felt Imagawa &quot;over-elaborate&quot; on Shinjuku. The story transitioned to Guyana so that the artists could apply a simpler, dense forest environment. Once this portion of the anime&#x27;s plot concluded, staff members flew to Hong Kong to research and record for the Neo Hong Kong story arc. Imagawa mentioned that Neo Hong Kong does not possess its own space colony in &quot;G Gundam&quot;, so he wanted to accurately depict the country as one that continues to thrive on Earth. The director speculated that it would be difficult to illustrate Hong Kong due to its amount of detail, but he was very satisfied with the background artist&#x27;s work.

Imagawa credits himself for conceiving a majority of the various Gundams participating in the finals of the Neo Hong Kong arc. The director worked closely with mecha artists to create these &quot;one-shot&quot; opponents and found many of the comical and eccentric designs very charming, especially the windmill-shaped Hurricane Gundam of Neo Holland. The designs for Neo Singapore&#x27;s Ashura Gundam and Neo Malaysia&#x27;s Skull Gundam were included in the show as winners of contests held by the Kodansha publications &quot;Comic BonBon&quot; and &quot;TV Magazine&quot;; Imagawa expressed regret that these Gundams were used as enemy characters since they were designed by young fans of the anime.

Around the 40th episode, Imagawa focused on adding a romantic theme into &quot;G Gundam&quot;″s narrative. He explained that he was &quot;not good at depicting female characters&quot; when directing and he had not previously &quot;written a &#x27;normal&#x27; relationship of man and woman&quot;. &quot;G Gundam&quot; was Imagawa&#x27;s first attempt at a &quot;love story&quot;, though he admitted it took him the entire length of the series demonstrates this point. The show&#x27;s final scene shows Domon and Rain riding off together on the horse Fuun Saiki; Imagawa sensed that the cliché of the hero with his damsel on a white horse was &quot;the safe road&quot; given the director&#x27;s lack of experience with love stories. Imagawa polarized the production studio staff when he decided to insert the English phrase &quot;Love-Love&quot; into Domon and Rain&#x27;s final attack against the Devil Gundam. Sunrise producer Masahiko Minami protested that it sounded so &quot;unseemly&quot; that he even confronted Imagawa about it at the director&#x27;s home. However, Imagawa not only thought the phrase had a nice ring to it but wanted to include it because he had already found success in defying convention with &quot;G Gundam&quot;. Imagawa was prepared to take the risk of any harsh criticism for its use in the finale. &quot;I didn&#x27;t even care if I wouldn&#x27;t be able to work in the industry because of that &#x27;Love-Love&#x27;,&quot; he said. &quot;I truly believe that one cannot work as a director without enthusiasm and a love of challenges.&quot;

=== Anime ===

The &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; television series originally aired in Japan the terrestrial channel TV Asahi from April 22, 1994, to March 31, 1995, for a total of 49 episodes. The show would not reach North American audiences until many years later. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;, a series that succeeded &quot;G Gundam&quot; on Japanese television in 1995, was first localized in North America by Bandai Entertainment in early 2000. &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; was a huge success in the United States while being broadcast on the popular afternoon Toonami block of Cartoon Network often beating block stalwarts &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; and &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; and was the highest-rated program on all of Cartoon Network for a time. In late 2001, Bandai acquired the rights to distribute an English-dubbed version of &quot;G Gundam&quot; with voice casting recorded by Ocean Productions in their Blue Water studio in Calgary, Alberta. The English-language version of &quot;G Gundam&quot; premiered as a free screening at the Sony Metreon Action Theatre in San Francisco on March 30, 2002. &quot;G Gundam&quot; began airing on Toonami on August 5, 2002. Due to the channel&#x27;s censorship policies, some edits were made for the broadcast. This mainly involved altering the names of several mobile fighters, such as changing God Gundam and Devil Gundam to Burning Gundam and Dark Gundam respectively. The show was also aired on the channel&#x27;s &quot;Midnight Run&quot; and as part of its Saturday programming in November 2002. Cartoon Network officially dropped &quot;G Gundam&quot; from its afternoon schedule the following June. The series has since been re-broadcast on the Japanese cable network Family Gekijo and the satellite channel Animax.

Bandai Entertainment released &quot;G Gundam&quot; on DVD in North America in four box sets and in twelve separate volumes (each disc containing four to five episodes). The DVDs contain both the English-dubbed and Japanese-subtitled versions, as well as extras such as production notes from the director. The first three volumes and first box set were released on November 5, 2002. The second box set and next three volumes were released on February 4, 2003. The third box set and next three volumes were released on April 22, 2003. The final box set and last three volumes were released on June 17, 2003. Bandai re-released the series as part of its &quot;Anime Legends&quot; label in two larger collections on May 9 and June 27, 2006. &quot;G Gundam&quot; has had similar DVD releases in Japan; a collection containing the entire series was placed on sale October 27, 2010. &quot;G Gundam&quot; has further been made available on various video on demand services including Amazon Instant Video, the broadband access site Bandai Channel, and Bandai&#x27;s official GundamInfo YouTube channel. Due to the closure of Bandai Entertainment, the series has been out-of-print. On October 11, 2014, at their 2014 New York Comic Con panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including &quot;G Gundam&quot; in North America though distribution from Right Stuf Inc., beginning in Spring 2015. On March 29, 2017, Crunchyroll began streaming the series on their website. Right Stuf will release the series on Blu-ray and DVD in 2018.

===Other merchandise===

This includes plastic model kits ranging from 1:144 to 1:60 scales; expensive garage kits made from resin; and action figures, some of which are exclusive to North America. Sunrise produced a promotional short film centered on &quot;G Gundam&quot; as the third entry of an OVA series known as &quot;Gundam Evolve&quot;, packaged as a limited edition bonus with the Master Grade GF13-017NJ Shining Gundam model kit.

==Reception==
&quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot; received mediocre television ratings during its run on Japanese television in 1994 and 1995. According to Nikkei Business Publications, the series saw an average of just 4.02% viewership for the Kantō region and Greater Tokyo Area throughout its 49-episode run. The overall ratings for &quot;G Gundam&quot; were higher than that of the previous series &quot;Mobile Suit Victory Gundam&quot; and slightly lower than the following series &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;. Critically, &quot;G Gundam&quot; was met with some controversy upon its Japanese debut. &quot;G Gundam&quot; replicates very little of the dramatic, militaristic conventions of prior &quot;Gundam&quot; series, setting itself apart with a different tone; taking place outside the franchise&#x27;s main timeline; and foregoing large-scale, armed conflicts in favor of tournament-style, martial arts matches. Director Yasuhiro Imagawa claimed to have taken a large amount of criticism for these changes from both fans and design staff members. &quot;G Gundam&quot; ultimately proved very popular in Japan.

Early in the show&#x27;s North American run, Bandai reported that &quot;G Gundam&quot; had the top ratings of any anime show for the period. The company considered the show to be a &quot;hit&quot; at the time. However, officials for Toonami recounted in 2006 that no &quot;Gundam&quot; series earned significant viewer ratings after the first North American airing of &quot;Gundam Wing&quot; in 2000. &quot;G Gundam&quot; received an overall positive critical reception amid its mainstream exposure in the United States. Nonetheless, views on &quot;G Gundam&quot;″s plot remain largely mixed. Negative reactions to the plot mostly stem from its stark contrast to preceding &quot;Gundam&quot; entries that have traditionally focused on deep political and social issues in the midst of war. AnimeNation writer John Oppliger considered &quot;G Gundam&quot; to be &quot;the plague of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise&quot; and &quot;one of the biggest mis-steps in anime history&quot; due to its elimination of such serious subtext. Both Bamboo Dong of the Anime News Network and Duncan Scott of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot; were also initially disappointed for the same reason, with the latter writer feeling that the series features &quot;Gundam&quot; in its title purely for marketing reasons. Derrick L. Tucker of T.H.E.M. Anime Reviews called the series&#x27; episodic storyline its &quot;most profound weakness&quot;, whereby &quot;the narrative exists to move the viewer from fight to fight&quot;. Tucker also found that the potential for its more dramatic themes, such as tension between Domon and Master Asia or Domon&#x27;s romantic relationship with Rain, is &quot;overshadowed from start to finale by the show&#x27;s domineering, if repetitive action sets&quot;.

Other critics were more accepting of the plot as it progressed, overlooking comparisons to past &quot;Gundam&quot; series. &quot;Animerica&quot; editor Mark Simmons, Martin Ouellette of &quot;Protoculture Addicts&quot;, and anime journalist Mike Toole have all shared opinions that the show can be immensely enjoyed by not taking it too seriously. David Smith of IGN denoted &quot;G Gundam&quot; &quot;the greatest giant robot series that has ever been&quot; because of the seemingly &quot;over-the-top&quot; nature that drives the premise. Smith asserted, &quot;&quot;G Gundam&quot; maintains a completely straight face through every second. That&#x27;s the trick, because to let the audience laugh for one moment would break the effect. You don&#x27;t laugh at &quot;G Gundam&quot; – you become completely absorbed in the wondrous violence of it all.&quot; Simmons concluded that the addition of components like &quot;nanotechnological plagues, evil armies, zombie legions, betrayal, and heartbreak [...] make the end result entertaining for more sophisticated viewers as well as for youngsters enticed by the colorful shiny robots&quot;. Toole stated that despite valid criticism that the plot is &quot;silly and exaggerated&quot; and its introductory episodes suffering from &quot;battle of the week fare&quot;, the debut of Master Asia triggers &quot;some great character development&quot;. Dong similarly appreciated the show more in its Neo Hong Kong story arc and perceived it much easier for a new viewer to begin watching at any point in the series than with other &quot;Gundam&quot; installments.

The large cast of characters and mecha in &quot;G Gundam&quot; has received mostly praise from critics. Toole, Tucker, Ouellette, and Smith made positive mention of the primary characters for their unique designs and attributes; all four reviewers have noted many of the supporting characters to be overly stereotypical with regard to their nationality. Toole particularly enjoyed the protagonist Domon, whom he described as very well-rounded, and regarded Master Asia as &quot;both a great hero and a great villain&quot;. Tucker interpreted the main characters &quot;stylized and distinctive&quot; which possess individual motivations that give them &quot;dynamic appeal&quot;. Tucker was also impressed with the design variety and color format of the mobile fighters, which break the mold set by the conventional Gundam template. Toole and Smith together felt that the more campy Gundam stereotypes added to the show&#x27;s endearment. While referring to Neo America&#x27;s mobile fighter, Smith exclaimed, &quot;This show has a cowboy/boxer/quarterback/surfer Gundam, for God&#x27;s sake.&quot; Simmons equivalently and sarcastically summarized, &quot;This is a world where the space colony of Neo Holland is represented by a Gundam that transforms into a giant windmill.&quot;

==Legacy==
During the North American DVD production interviews for &quot;Mobile Fighter G Gundam&quot;, Imagawa was asked to address the message &quot;See you again Gundam Fight 14&quot; shown at the last cut of the final episode. He answered that it was simply word play and had no intention of affirming a sequel to the anime. Granted its large number of manga side-stories, Imagawa surmised that it would be &quot;impossible&quot; to create an animated sequel or OVA series to &quot;G Gundam&quot; and disclosed he would not direct it if there were. He said, &quot;I believe &quot;G Gundam&quot; is a series that started as a program for kids and eventually worked out because I stayed vividly aware of that until the very last moment, overcoming a lot of obstacles and bad situations (in terms of directing).&quot;

Oppliger found that &quot;G Gundam&quot; had established a legacy within the anime industry, albeit a different one from its 1979 namesake. He elaborated that &quot;G Gundam&quot; represents a &quot;catalyst for development within Japan&#x27;s anime industry&quot; for being the first complete reboot of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise and the first of many &quot;Gundam&quot; TV series to feature a self-contained storyline separate from the traditional franchise continuity. In 2001, &quot;G Gundam&quot; was listed by the Japanese magazine &quot;Animage&quot; among the top 100 most important anime in history in terms of historical significance, influence and impact on the anime industry.

<doc id="253054" wikidata="Q2018307" url="?curid=253054" title="Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical">
<text>The Tony Award for Best Revival of a Musical has been awarded since 1994. Before that time, both plays and musicals were considered together for the Tony Award for Best Revival. The award is given to the producers of the best musical play which has already appeared on Broadway in a previous production, or is regarded as being in the common theatrical repertoire. Like Best Musical, excerpts from the musicals that are nominated for this award are usually performed during the ceremony before this award is presented.

As of 2019, composers are also eligible for this award, when a show is considered a revival but has not previously appeared on Broadway.

<doc id="253055" wikidata="Q2352026" url="?curid=253055" title="Turn A Gundam">
<text>, also stylized as ∀ Gundam, is a 1999 Japanese mecha anime series produced by Sunrise, and aired between 1999 and 2000 on Fuji Television and other FNS stations. It was created for the &quot;Gundam Big Bang&quot; 20th Anniversary celebration, and is the eighth installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. It was later compiled in 2002 into two feature-length films entitled Turn A Gundam I: Earth Light and Turn A Gundam II: Moonlight Butterfly.

&quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; was directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino, who is the main creator of the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, and who had written and directed many previous &quot;Gundam&quot; works. Tomino created the series as a means of &quot;affirmatively accepting all of the &quot;Gundam&quot; series&quot;, which is reflected in the series title&#x27;s use of the Turned A, a mathematical symbol representing universal quantification.

== Overview ==
&quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; takes place in the year , in a different calendar era than the previous Gundam projects. The Japanese term for Correct Century, &quot;&quot;, is a wordplay on the Japanese term for the Common Era (CE) Western calendar system (; pronounced ). The population of the Earth is, at the beginning of the series, limited to simple, steam-driven technology after past cataclysms; the Moon is populated by the Moonrace, humans who left Earth after a great war long ago to reside in technologically advanced lunar colonies until such time as they deemed the Earth suitable to return to.

== Plot ==

&quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; follows the character Loran Cehack, a young member of the Moonrace. Selected as part of a reconnaissance mission to determine whether the Earth was fit for resettlement, Loran lands on the continent of North America, spends two years living on Earth as the chauffeur to the Heim family, and grows attached to its people. With the expectation of a peaceful resettlement operation from his people, he and a pair of his close friends sent down with him confirm that the Earth is now fit for the Moonrace to make their return. He&#x27;s taken by surprise when the Moonrace intends to return to Earth via an offensive with mobile suits, and their first attack sparks a violent conflict between Earth and moon.

The night of the first attack, Loran is at the White Doll, an enormous humanoid statue, for a coming-of-age ceremony. When the Moonrace attacks and the battle in town can be seen from a distance the children panic. In the midst of this panic, the White Doll shatters, revealing a metallic figure within, and the shrine collapses around it. During the panic, Loran recognizes the White Doll as a mobile suit, and succeeds in applying his knowledge of the Moonrace&#x27;s mobile suits to pilot it. The death of the Heim patriarch in the attack pulls the family and Loran into the budding war; Loran becomes the designated pilot of the White Doll, and its discovery prompts the excavation of further mobile suits in the various &quot;mountain cycles&quot; covering the Earth. As the Moonrace&#x27;s invasion rapidly turns into a full-fledged war against the increasingly armed Earthrace, it becomes clear that this state of affairs is divisive among both groups; while the Moonrace&#x27;s queen Dianna Soreil attempts to negotiate with the local leaders for a peaceful solution by which the Moonrace can come to reside on the Earth, the militaristic among both populations interfere with the negotiations again and again, forcing the war to continue as opposed to accepting a compromise.

== Media ==
=== Anime ===

The series aired 50 episodes in Japan from April 9, 1999 to April 14, 2000 on Fuji TV, being the only Gundam anime to air on said channel. It was directed by Yoshiyuki Tomino and produced by Hideyuki Tomioka, Takayuki Yoshii, and Yoshihiro Suzuki. Character designs was by Akira Yasuda and Yoshihito Hishinuma while mecha designs were done by Atsushi Shigeta, Kunio Okawara, Syd Mead, Takumi Sakura. Shigemi Ikeda directed the art and Yota Tsuruoka directed the sound. Toshiaki Ohta and Yoko Kanno composed the music.

The eponymous Turn A Gundam is notable because it is the first Gundam mecha designed entirely by a foreigner, the famous American visual futurist and conceptual artist Syd Mead. The first design of the new Gundam created by Mead was rejected at first by Yoshiyuki due to its extremely exotic appearance, since Tomino decided that he wanted a figure closer to previous Gundam designs. Because of its quality and impressive appearance, the old design was not discarded at all by Tomino, instead renamed and used by him as the antagonist mobile suit design &quot;Sumo&quot;.

Mead designed the Turn A Gundam using real world industrial design aspects, which were aimed to make it look simple and realistic. The shield was one of the components designed by Syd Mead with little constraint from the production team. It needed to be big enough so that the suit could hide behind it, making it easier for the anime production staff to draw. Syd Mead imagined it to be like a clam shell and finally settled with a design that looked like the old MS-14 Gelgoog&#x27;s shield from the first series.

&quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; is the last entry of the Gundam franchise (not counting the compilations and future video game cut scenes) to be mostly hand painted on cels. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot;, released in 2002, was the first series to switch entirely to digital ink and paint.

The series had two films releases, Turn A Gundam I: Earth Light released February 9, 2002 and Turn A Gundam II: Moonlight Butterfly released February 10, 2002. The films were a condensed retelling of the 50 episodes between the two.

=== Manga ===
The Series had two manga adaptations. One by Kōichi Tokita published by Kodansha Ltd. running from April 15, 1999 to March 15, 2000 through Comic BomBom Magazine. Another written by Yoshiyuki Tomino running from June 26, 1999 to March, 2002 that was published by Kodansha Ltd. In their magazine, Monthly Magazine Z.

There would be a manga release that would serve as a prequel for the main series titled, Turn A Gundam: Tsuki no Kaze written by Akira Yasuda that would be published by Kadokawa Shoten in their magazine, Gundam Ace running from March 2004 to March 2005. The manga would follow a younger Loran prior to the events of the main show or manga. Here it is shown the process that Loran and the other characters training to for the upcoming reconnaissance mission on earth. As well as introduce how Loran would eventually be selected for the mission, and send off to earth.

== Relationship with other &quot;Gundam&quot; series ==
&quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; has been cited by Director Tomino and other sources as a show that would unify the stories from the various &quot;Gundam&quot; series into one. Throughout the show, mobile suits resembling those from the eras depicted in previous &quot;Gundam&quot; shows and indicated to be preserved by nano machines for thousands of years, including as those of the Universal Century, are excavated by the show&#x27;s various factions. In Episode 42, this plotline comes to a culmination as the history of the Correct Century timeline is shown in a collection of clips known as the , which is revealed to be events that took place in different &quot;Gundam&quot; series prior to &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot;, thus making those events part of the Correct Century timeline&#x27;s history.

The book &quot;2001 Correct Century, A Bibliographical Study of &quot;Dark History&quot;&quot;, printed in black pages in front of the &quot;Universal Century Gundam Officials Encyclopedia&quot;, is supposedly uncovered by a fictional &quot;Lecturer in Black History&quot; named Yokk Wakk Onimott during Correct Century 1993. Onimott spends two years to fix the broken pages, five years to interpret the language, and a year to find a publisher. He states that the book was first printed around 3,000 years ago by the Rhea branch of the Earth Federation Government University. Included in the book is a picture drawn by Kunio Okawara showing a mobile suit supposed to be MS-04 as a S.U.I.T. project of the Zeon forces in UC0072~0075. It supposedly was found in 1993 Correct Century in the mountain cycle &quot;Library A-a&quot;. The white page introduction by another fictional writer, &quot;Minaka Junkers&quot;, an economy assistant professor of the Rhea branch of the Earth Federation Government University, states the book was published in UC0100 to celebrate the Centennial anniversary of the Universal Century. Thus it is officially claimed that the Universal Century is a time before Correct Century, possibly around 3,000 years before the story of Turn A begins.

Later sources would greatly increase the time frame between the two. The official English Gundam.info Archives website, created by Sunrise, describes Correct Century as, &quot;similar to early 20th Century America, but is actually set tens of thousands of years in the distant future and incorporates every Universal Century and Another Gundam timeline that ever existed.&quot; The manual for the Master Grade Turn X gunpla, released in June 2014, would further attempt to expand what is covered by the Dark History as the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; marking the beginning of humanity&#x27;s space age, and &quot;Turn A&quot; as the final result, with all other &quot;Gundam&quot; series, including those that were produced prior to &quot;Turn A&quot;: &quot;G Gundam&quot;, &quot;Gundam Wing&quot;, and &quot;Gundam X&quot;, and those produced after: &quot;Gundam SEED&quot;, &quot;Gundam 00&quot;, and &quot;Gundam AGE&quot;, taking place in the tens of thousands of years in between the two shows.

== North American release ==
On July 22, 2010, Bandai Entertainment announced that they had acquired the license to release &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; in the United States and that they were planning to release the series on Region 1 DVD in 2011. The release was cancelled in January 2012 when Bandai Entertainment announced it would no longer offer any new products in the North American territory.

On October 11, 2014, at their 2014 New York Comic Con panel, Sunrise announced they will be releasing all of the Gundam franchise, including &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; in North America though distribution from Right Stuf Inc., beginning in Spring 2015.

On March 11, 2015, Right Stuf Inc. announced that the first 25 episodes will be released on June 30, 2015. Sunrise and Right Stuf will also release the &quot;Turn A Gundam&quot; films in addition to the TV series.

On April 3, 2015, Right Stuf Inc. announced the remaining 25 episodes of the show would be released on August 4, 2015, via Blu-ray release.

== Reception ==

&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot; designer Yun Kōga cited &quot;Turn A&quot; when asked about her favorite series within the franchise.

The Turn A Gundam was chosen to be the 100th Master Grade model of Gunpla (abbreviation of Gundam Plastic Model) and at an earlier time, the first release of the Turn A Gundam DVD box set was announced. Two of the three Model Magazine in Japan, Hobby Japan and Dengeki Hobby was informed to build their own Turn A model using the old 1/100 kit for a display in the official announcement of the MS100 Turn A. Hobby Japan modeller Seira Masuo drastically redesigned the unit while Dengeki Hobby modeller went for the original approach of diorama. Both of the models was placed next to the MG100 draft design at the Bandai display forum at the announcement of MG100. Tomino addressed his little disappointment in the design of Turn A Gundam not having good reception, but he commented that it was happy to see that it was not pointless work as Turn A was selected as the 100th Master Grade model.

Turn A Gundam is also available on High Grade 1/144 scale and on Robot Spirit line. Turn X was released in Master Grade format in June 2014.

<text>is an anime series developed by Sunrise and directed by Mitsuo Fukuda. The ninth installment in the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise, &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; takes place in a future calendar era, in this case the Cosmic Era. In this era, mankind has developed into two subspecies: Naturals, who reside on Earth, and Coordinators, genetically enhanced humans capable of amazing feats of intellect who emigrate to man-made orbital colonies to escape persecution by natural humans. The story revolves around a young Coordinator Kira Yamato who becomes involved in the war between the two races after a third, neutral faction&#x27;s space colony is invaded by the Coordinators.

The television series was broadcast in Japan between 2002 and 2003, on the Tokyo Broadcasting System Television and MBS TV networks, beginning a broadcast partnership with the &quot;Gundam&quot; franchise. The series spawned three compilations films and was adapted into a manga as well as light novels. A sequel series, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Destiny&quot; followed in 2004 and a followup film, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Freedom&quot; was released in 2024. Merchandise has been released, including models, CD soundtracks and video games. &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was licensed by Bandai Entertainment for broadcast in North America, and began airing in the United States and Canada in 2004. The films and the sequel were also licensed by Bandai. The manga and light novels as well as the spin-off series, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED Astray&quot;, were licensed. Video games were released in North America. In 2011, a HD remaster of the series consisting of 48 episodes was released.

&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; was widely popular with the public in Japan, winning numerous awards, with high sales of the series DVD and music. It was also a critical success with writers focusing on the character development and animation especially the leads. However, similarities with previous Gundam series were noted.

==Plot==

The series is the first of the Gundam franchise set in the &quot;Cosmic Era&quot; in which mankind is divided between normal Earth dwelling humans, known as &quot;Naturals&quot;, and the genetically altered super-humans known as &quot;Coordinators&quot;. The primary conflict of the story plot derives from jealous hatred by Naturals of the abilities of Coordinators, leading to hate crimes, and eventually the emigration of almost all Coordinators who flee into space to live idyllic lives on giant orbital space colonies called PLANTS of their own design. War eventually breaks out between Earth and the PLANTS. The Earth is divided between two major factions, the Earth Forces formed from most of the natural born human nations, primarily the Eurasians and the Atlantic Federation, and a natural human supremacist group known as Blue Cosmos with its slogan, &quot;For the preservation of our blue and pure world&quot;. The Earth Forces are not a unified alliance, and infighting and mistrust exist between their various nation states. The second major Earth nation is the Orb Union, a staunchly politically neutral and isolationist nation located on small Pacific Ocean islands ruled by a hereditary monarchy and still contains Coordinator citizens.

Two major events precede the story, known as the Bloody Valentine tragedy that initiated war between the PLANTS and the Earth Forces when one of the PLANT space stations, Junius-7, is destroyed by a nuclear bomb. The second event is the counterattack by the PLANTS that buries Neutron Jammers deep into Earth&#x27;s crust that halts all nuclear reactions and long range radar and radio, causing most areas of earth to go without electricity or communication, and requiring mobile suits to rely on rechargeable batteries.

The PLANTS are a technological power house, developing many new technologies that give them equal power to Earth despite their very small population. It is the invention of the Mobile Suits that give their military the edge in the beginning of the war.

The story begins in the neutral Orb Union owned space colony Heliopolis, where five advanced mobile suits for the Earth Forces war effort are developed in secret in exchange of sharing of their technical data with the neutral Orb Union military. Additionally, Heliopolis constructs a unique carrier battleship, the Archangel, to base the five mobile suits from for the Earth Forces. The colony is attacked by ZAFT forces, the military of the PLANTS, with the objective of stealing the new units. During the incursion an Orb Union student and Coordinator named Kira Yamato, upon seeing his friends in danger, pilots the GAT-X105 Strike mobile suit to fend off the invaders but the colony is critically damaged in the ensuing fight. As Heliopolis disintegrates, the survivors board the Archangel, and begin their journey to the Alliance base in Alaska. During the journey to Earth, Kira pilots the Strike to counter a series of attacks by ZAFT but is seemingly killed by his childhood friend, ZAFT soldier Athrun Zala, during one of their battles in which he also is nearly killed. Kira survives the attack and is taken by a blind priest to one of the PLANT space colonies, home to the Coordinators to recover. The Archangel arrives in Alaska but ZAFT launches a full-scale attack on the base overpowering their enemies. Unknown to ZAFT, the Earth forces knew of this attack ahead of time. They planned to sacrifice the Alaska base along with the Archangel in order to destroy ZAFT&#x27;s army using a weapon of mass destruction hidden underneath the Alaska base.

Kira goes to Alaska with the ZGMF-X10A Freedom, a highly advanced, nuclear powered, and Neutron Jammer proof ZAFT mobile suit stolen by the PLANT pop star Coordinator Lacus Clyne, daughter of PLANT Supreme Council Chairman Siegel Clyne. Using the Freedom, Kira is able to help the Archangel flee the destruction of the Alaska base. The Archangel flees to the neutral country of the Orb Union. The Archangel and a new ship, the Orb Union ship Kusanagi leave Earth for space where they then join Lacus Clyne&#x27;s rebel faction and their stolen ZAFT battleship, the Eternal (meant to carry the Freedom and Justice mobile suits) to form the Three Ships Alliance with the common goal of ending the war between the Naturals and Coordinators. In the midst of the conflict, Athrun learns that Kira survived and searches for him under orders to recover the Freedom Gundam, and is given an equally powerful prototype, the ZGMF-X09A Justice. However, after learning of Patrick Zala&#x27;s, Athrun&#x27;s father and the radical militant faction leader of the PLANT Supreme Council, plan to commit genocide, Athrun deserts him and joins the Three Ships Alliance. In a final battle, the Earth Forces deploys nuclear weapons equipped with Neutron Jammer Canceler technology copied from stolen data on the Freedom and Justice Gundam&#x27;s power systems. The Earth Forces intend to destroy the PLANT space colonies but are stopped by ZAFT&#x27;s GENESIS, a nuclear pumped gamma ray laser designed to commit genocide on the Naturals. The Three Ship Alliance intervenes to defeat the GENESIS weapon ending the battle. The war ultimately ends as a peace treaty is signed.

==Development==

&quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; was directed by Mitsuo Fukuda (&quot;Future GPX Cyber Formula&quot; and &quot;Gear Fighter Dendoh&quot;) with music by Toshihiko Sahashi. A long time Gundam fan, Fukuda met the president of Sunrise in order let him work in his anime series based on the franchise, stating he had no previous experience with it. Shortly afterwards, the staff members from Sunrise believed Fukuda was worthy of directing the new Gundam anime. Fukuda conceived &quot;SEED&quot; as one of the biggest projects in his career, noting that it was difficult for him as a result as he worked under pressure. However, when the series started, Fukuda was relieved that it had strong ratings and merchandising
. In the making of the series, Fukuda first wrote an idea for the premise and the use of mechas fighting. In order to write human drama, Fukuda conceived the idea of the struggle between two kind of races, the Naturals and the Coordinators who would be explored in the television series which was inspired by Yoshiyuki Tomino&#x27;s Newtype concept from the first Gundam series. While the narrative of &quot;SEED&quot; often makes parallels with Tomino&#x27;s &quot;Gundam&quot;, Fukuda wanted &quot;SEED&quot; to feature a more &quot;modern war&quot; setting. The producer of the series suggested using the 1998 film &quot;Saving Private Ryan&quot; as a reference to explore the concept of war. Some areas from the storyboards were scrapped because the staff found the original plot to be too violent.

When the series started development, Fukuda noticed the world was in chaos as a result of the September 11 attacks. This influenced the themes of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; featuring anti-war movement themes through the pacifist Kira Yamato; Fukuda based hime concept of an Islamic soldier fighting in the US military. The setting in which the mechanics that appear are powered by electricity was influenced by &quot;Gear Fighter Dendoh&quot; which Fukuda previously directed, and when it came to handling the Gundam, he focused on its aspect as a symbol of the character piloting it.

The series was first announced in June 2002, while a trailer was available in September on the series&#x27; official website. A total of eight writers were in charge of the series. The characters were designed by Hisashi Hirai, while the mechanical designs were made by Kunio Okawara and Kimitoshi Yamane. &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; planning manager Koichi Inoue stated that the staff making &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was a new and young team that would continue working with following Gundam series. Inoue, however, would work with anime based on the original Gundam series.

Fukuda stated that &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was initially told from Kira&#x27;s point of view, but deeper into the series the point of view would shift to other characters. His main focus with the series was to entertain the audience, pointing out that the drama would develop through the series in a similar vein to previous Gundam series. The first part worked on was the plot followed by action sequences, stating that the human characters were more important than the combat sequences. In retrospect, Fukuda said that Kira&#x27;s wish to fight was forced upon him stemming from his desire to protect his friends. Moreover, he considered these actions as being based on Japanese thoughts.

==Reception==
The show has become one of the most popular of the Gundam series in Japan, enjoying high television ratings and DVD sales. In April 2004, Bandai Visual announced that one million copies of the &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; DVD had been sold in Japan, with the first volume having sold over 100,000 copies. In total, the series set a record of making eight DVDs appearing in the first eight top sales. The same record was repeated in 2016 by &quot;Mr. Osomatsu&quot;. CDs sales have also been high with the single CD from the series&#x27; first ending theme becoming one of the top-selling CDs in Japan during 2002. By July 2004, 10 million plastic &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; models had been sold worldwide.

Jerry Chu, marketing manager for Bandai Entertainment Inc., stated the response to &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; has been highly positive, having broken rating records when it first aired in Japan. Chu added that reaction in the United States was the most enthusiastic Bandai received in the last six years. According to the analyst John Oppliger of AnimeNation &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; became the first Gundam series which was widely successful not only among &quot;Gundam fans and hardcore otaku&quot; but also among &quot;mainstream, casual Japanese viewers&quot;. &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; was the eighth TV Feature Award winner at the Animation Kobe Awards in 2003. It was the third winner at the Japanese Otaku Awards in 2003. It won &quot;Animage&quot;″s twenty-fifth Anime Grand Prix award winner in 2002, with the characters of Kira Yamato and Lacus Clyne topping the male and female anime categories, respectively. It topped the charts in the &quot;Newtype&quot; magazine reader poll during 2004. However, the show was not well received by older Japanese fans. In February 2004, Sunrise&#x27;s president, Takayuki Yoshii, stated it was because &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; incorporated elements from popular live-action television dramas. On the other hand, Bandai Visual reported in April 2004 that &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; had a wide audience, including both young and older viewers.

&quot;Gundam SEED&quot; has been praised for being a stand-out in a long line of Gundam series with Anime News Network&#x27;s Paul Fargo calling it &quot;the best of the alternative timelines, but stands as one of the best Gundam titles&quot;. The story has been praised for its battle sequences as well as its character-driven scenes, neither of which were reviewed to have detracted emphasis from the other. The series was noted to &quot;downshift&quot; in pace from its early episodes as the main characters development began to progress along political themes, which appealed to some audiences. Early in the series, speculations were made with regard to the progress the characters&#x27; relationships. The relationship between Kira Yamato and Athrun Zala earned praise as it resulted in entertaining action scenes between their mobile suits, while in later reviews speculation arose as to whether the two would become allies.

The climax has been praised for bringing unexpected inclusions within the war, as well as revelations regarding the characters&#x27; roles. A common comment among writers was that &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; blended elements from previous Gundam series and displayed it in a fast-paced way, making it enjoyable to younger fans but still engaging older fans familiar with previous series. DVD Verdict writer Mitchell Hattaway further noted that while it used elements from other anime series, it still &quot;drew [him] in so quickly [he] soon found [himself] wrapped up in the proceedings&quot;. Carl Kimlinger from Anime News Network stated that &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; adapted the original &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; series from 1979 for a modern audience in the same way &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam 00&quot; would adapt &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam Wing&quot;. Bamboo Dong from the same site stated that while this caused the appearance of &quot;hardcore anti-&quot;Gundam Seed&quot; zealots&quot; who criticized the series for these traits, it was nevertheless entertaining to watch and give anime fans a step into the &quot;Gundam fandom&quot;.

The quality of the animation led THEM Anime Reviews&#x27; Derrick L. Tucker to call it &quot;by-and-far the best of any Gundam Series to date&quot;. Additionally, the soundtrack was popular for bringing popular J-pop artists such as Nami Tamaki and T.M. Revolution to perform the theme songs. The casting of many talented voice actors, such as Rie Tanaka, Seki Tomokazu and Houko Kuwashima, provided the emotional depth in scenes that required it. The English dub was reviewed favorably for the most part but comparisons between the English and original Japanese dubbing revealed weaknesses in the portrayal of the characters.

In the NHK&#x27;s 2018 mega &quot;All Gundam Poll&quot;, &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam SEED&quot; was place as the third best anime in the Gundam franchise, only behind the original 1979 &quot;Mobile Suit Gundam&quot; and &quot;Mobile Suit Zeta Gundam&quot;.

===Controversy===
The sixteenth episode of &quot;Gundam SEED&quot; features a scene in which Kira Yamato is seen dressing after getting out of a bed where the teenage girl Flay Allster lies sleeping naked, suggesting a sexual relationship. The Japanese Commission for Better Broadcasting reported that viewers filed complaints regarding the scene as the show was aired at 6 pm when children would be watching. Mainichi replied by mentioning it should have given more careful consideration to the episode before airing it. The scene was extended in one of the compilation films with John Oppliger noting it expanded the off-screen scene with three shots.

<doc id="253057" wikidata="Q7821798" url="?curid=253057" title="Tony Award for Best Revival of a Play">
<text>The [[Tony Award]] for Best Revival of a Play has only been awarded since 1994. Prior to that, plays and musicals were considered together for the Tony Award for Best Revival. The award is given to the best non-musical play that has appeared on Broadway in a previous production, or which is determined to be a &quot;classic&quot; or in the historical or popular repertoire despite not having been produced on Broadway. The award goes to the producers of the play. In addition, as of 2019, authors are also eligible for the award for shows that are considered revivals but that have not previously appeared on Broadway.
