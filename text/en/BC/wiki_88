<text>RedLibre is a non-profit project in which a combination of people, groups, entities, administrations or companies interested in the development and/or use of networks create a free, community data network that allows users to contribute content and share resources, among other uses.

RedLibre has been connected mainly to Wireless Communities, being a point of union and synergy for them. RedLibre also facilitates the tasks that the different organizations involved decide to perform together.

== History ==
The RedLibre project was created in September 2001 by Jaime Robles, based on the philosophy of the “Open Source” initiative. It was the first free network project in Spain and was inspired by similar movements that were appearing in the United States, such as New York Wireless and Seattle Wireless.

RedLibre was born with a much wider range than a “wireless city”, because it was evaluated that a project of this type would need many people (critical mass) to be able to succeed. Instead of creating a local project, the objective was to create a widespread project in which all Spanish-speaking people could gather and share ideas, projects, and more.

Later on, the National Association of Wireless Network Users (ANURI) was formed with the goal of offering legal support to the users of this type of network.

Since the inception of RedLibre in 2001-2002, hundreds of wireless communities have appeared worldwide. Everyone registered domains and created websites with “su_pueblowireless.net” or “su_ciudadwireless”; it was a moment of new hope and great movement. Many of these wireless communities, against their own philosophy, saw RedLibre as a threat; instead of uniting to generate a common network with RedLibre as a meeting point, they saw it as a project that intended to control the free networks in Spain. These issues slowed the growth and development of free networks in Spain since efforts were divided into small groups that worked independently, without the common goal of generating a free network.

When the issues with communities appeared (because everyone wanted to go off on their own), RedLibre changed its initial direction to try to adapt to the circumstances. Instead of directing itself as a community for people to unite and create a single project, it became a &quot;meta-community&quot; where support, media, and infrastructure were given to smaller groups. Communities that believed in a common free network gathered together and tried to agree on standardized goals, requirements, and actions.

In December of 2002, the City Council of Gran Canaria organized a meeting of free network communities in Las Palmas. Representatives from many local communities attended the meeting. The first-hand knowledge and the power of speech worked to bring positions closer together.

Devices that had been modified to work internally with Linux systems, referred to as LinuxAP, started to be used. These devices provided flexibility and an endless amount of new possibilities.

By 2003, many of the communities created in previous years had disappeared, and RedLibre also observed a lack of people and the circulation of mailing lists. There has always been a series of problems to solve in wireless communities:

* A lack of action, feeling of community, and teamwork.
* A lack of coordination between communities.
* Excessive expectations?

All of these problems had greatly diminished the number of communities that were active or growing.

In early 2004, with the arrival of new devices using Linux by Linksys and new firmware capable of equipping simple household wireless networks with capacities that none of the expensive professional routers had, RedLibre gave another boost to the creation of communities. Many members of RedLibre collaborated to create new firmware for Linksys routers or to improve existing ones (special mention to the ValenciaWireless team with their version of OpenWrt-eh or the DD-Guifi by Guifi.net).

In 2005 history repeated itself; many communities were once again isolated due to the lack of general collaboration, information, or experience. In addition, there was a technical problem with the RedLibre website and the partial loss of Web content or mailing lists with information from past years.

In 2006, a group of people returned to revive RedLibre, migrating the website from the old Phpnuke portal to the new Drupal CMS. These changes did not just apply to the Web or lists; the true intention was to revamp and update the project, with the experience that many years had given its members.

2007 was marked by several long discussions about what path RedLibre should take; about definitions of free networks or the adoption of a license that defines in-writing what a free wireless network really is (WirelessCommons). Thanks to the help of several volunteers, the Web began to have some movement.

== Goals ==

* Create a free network:

A free network is a network (in this case wireless) created, run, and managed by the users themselves. A free network is widespread; it does not belong to anyone in particular, but belongs to everyone. RedLibre offers free-of-charge access to one’s own network. Free access means that any person can gain access to any part of the network, at any moment.

* Bring technology closer to society and promote communication:

A free network promotes the technical training of users and brings new technologies closer to citizens, eliminating many of the barriers that currently exist in the full development of the information society. It also creates new channels of communication between people in a completely free way.

* Create an emergency network for use in the event of disaster:

In the event of disaster and the consequent collapse of regular communication networks, the free network would be an alternative communication that does not depend on regular transmission media and allows connection to the network at any and all moments. This allows RedLibre to serve as an emergency network and to attend to the needs for communication or voice and data transmission that may arise.

<doc id="253192" wikidata="Q43405" url="?curid=253192" title="Exhibitionism">
<text>Exhibitionism is the act of exposing in a public or semi-public context one&#x27;s intimate parts – for example, the breasts, genitals or buttocks. As used in psychology and psychiatry, it is substantially different. It refers to an uncontrollable urge to exhibit one&#x27;s genitals to an unsuspecting stranger, and is called an &quot;Exhibitionistic Disorder&quot; rather than simply exhibitionism. It is an obsessive compulsive paraphilic disorder, which typically involves men exposing themselves to women. It is considered a psychiatric disorder. Such patients need psychological/psychiatric treatment.

The practice may arise from a desire or compulsion to expose oneself in such a manner to groups of friends or acquaintances, or to strangers for their amusement or sexual satisfaction, or to shock the bystander. Exposing oneself only to an intimate partner is normally not regarded as exhibitionism. In law, the act of exhibitionism may be referred to as &quot;indecent exposure&quot; or &quot;exposing one&#x27;s person&quot;, or by other expressions.

==History==
Public exhibitionism by women has been recorded since classical times, often in the context of women shaming groups of men into committing, or inciting them to commit, some public action. The ancient Greek historian Herodotus gives an account of exhibitionistic behaviors from the fifth century BC in &quot;The Histories&quot;. Herodotus writes that:
A case of what appears to be exhibitionism in a clinical sense was recorded in a report by the Commission against Blasphemy in Venice in 1550. John Wilmot, 2nd Earl of Rochester was an early libertine in England, who was known for his exhibitionism.

In the United Kingdom, the 4th draft of the revised Vagrancy Act 1824 included an additional clause &quot;or openly and indecently exposing their persons&quot; which gave rise to difficulties because of its ill-defined scope. During the course of a subsequent debate on the topic in Parliament, the then-Home Secretary Robert Peel observed that &quot;there was not a more flagrant offence than that of indecently exposing the person which had been carried to an immense extent in the parks ... wanton exposure was a very different thing from accidental exposure&quot;.

The development of new technologies such as smartphones and tablets has permitted some exhibitionists to reorient their methods such as with nude selfies.

==Psychological aspects==
The term &quot;exhibitionist&quot; was first used in 1877 by French physician and psychiatrist Charles Lasègue. Various earlier medical-forensic texts discuss genital self-exhibition, however.

When exhibitionistic sexual interest is acted on with a non-consenting person or interferes with a person&#x27;s quality of life or normal functioning, it can be diagnosed as &quot;exhibitionistic disorder&quot; in the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders&quot;, fifth edition (DSM-5). The DSM states that the highest possible prevalence for exhibitionistic disorder in men is 2% to 4%. It is thought to be much less common in women.

In a Swedish survey, 2.1% of women and 4.1% of men admitted to becoming sexually aroused from the exposure of their genitals to a stranger.

A research team asked a sample of 185 exhibitionists, &quot;How would you have preferred a person to react if you were to expose your privates to him or her?&quot; The most common response was &quot;Would want to have sexual intercourse&quot; (35.1%), followed by &quot;No reaction necessary at all&quot; (19.5%), &quot;To show their privates also&quot; (15.1%), &quot;Admiration&quot; (14.1%), and &quot;Any reaction&quot; (11.9%). Only very few exhibitionists chose &quot;Anger and disgust&quot; (3.8%) or &quot;Fear&quot; (0.5%).

==Types of exposure==
Various types of behavior are classified as exhibitionism, including:

* Anasyrma: the lifting of the skirt when not wearing underwear, to expose genitals.
* Candaulism: when a person exposes their partner in a sexually provocative manner.
* Flashing:
**the momentary display of bare female breasts by a woman, with an up-and-down lifting of the shirt or bra
**or, the exposure of a man&#x27;s or woman&#x27;s genitalia in a similar manner
* Martymachlia: a paraphilia which involves sexual attraction to having others watch the execution of a sexual act.
* Mooning: the display of bare buttocks by pulling down of trousers and underwear. The act is most often done for the sake of humour, disparagement, or mockery.
* Reflectoporn: the act of stripping and taking a photograph using an object with a reflective surface as a mirror, then posting the image on the Internet in a public forum. Examples include &quot;images of naked men and women reflected in kettles, TVs, toasters and even knives and forks&quot;. The instance generally credited with starting the trend involved a man selling a kettle on an Australian auction site featuring a photograph where his naked body is clearly visible; other instances followed, and the specific term &quot;reflectoporn&quot; was coined by Chris Stevens of &quot;Internet Magazine&quot;. 
* Streaking: the act of running naked through a public place. The intent is not usually sexual but for shock value.
* Telephone scatologia: the act of making obscene phone calls to random or known recipients. Some researchers have claimed that this is a variant of exhibitionism, even though it has no in-person physical component.
* Underwear as outerwear: the intentional display of underwear as a fashion statement or to be provocative can also be seen as exhibitionism. When revealing thong underwear above pants or a skirt, the result is often called a whale tail.

The DSM-5 diagnosis for exhibitionistic disorder has three subtypes: exhibitionists interested in exposing themselves to non-consenting adults, to prepubescent children, or to both.

<text>Gualichu, or gualicho, in Mapuche mythology and mainly in the Tehuelche culture, was an evil spirit or demon, comparable but not similar to the Devil.

==Description==
As the Araucanians had not a properly called god of evil, Gualichu was not worshipped but feared. He was blamed for every disease or calamity, and all evil happenings were said to be caused by him. Gualichu could enter people&#x27;s body or objects and then an exorcism had to be performed to expel him (see also demon possession). He was a purely spiritual being and there is no depiction of him. He was believed to live underground.

By extension, the term applied to an evil spell or charm, or a jinx (&quot;It has Gualichu&quot;). In this sense the word has evolved into &quot;gualicho&quot; and still survives in the local folklore of Chile, Argentina, south of Brazil and Uruguay, in the form of a noun and a verb (&quot;engualichar&quot;, to cast an evil spell on somebody or something).

<text>James Tilly Matthews (1770 – 10 January 1815) was a British merchant of Welsh and Huguenot descent who was committed to the Bethlem Royal Hospital in 1797 after developing politically charged delusions which led him to disrupt sessions of the House of Commons of Great Britain. These delusions were documented in an 1810 book titled &quot;Illustrations of Madness&quot;, including Matthews&#x27; belief that a group of spies were using an &quot;air loom&quot; to secretly torment him from a distance. Modern historians consider Matthews to be the first fully documented case of schizophrenia.

==Life==

===Voyage to France===
In the early 1790s, concerned at the likelihood of war between Britain and France, Matthews travelled to France with the radical David Williams, who was acquainted with such Girondins as Jacques Pierre Brissot and Charles-François Lebrun. Williams made efforts at mediation which failed, whereupon Matthews took the lead. He gained the trust of the French government for a short time.

On 2 June 1793 the Girondists were displaced by the Jacobins and Matthews fell under suspicion for his Girondist associations and also because he was suspected of being a double agent. He was arrested and imprisoned for three years during the height of The Terror and was reportedly terrified of the guillotine, like all others. This lasted until 1796 when the French authorities concluded that he was a lunatic and released him.

===Committal===
Returning to London, Matthews wrote two letters to Lord Liverpool, in which he accused the Home Secretary of treason and complained about conspiracies directed against his life. After interrupting a debate in the House of Commons by shouting &quot;Treason&quot; at Lord Liverpool from the Public Gallery, he was arrested and held at Tothill Fields Bridewell, a secure house of correction in Tothill Fields, Westminster before being admitted to the Bethlem (Bedlam) hospital on 28 January 1797. Upon examination he declared that he had taken part in secret affairs of state (referring to his efforts in France), but had been betrayed and abandoned by William Pitt&#x27;s administration.

In 1809 his family and friends petitioned for his release, on the grounds that he was no longer insane, but their petition was rejected by the Bethlem authorities. They therefore took out a suit of habeas corpus and two doctors, George Birkbeck and Henry Clutterbuck examined Matthews, declaring him sane. John Haslam, the resident apothecary at Bethlem, begged to differ and maintained that Matthews&#x27; delusions, particularly on political matters, rendered him a danger both to public figures and the general public.

===&quot;Illustrations of Madness&quot;===

In 1810 John Haslam produced the book &quot;Illustrations of Madness&quot; (original title: &quot;Illustrations of Madness: Exhibiting a Singular Case of Insanity, And a No Less Remarkable Difference in Medical Opinions: Developing the Nature of An Assailment, And the Manner of Working Events; with a Description of Tortures Experienced by Bomb-Bursting, Lobster-Cracking and Lengthening the Brain. Embellished with a Curious Plate&quot;). Haslam intended to settle the dispute over Matthews&#x27; sanity; his book contains verbatim accounts of Matthew&#x27;s beliefs and hallucinatory experiences and is considered the original description of the symptoms of paranoid schizophrenia. The book documented the first full study of a single psychiatric patient in medical history and has become a classic in the medical literature.

===The &quot;Air Loom&quot;===
Matthews believed that a gang of criminals and spies skilled in pneumatic chemistry had taken up residence at London Wall in Moorfields (close to Bethlem) and were tormenting him by means of rays emitted by a machine called the &quot;Air Loom&quot; or gaseous charge generator. The torments induced by the rays included &quot;Lobster-cracking&quot;, during which the circulation of the blood was prevented by a magnetic field; &quot;Stomach-skinning&quot; and &quot;Apoplexy-working with the nutmeg grater&quot; which involved the introduction of fluids into the skull. His persecutors bore such names as &quot;the Middleman&quot; (who operated the Air Loom), &quot;the Glove Woman&quot; and &quot;Sir Archy&quot; (who acted as &quot;repeaters&quot; or &quot;active worriers&quot; to enhance Matthews&#x27; torment or record the machine&#x27;s activities) and their leader, a man called &quot;Bill, or the King&quot;.

Matthews&#x27; delusions had a definite political slant: he claimed that the purpose of this gang was espionage, and that there were many other such gangs armed with Air Looms all over London, using &quot;pneumatic practitioners&quot; to &quot;premagnetize&quot; potential victims with &quot;volatile magnetic fluid&quot;. According to Matthews, their chief targets (apart from himself) were leading government figures. By means of their &quot;rays&quot; they could influence ministers&#x27; thoughts and read their minds. Matthews declared that William Pitt was &quot;not half&quot; susceptible to these attacks and held that these gangs were responsible for the British military disasters at Buenos Aires in 1807 and Walcheren in 1809 and also for the Nore Mutiny of 1797.

In 1814 Matthews was moved to &quot;Fox&#x27;s London House&quot;, a private asylum in Hackney, where he became a popular and trusted patient. His delusions appeared to have stopped. The asylum&#x27;s owner, Dr. Fox, regarded him as sane. Matthews assisted with bookkeeping and gardening until his death on 10 January 1815.

==Significance of the Air Loom Gang affair==
Although it is impossible to make an unequivocal diagnosis of a person long since deceased, Matthews&#x27; description of his torment by the &quot;Air Loom Gang&quot; reads as a classic example of paranoid persecutory delusions experienced as part of a psychotic episode. From this, it can be concluded that his disorder was most likely schizophrenia, although retrospective diagnoses should be treated with caution. Modern historians consider Matthews to be the first fully documented case of schizophrenia.

It should also be noted that while Haslam kept notes on Matthews, Matthews kept notes on Haslam and his treatment in Bethlem. This formed part of the evidence looked at by the House of Commons &#x27;Committee On the Better Regulation of Madhouses in England&#x27; in 1815, the findings of which led to Haslam&#x27;s dismissal and reform of the treatment of patients in the Bethlem Hospital.

Matthews was also important in the history of psychiatry for more practical reasons. During his involuntary confinement he took part in a public competition to design plans for the rebuilding of Bethlem hospital. Bethlem&#x27;s governors thought so well of the 46 pages of designs submitted by Matthews that they paid him £50 () and the drawings finally used to build the new hospital show some features proposed by Matthews.

==Fictional representations==
*&quot;Haslam&#x27;s Key&quot;, a play written by journalist Danny O&#x27;Brien, imagined Matthews as a forerunner of modern science fiction authors. The titular &quot;key&quot; was a wooden spoon-like device invented by John Haslam, the documenter of Matthew&#x27;s delusions, which was used to force-feed Bedlam patients.
*In 2002, the British artist Rod Dickinson built a re-creation of the air loom from Matthews&#x27; original plans.
*Greg Hollingshead&#x27;s novel &quot;Bedlam&quot; (2004) concerns the changing relationship between John Haslam and Matthews and is narrated in first-person from the perspective of Haslam, Matthews, and Matthews&#x27; wife.
*The &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Lab Rats&quot; (2007), Grissom uses Matthews&#x27; condition as an analogy in describing The Miniature Killer, a serial killer obsessed with bleach.
*Robert Rankin&#x27;s 2007 novel &quot;The Da-da-de-da-da Code&quot; features a group of villains known as the Air Loom Gang, as well as a doctor named Doctor Archy, a pub called &quot;The Middle Man&quot; and a beer called &quot;King Billy&quot;.
* The game &quot;&quot; from 2013 makes several references to both James Tilly Matthews, the Air Loom and Bedlam.

<doc id="253197" wikidata="Q3043711" url="?curid=253197" title="William Farr">
<text>William Farr CB (30 November 1807 – 14 April 1883) was a British epidemiologist, regarded as one of the founders of medical statistics.

==Early life==
William Farr was born in Kenley, Shropshire, to poor parents. He was effectively adopted by a local squire, Joseph Pryce, when Farr and his family moved to Dorrington. In 1826 he took a job as a dresser (surgeon&#x27;s assistant) in the Salop Infirmary in Shrewsbury and served a nominal apprenticeship to an apothecary. Pryce died in November 1828, and left Farr £500 (), which allowed him to study medicine in France and Switzerland. In Paris he heard Pierre Charles Alexandre Louis lecture.

Farr returned to England in 1831 and continued his studies at University College London, qualifying as a licentiate of the Society of Apothecaries in March 1832. He married in 1833 and started a medical practice in Fitzroy Square, London. He became involved in medical journalism and statistics.

==General Register Office==

In 1837 the General Register Office (GRO) took on the responsibility for the United Kingdom Census 1841. Farr was hired there, initially on a temporary basis to handle data from vital registration. Then, with a recommendation from Edwin Chadwick and backing from Neil Arnott, Farr secured another post in the GRO as the first compiler of scientific abstracts (i.e. a statistician). Chadwick and Farr had an agenda, demography aimed at public health, and the support of the initial Registrar General Thomas Henry Lister. Lister worked with Farr on the census design, to forward the programme.

Farr was responsible for the collection of official medical statistics in England and Wales. His most important contribution was to set up a system for routinely recording the causes of death. For example, for the first time it allowed the mortality rates of different occupations to be compared.

==Learned societies and associations==
In 1839, Farr joined the Statistical Society, in which he played an active part as treasurer, vice-president and president over the years. In 1855 he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society. He was involved in the Social Science Association from its foundation in 1857, taking part in its Quarantine Committee and Committee on Trades&#x27; Societies and Strikes.

== Law of epidemics ==

In 1840, Farr submitted a letter to the &quot;Annual Report of the Registrar General of Births, Deaths and Marriages in England&quot;. In that letter, he applied mathematics to the records of deaths during a recent smallpox epidemic, proposing that:

&quot;If the latent cause of epidemics cannot be discovered, the mode in which it operates may be investigated. The laws of its action may be determined by observation, as well as the circumstances in which epidemics arise, or by which they may be controlled.&quot;

He showed that during the smallpox epidemic, a plot of the number of deaths per quarter followed a roughly bell-shaped or &quot;normal curve&quot;, and that recent epidemics of other diseases had followed a similar pattern.

==Research on cholera==
There was a major outbreak of cholera in London in 1849 which killed around 15,000 people. Early industrialisation had made London the most populous city in the world at the time, and the River Thames was heavily polluted with untreated sewage. Farr subscribed to the conventional theory that cholera was carried by polluted air rather than water – the miasmic theory. In addition, through his analysis of several variables and their association with death from cholera, Farr held the belief that elevation was the major contributor to the occurrence of the disease. He also presented how topographical features are able to prevent certain diseases similarly to immunization.

During the 1853-54 epidemic, Farr gathered more statistical evidence. During focused study of the 1854 Broad Street cholera outbreak, the physician John Snow used data supplied by the GRO and applied the (now accepted) mechanism for transmission he had proposed in 1849: people were infected by swallowing something, and it multiplied in the intestines. Snow also examined mortality statistics compiled by the GRO for people supplied with water from two companies in South London – the Southwark &amp; Vauxhall Company (which drew contaminated water from low in the Thames basin) and the Lambeth Water Company (which drew cleaner water from further up the Thames) – and found Southwark &amp; Vauxhall customers were especially likely to suffer. 
Farr took part in the General Board of Health&#x27;s 1854 Committee for Scientific Enquiries. The conventional explanation for cholera was still multifactorial; Snow&#x27;s view of cholera as solely caused by a pathogen was not accepted, though his evidence was taken seriously. Farr&#x27;s research was detailed and showed an inverse correlation of mortality and elevation.

There was a further epidemic in 1866, by which time Snow had died, and Farr had accepted Snow&#x27;s explanation. He produced a monograph which showed that mortality was extremely high for people who drew their water from the Old Ford Reservoir in East London. Farr&#x27;s work was then considered conclusive.

==Later life==
In 1858, he performed a study on the correlation of health and marriage condition, and found that health decreases from the married to the unmarried to the widowed. In the period 1857–9 the Office ordered a difference engine, a model designed by Swedish followers of Charles Babbage. The intended application was the &quot;British Life Table&quot;.
In 1862 Farr was paid £300 () for producing a report on the Metropolitan Police Superannuation Fund, an early pension provision for that organisation. He also served as a commissioner in the 1871 census, retiring from the General Register Office in 1879 after he was not given the post of Registrar General, the position going to Sir Brydges Henniker. The same year, Farr received as honours a Companionship of the Bath and the Gold Medal of the British Medical Association for his work in the field of biostatistics.

In his last years, Farr&#x27;s approach had become obsolescent. Bacteriology had changed the face of the medical issues, and statistics became an increasingly mathematic tool. Medical reformers, too, changed approach, expecting less from legislation and central government.

Farr died aged 75 at his home in Maida Vale, London, and was buried in the churchyard at Holy Trinity, Bromley Common.

==Works==
In 1837 Farr wrote the chapter &quot;Vital Statistics&quot; for John Ramsey McCulloch&#x27;s &quot;Statistical Account of the British Empire&quot;. In January 1837 he established the &quot;British Annals of Medicine, Pharmacy, Vital Statistics, and General Science&quot;, discontinued in August of that year. He revised a book of James Fernandez Clarke on tuberculosis.

Farr exploited his GRO post compiling abstracts in a way that went beyond the original job description. In so doing he applied the techniques of the English actuary Benjamin Gompertz (the Gompertz curve), and the closely allied statistical &quot;law of mortality&quot; of his fellow actuary Thomas Rowe Edmonds. Farr, by relying on the existing mathematical model of mortality, could use data sampling to cut back the required computation. From the GRO data he constructed a series of national life tables.

The theory of zymotic disease was Farr&#x27;s contribution to the debate on aetiology. He identified urbanisation and population density as public health issues. In terms of nosology he classed epidemic, endemic and contagious diseases as &quot;zymotic&quot;, seen as diseases of filth and overcrowding.

A selection of his statistical writings was published in 1885, edited by Noël Humphreys.

==In drama==
In &quot;The Sewer King&quot;, an episode in the 2003 British television documentary series &quot;Seven Wonders of the Industrial World&quot;, Farr was played by Norman Lovett.

==Family==
Farr&#x27;s first wife, whom he married in 1833, had the surname Langford; she died of tuberculosis in 1837. He married Mary Elizabeth Whittal in 1842, and they had eight children. In 1880 a public testimonial was collected to provide for his daughters after he lost money through unwise investments. 

One daughter, Henrietta, was married to painter and illustrator Henry Marriott Paget, the older brother of illustrators Sidney and Walter Paget. Another daughter, Florence Farr, was also a painter and artist and a model of many famous art deco works of art. The Pagets as well as the Farr sisters lived and worked in Bedford Park, the famous artist&#x27;s colony in West London.

== Recognition ==
Farr&#x27;s name features on the Frieze of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine. Twenty-three names of public health and tropical medicine pioneers were chosen to appear on the School building in Keppel Street when it was constructed in 1926.

In 1884, &quot;Farriolla&quot;, which is a genus of fungi in the Ascomycota phylum, was named in William Farr&#x27;s honour.

<text>The Chinese Soviet Republic (CSR) was a state within China, proclaimed on 7 November 1931 by Chinese Communist Party (CCP) leaders Mao Zedong and Zhu De in the early stages of the Chinese Civil War. The discontiguous territories of the CSR included 18 provinces and 4 counties under the Communists&#x27; control. The CSR&#x27;s government was located in its largest component territory, the Jiangxi Soviet in southeastern China, with its capital city at Ruijin. Due to the importance of the Jiangxi Soviet in the CSR&#x27;s early history, the name &quot;Jiangxi Soviet&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the CSR as a whole. Other component territories of the CSR included the Minzhegan, Xianggan, Xiang&#x27;egang, Honghu, Xiang&#x27;echuanqian, Eyuwan, Eyushan, Shaanxi-Gansu, Sichuan-Shaanxi, and Hailufeng Soviets.

Mao Zedong was both CSR state chairman and prime minister; he commanded the state and its government. Mao&#x27;s tenure as commander of a &quot;small state within a state&quot; gave him experience in mobile warfare and peasant organization, which helped him lead the Chinese Communists to victory in 1949. 

The Encirclement Campaigns initiated by the Kuomintang in 1934 forced the CCP to abandon most of the soviets in southern China. The CCP (including the leadership of the CSR) embarked on the Long March from southern China to the Yan&#x27;an Soviet, where a rump CSR continued to exist. A complex series of events in 1936 culminated in the Xi&#x27;an Incident, in which Chiang Kai-shek was kidnapped and forced to negotiate with the CCP. The CCP offered to abolish the CSR and put the Chinese Red Army commanded (nominally) by the Kuomintang in exchange for autonomy and an alliance against Japan. These negotiations were successful, and eventually resulted in the creation of the Second United Front. The CSR was officially dissolved on 22 September 1937 and the Yan&#x27;an Soviet was reconstituted officially as the Shaan-Gan-Ning and Jin-Cha-Ji Border Regions.

==History==
=== Background ===

During the First United Front between the Communist Party and the Kuomintang, the two parties embarked on the Northern Expedition in an effort to unify China with a single government. In 1927, the KMT broke the United Front with the Shanghai Massacre and violently suppressed the Communists. The Communists as well as a few army units loyal to them fled urban areas into the countryside, where they founded the Chinese Workers and Peasants&#x27; Red Army to wage civil war. A large group in southern China commanded by Mao Zedong established a base in the remote Jinggang Mountains. A Kuomintang counterinsurgency campaign forced Mao and his group to relocate once again, and they moved into the border region between Jiangxi and Fujian provinces.

Meanwhile, Communists from other areas of China followed a similar pattern of retreat into the countryside. In order to rebuild the party&#x27;s strength, the 6th National Congress ordered these rural cadres to organize soviet governments. Beginning in 1929, soviets began to be created in isolated regions across the country, including rural Guangxi, the Eyuwan border area, and the Xiangegan border area. Mao&#x27;s group founded the Jiangxi Soviet, which became the largest and best administered soviet thanks to the number of Communist cadres from across the country that took refuge there. Although the Central Committee of the Communist Party was still underground in Shanghai during this period, the center of political gravity had begun to shift to Mao in Jiangxi.

=== Establishment and growth ===

In 1931, the Communist Party decided to consolidate these isolated base areas into a single state, the Chinese Soviet Republic. On 7 November 1931 (the anniversary of the 1917 Russian October Revolution) a National Soviet People&#x27;s Delegates Conference was held in Ruijin, the capital of the Jiangxi Soviet. The Conference held a formal opening ceremony for the CSR which included a military parade. Notably, communications between the far-flung soviets were so poor (due to their isolation and intense pressure from the Kuomintang) that the second-largest soviet, in Eyuwan, failed to send delegates. Instead, it held its own conference.

With Mao Zedong as both head of state () and head of government (), the CSR gradually expanded. The CSR reached its peak in 1933. It governed a population which exceeded 3.4 million in an area of approximately 70,000 square kilometers (although the isolated soviets were never connected into one contiguous piece of territory).

=== Encirclement campaigns ===
The National Revolutionary Army conducted a series of campaigns against the various soviets of the CSR known as the &quot;encirclement campaigns&quot;. The Jiangxi Soviet survived the first, second and third encirclement campaigns thanks to the use of flexible guerrilla tactics. However, after the third counter-encirclement campaign Mao was replaced by Wang Ming, a Chinese communist returning from the Soviet Union. The Chinese Red Army was commanded by a three-man committee, which included Wang Ming&#x27;s associates Otto Braun (a Comintern military advisor), Bo Gu and Zhou Enlai. The CSR then began a rapid decline, due to its extreme left-wing governance and incompetent military command. The new leadership could not rid itself of Mao&#x27;s influence (which continued during the fourth encirclement campaign), which temporarily protected the communists. However, due to the dominance of the new communist leadership after the fourth counter-encirclement campaign, the Red Army was nearly halved. Most of its equipment was lost during Chiang&#x27;s fifth encirclement campaign; this began in 1933 and was orchestrated by Chiang&#x27;s newly-hired Nazi advisors who developed a strategy of building fortified blockhouses to advance the encirclement.

This was effective; in an effort to break the blockade the Red Army besieged the forts many times, suffering heavy casualties and only limited success. As a result, the CSR shrank significantly due to the Chinese Red Army&#x27;s manpower and material losses.

===The Long March===

Since the Jiangxi Soviet could not be held, the Standing Committee appointed Bo (responsible for politics), Braun (responsible for military strategy), and Zhou (responsible for the implementation of military planning) to organize an evacuation. The Communists managed to successfully hide their intentions from the besieging Nationalist forces for long enough to execute a successful breakout. On October 16, 1934, a force of about 130,000 soldiers and civilians under Bo Gu and Otto Braun attacked the line of Kuomintang positions near Yudu. More than 86,000 troops, 11,000 administrative personnel and thousands of civilian porters actually completed the breakout; the remainder, largely wounded or ill soldiers, continued to fight a delaying action after the main force had left, and then dispersed into the countryside. After passing through three of the four blockhouse fortifications needed to escape Chiang&#x27;s encirclement, the Red Army was finally intercepted by regular Nationalist troops, and suffered heavy casualties. Of the 86,000 Communists who attempted to break out of Jiangxi with the First Red Army, only 36,000 successfully escaped. Due to the low morale within the Red Army at the time, it is not possible to know what proportion of these losses were due to military casualties, and which proportion were due to desertion. The conditions of the Red Army&#x27;s forced withdrawal demoralized some Communist leaders (particularly Bo Gu and Otto Braun), but Zhou remained calm and retained his command.

This retreat marked the beginning of what would become known as the Long March. During the course of the next two years, Communist forces abandoned almost all of their soviets in southern China that had made up the core of the CSR. The survivors went into hiding or followed Mao to Yan&#x27;an, where they took refuge in the Shaan-Gan-Ning Border Region.

=== Dissolution ===
The Chinese Soviet Republic continued to exist formally even after the Long March, since the Communists still controlled some areas such as the Hubei-Henan-Shaanxi Soviet. Bao&#x27;an was, for a time, the capital until the Communist government was moved to the Yan&#x27;an Soviet. The Chinese Soviet Republic was dissolved on 22 September 1937 when the Chinese Communist Party issued, in the Second United Front, its manifesto on unity with the Kuomintang; the Second Sino-Japanese War was only a few weeks old. The Chinese Communist Party remained in &quot;de facto&quot; control of Yan&#x27;an, which was its stronghold for the remainder of the war with Japan.

== Administration ==

The CSR had a central government as well as local and regional governments. It operated institutions including an education system and court system. The CSR also issued currency. It enacted the Constitutional Guideline of CSR in 1934.

===Land reform===
The most important policy implemented by the soviet governments was land redistribution, which destroyed the landlord-dominated political economy which had existed previously. The CSR issued the 1931 Land Law, which required:

The property of rich peasants was also confiscated, although rich peasants were entitled to receive land of lesser quality if they farmed it themselves. By 1932, the Communist Party had equalized landholding and eliminated debt within the CSR. Although the 1931 Land Law remained the official policy in the CSR&#x27;s territory until the Nationalists&#x27; defeat of the CSR in 1934, after 1932, the Communist Party was more radical in its class analysis, resulting in formerly middle peasants being viewed as rich peasants.

The Chinese Red Army had modern communications technology (telephones, telegraph and radio, which the warlords&#x27; armies lacked), and transmitted wireless coded messages while breaking nationalist codes. At the time, only Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s army could match the communist forces.

The CSR declared itself a government of all Chinese workers, Red Army soldiers, and the masses. CSR policy was in large part carried out by mass organizations, particularly the Poor Peasants League, which was composed entirely of poor peasants and farm laborers. Poor peasants composed a majority of the membership of all CSR associations or state bodies.

The CSR issued regulations barring landlords, rich peasants, merchants, religious leaders, and Kuomintang members from participating in its elections. Landlords and rich peasants were barred from joining the biggest civil organizations in the CSR, the Anti-Imperialist League and the Soviet Protection League. 

===Finance===
On 1 February 1932, the Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank was established, with Mao Zemin as president. The CSR Central Mint issued three types of currency: a paper bill, a copper coin and a silver dollar.

The CSR was funded primarily by tax income on grain and rice. It also received voluntary contributions from its core political constituency, the peasantry. During the period 1931 to 1934, the CSR issued three series of government bonds to further finance its operations.

====Banknotes====
The Central Mint briefly issued both paper bills and copper coins. Neither circulated for long, primarily because the currency could not be used in the rest of China. The paper bill had &quot;Chinese Soviet Republic National Bank&quot; () printed on the bill in traditional Chinese characters and a picture of Vladimir Lenin.

====Copper coins====
Like the paper bill, copper coins issued by the Central Mint also had &quot;Chinese Soviet Republic&quot; (中華蘇維埃共和國) engraved in traditional Chinese. Since coins last longer than paper bills, these coins were issued (and circulated) in a much greater quantity. However, these coins are rarer than the paper bill; copper was needed for ammunition, and these copper coins were recalled and replaced by silver dollars.

====Silver dollars====
The predominant currency produced by the Central Mint was the silver dollar. Unlike the bills and copper coins, the silver dollars had no communist symbols; they were a copy of silver dollars produced by other mints in China (including the popular coin with the head of Yuan Shikai and the eagle silver dollar of the Mexican peso). This, and the fact that the coin was made of silver, enabled them to be circulated in the rest of China; thus, it was the currency of choice.

When the Chinese Red Army&#x27;s First Front began its Long March in October 1934, the Communist bank was part of the retreating force; fourteen bank employees, over a hundred coolies and a company of soldiers escorted them with the money and mint machinery. An important duty of the bank was, when the Chinese Red Army stayed in a location for longer than a day, to have the local populace exchange Communist paper bills and copper coins for currency used in the nationalist-controlled regions to avoid prosecution by the nationalists after the Communists left. The Zunyi Conference decided that carrying the entire bank on the march was impractical, and on 29 January 1935, at Tucheng () the bank employees burned all Communist paper bills and destroyed the mint machinery. By the end of the Long March in October 1935, only eight of the original fourteen employees were left; the other six had died along the way.

===Taxation===
In November 1931, the National Tax Bureau was founded. In 2002, the original building was renovated for the public.

===Postage stamps===
The Directorate General of Chinese Soviet Posts was founded in Ruijin on 1 May 1932. The first stamps were designed by Huang Yaguang and printed lithographically by the Printing House of the Ministry of Finance in Ruijin. White paper or newspaper was used. They were imperforate, and denominated in the Chinese Soviet silver-dollar currency. They are fairly rare, and sought after by collectors. There are also many forgeries and bogus issues imitating early stamps from the Communist areas.

=== Intelligence ===

Zhou Enlai had planted more than a dozen moles in Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s inner circle, including his general headquarters at Nanchang. One of Zhou&#x27;s most important agents, Mo Xiong, was not a communist; however, his contributions saved the Chinese Communist Party and the Chinese Red Army.

With recommendations from Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s secretary-general Yang Yongtai (who was unaware of Mo&#x27;s Communist activities), Mo rose in Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s regime and became an important member in his general headquarters during the early 1930s. In January 1934, Chiang Kai-shek appointed him administrator and commander-in-chief of the Fourth Special District in northern Jiangxi. Mo used his position to plant more than a dozen Communist agents in Chiang&#x27;s general headquarters, including Liu Yafo () (who introduced the Chinese Communist Party), Xiang Yunian () (his Communist handler, whom he hired as his secretary) and Lu Zhiying (acting head of the spy ring, under the command of Zhou Enlai).

After successfully besieging the Ruijin area (the CSR capital) and occupying most of the CSR itself, Chiang was confident that he could defeat the Communists in a final decisive strike. In late September 1934 he distributed his top-secret &quot;Iron Bucket Plan&quot; to general headquarters at Lushan (the summer substitute for Nanchang), which detailed the final push to annihilate the Communist forces. Chiang planned 30 blockade lines supported by 30 barbed wire fences (most electrified) in a radius around Ruijin to starve the Communists. In addition, more than 1,000 trucks were to be mobilized in a rapid-reaction force to prevent a Communist breakout. Realizing the certainty of Communist annihilation, Mo Xiong handed the several-kilogram document to Xiang Yunian () the same night—risking his life and those of his family.

With help from Liu Yafo () and Lu Zhiying, Communist agents copied the intelligence into four dictionaries and Xiang Yunian () was tasked with bringing it to the CSR. The trip was hazardous, since the nationalist forces arrested and executed anyone attempting to cross the blockade. Xiang Yunian () hid in the mountains, knocking out four of his teeth with a rock and causing his face to swell. Disguised as a beggar, he tore off the covers of the four dictionaries and covered them with spoiled food at the bottom of his bag. Crossing several blockade lines, he reached Ruijin on 7 October 1934. The intelligence provided by Mo Xiong convinced the Communists in the CSR to abandon their base and retreat before Chiang could reinforce his blockade lines with barbed-wire fences. They mobilized trucks and troops, saving themselves from annihilation.

== Historiography ==
The official history in the People&#x27;s Republic of China views the Chinese Soviet Republic positively, although it is recognized that the regime was ultimately a failure. In a speech on the 80th anniversary of the CSR&#x27;s founding, Xi Jinping focused on the fact that the CSR was attempting to do something novel, stating &quot;The Chinese Soviet Republic was the first national workers&#x27; and peasants&#x27; regime in Chinese history.&quot; The efforts of the CSR government are seen as having built the reputation of the CCP and strengthened the Chinese Red Army. Commentaries usually tout the CSR as an experiment that paved the way for the success of the later People&#x27;s Republic. In the &quot;Historical Picture Book of the Chinese Soviet Republic&quot;, the Ganzhou Municipal Committee of the CCP called the CSR a &quot;great rehearsal for the People&#x27;s Republic of China.&quot;

<text>The Seagram Company Ltd. (which traded as Seagram&#x27;s) was a Canadian multinational conglomerate formerly headquartered in Montreal, Quebec. Originally a distiller of Canadian whisky based in Waterloo, Ontario, it was in the 1990s the largest owner of alcoholic beverage brands in the world.

Toward the end of its independent existence, it also controlled various entertainment and other business ventures. Its purchase of MCA Inc., whose assets included Universal Pictures and its theme parks, was financed through the sale of Seagram&#x27;s 25% holding of chemical company DuPont, a position it acquired in 1981.

Unable to maintain financial stability, Seagram later imploded, with its beverage assets sold to industry titans Diageo and Pernod Ricard. Universal&#x27;s television holdings were sold to Barry Diller, and the balance of the Universal entertainment empire and what was Seagram was sold to French conglomerate Vivendi in 2000.

==History==
In 1857, Waterloo Distillery was founded in Waterloo, Ontario, Canada. Joseph E. Seagram became a partner with George Randall, William Roos and William Hespeler in 1869 and sole owner in 1883, and the company became known as Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons. Many decades later, in 1924, Samuel Bronfman and his brothers founded Distillers Corporation Limited, in Montreal, which enjoyed substantial growth in the 1920s, in part due to Prohibition instituted in the United States in 1919. The Distillers Corporation Limited name was derived from a United Kingdom company called Distillers Company Limited, which controlled the leading brands of whisky in the UK, and which was doing business with the Bronfmans.

In 1923, the Bronfmans purchased the Greenbrier Distillery in the United States, dismantled it, shipped it to Canada, and reassembled it in LaSalle, Quebec. The Bronfmans shipped liquor from Canada to the French-controlled overseas collectivity Saint Pierre and Miquelon off the then-Dominion of Newfoundland, which was then shipped by bootleggers to rum rows in New York, New Jersey and other states.

In 1928, a few years after the death of Joseph E. Seagram in 1919, the Distillers Corporation acquired Joseph E. Seagram &amp; Sons from heir and President Edward F. Seagram; the merged company retained the Seagram name. The company was prepared for the end of Prohibition in 1933 with an ample stock of aged whiskeys, ready to sell to the newly-opened American market.

Although he was never convicted of criminal activity, Samuel Bronfman&#x27;s dealings with bootleggers during the Prohibition-era in the United States have been researched by various historians and are documented in various peer-reviewed articles.

In the 1930s, when Seagram established business in the United States, it paid a fine of $1.5 million to the US government to settle delinquent excise taxes on liquor illegally exported to the US during Prohibition. The US government had originally asked for $60 million.

From the 1950s, most of Distillers-Seagram was owned by the four children of Samuel Bronfman, through their holding company Cemp Investments. The three most popular Seagram distilled products in the 1960s through 1990s were Seven Crown, VO, and Crown Royal.

In 1963, Seagram purchased the Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company for $61 million in cash and a $216 million production payment sale to Glanville Minerals Corporation of New York. Texas Pacific Coal and Oil Company was merged Frankfort Oil Company, another oil-producing company owned by Seagram. The new firm was named Texas Pacific Oil Company. In 1980, the Bronfman heirs sold the Texas Pacific Oil holdings to Sun Oil Co. for $2.3 billion.

After the death of Samuel Bronfman in 1971, Edgar Bronfman Sr. was named chairman and chief executive officer (CEO) until June 1994 when his son, Edgar Bronfman Jr., was appointed CEO.

In 1978, Seagram&#x27;s took over the Stonyfell winery in the eastern foothills of Adelaide from Dalgety Australia, around which time the winemaking part of the business at Stonyfell was wound up.

During the early 1980s, Seagram&#x27;s attempted to acquire St. Joe Minerals. However, it was outbid by Fluor Corporation.

In 1981, cash-rich and wanting to diversify, the U.S.-based subsidiary Seagram Company Ltd. attempted to engineer a takeover of Conoco Inc., a major American oil and gas producing company. Although Seagram acquired a 32.2% stake in Conoco, DuPont was brought in as a white knight by the oil company and entered the bidding war. Seagram lost the bidding war, though in exchange for its stake in Conoco it became a 24.3% owner of DuPont. By 1995, Seagram was DuPont&#x27;s largest single shareholder with four seats on its board.

In 1986, the company started a TV commercial campaign advertising its Golden wine cooler products. With Bruce Willis as pitchman, Seagram rose from fifth place among distillers to first in just two years.

In 1987, Seagram engineered a $1.2 billion takeover of French cognac maker Martell &amp; Cie. 

In 1995, Edgar Bronfman Jr. was eager to enter the film and electronic media business. On April 6, 1995, after being approached by Bronfman, DuPont announced a deal whereby the company would buy back its shares from Seagram for $US9 billion. Seagram was heavily criticized by the investment community; the 24.3% stake in DuPont accounted for 70% of Seagram&#x27;s earnings. Standard &amp; Poor&#x27;s took the unusual step of stating that the sale of the DuPont interest could result in a downgrade of Seagram&#x27;s more than $4.2 billion of long-term debt. Bronfman used the proceeds of the sale to acquire a controlling interest in MCA from Matsushita, whose assets included Universal Pictures and its theme parks a year after.

Later in 1998, Seagram purchased PolyGram and scattered the assets within Universal Studios, notably both Universal Music Group and Universal Pictures.

The same year, Seagram sold to PepsiCo its juice business Tropicana Products that it acquired in 1988 for $3.1 billion.

In 2000, Seagram&#x27;s entertainment division was sold to Vivendi, and, after Vivendi had acquired French media giant Groupe Canal+, it became part of the new company, Vivendi Universal, on 11 December 2000.

The beverage division was sold to Diageo and Pernod Ricard. By the time Vivendi began auctioning off Seagram&#x27;s beverages business, the once-renowned operation consisted of around 180 alcoholic drink brands and brand extensions in addition to its original high-profile brand names.

In 2002, The Coca-Cola Company acquired Seagram&#x27;s mixers (ginger ale, tonic water, club soda and seltzer water) from Pernod Ricard and Diageo, as well as signing a long-term agreement to use the Seagram name from Pernod Ricard for these products.

A licence from Pernod Ricard to produce Seagram&#x27;s Cooler Escapes and Seagram&#x27;s malt-beverage brands has been held by North American Breweries (formerly KPS) since 2009.

On April 19, 2006, Pernod Ricard announced that they would be closing the former Seagram distillery in Lawrenceburg, Indiana, US. The distillery was sold in 2007 to CL Financial, a holding company based in Trinidad and Tobago which then collapsed and required government intervention. They operated the distillery as Lawrenceburg Distillers Indiana. In December 2011, the distillery was purchased by MGP Ingredients, headquartered in Atchison, Kansas. It is now known as MGP of Indiana, and continues to be the source of the components of Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crown, now owned by Diageo.

In a 2013 interview with &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, Charles Bronfman (uncle of Edgar Jr.) stated about the decisions leading to the demise of Seagram: &quot;It was a disaster, it is a disaster, it will be a disaster. It was a family tragedy.&quot;

== Legacy ==

The Seagram name survives today in various well-known drinks. Seagram&#x27;s Seven Crown, used to make the American cocktail, 7 and 7, is produced by Diageo, while Seagram&#x27;s V.O. is produced by Sazerac. Several brands of coolers are produced under the Seagram name as of 2022: Seagram&#x27;s Escapes are produced by Genesee Brewing for the American market, while Seagram Island Time is produced by Waterloo Brewing for the Canadian market. The Coca-Cola Company currently produces Seagram&#x27;s Ginger Ale soda line since 2002 &amp; made it widely available in 2011.

Seagram&#x27;s House, the former company headquarters in Montreal, was donated to McGill University by Vivendi Universal in 2002, then renamed Martlet House. The landmarked Seagram Building, once the company&#x27;s American headquarters in New York City, was commissioned by Phyllis Lambert, daughter of Seagram CEO Samuel Bronfman, and designed by architect Ludwig Mies van der Rohe with Philip Johnson. Regarded as one of the most notable examples of the functionalist aesthetic and a prominent instance of corporate modern architecture, it set the trend for the city&#x27;s skyline for decades to follow, and has been featured in several Hollywood films. On completion in 1958, its costs made it the world&#x27;s most expensive skyscraper. The Bronfman family sold the Seagram building to TIAA for $70.5 million in 1979.

The Seagram Museum, formerly the original Seagram distillery in Waterloo, Ontario, was forced to close due to lack of funds in 1997. The building is now the home of the Centre for International Governance Innovation as well as Shopify. The two original barrel houses are now the Seagram Lofts condominiums. There were almost of open land, upon which the Balsillie School of International Affairs was subsequently built; construction began in 2009, and was completed in 2010.

<doc id="253214" wikidata="Q779451" url="?curid=253214" title="Vladislav Delay">
<text>Vladislav Delay is the most frequently used pseudonym of Sasu Ripatti (born 1976), a Finnish electronic musician. He has also recorded as Luomo, Sistol, Uusitalo, Conoco, and Ripatti, working in styles such as minimal techno, glitch, and house.

==Background==
Ripatti has been involved in the ambient music, glitch, house, and techno genres. His method of track production involves a mixture of synthesizing, vocal recording and live reprocessing. Many tracks have an organic feeling, conjured through rolling, dubby basslines and processed vocal snippets, often from his wife Antye Greie aka AGF. Their daughter was born in 2006.

Ripatti has released EPs and albums on numerous underground electronic labels, including Raster-Noton, Force Tracks, Chain Reaction, Mille Plateaux, Resopal, and Sigma Editions. He also founded the Finnish music label Huume Recordings and currently runs a label called Ripatti, on which he has released the album Visa and several footwork-oriented singles under the name Ripatti.

Ripatti played drums and percussion in the Moritz von Oswald Trio alongside Moritz von Oswald and Max Loderbauer from 2009 until 2015, when he was replaced by Tony Allen. With the Moritz von Oswald Trio he has released two albums and a live LP. He has also released an album in 2011 with his own experimental jazz/electronic group, the Vladislav Delay Quartet.

He performed as Vladislav Delay at an All Tomorrow&#x27;s Parties festival in May 2011 curated by Animal Collective, who have praised his album Multila and whose member, Panda Bear, thanked his Luomo alias in the liner notes of his techno-inspired album Person Pitch.

==Musical style==
Ripatti&#x27;s music is renowned for its sophisticated textural qualities. His sonic approach relies heavily on a semi-random element, and many undulating, complementary and sometimes conflicting layers interplay throughout most of his music. A de-constructive element is sometimes detected within the music as Ripatti makes comment on established genres within his various releases.

Characteristic traits within Ripatti&#x27;s music are sometimes a deep or bubbling synth-bass line, fractured and syncopated percussion - often placed freely within the music, long delay repetitions of various sounds, syncopated use of vocal samples, and complicated digital effect processing techniques. Generally, the music has a very spacious and organic sound, and albums such as &quot;Anima&quot; feature a very simple theme repeated with an array of musical and rhythmical interjections.

Ripatti releases under different names have conceptually varied, but have sonically related qualities; this may be due to Ripatti&#x27;s different composition techniques. Uusitalo releases are often anchored by a house beat and highlight rhythmic variation (see 2007&#x27;s Karhunainen). Vladislav Delay releases, on the other hand (see 2000&#x27;s Multila), explore rhythmically sparse, experimental and ambient techno-dub soundscapes. Works under the Luomo name feature dance-floor ready vocal house. Sistol performs microhouse; Conoco (under which he was only released one early EP, Kemikoski) is similar to his Vladislav Delay work but harsher and more industrial. His Ripatti releases are (a pastiche of) Chicago footwork.

Sasu Ripatti often references himself within his music. The &quot;Vapaa Muurari&quot; album, for example, provided much of the instrumental material for &quot;Vocalcity&quot;. Similarly, the track &quot;Tessio&quot; on the &quot;Vocalcity&quot; album was re-recorded for the &quot;Present Lover&quot; album in 2003.

<doc id="253224" wikidata="Q949495" url="?curid=253224" title="Battle of Ōhaeawai">
<text>The Battle of Ōhaeawai, part of the Flagstaff War, was fought in July 1845 at Ōhaeawai in Northland, New Zealand. The battle was between British forces and their allies from the local Ngāpuhi tribe of Māori on one side, and other Ngāpuhi, led by Te Ruki Kawiti, a prominent rangatira (chief), on the other side. The battle was notable for establishing that an appropriately built fortified pā could withstand bombardment from cannon fire, with a frontal assault by soldiers suffering heavy casualties.

==Kawiti&#x27;s success at Ōhaeawai Pā==

After the Battle of Te Ahuahu a debate occurred between Te Ruki Kawiti and the Ngatirangi chief Pene Taui as to the site of the next battle; Kawiti eventually agreed to a request to fortify Pene Taui&#x27;s pā, which was from the present settlement of Ōhaeawai and from Kaikohe. In the winter of 1845 Lieutenant Colonel Henry Despard led a combined force of troops from the 58th, 96th, and 99th Regiments, Royal Marines and Māori allies in an attack on Pene Taui&#x27;s pā, which had been fortified by Kawiti.

The British troops arrived before the Ōhaeawai Pā on 23 June and established a camp about away. On the summit of a nearby hill (Puketapu) they built a four-gun battery. They opened fire next day and continued until dark but did very little damage to the palisade. The next day the guns were brought to within of the pā. The bombardment continued for another two days but still did very little damage. Partly this was due to the elasticity of the flax covering the palisade. Since the introduction of muskets the Māori had learnt to cover the outside of the palisades with layers of flax (&quot;Phormium tenax&quot;) leaves, making them effectively bulletproof as the velocity of musket balls was dissipated by the flax leaves. However the main fault of the bombardment was a failure to concentrate the cannon fire on one area of the defences, so as to create a breach in the palisade.

After two days of bombardment without effecting a breach, Despard ordered a frontal assault. He was, with difficulty, persuaded to postpone this pending the arrival of a 32-pound naval gun which came the next day, 1 July. However an unexpected sortie from the pā resulted in the temporary occupation of the knoll on which Tāmati Wāka Nene had his camp and the capture of Nene&#x27;s colours—the Union Jack. The Union Jack was carried into the pā. There it was hoisted, upside down, and at half-mast high, below the Māori flag, which was a kākahu (Māori cloak). This insulting display of the Union Jack was the cause of the disaster which ensued. Infuriated by the insult to the Union Jack, Colonel Despard ordered an assault upon the pā the same day without waiting for the 32-pounder to arrive. The attack was directed to the section of the pā where the angle of the palisade allowed a double flank from which the defenders of the pā could fire at the attackers; the attack was a reckless endeavour.

The British persisted in their attempts to storm the unbreached palisades and five to seven minutes later around 40 British troops were killed with over 70 wounded. The casualties included Captain Grant of the 58th Regiment and Lieutenant George Phillpotts of . The scalp of Lieutenant Phillpotts was brought to the tohunga Te Atua Wera, who made divinations and composed a song foretelling victory against the British. The casualties were buried at St. John the Baptist Church at Waimate North.

Shaken by the loss of a third of his troops, Despard decided to abandon the siege. However, his Māori allies contested this decision. Tāmati Wāka Nene persuaded Despard to wait for a few more days. More ammunition and supplies were brought in and the shelling continued. On the morning of 8 July the pā was found to have been abandoned, the occupants having disappeared in the night. When they had a chance to examine it, the British officers found it to be even stronger than they had feared.

The defenders of the pā had four iron cannons on ship-carriages including a carronade that was loaded with a bullock-chain, and fired at close quarters at the attacking soldiers. The colonial forces captured these cannons, one of which had been destroyed by a shot from a British cannon.
Captain William Biddlecomb Marlow, RE, noted in relation to his drawing, Plate IV, of Ōhaeawai pā:

The dotted lines denote rows of fences composed of trees deeply sunk in the ground, between 9 and 15 inches thick, bound close together by a strong native line or rope at the top and bottom: upon the outer row of trees a screen between 4 and 6 inches thick, and 8 and 9 feet high, was formed from a native plant called the New Zealand flax, which is exceedingly tough, and at a distance capable of resisting a musket-ball.

This screen was kept about 18 inches above the ground, to serve as loop-holes to fire through from the trench marked T T, Plate IV., figs. 13 and 14; S S serving as traverses.

Ensign John Jermyn Symonds, 99th Regiment, described in his drawing that Ōhaeawai&#x27;s inner palisade was high, built using puriri logs. In front of the inner palisade was a ditch in which the warriors could shelter and reload their muskets then fire through gaps in the two outer palisades.

Relying on the report of her husband Henry who observed the battle, Marianne Williams commented on the ingenuity of the construction of the war pā in a letter to Mrs. Heathcote, 5 July 1845:

The pā was duly destroyed and the British retreated once again to the Bay of Islands. Te Ruki Kawiti and his warriors escaped and proceeded to construct an even stronger pā at Ruapekapeka. The Battle of Ōhaeawai was presented as a victory for the British force, notwithstanding the death of about a third of the soldiers. The reality of the end of the Battle of Ōhaeawai was that Kawiti and his warriors had abandoned the pā in a tactical withdrawal, with the Ngāpuhi moving on to build the Ruapekapeka Pā from which to engage the British force on a battle field chosen by Kawiti.

Hōne Heke did not participate in the Battle of Ōhaeawai as he was recovering from the wounds he received at the Battle of Te Ahuahu.

==Model for the gunfighter pā==
After the battle, models were made of the design of the pā, with one being sent to Britain where it sat forgotten in a museum. Other Māori tribes of New Zealand became aware of the techniques used in the design of the Ōhaeawai Pā in order to blunt the effectiveness of cannon and musket fire and to create firing trenches located within the inner palisade and communication trenches linking to ruas—shelters dug into the ground and covered with earth. The design of the Ōhaeawai Pā, and the pā subsequently built by Kawiti at Ruapekapeka, became the basis of what is now called the &quot;gunfighter pā&quot;.

==Site of the battle==
Saint Michael&#x27;s Anglican Church was built on the site of the Ōhaeawai pā in 1871. While the area is now called &quot;Ngawha&quot;, it was known as &quot;Ōhaeawai&quot; at the time. James Cowan identified that &quot;the site of the Ōhaeawai pā is now occupied by a Maori church and burying-ground. The scene of the battle is five miles from Kaikohe and two miles from the Township of Ōhaeawai. A Maori church of old-fashioned design is seen on the left as one travels from Kaikohe; it stands on a gentle rise a short distance west of the main road. The locality is usually called Ngawha, from the hot springs in the neighbourhood, but it is the true Ōhaeawai; the European township which has appropriated the name should properly be known as Taiamai. The church occupies the centre of the olden fortification, and a scoria-stone wall, 7 ft. high, encloses the sacred ground.&quot;

The soldiers and sailors&#x27; memorial stands in the churchyard. The Maori inscription reads, with translation:

&quot;Ko te tohu tapu tenei o nga hoia me nga heremana o te Kuini i hinga i te whawhai ki konei ki Ohaeawai i te tau o to tatou ariki 1845. Ko tenei urupa na nga Maori i whaka-takoto I muri iho i te maunga rongo.&quot;

This is a sacred memorial to the soldiers and sailors of the Queen who fell in battle here at Ohaeawai in the year of Our Lord 1845. This burying place was laid out by the Maoris after the making of peace.

<text>Dhalgren is a 1975 science fiction novel by American writer Samuel R. Delany. It features an extended trip to and through Bellona, a fictional city in the American Midwest cut off from the rest of the world by an unknown catastrophe. It is number 33 on the 20th Century&#x27;s Greatest Hits: 100 English-Language Books of Fiction list.

==Plot overview==
The city of Bellona is severely damaged; radio, television, and telephone signals do not reach it. People enter and leave by crossing a bridge on foot.

Inexplicable events punctuate the novel: One night the perpetual cloud cover parts to reveal two moons in the sky. One day a red sun swollen to hundreds of times its normal size rises to terrify the populace, then retreats across the sky to set on the same horizon. Street signs and landmarks shift constantly, while time appears to contract and dilate. Buildings burn for days, but are never consumed, while others burn and later show no signs of damage. Gangs roam the nighttime streets, their members hidden within holographic projections of gigantic insects or mythological creatures. The few people left in Bellona struggle with survival, boredom, and each other.

The novel&#x27;s protagonist is &quot;the Kid&quot; (sometimes &quot;Kidd&quot;), a drifter who has partial amnesia: he cannot remember either his own name or those of his parents, though he knows his mother was an American Indian. He wears only one sandal, shoe, or boot, as do characters in two other Delany novels and one short story: Mouse in &quot;Nova&quot; (1968), Hogg in &quot;Hogg&quot; (1995), and Roger in &quot;We, in Some Strange Power&#x27;s Employ Move on a Rigorous Line&quot; (1967). Possibly he has schizophrenia: the novel&#x27;s narrative is intermittently incoherent (particularly at its end), the protagonist has memories of a stay in a mental hospital, and his perception of reality and the passages of time sometimes differ from those of other characters. Over the course of the story he also experiences significant memory loss. In addition, he is dyslexic, confusing left and right and often taking wrong turns at street corners and getting lost in the city. It is therefore unclear to what extent the events in the story are the product of an unreliable narrator.

Delany has stated that &quot;Kid&#x27;s sanity remains in question... for the same reason the disaster of the city is unexplained: such explanations would become a fixed signified straiting the play and interplay of the signifier – the city of signs – that flexes and reflexes above it.&quot;

==Synopsis==
In a forest somewhere outside the city, the protagonist meets a woman and they have sex. After, he tells her that he has &quot;lost something&quot;—he cannot remember his name. She leads him to a cave and tells him to enter. Inside, he finds long loops of chain fitted with miniature prisms, mirrors, and lenses. He dons the chain and leaves the cave, only to find the woman in the middle of a field, turning into a tree. Panicked, he flees. Many characters in the novel wear the same sort of &quot;optic chain&quot; (all will be uncomfortable discussing how they came to have it). On a nearby road, a passing truck stops to pick him up. The trucker, hauling artichokes, drops him off at the end of a suspension bridge leading across the river to Bellona.

As he crosses the bridge in the early morning darkness, the young man meets a group of women leaving the city. They ask him questions about the outside world and give him a weapon: a bladed &quot;orchid,&quot; worn around the wrist with its blades sweeping up in front of the hand.

Once inside Bellona, an engineer, Tak Loufer, who was living a few miles outside of the city when the initial destruction happened, meets and befriends him. Tak has moved to Bellona and stayed there ever since. Upon learning that he cannot remember his name, Tak gives him a nickname—the Kid. Throughout the novel he is also referred to as &quot;Kid&quot;, &quot;Kidd&quot;, and often just &quot;kid&quot;. Next Tak takes Kid on a short tour of the city. One stop is at a commune in the city park, where Kid sees two women reading a spiral notebook. When Kid looks at it, we see what he reads: The first page contains, word-for-word, the first sentences of &quot;Dhalgren&quot;. As he reads further, however, the text diverges from the novel&#x27;s opening.

In Chapter II, &quot;The Ruins of Morning&quot;, Kid returns to the commune the next day and receives the notebook from Lanya Colson, one of the two women from the evening before. Shortly they become lovers. Their relationship lasts throughout the book. We meet or learn about several other characters, including George Harrison, a local cult hero and rumoured rapist; Ernest Newboy, a famous poet visiting Bellona by invitation of Roger Calkins, publisher and editor of the local newspaper, &quot;The Bellona Times&quot;; Madame Brown, a psychotherapist; and, later in the novel, Captain Michael Kamp, an astronaut who, some years before, was in the crew of a successful Moon landing.

The notebook Kid receives already has writing throughout, but only on the right hand pages. The left hand pages are blank. Glimpses of the text in the notebook, however, are extremely close to passages in &quot;Dhalgren&quot; itself, as if the notebook were an alternate draft of the novel. Other passages are verbatim from the final chapter of &quot;Dhalgren&quot;. It is here in Chapter II that Kid begins using the blank pages of the notebook to compose poems. The novel describes the process of creating the poems—the emotions and the mechanics of the writing itself—at length and several times. We never see the actual poems, however, in their final form. Kid soon revises or removes any line that does appear in the text.

The third and longest chapter, &quot;House of the Ax&quot;, involves Kid&#x27;s interactions with the Richards family: Mr. Arthur Richards, his wife Mary Richards, their daughter June (who may or may not have been raped publicly by George Harrison, whom she is now fixated on), and son Bobby. Through Madame Brown they hire Kid to help them move from one apartment to another in the mostly-abandoned Labry Apartments. Led by Mary Richards, they are &quot;keeping up appearances.&quot; Mr. Richards leaves every day to go to work—though no office or facility in the city seems to be in operation—while Mrs. Richards acts as though there&#x27;s nothing truly disastrous happening in Bellona. By some force of will, she causes almost everyone who comes into contact with her to play along. While carrying a carpet to the elevator, June backs Bobby into an open elevator shaft, where he falls to his death. There is reason to believe that June did this intentionally after Bobby threatened to reveal her relationship with George Harrison to the family.

The third chapter is also where successful poet Ernest Newboy befriends Kid. Newboy takes an interest in Kid&#x27;s poems and mentions them to Roger Calkins. By the end of the chapter, Calkins is preparing to print a book of Kid&#x27;s poems.

As the novel progresses, Kid falls in with the Scorpions, a loose-knit gang, three of whom have severely beaten him earlier in the book. Almost accidentally, Kid becomes their leader. (Much of this suggests the American &quot;mythical folk hero,&quot; Billy the Kid, whom Delany used in his earlier, Nebula Award-winning novel, &quot;The Einstein Intersection&quot; [1967].) Denny, a 15-year-old Scorpion, becomes Kid&#x27;s and Lanya&#x27;s lover, so that the relationship with Lanya turns into a lasting three-way sexual linkage. Kid also begins writing things other than poems in the notebook, keeping a journal of events and his thoughts.

In Chapter VI, &quot;Palimpsest&quot;, Calkins throws a party for Kid and his book, &quot;Brass Orchids&quot;, at his sprawling estate. At Calkins&#x27;s suggestion, Kid brings along twenty or thirty friends: the Scorpion &quot;nest.&quot; While Calkins himself is absent from the gathering, there are extended descriptions of the interactions between what is left of Bellona&#x27;s high society and, in effect, a street gang. At the party, Kid is interviewed by William (later passages of the book suggest William&#x27;s last name is &quot;Dhalgren,&quot; but this is never confirmed).

In the concluding Chapter VII, &quot;The Anathemata: a plague journal&quot;, bits of the whole now and again appear to be laid out. Shifting from the omniscient viewpoint of the first six chapters, this chapter comprises numerous journal entries from the notebook, all of which appear to be by Kid. Several passages from this chapter have, however, already appeared verbatim earlier in the novel when Kid reads what was already in the notebook—written when he received it. In this chapter rubrics run along beside many sections of the main text, mimicking the writing as it appears in the notebook. (In the middle of this chapter, a rubric running contains the following sentence: &quot;I have come to to wound the autumnal city.&quot;) Recalling Kid&#x27;s entry into the city, the final section contains a near paragraph-for-paragraph echo of his initial confrontation with the women on the bridge. This time, however, the group leaving is almost all male, and the person entering is a young woman who says almost exactly what Kid did himself at the beginning of his stay in Bellona.

The story ends:

As with &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;, the unclosed closing sentence can be read as leading into the unopened opening sentence, turning the novel into an enigmatic circle.

==Major themes==

===Mythology===

Writing in the &quot;Libertarian Review&quot;, Jeff Riggenbach compared &quot;Dhalgren&quot; to the work of James Joyce. A quotation from his review was included on the inside advertisement page of the fifteenth printing of the Bantam edition. As the critic and novelist William Gass writes of Joyce, &quot;The Homeric parallels in &quot;Ulysses&quot; are of marginal importance to the reading of the work but are of fundamental importance to the writing of it...Writers have certain ordering compulsions, certain ordering habits, which are part of the book only in the sense that they make the writing possible. This is a widespread phenomenon.&quot; Almost certainly this is also the case with &quot;Dhalgren&quot;: Writing about the novel both as himself and under his pseudonym K. Leslie Steiner, Delany has made similar statements and suggested that it is easy to make too much of the mythological resonances. As he says, they are merely resonances, and not keys to any particular secrets the novel holds.

===Circular text, multistable perception, echoes, and repeated imagery===
Delany has pointed out that &quot;Dhalgren&quot; is a circular text with multiple entry points. Those points include the schizoid babble that appears in various sections of the story. Hints along those lines are given in the novel. Besides the Chapter VII rubric mentioned above (containing the sentence &quot;I have come to to wound the autumnal city&quot;—the exact sentence that would be created by joining the novel&#x27;s unclosed closing sentence to the unopened opening) the most obvious is the point where Kid hears &quot;grendal grendal grendal grendal&quot; going through his mind and suddenly realizes he was listening from the wrong spot: he was actually hearing &quot;Dhalgren Dhalgren Dhalgren&quot; over and over again. The ability of texts to become circular is something that Delany explores in other works, such as &quot;Empire Star&quot;.

Delany conceived and executed &quot;Dhalgren&quot; as a literary multistable perception—the observer (reader) may choose to shift his perception back and forth. Central to this construction is the notebook itself: Kidd receives the notebook shortly after entering Bellona. In the first several chapters of the novel we see, on several occasions, exactly what Kid reads when he looks at the open notebook. The notebook appears to take over as the main text of the novel starting at Chapter VII, coming almost seamlessly after Chapter VI. However, though Chapter VII reads as though it is written by Kid, many of the passages shown in earlier chapters appear verbatim in Chapter VII. Yet for Kid to have read those passages earlier, the passages must have been written &quot;before&quot; he received the notebook. In fact, the last few pages of the novel show Kid leaving Bellona. The last sentence of that departure sequence is the incomplete one that conceivably loops back to the beginning of the book. However, earlier in the novel the notebook falls to the ground and Kid reads the last page. The reader sees exactly what Kid reads: the last four sentences of the novel, word for word. This happens well before a point in the novel where Kid specifically states that he only wrote the poems, and &quot;all that other stuff&quot; was already in there when he received the notebook. However, those four sentences are part of a longer section at the end of the novel which, when read, was obviously written by Kid. This means he left Bellona—taking the notebook with him, for how else would he be able to write about his departure—prior to that notebook being found inside Bellona and given to him. Delany has specifically stated that it is not a matter of settling or deciding which text is authoritative. It is more a matter of allowing the reader to experience perceptual shifts in the same way that a Necker cube can be viewed. Akin to the hints regarding its circular nature, &quot;Dhalgren&quot; also contains at least one hint towards the perceptual shifts: Denny&#x27;s book of M. C. Escher prints. Additionally, Jeffrey Allen Tucker has written that Delany&#x27;s unpublished notes regarding the writing of &quot;Dhalgren&quot; contain direct references to the novel itself working as a Möbius Strip, and makes a direct connection to Escher&#x27;s &quot;Möbius Strip&quot;.

Within the looping text that comprises &quot;Dhalgren&quot;, many other textual plays on perception can be found. Imagery and conversations, some hundreds of pages apart, closely echo each other. One case in point: The scenes on the bridge mentioned in the &quot;Plot Summary&quot; above. In another, light sliding across the face of a trucker driving at night is echoed in the description of light sliding across the face of a building. The repeated motif of a scratch down the lower leg of several female characters at different points in the novel is yet another example.

=== Delany&#x27;s personal experience of reality===
Samuel R. Delany has dyslexia and dysmetria. He once spent time in the mental health ward of a hospital. and he has repeatedly spoken and written of seeing burned-out sections of great American cities that most people didn&#x27;t see, or even know existed. &quot;Dhalgren&quot; is a literary exposition of all these experiences for the &quot;normal&quot; reader.

=== Influences===
&quot;Dhalgren&quot; is often compared to James Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. Delany has cited poets W. H. Auden, Rainer Maria Rilke, and Paul Valéry as influences on the book, as well as John Ashbery&#x27;s poem &quot;The Instruction Manual&quot;. Elsewhere he cites Michel Foucault, Frank Kermode, and Jack Spicer. Kenneth R. James has elaborated subtextual ties to mathematician G. Spencer-Brown&#x27;s &quot;Laws of Form&quot;.

==Literary significance and criticism==

With over a million sales, &quot;Dhalgren&quot; is by far Delany&#x27;s most popular book—and also his most controversial. Critical reaction to &quot;Dhalgren&quot; has ranged from high praise (both inside and outside the science fiction community) to extreme dislike (mostly within the community). However, &quot;Dhalgren&quot; was a commercial success, selling a half million copies in the first two years, and over a million copies worldwide since then, with &quot;its appeal reaching beyond the usual SF readership.&quot;

William Gibson has referred to &quot;Dhalgren&quot; as &quot;a riddle that was never meant to be solved.&quot;

Darrell Schweitzer expressed the opinion, &quot;&quot;Dhalgren&quot; is, I think, the most disappointing thing to happen to science fiction since Robert Heinlein made a complete fool of himself with &quot;I Will Fear No Evil&quot;.&quot;

In 2015, Elizabeth Hand characterized the novel as &quot;a dense, transgressive, hallucinatory, Joycean tour-de-force&quot;. Theodore Sturgeon called it &quot;the very best ever to come out of the science fiction field&quot;. By contrast, Harlan Ellison hated the novel. When the book appeared, Ellison wrote: &quot;I must be honest. I gave up after 361 pages. I could not permit myself to be gulled or bored any further.&quot;

Delany has speculated that &quot;a good number of &quot;Dhalgren&quot; more incensed readers, the ones bewildered or angered by the book, simply cannot read the proper distinction between sex and society and the nature and direction of the causal arrows between them, a vision of which lies just below the novel&#x27;s surface.&quot;

&quot;Bellona, Destroyer of Cities&quot;, a stage adaptation of (or sequel to) &quot;Dhalgren&quot;, was produced at The Kitchen in New York City in April 2010. In 2017, a multimedia performance called &quot;Dhalgren Sunrise&quot; was staged by Fort Point Theatre Channel in Chelsea, Massachusetts. 

In 3 Body Problem (TV series) S1 E6, the man who will be following Ye Wenjie, is seen reading Dhalgren sitting at a table. In S1 E7 he is reading the book while queuing for a flight.

==Publishing history==
&quot;Dhalgren&quot; was officially published in January, 1975 (with copies available on bookshelves as early as the first week in December, 1974), as a paperback original (a Frederik Pohl selection) by Bantam Books. The Bantam edition went through 19 printings, selling slightly more than a million copies.

A hardcover edition was published by Gregg Press (1977), based on the Bantam paperback edition with many errors corrected, and with an introduction by Jean Mark Gawron. After the Bantam edition went out of print the book was republished by Grafton (1992); Wesleyan University Press/University Press of New England (1996); and Vintage Books, an imprint of Random House (2001), the latter two with an introduction by William Gibson. In 2010 Gollancz brought out an edition as part of its SF Masterworks series, and in 2014 an ebook edition of the novel appeared.

<doc id="253227" wikidata="Q45285" url="?curid=253227" title="Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm">
<text>In computer science, the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm (or KMP algorithm) is a string-searching algorithm that searches for occurrences of a &quot;word&quot; codice_1 within a main &quot;text string&quot; codice_2 by employing the observation that when a mismatch occurs, the word itself embodies sufficient information to determine where the next match could begin, thus bypassing re-examination of previously matched characters.

The algorithm was conceived by James H. Morris and independently discovered by Donald Knuth &quot;a few weeks later&quot; from automata theory.
Morris and Vaughan Pratt published a technical report in 1970.
The three also published the algorithm jointly in 1977. Independently, in 1969, Matiyasevich discovered a similar algorithm, coded by a two-dimensional Turing machine, while studying a string-pattern-matching recognition problem over a binary alphabet. This was the first linear-time algorithm for string matching.

==Background==
A string-matching algorithm wants to find the starting index codice_3 in string codice_4 that matches the search word codice_5.

The most straightforward algorithm, known as the &quot;brute-force&quot; or &quot;naive&quot; algorithm, is to look for a word match at each index codice_3, i.e. the position in the string being searched that corresponds to the character codice_7. At each position codice_3 the algorithm first checks for equality of the first character in the word being searched, i.e. codice_9. If a match is found, the algorithm tests the other characters in the word being searched by checking successive values of the word position index, codice_10. The algorithm retrieves the character codice_11 in the word being searched and checks for equality of the expression codice_12. If all successive characters match in codice_1 at position codice_3, then a match is found at that position in the search string. If the index codice_3 reaches the end of the string then there is no match, in which case the search is said to &quot;fail&quot;.

Usually, the trial check will quickly reject the trial match. If the strings are uniformly distributed random letters, then the chance that characters match is 1 in 26. In most cases, the trial check will reject the match at the initial letter. The chance that the first two letters will match is 1 in 26 (1 in 26^2 chances of a match over 26 possible letters). So if the characters are random, then the expected complexity of searching string codice_4 of length &quot;n&quot; is on the order of &quot;n&quot; comparisons or &quot;Θ&quot;(&quot;n&quot;). The expected performance is very good. If codice_4 is 1 million characters and codice_5 is 1000 characters, then the string search should complete after about 1.04 million character comparisons.

That expected performance is not guaranteed. If the strings are not random, then checking a trial codice_3 may take many character comparisons. The worst case is if the two strings match in all but the last letter. Imagine that the string codice_4 consists of 1 million characters that are all &quot;A&quot;, and that the word codice_5 is 999 &quot;A&quot; characters terminating in a final &quot;B&quot; character. The simple string-matching algorithm will now examine 1000 characters at each trial position before rejecting the match and advancing the trial position. The simple string search example would now take about 1000 character comparisons times 1 million positions for 1 billion character comparisons. If the length of codice_5 is &quot;k&quot;, then the worst-case performance is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;⋅&quot;n&quot;).

The KMP algorithm has a better worst-case performance than the straightforward algorithm. KMP spends a little time precomputing a table (on the order of the size of codice_5, &quot;O&quot;(&quot;k&quot;)), and then it uses that table to do an efficient search of the string in &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

The difference is that KMP makes use of previous match information that the straightforward algorithm does not. In the example above, when KMP sees a trial match fail on the 1000th character (codice_10 = 999) because codice_25, it will increment codice_3 by 1, but it will know that the first 998 characters at the new position already match. KMP matched 999 &quot;A&quot; characters before discovering a mismatch at the 1000th character (position 999). Advancing the trial match position codice_3 by one throws away the first &quot;A&quot;, so KMP knows there are 998 &quot;A&quot; characters that match codice_5 and does not retest them; that is, KMP sets codice_10 to 998. KMP maintains its knowledge in the precomputed table and two state variables. When KMP discovers a mismatch, the table determines how much KMP will increase (variable codice_3) and where it will resume testing (variable codice_10).

==KMP algorithm==

===Example of the search algorithm===
To illustrate the algorithm&#x27;s details, consider a (relatively artificial) run of the algorithm, where codice_1 = &quot;ABCDABD&quot; and codice_2 = &quot;ABC ABCDAB ABCDABCDABDE&quot;. At any given time, the algorithm is in a state determined by two integers:

* codice_3, denoting the position within codice_2 where the prospective match for codice_1 begins,
* codice_10, denoting the index of the currently considered character in codice_1.

In each step the algorithm compares codice_39 with codice_11 and increments codice_10 if they are equal. This is depicted, at the start of the run, like
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: 
 W: 
 i: 
The algorithm compares successive characters of codice_1 to &quot;parallel&quot; characters of codice_2, moving from one to the next by incrementing codice_10 if they match. However, in the fourth step codice_45 does not match codice_46. Rather than beginning to search again at codice_47, we note that no codice_48 occurs between positions 1 and 2 in codice_2; hence, having checked all those characters previously (and knowing they matched the corresponding characters in codice_1), there is no chance of finding the beginning of a match. Therefore, the algorithm sets codice_51 and codice_52.
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC
 W: 
 i: 
This match fails at the initial character, so the algorithm sets codice_53 and codice_52
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC 
 W: 
 i: 
Here, codice_10 increments through a nearly complete match codice_56 until codice_57 giving a mismatch at codice_58 and codice_59. However, just prior to the end of the current partial match, there was that substring codice_60 that could be the beginning of a new match, so the algorithm must take this into consideration. As these characters match the two characters prior to the current position, those characters need not be checked again; the algorithm sets codice_61 (the start of the initial prefix) and codice_62 (signaling the first two characters match) and continues matching. Thus the algorithm not only omits previously matched characters of codice_2 (the codice_60), but also previously matched characters of codice_1 (the prefix codice_60).
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC ABCD
 W: 
 i: 
This search at the new position fails immediately because codice_67 (a codice_68) does not match codice_59 (a codice_70). As in the first trial, the mismatch causes the algorithm to return to the beginning of codice_1 and begins searching at the mismatched character position of codice_2: codice_73, reset codice_52.
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC ABCDAB
 W: 
 i: 
The match at codice_75 fails immediately, so the algorithm next tries codice_76 and codice_52.
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC ABCDAB 
 W: 
 i: 
Once again, the algorithm matches codice_56, but the next character, codice_68, does not match the final character codice_80 of the word codice_1. Reasoning as before, the algorithm sets codice_82, to start at the two-character string codice_60 leading up to the current position, set codice_62, and continue matching from the current position.
 1 2 
 m: 01234567890123456789012
 S: ABC ABCDAB ABCD
 W: 
 i: 
This time the match is complete, and the first character of the match is codice_85.

===Description of pseudocode for the search algorithm===

The above example contains all the elements of the algorithm. For the moment, we assume the existence of a &quot;partial match&quot; table codice_86, described below, which indicates where we need to look for the start of a new match when a mismatch is found. The entries of codice_86 are constructed so that if we have a match starting at codice_7 that fails when comparing codice_89 to codice_11, then the next possible match will start at index codice_91 in codice_2 (that is, codice_93 is the amount of &quot;backtracking&quot; we need to do after a mismatch). This has two implications: first, codice_94, which indicates that if codice_95 is a mismatch, we cannot backtrack and must simply check the next character; and second, although the next possible match will &quot;begin&quot; at index codice_91, as in the example above, we need not actually check any of the codice_93 characters after that, so that we continue searching from codice_98. The following is a sample pseudocode implementation of the KMP search algorithm.
 algorithm &quot;kmp_search&quot;:
 input:
 an array of characters, S (the text to be searched)
 an array of characters, W (the word sought)
 output:
 an array of integers, P (positions in S at which W is found)
 an integer, nP (number of positions)
 define variables:
 an integer, j ← 0 (the position of the current character in S)
 an integer, k ← 0 (the position of the current character in W)
 an array of integers, T (the table, computed elsewhere)
 let nP ← 0
 while j &lt; length(S) do
 if W[k] = S[j] then
 let j ← j + 1
 let k ← k + 1
 if k = length(W) then
 (occurrence found, if only first occurrence is needed, m ← j - k may be returned here)
 let P[nP] ← j - k, nP ← nP + 1
 let k ← T[k] (T[length(W)] can&#x27;t be -1)
 else
 let k ← T[k]
 if k &lt; 0 then
 let j ← j + 1
 let k ← k + 1

===Efficiency of the search algorithm===
Assuming the prior existence of the table codice_86, the search portion of the Knuth–Morris–Pratt algorithm has complexity &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;), where &quot;n&quot; is the length of codice_2 and the &quot;O&quot; is big-O notation. Except for the fixed overhead incurred in entering and exiting the function, all the computations are performed in the codice_101 loop. To bound the number of iterations of this loop; observe that codice_86 is constructed so that if a match which had begun at codice_7 fails while comparing codice_89 to codice_11, then the next possible match must begin at codice_106. In particular, the next possible match must occur at a higher index than codice_3, so that codice_108.

This fact implies that the loop can execute at most 2&quot;n&quot; times, since at each iteration it executes one of the two branches in the loop. The first branch invariably increases codice_10 and does not change codice_3, so that the index codice_111 of the currently scrutinized character of codice_2 is increased. The second branch adds codice_113 to codice_3, and as we have seen, this is always a positive number. Thus the location codice_3 of the beginning of the current potential match is increased. At the same time, the second branch leaves codice_111 unchanged, for codice_3 gets codice_113 added to it, and immediately after codice_93 gets assigned as the new value of codice_10, hence codice_121. Now, the loop ends if codice_111 = &quot;n&quot;; therefore, each branch of the loop can be reached at most &quot;n&quot; times, since they respectively increase either codice_111 or codice_3, and codice_125: if codice_3 = &quot;n&quot;, then certainly codice_111 ≥ &quot;n&quot;, so that since it increases by unit increments at most, we must have had codice_111 = &quot;n&quot; at some point in the past, and therefore either way we would be done.

Thus the loop executes at most 2&quot;n&quot; times, showing that the time complexity of the search algorithm is &quot;O&quot;(&quot;n&quot;).

Here is another way to think about the runtime:
Let us say we begin to match codice_1 and codice_2 at position codice_10 and codice_132. If codice_1 exists as a substring of codice_2 at p, then codice_135.
Upon success, that is, the word and the text matched at the positions (codice_136), we increase codice_10 by 1.
Upon failure, that is, the word and the text do not match at the positions (codice_138), the text pointer is kept still, while the word pointer is rolled back a certain amount (codice_139, where codice_86 is the jump table), and we attempt to match codice_98 with codice_142.
The maximum number of roll-back of codice_10 is bounded by codice_10, that is to say, for any failure, we can only roll back as much as we have progressed up to the failure.
Then it is clear the runtime is 2&quot;n&quot;.

==&quot;Partial match&quot; table (also known as &quot;failure function&quot;)==
The goal of the table is to allow the algorithm not to match any character of codice_2 more than once. The key observation about the nature of a linear search that allows this to happen is that in having checked some segment of the main string against an &quot;initial segment&quot; of the pattern, we know exactly at which places a new potential match which could continue to the current position could begin prior to the current position. In other words, we &quot;pre-search&quot; the pattern itself and compile a list of all possible fallback positions that bypass a maximum of hopeless characters while not sacrificing any potential matches in doing so.

We want to be able to look up, for each position in codice_1, the length of the longest possible initial segment of codice_1 leading up to (but not including) that position, other than the full segment starting at codice_95 that just failed to match; this is how far we have to backtrack in finding the next match. Hence codice_93 is exactly the length of the longest possible &quot;proper&quot; initial segment of codice_1 which is also a segment of the substring ending at codice_151. We use the convention that the empty string has length 0. Since a mismatch at the very start of the pattern is a special case (there is no possibility of backtracking), we set codice_94, as discussed below.

===Working example of the table-building algorithm===
We consider the example of codice_153 first. We will see that it follows much the same pattern as the main search, and is efficient for similar reasons. We set codice_94. To find codice_155, we must discover a proper suffix of codice_156 which is also a prefix of pattern codice_1. But there are no proper suffixes of codice_156, so we set codice_159. To find codice_160, we see that the substring codice_95 - codice_162 (codice_60) has a proper suffix codice_164. However &quot;B&quot; is not a prefix of the pattern codice_1. Therefore, we set codice_166.

Continuing to codice_167, we first check the proper suffix of length 1, and as in the previous case it fails. Should we also check longer suffixes? No, we now note that there is a shortcut to checking &quot;all&quot; suffixes: let us say that we discovered a proper suffix which is a proper prefix (a proper prefix of a string is not equal to the string itself) and ending at codice_67 with length 2 (the maximum possible); then its first character is also a proper prefix of codice_1, hence a proper prefix itself, and it ends at codice_162, which we already determined did not occur as codice_166 and not codice_172. Hence at each stage, the shortcut rule is that one needs to consider checking suffixes of a given size m+1 only if a valid suffix of size m was found at the previous stage (i.e. codice_173) and should not bother to check m+2, m+3, etc.

Therefore, we need not even concern ourselves with substrings having length 2, and as in the previous case the sole one with length 1 fails, so codice_174.

We pass to the subsequent codice_175, codice_48. The same logic shows that the longest substring we need to consider has length 1, and as in the previous case it fails since &quot;D&quot; is not a prefix of codice_1. But instead of setting codice_178, we can do better by noting that codice_179, and also that a look-up of codice_180 implies the corresponding codice_2 character, codice_182, was a mismatch and therefore codice_183. Thus there is no point in restarting the search at codice_182; we should begin at 1 position ahead. This means that we may shift pattern codice_1 by match length plus one character, so codice_186.

Considering now the next character, codice_187, which is codice_188: though by inspection the longest substring would appear to be codice_48, we still set codice_190. The reasoning is similar to why codice_186. codice_187 itself extends the prefix match begun with codice_175, and we can assume that the corresponding character in codice_2, codice_195. So backtracking before codice_187 is pointless, but codice_197 may be codice_48, hence codice_190.

Finally, we see that the next character in the ongoing segment starting at codice_200 would be codice_188, and indeed this is also codice_187. Furthermore, the same argument as above shows that we need not look before codice_175 to find a segment for codice_58, so that this is it, and we take codice_205.

Therefore, we compile the following table:

Another example:
Another example (slightly changed from the previous example):
Another more complicated example:
===Description of pseudocode for the table-building algorithm===
The example above illustrates the general technique for assembling the table with a minimum of fuss. The principle is that of the overall search: most of the work was already done in getting to the current position, so very little needs to be done in leaving it. The only minor complication is that the logic which is correct late in the string erroneously gives non-proper substrings at the beginning. This necessitates some initialization code.
 algorithm &quot;kmp_table&quot;:
 input:
 an array of characters, W (the word to be analyzed)
 output:
 an array of integers, T (the table to be filled)
 define variables:
 an integer, pos ← 1 (the current position we are computing in T)
 an integer, cnd ← 0 (the zero-based index in W of the next character of the current candidate substring)
 let T[0] ← -1
 while pos &lt; length(W) do
 if W[pos] = W[cnd] then
 let T[pos] ← T[cnd]
 else
 let T[pos] ← cnd
 while cnd ≥ 0 and W[pos] ≠ W[cnd] do
 let cnd ← T[cnd]
 let pos ← pos + 1, cnd ← cnd + 1
 let T[pos] ← cnd (only needed when all word occurrences are searched)

===Efficiency of the table-building algorithm===

The time (and space) complexity of the table algorithm is formula_1, where formula_2 is the length of codice_1.

* The outer loop: codice_207 is initialized to 1, the loop condition is codice_208, and codice_207 is increased by 1 in every iteration of the loop. Thus the loop will take formula_3 iterations.

* The inner loop: codice_210 is initialized to codice_211 and gets increased by at most 1 in each outer loop iteration. codice_212 is always less than codice_210, so codice_210 gets decreased by at least 1 in each inner loop iteration; the inner loop condition is codice_215. This means that the inner loop can execute at most as many times in total, as the outer loop has executed – each decrease of codice_210 by 1 in the inner loop needs to have a corresponding increase by 1 in the outer loop. Since the outer loop takes formula_3 iterations, the inner loop can take no more than formula_3 iterations in total.

Combined, the outer and inner loops take at most formula_6 iterations. This corresponds to formula_1 time complexity using the Big O notation.

==Efficiency of the KMP algorithm==
Since the two portions of the algorithm have, respectively, complexities of codice_217 and codice_218, the complexity of the overall algorithm is codice_219.

These complexities are the same, no matter how many repetitive patterns are in codice_1 or codice_2.

==Variants==
A real-time version of KMP can be implemented using a separate failure function table for each character in the alphabet. If a mismatch occurs on character formula_8 in the text, the failure function table for character formula_8 is consulted for the index formula_10 in the pattern at which the mismatch took place. This will return the length of the longest substring ending at formula_10 matching a prefix of the pattern, with the added condition that the character after the prefix is formula_8. With this restriction, character formula_8 in the text need not be checked again in the next phase, and so only a constant number of operations are executed between the processing of each index of the text. This satisfies the real-time computing restriction.

Booth&#x27;s algorithm uses a modified version of the KMP preprocessing function to find the lexicographically minimal string rotation. The failure function is progressively calculated as the string is rotated.

<text>Freetown Christiania (), also known as Christiania or simply &quot;&quot;, is an intentional community and anarchist commune in the Christianshavn neighbourhood of the Danish capital city of Copenhagen. It began in 1971 as a squatted military base. Its main selling street, Pusher Street, was famous for its open illegal trade of cannabis until 2024, when it was shut down in a collaborative effort between police and the majority of the inhabitants, with the street being physically dug up.

== Culture ==

Christiania is considered to be the fourth largest tourist attraction in Copenhagen, with half a million visitors annually.

The residents of Christiania are called &quot;Christianit&quot;, or &quot;Christianshavner&quot; and &quot;Amagerkaner&quot; because Christiania is located on the island of Amager. The 1976 protest song (&quot;You cannot kill us&quot;), written by Tom Lunden of flower power rock group Bifrost, became the unofficial anthem of Christiania. 

== Geography ==
Christiania is an intentional community and commune of about 850 to 1,000 residents, covering in the borough of Christianshavn in the Danish capital city of Copenhagen on the island of Amager.

The area of Christiania consists of the former military barracks of Bådsmandsstræde and parts of the city ramparts. The ramparts and the borough of Christianshavn (then a separate city) were established in 1617 by King Christian IV by reclaiming the low beaches and islets between Copenhagen and Amager. After the siege of Copenhagen during the Second Northern War, the ramparts were reinforced during 1682 to 1692 under Christian V to form a complete defence ring. The western ramparts of Copenhagen were demolished during the 19th century, but those of Christianshavn were allowed to remain. They are today considered among the finest surviving 17th century defence works in the world.

The outermost defence line, Enveloppen, has been renamed &quot;Dyssen&quot; in Christiania language (except for the southernmost tip of it which was not annexed by Christiania). It is connected to central Christiania by a bridge across the main moat or can be reached by the path beginning at Christmas Møllers Plads. Four gunpowder storehouses line the redans. They were built in 1779–1780 to replace a storage in central Copenhagen, at Østerport, which exploded in 1770, killing 50 people. The buildings are renamed , , (&#x27;the Fakir School&#x27;) and (&#x27;Cosmic Flower&#x27;) and have, although protected, been slightly altered from their historical state.

In 2007, the National Heritage Agency proposed protection status for some of the historic military buildings now in Christiania, some of which were altered after Christiania&#x27;s takeover.

After bitter negotiations that temporarily resulted in the area being sealed off to the public, in June 2011, the residents of Christiania agreed to collectively set up a fund to formally purchase the land. The community made its first payment in July 2012, officially becoming legal landowners.

== History ==
===1970s===
On 26 September 1971, Christiania was declared open by Jacob Ludvigsen, a well-known provo and journalist who published a magazine called (&#x27;The main paper&#x27;), which was intended for and successfully distributed to mostly young people. In the paper, Ludvigsen wrote an article in which he and five others explored what he termed &#x27;The Forbidden City of the Military&#x27;. The article widely announced the proclamation of the free town, and among other things he wrote the following under the headline &quot;Civilians conquered the &#x27;forbidden city&#x27; of the military&quot;: Although Christiania enjoyed an initial blind eye from the authorities, The Ministry of Defence brought a legal case against Christiania on 1 April 1976, which was upheld by the Supreme Court on 2 February 1978, who ruled that Christiania should be cleared immediately. However, despite the ruling, immediate action was not taken and that same year the Danish Parliament, Folketinget, decided that a development plan should be drafted first.

In addition to these external problems, pressure was building internally as well: Following the death of 10 residents in the space of one year from overdoses, in 1979 the residents of Christiania began the &quot;Junk Blockade&quot;. For 40 days and nights, residents patrolled the buildings where hard drugs were sold and sought to push the dealers out of the community while offering aid to the addicts.

===1980s===
During the 1980s, motorcycle gangs fought their way into Christiania, seeking to gain control over the drug market. One gang in particular, Bullshit Motorcycle Club, managed to fight off a chapter of the Hells Angels to establish sole control of the drugs market by 1984. In 1987, after police found the dismembered body of a man under the floorboards of a Bullshitter bike shop inside Christiania, the Bullshitters were broken up and cleared from the area following a combined response from the community, the police and reprisals from the Hells&#x27; Angels. From that point on, biker jackets were banned from the Freetown.

In 1989 the Danish Parliament legalised Christiania.

===2000s===
In April 2005, a gang shot and killed a man in Christiania and injured three others in an incident related to Christiania&#x27;s cannabis trade.

On 14 May 2007, workers from the governmental Forest and Nature Agency, accompanied by police, entered Christiania to demolish leftovers of the small, abandoned building of (&#x27;the cigar box&#x27;). They were met by angry and frightened Christianites, fearing that the police also intended to demolish other houses. The residents built roadblocks, but the police eventually entered the Freetown en masse and were met by resistance. Residents threw stones and shot fireworks at police vehicles. They also built barricades in the street outside Christiania&#x27;s gate. The police used tear gas on the residents and a number of arrests were made. One activist sneaked behind the police commander and poured a bucket of urine and faeces upon him before being immediately arrested. The trouble continued into the early morning hours. In all, over 50 activists from both Christiania and outside were arrested. Prosecutors demanded they be imprisoned on the basis that they might otherwise participate in further disturbances in Copenhagen (which prosecutors claimed was &quot;in a state of rebellion&quot;).

On 24 April 2009, a 22-year-old man had part of his jaw blown off by a hand grenade thrown into the crowds seated at Cafe Nemoland. Four others had minor injuries.

===2016 shooting and end of Pusher Street stalls===
On 31 August 2016, a person believed by police to be carrying earnings from cannabis sales shot two police officers and a civilian after being stopped. The injuries of one of the officers who was shot in the head were life-threatening (he survived, but needed a long period of rehabilitation), while the injuries of the other victims were less serious. Police sealed off the entire neighbourhood and located the perpetrator in Kastrup a few hours later. During a brief shootout with Politiets Aktionsstyrke (a special intervention police unit) he was seriously wounded and later died from his injuries in the hospital. The perpetrator, a 25-year-old Danish citizen of Bosnian descent (he arrived in Denmark as a child with his family), was well known to the police for violence and involvement in cannabis sales. Although known to be a sympathiser with Islamic extremism, this is not considered to have played a role in his actions. Police officers very rarely receive life-threatening injuries during encounters with criminals (at the moment of the Christiania shooting, the last killing of a police officer by a criminal in Denmark had been in 1995) and the incident was widely condemned.

In a communal meeting consisting of Christiania residents, it was decided that the stalls in Pusher Street (by far the site of the largest cannabis sale in Denmark) should be removed, which happened the following day, 2 September 2016. Local residents also urged people who were friends of the neighbourhood to help by not buying cannabis in Christiania. About two months later, it was estimated that the &quot;de facto&quot; practice of cannabis sales within Christiania had dropped by about 75%.

When locals blocked the entrances to Pusher Street with concrete barriers and bars in August 2023, a resident said they were advocating not to buy the drugs in Christiania. The dealers in &quot;Pusher Street&quot; didn&#x27;t adhere to the laws and values of the free city, the money they earned doesn&#x27;t finance Christiania, but gangs.

=== 2023 shooting ===
On 26 August 2023, two masked gunmen opened fire in Christiania, killing a 30-year old man and injuring 4 other people. According to the police, the shooting was related to a conflict between gangs. After the shooting, the residents reiterated their inability to throw the gangs off the street without help.

Due to the worsening gang violence, residents were considering a proposition by the Danish government to buy the rest of the land with the proviso that they accommodate 15,000 square meters (3¾ acres) public housing development. This agreement would provide Christiania residents with help curbing the violence and the city with needed housing.

=== 2024 and beyond ===
As of 2024, drug trade persisted, with locals and tourists alike enjoying mostly hashish products. Usable raw cannabis flower is less commonly available, with vendors favouring block hash sold by the gram or infused in a cannabis-laced cigarette. All pre-rolled cannabis cigarettes are mixed with tobacco, as is common in Europe.

Intermittent police raids, carried out usually in the evening, have continued to target vendors, hampering efficient drug distribution and driving up prices. As of 2024, the unofficial price for one rolled large hashish cigarette was approximately 100 krone (approximately $14 USD or €13 Euros) for touristy clientèle. These prices are quite high relative to legalised cannabis markets in the United States and the Netherlands. 

== Economy ==
=== Pusher Street ===
Since its opening, Christiania has been famous for its open cannabis trade, taking place in the centrally located Pusher Street, although named &quot;Green Light District&quot; by the Christianian council. Although the hash trade is illegal, authorities were for many years reluctant to forcibly stop it. Proponents thought that concentrating the hash trade at one place would limit its dispersion in society, and that it could prevent users from switching to &#x27;harder drugs&#x27;. Some wanted to legalise hash altogether. Opponents thought the ban should be enforced, in Christiania as elsewhere, and that there should be no differentiation between &#x27;soft&#x27; and &#x27;hard&#x27; drugs. It has also been claimed that the open cannabis trade was one of Copenhagen&#x27;s major tourist attractions, while some said it scared other potential tourists away and the cannabis sale is actually also forbidden on Christiania&#x27;s area. Even though the police have attempted to stop the drug trade, the cannabis market has generally thrived in Christiania. When local residents removed the Pusher Street stalls in 2016, it was estimated that the cannabis sale dropped by about 75%.

In 2002, the government began aiming to make the cannabis trade less visible. In response, the cannabis sellers covered their stands in military camouflage nets as a humorous reply. The open cannabis trade returned to Pusher Street after police raids in 2004, but the stalls were again torn down by Christiania&#x27;s residents after the 2016 shooting. As of June 2023, there were numerous cannabis sellers on Pusher Street openly selling their wares from makeshift stalls with spray painted signs advertising the strain of cannabis for sale. One dealer said the police raid the street daily, but an early warning system of lookouts allows the dealers to close up shop before the police arrive. In August 2023, residents blocked the entrances to Pusher Street with concrete barriers and bars.

== Further developments ==
Christiania has countered the government&#x27;s plans for normalisation with its own community driven planning proposal, which after eight months of internal workshops and meetings gained consensus at the common meeting before being published in early 2006.
Christiania&#x27;s own development plan was awarded the Initiative Award of the Society for the Beautification of Copenhagen in November 2006.

In September 2007, the representatives of Christiania and Copenhagen&#x27;s city council reached an agreement to cede control of Christiania to the city over the course of ten years for the purposes of business development. Also, as of May 2009, the Eastern High Court upheld a 2004 Act of Parliament which reaffirmed the state&#x27;s legal claim to control of the base. This rule is confirmed in February 2011 by the Supreme Court. The state has now full right of disposal of the Christiania area. In June 2011, the State signed an agreement with Christiania stating that the Christiania area will be transferred to a new foundation, the Foundation Freetown Christiania.

The most contentious part of this process has been to force the residents naturally opposed to the whole idea of ownership to buy the piece of land they have been occupying for more than 40 years. In July 2012, they made the first payment, and the Christianites went from squatters to legal landowners. A foundation, run by residents, was set up to raise funds and apply for a bank loan. Christianites were able to buy about 19 acres of the initial 84-acre plot.

In his January 2013 book &quot;In the Name of the People&quot;, Ivo Mosley cited Christiania as one of the few examples of communities run on truly democratic lines that exist in the world. Six months later, the laws governing Christiania changed. In July 2013, the legislative proposal L 179 for the repealing of the Christiania Law was adopted by all parties in the Folketing with the exception of the Danish People&#x27;s Party. From that moment, the same legislative rules that apply to the rest of Denmark apply to Christiania. 

Christiania native Lukas Forchhammer of the Danish pop band Lukas Graham wrote the 2016 song &quot;Mama Said&quot; about his experience growing up in the community.

The mid-2010s documentary &quot;Christiania: 40 Years of Occupation&quot; covers the community&#x27;s history.

Freetown Christiania featured prominently in the script for the third episode of the 2016 &quot;Trailer Park Boys&quot; spinoff &quot;Out of the Park: Europe&quot;.

<text>The Scar is a weird fantasy novel by British writer China Miéville, the second set in his Bas-Lag universe. &quot;The Scar&quot; won the 2003 British Fantasy Award and was shortlisted for the 2003 Arthur C. Clarke Award. &quot;The Scar&quot; was additionally nominated for the Philip K. Dick Award in 2002 and the Hugo Award for Best Novel in 2003. It is set directly after the events described in &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot;.

==Plot summary==
&quot;The Scar&quot; opens with the journey of a small ship which has set out from the city New Crobuzon (the setting of &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot;). It is heading to the city&#x27;s new colony, Nova Esperium, which lies across the Swollen Ocean of Bas-Lag. On board the ship are:
*Bellis Coldwine, a cold, reserved linguist who is fleeing for her life for her alleged connection to the events in &quot;Perdido Street Station&quot;.
*Johannes Tearfly, a scientist whose interests lie in megafauna and underwater sealife.
*Tanner Sack, a Remade criminal (that is, he has had his body surgically and magically altered as punishment for his crime) who is bound for slavery.
*Shekel, a young cabin boy who befriends Tanner.

Before the ship reaches Nova Esperium, it is captured by pirates, and the passengers, crew and prisoners are all press-ganged into being citizens of Armada, a floating city made of thousands of ships. Tanner uses his newfound freedom to embrace his remaking. He has his body further remade and the earlier, rough work perfected, becoming an amphibious sea-creature. Treated now as an equal citizen rather than a prisoner or slave, Tanner&#x27;s loyalties fiercely lie in Armada.

Bellis meanwhile despises her new life as a librarian for the city&#x27;s vast collection of stolen books, and yearns for home. She gains the attention of the powerful Uther Doul, who is a bodyguard to the mysterious, scarred leaders of Armada known as the Lovers. Doul, for his own reasons, involves Bellis much more closely in the city&#x27;s matters. She soon becomes privy to a plan formulated by the Lovers to raise a mythical sea creature known as the avanc. Simultaneously, she becomes involved with a New Crobuzonian spy named Silas Fennec, who reveals that the grindylow of the Cold Claw Sea are planning war on New Crobuzon. Silas was on his way home to warn his leaders of this war (thus saving the millions of innocents who might be slaughtered by the grindylow) when he was captured by Armada. Bellis and Silas find physical release in each other, and commiserate that they are powerless to save their home city.

Shekel, who is learning to read with Bellis&#x27;s help, finds a strange book in the Armada&#x27;s library. He brings it to Bellis, and she realizes that it is the book the Lovers need to raise the avanc. Knowing that she must get a message home, Bellis destroys a large part of the Appendix which shows the equations and methods to raise the avanc.

With the book destroyed, the Lovers seek the book&#x27;s writer, Krüach Aum, the only person who knows how to summon the mythical creature. Armada mounts an expedition to his unnamed island home, which is the island of the dreaded Anophelii (a horrific and deadly race of mosquito-people). The Lovers find Aum and the information they need, while Bellis uses their time on the island, away from Armada, to get a message home warning of the impending grindylow invasion. Armada then successfully raises the avanc and captures it – no mean feat, as the avanc is an immense creature, several miles long. The Lovers&#x27; true plan is finally revealed: to use the great speed and pulling power of the avanc to find the fabled Scar, a place in the world where reality breaks down and anything is possible. The Lovers see this as a source of ultimate power.

On the journey far into unmapped waters, numerous matters threaten the city. Silas Fennec&#x27;s actions, which have been far from honest, single-handedly bring down the fury of the New Crobuzon navy and the inhuman wrath of the grindylows. Following this, a civil war breaks out within the city. Terribly damaged, Armada finally nears the Scar, and faces the unsettling horrors that accompany the breakdown of possibility. They pick up a shipwrecked friend from a different train of possibilities, chances and choices, who warns them of The Scar and that he saw the city fall into the wound of the world and everybody was killed. Mutiny follows and the people of Armada finally force the city to turn around and head back to the Swollen Ocean, the life of quiet and piracy, that they all want.

The last chapter of the book is another excerpt of Bellis&#x27;s letter home, in which she realizes how much she was being used by Doul. The reader is left to question how much Uther Doul actually was in control of the events in the book, which events were simply chance and which were &#x27;planned&#x27; possibility.

==Reception==
Steven Poole reviewed the book for &quot;The Guardian&quot; and struggled with the writing style at the beginning of the book, &quot;All through the first 40 pages or so you can hear the grunts of a writer straining too hard for effect&quot;, but &quot;[o]nce the novel settles down after its ill-judged beginning, Miéville begins to construct an intriguing plot of espionage and deceit&quot;. He concludes that &quot;&quot;The Scar&quot; eventually demonstrates enough invention and brutal energy, firmly ruled by a calm architectonic intelligence, to show that Miéville is one of the most imaginative young writers around in any kind of fiction.&quot;

<doc id="253251" wikidata="Q5277261" url="?curid=253251" title="Dimension of an algebraic variety">
<text>In mathematics and specifically in algebraic geometry, the dimension of an algebraic variety may be defined in various equivalent ways.

Some of these definitions are of geometric nature, while some other are purely algebraic and rely on commutative algebra. Some are restricted to algebraic varieties while others apply also to any algebraic set. Some are intrinsic, as independent of any embedding of the variety into an affine or projective space, while other are related to such an embedding.

== Dimension of an affine algebraic set ==

Let be a field, and be an algebraically closed extension. 

An affine algebraic set is the set of the common zeros in of the elements of an ideal in a polynomial ring formula_1 Let formula_2 be the &quot;K&quot;-algebra of the polynomial functions over . The dimension of is any of the following integers. It does not change if is enlarged, if is replaced by another algebraically closed extension of and if is replaced by another ideal having the same zeros (that is having the same radical). The dimension is also independent of the choice of coordinates; in other words it does not change if the are replaced by linearly independent linear combinations of them. 

The dimension of is
* &quot;The maximal length&quot; formula_3 of the chains formula_4 &quot;of distinct nonempty (irreducible) subvarieties of .&quot;
This definition generalizes a property of the dimension of a Euclidean space or a vector space. It is thus probably the definition that gives the easiest intuitive description of the notion. 
* &quot;The Krull dimension of the coordinate ring .&quot;
This is the transcription of the preceding definition in the language of commutative algebra, the Krull dimension being the maximal length of the chains formula_5 of prime ideals of .
* &quot;The maximal Krull dimension of the local rings at the points of &quot;.

This definition shows that the dimension is a &quot;local property if formula_6 is irreducible.&quot; If formula_6 is irreducible, it turns out that all the local rings at points of have the same Krull dimension (see ); thus:

* &quot;If is a variety, the Krull dimension of the local ring at any point of &quot;

This rephrases the previous definition into a more geometric language.
* &quot;The maximal dimension of the tangent vector spaces at the non singular points of &quot;.
This relates the dimension of a variety to that of a differentiable manifold. More precisely, if if defined over the reals, then the set of its real regular points, if it is not empty, is a differentiable manifold that has the same dimension as a variety and as a manifold.
* &quot;If is a variety, the dimension of the tangent vector space at any non singular point of &quot;.
This is the algebraic analogue to the fact that a connected manifold has a constant dimension. This can also be deduced from the result stated below the third definition, and the fact that the dimension of the tangent space is equal to the Krull dimension at any non-singular point (see Zariski tangent space).
* &quot;The number of hyperplanes or hypersurfaces in general position which are needed to have an intersection with which is reduced to a nonzero finite number of points.&quot;
This definition is not intrinsic as it apply only to algebraic sets that are explicitly embedded in an affine or projective space.
* &quot;The maximal length of a regular sequence in the coordinate ring &quot;.
This the algebraic translation of the preceding definition.
* &quot;The difference between and the maximal length of the regular sequences contained in &quot;.
This is the algebraic translation of the fact that the intersection of general hypersurfaces is an algebraic set of dimension . 
* &quot;The degree of the Hilbert polynomial of &quot;.
* &quot;The degree of the denominator of the Hilbert series of &quot;.
This allows, through a Gröbner basis computation to compute the dimension of the algebraic set defined by a given system of polynomial equations. Moreover, the dimension is not changed if the polynomials of the Gröbner basis are replaced with their leading monomials, and if these leading monomials are replaced with their radical (monomials obtained by removing exponents). So:
* &quot;The Krull dimension of the Stanley–Reisner ring formula_8 where formula_9 is the radical of the &quot;initial ideal&quot; of formula_10 for any admissible monomial ordering (the &quot;initial ideal&quot; of formula_10 is the set of all leading monomials of elements of formula_10).&quot;
* &quot;The dimension of the simplicial complex defined by this Stanley–Reisner ring.
* &quot;If is a prime ideal (i.e. is an algebraic variety), the transcendence degree over of the field of fractions of &quot;.
This allows to prove easily that the dimension is invariant under birational equivalence.

== Dimension of a projective algebraic set ==

Let be a projective algebraic set defined as the set of the common zeros of a homogeneous ideal in a polynomial ring formula_13 over a field , and let be the graded algebra of the polynomials over &quot;V&quot;.

All the definitions of the previous section apply, with the change that, when or appear explicitly in the definition, the value of the dimension must be reduced by one. For example, the dimension of is one less than the Krull dimension of .

== Computation of the dimension ==

Given a system of polynomial equations over an algebraically closed field formula_14, it may be difficult to compute the dimension of the algebraic set that it defines.

Without further information on the system, there is only one practical method, which consists of computing a Gröbner basis and deducing the degree of the denominator of the Hilbert series of the ideal generated by the equations.

The second step, which is usually the fastest, may be accelerated in the following way: Firstly, the Gröbner basis is replaced by the list of its leading monomials (this is already done for the computation of the Hilbert series). Then each monomial like formula_15 is replaced by the product of the variables in it: formula_16 Then the dimension is the maximal size of a subset &quot;S&quot; of the variables, such that none of these products of variables depends only on the variables in &quot;S&quot;.

This algorithm is implemented in several computer algebra systems. For example in Maple, this is the function &quot;Groebner[HilbertDimension],&quot; and in Macaulay2, this is the function &quot;dim&quot;.

== Real dimension ==

The &quot;real dimension&quot; of a set of real points, typically a semialgebraic set, is the dimension of its Zariski closure. For a semialgebraic set , the real dimension is one of the following equal integers:
* The real dimension of formula_17 is the dimension of its Zariski closure.
* The real dimension of formula_17 is the maximal integer formula_3 such that there is a homeomorphism of formula_20 in formula_17.
* The real dimension of formula_17 is the maximal integer formula_3 such that there is a projection of formula_17 over a formula_3-dimensional subspace with a non-empty interior.

For an algebraic set defined over the reals (that is defined by polynomials with real coefficients), it may occur that the real dimension of the set of its real points is smaller than its dimension as a semi algebraic set. For example, the algebraic surface of equation formula_26 is an algebraic variety of dimension two, which has only one real point (0, 0, 0), and thus has the real dimension zero.

The real dimension is more difficult to compute than the algebraic dimension.
For the case of a real hypersurface (that is the set of real solutions of a single polynomial equation), there exists a probabilistic algorithm to compute its real dimension.

<text>Pavel Alekseyevich Cherenkov ( ; July 28, 1904 – January 6, 1990) was a Soviet physicist who shared the Nobel Prize in physics in 1958 with Ilya Frank and Igor Tamm for the discovery of Cherenkov radiation, made in 1934.

==Biography==

Cherenkov was born in 1904 to Alexey Cherenkov and Mariya Cherenkova in the small village of Novaya Chigla. This town is in present-day Voronezh Oblast, Russia.

In 1928, he graduated from the Department of Physics and Mathematics of Voronezh State University. In 1930, he took a post as a senior researcher in the Lebedev Physical Institute. That same year he married Maria Putintseva, daughter of A.M. Putintsev, a Professor of Russian Literature. They had a son, Alexey, and a daughter, Yelena.

Cherenkov was promoted to section leader, and in 1940 was awarded the degree of Doctor of Physico-Mathematical Sciences. In 1953, he was confirmed as Professor of Experimental Physics. Starting in 1959, he headed the institute&#x27;s photo-meson processes laboratory. He remained a professor for fourteen years. In 1970, he became Academician of the USSR Academy of Sciences.

Cherenkov died in Moscow on January 6, 1990, and was buried in Novodevichy Cemetery.

==Discoveries in physics==

In 1934, while working under S. I. Vavilov, Cherenkov observed the emission of blue light from a bottle of water subjected to radioactive bombardment. This phenomenon, associated with charged subatomic particles moving at velocities greater than the phase velocity of light, proved to be of great importance in subsequent experimental work in nuclear physics, and for the study of cosmic rays. Eponymously, it was dubbed the Cherenkov effect, as was the Cherenkov detector, which has become a standard piece of equipment in particle-physics research for observing the existence and velocity of high-speed particles. Such a device was installed in Sputnik 3.

Pavel Cherenkov also shared in the development and construction of electron accelerators and in the investigation of photo-nuclear and photo-meson reactions.

==Awards and honours==
Cherenkov was awarded two Stalin Prizes, the first in 1946, sharing the honor with Vavilov, Frank and Tamm, and another in 1952. He was also awarded the USSR State Prize in 1977. In 1958, he was awarded the Nobel Prize in Physics for the discovery of the Cherenkov effect. He was also awarded the Soviet Union&#x27;s Hero of Socialist Labour title in 1984. Cherenkov was a member of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union since 1946.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;Ghost Fleet&quot; makes the claim that many believe the &quot;Star Trek&quot; character Pavel Chekov is named after Pavel Cherenkov.

In &quot;Starship Troopers&quot; spaceships travel faster than light using Cherenkov Drive.

<doc id="253260" wikidata="Q266237" url="?curid=253260" title="Algebraic curve">
<text>In mathematics, an affine algebraic plane curve is the zero set of a polynomial in two variables. A projective algebraic plane curve is the zero set in a projective plane of a homogeneous polynomial in three variables. An affine algebraic plane curve can be completed in a projective algebraic plane curve by homogenizing its defining polynomial. Conversely, a projective algebraic plane curve of homogeneous equation can be restricted to the affine algebraic plane curve of equation . These two operations are each inverse to the other; therefore, the phrase algebraic plane curve is often used without specifying explicitly whether it is the affine or the projective case that is considered.

If the defining polynomial of a plane algebraic curve is irreducible, then one has an &quot;irreducible plane algebraic curve&quot;. Otherwise, the algebraic curve is the union of one or several irreducible curves, called its &quot;components&quot;, that are defined by the irreducible factors. 

More generally, an algebraic curve is an algebraic variety of dimension one. (In some contexts, an algebraic set of dimension one is also called an algebraic curve, but this will not be the case in this article.) Equivalently, an algebraic curve is an algebraic variety that is birationally equivalent to an irreducible algebraic plane curve. If the curve is contained in an affine space or a projective space, one can take a projection for such a birational equivalence.

These birational equivalences reduce most of the study of algebraic curves to the study of algebraic plane curves. However, some properties are not kept under birational equivalence and must be studied on non-plane curves. This is, in particular, the case for the degree and smoothness. For example, there exist smooth curves of genus 0 and degree greater than two, but any plane projection of such curves has singular points (see Genus–degree formula).

A non-plane curve is often called a &quot;space curve&quot; or a &quot;skew curve&quot;.

== In Euclidean geometry ==
An algebraic curve in the Euclidean plane is the set of the points whose coordinates are the solutions of a bivariate polynomial equation &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0. This equation is often called the implicit equation of the curve, in contrast to the curves that are the graph of a function defining &quot;explicitly&quot; &quot;y&quot; as a function of &quot;x&quot;.

With a curve given by such an implicit equation, the first problems are to determine the shape of the curve and to draw it. These problems are not as easy to solve as in the case of the graph of a function, for which &quot;y&quot; may easily be computed for various values of &quot;x&quot;. The fact that the defining equation is a polynomial implies that the curve has some structural properties that may help in solving these problems.

Every algebraic curve may be uniquely decomposed into a finite number of smooth monotone arcs (also called &quot;branches&quot;) sometimes connected by some points sometimes called &quot;remarkable points&quot;, and possibly a finite number of isolated points called acnodes. A &quot;smooth monotone arc&quot; is the graph of a smooth function which is defined and monotone on an open interval of the &quot;x&quot;-axis. In each direction, an arc is either unbounded (usually called an &quot;infinite arc&quot;) or has an endpoint which is either a singular point (this will be defined below) or a point with a tangent parallel to one of the coordinate axes.

For example, for the Tschirnhausen cubic, there are two infinite arcs having the origin (0,0) as of endpoint. This point is the only singular point of the curve. There are also two arcs having this singular point as one endpoint and having a second endpoint with a horizontal tangent. Finally, there are two other arcs each having one of these points with horizontal tangent as the first endpoint and having the unique point with vertical tangent as the second endpoint. In contrast, the sinusoid is certainly not an algebraic curve, having an infinite number of monotone arcs.

To draw an algebraic curve, it is important to know the remarkable points and their tangents, the infinite branches and their asymptotes (if any) and the way in which the arcs connect them. It is also useful to consider the inflection points as remarkable points. When all this information is drawn on a sheet of paper, the shape of the curve usually appears rather clearly. If not, it suffices to add a few other points and their tangents to get a good description of the curve.

The methods for computing the remarkable points and their tangents are described below in the section Remarkable points of a plane curve.

== Plane projective curves ==

It is often desirable to consider curves in the projective space. An algebraic curve in the projective plane or plane projective curve is the set of the points in a projective plane whose projective coordinates are zeros of a homogeneous polynomial in three variables &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;).

Every affine algebraic curve of equation &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 may be completed into the projective curve of equation formula_1 where
formula_2
is the result of the homogenization of &quot;p&quot;. Conversely, if &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) = 0 is the homogeneous equation of a projective curve, then &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, 1) = 0 is the equation of an affine curve, which consists of the points of the projective curve whose third projective coordinate is not zero. These two operations are reciprocal one to the other, as formula_3 and, if &quot;p&quot; is defined by formula_4, then formula_5 as soon as the homogeneous polynomial &quot;P&quot; is not divisible by &quot;z&quot;.

For example, the projective curve of equation &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 − &quot;z&quot;2 is the projective completion of the unit circle of equation &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 − 1 = 0.

This implies that an affine curve and its projective completion are the same curves, or, more precisely that the affine curve is a part of the projective curve that is large enough to well define the &quot;complete&quot; curve. This point of view is commonly expressed by calling &quot;points at infinity&quot; of the affine curve the points (in finite number) of the projective completion that do not belong to the affine part.

Projective curves are frequently studied for themselves. They are also useful for the study of affine curves. For example, if &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is the polynomial defining an affine curve, beside the partial derivatives formula_6 and formula_7, it is useful to consider the derivative at infinity
formula_8

For example, the equation of the tangent of the affine curve of equation &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) = 0 at a point (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is
formula_9

== Remarkable points of a plane curve ==
In this section, we consider a plane algebraic curve defined by a bivariate polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) and its projective completion, defined by the homogenization formula_10 of &quot;p&quot;.

===Intersection with a line===
Knowing the points of intersection of a curve with a given line is frequently useful. The intersection with the axes of coordinates and the asymptotes are useful to draw the curve. Intersecting with a line parallel to the axes allows one to find at least a point in each branch of the curve. If an efficient root-finding algorithm is available, this allows to draw the curve by plotting the intersection point with all the lines parallel to the &quot;y&quot;-axis and passing through each pixel on the &quot;x&quot;-axis.

If the polynomial defining the curve has a degree &quot;d&quot;, any line cuts the curve in at most &quot;d&quot; points. Bézout&#x27;s theorem asserts that this number is exactly &quot;d&quot;, if the points are searched in the projective plane over an algebraically closed field (for example the complex numbers), and counted with their multiplicity. The method of computation that follows proves again this theorem, in this simple case.

To compute the intersection of the curve defined by the polynomial &quot;p&quot; with the line of equation &quot;ax&quot;+&quot;by&quot;+&quot;c&quot; = 0, one solves the equation of the line for &quot;x&quot; (or for &quot;y&quot; if &quot;a&quot; = 0). Substituting the result in &quot;p&quot;, one gets a univariate equation &quot;q&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = 0 (or &quot;q&quot;(&quot;x&quot;) = 0, if the equation of the line has been solved in &quot;y&quot;), each of whose roots is one coordinate of an intersection point. The other coordinate is deduced from the equation of the line. The multiplicity of an intersection point is the multiplicity of the corresponding root. There is an intersection point at infinity if the degree of &quot;q&quot; is lower than the degree of &quot;p&quot;; the multiplicity of such an intersection point at infinity is the difference of the degrees of &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot;.

===Tangent at a point===
The tangent at a point (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) of the curve is the line of equation formula_11, like for every differentiable curve defined by an implicit equation. In the case of polynomials, another formula for the tangent has a simpler constant term and is more symmetric:

formula_12

where formula_13 is the derivative at infinity. The equivalence of the two equations results from Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem applied to &quot;P&quot;.

If formula_14 the tangent is not defined and the point is a singular point.

This extends immediately to the projective case: The equation of the tangent of at the point of projective coordinates (&quot;a&quot;:&quot;b&quot;:&quot;c&quot;) of the projective curve of equation &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;, &quot;z&quot;) = 0 is

formula_15

and the points of the curves that are singular are the points such that

formula_16

(The condition &quot;P&quot;(&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, &quot;c&quot;) = 0 is implied by these conditions, by Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem.)

===Asymptotes===
Every infinite branch of an algebraic curve corresponds to a point at infinity on the curve, that is a point of the projective completion of the curve that does not belong to its affine part. The corresponding asymptote is the tangent of the curve at that point. The general formula for a tangent to a projective curve may apply, but it is worth to make it explicit in this case.

Let formula_17 be the decomposition of the polynomial defining the curve into its homogeneous parts, where &quot;pi&quot; is the sum of the monomials of &quot;p&quot; of degree &quot;i&quot;. It follows that
formula_18
and
formula_19

A point at infinity of the curve is a zero of &quot;p&quot; of the form (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, 0). Equivalently, (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is a zero of &quot;pd&quot;. The fundamental theorem of algebra implies that, over an algebraically closed field (typically, the field of complex numbers), &quot;p&quot;&quot;d&quot; factors into a product of linear factors. Each factor defines a point at infinity on the curve: if &quot;bx&quot; − &quot;ay&quot; is such a factor, then it defines the point at infinity (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, 0). Over the reals, &quot;p&quot;&quot;d&quot; factors into linear and quadratic factors. The irreducible quadratic factors define non-real points at infinity, and the real points are given by the linear factors.
If (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;, 0) is a point at infinity of the curve, one says that (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;b&quot;) is an asymptotic direction. Setting &quot;q&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;d&quot; the equation of the corresponding asymptote is
formula_20

If formula_21 and formula_22 the asymptote is the line at infinity, and, in the real case, the curve has a branch that looks like a parabola. In this case one says that the curve has a &quot;parabolic branch&quot;. If
formula_23
the curve has a singular point at infinity and may have several asymptotes. They may be computed by the method of computing the tangent cone of a singular point.

===Singular points===
The singular points of a curve of degree &quot;d&quot; defined by a polynomial &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) of degree &quot;d&quot; are the solutions of the system of equations:
formula_24
In characteristic zero, this system is equivalent to
formula_25
where, with the notation of the preceding section, formula_26
The systems are equivalent because of Euler&#x27;s homogeneous function theorem. The latter system has the advantage of having its third polynomial of degree &quot;d&quot;-1 instead of &quot;d&quot;.

Similarly, for a projective curve defined by a homogeneous polynomial &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) of degree &quot;d&quot;, the singular points have the solutions of the system
formula_27
as homogeneous coordinates. (In positive characteristic, the equation formula_28 has to be added to the system.)

This implies that the number of singular points is finite as long as &quot;p&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) or &quot;P&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) is square free. Bézout&#x27;s theorem implies thus that the number of singular points is at most (&quot;d&quot; − 1)2, but this bound is not sharp because the system of equations is overdetermined. If reducible polynomials are allowed, the sharp bound is &quot;d&quot;(&quot;d&quot; − 1)/2, this value is reached when the polynomial factors in linear factors, that is if the curve is the union of &quot;d&quot; lines. For irreducible curves and polynomials, the number of singular points is at most (&quot;d&quot; − 1)(&quot;d&quot; − 2)/2, because of the formula expressing the genus in term of the singularities (see below). The maximum is reached by the curves of genus zero whose all singularities have multiplicity two and distinct tangents (see below).

The equation of the tangents at a singular point is given by the nonzero homogeneous part of the lowest degree in the Taylor series of the polynomial at the singular point. When one changes the coordinates to put the singular point at the origin, the equation of the tangents at the singular point is thus the nonzero homogeneous part of the lowest degree of the polynomial, and the multiplicity of the singular point is the degree of this homogeneous part.

== Analytic structure ==

The study of the analytic structure of an algebraic curve in the neighborhood of a singular point provides accurate information of the topology of singularities. In fact, near a singular point, a real algebraic curve is the union of a finite number of branches that intersect only at the singular point and look either as a cusp or as a smooth curve.

Near a regular point, one of the coordinates of the curve may be expressed as an analytic function of the other coordinate. This is a corollary of the analytic implicit function theorem, and implies that the curve is smooth near the point. Near a singular point, the situation is more complicated and involves Puiseux series, which provide analytic parametric equations of the branches.

For describing a singularity, it is worth to translate the curve for having the singularity at the origin. This consists of a change of variable of the form formula_29 where formula_30 are the coordinates of the singular point. In the following, the singular point under consideration is always supposed to be at the origin.

The equation of an algebraic curve is formula_31 where is a polynomial in and . This polynomial may be considered as a polynomial in , with coefficients in the algebraically closed field of the Puiseux series in . Thus may be factored in factors of the form formula_32 where is a Puiseux series. These factors are all different if is an irreducible polynomial, because this implies that is square-free, a property which is independent of the field of coefficients.

The Puiseux series that occur here have the form 
formula_33
where is a positive integer, and is an integer that may also be supposed to be positive, because we consider only the branches of the curve that pass through the origin. Without loss of generality, we may suppose that is coprime with the greatest common divisor of the such that (otherwise, one could choose a smaller common denominator for the exponents).

Let be a primitive th root of unity. If the above Puiseux series occurs in the factorization of , then the series 
formula_34
occur also in the factorization (a consequence of Galois theory). These series are said conjugate, and are considered as a single branch of the curve, of &quot;ramification&quot; index .

In the case of a real curve, that is a curve defined by a polynomial with real coefficients, three cases may occur. If none has real coefficients, then one has a non-real branch. If some has real coefficients, then one may choose it as . If is odd, then every real value of provides a real value of , and one has a real branch that looks regular, although it is singular if . If is even, then and have real values, but only for . In this case, the real branch looks as a cusp (or is a cusp, depending on the definition of a cusp that is used).

For example, the ordinary cusp has only one branch. If it is defined by the equation formula_35 then the factorization is formula_36 the ramification index is 2, and the two factors are real and define each a half branch. If the cusp is rotated, it equation becomes formula_37 and the factorization is formula_38 with formula_39 (the coefficient has not been simplified to for showing how the above definition of is specialized). Here the ramification index is 3, and only one factor is real; this shows that, in the first case, the two factors must be considered as defining the same branch.

== Non-plane algebraic curves ==
An algebraic curve is an algebraic variety of dimension one. This implies that an affine curve in an affine space of dimension &quot;n&quot; is defined by, at least, &quot;n&quot; − 1 polynomials in &quot;n&quot; variables. To define a curve, these polynomials must generate a prime ideal of Krull dimension 1. This condition is not easy to test in practice. Therefore, the following way to represent non-plane curves may be preferred.

Let formula_40 be &quot;n&quot; polynomials in two variables &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2 such that &quot;f&quot; is irreducible. The points in the affine space of dimension &quot;n&quot; such whose coordinates satisfy the equations and inequations

formula_41

are all the points of an algebraic curve in which a finite number of points have been removed. This curve is defined by a system of generators of the ideal of the polynomials &quot;h&quot; such that it exists an integer &quot;k&quot; such formula_42 belongs to the ideal generated by formula_43.
This representation is a birational equivalence between the curve and the plane curve defined by &quot;f&quot;. Every algebraic curve may be represented in this way. However, a linear change of variables may be needed in order to make almost always injective the projection on the two first variables. When a change of variables is needed, almost every change is convenient, as soon as it is defined over an infinite field.

This representation allows us to deduce easily any property of a non-plane algebraic curve, including its graphical representation, from the corresponding property of its plane projection.

For a curve defined by its implicit equations, above representation of the curve may easily deduced from a Gröbner basis for a block ordering such that the block of the smaller variables is (&quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2). The polynomial &quot;f&quot; is the unique polynomial in the base that depends only of &quot;x&quot;1 and &quot;x&quot;2. The fractions &quot;gi&quot;/&quot;g&quot;0 are obtained by choosing, for &quot;i&quot; = 3, ..., &quot;n&quot;, a polynomial in the basis that is linear in &quot;xi&quot; and depends only on &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 and &quot;xi&quot;. If these choices are not possible, this means either that the equations define an algebraic set that is not a variety, or that the variety is not of dimension one, or that one must change of coordinates. The latter case occurs when &quot;f&quot; exists and is unique, and, for &quot;i&quot; = 3, …, &quot;n&quot;, there exist polynomials whose leading monomial depends only on &quot;x&quot;1, &quot;x&quot;2 and &quot;xi&quot;.

== Algebraic function fields ==
The study of algebraic curves can be reduced to the study of irreducible algebraic curves: those curves that cannot be written as the union of two smaller curves. Up to birational equivalence, the irreducible curves over a field &quot;F&quot; are categorically equivalent to algebraic function fields in one variable over &quot;F&quot;. Such an algebraic function field is a field extension &quot;K&quot; of &quot;F&quot; that contains an element &quot;x&quot; which is transcendental over &quot;F&quot;, and such that &quot;K&quot; is a finite algebraic extension of &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;), which is the field of rational functions in the indeterminate &quot;x&quot; over &quot;F&quot;.

For example, consider the field C of complex numbers, over which we may define the field C(&quot;x&quot;) of rational functions in C. If , then the field C(&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) is an elliptic function field. The element &quot;x&quot; is not uniquely determined; the field can also be regarded, for instance, as an extension of C(&quot;y&quot;). The algebraic curve corresponding to the function field is simply the set of points (&quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot;) in C2 satisfying .

If the field &quot;F&quot; is not algebraically closed, the point of view of function fields is a little more general than that of considering the locus of points, since we include, for instance, &quot;curves&quot; with no points on them. For example, if the base field &quot;F&quot; is the field R of real numbers, then defines an algebraic extension field of R(&quot;x&quot;), but the corresponding curve considered as a subset of R2 has no points. The equation does define an irreducible algebraic curve over R in the scheme sense (an integral, separated one-dimensional schemes of finite type over R). In this sense, the one-to-one correspondence between irreducible algebraic curves over &quot;F&quot; (up to birational equivalence) and algebraic function fields in one variable over &quot;F&quot; holds in general.

Two curves can be birationally equivalent (i.e. have isomorphic function fields) without being isomorphic as curves. The situation becomes easier when dealing with &quot;nonsingular&quot; curves, i.e. those that lack any singularities. Two nonsingular projective curves over a field are isomorphic if and only if their function fields are isomorphic.

Tsen&#x27;s theorem is about the function field of an algebraic curve over an algebraically closed field.

== Complex curves and real surfaces ==
A complex projective algebraic curve resides in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex projective space CP&quot;n&quot;. This has complex dimension &quot;n&quot;, but topological dimension, as a real manifold, 2&quot;n&quot;, and is compact, connected, and orientable. An algebraic curve over C likewise has topological dimension two; in other words, it is a surface.

The topological genus of this surface, that is the number of handles or donut holes, is equal to the geometric genus of the algebraic curve that may be computed by algebraic means. In short, if one consider a plane projection of a nonsingular curve that has degree &quot;d&quot; and only ordinary singularities (singularities of multiplicity two with distinct tangents), then the genus is , where &quot;k&quot; is the number of these singularities.

=== Compact Riemann surfaces ===
A Riemann surface is a connected complex analytic manifold of one complex dimension, which makes it a connected real manifold of two dimensions. It is compact if it is compact as a topological space.

There is a triple equivalence of categories between the category of smooth irreducible projective algebraic curves over C (with non-constant regular maps as morphisms), the category of compact Riemann surfaces (with non-constant holomorphic maps as morphisms), and the opposite of the category of algebraic function fields in one variable over C (with field homomorphisms that fix C as morphisms). This means that in studying these three subjects we are in a sense studying one and the same thing. It allows complex analytic methods to be used in algebraic geometry, and algebraic-geometric methods in complex analysis and field-theoretic methods to be used in both. This is characteristic of a much wider class of problems in algebraic geometry.

See also algebraic geometry and analytic geometry for a more general theory.

== Singularities ==
Using the intrinsic concept of tangent space, points &quot;P&quot; on an algebraic curve &quot;C&quot; are classified as &quot;smooth&quot; (synonymous: &quot;non-singular&quot;), or else &quot;singular&quot;. Given &quot;n&quot; − 1 homogeneous polynomials in &quot;n&quot; + 1 variables, we may find the Jacobian matrix as the (&quot;n&quot; − 1)×(&quot;n&quot; + 1) matrix of the partial derivatives. If the rank of this matrix is &quot;n&quot; − 1, then the polynomials define an algebraic curve (otherwise they define an algebraic variety of higher dimension). If the rank remains &quot;n&quot; − 1 when the Jacobian matrix is evaluated at a point &quot;P&quot; on the curve, then the point is a smooth or regular point; otherwise it is a &quot;singular point&quot;. In particular, if the curve is a plane projective algebraic curve, defined by a single homogeneous polynomial equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;,&quot;z&quot;) = 0, then the singular points are precisely the points &quot;P&quot; where the rank of the 1×(&quot;n&quot; + 1) matrix is zero, that is, where
formula_44

Since &quot;f&quot; is a polynomial, this definition is purely algebraic and makes no assumption about the nature of the field &quot;F&quot;, which in particular need not be the real or complex numbers. It should, of course, be recalled that (0,0,0) is not a point of the curve and hence not a singular point.

Similarly, for an affine algebraic curve defined by a single polynomial equation &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) = 0, then the singular points are precisely the points &quot;P&quot; &quot;of the curve&quot; where the rank of the 1×&quot;n&quot; Jacobian matrix is zero, that is, where

formula_45

The singularities of a curve are not birational invariants. However, locating and classifying the singularities of a curve is one way of computing the genus, which is a birational invariant. For this to work, we should consider the curve projectively and require &quot;F&quot; to be algebraically closed, so that all the singularities which belong to the curve are considered.

=== Classification of singularities ===
Singular points include multiple points where the curve crosses over itself, and also various types of &quot;cusp&quot;, for example that shown by the curve with equation &quot;x&quot;3 = &quot;y&quot;2 at (0,0).

A curve &quot;C&quot; has at most a finite number of singular points. If it has none, it can be called &quot;smooth&quot; or &quot;non-singular&quot;. Commonly, this definition is understood over an algebraically closed field and for a curve &quot;C&quot; in a projective space (i.e., &quot;complete&quot; in the sense of algebraic geometry). For example, the plane curve of equation formula_46 is considered as singular, as having a singular point (a cusp) at infinity.

&quot;In the remainder of this section, one considers a plane curve defined as the zero set of a bivariate polynomial&quot; . Some of the results, but not all, may be generalized to non-plane curves.

The singular points are classified by means of several invariants. The multiplicity is defined as the maximum integer such that the derivatives of to all orders up to vanish (also the minimal intersection number between the curve and a straight line at ).
Intuitively, a singular point has if it concentrates ordinary double points at . To make this precise, the blow up process produces so-called infinitely near points, and summing over the infinitely near points, where &quot;m&quot; is their multiplicity, produces .
For an irreducible and reduced curve and a point we can define algebraically as the length of formula_47 where formula_48 is the local ring at &quot;P&quot; and formula_49 is its integral closure.

The Milnor number of a singularity is the degree of the mapping on the small sphere of radius ε, in the sense of the topological degree of a continuous mapping, where is the (complex) gradient vector field of &quot;f&quot;. It is related to δ and &quot;r&quot; by the Milnor–Jung formula,

Here, the branching number &quot;r&quot; of &quot;P&quot; is the number of locally irreducible branches at &quot;P&quot;. For example, &quot;r&quot; = 1 at an ordinary cusp, and &quot;r&quot; = 2 at an ordinary double point. The multiplicity &quot;m&quot; is at least &quot;r&quot;, and that &quot;P&quot; is singular if and only if &quot;m&quot; is at least 2. Moreover, δ is at least &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot;-1)/2.

Computing the delta invariants of all of the singularities allows the genus &quot;g&quot; of the curve to be determined; if &quot;d&quot; is the degree, then

formula_50

where the sum is taken over all singular points &quot;P&quot; of the complex projective plane curve. It is called the genus formula.

Assign the invariants [&quot;m&quot;, δ, &quot;r&quot;] to a singularity, where &quot;m&quot; is the multiplicity, δ is the delta-invariant, and &quot;r&quot; is the branching number. Then an &quot;ordinary cusp&quot; is a point with invariants [2,1,1] and an &quot;ordinary double point&quot; is a point with invariants [2,1,2], and an ordinary &quot;m&quot;-multiple point is a point with invariants [&quot;m&quot;, &quot;m&quot;(&quot;m&quot; − 1)/2, &quot;m&quot;].

== Examples of curves ==

=== Rational curves ===
A rational curve, also called a unicursal curve, is any curve which is birationally equivalent to a line, which we may take to be a projective line; accordingly, we may identify the function field of the curve with the field of rational functions in one indeterminate &quot;F&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). If &quot;F&quot; is algebraically closed, this is equivalent to a curve of genus zero; however, the field of all real algebraic functions defined on the real algebraic variety &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;y&quot;2 = −1 is a field of genus zero which is not a rational function field.

Concretely, a rational curve embedded in an affine space of dimension &quot;n&quot; over &quot;F&quot; can be parameterized (except for isolated exceptional points) by means of &quot;n&quot; rational functions of a single parameter &quot;t&quot;; by reducing these rational functions to the same denominator, the &quot;n&quot;+1 resulting polynomials define a &quot;polynomial parametrization&quot; of the projective completion of the curve in the projective space. An example is the
rational normal curve, where all these polynomials are monomials.

Any conic section defined over &quot;F&quot; with a rational point in &quot;F&quot; is a rational curve. It can be parameterized by drawing a line with slope &quot;t&quot; through the rational point, and an intersection with the plane quadratic curve; this gives a polynomial with &quot;F&quot;-rational coefficients and one &quot;F&quot;-rational root, hence the other root is &quot;F&quot;-rational (i.e., belongs to &quot;F&quot;) also.
For example, consider the ellipse &quot;x&quot;2 + &quot;xy&quot; + &quot;y&quot;2 = 1, where (−1, 0) is a rational point. Drawing a line with slope &quot;t&quot; from (−1,0), &quot;y&quot; = &quot;t&quot;(&quot;x&quot; + 1), substituting it in the equation of the ellipse, factoring, and solving for &quot;x&quot;, we obtain

formula_51

Then the equation for &quot;y&quot; is

formula_52

which defines a rational parameterization of the ellipse and hence shows the ellipse is a rational curve. All points of the ellipse are given, except for (−1,1), which corresponds to &quot;t&quot; = ∞; the entire curve is parameterized therefore by the real projective line.

Such a rational parameterization may be considered in the projective space by equating the first projective coordinates to the numerators of the parameterization and the last one to the common denominator. As the parameter is defined in a projective line, the polynomials in the parameter should be homogenized. For example, the projective parameterization of the above ellipse is

formula_53

Eliminating &quot;T&quot; and &quot;U&quot; between these equations we get again the projective equation of the ellipse
formula_54
which may be easily obtained directly by homogenizing the above equation.

Many of the curves on Wikipedia&#x27;s list of curves are rational and hence have similar rational parameterizations.

=== Rational plane curves ===
Rational plane curves are rational curves embedded into formula_55. Given generic sections formula_56 of degree formula_57 homogeneous polynomials in two coordinates, formula_58, there is a mapformula_59 given by formula_60defining a rational plane curve of degree formula_57. There is an associated moduli space formula_62 (where formula_63 is the hyperplane class) parametrizing all such stable curves. A dimension count can be made to determine the moduli spaces dimension: There are formula_64 parameters in formula_65 giving formula_66 parameters total for each of the sections. Then, since they are considered up to a projective quotient in formula_55 there is formula_68 less parameter in formula_69. Furthermore, there is a three dimensional group of automorphisms of formula_70, hence formula_69 has dimension formula_72. This moduli space can be used to count the number formula_73 of degree formula_57 rational plane curves intersecting formula_75 points using Gromov–Witten theory. It is given by the recursive relationformula_76where formula_77.

=== Elliptic curves ===
An elliptic curve may be defined as any curve of genus one with a rational point: a common model is a nonsingular cubic curve, which suffices to model any genus one curve. In this model the distinguished point is commonly taken to be an inflection point at infinity; this amounts to requiring that the curve can be written in Tate-Weierstrass form, which in its projective version is
formula_78

If the characteristic of the field is different from 2 and 3, then a linear change of coordinates allows putting formula_79 which gives the classical Weierstrass form formula_80

Elliptic curves carry the structure of an abelian group with the distinguished point as the identity of the group law. In a plane cubic model three points sum to zero in the group if and only if they are collinear. For an elliptic curve defined over the complex numbers the group is isomorphic to the additive group of the complex plane modulo the period lattice of the corresponding elliptic functions.

The intersection of two quadric surfaces is, in general, a nonsingular curve of genus one and degree four, and thus an elliptic curve, if it has a rational point. In special cases, the intersection either may be a rational singular quartic or is decomposed in curves of smaller degrees which are not always distinct (either a cubic curve and a line, or two conics, or a conic and two lines, or four lines).

=== Curves of genus greater than one ===
Curves of genus greater than one differ markedly from both rational and elliptic curves. Such curves defined over the rational numbers, by Faltings&#x27;s theorem, can have only a finite number of rational points, and they may be viewed as having a hyperbolic geometry structure. Examples are the hyperelliptic curves, the Klein quartic curve, and the Fermat curve when is greater than three. Also projective plane curves in formula_55 and curves in formula_82 provide many useful examples.

==== Projective plane curves ====
Plane curves formula_83 of degree formula_84, which can be constructed as the vanishing locus of a generic section formula_85, have genus
formula_86
which can be computed using Coherent sheaf cohomology. Here&#x27;s a brief summary of the curves&#x27; genera relative to their degree

For example, the curve formula_87 defines a curve of genus formula_88 which is smooth since the differentials formula_89 have no common zeros with the curve. A non-example of a generic section is the curve formula_90 which, by Bezout&#x27;s theorem, should intersect at most formula_91 points; it is the union of two rational curves formula_92 intersecting at two points. Note formula_93 is given by the vanishing locus of formula_94 and formula_95 is given by the vanishing locus of formula_96. These can be found explicitly: a point lies in both if formula_97. So the two solutions are the points formula_98 such that formula_99, which are formula_100 and formula_101.

==== Curves in product of projective lines ====
Curve formula_102 given by the vanishing locus of formula_103, for formula_104, give curves of genusformula_105which can be checked using Coherent sheaf cohomology. If formula_106, then they define curves of genus formula_107, hence a curve of any genus can be constructed as a curve in formula_82. Their genera can be summarized in the table

and for formula_109, this is

<doc id="253264" wikidata="Q118382" url="?curid=253264" title="Slavery in the United States">
<text>The legal institution of human chattel slavery, comprising the enslavement primarily of Africans and African Americans, was prevalent in the United States of America from its founding in 1776 until 1865, predominantly in the South. Slavery was established throughout European colonization in the Americas. From 1526, during the early colonial period, it was practiced in what became Britain&#x27;s colonies, including the Thirteen Colonies that formed the United States. Under the law, an enslaved person was treated as property that could be bought, sold, or given away. Slavery lasted in about half of U.S. states until abolition in 1865, and issues concerning slavery seeped into every aspect of national politics, economics, and social custom. In the decades after the end of Reconstruction in 1877, many of slavery&#x27;s economic and social functions were continued through segregation, sharecropping, and convict leasing. Involuntary servitude as a punishment for crime is still legal in the United States.

By the time of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783), the status of enslaved people had been institutionalized as a racial caste associated with African ancestry. During and immediately following the Revolution, abolitionist laws were passed in most Northern states and a movement developed to abolish slavery. The role of slavery under the United States Constitution (1789) was the most contentious issue during its drafting. The Three-Fifths Clause of the Constitution gave slave states disproportionate political power, while the Fugitive Slave Clause (Article IV, Section 2, Clause 3) provided that, if a slave escaped to another state, the other state could not prevent the return of the slave to the person claiming to be his or her owner. All Northern states had abolished slavery to some degree by 1805, sometimes with completion at a future date, sometimes with an intermediary status of unpaid indentured servant.

Abolition was in many cases a gradual process. Some slaveowners, primarily in the Upper South, freed their slaves, and charitable groups bought and freed others. The Atlantic slave trade began to be outlawed by individual states during the American Revolution and was banned by Congress in 1808. Nevertheless, smuggling was common thereafter, and the U.S. Revenue Cutter Service (Coast Guard) began to enforce the ban on the high seas. It has been estimated that before 1820 a majority of serving congressmen owned slaves, and that about 30 percent of congressmen who were born before 1840 (some of whom served into the 20th century) owned slaves at some time in their lives.

The rapid expansion of the cotton industry in the Deep South after the invention of the cotton gin greatly increased demand for slave labor, and the Southern states continued as slave societies. The U.S., divided into slave and free states, became ever more polarized over the issue of slavery. Driven by labor demands from new cotton plantations in the Deep South, the Upper South sold more than a million slaves who were taken to the Deep South. The total slave population in the South eventually reached four million. As the U.S. expanded, the Southern states attempted to extend slavery into the new Western territories to allow proslavery forces to maintain power in Congress. The new territories acquired by the Louisiana Purchase and the Mexican Cession were the subject of major political crises and compromises. Slavery was defended in the South as a &quot;positive good&quot;, and the largest religious denominations split over the slavery issue into regional organizations of the North and South.

By 1850, the newly rich, cotton-growing South threatened to secede from the Union. Bloody fighting broke out over slavery in the Kansas Territory. When Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election on a platform of halting the expansion of slavery, slave states seceded to form the Confederacy. Shortly afterward, the Civil War began when Confederate forces attacked the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Sumter in Charleston, South Carolina. During the war some jurisdictions abolished slavery and, due to Union measures such as the Confiscation Acts and the Emancipation Proclamation, the war effectively ended slavery in most places. After the Union victory, the Thirteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution was ratified on December 6, 1865, prohibiting &quot;slavery [and] involuntary servitude, except as a punishment for crime.&quot;

==Background==


During most of the British colonial period, slavery existed in all the colonies. People enslaved in the North typically worked as house servants, artisans, laborers and craftsmen, with the greater number in cities. Many men worked on the docks and in shipping. In 1703, more than 42 percent of New York City households held enslaved people in bondage, the second-highest proportion of any city in the colonies, behind only Charleston, South Carolina. Enslaved people were also used as agricultural workers in farm communities, especially in the South, but also in upstate New York and Long Island, Connecticut, and New Jersey. By 1770, there were 397,924 blacks out of a population of 2.17 million in what would soon become the United States. The slaves of the colonial era were unevenly distributed: 14,867 lived in New England, where they were three percent of the population; 34,679 lived in the mid-Atlantic colonies, where they were six percent of the population; and 347,378 in the five Southern Colonies, where they were 31 percent of the population.

The South developed an agricultural economy dependent on commodity crops. Its planters rapidly acquired a significantly higher number and proportion of enslaved people in the population overall, as its commodity crops were labor-intensive. Early on, enslaved people in the South worked primarily on farms and plantations growing indigo, rice and tobacco (cotton did not become a major crop until after the 1790s). In 1720, about 65 percent of South Carolina&#x27;s population was enslaved. Planters (defined by historians in the Upper South as those who held 20 or more slaves) used enslaved workers to cultivate commodity crops. They also worked in the artisanal trades on large plantations and in many Southern port cities. The later wave of settlers in the 18th century who settled along the Appalachian Mountains and backcountry were backwoods subsistence farmers, and they seldom held enslaved people.
Beginning in the second half of the 18th century, a debate emerged over the continued importation of African slaves to the American colonies. Many in the colonies, including the Southern slavocracy, opposed further importation of slaves due to fears that it would destabilize colonies and lead to further slave rebellions. In 1772, prominent Virginians submitted a petition to the Crown, requesting that the slave trade to Virginia be abolished; it was rejected. Rhode Island forbade the importation of slaves in 1774. The influential revolutionary Fairfax Resolves called for an end to the &quot;wicked, cruel and unnatural&quot; Atlantic slave trade. All of the colonies banned slave importations during the Revolutionary War.

==Slavery in the American Revolution and early republic==


Slavery had existed for thousands of years, all around the world. In the United States and many parts of the world it was a legal practise and had become entrenched socially and economically in many societies. The ideals and principles promoted in the Enlightenment and the American Revolution helped to put slavery and the desire for its abolition on the political agenda. As historian Christopher L. Brown put it, slavery &quot;had never been on the agenda in a serious way before&quot;, but the American Revolution &quot;forced it to be a public question from there forward&quot;.

After the new country&#x27;s independence was secure, slavery was a topic of contention at the 1787 Constitutional Convention. Many of Founding Fathers of the United States were plantation owners who owned large numbers of enslaved laborers; the original Constitution preserved their right to own slaves, and they further gained a political advantage in owning slaves. Although the enslaved of the early Republic were considered sentient property, were not permitted to vote, and had no rights to speak of, they were to be enumerated in population censuses and counted as three-fifths of a person for the purposes of representation in the national legislature, the U.S. Congress.

===Slaves and free blacks who supported the Continental Army===

The rebels began to offer freedom as an incentive to motivate slaves to fight on their side. Washington authorized slaves to be freed who fought with the American Continental Army. Rhode Island started enlisting slaves in 1778, and promised compensation to owners whose slaves enlisted and survived to gain freedom. During the course of the war, about one-fifth of the Northern army was black. In 1781, Baron Closen, a German officer in the French Royal Deux-Ponts Regiment at the Battle of Yorktown, estimated the American army to be about one-quarter black. These men included both former slaves and free-born blacks. Thousands of free blacks in the Northern states fought in the state militias and Continental Army. In the South, both sides offered freedom to slaves who would perform military service. Roughly 20,000 slaves fought in the American Revolution.

===Black Loyalists===


After the Revolutionary War broke out, the British realized they lacked the manpower necessary to prosecute the war. In response, British commanders began issuing proclamations to Patriot-owned slaves, offering freedom if they fled to British lines and assisted the British war effort. Such proclamations were repeatedly issued over the course of the conflict, which resulted in up to 100,000 American slaves fleeing to British lines. Self-emancipated slaves who reached British lines were organized into a variety of military units, which served in all theaters of the war. Formerly enslaved women and children, in lieu of military service, worked instead as laborers and domestic servants. At the end of the war, freed slaves in British lines either evacuated to other British colonies or to Britain itself, were re-enslaved by the victorious Americans, or fled into the countryside.

In early 1775, the royal governor of Virginia, Lord Dunmore, wrote to the Earl of Dartmouth of his intention to free slaves owned by American Patriots in case they staged a rebellion. On November 7, 1775, Dunmore issued Dunmore&#x27;s Proclamation, which promised freedom to any slaves of American patriots who would leave their masters and join the British forces. Historians agree that the proclamation was chiefly designed for practical rather than moral reasons, and slaves owned by American Loyalists were unaffected by the proclamation. About 1,500 slaves owned by patriots escaped and joined Dunmore&#x27;s forces. A total of 18 slaves fled George Washington&#x27;s plantation, one of whom, Harry, served in Dunmore&#x27;s all-black loyalist regiment called &quot;the Black Pioneers&quot;. Escapees who joined Dunmore had &quot;Liberty to Slaves&quot; stitched on to their jackets. Most died of disease before they could do any fighting, but three hundred of these freed slaves made it to freedom in Britain. Historian Jill Lepore writes that &quot;between eighty and a hundred thousand (nearly one in five black slaves) left their homes ... betting on British victory&quot;, but Cassandra Pybus states that between 20,000 and 30,000 is a more realistic number of slaves who defected to the British side during the war.

Many slaves took advantage of the disruption of war to escape from their plantations to British lines or to fade into the general population. Upon their first sight of British vessels, thousands of slaves in Maryland and Virginia fled from their owners. Throughout the South, losses of slaves were high, with many due to escapes. Slaves also escaped throughout New England and the mid-Atlantic, with many joining the British who had occupied New York. In the closing months of the war, the British evacuated freedmen and also removed slaves owned by loyalists. Around 15,000 black loyalists left with the British, most of them ending up as free people in England or its colonies. Washington hired a slave catcher during the war, and at its end he pressed the British to return the slaves to their masters. With the British certificates of freedom in their belongings, the black loyalists, including Washington&#x27;s slave Harry, sailed with their white counterparts out of New York harbor to Nova Scotia. More than 3,000 were resettled in Nova Scotia, where they were eventually granted land and formed the community of the black Nova Scotians.

===Early abolitionism in the United States===

In the first two decades after the American Revolution, state legislatures and individuals took actions to free slaves. Northern states passed new constitutions that contained language about equal rights or specifically abolished slavery; some states, such as New York and New Jersey, where slavery was more widespread, passed laws by the end of the 18th century to abolish slavery incrementally. By 1804, all the Northern states had passed laws outlawing slavery, either immediately or over time. In New York, the last slaves were freed in 1827 (celebrated with a big July5 parade). Indentured servitude, which had been widespread in the colonies (half the population of Philadelphia had once been indentured servants), dropped dramatically, and disappeared by 1800. However, there were still forcibly indentured servants in New Jersey in 1860. No Southern state abolished slavery, but some individual owners, more than a handful, freed their slaves by personal decision, often providing for manumission in wills but sometimes filing deeds or court papers to free individuals. Numerous slaveholders who freed their slaves cited revolutionary ideals in their documents; others freed slaves as a promised reward for service. From 1790 to 1810, the proportion of blacks free in the United States increased from 8 to 13.5 percent, and in the Upper South from less than one to nearly ten percent as a result of these actions.

Starting in 1777, the rebels outlawed the importation of slaves state by state. They all acted to end the international trade, but, after the war, it was reopened in North Carolina (opened until 1794) and Georgia (opened until 1798) and South Carolina (opened until 1787, and then reopened again in 1803.) In 1807, the United States Congress acted on President Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s advice and, without controversy, made importing slaves from abroad a federal crime, effective the first day that the United States Constitution permitted this prohibition: January 1, 1808.

During the Revolution and in the following years, all states north of Maryland ( the Mason–Dixon line) took steps towards abolishing slavery. In 1777, the Vermont Republic, which was still unrecognized by the United States, passed a state constitution prohibiting slavery. The Pennsylvania Abolition Society, led in part by Benjamin Franklin, was founded in 1775, and Pennsylvania began gradual abolition in 1780. In 1783, the Supreme Judicial Court of Massachusetts ruled in &quot;Commonwealth v. Jennison&quot; that slavery was unconstitutional under the state&#x27;s new 1780 constitution. New Hampshire began gradual emancipation in 1783, while Connecticut and Rhode Island followed suit in 1784. The New York Manumission Society, which was led by John Jay, Alexander Hamilton, and Aaron Burr, was founded in 1785. New York state began gradual emancipation in 1799, and New Jersey did the same in 1804.

Shortly after the Revolution, the Northwest Territory was established, by Manasseh Cutler and Rufus Putnam (who had been George Washington&#x27;s chief engineer). Both Cutler and Putnam came from Puritan New England. The Puritans strongly believed that slavery was morally wrong. Their influence on the issue of slavery was long-lasting, and this was provided significantly greater impetus by the Revolution. The Northwest Territory (which became Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin, and part of Minnesota) doubled the size of the United States, and it was established at the insistence of Cutler and Putnam as &quot;free soil&quot;no slavery. This was to prove crucial a few decades later. Had those states been slave states, and their electoral votes gone to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s main opponent, Lincoln would not have become president. The Civil War would not have been fought. Even if it eventually had been, the North might well have lost.

===Constitution of the United States===


Slavery was a contentious issue in the writing and approval of the Constitution of the United States. The words &quot;slave&quot; and &quot;slavery&quot; did not appear in the Constitution as originally adopted, although several provisions clearly referred to slaves and slavery. Until the adoption of the 13th Amendment in 1865, the Constitution did not prohibit slavery.

Section 9 of Article I forbade the federal government from prohibiting the importation of slaves, described as &quot;such Persons as any of the States now existing shall think proper to admit&quot;, for twenty years after the Constitution&#x27;s ratification (until January 1, 1808). The Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves of 1807, passed by Congress and signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson (who had called for its enactment in his 1806 State of the Union address), went into effect on January 1, 1808, the earliest date on which the importation of slaves could be prohibited under the Constitution.

The delegates approved the Fugitive Slave Clause of the Constitution (Article IV, section 2, clause 3), which prohibited states from freeing those &quot;held to Service or Labour&quot; (meaning slaves, indentures, and apprentices) who fled to them from another state and required that they be returned to their owners. The Fugitive Slave Act of 1793 and the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850 gave effect to the Fugitive Slave Clause. Salmon P. Chase considered the Fugitive Slave Acts unconstitutional because &quot;The Fugitive Slave Clause was a compact among the states, not a grant of power to the federal government&quot;.

====Three-fifths Compromise====


In a section negotiated by James Madison of Virginia, Section2 of ArticleI designated &quot;other persons&quot; (slaves) to be added to the total of the state&#x27;s free population, at the rate of three-fifths of their total number, to establish the state&#x27;s official population for the purposes of apportionment of congressional representation and federal taxation. The &quot;Three-Fifths Compromise&quot; was reached after a debate in which delegates from Southern (slaveholding) states argued that slaves should be counted in the census just as all other persons were while delegates from Northern (free) states countered that slaves should not be counted at all. The compromise strengthened the political power of Southern states, as three-fifths of the (non-voting) slave population was counted for congressional apportionment and in the Electoral College, although it did not strengthen Southern states as much as it would have had the Constitution provided for counting all persons, whether slave or free, equally.

In addition, many parts of the country were tied to the Southern economy. As the historian James Oliver Horton noted, prominent slaveholder politicians and the commodity crops of the South had a strong influence on United States politics and economy. Horton said,

in the 72 years between the election of George Washington and the election of Abraham Lincoln, 50 of those years [had] a slaveholder as president of the United States, and, for that whole period of time, there was never a person elected to a second term who was not a slaveholder.

The power of Southern states in Congress lasted until the Civil War, affecting national policies, legislation, and appointments. One result was that most of the justices appointed to the Supreme Court were slave owners. The planter elite dominated the Southern congressional delegations and the United States presidency for nearly fifty years.

==Slavery in the 19th century==

According to demographic calculations by J. David Hacker of the University of Minnesota, approximately four out of five of all of the slaves who ever lived in the United States or the territory that became the United States (beginning in 1619 and including all colonies that were eventually acquired or conquered by the United States) were born in or imported to the United States in the 19th century. Slaves were the labor force of the South, but slave ownership was also the foundation upon which American white supremacy was constructed. Historian Walter Johnson argues that &quot;one of the many miraculous things a slave could do was make a household white...&quot;, meaning that the value of whiteness in America was in some ways measured by the ability to purchase and maintain black slaves.

Slavery in the United States was a variable thing, in &quot;constant flux, driven by the violent pursuit of ever-larger profits.&quot; Complex as it was, historians do know, however, that slavery in the United States was not a &quot;deferred-compensation trade school opportunity.&quot; Harriet Beecher Stowe summarized slavery in the United States in 1853:

===Justifications in the South===


====American slavery as &quot;a necessary evil&quot;====
In the 19th century, proponents of slavery often defended the institution as a &quot;necessary evil&quot;. At that time, it was feared that emancipation of black slaves would have more harmful social and economic consequences than the continuation of slavery. On April 22, 1820, Thomas Jefferson, one of the Founding Fathers of the United States, wrote in a letter to John Holmes, that with slavery,

The French writer and traveler Alexis de Tocqueville, in his influential &quot;Democracy in America&quot; (1835), expressed opposition to slavery while observing its effects on American society. He felt that a multiracial society without slavery was untenable, as he believed that prejudice against blacks increased as they were granted more rights (for example, in Northern states). He believed that the attitudes of white Southerners, and the concentration of the black population in the South, were bringing the white and black populations to a state of equilibrium, and were a danger to both races. Because of the racial differences between master and slave, he believed that the latter could not be emancipated.

In a letter to his wife dated December 27, 1856, in reaction to a message from President Franklin Pierce, Robert E. Lee wrote,

====American slavery as &quot;a positive good&quot;====


However, as the abolitionist movement&#x27;s agitation increased and the area developed for plantations expanded, apologies for slavery became more faint in the South. Leaders then described slavery as a beneficial scheme of labor management. John C. Calhoun, in a famous speech in the Senate in 1837, declared that slavery was &quot;instead of an evil, a gooda positive good&quot;. Calhoun supported his view with the following reasoning: in every civilized society one portion of the community must live on the labor of another; learning, science, and the arts are built upon leisure; the African slave, kindly treated by his master and mistress and looked after in his old age, is better off than the free laborers of Europe; and under the slave system conflicts between capital and labor are avoided. The advantages of slavery in this respect, he concluded, &quot;will become more and more manifest, if left undisturbed by interference from without, as the country advances in wealth and numbers&quot;.

South Carolina army officer, planter, and railroad executive James Gadsden called slavery &quot;a social blessing&quot; and abolitionists &quot;the greatest curse of the nation&quot;. Gadsden was in favor of South Carolina&#x27;s secession in 1850, and was a leader in efforts to split California into two states, one slave and one free.

Other Southern writers who also began to portray slavery as a positive good were James Henry Hammond and George Fitzhugh. They presented several arguments to defend the practice of slavery in the South. Hammond, like Calhoun, believed that slavery was needed to build the rest of society. In a speech to the Senate on March 4, 1858, Hammond developed his &quot;Mudsill Theory&quot;, defending his view on slavery by stating: &quot;Such a class you must have, or you would not have that other class which leads progress, civilization, and refinement. It constitutes the very mud-sill of society and of political government; and you might as well attempt to build a house in the air, as to build either the one or the other, except on this mud-sill.&quot; Hammond believed that in every class one group must accomplish all the menial duties, because without them the leaders in society could not progress. He argued that the hired laborers of the North were slaves too: &quot;The difference... is, that our slaves are hired for life and well compensated; there is no starvation, no begging, no want of employment,&quot; while those in the North had to search for employment.

George Fitzhugh used assumptions about white superiority to justify slavery, writing that, &quot;the Negro is but a grown up child, and must be governed as a child.&quot; In &quot;The Universal Law of Slavery&quot;, Fitzhugh argues that slavery provides everything necessary for life and that the slave is unable to survive in a free world because he is lazy, and cannot compete with the intelligent European white race. He states that &quot;The negro slaves of the South are the happiest, and in some sense, the freest people in the world.&quot; Without the South, &quot;He (slave) would become an insufferable burden to society&quot; and &quot;Society has the right to prevent this, and can only do so by subjecting him to domestic slavery.&quot;

On March 21, 1861, Alexander Stephens, Vice President of the Confederacy, delivered his Cornerstone Speech. He explained the differences between the Constitution of the Confederate States and the United States Constitution, laid out the cause for the American Civil War, as he saw it, and defended slavery:

This view of the &quot;Negro race&quot; was backed by pseudoscience. The leading researcher was Dr. Samuel A. Cartwright, a Southerner and the inventor of the mental illnesses of drapetomania (the desire of a slave to run away) and dysaesthesia aethiopica (&quot;rascality&quot;), both cured, according to him, by whipping. The Medical Association of Louisiana set up a committee, of which he was chair, to investigate &quot;the Diseases and Physical Peculiarities of the Negro Race&quot;. Their report, first delivered to the Medical Association in an address, was published in their journal in 1851, and then reprinted in part in the widely circulated &quot;DeBow&#x27;s Review&quot;.

====Proposed expansion of slavery====

Whether slavery was to be limited to the Southern states that already had it, or whether it was to be permitted in new states made from the lands of the Louisiana Purchase and Mexican Cession, was a major issue in the 1840s and 1850s. It was addressed by the Compromise of 1850 and during the Bleeding Kansas period.

Also relatively well-known are the proposals, including the Ostend Manifesto, to annex Cuba as a slave state, as well as the privately funded invasion of Cuba by Narciso López. There was also talk of making slave states of Mexico, Nicaragua (see Walker affair and Filibuster War) and other lands around the so-called Golden Circle. Less well known today, though well known at the time, is that pro-slavery Southerners:
* Actively sought to reopen the transatlantic slave trade
* Funded illegal slave shipments from the Caribbean and Africa, such as the &quot;Wanderer&quot; slave shipment to Georgia in 1858
* Wanted to reintroduce slavery in the Northern states, through federal action or Constitutional amendment making slavery legal nationwide, thus overriding state anti-slavery laws. (See Crittenden Compromise.) This was described as &quot;well underway&quot; by 1858.
* Said openly that slavery should by no means be limited to black people, since in their view it was beneficial. Northern white workers, who were allegedly &quot;wage slaves&quot; already, would allegedly have better lives if they were enslaved.

None of these ideas got very far, but they alarmed Northerners and contributed to the growing polarization of the country.

===Abolitionism in the North===

Beginning during the Revolution and in the first two decades of the postwar era, every state in the North abolished slavery. These were the first abolitionist laws in the Atlantic World. However, the abolition of slavery did not necessarily mean that existing slaves became free. In some states they were forced to remain with their former owners as indentured servants: free in name only, although they could not be sold and thus families could not be split, and their children were born free. The end of slavery did not come in New York until July 4, 1827, when it was celebrated (on July 5) with a big parade. However, in the 1830 census, the only state with no slaves was Vermont. In the 1840 census, there were still slaves in New Hampshire (1), Rhode Island (5), Connecticut (17), New York (4), Pennsylvania (64), Ohio (3), Indiana (3), Illinois (331), Iowa (16), and Wisconsin (11). There were none in these states in the 1850 census.

Most Northern states passed legislation for gradual abolition, first freeing children born to slave mothers (and requiring them to serve lengthy indentures to their mother&#x27;s owners, often into their 20s as young adults). In 1845, the Supreme Court of New Jersey received lengthy arguments towards &quot;the deliverance of four thousand persons from bondage&quot;. Pennsylvania&#x27;s last slaves were freed in 1847, Connecticut&#x27;s in 1848, and while neither New Hampshire nor New Jersey had any slaves in the 1850 Census, and New Jersey only one and New Hampshire none in the 1860 Census, slavery was never prohibited in either state until ratification of the 13th Amendment in 1865 (and New Jersey was one of the last states to ratify it).

None of the Southern states abolished slavery before 1865, but it was not unusual for individual slaveholders in the South to free numerous slaves, often citing revolutionary ideals, in their wills. Methodist, Quaker, and Baptist preachers traveled in the South, appealing to slaveholders to manumit their slaves, and there were &quot;manumission societies&quot; in some Southern states. By 1810, the number and proportion of free blacks in the population of the United States had risen dramatically. Most free blacks lived in the North, but even in the Upper South, the proportion of free blacks went from less than one percent of all blacks to more than ten percent, even as the total number of slaves was increasing through imports.

African slaves arrived in the Massachusetts Bay Colony in the 1630s, and slavery was legally sanctioned by the Puritans in 1641. Massachusetts residents participated in the slave trade, and laws were passed regulating the movement and marriage among slaves. In 1700, Samuel Sewall, Puritan abolitionist and associate justice of the Massachusetts Superior Court of Judicature, wrote &quot;The Selling of Joseph&quot;, within which he condemned slavery and the slave trade and refuted many of the era&#x27;s typical justifications for slavery. The Puritan influence on slavery was still strong at the time of the American Revolution and up until the Civil War. Of America&#x27;s first seven presidents, the two who did not own slaves, John Adams and his son John Quincy Adams, came from Puritan New England. They were wealthy enough to own slaves, but they chose not to because they believed that it was morally wrong to do so. In 1765, colonial leader Samuel Adams and his wife were given a slave girl as a gift. They immediately freed her. Just after the Revolution, in 1787, the Northwest Territory (which became the states of Ohio, Michigan, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin and part of Minnesota) was opened up for settlement. The two men responsible for establishing this territory were Manasseh Cutler and Rufus Putnam. They came from Puritan New England, and they insisted that this new territory, which doubled the size of the United States, was going to be &quot;free soil&quot;no slavery. This was to prove crucial in the coming decades. If those states had become slave states, and their electoral votes had gone to Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s main opponent, Lincoln would not have been elected president.

In the decades leading up to the Civil War, the abolitionists, such as Theodore Parker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Frederick Douglass, repeatedly used the Puritan heritage of the country to bolster their cause. The most radical anti-slavery newspaper, &quot;The Liberator,&quot; invoked the Puritans and Puritan values over a thousand times. Parker, in urging New England Congressmen to support the abolition of slavery, wrote that &quot;The son of the Puritan... is sent to Congress to stand up for Truth and Right...&quot;

Northerners predominated in the westward movement into the Midwestern territory after the American Revolution; as the states were organized, they voted to prohibit slavery in their constitutions when they achieved statehood: Ohio in 1803, Indiana in 1816, and Illinois in 1818. What developed was a Northern block of free states united into one contiguous geographic area that generally shared an anti-slavery culture. The exceptions were the areas along the Ohio River settled by Southerners: the southern portions of Indiana, Ohio, and Illinois. Residents of those areas generally shared in Southern culture and attitudes. In addition, these areas were devoted to agriculture longer than the industrializing northern parts of these states, and some farmers used slave labor. In Illinois, for example, while the trade in slaves was prohibited, it was legal to bring slaves from Kentucky into Illinois and use them there, as long as the slaves left Illinois one day per year (they were &quot;visiting&quot;). The emancipation of slaves in the North led to the growth in the population of Northern free blacks, from several hundred in the 1770s to nearly 50,000 by 1810.

Throughout the first half of the 19th century, abolitionism, a movement to end slavery, grew in strength; most abolitionist societies and supporters were in the North. They worked to raise awareness about the evils of slavery, and to build support for abolition. After 1830, abolitionist and newspaper publisher William Lloyd Garrison promoted emancipation, characterizing slaveholding as a personal sin. He demanded that slaveowners repent and start the process of emancipation. His position increased defensiveness on the part of some Southerners, who noted the long history of slavery among many cultures. A few abolitionists, such as John Brown, favored the use of armed force to foment uprisings among the slaves, as he attempted to do at Harper&#x27;s Ferry. Most abolitionists tried to raise public support to change laws and to challenge slave laws. Abolitionists were active on the lecture circuit in the North, and often featured escaped slaves in their presentations. Writer and orator Frederick Douglass became an important abolitionist leader after escaping from slavery. Harriet Beecher Stowe&#x27;s novel &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (1852) was an international bestseller, and along with the non-fiction companion &quot;A Key to Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin,&quot; aroused popular sentiment against slavery. It also provoked the publication of numerous anti-Tom novels by Southerners in the years before the American Civil War.

This struggle took place amid strong support for slavery among white Southerners, who profited greatly from the system of enslaved labor. But slavery was entwined with the national economy; for instance, the banking, shipping, insurance, and manufacturing industries of New York City all had strong economic interests in slavery, as did similar industries in other major port cities in the North. The Northern textile mills in New York and New England processed Southern cotton and manufactured clothes to outfit slaves. By 1822, half of New York City&#x27;s exports were related to cotton.

Slaveholders began to refer to slavery as the &quot;peculiar institution&quot; to differentiate it from other examples of forced labor. They justified it as less cruel than the free labor of the North.
The principal organized bodies to advocate abolition and anti-slavery reforms in the north were the Pennsylvania Abolition Society and the New York Manumission Society. Before the 1830s the antislavery groups called for gradual emancipation. By the late 1820s, under the impulse of religious evangelicals such as Beriah Green, the sense emerged that owning slaves was a sin and the owner had to immediately free himself from this grave sin by immediate emancipation.

===Prohibiting the international trade===

Under the Constitution, Congress could not prohibit the import slave trade that was allowed in South Carolina until 1808. However, the third Congress regulated against it in the Slave Trade Act of 1794, which prohibited American shipbuilding and outfitting for the trade. Subsequent acts in 1800 and 1803 sought to discourage the trade by banning American investment in the trade, and American employment on ships in the trade, as well as prohibiting importation into states that had abolished slavery, which all states except South Carolina had by 1807. The final Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves was adopted in 1807 and went into effect in 1808. However, illegal importation of African slaves (smuggling) was common. The Cuban slave trade between 1796 and 1807 was dominated by American slave ships. Despite the 1794 Act, Rhode Island slave ship owners found ways to continue supplying the slave-owning states. The overall U.S. slave-ship fleet in 1806 was estimated to be almost 75% the size of that of the British.

After Great Britain and the United States outlawed the international slave trade in 1807, British slave trade suppression activities began in 1808 through diplomatic efforts and the formation of the Royal Navy&#x27;s West Africa Squadron in 1809. The United States denied the Royal Navy the right to stop and search U.S. ships suspected as slave ships, so not only were American ships unhindered by British patrols, but slavers from other countries would fly the American flag to try to avoid being stopped. Co-operation between the United States and Britain was not possible during the War of 1812 or the period of poor relations in the following years. In 1820, the United States Navy sent under the command of Captain Edward Trenchard to patrol the slave coasts of West Africa. &quot;Cyane&quot; seized four American slave ships in her first year on station. Trenchard developed a good level of co-operation with the Royal Navy. Four additional U.S. warships were sent to the African coast in 1820 and 1821. A total of 11 American slave ships were taken by the U.S. Navy over this period. Then American enforcement activity reduced. There was still no agreement between the United States and Britain on a mutual right to board suspected slave traders sailing under each other&#x27;s flag. Attempts to reach such an agreement stalled in 1821 and 1824 in the United States Senate. A U.S. Navy presence, however sporadic, did result in American slavers sailing under the Spanish flag, but still as an extensive trade. The Webster-Ashburton Treaty of 1842 set a guaranteed minimum level of patrol activity by the U.S. Navy and the Royal Navy, and formalized the level of co-operation that had existed in 1820. Its effects, however, were minimal while opportunities for greater co-operation were not taken. The U.S. transatlantic slave trade was not effectively suppressed until 1861, during Lincoln&#x27;s presidency, when a treaty with Britain was signed whose provisions included allowing the Royal Navy to board, search and arrest slavers operating under the American flag.

===War of 1812===

During the War of 1812, British Royal Navy commanders of the blockading fleet were instructed to offer freedom to defecting American slaves, as the Crown had during the Revolutionary War. Thousands of escaped slaves went over to the Crown with their families. Men were recruited into the Corps of Colonial Marines on occupied Tangier Island, in the Chesapeake Bay. Many freed American slaves were recruited directly into existing West Indian regiments, or newly created British Army units. The British later resettled a few thousand freed slaves to Nova Scotia. Their descendants, together with descendants of the black people resettled there after the Revolution, have established the Black Loyalist Heritage Museum.

Slaveholders, primarily in the South, had considerable &quot;loss of property&quot; as thousands of slaves escaped to the British lines or ships for freedom, despite the difficulties. The planters&#x27; complacency about slave &quot;contentment&quot; was shocked by seeing that slaves would risk so much to be free. Afterward, when some freed slaves had been settled at Bermuda, slaveholders such as Major Pierce Butler of South Carolina tried to persuade them to return to the United States, to no avail.

The Americans protested that Britain&#x27;s failure to return all slaves violated the Treaty of Ghent. After arbitration by the Tsar of Russia, the British paid $1,204,960 in damages (about $ million in today&#x27;s money) to Washington, which reimbursed the slaveowners.

===Slave rebellions===


According to Herbert Aptheker, &quot;there were few phases of ante-bellum Southern life and history that were not in some way influenced by the fear of, or the actual outbreak of, militant concerted slave action.&quot;

Historians in the 20th century identified 250 to 311 slave uprisings in U.S. and colonial history. Those after 1776 include:
* Gabriel&#x27;s conspiracy (1800)
* Igbo Landing slave escape and mass suicide (1803)
* Chatham Manor Rebellion (1805)
* 1811 German Coast uprising, (1811)
* George Boxley Rebellion (1815)
* Denmark Vesey&#x27;s conspiracy (1822)
* Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion (1831)
* Black Seminole Slave Rebellion (1835–1838)
* &quot;Amistad&quot; seizure (1839)
* 1842 Slave Revolt in the Cherokee Nation
* Charleston Workhouse Slave Rebellion (1849)

In 1831, Nat Turner, a literate slave who claimed to have spiritual visions, organized a slave rebellion in Southampton County, Virginia; it was sometimes called the Southampton Insurrection. Turner and his followers killed nearly sixty white inhabitants, mostly women and children. Many of the men in the area were attending a religious event in North Carolina. Eventually Turner was captured with 17 other rebels, who were subdued by the militia. Turner and his followers were hanged, and Turner&#x27;s body was flayed. In a frenzy of fear and retaliation, the militia killed more than 100 slaves who had not been involved in the rebellion. Planters whipped hundreds of innocent slaves to ensure resistance was quelled.

This rebellion prompted Virginia and other slave states to pass more restrictions on slaves and free people of color, controlling their movement and requiring more white supervision of gatherings. In 1835, North Carolina withdrew the franchise for free people of color, and they lost their vote.

There are four known mutinies on vessels involved in the coastwise slave trade: &quot;Decatur&quot; (1826), &quot;Governor Strong&quot; (1826), &quot;Lafayette&quot; (1829), and the &quot;Creole&quot; (1841).

===Post-revolution Southern manumissions===
Although Virginia, Maryland and Delaware were slave states, the latter two already had a high proportion of free blacks by the outbreak of war. Following the Revolution, the three legislatures made manumission easier, allowing it by deed or will. Quaker and Methodist ministers in particular urged slaveholders to free their slaves. The number and proportion of freed slaves in these states rose dramatically until 1810. More than half of the number of free blacks in the United States were concentrated in the Upper South. The proportion of free blacks among the black population in the Upper South rose from less than 1 percent in 1792 to more than 10 percent by 1810. In Delaware, nearly 75 percent of black people were free by 1810.

In the United States as a whole, the number of free blacks reached 186,446, or 13.5 percent of all black people by 1810. After that period, few slaves were freed, as the development of cotton plantations featuring short-staple cotton in the Deep South drove up the internal demand for slaves in the domestic slave trade and high prices being paid for them.

South Carolina made manumission more difficult, requiring legislative approval of every manumission. Alabama banned free black people from the state beginning in 1834; free people of color who crossed the state line were subject to enslavement. Free black people in Arkansas after 1843 had to buy a $500 good-behavior bond, and no unenslaved black person was legally allowed to move into the state.

===Female slave owners===
Women exercised their right to own and control human property without their husbands&#x27; interference or permission, and they were active participants in the slave trade. For example, in South Carolina 40% of bills of sale for slaves from the 1700s to the present included a female buyer or seller. Women also governed their slaves in a manner similar to men, engaging in the same levels of physical disciplining. Like men, they brought lawsuits against those who jeopardized their ownership to their slaves.

===Black slave owners===
Despite the longstanding color line in the United States, some African Americans were slave owners themselves, some in cities and others as plantation owners in the country. Slave ownership signified both wealth and increased social status. Black slave owners were uncommon, however, as &quot;of the two and a half million African Americans living in the United States in 1850, the vast majority [were] enslaved.&quot;

===Native American slave owners===
After 1800, some of the Cherokee and the other four civilized tribes of the Southeast started buying and using black slaves as labor. They continued this practice after removal to Indian Territory in the 1830s, when as many as 15,000 enslaved blacks were taken with them.

The nature of slavery in Cherokee society often mirrored that of white slave-owning society. The law barred intermarriage of Cherokees and enslaved African Americans, but Cherokee men had unions with enslaved women, resulting in mixed-race children. Cherokee who aided slaves were punished with one hundred lashes on the back. In Cherokee society, persons of African descent were barred from holding office even if they were also racially and culturally Cherokee. They were also barred from bearing arms and owning property. The Cherokee prohibited the teaching of African Americans to read and write.

By contrast, the Seminole welcomed into their nation African Americans who had escaped slavery (Black Seminoles). Historically, the Black Seminoles lived mostly in distinct bands near the Native American Seminole. Some were held as slaves of particular Seminole leaders. Seminole practice in Florida had acknowledged slavery, though not the chattel slavery model common elsewhere. It was, in fact, more like feudal dependency and taxation. The relationship between Seminole blacks and natives changed following their relocation in the 1830s to territory controlled by the Creek who had a system of chattel slavery. Pro slavery pressure from Creek and pro-Creek Seminole and slave raiding led to many Black Seminoles escaping to Mexico.

===High demand and smuggling===

The United States Constitution, adopted in 1787, prevented Congress from completely banning the importation of slaves until 1808, although Congress regulated against the trade in the Slave Trade Act of 1794, and in subsequent Acts in 1800 and 1803. During and after the Revolution, the states individually passed laws against importing slaves. By contrast, the states of Georgia and South Carolina reopened their trade due to demand by their upland planters, who were developing new cotton plantations: Georgia from 1800 until December 31, 1807, and South Carolina from 1804. In that period, Charleston traders imported about 75,000 slaves, more than were brought to South Carolina in the 75 years before the Revolution. Approximately 30,000 were imported to Georgia.

By January 1, 1808, when Congress banned further imports, South Carolina was the only state that still allowed importation of enslaved people. The domestic trade became extremely profitable as demand rose with the expansion of cultivation in the Deep South for cotton and sugar cane crops. Slavery in the United States became, more or less, self-sustaining by natural increase among the current slaves and their descendants. Maryland and Virginia viewed themselves as slave producers, seeing &quot;producing slaves&quot; as resembling animal husbandry. Workers, including many children, were relocated by force from the upper to the lower South.

Despite the ban, slave imports continued through smugglers bringing in slaves past the U.S. Navy&#x27;s African Slave Trade Patrol to South Carolina, and overland from Texas and Florida, both under Spanish control. Congress increased the punishment associated with importing slaves, classifying it in 1820 as an act of piracy, with smugglers subject to harsh penalties, including death if caught. After that, &quot;it is unlikely that more than 10,000 [slaves] were successfully landed in the United States.&quot; But, some smuggling of slaves into the United States continued until just before the start of the Civil War.

===Colonization movement===


In the early part of the 19th century, other organizations were founded to take action on the future of black Americans. Some advocated removing free black people from the United States to places where they would enjoy greater freedom; some endorsed colonization in Africa, while others advocated emigration, usually to Haiti. During the 1820s and 1830s, the American Colonization Society (ACS) was the primary organization to implement the &quot;return&quot; of black Americans to Africa. The ACS was made up mostly of Quakers and slaveholders, and they found uneasy common ground in support of what was incorrectly called &quot;repatriation&quot;. By this time, however, most black Americans were native-born and did not want to emigrate, saying they were no more African than white Americans were British. Rather, they wanted full rights in the United States, where their families had lived and worked for generations.

In 1822, the ACS and affiliated state societies established what would become the colony of Liberia, in West Africa. The ACS assisted thousands of freedmen and free blacks (with legislated limits) to emigrate there from the United States. Many white people considered this preferable to emancipation in the United States. Henry Clay, one of the founders and a prominent slaveholder politician from Kentucky, said that blacks faced:

Deportation would also be a way to prevent reprisals against former slaveholders and white people in general, as had occurred in the 1804 Haiti massacre, which had contributed to a consuming fear amongst whites of retributive black violence, a phobia dubbed Haitianism.

===Domestic slave trade and forced migration===


The U.S. Constitution barred the federal government from prohibiting the importation of slaves for twenty years. Various states passed bans on the international slave trade during that period; by 1808, the only state still allowing the importation of African slaves was South Carolina. After 1808, legal importation of slaves ceased, although there was smuggling via Spanish Florida and the disputed Gulf Coast to the west. This route all but ended after Florida became a U.S. territory in 1821 (but see slave ships &quot;Wanderer&quot; and &quot;Clotilda&quot;).

The replacement for the importation of slaves from abroad was increased domestic production. Virginia and Maryland had little new agricultural development, and their need for slaves was mostly for replacements for decedents. Normal reproduction more than supplied these: Virginia and Maryland had surpluses of slaves. Their tobacco farms were &quot;worn out&quot; and the climate was not suitable for cotton or sugar cane. The surplus was even greater because slaves were encouraged to reproduce (though they could not marry). The pro-slavery Virginian Thomas Roderick Dew wrote in 1832 that Virginia was a &quot;negro-raising state&quot;; i.e. Virginia &quot;produced&quot; slaves. According to him, in 1832 Virginia exported &quot;upwards of 6,000 slaves&quot; per year, &quot;a source of wealth to Virginia&quot;. A newspaper from 1836 gives the figure as 40,000, earning for Virginia an estimated $24,000,000 per year. Demand for slaves was the strongest in what was then the southwest of the country: Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana, and, later, Texas, Arkansas, and Missouri. Here there was abundant land suitable for plantation agriculture, which young men with some capital established. This was expansion of the white, monied population: younger men seeking their fortune.

The most valuable crop that could be grown on a plantation in that climate was cotton. That crop was labor-intensive, and the least-costly laborers were slaves. Demand for slaves exceeded the supply in the southwest; therefore slaves, never cheap if they were productive, went for a higher price. As portrayed in &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot; (the &quot;original&quot; cabin was in Maryland), &quot;selling South&quot; was greatly feared. A recently (2018) publicized example of the practice of &quot;selling South&quot; is the 1838 sale by Jesuits of 272 slaves from Maryland, to plantations in Louisiana, to benefit Georgetown University, which has been described as &quot;ow[ing] its existence&quot; to this transaction.

The growing international demand for cotton led many plantation owners further west in search of suitable land. In addition, the invention of the cotton gin in 1793 enabled profitable processing of short-staple cotton, which could readily be grown in the uplands. The invention revolutionized the cotton industry by increasing fifty-fold the quantity of cotton that could be processed in a day. At the end of the War of 1812, fewer than 300,000 bales of cotton were produced nationally. By 1820, the amount of cotton produced had increased to 600,000 bales, and by 1850 it had reached 4,000,000. There was an explosive growth of cotton cultivation throughout the Deep South and greatly increased demand for slave labor to support it. As a result, manumissions decreased dramatically in the South.

Most of the slaves sold from the Upper South were from Maryland, Virginia and the Carolinas, where changes in agriculture decreased the need for their labor and the demand for slaves. Before 1810, primary destinations for the slaves who were sold were Kentucky and Tennessee, but, after 1810, the Deep South states of Georgia, Alabama, Mississippi, Louisiana and Texas received the most slaves. This is where cotton became &quot;king&quot;. Meanwhile, the Upper South states of Kentucky and Tennessee joined the slave-exporting states.

By 1815, the domestic slave trade had become a major economic activity in the United States; it lasted until the 1860s. Between 1830 and 1840, nearly 250,000 slaves were taken across state lines. In the 1850s, more than 193,000 enslaved persons were transported, and historians estimate nearly one million in total took part in the forced migration of this new &quot;Middle Passage&quot;. By 1860, the slave population in the United States had reached four million. Of the 1,515,605 free families in the fifteen slave states in 1860, nearly 400,000 held slaves (roughly one in four, or 25%), amounting to 8% of all American families.

The historian Ira Berlin called this forced migration of slaves the &quot;Second Middle Passage&quot; because it reproduced many of the same horrors as the Middle Passage (the name given to the transportation of slaves from Africa to North America). These sales of slaves broke up many families and caused much hardship. Characterizing it as the &quot;central event&quot; in the life of a slave between the American Revolution and the Civil War, Berlin wrote that, whether slaves were directly uprooted or lived in fear that they or their families would be involuntarily moved, &quot;the massive deportation traumatized black people, both slave and free&quot;. Individuals lost their connection to families and clans. Added to the earlier colonists combining slaves from different tribes, many ethnic Africans lost their knowledge of varying tribal origins in Africa. Most were descended from families that had been in the United States for many generations.

The firm of Franklin and Armfield was a leader in this trade. In the 1840s, almost 300,000 slaves were transported, with Alabama and Mississippi receiving 100,000 each. During each decade between 1810 and 1860, at least 100,000 slaves were moved from their state of origin. In the final decade before the Civil War, 250,000 were transported. Michael Tadman wrote in &quot;Speculators and Slaves: Masters, Traders, and Slaves in the Old South&quot; (1989) that 60–70% of inter-regional migrations were the result of the sale of slaves. In 1820, a slave child in the Upper South had a 30 percent chance of being sold South by 1860. The death rate for the slaves on their way to their new destination across the American South was less than that suffered by captives shipped across the Atlantic Ocean, but mortality nevertheless was higher than the normal death rate.

Slave traders transported two-thirds of the slaves who moved West. Only a minority moved with their families and existing master. Slave traders had little interest in purchasing or transporting intact slave families; in the early years, planters demanded only the young male slaves needed for heavy labor. Later, in the interest of creating a &quot;self-reproducing labor force&quot;, planters purchased nearly equal numbers of men and women. Berlin wrote:

The internal slave trade became the largest enterprise in the South outside the plantation itself, and probably the most advanced in its employment of modern transportation, finance, and publicity. The slave trade industry developed its own unique language, with terms such as &quot;prime hands, bucks, breeding wenches, and &quot;fancy girls&quot; coming into common use.
The expansion of the interstate slave trade contributed to the &quot;economic revival of once depressed seaboard states&quot; as demand accelerated the value of slaves who were subject to sale. Some traders moved their &quot;chattels&quot; by sea, with Norfolk to New Orleans being the most common route, but most slaves were forced to walk overland. Others were shipped downriver from such markets as Louisville on the Ohio River, and Natchez on the Mississippi. Traders created regular migration routes served by a network of slave pens, yards and warehouses needed as temporary housing for the slaves. In addition, other vendors provided clothes, food and supplies for slaves. As the trek advanced, some slaves were sold and new ones purchased. Berlin concluded, &quot;In all, the slave trade, with its hubs and regional centers, its spurs and circuits, reached into every cranny of southern society. Few southerners, black or white, were untouched.&quot;

Once the trip ended, slaves faced a life on the frontier significantly different from most labor in the Upper South. Clearing trees and starting crops on virgin fields was harsh and backbreaking work. A combination of inadequate nutrition, bad water and exhaustion from both the journey and the work weakened the newly arrived slaves and produced casualties. New plantations were located at rivers&#x27; edges for ease of transportation and travel. Mosquitoes and other environmental challenges spread disease, which took the lives of many slaves. They had acquired only limited immunities to lowland diseases in their previous homes. The death rate was so high that, in the first few years of hewing a plantation out of the wilderness, some planters preferred whenever possible to use rented slaves rather than their own.

The harsh conditions on the frontier increased slave resistance and led owners and overseers to rely on violence for control. Many of the slaves were new to cotton fields and unaccustomed to the &quot;sunrise-to-sunset gang labor&quot; required by their new life. Slaves were driven much harder than when they had been in growing tobacco or wheat back East. Slaves had less time and opportunity to improve the quality of their lives by raising their own livestock or tending vegetable gardens, for either their own consumption or trade, as they could in the East.

In Louisiana, French colonists had established sugar cane plantations and exported sugar as the chief commodity crop. After the Louisiana Purchase in 1803, Americans entered the state and joined the sugar cultivation. Between 1810 and 1830, planters bought slaves from the North and the number of slaves increased from fewer than 10,000 to more than 42,000. Planters preferred young males, who represented two-thirds of the slave purchases. Dealing with sugar cane was even more physically demanding than growing cotton. The largely young, unmarried male slave force made the reliance on violence by the owners &quot;especially savage&quot;.

New Orleans became nationally important as a slave market and port, as slaves were shipped from there upriver by steamboat to plantations on the Mississippi River; it also sold slaves who had been shipped downriver from markets such as Louisville. By 1840, the New Orleans slave market was the largest in North America. It became the wealthiest and the fourth-largest city in the nation, based chiefly on the slave trade and associated businesses. The trading season was from September to May, after the harvest.

The notion that slave traders were social outcasts of low reputation, even in the South, was initially promulgated by defensive southerners and later by figures like historian Ulrich B. Phillips. Historian Frederic Bancroft, author of &quot;Slave-Trading in the Old South&quot; (1931) found — to the contrary of Phillips&#x27;s position — that many traders were esteemed members of their communities. Contemporary researcher Steven Deyle argues that the &quot;trader&#x27;s position in society was not unproblematic and owners who dealt with the trader felt the need to satisfy themselves that they acted honorably,&quot; while Michael Tadman contends that &quot;&#x27;trader as outcast&#x27; operated at the level of propaganda&quot; whereas white slave owners almost universally professed a belief that slaves were not human like them, and thus dismissed the consequences of slave trading as beneath consideration. Similarly, historian Charles Dew read hundreds of letters to slave traders and found virtually zero narrative evidence for guilt, shame, or contrition about the slave trade: &quot;If you begin with the absolute belief in white supremacy—unquestioned white superiority/unquestioned black inferiority—everything falls neatly into place: the African is inferior racial &#x27;stock,&#x27; living in sin and ignorance and barbarism and heathenism on the &#x27;Dark Continent&#x27; until enslaved...Slavery thus miraculously becomes a form of &#x27;uplift&#x27; for this supposedly benighted and brutish race of people. And once notions of white supremacy and black inferiority are in place in the American South, they are passed on from one generation to the next with all the certainty and inevitability of a genetic trait.&quot;

In the 1828 presidential election, candidate Andrew Jackson was strongly criticized by opponents as a slave trader who transacted in slaves in defiance of modern standards or morality.

===Treatment===


The treatment of slaves in the United States varied widely depending on conditions, time, and place, but in general it was brutal, especially on plantations. Whippings and rape were routine. The power relationships of slavery corrupted many whites that had authority over slaves, with children showing their own cruelty. Masters and overseers resorted to physical punishments to impose their wills. Slaves were punished by whipping, shackling, hanging, beating, burning, mutilation, branding and imprisonment. Punishment was most often meted out in response to disobedience or perceived infractions, but sometimes abuse was carried out to re-assert the dominance of the master or overseer of the slave. Treatment was usually harsher on large plantations, which were often managed by overseers and owned by absentee slaveholders, conditions permitting abuses.

William Wells Brown, who escaped to freedom, reported that on one plantation, slave men were required to pick eighty pounds of cotton per day, while women were required to pick seventy pounds per day; if any slave failed in his or her quota, they were subject to one lash of the whip for each pound that they were short. The whipping post stood next to the cotton scales. A New York man who attended a slave auction in the mid-19th century reported that at least three-quarters of the male slaves he saw at sale had scars on their backs from whipping. By contrast, small slave-owning families had closer relationships between the owners and slaves; this sometimes resulted in a more humane environment but was not a given.

Historian Lawrence M. Friedman wrote: &quot;Ten Southern codes made it a crime to mistreat a slave... Under the Louisiana Civil Code of 1825 (art. 192), if a master was &quot;convicted of cruel treatment&quot;, the judge could order the sale of the mistreated slave, presumably to a better master. Masters and overseers were seldom prosecuted under these laws. No slave could give testimony in the courts.

According to Adalberto Aguirre&#x27;s research, 1,161 slaves were executed in the United States between the 1790s and 1850s. Quick executions of innocent slaves as well as suspects typically followed any attempted slave rebellions, as white militias overreacted with widespread killings that expressed their fears of rebellions, or suspected rebellions.

Although most slaves had lives that were very restricted in terms of their movements and agency, exceptions existed to virtually every generalization; for instance, there were also slaves who had considerable freedom in their daily lives: slaves allowed to rent out their labor and who might live independently of their master in cities, slaves who employed white workers, and slave doctors who treated upper-class white patients. After 1820, in response to the inability to import new slaves from Africa and in part to abolitionist criticism, some slaveholders improved the living conditions of their slaves, to encourage them to be productive and to try to prevent escapes. It was part of a paternalistic approach in the antebellum era that was encouraged by ministers trying to use Christianity to improve the treatment of slaves. Slaveholders published articles in Southern agricultural journals to share best practices in treatment and management of slaves; they intended to show that their system was better than the living conditions of Northern industrial workers.

Medical care for slaves was limited in terms of the medical knowledge available to anyone. It was generally provided by other slaves or by slaveholders&#x27; family members, although sometimes &quot;plantation physicians&quot;, like J. Marion Sims, were called by the owners to protect their investment by treating sick slaves. Many slaves possessed medical skills needed to tend to each other, and used folk remedies brought from Africa. They also developed new remedies based on American plants and herbs.

An estimated nine percent of slaves were disabled due to a physical, sensory, psychological, neurological, or developmental condition. However, slaves were often described as disabled if they were unable to work or bear a child, and were often subjected to harsh treatment as a result.

According to Andrew Fede, an owner could be held criminally liable for killing a slave only if the slave he killed was &quot;completely submissive and under the master&#x27;s absolute control&quot;. For example, in 1791 the North Carolina General Assembly defined the willful killing of a slave as criminal murder, unless done in resisting or under moderate correction (that is, corporal punishment).

While slaves&#x27; living conditions were poor by modern standards, Robert Fogel argued that all workers, free or slave, during the first half of the 19th century were subject to hardship. Unlike free individuals, however, enslaved people were far more likely to be underfed, physically punished, sexually abused, or killed, with no recourse, legal or otherwise, against those who perpetrated these crimes against them.

===Commodification of human tissue===
In a very grim fashion, the commodification of the human body was legal in the case of African slaves as they were not legally seen as fully human. The most popular means of commodifying slave tissues was through medical experimentation. Slaves were routinely used as medical specimens forced to take part in experimental surgeries, amputations, disease research, and developing medical techniques. Many slaves in these routine experiments were not given pain relief or analgesics, resulting in death by shock on the table. The bodies of such slaves were grouped with other medical cadavers, or sold with the bodies of other slaves sold, stolen, or grave robbed for medical experimentation. In many cases, slave cadavers were used in demonstrations and dissection tables, oftentimes resulting in their tissues being sold for profit.

For the reason of slave punishment, decoration, or self-expression, the skin of slaves was in many instances allowed to be made into leather for furniture, accessories, and clothing, a common instance of which being that of wealthy clientele sending cadaver skin to tanners and shoemakers under the guise of animal leather. Slave hair could be shaved and used for stuffing in pillows and furniture. In some instances, the inner body tissue of slaves (fat, bones, etc.) could be made into soap, medicinal grease, trophies, and other commodities.

Some enslaved persons recounted actual instances of cannibalism by white enslavers, who butchered and consumed some enslaved black people. 

===Sexual abuse, reproductive exploitation, and breeding farms===

Because of the power relationships at work, slave women in the United States were at high risk for rape and sexual abuse. Their children were repeatedly taken away from them and sold as chattel; usually they never saw each other again. Many slaves fought back against sexual attacks, and some died resisting. Others carried psychological and physical scars from the attacks. Sexual abuse of slaves was partially rooted in a patriarchal Southern culture that treated black women as property or chattel. Southern culture strongly policed against sexual relations between white women and black men on the purported grounds of racial purity but, by the late 18th century, the many mixed-race slaves and slave children showed that white men had often taken advantage of slave women. Wealthy planter widowers, notably such as John Wayles and his son-in-law Thomas Jefferson, took slave women as concubines; each had six children with his partner: Elizabeth Hemings and her daughter Sally Hemings (the half-sister of Jefferson&#x27;s late wife), respectively. Both Mary Chesnut and Fanny Kemble, wives of planters, wrote about this issue in the antebellum South in the decades before the Civil War. Sometimes planters used mixed-race slaves as house servants or favored artisans because they were their children or other relatives. While publicly opposed to race mixing, in his &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot; published in 1785, Jefferson wrote: &quot;The improvement of the blacks in body and mind, in the first instance of their mixture with the whites, has been observed by every one, and proves that their inferiority is not the effect merely of their condition of life&quot;. Historians estimate that 58% of enslaved women in the U.S. aged 15–30 years were sexually assaulted by their slave owners and other white men. As a result of centuries of slavery and such relationships, DNA studies have shown that the vast majority of African Americans also have historic European ancestry, generally through paternal lines. The average Black American genome is roughly 20-25% European, and it is estimated that as much as one third of their Y chromosomes are of European origin.

Portrayals of black men as hypersexual and savage, along with ideals of protecting white women, were predominant during this time and masked the experiences of sexual violence faced by black male slaves, especially by white women. Subject not only to rape and sexual exploitation, slaves faced sexual violence in many forms. A black man could be forced by his slaveowner to rape another slave or even a free black woman. Forced pairings with other slaves, including forced breeding, which neither slave might desire, were common. Despite explicit bans on homosexuality and sodomy, it was not uncommon for male slaves and children to be sexually harassed and assaulted by their masters in secret. Through sexual and reproductive abuse slaveowners could further enforce their control over their slaves.

The prohibition on the importation of slaves into the United States after 1808 limited the supply of slaves in the United States. This came at a time when the invention of the cotton gin enabled the expansion of cultivation in the uplands of short-staple cotton, leading to clearing lands cultivating cotton through large areas of the Deep South, especially the Black Belt. The demand for labor in the area increased sharply and led to an expansion of the internal slave market. At the same time, the Upper South had an excess number of slaves because of a shift to mixed-crops agriculture, which was less labor-intensive than tobacco. To add to the supply of slaves, slaveholders looked at the fertility of slave women as part of their productivity, and intermittently forced the women to have large numbers of children. During this time period, the terms &quot;breeders&quot;, &quot;breeding slaves&quot;, &quot;child bearing women&quot;, &quot;breeding period&quot;, and &quot;too old to breed&quot; became familiar.

As it became popular on many plantations to breed slaves for strength, fertility, or extra labor, there grew many documented instances of &quot;breeding farms&quot; in the United States. Slaves were forced to conceive and birth as many new slaves as possible. The largest farms were located in Virginia and Maryland. Because the industry of slave breeding came from a desire for larger than natural population growth of slaves, slaveowners often turned towards systematic practices for creating more slaves. Female slaves &quot;were subjected to repeated rape or forced sex and became pregnant again and again&quot;, even by incest. In horrific accounts of former slaves, some stated that hoods or bags were placed over their heads to prevent them from knowing who they were forced to have sex with. Journalist William Spivey wrote, &quot;It could be someone they know, perhaps a niece, aunt, sister, or their own mother. The breeders only wanted a child that could be sold.&quot;

In the United States in the early 19th century, owners of female slaves could freely and legally use them as sexual objects. This follows free use of female slaves on slaving vessels by the crews.

The slaveholder has it in his power, to violate the chastity of his slaves. And not a few are beastly enough to exercise such power. Hence it happens that, in some families, it is difficult to distinguish the free children from the slaves. It is sometimes the case, that the largest part of the master&#x27;s own children are born, not of his wife, but of the wives and daughters of his slaves, whom he has basely prostituted as well as enslaved.

&quot;This vice, this bane of society, has already become so common, that it is scarcely esteemed a disgrace.&quot;

&quot;Fancy&quot; was a code word that indicated that the girl or young woman was suitable for or trained for sexual use. In some cases, children were also abused in this manner. The sale of a 13-year-old &quot;nearly a fancy&quot; is documented. Zephaniah Kingsley, Jr., bought his wife when she was 13.

Furthermore, enslaved women who were old enough to bear children were encouraged to procreate, which raised their value as slaves, since their children would eventually provide labor or be sold, enriching the owners. Enslaved women were sometimes medically treated to enable or encourage their fertility. The variations in skin color found in the United States make it obvious how often black women were impregnated by whites. For example, in the 1850 Census, 75.4% of &quot;free negros&quot; in Florida were described as mulattos, of mixed race. Nevertheless, it is only very recently, with DNA studies, that any sort of reliable number can be provided, and the research has only begun. Light-skinned girls, who contrasted with the darker field workers, were preferred.

As Caroline Randall Williams was quoted in &quot;The New York Times&quot;: &quot;You Want a Confederate Monument? My Body Is a Confederate Monument.&quot; &quot;I have rape-colored skin&quot;, she added.

The sexual use of black slaves by either slave owners or by those who could purchase the temporary services of a slave took various forms. A slaveowner, or his teenage son, could go to the slave quarters area of the plantation and do what he wanted, with minimal privacy if any. It was common for a &quot;house&quot; female (housekeeper, maid, cook, laundress, or nanny) to be raped by one or more members of the household. Houses of prostitution throughout the slave states were largely staffed by female slaves providing sexual services, to their owners&#x27; profit. There were a small number of free black females engaged in prostitution, or concubinage, especially in New Orleans.

Slave owners who engaged in sexual activity with female slaves &quot;were often the elite of the community. They had little need to worry about public scorn.&quot; These relationships &quot;appear to have been tolerated and in some cases even quietly accepted&quot;. &quot;Southern women... do not trouble themselves about it&quot;. Franklin and Armfield, who were definitely the elite of the community, joked frequently in their letters about the black women and girls that they were raping. It never occurred to them that there was anything wrong in what they were doing.

Light-skinned young girls were sold openly for sexual use; their price was much higher than that of a field hand. Special markets for the fancy girl trade existed in New Orleans and Lexington, Kentucky. Historian Philip Shaw describes an occasion when Abraham Lincoln and Allen Gentry witnessed such sales in New Orleans in 1828:

Those girls who were &quot;considered educated and refined, were purchased by the wealthiest clients, usually plantation owners, to become personal sexual companions&quot;. &quot;There was a great demand in New Orleans for &#x27;fancy girls&#x27;.&quot;

The issue that did come up frequently was the threat of sexual intercourse between black males and white females. Just as the black women were perceived as having &quot;a trace of Africa, that supposedly incited passion and sexual wantonness&quot;, the men were perceived as savages, unable to control their lust, given an opportunity.

Another approach to the question was offered by Quaker and Florida planter Zephaniah Kingsley, Jr. He advocated, and personally practiced, deliberate racial mixing through marriage, as part of his proposed solution to the slavery issue: racial integration, called &quot;amalgamation&quot; at the time. In an 1829 &quot;Treatise&quot;, he stated that mixed-race people were healthier and often more beautiful, that interracial sex was hygienic, and slavery made it convenient. Because of these views, tolerated in Spanish Florida, he found it impossible to remain long in Territorial Florida, and moved with his slaves and multiple wives to a plantation, Mayorasgo de Koka, in Haiti (now in the Dominican Republic). There were many others who less flagrantly practiced interracial, common-law marriages with slaves (see &quot;Partus sequitur ventrem&quot;).

===Slave codes===


To help regulate the relationship between slave and owner, including legal support for keeping the slave as property, states established slave codes, most based on laws existing since the colonial era. The code for the District of Columbia defined a slave as &quot;a human being, who is by law deprived of his or her liberty for life, and is the property of another&quot;.

While each state had its own slave code, many concepts were shared throughout the slave states. According to the slave codes, some of which were passed in reaction to slave rebellions, teaching a slave to read or write was illegal. This prohibition was unique to American slavery, believed to reduce slaves forming aspirations that could lead to escape or rebellion. Informal education occurred when white children taught slave companions what they were learning; in other cases, adult slaves learned from free artisan workers, especially if located in cities, where there was more freedom of movement.

In Alabama, slaves were not allowed to leave their master&#x27;s premises without written consent or passes. This was a common requirement in other states as well, and locally run patrols (known to slaves as &quot;pater rollers&quot;) often checked the passes of slaves who appeared to be away from their plantations. In Alabama slaves were prohibited from trading goods among themselves. In Virginia, a slave was not permitted to drink in public within one mile of his master or during public gatherings. Slaves were not permitted to carry firearms in any of the slave states.

Slaves were generally prohibited by law from associating in groups, with the exception of worship services (a reason why the Black Church is such a notable institution in black communities today). Following Nat Turner&#x27;s rebellion in 1831, which raised white fears throughout the South, some states also prohibited or restricted religious gatherings of slaves, or required that they be officiated by white men. Planters feared that group meetings would facilitate communication among slaves that could lead to rebellion. Slaves held private, secret &quot;brush meetings&quot; in the woods.

In Ohio, an emancipated slave was prohibited from returning to the state in which he or she had been enslaved. Other Northern states discouraged the settling of free blacks within their boundaries. Fearing the influence of free blacks, Virginia and other Southern states passed laws to require blacks who had been freed to leave the state within a year (or sometimes less time) unless granted a stay by an act of the legislature.

===Religion===


Africans brought their religions with them from Africa, including Islam, Catholicism, and traditional religions.

Prior to the American Revolution, masters and revivalists spread Christianity to slave communities, including Catholicism in Spanish Florida and California, and in French and Spanish Louisiana, and Protestantism in English colonies, supported by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. In the First Great Awakening of the mid-18th century, Baptists and Methodists from New England preached a message against slavery, encouraged masters to free their slaves, converted both slaves and free blacks, and gave them active roles in new congregations. The first independent black congregations were started in the South before the Revolution, in South Carolina and Georgia. Believing that, &quot;slavery was contrary to the ethics of Jesus&quot;, Christian congregations and church clergy, especially in the North, played a role in the Underground Railroad, especially Wesleyan Methodists, Quakers and Congregationalists.

Over the decades and with the growth of slavery throughout the South, some Baptist and Methodist ministers gradually changed their messages to accommodate the institution. After 1830, white Southerners argued for the compatibility of Christianity and slavery, with a multitude of both Old and New Testament citations. They promoted Christianity as encouraging better treatment of slaves and argued for a paternalistic approach. In the 1840s and 1850s, the issue of accepting slavery split the nation&#x27;s largest religious denominations (the Methodist, Baptist and Presbyterian churches) into separate Northern and Southern organizations (see Methodist Episcopal Church, South, Southern Baptist Convention, and Presbyterian Church in the Confederate States of America). Schisms occurred, such as that between the Wesleyan Methodist Church and the Methodist Episcopal Church.

Southern slaves generally attended their masters&#x27; white churches, where they often outnumbered the white congregants. They were usually permitted to sit only in the back or in the balcony. They listened to white preachers, who emphasized the obligation of slaves to keep in their place, and acknowledged the slave&#x27;s identity as both person and property. Preachers taught the master&#x27;s responsibility and the concept of appropriate paternal treatment, using Christianity to improve conditions for slaves, and to treat them &quot;justly and fairly&quot; (Col. 4:1). This included masters having self-control, not disciplining under anger, not threatening, and ultimately fostering Christianity among their slaves by example.

Slaves also created their own religious observances, meeting alone without the supervision of their white masters or ministers. The larger plantations with groups of slaves numbering 20, or more, tended to be centers of nighttime meetings of one or several plantation slave populations. These congregations revolved around a singular preacher, often illiterate with limited knowledge of theology, who was marked by his personal piety and ability to foster a spiritual environment. African Americans developed a theology related to Biblical stories having the most meaning for them, including the hope for deliverance from slavery by their own Exodus. One lasting influence of these secret congregations is the African American spiritual.

===Mandatory illiteracy===

In a feature unique to American slavery, legislatures across the South enacted new laws to curtail the already limited rights of African Americans. For example, Virginia prohibited blacks, free or slave, from practicing preaching, prohibited them from owning firearms, and forbade anyone to teach slaves or free blacks how to read. It specified heavy penalties for both student and teacher if slaves were taught, including whippings or jail.

[E]very assemblage of negroes for the purpose of instruction in reading or writing, or in the night time for any purpose, shall be an unlawful assembly. Any justice may issue his warrant to any office or other person, requiring him to enter any place where such assemblage may be, and seize any negro therein; and he, or any other justice, may order such negro to be punished with stripes.

Slave owners saw literacy as a threat to the institution of slavery and their financial investment in it; as a North Carolina statute passed in 1830-1831 stated, &quot;Teaching slaves to read and write, tends to excite dissatisfaction in their minds, and to produce insurrection and rebellion.&quot; Literacy enabled the enslaved to read the writings of abolitionists, which discussed the abolition of slavery and described the slave revolution in Haiti of 1791–1804 and the end of slavery in the British Empire in 1833. It also allowed slaves to learn that thousands of enslaved individuals had escaped, often with the assistance of the Underground Railroad. Literacy also was believed to make the enslaved unhappy at best, insolent and sullen at worst. As put by prominent Washington lawyer Elias B. Caldwell in 1822:

Unlike in the South, slave owners in Utah were required to send their slaves to school. Black slaves did not have to spend as much time in school as Indian slaves.

===Freedom suits and Dred Scott===

With the development of slave and free states after the American Revolution, and far-flung commercial and military activities, new situations arose in which slaves might be taken by masters into free states. Most free states not only prohibited slavery, but ruled that slaves brought and kept there illegally could be freed. Such cases were sometimes known as transit cases. Dred Scott and his wife Harriet Scott each sued for freedom in St. Louis after the death of their master, based on their having been held in a free territory (the northern part of the Louisiana Purchase from which slavery was excluded under the terms of the Missouri Compromise). (Later the two cases were combined under Dred Scott&#x27;s name.) Scott filed suit for freedom in 1846 and went through two state trials, the first denying and the second granting freedom to the couple (and, by extension, their two daughters, who had also been held illegally in free territories). For 28 years, Missouri state precedent had generally respected laws of neighboring free states and territories, ruling for freedom in such transit cases where slaves had been held illegally in free territory. But in the Dred Scott case, the Missouri Supreme Court ruled against the slaves.

After Scott and his team appealed the case to the U.S. Supreme Court, Chief Justice Roger B. Taney, in a sweeping decision, denied Scott his freedom. The 1857 decision, decided 7–2, held that a slave did not become free when taken into a free state; Congress could not bar slavery from a territory; and people of African descent imported into the United States and held as slaves, or their descendants, could never be citizens and thus had no status to bring suit in a U.S. court. A state could not bar slaveowners from bringing slaves into that state. Many Republicans, including Abraham Lincoln, considered the decision unjust and evidence that the Slave Power had seized control of the Supreme Court. Anti-slavery groups were enraged and slave owners encouraged, escalating the tensions that led to civil war.

===1850 to the firing on Fort Sumter===


In 1850, Congress passed the Fugitive Slave Act, as part of the Compromise of 1850, which required law enforcement and citizens of free states to cooperate in the capture and return of slaves. This met with considerable overt and covert resistance in free states and cities such as Philadelphia, New York, and Boston. Refugees from slavery continued to flee the South across the Ohio River and other parts of the Mason–Dixon line dividing North from South, to the North and Canada via the Underground Railroad. Some white Northerners helped hide former slaves from their former owners or helped them reach freedom in Canada.

As part of the Compromise of 1850, Congress abolished the slave trade (though not the ownership of slaves) in the District of Columbia; fearing this would happen, Alexandria, regional slave trading center and port, successfully sought its removal from the District of Columbia and devolution to Virginia. After 1854, Republicans argued that the &quot;Slave Power&quot;, especially the pro-slavery Democratic Party in the South, controlled two of the three branches of the Federal government.

The abolitionists, realizing that the total elimination of slavery was unrealistic as an immediate goal, worked to prevent the expansion of slavery into the western territories that eventually would become new states. The Missouri Compromise, the Compromise of 1850, and the Bleeding Kansas period dealt with whether new states would be slave or free, or how that was to be decided. Both sides were anxious about effects of these decisions on the balance of power in the Senate.

After the passage of the Kansas–Nebraska Act in 1854, border fighting broke out in the Kansas Territory, where the question of whether it would be admitted to the Union as a slave or free state was left to the inhabitants. Migrants from both free and slave states moved into the territory to prepare for the vote on slavery. Abolitionist John Brown, the most famous of the anti-slavery immigrants, was active in the fighting in &quot;Bleeding Kansas&quot;, but so too were many white Southerners (many from adjacent Missouri) who opposed abolition.

Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s and the Republicans&#x27; political platform in 1860 was to stop slavery&#x27;s expansion. Historian James M. McPherson says that in his famous &quot;House Divided&quot; speech in 1858, Lincoln said American republicanism can be purified by restricting the further expansion of slavery as the first step to putting it on the road to &#x27;ultimate extinction.&#x27; Southerners took Lincoln at his word. When he won the presidency, they left the Union to escape the &#x27;ultimate extinction&#x27; of slavery.&quot;

The divisions became fully exposed with the 1860 presidential election. The electorate split four ways. The Southern Democrats endorsed slavery, while the Republican Party denounced it. The Northern Democrats said democracy required the people to decide on slavery locally, state by state and territory by territory. The Constitutional Union Party said the survival of the Union was at stake and everything else should be compromised.

Lincoln, the Republican, won with a plurality of popular votes and a majority of electoral votes. Lincoln, however, did not appear on the ballots of ten southern slave states. Many slave owners in the South feared that the real intent of the Republicans was the abolition of slavery in states where it already existed, and that the sudden emancipation of four million slaves would be disastrous for the slave owners and for the economy that drew its greatest profits from the labor of people who were not paid. The slave owners feared that ending the balance could lead to the domination of the federal government by the northern free states. This led seven southern states to secede from the Union. When the Confederate Army attacked a U.S. Army installation at Fort Sumter, the American Civil War began and four additional slave states seceded. Northern leaders had viewed the slavery interests as a threat politically, but with secession, they viewed the prospect of a new Southern nation, the Confederate States of America, with control over the Mississippi River and parts of the West, as politically unacceptable. Most of all, they could not accept this repudiation of American nationalism.

==Civil War and emancipation==


===American Civil War===

The American Civil War, beginning in 1861, led to the end of chattel slavery in America. Not long after the war broke out, through a legal maneuver by Union General Benjamin F. Butler, a lawyer by profession, slaves who fled to Union lines were considered &quot;contraband of war&quot;. General Butler ruled that they were not subject to return to Confederate owners as they had been before the war. &quot;Lincoln and his Cabinet discussed the issue on May 30 and decided to support Butler&#x27;s stance&quot;. Soon word spread, and many slaves sought refuge in Union territory, desiring to be declared &quot;contraband&quot;. Many of the &quot;contrabands&quot; joined the Union Army as workers or troops, forming entire regiments of the U.S. Colored Troops. Others went to refugee camps such as the Grand Contraband Camp near Fort Monroe or fled to northern cities. General Butler&#x27;s interpretation was reinforced when Congress passed the Confiscation Act of 1861, which declared that any property used by the Confederate military, including slaves, could be confiscated by Union forces.

At the beginning of the war, some Union commanders thought they were supposed to return escaped slaves to their masters. By 1862, when it became clear that this would be a long war, the question of what to do about slavery became more general. The Southern economy and military effort depended on slave labor. It began to seem unreasonable to protect slavery while blockading Southern commerce and destroying Southern production. As Congressman George W. Julian of Indiana put it in an 1862 speech in Congress, the slaves &quot;cannot be neutral. As laborers, if not as soldiers, they will be allies of the rebels, or of the Union.&quot; Julian and his fellow Radical Republicans put pressure on Lincoln to rapidly emancipate the slaves, whereas moderate Republicans favored gradual, compensated emancipation and voluntary colonization. The border states, Peace Democrats (Copperheads), and War Democrats opposed emancipation, although the border states and War Democrats eventually accepted it as part of the total war needed to save the Union.

===Emancipation Proclamation===
The Emancipation Proclamation was an executive order issued by President Abraham Lincoln on January 1, 1863. In a single stroke it changed the legal status of three million slaves in designated areas of the Confederacy from &quot;slave&quot; to &quot;free&quot;. It had the practical effect that as soon as a slave escaped the control of his or her owner, by running away or through advances of federal troops, the slave&#x27;s proclaimed freedom became actual. Plantation owners, realizing that emancipation would destroy their economic system, sometimes moved their slaves as far as possible out of reach of the Union army. By June 1865, the Union Army controlled all of the Confederacy and had liberated all of the designated slaves.

In 1861, Lincoln expressed the fear that premature attempts at emancipation would mean the loss of the border states. He believed that &quot;to lose Kentucky is nearly the same as to lose the whole game.&quot; At first, Lincoln reversed attempts at emancipation by Secretary of War Simon Cameron and Generals John C. Frémont (in Missouri) and David Hunter (in South Carolina, Georgia and Florida) to keep the loyalty of the border states and the War Democrats.

On July 22, 1862, Lincoln told his cabinet of his plan to issue a preliminary Emancipation Proclamation. Secretary of State William H. Seward advised Lincoln to wait for a victory before issuing the proclamation, as to do otherwise would seem like &quot;our last shriek on the retreat&quot;. On September 17, 1862, the Battle of Antietam provided this opportunity, and on September 22, 1862, Lincoln issued his preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, which provided that enslaved people in the states in rebellion against the United States on January 1, 1863, &quot;shall be then, thenceforward, and forever free&quot;. On September 24 and 25, the War Governors&#x27; Conference added support for the proclamation. Lincoln issued his final Emancipation Proclamation on January 1, 1863. In his letter to Albert G. Hodges, Lincoln explained his belief that

Lincoln&#x27;s Emancipation Proclamation declared freedom for slaves in the Confederate states and authorized the enlistment of African Americans in the Union Army. The Emancipation Proclamation did not free slaves in the border states, which were the slaveholding states that remained in the Union. As a practical matter, the proclamation freed only those slaves who escaped to Union lines. But the proclamation made the abolition of slavery an official war goal and was implemented as the Union took territory from the Confederacy. According to the Census of 1860, this policy would free nearly four million slaves, or over 12 percent of the total population of the United States.

Because the Emancipation Proclamation was issued under the president&#x27;s war powers, it might not have continued in force after the war ended. Therefore, Lincoln played a leading role in getting the constitutionally required two-thirds majority of both houses of Congress to vote for the Thirteenth Amendment, which made emancipation universal and permanent, &quot;except as a punishment for crime&quot;.
Enslaved African Americans had not waited for Lincoln before escaping and seeking freedom behind Union lines. From the early years of the war, hundreds of thousands of African Americans escaped to Union lines, especially in Union-controlled areas such as Norfolk and the Hampton Roads region in 1862 Virginia, Tennessee from 1862 on, and the line of Sherman&#x27;s march to the sea. So many African Americans fled to Union lines that commanders created camps and schools for them, where both adults and children learned to read and write. The American Missionary Association entered the war effort by sending teachers south to such contraband camps, for instance, establishing schools in Norfolk and on nearby plantations.

In addition, nearly 200,000 African American men served with distinction in the Union forces as soldiers and sailors; most were escaped slaves. The Confederacy was outraged by armed black soldiers and refused to treat them as prisoners of war. They murdered many, as at the Fort Pillow massacre, and re-enslaved others.

On February 24, 1863, the Arizona Organic Act abolished slavery in the newly formed Arizona Territory. Tennessee and all of the border states (except Kentucky and Delaware) abolished slavery by early 1865. Thousands of slaves were freed by the operation of the Emancipation Proclamation as Union armies marched across the South. Emancipation came to the remaining Southern slaves after the surrender of all the Confederate troops in spring 1865.

In spite of the South&#x27;s shortage of manpower, until 1865, most Southern leaders opposed arming slaves as soldiers. However, a few Confederates discussed arming slaves. Finally, in early 1865, General Robert E. Lee said that black soldiers were essential, and legislation was passed. The first black units were in training when the war ended in April.

===End of slavery===

Booker T. Washington remembered Emancipation Day in early 1863, when he was a boy of nine in Virginia:

The war ended on June 22, 1865, and following that surrender, the Emancipation Proclamation was enforced throughout remaining regions of the South that had not yet freed the slaves. Slavery officially continued for a couple of months in other locations. Federal troops arrived in Galveston, Texas, on June 19, 1865, to enforce the emancipation. The commemoration of that event, Juneteenth National Independence Day, was declared a national holiday in 2021.

The Thirteenth Amendment, abolishing slavery except as punishment for a crime, had been passed by the Senate in April 1864, and by the House of Representatives in January 1865.
The amendment did not take effect until it was ratified by three-fourths of the states, which occurred on December 6, 1865, when Georgia ratified it. On that date, the last 40,000–45,000 enslaved Americans in the remaining two slave states of Kentucky and Delaware, as well as the 200 or so perpetual apprentices in New Jersey left from the very gradual emancipation process begun in 1804, were freed. The last Americans known to have been born into legal slavery died in the 1970s.

==Reconstruction to the present==


Journalist Douglas A. Blackmon reported in his Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;Slavery By Another Name&quot; that many black persons were virtually enslaved under convict leasing programs, which started after the Civil War. Most Southern states had no prisons; they leased convicts to businesses and farms for their labor, and the lessee paid for food and board. Incentives for abuse were present.

The continued involuntary servitude took various forms, but the primary forms included convict leasing, peonage and sharecropping, with the latter eventually encompassing poor whites as well. By the 1930s, whites constituted most of the sharecroppers in the South. Mechanization of agriculture had reduced the need for farm labor, and many black people left the South in the Great Migration. Jurisdictions and states created fines and sentences for a wide variety of minor crimes and used these as an excuse to arrest and sentence black people. Under convict-leasing programs, African-American men, often guilty of petty crimes or even no crime at all, were arrested, compelled to work without pay, repeatedly bought and sold, and coerced to do the bidding of the leaseholder. Sharecropping, as it was practiced during this period, often involved severe restrictions on the freedom of movement of sharecroppers, who could be whipped for leaving the plantation. Both sharecropping and convict leasing were legal and tolerated by both the North and South. However, peonage was an illicit form of forced labor. Its existence was ignored by authorities while thousands of African Americans and poor white Americans were subjugated and held in bondage until the mid-1960s to the late 1970s. With the exception of cases of peonage, beyond the period of Reconstruction, the federal government took almost no action to enforce the Thirteenth Amendment until December 1941, when President Franklin Delano Roosevelt summoned his attorney general. Five days after the attack on Pearl Harbor, at the request of the President, Attorney General Francis Biddle issued to all federal prosecutors, instructing them to investigate actively and try any case of involuntary servitude or slavery. Several months later, convict leasing was officially abolished. But aspects have persisted in other forms. Historians argue that other systems of penal labor were all created in 1865, and convict leasing was simply the most oppressive form. Over time, a large civil rights movement arose to bring full civil rights and equality under the law to all Americans.
===Convict leasing===


With emancipation a legal reality, white Southerners were concerned with both controlling the newly freed slaves and keeping them in the labor force at the lowest level. The system of convict leasing began during Reconstruction and was fully implemented in the 1880s, officially ending in the last state, Alabama, in 1928. It persisted in various forms until it was abolished in 1942 by President Franklin D. Roosevelt during World War II, several months after the attack on Pearl Harbor involved the U.S. in the conflict. This system allowed private contractors to purchase the services of convicts from the state or local governments for a specific time period. African Americans, due to &quot;vigorous and selective enforcement of laws and discriminatory sentencing&quot;, made up the vast majority of the convicts leased. Writer Douglas A. Blackmon writes of the system:

The constitutional basis for convict leasing is that the Thirteenth Amendment, while abolishing slavery and involuntary servitude generally, expressly permits it as a punishment for crime.

===Educational issues===
Historian Mark Summers Wahlgren notes that the estimated literacy rate among formerly enslaved southern blacks at the time of emancipation was five to 10 percent, but had reached a baseline of 40 to 50 percent (and higher in cities) by the turn of the century, representing a &quot;great advance&quot;. As W. E. B. Du Bois noted, the black colleges were not perfect, but &quot;in a single generation they put thirty thousand black teachers in the South&quot; and &quot;wiped out the illiteracy of the majority of black people in the land&quot;.
Northern philanthropists continued to support black education in the 20th century, for example of a major donor to Hampton Institute and Tuskegee was George Eastman, who also helped fund health programs at colleges and in communities.

===Apologies===
In the 21st century, various legislative bodies have issued public apologies for slavery in the United States.

===Political legacy===
A 2016 study, published in &quot;The Journal of Politics&quot;, finds that &quot;[w]hites who currently live in Southern counties that had high shares of slaves in 1860 are more likely to identify as a Republican, oppose affirmative action, and express racial resentment and colder feelings toward blacks.&quot; The study contends that &quot;contemporary differences in political attitudes across counties in the American South in part trace their origins to slavery&#x27;s prevalence more than 150 years ago. &quot; The authors argue that their findings are consistent with the theory that &quot;following the Civil War, Southern whites faced political and economic incentives to reinforce existing racist norms and institutions to maintain control over the newly freed African American population. This amplified local differences in racially conservative political attitudes, which in turn have been passed down locally across generations.&quot;

A 2017 study in the &quot;British Journal of Political Science&quot; argued that the British American colonies without slavery adopted better democratic institutions to attract migrant workers to their colonies.

An article published in the &quot;Journal of Economic History&quot; in 2022 finds that former slave owners remained politically dominant long after the abolition of slavery. Using data from Texas, the authors find that &quot;[i]n 1900, still around 50 percent of all state legislators came from a slave-owning background.&quot;

Robert Fogel and Stanley Engerman, in their 1974 book &quot;Time on the Cross&quot;, argued that the rate of return of slavery at the market price was close to ten percent, a number close to investment in other assets. The transition from indentured servants to slaves is cited to show that slaves offered greater profits to their owners. A qualified consensus among economic historians and economists is that &quot;Slave agriculture was efficient compared with free agriculture. Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming&quot;, and it is the near-universal consensus among economic historians and economists that slavery was not &quot;a system irrationally kept in existence by plantation owners who failed to perceive or were indifferent to their best economic interests&quot;.

The relative price of slaves and indentured servants in the antebellum period did decrease. Indentured servants became more costly with the increase in the demand of skilled labor in England. At the same time, slaves were mostly supplied from within the United States and thus language was not a barrier, and the cost of transporting slaves from one state to another was relatively low. However, as in Brazil and Europe, slavery at its end in the United States tended to be concentrated in the poorest regions of the United States, with a qualified consensus among economists and economic historians concluding that the &quot;modern period of the South&#x27;s economic convergence to the level of the North only began in earnest when the institutional foundations of the southern regional labor market were undermined, largely by federal farm and labor legislation dating from the 1930s.&quot;

In the decades preceding the Civil War, the black population of the United States experienced a rapid natural increase. Unlike the trans-Saharan slave trade with Africa, the slave population transported by the Atlantic slave trade to the United States was sex-balanced. The slave population multiplied nearly fourfold between 1810 and 1860, despite the passage of the Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves signed into law by President Thomas Jefferson in 1807 banning the international slave trade. Thus, it is also the universal consensus among modern economic historians and economists that slavery in the United States was not &quot;economically moribund on the eve of the Civil War&quot;. In the 2010s, several historians, among them Edward E. Baptist, Sven Beckert, Walter Johnson and Calvin Schermerhorn, have posited that slavery was integral in the development of American capitalism. Johnson wrote in &quot;River of Dark Dreams&quot; (2013): &quot;The cords of credit and debt—of advance and obligation—that cinched the Atlantic economy together were anchored with the mutually defining values of land and slaves: without land and slaves, there was no credit, and without slaves, land itself was valueless. Promises made in the Mississippi Valley were backed by the value of slaves and fulfilled in their labor.&quot; Other economic historians have rejected that thesis.

A 2023 study estimates that prior to the onset of the US Civil War, the enslaved population produced 12.6% of US national product.

Slavery had a long-lasting impact on wealth and racial inequality in the United States. Black families whose ancestors were freed before the start of the Civil War have substantially better socio-economic outcomes than families who were freed in the Civil War.

===Efficiency of slaves===
Scholars disagree on how to quantify the efficiency of slavery. In &quot;Time on the Cross&quot; Fogel and Engerman equate efficiency to total factor productivity (TFP), the output per average unit of input on a farm. Using this measurement, Southern farms that enslaved black people using the gang system were 35% more efficient than Northern farms, which used free labor. Under the gang system, groups of slaves perform synchronized tasks under the constant vigilance of an overseer. Each group was like a part of a machine. If perceived to be working below his capacity, a slave could be punished. Fogel argues that this kind of negative enforcement was not frequent and that slaves and free laborers had a similar quality of life; however, there is controversy on this last point. A critique of Fogel and Engerman&#x27;s view was published by Paul A. David in 1976.

In 1995, a random survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association sought to study the views of economists and economic historians on the debate. The study found that 72 percent of economists and 65 percent of economic historians would generally agree that &quot;Slave agriculture was efficient compared with free agriculture. Economies of scale, effective management, and intensive utilization of labor and capital made southern slave agriculture considerably more efficient than nonslave southern farming.&quot; 48 percent of the economists agreed without provisos, while 24 percent agreed when provisos were included in the statement. On the other hand, 58 percent of economic historians and 42 percent of economists disagreed with Fogel and Engerman&#x27;s &quot;proposition that the material (not psychological) conditions of the lives of slaves compared favorably with those of free industrial workers in the decades before the Civil War&quot;.

===Prices of slaves===
The U.S. has a capitalist economy so the price of slaves was determined by the law of supply and demand. For example, following bans on the import of slaves after the UK&#x27;s Slave Trade Act 1807 and the American 1807 Act Prohibiting Importation of Slaves, the prices for slaves increased. The markets for the products produced by slaves also affected the price of slaves (e.g. the price of slaves fell when the price of cotton fell in 1840). Anticipation of slavery&#x27;s abolition also influenced prices. During the Civil War the price for slave men in New Orleans dropped from $1,381 in 1861 to $1,116 by 1862 (the city was captured by U.S. forces in the Spring of 1862).

Controlling for inflation, prices of slaves rose dramatically in the six decades prior to the Civil War, reflecting demand due to commodity cotton, as well as use of slaves in shipping and manufacturing. Although the prices of slaves relative to indentured servants declined, both got more expensive. Cotton production was rising and relied on the use of slaves to yield high profits. Fogel and Engeman initially argued that if the Civil War had not happened, the slave prices would have increased even more, an average of more than fifty percent by 1890.

Prices reflected the characteristics of the slave; such factors as sex, age, nature, and height were all taken into account to determine the price of a slave. Over the life-cycle, the price of enslaved women was higher than their male counterparts up to puberty age, as they would likely bear children who their masters could sell as slaves and could be used as slave laborers. Men around the age of 25 were the most valued, as they were at the highest level of productivity and still had a considerable life-span. If slaves had a history of fights or escapes, their price was lowered reflecting what planters believed was risk of repeating such behavior. Slave traders and buyers would examine a slave&#x27;s back for whipping scars; a large number of injuries would be seen as evidence of laziness or rebelliousness, rather than the previous master&#x27;s brutality, and would lower the slave&#x27;s price. Taller male slaves were priced at a higher level, as height was viewed as a proxy for fitness and productivity.

===Effects on Southern economic development===
While slavery brought profits in the short run, discussion continues on the economic benefits of slavery in the long run. In 1995, a random anonymous survey of 178 members of the Economic History Association found that out of the forty propositions about American economic history that were surveyed, the group of propositions most disputed by economic historians and economists were those about the postbellum economy of the American South (along with the Great Depression). The only exception was the proposition initially put forward by historian Gavin Wright that the &quot;modern period of the South&#x27;s economic convergence to the level of the North only began in earnest when the institutional foundations of the southern regional labor market were undermined, largely by federal farm and labor legislation dating from the 1930s.&quot; 62 percent of economists (24 percent with and 38 percent without provisos) and 73 percent of historians (23 percent with and 50 percent without provisos) agreed with this statement. Wright has also argued that the private investment of monetary resources in the cotton industry, among others, delayed development in the South of commercial and industrial institutions. There was little public investment in railroads or other infrastructure. Wright argues that agricultural technology was far more developed in the South, representing an economic advantage of the South over the North of the United States.

In &quot;Democracy in America&quot;, Alexis de Tocqueville noted that &quot;the colonies in which there were no slaves became more populous and more rich than those in which slavery flourished&quot;. In 1857, in &quot;The Impending Crisis of the South: How to Meet It&quot;, Hinton Rowan Helper made the same point. Economists Peter H. Lindert and Jeffrey G. Williamson, in a pair of articles published in 2012 and 2013, found that, despite the American South initially having per capita income roughly double that of the North in 1774, incomes in the South had declined 27% by 1800 and continued to decline over the next four decades, while the economies in New England and the Mid-Atlantic states vastly expanded. By 1840, per capita income in the South was well behind the Northeast and the national average (Note: this is also true in the early 21st century).

Lindert and Williamson argue that this antebellum period is an example of what economists Daron Acemoglu, Simon Johnson, and James A. Robinson call &quot;a reversal of fortune&quot;. In his essay &quot;The Real History of Slavery&quot;, economist Thomas Sowell reiterated and augmented the observation made by de Tocqueville by comparing slavery in the United States to slavery in Brazil. He notes that slave societies reflected similar economic trends in those and other parts of the world, suggesting that the trend Lindert and Williamson identify may have continued until the American Civil War:

Sowell also notes in &quot;Ethnic America: A History&quot;, citing historians Clement Eaton and Eugene Genovese, that three-quarters of Southern white families owned no slaves at all. Most slaveholders lived on farms rather than plantations, and few plantations were as large as the fictional ones depicted in &quot;Gone with the Wind&quot;. In &quot;The Real History of Slavery&quot;, Sowell also notes in comparison to slavery in the Arab world and the Middle East (where slaves were seldom used for productive purposes) and China (where the slaves consumed the entire output they created), Sowell observes that many commercial slaveowners in the antebellum South tended to be spendthrift and many lost their plantations due to creditor foreclosures, and in Britain, profits by British slave traders only amounted to two percent of British domestic investment at the height of the Atlantic slave trade in the 18th century. Sowell draws the following conclusion regarding the macroeconomic value of slavery:

In short, even though some individual slaveowners grew rich and some family fortunes were founded on the exploitation of slaves, that is very different from saying that the whole society, or even its non-slave population as a whole, was more economically advanced than it would have been in the absence of slavery. What this means is that, whether employed as domestic servants or producing crops or other goods, millions suffered exploitation and dehumanization for no higher purpose than the... aggrandizement of slaveowners.

Eric Hilt noted that, while some historians have suggested slavery was necessary for the Industrial Revolution (on the grounds that American slave plantations produced most of the raw cotton for the British textiles market and the British textiles market was the vanguard of the Industrial Revolution), it is not clear if this is actually true; there is no evidence that cotton could not have been mass-produced by yeoman farmers rather than slave plantations if the latter had not existed (as their existence tended to force yeoman farmers into subsistence farming) and there is some evidence that they certainly could have. The soil and climate of the American South were excellent for growing cotton, so it is not unreasonable to postulate that farms without slaves could have produced substantial amounts of cotton; even if they did not produce as much as the plantations did, it could still have been enough to serve the demand of British producers. Similar arguments have been made by other historians.

===Sexual economy of American slavery===
Scholar Adrienne Davis articulates how the economics of slavery also can be defined as a sexual economy, specifically focusing on how black women were expected to perform physical, sexual and reproductive labor to provide a consistent enslaved workforce and increase the profits of white slavers. Davis writes that black women were needed for their &quot;sexual and reproductive labor to satisfy the economic, political, and personal interest of white men of the elite class&quot; articulating that black women&#x27;s reproductive capacity was important in the maintenance of the system of slavery due to its ability to perpetuate an enslaved workforce. She is also drawing attention to black women&#x27;s labor being needed to maintain the aristocracy of a white ruling class, due to the intimate nature of reproduction and its potential for producing more enslaved peoples.

Due to the institution of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, black women&#x27;s wombs became the site where slavery was developed and transferred, meaning that black women were not only used for their physical labor, but for their sexual and reproductive labor as well.

&quot;The rule that the children&#x27;s status follows their mothers&#x27; was a foundational one for our economy. It converted enslaved women&#x27;s reproductive capacity into market capital&quot;

This articulation by Davis illustrates how black women&#x27;s reproductive capacity was commodified under slavery, and that an analysis of the economic structures of slavery requires an acknowledgment of how pivotal black women&#x27;s sexuality was in maintaining slavery&#x27;s economic power. Davis writes how black women performed labor under slavery, writing: &quot;[black women were] male when convenient and horrifically female when needed&quot;. The fluctuating expectations of black women&#x27;s gendered labor under slavery disrupted the white normative roles that were assigned to white men and white women. This ungendering black women received under slavery contributed to the systemic dehumanization experienced by enslaved black women, as they were unable to receive the expectations or experiences of either gender within the white binary.

Davis&#x27;s arguments address the fact that, under slavery, black women&#x27;s sexuality became linked to the economic and public sphere, making their intimate lives into public institutions. Black women&#x27;s physical labor was gendered as masculine under slavery when they were needed to yield more profit, but their reproductive capacities and sexual labor were equally as important in maintaining white power over black communities and perpetuating an enslaved workforce.

==Geography and demography==
===Slave importation===
About 600,000 slaves were transported to the United States, or five percent of the 12 million slaves taken from Africa. About 310,000 of these persons were imported into the Thirteen Colonies before 1776: 40 percent directly, and the rest from the Caribbean.

The great majority of enslaved Africans were transported to sugar plantations in the Caribbean and to Portuguese Brazil. As life expectancy was short, their numbers had to be continually replenished. Life expectancy was much higher in the United States, and the enslaved population was successful in reproduction, which was called &quot;natural increase&quot; by enslavers. The population of enslaved people in the United States grew to by the 1860 census. Historian J. David Hacker conducted research that estimated that the cumulative number of slaves in colonial America and the United States (1619–1865) was 10 million.

===Origins of American slaves===


===Distribution of slaves===


For various reasons, the census did not always include all of the slaves, especially in the West. California was admitted as a free state and reported no slaves. However, there were many slaves that were brought to work in the mines during the California Gold Rush. Some Californian communities openly tolerated slavery, such as San Bernardino, which was mostly made up of transplants from the neighboring slave territory of Utah. New Mexico Territory never reported any slaves on the census, yet sued the government for compensation for 600 slaves that were freed when Congress outlawed slavery in the territory. Utah was actively trying to hide its slave population from Congress and did not report slaves in several communities. Additionally, the census did not traditionally include Native Americans, and hence did not include Native American slaves or Native African slaves owned by Native Americans. There were hundreds of Native American slaves in California, Utah and New Mexico that were never recorded in the census.

===Distribution of slaveholders===
As of the 1860 census, one may compute the following statistics on slaveholding:

* Enumerating slave schedules by county, 393,975 named persons held 3,950,546 unnamed slaves, for an average of about ten slaves per holder. As some large holders held slaves in multiple counties and are thus multiply counted, this slightly overestimates the number of slaveholders.
* Excluding slaves, the 1860 U.S. population was 27,167,529; therefore, approximately 1.45% of free persons (roughly one in 69) was a named slaveholder (393,975 named slaveholders among 27,167,529 free persons). By counting only named slaveholders, this approach does not acknowledge people who benefited from slavery by being in a slaveowning household, e.g., the wife and children of an owner; in 1850, there was an average of 5.55 people per household, so on average, around 8.05% of free persons lived in a slave-owning household. In the South, 33% of families owned at least one slave. According to historian Joseph Glatthaar, the number of soldiers of the Confederacy&#x27;s Army of Northern Virginia who either owned slaves or came from slave owning households is &quot;almost one of every two 1861 recruits&quot;. In addition he notes that, &quot;Untold numbers of enlistees rented land from, sold crops to, or worked for slaveholders. In the final tabulation, the vast majority of the volunteers of 1861 had a direct connection to slavery.&quot;
* It is estimated by the transcriber Tom Blake, that holders of 200 or more slaves, constituting less than 1% of all U.S. slaveholders (fewer than 4,000 persons, one in 7,000 free persons, or 0.015% of the population) held an estimated 20–30% of all slaves (800,000 to 1,200,000 slaves). Nineteen holders of 500 or more slaves have been identified. The largest slaveholder was Joshua John Ward, of Georgetown, South Carolina, who in 1850 held 1,092 slaves, and whose heirs in 1860 held 1,130 or 1,131 slaveshe was dubbed &quot;the king of the rice planters&quot;, and one of his plantations is now part of Brookgreen Gardens.
* The percentage of families that owned slaves in 1860 in various groupings of states was as follows:

==Historiography==


The historian Peter Kolchin, writing in 1993, noted that until the latter decades of the 20th century, historians of slavery had primarily concerned themselves with the culture, practices and economics of the slaveholders, not with the slaves. This was in part due to the circumstance that most slaveholders were literate and left behind written records, whereas slaves were largely illiterate and not in a position to leave written records. Scholars differed as to whether slavery should be considered a benign or a &quot;harshly exploitive&quot; institution.

Much of the history written prior to the 1950s had a distinctive racist slant to it. By the 1970s and 1980s, historians were using archaeological records, black folklore and statistical data to develop a much more detailed and nuanced picture of slave life. Individuals were shown to have been resilient and somewhat autonomous in many of their activities, within the limits of their situation and despite its precariousness. Historians who wrote in this era include John Blassingame (&quot;Slave Community&quot;), Eugene Genovese (&quot;Roll, Jordan, Roll&quot;), Leslie Howard Owens (&quot;This Species of Property&quot;), and Herbert Gutman (&quot;The Black Family in Slavery and Freedom&quot;).

<text>In biochemistry, Michaelis–Menten kinetics, named after Leonor Michaelis and Maud Menten, is the simplest case of enzyme kinetics, applied to enzyme-catalysed reactions involving the transformation of one substrate into one product. It takes the form of a differential equation describing the reaction rate formula_1 (rate of formation of product P, with concentration formula_2) as a function of formula_3, the concentration of the substrate  A (using the symbols recommended by the IUBMB). Its formula is given by the Michaelis–Menten equation:

:formula_4 

formula_5, which is often written as formula_6, represents the limiting rate approached by the system at saturating substrate concentration for a given enzyme concentration. The Michaelis constant formula_7 has units of concentration, and for a given reaction is equal to the concentration of substrate at which the reaction rate is half of formula_5. Biochemical reactions involving a single substrate are often assumed to follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics, without regard to the model&#x27;s underlying assumptions. Only a small proportion of enzyme-catalysed reactions have just one substrate, but the equation still often applies if only one substrate concentration is varied.

==&quot;Michaelis–Menten plot&quot;==

The plot of formula_1 against formula_10 has often been called a &quot;Michaelis–Menten plot&quot;, even recently, but this is misleading, because Michaelis and Menten did not use such a plot. Instead, they plotted formula_1 against formula_12, which has some advantages over the usual ways of plotting Michaelis–Menten data. It has formula_1 as the dependent variable, and thus does not distort the experimental errors in formula_1. Michaelis and Menten did not attempt to estimate formula_5 directly from the limit approached at high formula_12, something difficult to do accurately with data obtained with modern techniques, and almost impossible with their data. Instead they took advantage of the fact that the curve is almost straight in the middle range and has a maximum slope of formula_17 i.e. formula_18. With an accurate value of formula_5 it was easy to determine formula_20 from the point on the curve corresponding to formula_21.

This plot is virtually never used today for estimating formula_5 and formula_7, but it remains of major interest because it has another valuable property: it allows the properties of isoenzymes catalysing the same reaction, but active in very different ranges of substrate concentration, to be compared on a single plot. For example, the four mammalian isoenzymes of hexokinase are half-saturated by glucose at concentrations ranging from about 0.02 mM for hexokinase A (brain hexokinase) to about 50 mM for hexokinase D (&quot;glucokinase&quot;, liver hexokinase), more than a 2000-fold range. It would be impossible to show a kinetic comparison between the four isoenzymes on one of the usual plots, but it is easily done on a semi-logarithmic plot.

==Model==
A decade before Michaelis and Menten, Victor Henri found that enzyme reactions could be explained by assuming a binding interaction between the enzyme and the substrate. His work was taken up by Michaelis and Menten, who investigated the kinetics of invertase, an enzyme that catalyzes the hydrolysis of sucrose into glucose and fructose. In 1913 they proposed a mathematical model of the reaction. It involves an enzyme E binding to a substrate A to form a complex EA that releases a product P regenerating the original form of the enzyme. This may be represented schematically as

:&lt;chem&gt;E{} + A &lt;=&gt;[\mathit{k_\mathrm{+1}}][\mathit{k_\mathrm{-1}}] EA -&gt;[k_\ce{cat}] E{} + P&lt;/chem&gt;

where formula_24 (forward rate constant), formula_25 (reverse rate constant), and formula_26 (catalytic rate constant) denote the rate constants, the double arrows between A (substrate) and EA (enzyme-substrate complex) represent the fact that enzyme-substrate binding is a reversible process, and the single forward arrow represents the formation of P (product).

Under certain assumptions – such as the enzyme concentration being much less than the substrate concentration – the rate of product formation is given by

:formula_27

in which formula_28 is the initial enzyme concentration. The reaction order depends on the relative size of the two terms in the denominator. At low substrate concentration formula_29, so that the rate formula_30 varies linearly with substrate concentration formula_10 (first-order kinetics in formula_10). However at higher formula_10, with formula_34, the reaction approaches independence of formula_10 (zero-order kinetics in formula_10), asymptotically approaching the limiting rate formula_37. This rate, which is never attained, refers to the hypothetical case in which all enzyme molecules are bound to substrate. formula_26, known as the turnover number or catalytic constant, normally expressed in s –1, is the limiting number of substrate molecules converted to product per enzyme molecule per unit of time. Further addition of substrate would not increase the rate, and the enzyme is said to be saturated.

The Michaelis constant formula_7 is not affected by the concentration or purity of an enzyme. Its value depends both on the identity of the enzyme and that of the substrate, as well as conditions such as temperature and pH.

The model is used in a variety of biochemical situations other than enzyme-substrate interaction, including antigen–antibody binding, DNA–DNA hybridization, and protein–protein interaction. It can be used to characterize a generic biochemical reaction, in the same way that the Langmuir equation can be used to model generic adsorption of biomolecular species. When an empirical equation of this form is applied to microbial growth, it is sometimes called a Monod equation.

Michaelis–Menten kinetics have also been applied to a variety of topics outside of biochemical reactions, including alveolar clearance of dusts, the richness of species pools, clearance of blood alcohol, the photosynthesis-irradiance relationship, and bacterial phage infection.

The equation can also be used to describe the relationship between ion channel conductivity and ligand concentration, and also, for example, to limiting nutrients and phytoplankton growth in the global ocean.

===Specificity===
The specificity constant formula_40 (also known as the &quot;catalytic efficiency&quot;) is a measure of how efficiently an enzyme converts a substrate into product. Although it is the ratio of formula_41 and formula_7 it is a parameter in its own right, more fundamental than formula_7. Diffusion limited enzymes, such as fumarase, work at the theoretical upper limit of , limited by diffusion of substrate into the active site.

If we symbolize the specificity constant for a particular substrate A as formula_44 the Michaelis–Menten equation can be written in terms of formula_45 and formula_7 as follows:

:formula_47

At small values of the substrate concentration this approximates to a first-order dependence of the rate on the substrate concentration:

:formula_48

Conversely it approaches a zero-order dependence on formula_10 when the substrate concentration is high:

:formula_50

The capacity of an enzyme to distinguish between two competing substrates that both follow Michaelis–Menten kinetics depends only on the specificity constant, and not on either formula_41 or formula_7 alone. Putting formula_45 for substrate formula_54 and formula_55 for a competing substrate formula_56, then the two rates when both are present simultaneously are as follows:

:formula_57

Although both denominators contain the Michaelis constants they are the same, and thus cancel when one equation is divided by the other:

:formula_58

and so the ratio of rates depends only on the concentrations of the two substrates and their specificity constants.

===Nomenclature===
As the equation originated with Henri, not with Michaelis and Menten, it is more accurate to call it the Henri–Michaelis–Menten equation, though it was Michaelis and Menten who realized that analysing reactions in terms of initial rates would be simpler, and as a result more productive, than analysing the time course of reaction, as Henri had attempted. Although Henri derived the equation he made no attempt to apply it. In addition, Michaelis and Menten understood the need for buffers to control the pH, but Henri did not.

==Applications==

Parameter values vary widely between enzymes. Some examples are as follows:

==Derivation==

===Equilibrium approximation===

In their analysis, Michaelis and Menten (and also Henri) assumed that the substrate is in instantaneous chemical equilibrium with the complex, which implies

:formula_59

in which &quot;e&quot; is the concentration of free enzyme (not the total concentration) and &quot;x&quot; is the concentration of enzyme-substrate complex EA.

Conservation of enzyme requires that

:formula_60

where formula_28 is now the total enzyme concentration. After combining the two expressions some straightforward algebra leads to the following expression for the concentration of the enzyme-substrate complex:
:formula_62

where formula_63 is the dissociation constant of the enzyme-substrate complex. Hence the rate equation is the Michaelis–Menten equation,

:formula_64
where formula_65 corresponds to the catalytic constant formula_26 and the limiting rate is formula_67. Likewise with the assumption of equilibrium the Michaelis constant formula_68.

===Irreversible first step===
When studying urease at about the same time as Michaelis and Menten were studying invertase, Donald Van Slyke and G. E. Cullen made essentially the opposite assumption, treating the first step not as an equilibrium but as an irreversible second-order reaction with rate constant formula_69. As their approach is never used today it is sufficient to give their final rate equation:
:formula_70
and to note that it is functionally indistinguishable from the Henri–Michaelis–Menten equation. One cannot tell from inspection of the kinetic behaviour whether formula_7 is equal to formula_72 or to formula_73 or to something else.

===Steady-state approximation===
G. E. Briggs and J. B. S. Haldane undertook an analysis that harmonized the approaches of Michaelis and Menten and of Van Slyke and Cullen, and is taken as the basic approach to enzyme kinetics today. They assumed that the concentration of the intermediate complex does not change on the time scale over which product formation is measured. This assumption means that formula_74. The resulting rate equation is as follows:

:formula_75

where
:formula_76

This is the generalized definition of the Michaelis constant.

===Assumptions and limitations===

All of the derivations given treat the initial binding step in terms of the law of mass action, which assumes free diffusion through the solution. However, in the environment of a living cell where there is a high concentration of proteins, the cytoplasm often behaves more like a viscous gel than a free-flowing liquid, limiting molecular movements by diffusion and altering reaction rates. Note, however that although this gel-like structure severely restricts large molecules like proteins its effect on small molecules, like many of the metabolites that participate in central metabolism, is very much smaller. In practice, therefore, treating the movement of substrates in terms of diffusion is not likely to produce major errors. Nonetheless, Schnell and Turner consider that is more appropriate to model the cytoplasm as a fractal, in order to capture its limited-mobility kinetics.

==Estimation of Michaelis–Menten parameters==

===Graphical methods===

Determining the parameters of the Michaelis–Menten equation typically involves running a series of enzyme assays at varying substrate concentrations formula_10, and measuring the initial reaction rates formula_1, i.e. the reaction rates are measured after a time period short enough for it to be assumed that the enzyme-substrate complex has formed, but that the substrate concentration remains almost constant, and so the equilibrium or quasi-steady-state approximation remain valid. By plotting reaction rate against concentration, and using nonlinear regression of the Michaelis–Menten equation with correct weighting based on known error distribution properties of the rates, the parameters may be obtained. 

Before computing facilities to perform nonlinear regression became available, graphical methods involving linearisation of the equation were used. A number of these were proposed, including the Eadie–Hofstee plot of formula_1 against formula_80, the Hanes plot of formula_81 against formula_10, and the Lineweaver–Burk plot (also known as the double-reciprocal plot) of formula_83 against formula_84. Of these, the Hanes plot is the most accurate when formula_1 is subject to errors with uniform standard deviation. From the point of view of visualizaing the data the Eadie–Hofstee plot has an important property: the entire possible range of formula_1 values from formula_87 to formula_5 occupies a finite range of ordinate scale, making it impossible to choose axes that conceal a poor experimental design. 

However, while useful for visualization, all three linear plots distort the error structure of the data and provide less precise estimates of formula_1 and formula_7 than correctly weighted non-linear regression. Assuming an error formula_91 on formula_1, an inverse representation leads to an error of formula_93 on formula_83 (Propagation of uncertainty), implying that linear regression of the double-reciprocal plot should include weights of formula_95. This was well understood by Lineweaver and Burk, who had consulted the eminent statistician W. Edwards Deming before analysing their data. Unlike nearly all workers since, Burk made an experimental study of the error distribution, finding it consistent with a uniform standard error in formula_1, before deciding on the appropriate weights. This aspect of the work of Lineweaver and Burk received virtually no attention at the time, and was subsequently forgotten.

The direct linear plot is a graphical method in which the observations are represented by straight lines in parameter space, with axes formula_7 and formula_5: each line is drawn with an intercept of formula_99 on the formula_7 axis and formula_1 on the formula_5 axis. The point of intersection of the lines for different observations yields the values of formula_7 and formula_5.

===Weighting===

Many authors, for example Greco and Hakala, have claimed that non-linear regression is always superior to regression of the linear forms of the Michaelis–Menten equation. However, that is correct only if the appropriate weighting scheme is used, preferably on the basis of experimental investigation, something that is almost never done. As noted above, Burk carried out the appropriate investigation, and found that the error structure of his data was consistent with a uniform standard deviation in formula_1. More recent studies found that a uniform coefficient of variation (standard deviation expressed as a percentage) was closer to the truth with the techniques in use in the 1970s. However, this truth may be more complicated than any dependence on formula_1 alone can represent.

Uniform standard deviation of formula_83. If the rates are considered to have a uniform standard deviation the appropriate weight for every formula_1 value for non-linear regression is 1. If the double-reciprocal plot is used each value of formula_83 should have a weight of formula_95, whereas if the Hanes plot is used each value of formula_81 should have a weight of formula_112.

Uniform coefficient variation of formula_83. If the rates are considered to have a uniform coefficient variation the appropriate weight for every formula_1 value for non-linear regression is formula_115. If the double-reciprocal plot is used each value of formula_83 should have a weight of formula_115, whereas if the Hanes plot is used each value of formula_81 should have a weight of formula_119.

Ideally the formula_1 in each of these cases should be the true value, but that is always unknown. However, after a preliminary estimation one can use the calculated values formula_121 for refining the estimation. In practice the error structure of enzyme kinetic data is very rarely investigated experimentally, therefore almost never known, but simply assumed. It is, however, possible to form an impression of the error structure from internal evidence in the data. This is tedious to do by hand, but can readily be done in the computer.

===Closed form equation===

Santiago Schnell and Claudio Mendoza suggested a closed form solution for the time course kinetics analysis of the Michaelis–Menten kinetics based on the solution of the Lambert W function.
Namely,

:formula_122

where &quot;W&quot; is the Lambert W function and

:formula_123

The above equation, known nowadays as the Schnell-Mendoza equation, has been used to estimate formula_5 and formula_7 from time course data.

== Reactions with more than one substrate ==
Only a small minority of enzyme-catalysed reactions have just one substrate, and even if the number is increased by treating two-substrate reactions in which one substrate is water as one-substrate reactions the number is still small. One might accordingly suppose that the Michaelis–Menten equation, normally written with just one substrate, is of limited usefulness. This supposition is misleading, however. One of the common equations for a two-substrate reaction can be written as follows to express formula_1 in terms of two substrate concentrations formula_10 and formula_128:

: formula_129

the other symbols represent kinetic constants. Suppose now that formula_10 is varied with formula_128 held constant. Then it is convenient to reorganize the equation as follows:

: formula_132

This has exactly the form of the Michaelis–Menten equation 

:formula_133

with apparent values formula_134 and formula_135 defined as follows:

: formula_136

: formula_137

== Linear inhibition ==
The linear (simple) types of inhibition can be classified in terms of the general equation for mixed inhibition at an inhibitor concentration formula_138:

: formula_139

in which formula_140 is the competitive inhibition constant and formula_141 is the uncompetitive inhibition constant. This equation includes the other types of inhibition as special cases:

* If formula_142 the second parenthesis in the denominator approaches formula_143 and the resulting behaviour is competitive inhibition.
* If formula_144 the first parenthesis in the denominator approaches formula_143 and the resulting behaviour is uncompetitive inhibition.
* If both formula_140 and formula_141 are finite the behaviour is mixed inhibition.
* If formula_148 the resulting special case is pure non-competitive inhibition.

Pure non-competitive inhibition is very rare, being mainly confined to effects of protons and some metal ions. Cleland recognized this, and he redefined &quot;noncompetitive&quot; to mean &quot;mixed&quot;. Some authors have followed him in this respect, but not all, so when reading any publication one needs to check what definition the authors are using.

In all cases the kinetic equations have the form of the Michaelis–Menten equation with apparent constants, as can be seen by writing the equation above as follows:

: formula_149

with apparent values formula_134 and formula_135 defined as follows:

: formula_152

: formula_153

<text>Jingdezhen is a prefecture-level city in eastern Jiangxi province with a total population of 1,669,057 (2018), bordering Anhui to the north. It is known as the &quot;Porcelain Capital&quot; because it has been producing Chinese ceramics for at least 1,000 years, and for much of that period Jingdezhen porcelain was the most important and finest quality in China. The city has a well-documented history that stretches back over 2,000 years.

== History ==
Throughout both the Spring and Autumn period and the Warring States period, the area of present-day Jingdezhen belonged to the Chu State. After the fall of the Chu, the area was incorporated into the Qin dynasty as part of Fan County () in . Under the Han dynasty, the area belonged to Poyang County () in . Under the Han dynasty, the particular area of future Jingdezhen was known as Xinping (). Historical records show that it was during this time that it began to make porcelain.

The town was established during the Jin dynasty under the name Changnan (), due to its location on the south bank of the Chang river. The town&#x27;s name would be changed twice, first in 742 CE to Fuliang (), and then in 1004 to Jingdezhen, its current name, after the era name of the Emperor Zhenzong of Song during whose reign its porcelain production first rose to fame. The town was placed under the jurisdiction of Fuliang County.

In the Ming and Qing dynasties, Jingdezhen was considered one of China&#x27;s four great towns in terms of commercial and industrial importance. The others were Foshan in Guangdong, Hankou in Hubei, and Zhuxian in Henan.

In 1855 during the Taiping Rebellion, Taiping forces destroyed all 9,000 kilns in Jingdezhen. They would be rebuilt after the war in 1866.

In the 19th century, Jingdezhen became a county.

On April 29, 1949, Communist forces took the city.

On May 4, 1949, it was upgraded to a prefecture city. However, to honor its history, Jingdezhen retained it the word &quot;zhen&quot; meaning &quot;town&quot; in its name. Usually when a town is upgraded to a city, the designation of &quot;shi&quot; meaning &quot;city&quot; replaces that of &quot;zhen&quot;.

In June 1953 Jindezhen was upgraded into a provincial level city.

In 1960, Fuliang County was merged into the city.

Jingdezhen was named one of top 24 national historical and cultural cities of the People&#x27;s Republic of China on February 28, 1982.

In July 1983, Leping County was also merged into the city. In October 1988, Fuliang County was re-established, and in September 1992, Leping County was re-established as a county-level city.

In 2004, Jingdezhen celebrated the millennium of its becoming the porcelain capital and it is assuming its present name.

Due to the relatively low cost of living and the heritage of the porcelain industry, Jingdezhen has become a haven for young artists from all over China, who are often referred to known as Jingpiao (景漂).

== Geography ==

Jingdezhen is situated in the north-east of Jiangxi and borders on Anhui; the city center area is located in the north-east of the Poyang Lake Plain. Its area is . The highest point is , with plains on the southern part having an average altitude of .

There are some cities and counties between Jiangxi and Anhui Province around Jingdezhen. To its north, northwest and northeast are Dongzhi, Xiuning, and Qimen County of Anhui province. To its south are Wannian County and Yiyang County. To its west is Boyang County. Lastly, to its southeast are Wuyuan County and Dexing City.

The prefecture&#x27;s natural resources include kaolin, coal, manganese, and lime. Although various forms of kaolin has since been found around the world, it was the Jingdezhen kilns who first perfected its use in combination with petuntse to create world-class hard-paste porcelain. The name &quot;kaolin&quot; itself derives from the French Jesuit d&#x27;Entrecolles&#x27;s transcription of the local term (), taken from Gaoling (, ), a village in Ehu Town in Fuliang County that provided most of the city&#x27;s kaolin during the early and mid-Qing dynasty.

==Climate==
Jingdezhen has a humid subtropical climate (Köppen &quot;Cfa&quot;) affected by the East Asian monsoon, with long, humid, very hot summers and cool and drier winters with occasional cold snaps. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July, with an annual average of . The average annual precipitation is .

== Administrative divisions ==
The city of Jingdezhen is divided into 4 county-level divisions: Zhushan District, Changjiang District, Fuliang County, and the county-level city of Leping. These 4 county-level divisions administer 52 township-level divisions, and 687 village-level divisions.

==Porcelain==
Jingdezhen may have produced pottery as early as the sixth century CE, though it is named after the reign name of Emperor Zhenzong, in whose reign it became a major kiln site, around 1004. By the 14th century it had become the largest centre of production of Chinese porcelain, which it has remained, increasing its dominance in subsequent centuries. For several centuries, almost all top quality Chinese porcelain has come from the town. From the Ming period onwards, official kilns in Jingdezhen were controlled by the emperor, making &quot;imperial porcelain&quot; in large quantity for the court and the emperor to give as gifts.

Although apparently an unpromising location for potteries, being a remote town in a hilly region, Jingdezhen is close to the best quality deposits of petuntse, more contemporarily called pottery stone, in China, as well as being surrounded by forests, mostly of pine, providing wood for the kilns. It also has a river leading to river systems flowing north and south, facilitating transport of fragile wares. The imperial kilns were in the centre of the city at Zhushan (Pearl Hill), with many other kilns four kilometres away at Hutian.

It has produced a great variety of pottery and porcelain, for the Chinese market and as Chinese export porcelain, but its best-known high quality porcelain wares have been successively Qingbai ware in the Song and Yuan dynasties, blue and white porcelain from the 1330s, and the &quot;famille rose&quot; and other &quot;famille&quot; colours under the Qing dynasty. The town continues to produce cheaper tablewares in great quantity, as well as more expensive decorative pieces. During the Cultural Revolution, Jingdezhen produced a large number of porcelain Mao badges and statues of a seated Mao Zedong.

Jingdezhen porcelain has fetched record prices at auctions, with a blue and white porcelain jar produced during the Yuan dynasty auctioning for $27.7 million in London in 2005, and a porcelain cup produced during the Ming dynasty auctioning for $36.3 million in 2014.

<doc id="253279" wikidata="Q3851731" url="?curid=253279" title="Automated Mathematician">
<text>The Automated Mathematician (AM) is one of the earliest successful discovery systems. It was created by Douglas Lenat in Lisp, and in 1977 led to Lenat being awarded the IJCAI Computers and Thought Award.

AM worked by generating and modifying short Lisp programs which were then interpreted as defining various mathematical concepts; for example, a program that tested equality between the length of two lists was considered to represent the concept of numerical equality, while a program that produced a list whose length was the product of the lengths of two other lists was interpreted as representing the concept of multiplication. The system had elaborate heuristics for choosing which programs to extend and modify, based on the experiences of working mathematicians in solving mathematical problems.

== Controversy ==

Lenat claimed that the system was composed of hundreds of data structures called &quot;concepts&quot;, together with hundreds of &quot;heuristic rules&quot; and a simple flow of control: &quot;AM repeatedly selects the top task from the agenda and tries to carry it out. This is the whole control structure!&quot; Yet the heuristic rules were not always represented as separate data structures; some had to be intertwined with the control flow logic. Some rules had preconditions that depended on the history, or otherwise could not be represented in the framework of the explicit rules.

What&#x27;s more, the published versions of the rules often involve vague terms that are not defined further, such as &quot;If two expressions are structurally similar, ...&quot; (Rule 218) or &quot;... replace the value obtained by some other (very similar) value...&quot; (Rule 129).

Another source of information is the user, via Rule 2: &quot;If the user has recently referred to X, then boost the priority of any tasks involving X.&quot; Thus, it appears quite possible that much of the real discovery work is buried in unexplained procedures.

Lenat claimed that the system had rediscovered both Goldbach&#x27;s conjecture and the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Later critics accused Lenat of over-interpreting the output of AM. In his paper &quot;Why AM and Eurisko appear to work&quot;, Lenat conceded that any system that generated enough short Lisp programs would generate ones that could be interpreted by an external observer as representing equally sophisticated mathematical concepts. However, he argued that this property was in itself interesting—and that a promising direction for further research would be to look for other languages in which short random strings were likely to be useful.

== Successor ==

This intuition was the basis of AM&#x27;s successor Eurisko, which attempted to generalize the search for mathematical concepts to the search for useful heuristics.

<text>The Nördlinger Ries is an impact crater and large circular depression in western Bavaria and eastern Baden-Württemberg. It is located north of the Danube in the district of Donau-Ries. The city of Nördlingen is located within the depression, about south-west of its centre.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Ries&quot; is derived from Raetia, since the tribe of Raetians lived in the area in pre-Roman times.

== Description ==
The depression is a meteorite impact crater formed 14.808 ± 0.038 million years ago in the Miocene. The crater is most commonly referred to simply as &quot;Ries crater&quot; or &quot;the Ries&quot;. The original crater rim had an estimated diameter of . The present floor of the depression is about below the eroded remains of the rim.

It was originally assumed that the Ries was of volcanic origin. In 1960 Eugene Shoemaker and Edward C. T. Chao showed that the depression was caused by meteorite impact. The key evidence was the presence of coesite, which, in unmetamorphosed rocks, can only be formed by the shock pressures associated with meteorite impact. The coesite was found in suevite from Otting quarry, but even before, Shoemaker was encouraged by St. George&#x27;s Church in Nördlingen, which is built of locally derived suevite. The suevite was formed from mesozoic sediments shocked by the bolide impact.

The Ries impact crater was a rampart crater, thus far a unique finding on Earth. Rampart craters have almost exclusively been found on Mars. Rampart craters exhibit a fluidized ejecta flow after impact of the meteorite, most simply compared to a bullet fired into mud, with the ejecta resembling a mudflow.

Another impact crater, the much smaller ( diameter) Steinheim crater, is located about west-southwest from the center of Ries. It had previously been thought that the two craters formed simultaneously by the impact of a binary asteroid 14.8 million years ago, but a study published in 2020 suggests that Steinheim could actually be about 500,000 years younger than Nördlinger Ries.

Recent computer modeling of the impact event indicates that the impactors probably had diameters of about (Ries) and (Steinheim), had a pre-impact separation of some tens of kilometers, and impacted the target area at an angle around 30 to 50 degrees from the surface in a west-southwest to east-northeast direction. The impact velocity is thought to have been about . The resulting explosion had the power of 40 million Hiroshima bombs, an energy of roughly 2.4 joules.

The Ries crater impact event is believed to be the source of moldavite tektites found in southern Bohemia and Moravia (Czech Republic). The tektite melt originated from a sand-rich surface layer that was ejected to distances up to downrange of the crater. The shape of the strewnfield suggests that the direction of impact was from the west-southwest.

Stone buildings in Nördlingen contain millions of tiny diamonds, all less than across. The impact that caused the Nördlinger Ries crater created an estimated of them when it impacted a local graphite deposit. Stone from this area was quarried and used to build the local buildings.

== History ==
On one edge of the Nördlinger Ries are the Ofnet Caves, where, at the beginning of the 20th century, archaeologists discovered thirty-three human skulls dating to the Mesolithic period.

The Ries was the site of the Battle of the Ries on 13 May 841.

The landing site for Apollo 14 is a heavily craterized terrain, and one of the science goals of the mission was to sample ejecta from the impact that formed Mare Imbrium. Nördlinger Ries is an easily accessible, large impact crater, making it a convenient analog for lunar craters. Because of this, it was used as a location to train Apollo 14 astronauts, so that they would be able to investigate lunar impact structures and related rocks. Astronauts Alan Shepard and Edgar Mitchell, as well as Apollo 14 backup astronauts Eugene Cernan and Joe Engle, trained here from August 10 to August 14, 1970.

<doc id="253283" wikidata="Q634266" url="?curid=253283" title="Linguistic imperialism">
<text>Linguistic imperialism or language imperialism is occasionally defined as &quot;the transfer of a dominant language to other people&quot;. This language &quot;transfer&quot; (or rather unilateral imposition) comes about because of imperialism. The transfer is considered to be a sign of power; traditionally military power but also, in the modern world, economic power. Aspects of the dominant culture are usually transferred along with the language. In spatial terms, a few of Europe&#x27;s hundreds of indigenous languages are employed in the function of official (state) languages in Eurasia, while only non-indigenous imperial (European) languages in the &quot;Rest of the World&quot;. In the modern world, linguistic imperialism may also be considered in the context of international development, affecting the standard by which organizations like the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank evaluate the trustworthiness and value of structural adjustment loans by virtue of views that are commonly foregrounded in English-language discourse and not neutral (linguistic relativism).

Since the early 1990s, linguistic imperialism has attracted attention among scholars of applied linguistics. In particular, Robert Phillipson&#x27;s 1992 book, &quot;Linguistic Imperialism&quot;, has led to considerable debate about its merits and shortcomings. Phillipson found denunciations of linguistic imperialism that dated back to Nazi critiques of the British Council (European aristocracy was, at the time, agreeing on the use of English), and to Soviet analyses of English as the language of world capitalism and world domination. In this vein, criticism of English as a world language is often rooted in anti-globalism.

== Definition ==
Linguistic imperialism is a form of linguicism which benefits and grants power to the dominating/oppressing language and its speakers. As summarized by linguists Heath Rose and John Conama, Dr. Phillipson argues that the defining characteristics of linguistic imperialism are:
# As a form of linguicism, which manifests in favoring the dominant language over another along similar lines as racism and sexism.
# As a structurally manifested idea, where more resources and infrastructure are given to the dominant language
# As being ideological, in that it encourages beliefs that the dominant language form is more prestigious than others. These ideas are hegemonic and internalized and naturalized as being &quot;normal&quot;.
# As intertwined with the same structure as imperialism in culture, education, media, and politics.
# As having an exploitative essence, which causes injustice and inequality between those who use the dominant language and those who do not.
# As having a subtractive influence on other languages, in that learning the dominant language is at the expense of others.
# As being contested and resisted, because of these factors.

Although it is not easy to determine the intentions of specific policies which have led to linguicism, some scholars believe that intent can be proven by observing whether imperialist practices are continued once their sociolinguistic, sociological, psychological, political, and educational harm of other languages are made aware.

== History ==

The impacts of colonization on linguistic traditions vary based on the form of colonization experienced: trader, settler or exploitation. Congolese-American linguist Salikoko Mufwene describes trader colonization as one of the earliest forms of European colonization. In regions such as the western coast of Africa as well as the Americas, trade relations between European colonizers and indigenous peoples led to the development of pidgin languages. Some of these languages, such as Delaware Pidgin and Mobilian Jargon, were based on Native American languages, while others, such as Nigerian Pidgin and Cameroonian Pidgin, were based on European ones. As trader colonization proceeded mainly via these hybrid languages, rather than the languages of the colonizers, scholars like Mufwene contend that it posed little threat to indigenous languages.

Trader colonization was often followed by settler colonization, where European colonizers settled in these colonies to build new homes. Hamel, a Mexican linguist, argues that &quot;segregation&quot; and &quot;integration&quot; were two primary ways through which settler colonists engaged with aboriginal cultures. In countries such as Uruguay, Brazil, Argentina, and those in the Caribbean, segregation and genocide decimated indigenous societies. Widespread death due to war and illness caused many indigenous populations to lose their indigenous languages. In contrast, in countries that pursued policies of &quot;integration&quot;, such as Mexico, Guatemala and the Andean states, indigenous cultures were lost as aboriginal tribes mixed with colonists. In these countries, the establishment of new European orders led to the adoption of colonial languages in governance and industry. In addition, European colonists also viewed the dissolution of indigenous societies and traditions as necessary for the development of a unified nation state. This led to efforts to destroy tribal languages and cultures: in Canada and the United States, for example, Native children were sent to boarding schools such as Col. Richard Pratt&#x27;s Carlisle Indian Industrial School. Today, in countries such as the United States, Canada and Australia, which were once settler colonies, indigenous languages are spoken by only a small minority of the populace.

Mufwene also draws a distinction between settler colonies and exploitation colonies. In the latter, the process of colonization was focused on the extraction of raw materials needed in Europe. As a result, Europeans were less invested in their exploitation colonies, and few colonists planned to build homes in these colonies. As a result, indigenous languages were able to survive to a greater extent in these colonies compared to settler colonies. In exploitation colonies, colonial languages were often only taught to a small local elite. During the period of British rule in India, for example, Lord Macaulay highlighted the need for &quot;...a class who may be interpreters between us and the millions who govern... a class of persons, Indian in blood and color, but English in taste, in my opinion, in morals and in intellect&quot; in his now-famous &quot;Macaulay minutes&quot;, which were written in support of the English Education Act of 1835. The linguistic differences between the local elite and other locals exacerbated class stratification, and also increased inequality in access to education, industry and civic society in postcolonial states.

== English ==
In &quot;Linguistic Imperialism&quot;, Robert Henry Phillipson defines English linguistic imperialism as &quot;the dominance of English... asserted and maintained by the establishment and continuous reconstitution of structural and cultural inequalities between English and other languages.&quot; English is often called a worldwide &quot;lingua franca&quot;, but Phillipson argues that when its dominance leads to a linguicide, it can be more aptly titled a &quot;lingua frankensteinia&quot; by his view.

Phillipson&#x27;s theory supports the historic spread of English as an international language and that language&#x27;s continued dominance, particularly in postcolonial settings such as Wales, Scotland, Ireland, India, Pakistan, Uganda, Zimbabwe, etc., but also increasingly in &quot;neo-colonial&quot; settings such as continental Europe. His theory draws mainly on Johan Galtung&#x27;s imperialism theory, Antonio Gramsci&#x27;s theory, and in particular on his notion of cultural hegemony.

A central theme of Phillipson&#x27;s theory is the complex hegemonic processes which, he asserts, continue to sustain the pre-eminence of English in the world today. His book analyzes the British Council&#x27;s use of rhetoric to promote English, and discusses key tenets of English applied linguistics and English-language-teaching methodology. These tenets hold that:
* English is best taught monolingually (&quot;the monolingual fallacy&quot;);
* the ideal teacher is a native speaker (&quot;the native-speaker fallacy&quot;);
* the earlier English is taught, the better the results (&quot;the early-start fallacy&quot;);
* the more English is taught, the better the results (&quot;the maximum-exposure fallacy&quot;);
* if other languages are used much, standards of English will drop (&quot;the subtractive fallacy&quot;).

According to Phillipson, those who promote English—organizations such as the British Council, the IMF and the World Bank, and individuals such as operators of English-language schools—use three types of argument:
* &quot;Intrinsic&quot; arguments describe the English language as &quot;providential&quot;, &quot;rich&quot;, &quot;noble&quot; and &quot;interesting&quot;. Such arguments tend to assert what English &quot;is&quot; and what other languages &quot;are not&quot;.
* &quot;Extrinsic&quot; arguments point out that English is well-established: that it has many speakers, and that there are trained teachers and a wealth of teaching material.
* &quot;Functional&quot; arguments emphasize the usefulness of English as a gateway to the world.

Other arguments for English are:
* its economic utility: it enables people to get access to some technologies
* its ideological function: it is said as standing for modernity;
* its status might be seen as symbol for material advance and efficiency.

Another theme in Phillipson&#x27;s work is &quot;linguicism&quot;—the kind of prejudice which can lead to endangered languages becoming extinct or losing their local eminence due to the rise and competing prominence of English.

== Other languages ==

At various times, especially in colonial settings or where a dominant culture has sought to unify a region under its control, a similar phenomenon has arisen. In the Roman Empire, Latin—originally the language of a limited region in central Italy—was imposed first on the rest of Italy and later on parts of Europe, largely displacing local languages, while in Roman Africa Latin was dominant only until it and the native languages were displaced by Arabization.

Anatolia had similar linguistic diversity when it was ruled by small native states. Under the Persian and Hellenistic empires, the tongue of the conqueror served as the &quot;lingua franca&quot;. The indigenous Anatolian languages disappeared.

In the Far East, Africa and the Americas, regional languages have been or are being coercively replaced or slighted—Tibetan and regional Chinese varieties by Mandarin Chinese, Ainu and Ryukyuan by Japanese, Quechua and Mesoamerican languages by Spanish, Malayo-Polynesian languages by Malay (incl. Indonesian), Philippine languages by Filipino and so on. Arabization has eliminated many indigenous Berber languages in North Africa and restricted Coptic to use as a liturgical language by Coptic Christian Orthodox and Coptic Catholic Churches.

The English language during the Middle Ages was an object of linguistic imperialism by the French language, particularly following the Norman conquest. For hundreds of years, French or Anglo-Norman was the language of administration (&quot;See Law French&quot;) and therefore a language of higher status in England. Latin remained the tongue of church and learning. Although many words introduced by the Normans are today indistinguishable by most English-speakers from native Germanic words, later-learned loanwords, copied from Latin or French may &quot;sound more cultured&quot; to a native English-speaker.

Following the establishment of the Holy Roman Empire over much of present-day Germany and Central Europe, the German language and its dialects became the preferred language of many Central-European nobility. With varying success, German spread across much of Central and Eastern Europe as a language of trade and status. This ended with World War II (&quot;See also Germanization.&quot;).

French has also expanded. Languages such as Occitan, Breton, Basque, Catalan and Corsican have been slighted in France. This process, known as Francization, often causes resistance amongst minority peoples, leading to demands for independence. Examples of this can still be found in Breton nationalism and in the Flanders&#x27; Flemish Movement in Belgium).

In Italy there is a situation similar to the French one, with Italian that has expanded at the expense of languages such as Sardinian, Sicilian, Ladin, Venetian and Friulan, while languages such as German (in South Tyrol) or French (in Aosta Valley), historically persecuted, are now co-official in those regions (&quot;See also Italianization&quot;).
Portuguese and Spanish colonization made these languages prevalent in South America and in parts of Africa and Asia (the Philippines, Macau, and for a short time Formosa). In Spain, Spanish spread and was imposed over other languages, becoming the only official language of the state from the 18th to the 20th century. It was labelled &quot;the companion of the Empire&quot; by Antonio de Nebrija (1492) in the introduction to his &quot;Gramática de la lengua castellana&quot;.

Russian linguistic imperialism can be seen in Belarus both in the former dispute over the name of the country (Belarus vs Belorussia) and in the common spelling of the name of their president. The English transcription of his name is the Russian form, Alexander Lukashenko, instead of the Belarusian form, Alyaksandr Lukashenka.

In post-independence India, there were attempts to make Hindi as the sole official language which was vehemently opposed by various provinces, particularly by the state of Tamil Nadu (see also Hindi imposition). In Karnataka, linguistic imperialism manifests as pushes to impose Kannada almost everywhere.

== Criticism ==
Many scholars have participated in lively discussions of Phillipson&#x27;s claims. Alan Davies, for instance, envisions the ghost of Phillipson haunting the Department of Applied Linguistics in Edinburgh:
For Davies, two cultures inhabit linguistic imperialism: one, a culture of guilt (&quot;colonies should never have happened&quot;); the other, that of romantic despair (&quot;we shouldn&#x27;t be doing what we are doing&quot;). Rajagopalan goes a step farther and maintains that Phillipson&#x27;s book has led to a guilt complex among English language learning and teaching (ELT) professionals.

Davies also argues that Phillipson&#x27;s claims are not falsifiable: what &quot;if the dominated... wanted to adopt English and continue to want to keep it? Phillipson&#x27;s unfalsifiable answer must be that they don&#x27;t, they can&#x27;t, they&#x27;ve been persuaded against their better interests.&quot; It has thus been argued that Phillipson&#x27;s theory is patronizing in its implication that developing countries lack independent decision-making capacity (to adopt or not to adopt ELT). In the context of Nigeria, Bisong holds that people in the &quot;periphery&quot; use English pragmatically—they send their children to English-language schools precisely because they want them to grow up multilingual. Regarding Phillipson, Bisong maintains that &quot;to interpret such actions as emanating from people who are victims of Centre linguistic imperialism is to bend sociolinguistic evidence to suit a preconceived thesis&quot;. If English should be abolished because it is foreign, Bisong argues, then Nigeria itself would also have to be dissolved, because it was conceived as a colonial structure.

Furthermore, the assumption that the English language itself is imperialistic has come under attack. Henry Widdowson has argued that &quot;there is a fundamental contradiction in the idea that the language of itself exerts hegemonic control: namely that if this were the case, you would never be able to challenge such control&quot;. Additionally, the idea that the promotion of English necessarily implies a demotion of local languages has been challenged. Holborrow points out that &quot;not all Englishes in the centre dominate, nor are all speakers in the periphery equally discriminated against&quot;. Hiberno-English or New Zealand English or even England&#x27;s regional dialects such as Cornish English, for instance, could be regarded as a non-dominant centre variety of English.

Some scholars believe that English&#x27;s dominance is not due to specific language policies, but rather as a side-effect of the spread of English-speaking colonists through colonization and globalization.

Thus it could be argued that, while those who follow Phillipson see choices about language as externally imposed, the other camp sees them as personal choices.

== Response ==
Those who support the arguments favoring the existence of linguistic imperialism claim that arguments against it are often advanced by monolingual native-speakers of English who may see the current status of English as a fact worthy of celebration.

Those who see the increasing spread of English in the world as a worrying development (which lowers the status of local and regional languages as well as potentially undermining or eroding cultural values) are likely to be more receptive to Phillipson&#x27;s views. Alastair Pennycook, Suresh Canagarajah, Adrian Holliday and Julian Edge fall into this group and are described as critical applied linguists.

However, Henry Widdowson’s remarks on critical discourse analysis may also be applied to the critical applied linguists:
In Ireland, the issue of de-anglicising the influence of English has been a topic of debate in the country even before independence. An argument for de-anglicisation was delivered before the Irish National Literary Society in Dublin, 25 November 1892; &quot;When we speak of &#x27;The Necessity for De-Anglicising the Irish Nation&#x27;, we mean it, not as a protest against imitating what is best in the English people, for that would be absurd, but rather to show the folly of neglecting what is Irish, and hastening to adopt, pell-mell, and indiscriminately, everything that is English, simply because it is English.&quot;

According to Ghil&#x27;ad Zuckermann, &quot;Native tongue title and language rights should be promoted. The government ought to define Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander vernaculars as official languages of Australia. We must change the linguistic landscape of Whyalla and elsewhere. Signs should be in both English and the local indigenous language. We ought to acknowledge intellectual property of indigenous knowledge including language, music and dance.&quot;

== Appropriation ==
Some who reject the idea of linguistic imperialism argue that the global spread of English is better understood in the framework of appropriation—that English is used around the world &quot;for local purposes&quot;. In addition to the example of Nigeria, other examples have been given:
* Demonstrators in non-English-speaking countries often use signs in English to convey their demands to TV audiences around the world. In some cases, demonstrators may not understand what their signs say.
* Bobda shows how Cameroon has moved away from a mono-cultural, Anglo-centered way of teaching English and has gradually accommodated teaching materials to a Cameroonian context. Non-Western topics are treated, such as rule by emirs, traditional medicine, and polygamy. Bobda argues for bi-cultural, Cameroonian and Anglo-American education.
* Kramsch and Sullivan describe how Western methodology and textbooks have been appropriated to suit local Vietnamese culture.
* The Pakistani textbook &quot;Primary Stage English&quot; includes lessons such as &quot;Pakistan, My Country&quot;, &quot;Our Flag,&quot; and &quot;Our Great Leader&quot;, which might sound jingoistic to western ears. Within the native culture, however, establishing a connection between ELT, patriotism and the Muslim faith is seen as an aim of ELT, as the chairman of the Punjab Textbook Board openly states: &quot;The board... takes care, through these books to inoculate in the students a love of the Islamic values and awareness to guard the ideological frontiers of your [the student&#x27;s] home lands.&quot;

Such an &quot;internationalization&quot; of English may also offer new possibilities to English native-speakers. McCabe elaborates:

<doc id="253284" wikidata="Q5282021" url="?curid=253284" title="Discovery system (bibliographic search)">
<text>A discovery system is a bibliographic search system based on search engine technology. It is part of the concept of Library 2.0 and is intended to supplement or even replace the existing OPAC catalogs. These systems emerged in the late 2000s in response to user desire for a more convenient search option similar to that of internet search engine. The results from searching a discovery system may include books and other print materials from the library&#x27;s catalog, electronic resources such as e-journals or videos, and items stored in other libraries.

==Terminology==
The term discovery layer has been described as an overarching term that can include:
* , a graphical user interface that library users search or browse with. It includes search-engine like amenities such as spelling correction, tolerance for punctuation differences, and typeahead search. This idea is also called a next-generation catalog.
* , an interconnected search system, allowing library users to search not only the catalog of library print materials, but various digital resources and perhaps resources located in other libraries. The discovery system queries more than one data source upon a single user request; this is sometimes called federated search.

The term indicates that the software is modular and can be used to emphasize the separability of catalog search and browse functionality from an integrated library system (ILS). The distinction between discovery , , and is not rigorous and the terms are sometimes used as synonyms. These &quot;inconsistencies were in part due to the field&#x27;s newness&quot; when the terms were being created.

==History==

===OPACs===
Users searching for print materials (such as books) at a library once used card catalogs, and later computerized catalogs called OPACs. Searching for resources other than material in the catalog, such as electronic resources, was (or is) done with separate tools. Using card or computerized catalogs well required skills and jargon particular to libraries.

As computerization advanced, OPACs were integrated with other library systems, like acquisition and circulation systems. The resulting monolithic software systems were named integrated library systems.

===Changing expectations===
As the web became more widespread, library users developed &quot;the expectation of being able to discover the collection in a search engine style&quot;. Gradually, discovery interfaces were created to be more forgiving of misspellings and punctuation choices than historical OPACs, and to offer features like suggestion of related search terms and faceted search.

Reference librarians in the mid-2000s also spent &quot;a lot of time talking about information silos&quot;. They were concerned that library users had to hunt for various types of resources with various tools, an obstacle to users, resulting in underused resources. Librarians sought multidatabase search products that would collapse the silos.

===Emergence of the discovery layer===
These two features, search-engine-like interfaces and multidatabase search, began to appear in the same software systems. One author dates the uniting of these features to 2009; this would be the invention of the discovery system. Particularly if decoupled from an ILS, this united product can also be called a discovery layer. &quot;The discovery layer still uses the information and indexing in the integrated library system (ILS), but it also searches across proprietary databases and other electronic resources, all with the goal of revealing everything that a library owns or has licensed on a given topic be it a print monograph, an electronic journal article, streaming video, or a collection of archival documents&quot;

The discovery layer can be looked on as the replacement for the OPAC. Some libraries maintain both a catalog interface OPAC and a discovery layer interface.

== Typical features of a discovery system ==
* Large search space: A search can search the data from different data sources (the discovery system has a comprehensive central subject index). For example, you can search a journal article or a textbook directly in the discovery system and you do not have to change from a subject database to the library catalog.
* Intuitive usability, like a search engine. The search is basically only a simple form, an advanced search function is not always provided.
* Ranking of the results according to relevance: The &quot;best&quot; hit is displayed first, not necessarily the newest one. A good ranking is important because many hits are often found due to the large search space.
* Search refinement with drill-down menus (facets): For example, a search can be restricted to all matches available online.
* Correction of input errors via a &quot;Did you mean ...?&quot; function.
* Autocomplete: After input to the search field, a drop-down list of suggestions appears.
* Exploratory search: One finds results of interest that were not specifically requested. For example, links to similar hits, entries in subject databases, or Wikipedia articles are displayed (integration of other web technologies).

== Examples of discovery system products ==
Some discovery layer or discovery service products are modules of a particular ILS or database product, and are sold by that product&#x27;s vendor: an example is EBSCO Discovery Service. Other discovery tools are free-standing software products: Blacklight and VuFind are open-source examples.

Commercial products:
* Summon (Serial Solutions)
* Primo Central (ExLibris)
* EBSCO Discovery Service
* WorldCat Discovery (OCLC)
Open-source products:
* Blacklight
* VuFind (Villanova University Library)
* Lukida (GBV Common Library Network)
* Aspen Discovery (ByWater Solutions)

<text>The Eurovision Young Dancers 1985 was the first edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers, held at Teatro Municipale in Reggio Emilia, Italy, on 16 June 1985. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Radiotelevisione Italiana (RAI), dancers from twelve countries participated in the televised final.

Arantxa Argüelles of Spain won the contest, with Norway and Sweden placing second and third respectively.

==Location==
Teatro Municipale (also since the 1980s called the &quot;Teatro Municipale Valli&quot; due to being named after the actor Romolo Valli), a theatre in Reggio Emilia, Northern Italy was the host venue for the 1985 edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers.

Following the destruction by fire of the 1741 Teatro Cittadella in April 1851, the new theatre was designed by the architect Cesare Costa and constructed in the neoclassic style between 1852 and 1857. Its inauguration took place on 21 April 1857 with the performance of the &quot;Vittor Pisani&quot; by local composer Achille Peri.

==Format==
The format consists of dancers who are non-professional and between the ages of 16–21, competing in a performance of dance routines of their choice, which they have prepared in advance of the competition. All of the acts then take part in a choreographed group dance during &#x27;Young Dancers Week&#x27;.

Jury members of a professional aspect and representing the elements of ballet, contemporary, and modern dancing styles, score each of the competing individual and group dance routines. The overall winner upon completion of the final dances is chosen by the professional jury members.

The interval act was a ballet performance from presenters repertoire.

==Results==
===Final===
Awards were given to the top three participants. The table below highlights these using &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;, and &quot;bronze&quot;. The placing results of the remaining participants is unknown and never made public by the European Broadcasting Union.

<text>The Eurovision Young Dancers 1987 was the second edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers, held at the Schlosstheater in Schwetzingen, Germany, on 31 May 1987. Organised by the European Broadcasting Union (EBU) and host broadcaster Zweites Deutsches Fernsehen (ZDF), dancers from fourteen countries participated in the televised final. , and made their debut at the contest, while and competed together with a joint entry.

For the first time ever, the Canadian broadcaster CBC (an EBU associate member), joined the show with its participant, making it the only Eurovision event to feature a country from North America, and the only EBU event to feature an associate member as a participant prior to Australia&#x27;s debut at the Eurovision Song Contest in 2015. The participant countries could send one or two dancers, male or female, that could not be older than 20. Each entry consisted in one or two dances with no rules or limitations regarding the style. The dances could not be longer than 5 minutes (for soloists) or 10 minutes (for couples).

Rose Gad Poulsen and Nikolaj Hübbe of Denmark won the contest, with Switzerland and West Germany placing second and third respectively.

==Location==
Schlosstheater Schwetzingen (Schwetzingen palace theater), a court theater in Schwetzingen, Baden-Württemberg, Germany was the host venue for the 1987 edition of the Eurovision Young Dancers.

The historic building, opened in 1753, is part of Schloss Schwetzingen and since 1952 the principal venue of the Schwetzingen Festival. It is also called &quot;Hoftheater&quot; (court theater), &quot;Hofoper&quot; (court opera), and &quot;Comoedienhaus&quot; (comedy house). The frequently applied name &quot;Rokokotheater&quot; (Rococo theater) is misleading, because it shows also neoclassical elements, added in 1762.

==Format==
The format consists of dancers who are non-professional and between the ages of 16–21, competing in a performance of dance routines of their choice, which they have prepared in advance of the competition. All of the acts then take part in a choreographed group dance during &#x27;Young Dancers Week&#x27;.

Jury members of a professional aspect and representing the elements of ballet, contemporary, and modern dancing styles, score each of the competing individual and group dance routines. The overall winner upon completion of the final dances is chosen by the professional jury members.

The interval was Arne Fagerholt who performed Kjersti Alveberg&#x27;s production &quot;Spirits&quot;.

==Results==
===Final===
Awards were given to the top three participants. The table below highlights these using &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;silver&quot;, and &quot;bronze&quot;. The placing results of the remaining participants is unknown and never made public by the European Broadcasting Union.

<text>Defender of the Faith ( or, specifically feminine, &quot;&quot;; ) is a phrase used as part of the full style of many English, Scottish and later British monarchs since the early 16th century, as well as by other monarchs and heads of state. 

==Scottish, English and British usage==

===History===
The earliest use of the term appears in 1507, when King James IV of Scotland was granted the title of &quot;Protector and Defender of the Christian Faith&quot; by Pope Julius II. The title was conferred on James IV by the papal legate Robert Bellenden in a lavish ceremony in Holyrood Abbey.

&quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; has been one of the subsidiary titles of the English and later British monarchs since it was granted on 11 October 1521 by Pope Leo X to King Henry VIII. His wife Catherine of Aragon also used the title. The title was conferred in recognition of Henry&#x27;s book &quot;Assertio Septem Sacramentorum&quot; (&quot;Defence of the Seven Sacraments&quot;), which defended the sacramental nature of marriage and the supremacy of the pope. This was also known as the &quot;Henrician Affirmation&quot; and was seen as an important opposition to the early stages of the Protestant Reformation, especially the ideas of Martin Luther.

Following Henry&#x27;s decision to break with Rome in 1530 and establish himself as head of the Church of England, the title was revoked by Pope Paul III and he was excommunicated. However in 1543 the Parliament of England conferred (by a bill entitled &quot;The Bill for the Kinges Stile&quot;) on King Henry VIII and his successors, now the defenders of the Anglican faith, the style &quot;Henry the Eighth by the Grace of God King of England, France and Ireland, Defender of the Faith and of the Church of England and also of Ireland in Earth the Supreme Head&quot;. All subsequent monarchs (except the Catholic Queen Mary I) became supreme governors.

King James V of Scotland was granted the title of &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; by Pope Paul III on 19 January 1537, symbolizing the hopes of the papacy that the King of Scots would resist the path that his uncle Henry VIII had followed. Neither this title nor James IV&#x27;s title of &quot;Protector and Defender of the Christian Faith&quot; became part of the full style of the monarch of Scotland.

During The Protectorate (1653–59), the republican heads of state Oliver Cromwell and Richard Cromwell, more clearly profiled as Protestant than the monarchy, although claiming divine sanction, did not adopt the style &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. The style was reintroduced after the restoration of the monarchy and remains in use to this day.

===Modern usage===

In his capacity as King of the United Kingdom, Charles III is styled &quot;Charles the Third, by the Grace of God of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland and of His other Realms and Territories King, Head of the Commonwealth, Defender of the Faith&quot;. The title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; reflects the Sovereign&#x27;s position as the supreme governor of the Church of England. The original Latin phrase is represented on all current British coins by the abbreviations or . This notation was first added to British coins in 1714, during the reign of King George I. The decision of the Royal Mint to omit this and certain other parts of the monarch&#x27;s style from the &quot;Godless Florin&quot; in 1849 caused such a scandal that the coin was replaced.

In most Commonwealth realms, the phrase does not appear in the Monarch&#x27;s full style, though the initial &quot;By the Grace of God&quot; is maintained. For example, in Australia, King Charles is currently styled &quot;by the Grace of God, King of Australia and His other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth&quot;. He is additionally styled &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; only in New Zealand and the UK. Canada had initially chosen to include the phrase, not because the sovereign is regarded as the protector of the state religion (Canada has none), but as a defender of faith in general. In a speech to the House of Commons in 1953, Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent stated:

However, the style used on Canadian coinage is simply D.G. Rex (, &quot;By the Grace of God, King&quot;).

In Australia, the monarch held the title &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot; until 1973, when it was formally removed. (The words &quot;by the Grace of God&quot; were retained, however.)

At various times, some countries of the Commonwealth retained the title until they formally became republics, e.g. South Africa from 29 May 1953. Others dropped it while still a dominion of the Commonwealth: e.g. Pakistan dropped the title in 1953 in recognition of the contradiction between its population being overwhelmingly Muslim and having a monarch who was a defender of the Christian faith.

King Charles III, when still heir apparent, expressed a preference to change the spirit of this role should he succeed to the throne as expected. He commented in 1994: &quot;I personally would rather see [my future role] as Defender of Faith, not &quot;the&quot; Faith&quot;; however, he clarified in 2015 that &quot;while at the same time being Defender of the Faith you can also be protector of faiths&quot;.

In the spring of 2023, the Canadian government introduced a bill to change the title of the Canadian sovereign by dropping the reference to the United Kingdom and the phrase &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;. The bill was approved by parliament and given royal assent on 22 June 2023; however, the new style and title did not become operative until the King issued a proclamation on 8 January 2024. The Canadian title is now:
:Charles the Third, by the Grace of God King of Canada and His other Realms and Territories, Head of the Commonwealth./Charles Trois, par la grâce de Dieu, Roi du Canada et de ses autres royaumes et territoires, Chef du Commonwealth.

==Usage in the French language==

===Haiti===
In 1811 when he proclaimed himself king, Henri I of Haiti awarded himself the title &quot;&quot; and incorporated it into his full style: which translates to English as: by the Grace of God and the Constitutional Law of the State, King of Haiti, Sovereign of Tortuga, Gonâve and other adjacent Islands, Destroyer of Tyranny, Regenerator and Benefactor of the Haitian Nation, Creator of her Moral, Political and Martial Institutions, First Crowned Monarch of the New World, &quot;Defender of the Faith&quot;, founder of the Royal and Military Order of Saint-Henry

===Canada===

The French variant was used until 2024 as part of the official French-language version of the monarch&#x27;s style in Canada: &quot;&quot;

==Elsewhere==
In 1684, Pope Innocent XI granted the honorary title () to John III Sobieski, king of Poland, who took the supreme command of the Christian Coalition army during the Battle of Vienna, considered as a turning point in the history of Europe, preventing it from being conquered by the Ottoman Empire.

One of the titles of Haile Selassie I, Emperor of Ethiopia, was Defender of the Faith.

One of the titles bestowed to Shivaji, the first Chhatrapati of the Maratha Empire, was , which means Defender of Hinduism.

In Sunni Islam, the historical leader of the faith was a secular ruler, rather than a spiritual one. The title of this leader was Caliph, deriving from the Arabic &quot;Khalifah&quot;, which can be loosely translated to &quot;steward&quot;, &quot;deputy&quot;, or &quot;successor&quot; (as the Caliph was the successor to the Prophet Muhammad, and the steward of his community on Earth). An additional title used by Caliphs was &quot;Amir al-Mu&#x27;minin&quot;, meaning &quot;Commander (Emir) of the Faithful&quot;. This title is still used by leaders who have historically claimed the Caliphate but officially do so no longer, like the King of Morocco and the Sultan of Sokoto. The secular ruler responsible for the maintenance and stewardship of the Masjid al-Haram in Mecca and the Mosque of the Prophet in Medina, as well as protecting the Hajj pilgrimage and its rituals, is called the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. This title is currently held by the King of Saudi Arabia.

In Thailand, five religious groups are legally recognized: Buddhists, Muslims, Brahmin-Hindus, Sikhs, and Christians. There is no official state religion, but the constitution provides (section 7): &quot;The King is a Buddhist and Upholder of religions&quot;.

==Similar titles==
The monarchs of other countries have received similar titles from the pope:
* Hungary: &quot;Apostolic Majesty&quot; (awarded )
* France: &quot;Most Christian Majesty&quot; (awarded )
* Spain: &quot;Most Catholic Majesty&quot; (awarded in 1493)
* Germany: &quot;Defensor Ecclesiae&quot; (Protector of the Church; awarded to Holy Roman Emperors)
* Poland: &quot;Orthodox Majesty&quot; (awarded in 1661)
* Portugal: &quot;Most Faithful Majesty&quot; (awarded in 1748)

<doc id="253305" wikidata="Q6006093" url="?curid=253305" title="Impassibility">
<text>Impassibility (from Latin &quot;in-&quot;, &quot;not&quot;, &quot;passibilis&quot;, &quot;able to suffer, experience emotion&quot;) describes the theological doctrine that God does not experience pain or pleasure from the actions of another being. It has often been seen as a consequence of divine aseity, the idea that God is absolutely independent of any other being, i.e., in no way causally dependent. Being affected (literally made to have a certain emotion, affect) by the state or actions of another would seem to imply causal dependence.

Some theological systems portray God as a being expressive of many (or all) emotions. Other systems, mainly Christianity, Judaism and Islam, portray God as a being that does not experience suffering. However, in Christianity there was an ancient dispute about the impassibility of God (see Nestorianism). Still, it is understood in all Abrahamic religions, including Christianity, that God is &quot;without passions&quot;, because God is immutable. So in Christianity, while the human nature of Christ is mutable and passable, the Godhead is not. (Bible, book of James, chapter 1 verse 17: &quot;Every good gift and every perfect gift is from above, and cometh down from the Father of lights, with whom is no variableness, neither shadow of turning.&quot; (King James Version).

==Christianity==
===Roman Catholic Church===

The Catholic Church teaches dogmatically that God is impassible. 

Impassibility of God the Father is mentioned in the Aquileian Creed (before the 4th century). As the Aquileian Creed affirms, this faith was shared by the Christian Churches of Rome, Alexandria of Egypt and Jerusalem. 

The impassibility of God is also indirectly affirmed The ineffability about God is affirmed by the First Vatican Council&#x27;s apostolic constitution &quot;Dei Filius&quot;:

The divine nature accordingly has no emotions, changes, alterations, height, width, depth, or any other temporal attributes. While Jesus Christ&#x27;s human nature was complete, and thus Christ possessed a human body, human mind and human soul, and thus human emotions, this human nature was hypostatically united with the timeless, immutable, impassible divine nature, which retained all of its divine attributes without alteration, just as his human nature retained all of its human attributes.
In Catholic doctrine, it would be erroneous and blasphemous to attribute changes or emotional states to God, except by analogy. Thus scriptural expressions which indicate &quot;anger&quot; or &quot;sadness&quot; on God&#x27;s part are considered anthropomorphisms, mere analogies to explain mankind&#x27;s relationship to God, who is impassible in his own nature.
Some objecting to this claim assert that if God cannot have emotions, then God cannot love, which is a central tenet of Christianity. However, Catholics would point out that love is not an emotion except in a secondary sense, and is far more than simply a changeable emotion. Furthermore, the human nature of Christ expressed emotional love as well as possessing the timeless, unconditioned &quot;agape&quot; of God.

===Main theologians ===

Theodoret, an early Christian bishop and theologian, wrote, &quot;wild and blasphemous are they who ascribe passion to the divine nature,&quot; in his Demonstrations by Syllogism.

Augustinism, one of the chief Christian schools of thought associated most often with Roman Catholicism and Calvinist Protestantism, strongly asserts the impassibility of God, as well as his impeccability. It also defends the notion of &quot;acts of God&quot; and divine intercession, such as the miracles of the Scriptures.

Martin Luther and especially John Calvin were heavily influenced by Augustine, and their theologies are similar in many respects in regard to divine impassibility.

Generally, scholars do not take anthropomorphic phrases in the Bible like &quot;the finger of God&quot; or &quot;the hand of God&quot; to mean that God literally has a hand or finger. Rather, it is interpreted as an allegory for the Holy Spirit and an expression of God&#x27;s sovereignty over and intervention into the material world.

===Views in scripture===
Other Christian views portray a God who does have emotions and emotional reactions to creation, but these emotions should not necessarily be viewed as altogether similar to human emotions. Genesis 1 says that humans were made in God&#x27;s image, but human emotions, originally a reflection of God&#x27;s emotional capacity, have been marred by the fall of man.

Human emotions are subject to time, space, and circumstance. God&#x27;s emotions are always in keeping with God&#x27;s character as described by the scriptures and in the person of Jesus Christ, according to Christian scholars and the Bible. A few examples are found in Genesis, chapter 8, in the account of the Flood.

God is &quot;grieved&quot; at the pervasive evil of mankind, yet &quot;pleased&quot; with Noah&#x27;s faithfulness. After the flood, God is &quot;pleased&quot; by Noah&#x27;s burnt offering. Traditional Christian interpretation understood such depictions of changing emotion in God to be simply an anthropomorphic way of expressing his pleasure or displeasure with human actions. They believed God&#x27;s eternal will for mankind and love for mankind in Christ does not undergo alteration; God is immutable.

Although there are differing opinions in Christian circles about the impassibility of God, Christian scholars consent that Jesus was completely human and completely God, and so expressed sanctified emotions and was subject to the same physical limitations as humanity, such as hunger or exhaustion. Most Christians traditionally believed these experiences to be proper only to Jesus&#x27; human nature.

The New Testament says in Hebrews, &quot;For we do not have a high priest who is unable to sympathize with our weaknesses, but we have one who has been tempted in every way, just as we are—yet was without sin.&quot; For this reason, God accepted Christ&#x27;s sacrifice on man&#x27;s behalf and so is able to offer atonement through Christ.

===Gnosticism===

Some early adepts of gnosticism held that Jesus did not have a living body and was not able to suffer the Passion. This debate occupied a great deal of early Church Fathers, who took labours to prove that Jesus really did have a human body.

===Theopaschism===

A rival doctrine is called theopaschism, which highly insists on the suffering of the Lord Jesus at the Passion. However, theopaschism, along with patripassionism, has often been rejected by theologians as a form of modalism.

==Judaism==

Jews generally hold to the impassibility of God and do not believe that the Messiah is divine or spiritual, but rather that he is political. The belief in divine simplicity is at the heart of Judaism, and the gender of God (i.e., God the Father) is not specified.

==Islam==
The Islamic religion is based on the notion of the absolute impassibility of God, an impassibility which is only matched by transcendence. Islam does not believe in incarnation, passion, Holy Trinity and resurrection and God the Father because it is seen as an attack on divine impassibility.

Although love and mercy are attributed to God, it is emphasised that God is completely dissimilar to created things. Al-Rahman &amp; Al-Raheem, the Merciful, is one of the primary names of God in Islam, but meant in terms of God being beneficent towards creation rather than in terms of softening of the heart. The latter implies a psychological change, and contradicts God&#x27;s absolute transcendence.

==Greek mythology==

Many polytheistic traditions portray their gods as feeling a wide range of emotions. For example, Zeus is famous for his lustfulness, Susano-o for his intemperance, and Balder for his joyousness and calm. Impassibility in the Western tradition traces back to ancient Greek philosophers like Aristotle and Plato, who first proposed the idea of God as a perfect, omniscient, timeless, and unchanging being not subject to human emotion (which represents change and imperfection). The concept of impassibility was developed by medieval theologians like Anselm and continues to be in tension with more emotional concepts of God.

<text>Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer (, alternatively with the definite article Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, &quot;(the) Saint Marys of the Sea&quot;, locally Les Saintes, ; Provençal: &quot;Lei Santei Marias de la Mar&quot; or &quot;Li Sànti Marìo de la Mar&quot; ), is the capital of the Camargue (Provençal: &quot;Camarga&quot;) natural region in Southern France. It lies on the Mediterranean Sea.

Administratively, it is a commune in the Bouches-du-Rhône department, on the departmental border with Gard. It covers the second-largest area of all communes in metropolitan France, smaller only than that of neighbouring Arles. In 2021, it had a population of 2,120.

==Geography==
The town is situated in the Rhône river delta, about 1 km east of the mouth of the Petit Rhône distributary. The commune comprises alluvial land and marshland, and includes the Étang de Vaccarès, a large lagoon. The main industry is tourism. Agriculture is also significant, and ranchers have raised horses and cattle unique to the Camargue; some of the bulls are used for Spanish-style bull-fighting and for the bloodless &quot;course camarguaise&quot;. There is bus service to Arles, 38 km away.

==History==
The village was noted as &quot;Ra&quot; in the 4th century AD by the Roman geographer Rufus Festus Avienus. In the 6th century, the archbishopric of Arles was active and created a monastery or church in the town, named St Mary, a favorite of the fishermen. The village became known as Notre-Dame-de-Ratis (Our Lady of the Boat—&quot;Râ&quot; being used in &quot;ratis&quot;, or boat) in reference to the three Marys arriving by boat. (Droit, 1963, 19). The name was later changed to Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer (Our Lady of the Sea, a synonym for the Virgin Mary).

The current Church of the Saintes Maries de la Mer was built from the 9th to the 12th century, as a fortress and a refuge. It can be seen from 10 km away. It has a fresh water well inside, for when the villagers had to take shelter from raiders. In the 9th century, the town suffered raids from the Mediterranean Sea by the Vikings and later from the Saracens. In the 15th century, someone discovered the relics of Mary of Clopas and Mary Salome, who were said to have arrived there by sea (together with Mary Magdalene). The 500th anniversary of this event was celebrated in the 20th century by Pope John XXIII.

In 1720, the town was spared by the plague. During the anti-clerical fervor of the French Revolution, the church was partially destroyed and the stones recycled.

In 1838, the town was renamed &quot;Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer,&quot; after the three Maries of its Catholic and local history. Shortly afterward, the pilgrimage (see below) was instituted. A narrow-gauge railway line to Arles operated from 1892 until 1953.

In 1888, Van Gogh made several paintings of the seascape and the town. In the early 20th century, the town was a literary and artistic center, with visits &quot;inter alios&quot; from such figures as American writer Ernest Hemingway and Spanish painter Picasso. The vicinity was used as a setting for various films.

Since the second half of the 20th century, the population has increased. Retired people and holiday accommodation largely supplanted the fishermen and farmers, with a corresponding political shift to the right in elections.

==Religion==

Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer, an ancient town in the marshes of the Camargue, where the Rhône meets the Mediterranean Sea, is named after The Three Marys—in French, Marie Madeleine, Marie Salomé and Marie de Cléophas—a group of three women closely linked to Jesus, as according to the gospels they came to his sepulchre three days after the Crucifixion and were the first witnesses of his Resurrection. The designation &quot;de-la-Mer&quot; (of the sea) derives from a medieval tradition that after Jesus&#x27; Resurrection, The Three Marys escaped the Christian persecution in Judaea and travelled across the sea by boat, living in the Camargue the rest of their lives and helping to bring Christianity to France.

The three saints Mary Magdalene, Mary Salome and Mary of Clopas are believed to be the women who were the first witnesses to the empty tomb at the resurrection of Jesus. After the Crucifixion of Jesus, the Marys were said to set sail from Alexandria, Egypt, with their uncle Joseph of Arimathea. According to a longstanding French legend, they either sailed to or were cast adrift—arriving off the coast of what is now France, at &quot;a sort of fortress named Oppidum-Râ&quot;. The location became known as &quot;Our Lady of the Boat&quot; ()—&quot;Râ&quot; being used in &quot;ratis&quot;, or boat). The name was later changed to Notre-Dame-de-la-Mer. In 1838, it was changed to Les Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer.

Today, aside from being a working class summer beach destination with a picturesque Romanesque fortress-church, Church of the Saintes Maries de la Mer, Saintes-Maries-de-la-Mer is known in France for the celebrations it holds for each Mary&#x27;s feast, in May and October. The feast days in May draw large numbers of Roma Catholics and others from France and beyond—typically 25,000–40,000 people all together—to the town for a week. The high points at that feast include a ritual when a painted reliquary chest, said to contain the bones of the Saintes Maries, is ceremoniously lowered from its high perch to the altar for veneration, and when the crypt is left open so that the statue of another figure, the Roma&#x27;s own Saint Sarah, can be honored. On successive days, Romas and a large crowd process statues of Sara and the Saintes Maries from the church to the beach, carrying them right into the sea.

The dark-skinned Saint Sara of the Roma pilgrimage is said to have possibly been the Egyptian servant of the three Marys. In another version, Sara was a local woman who welcomed the three Marys on their arrival. A statue of Sarah is in the crypt of the church, which also encloses a 4th-century BC taurobolic altar once dedicated to the cult of the Indo-Iranian god Mithras, although a likely Celtic origin is claimed.

<doc id="253314" wikidata="Q18548" url="?curid=253314" title="Manchester Metrolink">
<text>Manchester Metrolink is a tram/light rail system in Greater Manchester, England. The network has 99 stops along of standard-gauge route, making it the most extensive light rail system in the United Kingdom. Over the 2023/24 financial year 42 million passenger journeys were made on the system.

Metrolink is owned by the public body Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) and is part of the region&#x27;s Bee Network. It is operated and maintained under contract by a Keolis/Amey consortium. 

The network consists of eight lines which radiate from Manchester city centre to termini at Altrincham, Ashton-under-Lyne, Bury, East Didsbury, Eccles, Manchester Airport, Rochdale and the Trafford Centre. It runs on a mixture of on-street track shared with other traffic; reserved track sections segregated from other traffic, and converted former railway lines. 

Metrolink is operated by a fleet of 147 high-floor Bombardier M5000 light rail vehicles. Each of the nine Metrolink routes run five trams per hour in each direction; stops with more than one route running through it will have trams arriving more frequently. Services on busier lines operate as &quot;doubles&quot;: two tram vehicles coupled together.

A light rail system for Greater Manchester emerged from the failure of the 1970s Picc-Vic tunnel scheme to obtain central government funding. A light-rail scheme was proposed in 1982 as the least expensive rail-based transport solution for Manchester city centre and the surrounding Greater Manchester metropolitan area. Government approval was granted in 1988, and the network began operating services between Bury Interchange and on 6 April 1992. Metrolink became the United Kingdom&#x27;s first modern street-running rail system; the 1885-built Blackpool tramway being the only first-generation tram system in the UK that had survived up to Metrolink&#x27;s creation.

Expansion of Metrolink has been a critical strategy of transport planners in Greater Manchester, who have overseen its development in successive projects, known as Phases 1, 2, 3a, 3b, 2CC, and Trafford Park. The latest extension, the Trafford Park Line from to The Trafford Centre, opened on 22 March 2020. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority has proposed numerous further expansions of the network, including the addition of tram-train technology to extend Metrolink services onto local heavy-rail lines.

==History==

===Predecessors===
Manchester&#x27;s first tram age began in 1877 with the first horse-drawn trams of Manchester Suburban Tramways Company. Electric traction was introduced in 1901, and the municipal Manchester Corporation Tramways expanded across the city. By 1930, Manchester&#x27;s tram network had grown to , making it the third-largest tram system in the United Kingdom. After World War II, electric trolleybuses and motor buses began to be favoured by local authorities as a cheaper transport alternative, and by 1949 the last Manchester tram line was closed. Trolleybuses were withdrawn from service in 1966.

===Origins===
Greater Manchester&#x27;s railway network historically suffered from poor north–south connections because Manchester&#x27;s main railway stations, Piccadilly and Victoria, were built in the 1840s on peripheral locations outside Manchester city centre. The central commercial district had no rail links, and over the years, several unsuccessful schemes were proposed to connect Manchester&#x27;s rail termini. In the 1960s, transport design studies were undertaken to address the problems of increasing traffic congestion. Many urban public transport schemes were evaluated for Manchester, including several types of monorail systems and metro-style systems.

While the monorail schemes were all abandoned, a scheme to create a tunnel link gained momentum. The SELNEC Passenger Transport Executive — the body formed in 1969 to improve public transport for Manchester and its surrounding municipalities – promoted the &#x27;Picc-Vic tunnel&#x27; project. The project was a proposal to link Piccadilly and Victoria stations via a tunnel under the city centre and enable train services to run across the Manchester conurbation. Greater Manchester County Council (GMC) inherited the project and presented it to the United Kingdom Government in 1974, but the council failed to secure the necessary funding, and the project was abandoned in 1977. The Centreline shuttle bus service provided inter-station links for many years.

The Greater Manchester Passenger Transport Executive (GMPTE), the successor to SELNEC, continued to examine possible rail link solutions. Light rail emerged in the early 1980s as a cost-effective option that could make use of existing railway lines and run through the city centre at street level, eliminating the need for costly tunnelling works. A Rail Study Group, composed of officials from British Rail, GMC and GMPTE formally endorsed the &quot;Project Light Rail&quot; scheme in 1984. Initial abstract proposals, based on light rail systems in North America and continental Europe, illustrated a draft network consisting of three lines: Altrincham–/, Bury–/ and –. To promote the scheme, GMPTE held a public proof of concept demonstration in March 1987 using a Docklands Light Railway P86 train on a freight-only line adjacent to Debdale Park. The Project Light Rail proposals were presented to the UK Government for taxpayer funding; following route revisions in 1984 and 1987, Project Light Rail was approved. Because of the central government&#x27;s constraints on financial support for innovative transport projects, funding was granted by HM Treasury with the strict condition that the system be constructed in phases. Additional taxpayer funding came from the European Regional Development Fund and bank lending.

===Construction===
==== Phase 1 ====
Parliamentary authority to proceed with Phase 1 construction was obtained with two Acts of Parliament – the Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) Act 1988 and Greater Manchester (Light Rapid Transit System) (No. 2) Act 1988.
The first phase of Metrolink involved the conversion of two suburban heavy rail lines to light rail operation — the Bury Line in the north (conversion started in July 1991) and the MSJ&amp;AR line in the south (conversion started December 1991) — and the construction of a street-level tramway through the city centre to connect the two. Tracks were laid down along a route from Victoria station, via Market Street and St Peter&#x27;s Square to the G-Mex, with a branch from Piccadilly Gardens to Manchester Piccadilly station. This route is now known as the First City Crossing (1CC), and it was built with network expansion in mind.

A fleet of 26 AnsaldoBreda T-68 light rail vehicles was procured to operate the network. Construction was carried out by the GMA Group (a consortium of AMEC, GM Buses, John Mowlem &amp; Company and GEC), costing £145million (equivalent to £million in ).

Metrolink was initially scheduled to open in September 1991, but services did not begin until 1992, when the Bury Line of the Metrolink opened from Victoria station to Bury Interchange on 6 April. The first street-level trams began running on 27 April between Victoria and G-Mex (renamed in 2010), and the Altrincham Line opened on 15 June from G-Mex to Altrincham. The branch to Piccadilly station opened on 20 July. Metrolink was officially opened by Queen Elizabeth II on 17 July 1992.

==== Phase 2 ====

In Phase 2, the Metrolink network was extended westwards to Eccles along the new Eccles Line, as part of the 1990s urban regeneration of Salford Quays, increasing the total Metrolink route length to . The extension cost £160million (equivalent to £million in ) and was funded by the GMPTA, the ERDF and private developers. It was constructed 1997–99 by Altram (a consortium of Serco, Ansaldo and John Laing) and six new AnsaldoBreda T-68A trams were bought to operate services on the line, but were also used in other locations across the network. The line was inaugurated by Prime Minister Tony Blair on 6 December 1999 as far as Broadway tram stop as the street running section to Eccles Interchange was completed. The Broadway–Eccles section was opened on 21 July 2000, and the complete line was officially opened by Princess Anne on 9 January 2001.

==== Phase 3 ====

The Phase 3 extension project, nicknamed the &quot;Big Bang&quot;, was promoted by GMPTE and the Association of Greater Manchester Authorities (AGMA) in the early 2000s. The project, costing £489million (£million in ), would create four new lines: the Oldham and Rochdale Line, East Manchester Line, South Manchester Line, and Airport Line. Phase 3 was put in doubt when central government funding was withdrawn due to increasing costs, but after negotiations with the Department for Transport, Phase 3 was split into two parts, 3a and 3b, to secure investment. 

The new spur off the Eccles Line to was funded separately by the Northwest Regional Development Agency. As part of Phase 3, the original blue T-68 trams were also phased out and replaced with a new fleet of Bombardier M5000 trams, which entered service in December 2009.
Beginning in October 2009 with the closure of the Oldham Loop heavy rail line, Phase 3a involved converting this line to light rail operation, including rebuilding all stations on the route and adding several new stops as well, re-opening a disused section of the Cheshire Lines Committee railway to use as the first part of the South Manchester Line (up to ), and building a new East Manchester Line as far as . When completed in 2013, Phase 3a increased Metrolink&#x27;s total network length to .

Phase 3b involved the construction of a new Airport Line to Manchester Airport, and extending three of the Phase 3a lines: the East Manchester Line to Ashton-under-Lyne; the South Manchester Line to East Didsbury; and adding street-running routes through Oldham and Rochdale town centres to the Oldham and Rochdale Line. Construction work began in March 2011, and Phase 3b was completed in November 2014 with the Airport Line&#x27;s opening. Phase 3b was delayed after a failed bid to raise funding through the Greater Manchester Transport Innovation Fund and a proposed traffic congestion charge in 2008. GMPTE and AGMA instead funded Phase 3b through a combination of council tax, government grants, Metrolink fares and contributions from the Manchester Airports Group and other bodies.

==== Phase 2CC ====

With increased tram traffic brought about by the expansion of the Metrolink network, it became necessary to build a new route across Manchester City Centre to alleviate congestion and improve capacity.

Known as the Second City Crossing (or 2CC), the project involved laying of tram tracks from St Peter&#x27;s Square tram stop via Princess Street, Albert Square, Cross Street and Corporation Street to rejoin the original Metrolink line just before Victoria station. One new tram stop was built at . The project also involved re-ordering St Peter&#x27;s Square and re-siting the Cenotaph to accommodate an enlarged tram interchange and junction. The realigned tracks were to run over the site of the former St Peter&#x27;s Church (demolished 1907). To protect the remaining underground burial vaults of the church, concrete slabs were put in place below street level before the tram tracks were laid. The stone cross marking the location of the former church was restored and re-instated close to its original location, in between the tracks.

Construction began in 2014, and the 2CC route opened fully in February 2017.

==== Trafford Park ====
The Transport &amp; Works Act Order for the 3.4 mile (5.4 km) Trafford Park Line was granted in October 2016. This new line includes six tram stops, including, but not limited to, a stop at Wharfside to serve Old Trafford Stadium closer and faster than Old Trafford tram stop, a stop at Imperial War Museum, also providing a closer and faster connection to IWM North from the city centre, the alternate tram option being walking from MediaCityUK, and a stop adjacent to Barton Dock Road, serving Trafford Palazzo. All six stops also opened with new dot matrix displays unique to the rest of the network. Enabling works began in January 2017, and the first test tram ran in November 2019 between Pomona and Village. The line finally opened on 22 March 2020. The COVID-19 pandemic lockdown in the UK on the second day of operation overshadowed news of the new line&#x27;s opening, leading to it not getting much ridership after the lockdown ended.

==Routes==
===Routes and stops===

===Frequencies===
Before the inauguration, GMPTE&#x27;s original concept was for Metrolink&#x27;s operator to provide a service every ten minutes from Bury to Piccadilly and Altrincham to Piccadilly from 06:00 to midnight, Monday to Saturday. Greater Manchester Metro Limited, the system&#x27;s original operator, argued for adjustments, citing the need to provide an efficient and commercially viable operation in line with vehicle running times and passenger demand. Due to power limitations, this pattern was modified to a twelve-minute service throughout the day, doubling to a six-minute service in peak periods, resulting in a &quot;ten trams per hour&quot; service pattern on routes running from Altrincham and Bury to Manchester every six minutes. Operators were required to provide this level of service at least 98% of the time or incur a financial penalty charge. This twelve-minute service pattern has been adopted on the rest of the network as the system has grown. Heavy snowfall during the winter of 2009/10 impaired Metrolink services and the operator was criticised for failing to have cold weather procedures. This prompted a programme to improve the reliability and performance of the system in freezing conditions. Metrolink operated icebreaker-style vehicles at night during snowfall in January 2013 to provide standard services.

In January 2016, Transport for Greater Manchester agreed on a baseline Service Specification to grade bidders seeking to operate the concession from July 2017, once the Second City Crossing was in operation. In the baseline service pattern, there are no designated &#x27;peak&#x27; periods of service operation; instead, there was an &#x27;enhanced&#x27; service operating from start of service to 08:00 Monday to Friday, and to 18:00 Saturday; and a &#x27;core&#x27; service running at all other times. In the &#x27;enhanced&#x27; service pattern, trams ran with a six-minute frequency to Shaw and Crompton, Bury, Ashton-under-Lyne, Altrincham, Manchester Airport and East Didsbury; and with a 12-minute frequency to Rochdale, Eccles and MediaCityUK.

As of 2024, the &quot;core&quot; service pattern operates exactly one route to every terminus on the Metrolink network, during all operating times, at a 12-minute frequency on all routes (15 minute frequency on Sundays), and the &quot;enhanced&quot; service pattern operates the core service plus extra services up to Bury, Altrincham, Etihad Campus, Shaw and Crompton, East Didsbury, and MediaCityUK.
All-day services (core)

The following services run during all operating times, from 06:00–00:00 on Monday–Thursday, 06:00–01:00 on Friday–Saturday, and 07:00–00:00 on Sundays and bank holidays.

Six services which each run to a 12-minute frequency (24-minute after 00:00, and 15-minute on Sundays):
* – (via outside Mon–Sat daytime hours)
* – 
* – 
This is the minimum service that the Metrolink can provide whilst bringing trams to all available stops, hence why it is called the &#x27;core&#x27; service.

Daytime services (enhanced)

The following services run alongside the core service during peak times: from 07:00–20:00 on Monday–Friday and 09:00–18:30 on Saturdays, and not operational on Sundays or bank holidays.

Three extra services which each run to a 12-minute frequency (24-minute after 00:00):
* Etihad Campus – 

Thus the combined frequency for some routes is every 6 minutes or less.

Other part-day services

The Altrincham – Piccadilly service operates an extended service to Etihad Campus from 20:00–00:00 on Monday–Thursdays, 20:00–01:00 Friday–Saturdays, and 07:00–00:00 (all day) Sundays and bank holidays.

One service which replaces the normal service and runs to Etihad Campus via Piccadilly and runs to a 12-minute frequency (24-minute after 00:00, and 15-minute on Sundays):

* Altrincham – Etihad Campus

Early morning service

The early morning service used to operate from 03:00–06:00 Monday–Saturdays and 03:00–07:00 on Sundays and bank holidays.

One service which ran to a 20-minute frequency:

This was mostly to support airport shift workers and people with early flights, however, these services were removed in March 2020 due to the COVID-19 pandemic. There are currently no plans to reintroduce this service.

Services during COVID-19 pandemic

Due to changing travel patterns as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, advice was against all but essential travel, and thus, the Metrolink temporarily introduced a reduced timetable, and trams ran to a 20-minute frequency on the following routes only. 

Gradually, in the following months, with more people returning to work and social activities, the service frequency on all routes was increased to 10 minutes during peak times and 20 minutes off-peak Monday–Saturday, and every 15 minutes on Sundays. Normal service was reintroduced on 5 July 2021, although temporarily removed in late August 2021 due the number of staff having to self isolate. The two enhanced service routes at the time: Altrincham–Bury direct and Shaw and Crompton–East Didsbury resumed on 31 August and 6 September 2021 respectively.

==Rolling stock==

===Current fleet===
, Metrolink operated a fleet of 147 trams.
Because low-floor tram technology was in its infancy when Metrolink was in its planning stages, and in order to be compatible with the former British Rail stations that Metrolink inherited, the network uses high-floor trams with a platform height of , the same height as main line trains.

Trams on Metrolink operate either single units, or coupled together to form double units, which regularly run on the Altrincham – Bury line and on other lines during peak hours.

====Bombardier M5000====
In December 2009, Metrolink took delivery of the first Bombardier M5000 tram. Built by Bombardier Transportation and Vossloh Kiepe, the initial eight M5000s were ordered to allow services to be increased. They are part of the Bombardier Flexity Swift range of light rail vehicles and have a design similar to the K5000 vehicle used on the Cologne Stadtbahn and Bonn Stadtbahn.

With the approval of the spur to MediaCityUK, a further four were ordered. To provide rolling stock for the phase 3 extensions and replace the existing fleet, the order was increased successively to 94. In December 2013, a further 10 M5000s were ordered to provide trams for the Trafford Park Line planned to open in 2020, while in the interim supporting a service between MediaCityUK and Manchester city centre and other capacity enhancements. In September 2014, a further 16 were ordered; the final one of which was delivered in October 2016, bringing the fleet up to 120.

In July 2018, a further 27 were ordered to help relieve overcrowding. Delivered from November 2020, the final tram was delivered in October 2022.

===Ancillary vehicles===
Metrolink has several ancillary vehicles used for maintenance within depots. The &quot;Special Purpose Vehicle&quot;, later numbered 1027 with its support wagon 1028, is a bespoke diesel-powered vehicle dating from the networks construction in 1991. It is fitted with a crane, inspection platform, mobile workshop, and capacity for a driver and three passengers. It was designed to assist with vehicle recovery and track and line repairs although to the end of its service life rarely left its base at Queens Road Depot. By January 2023 both 1027 &amp; 1028 had been withdrawn from service and offered for sale in September 2024.

In 2020 Metrolink took delivery of a Zephir Crab 2100E, a small battery powered vehicle for use moving trams within the depot. It is based at Queens Road to replace the Special Purpose Vehicle. Trafford depot operates a smaller Zephir Crab 1500E dating from construction of the depot in 2011. A Unimog road-rail vehicle was added to the fleet in mid-2022 to support infrastructure inspection and maintenance activities.

===Former fleet===
Manchester Metrolink has previously operated the following trams:

====T-68/68A====
To commence operations, a fleet of 26 T-68 trams manufactured by AnsaldoBreda in Italy was delivered in 1992. To provide extra trams for the Eccles Line, six modified T-68A trams were purchased in 1999. The T-68A vehicles were based on the original T-68s but had modifications replacing destination rollblinds with dot matrix displays, and retractable couplers and covered bogies necessary for the high proportion of on-street running close to motor traffic.

Three of the earlier T-68 fleet were similarly equipped and were known as T-68Ms. Mechanically and electrically, the T-68M vehicles were essentially a T-68 with modifications to its brakes, mirrors, and speed limiters to suit the Eccles line. Initially only these vehicles were permitted to operate the Eccles line but the entire fleet except for 3 (1018, 1019, 1020) were modified between 2008 and 2012 for universal running, under a programme known as the T-68X Universal Running programme.

The newer M5000 trams proved to be considerably more reliable than the T-68/A fleet, which averaged 5,000 miles between breakdowns, while the M5000s averaged 20,000 miles. This led to a decision in 2012 to withdraw the entire fleet from service and replace them with M5000s. The T-68 and T-68As were withdrawn between April 2012 and April 2014.

T68 1007 is owned by the Manchester Transport Museum Society, who run the Heaton Park Tramway, it remains in store at Old Trafford depot until it can be accommodated at Heaton Park. 1023 remains under the ownership of Transport for Greater Manchester and is at the Crewe Heritage Centre on display.

===San Francisco trams===

In 2002, in the lead up to Manchester hosting the Commonwealth Games, a requirement to increase capacity for the event led to Metrolink investigating the purchase of redundant second-hand Boeing LRV vehicles from the Muni Metro system in San Francisco. Two were procured for testing at a cost of £170 each, although transport costs added £15,000 to that figure. The trams, numbered 1226 and 1326, were shipped to the UK in January 2002, with 1326 taken to Queen&#x27;s Road depot and 1226 sent to a research centre in Derby for safety evaluations. 1326 was hauled by the Special purpose vehicle on a test from Queens Road depot to Eccles and back but suffered from a number of derailments. In the end, the proposal was not taken forward as the vehicles were found to be unsuitable and not cost effective for use in the UK with both later being scrapped.

==Infrastructure==

===Lines===
As of August 2022, Metrolink has a network length of and 99 stops — along eight lines which radiate from a &quot;central triangular junction at Piccadilly Gardens which forms the hub of the Metrolink system&quot; in Zone 1.

The lines are: the Airport Line (which terminates at Manchester Airport), the Altrincham Line (which terminates in Altrincham), the Bury Line (which terminates in Bury), the East Manchester Line (which terminates in Ashton-under-Lyne), the Eccles Line (which terminates in Eccles), the Oldham and Rochdale Line (which terminates in Rochdale), the South Manchester Line (which terminates in East Didsbury), and the Trafford Park Line (which terminates at the Trafford Centre).


===Tram stops===
There are 99 tram stops on Metrolink, as of 2023. Low-floor platforms commonly used for light rail throughout the world were ruled out for Metrolink because the system inherited high-floor platforms from British Rail on lines formerly used for heavy rail. The first stops on the Bury Line and Altrincham Line, opened in phase one, were formerly railway stations and were changed little from British Rail days, as available funding only allowed minimum upgrades to be made. When the Oldham and Rochdale Line was converted from a railway, however, all of the former railway stations were completely rebuilt.

Some stops, such as , are shared between lines, and may be used as interchange stations; others, such as Altrincham Interchange, or are transport hubs that integrate with heavy rail and bus stations.

Metrolink stops are unstaffed. Each contains at least two ticket vending machines (except for Pomona, which only has one). Card readers are installed on all stop platforms for use with contactless pay-as-you-go, the TfGM &#x27;My Get Me There&#x27; smart card, and concessionary passes. All card users are required to touch-in at these platform readers before commencing their journey and to touch-out at their final destination. Stops are provided with help/emergency call points to enable passengers to speak to control. Each stop is monitored by CCTV for public safety, and the images are continuously recorded. Route maps and general information are provided on each platform. Each stop has at least one high-floor platform measuring a minimum of wide, accessed by ramp, stairs, escalator, lift or combination thereof. Shelters and canopies at stops were supplied by JCDecaux, and ticket vending machines by Scheidt &amp; Bachmann.

===Power supply===
The trams are electrically powered from 750 V DC overhead lines. Between 1992 and 2007, electricity for the Metrolink system was procured by the operator, based on price only. In 2007, GMPTE changed the contractual requirements to ensure that sustainable power would be factored into choosing an energy supplier, and in July 2007, Metrolink became the first light rail network in the UK with electricity supplied entirely from sustainable energy via hydropower. Now, energy for the system is generated by biomass.

===Signalling===
The Metrolink operated using two types of signals during Phase 1 and Phase 2, Line Of Sight signals and Two Aspect colour signals. These signals were controlled with a device called the Vehicle Recognition System (VRS) inside the cab of the tram, which sent information to the control room via a pair of coils on the un-motored centre bogie. In preparation for Phase 3, a new device was introduced called the Tram Management System (TMS) as the Two Aspect colour signals would not be able to support the headway between trams (zero minutes) and the level of flexibility required for the new lines. This meant that every line would become fully Line Of Sight. The Two Aspect colour signals were removed between 2012–2022 as more lines were being converted to Line Of Sight. The only section of the Metrolink network that cannot be converted to Line Of Sight signalling is on the Altrincham Line between Timperley–Altrincham, as that section is under Network Rail control. Any trams numbered 3061 or higher are not compatible and cannot run on this section of the Altrincham Line. 

===Depots===

Metrolink has two depots, at Queens Road and Old Trafford: the Metrolink House at Queens Road in Cheetham Hill was the original headquarters of Metrolink. Constructed during Phase 1 alongside the Bury Line, it served jointly as a control centre, HQ, office space, and depot for the storage, maintenance and repair of vehicles. Under the original proposals, Metrolink House was intended to be much larger, with a design which would support network expansion, but this design did not obtain the necessary planning permission from Manchester City Council. Consequently, Metrolink House was scaled down to a £8million site with limited capacity, and, in light of Phase 3a network expansion, the second depot in Old Trafford was built in 2011. This second depot, adjacent to the Old Trafford tram stop, occupies the site of a former warehouse and can stable up to 96 vehicles, it also has a washing plant and maintenance workshops. On 7 May 2013 Metrolink completed the transfer of its main operational functions from Queens Road to Old Trafford, meaning its control room – known as the Network Management Centre – is housed jointly with the Customer Services team by its newer depot.

==Fares and ticketing==
Metrolink fares were initially set by the system&#x27;s operator, but are now set by the TfGM Committee at levels that cover both the running costs and the cost of borrowing that has part-funded the expansion of the system; Metrolink receives no public subsidy. Fares typically rise each January above the rate of inflation, but have been frozen since the last change in 2020. The fare tariff is based on a division of the network&#x27;s stops into fare zones. Persons under five years of age may travel on the Metrolink for free. Persons under 16 years of age, of pensionable age, or with disabilities qualify for concessionary fares, some of which are mandatory and others discretionary, as determined by the Greater Manchester Combined Authority. The Greater Manchester Combined Authority permits reduced fares for persons under 16 years of age, and free or reduced fares on Metrolink after 9:30a.m. for pensioners. In normal circumstances, tickets cannot be purchased on board Metrolink vehicles and must be purchased from a ticket vending machine before boarding the vehicle.

Fare evasion in 2006 was estimated at 2–6% of all users, and in 2012 at 2.5% of all users. Checking tickets and passes and issuing Standard fares (similar to penalty fare) is the responsibility of Metrolink&#x27;s Passenger Services Representatives (PSRs), who provide security and assistance on the network; between 1992 and 2008, Greater Manchester Police had a dedicated Metrolink unit responsible for policing the system. The amount of ticket inspectors onboard trams was increased following the Bee Network&#x27;s launch in September 2023, and the penalty or evading fares also increased.

Thorn EMI designed the original ticket vending machines. In 2005, GMPTE announced that rail passengers travelling from within Greater Manchester into Manchester city centre could use the Metrolink service in the City Zone for free. Passengers must present a valid rail ticket, correctly dated with Manchester Ctlz as the destination. In 2007 TfGM rolled out new ticket vending machines, designed to accept credit/debit card payments and permit the purchase of multiple tickets in a single transaction. These were replaced in 2009 with touchscreen machines, designed with the Scheidt &amp; Bachmann Ticket XPress system.

In October 2012, TfGM announced it was devising a more straightforward zonal fare system, comparable to London fare zones, and preparing to introduce &#x27;get me there&#x27;, the region&#x27;s new contactless smartcard system, for use on all public transport modes in Greater Manchester, including Metrolink. After years of consultation, a new system using four concentric zones was implemented on 13 January 2019. From 15 July 2019, a new contactless pay-as-you-go service began, allowing passengers to tap in and out on smart readers using their contactless bank cards. Contactless fares were originally capped to no more than the cost of the equivalent daily travelcard. In September 2021 an additional weekly cap was introduced.

==Services==

===Accessibility===
Metrolink trams and stops have been designed to be accessible to disabled passengers: each stop has been provided with access ramps or lifts, tactile paving, high visibility handrails, disabled boarding points, and help points on the platforms. The trams have also been designed with large areas available for the provision of wheelchairs and pushchairs.

However, this access was not in the original plans (which were based on tram-side extending steps and low-level platforms in the city centre) and accessibility took four years of concerted campaigning by disabled people in Greater Manchester from 1984 to 1988, and particularly the efforts of Neville Strowger (1939–2015), a disabled person working as the access officer at Manchester City Council, and a founding member of the Greater Manchester Coalition of Disabled People. The campaign was to change the design policy to create full access, including retrofitting access to the legacy train stations on the Bury line and the Altrincham line. An early milestone in the campaign was a large meeting between GMPTE officers and around 70 disabled people at County Hall on 22 November 1984, including a speech from the invited disability rights campaigner Vic Finkelstein. A further key meeting was in May 1987 with over 100 disabled people and elected Councillor Guy Harkin as Chair of GMPTA plus other officials, but the policy in 1987 that was repeated at this meeting was that access would only be possible &quot;if the budget allows.&quot; Full access was finally agreed in the summer of 1988, and productive meetings followed with disabled people on the implementation details. This campaigning was researched in detail starting in 2019 and written up in an 8-page pamphlet in February 2020.

Mobility scooters were initially banned from Metrolink. However, in 2014 a scheme was introduced whereby scooters could be allowed on trams, provided they have a permit which can be obtained after an assessment of the scooter&#x27;s size and manoeuvrability.

Currently the Metrolink operator company consults with a group of disabled people, via TfGM&#x27;s relationship with the independent &quot;Disability Design Reference Group&quot;, on any proposed changes to the services or infrastructure.

&quot;Well-behaved&quot; dogs are allowed but must be kept on leads (with other conditions).

=== Bicycle policy ===
Metrolink does not allow full-sized bicycles on to trams but does permit the carriage of &quot;fully covered&quot; folding bicycles. The ban on non-folding bicycles was upheld in 2010, despite a campaign by cycling and green groups for the trams to be adapted to allow them. Campaigners against the policy had argued that the ban on bicycles was anomalous, as other large objects such as ironing boards and deckchairs were allowed on the trams under current rules.

===Wi-Fi===
In July 2013, the Transport for Greater Manchester Committee announced that it planned to enhance the experience of travelling on Metrolink by tapping into Manchester City Council&#x27;s grant from the UK Urban Broadband Fund and using it to provide Metrolink passengers with free Wi-Fi when on board. The scheme began with a trial on a single tram – number 3054 – connected to the FreeBeeMcr broadband network with the intention of rolling it out across the whole Metrolink network by Spring 2015. It was rolled out fleet wide in March 2015. On board Wi-Fi was later suspended indefinitely in March 2020.

==Corporate affairs==

===Ownership and structure===
Manchester Metrolink is owned by TfGM, and is currently operated and maintained by KeolisAmey Metrolink, a joint venture between Keolis and Amey, who were awarded the contract for a period of up to ten years from 15 July 2017.

Between 1992 and 1997 Metrolink was operated and maintained as a concession by Greater Manchester Metro Limited, and between 1997 and 2007 by Serco. When next tendered, a ten-year contract was awarded to the Stagecoach Group from 15 July 2007. On 1 August 2011, RATP Group bought the balance of the contract from Stagecoach.

In January 2017, the Keolis/Amey consortium was announced as the successful bidder for the operating and maintenance (O&amp;M) contract to run from 15 July 2017. Unsuccessful competing bidders were RATP, National Express and Transdev. KeolisAmey Metrolink&#x27;s contract was later extended until July 2027.

===Business trends===
The key trends in recent years for Manchester Metrolink are (years ending 31 March):


Activities in the financial year 2020/21 were severely reduced by the impact of the coronavirus pandemic; the shortfall in fare income was funded by a grant from the UK central government&#x27;s Department for Transport.

===Passenger numbers===
Detailed passenger journeys since Metrolink commenced operations in 1992 were:

Metrolink revised its method for calculating passenger boardings in 2010/11, meaning figures are not directly comparable with previous years.

A survey in 2012 revealed that 12% of people in Greater Manchester use Metrolink to travel to work, and 8% use the system every day. The system is most commonly used by 21- to 30-year-olds, and was used most markedly by residents of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury — accounting for around a third of their commuter journeys.

Passenger numbers were severely reduced due to the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, decreasing 76.7% in the year 2020/21. In the year 2021/22, passenger numbers were still significantly below the level achieved before the pandemic.

===Passenger satisfaction===
A survey in 2012 revealed that passengers who used Metrolink every day for commuting rated service levels as poor and/or unreliable, with those respondents particularly frustrated by delays and disruptions. TfGM recognised that the older vehicles in its fleet – the T68/T68As — were outdated and the cause of much disruption, and agreed to replace them with M5000s by 2014. Among those who used Metrolink less regularly, the system scored far better in the survey. A survey in 2013 by the non-departmental government body Passenger Focus found that of the five major light rail systems in the United Kingdom – Metrolink, Sheffield Supertram, Nottingham Express Transit, Midlands Metro and Blackpool tramway – Metrolink had the lowest overall satisfaction rating in the United Kingdom. Respondents were surveyed on value for money, punctuality, seating availability, tram stops and overall satisfaction. Metrolink was below average on all criteria, and 47% believed Metrolink was value for money compared to a national average of 60%.

Subsequent surveys have shown increases in passenger satisfaction. A further survey in late 2015 by watchdog Transport Focus, found that satisfaction levels had increased; 89% of passengers surveyed said they were either &#x27;very&#x27; or &#x27;fairly&#x27; satisfied with their overall journey, up from 83% in 2013, but still below the national average of 92%. It also found that 58% felt the service was value for money. The national average rating for value for money on all tram networks was 69%. The follow-up survey in 2016 found further improvements, with 90% of respondents reporting they were either &#x27;very&#x27; or &#x27;fairly&#x27; satisfied with their overall journey, compared to the national average of 93%. 62% now felt the service was value for money, against a national average still of 69%, which although improved was still the lowest ranking of the six systems covered by the survey. In early 2020, another survey was conducted, finding that 59% felt Metrolink was value for money.

===Corporate identity===

The standard corporate identity across the Metrolink system uses a pale yellow and metallic silver colour scheme, with a logotype that consists of a diamond motif formed from a pattern of repeating circles and the Metrolink name. The logo, signage and publicity use the &quot;Pantograph sans regular&quot; typeface. Tram livery features yellow at the vehicle ends with grey sides and black doors, and a pattern of circles.

The corporate identity was created in October 2008 by Hemisphere Design &amp; Marketing Consultants of Manchester, in collaboration with designer Peter Saville and the transport design agency Design Triangle. The Pantograph typeface was specially commissioned from the Dalton Maag type foundry. The design standard was applied to the Metrolink network when the new M5000 trams were introduced to the network. Hemisphere chose yellow for its high visibility and to reflect Greater Manchester&#x27;s culture of confidence and optimism.

When the Metrolink network first came into operation in 1992, it used a system-wide colour scheme and vehicle livery of aquamarine, black and grey, along with a stylised &quot;M&quot; monogram placed at an angle within a circle. This branding, along with the &quot;Metrolink&quot; brand name, was devised by Fitch RS and Design Triangle, and first revealed at a press launch in June 1988. Before this, during the planning stage, the system was known as &quot;Light Rapid Transit&quot; (LRT) and promotional material used an orange and brown identity used by Greater Manchester Transport and GM Buses.

===Public relations===
Transport planners in Greater Manchester describe Metrolink as both &quot;an icon of Greater Manchester&quot;, and &quot;an integral part of the landscape in Greater Manchester&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; describes Metrolink as &quot;Manchester&#x27;s efficient and much-loved tram system&quot;. Under the ownership of the Guardian Media Group, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; spearheaded the &quot;Get Our Metrolink Back on Track&quot; campaign in 2004–05. Under Trinity Mirror ownership, the &quot;Manchester Evening News&quot; used the Freedom of Information Act 2000 to reveal that Metrolink received over 10,000 complaints between May 2011 and May 2012.

Metrolink has had close connections with popular culture in Manchester and has taken advantage of the city&#x27;s strong associations with football culture. Metrolink has been a &quot;Football Development Partner&quot; with the Manchester Football Association since August 2010, meaning it is the association&#x27;s Official Travel Partner and supports grassroots association football in Greater Manchester by selecting a &quot;Team of the Month&quot;. In 2013, then Manchester City manager Roberto Mancini and players Joe Hart, Vincent Kompany and James Milner recorded special stop announcements to be used on Metrolink&#x27;s East Manchester Line on dates when Manchester City play at home at the City of Manchester Stadium (served by the Etihad Campus tram stop). The announcements were first used on 17 February 2013, for Manchester City&#x27;s FA Cup fifth-round tie against Leeds United

Metrolink is a sponsor of the annual Manchester Food and Drink Festival.

Metrolink has also featured in television drama. On 6 December 2010, the soap opera &quot;Coronation Street&quot; featured a storyline with an explosion which caused a crash on the Metrolink system at Weatherfield. The episode was written to celebrate the soap opera&#x27;s 50th anniversary. Although a fictitious event, at least six calls were made to GMPTE asking if services had been affected.

==Future developments==

Many speculative expansion proposals exist for new lines and stops, including the addition of tram-train technology.

===Pathfinder North===
As part of efforts to introduce tram-trains — vehicles that can operate on both light and heavy rail networks — the Greater Manchester Combined Authority (GMCA) proposed three options for initial pathfinder schemes to test the application in Greater Manchester. One of these schemes, Pathfinder North, was submitted for funding as part of the government&#x27;s City Region Sustainable Transport Settlement (CRSTS) fund. Pathfinder North proposes a new tram-train service from Oldham on Metrolink&#x27;s Oldham &amp; Rochdale line, connecting to the local heavy rail network at Rochdale railway station, and continuing on to Heywood and Bury on an existing railway no longer in regular passenger use. In July 2022 the GMCA received confirmation of initial funding to develop the pathfinder, including the purchase of up to seven new tram-train vehicles to run the service.

===HS2 integration===
As part of (now rejected) developments related to bringing High Speed 2 and Northern Powerhouse Rail to Manchester, High Speed Two Limited had proposed the present two-platform Piccadilly Metrolink stop at ground-level below the existing station platforms be relocated. A new larger four-platform stop located underground below the Manchester Piccadilly High Speed station was planned to replace it. Provision for a second ground-level Metrolink stop at the eastern end of the high speed station to service future Metrolink extensions, to be called Piccadilly Central, also formed part of the plans. At the proposed Manchester Airport High Speed station provision for a new Metrolink stop — potentially serving an extension from the existing Airport line — was also envisaged.

<text>The &quot;Xúngēn&quot; movement () is a cultural and literary movement in mainland China emphasizing local and minority cultures. It began in 1980s and was similar to the back-to-the-land movement. Its premise is that the Cultural Revolution damaged a pluralistic Chinese identity and traditions that had existed for centuries, and that the reconstruction of that identity requires a healthy appreciation of local cultures. Furthermore, the century of modernization and cultural and political iconoclasm had only severed Chinese traditions. Some of the key writers are Han Shaogong (), Mo Yan, Ah Cheng (), and Jia Pingwa ().

<text>Below is a list of mayors of [[Washington, D.C.]], and associated political entities.

== History of offices ==
The federal district of the United States was first designated by the amended Residence Act of 1790. That Act designated that the President could appoint three commissioners to locate, define and survey an area not exceeding ten miles square as the capital district, following the Constitutional mandate to do so. From 1791 to 1802 the District was managed by that three-member Board of Commissioners of the Federal City as listed below.

With the passage of the District of Columbia Organic Act of 1801, the District was brought under the direct political control of Congress. The Board of Commissioners was dissolved. That Act made no provision for an executive for the District as a whole. The District consisted of five political subdivisions: three cities with their own municipal governments, and two rural counties. The pre-existing city of Georgetown and its mayors are listed below. The pre-existing city of Alexandria, Virginia, had its own list of mayors before, during and after its inclusion in the District. And the new City of Washington was chartered shortly after the District, in 1802. Its mayors also appear below. The rural county west of the Potomac, formerly Virginia, was Alexandria County. Finally to the east and outside the cities, formerly Maryland, lay Washington County, D.C. (Both counties were governed by levy courts made of providentially appointed Justices of the Peace, whose members do not appear below. Prior to 1802, those Justices of the Peace were appointed by the governors of Maryland and Virginia, after which they were appointed by the President until they were abolished in 1871).

In 1846, Alexandria County and the City of Alexandria returned to Virginia, leaving the District with two independent cities and one county.

In 1871, with the District of Columbia Organic Act, those three subdivisions within the District were unified into a single government, whose chief executive was a territorial Governor. As listed below, only two served before this office was abolished in 1874, and replaced with a temporary three-member Board of Commissioners appointed by the President. The board was made permanent in 1878 and this system continued until 1967, when it was replaced by a single mayor-commissioner and city council appointed by the President. Finally, in 1974, the District of Columbia Home Rule Act allowed for District residents to elect their own mayor.

Currently, the Mayor of the District of Columbia is popularly elected to a four-year term with no term limits. Even though District of Columbia is not a state, the district government also has certain state-level responsibilities, making some of the mayor&#x27;s duties analogous to those of United States governors. The current mayor of the District of Columbia is Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, who has served in the role since January 2, 2015.

The lists on this page include all of the chief executives of the District of Columbia in their various forms.

===Commissioners of the Federal City (1791–1802)===
The 1790 Act for establishing the temporary and permanent seat of the Government of the United States, Act of March 3, 1791, 1 Stat. 214, set up a board of three commissioners to survey and define the territory of the Federal City, and to purchase land for development and oversee the construction of all federal buildings. Some reports name Thomas Johnson as the chairman of the Board of Commissioners, but it appears there was no chair, even if Johnson acted in the manner of a chair. The commission had very little to do with the municipal regulation of the District and when their board was dissolved their powers were transferred to the &quot;Superintendent&quot;, &quot;Commissioner to Superintend Public Buildings&quot; and the &quot;Chief Engineer of the United States Army.&quot; The local public affairs were instead governed by a Levy Court made up of Justices of the Peace who, until passage of the Organic Act of 1801 were commissioned by the governors of Virginia (for Arlington County) and Maryland (for Prince George&#x27;s and Montgomery County – the north part of the District remained part of these counties until 1801), and in the Federal city their powers were transferred to the Mayor and local government. During this time William Thornton, Robert Bowie, Daniel Carroll, and Robert Brent were some of the men who served on the Levy Court of Prince George&#x27;s County.

===Mayors of the City of Washington (1802–1871)===
The persons listed below are the mayors of the now-defunct City of Washington, which was officially granted a formal government in 1802. The Mayor of Washington had authority over city services, appointments, and local tax assessments; however, the duties of the mayor mostly consisted of requesting appropriations from Congress to finance the city. From 1802 to 1812, the mayor was appointed by the President of the United States. Between 1812 and 1820, the city&#x27;s mayors were then selected by a city council. From 1820 to 1871 the mayor was popularly elected. The present-day boundaries of the &quot;Old City&quot; were Rock Creek to the west, Florida Avenue to the north, and the Anacostia River to the east and south.

Starting in March 1801 the County of Washington, which included the city (or corporation) of Washington and the city of Georgetown, was governed by a Levy Court, of unfixed number, made up of Justices of the Peace chosen by the President. It was one of these Justice of the Peace appointments, made in the 24 hours between the passage of the Organic Act of 1801 and the end of John Adams&#x27; term that became the subject of Marbury v. Madison. In 1804, the Levy Court lost the power to tax the residents of Washington City, but in 1808 the city was required to contribute to the revenue of the county and in 1826 the Levy Court lost the power to tax those in Georgetown. An 1812 law fixed the number of judges to seven, two from east of Rock Creek but outside of Washington City, two from west of Rock Creek but outside of Georgetown and three from Georgetown, with none from Washington City until an 1848 law added four members from the city. Even when the City of Washington was not represented on the Levy Court, they were still required to contribute to the costs of the county, except for bridges and roads outside its boundaries. The court was again changed in 1863 when it was reduced to nine members, three from the city of Washington, one from Georgetown, and five from county lands outside the city. The Levy Court was disbanded in 1871 with the Mayor when congress consolidated all the remaining governments in DC. Some of the more prominent members of the Levy Court include Thomas Corcoran, John Cox, George W. Riggs, and Sayles J. Bown

===Mayors of Georgetown (1790–1871)===
From 1751 to 1789, Georgetown was governed by Commissioners who were either appointed by an act of Maryland or were elected by the other commissioners to fill vacancies. in 1790 the government was changed to include a Mayor, a Recorder, Aldermen and a Common Council. During this time it was governed by nineteen different commissioners.

Georgetown was a town in Maryland until 1801, when it became a municipality within the District of Columbia. From 1802 until 1871, mayors of Georgetown were elected to one-year terms, with no term limits. Like the City of Washington and Washington County, Georgetown&#x27;s local government ceased to exist in 1871, when Congress merged the three entities into the single District government.

===Governors of the District of Columbia (1871–1874)===
In 1871, Congress created a territorial government for the entire District of Columbia, which was headed by a governor appointed by the President of the United States to a four-year term. Due to alleged mismanagement and corruption, including allegations of contractors bribing members of the District legislature to receive contracts, the territorial government was discontinued in 1874.

===Commissioners of the District of Columbia (1874–1878)===
From 1874 to 1878 the District was administered by a three-member, temporary Board of Commissioners with both legislative and executive authority, all appointed by the President. They were assisted by an engineer (Captain Richard L. Hoxie). The law made no provision for a President to this board of temporary Commissioners, and none was ever elected, but Commissioner Dennison acted in that capacity at all board meetings he attended.

===Presidents of the Board of Commissioners (1878–1967)===
In 1878, the Board of Commissioners was made permanent and re-organized. From 1878 to 1967, the District was administered by this new three-member Board of Commissioners with both legislative and executive authority, all appointed by the President. The board comprised one Democrat, one Republican, and one civil engineer with no specified party. The three Commissioners would then elect one of their number to serve as president of the board. While not quite analogous to the role of a mayor, the president of the board was the district&#x27;s Chief Executive.

===Mayor-Commissioner (1967–1975)===
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson presented to Congress a plan to reorganize the District&#x27;s government. The three-commissioner system was replaced by a government headed by a single mayor-commissioner, an assistant mayor-commissioner, and a nine-member district council, all appointed by the president. The mayor-commissioner and his assistant served four-year terms, while the councilmembers served three-year terms. While the council was officially nonpartisan, no more than six of Councilmembers could be of the same political party. Councilmembers were expected to work part-time. All councilmembers and either the mayor-commissioner or his assistant was required to have been a resident of the District of Columbia for the three years preceding appointment. All must be District residents while serving their terms in office.

Council members had the quasi-legislative powers of the former Board of Commissioners, approving the budget and setting real estate tax rates. The mayor-commissioner could, without any Congressional approval, consolidate District agencies and transfer money between agencies, powers that the preceding Board of Commissioners had not possessed since 1952. The mayor-commissioner could veto the actions of the council, but the council could override the veto with a three-fourths vote.

Despite a push by many Republicans and conservative Democrats in the House of Representatives to reject Johnson&#x27;s plan, the House of Representatives accepted the new form of government for the District by a vote of 244 to 160. Johnson said that the new District government would be more effective and efficient.

Walter E. Washington was appointed the first mayor-commissioner, and Thomas W. Fletcher was appointed the first assistant mayor-commissioner. The first Council appointments were Chairman John W. Hechinger, Vice Chairman Walter E. Fauntroy, Stanley J. Anderson, Margaret A. Haywood, John A. Nevius, William S. Thompson, J.C. Turner, Polly Shackleton, and Joseph P. Yeldell.

===Mayors of the District of Columbia (1975–present)===

Since 1975, the District has been administered by a popularly elected mayor and district council.

<text>Franz Lehár ( ; ; 30 April 1870 – 24 October 1948) was an Austro-Hungarian composer. He is mainly known for his operettas, of which the most successful and best known is &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (&quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot;).

==Life and career==

Lehár was born in the northern part of Komárom, Kingdom of Hungary (now Komárno, Slovakia), the eldest son of Franz Lehar Sr. (1838–1898), an Austrian bandmaster in the Infantry Regiment No. 50 of the Austro-Hungarian Army and Christine Neubrandt (1849–1906), a Hungarian woman from a family of German descent. He grew up speaking only Hungarian until the age of 12. He later put an acute accent above the &quot;a&quot; of his father&#x27;s surname &quot;Lehar&quot; to indicate the pronunciation of the vowel as , in accordance with Hungarian orthography.

While his younger brother Anton entered cadet school in Vienna to become a professional officer, Franz studied violin at the Prague Conservatory, where his violin teacher was Antonín Bennewitz, but was advised by Antonín Dvořák to focus on composition. However, the Conservatory&#x27;s rules at that time did not allow students to study both performance and composition, and Bennewitz and Lehár senior exerted pressure on Lehár to take his degree in violin as a practical matter, arguing that he could study composition on his own later. Lehár followed their wishes, against his will, and aside from a few clandestine lessons with Zdeněk Fibich he was self-taught as a composer. After graduation in 1888 he joined his father&#x27;s band in Vienna, as assistant bandmaster. Two years later he became bandmaster at Losonc (today Lučenec, Slovakia), making him the youngest bandmaster in the Austro-Hungarian Army at that time, but he left the army and joined the navy. With the navy he was first Kapellmeister at Pola (Pula) from 1894 to 1896, resigning in the later year when his first opera, &quot;Kukuschka&quot; (reworked as &quot;Tatjana&quot; in 1906), premiered in Leipzig. It was only a middling success and Lehár eventually rejoined the army, with service in the garrisons at Trieste, Budapest (1898) and finally Vienna from 1899 to 1902. In 1902 he became conductor at the historic Vienna Theater an der Wien, where his operetta &quot;Wiener Frauen&quot; was performed in November of that year.

He is most famous for his operettas – the most successful of which is &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; (&quot;Die lustige Witwe&quot;) – but he also wrote sonatas, symphonic poems and marches. He also composed a number of waltzes (the most popular being &quot;Gold und Silber&quot;, composed for Princess Pauline von Metternich&#x27;s &quot;Gold and Silver&quot; Ball, January 1902), some of which were drawn from his famous operettas. Individual songs from some of the operettas have become standards, notably &quot;Vilja&quot; from &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; and &quot;You Are My Heart&#x27;s Delight&quot; (&quot;Dein ist mein ganzes Herz&quot;) from &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; (&quot;Das Land des Lächelns&quot;). His most ambitious work, &quot;Giuditta&quot; in 1934 is closer to opera than to operetta. It contains the ever popular &quot;Meine Lippen, sie küssen so heiß&quot; (&quot;My lips, they kiss so hot&quot;).

Lehár was also associated with the operatic tenor Richard Tauber, who sang in many of his operettas, beginning with a revival of his 1910 operetta &quot;Zigeunerliebe&quot; in 1920 and then in 1922, in which Lehár once again found a suitable post-war style. Lehár made a brief appearance in the 1930 film adaptation &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; starring Tauber. Between 1925 and 1934 he wrote six operettas specifically for Tauber&#x27;s voice. By 1935 he decided to form his own publishing house, Glocken-Verlag (Publishing House of the Bells), to maximize his personal control over performance rights to his works.

===Lehár and the Third Reich===
Lehár&#x27;s relationship with the Nazi regime was an uneasy one. He had always used Jewish librettists for his operas and had been part of the cultural milieu in Vienna which included a significant Jewish contingent. Further, although Lehár was Roman Catholic, his wife, Sophie (née Paschkis) had been Jewish before her conversion to Catholicism upon marriage, and this was sufficient to generate hostility towards them personally and towards his work. Hitler enjoyed Lehár&#x27;s music, and hostility diminished across Germany after Joseph Goebbels&#x27; intervention on Lehár&#x27;s part. In 1938 Mrs. Lehár was given the status of &quot;Ehrenarierin&quot; (honorary Aryan by marriage). Nonetheless, attempts were made at least once to have her deported. The Nazi regime was aware of the uses of Lehár&#x27;s music for propaganda purposes: concerts of his music were given in occupied Paris in 1941. Even so, Lehár&#x27;s influence was limited. It is alleged that he tried personally to secure Hitler&#x27;s guarantee of the safety of one of his librettists, Fritz Löhner-Beda, but he was not able to prevent the murder of Beda in Auschwitz-III. He also tried to prevent the arrest of Louis Treumann, the first Danilo in &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;, but the 70-year old Treumann and his wife Stefanie were sent to Theresienstadt concentration camp on 28 July 1942, where Stefanie died in September of that year and Louis died on 5 March 1943.

On 12 January 1939 and 30 April 1940, Lehár personally received awards from Hitler in Berlin and Vienna, including the Goethe Medal. On Hitler&#x27;s birthday in 1938, Lehár had given him as a special gift a red Morocco leather volume in commemoration of the 50th performance of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

===Later years===

He died aged 78 in 1948 in Bad Ischl, near Salzburg, and was buried there. His younger brother Anton became the administrator of his estate, promoting the popularity of Franz Lehár&#x27;s music.

==Honours==
* He was elected an honorary citizen of Sopron in 1940.
* In 1940 Hitler awarded him the Goethe-Medaille für Kunst und Wissenschaft.
* There is a street in Vienna named after him. Additionally, several towns in the Netherlands have named streets after him (e.g. in The Hague, Leidsche Rijn, Utrecht, Eindhoven and Tilburg). Also, there are streets in Sarajevo and Pula named after him, and in Prague as well.
* Asteroid 85317 Lehár, discovered by German astronomer Freimut Börngen in 1995, was named in his memory. The official was published by the Minor Planet Center on 23 May 2005 ().

==Stage works==
==Lehár recording==
In 1908, the German branch of The Gramophone Company Ltd (afterwards HMV) issued twelve extracts (mostly ensembles) from Lehár&#x27;s latest operetta, &quot;Der Mann mit den drei Frauen&quot;, with the composer conducting. The singers included Mizzi Günther, Louise Kartousch and Ludwig Herold.

In 1929 and 1934, Lehár had conducted for Odeon Records &quot;The Land of Smiles&quot; and &quot;Giuditta&quot;, starring Richard Tauber, Vera Schwarz and Jarmila Novotná. A 1942 Vienna broadcast of his operetta &quot;Paganini&quot; conducted by the composer has survived, starring soprano, Esther Réthy and tenor, Karl Friedrich. A 1942 Berlin radio production of &quot;Zigeunerliebe&quot; with Herbert Ernst Groh, conducted by Lehár, also survives.

In 1947, Lehár conducted the Tonhalle-Orchester Zürich in a series of 78-rpm recordings for English Decca (released in the U.S. by London Records) of overtures and waltzes from his operettas. The recordings had remarkable sound for their time because they were made using Decca&#x27;s Full Frequency Range Recording process, one of the first commercial high fidelity techniques. These recordings were later issued on LP (in 1969 on Decca eclipse ECM 2012 and reprocessed stereo on ECS 2012) and CD. A compilation of his recordings has been released by Naxos Records.

Following the collapse of the Berlin Wall, a set of discs recording the 1939 Saarbrücken concert of Lehár&#x27;s works by German State Transmitter Saarbrücken conducted by Franz Lehár himself was discovered in East German state archives. This was released on CDs by Classic Produktion Osnabrück in 2000.

==Anecdotes==

Gustav Mahler and his young wife Alma went to see Lehár&#x27;s &quot;The Merry Widow&quot; in Vienna and loved it so much that they danced to its tunes as soon as they were home. From memory they played the waltz on the piano, but could not remember the exact run of one passage. The next day they went to Vienna&#x27;s main music shop , but hesitated to admit that they were looking for the score of what would be considered a &quot;popular&quot; operetta. While Mahler distracted the staff by questioning them about the sales of his own compositions, Alma browsed through the music score of &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;. As soon as they were out on the street, Alma sang the complete waltz to Mahler.

<text>Marion Shepilov Barry (born Marion Barry Jr.; March 6, 1936 – November 23, 2014) was an American politician who served as mayor of the District of Columbia from 1979 to 1991 and 1995 to 1999. A Democrat, Barry had served three tenures on the Council of the District of Columbia, representing as an at-large member from 1975 to 1979, in Ward 8 from 1993 to 1995, and again from 2005 to 2014.

In the 1960s, he was involved in the civil rights movement, first as a member of the Nashville Student Movement and then serving as the first chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Barry came to national prominence as mayor of the national capital, the first prominent civil rights activist to become chief executive of a major American city. He gave the presidential nomination speech for Jesse Jackson at the 1984 Democratic National Convention. His celebrity was transformed into international notoriety in January 1990, when he was videotaped during a sting operation smoking crack cocaine and was arrested by Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) officials on drug charges. The arrest and subsequent trial precluded Barry from seeking re-election, and he served six months in a federal prison. After his release, he was elected to the Council of the District of Columbia in 1992. He was elected again as mayor in 1994, serving from 1995 to 1999.

Despite his history of political and legal controversies, Barry was a popular and influential figure in Washington, D.C. The alternative weekly &quot;Washington City Paper&quot; nicknamed him &quot;Mayor for life&quot;, a designation that remained long after Barry left the mayoralty. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; once stated that &quot;to understand the District of Columbia, one must understand Marion Barry&quot;.

==Early life==
Marion Barry was born in rural Itta Bena, Mississippi, the third child of Mattie Cummings and Marion Barry. His father died when he was four years old, and a year later his mother moved the family to Memphis, Tennessee, where her employment prospects were better. His mother married David Cummings, a butcher, and together they raised eight children. Growing up on Latham Street near South Parkway, Marion Barry attended Florida Elementary and graduated from Booker T. Washington High.

The first time Barry noticed racial issues was when he had to walk to school while the white students were assigned a school bus to ride. The schools were segregated, as were public facilities. He had a number of jobs as a child, including picking cotton, delivering and selling newspapers, and bagging groceries. While in high school, Barry worked as a waiter at the American Legion post and, at age 17, earned the rank of Eagle Scout.

Marion Barry first began his civil rights activism when he was a paperboy in Memphis. The paper he worked for organized a contest in which any boys who gained 15 new customers could win a trip to New Orleans. Barry and a couple of the other black paperboys reached the quota of 15 new customers yet were not allowed to go on the trip to New Orleans, a segregated city. The paper said it could not afford to hire two buses to satisfy Mississippi&#x27;s segregation rules. Barry decided to boycott his paper route until they agreed to send the black paperboys on a trip. After the paper offered the black paperboys a chance to go to St. Louis, Missouri, on a trip, because it was not a segregated city, Barry resumed his paper route.

==1955–1970: Education and civil rights activism==

===Undergraduate studies at LeMoyne-Owen College ===
Barry attended LeMoyne–Owen College, in Memphis, graduating in 1958. In his junior year, the racial injustices he had seen started to come together. He and his friends went to a segregated fairground in Memphis, and went at a time reserved for whites, because they wanted to see the science exhibit. When they were close to the exhibit, a policeman stopped them and asked them to leave. Barry and his friends left without protest. At that time, Barry did not know much about his race, or why they were treated poorly, but he resented the incident. Barry became more active in the NAACP chapter at LeMoyne-Owens, serving as president. It is sometimes said that his ardent support of the civil rights movement earned him the nickname &quot;Shep&quot;, in reference to Soviet politician Dmitri Shepilov, and then Barry began using Shepilov as his middle name. But Barry stated in his autobiography that he chose the name with regard to his middle initial S, which had initially stood for nothing, after having found Shepilov&#x27;s name in newspapers: &quot;I had picked out &#x27;Shepilov&#x27; as a middle name because it was the only one that I knew and liked.&quot;

In 1958, at LeMoyne-Owens, he criticized a college trustee for remarks he felt were demeaning to African Americans, for which he was nearly expelled. While a senior and the president of the NAACP chapter, Barry heard of Walter Chandler—the only white member on LeMoyne-Owen&#x27;s board of trustees—making comments that black people should be treated as a &quot;younger brother not as an adult&quot;. Barry wrote a letter to LeMoyne&#x27;s president objecting to the comments and asking if Walter Chandler could be removed from the board. A friend of Barry&#x27;s was the editor of the school newspaper, the &quot;Magician&quot;, and told Barry to run the letter in the paper. From there, the letter made it to the front page of Memphis&#x27; conservative morning paper.

===Master&#x27;s degree, Nashville Student Movement, SNCC===
Barry earned an M.S. in organic chemistry from Fisk University in 1960. He was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha fraternity. While in graduate school at Fisk, Barry was arrested several times while participating in the Nashville sit-ins to desegregate lunch counters and other Civil Rights Movement events. After graduating from Fisk, Barry continued to work in the Civil Rights Movement, focusing on the elimination of the racial segregation of bus passengers.

In 1960, Barry was elected as the first chairman of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). He helped develop an organizing project in McComb, Mississippi. The project was both a voter registration and a direct action endeavor. Barry said he and other activists lived with the local people in order to stay safe, as well as to learn what it was like to live there. They could use that information to organize the members of the SNCC accordingly.

===Doctoral studies===
Barry began doctoral studies at the University of Kansas, but soon quit the program. He contemplated law school to help with his activism, but decided against it, because the delayed admission would mean that he would have to take a year off from school. Had he taken a year off, there was a chance of his being drafted into the military, and he did not want to be drafted.

He decided to go to the University of Tennessee where he was awarded a graduate fellowship. Despite being located in the South, the University of Tennessee was an integrated educational institution, a new experience for Barry. He began doctoral chemistry studies at the University of Tennessee in Knoxville, the only African American in the program. He learned that he was prohibited from tutoring white children, and his wife Blantie Evans was not allowed to work at the white school. He quit the program in favor of his new duties at SNCC.

In the spring of 1964, he attended a conference in Nashville and became one of the founders of the Southern Student Organizing Committee (SSOC).

===Working for SNCC===
As head of SNCC, Barry led protests against racial segregation and discrimination. After he left McComb, Barry lobbied the state legislatures to try to convince them to vote to make the Mississippi Freedom Democratic Party (MFDP) the recognized Democratic party of Mississippi in the 1964 Democratic National Convention. In a protest of their continuing disenfranchisement, African Americans had organized this party to prove that blacks wanted to vote and conducted a trial election. Barry slept on the boardwalk in Atlantic City the night after speaking to the New Jersey Legislature.

After he left the New York legislature, James Forman asked Barry to go to Washington, D.C. to manage SNCC&#x27;s office. At the time, over half of the population of the District of Columbia was black; however, the District of Columbia was administered as a special federal district, not as a state, and therefore did not have voting representation in Congress.

In 1965, Barry and Evans moved to Washington, D.C., to open a local chapter of SNCC. He was deeply involved in coordinating peaceful street demonstrations as well as a boycott to protest bus fare increases. Barry organized rides to work for those who needed them. The boycott cost the bus line thousands of dollars, and Barry proved his ability to organize.

He also served as the leader of the Free D.C. Movement, strongly supporting increased home rule, as a Congressional committee exercised administrative rule over the district. Barry quit SNCC in 1967, when H. Rap Brown became chairman of the group. In 1967, Barry and Mary Treadwell co-founded Pride, Inc., a Department of Labor-funded program to provide job training to unemployed black men. The group employed hundreds of teenagers to clean littered streets and alleys in the district. Barry and Treadwell had met while students at Fisk University, and they later met again while picketing in front of the Washington Gas Light Company.

Barry and Treadwell married in 1972. They separated five years later.

Barry was active in the aftermath of the 1968 Washington, D.C., riots that followed the assassination of Martin Luther King Jr. in Memphis. He organized through Pride Inc. a program of free food distribution for poor black residents whose homes and neighborhoods had been destroyed in the rioting. Barry convinced the Giant Food supermarket chain to donate food, and he spent a week driving trucks and delivering food throughout the city&#x27;s housing projects. He also became a board member of the city&#x27;s Economic Development Committee, helping to route federal funds and venture capital to black-owned businesses that were struggling to recover from the riots.

When President Richard Nixon declared July 21, 1969, National Day of Participation in honor of the Moon landing by Apollo 11, Barry criticized him. Barry believed that Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. deserved a national honor day on his birthday, which Nixon had opposed. Said Barry, &quot;Why should blacks feel elated when we see men eating on the moon when millions of blacks and poor whites don&#x27;t have enough money to buy food here on earth?&quot;

==1971–1974: D.C. Board of Education==
In 1971, Barry announced his candidacy for at-large member of the school board, running against the incumbent, Anita L. Allen. Barry said he wanted to steer the school board back to the &quot;issues of education&quot; and away from problems of personalities. Barry defeated Allen, with 58 percent of the vote to Allen&#x27;s 34 percent.

After Barry was seated in 1972, he was unanimously elected as president of the board. He served as board president for two years, reorganizing the school system&#x27;s finances and building consensus on the board.

In response to the 1972 blaxploitation film &quot;Super Fly&quot;, Barry quickly formed a protest group named Blacks Against Narcotics and Genocide (BANG). Barry said the film was harmful to black youth, and that it glorified drug abuse. BANG called for a boycott of the film.

Barry advocated for a larger budget for education and raises for teachers. Barry also supported the appointment of Barbara Sizemore as the district&#x27;s superintendent, making of the District of Columbia the country&#x27;s first major urban area with a woman as School Board Superintendent.

When the Senate held up annual payments to the district because of debate over whether the federal government should continue to pay for holding the district&#x27;s partisan elections, Barry called for public hearings on the matter. He also commented, &quot;Since it is a known fact that the majority makeup of an elected government will be black, the conferees&#x27; agreement indicates to me that some members of Congress are saying that black people cannot be fiscally responsible, and therefore, have to have a predominantly white Congress overseeing how our monies are spent.&quot;

==1974–1979: D.C. Council and shooting==
Upon establishment of the District of Columbia home rule in 1974, Barry was elected an at-large member of Washington&#x27;s first elected city council. In that position, he served as chair of the District of Columbia Committee on Finance and Revenue. He was re-elected in 1976.

While serving on the Council of the District of Columbia, Barry was shot accidentally on March 9, 1977, by radical Hanafi Muslims (a breakaway sect of the Nation of Islam) when they overran the District Building. Barry was shot near his heart during the two-day 1977 Hanafi Siege in which hostages were held by the terrorists. This was finally defused by the FBI and Muslim ambassadors. Barry recovered from his injury.

===1978 mayoral election===

Having credentials as an activist, legislator, and as a &quot;hero&quot; in a hostage crisis, as well as an early endorsement from &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Barry ran for mayor in 1978 after Walter Washington, the district&#x27;s first mayor, fell out of political favor.

In the Democratic primary, the real contest in the heavily Democratic, black-majority city, Barry ran with the campaign slogan &quot;Take a Stand&quot; and the promise to improve the &quot;bumbling and bungling&quot; District of Columbia administration. He won the Democratic primary election against his main rivals Mayor Washington and council chairman Sterling Tucker. The vote was so close that final tally was in doubt for over two weeks. Ultimately, Barry narrowly won the nomination, with Washington relegated to third place. Barry defeated his Republican opponent Arthur Fletcher and two other minor candidates in a landslide general election in November. He took office in January 1979 as the city&#x27;s second popularly elected mayor since the restoration of home rule in 1973.

==1979–1991: Mayor of the District of Columbia==

===First term===
Barry&#x27;s first four years in office were characterized by increased efficiency in city administration and government services, in particular the sanitation department. Barry also instituted his signature summer jobs program, in which summer employment was made available to every school-age resident. At the same time, Barry straightened the city&#x27;s chaotic finances and attacked the deficit by introducing spending controls and laying off ten percent of the city&#x27;s workforce. Each year of his first term saw a budget surplus of at least US$13 million. District of Columbia political reporter Jonetta Rose Barras characterized the first Barry administration as &quot;methodical, competent, and intellectually superior.&quot;

However, unemployment rose dramatically during Barry&#x27;s first administration, as did crime rates, in part because many of his layoffs were centered in the police department (1,500 terminations by 1981). His campaign promise to &quot;take the boards off&quot; public housing—&quot;i.e.&quot;, to rehabilitate dilapidated and condemned public housing units—was slow in fulfillment. The city&#x27;s debt was a constant problem as well: Barry had recalculated the Washington Administration&#x27;s claim of a $41 million surplus and found that the city was $285 million in debt, a long-term accrual that his annual surpluses were unable to surmount by the end of his term. Graft and embezzlement among Barry appointees, such as Employment Services director Ivanhoe Donaldson, began late in Barry&#x27;s first term, although it would not be discovered for several years. Barry was personally touched by a number of &quot;mini-scandals&quot;. He had travels with finances he often kept secret. He was first reported to be using cocaine at downtown nightclubs.

===Second term===
In 1982, Barry faced re-election against a challenge from fellow Democrat Patricia Roberts Harris, an African-American woman who had served in two cabinet positions under President Jimmy Carter, as well as from council members John L. Ray and Charlene Drew Jarvis. In the primary election held September 14, 1982, Barry won with over 58% of the vote. He won 82% of the vote in the November 11 general election against Republican candidate E. Brooke Lee.

Barry&#x27;s second term was more troublesome than his first. Though Washington experienced a massive real estate boom that helped alleviate the city&#x27;s fiscal problems for a time, government spending skyrocketed; the administration posted a fifth straight budget surplus, but the next year struggled with a $110 million deficit. Much of the disparity was caused by Barry&#x27;s policy of combating unemployment by creating government jobs; the city government&#x27;s payrolls swelled so greatly that by 1986, nobody in the administration knew exactly how many employees it had.

In his first term, Barry had made a point of insisting that any firm wishing to do business with the city have minority partners, and shepherding legislation requiring 35% of all contracts to go to minority-owned firms. The policy was modified in his second term such that the administration gave contracts to Barry&#x27;s political connections and high-end campaign contributors to the tune of $856 million. The city did not exercise sufficient oversight. The cost of services such as heating oil for the public schools inflated 40 percent, without any guarantee that the goods and services were being provided. City councilman John A. Wilson commented that &quot;What started out to benefit the minority community at large has meant some politically influential blacks can move out to posh suburbs.&quot;

Several of his associates were indicted for financial malfeasance, including former administration officials Ivanhoe Donaldson and Alphonse G. Hill. Barry began to be plagued by rumors and press reports of womanizing and of alcohol and drug abuse; in particular, stories abounded of his cocaine use in the city&#x27;s nightclubs and red-light district. In 1983, Barry&#x27;s ex-wife, Mary Treadwell, was convicted of fraudulently using federal funds given to Pride, Inc., a group that helped local youth find employment. In 1984, Barry&#x27;s one-time lover Karen Johnson was convicted of cocaine possession and contempt of court for refusing to testify to a grand jury about Barry&#x27;s drug use. Barry&#x27;s second four years in office had some high points, including the District&#x27;s entry into the open bond market with Wall Street&#x27;s highest credit rating, and Barry&#x27;s nomination speech for Jesse Jackson at the 1984 Democratic Convention.

===Third term===
Barry sought a third term as mayor in 1986. By this time, his dominance of city politics was so absolute that he faced only token opposition in the Democratic primary in the form of former school board member Mattie Taylor, whom Barry dispatched rather easily. Barry had expected to face Jesse Jackson, who had been encouraged by colleagues to seek the mayoralty, and who had been relatively popular in stark contrast to Barry&#x27;s declining reputation. Barry, who knew that most of Jackson&#x27;s income came from delivering speeches, used his political clout to arbitrarily disqualify Jackson by getting a law passed that said anyone who made more than a certain amount in honoraria was ineligible to run for D.C. office. Council members jokingly called this the &quot;Jesse Jackson law,&quot; as it was legislated expressly to keep Jackson out of the mayoral race. As expected, Barry defeated Republican city councilwoman Carol Schwartz fairly handily in the November 4 general election. However, Schwartz managed to win 33 percent of the vote—the first time a Republican had crossed the 30-percent barrier in a general election. For the third time, Barry received the endorsement of &quot;The Washington Post&quot; but &quot;with far greater reservations and misgivings&quot; than at any time in the past.

By this time, Barry was openly suffering from the effects of longstanding addictions to cocaine and alcohol; he would later admit that he lost control of his drug habit soon after being sworn in for a third term. His public appearances were marked by his glassy eyes and slurred speech. His aides began scheduling all of his daily events later and later in the day as he was arriving to work as late as lunchtime, and nodding off to sleep at his desk. His ability to function as mayor had become so impaired that even his closest associates urged him not to run again. They tried to create an endowed professorship for him at the University of the District of Columbia. In the wake of Barry&#x27;s inattention, the city declined badly. Barry was watching Super Bowl XXI in Pasadena, California when a winter blizzard struck Washington in January 1987; city crews were accused of badly mishandling the road clearing, adversely affecting local businesses.

In 1987, crack use exploded in the city, as did territorial wars among drug dealers; in 1988 there were 369 homicides in the District of Columbia, the most ever in the city. That record was broken when the next year had 434 homicides, and it was broken again in 1990 with 474 homicides, making the District of Columbia&#x27;s murder rate the highest in the nation. The District of Columbia government&#x27;s employment and deficits grew as city services suffered; in particular, there were frequent press reports of deaths occurring because police lacked cars to get to crime scenes, and EMS services responded slowly or went to the wrong address.

===1990 arrest and drug conviction===
By late 1989, federal officials had been investigating Barry on suspicion of illegal drug possession and use; that fall, they prosecuted several of Barry&#x27;s associates for cocaine use, including Charles Lewis, a native of the United States Virgin Islands. He was implicated in a drug investigation involving Barry and a room at Washington&#x27;s Ramada Inn in December 1988.

On January 18, 1990, Barry was arrested with a former girlfriend, Hazel Diane &quot;Rasheeda&quot; Moore, in a sting operation at the Vista International Hotel by the FBI and D.C. police for crack cocaine use and possession. Moore was an FBI informant when she invited Barry to the hotel room and insisted that he smoke freebase cocaine before they had sex, while agents in another room watched on camera, waiting for Barry to accept her offer. During the videotaped arrest, Barry says of Moore, &quot;Bitch set me up ... I shouldn&#x27;t have come up here ... goddamn bitch&quot;.

Barry was charged with three felony counts of perjury, 10 counts of drug possession, and one misdemeanor count of conspiracy to possess cocaine, even though the cocaine belonged to the government informant. The criminal trial ended in August 1990 with a conviction for only one possession incident, which had occurred in November 1989, and an acquittal on another. The jury deadlocked on the remaining charges. Six or seven jurors (of whom two were white and the rest black) believed that the evidence against Barry was overwhelming and that he had displayed &quot;arrogance&quot; during the trial. Against these, five black jurors were convinced that the prosecution had falsified evidence and testimony as part of a racist conspiracy against Barry, and even disputed factual findings that had not been contested in court. After scolding the jurors for not following his instructions, presiding judge Thomas Penfield Jackson declared a mistrial on the remaining charges.

As a result of his arrest and the ensuing trial, Barry decided in June 1990 not to seek re-election as mayor. After his arrest and through his trial, Barry continued as mayor. He even ran as an independent for an at-large seat on the council against 74-year-old incumbent Hilda Mason. Mason, a former ally who had helped Barry recuperate after the 1977 shooting, took the challenge personally, saying, &quot;I do feel very disappointed in my grandson Marion Barry.&quot; Mason was endorsed by a majority of the council members and by Jesse Jackson, who was running for shadow senator.

Barry was sentenced to six months in federal prison shortly before the November election, which he lost—the first and only electoral loss of his career—receiving 20 percent of the overall vote, but doing well among the voters of Ward 8. His wife and son moved out of the house later that month.
In October 1991, Barry surrendered himself at a correctional facility in Petersburg, Virginia. While serving his time, Barry was accused of letting a woman perform oral sex on him in a prison waiting room, a charge Barry denied. Barry was transferred to another federal prison in Loretto, Pennsylvania. Barry was released in April 1992.

In May 2013, after Toronto mayor Rob Ford was videotaped smoking what was reported to be crack, parallels were made with the similarity to the 1990 incident. Barry denied any similarity, stating: &quot;Unless he was entrapped by the government, it&#x27;s not similar.&quot;

==1992–1994: Political comeback==

===D.C. Council===
Barry was released from prison in 1992, and two months later filed papers to run for the Ward 8 city council seat in that year&#x27;s election. Barry ran under the slogan &quot;He May Not Be Perfect, But He&#x27;s Perfect for D.C.&quot; He defeated the four-term incumbent, Wilhelmina Rolark, in the Democratic primary, winning 70 percent of the vote, saying he was &quot;not interested in being mayor&quot;, and went on to win the general election easily.

===1994 mayoral election===

Despite his earlier statements to the contrary, observers of Barry&#x27;s council victory expressed beliefs that he was laying ground for a mayoral run in 1994. Indeed, Barry fulfilled expectations when he formally announced his candidacy for mayor on May 21, 1994, and was immediately regarded as a serious challenge to the unpopular incumbent mayor, Sharon Pratt Kelly. Despite much opposition, including an abortive effort to recall his 1992 council election, Barry won a three-way Democratic primary contest for mayor with 48% of the vote on September 13, pushing Kelly into last place. The victory, coming after Barry&#x27;s videotaped crack use and conviction shocked the nation, carried front-page headlines in newspapers such as the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; and &quot;Boston Globe&quot;.

An oft-repeated Barry quote came in the aftermath of his victory in the Democratic primary election, in which he counseled those voters who opposed his mayoral campaign to &quot;get over it.&quot;

Though facing a credible challenge from Republican councilmember Carol Schwartz, who received the endorsement of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Barry was victorious in the general election with 56% to Schwartz&#x27;s 42% of the vote. Not only was this easily the strongest showing by a Republican mayoral candidate since the restoration of home rule, but it was also the first time since then that a Democratic candidate for mayor had dropped below the 60 percent mark. It would not occur again until Muriel Bowser won the 2014 general election with 54% of the vote.

==1995–1999: D.C. Mayor fourth term==

Barry was sworn into office on January 2, 1995, and was almost immediately confronted with a financial crisis. The budgetary problems of his previous administrations had only increased during Kelly&#x27;s term, with city officials estimating a fiscal 1996 deficit between $700 million and $1 billion. In addition, city services remained extremely dysfunctional due to mismanagement. One month into his term, Barry declared that the city government was &quot;unworkable&quot; in its present state and lobbied Congress to take over the areas of its operation that were analogous to typical state government functions. Wall Street, which Barry had convinced just after his election to continue investing in municipal bonds, reduced the city&#x27;s credit rating to &quot;junk status.&quot; Instead of implementing Barry&#x27;s proposals, the newly Republican Congress (who had come to power on promises of decreasing federal spending) placed several city operations into receivership and created the District of Columbia Financial Control Board to assume complete authority over the city&#x27;s day-to-day spending and finances, including overrule of the mayor&#x27;s fiscal decisions.

The next two years were dominated by budgetary and policy battles between Barry and the control board—along with Chief Financial Officer Anthony A. Williams—for power over the District of Columbia&#x27;s operation. The conflict was ultimately settled when in 1997 the Clinton Administration and Senator Lauch Faircloth agreed on legislation that rescued the city from its financial crisis but stripped Barry of all authority (including hiring and firing) over nine district agencies, making them directly answerable to the control board. Barry was left with control of only the Department of Parks and Recreation, the public libraries, and the Board of Tourism, as well as the ceremonial trappings of his office—a condition he characterized &quot;a rape of democracy&quot;.

Barry declined to run for a fifth term in office in June 1998, stating his belief that Congress would not restore full home rule while he was mayor. He was succeeded by city CFO Anthony A. Williams.
==2000–2014: D.C. Council==
After leaving office, Barry performed consulting work for an investment banking firm. On March 6, 2002, Barry declared his intention to challenge at-large council member Phil Mendelson in the Democratic primary. Within a month, he decided against running, after an incident in which U.S. Park Police found traces of marijuana and cocaine in his car.

On June 12, 2004, Barry announced that he was running in the Democratic primary for the Ward 8 council seat, a position he held before becoming mayor. Barry received 58% of the vote, defeating the incumbent council member, Sandy Allen, on September 14, 2004. Barry received 95% of the vote in the general election, giving him a victory in the race to represent Ward 8 in the council.

During the 2006 mayoral election, Barry endorsed Adrian Fenty despite Linda Cropp hiring many members of Barry&#x27;s former political machine. Barry had publicly clashed with Fenty over D.C. United&#x27;s proposed soccer stadium in Barry&#x27;s Ward 8. Barry was the stadium&#x27;s most outspoken supporter on the council, whereas Fenty attempted to distance himself from his initial support for the project.

In July 2007, Marion Barry was chosen as one of fifty wax statues to debut in the Washington D.C. franchise of Madame Tussauds Wax Museum. Barry was chosen by a majority of Washington residents and tourists from Tussauds&#x27; &quot;Top 10 Wish List,&quot; in a contest that pitted him against Cal Ripken Jr., Al Gore, Denzel Washington, Carl Bernstein, Halle Berry, Martin Sheen, Marilyn Monroe, Nancy Reagan and Oprah Winfrey.

Barry ran for re-election in 2008 and easily held off all five challengers in the Democratic primary: Ahmad Braxton-Jones, Howard Brown, Chanda McMahan, Sandra Seegars and Charles Wilson. No Republican or Statehood Green candidates filed to run in the Ward 8 council race.

===Vote on gay marriage===

In May 2009, Barry voted against a bill committing Washington, D.C. to recognize same-sex marriages performed elsewhere. During his 2008 reelection campaign, Barry had told members of the Gertrude Stein Democratic Club, the city&#x27;s largest LGBT political group, &quot;I don&#x27;t think you should make [supporting the bill] a litmus test. But if a bill like that were to come up, I would vote for it.&quot; Following his May 2009 vote against recognizing gay marriages, Barry was criticized for what activists believed to be an apparent flip-flop. Councilman Phil Mendelson said he was surprised by the vote because Barry had signed on as a co-introducer of the marriage bill. Barry said his position had not changed and warned that the council needed to move slowly on this issue. Citing his belief that the local African-American community was overwhelmingly opposed to gay marriage, &quot;All hell is going to break loose&quot;, Barry said. &quot;We may have a civil war. The black community is just adamant against this.&quot;

===Legal problems===

====Failures to file tax returns and pay taxes====
On October 28, 2005, Barry pleaded guilty to the misdemeanor charges stemming from an IRS investigation. The mandatory drug testing for the hearing showed Barry as being positive for cocaine and marijuana. On March 9, 2006, he was sentenced to three years&#x27; probation for misdemeanor charges of failing to pay federal and local taxes, and underwent drug counseling.

In 2007, federal prosecutors sought to have his probation revoked for failure to file his 2005 tax return. U.S. Magistrate Judge Deborah Robinson refused, saying that prosecutors had not proved that the failure was willful, even if Barry was aware he had missed the deadline. According to Judge Robinson, sentencing Barry to jail without proving that he willfully failed to file his taxes would contradict precedent set by the United States Supreme Court.
On February 9, 2009, prosecutors filed a motion in federal court to revoke Barry&#x27;s probation for not filing his 2007 tax return, which violated his probation. According to one prosecutor, Barry had not filed his taxes eight of the last nine years. Barry said the reason he did not file his taxes was because of distractions from his medical problems, although he noted that there is &quot;no excuse&quot; for not filing. In an interview, Barry said he had been undergoing four-hour dialyses three times a week as treatment for a problem with his kidney. At that point, a kidney donor had been identified, but the operation had yet to be scheduled. On February 17, WTOP-FM reported that, according to Barry&#x27;s attorney, Barry had filed his federal and District tax returns for 2007. The same day, Barry was admitted to Howard University Hospital to prepare for a kidney transplant the next day. Barry was released from the hospital on February 27, but he was readmitted on March 2 due to large amounts of air in his abdominal cavity and also due to Barry&#x27;s complaints of serious pains, both of which were caused by the combination of medications Barry was taking after the operation. Barry was released from the hospital on March 6. On April 17, 2009, the prosecution withdrew their request to revoke Barry&#x27;s probation.

On September 9, 2011, the Internal Revenue Service filed a notice of federal tax lien against Barry because of $3,200 of unpaid federal income taxes for 2010. Barry attributed the lien to poor communication between the Internal Revenue Service and his representatives.

====Alleged traffic violations====
On September 10, 2006, Barry was stopped by Secret Service Uniformed Division police officers after stopping at a green light and running a red light. According to a Secret Service spokesman, the police officers pulled over his car, smelled alcohol, and administered a field sobriety test. Barry was then taken to the U.S. Capitol Police station for a breathalyzer test. The Secret Service said that the breathalyzer test did not give an accurate reading, but Barry later said that it gave a successful reading of 0.02%, which is less than the legal limit of 0.08%. The police officers asked Barry to give a urine analysis, which Barry refused. The officers gave Barry a ticket for running a red light and failing to submit to a urine analysis. He was also charged with driving an unregistered vehicle and misuse of temporary tags. Barry pleaded not guilty to the charges. Prosecutors offered Barry a deal to drop the charge of driving under the influence in exchange for a guilty plea from Barry; he declined. A judge found him not guilty of the charges.

On December 16, 2006, the Park Police pulled over Barry for driving too slowly, which Barry later said was because he was trying to figure out where to enter an elementary school&#x27;s parking lot for a nonprofit foundation&#x27;s event. After looking up Barry&#x27;s record, the police officer told Barry that his license had been suspended and ticketed Barry for operating a vehicle on a suspended license, despite Barry&#x27;s insistence to the contrary. Two days later, the D.C. Department of Motor Vehicles confirmed that Barry&#x27;s license had not actually been suspended and said a computer glitch must have caused the error.

On August 2, 2014, Barry was in a traffic accident in the district, which his spokesperson blamed on a &quot;hypoglycemic attack&quot; due to his diabetes. At the time of the accident, Barry had $2,800 in unpaid tickets for speeding and parking violations accumulated since 2012.

====Conflict of interest: personal benefit from contract to girlfriend====
On July 4, 2009, Barry was taken into custody by the Park Police after political consultant Donna Watts-Brighthaupt, his ex-girlfriend, claimed he was stalking her. Barry was arrested and charged with &quot;misdemeanor stalking&quot;. Following an interview with authorities, he was released on citation and told he must appear before the Superior Court of the District of Columbia on July 9. However, all charges were dropped on July 8.

An investigative report by a special counsel said that Barry had personally benefited from a contract that he had awarded to his then-girlfriend Donna Watts-Brighthaupt. The report stated that Barry had awarded a contract to Watts-Brighthaupt, who then repaid money owed to Barry with the proceeds of the contract. When interviewed by the special counsel, Watts-Brighthaupt admitted to plagiarizing substantial portions of her study from a publicly available study by the United States Department of Education. The special counsel report also said that Barry had requested 41 earmarks in 2009 worth $8.4 million, some of which were paid to organizations &quot;rife with waste and abuse.&quot; The report also said that Barry had impeded the investigation by refusing to respond to questions and by telling witnesses not to respond to questions and not give subpoenaed documents to the special counsel.

Barry responded to the special counsel report by claiming he had violated no written rules or procedures on such contracts and that there was no conflict of interest. Barry apologized for his &quot;very, very poor judgment.&quot;

In response to the special counsel&#x27;s report, several council members said they would like to hear a response from Barry before considering a censure. On March 2, 2010, the Council of the District of Columbia voted 12–0 in favor of stripping Barry of all committee assignments, ending his chair of the Committee on Housing and Workforce Development, and removing him from the Committee on Finance and Revenue.

===Asian American racist remarks controversy===
At a party celebrating his primary victory for his D.C. council seat on April 3, 2012, Barry said, &quot;We&#x27;ve got to do something about these Asians coming in, opening up businesses, those dirty shops. They ought to go, I&#x27;ll just say that right now, you know. But we need African-American businesspeople to be able to take their places, too.&quot;

Several other council members, Mayor Vincent Gray, and Delegate Eleanor Holmes Norton criticized Barry&#x27;s comments. Five Asian American members of the Maryland General Assembly also called on Barry to apologize in a statement, saying, &quot;At best, Mr. Barry&#x27;s attack on Asian Americans is deeply troubling, and at worst it is race baiting.&quot;

Barry apologized for his comments, saying in a written statement, &quot;It is to these less than stellar Asian-American businessmen in Ward 8 that my remarks were directed, not the whole of Asian businessmen in Ward 8 or the Asian-American population.&quot;

Several weeks later, Barry sparked a diplomatic incident with the diplomatic mission from the Philippines, after he said at a meeting with UDC personnel that &quot;it&#x27;s so bad, that if you go to the hospital now, you&#x27;ll find a number of immigrants who are nurses, particularly from the Philippines ... And, no offense, but let&#x27;s grow our own teachers, let&#x27;s grow our own nurses, so that we don&#x27;t have to be scrounging around in our community clinics and other kinds of places, having to hire people from somewhere else.&quot;

While apologizing to Asian Americans for his previous comments, Barry used the anti-Polish slur Polack.

==Personal life== 
While attending Tennessee State University Barry met Blantie Charlesetta Evans. They married on March 3, 1962 in Nashville. In June 1964, Barry “disappeared,” leaving his wife “impoverished,” according to a divorce suit that she filed in 1969. Her divorce was granted by a judge who found that Barry had “abandoned” her.

Barry met Mary Treadwell at Fisk University. They were married from 1972-1975. 

Barry married Effi Slaughter, his third wife, just after announcing his candidacy for mayor in 1978. The couple had one son, Marion Christopher Barry, who died of a drug overdose on August 14, 2016. During his first three terms as mayor, Barry lived and raised his family at 3607 Suitland Road SE in the Anacostia section of DC. The Barrys separated in November 1990, soon after he was caught on videotape smoking crack cocaine with an ex-model and propositioning her for sex. They divorced in 1993, but Effi returned to Washington and supported him in his successful bid for a city council seat in 2004. Effi died on September 6, 2007, after an 18-month battle with acute myeloid leukemia.

Barry married Cora Masters on January 8, 1993. Masters was a political science professor at the University of the District of Columbia and his former spokeswoman.

==Death==

Barry died from heart disease at United Medical Center in Washington, D.C., on November 23, 2014, aged 78. Following three days of memorial observances, he was buried on December 6 at Washington&#x27;s Congressional Cemetery.

A private monument to Barry was erected over his grave and unveiled on November 22, 2016. The event was attended by current and former D.C. Council members, former mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly, and about 150 other dignitaries, family members, and friends of Barry. The memorial, conceived and largely designed by Cora Masters Barry and Marion Christopher Barry, was carved by nationally prominent sculptor and engraver Andy Del Gallo and manufactured by Eastern Memorials (a D.C.-based funerary monument company).

==Legacy==
In June 2009, a documentary of Barry&#x27;s life was released at Silverdocs. The documentary was released in August 2009 on HBO.

A 1993 survey of historians, political scientists and urban experts conducted by Melvin G. Holli of the University of Illinois at Chicago ranked Barry as the eleventh-worst American big-city mayor to have served between the years 1820 and 1993.

In April 2014, in the midst of a contentious mayoral race in Newark, New Jersey, the future victor Ras Baraka was asked by Rutgers University professor and Newark city historian Clement A. Price to choose his role models as mayor. In response, Baraka named Barry and Chokwe Lumumba of Jackson, Mississippi.

In November 2023, Good Hope Road SE, which ran through Wards 7 and 8 in Anacostia, was renamed as Marion Barry Avenue SE.

<text>Golden Delicious is a cultivar of apple. It is one of the 15 most popular apple cultivars in the United States. It is not closely related to Red Delicious.

== History ==
Golden Delicious arose from a chance seedling, possibly a hybrid of Grimes Golden and Golden Reinette. The original tree was found on the family farm of J. M. Mullins in Clay County, West Virginia, and was locally known as Mullins&#x27; Yellow Seedling. Mullins sold the tree and propagation rights to Stark Brothers Nurseries for $5000, which first marketed it as a companion of their Red Delicious in 1914.

In 1943, the New York State Agricultural Experiment Station in Geneva, New York developed the Jonagold apple by cross-breeding Golden Delicious and Jonathan trees. The cultivar was officially released in 1968 and went on to become the leading apple cultivar in Europe. According to the USApple Association website, , Golden Delicious, along with its descendent cultivars Gala, Ginger Gold, Honeycrisp, and Jonagold, were among the fifteen most popular apple cultivars in the United States.

Golden Delicious was designated the official state fruit of West Virginia by a Senate resolution on February 20, 1995. Clay County has hosted an annual Golden Delicious Festival since 1972.

In 2010, an Italian-led consortium announced they had decoded the complete genome of the Golden Delicious apple. It had the highest number of genes (57,000) of any plant genome studied to date.

Golden Delicious was one of four apples honored by the United States Postal Service in a 2013 set of four 33¢ stamps commemorating historic strains, joined by Northern Spy, Baldwin, and Granny Smith.

== Appearance and flavor ==

Golden Delicious is a large, yellowish-green skinned cultivar and very sweet to the taste. It is prone to bruising and shriveling, so it needs careful handling and storage. It is a favorite for eating plain, as well as for use in salads, apple sauce, and apple butter. America&#x27;s Test Kitchen, Food Network, and Serious Eats all list Golden Delicious apples as one of the best apples for baking apple pie due to its balanced flavor and its high pectin content that allows it to stay intact when cooked.
*Density 0.79 g/cc
*Sugar 13.5%
*Acid 5.6 gram/litre
*Vitamin C 10–20 mg/litre
== Season ==


Golden Delicious are harvested 130–150 days after full bloom.

<doc id="253335" wikidata="Q332436" url="?curid=253335" title="Maciste">
<text>Maciste () is one of the oldest recurring characters of cinema, created by Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio and Giovanni Pastrone. He is featured throughout the history of the cinema of Italy from the 1910s to the mid-1960s.

He is usually depicted as a Hercules-like figure, utilizing his massive strength to achieve heroic feats that ordinary men cannot. Many of the 1960s Italian movies featuring Maciste were retitled in other countries, substituting more popular names in the titles (such as Hercules, Goliath or Samson).

==Name origin==
There are a number of references to the name in literature. The name of Maciste appears in a sentence in Strabo&#x27;s &quot;Geographica&quot; (Book 8, Chapter 3, Section 21), in which he writes: – &quot;And in the middle is the temple of the Macistian Heracles, and the river Acidon.&quot; The epithet (&quot;Makistios&quot;, Latinized as &quot;Macistius&quot;) is generally understood to be an adjective referring to a town called Μάκιστος (Makistos) in the province of Triphylia in Elis.
In the first volume of the &quot;Dizionario universale archeologico-artistico-technologico&quot; (1858) &quot;Macistius&quot; is given as one among several epithets of Hercules (&quot;Ercole&quot;). In the second volume of the same dictionary (1864) this name appears Italianized as &quot;Maciste&quot;, defined as &quot;uno dei soprannomi d&#x27;Ercole&quot; (&quot;one of the nicknames of Hercules&quot;).
According to William Smith&#x27;s &quot;A Dictionary of Greek and Roman mythology&quot;, &quot;Macistus&quot; (Μάκιστος) was &quot;a surname of Heracles, who had a temple in the neighbourhood of the town of Macistus in Triphylia&quot;. Makistos was also the third child of Athamas and Nephele, according to the Greek mythology.

In the original draft outline of the 1914 movie &quot;Cabiria&quot; by director Giovanni Pastrone, the muscular hero&#x27;s name had been &quot;Ercole&quot; (&quot;Hercules&quot;). In the revised script, writer Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio gave the character the name &quot;Maciste&quot;, which he understood (based on the above or similar sources) to be an erudite synonym for Hercules. 

While subsequent screenwriters started using the same character for new movie plots, the original etymology of the name was generally forgotten, and a new folk etymology was constructed based on the name&#x27;s superficial similarity to the Italian word &quot;macigno&quot;, which means &quot;large stone&quot;; in the first of the 1960s films, Maciste tells another character in the film that his name means &quot;born of the rock&quot;, and in a later film, Maciste is actually shown in one scene appearing from within a solid rock wall in a cave, as if by magic.

In the book &quot;Italian Cinema: Gender and Genre&quot;, the Serena Professor of Italian Maggie Günsberg claims that Gabriele d&#x27;Annunzio used two sources: one from ancient Greek, &quot;makistos&quot;, meaning &quot;longer&quot; (although the Doric Greek μάκιστος actually means &quot;greatest&quot;, &quot;tallest&quot;, or &quot;longest in time&quot;), and the second from a supposed Latin word, &quot;macis&quot;, meaning &quot;rock&quot;. Still, no such word as &quot;macis&quot; exists in Latin. The Italian word &quot;macigno&quot; ultimately derives from Latin &quot;machina&quot;, which is commonly used in the sense of &quot;millstone&quot;.

==&quot;Cabiria&quot;==
Maciste made his debut in the 1914 Italian silent movie classic &quot;Cabiria&quot;. &quot;Cabiria&quot; is a story about a slave named Maciste (played by Bartolomeo Pagano) who was involved in the rescue of a Roman girl named Cabiria (played by Lidia Quaranta) from an evil Carthaginian priest who plotted to sacrifice her to the cruel god Moloch. The film was based very loosely on &quot;Salammbo&quot;, a historical novel by Gustave Flaubert, and had a plot and screenplay by Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio.

Maciste&#x27;s debut set the tone for his later adventures. Including &quot;Cabiria&quot; itself, there have been at least 52 movies featuring Maciste, 27 of them being pre-1927 silent films starring Bartolomeo Pagano and the other 25 being a series of sound and color films produced in the early 1960s. Typical plots involve tyrannical rulers who practice vile magical rituals or worship evil gods. Typically, the young woman who is the love interest runs afoul of the evil ruler. Maciste, who possesses superhuman strength, must rescue her. There is often a rightful king who wants to overthrow the evil usurper, as well as a belly dance scene. There is often an evil queen who has carnal designs on the hero. These films were set in locales including Mongolia, Peru, Egypt, and the Roman Empire.

==Bartolomeo Pagano&#x27;s Maciste films==
As a character, Maciste had two distinct moments in the spotlight. The first was in the Italian silent movie period, in which the original Maciste from &quot;Cabiria&quot;, the muscular actor Bartolomeo Pagano, starred in a series of at least 26 sequels over the period from 1915 through 1926. Then decades later, (following on the heels of the success of the two 1950s Steve Reeves &quot;Hercules&quot; films) Maciste was revived by Italian filmmakers for a series of 25 sound films (all made between 1960 and 1965).

The Bartolomeo Pagano silent Maciste films established the character as someone who could appear at any place and at any time. Some of the earlier ones, made during World War I, had the distinct flavour of propaganda, and cast the hero in the role of a soldier. Later films in the series return to fantasy, but the fantasy was not always mythological. Maciste appears as an Olympic athlete, in contemporary settings, or in the afterlife. His character and his plots remained consistent in whatever setting; he was always a populist Hercules, using his physical prowess to overcome the evil ruses of effete aristocrats and authority figures.
==Revival of the 1960s==
The character was revived in the 1960s. In 1957, Steve Reeves&#x27; &quot;Hercules&quot;, an Italian production, created a minor boom in Italian dramas featuring American bodybuilders in vaguely mythological or classical historical subjects. Maciste was the hero in 25 of these films. Other films starred such heroes as Ursus, Samson, Hercules and Goliath.

Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed, nor was he confined to one specific time period or setting in his adventures. However, in the first of the 1960s Maciste films, he mentions to another character that the name &quot;Maciste&quot; means &quot;born of the rock&quot; (almost as if he was a god who would just appear out of the earth in times of need). One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was actually entitled &quot;The Giant from the Dolomite&quot; (another reference that he was not born as an ordinary mortal man would have been). Hence it is hinted that Maciste is more god than man, which would explain his great strength.

This sword and sandal fad continued for about six years, until the new fad for spaghetti Westerns and spy films took over the attention of the Italian cinema industry. The name Maciste was not in the title of the English versions of most of these films: when the films were imported into the US and dubbed in English, the hero&#x27;s name was often changed to Hercules, Samson, Goliath, Atlas, Ulysses, or Colossus, because the name Maciste was not widely recognised in the USA.

Some Italian sword and sandal films were not theatrically released in the USA; rather they premiered on American television in a syndication package called &quot;The Sons of Hercules&quot;, usually broadcast on Saturday afternoons. Best remembered for its stirring theme song, films originally featuring Maciste were dubbed into a variety of different &quot;Sons of Hercules&quot; pictures, with stock narration at the opening attempting to tie the film&#x27;s lead character in to Hercules any way they could. A number of Italian musclemen played Maciste in the 1960s films, but Mark Forest was the actor who played Maciste the most (7 times). The other actors included Gordon Scott, Reg Park, Gordon Mitchell, Reg Lewis, Kirk Morris, Samson Burke, Alan Steel, Richard Lloyd, Renato Rossini and Frank Gordon.

==Influence==
* The &quot;Cabiria&quot; scene in which Maciste pushes a mill wheel for ten years may have inspired John Milius, who shot a similar one for his movie &quot;Conan the Barbarian&quot; (1982).
* Federico Fellini said that &quot;Maciste all&#x27;inferno&quot; (1925) was the first movie he remembered seeing as a child. His 1954 film &quot;La Strada&quot; features a brutish strongman performer.
* The 1960s adventures have been enjoyed mostly by devotees of camp style. Two of the films, &quot;Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste&quot; (translated as &quot;Colossus and the Headhunters&quot;) and &quot;Maciste e la regina di Samar&quot; (as &quot;Hercules Against the Moon Men&quot;) appeared on the comedy television program &quot;Mystery Science Theater 3000&quot; in the 1990s. In &quot;Colossus and the Headhunters&quot;, the pronunciation of Maciste&#x27;s name was frequently mocked as &quot;my cheesesteak.&quot;
* The Belgian strongman John Massis based his pseudonym on Maciste.
* The 2006 film &quot;The Caiman&quot; features an Italian exploitation film producer who made the film &quot;Machiste Against Freud&quot;.
* In the 2013 film &quot;Il Futuro&quot; Rutger Hauer plays a retired actor and bodybuilder nicknamed &quot;Machiste&quot; for having starred in the role in the 1960s. The film is based on Roberto Bolaño&#x27;s &quot;A Little Lumpen Novelita&quot;, featuring the character.

===The 1960s film series (in chronological order)===

There were a total of 25 Maciste films from the 1960s peplum craze. By 1960, seeing how well the two Steve Reeves &quot;Hercules&quot; films were doing at the box office, Italian producers decided to revive the 1920s silent film character &quot;Maciste&quot; in a new series of color and sound films. Unlike the other Italian peplum protagonists, Maciste appeared in a variety of time periods ranging from the Ice Age to 16th Century Scotland. Maciste was never given an origin, and the source of his mighty powers was never revealed. However, in the first film of the 1960s series, he mentions to another character that the name &quot;Maciste&quot; means &quot;born of the rock&quot;, as if he were a god who would appear out of the earth itself in times of need. One of the 1920s silent Maciste films was entitled &quot;The Giant from the Dolomite&quot;, suggesting that Maciste may be more god than man, which would explain his great strength.

The first title listed for each film is the film&#x27;s original Italian title along with its English translation, while the U.S. release title follows in bold type in parentheses (Maciste&#x27;s name in the Italian title is usually altered to an entirely different name in the American title):

* &quot;Maciste il Vendicatore dei Mayas&quot; / &quot;Maciste, Avenger of the Mayans&quot; (has no American title, 1965) (This Maciste film was made up almost entirely of re-edited stock footage from two older Maciste films, &quot;Maciste contro i mostri&quot; and &quot;Maciste contro i cacciatori di teste&quot;, so Maciste switches from Kirk Morris to Reg Lewis in various scenes; this movie is very scarce since it was never distributed in the US and is not available in English.)

===The 1973 films of Jesús Franco===
In 1973, the Spanish cult film director Jesús Franco directed two low-budget &quot;Maciste&quot; films for French producers: &quot;Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones&quot; (&quot;Maciste vs the Queen of the Amazons&quot;) and &quot;Les exploits érotiques de Maciste dans l&#x27;Atlantide&quot; (&quot;The Erotic Exploits of Maciste in Atlantis&quot;), both starring Wal Davis as Maciste. The films have almost identical casts and appear to have been shot back-to-back. Despite their titles, the plots were totally unrelated to the 1960s Italian Maciste series. Maciste was presented as a 16th-century French adventurer who travels overseas to exotic lands.

&quot;Maciste contre la Reine des Amazones&quot; was distributed in Italy as a &quot;Karzan&quot; film (a Tarzan imitation), while &quot;Les exploits érotiques de Maciste dans l&#x27;Atlantide&quot; was released, also in France, in a second version with hardcore pornographic inserts entitled &quot;Les Gloutonnes&quot; (literally: &quot;The Gobblers&quot;).
