<text>Metformin, sold under the brand name Glucophage, among others, is the main first-line medication for the treatment of type2 diabetes, particularly in people who are overweight. It is also used in the treatment of polycystic ovary syndrome, and is sometimes used as an off-label adjunct to lessen the risk of metabolic syndrome in people who take antipsychotic medication. It has been shown to inhibit inflammation, and is not associated with weight gain. Metformin is taken by mouth.
Metformin is generally well tolerated. Common adverse effects include diarrhea, nausea, and abdominal pain. It has a small risk of causing low blood sugar. High blood lactic acid level (acidosis) is a concern if the medication is used in overly large doses or prescribed in people with severe kidney problems.
Metformin is a biguanide anti-hyperglycemic agent. It works by decreasing glucose production in the liver, increasing the insulin sensitivity of body tissues, and increasing GDF15 secretion, which reduces appetite and caloric intake.
Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922 by Emil Werner and James Bell. French physician Jean Sterne began the study in humans in the 1950s. It was introduced as a medication in France in 1957. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the second most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 86million prescriptions. In Australia, it was one of the top 10 most prescribed medications between 2017 and 2023.
== Medical uses ==
Metformin is used to lower the blood glucose in those with type2 diabetes. It is also used as a second-line agent for infertility in those with polycystic ovary syndrome.

=== Type 2 diabetes ===
The American Diabetes Association and the American College of Physicians both recommend metformin as a first-line agent to treat type2 diabetes. It is as effective as repaglinide and more effective than all other oral drugs for type2 diabetes.

==== Efficacy ====

Treatment guidelines for major professional associations, including the European Association for the Study of Diabetes, the European Society for Cardiology, and the American Diabetes Association, describe evidence for the cardiovascular benefits of metformin as equivocal. A 2020 Cochrane systematic review did not find enough evidence of reduction of cardiovascular mortality, non-fatal myocardial infarction or non-fatal stroke when comparing metformin monotherapy to other glucose-lowering drugs, behavior change interventions, placebo or no intervention.

The use of metformin reduces body weight in people with type2 diabetes in contrast to sulfonylureas, which are associated with weight gain. Some evidence shows that metformin is associated with weight loss in obesity in the absence of diabetes. Metformin has a lower risk of hypoglycemia than the sulfonylureas, although hypoglycemia has uncommonly occurred during intense exercise, calorie deficit, or when used with other agents to lower blood glucose. Metformin modestly reduces low density lipoprotein and triglyceride levels.

In individuals with prediabetes, a 2019 systematic review comparing the effects of metformin with other interventions in the reduction of risk of developing type2 diabetes found moderate-quality evidence that metformin reduced the risk of developing type2 diabetes when compared to diet and exercise or a placebo. However, when comparing metformin to intensive diet or exercise, moderate-quality evidence was found that metformin did not reduce risk of developing type2 diabetes and very low-quality evidence was found that adding metformin to intensive diet or exercise did not show any advantage or disadvantage in reducing risk of type2 diabetes when compared to intensive exercise and diet alone. The same review also found one suitable trial comparing the effects of metformin and sulfonylurea in reducing the risk of developing type2 diabetes in prediabetic individuals, however, this trial did not report any patient-relevant outcomes.

=== Polycystic ovarian syndrome ===
In those with polycystic ovarian syndrome (PCOS), tentative evidence shows that metformin use increases the rate of live births. This includes in those who have not been able to get pregnant with clomiphene. Metformin does not appear to change the risk of miscarriage. A number of other benefits have also been found both during pregnancy and in nonpregnant women with PCOS. In an updated Cochrane (2020) review on metformin versus placebo/no treatment before or during IVF/ICSI in women with PCOS no conclusive evidence of improved live birth rates was found. In long GnRH-agonist protocols there was uncertainty in the evidence of improved live birth rates but there could be increases in clinical pregnancy rate. In short GnRH-antagonist protocols metformin may reduce live birth rates with uncertainty on its effect on clinical pregnancy rate. Metformin may result in a reduction of OHSS but could come with a greater frequency of side effects. There was uncertainty as to metformin&#x27;s impact on miscarriage. The evidence does not support general use during pregnancy for improving maternal and infant outcomes in obese women.

The United Kingdom&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence recommended in 2004 that women with PCOS and a body mass index above 25 be given metformin for anovulation and infertility when other therapies fail to produce results. UK and international clinical practice guidelines do not recommend metformin as a first-line treatment or do not recommend it at all, except for women with glucose intolerance. The guidelines suggest clomiphene as the first medication option and emphasize lifestyle modification independently from medical treatment. Metformin treatment decreases the risk of developing type2 diabetes in women with PCOS who exhibited impaired glucose tolerance at baseline.

=== Diabetes and pregnancy ===
A total review of metformin use during pregnancy compared to insulin alone found good short-term safety for both the mother and baby, but safety in the longer term is unclear. Several observational studies and randomized controlled trials found metformin to be as effective and safe as insulin for the management of gestational diabetes. Nonetheless, several concerns have been raised and evidence on the long-term safety of metformin for both mother and child is lacking. Compared with insulin, women with gestational diabetes treated with metformin gain less weight and are less likely to develop pre‐eclampsia during pregnancy. Babies born to women treated with metformin have less visceral fat, and this may make them less prone to insulin resistance in later life. The use of metformin for gestational diabetes resulted in smaller babies compared to treatment with insulin. However, despite initially lower birth weight, children exposed to metformin during pregnancy had accelerated growth after birth, and were heavier by mid-childhood than those exposed to insulin during pregnancy. This pattern of initial low birth weight followed by catch-up growth that surpasses comparative children has been associated with long-term cardiometabolic disease.

A systematic review and meta-analysis of metformin, published in 2024, found that it is safe and effective in managing gestational diabetes or diabetes in pregnancy with no adverse impact on the mother or the child after eleven years of childbirth.

=== Weight change ===
Metformin use is typically associated with weight loss. It appears to be safe and effective in counteracting the weight gain caused by the antipsychotic medications olanzapine and clozapine. Although modest reversal of clozapine-associated weight gain is found with metformin, primary prevention of weight gain is more valuable.

===Use with insulin===
Metformin may reduce the insulin requirement in type1 diabetes, albeit with an increased risk of hypoglycemia.

== Contraindications ==
Metformin is contraindicated in people with:
* Severe renal impairment (estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) below 30 mL/min/1.73 m2)
* Known hypersensitivity to metformin
* Acute or chronic metabolic acidosis, including diabetic ketoacidosis (from uncontrolled diabetes), with or without coma

== Adverse effects ==
The most common adverse effect of metformin is gastrointestinal irritation, including diarrhea, cramps, nausea, vomiting, and increased flatulence. Metformin is more commonly associated with gastrointestinal adverse effects than most other antidiabetic medications. The most serious potential adverse effect of metformin is lactic acidosis; this complication is rare, and seems to be related to impaired liver or kidney function. Metformin is not approved for use in those with severe kidney disease, but may still be used at lower doses in those with kidney problems.

=== Gastrointestinal ===
Gastrointestinal upset can cause severe discomfort; it is most common when metformin is first administered, or when the dose is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low dose (1.0 to 1.7 g/day) and increasing the dose gradually, but even with low doses, 5% of people may be unable to tolerate metformin. Use of slow or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.

Long-term use of metformin has been associated with increased homocysteine levels and malabsorption of vitamin B12. Higher doses and prolonged use are associated with increased incidence of vitamin B12 deficiency, and some researchers recommend screening or prevention strategies.

==== Vitamin B12 ====
Metformin treatment has been associated with reductions in vitamin B12 in certain people. Left untreated, vitamin B12 deficiencies can lead to serious health problems including neurological problems and anemia. Although more research is needed to understand the mechanisms of this association, it is suggested that people who take metformin monitor their vitamin B12 levels and if low, begin supplementation. In most cases of deficiencies if the person&#x27;s deficiency can be corrected with exogenous administration of vitamin B12, they can continue their metformin treatment under the supervision of their doctor.

=== Lactic acidosis ===
Lactic acidosis rarely occurs with metformin exposure during routine medical care. Rates of metformin-associated lactic acidosis are about nine per 100,000 persons/year, which is similar to the background rate of lactic acidosis in the general population. A systematic review concluded no data exists to definitively link metformin to lactic acidosis.

Metformin is generally safe in people with mild to moderate chronic kidney disease, with a proportional reduction of metformin dose according to severity of estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) and with periodic assessment of kidney function, (e.g., periodic plasma creatinine measurement). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) recommends avoiding the use of metformin in more severe chronic kidney disease, below the eGFR cutoff of 30 mL/minute/1.73 m2. Lactate uptake by the liver is diminished with metformin use because lactate is a substrate for hepatic gluconeogenesis, a process that metformin inhibits. In healthy individuals, this slight excess is cleared by other mechanisms (including uptake by unimpaired kidneys), and no significant elevation in blood levels of lactate occurs. Given severely impaired kidney function, clearance of metformin and lactate is reduced, increasing levels of both, and possibly causing lactic acid buildup. Because metformin decreases liver uptake of lactate, any condition that may precipitate lactic acidosis is a contraindication. Common causes include alcoholism (due to depletion of NAD+ stores), heart failure, and respiratory disease (due to inadequate tissue oxygenation); the most common cause is kidney disease.

Metformin-associated lactate production may also take place in the large intestine, which could potentially contribute to lactic acidosis in those with risk factors. The clinical significance of this is unknown, though, and the risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is most commonly attributed to decreased hepatic uptake rather than increased intestinal production.

=== Overdose ===
The most common symptoms following an overdose include vomiting, diarrhea, abdominal pain, tachycardia, drowsiness, and rarely, hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia. Treatment of metformin overdose is generally supportive, as no specific antidote is known. Extracorporeal treatments are recommended in severe overdoses. Due to metformin&#x27;s low molecular weight and lack of plasma protein binding, these techniques have the benefit of removing metformin from the blood plasma, preventing further lactate overproduction.

Metformin may be quantified in blood, plasma, or serum to monitor therapy, confirm a diagnosis of poisoning, or assist in a forensic death investigation. Blood or plasma metformin concentrations are usually in a range of 1–4 mg/L in persons receiving therapeutic doses, 40–120 mg/L in victims of acute overdosage, and 80–200 mg/L in fatalities. Chromatographic techniques are commonly employed.

The risk of metformin-associated lactic acidosis is also increased by a massive overdose of metformin, although even quite large doses are often not fatal.

=== Interactions ===
The H2-receptor antagonist cimetidine causes an increase in the plasma concentration of metformin by reducing clearance of metformin by the kidneys; both metformin and cimetidine are cleared from the body by tubular secretion, and both, particularly the cationic (positively charged) form of cimetidine, may compete for the same transport mechanism. A small double-blind, randomized study found the antibiotic cephalexin to also increase metformin concentrations by a similar mechanism; theoretically, other cationic medications may produce the same effect.

Metformin also interacts with anticholinergic medications, due to their effect on gastric motility. Anticholinergic drugs reduce gastric motility, prolonging the time drugs spend in the gastrointestinal tract. This impairment may lead to more metformin being absorbed than without the presence of an anticholinergic drug, thereby increasing the concentration of metformin in the plasma and increasing the risk for adverse effects.

== Pharmacology ==

=== Mechanism of action ===
The molecular mechanism of metformin is not completely understood. Multiple potential mechanisms of action have been proposed: inhibition of the mitochondrial respiratory chain (complex I), activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), inhibition of glucagon-induced elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) with reduced activation of protein kinase A (PKA), complex IV–mediated inhibition of the GPD2 variant of mitochondrial glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (thereby reducing the contribution of glycerol to hepatic gluconeogenesis), and an effect on gut microbiota.

Metformin exerts an anorexiant effect in most people, decreasing caloric intake. Metformin decreases gluconeogenesis (glucose production) in the liver. Metformin inhibits basal secretion from the pituitary gland of growth hormone, adrenocorticotropic hormone, follicle stimulating hormone, and expression of proopiomelanocortin, which in part accounts for its insulin-sensitizing effect with multiple actions on tissues including the liver, skeletal muscle, endothelium, adipose tissue, and the ovaries. The average patient with type2 diabetes has three times the normal rate of gluconeogenesis; metformin treatment reduces this by over one-third.

Activation of AMPK was required for metformin&#x27;s inhibitory effect on liver glucose production. AMPK is an enzyme that plays an important role in insulin signaling, whole-body energy balance, and the metabolism of glucose and fats. AMPK activation is required for an increase in the expression of small heterodimer partner, which in turn inhibited the expression of the hepatic gluconeogenic genes phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase and glucose 6-phosphatase. Metformin is frequently used in research along with AICA ribonucleotide as an AMPK agonist. The mechanism by which biguanides increase the activity of AMPK remains uncertain: metformin increases the concentration of cytosolic adenosine monophosphate (AMP) (as opposed to a change in total AMP or total AMP/adenosine triphosphate) which could activate AMPK allosterically at high levels; a newer theory involves binding to PEN-2. Metformin inhibits cyclic AMP production, blocking the action of glucagon, and thereby reducing fasting glucose levels. Metformin also induces a profound shift in the faecal microbial community profile in diabetic mice, and this may contribute to its mode of action possibly through an effect on glucagon-like peptide-1 secretion.

In addition to suppressing hepatic glucose production, metformin increases insulin sensitivity, enhances peripheral glucose uptake (by inducing the phosphorylation of GLUT4 enhancer factor), decreases insulin-induced suppression of fatty acid oxidation, and decreases the absorption of glucose from the gastrointestinal tract. Increased peripheral use of glucose may be due to improved insulin binding to insulin receptors. The increase in insulin binding after metformin treatment has also been demonstrated in patients with type2 diabetes.

AMPK probably also plays a role in increased peripheral insulin sensitivity, as metformin administration increases AMPK activity in skeletal muscle. AMPK is known to cause GLUT4 deployment to the plasma membrane, resulting in insulin-independent glucose uptake. Some metabolic actions of metformin do appear to occur by AMPK-independent mechanisms, however, AMPK likely has a modest overall effect and its activity is not likely to directly decrease gluconeogenesis in the liver.

Metformin has indirect antiandrogenic effects in women with insulin resistance, such as those with PCOS, due to its beneficial effects on insulin sensitivity. It may reduce testosterone levels in such women by as much as 50%. A Cochrane review, though, found that metformin was only slightly effective for decreasing androgen levels in women with PCOS.

Metformin also has significant effects on the gut microbiome, such as its effect on increasing agmatine production by gut bacteria, but the relative importance of this mechanism compared to other mechanisms is uncertain.

Due to its effect on GLUT4 and AMPK, metformin has been described as an exercise mimetic.

=== Pharmacokinetics ===
Metformin has an oral bioavailability of 50–60% under fasting conditions, and is absorbed slowly. Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) are reached within 1–3 hours of taking immediate-release metformin and 4–8 hours with extended-release formulations. The plasma protein binding of metformin is negligible, as reflected by its very high apparent volume of distribution (300–1000 L after a single dose). Steady state is usually reached in 1–2 days.

Metformin has acid dissociation constant values (pKa) of 2.8 and 11.5, so it exists very largely as the hydrophilic cationic species at physiological pH values. The metformin pKa values make it a stronger base than most other basic medications with less than 0.01% nonionized in blood. Furthermore, the lipid solubility of the nonionized species is slight as shown by its low logP value (log(10) of the distribution coefficient of the nonionized form between octanol and water) of −1.43. These chemical parameters indicate low lipophilicity and, consequently, rapid passive diffusion of metformin through cell membranes is unlikely. As a result of its low lipid solubility, it requires the transporter SLC22A1 for it to enter cells. The logP of metformin is less than that of phenformin (−0.84) because two methyl substituents on metformin impart lesser lipophilicity than the larger phenylethyl side chain in phenformin. More lipophilic derivatives of metformin are presently under investigation to produce prodrugs with superior oral absorption than metformin.

Metformin is not metabolized. It is cleared from the body by tubular secretion and excreted unchanged in the urine; it is undetectable in blood plasma within 24 hours of a single oral dose. The average elimination half-life in plasma is 6.2 hours. Metformin is distributed to (and appears to accumulate in) red blood cells, with a much longer elimination half-life: 17.6 hours (reported as ranging from 18.5 to 31.5 hours in a single-dose study of nondiabetics).

Some evidence indicates that liver concentrations of metformin in humans may be two to three times higher than plasma concentrations, due to portal vein absorption and first-pass uptake by the liver in oral administration.

== Chemistry ==
Metformin hydrochloride (1,1-dimethylbiguanide hydrochloride) is freely soluble in water, slightly soluble in ethanol, but almost insoluble in acetone, ether, or chloroform. The pKa of metformin is 12.4. The usual synthesis of metformin, originally described in 1922, involves the one-pot reaction of dimethylamine hydrochloride and 2-cyanoguanidine overheat.

According to the procedure described in the 1975 Aron patent, and the &quot;Pharmaceutical Manufacturing Encyclopedia&quot;, equimolar amounts of dimethylamine and 2-cyanoguanidine are dissolved in toluene with cooling to make a concentrated solution, and an equimolar amount of hydrogen chloride is slowly added. The mixture begins to boil on its own, and after cooling, metformin hydrochloride precipitates with a 96% yield.

=== Impurities ===
In December 2019, the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced that it learned that some metformin medicines manufactured outside the United States might contain a nitrosamine impurity called N-nitrosodimethylamine (NDMA), classified as a probable human carcinogen, at low levels. Health Canada announced that it was assessing NDMA levels in metformin.

In February 2020, the FDA found NDMA levels in some tested metformin samples that did not exceed the acceptable daily intake.

In February 2020, Health Canada announced a recall of Apotex immediate-release metformin, followed in March by recalls of Ranbaxy metformin and in March by Jamp metformin.

In May 2020, the FDA asked five companies to voluntarily recall their sustained-release metformin products. The five companies were not named, but they were revealed to be Amneal Pharmaceuticals, Actavis Pharma, Apotex Corp, Lupin Pharma, and Marksans Pharma Limited in a letter sent to Valisure, the pharmacy that had first alerted the FDA to this contaminant in metformin via a Citizen Petition.

In June 2020, the FDA posted its laboratory results showing NDMA amounts in metformin products it tested. It found NDMA in certain lots of ER metformin and is recommending companies recall lots with levels of NDMA above the acceptable intake limit of 96 nanograms per day. The FDA is also collaborating with international regulators to share testing results for metformin.

In July 2020, Lupin Pharmaceuticals pulled all lots (batches) of metformin after discovering unacceptably high levels of NDMA in tested samples.

In August 2020, Bayshore Pharmaceuticals recalled two lots of tablets.

The FDA issued revised guidelines about nitrosamine impurities in September 2024.

== History ==
The biguanide class of antidiabetic medications, which also includes the withdrawn agents phenformin and buformin, originates from the plant Goat&#x27;s rue (&quot;Galega officinalis&quot;) also known as Galega, French lilac, Italian fitch, Spanish sainfoin, Pestilenzkraut, or Professor-weed. (The plant should not be confused with plants in the genus Tephrosia which are highly toxic and sometimes also called Goat&#x27;s rue.) Galega officinalis has been used in folk medicine for several centuries. &quot;G. officinalis&quot; itself does not contain biguanide medications which are chemically synthesized compounds composed of two guanidine molecules and designed to be less toxic than the plant-derived parent compounds guanidine and galegine (isoamylene guanidine).

Metformin was first described in the scientific literature in 1922, by Emil Werner and James Bell, as a product in the synthesis of &quot;N&quot;,&quot;N&quot;-dimethylguanidine. In 1929, Slotta and Tschesche discovered its sugar-lowering action in rabbits, finding it the most potent biguanide analog they studied. This result was ignored, as other guanidine analogs such as the synthalins, took over and were themselves soon overshadowed by insulin.

Interest in metformin resumed at the end of the 1940s. In 1950, metformin, unlike some other similar compounds, was found not to decrease blood pressure and heart rate in animals. That year, Filipino physician Eusebio Y. Garcia used metformin (he named it Fluamine) to treat influenza; he noted the medication &quot;lowered the blood sugar to minimum physiological limit&quot; and was not toxic. Garcia believed metformin to have bacteriostatic, antiviral, antimalarial, antipyretic, and analgesic actions. In a series of articles in 1954, Polish pharmacologist Janusz Supniewski was unable to confirm most of these effects, including lowered blood sugar. Instead, he observed antiviral effects in humans.

French diabetologist Jean Sterne studied the antihyperglycemic properties of galegine, an alkaloid isolated from &quot;G. officinalis&quot;, which is related in structure to metformin, and had seen brief use as an antidiabetic before the synthalins were developed. Later, working at Laboratoires Aron in Paris, he was prompted by Garcia&#x27;s report to reinvestigate the blood sugar-lowering activity of metformin and several biguanide analogs. Sterne was the first to try metformin on humans for the treatment of diabetes; he coined the name &quot;Glucophage&quot; (glucose eater) for the medication and published his results in 1957.

Metformin became available in the British National Formulary in 1958. It was sold in the UK by a small Aron subsidiary called Rona.

Broad interest in metformin was not rekindled until the withdrawal of the other biguanides in the 1970s. Metformin was approved in Canada in 1972, but did not receive approval by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for type2 diabetes until 1994. Produced under license by Bristol-Myers Squibb, Glucophage was the first branded formulation of metformin to be marketed in the U.S., beginning on 3 March 1995. Generic formulations are available in several countries.

The US FDA granted the application for metformin orphan drug designation. The European Medicines Agency granted orphan drug status to metformin.

==Society and culture==

=== Environmental impact ===
Metformin and its major transformation product are present in wastewater treatment plant effluents and regularly detected in surface waters. Guanylurea concentrations above 200 μg/L have been measured in the German river Erpe, which are amongst the highest reported for pharmaceutical transformation products in aquatic environments.

=== Formulations ===

Metformin is the British Approved Name (BAN), the United States Adopted Name (USAN), and the International Nonproprietary Name (INN). It is sold under several brand names. Common brand names include Glucophage, Riomet, Fortamet, and Glumetza in the US. In other areas of the world, there is also Obimet, Gluformin, Dianben, Diabex, Diaformin, Metsol, Siofor, Metfogamma and Glifor. There are several formulations of metformin available on the market, and all but the liquid form have generic equivalents.

==== Combination with other medications ====
When used for type2 diabetes, metformin is often prescribed in combination with other medications. Several medications are available as fixed-dose combinations, with the potential to reduce pill burden, decrease cost, and simplify administration.

===== Thiazolidinediones (glitazones) =====

======Rosiglitazone======
A combination of metformin and rosiglitazone was released in 2002, and sold as Avandamet by GlaxoSmithKline, or as a generic medication. Formulations are 500/1, 500/2, 500/4, 1000/2, and 1000 mg/4 mg of metformin/rosiglitazone.

In 2009, it was the most popular metformin combination.

In 2005, the stock of Avandamet was removed from the market, after inspections showed the factory where it was produced was violating good manufacturing practices. The medication pair continued to be prescribed separately, and Avandamet was again available by the end of that year. A generic formulation of metformin/rosiglitazone from Teva received tentative approval from the FDA and reached the market in early 2012.

However, following a meta-analysis in 2007, that linked the medication&#x27;s use to an increased risk of heart attack, concerns were raised over the safety of medicines containing rosiglitazone. In September 2010, the European Medicines Agency recommended that the medication be suspended from the European market because the benefits of rosiglitazone no longer outweighed the risks.

It was withdrawn from the market in the UK and India in 2010, and in New Zealand and South Africa in 2011. From November 2011 until November 2013 the FDA did not allow rosiglitazone or metformin/rosiglitazone to be sold without a prescription; moreover, makers were required to notify patients of the risks associated with its use, and the drug had to be purchased by mail order through specified pharmacies.

In November 2013, the FDA lifted its earlier restrictions on rosiglitazone after reviewing the results of the 2009 RECORD clinical trial (a six-year, open-label randomized control trial), which failed to show elevated risk of heart attack or death associated with the medication.

====== Pioglitazone ======
The combination of metformin and pioglitazone (Actoplus Met, Piomet, Politor, Glubrava) is available in the US and the European Union.

===== DPP-4 inhibitors =====
Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors inhibit dipeptidyl peptidase-4 and thus reduce glucagon and blood glucose levels.

DPP-4 inhibitors combined with metformin include a sitagliptin/metformin combination (Janumet), a saxagliptin/metformin combination (Kombiglyze XR, Komboglyze), and an alogliptin/metformin combination (Kazano, Vipdomet).

Linagliptin combined with metformin hydrochloride is sold under the brand name Jentadueto. As of August 2021, linagliptin/metformin is available as a generic medicine in the US.

=====SGLT-2 inhibitors=====

There are combinations of metformin with the SGLT-2 inhibitors dapagliflozin, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin.

===== Sulfonylureas =====
Sulfonylureas act by increasing insulin release from the beta cells in the pancreas.

A 2019 systematic review suggested that there is limited evidence if the combined use of metformin with sulfonylurea compared to the combination of metformin plus another glucose-lowering intervention, provides benefit or harm in mortality, severe adverse events, macrovascular and microvascular complications. Combined metformin and sulfonylurea therapy did appear to lead to a higher risk of hypoglycemia.

Metformin is available combined with the sulfonylureas glipizide (Metaglip) and glibenclamide (US: glyburide) (Glucovance). Generic formulations of metformin/glipizide and metformin/glibenclamide are available (the latter is more popular).

===== Meglitinide =====
Meglitinides are similar to sulfonylureas, as they bind to beta cells in the pancreas, but differ by the site of binding to the intended receptor and the drugs&#x27; affinities to the receptor. As a result, they have a shorter duration of action compared to sulfonylureas and require higher blood glucose levels to begin to secrete insulin. Both meglitinides, known as nateglinide and repanglinide, are sold in formulations combined with metformin. A repaglinide/metformin combination is sold as Prandimet, or as its generic equivalent.

===== Triple combination =====
The combination of metformin with dapagliflozin and saxagliptin is available in the United States as Qternmet XR.

The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and glibenclamide is available in India as Accuglim-MP, Adglim MP, and Alnamet-GP; and in the Philippines as Tri-Senza.

The combination of metformin with pioglitazone and lipoic acid is available in Turkey as Pional.

== Research ==
Metformin is a pleiotropic drug, with extensive off-target activity beyond its antidiabetic effect. Much of this has been attributed to its action on AMPK, although other mechanisms have been proposed. Metformin has been studied for its effects on multiple other conditions, including:
* Non-alcoholic fatty liver disease
* Premature puberty
* Cancer
* Cardiovascular disease in people with diabetes
* Aging

=== Aging and life extension ===
No evidence shows that metformin extends the human lifespan. Despite that, metformin has received substantial interest as an agent that delays aging; it has been shown to increase longevity in some animal models (e.g., &quot;C. elegans&quot; and crickets). This effect may be mediated by insulin and carbohydrate regulation, similar to its effects on diabetes. Whether metformin may help extend life, even in otherwise healthy people, remains unknown; a 2021 review of the literature found it is likely to improve healthspan, i.e., the number of years spent in good health, rather than lifespan overall.

A 2017 review found that people with diabetes who were taking metformin had lower all-cause mortality. They also had reduced cancer and cardiovascular disease compared with those on other therapies. In people without diabetes, metformin does not appear to reduce the risk of cancer and cardiovascular disease. 

=== Cancer ===
The potential anticancer effects of metformin are believed to be mediated through multiple pathways, particularly involving AMPK activation and IGF-1R modulation. Research has focused particularly on stomach cancer, with evidence of protective impact (reducing the risk of cancer) and improving survival rates among patients in whom cancer has already developed. Despite promising findings, evidence is still preliminary and there is no consensus on its preventive and therapeutic role.

=== COVID-19 ===
A study found a benefit using metformin to reduce the occurrence of long COVID.

It is unclear if there is a reduced risk of death using metformin to treat people with COVID-19.

=== Neurological and neurodegenerative disorders ===
There has been extensive research into the potential neuroprotective effects of metformin in developmental and neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and other dementias, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, Huntington&#x27;s disease, certain types of epilepsy, and fragile X syndrome, with mixed results.

Preliminary studies have examined whether metformin can reduce the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and whether there is a correlation between type2 diabetes and the risk of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease.

While metformin may reduce body weight in persons with fragile X syndrome, whether it improves neurological or psychiatric symptoms is uncertain.

===Derivatives===
A derivative HL156A, also known as IM156, is a potential new drug for medical use.

<text>Drugs used in diabetes treat types of diabetes mellitus by decreasing glucose levels in the blood. With the exception of insulin, most GLP-1 receptor agonists (liraglutide, exenatide, and others), and pramlintide, all diabetes medications are administered orally and are thus called oral hypoglycemic agents or oral antihyperglycemic agents. There are different classes of hypoglycemic drugs, and selection of the appropriate agent depends on the nature of diabetes, age, and situation of the person, as well as other patient factors.

Type 1 diabetes is a disease caused by the lack of insulin. Thus, insulin is the main treatment agent for type 1 and is typically administered via subcutaneous injection.

Type 2 diabetes is a disease of insulin resistance by cells. Type 2 diabetes is the most common type of diabetes. Treatments include agents that (1) increase the amount of insulin secreted by the pancreas, (2) increase the sensitivity of target organs to insulin, (3) decrease the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract, and (4) increase the loss of glucose through urination.

Several drug classes are indicated for use in type 2 diabetes and are often used in combination. Therapeutic combinations may include several insulin isoforms or varying classes of oral antihyperglycemic agents. As of 2020, 23 unique antihyperglycemic drug combinations were approved by the FDA. The first triple combination of oral anti-diabetics was approved in 2019, consisting of metformin, saxagliptin, and dapagliflozin. Another triple combination approval for metformin, linagliptin, and empagliflozin followed in 2020.

==Mechanisms of action==
Diabetes medications have four main mechanisms of action:
* Insulin sensitization: Increased sensitivity of insulin receptors on cells leading to decreased insulin resistance, and higher effects of insulin on blood glucose levels.
* Stimulation of beta cells: This stimulation increases insulin secretion from beta cells of pancreas.
* Alpha-glucosidase inhibition: Inhibition of the alpha-glucosidase enzyme, decreases the rate at which glucose is absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract.
* Alpha-amylase inhibition: Inhibition of the alpha-amylase enzyme, decreasing the digestion of starch.
* SGLT2 inhibition: Inhibition of sodium-glucose transport protein 2 (SGLT2) decreases glucose reabsorption in the renal tubules of nephrons, thus increasing the amount of glucose excreted in urine.

==Insulin==

Insulin is usually given subcutaneously, either by injections or by an insulin pump. In acute care settings, insulin may also be given intravenously. Insulins are typically characterized by the rate at which they are metabolized by the body, yielding different peak times and durations of action. Faster-acting insulins peak quickly and are subsequently metabolized, while longer-acting insulins tend to have extended peak times and remain active in the body for more significant periods.

Examples of rapid-acting insulins (peak at ~1 hour) are:
* Insulin lispro (Humalog)
* Insulin aspart (Novolog)
* Insulin glulisine (Apidra)

Examples of short-acting insulins (peak 2–4 hours) are:
* Regular insulin (Humulin R, Novolin R)
* Prompt insulin zinc (Semilente)

Examples of intermediate-acting insulins (peak 4–10 hours) are:
* Isophane insulin, neutral protamine Hagedorn (NPH) (Humulin N, Novolin N)
* Insulin zinc (Lente)

Examples of long-acting insulins (duration 24 hours, often without peak) are:
* Extended insulin zinc insulin (Ultralente)
* Insulin glargine (Lantus)
* Insulin detemir (Levemir)
* Insulin degludec (Tresiba)

Insulin degludec is sometimes classed separately as an &quot;ultra-long&quot; acting insulin due to its duration of action of about 42 hours, compared with 24 hours for most other long-acting insulin preparations.

As a systematic review of studies comparing insulin detemir, insulin glargine, insulin degludec and NPH insulin did not show any clear benefits or serious adverse effects for any particular form of insulin for nocturnal hypoglycemia, severe hypoglycemia, glycated hemoglobin A1c, non-fatal myocardial infarction/stroke, health-related quality of life or all-cause mortality. The same review did not find any differences in effects of using these insulin analogues between adults and children.

Most oral anti-diabetic agents are contraindicated in pregnancy, in which case insulin is preferred.

Insulin is not administered by other routes, although this has been studied. An inhaled form was briefly licensed but was subsequently withdrawn.

==Sensitizers==
Insulin sensitizers address the core problem in type 2 diabetes – insulin resistance.

===Biguanides===

Biguanides reduce hepatic glucose output and increase uptake of glucose by the periphery, including skeletal muscle. Although it must be used with caution in patients with impaired liver or kidney function, Metformin, a biguanide, has become the most commonly used agent for type 2 diabetes in children and teenagers. Among common diabetic drugs, Metformin is the only widely used oral drug that does not cause weight gain.

Typical reduction in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values for Metformin is 1.5–2.0%
* Metformin (Glucophage) may be the best choice for patients who also have heart failure, but it should be temporarily discontinued before any radiographic procedure involving intravenous iodinated contrast, as patients are at an increased risk of lactic acidosis.
* Phenformin (DBI) was used from 1960s through 1980s, but was withdrawn due to lactic acidosis risk.
* Buformin also was withdrawn due to lactic acidosis risk.

Metformin is a first-line medication used for treatment of type 2 diabetes. It is generally prescribed at initial diagnosis in conjunction with exercise and weight loss, as opposed to the past, where it was prescribed after diet and exercise had failed. There is an immediate-release as well as an extended-release formulation, typically reserved for patients experiencing gastrointestinal side-effects. It is also available in combination with other oral diabetic medications.

===Thiazolidinediones===

Thiazolidinediones (TZDs), also known as &quot;glitazones,&quot; bind to PPARγ, peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ, a type of nuclear regulatory protein involved in the transcription of genes that regulate glucose and fat metabolism. These PPARs act on peroxisome proliferator responsive elements (PPRE). The PPREs influence insulin-sensitive genes, which enhance production of mRNAs of insulin-dependent enzymes. The final result is better use of glucose by the cells. These drugs also enhance PPAR-α activity and hence lead to a rise in HDL and some larger components of LDL.

Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values are 1.5–2.0%. Some examples are:
* Rosiglitazone (Avandia): the European Medicines Agency recommended in September 2010 that it be suspended from the EU market due to elevated cardiovascular risks.
* Pioglitazone (Actos): remains on the market but has also been associated with increased cardiovascular risks.
* Troglitazone (Rezulin): used in 1990s, withdrawn due to hepatitis and liver damage risk.

Multiple retrospective studies have resulted in a concern about rosiglitazone&#x27;s safety, although it is established that the group, as a whole, has beneficial effects on diabetes. The greatest concern is an increase in the number of severe cardiac events in patients taking it. The ADOPT study showed that initial therapy with drugs of this type may prevent the progression of disease, as did the DREAM trial. The American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists (AACE), which provides clinical practice guidelines for management of diabetes, retains thiazolidinediones as recommended first, second, or third line agents for type 2 diabetes mellitus, as of their 2019 executive summary, over sulfonylureas and α-glucosidase inhibitors. However, they are less preferred than GLP-1 agonists or SGLT2 inhibitors, especially in patients with cardiovascular disease (which liraglutide, empagliflozin, and canagliflozin are all FDA approved to treat).

Concerns about the safety of rosiglitazone arose when a retrospective meta-analysis was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. There have been a significant number of publications since then, and a Food and Drug Administration panel voted, with some controversy, 20:3 that available studies &quot;supported a signal of harm&quot;, but voted 22:1 to keep the drug on the market. The meta-analysis was not supported by an interim analysis of the trial designed to evaluate the issue, and several other reports have failed to conclude the controversy. This weak evidence for adverse effects has reduced the use of rosiglitazone, despite its important and sustained effects on glycemic control. Safety studies are continuing.

In contrast, at least one large prospective study, PROactive 05, has shown that pioglitazone may decrease the overall incidence of cardiac events in people with type 2 diabetes who have already had a heart attack.

===LYN Kinase Activators===
The LYN kinase activator Tolimidone has been reported to potentiate insulin signaling in a manner that is distinct from the glitazones. The compound has demonstrated positive results in a Phase 2a clinical study involving 130 diabetic subjects.

==Secretagogues==
Secretagogues are drugs that increase output from a gland, in the case of insulin from the pancreas.

===Sulfonylureas===

Sulfonylureas were the first widely used oral anti-hyperglycemic medications. They are &quot;insulin secretagogues&quot;, triggering insulin release by inhibiting the KATP channel of the pancreatic beta cells. Eight types of these pills have been marketed in North America, but not all remain available. The &quot;second-generation&quot; sulfonylureas are now more commonly used. They are more effective than first-generation drugs and have fewer side-effects. All may cause weight gain.

Current clinical practice guidelines from the AACE rate sulfonylureas (as well as glinides) below all other classes of antidiabetic drugs in terms of suggested use as first, second, or third line agents - this includes Bromocriptine, the bile acid sequestrant Colesevelam, α-glucosidase inhibitors, Thiazolidinediones (glitazones), and DPP-4 inhibitors (gliptins). The low cost of most sulfonylureas, however, especially when considering their significant efficacy in blood glucose reduction, tends to keep them as a more feasible option in many patients - neither SGLT2 inhibitors nor GLP-1 agonists, the classes most favored by the AACE guidelines after metformin, are currently available as generics.

Sulfonylureas bind strongly to plasma proteins. Sulfonylureas are useful only in type 2 diabetes, as they work by stimulating endogenous release of insulin. They work best with patients over 40 years old who have had diabetes mellitus for under ten years. They cannot be used with type 1 diabetes, or diabetes of pregnancy. They can be safely used with metformin or glitazones. The primary side-effect is hypoglycemia, which appears to happen more commonly with sulfonylureas than with other treatments.

A Cochrane systematic review from 2011 showed that treatment with Sulfonylureas did not improve control of glucose levels more than insulin at 3 nor 12 months of treatment. This same review actually found evidence that treatment with Sulfonylureas could lead to earlier insulin dependence, with 30% of cases requiring insulin at 2 years. When studies measured fasting C-peptide, no intervention influenced its concentration, but insulin maintained concentration better compared to Sulphonylurea. Still, it is important to highlight that the studies available to be included in this review presented considerable flaws in quality and design.

Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values for second-generation sulfonylureas are 1.0–2.0%.
* First-generation agents
** tolbutamide
** acetohexamide
** tolazamide
** chlorpropamide
* Second-generation agents
** glipizide
** glyburide or glibenclamide
** glimepiride
** gliclazide
** glyclopyramide
** gliquidone

===Meglitinides===

Meglitinides help the pancreas produce insulin and are often called &quot;short-acting secretagogues.&quot; They act on the same potassium channels as sulfonylureas, but at a different binding site. By closing the potassium channels of the pancreatic beta cells, they open the calcium channels, thereby enhancing insulin secretion.

They are taken with or shortly before meals to boost the insulin response to each meal. If a meal is skipped, the medication is also skipped. 

Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%. 
* repaglinide
* nateglinide

Adverse reactions include weight gain and hypoglycemia.

==Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors==
Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors are a class of diabetes drugs found in plants/herbs like cinnamon; however, they are technically not hypoglycemic agents because they do not have a direct effect on insulin secretion or sensitivity. These agents slow the digestion of starch in the small intestine, such that glucose from the starch enters the bloodstream at a slower rate, and can be matched more effectively by an impaired insulin response or sensitivity. The intake of a single dose before a meal containing complex carbohydrates clearly suppresses the glucose spike and may decrease the postprandial hyperglycemia (higher than 140 mg/dL; &gt;7.8 mmol/L) in patients with type II diabetes. These agents are effective by themselves only in the earliest stages of impaired glucose tolerance, but can be helpful in combination with other agents in type 2 diabetes.

Typical reductions in glycated hemoglobin (A1C) values are 0.5–1.0%.
* miglitol
* acarbose
* voglibose
These medications are rarely used in the United States because of the severity of their side-effects (flatulence and bloating). They are more commonly prescribed in Europe. They do have the potential to cause weight loss by lowering the amount of sugar metabolized.

==Peptide analogs==

===Injectable incretin mimetics===
Incretins are also insulin secretagogues. The two main candidate molecules that fulfill criteria for being an incretin are glucagon-like peptide-1 (GLP-1) and gastric inhibitory peptide (glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide, GIP). Both GLP-1 and GIP are rapidly inactivated by the enzyme dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4).

====Injectable glucagon-like peptide analogs and agonists====
Glucagon-like peptide (GLP) agonists bind to a membrane GLP receptor. As a consequence, insulin release from the pancreatic beta cells is increased. Endogenous GLP has a half-life of only a few minutes, thus an analogue of GLP would not be practical. As of 2019, the AACE lists GLP-1 agonists, along with SGLT2 inhibitors, as the most preferred anti-diabetic agents after metformin. Liraglutide in particular may be considered first-line in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease, as it has received FDA approval for reduction of risk of major adverse cardiovascular events in patients with type 2 diabetes. In a 2011 Cochrane review, GLP-1 agonists showed approximately a 1% reduction in HbA1c when compared to placebo. GLP-1 agonists also show improvement of beta-cell function, but this effect does not last after treatment is stopped. Due to shorter duration of studies, this review did not allow for long-term positive or negative effects to be assessed.
* Exenatide (also Exendin-4, marketed as Byetta) is the first GLP-1 agonist approved for the treatment of type 2 diabetes. Exenatide is not an analogue of GLP but rather a GLP agonist. Exenatide has only 53% homology with GLP, which increases its resistance to degradation by DPP-4 and extends its half-life. A 2011 Cochrane review showed a HbA1c reduction of 0.20% more with Exenatide 2 mg compared to insulin glargine, exenatide 10 μg twice daily, sitagliptin and pioglitazone. Exenatide, together with liraglutide, led to greater weight loss than glucagon-like peptide analogues.
* Liraglutide, a once-daily human analogue (97% homology), has been developed by Novo Nordisk under the brand name Victoza. The product was approved by the European Medicines Agency (EMEA) on July 3, 2009, and by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) on January 25, 2010. A 2011 Cochrane review showed a HbA1c reduction of 0.24% more with liraglutide 1.8 mg compared to insulin glargine, 0.33% more than exenatide 10 μg twice daily, sitagliptin and rosiglitazone. Liraglutide, together with exenatide, led to greater weight loss than glucagon-like peptide analogues.
* Taspoglutide is presently in Phase III clinical trials with Hoffman-La Roche.
* Lixisenatide (Lyxumia) Sanofi Aventis
* Semaglutide (Ozempic) (oral version is Rybelsus)
* Dulaglutide (Trulicity) - once weekly
* Albiglutide (Tanzeum) - once weekly
* Tirzepatide (dual GLP-1 and GIP agonist; manufactured by Eli Lilly, and approved in 2022. It is Marketed under brandname Mounjaro for type II diabetes, and Zepbound for obesity
These agents may also cause a decrease in gastric motility, responsible for the common side-effect of nausea, which tends to subside with time.

====Gastric inhibitory peptide analogs====

====Dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors====

GLP-1 analogs resulted in weight loss and had more gastrointestinal side-effects, while in general dipeptidyl peptidase-4 (DPP-4) inhibitors were weight-neutral and are associated with increased risk for infection and headache. Both classes appear to present an alternative to other antidiabetic drugs. However, weight gain and/or hypoglycemia have been observed when dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors were used with sulfonylureas; effects on long-term health and morbidity rates are still unknown.

DPP-4 inhibitors increase blood concentration of the incretin GLP-1 by inhibiting its degradation by DPP-4.

Examples are:
* vildagliptin (Galvus) EU Approved 2008
* sitagliptin (Januvia) FDA approved Oct 2006
* saxagliptin (Onglyza) FDA Approved July 2009
* linagliptin (Tradjenta) FDA Approved May 2, 2011
* alogliptin
* septagliptin
* teneligliptin
* gemigliptin (Zemiglo)

DPP-4 inhibitors lowered hemoglobin A1C values by 0.74%, comparable to other antidiabetic drugs.

A result in one RCT comprising 206 patients aged 65 or older (mean baseline HgbA1c of 7.8%) receiving either 50 or 100 mg/d of sitagliptin was shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.7% (combined result of both doses). A combined result of 5 RCTs enlisting a total of 279 patients aged 65 or older (mean baseline HbA1c of 8%) receiving 5 mg/d of saxagliptin was shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.73%. A combined result of 5 RCTs enlisting a total of 238 patients aged 65 or older (mean baseline HbA1c of 8.6%) receiving 100 mg/d of vildagliptin was shown to reduce HbA1c by 1.2%. Another set of 6 combined RCTs involving alogliptin (approved by FDA in 2013) was shown to reduce HbA1c by 0.73% in 455 patients aged 65 or older who received 12.5 or 25 mg/d of the medication.

===Injectable amylin analogues===

Amylin agonist analogues slow gastric emptying and suppress glucagon. They have all the incretins actions except stimulation of insulin secretion. , pramlintide is the only clinically available amylin analogue. Like insulin, it is administered by subcutaneous injection. The most frequent and severe adverse effect of pramlintide is nausea, which occurs mostly at the beginning of treatment and gradually reduces. Typical reductions in A1C values are 0.5–1.0%.

==SGLT2 inhibitors==

SGLT2 inhibitors block the sodium-glucose linked transporter 2 proteins in renal tubules of nephrons in kidneys, reabsorption of glucose in into the renal tubules, promoting excretion of glucose in the urine. This causes both mild weight loss, and a mild reduction in blood sugar levels with little risk of hypoglycemia. Oral preparations may be available alone or in combination with other agents. Along with GLP-1 agonists, they are considered preferred second or third agents for type 2 diabetics sub-optimally controlled with metformin alone, according to most recent clinical practice guidelines. Because they are taken by mouth, rather than injected (like GLP-1 agonists), patients who are injection-averse may prefer these agents over the former. They may be considered first line in diabetic patients with cardiovascular disease, especially heart failure, as these medications have been shown to reduce the risk of hospitalization in patients with such comorbidities. Because they are not available as generic medications, however, cost may limit their feasibility for many patients. Furthermore, there has been growing evidence that the effectiveness and safety of this drug class could depend on genetic variability of the patients.

Examples include:
* Dapagliflozin
* Canagliflozin
* Empagliflozin
* Remogliflozin

The side effects of SGLT2 inhibitors are derived directly from their mechanism of action; these include an increased risk of: ketoacidosis, urinary tract infections, candidal vulvovaginitis, and hypoglycemia.

==Comparison==
The following table compares some common anti-diabetic agents, generalizing classes, although there may be substantial variation in individual drugs of each class. When the table makes a comparison such as &quot;lower risk&quot; or &quot;more convenient&quot; the comparison is with the other drugs on the table.

==Generics==
Many anti-diabetes drugs are available as generics. These include:
* Sulfonylureas – glimepiride, glipizide, glyburide
* Biguanides – metformin
* Thiazolidinediones (Tzd) – pioglitazone, Actos generic
* Alpha-glucosidase inhibitors – Acarbose
* Meglitinides – nateglinide
* Combination of sulfonylureas plus metformin – known by generic names of the two drugs
No generics are available for dipeptidyl peptidase-4 inhibitors (Onglyza), the glifozins, the incretins and various combinations. Sitagliptin patent expired in July 2022, leading to launch of generic sitagliptin brands . This lowered the cost of therapy for type 2 diabetes using sitagliptin .

== Alternative Medicine ==
The effect of Ayurvedic treatments has been researched, however due to methodological flaws of relevant studies and research, it has not been possible to draw conclusions regarding efficacy of these treatments and there is insufficient evidence to recommend them.

<text>Luther Roderick Campbell (born December 22, 1960), also known as Luke Skyywalker, Uncle Luke and simply Luke, is an American rapper, promoter, record executive, actor, and former leader of the rap group 2 Live Crew. He is known for having helped create the Miami bass genre, for establishing one of the first rap groups and rap labels in Southern hip hop, and his sexually crude call and response lyrics which were unique for the time period. He also starred in a short-lived show on VH1, &quot;Luke&#x27;s Parental Advisory&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Luther Campbell was born on December 22, 1960, in Miami. His mother was a beautician of Bahamian ancestry and his father was a custodian of Jamaican ancestry. He was the youngest of five sons and was named after Martin Luther King Jr. He was raised Catholic.

After graduating from Miami Beach Senior High School in 1979, Campbell was asked by his mother to leave the house every weekday from 8:30am to 4:30pm regardless of his employment status.

In the early 1980s, Campbell worked as a cook at Mount Sinai Hospital in Miami Beach and as a concert promoter in Miami, bringing rap groups of that era to Miami. In 1983, he also enrolled in an eight-week study course at Miami public radio station WDNA, where he learned basic audio editing and production techniques.

In 1984, Campbell took notice of a single from California named &quot;Revelation&quot; by 2 Live Crew, which consisted of two rappers (Fresh Kid Ice and Amazing V) and a DJ (Mr. Mixx). The single was a hit on the South Florida club circuit, and Campbell decided to bring them from California to Miami for a performance. He took a special interest in the group and began managing them.

2 Live Crew eventually fully relocated to Florida without Amazing Vee and in 1986, 2 Live Crew recorded &quot;Throw the D&quot; with &quot;Ghetto Bass&quot; on the B-side, they went into a joint venture with Campbell to start Luke Skyywalker Records, which was also his first MC name.

In April of that year, Brother Marquis joined the group in Miami. Campbell gave The 2 Live Crew a record deal and officially joined the group. They exploded on the local scene with their gold-selling debut album, &quot;The 2 Live Crew Is What We Are&quot; (1986). This made Luke Skyyywalker and his bandmates rap superstars in south Florida.

In 1988, the group released their second album, &quot;Move Somethin″&quot;. It was certified Gold and featured the singles &quot;Move Somethin&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Do Wah Diddy Diddy&quot;. The album improved on the charts from the previous album, making it to #68 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #20 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip Hop Albums chart.

Campbell decided to sell a separate clean version in addition to the explicit version of the album. A record store clerk in Alexander City, Alabama, was cited for selling a copy to an undercover police officer in 1988. It was the first time in the United States that a store owner was held liable for obscenity over music. The charges were dropped after a jury found the owner not guilty.

Their third album &quot;As Nasty as They Wanna Be&quot; (1989) became the group&#x27;s largest seller, being certified platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America. In 1990, the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida ruled that the album was legally obscene; this ruling was later overturned by the Eleventh Circuit. It is the first album in history to be deemed legally obscene. An obscenity trial followed, in which Henry Louis Gates, Jr., addressed the court on behalf of the defendants, all of whom were eventually acquitted.

====University of Miami &quot;pay-for-play&quot; allegations====
Campbell was also infamous in the late 1980s and early 1990s for his association with the University of Miami football team. Campbell was alleged to have been behind what was referred to as a &quot;pay-for-play&quot; system, which involved cash rewards for acts such as scoring touchdowns and big hits, although Campbell has never actually donated to the University of Miami or its athletics department. 

In 1993, Campbell threatened to go public with various alleged violations by the university&#x27;s athletic department and its football program if Ryan Collins, a black player on the team, wasn&#x27;t named starting quarterback that season.

===1990s===
1990 saw the release of &quot;Banned in the U.S.A.&quot;, originally credited as Campbell&#x27;s solo album featuring 2 Live Crew and in later editions credited as a 2 Live Crew album. The album included the hits &quot;Do the Bart&quot; and the title track. It was also the very first release to bear the RIAA-standard Parental Advisory warning sticker. It peaked at number 20 on the Hot 100.

The eponymous title single is a reference to the decision in a court case that the group&#x27;s album &quot;As Nasty as They Wanna Be&quot; was obscene. Bruce Springsteen granted the group permission to interpolate his song &quot;Born in the U.S.A.&quot; for it.

Displeased over the decision of Florida Governor Bob Martinez who, on being asked to examine the album, decided it was obscene and recommended local law enforcement take action against it and over the subsequent action of Broward County, Florida, sheriff Nick Navarro, who arrested local record-store owners on obscenity charges for selling the group&#x27;s albums and the subsequent arrest of members of the group on obscenity charges, the group included the song &quot;Fuck Martinez&quot;, which also includes multiple repetitions of the phrase &quot;fuck Navarro&quot;. The group found two other men with the same names, and had them sign releases, as they thought that this action would make it impossible for Martinez or Navarro to sue them.

That same year they released &quot;Live in Concert&quot;, the group&#x27;s first and only live album, and their fifth record overall. It was released under the Effect subsidiary label of Luke Records, a move that was deemed necessary for the company to be able to release additional 2 Live Crew material outside of their distribution deal with Atlantic Records. The album peaked at number 46 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

&quot;Sports Weekend: As Nasty as They Wanna Be, Pt. 2&quot; (1991) is the sixth album overall and fifth studio album by the 2 Live Crew. A clean version was released later that same year titled &quot;Sports Weekend: As Clean as They Wanna Be Part II&quot; and was the sequel of &quot;As Clean as They Wanna Be&quot;. This would be the last studio album by all original members of the 2 Live Crew.

In 1992, &quot;I Got Shit on My Mind&quot; was released. It was his first official solo album without The 2 Live Crew. It peaked at #52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart and #20 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart. It was the album that spawned the hit single &quot;I Wanna Rock&quot; (better known more prominently as &quot;Doo-Doo Brown&quot;), which became Campbell&#x27;s signature song. Upon its initial release in 1992, the song did not garner much attention until the following year, when it became a runaway hit, and charted at 73 on the Hot 100.

June 8, 1993 saw the release of his third solo album &quot;In the Nude&quot;. It was another success, reaching #54 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #8 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

One of The 2 Live Crew’s songs, which used a parody of Roy Orbison&#x27;s &quot;Oh, Pretty Woman&quot;, was the subject of a 1993-1994 lawsuit, &quot;Campbell v. Acuff-Rose Music, Inc.&quot;, which was argued in front of the U.S. Supreme Court. The &quot;Miami New Times&quot; described Campbell as &quot;the man whose booty-shaking madness once made the U.S. Supreme Court stand up for free speech&quot;.

In 1994, he reunited with Fresh Kid Ice, and a local rapper named Verb made an album under the banner The New 2 Live Crew. It is the last 2 Live Crew related project to feature him. The album became a moderate hit, peaking at #52 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #9 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, as well as producing two charting singles, &quot;Hell, Yeah&quot; and &quot;You Go Girl&quot; who were both made into music videos.

&quot;Freak for Life&quot; is Campbell&#x27;s fourth album. It was released on July 12, 1994, through Luke Records. &quot;Freak for Life&quot; peaked at #174 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #24 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums, making it his lowest charting album at the time. One single found mild success, &quot;It&#x27;s Your Birthday&quot; peaked at #33 on the Hot Rap Singles and #91 on the Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Singles &amp; Tracks.

Also in 1994, Campbell co-founded &quot;Liberty City Optimists&quot;, an inner city youth sports program. One of his notable apprentices is Devonta Freeman, who went on to play college football for Florida State Seminoles, rival of the Hurricanes.

Campbell and his label, Luke Records, Inc. went bankrupt in 1995 and sold their catalogs to Joseph Weinberger and Lil&#x27; Joe Records, Inc. in 1996.

&quot;Uncle Luke&quot; was released on May 14, 1996, on Luther Campbell Music and was mainly produced by Darren &quot;DJ Spin&quot; Rudnick, and Rod XL, with additional production by Frankie Cutlass, Ice Cube and Doug E. Fresh. &quot;Uncle Luke&quot; was a success, peaking at #51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and #8 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and spawned a single, &quot;Scarred&quot;, which made it to #64 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #7 on the Hot Rap Singles, the song was also turned into a Video.

&quot;Changin&#x27; the Game&quot; is the sixth album released by Campbell. It was released on November 11, 1997, on the Island Black Music label in collaboration with Luke Records and featured production from Campbell, Rod XL, Lil&#x27; Jon and Louis &quot;Ugly&quot; Howard. Though the album was met with some positive reviews, the album was a flop and remains Campbell&#x27;s lowest charting album, only making it to #49 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. However, the single &quot;Raise the Roof&quot; found great success peaking at #26 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and #1 on the Hot Rap Singles. The song helped to popularize the arm gesture by the same name which involved repeatedly extending ones arms upwards with the palms of the hands also facing upwards. The song is also featured in the compilation album &quot;Jock Jams Volume 4&quot;.

In 1998 he played a supporting role in the movie &quot;Ride&quot; a comedy film written and directed by Millicent Shelton. It stars Malik Yoba, Fredro Starr, and Melissa De Sousa. Also that year he made a special cameo appearance in Ice Cube&#x27;s &quot;The Players Club&quot;. The comedy/drama film stars Bernie Mac, Monica Calhoun, Jamie Foxx, John Amos, A. J. Johnson, Alex Thomas, Charlie Murphy, Terrence Howard, Faizon Love and LisaRaye.

===2000s===
&quot;Somethin&#x27; Nasty&quot; is the seventh album released by Campbell. It was released on March 13, 2001, on Luke Records through Koch Records&#x27; short-lived independent label distribution unit, KELA (Koch Entertainment Label Alliance) and featured production by Campbell&#x27;s former 2 Live Crew bandmate, Mr. Mixx, Daz Dillinger, Gorilla Tek, and Campbell himself. The album found minor success, peaking at #149 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, #36 on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and #6 on the Top Independent Albums.

Campbell&#x27;s last release, &quot;My Life &amp; Freaky Times&quot;, was released in March 2006, and peaked at 32 at the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums. The first singles serviced to radio were &quot;Holla at Cha Homeboy&quot;, featuring Pitbull &amp; Petey Pablo, and the reggaeton-leaning &quot;Pop That&quot; by Plan B and Rey Chester Secretweapon.

That same year, Campbell appeared in &quot;Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories&quot; as DJ Luke for the hip-hop station Fresh 105 FM. Campbell hosts a sports talk show on Miami&#x27;s 790 The Ticket with former football player Terry Kirby on Saturdays.

Campbell has previously entered the adult film industry and cites on his MySpace page the need to clean up the &quot;sometimes amateurish new courtship of Hip-Hop and Adult Entertainment&quot;. He produced the adult entertainment movie &quot;Luke&#x27;s Bachelor Party&quot; in 2007.

In December 2007, Campbell launched The Luke Entertainment Group and took the company public trading under the symbol LKEN on Pink Sheets.

In 2008, he starred in his own short-lived show on VH1, &quot;Luke&#x27;s Parental Advisory&quot;.

Campbell was interviewed about his involvement with the University of Miami football program for the documentary &quot;The U&quot;, which premiered December 12, 2009, as part of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;30 for 30&quot; series.

In 2010, he briefly reunited with Fresh Kid Ice, Brother Marquis, and Mr. Mixx as the 2 Live Crew were honorees winners at the 2010 &quot;VH1 Hip-Hop Honors: The Dirty South Edition.&quot;

On February 2, 2011, Campbell announced his intention to run for mayor of Miami-Dade County on a platform that includes making housing projects safer, transparency in local government, and taxing strippers. He came in fourth in a field of 11 candidates, winning 11% of the vote.

By Thanksgiving 2014, Campbell reunited with 2 Live Crew (Fresh Kid Ice and Brother Marquis) for a series of shows until 2015.

==Personal life==
On February 18, 2009, Campbell was arrested for falling behind on child support payments. He allegedly has 6 or 7 kids, each of whom is from a different mother. 

In February 2010, Campbell became a columnist for &quot;Miami New Times&quot;, an alternative weekly newspaper distributed in the Miami metropolitan area. Campbell&#x27;s column, called &quot;Luke&#x27;s Gospel&quot;, provides &quot;a forum for his crazy-ass views on current events,&quot; which include politics, sports and entertainment. He is quoted on the &quot;Miami New Times&quot; website as saying, &quot;It&#x27;s the perfect place for me. I am a free-speech guy. It&#x27;s just a match made in Heaven. Can you believe it? Me turned loose on the world in &quot;New Times&quot;. Wow.&quot;

<text>Streaming Transformations for XML (STX) is an XML transformation language intended as a high-speed, low memory consumption alternative to XSLT version 1.0 and 2.0. Current work on XSLT 3.0 includes Streaming capabilities.

== Overview ==

STX is an XML standard for efficient processing of stream-based XML. Basic XSLT is not well suited to stream based processing, and STX fills this niche.

Conventional XML processing involves loading the entire XML document into memory for use. In contrast, SAX streams XML events such as &quot;open element,&quot; &quot;close element,&quot; and &quot;text node&quot; so that other software can begin interpreting information immediately, before the end of the file is reached. Unfortunately some software can&#x27;t effectively use XML fragments this way and must build up the whole document to begin processing. So is the case with XSLT. Because XSLT&#x27;s XPath can select any node throughout the document it must have the entire document available in memory.

STX only allows queries immediately surrounding the current node so it can quickly start transforming and outputting SAX event nodes as they arrive. As it can discard nodes immediately after processing, memory use is significantly lower than that of XSLT. Having a limited query scope is a defining characteristic of STX.

This architectural decision intentionally marginalises STX as a niche language. Indeed, it would be wrong to say that STX is a general purpose transformation language; however, if your transformation needs can be met by STX then it&#x27;s an efficient and smart choice.

== Specifications ==

STX&#x27;s query language is called STXPath and is based on XPath 2.0.

Implementations of STX are available in Java and Perl.

== Similar projects ==

Unlike STX which is declared using an XML syntax, these two projects associate SAX events with callback functions:

<text>HaXml is a collection of utilities for parsing, filtering, transforming, and generating Extensible Markup Language (XML) documents using the programming language Haskell.

== Overview ==
HaXml utilities include:
* XML parser
* XML validator
* a separate error-correcting parser for HTML
* pretty-printers for XML and HTML
* stream parser for XML events
* translator from DTD to Haskell
* translator from XML Schema definitions to Haskell data types

HaXml provides a combinator library with a set of higher-order functions which process the XML documents after they are represented using the native Haskell data types. The basic data type is codice_1 which represents the document subset of XML.

HaXml allows converting XML to Haskell data and vice versa, and XML to XML (by transforming or filtering). The common use of the HaXml&#x27;s parser includes defining the method of traversing the XML data and it has the codice_2 type (&quot;content filter&quot;), where codice_3. It means that this function defined by the user will take a fragment of an XML data and either return more fragments or none at all. This approach allows to choose XML elements satisfying certain conditions (e.g., tags with certain name or all children of a specified tag).

== Example ==
In the chapter 22 &quot;Extended Example: Web Client Programming&quot; of the Real World Haskell by Bryan O&#x27;Sullivan, Don Stewart, and John Goerzen, the following example is considered. The XML file looks like this (simplified version):
&lt;?xml version=&quot;1.0&quot; encoding=&quot;UTF-8&quot;?&gt;
&lt;rss xmlns:itunes=&quot;http://www.itunes.com/DTDs/Podcast-1.0.dtd&quot; version=&quot;2.0&quot;&gt;
 &lt;channel&gt;
 &lt;title&gt;Haskell Radio&lt;/title&gt;
 &lt;link&gt;http://www.example.com/radio/&lt;/link&gt;
 &lt;description&gt;Description of this podcast&lt;/description&gt;
 &lt;item&gt;First item&lt;/item&gt;
 &lt;item&gt;Second item&lt;/item&gt;
 &lt;/channel&gt;
&lt;/rss&gt;
The following content filter is constructed:
channel :: CFilter
channel = tag &quot;rss&quot; /&gt; tag &quot;channel&quot;
This filter is later used to get the title of the channel:
getTitle :: Content -&gt; String
getTitle doc = contentToStringDefault &quot;Untitled Podcast&quot; (channel /&gt; tag &quot;title&quot; /&gt; txt $ doc)

<text>is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Osamu Tezuka in the 1970s, dealing with the medical adventures of the title character, doctor Black Jack. &quot;Black Jack&quot; consists of hundreds of short, self-contained stories that are typically about 20 pages long. &quot;Black Jack&quot; has also been animated into an OVA, two television series (directed by Satoshi Kuwahara and Tezuka&#x27;s son Makoto Tezuka) and two films.

In 1977, it won the first Kodansha Manga Award for the &quot;shōnen&quot; category. It has since then become one of Tezuka&#x27;s best selling manga with over 47.66 million copies sold in Japan. Osamu Dezaki&#x27;s anime film adaptation, &quot;Black Jack: The Movie&quot;, won Best Animation Film at the 1996 Mainichi Film Awards.

==Plot==
Most of the stories involve Black Jack doing some good deed, for which he rarely gets recognition—often curing the poor and destitute for free, or teaching the arrogant a lesson in humility. They sometimes end with a good, humane person enduring hardship, often unavoidable death, to save others.

==Characters==

===Main characters===
; Black Jack &quot;aka&quot; Kurō Hazama

* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 1: &quot;Is there a Doctor?&quot;
* Voiced by: Yūko Mizutani
* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: &quot;Teratogenous Cystoma&quot;
Pinoko is Black Jack&#x27;s loyal assistant/adopted daughter, who was actually a Teratogenous Cystoma (a growth more commonly known as a teratoma). She was a rare type of parasitic twin, living as part of a patients&#x27; body for eighteen years. When the presence of the twin was evidenced from a grotesque distortion in the host&#x27;s body, Black Jack was contracted to extract and dispose of the growth. In the end, he found the cystoma, although a collection of uncontained organs and muscles, was complete in design if not form. Using life support to maintain them, Black Jack encased the assembly in an artificially constructed exoskeleton sized and shaped in the form of a female human child (around 7 or 8 years). Miraculously, the homunculus survived with all sensory reception intact. Developing into a sentient though permanently child-sized life form, she was adopted by Black Jack as his informal ward. Pinoko always helps the doctor by doing household chores and by being his assistant in some of his operations. She often acts as comic relief in &quot;Black Jack&quot;, claiming to be a girl of eighteen years of age and married to Black Jack, despite her childlike appearance and personality. Her main value is companionship and source of affection for the ordinarily cold-natured doctor. When she started living with Black Jack, she could not cook, clean, or take care of the house; she could not even walk, let alone move. Eventually, she learned through hard effort. Being still a child, she occasionally makes accidental errors, such as using salt instead of sugar while preparing meals. Black Jack thinks of her as his daughter while she thinks of herself as his wife. Black Jack modeled her face after a cute girl he had seen in a medical journal who suffers from a lung ailment of unknown origin (from Volume 7 Chapter 4: &quot;The Two Pinokos&quot;). Pinoko&#x27;s life has been put in danger a few times; she was kidnapped (Volume 2 Chapter 8: &quot;Kidnapping&quot;, Volume 14 Chapter 2: &quot;The Third Call&quot;, Volume 15 Chapter 1: &quot;Treasure Island&quot;), swallowed a potassium cyanide pill (Volume 4 Chapter 12: &quot;Gas&quot;), hit by a bullet (Volume 7 Chapter 10: &quot;Black and White&quot;), crashed a car (Volume 8 Chapter 8: &quot;A Visit from a Killer&quot;), and caught an aggressive form of leukemia (Volume 9 Chapter 2: &quot;Pinoko Lives&quot;). Pinoko says she is 18 years old because that is how long she was in her sister&#x27;s body, but Black Jack says she is 0-years-old when he built her. Because of that, she sometimes acts like an adult while other times as a 7-year-old. She cries when she is injured or throws things when she is mad. She is sometimes seen drawing pictures, playing games, or reading children&#x27;s stories. Throughout the whole manga series, she is never seen going to school, but has school-aged friends such as Hosuke Sharaku. She aspires to go to school like others her size, and thought about taking the high school entrance exam. Black Jack never tries to give Pinoko an 18-year-old body even though she wants to be bigger. She almost received one when she nearly died in Volume 9 Chapter 2: &quot;Pinoko Lives&quot;. She sometimes talks in third-person, using &quot;Pinoko&quot; instead of &quot;I&quot;, &quot;me&quot;, or &quot;my&quot;. Before Black Jack extracted her from her twin, she temporarily had the ability to telepathically communicate; this characteristic saved her life in that Black Jack recognized her body was alive. As well, in Volume 13 Chapter 4: &quot;Teratoid Cystoma, Part 2&quot;, she was able to talk to a teratoid cystoma in a patient in her sleep. Pinoko&#x27;s main form of comic relief is yelling アッチョンブリケ(&quot;Acchonburike&quot;)—a phrase that has no real meaning but taken as a rough equivalent to &quot;Oh my goodness!&quot; (often spelled &quot;Omigewdness&quot; in fansubs) or &quot;I don&#x27;t believe it!&quot; (as translated when she appeared in an episode of the Astro Boy 80s series), in English—while pressing her cheeks together with her hands when something surprising happens. In the 2004 English dub of the anime, she shouts &quot;Allamoby!&quot; Also, she says Aramanchu!, which has no real meaning, but can be roughly translated as &quot;okey dokey!&quot;. Her name is derived from Pinocchio and the game pinochle.

===Supporting characters===
* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 3: &quot;Teratoid Cystoma&quot;
The twin sister of Pinoko, whose name is only revealed in the OVA. She does not like the fact that her teratoid cystoma is actually her twin sister. She would always look away and say that that &quot;thing&quot; is not her sister. Her face and background is never revealed until Volume 17 Chapter 10: &quot;A Visiting Memory&quot;. Her second appearance is in Volume 9 Chapter 2: &quot;Pinoko Lives&quot; where she donates some of her blood to Pinoko. She expresses hope that this would be the last time she would have to be involved with her, as she is engaged to be married. Her third appearance is in Volume 17 Chapter 10: &quot;A Visiting Memory&quot; where her face and background are finally revealed. Dr. Crab tells Black Jack that she is actually the daughter of an important Buddhist line. She was constrained by pedigree and form. The family is always churning in drama, and she ended up deeply depressed. Then she tries to commit suicide by jumping from the third floor of her house. She survived and, with a huge amount of cash and amnesia, ended up at Black Jack&#x27;s house. Pinoko and her had a sisterly bond despite neither knowing the identity of the other. When she saw Dr. Crab, her memories returned and she quickly departed, having remembered the nature of her relationship to Pinoko. Pinoko did not know who she really was; Black Jack did.
* Voiced by: Osamu Saka
* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 5: &quot;Sometimes like Pearls&quot;
The reason why Black Jack pursued a career in medicine is because of Dr. Honma, his mentor and life-saver, who acted as the young boy&#x27;s father-figure. Kagemitsu Hazama, Black Jack&#x27;s real father, left his wife and son to live in Macau with his new wife Renka. As a child, Black Jack suffered from paralysis in all four limbs and spent many lonely years in a wheelchair until he regained the use of them. Dr. Honma wrote a book about this miracle, as depicted in Volume 1 Chapter 11: &quot;The Legs of an Ant&quot;. The medical community accused him of conducting a live experiment on a patient with a rare &quot;Honma&#x27;s Hematoma&quot; and killed the patient. He was then forced to retire. When he died, Black Jack went through Dr. Honma&#x27;s old files and found a letter addressed to him. Dr. Honma wanted Black Jack to find out the mystery of &quot;Honma&#x27;s Hematoma&quot;, but until he solve the mystery, to not operate on any patients who have it. Lumps of blood in the heart will form, even after many surgeries to get rid of them, they will come back. Because of that, many patients die of weak hearts. In Volume 13 Chapter 9: &quot;Honma&#x27;s Hematoma&quot;, Black Jack found the cure. The patient&#x27;s heart will be replaced with an artificial heart. But it turns out that &quot;Honma&#x27;s Hematoma&quot; is a disease caused by patients who already have artificial hearts. Dr. Honma dies of old age in the episode four of Black Jack 4 Miracles of Life &quot;Just like a Pearl&quot; after a failed surgical attempt to revive him. However, he plays an important role in Black Jack 21, since he had once worked at the &quot;Noir Project&quot;. In the manga, he dies in Volume 1 Chapter 5: &quot;Sometimes like Pearls.&quot; 
* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 6: &quot;Confluence&quot;
Megumi Kisaragi is Black Jack&#x27;s tragic love, whom he met and courted during their internship. Her first appearance was in Volume 1 Chapter 6: &quot;Confluence&quot; in the manga. She stayed up late at work and cared more about the patients than everyone else. She discovered that Kuroo Hazama had been the one looking after her whenever she walked alone at night. Later, she is revealed to have ovarian cancer, and is afraid to tell Black Jack because of her fear that having these parts removed will interfere with their relationship. Nevertheless, the couple confesses their love before the operation while Megumi is &quot;still a woman&quot; (in reality, a hysterectomy or oophorectomy can affect sexual function, but the side effects associated with these procedures are not as extreme as those depicted in this story).
* Afterwards, Megumi changed her name to Kei, a male name, and started living her life as a man, treating sick patients as a ship&#x27;s doctor.
* She is seen again in Volume 11 Chapter 14: &quot;The SL Called Life&quot; on the same train as Black Jack.
* First Appearance: Volume 1 Chapter 9: &quot;Black Queen&quot;
* First making her appearance in Volume 1 Chapter 9: &quot;Black Queen&quot;, Kuwata Konomi was a doctor specializing in amputations, thought to be heartless by many, earning her the nickname &#x27;Black Queen&#x27; in the medical world. She is engaged to Rock (referred to as Makube Rokuro in the TV series, probably to make up for the lack of &quot;Carved Seal&quot; episode), but her being infamous causes troubles for the couple. She met Black Jack, drunk, in a bar, naming herself as the Black Queen. The former is impressed by their similarities and falls in love with her, but he would eventually discover that Rock was her fiancé.
* She is seen again two years after her first appearance, now in Volume 5 Chapter 5: &quot;The Last Train&quot;. Her name is now Konomi Suzuki, after she married Rock. Half a year after Rock&#x27;s surgery, they got married. She got fired and left for a plane to meet her husband.
; Takashi
* Voiced by: Kazuki Yao

==Media==
===Manga===

The manga series was first serialized in Akita Shoten&#x27;s &quot;shōnen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Weekly Shōnen Champion&quot; from 1973 to 1983. Each of the 25 published &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes were divided into 12 to 15 chapters; each chapter is about 20-some pages long. The first episode was called &quot;I Need a Doctor!&quot;, and the last episode was called &quot;A Question of Priority&quot;. Most of the manga series had never been directly adapted into anime form until a Black Jack Special was aired in 2003, thus initiating the &quot;Black Jack&quot; anime series in 2004, and the &quot;Black Jack 21&quot; series in 2006.

Vertical Inc. has released translated volumes of the series in the United States, starting with Vol. 1 in September 2008 and finishing with Vol. 17 in November 2011. These collected volumes include a dozen or so stories each in the original unflipped format, and the stories will be published in the same order as the Japanese Black Jack collections. Vertical has also released limited editions of the first three volumes that include bonus stories not printed in any other edition.

Two translated volumes had been previously published by Viz Communications, but those editions are now out of print.

There is also a series called &quot;Black Jack ALIVE&quot; which was published in 2005, this series was created from numerous artists adding stories onto the original series. A chapter from this series was published in the last volume of &quot;Magetsukan Kitan&quot;. In 2013, he is celebrating his 40 anniversary since his first appearance, along with Princess Knight&#x27;s 60th, and Astro boy&#x27;s 50th.

A manga called &quot;Say Hello to Black Jack&quot; by Shūhō Satō has no connection with the &quot;Black Jack&quot; series, along with its sequel &quot;Shin Black Jack ni Yoroshiku&quot;.

A 2005 remake of the series was titled &quot;Black Jack – Kuroi Ishi&quot;.

Another manga called &quot;Black Jack NEO&quot; was published by a different author. It may be another remake. Not much information is known.

&quot;Young Black Jack&quot; is another manga, written by Yoshiaki Tabata and illustrated by Yūgo Ōkumaby, featuring Tezuka characters, that started in 2011 in the &quot;seinen&quot; manga magazine &quot;Young Champion&quot; and ended in 2019. The story follows Black Jack as a medical student in the 1960s.

In November 2023, a new 32-page manga co-produced by Tezuka Productions and AI was launched in Akita Shoten&#x27;s Weekly Shōnen Champion magazine, as a part of the &quot;TEZUKA2023&quot; project and to commemorate the Black Jack&#x27;s 50th anniversary. The project&#x27;s team selected the most suitable story and characters from a variety of options, which were generated by AI based on Tezuka&#x27;s works. Finally, a completely new story of the Black Jack manga, created collaboratively by both AI and humans, was published.

===Anime===
The first televised appearance of Black Jack was in the 1980 remake of &quot;Tetsuwan Atom&quot;. Episode 27 of &quot;Astro Boy&quot; brought together three separate Tezuka creations, as Astro, Uran, Doctor Roget (Black Jack) and Penny (Pinoko) travel back through time to 15th Century Molavia (Silverland). In this storyline, Black Jack performs a life-saving operation on a critically injured Princess Sapphire (from &quot;Ribbon no Kishi&quot;), while Astro and Uran fend off Gor, a malevolent magician bent on usurping the throne. Characteristically, Roget/Black Jack refuses to operate until he is offered the key to the treasury vault, but later takes only one commemorative coin from the grateful court (which turns out to be worth $200,000,000 when he returns to Astro&#x27;s time).

Black Jack also made a cameo appearance in the theatrical film &quot;Phoenix 2772&quot; as an interstellar prison warden, and is one of the main characters of the TV movie &quot;One Million-Year Trip: Bandar Book&quot;, in which he plays the role of a space pirate, somehow similar in concept to Leiji Matsumoto&#x27;s Captain Harlock.

====Original video animation====
In 1992, Tezuka&#x27;s protégé Osamu Dezaki directed a theatrical film and a ten OVA series which were released between 1993 and 2000. Six OVAs, along with the film, were originally only available in dub-only VHS form in North America, but the ten OVAs have since been released on bilingual Region 1 DVD. &quot;Wizard&quot; selected the series as their &quot;Anime Pick of the Month&quot; for August 1997, calling it &quot;one of the darkest and hardest-hitting made-for-video series of recent years.&quot; A further two OVAs were released in 2011 and were referred to as &quot;Black Jack Final&quot;. In &quot;Black Jack Final&quot; Osamu Dezaki was posthumously credited as honorary director.

====TV series====
In 2003, a four-episode TV promotional special aired called &quot;Black Jack Special: The 4 Miracles of Life&quot;.

From 11 October 2004, through to 6 March 2006, an original television series was aired called &quot;Black Jack&quot;, featuring 61 episodes. The series is an adaptation of Tezuka&#x27;s original manga. The TV show can currently be viewed for free on Viki (website) and Crunchyroll. Anime Sols has successfully crowd-funded the first 26 episodes of it for DVD release, starting from Episode 0. Right Stuf and Crunchyroll are currently selling extra copies of the first boxset through their website.

From 10 April 2006, through to 4 September of the same year, a sequel series of seventeen episodes was aired, called &quot;Black Jack 21&quot; (Black Jack for the 21st century). Adapted from standalone manga chapters, &quot;Black Jack 21&quot; features an all-new overarching story line involving Jack&#x27;s father and a powerful mysterious organization who try to assassinate Jack. Though the &quot;Black Jack 21&quot; series has never been licensed in the U.S., there are several subtitled versions available on the internet.

The previous two anime, &quot;Black Jack&quot; and &quot;Black Jack 21&quot;, depart somewhat from the manga by changing the setting to the early 2000s, allowing for flat-screen LCD computer displays and other items not present in the 1973–83 manga. The episodes are based on chapters from the Black Jack manga, either in part or full, sometimes combining two stories in one episode, and also slightly modified to lighten stories&#x27; serious issues and overtones. Background and supporting characters such as Largo the dog, Wato, Sharaku and Hige were added and used for comic relief or to support Pinoko when the doctor was not present.

On 1 October 2015, a twelve episode anime entitled &quot;Young Black Jack&quot; began to air, about Black Jack&#x27;s adventures as a medical student. It is based on the spin-off manga of the same title written by Yoshiaki Tabata and illustrated by Yūgo Ōkuma. More closely following the timeline of the original 1973–83 manga by Osamu Tezuka, the new anime is however somewhat discontinuous with the 2004 anime.
While &quot;Young Black Jack&quot; is set in the late 1960s against the backdrop of activism against the Vietnam War, the 2004 anime is set in the early 2000s, representing nearly a 40-year time difference, even though Black Jack appears to have aged less than 10 years between them.

====Original net animation====
An original net animation (ONA) adaptation comprising 12 episodes, also known as &quot;Black Jack Internet&quot; or &quot;Black Jack Flash&quot;, was released in 2001–2002 and only available via a subscription online download. The series was created using Flash animation which had the unique &quot;Zapping system&quot; and &quot;Action system&quot;. The &quot;Zapping system&quot; allowed gave the viewer an option to change the camera viewpoint and the &quot;Action system&quot; was used mostly for comical effect.

====Films====
In 1996, two films of the series were made: the first &quot;Black Jack: The Movie&quot;, a full-length feature, and the second &quot;Black Jack: Capital Transfer To Heian&quot;, a special 10-minute short.

In December 2005, a third film entitled &quot;Black Jack: The Two Doctors of Darkness&quot; was released. The film describes Black Jack&#x27;s attempts to prevent a group known as the Ghost of Icarus from starting a widespread, biological war which could wipe out humanity, while working alongside the infamous Dr. Kiriko.

====Shorts====
A 7-minute short called &quot;Dr. Pinoko no Mori no Bōken&quot; was shown before &quot;Black Jack: The Two Doctors of Darkness&quot;.

===Live-action===
* The first live-action adaptation of a Black Jack story was the 1977 film &quot;Hitomi no naka no houmonsha&quot; (瞳の中の訪問者 – &quot;The Visitor in the Eye&quot; AKA &quot;The Eye&#x27;s Visitor&quot;), directed by Hausu director Nobuhiko Ôbayashi and starring Jō Shishido as Blackjack. Although the whole film is live-action, the opening titles are animated in Tezuka&#x27;s signature style.
* In 1981 started the TV drama series &quot;Kayama Yuzo no Blackjack&quot;, which, as the title suggests, stars actor Yūzō Kayama as Blackjack. In this version, Blackjack&#x27;s origin story is changed and he is given a secret identity as Miro Ban do, a businessman and owner of an art gallery. The series aired on TV Asahi from 8 January, to 9 April 1981, and lasted 13 episodes. 
* In 1996, three &quot;Black Jack&quot; direct-to-video films were released by Bandai Visual, starring Daisuke Ryu as Black Jack and Honami Tajima as Pinoko.
* In 2000–2001, a series of three made-for-TV movies were aired on the TBS (Tokyo Broadcasting System) TV channel. They were directed by Yukihiko Tsutsumi and starred Masahiro Motoki as Blackjack.
* &quot;Young Black Jack&quot; (ヤング ブラック・ジャック) is a reinvention of Black Jack&#x27;s origin story, starring Masaki Okada as a young Kurō Hazama, before he became known as Black Jack. It started airing on 23 April 2011.
* Chinese film production company Beijing Enlight Media is developing a live-action internet film series adaptation of &quot;Black Jack&quot; with 13 films planned and also a theatrical feature film.

===Appearances in other media===
An anime version of the character was seen in an ad teaming up with Dr. House from &quot;House&quot; for the promotion of the latter in Japan. Black Jack also appears as a playable character in the 2019 puzzle game &quot;Crystal Crisis&quot;.
Animoca Brands added Black Jack as well as Pinoko and Dr. Kiriko as playable characters to its game &quot;Crazy Defense Heroes&quot; in 2020.

==Reception and legacy==
&quot;Black Jack&quot; is considered one of the greatest manga of all time, and among Tezuka&#x27;s best manga, alongside &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and &quot;Phoenix&quot;. In 2006, the Japan Media Arts Festival held an &#x27;experts&#x27; ranking for the &#x27;Greatest Manga of All Time&#x27;. &quot;Black Jack&quot; ranked 5th, behind &quot;Phoenix&quot; and just ahead of &quot;Astro Boy&quot;. In 2009, the Asahi Shimbun held a poll for the &#x27;Greatest Shōwa Manga&#x27;. &quot;Black Jack&quot; ranked 9th on the list, behind &quot;Astro Boy&quot; and just ahead of &quot;Phoenix&quot;.

In addition, &quot;Black Jack&quot; ushered in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Champion&quot;&#x27;s most successful period ever, an era when &quot;Champion&quot; was the best-selling manga magazine, as well as marking Tezuka&#x27;s resurgence, which had taken a hit from the rise of gekiga. It consistently ranks among the most popular manga of all time, and ranked 18th in a 2021 popularity poll conducted by TV Asahi, the highest ranked &quot;Champion&quot; manga, and the highest ranked Tezuka manga. In addition, it ranked 1st in a 2020 poll asking for the &#x27;Greatest &quot;Champion&quot; Manga of All Time&#x27;. The character of Black Jack is also one of the most iconic manga characters ever, and has acted as a mascot for Japan&#x27;s marrow donation service, and even for a &#x27;Partner Agent&#x27; service.

It is also one of three manga that are most frequently found in Japanese schools, due to being deemed to have educational value, alongside &quot;Barefoot Gen&quot;, and the manga adaptation of &quot;The Tale of Genji&quot;.

&quot;Black Jack&quot; has also influenced numerous real doctors to enter the practice.

About.com&#x27;s Deb Aoki listed &quot;Black Jack&quot; as the best &quot;re-issue of previously released material&quot; of 2008.

<doc id="253747" wikidata="Q33170" url="?curid=253747" title="Chukchi language">
<text>Chukchi ( ), also known as Chukot, is a Chukotko–Kamchatkan language spoken by the Chukchi people in the easternmost extremity of Siberia, mainly in Chukotka Autonomous Okrug. The language is closely related to Koryak. Chukchi, Koryak, Kerek, Alutor, and Itelmen form the Chukotko-Kamchatkan language family. There are many cultural similarities between the Chukchis and Koryaks, including economies based on reindeer herding. Both peoples refer to themselves by the endonym Luorawetlat (ԓыгъоравэтԓьат ; singular Luorawetlan ԓыгъоравэтԓьан ), meaning &quot;the real people&quot;. All of these peoples and other unrelated minorities in and around Kamchatka are known collectively as Kamchadals.

&quot;Chukchi&quot; and &quot;Chukchee&quot; are anglicized versions of the Russian exonym &quot;Chukcha&quot; (plural &quot;Chukchi&quot;). This came into Russian from &quot;Čävča&quot;, the term used by the Chukchis&#x27; Tungusic-speaking neighbors, itself a rendering of the Chukchi word чавчыв , which in Chukchi means &quot;[a man who is] rich in reindeer,&quot; referring to any successful reindeer herder, a wealthy man by local standards.

Although Chukchi language is taught in 28 elementary schools in Chukotka Autonomous Region to 1616 children (according to 2015-2016 data), and there are several hours of daily TV and radio broadcasts in the Chukchi language, the everyday use and proficiency in the language is declining among native Chukchis. According to the 2020 census, 8,526 of the 16,200 Chukchi people speak Chukchi; and most Chukchi now speak Russian (fewer than 100 report not speaking Russian at all). The language is on the list of endangered languages in the UNESCO Red Book.

== People ==

The Chukchi people have a rich history and culture, which have traditionally centered around war. The Chukchi prize warriors and the fighting spirit that they embody. This emphasis on conflict can be seen in the interactions between the Chukchi and the Russians, which date back to the middle of the seventeenth century and tell of glorious battles between the two groups. The Chukchi have also been known to battle nearby tribes, particularly the Tánñit, which comprise fellow Siberian peoples known as the Koryaks. However, over the last century, the Chukchi people have engaged in far fewer conflicts and have focused more on trading. Today, the Chukchi economy relies heavily on trade, particularly with Russia.

Besides trading with Russia, the Chukchi make their living off of herding reindeer and bartering with other tribes. There is also a group of Chukchi that do not herd reindeer and instead live along the coast, trading more with tribes who live along the pacific coast. Some Chukchi people even choose to go back and forth between the two divisions, trading with both. These people tend to control more of the trade and have been called Kavrálît or “Rangers”.

Notably, Chukchi men and women use different pronunciation for the same words. While men say &quot;r&quot; or &quot;rk&quot;, women say &quot;ts&quot; or &quot;tsts&quot; in the same word.

== Usage ==
Many Chukchis use the language as their primary means of communication both within the family and while engaged in their traditional pastoral economic activity (reindeer herding). The language is also used in media (including radio and TV translations) and some business activities. However, Russian is increasingly used as the primary means of business and administrative communication, in addition to behaving as a lingua franca in territories inhabited by non-Chukchis such as Koryaks and Yakuts. Over the past few decades, fewer and fewer Chukchi children have been learning Chukchi as a native language. Almost all Chukchis speak Russian, although some have a lesser command than others. Chukchi language is used as a primary language of instruction in elementary school; the rest of secondary education is done in Russian with Chukchi taught as a subject.

A Chukchi writer, Yuri Rytkheu (1930–2008), has earned a measure of renown in both Russia and Western Europe, although much of his published work was written in Russian, rather than Chukchi. Chukchi poet Antonina Kymytval wrote in her native language.

== Phonology ==


* [ɸ, x, ɻ̊, j̊] are heard as allophones of /β, ɣ, ɻ, j/ after voiceless stops.
* /ɻ/ is mostly heard as an alveolar trill [r], when in between vowels.
* /s/ is phonetically [s~t͡ʃ] in free variation and only occurs in the men&#x27;s dialect.
* /t͡ʃ/ becomes [s] before /q/ and only occurs in the women&#x27;s dialect.
* /s/, /t͡ʃ/ and /ɻ/ have different distributions between men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s dialects.

There are no voiced stops in the language; these are only found in loanwords.

The vowels are , , , , , , and . and are pronounced identically but behave differently in the phonology. (Cf. the two kinds of in Inuit Eskimo, whose known cause is the merger of two vowels and , which are still separate in Yup&#x27;ik Eskimo.)

A notable feature of Chukchi is its vowel harmony system largely based on vowel height. alternate with , respectively. The second group is known as &quot;dominant vowels&quot; and the first group as &quot;recessive vowels&quot;; that is because whenever a &quot;dominant&quot; vowel is present anywhere in a word, all &quot;recessive&quot; vowels in the word change into their &quot;dominant&quot; counterpart. The schwa vowel does not alternate but may trigger harmony as if it belonged to the dominant group.

Initial and final consonant clusters are not tolerated, and schwa epenthesis is pervasive.

Stress tends to: 1. be penultimate; 2. stay within the stem; 3. avoid schwas.

== Orthography ==
Chukchi is one of few languages to have autonomously produced its own written script, and the northernmost language in the world to have done so. The script was invented by a man named Tenevil, but never saw widespread use.

Until 1931, the Chukchi language had no official orthography, in spite of attempts in the 1800s to write religious texts in it.

At the beginning of the 1900s, Vladimir Bogoraz discovered specimens of pictographic/logographic writing by the Chukchi herdsman Tenevil (see :ru:File:Luoravetl.jpg). Tenevil&#x27;s writing system was entirely his own invention. It was nearly lost during the initial period of Soviet contact and subsequent Russian Arctic expeditions. The first official Chukchi alphabet was devised by Bogoraz in 1931 and was based on the Latin script:

In 1937, this alphabet, along with all of the other alphabets of the non-Slavic peoples of the USSR, was replaced by a Cyrillic alphabet. At first it was the Russian alphabet with the addition of the digraphs &quot;Кʼ кʼ&quot; and &quot;Нʼ нʼ&quot;. In the 1950s the additional letters were replaced by &quot;Ӄ ӄ&quot; and &quot;Ӈ ӈ&quot;. These newer letters were mainly used in educational texts, while the press continued to use the older versions. At the end of the 1980s, the letter &quot;Ԯ ԯ&quot; (&quot;Ԓ ԓ&quot;) was introduced as a replacement for &quot;Л л&quot;. This was intended to reduce confusion with the pronunciation of the Russian letter of the same form. The Chukchi alphabet now stands as follows:

=== Romanization of Chukchi ===
The romanization of Chukchi is the representation of the Chukchi language using Latin letters.

The following is the ISO 9 system of Romanization:
== Grammar ==
Chukchi is a largely polysynthetic, agglutinative, direct-inverse language and has ergative–absolutive alignment. It also has very pervasive incorporation. In particular, the incorporation is productive and often interacts with other linguistic processes. Chukchi allows free incorporation of adjuncts, such as when a noun incorporates its modifier. However, besides the unusual use of adjuncts, Chukchi behaves in a typologically normal manner. The language of Chukchi also uses a specific verb system. The basic locative construction of a sentence in Chukchi contains a single locative verb, unlike many other languages.

In the &quot;nominals&quot;, there are two numbers and about 13 morphological cases: absolutive, ergative/instrumental, equative (copula), locative, allative, ablative, orientative, inessive, perlative, sublative, comitative, associative, and privative. Nouns are split into three declensions influenced by animacy: the first declension, which contains non-humans, has plural marking only in the absolutive case; the second one, which contains personal names and certain words for mainly older relatives, has obligatory plural marking in all forms; the third one, which contains other humans than those in the second declension, has optional plural marking. These nominal cases are used to identify the number of nouns, as well as their purpose and function in a sentence.

&quot;Verbs&quot; distinguish three persons, two numbers, three moods (declarative, imperative and conditional), two voices (active and antipassive) and six tenses: present I (progressive), present II (stative), past I (aorist), past II (perfect), future I (perfective future), future II (imperfective future). Past II is formed with a construction meaning possession (literally &quot;to be with&quot;), similar to the use of &quot;have&quot; in the perfect in English and other Western European languages.

Both subject and direct object are cross-referenced in the verbal chain, and person agreement is very different in intransitive and transitive verbs. Person agreement is expressed with a complex system involving both prefixes and suffixes; despite the agglutinative nature of the language, each individual combination of person, number, tense etc. is expressed in a way that is far from always straightforward. Besides the finite forms, there are also infinitive, supine (purposive), numerous gerund forms, and a present and past participle, and these are all used with auxiliary verbs to produce further analytic constructions.

The word order is rather free, though SOV is basic. The possessor normally precedes the possessed, and postpositions rather than prepositions are used.

Chukchi as a language often proves difficult to categorize. This is primarily due to the fact that it does not always follow a typical linguistic and syntactical pattern. These exceptions allow Chukchi to fit into more than one linguistic type.

Chukchi has periodic tense: it can incorporate the noun to build a nocturnal verb form.

== Vocabulary ==
A large number of words in the Chukchi language are reduplicated in their singular forms, i.e. Chukchi &quot;Э’ръэр&quot; (&quot;iceberg&quot;) and &quot;Утуут&quot; (&quot;tree&quot;). There is also significant influence from the Russian language, especially in formal vocabulary and modern concepts, i.e. Chukchi &quot;Чайпат&quot;, from Russian &quot;Чай&quot; (tea). The extent to which Chukchi and the Eskimo languages borrowed vocabulary between one another, or a relationship between the two, has not been studied in detail.

=== Numbers ===
The &quot;numeral&quot; system was originally purely vigesimal and went up to 400, but a decimal system was introduced for numerals above 100 via Russian influence. Many of the names of the basic numbers can be traced etymologically to words referring to the human body (&quot;finger&quot;, &quot;hand&quot; etc.) or to arithmetic operations (6 = &quot;1 + 5&quot; etc.).

Ordinary numbers are formed with the suffix -ӄeв (after close vowels) or -ӄaв (after open vowels).

== External influence ==
The external influences of Chukchi have not been well-studied. In particular, the degree of contacts between the Chukchi and Eskimo languages remains an open question. Research into this area is problematic in part because of the lack of written evidence. (Cf. de Reuse in the Bibliography.) Contact influence of Russian, which is increasing, consists of word borrowing and pressure on surface syntax; the latter is primarily seen in written communication (translated texts) and is not apparent in day-to-day speech.

<text>Samuel Kanyon Doe (6 May 1951 – 9 September 1990) was a Liberian politician and military officer who served as the 21st President of Liberia from 1986 to 1990. He ruled Liberia as Chairman of the People&#x27;s Redemption Council (PRC) from 1980 to 1986 and then as president from 1986 to 1990.

A member of the Krahn ethnic group, Doe was a master sergeant in the Armed Forces of Liberia (AFL) when he staged the violent 1980 coup d&#x27;état that overthrew President William Tolbert and the True Whig Party, becoming the first non-Americo-Liberian leader of Liberia and ending 133 years of Americo-Liberian rule. Doe suspended the Constitution of Liberia, assumed the rank of general, and established the PRC as a provisional military government with himself as &quot;de facto&quot; head of state. Doe dissolved the PRC in 1984 and attempted to legitimize his regime, with a new democratic constitution and a general election held in 1985. He won with 51% of the votes, but the election had widespread allegations of election fraud. Doe opened Liberian ports to Canadian, Chinese, and European ships, which brought in considerable foreign investment and earned Liberia&#x27;s reputation as a tax haven. Doe had support from the United States due to his anti-Soviet stance during the Cold War.

Doe&#x27;s rule was characterized by authoritarianism, corruption, favoritism towards fellow Krahns, and persecution of the Gio and Mano tribes, particularly after surviving a coup attempt in 1985, which led to growing opposition to his regime from the Liberian public and the United States. The First Liberian Civil War began in December 1989 when the anti-Doe National Patriotic Front of Liberia (NPFL) led by Charles Taylor invaded Liberia from the Ivory Coast to overthrow him. The following year, Doe was captured and executed by the Independent National Patriotic Front of Liberia (INPFL), an NPFL splinter group led by Prince Johnson.

== Early life ==
Samuel Kanyon Doe was born on 6 May 1951 in Tuzon, a small inland village in Grand Gedeh County. His family belonged to the Krahn people, an important minority indigenous group in this area. At the age of sixteen, Doe finished elementary school and enrolled at a Baptist junior high school in Zwedru. 
Two years later, he enlisted in the Armed Forces of Liberia, hoping thereby to obtain a scholarship to a high school in Kakata. Still, instead, he was assigned to military duties. Over the next ten years, he was assigned to various duty stations, including education at a military school and commanding various garrisons and prisons in Monrovia. He finally completed high school by correspondence. Doe was promoted to the grade of Master sergeant on 11 October 1979 and made an administrator for the Third Battalion in Monrovia, a position he occupied for eleven months.

== 1980 coup d&#x27;etat and new government ==

 Commanding a group of Krahn soldiers, Master Sergeant Samuel Doe led a military coup on 12 April 1980 by attacking the Liberian Executive Mansion and killing President William Tolbert. His forces killed another 26 of Tolbert&#x27;s supporters in the fighting. Thirteen members of the Cabinet were publicly executed ten days later. Shortly after the coup, government ministers were walked publicly around Monrovia in the nude and then summarily executed by a firing squad on the beach. The convicted were denied the right to a lawyer or any appeal. Hundreds of government workers fled the country, while others were imprisoned.

After the coup, Doe assumed the rank of general and established a People&#x27;s Redemption Council (PRC), composed of himself and 14 other low-ranking officers, to rule the country. The early days of the regime were marked by mass executions of members of Tolbert&#x27;s deposed government. Doe ordered the release of about 50 leaders of the opposition Progressive People&#x27;s Party, who had been jailed by Tolbert during the rice riots of the previous month.

Shortly after that, Doe ordered the arrest of 91 officials of the Tolbert regime. Within days, eleven former members of Tolbert&#x27;s cabinet, including his brother Frank, were brought to trial to answer charges of &quot;high treason, rampant corruption and gross violation of human rights.&quot; Doe suspended the Constitution, allowing these trials to be conducted by a Commission appointed by the state&#x27;s new military leadership, with defendants being refused both legal representation and trial by jury, virtually ensuring their conviction.

Doe abruptly ended 133 years of Americo-Liberian political domination. Some hailed the coup as the first time since Liberia&#x27;s establishment as a country that it was governed by people of native African descent instead of by the Americo-Liberian elite. Other persons without Americo-Liberian heritage had held the Vice Presidency (Henry Too Wesley), as well as Ministerial and Legislative positions in years prior. Many people welcomed Doe&#x27;s takeover as a shift favoring the majority of the population that had largely been excluded from government participation since the country&#x27;s establishment.

However, the new government, led by the leaders of the &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; and calling itself the People&#x27;s Redemption Council (PRC), lacked experience and was ill-prepared to rule. Doe became head of state and suspended the constitution but promised a return to civilian rule by 1985.

In the first alleged plot against his government, nine military personnel arrested two months after the original 1980 coup were reportedly jailed for life.

In June 1981, his government denounced another alleged coup in which thirteen members were executed behind closed doors.

Months later, Thomas Weh Syen, an outspoken critic of some of Doe&#x27;s policies, including the closure months before of the Libyan diplomatic mission and the forced reduction of staff from fifteen to six at the Soviet embassy, was beaten and arrested on 12 August of that same year, along with four other officers. They were promised a defense attorney, but none was given, and in three days, they were executed, which caused panic among the citizens of the capital.

=== Theories on the genesis of the coup ===
In August 2008, before a Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) in Monrovia, Doe&#x27;s former justice minister, Councillor Chea Cheapoo — who contested the 2011 Liberia Presidential elections — alleged the American CIA had provided a map of the Executive Mansion, enabling the rebels to break into it; that it was a white American CIA agent who shot and killed Tolbert; and that the Americans &quot;were responsible for Liberia&#x27;s nightmare&quot;. However, the next day, before the same TRC, another former minister of Samuel Doe, Dr. Boima Fahnbulleh, testified that &quot;the Americans did not support the coup led by Mr. Doe&quot;.

Some facts of the 1980 coup are still clouded by reports of an &quot;Unknown Soldier&quot;. It is reported that an &quot;unknown soldier&quot; was one of the &quot;white&quot; mercenaries who would have staged the 1980 military takeover of the state. According to the autobiography of Tolbert&#x27;s wife Victoria, the First Lady witnessed a masked man with a &quot;white&quot; hand stabbing her late husband.

== Presidency ==
During his rule, Doe portrayed himself as an enlightened leader whose actions were intended to bring &quot;relief to many&quot;. He styled himself &quot;Dr. Doe&quot; starting in 1982 after making a state visit to Chun Doo-hwan in South Korea and being awarded an honorary doctorate from the University of Seoul. After seven years of calling himself a doctor, Doe announced in 1989 that he had completed a bachelor&#x27;s degree from the University of Liberia.

=== Relations with the United States ===

During his first years in office, Doe openly supported U.S. Cold War foreign policy in Africa during the 1980s, severing diplomatic relations between Liberia and the Soviet Union.

The United States valued Liberia as an important ally during the Cold War, as it helped to contain the spread of Soviet influence in Africa. As part of the expanding relationship, Doe agreed to a modification of the mutual defense pact granting staging rights on 24-hour notice at Liberia&#x27;s sea and airports for the U.S. Rapid Deployment Force (RDF), which were established to respond swiftly to security threats around the world.

=== New constitution and 1985 elections ===
A draft constitution providing for a multi-party republic was issued in 1983 and approved by referendum in 1984. On 26 July 1984, Doe was elected President of the Interim National Assembly. He had a new constitution approved by referendum in 1984 and went on to stage a presidential election on 15 October 1985. According to official figures, Doe won 51% of the vote—just enough to avoid a runoff. The NDPL won 21 of the 26 Senate seats and 51 of the 64 seats in the House of Representatives. However, most of the elected opposition candidates refused to take their seats.

The election was heavily rigged; Doe had the ballots taken to a secret location, and 50 of his own handpicked staff counted them. Foreign observers declared the elections fraudulent and suggested that runner-up Jackson Doe (not related) of the Liberian Action Party had won. Also, before the election, he had more than 50 of his political opponents murdered. It is also alleged that he changed his official birth date from 1951 to 1950 to meet the new constitution&#x27;s requirement that the president be at least 35 years old. Doe was formally sworn in on 6 January 1986. On the day of his inauguration as the twenty-first president, in the stadium, a show with several Liberian girls danced artistically in his honor with various hoops. Later, the dancers danced with maracas. Finally, the army paraded in line and the first they played a majestic orchestra.

Doe publicly declared that if he lost the elections, he would not hand over power, and the army would carry out another coup in less than two weeks, a position that was harshly criticized by the international community and the political parties participating in the elections. Official results showed that Doe received a narrow majority of the votes in the elections, although the US State Department alleged widespread fraud.

=== Increased repression ===
General Thomas Quiwonkpa, who had been a leader of the 1980 coup along with Doe, attempted to seize power on 12 November 1985; the attempt failed after fighting in Monrovia in which Quiwonkpa was killed. Doe also announced in a radio and television broadcast that anyone found on the streets after a 6 p.m. curfew would be considered a rebel and executed immediately.

Doe&#x27;s government became even more repressive after the attempted coup, shutting down newspapers and banning political activity. The government&#x27;s mistreatment of certain ethnic groups, particularly the Gio (or Dan) and the Mano in the north (Quiwonkpa was an ethnic Gio), resulted in divisions and violence among indigenous populations who until then had coexisted peacefully.

== Civil war ==

Charles Taylor, a former ally of Doe, crossed into Liberia from Ivory Coast on 24 December 1989 to wage a guerrilla war against Doe. Taylor had broken out of a jail in the United States, where he was awaiting extradition to Liberia on charges of embezzlement. The conflict quickly flared into full-fledged civil war. By the mid-1990s, most of Liberia was controlled by rebel factions.
Approximately 600 civilians were killed at the church in the Sinkor section of Monrovia on 29 July 1990. The massacre was carried out by approximately 30 government soldiers loyal to Doe. The perpetrators were of Doe&#x27;s Krahn tribe while most of the victims were from the Gio and Mano tribes, which were in support of the rebels.

===Capture===
Doe was captured in Monrovia on 9 September 1990 by Prince Johnson, leader of INPFL, a breakaway faction of Taylor&#x27;s NPFL. General Quainoo, the head of ECOMOG, had invited Doe to the ECOMOG headquarters for a meeting and assured him of his safety from the rebels. On the morning of 9 September 1990, Doe arrived at a precarious time during an ongoing change in guard duty from the well-armed and better equipped Nigerian team of peacekeepers to the weaker Gambian contingent. The Nigerian team had just withdrawn from the scene when Doe&#x27;s convoy of lightly armed personnel arrived. Doe was escorted to General Quainoo&#x27;s office, where he was formally welcomed while most of his team of aides and guards waited outside. Johnson&#x27;s rebels surprised everyone by suddenly arriving on the scene uninvited and heavily armed, overwhelming and disarming all of Doe&#x27;s team while encountering no resistance. They then started shooting Doe&#x27;s team individually and later in groups. Upon hearing the gunshots from outside, Doe expressed concern to Quainoo, who assured him everything was fine. Quainoo later excused himself to check on what was happening outside and was followed by his aide, Captain Coker of the Gambian contingent. Both men took cover upon assessing the situation. Johnson&#x27;s men moved indoors, finished off Doe&#x27;s remaining team, shot him in the leg, and took him captive. Over 80 of Doe&#x27;s men were killed. Coker characterized the incident not as a fight but a brutal massacre. None of the ECOMOG personnel were shot in the carnage.

===Torture and murder===
Doe was taken to Johnson&#x27;s military base. To prove that he was not protected by black magic, Johnson ordered Doe&#x27;s ears be cut off in his presence. Shackles were also placed around Doe&#x27;s legs and something strange was tied around his glans, as can be seen in the recording. At the end of the recording, Doe was forced to get up, some of his fingers and toes were amputated, and there were attempts to mutilate the middle finger. After 12 hours of torture at Johnson&#x27;s hands, Doe was finally murdered; his corpse had its head shaved and was exhibited naked in the streets of Monrovia with cigarette burns. Doe&#x27;s body was later exhumed and reburied. The spectacle of his torture was video-taped and seen on news reports around the country. The video shows Johnson sipping a beer as Doe&#x27;s ear is cut off.

== Personal life ==
Doe was a Baptist. At one time, he was a member of the First Baptist Church in the town of Zwedru in Grand Gedeh County. He changed his church membership to the Providence Baptist Church of Monrovia on 1 December 1985. Doe was a passionate football fan, and the Samuel Kanyon Doe Sports Complex bears his name.

==Posterity==
In November 2000, at a religious rally representing the Doe family, Doe&#x27;s son Samuel Kanyon Doe Jr, accompanied by his mother Nancy, Doe&#x27;s widow, told a conference that he had feelings of hatred and resentment against &quot;a certain person in particular&quot;, thoughts of revenge against his father&#x27;s murderer for the past ten years and that he intended to cleanse his sins and feelings of hatred and revenge against his father&#x27;s executioner. Both parties were reconciled at the hand of the Nigerian pastor TB Joshua.

<text>The Knobz were a New Zealand pop band, originally based in Dunedin, but not considered part of that city&#x27;s main wave of Dunedin sound bands. They became famous in 1980 with their political song &quot;Culture?&quot; criticising Rob Muldoon, who was Prime Minister at the time and had stated that New Zealand&#x27;s pop music was not culture. Muldoon had made the remarks in the context of refusing to lift a 40% tax on sales of music.
&quot;The Knobz&quot; were fairly typical of the New Zealand pop scene in the 1980s; they were described in an article of the time as &quot;XTC meets The Knack&quot;. However, several things set them apart from their contemporaries. They were the first band to have a self-funded single hit the top 5 in New Zealand, released on Wellington independent label Bunk Records owned and run by Michael Alexander. They also managed themselves and toured extensively following chart success with two further singles – &quot;Liverpool to America&quot; (an opportune song about John Lennon) and &quot;K.G.B.&quot; – and, later, an album, &quot;Sudden Exposure&quot;.

The band toured New Zealand before leaving for Australia in 1980, where they played with other acts of the period such as Divinyls, Men at Work, Mi-Sex, Swanee and Moving Pictures. The Knobz dispersed at the end of 1982, with some of the members moving on to other projects.

The Knobz later reformed with songwriter Kevin Fogarty for one more trip around New Zealand and to promote the album &quot;Roads to Rome&quot;. The new album had been written by former band members, but these were replaced with drummer Tim Powles and bassist Warwick Keay, both formerly of Flight X-7. Carey Peterson from Auckland walk and The Visitors also joined the band as vocalist to tour with the band in 1982.

==Discography==

* &quot;Radiation for Free&quot; – self-released as Rockylox, 1979
* &quot;I Like It&quot; single – 1980, EMI
* &quot;Culture&quot; single – 1980, Bunk Records
* &quot;Sudden Exposure&quot; – 1980, WEA
* &quot;Sudden Exposure&quot; – single, 1981, WEA
* &quot;Liverpool to America&quot; – 1981, WEA
* &quot;Roads to Rome&quot; – 1982, WEA

<doc id="253761" wikidata="Q170795" url="?curid=253761" title="Flag of Liberia">
<text>The flag of Liberia, occasionally referred to as the Lone Star, bears a close resemblance to the flag of the United States, representing Liberia&#x27;s founding by former black slaves from the United States and the Caribbean. They are both part of the stars and stripes flag family.

The Liberian flag has similar red and white stripes, as well as a blue square with a white star in the canton. It was adopted on 24 August 1847.

==History==
On 9 April 1827, a resolution was made establishing the first flag of Liberia, during its time as a colony, which identified the flag the same as the United States, except with a white cross in the place of the canton’s stars. In preparation for independence, the flag of Liberia was redesigned and hand-stitched by a committee of seven women. Governor Joseph Jenkins Roberts, in a letter dated 10 July 1847, asked Susannah Elizabeth Lewis to head the committee. The other members of the committee were Matilda Newport, Rachel Johnson, Mary Hunter, Mrs. Sarah McGill Russwurm (wife of J. B. Russwurm), Colonette Teage Ellis, and Sara Draper. All of the women were born in the United States, and many of them were wives of prominent men in Liberia. Lewis was the daughter of former vice colonial agent Colston Waring, the sister of the first First Lady of the Republic, Jane Roberts, and wife of John N. Lewis, one of the signers of the Liberian Declaration of Independence. The flag they designed was adopted on 24 August 1847, about a month after Liberia had declared independence on 26 July 1847. The day the flag was adopted, the nation held a celebration in Monrovia. There, the flag was unfurled to the public for the first time, and Susannah Lewis gave a patriotic speech. The ceremony also featured speeches by a number of notable Liberian politicians and religious leaders, as well as entertainment in the form of band music.

In the 1850s and 1860s, the &quot;Eusibia N. Roye&quot; became the first Liberian-owned ship to display the flag in New York City and Liverpool ports. The vessel was owned by Edward James Roye. In 1860, the Liberian flag was featured on the first known stamp to be issued by the Liberian government. On 24 October 1915, President Daniel Edward Howard signed into law an act which proclaimed 24 August as Flag Day, a national holiday.

On 22 July 1974, the Legislature of Liberia passed an act giving authorization to the president to establish a commission to give consideration to possible changes to a number of national symbols, including the flag and national anthem. The commission was headed by McKinley Alfred Deshield Sr. The commission sought to reexamine the symbols, and remove divisive aspects of them. President William Tolbert appointed 51 members to the Commission on National Unity. The commission was also called the Deshield Commission, after the man who headed it. The commission submitted their report on 24 January 1978. The report ultimately recommended no changes to the flag.

In 2022, a new design for the five-hundred-dollar Liberian banknote featured an illustration of the seven-woman committee designing the Liberian flag.

The flag is seen on many ships around the world as Liberia offers registration under its flag. Shipping companies do this to avoid taxes and restrictions that other countries enforce. As the second most popular flag of convenience (after the flag of Panama), it is estimated that 1,700 foreign-owned ships fly the Liberian flag. This brings in much of the country&#x27;s revenue.

==Symbolism==
The eleven stripes symbolize the signatories of the Liberian Declaration of Independence and the red and white symbolize courage and moral excellence. The white star represents the first independent republic in Africa, above the blue square representing the African continent. The Liberian flag is modeled after and resembles the United States flag because Liberia was founded, colonized, established, and controlled by free people of color and formerly enslaved Black people from the United States and the Caribbean with the help and support of both the United States government and the American Colonization Society (ACS), a private organization dedicated to the removal of free people of color from across North America. Some time after the African Americans began arriving in Liberia in 1822, they came to be identified as &quot;Americo-Liberians&quot; in an effort to separate them from native groups and enslaved Africans rescued from illegal slaving ports and ships by the U.S. Navy.

==Construction==
Keep the length 111 units and width as 209 units. The canton&#x27;s each side is 50 units, the circumscribed square of the 5-point star has all sides 30 units and its center is 25 units from the left and upper edge of the flag of the canton/flag.

==Other flags==
===County flags===
Liberia is subdivided into 15 counties, each of which is entitled to its own flag. Each county flag bears the national flag of Liberia in the canton. The county flags are flown at regional offices and together encircling the national flag of Liberia at the Executive Mansion. 

The flags were introduced in 1965 by William Tubman for the purpose of promoting the counties as meaningful entities. Their design was inspired by Liberia&#x27;s quilting tradition. 

The flags (particularly River Gee County) have been the subject of widespread ridicule by members of online vexillology communities on social media platforms such as Reddit and Facebook. However, vexillologist Steven A. Knowlton argues that these discussions demonstrate a lack of understanding of the political and cultural context of the flags and of the material construction of flags from textiles as opposed to digital creation.

<doc id="253764" wikidata="Q223843" url="?curid=253764" title="Marc-Vivien Foé">
<text>Marc-Vivien Foé (1 May 1975 – 26 June 2003) was a Cameroonian professional footballer, who played as a defensive midfielder for both club and country.

Having initially played for Canon Yaoundé, Foé went on to play professionally in Ligue 1 and the Premier League with Lens, West Ham United, Lyon and Manchester City. On 26 June 2003, Foé died suddenly during an international match for Cameroon, an event which shocked the football community worldwide. The death was later ruled to be due to hypertrophic cardiomyopathy. He was capped 62 times by his nation and had scored 8 goals.

He was posthumously decorated with the Commander of the National Order of Valour and had his shirt numbers 23 and 17 retired by Manchester City and Lens, respectively.

==Club career==
Foé was born on 1 May 1975 in Yaoundé. He started as a junior with Elite Two side Union de Garoua. Moving to Canon Yaoundé, one of the biggest clubs in Cameroon, he won the Cameroonian Cup in 1993.

After turning down Auxerre for a trainee position, he signed for another French club, RC Lens of Ligue 1. His debut on 13 August 1994 was a 2–1 win against Montpellier. In five seasons at Lens, he won the 1998 French league title.

In 1998, he was targeted by Manchester United, but Lens turned down a £3 million offer for him. Further negotiations between the clubs were curtailed abruptly after he broke a leg at Cameroon&#x27;s pre-World Cup training camp, and subsequently missed the whole of the 1998 World Cup.

Shortly after his recovery, he moved to English Premier League club West Ham United, for a club record fee of £4.2 million in January 1999. He played 38 league matches for West Ham, scoring one goal against Sheffield Wednesday. He also scored a goal in West Ham&#x27;s 3–1 win against NK Osijek in the UEFA Cup.

In May 2000, he moved back to France, joining Lyon on a £6 million transfer. He missed much of the season after he developed symptoms of malaria. After recovery, he won the Coupe de la Ligue in 2001, and the Division 1 league title a year later.

Foé then returned to the English Premier League, loaned to Manchester City in the 2002–03 season for £550,000. His debut on the opening day of the season was a 3–0 loss to Leeds United. Foé was a first team regular for Kevin Keegan&#x27;s team, starting 38 of 41 matches. His first goal for the club came against Sunderland at the Stadium of Light on 9 December 2002, and he scored five more goals in the next month. His second goal in a 3–0 victory against Sunderland on 21 April 2003 was the club&#x27;s final goal at their old Maine Road stadium.

==International career==
Foé began representing Cameroon at under-20s when he was called up to the squad of 18 players for the 1993 FIFA World Youth Championship in Australia, under the management of Jean Manga-Onguéné. He played in all of their three group stage matches, scoring one goal in a 3–2 defeat to Colombia in their second match on 8 March 1993, as Cameroon were eventually eliminated from the competition after finishing third. Foé later made his senior debut against Mexico on 22 September 1993 at the Memorial Coliseum, a match which Cameroon lost 1–0.

The following year, he was included in the Cameroon squad for the 1994 World Cup, starting all three of their matches. Team members had been in various financial and disciplinary disputes with the Cameroon Football Association, and the squad was a shadow of the one which had famously reached the quarter-finals of the World Cup in 1990. Cameroon mustered just one point from three matches, and finished with an embarrassing 6–1 defeat to Russia. However, Foé&#x27;s consistently strong performances as a defensive midfielder (including a goal assist) prompted interest from European clubs.

He was in the Cameroon squad in the 2002 World Cup. As in 1994, he played in all of Cameroon&#x27;s matches. Though the team performed better than in 1994, they were again eliminated at the group stage, having beaten Saudi Arabia, drawn with Ireland and lost to Germany.

===Death===

Foé was part of the Cameroon squad for the 2003 FIFA Confederations Cup. He played in wins against Brazil and Turkey and was rested for the match against the United States, with Cameroon having already qualified.
On 26 June 2003, Cameroon faced Colombia in the semi-final, held at the Stade de Gerland in Lyon, France. In the 72nd minute of the match Foé collapsed in the centre circle with no other players near him. After attempts to resuscitate him on the pitch, he was stretchered off the field, where he received mouth-to-mouth resuscitation and oxygen. Medics spent 45 minutes attempting to restart his heart and although he was still alive upon arrival at the stadium&#x27;s medical centre, he died shortly afterwards. A first autopsy did not determine an exact cause of death, but a second autopsy concluded that Foé&#x27;s death was heart-related as it discovered evidence of hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, a hereditary condition known to increase the risk of sudden death during physical exercise.

Foé&#x27;s widow Marie-Louise stated that he had been ill with gastric problems and dysentery before his final match, but he was adamant to play in his adopted hometown of Lyon. Cameroon manager Winfried Schäfer wanted to substitute him minutes before his collapse, observing that the player seemed fatigued, but he signalled that he wanted to continue.

==Personal life==
Foé was a practising Roman Catholic and donated money to charity regularly. He held Cameroonian and French nationalities.

===Tributes===
Foé&#x27;s death caused a profound shock. Numerous tributes to his joyous personality and infectious humour were expressed in the media. France national team player Thierry Henry and other French players pointed to the sky in tribute to Foé after Henry had opened the scoring against Turkey in their Confederations Cup semi-final that evening.

It was suggested that the Confederations Cup and the Stade Gerland could have been renamed after him, and Manchester City manager Kevin Keegan announced that the club would no longer use the number 23 shirt Foé wore during his successful season there. At Manchester City&#x27;s former ground, Maine Road, there is a small memorial to him in the stadium&#x27;s memorial garden, and on the walls of the players&#x27; tunnel are plaques paid for by supporters, with their names, dubbed the Walk of Pride. The first plaque on the wall is for Marc and reads &quot;Marc Vivien Foé – 1975–2003&quot;. His first club, Lens, gave his name to an avenue near the Stade Félix Bollaert. Foé was given a state funeral in Cameroon.

Similar to Manchester City, Lens decided to withdraw the number 17 shirt that Foé wore for five years.
Lyon also decided to withdraw the number 17 shirt that Foé also wore a year before during the time which he played at the Stade de Gerland with the Lyon team. People in Lyon were shocked as he had received a warm welcome on his return to the stadium. However, when fellow Cameroonian Jean II Makoun was transferred to Lyon, Makoun took up the number 17 shirt, explaining that he wore the number: &quot;In memory of Marc, for me and for the whole Cameroon, this will be for something.&quot;

Prior to the kick-off of the 2009 FIFA Confederations Cup final between the United States and Brazil, his son, then fourteen years old, gave a brief speech in memory of his father.

<text>The Dunkirk evacuation, codenamed Operation Dynamo and also known as the Miracle of Dunkirk, or just Dunkirk, was the evacuation of more than 338,000 Allied soldiers during the Second World War from the beaches and harbour of Dunkirk, in the north of France, between 26 May and 4 June 1940. The operation commenced after large numbers of Belgian, British, and French troops were cut off and surrounded by German troops during the six-week Battle of France.

After Germany invaded Poland in September 1939, France and the British Empire declared war on Germany and imposed an economic blockade. The British Expeditionary Force (BEF) was sent to help defend France. After the Phoney War of October 1939 to April 1940, Germany invaded Belgium, the Netherlands, and France on 10 May 1940. Three panzer corps attacked through the Ardennes and drove northwest to the English Channel. By 21 May, German forces had trapped the BEF, the remains of the Belgian forces, and three French field armies along the northern coast of France. BEF commander General Viscount Gort immediately saw evacuation across the Channel as the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest good port.

Late on 23 May, the halt order was issued by Gerd von Rundstedt, commander of Army Group A. Adolf Hitler approved this order the next day, and had the German High Command send confirmation to the front. Attacking the trapped BEF, French, and Belgian armies was left to the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; until the order was rescinded on 26 May. This gave Allied forces time to construct defensive works and pull back large numbers of troops to fight the Battle of Dunkirk. From 28 to 31 May, in the siege of Lille, the remaining 40,000 men of the French First Army fought a delaying action against seven German divisions, including three armoured divisions.

On the first day, only 7,669 Allied soldiers were evacuated, but by the end of the eighth day, 338,226 had been rescued by a hastily assembled fleet of over 800 vessels. Many troops were able to embark from the harbour&#x27;s protective mole onto 39 British Royal Navy destroyers, four Royal Canadian Navy destroyers, at least three French Navy destroyers, and a variety of civilian merchant ships. Others had to wade out from the beaches, waiting for hours in shoulder-deep water. Some were ferried to the larger ships by what became known as the Little Ships of Dunkirk, a flotilla of hundreds of merchant marine boats, fishing boats, pleasure craft, yachts, and lifeboats called into service from Britain.

The BEF lost 68,000 soldiers during the French campaign and had to abandon nearly all of its tanks, vehicles, and equipment. In his &quot;We shall fight on the beaches&quot; speech on 4 June to the House of Commons, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill called the event &quot;a colossal military disaster&quot;, saying &quot;the whole root and core and brain of the British Army&quot; had been stranded at Dunkirk and seemed about to perish or be captured. He hailed their rescue as a &quot;miracle of deliverance&quot;. Churchill also reminded the country that &quot;we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.&quot;

==Background==

In September 1939, after Germany invaded Poland, the United Kingdom sent the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) to aid in the defence of France, landing at Cherbourg, Nantes, and Saint-Nazaire. By May 1940 the force consisted of ten divisions in three corps under the command of General John Vereker, 6th Viscount Gort. Working with the BEF were the Belgian Army and the French First, Seventh, and Ninth Armies.

During the 1930s, the French had constructed the Maginot Line, a series of fortifications along their border with Germany. This line had been designed to deter a German invasion across the Franco-German border and funnel an attack into Belgium, which could then be met by the best divisions of the French Army. Thus, any future war would take place outside of French territory, avoiding a repeat of the First World War. The area immediately to the north of the Maginot Line was covered by the heavily wooded Ardennes region, which French General Philippe Pétain declared to be &quot;impenetrable&quot; as long as &quot;special provisions&quot; were taken. He believed that any enemy force emerging from the forest would be vulnerable to a pincer attack and destroyed. The French commander-in-chief, Maurice Gamelin, also believed the area to be of a limited threat, noting that it &quot;never favoured large operations&quot;. With this in mind, the area was left lightly defended.

The initial plan for the German invasion of France called for an encirclement attack through the Netherlands and Belgium, avoiding the Maginot Line. Erich von Manstein, then Chief of Staff of the German Army Group A, prepared the outline of a different plan and submitted it to the (OKH; German High Command) via his superior, Gerd von Rundstedt. Manstein&#x27;s plan suggested that panzer divisions should attack through the Ardennes, then establish bridgeheads on the Meuse River and rapidly drive to the English Channel. The Germans would thus cut off the Allied armies in Belgium. This part of the plan later became known as the &quot;Sichelschnitt&quot; (&quot;sickle cut&quot;). Adolf Hitler approved a modified version of Manstein&#x27;s ideas, today known as the Manstein Plan, after meeting with him on 17 February.

On 10 May, Germany invaded Belgium and the Netherlands. Army Group B, under Fedor von Bock, attacked into Belgium, while the three panzer corps of Army Group A under Rundstedt swung around to the south and drove for the Channel. The BEF advanced from the Belgian border to positions along the River Dyle within Belgium, where they fought elements of Army Group B starting on 10 May. They were ordered to begin a fighting withdrawal to the Scheldt River on 14 May when the Belgian and French positions on their flanks failed to hold. During a visit to Paris on 17 May, Prime Minister Winston Churchill was astonished to learn from Gamelin that the French had committed all their troops to the ongoing engagements and had no strategic reserves. On 19 May, Gort met with French General Gaston Billotte, commander of the French First Army and overall coordinator of the Allied forces. Billotte revealed that the French had no troops between the Germans and the sea. Gort immediately saw that evacuation across the Channel was the best course of action, and began planning a withdrawal to Dunkirk, the closest location with good port facilities. Surrounded by marshes, Dunkirk boasted old fortifications and the longest sand beach in Europe, where large groups could assemble. On 20 May, on Churchill&#x27;s suggestion, the Admiralty began arranging for all available small vessels to be made ready to proceed to France. After continued engagements and a failed Allied attempt on 21 May at Arras to cut through the German spearhead, the BEF was trapped, along with the remains of the Belgian forces and the three French armies, in an area along the coast of northern France and Belgium.

==Prelude==

Without informing the French, the British began planning on 20 May for Operation Dynamo, the evacuation of the BEF. This planning was headed by Vice Admiral Bertram Ramsay at the naval headquarters below Dover Castle, from which he briefed Churchill as it was under way. Ships began gathering at Dover for the evacuation. On 20 May, the BEF sent Brigadier Gerald Whitfield to Dunkirk to start evacuating unnecessary personnel. Overwhelmed by what he later described as &quot;a somewhat alarming movement towards Dunkirk by both officers and men&quot;, due to a shortage of food and water, he had to send many along without thoroughly checking their credentials. Even officers ordered to stay behind to aid the evacuation disappeared onto the boats.

On 22 May, Churchill ordered the BEF to attack southward in coordination with the French First Army under General Georges Blanchard to reconnect with the remainder of the French forces. This proposed action was dubbed the Weygand Plan after General Maxime Weygand, appointed Supreme Commander after Gamelin&#x27;s dismissal on 18 May. On 25 May, Gort had to abandon any hope of achieving this objective and withdrew on his own initiative, along with Blanchard&#x27;s forces, behind the Lys Canal, part of a canal system that reached the sea at Gravelines. Sluice gates had already been opened all along the canal to flood the system and create a barrier (the Canal Line) against the German advance.

===Battle of Dunkirk===
By 24 May, the Germans had captured the port of Boulogne and surrounded Calais. The engineers of the 2nd Panzer Division under &quot;Generalmajor&quot; Rudolf Veiel built five bridges over the Canal Line and only one British battalion barred the way to Dunkirk. On 23 May, at the suggestion of Fourth Army commander Günther von Kluge, Rundstedt had ordered the panzer units to halt, concerned about the vulnerability of his flanks and the question of supply to his forward troops. He was also concerned that the marshy ground around Dunkirk would prove unsuitable for tanks and he wished to conserve them for later operations (in some units, tank losses were 30–50 per cent). Hitler was also apprehensive, and on a visit to Army Group A headquarters on 24 May, he endorsed the order.

Air Marshal Hermann Göring urged Hitler to let the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; (aided by Army Group B) finish off the British, to the consternation of General Franz Halder, who noted in his diary that the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was dependent upon the weather and aircrews were worn out after two weeks of battle. Rundstedt issued another order, which was sent uncoded. It was picked up by the Royal Air Force (RAF) Y service intelligence network at 12:42: &quot;By order of the Fuhrer ... attack north-west of Arras is to be limited to the general line Lens–Bethune–Aire–St Omer–Gravelines. The Canal will not be crossed.&quot; Later that day, Hitler issued Directive 13, which called for the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to defeat the trapped Allied forces and stop their escape. At 15:30 on 26 May, Hitler ordered the panzer groups to continue their advance, but most units took another 16 hours to attack. Some accounts quote Hitler as saying he deliberately allowed the British to escape. The delay gave the Allies time to prepare defences vital for the evacuation and prevented the Germans from stopping the Allied retreat from Lille.

The halt order has been the subject of much discussion by historians. Guderian considered the failure to order a timely assault on Dunkirk to be one of the major German mistakes on the Western Front. Rundstedt called it &quot;one of the great turning points of the war&quot;, and Manstein described it as &quot;one of Hitler&#x27;s most critical mistakes&quot;. B. H. Liddell Hart interviewed many of the generals after the war and put together a picture of Hitler&#x27;s strategic thinking on the matter. Hitler believed that once Britain&#x27;s troops left continental Europe, they would never return.

==Evacuation==
===26–27 May===

The retreat was undertaken amid chaotic conditions, with abandoned vehicles blocking the roads and a flood of refugees heading in the opposite direction. Due to wartime censorship and the desire to keep up British morale, the full extent of the unfolding disaster at Dunkirk was not initially publicised. A special service attended by King George VI was held in Westminster Abbey on 26 May, which was declared a national day of prayer. The Archbishop of Canterbury led prayers &quot;for our soldiers in dire peril in France&quot;. Similar prayers were offered in synagogues and churches throughout the UK that day, confirming to the public their suspicion of the desperate plight of the troops. Just before 19:00 on 26 May, Churchill ordered Dynamo to begin, by which time 28,000 men had already departed. Initial plans called for the recovery of 45,000 men from the BEF within two days, at which time German troops were expected to block further evacuation. Only 25,000 men escaped during this period, including 7,669 on the first day.

On 27 May, the first full day of the evacuation, one cruiser, eight destroyers, and 26 other craft were active. Admiralty officers combed nearby boatyards for small craft that could ferry personnel from the beaches out to larger craft in the harbour, as well as larger vessels that could load from the docks. An emergency call was put out for additional help, and by 31 May nearly four hundred small craft were voluntarily and enthusiastically taking part in the effort.

The same day, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; heavily bombed Dunkirk, both the town and the dock installations. As the water supply was knocked out, the resulting fires could not be extinguished. An estimated one thousand civilians were killed, one-third of the remaining population of the town. RAF squadrons were ordered to provide air supremacy for the Royal Navy during evacuation. Their efforts shifted to covering Dunkirk and the English Channel, protecting the evacuation fleet. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was met by 16 squadrons of the RAF, who claimed 38 kills on 27 May while losing 14 aircraft. Many more RAF fighters sustained damage and were subsequently written off. On the German side, (KG 2) and KG 3 suffered the heaviest casualties. German losses amounted to 23 Dornier Do 17s. KG 1 and KG 4 bombed the beach and harbour and KG 54 sank the 8,000-ton steamer &quot;Aden&quot;. Junkers Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive bombers sank the troopship &quot;Cote d&#x27; Azur&quot;. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; engaged with 300 bombers which were protected by 550 fighter sorties and attacked Dunkirk in twelve raids. They dropped 15,000 high explosive and 30,000 incendiary bombs, destroying the oil tanks and wrecking the harbour. No. 11 Group RAF flew 22 patrols with 287 aircraft this day, in formations of up to 20 aircraft.

Altogether, over 3,500 sorties were flown in support of Operation Dynamo. The RAF continued to inflict a heavy toll on the German bombers throughout the week. Soldiers being bombed and strafed while awaiting transport were for the most part unaware of the efforts of the RAF to protect them, as most of the dogfights took place far from the beaches. As a result, many British soldiers bitterly accused the airmen of doing nothing to help, reportedly leading to some army troops accosting and insulting RAF personnel once they returned to England.

On 25 and 26 May, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; focused their attention on Allied pockets holding out at Calais, Lille, and Amiens, and did not attack Dunkirk. Calais, held by the BEF, surrendered on 26 May. Remnants of the French First Army, surrounded at Lille, fought off seven German divisions, several of them armoured, until 31 May, when the remaining 35,000 soldiers were forced to surrender after running out of food and ammunition. The Germans accorded the honours of war to the defenders of Lille in recognition of their bravery.

===28 May – 4 June===
The Belgian Army surrendered on 28 May, leaving a large gap to the east of Dunkirk. Several British divisions were rushed in to cover that side. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; flew fewer sorties over Dunkirk on 28 May, switching their attention to the Belgian ports of Ostend and Nieuwpoort. The weather over Dunkirk was not conducive to dive or low-level bombing. The RAF flew 11 patrols and 321 sorties, claiming 23 destroyed for the loss of 13 aircraft. On 28 May, 17,804 soldiers arrived at British ports.

On 29 May, 47,310 British troops were rescued as the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;″s Ju 87s exacted a heavy toll on shipping. The British destroyer was sunk and the was crippled, while her sister ships, each laden with 500 men, were damaged by near misses. British destroyers and were badly damaged but escaped the harbour. Two trawlers disintegrated in the attack. Later, the passenger steamer sank with 600 men aboard at the pier but the men were able to get off. The paddle steamer suffered a direct hit, caught fire, and sank with severe casualties. The raiders also destroyed the two rail-owned ships, the and the . Of the five major German attacks, just two were contested by RAF fighters; the British lost 16 fighters in nine patrols. German losses amounted to 11 Ju 87s destroyed or damaged.

On 30 May, Churchill received word that all British divisions were now behind the defensive lines, along with more than half of the French First Army. By this time, the perimeter ran along a series of canals about from the coast, in marshy country not suitable for tanks. With the docks in the harbour rendered unusable by German air attacks, senior naval officer Captain (later Admiral) William Tennant initially ordered men to be evacuated from the beaches. When this proved too slow, he re-routed the evacuees to two long stone and concrete breakwaters, called the east and west moles, as well as the beaches. The moles were not designed to dock ships, but despite this, the majority of troops rescued from Dunkirk were taken off this way. Almost 200,000 troops embarked on ships from the east mole (which stretched nearly a mile out to sea) over the next week. James Campbell Clouston, pier master on the east mole, organised and regulated the flow of men along the mole into the waiting ships. Once more, low clouds kept &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; activity to a minimum. Nine RAF patrols were mounted, with no German formation encountered. The following day, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; sank one transport and damaged 12 others for 17 losses; the British claimed 38 kills, which is disputed. The RAF and Fleet Air Arm lost 28 aircraft.

The next day, an additional 53,823 men were embarked, including the first French soldiers. Lord Gort and 68,014 men were evacuated on 31 May, leaving Major-General Harold Alexander in command of the rearguard. A further 64,429 Allied soldiers departed on 1 June, before the increasing air attacks prevented further daylight evacuation. The British rearguard of 4,000 men left on the night of 2–3 June. An additional 75,000 French troops were retrieved over the nights of 2–4 June, before the operation finally ended. The remainder of the rearguard, 40,000 French troops, surrendered on 4 June.

Of the total 338,226 soldiers, several hundred were unarmed Indian mule handlers on detachment from the Royal Indian Army Service Corps, forming four of the six units of Force K-6 transport. Cypriot muleteers were also present. Three units were successfully evacuated and one captured. Also present at Dunkirk were a small number of French Senegalese soldiers and Moroccans.

==Navy==
===Evacuation routes===
Three routes were allocated to the evacuating vessels. The shortest was Route Z, a distance of , but it entailed hugging the French coast and thus ships using it were subject to bombardment from on-shore batteries, particularly in daylight hours. Route X, although the safest from shore batteries, travelled through a particularly heavily mined portion of the Channel. Ships on this route travelled north out of Dunkirk, proceeded through the Ruytingen Pass, and headed towards the North Goodwin Lightship before heading south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover. The route was safest from surface attacks, but the nearby minefields and sandbanks meant it could not be used at night. The longest of the three was Route Y, a distance of ; using this route increased the sailing time to four hours, double the time required for Route Z. This route followed the French coast as far as Bray-Dunes, then turned north-east until reaching the Kwinte Buoy. Here, after making an approximately 135-degree turn, the ships sailed west to the North Goodwin Lightship and headed south around the Goodwin Sands to Dover. Ships on Route Y were the most likely to be attacked by German surface vessels, submarines, and the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot;.

===Ships===

The Royal Navy provided the anti-aircraft cruiser , 39 destroyers, and many other craft. The Merchant Navy supplied passenger ferries, hospital ships, and other vessels. Britain&#x27;s Belgian, Dutch, Canadian, Polish, and French allies provided vessels as well. Admiral Ramsay arranged for around a thousand copies to be made of the required charts, had buoys laid around the Goodwin Sands and down to Dunkirk, and organised the flow of shipping. Larger ships such as destroyers were able to carry about 900 men per trip. The soldiers mostly travelled on the upper decks for fear of being trapped below if the ship sank. After the loss on 29 May of 19 British and French navy ships plus three of the larger requisitioned vessels, the Admiralty withdrew their eight best destroyers for the future defence of the country.

===Little ships===

A wide variety of small vessels from all over the south of England were pressed into service to aid in the Dunkirk evacuation. They included speedboats, Thames vessels, car ferries, pleasure craft, and many other types of small craft. The most useful proved to be the motor lifeboats, which had a reasonably good capacity and speed. Some boats were requisitioned without the owner&#x27;s knowledge or consent. Agents of the Ministry of Shipping, accompanied by a naval officer, scoured the Thames for likely vessels, had them checked for seaworthiness, and took them downriver to Sheerness, where naval crews were to be placed aboard. Due to shortages of personnel, many small craft crossed the Channel with civilian crews.

The first of the &quot;little ships&quot; arrived at Dunkirk on 28 May. The wide sand beaches meant that large vessels could not get anywhere near the shore, and even small craft had to stop about from the waterline and wait for the soldiers to wade out. In many cases, personnel would abandon their boat upon reaching a larger ship, and subsequent evacuees had to wait for boats to drift ashore with the tide before they could make use of them. In most areas on the beaches, soldiers queued up with their units and patiently awaited their turn to leave. But at times, panicky soldiers had to be warned off at gunpoint when they attempted to rush to the boats out of turn. In addition to ferrying out on boats, soldiers at De Panne and Bray-Dunes constructed improvised jetties by driving rows of abandoned vehicles onto the beach at low tide, anchoring them with sandbags, and connecting them with wooden walkways.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===
Before the operation was completed, the prognosis had been gloomy, with Churchill warning the House of Commons on 28 May to expect &quot;hard and heavy tidings&quot;. Subsequently, Churchill referred to the outcome as a miracle, and the British press presented the evacuation as a &quot;disaster turned to triumph&quot; so successfully that Churchill had to remind the country in a speech to the House of Commons on 4 June that &quot;we must be very careful not to assign to this deliverance the attributes of a victory. Wars are not won by evacuations.&quot; Andrew Roberts comments that the confusion over the Dunkirk evacuation is illustrated by two of the best books on it being called &quot;Strange Defeat&quot; and &quot;Strange Victory&quot;.

The 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was cut off south of the Somme, by the German &quot;race to the sea&quot;, in addition to the 1st Armoured Division and a host of logistical and labour troops. Some of the latter had been formed into the improvised Beauman Division. At the end of May, further elements of two divisions began deploying to France with the hope of establishing a Second BEF. The majority of the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division was forced to surrender on 12 June. However, almost 192,000 Allied personnel, including 144,000 British, were evacuated through various French ports from 15 to 25 June under the codename Operation Aerial. Remaining British forces under the French Tenth Army as &quot;Norman Force&quot; retreated towards Cherbourg. The Germans marched into Paris on 14 June and France surrendered eight days later.

The more than 100,000 French troops evacuated from Dunkirk were quickly and efficiently shuttled to camps in various parts of south-western England, where they were temporarily lodged before being repatriated. British ships ferried French troops to Brest, Cherbourg, and other ports in Normandy and Brittany, although only about half of the repatriated troops were redeployed against the Germans before the surrender of France. For many French soldiers, the Dunkirk evacuation represented only a few weeks&#x27; delay before being killed or captured by the German army after their return to France. Of the French soldiers evacuated from France in June 1940, about 3,000 joined Charles de Gaulle&#x27;s Free French army in Britain.

In France, the unilateral British decision to evacuate through Dunkirk rather than counter-attack to the south, and the perceived preference of the Royal Navy for evacuating British forces at the expense of the French, led to some bitter resentment. According to Churchill, French Admiral François Darlan originally ordered that the British forces should receive preference, but on 31 May, he intervened at a meeting in Paris to order that the evacuation should proceed on equal terms and that the British would form the rearguard. In fact, the 35,000 men who finally surrendered after covering the final evacuations were mostly French soldiers of the 2nd Light Mechanized and the 68th Infantry Divisions. Their resistance allowed the evacuation effort to be extended to 4 June, on which date another 26,175 Frenchmen were transported to England.

The evacuation was presented to the German public as an overwhelming and decisive German victory. On 5 June 1940, Hitler stated, &quot;Dunkirk has fallen! 40,000 French and English troops are all that remains of the formerly great armies. Immeasurable quantities of materiel have been captured. The greatest battle in the history of the world has come to an end.&quot; (the German armed forces high command) announced the event as &quot;the greatest annihilation battle of all time&quot;.

Within Britain, there was a sharp ideological division about the portrayal of the Dunkirk evacuation. Left-wing and liberal accounts at the time such as by the writer J. B. Priestley and the journalist Hilda Marchant tended to focus exclusively upon Dunkirk, which was portrayed as the beginning of the &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot;, where ordinary people rallied to save the BEF. By contrast, Conservative accounts at the time portrayed Dunkirk as a merely one part of a wider &quot;battle of the ports&quot; which also included the battle of Boulogne and the siege of Calais. Conservative accounts of the &quot;battle of the ports&quot; tended to focus on the professionalism and the bravery of the British military, especially the British Army, in desperate conditions, which were portrayed as symbols of British martial prowess. Conservative newspapers and journals in early 1940 tended to give more coverage to the battle of Calais, where Brigadier Claude Nicholson chose to fight on despite being informed that escape was impossible from Calais, rather than the Durkirk evacuation. The triumph of the &quot;people&#x27;s war&quot; interpretation, which completely obliviated the rival &quot;battle of the ports&quot; interpretation in the popular memory of 1940, was largely due to cinema, as filmmakers chose to focus on the evacuation at Dunkirk and ignored the other battles along the French coast.

===Casualties===
During the entire campaign, from 10 May until the armistice with France on 22 June, the BEF suffered 68,000 casualties. This included 3,500 killed and 13,053 wounded. Most heavy equipment had to be abandoned during the various evacuations, resulting in the loss of 2,472 pieces of artillery, 20,000 motorcycles, nearly 65,000 other vehicles, of stores, more than of ammunition, and of fuel. Almost all of the 445 British tanks despatched to France were abandoned.

Six British and three French destroyers were sunk, along with nine other major vessels. In addition, 19 destroyers were damaged. Over 200 British and Allied sea craft were sunk, with a similar number damaged. The Royal Navy&#x27;s most significant losses in the operation were six destroyers:
* , sunk by naval gunfire from on 29 May
* , sunk by air attack at Dunkirk on 29 May
* , sunk by a torpedo from the E-boat &quot;S-30&quot; on 29 May
* , , and , sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June

The French Navy lost three destroyers:
* , mined off Nieuport on 30 May
* , sunk by the E-boats &quot;S-23&quot; and &quot;S-26&quot; on 31 May
* &quot;Le Foudroyant&quot;, sunk by air attack off the beaches on 1 June

The RAF lost 145 aircraft, of which at least 42 were Spitfires, while the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost 156 aircraft in operations during the nine days of Operation Dynamo, including 35 destroyed by Royal Navy ships (plus 21 damaged) during the six days from 27 May to 1 June.

For every seven soldiers who escaped through Dunkirk, one man became a prisoner of war. The majority of these prisoners were sent on forced marches into Germany. Prisoners reported brutal treatment by their guards, including beatings, starvation, and murder. Another complaint was that German guards kicked over buckets of water that had been left at the roadside by French civilians, for the marching prisoners to drink.

Many of the prisoners were marched to the city of Trier, with the march taking as long as 20 days. Others were marched to the river Scheldt and were sent by barge to the Ruhr. The prisoners were then sent by rail to prisoner of war camps in Germany. The majority (those below the rank of corporal) then worked in German industry and agriculture for the remainder of the war.

Those of the BEF who died in the fighting of 1940, or as a prisoner of war following capture during this campaign, and have no known grave are commemorated on the Dunkirk Memorial.

==Dunkirk Jack==

The St George&#x27;s Cross defaced with the arms of Dunkirk is the warranted house flag of the Association of Dunkirk Little Ships. It is known as the Dunkirk Jack. The flag may be flown from the jack staff only by civilian vessels that took part in the Dunkirk rescue operation.

<doc id="253769" wikidata="Q751190" url="?curid=253769" title="Operation Cycle">
<text>Operation Cycle is the name of the evacuation of Allied troops from Le Havre, in the Pays de Caux of Upper Normandy from 10 to 13 June 1940, towards the end of the Battle of France, during the Second World War. The operation was preceded by the better known rescue of and French soldiers from Dunkirk in Operation Dynamo On 20 May, the Germans had captured Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme and cut off the main Allied armies in the north. South of the river, the Allies improvised defences and made local counter-attacks to dislodge the Germans from bridgeheads on the south bank and re-capture river crossings, for an advance northwards to regain contact with the armies in northern France and Flanders.

The 1st Armoured Division arrived in France from 15 May, without artillery and less some divisional units that had been diverted to Calais. The division joined the large number of lines-of-communication troops south of the Somme, many of whom were hurriedly organised into the Beauman Division and other improvised units, despite a lack of training and weapons. French troops were sent into the area, as Général d&#x27;armée Maxime Weygand attempted to build up a defence in depth on the south bank of the Somme and make bigger attacks to eliminate the German bridgeheads. From about half of the German bridgehead south of Abbeville was recaptured by Franco-British troops; the Allies were reinforced by infantry divisions and the &quot;4e&quot; Division &quot;cuirassée&quot; (4e DCr, Colonel Charles De Gaulle) but lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the river Somme.

When &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (Case Red), the final German offensive, began on 5 June, the IX Corps of the French Tenth Army (including the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (Major-General Victor Fortune) of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) after it arrived from the Saar on 28 May), was pushed back to the Bresle River. On 9 June, German tanks entered Rouen on the Seine, cutting off the IX Corps from the X Corps to the east and from the Seine to the south. The French and British commanders in the pocket decided to make for Le Havre and Fortune detached Arkforce, the equivalent of two brigades, to guard the routes back to the port. During the night of the remainder of the Highland Division and the French divisions of IX Corps prepared to continue the retreat but found that the 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division (&quot;Generalmajor&quot; Erwin Rommel) had advanced from Rouen through Yvetot to Cany and Veulettes-sur-Mer on the Durdent river.

With an Allied withdrawal to Le Havre cut off, the Highlanders and the French retreated to St Valery-en-Caux, where from 10 to 11 June, and soldiers were rescued by the Navy. The remainder, including over 6,000 Highlanders, were taken prisoner on 12 June. At Le Havre, from 10 to 13 June, troops from Arkforce, other British units in the port and Allied forces were evacuated; attempts by the Franco-British to prepare a &quot;national redoubt&quot; in Brittany came to nothing. Operation Cycle was followed by Operation Aerial from 14 to 25 June, in which another were embarked from Cherbourg, St. Malo and other Atlantic and Mediterranean ports, until the Armistice of 22 June 1940.
==Background==

===Battle of France===

On 10 May 1940, the Germans began &quot;Fall Gelb&quot; an offensive against France, Belgium and the Netherlands. Within a few days, Army Group A (&quot;Generaloberst&quot; Gerd von Rundstedt) broke through the French Ninth Army (General André Corap) in the centre of the French front near Sedan and drove westwards down the Somme river valley, led by &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; made up of the XIX &quot;Armeekorps&quot; under &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Heinz Guderian and the &quot;XLI Armee Korps&quot; under &quot;Generalleutnant&quot; Georg-Hans Reinhardt. On 20 May, the Germans captured Abbeville at the mouth of the Somme River, cutting off the Allied troops in Northern France and Belgium. The Battle of Arras, a Franco-British counter-attack on 21 May, led the Germans to continue to attack north towards the channel ports, rather than advance southwards over the Somme. Apprehension about another Franco-British counter-attack led to the &quot;Arras halt order&quot; being issued by the German higher commanders on 21 May. The neighbouring XV Corps (General Hermann Hoth) was held back in reserve and a division of the XLI &quot;Korps&quot; was moved eastwards, when the corps was only from Dunkirk.

===British lines-of-communication===


Allied forces north of the Somme were cut off by the German advance to St. Omer and Boulogne on the night of which isolated the BEF from its supply &quot;entrepôts&quot; at Cherbourg in the Cotentin peninsula, Brittany and Nantes. The Pays de Caux, the coastal area between the Somme and the Seine, was known as the Northern District (Acting Brigadier Archibald Beauman) on the BEF lines-of-communication, with the Dieppe and Rouen districts as sub-areas. Dieppe was the main medical base of the BEF and Le Havre the principal supply and ordnance source. From St. Saëns to Buchy, north-east of Rouen, lay the main BEF ammunition depot and its infantry, machine-gun and base depots were at Rouen, Évreux and L&#x27;Epinay. A main railway line linking the bases and connecting them with bases further west in Normandy and with the BEF in the north, ran through Rouen, Abbeville and Amiens. Beauman was responsible for base security and guarding being built for the RAF, with troops drawn from the Royal Engineers, Royal Army Ordnance Corps, Royal Corps of Signals and older garrison troops.

Below the Seine in the Southern District, were three Territorial divisions and the 4th Border Regiment, 4th Buffs and the 1st/5th Sherwood Forester lines-of-communication battalions, which were moved into the Northern District on 17 May as a precaution. Rail movements between these bases and the Somme quickly became difficult, due to congestion and German bombing, the trains from the north mainly carrying Belgian and French troops and the roads filling with retreating troops and refugees. Beauman lost contact with the BEF GHQ and was also unable to discover if Allied troops were going to dig in on the Somme or further south. On 18 May, Major-General Philip de Fonblanque, commanding the lines-of-communication troops, ordered Beauman to prepare defences in the Northern District. Beauforce was improvised from the 2nd/6th East Surrey of the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division, 4th Buffs, four machine-gun platoons and the 212th Army Troops Company RE.

Vicforce (Colonel C. E. Vickary) took over five provisional battalions created from reinforcement troops in infantry and general base depots, which held plenty of men but few arms and little equipment. Beauforce was sent to Boulogne on 20 May by road but the Germans had already cut off the port and it returned to the 12th (Eastern) Infantry Division near Abbeville. When German troops captured Amiens on 20 May and then began patrolling south of the river, their appearance caused panic and alarmist rumours, in the absence of reliable information. Beauman ordered the digging of a defence line along the Andelle and Béthune rivers, the most effective tank obstacles south of the Bresle river, to protect Dieppe and Rouen against an attack from the east. Bridges were prepared for demolition and obstacles placed on the approaches.

===Battle of Abbeville===
On 20 May, the 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division advanced to Abbeville on the English Channel, overran the 25th Infantry Brigade of the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and captured the town at Only a few British survivors managed to retreat to the south bank of the Somme. At on 21 May, the III Battalion, Rifle Regiment 2 reached the coast, west of Noyelles-sur-Mer. The 1st Armoured Division (Major-General Roger Evans) had arrived in France from 15 May without artillery, short of an armoured regiment and the infantry of the Support Group, which had been diverted to Calais. From 4 June to 4 July the Franco-British forces south of the Abbeville bridgehead, held by the German 2nd &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, then the 57th Infantry Division, recaptured about half of the area; the Allied forces lost many of their tanks and the Germans much of their infantry, some units running back over the River Somme. On 5 June, the German 4th Army attacked out of the remains of their bridgeheads south of the Somme and the Franco-British divisions opposite, drastically depleted by their counter-attacks of the previous four weeks, were pushed back to the Bresle with many casualties.

==Prelude==

===Allied defensive preparations===
The French armies and the &quot;2nd BEF&quot; were operating on interior lines and were closer to their bases and supplies. About troops from Dunkirk had returned to France via the ports of Normandy and Brittany and the troops in the area had been reinforced by about troops from England. The French had also managed to replace many of their tank and other armoured vehicle losses for the &quot;1e&quot; and &quot;2e&quot; DCr (heavy armoured divisions) and the &quot;4e&quot; DCr had its losses replaced and French morale experienced something of a revival by the end of May.

Most French soldier replacements had not experienced the débâcle in the north and officers returned from Dunkirk had gained tactical experience against German mobile units and discovered that tank-for-tank, French vehicles were superior to their German equivalents, having thicker armour and better guns; the French artillery had also performed well. From the Seventh Army and the Tenth Army (General Robert Altmayer) were rebuilt and Weygand adapted to German tactics with defence in depth and delaying tactics, to inflict maximum attrition on German units. Villages, towns and cities were fortified for all-round defence, to serve as hedgehogs with the new infantry, armoured and half-mechanised divisions held back, ready to counter-attack and relieve surrounded units, which were to hold out at all costs.

===German offensive preparations===

On 21 May, Colonel General Franz Halder, the Chief of the Oberkommando des Heeres (OKH) General Staff, submitted to Hitler &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (Case Red), a campaign plan for the final defeat of France, which after amendment was adopted on 31 May. On 5 June, Army Group A was to attack either side of Paris towards the Seine and the main attack by Army Group B (Colonel General Fedor von Bock) was to begin the main attack east of Paris on 9 June towards Rheims and then after about a week, Army Group C (Colonel General Wilhelm von Leeb) was to attack through the Maginot Line and the Upper Rhine. The three army groups would then converge on the Plateau de Langres south-east of Paris and on the rear of the Maginot Line. Army Group B had one cavalry, four motorised infantry, six &quot;panzer&quot; divisions and two motorised infantry brigades. Army Group A had two motorised infantry and four &quot;panzer&quot; divisions. The 4th Army, 6th Army and 9th Army were controlled by Army Group B and the 2nd Army, 12th Army and 16th Army by Army Group A; the 18th Army (General Georg von Küchler) with four divisions, was to remain at Dunkirk. Army Group C had divisions and divisions were held in OKH reserve. Seven divisions were left in eastern Germany and seven garrisoned Norway.

The motorised infantry and &quot;panzer&quot; divisions were concentrated into two groups of two corps each, &quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot; in Army Group A and &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; (General Ewald von Kleist) in Army Group B along with the XV Corps. The plan was based on the traditional concept of &quot;Vernichtungsgedanke&quot; (annihilation theory) in which (battles of manoeuvre) would lead to the encirclement and destruction of the opposing armies. The &quot;panzer&quot; groups were not to be used in independent operations but subordinated to the armies, despite having the same size and importance. &quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot; came under the 12th Army (Colonel General Wilhelm List), &quot;Panzergruppe Kleist&quot; the 6th Army (Colonel General Walter von Reichenau) and XV Corps under the 4th Army (Colonel General Günther von Kluge). Despite protests from Guderian, List planned the attack over the Aisne as an infantry operation, with the &quot;panzer&quot; divisions held back to exploit the breakthrough. Extensive redeployments were necessary and &quot;Panzergruppe Guderian&quot; moved to its start line, after travelling during the drive to Dunkirk, the troops beginning to show great tiredness and the vehicles wear and tear. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; made strategic attacks from (towards the end of the Dunkirk evacuation), against the Parisian aircraft industry and fuel dépôts around Marseilles, then resumed close support operations for the army for &quot;Fall Rot&quot;. (After the occupation of the capital on 14 June, &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; operations concentrated on the Channel Ports south of the Somme and the Atlantic ports, towards which the BEF was retreating.)

====4th Army plan====
On the German right flank, against the French Tenth Army, the 4th Army of Army Group B was to attack with the 5th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division, the 57th Infantry Division, 31st Infantry Division, 12th Infantry Division, 32nd Infantry Division, 27th Infantry Division, 46th Infantry Division and the 6th Infantry Division and the 2nd Motorised Division, the 11th Motorised Brigade and the 1st Cavalry Division. Advancing on a line from Abbeville to Amiens, with a flank guard on the left facing Paris, the main force was to make for the lower Seine, quickly to capture Le Havre and bridgeheads at Rouen, Les Andelys and Vernon. An advance beyond the Seine to the south or south-west was to wait on events.

==&quot;Fall Rot&quot;==

===5 June===

On 5 June, &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (Case Red), a German offensive to complete the defeat of France began and Army Group A attacked either side of Paris towards the Seine. The 4th Army offensive on the Somme began at opposite the 51st (Highland) Division at St. Valery sur Somme. German infantry moved forward against Saigneville, Mons, Catigny, Pendé, Tilloy and Sallenelle held by the 7th and 8th battalions, Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders (Argyll), as other troops passed between them, the villages being too far apart for mutual support. Saigneville, Mons, Catigny, Pendé and Tilloy fell late in the afternoon and the 7th Argyll were surrounded at Franleu, by troops infiltrating between Mons and Arrest. The 4th Black Watch in reserve, were ordered forward to relieve Franleu but were stopped by German troops at Feuquières and an Argyll company sent forward was surrounded at the edge of Franleu. By dark, the remnants of the 154th Infantry Brigade had been pushed back to a line from Woincourt to Eu.

On the right, the 153rd Infantry Brigade was bombed by Ju 87 &quot;Stuka&quot; dive-bombers along with the mortar and artillery-fire used on the rest of the front. The German infantry pushed the battalion back to Tœufles, Zoteux and Frières, where British machine-gun and artillery fire stopped the advance. The French 31st (Alpine) Division was forced back parallel to the British from Limeux to Limercourt and Béhen, with the 152nd Infantry Brigade on the right from Oisemont to the Blangy–Abbeville road. The 1st Lothian and Border Horse at Bray were attacked and fell back east of the village of Oisemont. The Composite Regiment had several engagements and had tank losses before rallying at Beauchamps on the Bresle. The 51st Highland and 31st (Alpine) divisions had tried to hold a front and were so depleted after the bridgehead attacks up to 4 June, that the 1st Black Watch had to hold a front, in close country. The British troops held on until overwhelmed or retreated under the cover of their artillery, which also held on until the last moment before retiring.

The 51st (Highland) Division HQ requested air support from the South Component HQ at Boos but the three AASF fighter squadrons were down to aircraft and lost another four during the morning. Big &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; attacks had been expected on the industrial town of Rouen, a rail and road centre and Anglo-French base of operations; 1 Squadron and French fighters intercepted a raid early in the morning and shot down several aircraft but the remainder got through and bombed Boos aerodrome and an army camp. Another raid in the evening was caught by 501 Squadron but managed to bomb the airfield and camp again, the main bridge, power station, railway and factories. Bombing by the AASF and Bomber Command took place further east and during the night, attacked German communications in France and oil and transport targets in Germany.

===6 June===
During the night, Fortune wrote to Marshall-Cornwall, the War Office liaison officer at the Tenth Army HQ, asking for reinforcements and permission to retreat with the 31st (Alpine) Division to the Bresle but no more troops were left. Marshall-Cornwall prevailed upon Altmayer to agree to a retreat to the Bresle, where the 31st (Alpine) Division would hold from Senarpont to Gamaches and the 51st (Highland) Division from there to the sea, a front of . On 6 June, the day passed with German attacks on Oisemont supported by artillery and bombing, that were repulsed by the 1st Lothian and the &quot;2e Division Légère de Cavalerie&quot; (2nd DLC, Colonel Berniquet) in a costly defensive success. Attacks further away were repulsed by artillery and small arms fire, except at Beauchamps. Infiltration attempts around Eu and Ponts-et-Marais were only just repulsed by the Composite Regiment of the 1st Armoured Division.

The Composite Regiment moved on to Eu and counter-attacked the infiltrations there. Later in the day, the 40th Division moved up beyond the Bresle from Senarpont to Aumale to reinforce parties of Royal Engineers and an anti-tank battery. During the day, reports arrived that German tanks had broken through on the right, that turned out to be alarmist rumours but the 5th and 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions had attacked towards Rouen and their leading elements had got beyond the Poix–Rouen road, with the 2nd Motorised Division following. The 6th Infantry Division was advancing on the German left and the 32nd Infantry Division on the German right was away. The IX Corps position on the Bresle was vulnerable to being cut off in the Havre peninsula. A brigade group of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was due from England on 7 June and the War Office urged the French command to arrange a line of retreat south-east, away from the dead-end of Le Havre, towards the BEF lines of communication south of the Seine.

Weygand had forbidden a retirement, ordering the Bresle to be held come what may. Earlier, 12 Blenheims with air cover flew from England to attack German columns moving towards the Somme crossings and lost five aircraft. Later in the day, bombed bridges and roads from Abbeville to St. Valery-sur-Somme for no loss. Fighters of the AASF patrolled Rouen and during the evening flew sorties over the IX Corps area. In the afternoon, two fighter squadrons had flown from England to Boos airfield, refuelled and patrolled the battlefront but arrived after the German raids on Oisemont and Millebosc. Weygand also appealed for more fighters and the Air Ministry issued warning orders to several squadrons, as Command and aircraft raided German communications and oil targets that night.

===7 June===
&quot;A&quot; Brigade of the Beauman Division, with about of the 4th Buffs, 1st/5th Sherwood Forester and 4th Border battalions, was sent to reinforce the 51st (Highland) Division (whose 152nd, 153rd and 154th Infantry brigades had suffered casualties) and took over on the left; the remnants of the 152nd Infantry Brigade moved into reserve in the . By 7 June, the 51st (Highland) Division had taken up the new position on the Bresle and was in contact with the 31st (Alpine) Division on the right, which reverted to French command. The river made a good defensive position, particularly at the mouth where the banks had been flooded, forming a good tank obstacle and the only vulnerable points were at Eu and Ponts de Marais. During the day, the 4th Border and a company of the 1st/5th Forester attacked the German pocket on the south bank but only managed to push back the Germans to the north-west end of the . The 1st Lothian and the Composite Regiment were moved up as a precaution and for the rest of the day the Allied forces skirmished with the Germans opposite.

To the south-east, the situation continued to deteriorate and Fortune liaised with the 31st (Alpine) Division, to make sure that the limitations of the Support Group (Brigadier F. E. Morgan), 1st Armoured Division were understood. (The day before, the 1st Armoured Division had come under the command of Almayer at the Tenth Army HQ.) The Support Group was separated from the 51st (Highland) Division by the 31st (Alpine) Division, 40th Infantry Division, the &quot;2e&quot; DLC and the &quot;5e&quot; DLC. During 7 June, Evans met Marshall-Cornwall and Lieutenant-General Henry Pownall the former Chief of Staff of the BEF, who was over from England. It was known by then that the 5th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division had broken through the French from Grandvilliers and Formerie and overrun British troops south of the Aumale. Other parts of the Support Group on the Aumale–Serqueux front had defeated an attack but the &quot;panzers&quot; had then attacked south-west near Forges; the remains of the Support Group were withdrawn into the &quot;Basse Forêt d&#x27;Eu&quot;. The 5th and 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; divisions had already outflanked the Bresle line and the 1st Armoured Division units were ordered up to Gournay-en-Bray to make a flank attack on the German penetration. The division had tanks and tanks in the 3rd Armoured Brigade, six light tanks of Queen&#x27;s Bays and the 10th Royal Hussars mounted in lorries of the 2nd Armoured Brigade, after refitting since the May offensive against the German Somme bridgeheads.

During the evening, Général d&#x27;armée Maxime Weygand, arrived at the Tenth Army HQ and told the Franco-British officers that the Tenth Army was fighting &quot;the decisive battle of the war&quot;, that as there were no reserves and all depended on the 1st Armoured Division holding of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux, as French formations counter-attacked from the south. Evans explained that it was a division in name only, its artillery, anti-tank guns and infantry having been detached and that the tanks were not suited to static defence and were already moving up for a counter-attack on the German flank. Weygand was unmoved, only giving permission for the division to retreat over the Seine if it was pushed back from the Andelle. Evans had to countermand the counter-attack, while some units were already engaging the Germans north-west of Gournay. By dawn on 8 June, the &quot;panzers&quot; were close to Rouen and IX Corps on the Bresle was on the brink of being cut off.

===8 June===

====Bresle====
On the Bresle, German troops did little while they waited for the &quot;panzer&quot; divisions to envelop the southern flank of the IX Corps defence line. The 4th Border and 1st/5th Forester continued their attempts to expel the Germans from positions in the but only managed to prevent the Germans from taking more ground and there was skirmishing around Beauchamps. At dawn, the German &quot;panzer&quot; divisions resumed their attack towards Rouen. By this time the 51st (Highland) Division and the reinforcement of A Brigade from the Beauman Division was holding the line of the Bresle from Gamaches to Eu under the command of the divisional headquarters. The 1st Armoured Division had been broken up as soon as it arrived in France and without the detachments to Calais had taken part in the Allied offensive against the German bridgeheads south of the Somme. Since then, a Composite Regiment from the 2nd Armoured Brigade had remained with the 51st (Highland) Division and was covering the &quot;Haute forêt d&#x27;Eu&quot;. The rest of the 2nd and 3rd Armoured brigades had been reduced by losses to improvised units and held part of the Andelle line from Nolleval to Serqueux and the remnants of the Support Group was in the &quot;Basse forêt d&#x27;Eu&quot; under the command of the 51st (Highland) Division. B and C brigades of the Beauman Division were defending the Béthune–Andelle line from the Seine to Dieppe.

====Andelle====
The &quot;panzer&quot; divisions attacked at Forges and Sigy-en-Bray, where French refugees and stragglers had been passing through, making it impossible to close the road blocks and a column of French tanks was allowed through, which turned out to be captured vehicles with German crews. The &quot;French&quot; tanks attacked the defences from the rear as the main German force attacked frontally, capturing Serqueux, losing it to a counter-attack and then regaining it. Sigy was bombarded and dive-bombed and the tanks of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division infantry were pushed back. Further north, Neufchatel was in flames and &quot;panzers&quot; reached Mathonville and pressed on towards the Neufchatel to L&#x27;Epinay and Rouen road. Earlier, the Composite Regiment in &quot;Haute forêt d&#x27;Eu&quot; had been ordered back to the 1st Armoured Division to guard the left flank of the defenders on the Andelle line and arrived at L&#x27;Epinay at but before the regiment could take post, German &quot;panzers&quot; and troops arrived on the road from Serqueux, away. For three hours the Composite Regiment resisted German attacks and was then pushed back.

The rest of the 5th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division had advanced towards Rouen and at engaged Syme&#x27;s Battalion at Isneauville, which had been dive-bombed earlier in the day. The battalion, that had been improvised from reinforcement drafts only a week previous, had laid dannert wire and planted land-mines and after artillery preparation, resisted for three hours, preventing the Germans from reaching Rouen and claimed many infantry casualties, twelve tanks knocked out, six paratroops, an aircraft and a field gun. The battalion then made a fighting withdrawal to the Seine. During the afternoon and night, the remnants of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division also retreated over the Seine, which left only the 51st (Highland) Division and part of the Support Group on the north side. Weygand ordered the IX Corps to retreat to Les Andelys and Rouen, which had already fallen. Ihler received the orders as the Tenth Army HQ was out of touch while moving closer to Paris and gave the divisional commanders a retirement programme in which Rouen was to be reached in four days, despite the German spearheads being only four hours from the city.

====Seine====
On 6 June &quot;Syme&#x27;s Battalion&quot; had arrived comprising soldiers from the base reinforcement depot and the 2nd/4th King&#x27;s Own Yorkshire Light Infantry (2nd/4th KOYLI) and 2nd/6th Duke of Wellington&#x27;s (2nd/6th Duke&#x27;s) battalions of the 46th Division, that had been recovering since the loss of Abbeville on 20 May, had taken up positions around Rouen, Syme&#x27;s Battalion with four 2-pounder anti-tank guns and a machine-gun platoon around Isneauville, the 2nd/4th KOYLI on a bridge over the Seine and the 2nd/6th Duke&#x27;s along the railway south of Boos. The Beauman Division had little artillery and its ill-equipped infantry was dispersed in about of ground from the south-east of Rouen on the Seine to St. Vaast on the Béthune and in positions around Rouen. In some places they were close to parties of the 1st Armoured Division and at others with French troops all under separate command, with few means of liaison. Refugees and stragglers on the roads made it impossible to close roads or prevent infiltration and led Beauman to give a general order, that troops were to hold for as long as possible and that brigadiers were to use their discretion, as to when a retreat to the south of the Seine had become necessary. (During the afternoon and night, the last of the 1st Armoured Division and the Beauman Division retreated over the river.)

===9 June===
During the morning, German tanks entered Rouen, to find that French and British troops had left and blown the Seine bridges. IX Corps on the Bresle began to retire as the German armoured forces turned north. Fortune had divided the 51st (Highland) Division to leapfrog backwards; the 153rd Brigade and A Brigade were to retreat to a line from Envermeu to Belleville-sur-Mer as the 154th and 152nd Brigades assembled on the Béthune further back. The Royal Army Service Corps made double trips to move the troops but some took until mid-morning on 9 June, to reach the new positions. (Resistance at two of the Bresle crossings by D Company of the 4th Border and A Company of the 1st/5th Sherwood Forester, which did not receive the retreat order, may have slowed a German follow-up, the two companies holding on for another six days until on 13 June, they realised that hostilities north of the Seine had ended.) The survivors of the Support Group in the &quot;Basse forêt d&#x27;Eu&quot; joined the remains of the &quot;2e&quot; DLC and &quot;5e&quot; DLC in &quot;Forêt d&#x27;Eawy&quot;. The Tenth Army HQ has lost contact with IX Corps and the 51st (Highland) Division lost contact with everyone, until a dispatch rider arrived from Le Havre with a message from the British commander in Le Havre, that the Port admiral had reported that the Germans had reached Rouen. Fortune conferred with Ihler and both agreed to retreat to Le Havre.

On the night of the rest of the 51st (Highland) Division blew the bridges over the Arques and the Eaulne, where the Germans promptly attacked. The 4th Seaforth and the 1st Black Watch managed to hold on, despite attacks at Arques la Bataille and Martigny, where the artillery repulsed several German advances. The &quot;panzer&quot; divisions had turned north from Rouen towards Dieppe and captured the Arkforce wireless lorry near Carny on the Durdent river at The river was the next position the 51st Highland Division was to retire to after dark and a reconnaissance by the 1st Lothian found the Germans on the river crossings at Veulettes-sur-Mer close to the coast too. German tanks were reported from divisional headquarters that afternoon and rear parties moving westwards preparatory to the retreat that night, ran into German troops. At , part of the destroyer force that had been giving the division fire support for several days, was damaged by German artillery on the cliffs near St. Valery-en-Caux and was hit while embarking troops from the beach; IX Corps had been cut off from Le Havre.

==Operation Cycle==

===St Valery-en-Caux===

Admiral William James, the Commander-in-Chief Portsmouth, had arrived at Le Havre on 10 June, ordered destroyers to reconnoitre the smaller ports to the east and learned of the damage to &quot;Ambuscade&quot; and &quot;Boadicea&quot;; James signalled to the Admiralty that he planned to lift a large number of men from the port and that it must be done that night, if at all. The retreat to the coast began after dark and the last troops left the Béthune at without challenge. Fortune signalled to the War Office that there were two days&#x27; rations left and that evacuation from St Valery to the mouth of the Durdent would be necessary. Units were ordered to dump non-essential equipment and guns were reduced to each to make room on the RASC transport for the men. The night move was difficult as French troops, many horse-drawn, encroached on the British route and alarmist rumours spread.

Fortune and Ihler set up near Veules-les-Roses to direct troops and by the morning of 11 June, IX Corps had established defensive positions around St Valery. French transport continued to arrive at the perimeter and it was difficult in some places to recognise German troops following up, which inhibited defensive fire. That evening, the captain of &quot;Codrington&quot; was ordered to begin the evacuation and two hours later, Fortune signalled that it was probably now or never. Troops not needed to hold the perimeter moved down to the beaches and the harbour but no ships arrived, because thick fog prevented them from moving inshore. An armada of ships and craft had been assembled but few had wireless and the fog prevented visual signalling; only at Veules-les-Roses at the east end of the perimeter, were many soldiers rescued, under fire from German artillery, which damaged the destroyers , &quot;Boadicea&quot; and &quot;Ambuscade&quot;. Near dawn, the troops at the harbour were ordered back into the town and at Fortune signalled that it might still be possible to escape the next night, then discovered that the local French commander had negotiated a surrender.

===Le Havre===

On 9 June, the French port Admiral at Le Havre sent word to the 10th Army and the 51st Highland Division that the Germans had captured Rouen and were heading for the coast. Ihler, the IX Corps commander and Fortune, decided that the only hope of escape was through Le Havre and abandoned the plan to retire through Rouen. The port admiral requested enough ships from the Admiralty to remove but this contradicted the plans given by Weygand for the IX Corps retirement and Dill hesitated, ignorant that delays in issuing the orders had made the retreat plan impossible. Karslake had also urged several times that the retirement be accelerated but had no authority to issue orders. Only after contacting the Howard-Vyse Military Mission at Weygand&#x27;s headquarters, to report the request from the Le Havre port Admiral and then receiving a message during the night from Fortune, that the 51st (Highland) Division was participating in a retreat by IX Corps towards Le Havre, did Dill learn the true situation.

Fortune detached a force to guard Le Havre comprising the 154th Infantry Brigade, A Brigade of the Beauman Division, two artillery regiments and engineers, named Arkforce (Brigadier Stanley-Clarke) after the village of Arques-la-Bataille, where it was formed. Arkforce moved on the night of towards Fécamp, where most had passed through before the 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division arrived. A Brigade managed to force its way out but lost the wireless truck intended to keep contact with the 51st (Highland) Division. The possibility of holding a line from Fécamp to Lillebonne was discounted and Stanley-Clarke ordered Arkforce on to Le Havre. A Royal Navy demolition party had been in Le Havre since late May and the port was severely bombed by the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; on 7 June; two days later, the Admiralty sent orders for an evacuation. Admiral William James, the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth sent a flotilla leader, across the channel, accompanied by six British and two Canadian destroyers, smaller craft and many Dutch coasters (known as schuyts).

A hasty plan was made to block Dieppe harbour and on 10 June, (Captain G. A. Garnon-Williams) escorted three blockships to the port. Two were sunk in the approach channel but the third ship hit a mine just outside, which prevented it being sunk at the entrance to the inner harbour. (James had signalled that many IX Corps troops would probably be trapped against the sea near St. Valery, where he had assembled flotillas of smaller craft under the local Senior Naval Officer.) Beach parties landed at Le Havre to take control of the evacuation on 10 June and after a 24-hour postponement, the evacuation began on 11 June. The embarkation was hindered somewhat by the damage to the port caused by &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; bombing; the troopship , was hit and beached, the electric power was also cut, rendering the cranes on the docks useless. Ramps were tried for vehicle loading but it was too slow. On 12 June, RAF fighters began patrolling the port and deterred more raids and an attempt was made to save the transport and equipment by diverting it over the Seine via the ferry crossings at Caudebec or the ships at Quillebeuf at the river mouth. The quartermaster of the 14th Royal Fusiliers succeeded in getting the transport away.

==Aftermath==

===Evacuations===
A total of and soldiers were lifted from Veules-les-Roses but the remainder, including over of the 51st (Highland) Division, were taken prisoner on 12 June by the 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division (General Erwin Rommel). The 7th &quot;Panzer&quot; Division continued its advance through Normandy and reached Cherbourg on 18 June. The greatest number of troops were removed from Le Havre on the night of and the evacuation was completed by dawn; of the troops evacuated, of A Brigade of the Beauman Division were taken to Cherbourg and the 154th Infantry Brigade sailed via Cherbourg to England.

===Analysis===
Army Group B had attacked either side of Paris with 47 divisions including the majority of the mobile units and for the first 48 hours, the French withstood the German attacks. The 4th Army captured bridgeheads over the Somme but the attack on the Aisne failed against the French defence in depth. At Amiens, the Germans were repulsed several times by French artillery fire. Late on the third day of the offensive the Germans managed to cross the Somme and Aisne despite bombing by the &quot;Armée de l&#x27;Air&quot; (French Air Force). The German success was costly and French troops resisted from woods and other cover, where the Germans had broken through. South of Abbeville, the German XV Corps avoided the woods roads and villages, to move over the slightly undulating country where there were few ditches, the tanks leading and infantry vehicles following. The Tenth Army was broken through and retreated to Rouen and southwards along the Seine. German spearheads were vulnerable to flank attacks but operations obstructed French attempts to concentrate and the fear of air attack negated the mass and mobility of the French armies.

On 6 June, documents recovered from a dead German officer, gave the German programme for 7 and 8 June. Beauman, Evans and Marshall-Cornwall discussed the find at the Tenth Army HQ but Karslake was omitted, despite being the senior British officer in France. German forces were to reach the area of Forges-les-Eaux in the area of the Beauman Division and capture Rouen on 8 June. During the meeting, the isolated position of the 51st (Highland) Division and doubts about French assurances, were discussed and the view was taken that the division was doomed. Karslake had already made representations to the CIGS about the lack of unity of command but on 6 June, Dill had written to the Swayne Mission at Georges&#x27;s HQ that Brooke could be expected the following week and that the 52nd (Lowland) Division was due soon. Dill sent Pownall to France to discuss the new BEF with the French and to liaise with British commanders and Karslake told him that it was vital to withdraw the 51st (Highland) Division before it was too late. Karslake also urged Pownall to get Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke to France and establish a corps headquarters, to unify the command of all British forces, not necessarily under the authority of Altmayer, the Tenth Army commander. Although Brooke had been placed in command of the new BEF on 2 June, he remained in Britain until 12 June, by when the 51st (Highland) Division had been trapped and forced to surrender along with the rest of IX Corps.

===Subsequent operations===

====2nd BEF====

Brooke had returned from Dunkirk on 30 May and on 2 June, was told by Field Marshal John Dill to go back to France to assemble another BEF, with the 51st (Highland) Division and 1st Armoured Division that were already in France. The 52nd Lowland Division and the 1st Canadian Division from Britain, were to be followed by the 3rd Division as soon as it was re-equipped. The II Corps headquarters had been spread around Britain after its return from Dunkirk and his first choice of chief of staff was busy with Lord Gort the former BEF commander, writing dispatches. Brook warned Dill and the Secretary of State for War, Anthony Eden that the enterprise was futile, except as a political gesture. Brook was told that on return to France he would come under the authority of Weygand. In France, Fonblanque was still in command of the lines-of-communication troops of the original BEF and lieutenant-generals Henry Karslake and James Marshall-Cornwall were assisting with command. A brigade group of the 52nd Lowland Division departed for France on 7 June but Brooke took until 12 June to arrive.

On 13 June, the RAF made a maximum effort to help the French armies that had been broken through on the Marne. The Germans were across the Seine in the west and the French armies near Paris fell back, dividing the Tenth Army, part on the channel coast and the rest retiring towards Paris. The German advance threatened the airfields of the AASF, which was ordered to retreat towards Nantes or Bordeaux, while supporting the French armies for as long as they kept fighting. The AASF flew armed reconnaissance sorties over the Seine from dawn and German columns were attacked by a force of then a second formation of and then On the Marne, attacked a concentration of German troops and tanks, followed by an attack by which lost six shot down and then a third attack by from Bomber Command that lost another four. RAF attacks continued through the night, with over the Seine, of Paris, the Marne and road and rail communications and against woods reported by the French to be full of German troops. Fighter sorties had been hampered by bad weather and were limited to coastal patrols.

Next day attacks resumed against German units south of the Seine but the weather had worsened and fewer sorties were flown. A raid by with fighter escort was made on Merville airfield for a loss of seven aircraft and ten Fighter Command squadrons patrolled twice in squadron strength or provided bomber escorts, in the biggest effort since Dunkirk, as fighters of the AASF patrolled south of the Seine. During the night, attacked German marshalling yards, forests and dropped mines in the Rhine, for a loss of two aircraft. The remnants of the 1st Armoured Division and two brigades of the Beauman Division were south of the river, along with thousands of lines-of-communication troops but only the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which had commenced disembarkation on 7 June, engaged in military operations, occupying successive defensive, positions under command of the Tenth Army. The French armies were forced into divergent retreats, with no obvious front line; on 12 June, Weygand had recommended that the French government seek an armistice, which led to the abortive plan to create a defensive zone in Brittany.

On 14 June, Brooke was able to prevent the rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division being sent to join the 157th Infantry Brigade and during the night he was informed that he was no longer under French command and must prepare to withdraw the British forces from France. Marshall-Cornwall was ordered to take command of all British forces under the Tenth Army as Norman Force and while continuing to co-operate, withdraw towards Cherbourg. The rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered back to a defence line near Cherbourg to cover the evacuation on 15 June. The AASF was also directed to send the last bomber squadrons back to Britain and use the fighter squadrons to cover the evacuations. The German advance over the Seine had paused while bridges were built but the advance began again during the day, with the 157th Infantry Brigade engaged east of Conches-en-Ouche with the Tenth Army. The army was ordered to retreat to a line from Verneuil to Argentan and the Dives river, where the British took over an front, either side of the Mortagne-au-Perche–Verneuil-sur-Avre road. German forces followed up quickly and on 16 June, Altmayer ordered the army to retreat into the Brittany peninsula. Operation Aerial, the final Allied evacuation, had begun on 15 June.

====Breton redoubt====
On 29 May, the Prime Minister of France, Paul Reynaud, replied to Weygand, rejecting his recommendation that an armistice be considered and asked him to study the possibility that a &quot;national redoubt&quot; could be established around a naval port in the Brittany peninsula, to retain freedom of the seas and contact with French allies. The idea was discussed by the French and British governments on 31 May and an operational instruction was drawn up on 5 June, in which Lieutenant-General Alan Brooke was appointed to command the new BEF (&quot;2nd BEF&quot;) being prepared for France. Plan &quot;W&quot;, the original plan to land the BEF in 1939 was used, with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division being directed to Cherbourg, to assemble at Evreux, ready to support the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division (major-General Victor Fortune), north of the Seine. On 6 June, Weygand issued orders to begin work on the redoubt, under the command of General René Altmayer.

German forces crossed the Seine on 9 June, cutting off the 51st (Highland) Division north of the river, two days after 52nd (Lowland) Division had begun to land and the assembly of the division was changed to Rennes in Brittany; the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade which arrived first, was directed to Beaumont near Le Mans, the rest of the division to follow on. The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to Sablé-sur-Sarthe, on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army and attached British troops to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council met at Briare and General Charles de Gaulle (Minister of War) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, De Gaulle reported that Quimper would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since it would be easy to take ship to England or Africa, since the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.

Altmayer had reported that work had begun on defences, civilian labour had been recruited and troops had arrived to begin work, despite a lack of civil engineering machinery. Churchill visited France for the last time on 13 June, met Reynaud and approved the project. Brook had visited the 1st Canadian Division in England to give the gist of the plan and met Weygand and Georges at Briare on 14 June. It was agreed that the plan was futile but the will of the civilian leadership must be respected and a joint agreement was signed. Brook telephoned Dill in London to find that no agreement had been made with the French and after checking called with the news that &quot;Mr. Churchill knew nothing about the Brittany project&quot;. Churchill &quot;was&quot; of the view that the new corps forming in France should stay, at least until the final French collapse and then return through the nearest port. Without the support of the 52nd Division on the left flank, the Tenth Army was cut off from Brittany, when two German divisions got into the peninsula first and forced the French line of retreat south to the Loire. French troops already in the area were able to join the main French force, after the Canadians had departed for England.

<text>Operation Aerial was the evacuation of Allied military forces and civilians from ports in western France. The operation took place from 15 to 25 June 1940 during the Second World War. The embarkation followed the Allied military collapse in the Battle of France against Nazi Germany. Operation Dynamo, the evacuation from Dunkirk and Operation Cycle from Le Havre, had finished on 13 June. British and Allied ships were covered from French bases by five Royal Air Force (RAF) fighter squadrons and assisted by aircraft based in England to lift British, Polish and Czech troops, civilians and equipment from Atlantic ports, particularly from St Nazaire and Nantes.

On 17 June, the evaded RAF fighter patrols and attacked evacuation ships in the Loire estuary, sinking the Cunard liner and troopship HMT which was carrying thousands of troops, RAF personnel and civilians. The ship sank quickly but nearby vessels went to the rescue and saved about and crew while under air attack. The death toll is unknown because the passenger count broke down in the haste to embark as many people as possible. Estimates of at least make the sinking the greatest loss of life in a British ship. The British government tried to keep the sinking of &quot;Lancastria&quot; secret on the orders of the Prime Minister Winston Churchill.

Some equipment was embarked on the evacuation ships but alarmist reports about the progress of the German Army towards the coast led some operations to be terminated early and much equipment was destroyed or left behind. The official evacuation ended on 25 June, in conformity with the terms of the Armistice of 22 June 1940 agreed by the French and German authorities but informal departures continued from French Mediterranean ports until 14 August. From the end of Operation Dynamo at Dunkirk, Operation Cycle from Le Havre, elsewhere along the Channel coast and the termination of Operation Aerial, another were rescued, bringing the total of military and civilian personnel returned to Britain during the Battle of France to British troops.

==Background==

===Royal Navy===
The evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force (BEF) from Dunkirk left a surplus of men on the lines-of-communication, base depots and other establishments among the still in France. Sufficient lines-of-communication personnel for an armoured division and four infantry divisions and an Advanced Air Striking Force (AASF) were to be retained and the rest returned to Britain. Naval operations in the Norwegian Campaign and the evacuation of Dunkirk had suffered losses, which temporarily weakened the Home Fleet, particularly in smaller vessels needed to escort evacuation ships from the French Atlantic coast. Losses inflicted on the surface ships of the &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot; made it impossible for the Germans to challenge British naval supremacy in the English Channel and the Bay of Biscay. Seven German submarines patrolling off the west coast of France made no attempt to interfere and only the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; was used against the evacuations. Operation Aerial was commanded by Admiral William Milbourne James, the Commander-in-Chief, Portsmouth. James lacked the vessels necessary for convoys and organised a flow of troopships, storeships and motor vehicle vessels from Southampton, coasters to ply from Poole and the Dutch &quot;schuyts&quot; to work from Weymouth, while such warships as were available patrolled the shipping routes. Demolition parties sailed in the ships but it was hoped that supplies and equipment could be embarked as well as troops.

===RAF===

After Dunkirk, the AASF squadrons in France had been moved to the area between Orléans and Le Mans during the lull before &quot;Fall Rot&quot; (&quot;Case Red&quot;), the German offensive over the Somme and Aisne rivers. From the new bases the AASF was able to operate anywhere along the front, but after the German breakthrough on 11 June, British Air Forces in France (Air Vice-Marshal Arthur Barratt) was warned by the Air Ministry to be ready for a quick getaway from France. The British squadrons were moved west to bases around Angers, Saumur, Rennes and Nantes, which were already full of French aircraft and severely congested. Barratt sent the light bomber squadrons back to England on 15 June and kept the five fighter squadrons to cover the evacuation of RAF ground staff and the three British divisions commanded by Brooke.

After Marshal Philippe Pétain requested an armistice on 17 June, Barratt had to defend seven ports on the Atlantic coast and sent the AASF anti-aircraft batteries to La Pallice and La Rochelle, the least important embarkation harbours. Nantes and St Nazaire, the most important ports, were covered by 1 Squadron, 73 Squadron and 242 Squadron, with a small detachment covering Brest. Saint-Malo and Cherbourg were protected by 17 Squadron and 501 Squadron from the aerodrome at Dinard across the bay from Saint-Malo, then later from the Channel Islands. Fighter Command squadrons from RAF Tangmere were also available for Cherbourg and Coastal Command prepared to escort returning ships. Once the arrangements were made, Barratt left for England and the Senior Air Staff Officer (SASO), Air Vice-Marshal Douglas Evill took over.

===Operations Dynamo and Cycle===

Operation Dynamo, the evacuation at Dunkirk from 26 May to 3 June, had rescued much of the fighting element of the BEF. Some units from the 1st Armoured Division, the Beauman Division and more than and line-of-communication troops, had been cut off in the south by the German dash to the sea. By the end of May, medical stores had been removed from Dieppe and a demolition party landed, ready to blow up the port infrastructure. A big depot at Le Havre had been run down by feeding troops in the area from it and removing military stores not immediately needed. A reserve of motor transport collected at Rouen had been used as transport for improvised units and specialised ammunition had been moved from the reserve around Buchy but the removal of the huge quantity of ordinary ammunition there was impossible.

On 9 June, the French commander at Le Havre contacted the 10th Army and the 51st (Highland) Division with a message that the Germans had captured Rouen and were heading for the coast. Ihler, the IX Corps commander and Major-General Victor Fortune, commander of the 51st (Highland) Division, decided that the only hope of escape was through Le Havre and abandoned the plan to retire through Rouen. The port admiral requested enough ships from the Admiralty to remove but this contradicted the plans of the French supreme commander, Maxime Weygand. General John Dill (Chief of the Imperial General Staff) hesitated, ignorant that Weygand&#x27;s delay in issuing the orders had made it impossible. Karslake had also urged several times that the retirement be accelerated but had no authority to issue orders. Only after receiving a message during the night from Fortune, that the 51st (Highland) Division was participating in a retreat by IX Corps towards Le Havre, did Dill learn of the true situation.

Fortune detached a force to guard Le Havre comprising the 154th Infantry Brigade, &quot;A&quot; Brigade of the Beauman Division, two artillery regiments and engineers. Arkforce (Brigadier Stanley-Clarke), moved on the night of towards Fécamp, where most had passed through before the 7th Panzer Division arrived. &quot;A&quot; Brigade forced its way out but lost the wireless truck intended to keep contact with the 51st (Highland) Division. The possibility of holding a line from Fécamp to Lillebonne was discounted and Stanley-Clarke ordered Arkforce on to Le Havre. A Royal Navy demolition party had been in Le Havre since late May and the port was severely bombed by the on 7 June; two days later, the Admiralty sent orders for an evacuation. James sent a flotilla leader, , across the Channel, accompanied by six British and two Canadian destroyers, smaller craft and many Dutch .
A plan was hastily made to block Dieppe harbour and on 10 June, (Captain G. A. Garnon-Williams) escorted three blockships to the port. Two were sunk in the approach channel but the third ship hit a mine just outside, which prevented it being sunk at the entrance to the inner harbour. Beach parties landed at Le Havre to take control of the evacuation on 10 June and after a 24-hour postponement, the evacuation began on 11 June. The embarkation was hindered somewhat by the damage to the port caused by bombing; the troopship was damaged and had to be beached. Electrical power to the docks was cut, rendering the cranes on the docks useless; loading vehicles via ramps was tried but was too slow. On 12 June, RAF fighters began patrolling the port, deterring more raids and an attempt was made to save the transport and equipment by diverting it over the Seine, via the ferry crossings at Caudebec or the ships at Quillebeuf at the river mouth. The quartermaster of the 14th Royal Fusiliers succeeded in getting the transport away. The greatest number of troops were removed on the night of and the evacuation was completed by dawn; of troops evacuated, of &#x27;A&#x27; Brigade were taken to Cherbourg and the 154th Infantry Brigade sailed via Cherbourg to England.

====St Valery-en-Caux====
On 10 June British destroyers reconnoitred the smaller ports to the east of Le Havre. was damaged by artillery fire from the cliffs near St. Valery-en-Caux during the evening. Troops not needed to hold the perimeter at St Valery moved down to the beaches and the harbour but no ships arrived; thick fog prevented them from moving inshore. An armada of ships and craft had been assembled but few had wireless and the fog obscured visual signalling. Only at Veules-les-Roses were many soldiers rescued, under fire from German artillery, which damaged the destroyers , and &quot;Ambuscade&quot;. Near dawn, the troops at the harbour were ordered back into the town, only to discover that the local French commander had already negotiated a surrender. A total of and soldiers were rescued but over of the 51st (Highland) Division were taken prisoner on 12 June.

==Prelude==
===2nd BEF===
On 2 June, Brooke visited the War Office, having returned from Dunkirk on 30 May and was told by Dill to go back to France to assemble another BEF. In the emergency, the force would be the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division and 1st Armoured Division, already in France, with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division and the 1st Canadian Infantry Division from Britain, to be followed by the 3rd Infantry Division as soon as it was re-equipped. The II Corps headquarters was spread around Britain after its return from Dunkirk and his first choice of chief of staff was busy with General Lord Gort, the former BEF commander, writing dispatches. Brooke warned Dill and the secretary of state for war, Anthony Eden, that the enterprise was futile, except as a political gesture. He was told that on return to France he would come under the authority of Weygand. In France, Fonblanque was still in command of the lines-of-communication troops of the original BEF and lieutenant-generals Henry Karslake and James Marshall-Cornwall were assisting with command. A brigade group (the 157th (Highland Light Infantry) Brigade) of the 52nd (Lowland) Division departed for France on 7 June and Brooke returned five days later.

On 13 June, the RAF made a maximum effort to help the French armies that had been broken through on the Marne. The Germans were across the Seine in the west and the French armies near Paris fell back, isolating the Tenth Army on the Channel coast. The German advance threatened the airfields of the AASF, which was ordered to retreat towards Nantes or Bordeaux, while supporting the French armies for as long as they kept fighting. The AASF flew armed reconnaissance sorties over the Seine from dawn and German columns were attacked by a force of then a second formation of followed by On the Marne, attacked a concentration of German troops and tanks, followed by an attack by which lost six aircraft and then a third attack by from Bomber Command, that lost another four. RAF attacks continued through the night, with over the Seine, of Paris, the Marne and road and rail communications and woods reported by the French to be full of German troops. Fighter sorties had been hampered by bad weather and were limited to coastal patrols.

Next day, attacks resumed against German units south of the Seine but the weather had worsened and fewer sorties were flown. A raid by with fighter escort was made on Merville airfield for a loss of ; ten Fighter Command squadrons patrolled twice in squadron strength or provided bomber escorts, the biggest effort since Dunkirk, as fighters of the AASF patrolled south of the Seine. During the night, attacked German marshalling yards and forests, and dropped mines in the Rhine river for a loss of two aircraft. The remnants of the 1st Armoured Division and two brigades of the Beauman Division were south of the river, along with thousands of lines-of-communication troops; but only the 157th Infantry Brigade of the 52nd (Lowland) Division, which had commenced disembarkation on 7 June, engaged in military operations. The brigade occupied successive defensive positions under command of the Tenth Army. The French armies were forced into divergent retreats with no obvious front line; on 12 June, Weygand had recommended that the French government seek an armistice, which led to the abortive plan to create a defensive zone in Brittany.

On 14 June, Brooke was able to prevent the rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division being sent to join the 157th Infantry Brigade Group. During the night Brooke was informed that he was no longer under French command and must prepare to withdraw the British forces from France. Marshall-Cornwall was ordered to take command of all British forces under the Tenth Army as Norman Force and while continuing to co-operate, withdraw towards Cherbourg. The rest of the 52nd (Lowland) Division was ordered back to a defence line near Cherbourg to cover the evacuation on 15 June. The AASF was also directed to send the last bomber squadrons back to Britain and use the fighter squadrons to cover the evacuations. The German advance over the Seine had paused while bridges were built but the advance began again during the day, with the 157th Infantry Brigade Group engaged east of Conches-en-Ouche with the Tenth Army. The army was ordered to retreat to a line from Verneuil to Argentan and the Dives river, where the British took over an front either side of the Mortagne-au-Perche–Verneuil-sur-Avre road. German forces followed up quickly and on 16 June, the Tenth Army commander, General Robert Altmayer, ordered the army to retreat into the Brittany peninsula.

====Breton redoubt====
On 29 May the Prime Minister of France, Paul Reynaud, replied to Weygand, rejecting his recommendation that an armistice be considered and asked him to study the possibility that a national redoubt could be established around a naval port in the Brittany peninsula to retain freedom of the seas and contact with French allies. The idea was discussed by the French and British governments on 31 May and an operational instruction was drawn up on 5 June, in which Brooke was appointed to command the new BEF (&quot;2nd BEF&quot;) being prepared for France. Plan W, the original plan to land the BEF in 1939, was used with the 52nd (Lowland) Infantry Division being directed to Cherbourg and to assemble at Evreux, ready to support the 51st (Highland) Infantry Division north of the Seine. On 6 June, Weygand issued orders to begin work on the redoubt under the command of General René Altmayer.

German forces crossed the Seine on 9 June, cutting off the 51st (Highland) Division north of the river, two days after 52nd (Lowland) Division had begun to land and the assembly point of the division was changed to Rennes in Brittany; the 157th Infantry Brigade, which had arrived first, was directed to Beaumont near Le Mans; the rest of the division to follow on. The 1st Canadian Infantry Brigade of the 1st Canadian Infantry Division began its arrival at Brest on 11 June and was sent to Sablé-sur-Sarthe, on the assumption that two fresh divisions would be enough to allow the Tenth Army to retreat through them and take up positions prepared around the Brest peninsula. That day, the Anglo-French Supreme War Council met at Briare and General Charles de Gaulle (minister of war) was sent to Rennes to survey progress on the redoubt; on 12 June, de Gaulle reported that Quimper would be a favourable place for the government to retreat to, since it would be easy to take ship to England or Africa; the prospect of maintaining a redoubt in Brittany was non-existent.

Altmayer had reported that work had begun on defences, civilian labour had been recruited and troops had arrived to begin work, despite a lack of civil engineering machinery. Churchill visited France for the last time on 13 June, met Reynaud and approved the project. Brooke had visited the 1st Canadian Division in England to give the gist of the plan and met Weygand and Georges at Briare on 14 June, where all agreed that the plan was futile but the will of the civilian leadership had to be respected and the generals signed a joint agreement. Brooke telephoned Dill in London to find that no agreement had been made with the French and after checking called with the news that &quot;Mr. Churchill knew nothing about the Brittany project&quot;. Churchill &quot;was&quot; of the view that the new corps forming in France should stay, at least until the final French collapse, then return through the nearest port. Without the support of the 52nd (Lowland) Division on the left flank, the Tenth Army was cut off from Brittany when two German divisions reached the peninsula first and forced the French line of retreat south to the Loire. French troops already in the area were able to join the main French force after the Canadians had departed for England.

==Evacuations==

===Cherbourg and Saint-Malo===

Initially headquarters in England were reluctant to accept that evacuation was necessary, and on 15 June Alan Brooke was told by Dill that &quot;for political reasons&quot; the two brigades of the 52nd Division under Drew could not be embarked from Cherbourg at present. After further telephone discussions that day with Dill and Eden, when he said shipping and &quot;valuable hours&quot; were being wasted, he got permission to embark the gunners but not the infantry. Most of the 52nd Lowland Division and the remnants of the 1st Armoured Division embarked from 15 to 17 June. The Beauman Division and Norman Force, both improvised formations, left on the evening of 17 June.

The rearguard battalion was evacuated in the afternoon of 18 June. A total of were rescued from Cherbourg and taken to Portsmouth. At Saint-Malo, mostly of the 1st Canadian Division, were evacuated from all but being British; no-one was killed and no ship was damaged. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; tried to intervene but was thwarted by the RAF; the 1st Canadian Division suffered only six losses during its brief excursion to the Continent; five men were reported missing and one man was killed; four of the missing were interned and then made it back to England.

===Brest===
The evacuation from the southern ports on the Bay of Biscay was commanded by Admiral Sir Martin Dunbar-Nasmith, the Commander-in-Chief of Western Approaches Command based in Devonport. The evacuation was made more difficult by a lack of information from Brest, St Nazaire and Nantes. Brest is a port city in the Finistère département in Brittany in north-west France, where a sense of urgency was communicated by the Cabinet in London and the evacuation was conducted quickly, albeit with some confusion; guns and vehicles which could have been removed were destroyed needlessly. The Germans were known to be in Paris and advancing southwards, but information about German progress was inaccurate, mainly being rumour. The ships, including the &quot;Arandora Star&quot;, &quot;Strathaird&quot; and &quot;Otranto&quot; rescued and personnel, mostly RAF ground crew from and the ships with room to spare were sent south to St Nazaire and the French wrecked the harbour facilities with assistance from the British demolition party. The French ships sailed and on 19 June the demolition party was removed aboard the destroyer .

===St Nazaire and Nantes===

Saint-Nazaire in Brittany is a commune in the Loire-Atlantique department and Nantes is the capital of the Pays de la Loire region, in the same and is the largest city in Brittany. Operations at St Nazaire, at the mouth of the Loire, where there were strong tides and other hazards to navigation and Nantes upriver, took place concurrently. Vague and contradictory information led the navy to believe that men were en route to Nantes but not when they would arrive. To lift so many men, Dunbar-Nasmith assembled the destroyers , and and the liners , , , RMS , the Polish ships and and several commercial cargo ships.

The ships had to anchor in Quiberon Bay, north-west of the Loire estuary, despite having no anti-submarine defences. The evacuation began on 16 June, with leaving for home on &quot;Georgic&quot;, &quot;Duchess of York&quot; and the two Polish ships. German bombers attacked the bay but were only able to damage &quot;Franconia&quot;. Loading of equipment continued overnight and more ships from England and Brest arrived, along with two more destroyers, and . The large troopships would have been exceedingly vulnerable, had German bombers been able to make daylight attacks. British fighter cover restricted the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; to mine-laying, which only delayed movement until channels were swept. The RAF fighters each flew up to six sorties per day and the final patrol over Nantes was flown by 73 Squadron, then the last airworthy Hawker Hurricane flew to RAF Tangmere.

The last troops left for Plymouth at on 18 June in two convoys comprising merchant ships; much equipment was abandoned after alarmist reports led to the convoys sailing in haste. In the afternoon, Dunbar-Nasmith heard that troops were approaching the port and sent six destroyers and seven troop transports to St Nazaire, which arrived on 19 June but only appeared; no German forces were in hot pursuit. Unserviceable Hurricanes were burned by their ground crews, a staff car was given to a friendly local café proprietor and an airman tried to sell off an Austin 7. The rear parties then departed in transport aircraft, a few hours before German tanks arrived. On the journey home during the night of &quot;Floristan&quot;, a merchantman with on board, of the and civilians in its convoy, was attacked by a being under way, dodged the bombs as soldiers fired back with Bren guns and riddled the cockpit. The bomber carried away the mast tops and aerial, then crashed into the sea to the cheers of the rest of the convoy.

====&quot;Lancastria&quot;====

On 17 June, there were still about waiting ashore, many at St Nazaire; ferrying men to the big ships offshore resumed early in the morning, soon joined by lighters, tenders and destroyers. The men being transported were reinforcements and lines-of-communication troops, tradesmen, labourers, mechanics and engineers of the Royal Army Service Corps (RASC), pioneers and tradesmen in RAF maintenance units from Nantes aerodrome. Several merchantmen and railway ferries from the Dover–Calais route were among the armada off St Nazaire but the largest ship was the &quot;Lancastria&quot; of the Cunard Line. &quot;Lancastria&quot; was normally permitted to carry and but in the emergency Captain R. Sharp was ordered to take as many troops as could be crammed on board. Among the military personnel were about including embassy staff, men from Avions Fairey in Belgium and their families.

As the boarding progressed, a soldier heard Sharp and his chief officer, H. Grattidge, say that were on the ship, as a lighter came alongside and Sharp decide that it would be the last to deliver passengers. Sharp and Grattidge kept watch on the sky as aircraft fought above the Loire estuary and German bombers tried to hit about distant; at &quot;Oronsay&quot; was bombed and part of the bridge destroyed. Sharp was advised by the captain of &quot;Havelock&quot; to leave at once but for fear of U-boats, Sharp wanted a destroyer escort. No destroyer was forthcoming and Sharp decided to leave with &quot;Oronsay&quot;; &quot;Lancastria&quot; stayed at anchor rather than being made a moving target. At more German bombers appeared, while the RAF Hurricanes were at the far end of their patrol line and a bomber hit &quot;Lancastria&quot; with three or four bombs. The ship tilted to starboard, the bridge crew shouted for everyone to go to the port side and &quot;Lancastria&quot; came level again, then keeled over to port.

Grattidge called out &quot;Your attention please. Clear away boats&quot;; there were far too few for the number of people crammed aboard and some boats had been smashed in the bombing. After the remaining lifeboats had been launched, some sinking in the process after falling into the sea or being swamped, the order &quot;every man for himself&quot; was given. Some men in life jackets, jumped overboard from the starboard side and broke their necks, others walked down the side of the hull, where they could see the men trapped inside through portholes and stepped into the water as the ship settled. Once in the water, they were strafed by German bombers, which also dropped flares on patches of oil and burned alive some of the shipwrecked men. While &quot;Lancastria&quot; was on its side, the hull was covered by men who could not swim, singing &quot;Roll Out the Barrel&quot; until they sank with the ship, about fifteen minutes after the bombing. As time passed, exhaustion and despair led people in the sea to give up and slip underwater. About were rescued but more than women and children were killed.

===La Pallice===
La Pallice, the &quot;grand port maritime de La Rochelle&quot; is the commercial, deep water port of La Rochelle. A senior British naval officer arrived by destroyer on 16 June and the evacuation began the next day. The naval officer found and no transports so requisitioned ships in the port, embarked the troops less their transport and departed on 18 June. Ships included the British flagged MV &quot;Thistleglen&quot; (Captain G. F. Dobson) which embarked and a contingent of British nurses. Dunbar-Nasmith sent ships twice more, which picked up troops on 19 June. Few men were found on 20 June and surplus ships were sent south to the Gironde ports. Most of the British troops in France had gone but more Polish and Czech troops, embassy and consular staffs, British and other civilians remained.

===Other Atlantic ports===

Bordeaux and Le Verdon-sur-Mer are ports on the Garonne River in the Gironde department in Aquitaine. Bayonne at the confluence of the Nive and Adour rivers and St Jean-de-Luz are ports and communes in the Pyrénées-Atlantiques , all four ports being on the south-west coast of France. was stationed off Bordeaux on 16 June as a wireless link and on 17 June, British and some Allied ships were cleared for England and the embarkation of Polish and Czech troops and civilians began. A (Lieutenant-Commander H. G. Walters) had been made available to Reynaud and the French government, also as a venue for discussions with Churchill and on 19 June, the ship evacuated the remaining British Consular staff from Bordeaux. British diplomatic staff, the President of Poland and his cabinet were given preferential treatment.

&quot;Berkeley&quot; was replaced by the cruiser and sailed for England with the VIPs. Evacuation continued at the nearby ports of Le Verdon at the river mouth and Bayonne, where on 19 June, the Polish ships &quot;Batory&quot; and &quot;Sobieski&quot; took about 9,000 Polish soldiers on board and the British and took on everyone they could find and sailed for St Jean-de-Luz on 20 June. The evacuation at St Jean de Luz ended &quot;officially&quot; at on 25 June, just after the deadline set by the terms of the armistice, with the sailing of the cargo ships , and , loaded with troops and civilians; about 19,000 people were lifted from Bayonne and St Jean de Luz, most being Polish troops. On the final day of the operation, the Canadian destroyer was accidentally rammed and sunk with many losses by the anti-aircraft cruiser in the Gironde estuary. Evacuations continued informally from the Mediterranean coast of France, until 14 August. On 23 June, the Admiralty gave orders that every available ship was to take anyone who could be squeezed on board to Gibraltar, thence to Britain. Small cargo ships organised by two destroyers removed about 10,000 Allied troops and civilians from 24 to 26 June.

==Aftermath==
===Analysis===

In 1953, Lionel Ellis, the British official historian, wrote that by the end of the informal evacuations on 14 August, another had been evacuated after the rescue of in Operation Dynamo, a total of of whom British troops. In 2001, Brodhurst wrote that many civilians escaped from French Atlantic and Mediterranean ports to England via Gibraltar and that civilians left the Channel Islands from Brodhurst gave figures of troops and civilians evacuated. Although much equipment was lost, , of ammunition, of stores, of petrol, and were recovered during Operation Aerial and the earlier evacuations. German submarines could have sunk British ships in the Bay of Biscay, many of the troopships being unescorted and out of range of England-based fighters but the seven in the area did not intervene. The &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; managed to sink &quot;Lancastria&quot; but German operations against Aerial showed a lack of co-ordination between the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; and &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;. Brodhurst wrote that the success of the operation was due to the professionalism of the Royal Navy, the decisions of middle-ranking officers like Ramsay and the conduct of the navy and civilian crews, who took grave risks to rescue the army.

In 1979, Karslake described the &quot;Breton Redoubt affair&quot; and concluded that all of the people involved knew of the scheme and all had agreed, albeit with little faith in its success, for it to go ahead. Karslake also reviewed the figures given in the official history of equipment recovered during Operation Aerial. Ellis had included equipment loaded onto ships in England but not landed in France in his figures for material recovered during the operation. Ellis recorded the recovery of the 51st (Highland) Division from Le Havre, the 52nd (Lowland) Division from Cherbourg, the 1st Canadian Division from Brest and of the Beauman Division from Cherbourg, in all, with not accounted for. Karslake wrote that some guns may have been on ships sent from England but not unloaded and could not have belonged to the two BEF anti-aircraft brigades south of the Somme; the anti-aircraft brigade protecting the lines-of-communication units and the AASF airfield defence brigade had only them. The 53rd Heavy AA Regiment reached Marseilles with its two heavy and one light batteries but could only load the light anti-aircraft guns, due to a lack of cranes and no &quot;jumbo&quot; derrick on the evacuation ship; the remaining thirteen 3-inch anti-aircraft guns having to be destroyed and left behind.

Of the brought back to Britain, most belonged to the 52nd and 1st Canadian divisions and had not been unloaded; the rest had been embarked before &quot;panic orders&quot; had been issued to the ports. Of the of ammunition recovered, Karslake had been given a priority list of small-arms ammunition, 25-pounder shells and the chemical warfare equipment dumped at Fécamp. Much of the chemical warfare material had been removed by early June and most of the rest of the ammunition brought back from France could be accounted for by a shipload not unloaded at Cherbourg on 15 June and another laden ship at St Nazaire. Of the of other stores saved, only material returned to Britain during May had been unloaded from ships and the of petrol was on a part-loaded ship which left St Nazaire on 16 June. On 4 June, Karslake had asked the CIGS to stop sending supplies but this request was ignored and troops saw more supplies being &quot;unloaded&quot; as they &quot;loaded&quot; ships for the evacuation. The 6th Battalion Royal Sussex Regiment stacked petrol tins in the Fôret de Savernay from and then set fire to it on 16 June.

As the RAF presence in France was reduced, its aviation fuel requirements fell and by 5 June most RAF aircraft had returned to England, yet deliveries continued. British armoured units were also less demanding of fuel as the number of vehicles dwindled until the main users were the transport echelons of the front-line units and the lines-of-communication troops, which could be supplied by the fuel delivered up to the end of May. Karslake wrote that the small number of armoured vehicles removed from France was a mystery and that a train with the last tanks of the 2nd Armoured Brigade and some of those of the 3rd Armoured Brigade, departed from Le Mans for St Malo and disappeared. It was rumoured that the train had been sidelined by the French and the engine removed for another train but no effort was made by the road parties outside Brest to find their vehicles. No party accompanied the vehicles and no aircraft reconnaissance was sought, even though the Germans were a long way from Brittany.

Karslake wrote that in 1939, the CIGS, General Edmund Ironside, had warned Gort and Dill the Vice-CIGS before the BEF sailed for France, to prepare defence plans for rear areas, quickly to be implemented at communication centres and geographical bottlenecks, for which even the most non-combatant troops must be trained and equipped, but during the Phoney War nothing was done. It was fortunate that Brigadier Archibald Beauman, who had been &quot;dug-out&quot; of retirement, was on hand to organise the lines-of-communication troops south of the Somme, as far as anything could be achieved in the emergency. Karslake (jnr) wrote that had General Karslake been furnished with a staff and the power of command over all British troops, rather than this being vested in the cumbersome and disorganised French command system, the disadvantages under which the lines-of-communication troops were burdened could have been alleviated. When Brooke arrived on 12 June to command the British troops in France, he had no faith in military operations, left his staff at St Malo and concentrated on ending the British presence in France as quickly as possible.

===Casualties===
From May to June, including the period of Operation Aerial, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; lost and the RAF lost killed, wounded, died of wounds or injury, injured, lost at sea or taken prisoner and including shot down, destroyed on the ground or written off. The AASF lost the Air Component Command Command Coastal Command In the course of the operations from 5 to 18 June, the AASF lost Battles, two Blenheims and Fighter Command lost a Spitfire, and three Blenheims. During the Battle of France, the British army suffered killed, died of wounds, wounded, missing or taken prisoner and died of injury or illness; navy casualties could not be separated from operations elsewhere in the world. German casualties in the battle (only a few of the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; losses occurring during Operation Aerial), were and missing.

<doc id="253776" wikidata="Q42606" url="?curid=253776" title="Amenhotep III">
<text>Amenhotep III ( , ; &quot;Amun is satisfied&quot;), also known as Amenhotep the Magnificent or Amenhotep the Great and Hellenized as Amenophis III, was the ninth pharaoh of the Eighteenth Dynasty. According to different authors following the &quot;Low Chronology&quot;, he ruled Egypt from June 1386 to 1349 BC, or from June 1388 BC to December 1351 BC/1350 BC, after his father Thutmose IV died. Amenhotep was Thutmose&#x27;s son by a minor wife, Mutemwiya.

His reign was a period of unprecedented prosperity and splendour, when Egypt reached the peak of its artistic and international power, and as such he is considered one of ancient Egypt&#x27;s greatest pharaohs.

When he died in the 38th or 39th year of his reign he was succeeded by his son Amenhotep IV, who later changed his name to Akhenaten.

== Family and early life ==

Amenhotep was the son of Thutmose IV and his minor wife Mutemwiya. He was born probably around 1401 BC. Later in his life, Amenhotep commissioned the depiction of his divine birth to be displayed at Luxor Temple. Amenhotep claimed that his true father was the god Amun, who had taken the form of Thutmose IV to father a child with Mutemwiya.

In Regnal Year 2, Amenhotep married Tiye, the daughter of Yuya and Thuya. Tiye was the Great Royal Wife throughout Amenhotep&#x27;s reign. Many commemorative scarabs were commissioned and distributed during Amenhotep&#x27;s reign. On the &quot;marriage scarabs,&quot; Amenhotep affirmed his divine power and the legitimacy of his wife. With Tiye, Amenhotep fathered at least two sons, Crown Prince Thutmose and Amenhotep IV (later called Akhenaten). In addition, several daughters are frequently credited to the couple: Sitamun, Henuttaneb, Iset, Nebetah, and Beketaten. Most of the daughters appear frequently on statues and reliefs from Amenhotep&#x27;s reign. However, Nebetah is attested only once, on a colossal limestone group of statues from Medinet Habu, and Beketaten only appears in Amarna.Amenhotep is also sometimes credited as the father of Smenkhkare or Tutankhamun, with varying proposals for their mothers, but these theories are not as accepted as his other, known children.

In addition to Tiye, Amenhotep had several other wives. In Regnal Year 10, Amenhotep married Gilukhepa, the daughter of Shuttarna II of Mitanni. He later married Tadukhepa, daughter of Tushratta of Mitanni, in or around Regnal Year 36 of his reign. Other wives, whose names are unknown, included: a daughter of Kurigalzu, king of Babylon; a daughter of Kadashman-Enlil, king of Babylon; a daughter of Tarhundaradu, ruler of Arzawa; and a daughter of the ruler of Ammia (modern-day Syria).

Finally, he married at least two of his daughters, Sitamun and Iset, in the last decade of his reign. Jar-label inscriptions from Regnal Year 30 indicate that Sitamun was elevated to the status of Great Royal Wife by that time. Although shunned by common Egyptians, incest was not uncommon among royalty. A sculpture restored by Amenhotep for his grandfather, Amenhotep II, shows Sitamun with a young prince beside her. This has led to theories that Sitamun was the mother of Smenkhkare and/or Tutankhamun.

==Life and reign==

Amenhotep probably became pharaoh when he was between the ages of 6 and 12. While it is likely that a regent would have ruled until he came of age, none is attested in the surviving records. In Regnal Year 11, Amenhotep commanded the construction of an artificial lake at Tiye&#x27;s hometown of Djakaru. He then celebrated a Festival of Opening the Lake in the third month of Inundation, day sixteen, and rowed the royal barge &quot;Aten-tjehen&quot; on the lake. This event was commemorated on at least eleven commemorative scarabs.

From other scarabs, Amenhotep is known to have killed either 102 or 110 lions in the first ten years of his reign.

Despite the martial prowess Amenhotep displayed during the hunt, he is known to have participated in only one military incident. In Regnal Year Five, he led a victorious campaign against a rebellion in Kush. This victory was commemorated by three rock-carved stelae found near Aswan and Saï in Nubia. The official account of Amenhotep&#x27;s military victory emphasizes his martial prowess with the hyperbole typical of the period.

=== Court of Amenhotep III ===
There is a significant attestation for the court officials who served during Amenhotep&#x27;s reign, primarily through the discovery of their tombs in the Theban Necropolis. Among these court officials were the viziers Ramose, Amenhotep, Aperel, and Ptahmose. Other officials included the treasurers Ptahmose and Merire; the high stewards, Amenemhat Surer and Amenhotep (Huy); and the Viceroy of Kush, Merimose.

Amenhotep, son of Hapu held many offices during the reign of Amenhotep the pharaoh, but is best known for receiving the right to build his mortuary temple behind that of the king. Amenhotep, son of Hapu, was deified after his death and was one of the few non-royals to be worshiped in such a manner.

=== Malkata Palace ===
The palace of Malkata was built in the 14th century BC and its ancient name was &quot;Per-Hay&quot;, &quot;House of Rejoicing&quot;. Originally, the palace was known as &quot;the Palace of the Dazzling Aten&quot;. Built mostly out of mud-brick, it was Amenhotep&#x27;s residence throughout most of the later part of his reign. Construction began around Regnal Year 11 and continued until the king moved to the palace permanently around Regnal Year 29. Once completed, it was the largest royal residence in Egypt.

=== Sed festivals ===
Amenhotep celebrated three Sed festivals in Regnal Years 30, 34, and 37, each at Malkata palace in Western Thebes. A temple of Amun and festival hall were built especially for the celebrations. The Sed festival was a tradition that dated to the Old Kingdom, consisting of a series of tests that demonstrated the pharaoh&#x27;s fitness for continuing as ruler of Egypt. Based on indications left by Queen Tiye&#x27;s steward Khenruef, the festival may have lasted two to eight months.

Amenhotep wanted his Sed Festivals to be far more spectacular than those of the past. He appointed Amenhotep, son of Hapu to plan the ceremony, potentially because he was one of the few courtiers still alive to have served at the last Sed Festival, held for Amenhotep II. In preparation for the first Sed Festival, Amenhotep, son of Hapu enlisted scribes to gather information from records and inscriptions, most found in ancient funerary temples, describing the appropriate rituals and costumes.

Temples were built and statues erected up and down the Nile. Craftsmen and jewelers created ornaments commentating the event including jewelry, ornaments, and stelae. The scribe Nebmerutef coordinated every step of the event. He directed Amenhotep to use his mace to knock on the temple doors. Beside him, Amenhotep-Hapu mirrored his effort like a royal shadow. The king was followed by Queen Tiye and the royal daughters. When moving to another venue, the banner of the jackal god Wepwawet, &quot;Opener of Ways&quot; preceded the King. The king changed his costume at each major activity of the celebration.

One of the major highlights of the festival was the king&#x27;s dual coronation. He was enthroned separately for Upper and Lower Egypt. For Upper Egypt, Amenhotep wore the white crown but changed to the red crown for the Lower Egypt coronation.

After the Sed festival, Amenhotep transcended from being a near-god to one divine. The king may have later traveled across Egypt following the festival, potentially reenacting the ceremony for different audiences. Few Egyptian kings lived long enough for their own celebration. Those who survived used the celebration as the affirmation of transition to divinity.

=== International relations ===
Diplomatic correspondence from Amenhotep&#x27;s reign are partially preserved in the Amarna Letters, a collection of documents found near the city of Amarna. The letters come from the rulers of Assyria, Mitanni, Babylon, Hatti, and other states, typically including requests by those rulers for gold and other gifts from Amenhotep. The letters cover the period from Year 30 of Amenhotep until at least the end of Akhenaten&#x27;s reign. In Amarna Letter EA 4, Amenhotep is quoted by the Babylonian king Kadashman-Enlil I in firmly rejecting the latter&#x27;s entreaty to marry one of this pharaoh&#x27;s daughters:

Amenhotep&#x27;s refusal to allow one of his daughters to be married to the Babylonian monarch may indeed have followed from Egyptian royal custom, which allowed a claim upon the throne through descent from a royal princess. It could also be viewed as a diplomatic stratagem to enhance Egypt&#x27;s prestige, as Amenhotep himself married the daughters of several foreign rulers while refusing them his own daughters.

The Amarna Letters also reference the exchange between Amenhotep and the Mitanni King Tushratta of the statue of a healing goddess, Ishtar of Nineveh, late in Amenhotep&#x27;s reign. Scholars have generally assumed that the statue&#x27;s sojourn to Egypt was requested by Amenhotep in order to cure him of his various ailments, which included painful abscesses in his teeth. However, William L. Moran&#x27;s analysis of Amarna Letter EA 23, relating to the dispatch of the statue to Thebes, discounts this theory.

The arrival of the statue is known to have coincided with Amenhotep&#x27;s marriage with Tadukhepa, Tushratta&#x27;s daughter, in the pharaoh&#x27;s 36th year; letter EA 23&#x27;s arrival in Egypt is dated to &quot;regnal year 36, the fourth month of winter, day 1&quot; of his reign. Furthermore, Tushratta never mentions in EA 23 that the statue&#x27;s dispatch was meant to heal Amenhotep of his maladies. Instead, Tushratta writes in part:

The likeliest explanation is that the statue was sent to Egypt &quot;to shed her blessings on the wedding of Amenhotep and Tadukhepa, as she had been sent previously for Amenhotep and Gilukhepa.&quot; Moran agrees that this explanation was more likely. Further, Moran argues that the contents of Amarna Letter EA 21 support this claim, wherein Tushratta asks the gods, including Ishtar, for their blessing of the marriage.

In the 14th century BCE, the pharaoh sent an expedition to Cyprus to establish Egyptian control over the island, which was subsequently maintained for several centuries. During this time, the Egyptians established a number of settlements on the island, and they exported copper and other raw materials from Cyprus to Egypt in exchange for luxury goods and other commodities.
 However, the Egyptian presence on Cyprus was at times interrupted by incursions of other powers, including the Hittites and the Mycenaeans.

== Succession ==
Thutmose, the eldest son of Amenhotep III with his wife Tiye, became Crown Prince, but died before his father. Amenhotep was ultimately succeeded by his second son, who ascended the throne as Amenhotep IV and later took the name Akhenaten.
=== Proposed coregency with Amenhotep IV / Akhenaten ===

It has long been theorized that Amenhotep III shared a coregency with his son Amenhotep IV. Lawrence Berman has claimed that proponents of the coregency theory tended to be art historians, while historians remained unconvinced.

Eric Cline, Nicholas Reeves, Peter Dorman, and other scholars argue strongly against the establishment of a long coregency between the two rulers and in favor of either no coregency or one of at most two years. Donald B. Redford, William J. Murnane, Alan Gardiner, and Lawrence Berman contest the view of any coregency whatsoever between Akhenaten and his father.

Evidence against a coregency includes Amarna Letter EA 27, which is dated to Regnal Year 2 of Amenhotep IV. The subject of the letter involves a complaint from the Mitannian king Tushratta, claiming that Amenhotep IV did not honor his father&#x27;s promise to send Tushratta gold statues as part of the marriage arrangement between Tadukhepa, and Amenhotep III. This correspondence implies that if any coregency occurred between Amenhotep and Akhenaten, it lasted no more than a year.

However in February 2014, Egyptian Ministry of Antiquities announced that findings from the tomb of Vizier Amenhotep-Huy gave &quot;conclusive evidence&quot; of a coregency that lasted at least eight years. In the tomb, the cartouches of the two pharaohs were carved side by side. However, this conclusion has since been called into question by other egyptologists, according to whom the inscription means only that construction on Amenhotep-Huy&#x27;s tomb started during Amenhotep III&#x27;s reign and ended under Akhenaten&#x27;s, and Amenhotep-Huy thus simply wanted to pay his respects to both rulers, carving their names separately rather than simultaneously.

==Later life==
===Health and death===
Amenhotep&#x27;s greatest attested regnal date is Year 38, which appears on wine jar-label dockets from Malkata. He may have lived briefly into an unrecorded Year 39 and died before the wine harvest of that year. Reliefs from the wall of the temple of Soleb in Nubia and scenes from the Theban tomb of Kheruef, Steward of the King&#x27;s Great Wife, Tiye, depict Amenhotep as a visibly weak and sick figure. Scientists believe that in his final years he suffered from arthritis and obesity. Further, a forensic examination of his mummy revealed worn and cavity-pitted teeth which must have inflicted constant pain. An examination of the mummy by the Australian anatomist Grafton Elliot Smith concluded that the pharaoh had died at between the age of 40 and 50.

He was survived by at least one child, his successor Amenhotep IV. His wife Tiye is known to have outlived him by at least twelve years, as she is mentioned in several Amarna letters dated from her son&#x27;s reign, as well as depicted at the royal dinner table in Akhenaten&#x27;s years 9 and 12, in scenes from the tomb of Huya.

Foreign leaders communicated their grief at the pharaoh&#x27;s death, with Tushratta saying:

Amenhotep was buried in tomb WV22 in the Western Valley of the Valley of the Kings outside of Thebes. The tomb is the largest in the West Valley of the Kings and includes two side chambers for his Great Royal Wives, Tiye and Sitamun. However, it does not seem that either woman was buried there. During the reign of Smendes in the Third Intermediate Period, Amenhotep&#x27;s mummy was later moved to the mummy cache in KV35 along with several other pharaohs of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Dynasties, where it lay until discovered by Victor Loret in 1898.

For the 18th dynasty, the mummy shows an unusually heavy use of subcutaneous stuffing to make the mummy look more lifelike. The mummy has museum inventory number CG 61074.
In April 2021, his mummy was moved from the Museum of Egyptian Antiquities to the National Museum of Egyptian Civilization, along with those of 17 other kings and 4 queens in an event termed the Pharaohs&#x27; Golden Parade.

==Monuments and legacy==
Amenhotep has the distinction of having the most surviving statues of any Egyptian pharaoh, with over 250 identified. These statues provide a series of portraits covering the entire length of his reign.

When Amenhotep died, he left behind a country at the very height of its power and influence, commanding immense respect in the international world. However, it was a country wedded to age-old political and religious certainties under the Amun priesthood.

The resulting upheavals from his son Akhenaten&#x27;s reforming zeal shook these old certainties to their foundations, and forced the momentous question whether a pharaoh was more powerful than his society as represented in the worship of Amun. Akhenaten even moved the capital away from Thebes, the center of Amun&#x27;s worship, and built Amarna, a city dedicated to his new deity, the Aten.

Amenhotep built extensively at the temple of Karnak, including the Luxor temple with two pylons, a colonnade behind the new temple entrance, and a new temple to the goddess Ma&#x27;at. Amenhotep dismantled the Fourth Pylon of the Temple of Amun at Karnak to construct a new Third Pylon — and created a new entrance to this structure where he erected two rows of columns with open papyrus capitals down the centre of this newly formed forecourt. The forecourt between the Third and Fourth Pylons, sometimes called an obelisk court, was also decorated with scenes of the sacred funerary barques of the deities Amun, Mut, and Khonsu. The king also started work on the Tenth Pylon at the Temple of Amun. Amenhotep&#x27;s first recorded act as king — in his Years 1 and 2 — was to open new limestone quarries at Tura, just south of Cairo and at Dayr al-Barsha in Middle Egypt to undertake his great building projects. He virtually covered Nubia with new monuments:

His enormous mortuary temple on the west bank of the Nile was, in its day, the largest religious complex in Thebes, but the king built too close to the floodplain, and less than two hundred years later it was reduced to ruins. Much of the masonry was purloined by Merneptah and later pharaohs for their own construction projects. All that remained standing was the gateway with the Colossi of Memnon — two massive stone statues depicting Amenhotep, high. Amenhotep also built the Third Pylon at Karnak and erected 600 statues of the goddess Sekhmet in the Temple of Mut to the south. Some of the most magnificent statues of New Kingdom Egypt date to his reign &quot;such as the two outstanding couchant rose granite lions originally set before the temple at Soleb in Nubia&quot; as well as a large series of royal sculptures. Several black granite seated statues of Amenhotep wearing the &quot;nemes&quot; headress have come from excavations behind the Colossi of Memnon as well as from Tanis in the Delta. In 2014, two giant statues of Amenhotep toppled by an earthquake in 1200 BC were reconstructed from more than 200 fragments and re-erected at the northern gate of the king&#x27;s funerary temple.

One of the most stunning finds of royal statues dating to his reign was made as recently as 1989 in the courtyard of Amenhotep &#x27;s colonnade of the Temple of Luxor. The cache of statues included a nearly undamaged -high pink quartzite statue of the king wearing the Double Crown. It was mounted on a sled, and may have been a cult statue. Only the name of the god Amun had been hacked out wherever it appeared in the pharaoh&#x27;s cartouche, clearly part of Akhenaten&#x27;s campaign against the god of his father.

One of Amenhotep&#x27;s most popular epithets was &quot;Aten-tjehen&quot; which means &quot;the Dazzling Sun Disk&quot;; it appears in his titulary at Luxor temple and was frequently used as the name for one of his palaces, and for the Year 11 royal barge, as well as for a company of Amenhotep&#x27;s army.

In 2021, excavations revealed a settlement near Amenhotep&#x27;s mortuary temple, called the &quot;Dazzling Aten&quot;, believed to have been built by king to house craftsmen and labourers working on royal projects at Thebes, along with its own bakery and cemetery.

A Sed Festival Stela of Amenhotep III was taken from Egypt to Europe by an art dealer. Once owned by Eric Cassirer, it is now believed to be in a private collection in the United States. The white alabaster stela is 10 × 9 cm (3.94 × 3.54 in), but only its upper half survived. &quot;Front view:&quot; The god Heh, representing the number one million, holds notched palm leaves signifying years and the cartouche of Amenhotep, symbolically raising the pharoah for a million years. &quot;Side view:&quot; A series of festival (ḥb) emblems together with a Sed (sd) emblem identifying the stela as one made for Amenhotep &#x27;s Sed Festival royal jubilee. &quot;Top and back view:&quot; These show malicious damage where the cartouche was chipped away. Cassirer suggests this was another example of Akhenaten&#x27;s vandalism against Amun. Other gods displayed on the stela, Re and Ma’at, showed no damage. The altered stela may then have been displayed by Akhenaten.

Another striking characteristic of Amenhotep&#x27;s reign is the series of over 200 large commemorative stone scarabs that have been discovered over a large geographic area ranging from Syria (Ras Shamra) through to Soleb in Nubia. Similarly, five other scarabs state that his wife Gilukhepa of Mitanni arrived in Egypt with a retinue of 317 women. She was the first of many such princesses who would enter the pharaoh&#x27;s family.
==Ancestry and genetics==
Genetic analysis has confirmed that Amenhotep III is the father of both the KV55 mummy, identified in the study as Akhenaten, and &quot;The Younger Lady&quot;, sibling parents of his grandson, Tutankhamun. A more recent study, published in 2020, traced the family lineage via Y-chromosomes and mtDNA. Although only a partial profile was obtained, he shares his YDNA haplogroup, R1b, with his son and grandson, upholding the family tree outlined in the earlier study. However, the specific clade of R1b was not determined. The mitochondrial haplogroup of Amenhotep III was found to be H2b, which is associated with migrations from the Pontic-Caspian steppe to South Asia and the spread of Indo-Iranian languages.

In 2022, S.O.Y. Keita analysed 8 Short Tandem loci (STR) published data from studies by Hawass et al. 2010;2012 which sought to determine familial relations and research pathological features such as potential infectious diseases among the New Kingdom royal mummies, including Tutankhamun, Amenhotep III, and Rameses III. Keita used the Popaffiliator algorithm which differentiates Eurasians, Sub-Saharan Africans, and East Asians; he concluded that &quot;a majority [have] an affinity with &#x27;Sub-Saharan&#x27; Africans in one affinity analysis&quot;. However, he emphasized the complexity of ethnic attributions, cautioning that the royal mummies may have had other affiliations obscured by the typological categories, and that different &quot;data and algorithms might give different results&quot;.

According to historian William Stiebling and archaeologist Susan N. Helft, conflicting DNA analyses by different research teams have thusfar failed to establish consensus on the genetic makeup of the ancient Egyptians and their geographic origins.

<text>Conaire Mór (the great), son of Eterscél, was, according to medieval Irish legend and historical tradition, a High King of Ireland. His mother was Mess Búachalla, who was either the daughter of Eochu Feidlech and Étaín, or of Eochu Airem and his daughter by Étaín. In the Old Irish saga &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; he is conceived when his mother is visited by Nemglan who flies in her skylight in the form of a bird, and is brought up as Eterscél&#x27;s son.

According to the &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot;, he took power after killing his predecessor, and his father&#x27;s killer, Nuadu Necht. In &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot; he succeeds Eterscél directly. When Eterscél dies, a bull-feast is held. A bull is killed, a man eats his fill of its meat and drinks its broth, and sleeps as incantations are chanted over him. Whoever this man sees in his sleep will be the new king. He sees a naked man coming along the road to Tara with a stone in his sling. The young Conaire, meanwhile, is hunting birds in his chariot. He chases them into the sea, where they become armed men, announce themselves as Conaire&#x27;s father&#x27;s bird troop, and inform him that it is forbidden for him to hunt birds. The leader of the bird troop is called Nemglan and he tells Conaire to go naked to Tara, where he will be made king, and places several &quot;geasa&quot; (taboos) on his reign. Among other things, he may not be preceded by three red men into the house of a red man. As he approaches Tara he is met by three kings carrying clothes for him, and when he arrives he is made king.

His reign is long and mostly peaceful. His end is told in the Old Irish epic &quot;Togail Bruidne Dá Derga&quot;, &quot;The Destruction of Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel&quot;, in which events conspire to make him break his &quot;geasa&quot; one by one. After he has already broken several of them, he travels south along the coast of Ireland, he is advised to stay the night at Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel, but as he approaches it, he sees three men dressed in red riding red horses arriving before him. &quot;Da Derga&quot; means &quot;Red God&quot;. He realises that three red men have preceded him into the house of a red man, and another of his &quot;geasa&quot; has been broken. His three foster-brothers, the three sons of Dond Désa, whom Conaire had exiled to Alba (Britain) for their crimes, had made alliance with the king of the Britons, Ingcél Cáech, and they were marauding across Ireland with a large band of followers. They attack Da Derga&#x27;s Hostel. Three times they attempt to burn it down, and three times the fire is put out. Conaire, protected by his champion Mac Cécht and the Ulster hero Conall Cernach, kills six hundred before he reaches his weapons, a further six hundred with his weapons. He asks for a drink, but all the water has been used to put out the fires. Mac Cécht travels across Ireland with Conaire&#x27;s cup, but none of the rivers will give him water. He returns with a cup of water just in time to see two men cutting Conaire&#x27;s head off. He kills both of them. Conaire&#x27;s severed head drinks the water and recites a poem praising Mac Cécht. The battle rages for three more days. Mac Cécht is killed, but Conall Cernach escapes.

He had ruled for thirty or seventy years, depending on the source consulted. The &quot;Lebor Gabála Érenn&quot; synchronises his reign with that of the Roman emperor Augustus (27 BC – AD 14), and after the birth of Christ, and makes him contemporary with legendary provincial kings Conchobar mac Nessa, Cairbre Nia Fer and Ailill mac Máta. The chronology of Geoffrey Keating&#x27;s &quot;Foras Feasa ar Éirinn&quot; dates his reign to 63–33 BC, that of the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot; to 110–40 BC.

A descendant of Íar mac Dedad, Conaire belonged to the legendary Clanna Dedad, the legendary royal family of the Érainn. His descendants in Ireland and Scotland were known as the Síl Conairi. The last Gaelic king of Scotland from the line from Conaire Mór was Alexander III of Scotland.

<text>Ailill mac Máta is the king of the Connachta and the husband of queen Medb in the Ulster Cycle of Irish mythology. He rules from Cruachan (Rathcroghan in County Roscommon).

==Family background, marriage and offspring==
The sagas explain &quot;mac Máta&quot; as a matronymic: his mother is Máta Muirisc, daughter of Mága, of the Fir Ol nEchmacht, a tribal grouping of Connacht, through whom he claimed the throne of the Connachta. His father is Rus Ruad, king of the Laigin, whose other sons include Cairbre Nia Fer, king of Tara, Find Fili, who succeeded him as king of the Laigin, and in some texts Cathbad, chief druid of Conchobar mac Nessa of the Ulaid. The &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; says Medb chose him as husband, ahead of Find, Cairbre and Conchobar, because he alone among them was without meanness, jealousy or fear.

A late saga, &quot;Cath Boinde&quot;, tells a different story. It says Ailill was the grandson of Medb&#x27;s sister Ele, and came to Cruachan as a young child to be raised by Medb, who was already reigning there with her then-husband Eochaid Dála. He grew up to be a fine warrior, and became chief of Medb&#x27;s bodyguard, and her lover. Eochaid tried to expel Ailill from Connacht, but Medb would not allow it. He then challenged him to single combat, and lost. Ailill then became Medb&#x27;s husband and king of the Connachta.

Ailill and Medb had seven sons, all called Maine. They originally had other names, but after Medb asked a druid which of her sons would kill Conchobar, and received the reply &quot;Maine&quot;, they were all renamed as follows:

* Fedlimid became Maine Athramail (&quot;like his father&quot;)
* Cairbre became Maine Máthramail (&quot;like his mother&quot;)
* Eochaid became Maine Andoe (&quot;the swift&quot;)
* Fergus became Maine Taí (&quot;the silent&quot;)
* Cet became Maine Mórgor (&quot;of great duty&quot;)
* Sin became Maine Mílscothach (&quot;honey-speech&quot;)
* Dáire became Maine Móepirt (&quot;beyond description&quot;)

The prophecy was fulfilled when Maine Andoe went on to kill Conchobar, son of Arthur, son of Bruide — not Conchobar mac Nessa of the Ulaid, as Medb had assumed the druid meant. Medb and Ailill also had a daughter, Findabair.

==Cattle raid==
Ailill led the &quot;Táin Bó Cúailnge&quot; (cattle raid of Cooley) against the Ulaid, an expedition intended to steal their prize bull Donn Cúailnge. The prologue to the later version of the Táin says this was a result of a dispute between Ailill and Medb over who was wealthier. Their wealth was equal, except for one thing: the bull Finnbhennach, who was born into Medb&#x27;s herd, but thought it was beneath his dignity to be owned by a woman and transferred himself into Ailill&#x27;s ownership. The only bull his equal in Ireland was Donn Cúailnge, so it was decided to acquire him for Medb to restore their equality.

Fergus mac Róich, a former king of the Ulaid in exile and Medb&#x27;s lover, was chosen to lead the way for the army. On the way the army split in two. Ailill led one party, and Medb and Fergus, leading the other, took the opportunity to sleep together. But Ailill had sent his charioteer, Cuillius, to spy on them, and Cuillius stole Fergus&#x27;s sword while he was &quot;in flagrante&quot;. Ailill decided to forgive Medb on the grounds that she was probably trying to ensure Fergus&#x27; loyalty, and kept Fergus&#x27;s sword safe but hidden.

Because of a divine curse on the Ulaid, the invasion was opposed only by the teenage Ulaid hero Cú Chulainn, who held up the army&#x27;s advance by demanding single combat at fords. Medb and Ailill offered their daughter Findabair in marriage to a series of heroes as payment for fighting Cú Chulainn, but all were defeated. Nevertheless, they secured the bull. After Conchobar finally assembled the Ulaid&#x27;s army, Ailill gave Fergus back his sword and the final battle began. The Connachta were forced to retreat, but Donn Cúailnge was brought back to Cruachan, where he fought Finnbhennach, killed him, and died of his wounds.

==Death==

Ailill managed to keep his promise to Medb to be without jealousy, despite her many lovers, until he saw her bathing in a lake with Fergus. His blind brother Lugaid Dalléces was nearby, so Ailill told him a hart and a doe were playing in the lake, and challenged him to kill them with a spear. Lugaid threw the spear and killed Fergus.

Late in life, the Ulaid hero Conall Cernach came to stay with Ailill and Medb, as theirs was the only household in Ireland that could satisfy his enormous appetite. Medb found Ailill was seeing another woman and demanded Conall kill him, something he was happy to do in revenge for Fergus. Ailill was killed on 1 May Lá Bealtaine which was on a Tuesday. Conall then fled, but the men of the Connachta pursued and killed him at the ford of Ballyconnell, County Cavan.

<doc id="253785" wikidata="Q5530765" url="?curid=253785" title="Gemstone Publishing">
<text>Gemstone Publishing is an American company that publishes comic book price guides. The company was formed by Diamond Comic Distributors President and Chief Executive Officer Steve Geppi in 1994 when he bought Overstreet.

Gemstone published licensed Disney comic books from June 2003 until November 2008. The company has also reprinted EC Comics of the 1950s.

BOOM! Kids acquired all comic publishing licenses regarding Disney characters in the second half of 2009.

==Disney comics==
Gemstone&#x27;s flagship publications were comic books featuring Disney characters; particularly the Donald Duck/Uncle Scrooge comics of such Duck artists as Carl Barks and Don Rosa, and the Mickey Mouse comics of Floyd Gottfredson, César Ferioli, and Romano Scarpa, among others.

While popularly known as a reprint house, Gemstone&#x27;s comics were actually dominated by stories that were new to United States audiences. Vintage material, though popular with readers, was not the majority of the content.

Gemstone issued annual editions of Christmas Parade, Vacation Parade, and Spring Fever; a giveaway for Free Comic Book Day; and occasional special editions (including comic adaptations of &quot;Mickey, Donald, Goofy: The Three Musketeers&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Twice Upon a Christmas&quot;).

Gemstone&#x27;s first large-size book collection, &quot;Mickey And The Gang: Classic Stories In Verse&quot;, was issued in November 2005. It was a compilation, edited by David Gerstein, of Disney cartoon story pages published from 1934 to 1944 in Good Housekeeping magazine. Gerstein later edited two Gemstone softcover books that were official tie-ins to the Walt Disney Treasures DVD collections: &quot;Disney Comics: 75 Years of Innovation&quot; (2006) and &quot;Uncle Scrooge: A Little Something Special&quot; (2008).

==Russ Cochran and EC Comics reprints==
Gemstone has also published reprints of EC Comics. Gemstone&#x27;s &quot;Comic Book Marketplace&quot;-editor Russ Cochran had previously published (in 1973) a dozen reprints of EC titles including &quot;Crypt of Terror&quot;, &quot;Weird Science&quot;, &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot;, etc., before moving to Gladstone Publishing and then to Gemstone, which has been the home of Cochran&#x27;s EC reprints for over 15 years.

Reprinting the Cochran/Gladstone-reprints of &quot;The Haunt of Fear&quot;, &quot;The Vault of Horror&quot; and &quot;Weird Science&quot; (all 1992), Gemstone also republished (in single issue and &#x27;annual&#x27; – four issues per &#x27;annual&#x27; – format): 
*&quot;Crime SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;Shock SuspenStories&quot;, &quot;Two-Fisted Tales&quot;, &quot;Weird Fantasy&quot; and &quot;Weird Science-Fantasy&quot; in 1992;
*&quot;Incredible Science Fiction&quot; (1994)
*&quot;Frontline Combat&quot; (1995)
*&quot;Panic&quot; (1997)
*&quot;Piracy&quot; and &quot;Valor&quot; (1998)
*&quot;Aces High&quot;, &quot;Impact&quot;, &quot;M.D.&quot; and &quot;Psychoanalysis&quot; (1999), and
*&quot;Crime Patrol&quot; and &quot;Extra!&quot; in 2000.

Oversize, hardback, slip-cased collections of these comics had been previously published in black &amp; white by Cochran during the 1980s as &quot;The Complete EC Library&quot;. This Library was then added to by Cochran/Gemstone with 2005&#x27;s &quot;Picto-Fiction&quot; collection, comprising the EC comics: &quot;Confessions Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Crime Illustrated&quot;, &quot;Shock Illustrated&quot; and &quot;Terror Illustrated&quot;, along with &quot;18 previously unseen stories, never published before&quot;.

==Full-color hardbacks==

In 2006, Cochran and Gemstone began publication of a series of full-color EC Archives editions. Promising that &quot;[e]ach EC Archive volume will reprint six complete issues (24 stories)&quot;, the first volumes of &quot;Weird Science&quot; and &quot;Shock Suspenstories&quot; both saw print in December, 2006, with forewords from (respectively) EC fans George Lucas and Steven Spielberg. Ostensibly beginning to publish two volumes every two months, the schedule changed to one-per-month and recently one every couple of months.

In addition, &quot;Deluxe&quot; versions of &quot;Weird Science&quot; Vol.s 1 &amp; 2 (both signed by artist Al Feldstein), &quot;Shock Suspenstories&quot; Vol. 1 and &quot;Tales From the Crypt&quot; Vol. 1 have been published.

==Closing==
In early 2009, the future of Gemstone Publishing was unclear, after reports of unpaid printing bills, particularly from the EC Archives. In April, Geppi responded to the uncertainty, noting that while there had been &quot;a reduction in staff at Gemstone,&quot; such moves did &quot;not [signal] the end of Gemstone Publishing.&quot; Seven months after Geppi&#x27;s optimistic statements, the last batch of Gemstone&#x27;s Disney comics appeared in November 2008, complete with previews for next month&#x27;s issues that Gemstone was to fail publishing. BOOM! Kids acquired all comic publishing licenses regarding Disney characters, and started publishing comic titles previously owned by Gemstone in the second half of 2009. Starting in 2013, Dark Horse comics began to reprint E.C. comics picking up where Gemstone left off, in the same full color hardback format.

<doc id="253786" wikidata="Q7242629" url="?curid=253786" title="Price point">
<text>In economics, a price point is a point along the demand curve at which demand for a given product is supposed to stay relatively high. The term &quot;price point&quot; is often used incorrectly to refer to a price.

==Characteristics==
Introductory microeconomics depicts a demand curve as downward-sloping to the right and either linear or gently convex to the origin. The downward slope generally holds, but the model of the curve is only piecewise true, as price surveys indicate that demand for a product is not a linear function of its price and not even a smooth function. Demand curves resemble a series of waves rather than a straight line. 

The diagram shows price points at the points labeled A, B, and C. When a vendor increases a price beyond a price point (say to a price slightly above &quot;price point B&quot;), sales volume decreases by an amount more than proportional to the price increase. This decrease in quantity demanded more than offsets the additional revenue from the increased unit price. As a result, total revenue (price multiplied by quantity demanded) decreases when a firm raises its price beyond a price point. Technically, the price elasticity of demand is low (inelastic) at a price lower than the price point (steep section of the demand curve), and high (elastic) at a price higher than a price point (gently sloping part of the demand curve). Firms commonly set prices at existing price-points as a marketing strategy.

==Causes==
There are three main reasons for price points to appear:

# Substitution price points
#* price points occur at the price of a close substitute
#* when an item&#x27;s price rises above the cost of a close substitute, the quantity demanded drops sharply
# Customary price points
#* the market grows accustomed to paying a certain amount for a type of product
#* increasing the price beyond this amount will cause sales to drop dramatically
# Perceptual price points (also referred to as &quot;psychological pricing&quot; or as &quot;odd-number pricing&quot;)
#* raising a price above 99 cents will cause demand to fall disproportionately because people perceive $1.00 as a significantly higher price

==Oligopoly pricing==
In relation to customary price points, oligopolies can also generate price points. Such price points do not necessarily result from collusion, but as an emergent property of oligopolies: when all firms sell at the same price, any firm which attempts to raise its selling price will experience a decrease in sales and revenues (preventing firms from raising prices unilaterally); on the other hand, any firm in an oligopoly which lowers its prices will most likely be matched by competitors, resulting in small increases in sales but decreases in revenues (for all the firms in that market). This effect can potentially produce a kinked demand-curve where the kink lies at the point of the current price-level in the market.
These results depend on the elasticity of the demand curve and on the properties of each market.

<doc id="253790" wikidata="Q701542" url="?curid=253790" title="Operation Felix">
<text>Operation Felix () was the codename for a proposed German campaign to cross into Spain and to seize Gibraltar early in the Second World War. The planned operation presupposed the co-operation of the Spanish dictator, Francisco Franco; it did not occur chiefly because of Franco&#x27;s reluctance to enter the war - partially due to the influence of British intelligence.

==Background==
Reminiscing about the Spanish Civil War, Republican minister Federica Montseny wrote to historian Burnett Bolloten in 1950 that the government had planned to offer the Canary or the Balearic Islands to Germany in exchange of its neutrality.
However, the Largo Caballero government could not provide written proof of its proposal and the Germans did continue to support the Nationalists.

After the Fall of France in June 1940, Hermann Göring advised Adolf Hitler to occupy Spain and North Africa, rather than to invade the British Isles. As early as June 1940, before the armistice with France had been signed, General Heinz Guderian also argued for seizing Britain&#x27;s strategically-important naval base of Gibraltar. Guderian even urged Hitler to postpone the armistice so that he could rush on through Spain with two Panzer divisions, take Gibraltar and invade French North Africa. General Alfred Jodl, Chief of Staff of &quot;Oberkommando der Wehrmacht&quot; (OKW) operations, presented Hitler with a formal plan to cut Britain from the east of its empire by invading Spain, Gibraltar, North Africa and the Suez Canal, instead of invading Britain.

On 12 July 1940, the OKW set up a special group for the necessary planning. On 22 July, Admiral Wilhelm Canaris, the head of the &quot;Abwehr&quot; and an acknowledged expert on Spain, travelled with several other German officers to Madrid, Spain, where they held talks with the Spanish dictator, General Francisco Franco, and Spanish War Minister General Juan Vigón. They then travelled on to Algeciras, where they stayed some days to reconnoitre the approaches to Gibraltar, and they returned to Germany with the conclusion that Franco&#x27;s regime was reluctant to enter the war. Canaris&#x27;s group determined that Gibraltar might be seized by an air-supported ground assault by at least two infantry regiments, three engineer battalions and 12 artillery regiments. Canaris declared that without heavy assault cannon, which he knew were unavailable, Gibraltar could not be taken. When he reported to Field Marshal Wilhelm Keitel, Canaris gave his opinion that even if Germany were able, with the co-operation of Spain, to seize Gibraltar, the British would land in Morocco and French West Africa.

In August, Canaris met with Franco&#x27;s brother-in-law, Ramón Serrano Súñer, who was about to become the Spanish Foreign Minister. Canaris urged Serrano Súñer to do what he could to convince Franco to stay out of the war. Soon afterward, Franco dispatched Serrano Súñer to Berlin to get an idea of Hitler&#x27;s attitude since Canaris had assured him that Germany would not forcibly intervene in Spain. When Serrano Súñer met Hitler on 16 September, Hitler did not press very hard for Spanish involvement in the war, perhaps because he planned to meet Franco himself very soon.

On 24 August, Hitler approved a general plan to seize Gibraltar. On 23 October, he met Franco at Hendaye, France, and proposed for Spain to enter the war on the Axis side as early as January 1941. Gibraltar would be taken by special &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; units and turned over to Spain, but Franco refused the offer and emphasized Spain&#x27;s need for large-scale military and economic assistance. Hitler took offence when Franco expressed doubts about the possibility of a German victory in fighting the British on its home territory. Franco also pointed out that even if the British Isles were invaded and conquered, the British government, as well as most of the British Army and the powerful Royal Navy, would probably retreat to Canada and continue the Battle of the Atlantic with the support of the United States.

A meaningless memorandum of understanding was signed at Hendaye by Franco and Hitler, with neither side getting what it wanted. A few days later, Hitler was reported to have told Benito Mussolini, &quot;I would rather have four of my own teeth pulled out than go through another meeting with that man again!&quot;

==Planning==
Despite those problems, German military leaders proceeded to prepare for a large-scale operation against Gibraltar, codenamed Operation Felix. The plan called for two German army corps to enter Spain across the Pyrenees. One corps, under General Ludwig Kübler, was to cross Spain and assault Gibraltar, and the other, commanded by General Rudolf Schmidt, was to secure its flanks. Air support would need one fighter and two dive-bomber wings. The overall command of &quot;Felix&quot; was to be assigned to Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau. The plan also made provisions for the occupation of Spanish possessions in North Africa: Spanish Morocco, Río de Oro, and the Canary Islands, whose ports could then be used as bases for German U-boats.

===Proposed German order of battle===
Expeditionary Corps (forming the covering force); General Rudolf Schmidt
*16th Motorized Infantry Division (to concentrate at Valladolid)
*16th Panzer Division (Cáceres)
*SS Division &quot;Totenkopf&quot; (Seville)

49 &quot;Gebirgsarmeekorps&quot; or Army Mountain Corps (forming the assault force); General Ludwig Kübler
*&quot;Grossdeutschland&quot; Infantry Regiment
*98th Regiment of the 1st Mountain Division
*26 medium and heavy artillery battalions
*3 observation battalions
*3 engineer battalions, which would use up to 150 &quot;Goliath&quot; remotely-controlled mine clearing vehicles
*2 Nebelwerfer battalions
*&quot;Regiment Brandenburg&quot; (detachment of 150)
===Diplomatic issues===
On 12 November, Hitler issued Führer Directive No. 18, which stated that &quot;political measures to induce the prompt entry of Spain into the war have been initiated... The aim of German intervention in the Iberian Peninsula (code name &quot;Felix&quot;) will be to drive the English out of the Western Mediterranean&quot;. It also mentioned the potential invasion of Portugal if the British gained a foothold and requested for the occupation of Madeira and the Azores to be investigated.

On 5 December 1940, Hitler met with the German High Command and decided to request permission from Franco for German troops to cross the Spanish border on 10 January 1941. It was planned that General Jodl would go to Spain to make preparations for the attack on Gibraltar as soon as Canaris had obtained Franco&#x27;s agreement. Accordingly, Canaris met with Franco on 7 December and put to the need for Spain&#x27;s immediate entry into the war. Franco responded that Spain was simply not capable of supporting the German Army because of shortages of food and the crippled infrastructure and nature of the country still recovering from its recent civil war, which had just officially ended on 1 April 1939. He also expressed his fear that a German seizure of Gibraltar would lead to the loss of the Canary Islands and of Spanish Africa by a British counterinvasion.

On receiving Canaris&#x27;s report, Hitler decided that Operation Felix should be cancelled. His disappointment was reflected in a later letter to Mussolini in which he said, &quot;I fear that Franco is committing here the greatest mistake of his life&quot;.

In the opening weeks of 1941, unsuccessful efforts were made by the ambassadors in Berlin and Rome to encourage the Spanish government to change its stance. Franco answered negatively to another request from Hitler to join the war that was received on 6 February citing the precarious state of Spain&#x27;s economy and army. German Foreign Minister Joachim von Ribbentrop told Hitler that in his opinion, &quot;Franco has no intention of ever joining the war&quot;. In February 1941, the OKW advised the naval high command that Operation Felix was out of the question for the time being since the troops that were earmarked for it would soon be needed elsewhere.

==British countermeasures==
The British were well aware of Gibraltar&#x27;s strategic value and its vulnerability to attack from the Spanish mainland. On the outbreaks of war with Italy, most of the civilian population were evacuated to the United Kingdom and other parts of the Empire, except for those in vital jobs in the dockyard or who were members of the Gibraltar Defence Force. The garrison was more than doubled, and the anti-aircraft defences were greatly improved. Work started on a programme of improvements to Gibraltar&#x27;s fortifications, including a new network of tunnels deep inside the Rock and a system of strongpoints and minefields covering the land border.

===British garrison: spring 1941===
*2nd Battalion, The King&#x27;s Regiment
*2nd Battalion, Somerset Light Infantry
*4th Battalion, The Black Watch (from July 1940)
*4th Battalion, Devonshire Regiment (from July 1940)
*3rd Heavy Regiment, Royal Artillery, with 8 x 9.2 inch, 7 x 6 inch and 6 x twin 6 pounder coast artillery guns
*10th Anti Aircraft Regiment, Royal Artillery, with 4 x 3 inch, 4 x 3.7 inch, and 2 x 2 pounder anti-aircraft guns
*82nd Heavy AA Regiment, Royal Artillery, (from July 1940), with 16 x 3.7 inch guns, 8 x 40mm 40mm Bofors AA guns and radar
*3rd Searchlight Battery, Royal Artillery.
*&quot;Special Detachment&quot; of No. 1 Tunnelling Company, Royal Canadian Engineers (from November 1940)
*No. 2 Tunnelling Company, Royal Canadian Engineers (from March 1941)
*Royal Engineers, Royal Signals and supporting arms.

A further countermeasure was the creation of a group of specialist army and navy officers known as the 128th Liaison Delegation Party, which would be activated in the event of the German Army moving into Spain. It had two alternative roles. The initial role would be to provide support to General Franco should he decide to resist the Germans and to provide liaison for any British force sent to support the Spanish forces. The second role, in the event of Franco colluding with the Germans, was to demolish Spanish ports and infrastructure and to organise resistance and sabotage with the participation of the Special Operations Executive. That role became pre-eminent later in the war when the group was renamed the Joint Intelligence Centre.

==&quot;Felix-Heinrich&quot;==
On Hitler&#x27;s insistence, the OKW developed a revised plan for the capture of Gibraltar, which might have been implemented once the German invasion of the Soviet Union had been completed. Codenamed &quot;Felix-Heinrich&quot;, the plan was submitted to General Franz Halder on 10 March 1941. It proposed that as soon as the invading forces in the Soviet Union reached a line between Kyiv and Smolensk, hopefully by 15 July, units could then be withdrawn to prepare for the Gibraltar operation, which it was thought could begin on 15 October. &quot;Felix-Heinrich&quot; would broadly follow the original plan, with the same forces, but with new supporting units.

<text>Stephen Gilbert (15 January 1910 – 12 January 2007) was a painter and sculptor from Scotland. He was one of the few British artists fully to embrace the avant-garde movement in Paris in the 1950s.

==Early years==
Gilbert was born in Wormit, in the north-east of Fife, Scotland, of English parents. His father was a commander in the Royal Navy; his grandfather was the sculptor Sir Alfred Gilbert.

==Education==
He studied architecture at the Slade School of Art in London from 1929 to 1932, where he befriended fellow student Roger Hilton. Gilbert won the Slade Scholarship at the end of his first year, and the principal Sir Henry Tonks encouraged him to start painting from 1930. He also met sculptor Jocelyn Chewett at the Slade, and they were married in 1935.

==Career==
He exhibited at the Royal Academy in 1936, and put on an early solo show in London, at the Wertheim Gallery in 1938. He moved to Paris in 1937, where his wife studied under Ossip Zadkine, leaving before the Second World War. He failed a medical for military service, and he spent the war in Ireland near Dublin with his wife and son, Humphrey. He joined The White Stag group of refugee artists. His work was inspired by Masson, and by reading Jung, Nietzsche and Jakob Böhme, with fantastic creatures and plants painted in vivid colours.

He returned to Paris in 1946, after the birth of his daughter Frances. He exhibited at the Salon des Surindépendents in Paris in 1948, attracting the attention of Danish artist Asger Jorn, and leading to his membership of the CoBrA avant-garde art group. He was one of only two British members, the other being William Gear. He was included in the first issue of the group&#x27;s journal and participated in both major exhibitions: the Bregnerød congress in August 1949, where he worked on the collective mural, and the Amsterdam exhibition at the Stedelijk Museum in November of that year, where he worked with Constant Nieuwenhuys. A French art critic described him as &quot;le plus français des sculpteurs anglais et l&#x27;un des plus européens parmi les artistes&quot; (&quot;the most French of British sculptors and one of the most European of artists&quot;).

He also visited Max Walter Svanberg in Sweden. After his contact with CoBrA, his approach to painting became more abstract, but he remained in contact with Pierre Alechinsky after CoBrA dissolved. He exhibited several times at the Salon des Réalités Nouvelles.

During the 1950s, he concentrated on three-dimensional and architectural forms, formed from sheets of aluminium. He joined André Bloc&#x27;s Groupe Espace in 1954, exhibiting at the Salon de la Jeune Sculpture. He was also a founder of the Néovision group, and worked with experimental architect Peter Stead. He moved on to more curvilinear forms, exhibited at the Drian Galleries in London in 1961, and completed two public commissions in London. He received a Gulbenkian award in 1962, and the sculpture prize at the Tokyo Biennale in 1965.

His wife died in 1979, and his sculpture moved on from open forms to more enclosed structures. He returned to painting in the 1980s. Examples of his work are held by public collections, including KUNSTEN Museum of Modern Art Aalborg, Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam, Calouste Gulbenkian Museum and Tate Museum. 

He died in Frome, Somerset and he was survived by his son and daughter.

<doc id="253803" wikidata="Q152793" url="?curid=253803" title="Karel Appel">
<text>Christiaan Karel Appel (; 25 April 1921 – 3 May 2006) was a Dutch painter, sculptor, and poet. He started painting at the age of fourteen and studied at the Rijksakademie in Amsterdam in the 1940s. He was one of the founders of the avant-garde movement CoBrA in 1948. He was also an avid sculptor and has had works featured in MoMA and other museums worldwide.

==Childhood==
Christiaan Karel Appel was born on 25 April 1921 in his parents&#x27; house at Dapperstraat 7 in Amsterdam, the Netherlands. 
As a child he was often called &#x27;Kik&#x27;. On the ground floor his father, Jan Appel, had a barbershop. His mother, born Johanna Chevallier, was a descendant of French Huguenots. Karel Appel had three brothers.

At fourteen, Appel produced his first real painting on canvas, a still life of a fruit basket. For his fifteenth birthday, his wealthy uncle Karel Chevalier gave him a paint set and an easel. An avid amateur painter himself, Chevalier gave his namesake some lessons in painting.

==Career==
From 1940 to 1943, during the German occupation, Appel studied at the Rijksakademie van Beeldende Kunsten in Amsterdam, and it was there he met the young painter Corneille and, some years later, Constant; they became close friends for years. His parents opposed his choice to become an artist, leading him to leave home; this was also necessary because he needed to hide from the German police so that he would not be picked up and sent to Germany to work in the weapons industry.
Appel had his first show in Groningen in 1946. In 1949 he participated with the other CoBrA artists in the Stedelijk Museum Amsterdam; this generated a huge scandal and many objections in the press and public. He was influenced by Pablo Picasso, Henri Matisse, and the French brute-art artist Jean Dubuffet. In 1947 he started sculpting with all kinds of used materials (in the technique of assemblage) and painted them in bright colors: white, red, yellow, blue, and black.
He joined the together with the young Dutch painters Anton Rooskens, Theo Wolvecamp, and Jan Nieuwenhuys. Later the Belgian writer Hugo Claus joined the group.
In 1948 Appel joined CoBrA (coined by the Belgian poet Christian Dotremont from the initials of the members&#x27; home countries&#x27; capital cities: Copenhagen, Brussels, Amsterdam) together with the Dutch artists Corneille, Constant, and Jan Nieuwenhuys. The new art of the CoBrA group was not popular in the Netherlands, but it found a warm and broad welcome in Denmark. By 1939, Danish artists had already started to make spontaneous art and one of their sources of inspiration was Danish and Nordic mythology. It was also in Denmark that the CoBrA artists started cooperating by collectively painting the insides of houses, which encouraged and intensified the exchange of the typical &#x27;childish&#x27; and spontaneous picture language used by the CoBrA group. Appel used this very intensively; his 1949 fresco &#x27;Questioning Children&#x27; in Amsterdam City Hall caused controversy and was covered up for ten years.

As a result of this controversy and other negative Dutch reactions to CoBrA, Appel moved to Paris in 1950 and developed his international reputation by travelling to Mexico, the United States, Yugoslavia, and Brazil. He also lived in New York City and Florence. His first American gallery exhibition took place in 1954 at the Martha Jackson Gallery. In America he also painted portraits of prominent jazz musicians, including Miles Davis and Dizzy Gillespie. The following year his painting &quot;Child and Beast II&quot; (1951) was included in the influential exhibition, &quot;The New Decade&quot; at the Museum of Modern Art which featured the work of twenty-two European painters and sculptors including newcomers like Francis Bacon, Jean Dubuffet, and Pierre Soulages. He is particularly noted for his mural work. After 1990 he became much more popular in the Netherlands; he had several big shows in Amsterdam and Bruxelles, organized by director Rudy Fuchs. Also, the CoBrA-museum in Amstelveen organized several shows featuring his work. He became the most famous Dutch CoBrA artist.
Appel&#x27;s work has been exhibited in a number of galleries, including the Anita Shapolsky Gallery in New York City, Galerie Lelong in Paris, Galerie Ulysses in Vienna, and Gallery LL in Amsterdam. He also had multiple exhibitions of his works in the Cobra Museum in Amstelveen, Netherlands. His estate is represented by Galerie Max Hetzler and Almine Rech.

==Death==

Appel died on 3 May 2006 in his home in Zürich, Switzerland. He suffered from a heart ailment. He was buried on 16 May 2006 at the Père Lachaise Cemetery in Paris, France.

Years before his death, Appel established the Karel Appel Foundation, whose purpose is &quot;to preserve [Appel&#x27;s] artworks, to promote public awareness and knowledge of Karel Appel&#x27;s oeuvre, and to supervise publication of the Oeuvre Catalogue of the paintings, the works on paper, and the sculptures.&quot;

In 2002 a number of Appel&#x27;s works went missing on the way to his foundation, an event that was not to be resolved before his death. However, in 2012 the works were found in a disused UK warehouse and returned to the foundation.

In the wake of his death, the Foundation (based in Amsterdam) functions as his official estate in addition to its primary service as an image archive. The U.S. copyright representative for the Karel Appel Foundation is the Artists Rights Society.

<text>The Liberty Motor Car Company was a vintage era United States automobile maker based in Detroit, Michigan from 1916 to 1923.

== History ==
Liberty Motor Car Company was started in February 1916 with capital stock of $400,000 to produce medium-priced cars. Percy Owen, vice-president of Saxon was president and R. E. Cole was Engineer. The R.C.H. automobile factory was purchased for production. The Liberty car was introduced at the Hotel Pontchartrain in Detroit in the summer of 1916.

A total of 733 cars were produced in its first year increasing to 11,217 cars in 1921. A new factory was built in 1921 but the expansion along with the Depression of 1920-1921 caused financial issues. Reorganization while under Receivership failed and in September 1923, it was acquired by Columbia Motors. Columbia failed the following year and the plant was sold to Budd Wheel Company.

== Models ==
Only one model named Liberty Six was offered, propelled by a monobloc 3394 cc Continental Motors 6-cylinder engine. In 1921 Liberty began using a new six-cylinder engine of their own design. Open and closed body styles were used. Total production of Liberty Six&#x27;s was nearly 37,000. Factory prices ranged from $1,095 in 1919 to $2,095 in 1923, .

<text>Columbia Motors was a Detroit, Michigan, United States based automobile manufacturer that produced automobiles from 1916 to 1924.

Columbia Motors was incorporated in 1916, with John George Bayerline as company president and William E. Metzger as vice-president. Bayerline was the former president and general manager of the King Motor Car Company and former general manager and founder of the Warren Motor Car Company. Prior to founding Columbia, Metzger was a founder of the E-M-F Company which was later purchased by the Studebaker Corporation.

Columbia Motors produced two models powered by Continental six-cylinder engines including the popular Columbia Six. In 1916, Columbia bought Argo Electric. A 1916 news item in the journal &quot;Horseless Age&quot; presents a &quot;Columbia Touring Car&quot;. In 1923, Columbia acquired Liberty Motor Car.

<doc id="253808" wikidata="Q7796515" url="?curid=253808" title="Thornton Affair">
<text>The Thornton Affair, also known as the Thornton Skirmish, Thornton&#x27;s Defeat, or Rancho Carricitos, was a battle in 1846 between the military forces of the United States and Mexico west upriver from Zachary Taylor&#x27;s camp along the Rio Grande. The much larger Mexican force defeated the Americans in the opening of hostilities, and was the primary justification for U.S. President James K. Polk&#x27;s call to Congress to declare war.

== Background ==
Although the United States had annexed Texas, both the US and Mexico claimed the area between the Nueces River and the Rio Grande. Polk had ordered Taylor&#x27;s &quot;Army of Occupation&quot; to the Rio Grande early in 1846 after Mexican President Mariano Paredes declared in his inaugural address that he would uphold the integrity of Mexican territory to the Sabine River.

Mariano Arista assumed command of the Division of the North on April 4 and arrived at Matamoros on April 24, making the total force there about 5,000 men; he sent word to Taylor of his presence. Arista promptly ordered his subordinate, General Anastasio Torrejón, to cross the Rio Grande fourteen miles upstream at La Palangana.

== Battle ==
Taylor received two reports on April 24 of Mexicans crossing the Rio Grande, the first crossing below his camp, the other at a crossing upriver. Taylor sent two detachments to investigate; Captain Croghan Ker to investigate downriver and Captain Seth B. Thornton, accompanied by two dragoon companies, to investigate upriver. Ker found nothing but Thornton rode into an ambush and his 80-man force was quickly overwhelmed by Torrejon&#x27;s 1,600, resulting in the capture of those not immediately killed. Thornton&#x27;s guide brought news of the hostilities to Taylor and was followed by a cart from Torrejón containing six wounded Americans; the general stated that he had freed them as an act of mercy.

==Aftermath==
In the fierce encounter, fourteen of Thornton&#x27;s men were killed outright, six were wounded, and one was fatally wounded, while the rest were taken prisoner (including Captain Thornton and his second in command, Captain William J. Hardee). Mexican casualties are unknown. Torrejón continued on to the Matamoros-Point Isabel road, surprising Samuel H. Walker&#x27;s Texas Rangers on April 28, before continuing on to Longoreno to cover the crossing of the main Mexican army.

Following the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, Arista and Taylor agreed to a prisoner exchange which resulted in the release of Thornton, Hardee and their men. Thornton was later killed on August 20, 1847 in an engagement at Churubusco outside Mexico City. Coincidentally, this soldier who was wounded at the war&#x27;s opening act was killed in its final conflict. 

==Declaration of war==
Upon learning of the incident, President James K. Polk asked for a Declaration of war before a joint session of the United States Congress, and summed up his justification for war by famously stating:

:&quot;The cup of forbearance had been exhausted even before the recent information from the frontier of the Del Norte [Rio Grande]. But now, after reiterated menaces, Mexico has passed the boundary of the United States, has invaded our territory and shed American blood upon the American soil. She has proclaimed that hostilities have commenced, and that the two nations are now at war.&quot;.

On May 13, 1846, the U.S. Congress declared war on Mexico, despite the Mexican government&#x27;s position that Thornton had crossed the border into Mexican Texas, which Mexico maintained began south of the Nueces River (the historical border of the province of Texas). Opposition also existed in the United States, with one senator declaring that the affair had been &quot;as much an act of aggression on our part as is a man&#x27;s pointing a pistol at another&#x27;s breast&quot;. 
Congressman Abraham Lincoln demanded to know the &quot;particular spot of soil on which the blood of our citizens was so shed&quot; (the spot resolutions). The ensuing Mexican–American War was waged from 1846 to 1848 which cost the lives of many thousands and the loss of all northern provinces from Mexico. The Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo ended the war on February 2, 1848, and established the Rio Grande as the border between the U.S. and Mexico, and led to Mexico recognizing Texas as a part of the United States.

<doc id="253809" wikidata="Q6567280" url="?curid=253809" title="List of Church of England dioceses">
<text>There are 42 dioceses of the Church of England. These cover England, the Isle of Man, the Channel Islands and a small part of Wales. The Diocese in Europe is also a part of the Church of England, and covers the whole of continental Europe, Morocco and the post-Soviet states. The structure of dioceses within the Church of England was initially inherited from the Catholic Church as part of the Protestant Reformation. During the Reformation a number of new dioceses were founded, but no more were then created until the middle of the 19th century, when dioceses were founded mainly in response to the growing population, especially in the northern industrial cities. The most recent diocese to be established was the Diocese of Leeds, which came into being on 20 April 2014. Prior to that, no new dioceses had been created since 1927. Leeds was created by combining three previous dioceses: the Diocese of Bradford, the Diocese of Ripon and Leeds, and the Diocese of Wakefield.

The 42 current dioceses are divided into two provinces. The Province of Canterbury in the south comprises 30 dioceses and the Province of York in the north comprises 12. The archbishops of Canterbury and York have pastoral oversight over the bishops within their province, along with certain other rights and responsibilities. All of the dioceses have one cathedral each except the Diocese of Leeds, which has three that are considered co-equal. Of all the dioceses, Derby has the smallest cathedral; Derby Cathedral takes up only . One diocese dates back to the 6th century, eight date back to the 7th century, two to the 10th century, five to the 11th century, two to the 12th century, five to the 16th century, seven to the 19th century, and ten to the 20th century. The territories administered by the various dioceses generally accord with the counties as they existed before the Local Government Act 1972.

<text>The siege of Fort Texas marked the beginning of active campaigning by the armies of the United States and Mexico during the Mexican–American War. The battle is sometimes called the siege of Fort Brown.

Fort Texas was located on the northern side of the Rio Grande opposite the Mexican town of Matamoros. At the time, the Rio Grande border with the United States was disputed by Mexico. On 3 May 1846, the fort was fired upon and besieged by Mexican forces under General Mariano Arista. The main American force under General Zachary Taylor advanced from Port Isabel and successfully engaged Arista at Palo Alto on 8 May. The following day, the Mexicans were routed at Resaca de la Palma, from Fort Texas. The siege was lifted, with the Mexican force withdrawing south of the Rio Grande. Taylor occupied Matamoros and continued operations in northeastern Mexico.

==Background==
On 28 March 1846, the Army of Occupation under General Zachary Taylor reached the north bank of the Rio Grande. Taylor ordered Captain Joseph K. Mansfield to construct an earthen star fort for 800 men named &quot;Fort Texas&quot;. The fort was garrisoned by 500 men under Major Jacob Brown, including the 7th Infantry, Capt. Allen Lowd&#x27;s four 18-pounders, and Lt. Braxton Bragg&#x27;s field battery.

Mexican General Francisco Mejia&#x27;s 2,000 men also erected similar fortifications, including for his twenty cannons, for 800 men upstream at the Las Anacuitas ferry crossing, called Fort Paredes; and two redoubts about 800 yards from Taylor&#x27;s camp, placing it in a crossfire. The largest cannon was a 12-pounder.

Following the Thornton Affair, Mexican forces under General Mariano Arista crossed the Rio Grande and then besieged Fort Texas, after realizing that on 1 May Taylor had taken most of his forces to Fort Polk on Point Isabel to protect his supply depot.

==Siege==
At dawn on 3 May 1846, Mexican forces bombarded Fort Texas, but were silenced by the American response, although the Mexican artillery down the river was more successful. Lowd attempted to set fire to Matamoros with &quot;hot shot&quot;. Mexican fire stopped at 7:30 pm, the American&#x27;s at 11 pm. On 4 May, Mexican guns and a mortar were placed on the northern bank of the Rio Grande and on 5 May General Pedro de Ampudia arrived with 1,230 men and four guns. Since Ampudia&#x27;s artillery was too light to breach the earthworks and the infantry disinclined to make an assault, the siege continued until 9 May with General Antonio Canales Rosillo&#x27;s irregular cavalry astride the Point Isabel road preventing supplies from reaching the fort.

Captain Edgar S. Hawkins took command of Fort Texas when Major Brown was mortally wounded on 6 May at ten o&#x27;clock. When Arista demanded the fort&#x27;s surrender at 4:30 that afternoon, Hawkins responded with &quot;My interpreter is not skilled in your language but if I understand you correctly...I must respectfully decline to surrender.&quot;

As soon as it became clear Taylor was leaving Fort Polk, Arista moved his army from his camp at Tanques del Ramiereno to block Taylor&#x27;s path leading to the battles of Palo Alto and Resaca de la Palma.

==Aftermath==
Though the confrontation at Fort Texas lasted six days, with periods of heavy cannon fire, casualties were remarkably low. Only two U.S. soldiers died in the bombardment. Major Brown was struck in the leg by a cannonball on May 6 and survived for several days only to die on May 9, just hours before the siege ended. Despite his wound, Major Brown had helped maintain troop morale throughout the siege, thus contributing to the success of the defense of the Fort. Mexican leaders reported two killed and two wounded from American artillery fire during the siege. The effect of artillery fire on the civilian population of Matamoros is unknown. Laundress and cook Sarah Borginnes, who refused to take shelter during the siege but instead provided food and coffee to the American troops, was named &quot;Heroine of Fort Brown&quot; by the American newspapers.

<text>The Uniting Church in Australia (UCA) was founded on 22 June 1977, when most of the Methodist Church of Australasia, about two-thirds of the Presbyterian Church of Australia and almost all the churches of the Congregational Union of Australia united under the Basis of Union. According to the church, it had 243,000 members in 2018. In the , 870,183 Australians identified with the church, but that figure fell to 673,260 in the . In the , that figure was 1,065,796. The UCA is Australia&#x27;s third-largest Christian denomination, behind the Catholic and the Anglican Churches. There are around 2,000 UCA congregations, and 2001 National Church Life Survey (NCLS) research indicated that average weekly attendance was about 10 per cent of census figures. The UCA is one of Australia&#x27;s largest non-government providers of community and health services. Its service network consists of over 400 agencies, institutions, and parish missions, with its areas of service including aged care, hospitals, children, youth and family, disability, employment, emergency relief, drug and alcohol abuse, youth homelessness and suicide. Affiliated agencies include UCA&#x27;s community and health-service provider network, affiliated schools, the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress, Frontier Services and UnitingWorld.

==Organisation==

The UCA is a national, unincorporated association of councils, each of which has responsibility for functions in the church. The councils are (local), presbyteries (regional), synods (state) and an
assembly (national). The membership of each council is established by the constitution. Each council includes Women and Men, lay and ordained. The offices of president of assembly, moderator of synod (who chair these councils) and other offices are open to all UCA members. The UCA is a non-episcopal church, with no bishops. Leadership and pastoral roles are nominally performed by presbyteries, but in reality by individuals.

===Assembly===
The UCA assembly meets every three years, and is chaired by the president. The 14th Assembly met in Perth from 12 to 18 July 2015. The 15th Assembly, hosted by the Synod of Victoria and Tasmania in Box Hill, met in July 2018. Assembly business between meetings is conducted by the Assembly Standing Committee, which meets three times per year (usually in March, July and November). Membership is drawn from throughout Australia, with 18 members elected at each assembly.

===President===

The current president is Reverend Charissa Suli since she was installed as president in the meeting of the 17th Assembly on 11 July 2024. She replaced Reverend Sharon Hollis, who had succeeded Dr Deidre Palmer at the start of the 16th Assembly in July 2021. Palmer was the second woman in the role, following Jill Tabart (1994-1997). Palmer was the moderator of the Presbytery and Synod of South Australia from November 2013 to November 2016. Hollis was moderator of the Synod of Victoria and Tasmania at the time of her election in 2018 as the president-elect and became president at the beginning of the sixteenth assembly, which was to be held in Queensland in 2021. As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the meeting was moved to a shorter, online form.

===Synods===
Synods are UCA councils which roughly correspond to state boundaries. Each synod meets about once per year, with a standing committee to represent it between sessions. Synod responsibilities include the promotion and encouragement of the church&#x27;s mission, theological and ministerial education, and overseeing property matters. There are six synods:
* Synod of New South Wales and the ACT (formerly the NSW Synod)
* Synod of Queensland
* Synod of South Australia
* Synod of Western Australia
* Synod of Victoria and Tasmania
* The Northern Synod, which includes the Northern Territory, north-west Western Australia and northern South Australia.

===Presbyteries===
Each synod generally consists of a number of presbyteries. Western Australia has a unitary presbytery-synod model. South Australia also had a single presbytery and synod for 15 years, until 2019. These large presbyteries enable groups of congregations to work together, based on geographic location or similar interests or characteristics. Selection of ministerial candidates and the placement of ministers are decided at the presbytery level.

===Congregations===
There are about 2,000 UCA congregations, with 243,000 members and adherents. Congregations range in size from a dozen to hundreds of members. They are the local church, the setting for regular worship (generally on Sundays). Many churches also conduct worship services at other times, such as a monthly weekday service, a late-night service for day-shift workers, a &quot;cafe church&quot;, or Friday- or Saturday-evening services.

A Meeting of the Congregation must be held at least twice each year. The meetings typically consider and approve the budget, local policy matters, property matters (ratified by the presbytery and synod) and the &quot;call&quot; (employment) of a new minister or other staff.

Congregations manage themselves through a council. All elders are members, as are ministers with pastoral responsibility for the congregation; there may also be other members. The council meets regularly, and is responsible for approving worship times and other matters.
Some united congregations exist. The UCA has joined with other churches, such as the Baptist Union and the Churches of Christ, in some locations. There are also cooperative arrangements where supplying ministry to congregations is impossible, particularly in remote areas. This includes arrangements with the Anglican Church, where ministry and (sometimes) property resources are shared.

Faith communities are less structured than congregations. They are groups of people who gather together for worship, witness or service and choose to be recognised by the presbytery. Local churches are sometimes also used by congregations of other denominations; for example, a Tongan Seventh-day Adventist congregation may make arrangements to meet in the building on a Saturday. The UCA is committed to inclusivity, and there are a number of multicultural ministry (MCM) arrangements in which Korean, Tongan and other groups form congregations of the church.

====Co-operating congregations====
Co-operating congregations, typically in rural areas, have several denominations worshiping as one congregation and rotate the denomination appointing its next minister. They are known as union churches in some places, with several denominations using the building at different times.

====Frontier Services====
A Frontier Services ministry is available to residents of the outback, with ministers and pastors visiting families by air or four-wheel drive vehicles. Visits are normally arranged in advance so adjacent families can travel for significant events, such as baptisms. These &quot;padres&quot; are based in a major town or city, and the local synod is normally their organisational and funding body.

==Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress==
The Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress (UAICC, sometimes known simply as the Congress), is constitutionally recognised as having responsibility for oversight of church ministry to the Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people:

A Synod may at the request of a Regional Committee of the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress prescribe that the Regional Committee may have and exercise all or specific rights, powers, duties and responsibilities of a Presbytery under this Constitution and the Regulations (including ordination and other rights, powers and responsibilities relating to Ministers) for the purpose of fulfilling any responsibility of the Regional Committee for Uniting Church work with Aboriginal and Islander people
within the bounds of the Synod.

==Agencies==

UnitingCare Australia, one of the country&#x27;s largest providers of social care, is its largest operator of aged-care facilities. Other activities include shelters and emergency housing for men, women and children; family-relationships support; disability services, and food kitchens.

===Education===
The UCA provides theological training through a number of theological colleges:
*New South Wales: United Theological College, Parramatta a member of the School of Theology at Charles Sturt University.
*Queensland: Trinity College (with Australian Catholic University)
*South Australia: Uniting College for Leadership and Theology, University of Divinity 
*Victoria and Tasmania: Pilgrim Theological College, part of the University of Divinity
*Western Australia: Perth Theological Hall

Training generally takes five years, and includes supervised practical experience.

===Youth===
The National Christian Youth Convention is a national UCA activity during school and university holidays, every two or three years in a different city. NCYC 2007, &quot;Agents of Change&quot;, was held in Perth. The 2009 &quot;Converge&quot; was held in Melbourne. NCYC 2011 was held from 29 December 2010 to 4 January 2011 at the Southport School on Queensland&#x27;s Gold Coast. Yuróra NCYC 2014 was held in North Parramatta, Sydney from 7 to 10 January 2014. Yuróra NCYC 2017, &quot;Uniting Culture&quot;, was also held in Sydney in January 2017.

===International aid===
UnitingWorld is the church&#x27;s international-aid agency. It receives funding from the government of Australia to implement development and poverty-alleviation programs in the Pacific, Asia and Africa. UnitingWorld works in partnership with 18 overseas denominations to support over 180,000 people annually through sustainable community development projects.

==Ministry==
The role of the laity is valued in the UCA, which recognises that ministry is a function of the entire church. However, &quot;specified ministries&quot; are defined. Of these, the roles of elder and pastor are open to lay members. The church has two orders of ordained ministry: minister and deacon.

When it is not possible (or desirable) to have an ordained minister, a lay preacher or lay ministry team may act in their place (similar to a Methodist local preacher). Lay preachers are required to participate in training and examinations conducted by each synod, and must be approved by the presbytery.

==Culture==

The UCA was one of the first Australian churches to grant self-determination to its indigenous members through the Uniting Aboriginal and Islander Christian Congress. Partnerships exist with South Pacific and Asian churches, especially those which share a Congregational, Presbyterian or Methodist heritage. An increasing number of ethnic churches worship in their own languages as well as in English. Five to seven per cent of the membership worship in languages other than English, including Aboriginal languages.

The UCA advocates for social justice. It has taken stances on issues such as native title for indigenous people; the environment; apartheid; refugee status, and safe injection facilities for drug users. The church is similar to other united and uniting churches, which maintain a cultural identity in their own country and practise ecumenical fellowship with other Christian denominations worldwide. Between 1991 and 2013, UCA attendance declined by 41 per cent. In 2013, about 97,200 people attended weekly worship services throughout Australia.

===Liturgy===
The church is liturgically varied. Practices range from experimental liturgies, informal worship reminiscent of the Jesus movement to conventional Reformed services. Music also varies from traditional and contemporary hymns in the &quot;Australian Hymn Book&quot; and &quot;Together in Song&quot;, through Hillsong and contemporary Christian music to hard alternative and metal.

Liturgical dress in the UCA is generally lenient, and is optional for ministers and other leaders of worship. When liturgical dress is worn, it most commonly consists of a white alb and a stole (for ministers and deacons) or scarf (for lay preachers). The colour of the scarf or stole is often related to the liturgical calendar, such as purple for Lent or red for Pentecost.

===Decision-making===

Since 1997, most councils and agencies have used the consensus decision-making procedures outlined in the church&#x27;s &quot;Manual for Meetings&quot;. The procedures may use orange (&quot;support&quot;) and blue (&quot;do not support&quot;) cards, which may also be displayed times other than voting.

==Theology==
The UCA&#x27;s theological range is broad, reflecting its Methodist, Presbyterian and Congregational origins and its commitment to ecumenism. Its theology may be described as mainline Protestantism, with a commitment to social justice. The church&#x27;s perspectives are evangelical, left (or progressive), and liberal. Morality, faith, and (in particular) sexuality have been debated. Concerns focus on biblical understanding and accommodation to the broad culture.

Uniting Network Australia is &quot;the national network for lesbian, gay, bisexual, intersex and transgender people, their families, friends and supporters within the Uniting Church in Australia.&quot; The establishment of Evangelical Members within the Uniting Church in Australia (EMU), the Reforming Alliance and their merger with the Assembly of Confessing Congregations (ACC) illustrate conservative opposition to the ordination of gay and lesbian candidates and the influence of the Confessing Movement (not to be confused with the anti-Nazi Confessing Church).

===Homosexuality===

Issues debated since early in UCA history are the role of gay and lesbian people in the church, their possibility of being ordained and the blessing of same-sex unions. The church permits local presbyteries to ordain gay and lesbian ministers, and extends the local option to marriage; a minister may bless a same-sex marriage.

The fairly broad consensus has been that a person&#x27;s sexual orientation should not be a bar to attendance, membership or participation in the church. More controversial has been the issue of sexual activity by gay and lesbian people and the sexual behaviour of ordination candidates. In 2003, the church voted to allow local presbyteries to decide whether to ordain gay and lesbian people as ministers. Ministers were permitted to bless same-sex couples entering civil unions even before same-sex marriage was legalised in Australia in late 2017. In July 2018, the national assembly approved the creation of marriage rites for same-sex couples.

Since 1997, some ministers living in same-sex relationships have come out without their ordination (or ministry) being challenged. In 2011, the church approved the blessing of same-sex unions. Seven years later it allowed local congregations and ministers to decide whether to perform same-sex marriages, and ministers may now do so.

In March 2021, the UCA became the first mainstream Australian church to induct a transgender minister, when Jo Inkpin was installed at Pitt Street Uniting Church in Sydney.

<text>The Battle of Monterey, at Monterey, California, occurred on 7 July 1846, during the Mexican–American War. The United States captured the town unopposed.

==Prelude==
In February 1845, at the Battle of Providencia, the Californio forces had ousted the Mexican-appointed non-Californio governor, Manuel Micheltorena, and most of his forces from Alta California. The central government in Mexico City cancelled an attempt to reassert authority and grudgingly recognized the regime of the succeeding Californio governor, Pio Pico, who remained nominally in charge in Alta California.

The main forces available to the United States in California were the about 400–500 bluejacket sailors and U.S. Marines on board the five ships of the Navy&#x27;s Pacific Squadron. In November 1845, Commodore John D. Sloat, commander of the Pacific Squadron, then at Mazatlán, Mexico, was joined by the , which carried orders that if Sloat learned &quot;beyond a doubt&quot; that war between the U.S. and Mexico had begun, he was to seize San Francisco Bay and blockade the other California ports.

On 17 May 1846, Commodore Sloat received word of the first open hostilities on the Rio Grande. On 26 May, Sloat received word of the Battle of Palo Alto and the Battle of Resaca de la Palma, upon which he sent a coded message to Secretary of the Navy George Bancroft that he was leaving for California. After delaying his departure, Sloat received news on 7 June that an American squadron had blockaded Vera Cruz. Sloat sailed on the frigate &quot;Savannah&quot; on 8 June, arriving at Monterey on 1 July.

They joined the sloop &quot;Cyane&quot;, which had sailed on 19 June and was already there. There were U.S. fears that the British might try to annex California to satisfy British creditors. The British Pacific Station&#x27;s ships off California were stronger in number, guns and men.

On 5 July, Sloat received a message from Capt. John B. Montgomery of the &quot;Portsmouth&quot; in San Francisco Bay reporting the events of the Bear Flag Revolt in Sonoma and its open support by Brevet Capt. John C. Frémont. On 6 July, believing Frémont to be acting either on orders from Washington or information that war had been declared, Sloat therefore began to carry out his orders. In a message to Montgomery, Sloat relayed his decision to seize Monterey and ordered the commander to take possession of Yerba Buena (modern-day San Francisco), adding, &quot;I am very anxious to know if Captain Frémont will cooperate with us.&quot;

==Battle==

Early on 7 July 1846, the frigate USS &quot;Savannah&quot; and the two sloops, USS &quot;Cyane&quot; and USS &quot;Levant&quot; of the United States Navy, commanded by Commodore John D. Sloat, captured Monterey and raised the flag of the United States.

Capt. William Mervine of the &quot;Cyane&quot; came ashore with a small party from the &quot;Savannah&quot; at 7:30 a.m., seeking the surrender of the port from the Mexican commandant, Capt. Mariano Silva. Silva replied that he was &quot;not authorized to surrender the place.&quot; In fact, Silva was in command of a nonexistent garrison, as it would have had no gunpowder to use in its few cannons. Californio General José Castro had quartered his cavalry forces inland at San Juan Bautista.

At 10 a.m., 225 sailors and marines from Sloat&#x27;s three warships landed and formed before the Customs House. Purser Rodman M. Price read Sloat&#x27;s proclamation and posted it in both English and Spanish, declaring that a state of war existed between the U.S. and Mexico and that &quot;henceforth California would be a portion of the United States.&quot;

The only shots fired were a 21-gun salute to the new U.S. flag fired by each of the U.S. Navy ships in the harbor. The British ships observed but took no action. A messenger was sent to General Castro at San Juan Bautista requesting his surrender, which he refused.

==Aftermath==

Sloat still recognized Mexican real estate titles and church lands. He also established justices of the peace when the alcaldes resigned their offices.

Captain Montgomery of the &quot;Portsmouth&quot; received Sloat&#x27;s message to seize Yerba Buena on 8 July and sent Lt. Joseph W. Revere to Sonoma and Sutter&#x27;s Fort to notify Fremont of the capture of Monterey. Montgomery and 70 men landed shortly before 8:00 a.m. on 9 July to curious onlookers and read the pronouncement at the Customs House. He then replaced the Bear Flag, which had been raised on 2 July, with the American flag. The American flag was run up with a 21-gun salute. Montgomery then sent Purser James H. Watmough to notify Fremont of the occupation of Yerba Buena and Sloat&#x27;s request for a meeting.
Commodore Robert F. Stockton arrived at Monterey Bay aboard the &quot;Congress&quot; on 15 July and took over command from the 65-year-old Sloat. The British ship of the line &quot;Collingwood&quot; arrived in Monterey on 23 July, and &quot;Juno&quot; arrived at Yerba Buena on 11 July, but neither ship interfered in the American activities.

On 19 July, Frémont&#x27;s party entered Monterey. Frémont, having been requested, met with Sloat on board the &quot;Savannah&quot;. When Sloat learned that Frémont had acted on his own authority (thus raising doubt regarding a war declaration), he retired to his cabin. On 23 July, Frémont was appointed major in command of the California Battalion, which he had helped form with his 60-man exploratory force and volunteers from the Bear Flag Republic. The California Battalion, which varied from 160 to 428 men, drew regular army wages and were used to garrison and maintain order in the towns that had surrendered.

The Americans held northern California, but General Castro and Governor Pico planned resistance in the south. However, on 11 August, upon learning of the advance of the American army on Pueblo de Los Angeles, with about 1,500 residents, the California army of about 100 men, which lacked money and popular support, broke up. Its leaders, Castro and Pico, departed that day for the Mexican department of Sonora. The Mexican government in California had ceased to exist.

In 1907, Toccoa Falls College was founded by Richard A. Forrest in the community of Golden Valley, North Carolina, as the Golden Valley Institute. On January 1, 1911, Forrest put $10.00 down on the $25,000.00 purchase price for the Haddock Inn and of land in northeast Georgia. In October, he relocated the school to near Toccoa, Georgia, in order to be near a mainline railroad. He renamed the school Toccoa Falls Institute and added secondary school courses to the theological classes. A 1913 fire destroyed the Haddock Inn, which was the classroom and residence building. After operating in tents for a time, the school built a new campus. In 1928 the secondary courses were reorganized, and the state of Georgia accredited it as Toccoa Falls High School, which remained open until 1976. In 1937, the state chartered the four-year college program and allowed it to grant the degree Bachelor of Arts in Biblical Education.

===Dam break disaster===

On November 6, 1977, the Kelly Barnes Dam, which had been built up and used by the college for electrical power since the Toccoa Falls Institute days, collapsed. The lake it impounded drained through the lower part of the campus. The resulting flood killed 39 people and injured 60, as well as destroying much of the on-campus married student housing and damaging part of the men&#x27;s dormitory. The dam was never rebuilt. With the destruction of the dam and the subsequent draining of the lake, there exists no possibility of a similar flood.

===Recent history===

The current president, Robert Myers, became the seventh president of the college in 2012.

On January 12, 2009, Gate Cottage, one of the most historic buildings on campus, was destroyed by fire. The cottage had been built in 1939 and was the fourth oldest building on campus. No one was in the building at the time of the fire. Gate Cottage has been rebuilt with a bigger gift shop and dining area for various occasions, but without the School of Counseling, which was relocated to a new location between the Mission Building and Bandy Hall.

== Toccoa Falls ==

With a vertical drop of , Toccoa Falls, located on the college campus, stands as one of the tallest free-falling waterfalls in the eastern United States. The waterfall was purchased in 1907 as part of the campus of Toccoa Falls College and stands today as the distinguishing landmark of the college. Locals commonly refer to it as &quot;The Falls.&quot;

==Academics==
Toccoa Falls College consists of four schools (School of Christian Ministries, School of Arts and Sciences, School of Professional Studies, and the Fetterman School of Nursing) with a total of ten departments. Within these departments, 35 majors and 43 minors are offered. The Seby Jones Library is the primary academic library on campus.

==Campus life==

On-campus student housing consists of single-sex dormitories, a large men&#x27;s dormitory, two women&#x27;s dormitories, and some smaller, suite-style dormitories, as well as various cottages, including married student housing. On-campus housing is advised by the college in the handbook, and is required for all regular underclassmen. There is a mandatory curfew for all on-campus students.

The college also operated WRAF, a radio station with various teaching and preaching programming as well as Christian music and a weekly Radio Theater program. All of the college&#x27;s radio holdings, including WTXR and WRAF, were sold to Radio Training Network, Inc. effective July 25, 2016, for $2.1 million. WRAF is now a repeater station for WLFJ-FM at W220CK.

<text>Before the partition of India in 1947, about 584 princely states, also called &quot;native states&quot;, existed in India. These were not part of British India, the parts of the Indian subcontinent which were under direct British administration, but rather under indirect rule, subject to subsidiary alliances.

Things moved quickly after the partition of British India in 1947. By the end of 1949, all of the states had chosen to accede to one of the newly independent states of India or Pakistan or else had been conquered and annexed.

==Overview==

In principle, the princely states had internal autonomy, while by treaty the British Crown had suzerainty and was responsible for the states&#x27; external affairs. In practice, while the states were indeed ruled by potentates with a variety of titles, the British still had considerable influence.

By the time of the departure of the British in 1947, only four of the largest of the states still had their own British resident, a diplomatic title for advisors present in the states&#x27; capitals, while most of the others were grouped together into agencies, such as the Central India Agency, the Deccan States Agency, and the Rajputana Agency.

Starting in 1920, the states were represented in the Chamber of Princes, which held its meetings in New Delhi.

The most important states were ranked as salute states, whose rulers were entitled to a given number of salute guns.

By the Indian Independence Act 1947, the British gave up their suzerainty of the states and left each of them free to choose whether to join one of the newly independent countries of India and Pakistan or to remain outside them. For a short time, some of the rulers explored the possibility of a federation of the states separate from either, but this came to nothing. Most of the states then decided to accede to India or to Pakistan, such as Junagadh (1947–1948), Bilaspur on 12 October 1948, and Bhopal on 1 May 1949. Travancore also chose to remain an independent country.

Hyderabad State was the largest which chose to remain independent. In Operation Polo, in September 1948, it was invaded and annexed by India.

In Jammu and Kashmir, a state with a Muslim majority but a Hindu ruler, the Maharaja hoped to remain independent but acceded to India on 27 October 1947 at the outset of the invasion of Jammu and Kashmir by Pakistan — leading to the Indo-Pakistani War of 1947.

On 31 March 1948, Kalat acceded to Pakistan, although the brother of the Khan led a rebellion against this decision.

<doc id="253828" wikidata="Q202508" url="?curid=253828" title="The Mummy (1999 film)">
<text>The Mummy is a 1999 American action-adventure film written and directed by Stephen Sommers, starring Brendan Fraser, Rachel Weisz, John Hannah, and Arnold Vosloo in the title role as the reanimated mummy. It is a remake of the 1932 film of the same name and part of the larger Universal Monsters franchise. The film follows adventurer and treasure hunter Rick O&#x27;Connell as he travels to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, with librarian Evelyn Carnahan and her older brother Jonathan, where they accidentally awaken Imhotep, a cursed high priest with supernatural powers.

Development took years, with multiple screenplays and directors attached. In 1997, Sommers successfully pitched his version of a more adventurous and romantic take on the source material. Filming took place in Morocco and the United Kingdom; the crew endured dehydration, sandstorms, and snakes shooting on location in the Sahara Desert. Industrial Light &amp; Magic provided many of the visual effects, blending live-action footage and computer-generated imagery to create the titular monster. Jerry Goldsmith composed the orchestral score.

&quot;The Mummy&quot; was theatrically released on May 7, 1999 by Universal Pictures. The film received mixed critical reviews and positive audience reaction and grossed $418.1 million worldwide against a production budget of $80 million, becoming the sixth-highest grossing film of 1999. The film started a new franchise, with two direct sequels, &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008), and various spinoffs such as an animated series and the prequel &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; (2002), which led to sequels of its own. In 2017, an attempt was made to start another Universal Monsters franchise with &quot;The Mummy&quot; starring Tom Cruise.

==Plot==

In Thebes, Egypt, 1290 BC, high priest Imhotep has an affair with Pharaoh Seti I&#x27;s mistress Anck-su-namun. The pair kill the Pharaoh after he discovers the affair. When the Pharaoh&#x27;s bodyguards, the Medjai, arrive, Anck-su-namun commits suicide while Imhotep flees in the hope of resurrecting her. Imhotep and his priests steal her corpse and travel to Hamunaptra, the City of the Dead, to conduct the ritual but are halted by the Medjai. As punishment Imhotep&#x27;s priests are mummified alive, while Imhotep himself is cursed to being buried alive with flesh-eating scarabs. Resultingly the Medjai are sworn to prevent Imhotep&#x27;s return, as his resurrection would unleash an unstoppable evil. 

In 1926 AD Cairo, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister, Evelyn—a librarian and aspiring Egyptologist working for museum curator Dr. Terence Bey—with an intricate box and map that lead to Hamunaptra, the existence of which is now considered a myth along with the treasures believed to reside there. Jonathan reveals he stole the box from American adventurer and treasure hunter, Rick O&#x27;Connell, who discovered the city while in the French Foreign Legion. Evelyn bargains with corrupt prison warden Gad Hassan to free an incarcerated Rick, in exchange for the American leading them to Hamunaptra where she hopes to find the golden Book of Amun-Ra. 

The group soon finds themselves competing with another expedition, guided by Rick&#x27;s fellow former Legionnaire Beni Gabor, with both being attacked by an unknown group as they journey along the Nile as well as upon reaching Hamunaptra and exploring the ruins. The attackers are revealed to be the Medjai with their leader, Ardeth Bay, warning them to leave before they delve too deeply. Ignoring Bay&#x27;s warnings the two expeditions continue to dig through the ruins, resulting in numerous fatalities that include Hassan being killed by a scarab he inadvertently releases. Both expeditions come into conflict over a statue which is believed to hold the golden book. Within the statue, however, the competing expeditions come across the Book of the Dead as well as five canopic jars, while Evelyn, Rick, and Jonathan accidentally discover Imhotep&#x27;s mummified remains. That night, Evelyn steals the Book of the Dead from the rival camp, accidentally awakening the mummified Imhotep when she reads scripture contained within aloud. 

Following a confrontation with the now resurrected Imhotep as well as the Medjai, the expeditions flee back to Cairo. However, they soon find they are still being followed by Imhotep, now aided by Beni, who is unleashing the biblical Plagues of Egypt. Within the city, those who discovered the canopic jars are hunted down by Imhotep, restoring his human form while strengthening his supernatural powers. Hoping to find answers at the museum, the survivors instead find Ardeth being hosted by fellow Medjai Dr. Bey. The group come to the conclusion that Imhotep&#x27;s aim is still to resurrect Anck-su-namun, using Evelyn as a human sacrifice to enable this, and that the only way to stop him is to return to Hamunaptra before Imhotep and find the Book of Amun-Ra. The group are soon cornered by Imhotep and a now enslaved city populace, which results in Evelyn&#x27;s capture while Dr. Bey sacrifices himself to allow the others to escape. 

The remaining three attempt to reach Hamunaptra first via a plane piloted by RAF Captain Winston Havelock, but crash due to a sandstorm conjured by Imhotep which results in Havelock&#x27;s death and enables Imhotep to arrive first and begin the ritual. After making it to the city on foot the trio discover the Book of Amun-Ra, though Ardeth is seemingly overwhelmed while fighting Imhotep&#x27;s resurrected servants. Jonathan and Rick reach the ritual chamber where Rick frees Evelyn while Jonathan manages to use the book to take control of the resurrected servants who instead kill a partially resurrected Anck-su-namun. Now free, Evelyn uses the book to render Imhotep mortal, allowing Rick to fatally wound him; Imhotep steps into a pool of souls that consume him. Moments later, the city begins to collapse as a looting Beni had triggered a booby trap, with the latter being devoured by scarabs after he is left trapped in a treasure chamber. The trio escape Hamunaptra and find a surviving Ardeth outside, who bids them farewell as they depart with what loot Beni had already plundered.

==Production==
===Development===
In the late 1980s, the producers James Jacks and Sean Daniel decided to update the original 1932 &quot;Mummy&quot; film for the modern era. Universal gave them the go-ahead, but only if they kept the budget around $10 million. Jacks remembers that the studio &quot;essentially wanted a low-budget horror franchise&quot;. In 1987, George A. Romero wrote a film treatment, and was attached to direct. Screenwriter Abbie Bernstein recalled that Universal wanted an unstoppable Mummy akin to the Terminator. Bernstein&#x27;s story took place in the present; scientists inadvertently bring a mummy to life, who wants to use an ancient device to destroy all life on earth. &quot;[The Mummy] had no more social interaction than the Tyrannosaurus did in &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;,&quot; Bernstein recalled. Romero drifted away from the project and the script was abandoned.

Next, Jacks and Daniel recruited horror filmmaker/writer Clive Barker to direct after his success with &quot;Hellraiser&quot;. Barker&#x27;s 1990 treatment and a successive 1991 screenplay by Mick Garris were dark and violent with the story revolving around an art museum that rebuilds an entire Egyptian tomb in Beverly Hills. Jacks recalls that Barker&#x27;s take was &quot;dark, sexual and filled with mysticism&quot;, and that, &quot;it would have been a great low-budget movie&quot;. Barker recalled the concept was too weird for the studio, and that his vision treated the Mummy as a jumping-off point for the film instead of the central character. The studio considered the film being “too perverted” to be made.

Alan Ormsby, unaware of previous efforts to launch the film, was brought on next. He pitched a more straightforward update to the 1932 film, again focusing on the Mummy as a relentless Terminator-like character. Joe Dante was attached as director, increasing the budget for his idea of Daniel Day-Lewis as a brooding Mummy. This version&#x27;s draft was later re-written by John Sayles. It was set in contemporary times and focused on reincarnation with elements of a love story. It came close to being made—with some elements like the flesh-eating scarabs making it to the final product—but Universal balked at the higher price tag.

Romero returned to the project 7 years later in 1994 with a vision of a zombie-style horror film similar to &quot;Night of the Living Dead&quot;, but which also relied heavily upon elements of tragic romance and ambivalence of identity. Romero completed a draft in October 1994, co-written with Ormsby and Sayles, that revolved around a female archaeologist named Helen Grover and her discovery of the tomb of Imhotep, an Egyptian general who lived in the time of Ramesses II. Unfolding in a nameless American city in modern times, events are set into motion when Imhotep inadvertently awakens as a result of his body having been exposed to rays from an MRI scan in a high-tech forensic archaeology lab. Helen finds herself drawn into a tentative relationship with Imhotep while also experiencing clairvoyant flashbacks to a previous life in the Nineteenth Dynasty of Egypt as a priestess of Isis. Summoning mystical powers through incantation, Imhotep later resurrects the mummy of Karis, a loyal slave. Karis embarks on a vengeful rampage against the grave robbers of his tomb. Romero&#x27;s script was considered too dark and violent by Jacks and the studio, who wanted a more accessible picture. Romero was unable to extricate himself from another contract he had in negotiation with MGM and so his involvement with the film was severed and the development of an entirely new script was commissioned.

Garris returned in 1995, developing a script that combined elements of the 1932 film and 1942&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;. This draft was a period piece awash in Egyptian art-inspired Art Deco, but the vision once again proved too expensive for the studio and was discarded for a modern setting. While the project came close to entering production, Universal was sold to Seagram. Sheinberg chose to produce &quot;The Mummy&quot; through his independent company and write a new script. Unable to find a suitable high-profile writer and director (Wes Craven was offered, but he turned it down) the project unraveled again and Garris left the project for the second time.

Still determined to create a new &quot;Mummy&quot; film, Universal hired Kevin Jarre in 1996 to write a new screenplay. According to Jacks, the executives were now convinced the film should be a larger-budget period piece. Stephen Sommers called Jacks and Daniel in 1997 with his vision of &quot;The Mummy&quot; &quot;as a kind of Indiana Jones or &quot;Jason and the Argonauts&quot; with the mummy as the creature giving the hero a hard time&quot;. Sommers had seen the original film when he was 8 and wanted to recreate the things he liked about it on a bigger scale. Discussing other classic horror characters, Sommers recalled that &quot;&quot;Frankenstein&quot; made me sad—I always felt sorry for him. &quot;Dracula&quot; was kind of cool and sexy. But &quot;The Mummy&quot; just plain scared me.&quot; He had wanted to make a &quot;Mummy&quot; film, but other writers or directors were always attached.

After the box office failure of &quot;&quot;, among others, Universal needed a hit film. At the time, Universal&#x27;s management had changed in response to the box office failures, and the losses led the studio to revisit its successful franchises from the 1930s. New chair Stacey Snider distributed packets detailing the studio&#x27;s holdings—including nearly 5,000 old scripts and films. Sommers received his window of opportunity and pitched his &quot;Mummy&quot; to Universal with an 18-page treatment.

Sommers did not want to remake the original film; he described the original as a horror film while his adaption would be &quot;more of a romantic-adventure-horror movie&quot;. Sommers incorporated his own research and the services of a UCLA archaeology professor to make the ancient Egyptian language accurate. Snider recalled that Sommers&#x27; treatment was unique in that it took place in the 1920s, rather than a contemporary setting. Universal liked the treatment so much that they approved the concept and increased the budget, and Sommers spent a year working on the screenplay.

===Casting===
Jacks offered the role of Rick O&#x27;Connell to Tom Cruise (who was later cast in the reboot film), Brad Pitt, Matt Damon and Ben Affleck, but the actors were not interested or could not fit the role into their respective schedules. Jacks and Sommers were impressed with &quot;George of the Jungle&quot;″s box office earnings and cast Brendan Fraser as a result; Sommers also commented that he felt Fraser fit the Errol Flynn swashbuckling character he had envisioned for Rick perfectly. Fraser&#x27;s turn in &quot;George&quot; bolstered his perceived star power, yet he remained far cheaper than the biggest actors working. Fraser understood that his character &quot;doesn&#x27;t take himself too seriously, otherwise the audience can&#x27;t go on that journey with him.&quot;

Evelyn Carnahan was named in tribute to Lady Evelyn Herbert, the daughter of amateur Egyptologist Lord Carnarvon, both present at the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamun in 1922. The studio originally considered American actresses, and Rachel Weisz auditioned multiple times before getting the part. Weisz was not a big fan of horror films, but saw the movie as more of a &quot;hokum&quot; comic book. John Hannah was picked for the role of Jonathan Carnahan, despite the fact that Hannah felt he was not a comedic actor, with Sommers saying that, &quot;He had no idea why we cast him.&quot;

Jacks had previously produced &quot;Hard Target&quot; with Arnold Vosloo. The South African actor liked the &quot;Mummy&quot; script but told Sommers he wanted to play the role &quot;absolutely straight. From Imhotep&#x27;s point of view, this is a skewed version of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot;.&quot; He was offered the role after a single audition. Carrying some extra weight and conscious of it because of Imhotep&#x27;s skimpy costume, Vosloo lost 10 to 15 pounds for the role by eschewing alcohol and sugar.

===Filming===
Principal photography began on May 4, 1998, and lasted 17 weeks. The crew was unable to shoot in Egypt due to unstable political conditions, so filming began in Marrakech, Morocco. Marrakech had the extra advantage of being much less modern than Cairo, making it easier to dress like the 1920s. The production set up two weeks before filming, taking down telephone wires and cables and shipping in period cars and camels. Locals served as extras for crowd scenes. After shooting in Marrakech, filming moved to the Sahara desert outside the small town of Erfoud. Production designer Allan Cameron found a geologic feature, Gara Medouar, where the exteriors for Hamunaptra could be constructed.

A concrete ramp was built to allow access into the horseshoe-shaped formation, where the city was built from prefabricated parts shipped from England. A survey of the area was conducted so that an accurate model and scale models of the columns and statues could be replicated back at Shepperton Studios, where all of the scenes involving the underground passageways of the City of the Dead were shot. These sets took 16 weeks to build and included fiberglass columns rigged with special effects for the movie&#x27;s final scenes.

To avoid dehydration in the scorching heat of the Sahara, the production&#x27;s medical team created a drink that the cast and crew had to consume every two hours. Sandstorms were daily inconveniences, and wildlife were a major problem, with many crew members having to be airlifted to medical care after being bitten or stung. Fraser nearly died during a scene where his character is hanged. The production had the official support of the Royal Moroccan Army, and the cast members had kidnapping insurance taken out on them.

After shooting in North Africa, production moved back to the United Kingdom before completion on August 29, 1998. Here, the dockyards at Chatham doubled for the Giza Port on the Nile River. This set was in length and featured &quot;a steam train, an Ajax traction engine, three cranes, an open two-horse carriage, four horse-drawn carts, five dressing horses and grooms, nine pack donkeys and mules, as well as market stalls, Arab-clad vendors and room for 300 costumed extras&quot;.

===Special effects===
The filmmakers reportedly spent $15 million of the budget on special effects alone. &quot;The Mummy&quot; features hundreds of shots that required optical or digital special effects in post-production. Effects house Industrial Light &amp; Magic (ILM) contributed more than 140 shots, with additional work done by Cinesite (60 shots) and Pacific Title/Mirage (45 shots, and the film&#x27;s title sequences.)

Sommers engaged ILM while still developing the script, having previously worked with ILM effects supervisor John Andrew Berton, Jr. on &quot;Deep Rising&quot;. ILM was eager for the challenge the film provided and produced a proof of concept for &quot;The Mummy&quot;″s effects in late 1997 to demonstrate the feasibility of Sommers&#x27; vision to executives.

The filmmakers sought to make something faster and scarier for the title creature, using cutting-edge techniques to create something never before seen. ILM started developing the look of the Mummy three months before filming started. &quot;We wanted to create a photorealistic corpse that was obviously not a man in a suit, obviously not an animatronic, and obviously alive,&quot; he recalled.

Over a months-long period, the designers worked on developing four distinct stages for the Mummy. Stage one was the mummy at its most decayed, with tattered bits of clothing, skin, and sinew hanging over a skeleton. Stage two added areas of regenerated skin, with stages three and four having the Mummy almost fully regenerated with only small areas of its innards showing through. The artists developed black-and-white sketches, then moved on to color treatments before building the creature in the computer; models were also made to use as reference for the digital artists.

The initial states of the Mummy were created entirely by computer, while later stages combined live-action performance. To supplement prosthetics and makeups applied on set, LED lights and pieces of tape served as tracking points so that digital &quot;cutouts&quot; could be applied to Vosloo&#x27;s face and body in postproduction; Vosloo remarked that walking around the set he felt like a Christmas tree.

The final creature was created with a combination of live-action acting with prosthetics and digital imagery. A digital representation of the Mummy was created in Alias, featuring simulated muscles for much of the body attached to a skeleton. The animators controlled parts of the Mummy via procedural animation; animating the underlying bones in turn controlled the stretch and movement of the overlaid muscles. Finally, layered on top of the procedural animation and motion capture was additional animation to tweak the performance; given the limitations of the technology, subtle movements like facial or hand animations had to be done by hand. Shots that featured Vosloo with overlaid computer-generated prosthetics were the most difficult for the effects team, requiring careful match moving.

Rather than using a stunt performer, Vosloo performed the motion capture for the character himself. Scenes were blocked out and performed on set during principal photography (first with Vosloo in the scene, then without). The shots were then replicated in the motion capture studio, with Vosloo&#x27;s performance recorded by eight cameras from different angles.

In addition to the Mummy, the script called for numerous effects shots to magnify the sweeping adventure of the film. Vistas like a flashback shot of the ancient city of Thebes combined location footage shot in the desert with composited actors shot on green screen, model miniatures, matte paintings, and computer-generated effects. The plagues Imhotep unleashes were accomplished using particle-based computer graphics, with ILM designers swapping out models of different qualities depending on how far from the camera the swarming &quot;insects&quot; were. While the film made extensive use of computer-generated imagery, many scenes, including ones where Rachel Weisz&#x27;s character is covered with rats and locusts, were shot using live animals.

Another close-up shot used footage of anesthetized locusts attached to a stunt performer combined with extra computer-generated pests. Sandstorms used procedural graphics based on programs used to create tornados in &quot;Twister&quot;, while the masses of flesh-eating scarabs used techniques developed for &quot;Star Wars: Episode I – The Phantom Menace&quot;. A shot of a firestorm engulfing Cairo combined real palm trees, physical models, and matte paintings with computer-generated hail, fire, and rubble. Pacific Title/Mirage also enhanced shots with digital camera shake.

The finale involves an army of mummies coming to Imhotep&#x27;s defense. Many of these mummies were created by Make-Up Effects Supervisor Nick Dudman, who produced makeup, prosthetics, and animatronic effects in the film. Each suit came with variations for stunt moves or pyrotechnics. After principal photography, the suits were sent to ILM to scan and be modeled in the computer. Using parts of the Imhotep mummy to save time, ILM recreated the underlings digitally to add into the scenes and used motion capture to animate them. The animators credited Fraser&#x27;s ability to consistently re-enact his movements in multiple takes as saving time when it came to match the motion-captured digital mummies to the live-action fight scenes.

==Music==

The score for &quot;The Mummy&quot; was composed and conducted by Jerry Goldsmith, with orchestrations provided by Alexander Courage. Goldsmith had previously scored &quot;Deep Rising&quot; for Sommers. As he reached the final few years of his career, Goldsmith was coming off a number of action and adventure films in the 1990s, from multiple &quot;Star Trek&quot; films to &quot;Air Force One&quot;. Goldsmith provided &quot;The Mummy&quot; with suitably bombastic music, with the traditional European orchestra supplemented with regional instruments such as the bouzouki.

The opening of the film contains nearly all of Goldsmith&#x27;s major themes for the score, with what music critic Jeff Bond calls an &quot;Egyptian theme&quot; reused in different configurations throughout to establish the epic settings and sense of place for Hamunaptra; a theme for Imhotep/the Mummy that is performed in an understated manner early in the film, before repeating in more forceful, brassy renditions after the Mummy has regenerated; a love theme used for both Imhotep/Anck-su-namun and Rick/Evelyn; and a heroic theme for Rick. In addition to the extensive brass and percussion elements, the score uses sparing amounts of vocals, unusual for much of Goldsmith&#x27;s work.

The soundtrack was released by Decca Records on May 4, 1999. Overall, Goldsmith&#x27;s score was well received. AllMusic described it as a &quot;grand, melodramatic score&quot; which delivered the expected highlights. Other reviews positively noted the dark, percussive sound meshed well with the plot, as well as the raw power of the music. The limited but masterful use of the chorus was also lauded, and most critics found the final track on the CD to be the best overall. On the other hand, some critics found the score lacked cohesion, and that the constant heavy action lent itself to annoying repetition. Roderick Scott off CineMusic.net summed up the score as &quot;representative of both Goldsmith&#x27;s absolute best and his most mediocre. Thankfully [...] his favourable work on this release wins out.&quot;

==Release==
Test audiences reacted poorly to the film&#x27;s title, which conjured up negative impressions of an old horror film, but domestic marketing president Marc Shmuger recalled that they decided &quot;we would redefine the myth with the film&quot; rather than change the title. Enthusiasm for the film was low, but Universal took out a television spot for the Super Bowl (reportedly costing $1.6 million) that Sommers recalled immediately reversed the discussion of the film&#x27;s prospects. The producers were concerned that the imminent release of &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot; would sink the film&#x27;s box office fortunes, resulting in them moving the release date from May 21 to 7.

&quot;The Mummy&quot; was the number one film in the United States and Canada on its opening weekend, grossing $43 million in 3,210 theaters. Its weekend take was the highest non-holiday May opening, and ninth-biggest opening of all time. The film later fell to second place behind &quot;The Phantom Menace&quot;. &quot;The Mummy&quot; grossed over $155.4 million in the United States and Canada and $261 million internationally, grossing over $418.1 million worldwide.

==Reception==
&quot;The Mummy&quot; received mixed reviews from critics. On Rotten Tomatoes, the film holds an approval rating of 62% based on 104 reviews, and an average rating of 5.9/10. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 48 out of 100 based on 34 critics, indicating mixed or average reviews. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;B&quot; on an A+ to F scale.
Roger Ebert of the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film a positive review, writing, &quot;There is hardly a thing I can say in its favor, except that I was cheered by nearly every minute of it. I cannot argue for the script, the direction, the acting or even the mummy, but I can say that I was not bored and sometimes I was unreasonably pleased.&quot; Critics such as &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;″s Owen Gleiberman and &quot;The New York Times&quot;″ Stephen Holden concurred with the sentiment of the film as a breezy crowd-pleaser.

Less positively, Keith Phipps of &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; wrote that the film&#x27;s attempt to create a big, &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-inspired action film felt &quot;forced&quot; and the result was unsatisfying. Other reviews complained of an overstuffed plot or recycled elements from better movies. Reviewers comparing the film to the 1932 original sometimes favored the original&#x27;s focus on atmosphere and dread, though others welcomed the change to a more energetic &quot;Indiana Jones&quot;-type film.
The effects were generally praised, especially the title creature. Ernest Larson&#x27;s review for &quot;Jump Cut&quot; felt that the effects were too similar to ILM&#x27;s other work, and that the effects alone could not support the weight of the rest of the movie. Bob Graham of the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; and Hal Hinson from the &quot;Dallas Observer&quot; agreed that the effects never overshadowed the human aspects of the film. Gleiberman said that the horrors of the effects were undercut by the lightheartedness of the film, while the BBC&#x27;s Almar Haflidason felt that the effects were occasionally unconvincing, and the heavy reliance on cutting-edge computer-generated imagery would likely date the film heavily as time passed.
Critics generally praised the acting, with Haflidason writing that the efforts of the cast sold material that would otherwise have been cheesy. David Hunter of &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot; wrote that all the actors managed to hold their own amid the special effects, although he felt Vosloo was largely wasted after Imhotep regenerates and the screenplay gives him little to do. Reviews from &quot;USA Today&quot;, the British Film Institute, and The A.V. Club said the film featured questionable casting of ethnic roles and occasionally traded in stereotypes of Arabs.
Writing to commemorate the twentieth anniversary of the film&#x27;s release, writer Maria Lewis said that on paper, &quot;The Mummy&quot; should not have been a success, as yet another period adventure film coming after a decade of failed period adventure films. Its connection with audiences, if not critics, was down to its successful blend of &quot;heart, humor, [heroics], and horror.&quot; She declared it the &quot;pivotal blockbuster of the nineties.&quot; Emma Stefansky, writing for &quot;Thrillist&quot;, said it was &quot;the beginning of the end&quot; for action-adventure films, as superhero films would soon supplant it in the coming years. &quot;Rotten Tomatoes&quot; called the film &quot;&quot;Indiana Jones&quot; for a new generation.&quot; Reviewers felt Fraser&#x27;s portrayal of Rick set a new mold for action heroes that more films would follow in the years after, while also considering Evelyn a character allowed to break free from a traditional damsel in distress role. Retrospective overviews Complex and Syfy described the film as a classic action film, generating retrospective praise for Brendan Fraser&#x27;s portrayal of Rick O&#x27;Connell.

==Accolades==
==Home media==
&quot;The Mummy&quot; was released on home video in VHS and DVD formats on September 28, 1999. The title was a tremendous success for Universal on home video, selling 7 million units on VHS and 1 million on DVD, making it the year&#x27;s best-selling live-action VHS and second best-selling DVD (behind &quot;The Matrix&quot;). &quot;The Mummy&quot;″s performance helped Universal gross over $1 billion in home video sales. On April 24, 2001, a two-disc Ultimate Edition DVD of the film premiered to coincide with the release of &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot;. The film was later digitally remastered and received a Blu-ray release in 2008. It was subsequently re-released on 4K Ultra HD in 2017 as both a stand-alone title and in a trilogy pack with its sequels.

== Adaptations==
&quot;The Mummy&quot;″s box office performance led to numerous sequels and spinoffs. The film sequel &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001) features most of the surviving principal characters. As a married couple, Rick and Evelyn confront Imhotep and the Scorpion King. The film also introduces the heroes&#x27; son, Alex. A second sequel, &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008), takes place in China with the &quot;Terracotta Emperor&quot; inspiring the villain, and Rachel Weisz replaced with Maria Bello. The films inspired an animated TV series titled &quot;The Mummy&quot;, which lasted two seasons, and a spin-off prequel, &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; (2002). Universal announced plans in 2012 to reboot the franchise; a new film, also titled &quot;The Mummy&quot;, was released in June 2017 to poor critical and box office performance. Developer Konami Nagoya published two video game adaptations of &quot;The Mummy&quot; under license from Universal Interactive Studios, in 2000: an action-adventure game for the PlayStation and Microsoft Windows developed by Rebellion Developments, as well as a Game Boy Color puzzle game. There was also a 2002 video game based on the 2001 animated series, published by Ubisoft for Game Boy Advance. The film also inspired a roller coaster, &quot;Revenge of the Mummy&quot;, found in three Universal Studios Theme Parks: Hollywood, California; Orlando, Florida; and Sentosa, Singapore. Characters of the film feature in &quot;Funko Fusion&quot;, set to be released in 2024.

<text>Washing is a method of cleaning, usually with water and soap or detergent. Regularly washing and then rinsing both body and clothing is an essential part of good hygiene and health.

Often people use soaps and detergents to assist in the emulsification of oils and dirt particles so they can be washed away. The soap can be applied directly, or with the aid of a washcloth or assisted with sponges or similar cleaning tools.

In social contexts, washing refers to the act of bathing, or washing different parts of the body, such as hands, hair, or faces. Excessive washing may damage the hair, causing dandruff, or cause rough skin/skin lesions. Some washing of the body is done ritually in religions like Christianity and Judaism, as an act of purification.

Washing can also refer to washing objects. For example, washing of clothing or other cloth items, like bedsheets, or washing dishes or cookwear. Keeping objects clean, especially if they interact with food or the skin, can help with sanitation. Other kinds of washing focus on maintaining cleanliness and durability of objects that get dirty, such washing one&#x27;s car, by lathering the exterior with car soap, or washing tools used in a dirty process. 
== Washing bodies ==
People wash themselves, or bathe periodically for religious ritual or therapeutic purposes or as a recreational activity.

In Europe, some people use a bidet to wash their external genitalia and the anal region after using the toilet, instead of using toilet paper. The bidet is common in predominantly Catholic countries where water is considered essential for anal cleansing.

More frequent is washing of just the hands, e.g. before and after preparing food and eating, after using the toilet, after handling something dirty, etc. Hand washing is important in reducing the spread of germs. Also common is washing the face, which is done after waking up, or to keep oneself cool during the day. Brushing one&#x27;s teeth is also essential for hygiene and is a part of washing.

Ritual purification through washing includes acts like Maundy, a Christian ritual involving washing of the feet, or ceremonial washing in Judaism.

<doc id="253832" wikidata="Q3532385" url="?curid=253832" title="Operation Dingson">
<text>Operation Dingson (5–18 June 1944) was an operation in the Second World War, conducted by 178 Free French paratroops of the 4th Special Air Service (SAS), commanded by Colonel Pierre-Louis Bourgoin, who jumped into German occupied France near Vannes, Morbihan, Southern Brittany, in Plumelec, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30) with Captain Pierre Marienne and 17 men, then advanced to Saint-Marcel (8–18 June).

At this time there were approximately 100,000 German troops, and artillery, preparing to move to the Normandy landing areas.

Immediately upon landing in Brittany, on the night of 5 June 1944 (11 h 30), the Free French SAS who jumped in near Plumelec went into action fighting against German troops (actually, Georgians and Ukrainians).

One hour later (0 h 40), the first victim of the liberation of his country, Corporal Émile Bouétard (born 1915 in Brittany) was killed near Plumelec.

The Free French SAS established a base (Saint-Marcel) and began to arm and equip members of local resistance fighters, operating with up to 3,000 Maquis fighters and 200 paratroopers. However, their base was heavily attacked by a German paratroop division on 18 June and was forced to disperse.

A few weeks later, Captain Pierre Marienne and 17 of his companions (6 paratroopers, 8 resistance fighters and 3 farmers) were summarily executed after being captured in Kerihuel, Plumelec (12 July at dawn).

The Dingson team was joined by the men who had just completed Operation Cooney. Dingson was conducted alongside Operation Samwest and Operation Lost.

==Operation Dingson 35A==
On 5 August 1944, 10 Waco CG-4 gliders towed by aircraft of 298 Squadron and 644 Squadron transported the French SAS men and armed jeeps to Brittany near Vannes (Locoal-Mendon), each glider carrying 3 SAS troopers and a jeep which carried two Vickers K machine guns plus explosives, sten guns and a PIAT antitank gun. The gliders were escorted by 32 Spitfires for part of the trip. One glider was lost with the death of the British pilot.

The SAS teams remained behind enemy lines in occupied territory until the Allies arrived. The glider pilots were looked after by the local Resistance and then met up with the advancing American army at Auray.

<doc id="253833" wikidata="Q909071" url="?curid=253833" title="The Mummy (1932 film)">
<text>The Mummy is a 1932 American pre-Code supernatural horror film directed by Karl Freund. The screenplay by John L. Balderston was adapted from a treatment written by Nina Wilcox Putnam and Richard Schayer. Released by Universal Studios as a part of the Universal Monsters franchise, the film stars Boris Karloff, Zita Johann, David Manners, Edward Van Sloan and Arthur Byron.

In the film, Karloff stars as Imhotep, an ancient Egyptian mummy who was killed for attempting to resurrect his dead lover, Anck-es-en-Amon. After being discovered and accidentally brought to life by a team of archaeologists, he disguises himself as a modern Egyptian named Ardath Bey and searches for Anck-es-en-Amon, who he believes has been reincarnated in the modern world.

While less profitable than its predecessors &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&quot; was still a commercial and critical success, becoming culturally influential and spawning several sequels, spin-offs, remakes, and reimaginings. The film and its sequels cemented the mummy archetype as a staple of the horror genre and Halloween festivities.

==Plot==
In 1921, an archaeological expedition led by Sir Joseph Whemple finds the mummy of an ancient Egyptian high priest named Imhotep. An inspection of the mummy by Whemple&#x27;s friend Dr. Muller reveals that the mummy&#x27;s viscera were not removed, and from the signs of struggling Muller deduces that although Imhotep had been wrapped like a traditional mummy, he had been buried alive. Also buried with Imhotep is a casket with a curse on it. Despite Muller&#x27;s warning, Sir Joseph&#x27;s assistant Ralph Norton opens it and finds an ancient life-giving scroll, the &quot;Scroll of Thoth&quot;. He translates the symbols and then reads the words aloud, causing Imhotep to rise from the dead. Norton is horrified and begins to laugh hysterically as Imhotep shuffles off with the scroll.

Ten years later, Imhotep has assimilated into modern society, taking the identity of an eccentric Egyptian historian named Ardath Bey. He calls upon Sir Joseph&#x27;s son Frank and Professor Pearson and shows them where to dig to find the tomb of the princess Ankh-es-en-Amon. After locating the tomb, the archaeologists present its treasures to the Cairo Museum, after which Bey disappears. The professor recalls that his assistant Norton went insane after finding the scroll and claimed the mummy had come to life and walked away from his sarcophagus, with Norton dying shortly afterward.

Bey soon encounters Helen Grosvenor, a half-Egyptian woman bearing a striking resemblance to the princess, who stays with Muller. Bey falls in love with her but so does Frank. After it is discovered that Bey is the mummy Imhotep, Muller urges Joseph to burn the Scroll of Thoth, but when Joseph tries to do so, Bey uses his magical powers to kill him and then hypnotizes Joseph’s Nubian servant to be his slave and bring the Scroll to him, as the Nubian’s Egyptian-related bloodline is susceptible to Imhotep’s magic. After the servant does so, he hypnotizes Helen to come to his place and there, reveals to her that his horrific death was punishment for sacrilege, as he attempted to resurrect his lover, Princess Anck-es-en-Amon.

Believing her to be the princess&#x27;s reincarnation, he attempts to make her his immortal bride by killing, mummifying, and resurrecting her. Frank and Muller come to her rescue but are immobilized by Bey&#x27;s magical powers. However Helen is saved when she remembers her ancestral past life and prays to the goddess Isis to come to her aid. Imhotep’s spell over the Nubian is broken, and the Nubian flees in terror. The statue of Isis raises its arm and emits a flash that sets the Scroll of Thoth on fire. This breaks the spell that had given Imhotep his immortality, causing him to crumble to dust. At the urging of Dr. Muller, Frank calls Helen back to the world of the living while the Scroll continues to burn.

==Production==

Inspired by the opening of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb in 1922 and the alleged &quot;curse of the pharaohs&quot;, producer Carl Laemmle Jr. commissioned story editor Richard Schayer to find a novel to form a basis for an Egyptian-themed horror film, just as the novels &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot; inspired their 1931 films &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;. Schayer found none, although the plot bears a strong resemblance to a short story by Arthur Conan Doyle entitled &quot;The Ring of Thoth&quot;. Schayer and writer Nina Wilcox Putnam learned about Alessandro Cagliostro and wrote a nine-page treatment entitled &quot;Cagliostro&quot;. The story, set in San Francisco, was about a 3,000-year-old magician who survives by injecting nitrates.

Pleased with the Cagliostro concept, Laemmle hired John L. Balderston to write the script. Balderston had contributed to &quot;Dracula&quot; and &quot;Frankenstein&quot;, and had covered the opening of Tutankhamun&#x27;s tomb for the &quot;New York World&quot; when he was a journalist so he was more than familiar with the well publicised tomb unearthing. Balderston moved the story to Egypt and renamed the film and its title character Imhotep, after the historical architect. He also changed the story from one of revenge upon all the women who resembled the main character&#x27;s ex-lover to one where the main character is determined to revive his old love by killing and mummifying her reincarnated self before resurrecting her with the spell of the Scroll of Thoth. Balderston invented the Scroll of Thoth, which gave an aura of authenticity to the story. Thoth was the wisest of the Egyptian gods who, when Osiris died, helped Isis bring her love back from the dead. Thoth is believed to have authored &quot;The Book of the Dead&quot;, which may have been the inspiration for Balderston&#x27;s Scroll of Thoth. Another likely source of inspiration is the fictional &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; that appeared in several ancient Egyptian stories.


Karl Freund, the cinematographer on &quot;Dracula&quot;, was hired to direct, making this his first film in the United States as a director. Freund had also been the cinematographer on Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;Metropolis&quot;. The film was retitled &quot;The Mummy&quot;. Freund cast Zita Johann, who believed in reincarnation, and named her character &#x27;Anck-es-en-Amon&#x27; after the only wife of Pharaoh Tutankhamun. The real Ankhesenamun&#x27;s body had not been discovered in the tomb of King Tutankhamun and her resting place was unknown. Her name, however, would not have been unknown to the general public.

Filming began in September 1932 and was scheduled for three weeks. Karloff&#x27;s first day was spent shooting the Mummy&#x27;s awakening from his sarcophagus. Make-up artist Jack Pierce had studied photos of Seti I&#x27;s mummy to design Imhotep. Pierce began transforming Karloff at 11 a.m., applying cotton, collodion and spirit gum to his face; clay to his hair; and wrapping him in linen bandages treated with acid and burnt in an oven, finishing the job at 7 p.m. Karloff finished his scenes at 2 a.m., and another two hours were spent removing the make-up. Karloff found the removal of gum from his face painful, and overall found the day &quot;the most trying ordeal I [had] ever endured&quot;. Although the images of Karloff wrapped in bandages are the most iconic taken from the film, Karloff appears on screen in this make-up only for the opening vignette; the rest of the film sees him wearing less elaborate make-up.

A lengthy and detailed flashback sequence was longer than now exists. This sequence showed the various forms Anck-es-en-Amon was reincarnated in over the centuries: Henry Victor is credited in the film as &quot;Saxon Warrior&quot;, despite his performance having been deleted. Stills exist of those sequences, but the footage (save for Karloff&#x27;s appearance and the sacrilegious events leading up to his mummification in ancient Egypt) are lost.

The piece of classical music heard during the opening credits, taken from the Tchaikovsky ballet &quot;Swan Lake&quot;, was previously also used (in the same arrangement) for the opening credits of Universal&#x27;s &quot;Dracula&quot; (1931) and &quot;Murders in the Rue Morgue&quot; (1932); it would be re-used as the title music of the same studio&#x27;s &quot;Secret of the Blue Room&quot; (1933).

==Historical accuracy==
The Scroll of Thoth is a fictional artifact, though likely based on the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. Thoth, the Egyptian god of knowledge, is said to be the inventor of hieroglyphs and the author of the &quot;Book of the Dead&quot;. The film also makes reference to the Egyptian myth of the goddess Isis resurrecting Osiris after his murder by his brother Set.

Conspirators were caught in a plot to assassinate Pharaoh Ramesses III around 1151 B.C. Papyrus trial transcripts reveal that the conspirators were prescribed &#x27;great punishments of death&#x27;, and archaeological evidence led to the suggestion that at least one of them may have been buried alive. Although such punishment was not common practice, this discovery probably influenced the film&#x27;s screenplay.

There is no evidence to suggest that the ancient Egyptians believed in or considered the possibility of reanimated mummies. Mummification was a sacred process meant to prepare a dead body to carry the soul through the afterlife, not for being reincarnated and living again on Earth. While it is possible that some individuals were mummified by being buried alive, it is unlikely that ancient Egyptians would think resurrection was possible because they were very aware of the fact that all the necessary organs had been removed and the body would be of little use on Earth anymore. Egyptologist Stuart Tyson Smith notes that &#x27;the idea of mobile mummies was not entirely alien to ancient Egypt&#x27;, citing one of the Hellenistic-era stories of Setna Khaemwas, which features both the animated mummy of Naneferkaptah and a fictional &quot;Book of Thoth&quot; and may have inspired screenwriter John Balderston.

==Reception==
The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was positive, although the film otherwise gained mixed critical reviews despite being a modest box office success. When the film opened at New York&#x27;s RKO Mayfair theater, a reviewer for &quot;The New York Times&quot; was ultimately unimpressed:For purposes of terror there are two scenes in &quot;The Mummy&quot; that are weird enough in all conscience. In the first the mummy comes alive and a young archaeologist, going quite mad, laughs in a way that raises the hair on the scalp. In the second Im-Ho-Tep is embalmed alive, and that moment when the tape is drawn across the man&#x27;s mouth and nose, leaving only his wild eyes staring out of the coffin, is one of decided horror. But most of &quot;The Mummy&quot; is costume melodrama for the children.
The film was a success at the box-office in the United Kingdom.

Review aggregator website Rotten Tomatoes reports an 89% score, based on 45 reviews, with an average rating of 7.9/10. The site&#x27;s consensus states: &quot;Relying more on mood and atmosphere than the thrills typical of modern horror fare, Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&quot; sets a masterful template for mummy-themed films to follow&quot;.

Cliff Aliperti at &quot;Immortal Ephemera&quot; opines: &quot;The perfect explanation of &quot;The Mummy&quot;″s quality comes from film historian William K. Everson&#x27;s closing comment in the brief Mummy section of his 1974 Classics of the Horror Film: &#x27;If one accepts &quot;The Bride of Frankenstein&quot; for its theatre and &quot;The Body Snatcher&quot; for its literacy, then one must regard &quot;The Mummy&quot; as the closest that Hollywood ever came to creating a poem out of horror&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;The Mummy&quot; has been decried for &quot;othering&quot; Eastern culture, especially portraying it as being more primitive and superstitious than Western culture. In one scene, Helen Grosvenor longs for the &quot;real&quot; (Classical) Egypt, disparaging that she is in contemporary Islamic Egypt. This is viewed by critic Caroline T. Schroeder as a slight against Islamic culture at the time.

According to Mark A. Hall, of the Perth Museum and Art Gallery, film portrayals of Egypt, especially in Egyptian archaeology, often deal with themes of appropriating and controlling the dangers of non-European cultures, or deal with the past if it relates to legend and superstition. Mummies, Hall says, are a common example of this. While he commended the archaeological wisdom espoused by Sir Joseph Whemple in the film, he writes that &quot;much more is learned from studying bits of broken pottery than from all the sensational finds&quot; and that archaeologists&#x27; job is to &quot;increase the sum of human knowledge of the past&quot;, and mentions that the archaeological element was only used as a foil for the supernatural elements. As a result, per Hall, what it and similar films offered was a &quot;depiction of archaeology as a colonial imposition by which cultural inheritance is appropriated&quot;.

==Legacy==
===Sequels===
Unlike other Universal Monsters films, &quot;The Mummy&quot; had no official sequel. The character was re-imagined in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1940) and its sequels; &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1942), &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Ghost&quot; (1944), &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Curse&quot; (1944), and the studio&#x27;s comedy–horror crossover film &quot;Abbott and Costello Meet the Mummy&quot; (1955). These films focus on the titular character named Kharis (Klaris in the Abbott and Costello film). &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot; recycled footage from the original film for use in the telling of Kharis&#x27;s origins, where Karloff is clearly visible in several of these recycled scenes but was not credited. Tom Tyler played the Mummy in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot;, and Lon Chaney Jr. played the Mummy in &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Ghost&quot;, and &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Curse&quot;.

===Hammer Film Productions series===
In the late 1950s, British Hammer Film Productions took up the &quot;Mummy&quot; theme, beginning with &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1959), which, rather than being a remake of the 1932 Karloff film, is based on Universal&#x27;s &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot; (1940) and &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1942). Hammer&#x27;s follow-ups — &quot;The Curse of the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1964), &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Shroud&quot; (1966) and &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; (1971) — are unrelated to the first film or even to each other, apart from the appearance of &quot;The Scroll of Life&quot; in &quot;Curse of the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot; and &quot;Blood from the Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;.

===Remake series===

The much later Universal film &quot;The Mummy&quot; (1999) also suggests that it is a remake of the 1932 film, but has a different storyline and is more similar to The Mummy&#x27;s Hand than the original. In common with most postmodern remakes of classic horror and science-fiction films, it may be considered as such in that it is produced-distributed by the same studio, its titular character is again named Imhotep, resurrected by the Book of the Dead, and out to find the present-day embodiment of the soul of his beloved Anck-su-namun, and features an Egyptian named Ardeth Bay (in this case, a guard of the city and of Imhotep&#x27;s tomb). This film spawned two sequels with &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; (2001) and &quot;The Mummy: Tomb of the Dragon Emperor&quot; (2008). &quot;The Mummy Returns&quot; also spawned a prequel spin-off of that sequel, &quot;The Scorpion King&quot; (2002), which in turn spawned a prequel, &quot;The Scorpion King 2: Rise of a Warrior&quot; (2008), and three sequels, &quot;The Scorpion King 3: Battle for Redemption&quot; (2012), &quot;The Scorpion King 4: Quest for Power&quot; (2015) and &quot;Scorpion King: Book of Souls&quot; (2018). Also, a short-lived animated series simply titled &quot;The Mummy&quot; ran from 2001 to 2003.

===Reboot===
In 2012, Universal announced a reboot of the film, more in-line with the horror films, from the Universal Monsters film franchise. The reboot was directed by Alex Kurtzman. &quot;The Mummy&quot; was planned as the first film in a series of interconnected monster films, as Universal has planned to build a shared universe film series out of its vault of classic monster movies. Tom Cruise stars in the film. Sofia Boutella portrays Princess Ahmunet / The Mummy for the film, while Russell Crowe appears as Dr. Henry Jekyll / Mr. Hyde, two roles which had previously been portrayed by Boris Karloff in the studios&#x27; previous film franchise. It received negative reviews and is considered a box office bomb, scrapping the plans for the upcoming films of the Dark Universe.

===Honors===
The film is recognized by American Film Institute in these lists:
* 2001: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Thrills – Nominated
* 2003: AFI&#x27;s 100 Years...100 Heroes &amp; Villains:
** Imhotep – Nominated Villain

<text>The Mummy is a 1959 British horror film, directed by Terence Fisher and starring Peter Cushing and Christopher Lee. It was written by Jimmy Sangster and produced by Michael Carreras and Anthony Nelson Keys for Hammer Film Productions. The film was distributed in the U.S. in 1959 on a double bill with either the Vincent Price film &quot;The Bat&quot; or the Universal film &quot;Curse of the Undead&quot;.

Though the title suggests Universal Pictures&#x27; 1932 film of the same name, the film actually derives its plot and characters entirely from two 1940s Universal films, &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Hand&quot; and &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Tomb&quot;, with the climax borrowed directly from &quot;The Mummy&#x27;s Ghost&quot;. The character name Joseph Whemple, the use of a sacred scroll, and a few minor plot elements are the only connections with the 1932 version.

== Plot ==
In Egypt in 1895, archaeologists John Banning, his father Stephen and his uncle Joseph Whemple are searching for the tomb of Princess Ananka, the high priestess of the god Karnak. John has a broken leg and cannot accompany his father and uncle when they open the tomb. Before they enter, an Egyptian named Mehemet Bey warns them not to go in, lest they face the fatal curse against desecrators. Stephen and Joseph ignore him, and discover within the sarcophagus of Ananka. After Joseph leaves to tell John the good news, Stephen finds the Scroll of Life and reads from it. Outside, members of the archaeological team hear his screams and rush into the tomb to find Stephen in a catatonic state.

Three years later, back in England, Stephen Banning comes out of his catatonia at the Engerfield Nursing Home for the Mentally Disordered, and sends for his son. He tells him that when he read from the Scroll of Life, he unintentionally brought back to life Kharis, the mummified high priest of Karnak. The high priest had been sentenced to be entombed alive to serve as the guardian of Princess Ananka&#x27;s tomb: Kharis secretly loved the princess and attempted to restore her to life after she died; when he was discovered, eternal life and mummification were his punishment. Now, Stephen tells his disbelieving son that Kharis will hunt down and kill all those who desecrated Ananka&#x27;s tomb.

Meanwhile, Mehemet Bey, a devoted worshiper of Karnak, comes to Engerfield under the alias of Mehemet Atkil to wreak vengeance on the Bannings. He hires a pair of drunken carters, Pat and Mike, to bring the slumbering Kharis in a crate to his rented home, but the two men&#x27;s drunken driving cause Kharis&#x27;s crate to fall off and sink into a bog. Later, using the Scroll of Life, Mehemet exhorts Kharis to rise from the mud, then sends him to murder Stephen Banning. When Kharis kills Joseph Whemple the next night, John witnesses it. He shoots Kharis with a revolver at close range, but to no effect.

Police Inspector Mulrooney is assigned to solve the murders but, because he is skeptical and deals only in &quot;cold, hard facts&quot;, he does not believe John&#x27;s incredible story about a killer mummy, even when John tells him that he is likely to be Kharis&#x27; third victim. While Mulrooney investigates, John notices that his wife Isobel bears an uncanny resemblance to Princess Ananka. Gathering testimonial evidence from other individuals in the community, Mulrooney slowly begins to wonder if the mummy is real.

Mehemet Bey sends the mummy to the Bannings&#x27; home to slay his final victim. However, when Isobel rushes to her husband&#x27;s aid, Kharis sees her, releases John, and leaves. Mehemet Bey mistakenly believes that Kharis has completed his task, and prepares to return to Egypt. John, suspecting Mehemet Bey of being the one controlling the mummy, pays him a visit, much to Bey&#x27;s surprise.

After John leaves, Mehemet Bey leads Kharis in a second attempt on John&#x27;s life. The mummy knocks Mulrooney unconscious, while Mehemet Bey deals with another policeman guarding the house. Kharis finds John in his study and starts to choke him. Alerted by John&#x27;s shouts, Isobel runs to the house without Mulrooney; at first, the mummy does not recognize her, but John tells her to loosen her hair and the mummy releases John. When Mehemet orders Kharis to kill Isobel, he refuses; Mehemet tries to murder Isobel himself, but is killed by Kharis instead. The mummy carries the unconscious Isobel into the swamp, followed by John, Mulrooney and other policemen. John yells to Isobel; when she regains consciousness, she tells Kharis to put her down. The mummy reluctantly obeys. When Isobel has moved away from him, the policemen open fire, causing Kharis to sink into a quagmire, taking the Scroll of Life with him.

==Production==
Filming occurred at Bray Studios in Berkshire. Originally the scenes of Kharis&#x27;s tongue being cut out and shotgun demise were more graphic, but were trimmed for the British censor.

In the video, &quot;Flesh and Blood: The Hammer Heritage of Horror&quot;, Peter Cushing says he suggested the scene in which he drives a spear through the mummy. He was inspired by the pre-release poster (see image above) which shows the mummy with a shaft of light passing through it.

A fibreglass replica of a sarcophagus created for the film is in the collection of the Perth Museum and Art Gallery.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;The Monthly Film Bulletin&quot; of the UK wrote: &quot;More glamorously photographed than ever, Hammer&#x27;s latest excursion into nineteenth century macabre fantasy is weighed down by wordy historical exposition, flashbacks to ancient Egyptian burial ceremonies and a resultant slackening in pace&quot;. Howard Thompson of &quot;The New York Times&quot; thought that the film was &quot;woodenly directed&quot; and &quot;should have been better&quot;. &quot;Variety&quot; wrote that the film was &quot;excellently executed&quot; in all technical departments, and while there was &quot;little of actual newness&quot; to the plot, the film &quot;carries the type of action expected, and while chiller aspects aren&#x27;t too pronounced they&#x27;re sufficient to those who want to find them&quot;. &quot;Harrison&#x27;s Reports&quot; called it &quot;a fairly good picture of its kind, produced on a more lavish scale than its predecessors and enhanced by Technicolor photography&quot;.

&quot;The Hammer Story: The Authorised History of Hammer Films&quot; wrote of the film: &quot;Structurally little more than a string of picturesque and nice-lit killings, &quot;The Mummy&quot;&#x27;s melancholic presentation and romantic undertow grants it a certain atmosphere which elevates this bandaged brute far beyond its cinematic predecessors&quot;.
It currently holds a positive 89% &quot;Fresh&quot; on film review aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes based on 9 reviews.

Nina Wilcox Putnam, co-writer of the original 1932 Universal Mummy film, was highly critical of the Hammer adaption, writing in a letter to &quot;Time&quot; magazine: &quot;This disgusting English remake was done without my knowledge or consent, and it has been a terrible shock at the age of 75, to find such a work attributed to me, however wrongly and by indirection&quot;.

== In other media ==
The film was adapted into a 12-page comic strip for the July 1978 issue (#22) of the magazine &quot;Hammer&#x27;s Halls of Horror&quot;. It was drawn by David Jackson from a script by Steve Moore. The cover of the issue featured a painting by Brian Lewis of Christopher Lee as Kharis.

The film is cited as a particular influence on the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;Pyramids of Mars&quot; (1975).

<text>During the Second World War, Operation Lost was a reactive seven-man Special Air Service operation inserted into Brittany alongside Operation Dingson on 22–23 June 1944. The team, drawn from officers and men of 37 Military Mission and the SAS Brigade, was originally inserted to discover what had happened to the Dingson base after it had been attacked and dispersed by German led rear area security troops.

These SAS operations trained and armed local fighters and harassed the defenders as they tried to react to the Overlord landings. The Lost team was active from 23 June to 18 July.

The team was commanded by Major Oswald A. J. Cary-Elwes, (a career soldier who subsequently rose to the rank of Lieutenant-Colonel) who was asked to join the SAS by its first Commanding Officer David Stirling. Stirling and Cary-Elwes were friends.

The Lost team was given instructions to search for and re-organise irregular French resistance forces formerly in touch with the French SAS, but which had been attacked and dispersed into woodland. This was one of several tasks under the overall leadership of the one-armed Free French Colonel, later member of Parliament, Pierre Bourgoin (1907-1970), the CO of 4eme BIA (Bataillon de l&#x27;Infanterie de l&#x27;Air) or 2eme RCP (Regiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes), which was known, colloquially, to the British as &#x27;4 SAS&#x27;.

Cary-Elwes and his batman were eventually exfiltrated by sea from northern Brittany in July 1944, on an escape line maintained by MI9, a now-defunct branch of the British War Office Directorate of Intelligence, at this period closely integrated with the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and the Secret Intelligence Service (SIS) who had joint control of the branch and knew it as P15.

<text>Surround sound is a technique for enriching the fidelity and depth of sound reproduction by using multiple audio channels from speakers that surround the listener (surround channels). Its first application was in movie theaters. Prior to surround sound, theater sound systems commonly had three &quot;screen channels&quot; of sound that played from three loudspeakers (left, center, and right) located in front of the audience. Surround sound adds one or more channels from loudspeakers to the side or behind the listener that are able to create the sensation of sound coming from any horizontal direction (at ground level) around the listener.

The technique enhances the perception of sound spatialization by exploiting sound localization: a listener&#x27;s ability to identify the location or origin of a detected sound in direction and distance. This is achieved by using multiple discrete audio channels routed to an array of loudspeakers. Surround sound typically has a listener location (sweet spot) where the audio effects work best and presents a fixed or forward perspective of the sound field to the listener at this location.

Surround sound formats vary in reproduction and recording methods, along with the number and positioning of additional channels. The most common surround sound specification, the ITU&#x27;s 5.1 standard, calls for 6 speakers: center (C), in front of the listener; left (L) and right (R), at angles of 60°; left surround (LS) and right surround (RS) at angles of 100–120°; and a subwoofer, whose position is not critical.

== Fields of application ==
Though cinema and soundtracks represent the major uses of surround techniques, its scope of application is broader than that, as surround sound permits creation of an audio environment for all sorts of purposes. Multichannel audio techniques may be used to reproduce contents as varied as music, speech, natural or synthetic sounds for cinema, television, broadcasting, or computers. In terms of music content for example, a live performance may use multichannel techniques in the context of an open-air concert, of a musical theatre performance or for broadcasting; for a film, specific techniques are adapted to movie theater or to home (e.g. home cinema systems). The narrative space is also a content that can be enhanced through multichannel techniques. This applies mainly to cinema narratives, for example the speech of the characters of a film, but may also be applied to plays performed in a theatre, to a conference, or to integrate voice-based comments in an archeological site or monument. For example, an exhibition may be enhanced with topical ambient sound of water, birds, train or machine noise. Topical natural sounds may also be used in educational applications. Other fields of application include video game consoles, personal computers and other platforms. In such applications, the content would typically be synthetic noise produced by the computer device in interaction with its user. Significant work has also been done using surround sound for enhanced situation awareness in military and public safety application.

== Types of media and technologies ==
Commercial surround sound media include videocassettes, DVDs, and SDTV broadcasts encoded as analog matrixed Dolby Surround compressed Dolby Digital and DTS, and lossless audio such as DTS HD Master Audio and Dolby TrueHD on HDTV Blu-ray Disc and HD DVD, which are identical to the studio master. Other commercial formats include the competing DVD-Audio (DVD-A) and Super Audio CD (SACD) formats, and MP3 Surround. Cinema 5.1 surround formats include Dolby Digital and DTS. Sony Dynamic Digital Sound (SDDS) is an 8-channel cinema configuration that features 5 independent audio channels across the front with two independent surround channels, and a Low-frequency effects channel. Traditional 7.1 surround speaker configuration introduces two additional rear speakers to the conventional 5.1 arrangement, for a total of four surround channels and three front channels, to create a more 360° sound field.

Most surround sound recordings are created by film production companies or video game producers; however some consumer camcorders have such capability either built-in or available separately. Surround sound technologies can also be used in music to enable new methods of artistic expression. After the failure of quadraphonic audio in the 1970s, multichannel music has slowly been reintroduced since 1999 with the help of SACD and DVD-Audio formats. Some AV receivers, stereophonic systems, and computer sound cards contain integral digital signal processors or digital audio processors to simulate surround sound from a stereophonic source (see fake stereo).

In 1967, the rock group Pink Floyd performed the first-ever surround sound concert at &quot;Games for May&quot;, a lavish affair at London’s Queen Elizabeth Hall where the band debuted its custom-made quadraphonic speaker system. The control device they had made, the Azimuth Co-ordinator, is now displayed at London&#x27;s Victoria and Albert Museum, as part of their Theatre Collections gallery.

== History ==
The first documented use of surround sound was in 1940, for the Disney studio&#x27;s animated film &quot;Fantasia&quot;. Walt Disney was inspired by Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s operatic piece &quot;Flight of the Bumblebee&quot; to have a bumblebee featured in his musical &quot;Fantasia&quot; and also sound as if it was flying in all parts of the theatre. The initial multichannel audio application was called &#x27;Fantasound&#x27;, comprising three audio channels and speakers. The sound was diffused throughout the cinema, controlled by an engineer using some 54 loudspeakers. The surround sound was achieved using the sum and the difference of the phase of the sound. However, this experimental use of surround sound was excluded from the film in later showings. In 1952, &quot;surround sound&quot; successfully reappeared with the film &quot;This is Cinerama&quot;, using discrete seven-channel sound, and the race to develop other surround sound methods took off.

In the 1950s, the German composer Karlheinz Stockhausen experimented with and produced ground-breaking electronic compositions such as &quot;Gesang der Jünglinge&quot; and &quot;Kontakte&quot;, the latter using fully discrete and rotating quadraphonic sounds generated with industrial electronic equipment in Herbert Eimert&#x27;s studio at the &quot;Westdeutscher Rundfunk&quot; (WDR). Edgar Varese&#x27;s Poème électronique, created for the Iannis Xenakis-designed Philips Pavilion at the 1958 Brussels World&#x27;s Fair, also used spatial audio with 425 loudspeakers used to move sound throughout the pavilion.

In 1957, working with artist Jordan Belson, Henry Jacobs produced Vortex: Experiments in Sound and Light - a series of concerts featuring new music, including some of Jacobs&#x27; own, and that of Karlheinz Stockhausen, and many others - taking place in the Morrison Planetarium in Golden Gate Park, San Francisco. Sound designers commonly regard this as the origin of the (now standard) concept of &quot;surround sound.&quot; The program was popular, and Jacobs and Belson were invited to reproduce it at the 1958 World Expo in Brussels.
There are also many other composers that created ground-breaking surround sound works in the same time period.

In 1978, a concept devised by Max Bell for Dolby Laboratories called &quot;split surround&quot; was tested with the movie &quot;Superman&quot;. This led to the 70mm stereo surround release of &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, which became one of the first formal releases in cinemas with three channels in the front and two in the rear. There were typically five speakers behind the screens of 70mm-capable cinemas, but only the left, center and right were used full-frequency, while center-left and center-right were only used for bass-frequencies (as it is currently common). The &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot; encoder/decoder was designed by Michael Karagosian, also for Dolby Laboratories. The surround mix was produced by an Oscar-winning crew led by Walter Murch for American Zoetrope. The format was also deployed in 1982 with the stereo surround release of &quot;Blade Runner&quot;.

The 5.1 version of surround sound originated in 1987 at the famous French Cabaret Moulin Rouge. A French engineer, Dominique Bertrand used a mixing board specially designed in cooperation with Solid State Logic, based on 5000 series and including six channels. Respectively: A left, B right, C center, D left rear, E right rear, F bass. The same engineer had already achieved a 3.1 system in 1974, for the International Summit of Francophone States in Dakar, Senegal.

== Creating surround sound ==
Surround sound is created in several ways. The first and simplest method is using a surround sound recording technique—capturing two distinct stereo images, one for the front and one for the back or by using a dedicated setup, e.g., an augmented Decca tree—or mixing-in surround sound for playback on an audio system using speakers encircling the listener to play audio from different directions. A second approach is processing the audio with psychoacoustic sound localization methods to simulate a two-dimensional (2-D) sound field with headphones. A third approach, based on Huygens&#x27; principle, attempts reconstructing the recorded sound field wavefronts within the listening space; an &quot;audio hologram&quot; form. One form, wave field synthesis (WFS), produces a sound field with an even error field over the entire area. Commercial WFS systems, currently marketed by companies &quot;sonic emotion&quot; and &quot;Iosono&quot;, require many loudspeakers and significant computing power. The 4th approach is using three mics, one for front, one for side and one for rear, also called Double MS recording.

The Ambisonics form, also based on Huygens&#x27; principle, gives an exact sound reconstruction at the central point; however, it is less accurate away from the central point. There are many free and commercial software programs available for Ambisonics, which dominates most of the consumer market, especially musicians using electronic and computer music. Moreover, Ambisonics products are the standard in surround sound hardware sold by Meridian Audio. In its simplest form, Ambisonics consumes few resources, however this is not true for recent developments, such as Near Field Compensated Higher Order Ambisonics. Some years ago it was shown that, in the limit, WFS and Ambisonics converge.

Finally, surround sound can also be achieved by mastering level, from stereophonic sources as with Penteo, which uses digital signal processing analysis of a stereo recording to parse out individual sounds to component panorama positions, then positions them, accordingly, into a five-channel field. However, there are more ways to create surround sound out of stereo, for instance with the routines based on QS and SQ for encoding Quad sound, where instruments were divided over 4 speakers in the studio. This way of creating surround with software routines is normally referred to as &quot;upmixing&quot;, which was particularly successful on the Sansui QSD-series decoders that had a mode where it mapped the L ↔ R stereo onto an ∩ arc.

== Standard configurations ==
There are many alternative setups available for a surround sound experience, with a 3-2 (3 front, 2 back speakers and a low-frequency effects channel) configuration (more commonly referred to as 5.1 surround) being the standard for most surround sound applications, including cinema, television and consumer applications. This is a compromise between the ideal image creation of a room and that of practicality and compatibility with two-channel stereo. Because most surround sound mixes are produced for 5.1 surround (6 channels), larger setups require matrixes or processors to feed the additional speakers.

The standard surround setup consists of three front speakers LCR (left, center and right), two surround speakers LS and RS (left and right surround respectively) and a subwoofer for the low-frequency effects (LFE) channel, that is low-pass filtered at 120 Hz. The angles between the speakers have been standardized by the ITU (International Telecommunication Union) recommendation 775 and AES (Audio Engineering Society) as follows: 60 degrees between the L and R channels (allows for two-channel stereo compatibility) with the center speaker directly in front of the listener. The Surround channels are placed 100–120 degrees from the center channel, with the subwoofer&#x27;s positioning not being critical due to the low directional factor of frequencies below 120 Hz. The ITU standard also allows for additional surround speakers, that need to be distributed evenly between 60 and 150 degrees.

Surround mixes of more or fewer channels are acceptable, if they are compatible, as described by the ITU-R BS. 775-1, with 5.1 surround. The 3-1 channel setup (consisting of one monophonic surround channel) is such a case, where both LS and RS are fed by the monophonic signal at an attenuated level of -3 dB.

The function of the center channel is to anchor the signal so that any central panned images do not shift when a listener is moving or is sitting away from the sweet spot. The center channel also prevents any timbral modifications from occurring, which is typical for 2-channel stereo, due to phase differences at the two ears of a listener. The center channel is especially used in films and television, with dialogue primarily feeding the center channel. The function of the center channel can either be of a monophonic nature (as with dialogue) or it can be used in combination with the left and right channels for true three-channel stereo. Motion Pictures tend to use the center channel for monophonic purposes with stereo being reserved purely for the left and right channels. Surround microphone techniques have however been developed that fully use the potential of three-channel stereo.

In 5.1 surround, phantom images between the front speakers are quite accurate, with images towards the back and especially to the sides being unstable. The localization of a virtual source, based on level differences between two loudspeakers to the side of a listener, shows great inconsistency across the standardized 5.1 setup, also being largely affected by movement away from the reference position. 5.1 surround is therefore limited in its ability to convey 3D sound, making the surround channels more appropriate for ambiance or effects.)

7.1 channel surround is another setup, most commonly used in large cinemas, that is compatible with 5.1 surround, though it is not stated in the ITU standards. 7.1 channel surround adds two additional channels, center-left (CL) and center-right (CR) to the 5.1 surround setup, with the speakers situated 15 degrees off center from the listener. This convention is used to cover an increased angle between the front loudspeakers as a product of a larger screen.

==Surround microphone techniques==
Most 2-channel stereophonic microphone techniques are compatible with a 3-channel setup (LCR), as many of these techniques already contain a center microphone or microphone pair. Microphone techniques for LCR should, however, try to obtain greater channel separation to prevent conflicting phantom images between L/C and L/R for example. Specialised techniques have therefore been developed for 3-channel stereo. Surround microphone techniques largely depend on the setup used, therefore being biased towards the 5.1 surround setup, as this is the standard.

Surround recording techniques can be differentiated into those that use single arrays of microphones placed in close proximity, and those treating front and rear channels with separate arrays. Close arrays present more accurate phantom images, whereas separate treatment of rear channels is usually used for ambiance. For accurate depiction of an acoustic environment, such as a halls, side reflections are essential. Appropriate microphone techniques should therefore be used if room impression is important. Although the reproduction of side images are very unstable in the 5.1 surround setup, room impressions can still be accurately presented.

Some microphone techniques used for coverage of three front channels, include double-stereo techniques, INA-3 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement), the Decca Tree setup and the OCT (Optimum Cardioid Triangle). Surround techniques are largely based on 3-channel techniques with additional microphones used for the surround channels. A distinguishing factor for the pickup of the front channels in surround is that less reverberation should be picked up, as the surround microphones will be responsible for the pickup of reverberation. Cardioid, hypercardioid, or supercardioid polar patterns will therefore often replace omnidirectional polar patterns for surround recordings. To compensate for the lost low-end of directional (pressure gradient) microphones, additional omnidirectional (pressure microphones), exhibiting an extended low-end response, can be added. The microphone&#x27;s output is usually low-pass filtered.
A simple surround microphone configuration involves the use of a front array in combination with two backward-facing omnidirectional room microphones placed about 10–15 meters away from the front array. If echoes are notable, the front array can be delayed appropriately. Alternatively, backward facing cardioid microphones can be placed closer to the front array for a similar reverberation pickup.

The INA-5 (Ideal Cardioid Arrangement) is a surround microphone array that uses five cardioid microphones resembling the angles of the standardized surround loudspeaker configuration defined by the ITU Rec. 775. Dimensions between the front three microphone as well as the polar patterns of the microphones can be changed for different pickup angles and ambient response. This technique therefore allows for great flexibility.

A well-established microphone array is the Fukada Tree, which is a modified variant of the Decca Tree stereo technique. The array consists of five spaced cardioid microphones, three front microphones resembling a Decca Tree and two surround microphones. Two additional omnidirectional outriggers can be added to enlarge the perceived size of the orchestra or to better integrate the front and surround channels. The L, R, LS and RS microphones should be placed in a square formation, with L/R and LS/RS angled at 45 degrees and 135 degrees from the center microphone respectively. Spacing between these microphones should be about 1.8 meters. This square formation is responsible for the room impressions. The center channel is placed a meter in front of the L and R channels, producing a strong center image. The surround microphones are usually placed at the critical distance (where the direct and reverberant field is equal), with the full array usually situated several meters above and behind the conductor.

The NHK (Japanese broadcasting company) developed an alternative technique also involving five cardioid microphones. Here a baffle is used for separation between the front left and right channels, which are 30 cm apart. Outrigger omnidirectional microphones, low-pass filtered at 250 Hz, are spaced 3 meters apart in line with the L and R cardioids. These compensate for the bass roll-off of the cardioid microphones and also add expansiveness. A 3-meter spaced microphone pair, situated 2–3 meters behind the front array, is used for the surround channels. The center channel is again placed slightly forward, with the L/R and LS/RS again angled at 45 and 135 degrees respectively.

The OCT-Surround (Optimum Cardioid Triangle-Surround) microphone array is an augmented technique of the stereo OCT technique using the same front array with added surround microphones. The front array is designed for minimum crosstalk, with the front left and right microphones having supercardioid polar patterns and angled at 90 degrees relative to the center microphone. It is important that high-quality small diaphragm microphones are used for the L and R channels to reduce off-axis coloration. Equalization can also be used to flatten the response of the supercardioid microphones to signals coming in at up to about 30 degrees from the front of the array. The center channel is placed slightly forward. The surround microphones are backward-facing cardioid microphones, that are placed 40 cm back from the L and R microphones. The L, R, LS and RS microphones pick up early reflections from both the sides and the back of an acoustic venue, therefore giving significant room impressions. Spacing between the L and R microphones can be varied to obtain the required stereo width.

Specialized microphone arrays have been developed to record a space&#x27;s ambiance. These arrays are used in combination with suitable front arrays or can be added to above-mentioned surround techniques. The Hamasaki square (also proposed by NHK) is a well-established microphone array used for the pickup of hall ambience. Four figure-eight microphones are arranged in a square, ideally placed far away and high up in the hall. Spacing between the microphones should be between 1–3 meters. The microphones nulls (zero pickup point) are set to face the main sound source with positive polarities outward facing, therefore very effectively minimizing the direct sound pickup as well as echoes from the back of the hall The back two microphones are mixed to the surround channels, with the front two channels being mixed in combination with the front array into L and R.

Another ambient technique is the IRT (Institut für Rundfunktechnik) cross. Here, four cardioid microphones, 90 degrees relative to one another, are placed in square formation, separated by 21–25 cm. The front two microphones should be positioned 45 degrees off axis from the sound source. This technique therefore resembles back-to-back near-coincident stereo pairs. The microphones outputs are fed to the L, R and LS, RS channels. The disadvantage of this approach is that direct sound pickup is quite significant.

Many recordings do not require pickup of side reflections. For Live Pop music concerts a more appropriate array for the pickup of ambiance is the cardioid trapezium. All four cardioid microphones are backward facing and angled at 60 degrees from one another, therefore similar to a semi-circle. This is effective for the pickup of audience and ambiance.

All the above-mentioned microphone arrays take up considerable space, making them quite ineffective for field recordings. In this respect, the double mid-side (MS) technique is quite advantageous. This array uses back-to-back cardioid microphones, one facing forward, the other backward, combined with either one or two figure-eight microphones. Different channels are obtained by the sum and difference of the figure-eight and cardioid patterns. When using only one figure-eight microphone, the double MS technique is extremely compact and therefore also perfectly compatible with monophonic playback. This technique also allows for postproduction changes of the pickup angle.

== Bass management ==
Surround replay systems may make use of &quot;bass management&quot;, the fundamental principle of which is that bass content in the incoming signal, irrespective of channel, should be directed only to loudspeakers capable of handling it, whether the latter are the main system loudspeakers or one or more special low-frequency speakers called subwoofers.

There is a notation difference before and after the bass management system. Before the bass management system, there is a LFE channel. After the bass management system, there is a subwoofer signal. A common misunderstanding is the belief that the LFE channel is the &quot;subwoofer channel&quot;. The bass management system may direct bass to one or more subwoofers (if present) from &quot;any&quot; channel, not just from the LFE channel. Also, if there is no subwoofer speaker present then the bass management system can direct the LFE channel to one or more of the main speakers.

== Low frequency effects channel ==
Because the LFE channel requires only a fraction of the bandwidth of the other audio channels, it is referred to as the &quot;.1&quot; channel; for example &quot;5.1&quot; or &quot;7.1&quot;.

The LFE channel is a source of some confusion in surround sound. It was originally developed to carry extremely low &quot;sub-bass&quot; cinematic sound effects (e.g., the loud rumble of thunder or explosions) on their own channel. This allowed theaters to control the volume of these effects to suit the particular cinema&#x27;s acoustic environment and sound reproduction system. Independent control of the sub-bass effects also reduced the problem of intermodulation distortion in analog movie sound reproduction.

In the original movie theater implementation, the LFE was a separate channel fed to one or more subwoofers. Home replay systems, however, may not have a separate subwoofer, so modern home surround decoders and systems often include a bass management system that allows bass on any channel (main or LFE) to be fed only to the loudspeakers that can handle low-frequency signals. The salient point here is that the LFE channel is not the &quot;subwoofer channel&quot;; there may be no subwoofer and, if there is, it may be handling a good deal more than effects.

Some record labels such as Telarc and Chesky have argued that LFE channels are not needed in a modern digital multichannel entertainment system. They argue that, given loudspeakers that have low-frequency response to 30 Hz, all available channels have a full-frequency range and, as such, there is no need for an LFE in surround music production, because all the frequencies are available in all the main channels. These labels sometimes use the LFE channel to carry a height channel. The label BIS Records generally uses a 5.0 channel mix.

== Channel notation ==
Channel notation indicates the number of discrete channels encoded in the audio signal, not necessarily the number of channels reproduced for playback. The number of playback channels can be increased by using matrix decoding. The number of playback channels may also differ from the number of speakers used to reproduce them if one or more channels drives a group of speakers. Notation represents the number of channels, not the number of speakers.

The first digit in &quot;5.1&quot; is the number of full-range channels. The &quot;.1&quot; reflects the limited frequency range of the LFE channel.

For example, two stereo speakers with no LFE channel = 2.0

5 full-range channels + 1 LFE channel = 5.1

An alternative notation shows the number of full-range channels in front of the listener, separated by a slash from the number of full-range channels beside or behind the listener, with a decimal point marking the number of limited-range LFE channels.

E.g. 3 front channels + 2 side channels + an LFE channel = 3/2.1

The notation can be expanded to include Matrix Decoders. Dolby Digital EX, for example, has a sixth full-range channel incorporated into the two rear channels with a matrix. This is expressed:

3 front channels + 2 rear channels + 3 channels reproduced in the rear in total + 1 LFE channel = 3/2:3.1

The term stereo, although popularised in reference to two channel audio, historically also referred to surround sound, as it strictly means &quot;solid&quot; (three-dimensional) sound. However this is no longer common usage and &quot;stereo sound&quot; almost exclusively means two channels, left and right.

=== Channel identification ===
In accordance with ANSI/CEA-863-A



=== Sonic Whole Overhead Sound ===
In 2002, Dolby premiered a master of &quot;We Were Soldiers&quot; which featured a Sonic Whole Overhead Sound soundtrack. This mix included a new ceiling-mounted height channel.

=== Ambisonics ===
Ambisonics is a recording and playback technique using multichannel mixing that can be used live or in the studio and which recreates the sound field as it existed in the space, in contrast to traditional surround systems, which can only create the illusion of the sound field if the listener is located in a very narrow sweet spot between speakers. Any number of speakers in any physical arrangement can be used to recreate a sound field. With 6 or more speakers arranged around a listener, a 3-dimensional (&quot;periphonic&quot;, or full-sphere) sound field can be presented. Ambisonics was invented by Michael Gerzon.

=== Binaural recording ===
Binaural recording is a method of recording sound that uses two microphones, arranged with the intent to create the 3-D stereo experience of being present in the room with the performers or instruments. The idea of a three dimensional or &quot;internal&quot; form of sound has developed into technology for stethoscopes creating &quot;in-head&quot; acoustics and IMAX movies creating a three dimensional acoustic experience.

=== Panor-Ambiophonic (PanAmbio) 4.0/4.1 ===
PanAmbio combines a stereo dipole and crosstalk cancellation in front and a second set behind the listener (total of four speakers) for 360° 2D surround reproduction. Four-channel recordings, especially those containing binaural cues, create speaker-binaural surround sound. 5.1 channel recordings, including movie DVDs, are compatible by mixing C-channel content to the front speaker pair. 6.1 can be played by mixing SC to the back pair.

=== Standard speaker channels ===
Several speaker configurations are commonly used for consumer equipment. The order and identifiers are those specified for the channel mask in the standard uncompressed WAV file format (which contains a raw multichannel PCM stream) and are used according to the same specification for most PC connectible digital sound hardware and PC operating systems capable of handling multiple channels. 

While it is possible to build any speaker configuration, there is little commercial movie or music content for alternative speaker configurations. However, source channels can be remixed for the speaker channels using a matrix table specifying how much of each content channel is played through each speaker channel.

Most channel configuration may include a LFE channel (the channel played through the subwoofer.) This makes the configuration &quot;.1&quot; instead of &quot;.0&quot;. Most modern multichannel mixes contain one LFE, some use two.


=== 7.1 surround sound ===
7.1 surround sound is a popular format in theaters &amp; Home cinema including Blu-rays with Dolby and DTS being major players.

=== 7.1.2/7.1.4 immersive sound ===
7.1.2 and 7.1.4 immersive sound along with 5.1.2 and 5.1.4 format adds either 2 or 4 overhead speakers to enable sound objects and special effect sounds to be panned overhead for the listener. Introduced for theatrical film releases in 2012 by Dolby Laboratories under the trademark name Dolby Atmos.

Dolby Atmos (and other Microsoft Spatial Sound engines; see in ) additionally support a virtual &quot;8.1.4.4&quot; configuration, to be rendered by a HRTF. The configuration adds to 7.1.4 with a center speaker behind the listener and 4 speakers below.

=== 10.2 surround sound ===
10.2 is the surround sound format developed by THX creator Tomlinson Holman of TMH Labs and University of Southern California (schools of Cinema/Television and Engineering). Developed along with Chris Kyriakakis of the USC Viterbi School of Engineering, &quot;10.2&quot; refers to the format&#x27;s promotional slogan: &quot;Twice as good as 5.1&quot;. Advocates of 10.2 argue that it is the audio equivalent of IMAX.

=== 11.1 surround sound ===
11.1 sound is supported by BARCO with installations in theaters worldwide.

=== 22.2 surround sound ===
22.2 is the surround sound component of Ultra High Definition Television, developed by NHK Science &amp; Technical Research Laboratories. As its name suggests, it uses 24 speakers. These are arranged in three layers: A middle layer of ten speakers, an upper layer of nine speakers, and a lower layer of three speakers and two sub-woofers. The system was demonstrated at Expo 2005, Aichi, Japan, the NAB Shows 2006 and 2009, Las Vegas, and the IBC trade shows 2006 and 2008, Amsterdam, Netherlands.

<text>During World War II, Operation Samwest (5–12 June 1944) was a large raid conducted by 116 Free French paratroops of the 4th Special Air Service Regiment. Their objective was to hinder movement of German troops from west Brittany to the Normandy beaches via ambush and sabotage attempts.

The first phase of the mission was to establish a secure base on the Breton Peninsula, near St. Brieuc in Duault in the Bretagne Region. Their base was heavily attacked by German troops on 12 June and they were forced to disperse.

<doc id="253838" wikidata="Q621328" url="?curid=253838" title="Apple ProDOS">
<text>ProDOS is the name of two similar operating systems for the Apple II of personal computer. The original ProDOS, renamed ProDOS 8 in version 1.2, is the last official operating system usable by all 8-bit Apple II computers, and was distributed from 1983 to 1993. The other, ProDOS 16, was a stop-gap solution for the 16-bit Apple II that was replaced by GS/OS within two years.

ProDOS was marketed by Apple as meaning Professional Disk Operating System, and became the most popular operating system for the Apple II 10 months after its release in January 1983.

==Background==
ProDOS was released to address shortcomings in the earlier Apple operating system (called simply DOS), which was beginning to show its age.

Apple DOS only has built-in support for 5.25&quot; floppy disks and requires patches to use peripheral devices such as hard disk drives and non-Disk-II floppy disk drives, including 3.5&quot; floppy drives. ProDOS adds a standard method of accessing ROM-based drivers on expansion cards for disk devices, expands the maximum volume size from about 400 kilobytes to 32 megabytes, introduces support for hierarchical subdirectories (a vital feature for organizing a hard disk&#x27;s storage space), and supports RAM disks on machines with 128 KB or more of memory. ProDOS addresses problems with handling hardware interrupts, and includes a well-defined and documented programming and expansion interface, which Apple DOS had always lacked. Although ProDOS also includes support for a real-time clock (RTC), this support went largely unused until the release of the Apple II, the first in the Apple II series to include an RTC on board. Third-party clocks were available for the II Plus, IIe, and IIc, however.

ProDOS, unlike earlier Apple DOS versions, has its developmental roots in SOS, the operating system for the ill-fated Apple III computer released in 1980. Pre-release documentation for ProDOS (including early editions of &quot;Beneath Apple ProDOS&quot;) documented SOS error codes, notably one for switched disks, that ProDOS itself could never generate. Its disk format and programming interface are completely different from those of Apple DOS, and ProDOS cannot read or write DOS 3.3 disks except by means of a conversion utility; while the low-level track-and-sector format of DOS 3.3 disks was retained for 5.25-inch disks, the high-level arrangement of files and directories is completely different. For this reason, most machine-language programs that run under Apple DOS will not work under ProDOS. However, most BASIC programs work, though they sometimes require minor changes. A third-party program called DOS.MASTER enables users to have multiple virtual DOS 3.3 partitions on a larger ProDOS volume.

With the release of ProDOS came the end of support for Integer BASIC and the original Apple II model, which had long since been effectively supplanted by Applesoft BASIC and the Apple II Plus. Whereas DOS 3.3 always loads built-in support for BASIC programming, under ProDOS this job is given to a separate system program called , which one launches to run and write Applesoft BASIC programs. BASIC itself continued to be built into the Apple ROMs; is merely a command interpreter enhancement that allows BASIC programs to access ProDOS by means of the same &quot;Control-D&quot; text output they had used under DOS 3.3. alone requires about as much memory as the whole of DOS 3.3. Since the ProDOS kernel itself is stowed away in the &quot;Language Card&quot; RAM, the usable amount of RAM for BASIC programmers remains the same under ProDOS as it had been under DOS 3.3.

Despite ProDOS&#x27;s many advantages, many users and programmers resisted it for a time because of their investment in learning the ins and outs of Apple DOS and in Apple-DOS-based software and data formats. A contributing reason was that ProDOS allows only 15 characters in a filename compared to Apple DOS&#x27;s 30. But Apple&#x27;s integrated software package AppleWorks, released in 1984, proved a compelling reason to switch, and by the end of 1985 few new software products were being released for the older operating system. Apple IIs continued to be able to boot the older DOS (even the Apple II can boot the older DOS floppies) but as 3.5&quot; floppies and hard disks became more prevalent, most users spent the bulk of their time in ProDOS.

The Apple IIe, also released in 1983, was the first Apple II computer to have 64 KB of memory built in. For a while, Apple shipped both DOS 3.3 and ProDOS with new computers.

The original ProDOS was renamed ProDOS 8 when ProDOS 16 was released to support the 16-bit Apple II computer, although ProDOS 16 (which was 8-bit at its core) was soon replaced by GS/OS.

==Requirements==
All editions of ProDOS require an Apple II or compatible.

ProDOS 8 requires 64 KB of memory to run. The original ProDOS (8) 1.0 through 1.0.2 requires only 48 KB for the kernel, but nearly all programs, including the needed to use Applesoft BASIC, require 64 KB, making a 48 KB system useless for ProDOS as a practical matter, and support for 48 KB machines was removed in version 1.1.

ProDOS 8 version 2.x requires a 65C02 or later (65802, 65816) CPU. ProDOS 8 2.x runs in 64 KB, but the utility programs on the system disk require 128 KB. Systems with a 6502 CPU instead of a 65C02 must use ProDOS 8 versions prior to version 2.0.

ProDOS 16 requires an Apple IIGS.

===Unlicensed Apple II clones===
With the release of ProDOS version 1.01 and higher, a check was added to see if it was running on an official Apple-manufactured computer. If the word &quot;Apple&quot; is found in the computer&#x27;s ROM firmware, ProDOS will load up as normal. If anything else is found (e.g. &quot;Golden&quot;, &quot;Franklin&quot;, &quot;Elite&quot;) ProDOS refuses to run, locking up at the boot splash screen. This measure was taken by Apple Computer to discourage use of unlicensed Apple II clones. It is still possible to run newer versions of ProDOS on clones by applying a small byte patch to a given version of ProDOS. Some users go as far as replacing their physical ROM chip(s) with an illegally copied version of Apple&#x27;s own ROM, or a custom patched ROM with &quot;Apple&quot; added in the name.

==Disk support==
ProDOS 8 natively supports Disk II-compatible floppy drives, a RAM drive of approximately 59 KB on computers having 128 KB or more RAM, and block devices whose controllers support the Pascal firmware protocol, a standardized method of accepting block reads and writes originally introduced for use with the UCSD p-System. This latter category includes 3.5&quot; floppy drives and hard drives. Custom block device drivers can be hooked into the OS as well.

==File system==
ProDOS uses the same file system as the earlier Apple SOS for the Apple III. The SOS/ProDOS file system is native to Apple SOS, ProDOS 8, ProDOS 16, and GS/OS. Some classic Mac OS versions also come with a file system translator to handle this file system.

A volume is allocated in 512-byte blocks. (5.25&quot; floppy disks are still formatted using 256-byte sectors, as this is the format required by the controller ROM to boot the disk. ProDOS simply treats pairs of 256-byte sectors as a single block on such drives.) A volume can have a capacity of up to 32 megabytes, and each file can be up to 16 megabytes. Each volume (floppy disk or hard drive partition) has a &quot;volume name&quot;, a filename which is used as the base directory name; having two volumes with the same volume name can result in conflicts. If necessary, ProDOS searches all available drives to find a named volume. Subdirectories are supported, and the concept of a &quot;prefix&quot; (working directory or current path) was provided to make working with subdirectories easier.

File, directory, and volume names can be 1 to 15 characters, starting with a letter, then containing more letters, digits or periods. Each file entry also contains the 16-bit (2-byte) pointer to the block containing the beginning of the file (or its block index); a 16-bit block count; a 24-bit (3-byte) file size; an 8-bit (1-byte) filetype; a 16-bit auxiliary type (the meaning of which depends upon the filetype); creation and modification timestamps; and data related to how the file is stored on the volume. Sparse files are supported, but files are never &quot;sparsified&quot; by removing zero-filled blocks. The volume header contains similar information as relevant to volumes.

Directories (including the root directory) are sequentially indexed, with each block starting with the address of the previous block (or zero if none) and the subsequent block (or zero if none). The root directory on most disks is initialized to 4 blocks, allowing 51 entries (excluding the volume header). It never changes in size, except by manual intervention with special tools. Subdirectories begin at one block, and grow automatically as needed.

Normal files are progressively indexed. Single-block files (under 513 bytes) have no index block; the directory entry points directly to the block of file data. Files with between 2 and 256 blocks (513 bytes to 128 KB) of data have a single index block, to which the directory entry points, which contains a list of up to 256 data block addresses. Larger files have a master index block containing a list of up to 256 index block addresses. When the Apple IIgs was introduced, a new storage format was introduced for files with two forks, as was typical for IIgs system and program files; the directory entry points to an informational block that tells the computer the storage format of the two forks. These files cannot be read or written natively by ProDOS 8, though the volume itself remains compatible.

The volume has a bitmap of used blocks. Other than this, there is no central file allocation table.

A ProDOS 8 volume formatted by Apple&#x27;s tools has a boot sector that supports booting both ProDOS and SOS depending on what computer it is booted on. Block 0 is the Apple II boot block and block 1 boots SOS. This allows a disk to be used to boot on either Apple II or Apple III computers by putting both operating system kernels in the top directory: the Apple II boot sector looks for the file and the Apple III boot sector looks for the file . Third-party formatting utilities often did not provide the SOS boot block, and some would even mark block 1 available for user data.

ProDOS has no kernel support for other file systems. If necessary, a conversion utility on the main system disk is used to transfer files individually between ProDOS and older Apple DOS 3.3 disks. Because they use a different low-level disk format than DOS 3.3 and ProDOS, transferring data from DOS 3.2 disks to ProDOS is a two-step process using a DOS 3.3 disk as an intermediary (utilizing the DOS 3.3 utility MUFFIN or similar).

<text>Operation Cooney was the deployment of elements of the 4ème Bataillon d&#x27;Infanterie de l&#x27;Air - the 4th Free French Parachute Battalion (later renamed &quot;2ème Régiment de Chasseurs Parachutistes&quot;) - also known as 4th Special Air Service.

On 7 June 1944, the 9 aircraft of 38 Group (including two from No. 297 Squadron RAF), dropped the parachutists.

These men were to disrupt enemy communications between West Brittany and the remainder of France, and in all 58 Free French soldiers were dropped on no fewer than 18 undefended drop zones between St. Malo and Vannes. Their goal was to impair the German Army&#x27;s response to the unfolding invasion of Normandy, Operation Overlord.

Breaking into 18 three-man or five-man SAS teams, the commandos scattered throughout Brittany destroying railroad targets. As a sign they had passed through they tied railroad ties around trees.

Some raiders then joined the base established by the Dingson team in Saint-Marcel, Morbihan or the base established by the Samwest team in Duault, Côtes d&#x27;Armor.

<text>A bus station or a bus interchange is a structure where city buses or intercity buses stop to pick up and drop off passengers. While the term bus depot can also be used to refer to a bus station, it can also refer to a bus garage. A bus station is larger than a bus stop, which is usually simply a place on the roadside, where buses can stop. It may be intended as a terminal station for a number of routes, or as a transfer station where the routes continue.

Bus station platforms may be assigned to fixed bus lines, or variable in combination with a dynamic passenger information system. The latter requires fewer platforms, but does not provide consistent locations for passengers.

==Largest bus stations==
Kilambakkam bus terminus in Chennai is spread over an area of , making it the largest bus station in the world.
The Woodlands Bus Interchange in Singapore is one of the busiest bus interchanges in the world, handling up to 400,000 passengers daily across 42 bus services. Other Singaporean bus interchanges such as Bedok Bus Interchange, Tampines Bus Interchange and Yishun Bus Interchange handle similar number of passengers daily.

The largest underground bus station in Europe is Kamppi Centre in Helsinki, Finland completed in 2006. The terminal cost 100 million Euro to complete and took 3 years to design and build. Today, the bus terminal, which covers 25,000 square meters, is the busiest bus terminal in Finland. Every day, the terminal has around 700 bus departures, transporting approximately 170,000 passengers.

Preston Bus Station in Preston, England, built in 1969 and later heritage-listed, was described in 2014 as &quot;depending on how you measure it, the largest bus station in the world, the second-biggest in Europe, and the longest in Europe&quot;. It was fully refurbished in 2018.

The largest bus terminal in North America is the Port Authority Bus Terminal located in New York City. The terminal is located in Midtown at 625 Eighth Avenue between 40th Street and 42nd Street, one block east of the Lincoln Tunnel and one block west of Times Square. The terminal is the largest in the Western Hemisphere and the busiest in the world by volume of traffic, serving about 8,000 buses and 225,000 people on an average weekday and more than 65 million people a year. It has 223 gates. It operates intercity bus routes all over the United States and some routes with international destinations, mostly in Canada, and mostly operated by Greyhound Lines.

The largest bus terminal in the southern hemisphere is the Tietê Bus Terminal located in São Paulo, Brazil. It is also the 2nd busiest in the world, serving about 90,000 people per weekday in 300 bus lines on its 89 platforms (72 for boarding and 17 for deboarding), with services to over 1,000 cities over the country and South America. The terminal is also linked to Portuguesa-Tietê, an adjacent metro station.

<text>The board foot or board-foot is a unit of measurement for the volume of lumber in the United States and Canada. It equals the volume of a board that is in length, one foot in width, and in thickness, or exactly liters.
Board foot can be abbreviated as FBM (for &quot;foot, board measure&quot;), BDFT, or BF. A thousand board feet can be abbreviated as MFBM, MBFT, or MBF. Similarly, a million board feet can be abbreviated as MMFBM, MMBFT, or MMBF.

Until the 1970s, in Australia and New Zealand, the terms super foot and superficial foot were used with the same meaning.

==Description==
One board foot equals:

The board foot is used to measure rough lumber (before drying and planing with no adjustments) or planed/surfaced lumber. An example of planed lumber is softwood &quot;two by four&quot; lumber sold by large lumber retailers, nominally . The 2 × 4 is actually only , but the dimensions for the lumber when purchased wholesale could still be represented as full 2 × 4 lumber, although the &quot;standard&quot; can vary between vendors. This means that nominal lumber includes air space around the physical board when calculating board feet in some situations, while the true measurement of &quot;board feet&quot; should be limited to the actual dimensions of the board.

For planed lumber, board feet refer to the nominal thickness and width of lumber, calculated in principle on its size before drying and planing. Here, the actual length is used.

Note: see dimensional lumber for a full discussion of the relationship of actual and nominal dimensions. Briefly, for softwoods, to convert nominal to actual, subtract for dimensions under 2 inches; subtract for dimensions over 2 inches and under 8 inches; and subtract for larger measurements. The system is more complicated for hardwoods.

<text>Apple DOS is the disk operating system for the Apple II computers from late 1978 through early 1983. It was superseded by ProDOS in 1983. Apple DOS has three major releases: DOS 3.1, DOS 3.2, and DOS 3.3; each one of these three releases was followed by a second, minor &quot;bug-fix&quot; release, but only in the case of Apple DOS 3.2 did that minor release receive its own version number, Apple DOS 3.2.1. The best-known and most-used version is Apple DOS 3.3 in the 1980 and 1983 releases. Prior to the release of Apple DOS 3.1, Apple users had to rely on audio cassette tapes for data storage and retrieval.

==Version history==
When Apple Computer introduced the Apple II in April 1977, the new computer had no disk drive or disk operating system (DOS). Although Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak designed the Disk II controller late that year, and believed that he could have written a DOS, his co-founder Steve Jobs decided to outsource the task. The company considered using Digital Research&#x27;s CP/M, but Wozniak sought an operating system that was easier to use. On 10 April 1978 Apple signed a $13,000 contract with Shepardson Microsystems to write a DOS and deliver it within 35 days. Apple provided detailed specifications, and early Apple employee Randy Wigginton worked closely with Shepardson&#x27;s Paul Laughton as the latter wrote the operating system with punched cards and a minicomputer.

There was no Apple DOS 1 or 2. Versions 0.1 through 2.8 were serially enumerated revisions during development, which might as well have been called builds 1 through 28. Apple DOS 3.0, a renamed issue of version 2.8, was never publicly released due to bugs. Apple published no official documentation until release 3.2.

Apple DOS 3.1 was publicly released in June 1978, slightly more than one year after the Apple II was introduced, becoming the first disk-based operating system for any Apple computer. A bug-fix release came later, addressing a problem by means of its utility, which was used to create Apple DOS master (bootable) disks: The built-in command created disks that could be booted only on machines with at least the same amount of memory as the one that had created them. includes a self-relocating version of DOS that boots on Apples with any memory configuration.

Apple DOS 3.2 was released in 1979 to reflect changes in computer booting methods that were built into the successor of the Apple II, the Apple II Plus. New firmware included an auto-start feature which automatically found a disk controller and booted from it when the system was powered up—earning it the name &quot;Autostart ROM&quot;. DOS 3.2.1 was then released in July 1979 with some minor bug fixes.

Apple DOS 3.3 was released in 1980. It improves various functions of release 3.2 including a rewrite of the RWTS to make it faster, while allowing for large gains in available floppy disk storage. The newer P5A/P6A PROMs in the disk controller enable the reading and writing of data at a higher density, so 16 sectors (4 KiB) can be stored per track instead of 13 sectors (3.25 KiB), increasing capacity from 113.75 KB to 140 KB per side 16 KB of which is used by filesystem overhead and a copy of DOS, leaving 124 KB for user programs and data. DOS 3.3 is, however, not backward compatible; it cannot read or write DOS 3.2 disks. To address this problem, Apple Computer released &quot;MUFFIN&quot;, a utility to migrate Apple DOS 3.2 files and programs to version 3.3 disks. Apple never offered a utility to copy in the other direction. To migrate Apple DOS 3.3 files back to version 3.2 disks, someone wrote a &quot;NIFFUM&quot; utility. There are also commercial utilities (such as &quot;Copy II Plus&quot;) that can copy files between either format (and eventually ProDOS as well). Release 3.3 also improves the ability to switch between Integer BASIC and Applesoft BASIC, if the computer has a language card (RAM expansion) or firmware card.

==Technical details==
Apple DOS 3.1 disks use 13 sectors of data per track, each sector being 256 bytes. It uses 35 tracks per disk side, and can access only one side of the floppy disk, unless the user flipped the disk over. This gives the user a total storage capacity of 113.75 KB per side, of which about 10 KB are used to store DOS itself and the disk directory, leaving about 100 KB for user programs.

The first layer of the operating system is called RWTS, which stands for &quot;read/write track sector&quot;. This layer consists of subroutines for track seeking, sector reading and writing, and disk formatting. An API called the File Manager was built on top of this, and implements functions to open, close, read, write, delete, lock (i.e. write-protect), unlock (i.e. write-enable), and rename files, and to verify a file&#x27;s structural integrity. There is also a function, for listing files on the diskette, and an function, which formats a disk for use with DOS, storing a copy of DOS on the first three tracks, and storing a startup program (usually called HELLO) that is auto-started when this disk is booted from. On top of the File Manager API, the main DOS routines are implemented which hook into the machine&#x27;s BASIC interpreter and intercept all disk commands. It provides BLOAD, BSAVE, and BRUN for storing, loading, and running binary executables. , , and are provided for BASIC programs, and an was provided for running text-based batch files consisting of BASIC and DOS commands. Finally, four types of files exist, identified by letters in a catalog listing:
* I – Integer BASIC programs (stored in a compact format, not plain-text)
* A – Applesoft BASIC programs (also stored in a packed, space-saving format)
* B – Binary files, either executable machine-language programs, or data files
* T – ASCII text files (or plain-text, unpacked batch files)

There are four additional file types; &quot;R&quot;, &quot;S&quot;, and an additional &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, none of which are fully supported. DOS recognizes these types for catalog listings only, and there are no direct ways to manipulate these types of files. The &quot;R&quot; type found some use for relocatable binary executable files. A few programs support the &quot;S&quot; type as data files.

A call vector table in the region of $03D0–03FF allows programs to find DOS wherever it is loaded in the system memory. For example, if the DOS hooked into the BASIC CLI stops functioning, it can be reinitialized by calling location $03D0 (976) hence the traditional (&quot;3D0 go&quot;) command to return to BASIC from the System Monitor.

===Boot loader===
The process of loading Apple DOS involves a series of very tiny programs, each of which carries the loading process forward a few steps before passing control to the next program in the chain.

*Originally, the Apple II ROM did not support disk booting at all. At power-up it would display the System Monitor prompt. Both the Monitor and Integer BASIC have commands to redirect printing to a printer driver in a designated slot, so the conventional way to boot from disk then was to command the computer to start &quot;printing&quot; to the disk interface card, typically installed in slot 6, using the command (from the ML monitor) or (from BASIC). When the monitor or BASIC issued the next prompt character, the computer would call the ROM routines on the disk card to &quot;print&quot; to it, which would then proceed with the boot sequence. (One could use input redirection to similar ends.) Alternatively, from the ML monitor, the user could invoke the controller&#x27;s boot code directly with a command like . 
*When the Apple II Plus was introduced, it included the ability to scan each expansion slot (working downward from slot 7 to slot 1) for a bootable expansion card ROM, and automatically call it.
*The expansion card ROM boot code attempts to boot from drive 1 of the controller by moving the read/write arm to track zero and attempting to read 256 bytes from sector zero of that track. (If no readable disk is available, the drive spins indefinitely until one is provided and the drive door is closed.)
*Sector zero contains a small program which instructs the computer to read sectors 0 through 9 of track zero into memory using part of the ROM boot code (rereading sector 0 in the process).
*The program in sectors 1–9 of track 0, including the complete RWTS code, then proceeds to load tracks 1 and 2, which contain the rest of DOS. On a system master disk, code is also included to determine the computer&#x27;s RAM configuration and relocate DOS as high into system memory as possible, up to the 48 KB limit of the Apple II&#x27;s main memory ($BFFF).
*Once DOS is loaded into memory, it attempts to load and execute a startup program as indicated in the DOS program code. This is commonly a BASIC language program named &quot;HELLO&quot; (or some other name) but DOS can be modified to run other types of programs at startup, such as an executable binary file. The appearance of the right-hand bracket (]) on the screen is an indication to the user that an Applesoft BASIC startup program is loading, while a greater-than symbol (&gt;) indicates that an Integer BASIC program is loading. (These are the prompts for the respective versions of BASIC, which are being initialized at this point.)
*The startup program then begins executing.

===Integer BASIC and Applesoft BASIC support===
The original Apple II included BASIC interpreter in ROM known originally as &quot;Apple BASIC&quot; and later as &quot;Integer BASIC&quot;. Variables in this language can only handle integer numbers ranging from −32,768 to +32,767 (16-bit binary values); floating point numbers are not supported. Apple commissioned Microsoft to develop Applesoft BASIC, capable of handling floating-point numbers. Applesoft BASIC cannot run Integer BASIC programs, causing some users to resist upgrading to it.

DOS 3.3 was released when Applesoft BASIC was standard in ROM on the Apple II Plus, so Apple designed it to support switching back and forth between the two BASIC interpreters. Integer BASIC is loaded into RAM on the language card of Apple IIs (if present) and by typing or from BASIC, the user can switch between either version.

==Decline==
After 1980, Apple DOS entered into a state of stagnation as Apple concentrated its efforts on the ill-fated Apple III computer and its SOS operating system. Two more versions of Apple DOS, both still called DOS 3.3 but with some bug fixes and better support for the new Apple IIe model, were released in early and mid-1983.

Without third-party patches, Apple DOS can only read floppy disks running in a 5.25-inch Disk II drive and cannot access any other media, such as hard disk drives, virtual RAM drives, or 3.5-inch floppy disk drives. The structure of Apple DOS disks (particularly the free sector map, which was restricted to part of a single sector) is such that it is not possible to have more than 400 KB available at a time per drive without a major rewrite of almost all sections of the code; this is the main reason Apple abandoned this iteration of DOS in 1983, when Apple DOS was entirely replaced by ProDOS.

ProDOS retains the 16-sector low-level format of DOS 3.3 for 5.25 inch disks, but introduces a new high-level format that is suitable for devices of up to 32 MB; this makes it suitable for hard disks from that era and 3.5-inch floppies. All the Apple computers from the II Plus onward can run both DOS 3.3 and ProDOS, the Plus requiring a &quot;Language Card&quot; memory expansion to use ProDOS; the e and later models have built-in Language Card hardware, and so can run ProDOS straight. ProDOS includes software to copy files from Apple DOS disks. However, many people who had no need for the improvements of ProDOS (and who did not like its much higher memory footprint) continued using Apple DOS or one of its clones long after 1983. The Apple convention of storing a bootable OS on every single floppy disk means that commercial software can be used no matter what OS the user owns. A program called DOS.MASTER enables users to have multiple virtual DOS 3.3 partitions on a larger ProDOS volume, which allows the use of many floppy-based DOS programs with a hard disk.

Shortly after ProDOS came out, Apple withdrew permission from third parties to redistribute DOS 3.3, but granted one company, Syndicomm, an exclusive license to resell DOS 3.3.

Commercial games usually did not use Apple DOS, instead having their own custom disk routines for copy protection purposes as well as for performance.

==Performance improvements==
DOS&#x27;s RWTS routine can read or write a track in two revolutions with proper interleaving. A sector of the spinning disk passes under the read/write head while the RWTS routine is decoding the just-read sector (or encoding the next one to be written), and if this missed sector is the next one needed, DOS needs to wait nearly an entire revolution of the disk for the sector to come around again. This is called &quot;blowing a rev&quot; and is a well-understood performance bottleneck in disk systems. To avoid this, the sectors on a DOS disk are arranged in an interleaved order:

 0 7 e 6 d 5 c 4 b 3 a 2 9 1 8 f

Later, ProDOS arranged the sectors in this order:

 0 8 1 9 2 a 3 b 4 c 5 d 6 e 7 f

When reading and decoding sector 0, then sector 8 passes by, so that sector 1, the next sector likely to be needed, will be available without waiting. When reading sector 7, two unneeded sectors, f and 0, pass by before sector 8 is available, and when reading sector 15, the drive will always have to wait an extra revolution for sector 0 on the same track. However, the sector 0 actually needed in most cases will be on the next-higher track, and that track can be arranged relative to the last one to allow the needed time to decode the just-read sector and move the head before sector 0 comes around. On average, a full track can be read in two revolutions of the disk.

The early DOS File Manager subverted this efficiency by copying bytes read from or written to a file one at a time between a disk buffer and main memory, requiring more time and resulting in DOS constantly blowing revs when reading or writing files. Programs became available early on to format disks with modified sector interleaves; these disks give DOS more time between sectors to copy the data, ameliorating the problem.

Later, programmers outside Apple rewrote the File Manager routines to avoid making the extra copy for most sectors of a file; RWTS was instructed to read or write sectors directly to or from main memory rather than from a disk buffer whenever a full sector was to be transferred. An early patch to provide this functionality was published in &quot;Call-A.P.P.L.E.&quot;. Speedups in the command of three to five times were typical.

This functionality soon appeared in commercial products, such as Pronto-DOS, Diversi-DOS, Hyper-DOS, and David-DOS, along with additional features, but it was never used in an official Apple DOS release. Similar functionality was, however, employed by Apple&#x27;s successor operating system, ProDOS. The Apple IIGS-specific operating system GS/OS would eventually employ an even more efficient &quot;scatter read&quot; technique that would read any sector that happened to be passing under the read head if it was needed for the file being read.

==Source code release==
In 2013, more than 35 years after the Apple II debuted, the original Apple DOS source code was released by the Computer History Museum on its website. It was donated by the original author, Paul Laughton.
