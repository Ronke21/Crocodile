<text>Bizarro () is a supervillain or anti-hero appearing in American comic books published by DC Comics. The character was created by writer Otto Binder and artist George Papp as a &quot;mirror image&quot; of Superman, and first appeared in &quot;Superboy&quot; #68 (1958). Debuting in the Silver Age of Comic Books (1956 – c. 1970), the character has often been portrayed as an antagonist to Superman, though on occasion he also takes on an antihero role.

In addition to appearing in the company&#x27;s publications, he has also appeared in adapted media and tie-in products, such as animated and live-action television series, trading cards, toys, and video games.

==Publication history==
Bizarro debuted in &quot;Superboy&quot; No. 68 (published in August; cover-dated October 1958), writer Otto Binder casting the character as a Frankenstein&#x27;s monster pastiche that possessed all the powers of Superboy. Shunned for his unenviable appearance, the teen version of Bizarro only appeared in a single comic book story. An adult version appeared around the same time in the Superman daily newspaper comic strip written by Alvin Schwartz, debuting in Episode 105: &quot;The Battle With Bizarro&quot; (strips 6147–6242: August 25, 1958 to December 13, 1958). According to comics historian Mark Evanier, Schwartz long claimed that he originated the Bizarro concept prior to the character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Superboy&quot;. The newspaper version wore a &quot;B&quot; on his chest, as opposed to Superman&#x27;s distinctive &quot;S&quot;.

Schwartz stated: 
Binder introduced the adult version of the character into the Superman comic book, this time wearing an &quot;S&quot;, in &quot;Action Comics&quot; #254 (July 1959). Bizarro proved popular, and eventually starred in a Bizarro World feature in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; for 15 issues, running from issue #285–299 (June 1961 – August 1962), as well as in a special all-Bizarro 80-Page Giant (&quot;Superman&quot; #202, December 1967/January 1968). The character made forty appearances in the Superman family of titles&quot;Action Comics&quot;, &quot;Superman&quot;, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Pal Jimmy Olsen&quot;, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Girl Friend, Lois Lane&quot;, &quot;Adventure Comics&quot;, &quot;Secret Society of Super Villains&quot;, and &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot;from 1959 to 1984, prior to a reboot of the DC Universe, as a result of the limited series &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot; #1–12 (April 1985 – March 1986).

Bizarro was reintroduced into the DC Universe in a one-off appearance with characterization similar to his original &quot;Superboy&quot; appearance in &quot;Superman: The Man of Steel&quot; #5 (December 1986). He was later revived in the &quot;Bizarro&#x27;s World&quot; serial that ran through the &quot;Superman&quot; titles in March and April 1994, and in &quot;Action Comics Annual&quot; #8 in 1996. In 1997, Bizarro appeared in , wearing a purple version of Superman’s costume which has become Bizarro’s usual outfit in the comics. An unrelated four-issue limited series titled &quot;A. Bizarro&quot; (July–October) was published in 1999.

Yet another version was introduced during the &quot;Emperor Joker&quot; storyline that ran in September and October 2000. Remaining in DC Comics continuity, this Bizarro continued to make semi-regular guest appearances that firmly established the character as part of the Superman mythos.

==Fictional character biography==
===Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; Bizarro===
====General Zod&#x27;s Bizarro Army====
General Dru-Zod had originally created bizarro duplicates of himself to dominate the planet Krypton. The Bizarros had no power because they were not under a yellow sun, but they were soldiers ready to kill and die without hesitation. This was the reason why Zod was banished to the Phantom Zone for 25 Krypton sun-cycles.

====Bizarro-Superboy====
Some 12 years later, totally oblivious to these facts, a scientist on Earth is demonstrating his newly invented &quot;duplicating ray&quot; to Superboy, and an accident causes the ray to duplicate the superhero. The copy, quickly labeled &quot;Bizarro&quot;, is a flawed imitation as it possesses chalky white skin and childlike erratic behavior. Shunned by the people of Smallville, Bizarro befriends a blind girl named Melissa, and loses all hope when he realizes that the girl did not shun or flee from him because she was blind. Superboy is eventually forced to &quot;kill&quot; the &quot;less than perfect&quot; clone, using the remains of the duplicating machine, which acts like blue kryptonite (as opposed to green kryptonite, Superboy&#x27;s weakness). The whole business proved unexpectedly easy as Bizarro deliberately destroyed himself by colliding with the duplicating machine&#x27;s fragment. The ensuing explosion miraculously restores Melissa&#x27;s eyesight.

====Bizarro #1====
Years afterward, Superman&#x27;s arch-foe Lex Luthor recreates the &quot;duplicating ray&quot; and uses it on the hero, hoping to control the duplicate that became known as Bizarro #1. The Bizarro that is created, however, is confused, stating: &quot;Me not human... me not creature... me not even animal! Me unhappy! Me don&#x27;t belong in world of living people! Me don&#x27;t know difference between right and wronggood and evil!&quot; Luthor is arrested by Bizarro for re-creating him, but forgotten as Bizarro attempts to emulate Superman, creating havoc in the city of Metropolis and almost exposing Superman&#x27;s secret identity as Clark Kent. When Bizarro falls in love with reporter Lois Lane, she uses the duplicating ray on herself to create a &quot;Bizarro Lois&quot;, who is instantly attracted to Bizarro. In addition, he also used the duplicating ray on himself to create &quot;New Bizarro&quot; who later dies from exposure to green kryptonite. The Bizarros leave Earth together, determined to find a home where they can be themselves.

Superman encounters the couple once again, discovering that Bizarronow called Bizarro #1has used a version of the duplication ray to create an entire world of Bizarros, who now reside on a cube-shaped planet called &quot;Htrae&quot; (Earth spelled backwards). Bizarro #1 and Bizarro-Lois #1 also give birth to a child who, while super-powered, appears to be totally human. Considered a freak by Bizarro standards (out of resentment for the way that he was treated by Earth humans, Bizarro #1 made a law named the Bizarro Code that decrees that they must act the opposite of humans, causing no end of lunacy), the child is the catalyst for a brief war between Htrae and Earth. Blue kryptonite is also invented during this war, as well as the temporary existence of Bizarro-Supergirl. Bizarro also has a series of adventures on Htrae, aiding a normal Jimmy Olsen when he is accidentally trapped there, preventing an invasion of blue kryptonite statues, and stopping the Bizarro version of Titano.

Bizarro&#x27;s influence is also felt on Earth: Jimmy Olsen is inadvertently turned into a Bizarro for a while, and a new teen version of Bizarro travels to the 30th century and attempts to join the Legion of Super-Heroes. When he is rejected by the Legion, the Bizarro teen creates his own Bizarro version of the Legion, which Superboy eventually persuades him to disband.

When Bizarro encounters Superman once again, his powers are now the opposite of Superman&#x27;s (such as freeze vision as opposed to heat vision and heat breath rather than freeze breath), and he attempts to kidnap Lois Lane. Bizarro also temporarily joins the Secret Society of Super Villains to battle the Justice League of America and Captain Comet.

Bizarro appears in the Alan Moore-scripted &quot;&quot;, in &quot;Superman&quot; #423 (September 1986). Bizarro goes berserk and destroys the Bizarro World and all of its inhabitants, then travels to Metropolis and wreaks havoc before abruptly committing suicide. This and many other deaths turn out to be the machinations of Mister Mxyzptlk, who had become evil and begun a rampage of crime. Superman is unable to undo the deaths, but kills Mxyzptlk and then uses gold kryptonite on himself to remove his super-powers permanently.

Bizarro&#x27;s final Pre-&quot;Crisis&quot; appearance was in &quot;DC Comics Presents&quot; #97 (September 1986), which was also the final issue of that series. After being empowered by a Phantom Zone sorcerer, Mr. Mxyzptlk destroys Zrfff and causes the Bizarro World to implode, killing all of its inhabitants. Bizarro&#x27;s severed head crashes onto Clark Kent&#x27;s desk and addresses Clark before his simulated life ends. Bizarro does not appear in &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, apparently because of this story&#x27;s events.

This story directly contradicts a &quot;World&#x27;s Finest&quot; story where it is revealed that sometime in the future, Htrae is transformed into a more normal world (egg-shaped rather than cubical) by the radiation from an exploding celestial body. The Bizarros are changed into normal people without super-powers, but still retain vestiges of their Bizarro Code (curtains hung outside the windows of a house, etc.).

===Post-&quot;Crisis&quot; Bizarro===
====Project Changeling====
After the events of &quot;Crisis on Infinite Earths&quot;, Lex Luthor orders his scientific team to create a clone of Superman that was part of &quot;Project Changeling&quot;. Incorrectly starting from the assumption that Superman is a human with metahuman abilities (his alien origin had not yet been revealed), the process results in a flawed copy, which Luthor dismissively refers to as &quot;...this bizarreOh, forget it&quot;, before ordering for the subject to be disposed of. The clone survives and, although mute and possessed of only limited intelligence and vague memories of Clark Kent&#x27;s life, attempts to mimic Superman. He kidnaps Lois Lane and is finally destroyed when colliding with Superman in mid-air. Each time he exerted himself, the clone crumbled slightly. When Lois Lane&#x27;s sister, who had been blinded in a terrorist attack, is exposed to Bizarro&#x27;s dust, she regains her sight. While Superman had not expected this effect, he speculated that Bizarro heard the sister explain her partial recovery and may have deliberately allowed himself to be killed to cure her.

====Bizarro II====
A second Bizarro, able to speak and think better due to genetic engineering by Luthor, appears in a 5-issue substory in the clone plague story-arc titled &quot;Bizarro&#x27;s World&quot; (beginning in &quot;Superman&quot; (vol. 2) #87). Before he died, this Bizarro seriously injured Dr. Sydney Happersen, kidnapped Lois, created a ramshackle dummy version of Metropolis in a warehouse (to parody Superman&#x27;s frequently rescuing Lois, he deliberately exposed her to and &quot;rescued&quot; her from one lethal danger after another), abducted Lana Lang, proposed to Lois and finally died in Luthor&#x27;s labs. During this period, Superman also had to cope with an unending increase in his powers due to exposure to &quot;purple kryptonite&quot; in the climax of the Death of Superman and Reign of the Supermen story-arcs.

====Match====
====Project Cadmus/S-01====
S-01 coined &quot;Bizarre-O&quot; is the first of Paul Westfield&#x27;s attempts to clone a new Superman by him during the storyline &quot;Fall of Metropolis&quot;. Known as the thirteenth and only success of Westfield&#x27;s project Superboy was recalled to Cadmus to discuss the new information uncovered regarding his own origin. While the Cadmus directors and Dr. Packard discussed what went wrong with S-01 and Westfield&#x27;s secrecy on the project Scrapper unknowingly leaned on the control panel for S-01&#x27;s stasis pod causing him to be released. After breaking free of his stasis pod S-01 rapidly started deteriorating with his skin almost immediately taking on the chalky hue and ridged texture of other Bizarros.

====Dabney Donovan&#x27;s Bizarro====
One other Bizarro is created using Lex Luthor&#x27;s clone process, by Lex Luthor&#x27;s estranged wife Contessa Portenza and Dabney Donovan shortly after Superman regained his normal powers when he expended his electromagnetic ones. This Bizarro abducted Lex Luthor&#x27;s baby daughter and intended to send her by rocket to another planet, emulating Kal-El&#x27;s escape from Krypton. His pile of explosives and bombs, meant to launch the rocket, would have killed her instead, and Superman had to shield her when Bizarro threw the launch switch. Bizarro III, already self-destructing from a genetic booby trap encoded into him by his creator, perished in the explosion.

====Joker&#x27;s Bizarro/Bizarro #1====
Another version of Bizarro possesses all the abilities of Superman but with a childlike mentality and method of speech. He is created by Batman&#x27;s arch-enemy the Joker when the villain steals the powers of Mister Mxyzptlk. Creating a twisted version of Earth called &quot;Jokerworld&quot;a perfect cube with the Joker&#x27;s image on each facetthe villain designates Bizarro to be the planet&#x27;s greatest hero and leader of a reimagined &quot;JLA&quot; (the &quot;Joker&#x27;s League of Anarchy&quot;). When Mxyzptlk regains his powers, the imp allows Bizarro and several other beings to remain on the restored Earth.

Bizarro suffers a setback when captured by the Pokolistanian dictator General Zod. Zod beats and tortures Bizarro, simply because the creature resembles Superman. The hero rescues Bizarro, and to help him adjust to the normal Earth rebuilds Bizarro&#x27;s &quot;Graveyard of Solitude&quot; (the opposite of Superman&#x27;s Fortress of Solitude).

In &quot;Infinite Crisis&quot;, Bizarro is tricked into joining the reformed Secret Society of Super Villains by the Flash&#x27;s foe Zoom. In a battle with the Freedom Fighters Bizarro accidentally kills the Human Bomb, repeatedly hitting the hero to see the flashes of light that are produced from the kinetic energy of the blows.

Bizarro becomes involved when Kryptonian criminals, led by General Zod, escape to Earth. Wishing to create a home for himself, Bizarro travels into deep space to a solar system occupied by a blue sun. After creating a cube-shaped planet, filled with distorted versions of various buildings and locations on Earth, Bizarro is still lonely. The blue sun, however, gives Bizarro a new ability called &quot;Bizarro Vision&quot;, which allows him to create new Bizarros. When this fails, Bizarro kidnaps Jonathan Kent, Superman&#x27;s adopted father on Earth. Superman rescues his father and helps Bizarro become his world&#x27;s greatest hero.

Bizarro eventually appears on the planet Throneworld, befriending and aiding Earth hero Adam Strange and allies Prince Gavyn, Captain Comet, and Weird. Together they participate in the war between Rann and Thanagar, and against villains Lady Styx and Synnar. Bizarro eventually visits the grave of a deceased Jonathan Kent, and is then sent (by rogue Kryptonians) with other Superman foes to the inter-dimensional prison, the Phantom Zone.

Bizarro has a series of encounters with former Secret Society ally Solomon Grundy, and during the events of &quot;Blackest Night&quot;, Bizarro confronts the Black Lantern version of Grundy. Bizarro destroys Grundy by driving him into the Sun.

Later, while investigating an object that crashes into a Metropolis park and leaves a massive crystallized crater in its center, Doctor Light and Gangbuster discover a Bizarro-like creature that resembles Supergirl. The Bizarro Supergirl takes the heroes hostage, but is defeated in battle by the real Supergirl. It is revealed that the Bizarro Supergirl is a refugee from the cube-shaped Bizarro World, and was sent to Earth by her cousin after their planet was attacked by a being known as the Godship. Dr. Light attempts to take the Bizarro Supergirl to S.T.A.R. Labs, only to be violently knocked unconscious by Supergirl, who then absconds with her doppelgänger and her ship, hoping to stop the Godship and save the Bizarro World. After taking Bizarro Supergirl back to the Bizarro World, Bizarro Superman is reunited with Bizarro Supergirl.

===&quot;The New 52&quot;===
In 2011, &quot;The New 52&quot; rebooted the DC Universe. Two versions of Bizarro first appear in the &quot;Forever Evil&quot; event.

====Subject A-0====
Five years ago, Lex Luthor, intending to create his personal army of Supermen, attempted to splice Superman&#x27;s DNA with human DNA and injected it into a teenage test subject named Bobby. Instead, he transforms into a hulking white-skinned monster with cryonic vision, incendiary breath, and immunity to Kryptonite which is labeled &quot;Subject A-0&quot;. Deducing his weakness, Luthor hits him with concentrated solar radiation that oversaturates his cells and kills him. Luthor then takes samples of the creature to continue his experiment, deciding to clone a purely Kryptonian body. Five years later, a capsule labeled B-0 is shown.

====Subject B-0====
After the Crime Syndicate takes over the world, Luthor releases Subject B-0, though his transformation is only halfway through. Luthor commands B-0 to murder a security guard as a test. B-0 initially ignores the order but kills the guard after the guard threatens Luthor with a gun. Luthor realizes that B-0 will not commit murder but will protect Luthor as he seems to view him as a father figure. Luthor is pleased and decides to use the imperfect clone in his plan to take the Syndicate down. Later, when Luthor and his team of villains pass through a tunnel, B-0 is revealed to be afraid of darkness. Luthor tries to comfort him with a story about his own fears, but ultimately wonders whether the clone was a waste of time; B-0 then speaks his first words, &quot;Bizarro... try&quot;, much to Luthor&#x27;s surprise. Though initially doubtful, Luthor grows truly fond of &quot;Bizarro&quot;, who proves to be a powerful asset throughout the event.

During the final confrontation against the Earth-3 invaders, Bizarro battles Mazahs, the alternate version of Luthor himself; although he initially has the upper hand, Bizarro is fatally wounded and left to die. Luthor desperately tries to fix him, to no avail, and they share a sorrowful goodbye. Enraged over the death of Bizarro, Lex Luthor murders his Earth-3 counterpart, avenging Bizarro. After the battle is over, Luthor restarts the cloning process; when one of his scientists states it should take about ten years to fully develop a perfect Kryptonian clone, Luthor corrects him by saying it will take only five years, revealing he truly intends to create a perfect copy of &quot;Bizarro&quot;.

===&quot;DC Rebirth&quot;===

In 2016, DC Comics implemented another relaunch of its books called &quot;DC Rebirth&quot;, which restored its continuity to a form much as it was prior to &quot;The New 52&quot;.

A clone of Bizarro is found inside of a tube in a train car stolen by Black Mask sometime after the Crime Syndicate of America incident. Red Hood and Artemis jump aboard the train car attempting to steal a weapon, not expecting it to be a clone of Superman. Bizarro eventually joins the Red Hood&#x27;s Outlaws. During this time, Bizarro is stricken with a sickness which causes his cells to rapidly deteriorate. After saving his teammates in the Outlaws, he dies. Lex Luthor takes his body to try to resurrect him, on the condition that he be the property of Lexcorp. This results in Bizarro becoming extremely smart, surprising his teammates.

Bizarro and Artemis briefly get trapped in a different dimension, but return to Earth. Bizarro becomes the ruler of Hell after killing Trigon, and plans to be the Ruler of Hell to make sure Earth is not in danger before saying goodbye to Jason Todd and Artemis.

==Powers and abilities==
Generally, Bizarro&#x27;s powers are identical to Superman&#x27;s, with the most substantial difference being that they are reverse versions of certain abilities.

* “Arctic vision” unleashes twin beams of subzero light from his eyes which instantaneously freezes anything or anyone on contact; inducing frostbite and even hypothermia.
* “Flame breath” allows him to exhale a superheated napalm-like substance which causes severe burns with minimal contact and even melt steel at maximum intensity.
* &quot;Vacuum breath&quot; instead of wind breath, he can inhale large amounts of air to draw people and objects towards him.
* &quot;Bizarro telescopic vision&quot; which allows Bizarro to see a &quot;short distance behind his head&quot; rather than a &quot;long distance in front of his head&quot;.
* &quot;Bizarro microscopic vision&quot; which makes objects &quot;actually smaller to everyone&quot; rather than merely &quot;appear to be bigger to only the user&quot;. 
* &quot;Bizarro X-ray vision&quot; which allows Bizarro to &quot;only see through lead&quot; rather than the ability to &quot;see through anything except lead&quot;.
* &quot;Spotlight vision&quot; which allows Bizarro to project beams of light in the fashion of a spotlight from his eyes to highlight what he is looking at.
* &quot;X-ray hearing&quot; which allows Bizarro to hear through everything except lead.

When operating within an environment under a blue sun, Bizarro gains the ability to replicate new lifeforms from his own body mass. Using this power, he cloned a cube-shaped planet that has become colloquially known as Htrae (Earth spelled backwards). This world is now populated by Bizarro versions of Superman, his family, friends, and enemies. Similarly, Bizarro&#x27;s weaknesses are reversed: green kryptonite has an empowering effect on him – healing and strengthening his body similar to the effects of yellow sunlight on Superman; while only blue kryptonite (an imperfect duplicate of green kryptonite) affects Bizarro adversely in the same manner that the former does with normal Kryptonians; i.e., causing him debilitating pain and diminishing his superpowers.

==Other versions==

* An alternate universe variant of Bizarro appears in &quot;Legends of the Dead Earth&quot;. This version is a former media-star who owns an amusement park.
* An alternate universe variant of Bizarro appears in &quot;The Superman Monster&quot;. This version was created by Viktor Luthor using the remains of the infant Kal-El, who died shortly after arriving on Earth. After Luthor abandons him, he is adopted by Johan and Martha Kant, whose son had recently died.
* Alternate universe versions of Bizarro appear in &quot;&quot;. These versions were created by Lex Luthor to hunt metahumans and disguised as robots known as the &quot;Liberators&quot;.

* Alternate universe variants of Bizarro appear in &quot;All-Star Superman&quot;. These versions are from an alternative universe called the &quot;Underverse&quot; and can transform others into Bizarros by touch. Superman befriends one of them, dubbed Zibarro, while stranded in the Underverse, and enlists the Bizarros&#x27; help in returning home.
* An alternate universe variant of Bizarro appears in &quot;Adventure Comics 80-Page Giant&quot; by Tom Peyer and Kevin O&#x27;Neill.
* An alternate universe variant of Bizarro appears in &quot;Trinity&quot;.

* An alternate universe variant of Bizarro appears in &quot;Justice&quot;. This version was created by Lex Luthor and is a member of his Legion of Doom. 

==In other media==
===Television===
====Live-action====

* Bizarro, based on the Silver Age comics incarnation, appears in &quot;Superboy&quot;, portrayed by Barry Meyers. This version was created after Superboy was exposed to an experimental, lightning-charged duplicating ray. After going on a rampage, the double adopts the alias of &quot;Kent Clark&quot; and falls in love with and becomes violently possessive of Lana Lang before being healed by duplicated Kryptonite. In subsequent appearances, Bizarro is manipulated by Lex Luthor into attacking Superboy via a duplicated Lang, who convinces Bizarro to thwart Luthor, and is temporarily rendered human through extensive plastic surgery and an experimental process meant to copy Superboy&#x27;s brainwaves to his own brain before being forced to reverse the process to save the weakened Superboy.
* A childlike clone akin to Bizarro appears in the &quot;Lois and Clark: The New Adventures of Superman&quot; episode &quot;Vatman&quot;, portrayed by Dean Cain. Similarly to the &quot;post-Crisis&quot; incarnation, this version was created and raised by Lex Luthor to challenge Superman. However, Lois Lane and Clark Kent help the clone realize his true nature. After a battle with Superman, the dying clone goes on to destroy Luthor&#x27;s lab and the DNA sample used to create him before dying in Superman&#x27;s arms.
* Bizarro appears in &quot;Smallville&quot;, portrayed by Tom Welling. This version is a &quot;phantom wraith&quot; who was created by a Kryptonian experiment and imprisoned in the Phantom Zone years prior until Clark Kent accidentally releases it in the present. Due to being unable to survive outside of the Phantom Zone, the wraith survives by possessing various human hosts until it steals part of Kent&#x27;s DNA to gain a physical form identical to his with all of his strengths and an inverted version of his energy absorption ability, with Green Kryptonite strengthening it and direct sunlight weakening it. After Kent defeats the wraith and the Martian Manhunter traps it on Mars, it escapes following a solar eclipse and returns to Earth where it briefly allies with Brainiac and assumes Kent’s identity. However, it is eventually killed by Lana Lang, who overloads it on Blue Kryptonite.
* A Bizarro counterpart of Supergirl, also known as Bizarro-Girl, appears in &quot;Supergirl&quot;, portrayed by Hope Lauren and Melissa Benoist. This version is the result of Maxwell Lord plotting to frame Supergirl as a public menace by locating a permanently comatose, unidentified brain trauma patient who closely resembles Supergirl and altering her with Supergirl&#x27;s DNA to gain her powers and appearance. Subsequently, Bizarro-Girl attacks Supergirl, who joins forces with Alex Danvers to stop the former with Blue Kryptonite bullets. Afterwards, she is taken into custody by Supergirl and transferred to the Department of Extranormal Operations (DEO) and placed into an induced coma until she can be cured or helped.
* Bizarro appears in &quot;Superman &amp; Lois&quot;, portrayed by Tyler Hoechlin while Daniel Cudmore portrays his armored form and Paul Lazenby motion-captures his monstrous form. This version was a celebrity from the Inverse World who suffers from a Kryptonite addiction, which left him in a zombie-like state and resulted in him alienating his family. After cult leader Ally Allston takes over the Inverse World in an attempt to merge it with Earth, Bizarro dons a containment suit and travels to Superman&#x27;s world, but is weakened by X-Kryptonite. Nonetheless, he successfully warns Superman of Allston&#x27;s plans before he is killed by a X-Kryptonite-powered Mitch Anderson, with his body eventually ending up in the Department of Defense (DOD)&#x27;s custody before Intergang steals it. While experimenting on Bizarro, Intergang revives him before Lex Luthor captures and experiments on him further, which causes him to mutate into Doomsday. Throughout the fourth season, Luthor uses Doomsday as his enforcer until Superman eventually flies the latter into the sun, which Bizarro allows.

===Miscellaneous===
* Bizarro comics are referenced in &quot;The Sandman: A Game of You&quot; as &quot;Weirdzos&quot; comic books. While &quot;The Sandman&quot; series was published by DC Comics&#x27;s adult-themed Vertigo imprint, the editors were reluctant to allow Superman-related characters to be featured in the latter.
* Bizarro appears in &quot;Superboy&quot; #8.
* Bizarro appears in &quot;Superman Adventures&quot;.
* From 2009 to 2021, Six Flags Great Adventure changed the name and theming of the Medusa to Bizarro before eventually changing it back.
* In 2009, Superman: Ride of Steel at Six Flags New England was rethemed to reflect Bizarro. The Bizarro theme lasted until 2015, when the roller coaster was reverted back to Superman The Ride.
* Bizarro appears in the &quot;&quot; prequel comic. This version was created by Lex Luthor to stop Superman after he becomes more violent and tyrannical, but escaped before he could be completed, resulting in him developing gray skin and diminished mental capacity. After traveling to Germany and being mistaken for Superman by a civilian, the clone believes this to be true, dons a backwards Superman suit, and tries to establish peace. However, his lack of common sense and a basic understanding of human ways leads to him wreaking havoc and killing Weather Wizard and Heat Wave before the Trickster convinces Bizarro that they are friends and that the real Superman is an imposter and his enemy. Once the Regime learns of him, Superman meets with the clone, with Yellow Lantern naming the latter &quot;Bizarro&quot;, but the clone escapes before the Regime can discover his origins. Following this, Bizarro accidentally kills the Trickster. Not understanding what happened, Bizarro takes the Trickster&#x27;s corpse to the civilian he first met, but he calls for the Regime&#x27;s help, leading to Bizarro returning to Luthor&#x27;s lab. Fearing the clone will expose him as a double agent in the Regime working for Batman&#x27;s Insurgency, Luthor sends Bizarro to the Fortress of Solitude, claiming the latter will find answers while secretly hoping his thrall Doomsday will be able to stop him. Bizarro and Doomsday&#x27;s subsequent fight leads to Superman intervening and Luthor eventually using Doomsday to kill Bizarro before taking his corpse to study.
* Warner Bros. Consumer Products collaborated with Livobooks to produce the interactive motion comic &quot;Superman and Bizarro Save the Planet&quot;.

<doc id="244502" wikidata="Q229032" url="?curid=244502" title="Janet Napolitano">
<text>Janet Ann Napolitano (; born November 29, 1957) is an American politician, lawyer, and academic administrator. She served as president of the University of California from 2013 to 2020, on the faculty at the Goldman School of Public Policy at the University of California, Berkeley since 2015, the United States secretary of homeland security from 2009 to 2013 (during the administration of President Barack Obama), and the 21st governor of Arizona from 2003 to 2009. Napolitano also served as Chairwoman of the National Governors Association for the 2006–2007 cycle, becoming the first woman to do so.

Prior to her election as governor, she served as attorney general of Arizona from 1999 to 2003. She was the first woman and the 23rd person to serve in that office. Napolitano had earlier served as the United States attorney for the District of Arizona. She has been the first woman to serve in several offices, including attorney general of Arizona, secretary of homeland security, and president of the University of California.

&quot;Forbes&quot; ranked her as the world&#x27;s ninth most powerful woman in 2012 and eighth most powerful woman in 2013. In 2008, she was listed by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as one of the women most likely to become the first female president of the United States. Napolitano also sits on the bipartisan advisory board of States United Democracy Center. She was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 2018.

==Early life and education==
Janet Napolitano was born on November 29, 1957, in New York City, the daughter of Jane Marie (née Winer) and Leonard Michael Napolitano, who was the dean of the University of New Mexico School of Medicine. Her father was of Italian descent and her mother had German and Austrian ancestry. Her grandfather was named Filippo Napolitano.

Napolitano is a Methodist. She is the oldest of three children, with a younger brother and sister. She was raised in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, and also in Albuquerque, New Mexico, where she graduated from Sandia High School in 1975.

Napolitano received a Bachelor of Science &quot;summa cum laude&quot; with a major in political science from Santa Clara University in 1979 and a Juris Doctor from the University of Virginia in 1983.

Napolitano was Santa Clara&#x27;s first female valedictorian, a Truman Scholar, and a member of Phi Beta Kappa. After graduation, she worked as an analyst for the United States Senate Committee on the Budget. In 1978, she studied for a term at the London School of Economics as part of Santa Clara&#x27;s exchange program through IES Abroad. She then went to the University of Virginia School of Law after which she served as a law clerk for Judge Mary M. Schroeder of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, then joined Schroeder&#x27;s former firm, Lewis and Roca, in Phoenix. She was named a partner of the firm in 1989.

== Career ==
In 1991, while a partner at Lewis and Roca LLP, Napolitano served as an attorney for Anita Hill. Hill testified in the U.S. Senate that then U.S. Supreme Court nominee Clarence Thomas had sexually harassed her ten years earlier when she was his subordinate at the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission.

In 1993, Napolitano was appointed by President Bill Clinton as United States attorney for the District of Arizona. As U.S. attorney, she was involved in the investigation of Michael Fortier of Kingman, Arizona, in connection with the Oklahoma City bombing. She ran for and won the position of Arizona attorney general in 1998. During her tenure as attorney general, she focused on consumer protection issues and improving general law enforcement.

While serving as attorney general, she spoke at the 2000 Democratic National Convention just three weeks after having a mastectomy. Napolitano recalled that the pain was so unbearable that she could not stand up. &quot;Work and family helped me focus on other things while I battled the cancer,&quot; says Napolitano. &quot;I am very grateful for all the support I had from family, friends and Arizonans.&quot; As attorney general she also defended Arizona&#x27;s death penalty statute before the United States Supreme Court when she argued &quot;Ring v. Arizona&quot;.

=== Governor of Arizona ===

In 2002, Napolitano narrowly won the gubernatorial election with 46 percent of the vote, succeeding Republican Jane Dee Hull and defeating her Republican opponent, former congressman Matt Salmon, who received 45 percent of the vote. She was Arizona&#x27;s third female governor and the first female elected governor in the United States to succeed another elected female governor. She was also the first Democrat popularly elected to the governorship since Bruce Babbitt left office in 1987, and the first female governor of Arizona to be elected outright.

She spoke at the 2004 Democratic Convention, where some initially considered her to be a possible running mate for presidential candidate Sen. John Kerry in the 2004 presidential election. Kerry selected Senator John Edwards instead. In November 2005, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named her one of the five best governors in the U.S.

As Governor, Napolitano set records for total number of vetoes issued. In 2005, she set a single-session record of 58 vetoes, breaking Jane Dee Hull&#x27;s 2001 record of 28. This was followed in June 2006, less than four years into her term, when she issued her 115th veto and set the all-time record for vetoes by an Arizona governor. The previous record of 114 vetoes was set by Bruce Babbitt during his nine years in office. By the time she left office, Napolitano had issued 180 vetoes.

Napolitano supported many educational initiatives. She successfully negotiated the creation of voluntary full-day kindergarten in Arizona. The state previously only funded half-day programs. She created a literacy program, and acquired funding for an increase in teacher salaries. She spearheaded significant investments in higher education, including funding a Phoenix campus for the University of Arizona College of Medicine.

She also built the state&#x27;s rainy day fund to more than $650 million, at the time the highest ever. She played a leading role in the successful bid to host Super Bowl XLII in Glendale, Arizona, expanded the number of teams in the Cactus league and invested heavily in tourism and economic development initiatives. She was one of the first governors to call for the National Guard at the border after declaring a state emergency related to border security.

In November 2006, Napolitano was re-elected as governor, defeating the Republican challenger, Len Munsil, by a nearly 2:1 ratio. She was the first woman to be re-elected to that office and the first gubernatorial candidate in state history to win every county and every legislative district in Arizona. Arizona&#x27;s constitution limits its governors to two consecutive terms, so Napolitano would not have been eligible to seek a third term in office in 2010.

In January 2006, Napolitano won the Woodrow Wilson Award for Public Service. She served as a member of the Democratic Governors Association Executive Committee. She has also served previously as chair of the Western Governors Association, and the National Governors Association. She served as NGA chair from 2006 to 2007, and was the first female governor and first governor of Arizona to serve in that position.

=== Secretary of Homeland Security ===

In February 2006, Napolitano was named by The White House Project as one of &quot;8 in &#x27;08&quot;, a group of eight female politicians who were suggested as possible candidates for president in 2008. On January 11, 2008, she endorsed then Illinois Senator Barack Obama as the Democratic nominee for president. On November 5, 2008, she was named to the advisory board of the Obama-Biden Transition Project.

On December 1, 2008, Barack Obama introduced Napolitano as his nominee for United States Secretary of Homeland Security. On January 20, 2009, Napolitano was confirmed, becoming the first woman appointed as Secretary in the relatively new department, and the fourth person to hold the position overall (including one acting secretary). Arizona Secretary of State Jan Brewer became governor of Arizona.

In March 2009, Napolitano told the German news site &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that while there is always a threat from terrorism, she preferred to talk about &quot;man-caused&#x27; disasters&quot; as a way &quot;to move away from the politics of fear toward a policy of being prepared for all risks that can occur.&quot;

In April 2009, in an interview defending her plans to tighten the Canada–US border, Napolitano incorrectly implied that the September 11 attack perpetrators entered the United States from Canada. This claim was made by several politicians based upon erroneous news reports in the days after the attack. Napolitano explained that she misunderstood the question and was referring to other individuals who had planned attacks and entered through Canada, but Canadian diplomats rebuked her for helping perpetuate a myth.

In response to criticism, she later said that while she knew no 9/11 terrorists entered the U.S. through Canada, &quot;there are other instances … when suspected terrorists have attempted to enter our country from Canada to the United States... [s]ome of these are well known to the public, such as the millennium bomber, while others are not due to security reasons.&quot; There has only been one publicly reported case of terrorists coming to the United States through Canada, that of Ahmed Ressam, an Algerian citizen who was in Canada illegally and who had planned an attack on Los Angeles International Airport (LAX) as part of the 2000 millennium attack plots. Nevertheless, Napolitano later claimed that &quot;Canada allows people into its country that we do not allow into ours&quot; as a justification for treating the Mexican and Canadian borders equally.

==== H1N1 flu ====
As Secretary, Napolitano was a central leader in the federal response to the 2009 flu pandemic.  Rather than closing schools and businesses, which would have led to wide-scale disruption, Napolitano advanced a strategy of proactive education for prevention. This included a basic virus-prevention education program. Ultimately, as a result of the programs implemented by Napolitano and others, much of the damage expected from this flu was mitigated.

==== Right-wing extremism memo ====
Napolitano was the subject of controversy after the release of a Department of Homeland Security threat assessment report that was seen as derogatory towards armed forces veterans. The report focused on potential threats from the radical right. &quot;Rightwing&quot; &quot;Extremism: Current Economic and Political Climate Fueling Resurgence in Radicalization and Recruitment&quot; was made public in April 2009. The report suggested several factors, including the election of the first black or mixed race president in Barack Obama, concerns regarding future gun control measures, illegal immigration, the economic downturn beginning in 2008, abortion controversy, and disgruntled military veterans&#x27; possible vulnerability to recruitment efforts by extremist groups as potential risk factors regarding right-wing extremism recruitment.

Napolitano made multiple apologies for offending veterans groups by the reference to veterans in the assessment, and promised to meet with those groups to discuss the issue. The Department of Homeland Security admitted a &quot;breakdown in an internal process&quot; by ignoring objections by the Office of Civil Rights and Civil Liberties to a portion of the document.

While the American Legion reportedly criticized the assessment, Glen M. Gardner Jr., the national commander of the 2.2 million-member Veterans of Foreign Wars, generally defended it, saying it &quot;should have been worded differently&quot; but served a vital purpose. &quot;A government that does not assess internal and external security threats would be negligent of a critical public responsibility&quot;, he said in a statement.

==== Reaction to Northwest Airlines Flight 253 ====
Napolitano was criticized for stating in an interview with CNN&#x27;s Candy Crowley that &quot;the system worked&quot; with regard to an attempted terrorist attack on Northwest Airlines Flight 253 approaching Detroit on Christmas Day 2009. She said:

What we are focused on is making sure that the air environment remains safe, that people are confident when they travel. And one thing I&#x27;d like to point out is that the system worked. Everybody played an important role here. The passengers and crew of the flight took appropriate action. Within literally an hour to 90 minutes of the incident occurring, all 128 flights in the air had been notified to take some special measures in light of what had occurred on the Northwest Airlines flight. We instituted new measures on the ground and at screening areas, both here in the United States and in Europe, where this flight originated. So the whole process of making sure that we respond properly, correctly and effectively went very smoothly.

She later went on NBC&#x27;s Today Show with host Matt Lauer and admitted that the security system had indeed failed. She said that her earlier statement was &quot;taken out of context&quot; and maintained &quot;air travel is safe&quot;, but admitted, &quot;our system did not work in this instance&quot; and no one &quot;is happy or satisfied with that&quot;. Lauer then asked her whether the system failed up until the moment the bomber had tried to blow up the plane, and Napolitano answered, &quot;It did [fail].&quot;

In response to the NW253 bomb attempt, Napolitano instituted emergency enhanced pat-down screening until airport security technology could be deployed that could detect non-metallic explosives. After full body scanners were deployed, the enhanced pat-downs were used selectively on passengers who triggered an alarm when passing through the detection equipment.

==== TSA PreCheck and Global Entry ====
To reduce the time consumed by airport security checks Napolitano created the popular program TSA PreCheck, which allows travelers to provide background information about themselves to the Transportation Security Administration (TSA) in return for expedited security screening. TSA PreCheck reduces the number of unknown passengers arriving at security screening lines in airports. She also expanded the U.S. Customs and Border Protection trusted traveler program, Global Entry, to include more American travelers and some from verified partners abroad.

==== Secure Communities ====
Secure Communities, or SComm, is a deportation program managed by U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, a subdivision of Homeland Security. Napolitano came under scrutiny for contradicting herself about whether the program is voluntary or mandatory for local jurisdictions. On September 7, 2010, Napolitano said in a letter to Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren that jurisdictions that wished to withdraw from the program could do so. However, in October 2010 a &quot;Washington Post&quot; article quoted an anonymous senior ICE official saying: &quot;Secure Communities is not based on state or local cooperation in federal law enforcement ... State and local law enforcement agencies are going to continue to fingerprint people and those fingerprints are forwarded to FBI for criminal checks. ICE will take immigration action appropriately.&quot;

Napolitano later modified her position: &quot;What my letter said was that we would work with them on the implementation in terms of timing and the like ... But we do not view this as an opt-in, opt-out program.&quot; At the same time Arlington, Virginia passed a resolution to opt out of SComm. A DHS employee commented at a policy conference: &quot;Have we created some of the confusion out there? Absolutely we have.&quot;

==== Border security ====
Under Napolitano&#x27;s leadership, the DHS invested heavily in border security and border security technology. These investments included a border security supplement passed by Congress to fund an increase in technology and infrastructure along the southern border with Mexico. This technology was used to replace Boeing&#x27;s SBI Net, which was widely criticized as expensive and dysfunctional.

==== Printer bomb attempt ====
After the 2010 transatlantic aircraft bomb plot, which used printer cartridges to conceal bombs, Napolitano issued a ban for toner and ink cartridges weighing more than one pound on passenger flights.

==== Walmart–DHS partnership ====
On December 6, 2010, Walmart announced it was partnering with the DHS. The partnership included a video message from Napolitano on TV screens in Walmart stores playing a &quot;public service announcement&quot; to ask customers to report suspicious activity to a Walmart manager. Napolitano compared the undertaking to &quot;the Cold War fight against communists.&quot;

==== Tucson memorial ====

On January 12, 2011, together with President Barack Obama, Napolitano was one of the speakers selected to express sympathy to the community of Tucson, the State of Arizona, and the rest of the nation in a televised memorial for the 2011 Tucson shooting.

==== Discrimination lawsuit ====
In July 2012, Napolitano was accused of allowing discrimination against male staffers within the Department of Homeland Security. The federal discrimination lawsuit, filed in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia, was filed by James Hayes Jr., at the time a special agent of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in New York City. The suit alleged that managers Dora Schriro and Suzanne Barr mistreated male staffers, and that promotions were given to women who were friends of Napolitano. The suit also claimed that when the abuse was reported to the Equal Employment Opportunity office Napolitano launched a series of misconduct investigations against the reporting party, Hayes. This allegation was never proven. The spokesperson for ICE declined to comment on &quot;unfounded claims&quot;.

Suzanne Barr, who was one of Napolitano&#x27;s first appointments after she became secretary in 2009, went on leave after Hayes filed his lawsuit and resigned on September 1, 2012. She called the allegations in the lawsuit &quot;unfounded.&quot; In November 2012, Hayes&#x27; attorney said that the &quot;parties have come to an agreement in principle&quot; to settle the case for $175,000 plus a settlement that would include other conditions, including Hayes keeping his job.

Napolitano was also sued by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement agent who claims he was pulled from his post at JFK Airport after making a series of employment-discrimination complaints.

==== DACA and comprehensive immigration reform ====

Napolitano was a long-term advocate for comprehensive immigration reform, starting with her terms as governor of Arizona. In 2012, in an effort to provide relief for the so-called DREAM Act population, or DREAMers, Napolitano used prosecutorial discretion to create the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA). DREAMers were brought to the U.S. by their parents as minors and have no experience of living in their countries of citizenship. The program deferred removal proceedings against DREAMers, providing them with the legal status to remain in the United States without fear of deportation.

DACA was announced by President Obama in a Rose Garden ceremony shortly after its creation. It was criticized by some members of Congress as an abuse of executive authority.  Napolitano&#x27;s successor, Jeh Johnson, later attempted to expand the program to include parents of DREAMers, but that expansion was subsequently overturned in courts. DACA remains in place and has never been found unconstitutional by a U.S. court.

=== President of the University of California ===
In July 2013, Napolitano announced she would leave her post as Secretary of Homeland Security to become president of the University of California (UC). She was appointed the 20th president by the University of California Board of Regents on July 18, 2013, the first woman to lead the University of California, and began her tenure as president on September 30, 2013. But after Napolitano became a president of the UC, there were protests who interrupted her as &quot;they were among dozens of demonstrators who contended that Napolitano was the wrong person to lead an institution with so many students from around the world.&quot; On September 18, 2019, Napolitano announced her resignation as president, effective August 1, 2020.

Among her first acts as president was the allocation of more support for UC&#x27;s undocumented students, and expanded efforts to diversify the ranks of UC graduate students and post-doctoral researchers. She also initiated an ambitious ongoing plan for the ten-campus system to achieve carbon neutrality by 2025, saying that it was a &#x27;moral imperative&#x27; for UC to find solutions to global climate change. In seeking to reduce UC&#x27;s carbon footprint to zero, Napolitano authorized the university to register as an Electric Service Provider, allowing it to supply energy directly to some of its campuses and medical centers from an 80-MW solar farm in Fresno. In 2017, Napolitano was awarded the Pat Brown Award from the California Council for Environmental and Economic Balance for her environmental leadership.

Napolitano has used her tenure as president to encourage more students to pursue public interest careers. She created a fund for fellowships for undergraduate students to offset costs related to public service internships in Sacramento and Washington D.C. She also created the President&#x27;s Public Service Law Fellowship program, which awards $4.5 million annually to law students at UC Berkeley, UC Davis, UC Irvine and UCLA to make postgraduate work and summer positions more accessible for students who wish to pursue public interest legal careers but might be forced to seek private sector jobs out of financial need.

As part of her Global Food Initiative, which was launched in 2014, Napolitano committed $3.3 million to help students at the University of California access nutritious food. At the time it was the nation&#x27;s most comprehensive, systematic plan to tackle the problem of food insecurity.

Napolitano led efforts to combat sexual violence and harassment at the University of California through improvements to the system&#x27;s policies and procedures. On March 7, 2014 Napolitano wrote a letter to the UC community announcing a new presidential policy prohibiting sexual harassment and violence and providing support for victims and training for faculty, staff and students. She also created a system-wide Title IX office and appointed the first system-wide Title IX coordinator in January 2017.

On October 26, 2017 the University of California announced the establishment of the National Center for Free Speech and Civic Engagement. Chaired by Napolitano, the center is devoted to research, education and advocacy on issues of free speech and civic engagement.

During Napolitano&#x27;s time as president of UC, tuition for undergraduates held steady, with one tuition increase of $282 in 2017.

==== Controversies ====

In April 2016, Napolitano placed Linda Katehi, the chancellor of the University of California, Davis, on administrative leave following revelations that UC Davis attempted to suppress web searches relating to the UC Davis pepper spray incident, as well as charges of nepotism and allegation of misuse of student funds.

On April 25, 2017 the California State Auditor issued a report that Janet Napolitano and her University of California Office of the President failed to disclose $175 million and engaged in misleading budget practices. After an investigation, the University of California took disciplinary action against Napolitano, issuing a public admonishment. According to an independent report by retired State Supreme Justice Carlos R. Moreno, Napolitano approved a plan that pressured the ten UC campuses to change their survey responses about Napolitano&#x27;s administration from negative responses to positive ones.

On September 8, 2017 the University of California and Janet Napolitano filed a lawsuit against the United States Federal Government in response to President Donald Trump&#x27;s decision to ultimately end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals or DACA, making her the first former secretary of homeland security to sue the agency she once led over a policy that she created.

In 2020, Janet Napolitano fired 82 University of California, Santa Cruz graduate students for withholding grades in a wildcat strike for a Cost of Living Adjustment to address living conditions. Dismissed students faced loss of tuition remission, health benefits, and living stipends and international students faced loss of student visa status.

=== Later career ===
Napolitano was repeatedly discussed as a contender for appointment to the U.S. Supreme Court. Some political commentators also suggested a possible candidacy in the 2016 United States presidential election.
In September 2014, when Attorney General Eric Holder announced his intention to step down, there was speculation that Napolitano might be a candidate for the next United States attorney general. Instead, Loretta Lynch replaced Holder.

Napolitano serves as an advisor on the COVID-19 Technology Task Force, a technology industry coalition founded in March 2020 collaborating on solutions to respond to and recover from the COVID-19 pandemic.

After stepping down as president of the University of California, Napolitano continued to be a UC Berkeley faculty member within the Goldman School of Public Policy. In 2021, she founded and became the director of the Center for Security in Politics. 

In May 2022, Napolitano was appointed to serve as a member of the President&#x27;s Intelligence Advisory Board.

==Personal life==
Napolitano is an avid basketball fan and regularly plays tennis and softball. Whitewater rafting and hiking are among her hobbies. She has hiked in Arizona&#x27;s Superstition Mountains, New Mexico&#x27;s Sandia Mountains, and the Himalayas, and has climbed Mount Kilimanjaro.

Napolitano has never married and has no children; as a result, some of her political opponents have speculated about her sexual orientation. In 2002, &quot;vote gay&quot; fliers were posted next to her campaign signs. Napolitano responded by saying that she is &quot;just a straight, single workaholic&quot;.

Napolitano began undergoing cancer-related treatment in August 2016. On January 17, 2017, Napolitano was hospitalized in Oakland due to complications from the cancer treatment. She was released from hospital on January 23.

<text>Kronk Gym is a boxing gym located in Detroit, once led by trainer Emanuel Steward. It was run out of the basement of the oldest recreation center of the City of Detroit, and became a household word in the sport of boxing and its gold shorts a magnet to young talent following the enormous success and high profile of multiple World Champion and Boxing Hall of Famer Thomas &quot;The Hitman&quot; Hearns in the 1980s.

Named after Detroit City Councilman John Kronk, the training facility opened in 1921. The original site closed in 2006, but it reopened in 2015.

== History ==
===Original Detroit gym===
Kronk began to earn fame during the late 1970s, when prospects like Hilmer Kenty, Thomas Hearns and Mickey Goodwin trained there. In 1980, Kenty became Kronk&#x27;s first world champion, Hearns following him months after. In 1983, Kronk fighter Milton McCrory won the WBC welterweight title vacated by Sugar Ray Leonard; Jimmy Paul beat Harry Arroyo for the International Boxing Federation&#x27;s world lightweight title in 1985. Duane Thomas, another Kronk fighter, beat John Mugabi for the WBC light middleweight title in 1986. McCrory&#x27;s brother, Steve McCrory, was also a world champion who as an amateur won the flyweight gold medal at the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles. In 1984 four Kronk team members of various weight classes were ranked world&#x27;s top ten by AIBA: Steve McCrory #1 at 112 lbs, Mark Breland #1 at 147 lbs, Frank Tate #5 at 156 lbs, and Ricky Womack #3 at 178 lbs.

In the 1990s the Kronk stable included two-time WBA welterweight champion Mark Breland, top amateur prospect and future contender Tarick Salmaci, and repeat welterweight contender Oba Carr.

Among the many world champions who trained at Kronk at least once during their careers are Michael Moorer, Wilfred Benítez (in the Tucson gym), Héctor Camacho, Julio César Chávez, Naseem Hamed, Evander Holyfield, Lennox Lewis, Jermain Taylor and Tyson Fury.

===Tucson gym===
Kronk opened a second gym in Tucson, Arizona during the 1990s. A new host of fighters who would later become world champions arrived there, including Gerald McClellan. The Kronk &quot;franchise&quot; began to sell Kronk merchandise through catalog sales.

In 1998 Kronk opened Kronk Gym website, promoting the gyms and their fighters.

===Detroit gym closure===
In September 2006, the original gym at 5555 McGraw Avenue between 33rd and Junction Streets in Detroit closed temporarily after thieves stole copper water pipes, cutting off supply to the building. Boxers relocated to a Dearborn Gold&#x27;s Gym. A &quot;Save the Kronk&quot; campaign aimed at keeping the facilities from closing due to budget shortfall was spearheaded by Emanuel Steward. The campaign would ultimately work toward building a new Kronk.

The gym and recreation center was officially closed by the Recreation Department on November 28, 2006 due to the prohibitive cost of repairs to the plumbing and building infrastructure.

In the past few years, the Detroit gym relocated to a new facility in a storefront on West Warren Avenue.

On October 7, 2017, the original Kronk Gym went up in flames in a suspicious fire. The roof was destroyed and the basement gym was heavily damaged.

=== Reopening ===
The new facility opened on Memorial Day weekend in 2015 at 9520 Mettetal St.

On August 20, 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent restrictions on sports events, the gym hosted its first ever professional boxing event, a long-time dream held by Steward. The card was headlined by Kronk fighter Vladimir Shishkin who defeated Oscar Riojas via ninth-round technical knockout.

<doc id="244516" wikidata="Q6786560" url="?curid=244516" title="Material implication (rule of inference)">
<text>In propositional logic, material implication is a valid rule of replacement that allows a conditional statement to be replaced by a disjunction in which the antecedent is negated. The rule states that &quot;P implies Q&quot; is logically equivalent to &quot;not-formula_1 or formula_2&quot; and that either form can replace the other in logical proofs. In other words, if formula_1 is true, then formula_2 must also be true, while if formula_2 is true, then formula_1 cannot be true either; additionally, when formula_1 is not true, formula_2 may be either true or false.

: formula_9

where &quot;formula_10&quot; is a metalogical symbol representing &quot;can be replaced in a proof with&quot;, &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are any given logical statements, and formula_11 can be read as &quot;(not &quot;P&quot;) or &quot;Q&quot;&quot;. To illustrate this, consider the following statements:
* formula_1: Sam ate an orange for lunch.
* formula_2: Sam ate a fruit for lunch.

Then, to say &quot;Sam ate an orange for lunch&quot; &quot;Sam ate a fruit for lunch&quot; (formula_14). Logically, if Sam did not eat a fruit for lunch, then Sam also cannot have eaten an orange for lunch (by contraposition). However, merely saying that Sam did not eat an orange for lunch provides no information on whether or not Sam ate a fruit (of any kind) for lunch.

==Partial proof==
Suppose we are given that formula_14. Then we have formula_16 by the law of excluded middle (i.e. either formula_1 must be true, or formula_1 must not be true). 

Subsequently, since formula_14, formula_1 can be replaced by formula_2 in the statement, and thus it follows that formula_11 (i.e. either formula_2 must be true, or formula_1 must not be true).

Suppose, conversely, we are given formula_11. Then if formula_1 is true, that rules out the first disjunct, so we have formula_2. In short, formula_14. However, if formula_1 is false, then this entailment fails, because the first disjunct formula_30 is true, which puts no constraint on the second disjunct formula_2. Hence, nothing can be said about formula_14. In sum, the equivalence in the case of false formula_1 is only conventional, and hence the formal proof of equivalence is only partial. 

This can also be expressed with a truth table:
== Example ==
An example: we are given the conditional fact that if it is a bear, then it can swim. Then, all 4 possibilities in the truth table are compared to that fact.
# If it is a bear, then it can swim — T
# If it is a bear, then it can not swim — F
# If it is not a bear, then it can swim — T because it doesn’t contradict our initial fact.
# If it is not a bear, then it can not swim — T (as above)

Thus, the conditional fact can be converted to formula_34, which is &quot;it is not a bear&quot; or &quot;it can swim&quot;,
where formula_1 is the statement &quot;it is a bear&quot; and formula_2 is the statement &quot;it can swim&quot;.

<doc id="244517" wikidata="Q178366" url="?curid=244517" title="Tibia">
<text>The tibia (; : tibiae or tibias), also known as the shinbone or shankbone, is the larger, stronger, and anterior (frontal) of the two bones in the leg below the knee in vertebrates (the other being the fibula, behind and to the outside of the tibia); it connects the knee with the ankle. The tibia is found on the medial side of the leg next to the fibula and closer to the median plane. The tibia is connected to the fibula by the interosseous membrane of leg, forming a type of fibrous joint called a syndesmosis with very little movement. The tibia is named for the flute &quot;tibia&quot;. It is the second largest bone in the human body, after the femur. The leg bones are the strongest long bones as they support the rest of the body.

==Structure==
In human anatomy, the tibia is the second largest bone next to the femur. As in other vertebrates the tibia is one of two bones in the lower leg, the other being the fibula, and is a component of the knee and ankle joints.

The ossification or formation of the bone starts from three centers, one in the shaft and one in each extremity.

The tibia is categorized as a long bone and is as such composed of a diaphysis and two epiphyses. The diaphysis is the midsection of the tibia, also known as the shaft or body. While the epiphyses are the two rounded extremities of the bone; an upper (also known as superior or proximal) closest to the thigh and a lower (also known as inferior or distal) closest to the foot. The tibia is most contracted in the lower third and the distal extremity is smaller than the proximal.

===Upper extremity===
====Condyles of tibia====
The proximal or upper extremity of the tibia is expanded in the transverse plane with a medial and lateral condyle, which are both flattened in the horizontal plane. The medial condyle is the larger of the two and is better supported over the shaft. The upper surfaces of the condyles articulate with the femur to form the tibiofemoral joint, the weightbearing part of the knee joint.

The medial and lateral condyle are separated by the intercondylar area, where the cruciate ligaments and the menisci attach. Here the medial and lateral intercondylar tubercle forms the intercondylar eminence. Together with the medial and lateral condyle the intercondylar region forms the tibial plateau, which both articulates with and is anchored to the lower extremity of the femur. The intercondylar eminence divides the intercondylar area into an anterior and posterior part. The anterolateral region of the anterior intercondylar area are perforated by numerous small openings for nutrient arteries.

The articular surfaces of both condyles are concave, particularly centrally. The flatter outer margins are in contact with the menisci. The medial condyles superior surface is oval in form and extends laterally onto the side of medial intercondylar tubercle. The lateral condyles superior surface is more circular in form and its medial edge extends onto the side of the lateral intercondylar tubercle. The posterior surface of the medial condyle bears a horizontal groove for part of the attachment of the semimembranosus muscle, whereas the lateral condyle has a circular facet for articulation with the head of the fibula.

Beneath the condyles is the tibial tuberosity which serves for attachment of the patellar ligament, a continuation of the quadriceps femoris muscle.

====Facets====
The superior articular surface presents two smooth articular facets.
* The medial facet, oval in shape, is slightly concave from side to side, and from before backward. 
* The lateral, nearly circular, is concave from side to side, but slightly convex from before backward, especially at its posterior part, where it is prolonged on to the posterior surface for a short distance.

The central portions of these facets articulate with the condyles of the femur, while their peripheral portions support the menisci of the knee joint, which here intervene between the two bones.

====Intercondyloid eminence====
Between the articular facets in the intercondylar area, but nearer the posterior than the anterior aspect of the bone, is the intercondyloid eminence (&quot;spine of tibia&quot;), surmounted on either side by a prominent tubercle, on to the sides of which the articular facets are prolonged; in front of and behind the intercondyloid eminence are rough depressions for the attachment of the anterior and posterior cruciate ligaments and the menisci.

====Surfaces====
The &quot;anterior surfaces&quot; of the condyles are continuous with one another, forming a large somewhat flattened area; this area is triangular, broad above, and perforated by large vascular foramina; narrow below where it ends in a large oblong elevation, the tuberosity of the tibia, which gives attachment to the patellar ligament; a bursa intervenes between the deep surface of the ligament and the part of the bone immediately above the tuberosity.

&quot;Posteriorly,&quot; the condyles are separated from each other by a shallow depression, the posterior intercondyloid fossa, which gives attachment to part of the posterior cruciate ligament of the knee-joint. The medial condyle presents posteriorly a deep transverse groove, for the insertion of the tendon of the semimembranosus.

Its &quot;medial surface&quot; is convex, rough, and prominent; it gives attachment to the medial collateral ligament.

The lateral condyle presents posteriorly a flat articular facet, nearly circular in form, directed downward, backward, and lateralward, for articulation with the head of the fibula. Its &quot;lateral surface&quot; is convex, rough, and prominent in front: on it is an eminence, situated on a level with the upper border of the tuberosity and at the junction of its anterior and lateral surfaces, for the attachment of the iliotibial band. Just below this a part of the extensor digitorum longus takes origin and a slip from the tendon of the biceps femoris is inserted.

===Shaft===

The shaft or body of the tibia is triangular in cross-section and forms three borders: an anterior, medial, and lateral or interosseous border. These three borders form three surfaces: the medial, lateral, and posterior.

==== Borders ====
The anterior crest or border, the most prominent of the three, commences above at the tuberosity, and ends below at the anterior margin of the medial malleolus. It is sinuous and prominent in the upper two-thirds of its extent, but smooth and rounded below; it gives attachment to the deep fascia of the leg.

The medial border is smooth and rounded above and below, but more prominent in the center. It begins at the back part of the medial condyle, and ends at the posterior border of the medial malleolus; its upper part gives attachment to the tibial collateral ligament of the knee-joint to the extent of about 5 cm., and insertion to some fibers of the popliteus muscle. From its middle third some fibers of the soleus and flexor digitorum longus muscles take origin.

The interosseous crest or lateral border is thin and prominent, especially its central part, and gives attachment to the interosseous membrane; it commences above in front of the fibular articular facet, and bifurcates below, to form the boundaries of a triangular rough surface, for the attachment of the interosseous ligament connecting the tibia and fibula.

==== Surfaces ====
The medial surface is smooth, convex, and broader above than below; its upper third, directed forward and medialward, is covered by the aponeurosis derived from the tendon of the sartorius, and by the tendons of the Gracilis and Semitendinosus, all of which are inserted nearly as far forward as the anterior crest; in the rest of its extent it is subcutaneous.

The lateral surface is narrower than the medial; its upper two-thirds present a shallow groove for the origin of the Tibialis anterior; its lower third is smooth, convex, curves gradually forward to the anterior aspect of the bone, and is covered by the tendons of the Tibialis anterior, Extensor hallucis longus, and Extensor digitorum longus, arranged in this order from the medial side.

The posterior surface presents, at its upper part, a prominent ridge, the popliteal line, which extends obliquely downward from the back part of the articular facet for the fibula to the medial border, at the junction of its upper and middle thirds; it marks the lower limit of the insertion of the Popliteus, serves for the attachment of the fascia covering this muscle, and gives origin to part of the Soleus, Flexor digitorum longus, and Tibialis posterior. The triangular area, above this line, gives insertion to the Popliteus. The middle third of the posterior surface is divided by a vertical ridge into two parts; the ridge begins at the popliteal line and is well-marked above, but indistinct below; the medial and broader portion gives origin to the Flexor digitorum longus, the lateral and narrower to part of the Tibialis posterior. The remaining part of the posterior surface is smooth and covered by the Tibialis posterior, Flexor digitorum longus, and Flexor hallucis longus. Immediately below the popliteal line is the nutrient foramen, which is large and directed obliquely downward.

===Lower extremity===
The distal end of the tibia is much smaller than the proximal end and presents five surfaces; it is prolonged downward on its medial side as a strong pyramidal process, the medial malleolus. The lower extremity of the tibia together with the fibula and talus forms the ankle joint.

==== Surfaces ====
The inferior articular surface is quadrilateral, and smooth for articulation with the talus. It is concave from before backward, broader in front than behind, and traversed from before backward by a slight elevation, separating two depressions. It is continuous with that on the medial malleolus.

The anterior surface of the lower extremity is smooth and rounded above, and covered by the tendons of the Extensor muscles; its lower margin presents a rough transverse depression for the attachment of the articular capsule of the ankle-joint.

The posterior surface is traversed by a shallow groove directed obliquely downward and medialward, continuous with a similar groove on the posterior surface of the talus and serving for the passage of the tendon of the Flexor hallucis longus.

The lateral surface presents a triangular rough depression for the attachment of the inferior interosseous ligament connecting it with the fibula; the lower part of this depression is smooth, covered with cartilage in the fresh state, and articulates with the fibula. The surface is bounded by two prominent borders (the anterior and posterior colliculi), continuous above with the interosseous crest; they afford attachment to the anterior and posterior ligaments of the lateral malleolus.

The medial surface – see medial malleolus for details.

====Fractures====
Ankle fractures of the tibia have several classification systems based on location or mechanism:

*Medial malleolus – Herscovici classification
*Posterior malleolus – Haruguchi classification
*Mechanism – Lauge-Hansen classification

===Blood supply===
The tibia is supplied with blood from two sources: A nutrient artery, as the main source, and periosteal vessels derived from the anterior tibial artery.

===Joints===
The tibia is a part of four joints; the knee, ankle, superior and inferior tibiofibular joint.

In the knee the tibia forms one of the two articulations with the femur, often referred to as the &quot;tibiofemoral components&quot; of the knee joint.; it is the weightbearing part of the knee joint.
The tibiofibular joints are the articulations between the tibia and fibula which allows very little movement.
The proximal tibiofibular joint is a small plane joint. The joint is formed between the undersurface of the lateral tibial condyle and the head of fibula. The joint capsule is reinforced by anterior and posterior ligament of the head of the fibula.
The distal tibiofibular joint (tibiofibular syndesmosis) is formed by the rough, convex surface of the medial side of the distal end of the fibula, and a rough concave surface on the lateral side of the tibia.
The part of the ankle joint known as the talocrural joint, is a synovial hinge joint that connects the distal ends of the tibia and fibula in the lower limb with the proximal end of the talus. The articulation between the tibia and the talus bears more weight than between the smaller fibula and the talus.

===Development===
The tibia is ossified from three centers: a primary center for the diaphysis (shaft) and a secondary center for each epiphysis (extremity). Ossification begins in the center of the body, about the seventh week of fetal life, and gradually extends toward the extremities.

The center for the upper epiphysis appears before or shortly after birth at close to 34 weeks gestation; it is flattened in form, and has a thin tongue-shaped process in front, which forms the tuberosity; that for the lower epiphysis appears in the second year.

The lower epiphysis fuses with the tibial shaft at about the eighteenth, and the upper one fuses about the twentieth year.

Two additional centers occasionally exist, one for the tongue-shaped process of the upper epiphysis, which forms the tuberosity, and one for the medial malleolus.

==Function==

===Muscle attachments===
===Strength===
The tibia has been modeled as taking an axial force during walking that is up to 4.7 bodyweight. Its bending moment in the sagittal plane in the late stance phase is up to 71.6 bodyweight times millimetre.

==Clinical significance==

===Fracture===
Fractures of the tibia can be divided into those that only involve the tibia; bumper fracture, Segond fracture, Gosselin fracture, toddler&#x27;s fracture, and those including both the tibia and fibula; trimalleolar fracture, bimalleolar fracture, Pott&#x27;s fracture.

==Society and culture==
In Judaism, the tibia, or shankbone, of a goat or sheep is used in the Passover Seder plate.

==Other animals==
The structure of the tibia in most other tetrapods is essentially similar to that in humans. The tuberosity of the tibia, a crest to which the patellar ligament attaches in mammals, is instead the point for the tendon of the quadriceps muscle in reptiles, birds, and amphibians, which have no patella.

<doc id="244518" wikidata="Q1143138" url="?curid=244518" title="Hodge conjecture">
<text>In mathematics, the Hodge conjecture is a major unsolved problem in algebraic geometry and complex geometry that relates the algebraic topology of a non-singular complex algebraic variety to its subvarieties.

In simple terms, the Hodge conjecture asserts that the basic topological information like the number of holes in certain geometric spaces, complex algebraic varieties, can be understood by studying the possible nice shapes sitting inside those spaces, which look like zero sets of polynomial equations. The latter objects can be studied using algebra and the calculus of analytic functions, and this allows one to indirectly understand the broad shape and structure of often higher-dimensional spaces which can not be otherwise easily visualized.

More specifically, the conjecture states that certain de Rham cohomology classes are algebraic; that is, they are sums of Poincaré duals of the homology classes of subvarieties. It was formulated by the Scottish mathematician William Vallance Douglas Hodge as a result of a work in between 1930 and 1940 to enrich the description of de Rham cohomology to include extra structure that is present in the case of complex algebraic varieties. It received little attention before Hodge presented it in an address during the 1950 International Congress of Mathematicians, held in Cambridge, Massachusetts. The Hodge conjecture is one of the Clay Mathematics Institute&#x27;s Millennium Prize Problems, with a prize of $1,000,000 US for whoever can prove or disprove the Hodge conjecture.

== Motivation ==
Let &quot;X&quot; be a compact complex manifold of complex dimension &quot;n&quot;. Then &quot;X&quot; is an orientable smooth manifold of real dimension formula_1, so its cohomology groups lie in degrees zero through formula_1. Assume &quot;X&quot; is a Kähler manifold, so that there is a decomposition on its cohomology with complex coefficients

:formula_3

where formula_4 is the subgroup of cohomology classes which are represented by harmonic forms of type formula_5. That is, these are the cohomology classes represented by differential forms which, in some choice of local coordinates formula_6, can be written as a harmonic function times
:formula_7

Since &quot;X&quot; is a compact oriented manifold, &quot;X&quot; has a fundamental class, and so &quot;X&quot; can be integrated over.

Let &quot;Z&quot; be a complex submanifold of &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;k&quot;, and let formula_8 be the inclusion map. Choose a differential form formula_9 of type formula_5. We can integrate formula_9 over &quot;Z&quot; using the pullback function formula_12,

:formula_13

To evaluate this integral, choose a point of &quot;Z&quot; and call it formula_14. The inclusion of &quot;Z&quot; in &quot;X&quot; means that we can choose a local basis on &quot;X&quot; and have formula_15 (rank-nullity theorem). If formula_16, then formula_9 must contain some formula_18 where formula_19 pulls back to zero on &quot;Z&quot;. The same is true for formula_20 if formula_21. Consequently, this integral is zero if formula_22.

The Hodge conjecture then (loosely) asks:

:Which cohomology classes in formula_23 come from complex subvarieties &quot;Z&quot;?

== Statement of the Hodge conjecture ==
Let

:formula_24

We call this the group of &quot;Hodge classes&quot; of degree 2&quot;k&quot; on &quot;X&quot;.

The modern statement of the Hodge conjecture is

::Hodge conjecture. Let &quot;X&quot; be a non-singular complex projective manifold. Then every Hodge class on &quot;X&quot; is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of &quot;X&quot;.

A projective complex manifold is a complex manifold which can be embedded in complex projective space. Because projective space carries a Kähler metric, the Fubini–Study metric, such a manifold is always a Kähler manifold. By Chow&#x27;s theorem, a projective complex manifold is also a smooth projective algebraic variety, that is, it is the zero set of a collection of homogeneous polynomials.

=== Reformulation in terms of algebraic cycles ===
Another way of phrasing the Hodge conjecture involves the idea of an algebraic cycle. An &quot;algebraic cycle&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is a formal combination of subvarieties of &quot;X&quot;; that is, it is something of the form

: formula_25

The coefficients are usually taken to be integral or rational. We define the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle to be the sum of the cohomology classes of its components. This is an example of the cycle class map of de Rham cohomology, see Weil cohomology. For example, the cohomology class of the above cycle would be

:formula_26

Such a cohomology class is called &quot;algebraic&quot;. With this notation, the Hodge conjecture becomes

::Let &quot;X&quot; be a projective complex manifold. Then every Hodge class on &quot;X&quot; is algebraic.

The assumption in the Hodge conjecture that &quot;X&quot; be algebraic (projective complex manifold) cannot be weakened. In 1977, Steven Zucker showed that it is possible to construct a counterexample to the Hodge conjecture as complex tori with analytic rational cohomology of type formula_27, which is not projective algebraic. (see appendix B of )

== Known cases of the Hodge conjecture ==
See Theorem 1 of Bouali.
=== Low dimension and codimension ===
The first result on the Hodge conjecture is due to . In fact, it predates the conjecture and provided some of Hodge&#x27;s motivation.

::Theorem (Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes) Any element of formula_28 is the cohomology class of a divisor on formula_29. In particular, the Hodge conjecture is true for formula_30.

A very quick proof can be given using sheaf cohomology and the exponential exact sequence. (The cohomology class of a divisor turns out to equal to its first Chern class.) Lefschetz&#x27;s original proof proceeded by normal functions, which were introduced by Henri Poincaré. However, the Griffiths transversality theorem shows that this approach cannot prove the Hodge conjecture for higher codimensional subvarieties.

By the Hard Lefschetz theorem, one can prove:

::Theorem. If for some formula_31 the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree formula_32, then the Hodge conjecture holds for Hodge classes of degree formula_33.

Combining the above two theorems implies that Hodge conjecture is true for Hodge classes of degree formula_34. This proves the Hodge conjecture when formula_29 has dimension at most three.

The Lefschetz theorem on (1,1)-classes also implies that if all Hodge classes are generated by the Hodge classes of divisors, then the Hodge conjecture is true:

::Corollary. If the algebra formula_36 is generated by formula_37, then the Hodge conjecture holds for formula_29.

=== Hypersurfaces ===
By the strong and weak Lefschetz theorem, the only non-trivial part of the Hodge conjecture for hypersurfaces is the degree &quot;m&quot; part (i.e., the middle cohomology) of a 2&quot;m&quot;-dimensional hypersurface formula_39. If the degree &quot;d&quot; is 2, i.e., &quot;X&quot; is a quadric, the Hodge conjecture holds for all &quot;m&quot;. For formula_40, i.e., fourfolds, the Hodge conjecture is known for formula_41.

=== Abelian varieties ===
For most abelian varieties, the algebra Hdg*(&quot;X&quot;) is generated in degree one, so the Hodge conjecture holds. In particular, the Hodge conjecture holds for sufficiently general abelian varieties, for products of elliptic curves, and for simple abelian varieties of prime dimension. However, constructed an example of an abelian variety where Hdg2(&quot;X&quot;) is not generated by products of divisor classes. generalized this example by showing that whenever the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field, then Hdg2(&quot;X&quot;) is not generated by products of divisor classes. proved that in dimension less than 5, either Hdg*(&quot;X&quot;) is generated in degree one, or the variety has complex multiplication by an imaginary quadratic field. In the latter case, the Hodge conjecture is only known in special cases.

== Generalizations ==

=== The integral Hodge conjecture ===
Hodge&#x27;s original conjecture was:

::Integral Hodge conjecture. Let be a projective complex manifold. Then every cohomology class in formula_42 is the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on 

This is now known to be false. The first counterexample was constructed by . Using K-theory, they constructed an example of a torsion cohomology class—that is, a cohomology class such that for some positive integer —which is not the class of an algebraic cycle. Such a class is necessarily a Hodge class. reinterpreted their result in the framework of cobordism and found many examples of such classes.

The simplest adjustment of the integral Hodge conjecture is:

::Integral Hodge conjecture modulo torsion. Let be a projective complex manifold. Then every cohomology class in formula_42 is the sum of a torsion class and the cohomology class of an algebraic cycle with integral coefficients on 

Equivalently, after dividing formula_42 by torsion classes, every class is the image of the cohomology class of an integral algebraic cycle. This is also false. found an example of a Hodge class which is not algebraic, but which has an integral multiple which is algebraic.

 have shown that in order to obtain a correct integral Hodge conjecture, one needs to replace Chow groups, which can also be expressed as motivic cohomology groups, by a variant known as &quot;étale&quot; (or &quot;Lichtenbaum&quot;) &quot;motivic cohomology&quot;. They show that the rational Hodge conjecture is equivalent to an integral Hodge conjecture for this modified motivic cohomology.

=== The Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties ===
A natural generalization of the Hodge conjecture would ask:

::Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, naive version. Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex Kähler manifold. Then every Hodge class on &quot;X&quot; is a linear combination with rational coefficients of the cohomology classes of complex subvarieties of &quot;X&quot;.

This is too optimistic, because there are not enough subvarieties to make this work. A possible substitute is to ask instead one of the two following questions:

::Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, vector bundle version. Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex Kähler manifold. Then every Hodge class on &quot;X&quot; is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of vector bundles on &quot;X&quot;.
::Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties, coherent sheaf version. Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex Kähler manifold. Then every Hodge class on &quot;X&quot; is a linear combination with rational coefficients of Chern classes of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;.

 proved that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves give strictly more Hodge classes than the Chern classes of vector bundles and that the Chern classes of coherent sheaves are insufficient to generate all the Hodge classes. Consequently, the only known formulations of the Hodge conjecture for Kähler varieties are false.

=== The generalized Hodge conjecture ===
Hodge made an additional, stronger conjecture than the integral Hodge conjecture. Say that a cohomology class on &quot;X&quot; is of &quot;co-level c&quot; (coniveau c) if it is the pushforward of a cohomology class on a &quot;c&quot;-codimensional subvariety of &quot;X&quot;. The cohomology classes of co-level at least &quot;c&quot; filter the cohomology of &quot;X&quot;, and it is easy to see that the &quot;c&quot;th step of the filtration &quot;N&#x27;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z) satisfies

:formula_45

Hodge&#x27;s original statement was:

::Generalized Hodge conjecture, Hodge&#x27;s version. formula_46
 observed that this cannot be true, even with rational coefficients, because the right-hand side is not always a Hodge structure. His corrected form of the Hodge conjecture is:

::Generalized Hodge conjecture. &quot;N&#x27;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Q) is the largest sub-Hodge structure of &quot;H&quot;(&quot;X&quot;, Z) contained in formula_47
This version is open.

== Algebraicity of Hodge loci ==
The strongest evidence in favor of the Hodge conjecture is the algebraicity result of . Suppose that we vary the complex structure of &quot;X&quot; over a simply connected base. Then the topological cohomology of &quot;X&quot; does not change, but the Hodge decomposition does change. It is known that if the Hodge conjecture is true, then the locus of all points on the base where the cohomology of a fiber is a Hodge class is in fact an algebraic subset, that is, it is cut out by polynomial equations. Cattani, Deligne &amp; Kaplan (1995) proved that this is always true, without assuming the Hodge conjecture.

<doc id="244519" wikidata="Q1018601" url="?curid=244519" title="Byron De La Beckwith">
<text>Byron De La Beckwith Jr. (November 9, 1920 – January 21, 2001) was an American white supremacist and member of the Ku Klux Klan who murdered civil rights leader Medgar Evers on June 12, 1963 in Jackson, Mississippi. 

In 1964, he was tried twice on a murder charge in Mississippi. The all-white male juries each ended in hung juries, and De La Beckwith went free. In 1994, based on new evidence, he was tried again. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison, where he eventually died in 2001 at the age of 80.

==Early life and career==
De La Beckwith was born in Sacramento, California, the only child of Byron De La Beckwith Sr., a postmaster for the town of Colusa, and Susan Southworth Yerger. His father died of pneumonia when he was 5 years old. One year later, he and his mother settled in Greenwood, Mississippi, to be near her family. His mother died of lung cancer when De La Beckwith was 12 years old, leaving him orphaned. He was raised by his maternal uncle William Greene Yerger and his wife. They supported De La Beckwith in his educational studies, including one year at The Webb School.

==Military service==
In January 1942, soon after the United States entered World War II, De La Beckwith enlisted in the U.S. Marine Corps. He served as a machine gunner in the Pacific theater. He fought in the Battle of Guadalcanal and was shot in the waist during the Battle of Tarawa. He was honorably discharged in August 1945.

After his return to the United States, De La Beckwith moved to Providence, Rhode Island, where he married Mary Louise Williams. The couple relocated to Mississippi, where they settled in his hometown of Greenwood. They had a son together, Delay De La Beckwith. De La Beckwith and Williams divorced. He later married Thelma Lindsay Neff.

==Career==
De La Beckwith worked as a salesman for most of his life, selling tobacco, fertilizer, wood stoves, and other goods. In 1954, following the United States Supreme Court ruling in &quot;Brown v. Board of Education&quot; that segregated public schools were unconstitutional, he joined his local White Citizens&#x27; Council, which opposed desegregation of schools and businesses. In many areas they threatened and intimidated African Americans working for civil rights, including by economic means. He also became a member of the Ku Klux Klan, another white supremacist organization.

==Murder of Medgar Evers==

On June 12, 1963, at age 42, De La Beckwith murdered NAACP and civil rights leader Medgar Evers shortly after the activist arrived home in Jackson. Evers was the first NAACP field secretary in the state. 

De La Beckwith had positioned himself across the street from Evers&#x27;s home. Using a rifle, he shot Evers in the back. Evers died an hour later, aged 37. Myrlie Evers, his wife, and his three children, James, Reena, and Darrell Evers, were home at the time of the assassination. 

Darrell, who was nine years old at the time, recalled the night: &quot;We were ready to greet him, because every time he came home it was special for us. He was traveling a lot at that time. All of a sudden, we heard a shot. We knew what it was.&quot;

== Trials ==
The state prosecuted De La Beckwith twice for murder in 1964, but both trials ended with hung juries. Mississippi had effectively disenfranchised black voters since 1890. In practice, this also meant they were excluded from serving on juries, whose members were drawn from voter rolls. During the second trial, Ross Barnett, Democratic governor of Mississippi at the time of the assassination, shook hands with De La Beckwith in the courtroom. The White Citizens&#x27; Council paid De La Beckwith&#x27;s legal expenses in both his 1964 trials.

In January 1966, De La Beckwith, along with a number of other members of the White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, was subpoenaed by the House Un-American Activities Committee to testify about Klan activities. Although De La Beckwith gave his name when asked by the committee (other witnesses, such as Samuel Bowers, invoked the Fifth Amendment in response to that question), he answered no other substantive questions. In the following years, De La Beckwith became a leader in the segregationist Phineas Priesthood, an offshoot of the white supremacist Christian Identity movement. The group was known for its hostility toward African Americans, Jews, Catholics, and foreigners.

According to Delmar Dennis, who acted as a key witness for the prosecution at the 1994 trial, De La Beckwith boasted of his role in the death of Medgar Evers at several Ku Klux Klan rallies and similar gatherings in the years following his mistrials. In 1967, he unsuccessfully sought the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for Lieutenant Governor of Mississippi.

In 1969, De La Beckwith&#x27;s previous charges were dismissed. In 1973, informants alerted the Federal Bureau of Investigation that he planned to murder A.I. Botnick, director of the New Orleans-based B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith Anti-Defamation League. The attack was a racially motivated retaliation for comments that Botnick had made about white Southerners and race relations. 

Following several days of surveillance, New Orleans Police Department officers stopped De La Beckwith as he was traveling by car on the Lake Pontchartrain Causeway Bridge to New Orleans. Among the contents of his vehicle were several loaded firearms, a map with highlighted directions to Botnick&#x27;s house, and a dynamite time bomb. On August 1, 1975, De La Beckwith was convicted in Louisiana of conspiracy to commit murder and sentenced to five years in prison. 

After losing his appeal, De La Beckwith was detained in Washington, D.C. for failing to report to prison. He served nearly three years of his five-year sentence at Angola Prison in Louisiana from May 1977 until he was paroled in January 1980. Just before entering prison to serve his sentence, De La Beckwith was ordained by Reverend Dewey &quot;Buddy&quot; Tucker as a minister in the Temple Memorial Baptist Church, a Christian Identity congregation in Knoxville, Tennessee.

In the 1980s, the Jackson &quot;Clarion-Ledger&quot; published reports on its investigation of De La Beckwith&#x27;s trials in the 1960s. It found that the Mississippi State Sovereignty Commission, a state agency supported by taxpayers&#x27; money to purportedly protect the image of the state, had assisted De La Beckwith&#x27;s attorneys in his second trial. The commission had worked against the civil rights movement in numerous ways; for this trial, it used state resources to investigate members of the jury pool during &quot;voir dire&quot; to aid the defense in picking a sympathetic jury. These findings of illegality contributed to the state conducting a new trial of De La Beckwith in 1994.

==1994 trial for Evers murder==
Myrlie Evers, who later became the third woman to chair the NAACP, refused to abandon her husband&#x27;s case. When new documents showed that jurors in the previous case were investigated illegally and screened by a state agency, she pressed authorities to reopen the case. In the 1980s, reporting by Jerry Mitchell of the Jackson &quot;Clarion-Ledger&quot; about the earlier De La Beckwith trials resulted in the state&#x27;s mounting a new investigation. It ultimately initiated a third prosecution, based on this and other new evidence.

By this time, De La Beckwith was living in Walden, Tennessee, just outside Signal Mountain, a suburb of Chattanooga. He was extradited to Mississippi for trial at the Hinds County Courthouse in Jackson. Before his trial, the 71-year-old white supremacist had asked the justices to dismiss the case against him on the grounds that it violated his rights to a speedy trial, due process, and protection from double jeopardy. The Mississippi Supreme Court ruled against his motion by a 4–3 vote, and the case was scheduled to be heard in January 1994.

During this third trial, the murder weapon was presented, a “sporterized” Enfield .30-06 caliber rifle, with De La Beckwith&#x27;s fingerprints. De La Beckwith claimed that the gun was stolen from his house. He listed his health problems, high blood pressure, lack of energy and kidney problems, saying, &quot;I need a list to recite everything I suffer from, and I hate to complain because I&#x27;m not the complaining type&quot;. 

On February 5, 1994, a jury composed of eight African Americans and four whites convicted De La Beckwith of murder for killing Medgar Evers. He was sentenced to life in prison. New evidence included testimony that during the three decades since the crime had occurred, De La Beckwith had boasted on multiple occasions of having committed the murder, including at a KKK rally. The physical evidence was essentially the same as that presented during the first two trials.

De La Beckwith appealed the guilty verdict, but the Mississippi Supreme Court upheld the conviction in 1997. The court said that the 31-year lapse between the murder and De La Beckwith&#x27;s conviction did not deny him a fair trial. De La Beckwith sought judicial review in the United States Supreme Court, but his petition for certiorari was denied.

On January 21, 2001, De La Beckwith died after he was transferred from prison to the University of Mississippi Medical Center in Jackson, Mississippi. He was 80 years old. He had suffered from heart disease, high blood pressure, and other ailments for some time.

==Representation in other media==
* &quot;Where Is the Voice Coming From?&quot; (1963), a short story by Eudora Welty, was published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; on July 6, 1963. Welty, who was from Jackson, Mississippi, later said: &quot;Whoever the murderer is, I know him: not his identity, but his coming about, in this time and place. That is, I ought to have learned by now, from here, what such a man, intent on such a deed, had going on in his mind. I wrote his story—my fiction—in the first person: about that character&#x27;s point of view.&quot; It was published before De La Beckwith&#x27;s arrest. So accurate was her portrayal that the magazine changed several details in the story before publication for legal reasons.

* Byron De La Beckwith was the subject of the 1963 Bob Dylan song &quot;Only a Pawn in Their Game&quot;, which deplores Evers&#x27; murder and attempts to suggest De La Beckwith was &quot;only a pawn in the game&quot;, a poor white man manipulated by Southern politicians.

* In 1991, author William James Royce wrote &quot;Sweet, Sweet Blues&quot;, an episode of the NBC television series &quot;In the Heat of the Night&quot;. It was based on the murder of Evers and first trials of De La Beckwith . Actor James Best plays a character based on De La Beckwith, an aging Klansman who appears to have gotten away with murder.

* The feature film &quot;Ghosts of Mississippi&quot; (1996) tells the story of the murder and 1994 trial. James Woods&#x27;s performance as De La Beckwith was nominated for an Academy Award.

* In 2001, Bobby DeLaughter published his memoir of the case and 1994 trial, &quot;Never Too Late: A Prosecutor’s Story of Justice in the Medgar Evers Trial.&quot;

<text>Siquijor ( , ), officially the Province of Siquijor (; ), is a Philippine island province (the third smallest in the country, in terms of population and land area) located within the Negros Island Region. Its largest town and capital is the municipality of Siquijor. The province lies south of Cebu, southeast of Negros Oriental, southwest of Bohol, and north of Mindanao. 

During the Spanish colonial period of the Philippines, the Spaniards called Siquijor the (Island of Fire), due to the glow of fireflies that swarmed the molave trees.

== Etymology ==
One popular legend says the name &quot;Siquijor&quot; comes from the famed pre-Spanish ruler of the island, King Datu Kihod. Upon the Spaniards&#x27; arrival, Kihod introduced himself by saying &quot;si kihod&quot;, or &quot;I am Kihod&quot;, something which, presumably, the Spanish believed to be in reference to the physical island, thus they named it &quot;Sikihod&quot;. Over time, the name eventually morphed into Siquijor.

Another legend says that a priest who visited the island said to the people, in Bohol, &quot;,&quot; meaning &quot;to follow the waves&quot;; the people misheard this, and assumed the island&#x27;s name to be Siquijor.

&quot;Siquijor&quot; may have also come from the native word &quot;quidjod&quot;, meaning &quot;the tide is going out&quot;.

==History==

===Early history===
According to legend, Siquijor was formed from the sea by a storm and an earthquake in the Visayan region. In modern times, highland farmers have found giant seashells underneath their farm plots to support this legend.

Prior to colonization, Siquijor was once called &quot;Katugasan&quot;, named after the , the molave trees which abounded the island. The native dwellers of the island used these trees to build posts () for their houses because of their strength and durability that could withstand strong typhoons and monsoons. Most of the patriarchs of the island used the to make a wooden plow () to cultivate the rocky soil for farming using mainly male cattle () to pull it through the sticky and hard rocky soil. However, before the discovery of using as the foundations of their houses, the island natives dwelt in caves as shown by the pottery and old tools like stone grinder excavated from the three caves of Sam-ang.

During this time, the people were already in contact with Chinese traders, as seen through archaeological evidence including Chinese ceramics and other objects. The art of traditional healing and traditional witchcraft belief systems also developed within this period. During the arrival of the Spanish, the monarch of the island was Datu Kihod, as recorded in Legazpi&#x27;s chronicles.

===Spanish occupation ===
The island was first sighted by the Spaniards in 1565 during Miguel López de Legazpi&#x27;s expedition. The Spaniards called the island (&quot;Island of Fire&quot;), because the island gave off an eerie glow, from the great swarms of fireflies that lived in the numerous molave trees on the island. Esteban Rodríguez of the Legazpi expedition led the first Spaniards to discover the island. He was captain of a small party that left Legazpi&#x27;s camp in Bohol to explore the nearby islands which are now called Pamilacan, Siquijor, and Negros.

The island, along with the rest of the archipelago, was subsequently annexed to the Spanish Empire. Founded in 1783 under the administration of secular clergymen, Siquijor became the first municipality as well as the first parish to be established on the island. Siquijor was, from the beginning, administered by the Diocese of Cebu. As for civil administration, Siquijor was under Bohol since the province had its own governor. The first Augustinian Recollect priest arrived in Siquijor in 1794. Several years later, a priest of the same order founded the parishes of Larena (initially called ), Lazi (formerly Tigbawan), San Juan (Makalipay), and Maria (). With the exception of Enrique Villanueva, the other five municipalities were established as parishes in 1877. From 1854 to 1892, Siquijor was administered by the politico-military province of Bohol. Later in 1892, it was transferred to Negros Oriental and became its sub-province in 1901.

===American occupation ===
At the turn of the century, Spain ceded the Philippines to the United States of America with the Treaty of Paris that ended the Spanish–American War. Siquijor Island felt the presence of American rule when a unit of the American Cavalry Division came and stayed for some time. The American Military Governor in Manila appointed James Fugate, a scout with the California Volunteers of the U.S. Infantry, to oversee and implement the organization and development programs in Siquijor Island. Governor Fugate stayed for 16 years as lieutenant governor of Siquijor.

===Japanese occupation===
While it was not at the center of military action, Siquijor was not spared by World War II. Imperial Japanese detachments occupied the island between 1942 and 1943, announcing their arrival on the island with heavy shelling. At the outbreak of the war, Siquijor was a sub-province of Negros Oriental, headed by Lieutenant Governor Nicolas Parami. Refusing to pledge allegiance to the Japanese forces, Parami was taken by Japanese soldiers from his residence at Poo, Lazi one evening and brought to the military headquarters in Larena. He was never heard from again. On November 10, 1942, Japanese warships started shelling Lazi from Cangabas Point. In Lazi, a garrison was established in the old Home Economics Building of the Central School. Filipino guerrillas engaged in sabotage and the interaction during this time caused havoc on the Japanese lives and properties.

During this period, Siquijor was briefly governed by Shunzo Suzuki, a Japanese civilian appointed by the Japanese forces until he was assassinated in October 1942 by the guerrilla forces led by Iluminado Jumawanin, of Caipilan, Siquijor. Mamor Fukuda took control of Siquijor from June 1943 until the Japanese forces abandoned the island when the liberation forces came in 1944. In 1943, the Japanese puppet government appointed Sebastian Monera of San Juan as Governor of Siquijor. His administration, however, was cut short when he was executed, presumably by Filipino guerrillas operating in the mountains of Siquijor.

On September 30, 1943, the United States submarine USS &quot;Bowfin&quot; (SS-287) delivered supplies to the people of Siquijor and evacuated people from the island. On February 21, 1945, the destroyer USS &quot;Renshaw&quot; (DD-499) was escorting a convoy of about 50 landing ships with 12 other escorts, when it was attacked by a Japanese midget submarine off the coast of Siquijor, which caused extensive damage to the ship and killed 19 of the crew.

In mid-1945, local Filipino soldiers and officers under the 7th, 75th, and 76th Infantry Division of the Philippine Commonwealth Army arrived, and alongside recognized guerrilla fighter groups, liberated Siquijor.

===Philippine independence===

For a time Siquijor was a subprovince of Negros Oriental, but it became an independent province on September 17, 1971, under &quot;Republic Act 6398&quot;. The move was supported by the people of Siquijor as they have a distinct culture from those of Negros Oriental, while Marcos used the movement as a means to secure support from the people of the island to pave martial law acceptance the following year. The capital, formerly Larena, was transferred to the municipality of Siquijor in 1972 by &quot;Proclamation No. 1075&quot;, under martial law.

===Contemporary===
In 2006, the Lazi Church was added by the government as an extension to the Baroque Churches of the Philippines UNESCO World Heritage Site. The inscription of the church has been pending since.

In 2024, Siquijor was transferred from the Central Visayas Region to the Negros Island Region following the signing of Republic Act No. 12000 by President Bongbong Marcos.

==Geography==
Siquijor is an island province in Negros Island Region. It is located in the Bohol Sea and lies south of Cebu across the Cebu Strait, southeast of Negros, southwest of Bohol, and north of Mindanao. Panglao Island, which is part of Bohol, has a similar soil composition found throughout Siquijor.

With a land area of and a coastline long, Siquijor is the third-smallest province of the Philippines, both in terms of population and land area, after Camiguin and Batanes.

===Topography===

The island lies about east of the nearest point on southern Negros, southeast of Cebu, southwest of Bohol, and north of Zamboanga del Norte in Mindanao. It is predominantly hilly and in many places the hills reach the sea, producing precipitous cliffs. At the center, Mount Malabahoc (locally known as Mount Bandilaan) reaches about in elevation, the highest point on the island. Three marine terraces can be roughly traced around Tagibo, San Juan, on the southwestern part of the island.

Siquijor is a coralline island, and fossils of the giant clam &quot;tridacna&quot; are often encountered in the plowed inland fields. On the hilltops, there are numerous shells of the molluscan species presently living in the seas around the island. Siquijor was probably formed quite recently, geologically speaking. The ocean depths between Siquijor, Bohol, and Mindanao are around .

===Climate===

Siquijor has two different climates, dominated by a tropical monsoon climate. All climate is within Coronas climate type IV, characterised by not very pronounced maximum rainfall with a short dry season from one to three months and a wet season of nine to ten months. The dry season starts in February and lasts through April sometimes extending to midMay.

; 19th Congress of the Philippines
The lone legislative district of Siquijor is the representation of the province in various national legislatures. The current representative is Zaldy S. Villa of PDP-Laban.

==Demographics==
According to the 2020 census, Siquijor has a population of 103,395. The average annual growth rate between 2000 and 2015 was , lower than the national growth rate of for the same period.

===Languages===
The main language spoken in Siquijor is Cebuano, with Tagalog and English often used as second languages. Tagalog is understood and used as the national &quot;lingua franca&quot;, but it is rarely used in everyday conversation among locals.

===Religion===

95% of the island&#x27;s residents belong to the Catholic Church, while the remainder belong to various other Christian churches. Despite the province&#x27;s Catholic affinities, almost all of the residents continue to adhere to traditional practices that were used prior to the 15th century, albeit these practices have also adopted Christian belief systems as well. Due to the ingrained and indispensable traditional belief systems, the majority of residents have continued to possess a high respect for the natural environment which was revered by the ancestors of the people. Siquijor is known for its unique Philippine culture of blending Catholicism with traditional religious practices – a major part of its people&#x27;s cultural heritage and identity.

===Education===

The literacy rate of 92.5% is one of the highest in the country. The Siquijor State College located in Larena is the only state college in the province.

==Economy==
==Tourism==

Siquijor has long been associated with pre-Spanish traditions centered around self-help, mysticism, shamanism, and natural healing rituals, something the island&#x27;s growing tourism industry thoroughly capitalizes on; for example, there is the &quot;Healing and Wellness Tour&quot;, an officially-guided ceremony and experience for (paying) visitors to experience ancient meditative and cleansing procedures, ridding themselves of negative energies. Despite any negative reviews, the experience is reportedly harmless, and simply involves the application of herbs, with smoke and incense being burned, while meditating and being guided by a shamanic healer. There are also a number of other options for spiritual retreats for wealthy tourists looking to &quot;escape&quot; from the day-to-day, or to purify themselves of negativity in a non-medical, non-mainstream way. 

Nonetheless, official signage is placed around the island, upon which a portrait of the governor is seen, assuring visitors that &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;witchcraft&quot; does not exist, nor has it ever existed, on Siquijor. It is reported that certain elderly or superstitious individuals, even to this day, view the island as cursed and will not set foot there or utter its name for fear of bad luck. The island&#x27;s enduring reputation as a site of pre-colonial &quot;magic&quot; and &quot;sorcery&quot; has attracted its fair share of interested visitors, and also has earned it the scorn and condemnation of others, primarily very religious (Catholic and other Christian) groups, who view self-help and &quot;natural&quot; healing to be &quot;blasphemous&quot;, as it may be seen as a human attempt to &quot;become&quot; or imitate the works of God. 

Besides the mystical attractions, nature abounds on Siquijor, and the many ecological and geographical attractions include pristine beaches, waterfalls, coral reef diving, caves, plant and animal life. The coral reefs ringing the island offer some of the best diving in the Philippines for snorkelers and scuba divers. Dive courses are conducted by several dive operators on the island, in the formats of PADI, CMAS*, and NAUI. Two of the most popular natural attractions are Cambugahay Falls and the centuries-old Balete, a species of endemic &quot;Ficus&quot; tree, both located in Lazi.

<text>Juan Terry Trippe (June 27, 1899 – April 3, 1981) was an American commercial aviation pioneer, entrepreneur and the founder of Pan American World Airways, one of the iconic airlines of the 20th century. He was involved in the introduction of the Sikorsky S-42, which opened trans-Pacific airline travel, the Boeing 307 Stratoliner which introduced cabin pressurization to airline operations, the Boeing 707 which started a new era in low cost jet transportation, and the Boeing 747 jumbo jets. Trippe&#x27;s signing of the 747 contract coincided with the 50th anniversary of Boeing. He also founded InterContinental Hotels &amp; Resorts.

==Early life and education==
Trippe was born in Sea Bright, New Jersey, on June 27, 1899, the great-great-grandson of Lieutenant John Trippe, captain of the . Because he was named &quot;Juan&quot;, he is widely assumed to have been of Hispanic descent, but his family was actually Northern European in ancestry and settled in Maryland in 1664. He was named after Juanita Terry, the Venezuelan wife of his great uncle. Trippe attended the Bovea School and graduated from The Hill School in 1917.

He enrolled at Yale University but left to apply for flight training with the United States Navy when the United States entered World War I. After completing training in June 1918, he was designated as a Naval Aviator and was commissioned as an Ensign in the United States Navy Reserve. However, the end of World War I precluded him from flying in combat. Demobilized from active duty, he returned to Yale, graduating in 1921. While there, he was a member of St. Anthony Hall and of the Skull and Bones society. Trippe was treasurer at the first meeting of the National Intercollegiate Flying Association in 1920.

==Career==

After graduating from Yale, Trippe began working on Wall Street, but soon became bored. In 1922 he raised money from his old Yale classmates, selling them stock in his new airline, an air-taxi service for the rich and powerful called Long Island Airways. Once again tapping his wealthy friends from Yale, Trippe invested in an airline named Colonial Air Transport, which was awarded a new route and an airmail contract on October 7, 1925. Interested in operating to the Caribbean, Trippe created the Aviation Corporation of the Americas. Based in Florida, the company would evolve into the unofficial United States flag carrier, Pan American Airways, commonly known as Pan Am.

Pan Am&#x27;s first flight took off on October 19, 1927, from Key West, Florida, to Havana, Cuba, in a hired Fairchild FC-2 floatplane being delivered to West Indian Aerial Express in the Dominican Republic. The return flight from Havana to Key West, in a Pan Am Fokker F.VII, took place October 29, being delayed from October 28 by rain.

Later, Trippe bought the China National Aviation Corporation (CNAC) to provide domestic air service in the Republic of China, and became a partner in Panagra. In the 1930s. Pan Am became the first airline to cross the Pacific Ocean with the China Clipper.

Trippe served as the chairman of the board of directors of the airline for all but about two years between the founding of the company and World War II. &quot;Sonny&quot; Whitney, a stockholder, managed to seize this position. He later regretted his action and allowed Trippe to retake it. For a long time Trippe refused to pardon Whitney. At one point, he even agreed to meet Whitney for lunch for a reconciliation, but changed his mind and turned around shortly after departing from his office in the Chrysler Building.
Pan Am continued to expand worldwide throughout World War II. Trippe is responsible for several innovations in the airline world. A firm believer in the idea of air travel for all, Trippe is credited as the father of the &quot;tourist class&quot; in the airline industry, and was the driving force behind Pan Am&#x27;s formation of the InterContinental hotel group.

Trippe quickly recognized the opportunities presented by jet aircraft and ordered several Boeing 707 and Douglas DC-8 airplanes. Pan Am&#x27;s first scheduled jet flight was operated on October 26, 1958, by 707 &quot;Clipper America&quot; from Idlewild International Airport (now JFK) to Le Bourget Airport, Paris. The new jets allowed Pan Am to cut the flight time nearly in half, introduce lower fares, and fly more passengers in total.

In 1965, Trippe asked his friend Bill Allen at Boeing to produce an airplane much larger than the 707. The result was the Boeing 747, and Pan Am was the first customer. Originally, Trippe believed the 747 would ultimately be destined to haul cargo only and would be replaced by faster, supersonic aircraft which were then being developed. The supersonic airliners failed to materialize, with the exception of the Concorde and Tupolev Tu-144, and the 747 became an iconic image of international travel. In 1965, Trippe received the Tony Jannus Award for his distinguished contributions to commercial aviation.

Trippe gave up the presidency of the airline in 1968. He continued to attend meetings of the board of directors and maintained an office in the company&#x27;s Park Avenue office tower.

==Personal life==
Trippe was a member of The Royal and Ancient Golf Club of St Andrews in Scotland and president of the Maidstone Club in East Hampton, New York, from 1940 to 1944.

Trippe married Elizabeth &quot;Betty&quot; Stettinius Trippe (1904–1983), the sister of United States Secretary of State Edward R. Stettinius Jr., in 1928. They had four children. The couple remained married until Trippe&#x27;s death in 1981.

==Death and legacy==
Trippe suffered a stroke in September 1980, which forced him to cut back on his workload; he died after suffering a second stroke at his New York City home on April 3, 1981, at the age of 81. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn.

In 1970, Juan Trippe was inducted into the National Aviation Hall of Fame in Dayton, Ohio.

In 1985, Trippe was posthumously awarded the Medal of Freedom by United States President Ronald Reagan. Trippe was inducted into the Junior Achievement U.S. Business Hall of Fame in 1990. An endowed chair at the Yale University School of Management is the &quot;Juan Trippe Professor in the Practice of International Trade, Finance, and Business&quot;.

In 1982, Trippe was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame at the San Diego Air &amp; Space Museum.

Trippe is widely regarded as the last of the greatest aviation pioneers along with industry titans such as American Airlines&#x27; C. R. Smith, United Airlines&#x27; William A. &quot;Pat&quot; Patterson, Eastern Airlines&#x27; Eddie Rickenbacker, TWA&#x27;s Howard Hughes and Delta Air Lines&#x27; Collett E. Woolman. Under his control, Pan American World Airways became the premier international airline in the world. He is also credited as playing an instrumental role in the development of an intercontinental version of the Boeing 707 and the Douglas DC-8 as Trippe&#x27;s determination to get a jet that could cross the Atlantic was instrumental not only in Douglas developing a long-range DC-8, but also Boeing&#x27;s famed 707 as they had to redesign it to stay competitive with Douglas.

==In popular culture==
A character based on Trippe was played by Pat O&#x27;Brien in Ray Enright&#x27;s 1936 film &quot;The China Clipper&quot;. Trippe was played by Alec Baldwin in Martin Scorsese&#x27;s 2004 film &quot;The Aviator&quot;.

<text>&quot;Budugu&quot; is a fictional character created by Mullapudi Venkata Ramana of Andhra Pradesh in India. &quot;Budugu&quot; was the childhood nickname of Ramana. His sister was called &quot;Budigi&quot;.

Budugu is a precocious and bratty child, characterized by his inimitably childish Telugu. Mullapudi describes the world as seen through his eyes with humor. Budugu has an opinion about everything. He talks about culture, raising children, politicians and the 13th table. His lifetime ambition is to become a horse-cart driver or a train driver.

Budugu&#x27;s immediate family include his parents Radha and Gopalam, his grandmother Bamma, and his unmarried uncle Baabai. His neighbors include Laavupaati Pakkinti Pinnigaru and her husband and Budugu&#x27;s child love C Gaana Pasoonamba.

&quot;Budugu – Chichuta Pidugu&quot; is the name of the serial (published by Andhra Pathrika) in which Mullapudi introduces Budugu. The work is autobiographical in nature, where the author describes his childhood thoughts and happenings. The rest is all in the spirit of imagination. This collection later appeared in two volumes.

The drawings of Budugu are by Bapu, a maker of Telugu films. Bapu focuses on capturing the characters&#x27; expressions.

Budugu is a pet name for the child and was later used for a whole generation of children in Andhra Pradesh.

<text>Mullapudi Venkata Ramana (28 June 1931 – 24 February 2011) was an Indian writer known for his work in Telugu language. Noted for his humorous and metaphorical style of writing, Mullapudi received Raghupathi Venkaiah Award from the Government of Andhra Pradesh in 1986 for his contributions to Telugu cinema and he also won six Nandi Awards.

Mullapudi is noted for his association with Bapu, who both worked together as Bapu–Ramana. The director–writer duo went onto make many successful films such as &quot;Bangaru Pichika&quot; (1968), &quot;Andala Ramudu&quot; (1973), &quot;Sampoorna Ramayanam&quot; (1973), &quot;Mutyala Muggu&quot; (1975), &quot;Pelli Pustakam&quot; (1993), &quot;Mister Pellam&quot; (1995), and &quot;Radha Gopalam&quot; (2005). He is also an essayist and cartoonist who is known for creating Budugu, a character considered as a corner stone for Telugu children&#x27;s literature.

== Early life ==
Mullapudi Venkata Ramana was born in middle-class traditional family and his childhood mostly spent in a tiny village called Dowleswaram near Rajahmundry, Andhra Pradesh. Mullapudi had one elder sister and a younger brother. It was a happy family with no troubles until his father expired when Mullapudi was 9 years old. This turned their status upside down and they shifted to Chennai (called Madras in those days) for better opportunities. Mullapudi&#x27;s mother Mrs. Adilakshmi took all the pains to raise the family in such situation. Mullapudi&#x27;s education and career happened in Madras. During his study days, he had shown penchant for literature in Telugu and inclination in writing up short, effective storylines.

During the same period, he got a good friend in &#x27;Bapu&#x27;. Their friendship was unconditional and mutually expending talents as Mullapudi is good at write-ups whereas Bapu is good at painting and caricature drawing. Soon they excelled in their talents and gave some of the most admirable Telugu films later in their life.

&quot;Katha Ramaneeyam&#x27; Part-1&quot; having around 40 stories off 8 chapters each of them representing one of Navarasams (Nine emotions each human has). Some of them were made Films later viz. Seetha Kalyanam, Bhogimanta, Swayamvaram etc..

&quot;Katha Ramaneeyam&#x27; Part-2&quot; having about 45 stories some of which representing Indian middle-class&#x27; tryst with life in hilarious way. While others pointing out the superstitions in our society, treatment of underprivileged in society which are definitely thought provoking.

&quot;Runanandalahiri&quot; is representation of average Indians, leading life in the times of inflation, joblessness, less privileged society and their tryst with their lives&#x27; problems. Mullapudi himself suffered such upsets in his life and even frank enough that some characters inspired from his own sufferings but dealt with in a humorous way.

==Career==
After completing SSLC in Madras, Mullapudi had to do many odd jobs before starting as a reporter for then-popular newspaper &quot;Andhra Patrika&quot; in 1953. Here he got the opportunity to interact with eminent writers of Telugu literature like Nanduri Ramamohana Rao, Pilaka Ganapati Sastri, Surampudi Seetaram etc. who were working for the same newspaper.

Sri. Mullapudi was first working for the &quot;Daily&quot; section of the newspaper and then shifted to &quot;Weekly&quot; section. While working here, his stories for children in the name of &#x27;Budugu&#x27; (lil kid) were published and became very popular. He authored these stories to present the views of the little kids off their elders in the family. These stories are humorous, informative, knowledgeable to children and at the same time helping the elderly to know the thought process of their kids. Later, these stories were published in the form of a book, which was well received.

While writing for the &quot;Cinema Page&quot; section in the paper, Mullapudi&#x27;s short and crisp writing helped him to gain popularity for his film reviews. That was the same time when he got introduced to film industry and befriended the famous stars of film fraternity. He got introduced to some great directors of those times, Adurthi SubbaRao and Dundi, who encouraged him to work for films. &quot;RakthaSambandam&quot; was his first break as a writer; since then he never lagged in his progress as story, screenplay, dialogue writer.

===Films===

Mullapudi&#x27;s writing talent highlighted with his movie reviews and stories he wrote for films. Some of the initial films for story, screenplay dialogue &quot;Velugu needalu&quot;, &quot;Kanney manasulu&quot; were runaway hits, that has kept Mullapudi in good stead. &quot;Mooga manasulu&quot;, &quot;Bharya Bharthalu&quot;, &quot;Velugu Needalu&quot; and &quot;Teney manasulu&quot; have firmly established him as story writer. Some of these films had ANR (Akkineni NageswarRao) in the lead and their association brought their talent to the fore.

Soon, he became sought after film story writer and gave up his journalist job at &quot;Andhra Patrika&quot;. He partnered with his childhood friend Bapu and co-produced their first film &quot;Sakshi&quot; featuring actor Krishna which got accolades for its storyline and direction.

&quot;Bhakta Kannappa&quot; (great disciple of &#x27;Lord Siva&#x27;) with actor Krishnam Raju, who was till then doing villain roles, was a huge hit and gave him stardom. However, the milestone in his career is &quot;Sampurna Ramayanam&quot; (Ramayan epic) which featured Shoban Babu as Lord Rama turned out to be a major hit and is a masterpiece of Telugu films which is the best representation of the epic &#x27;Ramayana&#x27; till today. The music of this film is ever popular and is played in festivals and functions.

===Association with Bapu===

Mullapudi&#x27;s association with Bapu has a 60-year career plan. They first met in 1942 in P.S. High School, Madras where they studied V and VI level and then continued schooling at Kesari High School. Mullapudi&#x27;s first short story &quot;Amma Maata Vinakapothe&quot; was published in 1945 in &quot;Bala&quot;, a children&#x27;s magazine published by Radio Annayya (Nyayapathi Raghava Rao). He was 14 then. Bapu illustrated the story. His paintings were liked and that was the beginning of their long-standing association.

While Bapu achieved much of his fame sticking to a subtle style of artistic elegance, Mullapudi announced his entry through a bunch of talkative characters, who try to make no sense out of the sensible world around them, because of their askew point of view. Beginning as an illustrator-story writer team and then turning into a film-director-writer duo, they have contributed immensely to the enrichment of Telugu cultural ethos through literature and cinema

Mullapudi provided an able foil, providing script/dialogue that suited Bapu&#x27;s visuals and this celebrated friendship and professional association made some very meaningful social films that were decent hits like &quot;Radha Kalyanam&quot;, &quot;Vamsa Vruksham&quot;, &quot;Pelli Pustakam&quot;, &quot;Mr. Pellam&quot;, &quot;Sundarakanda&quot;, and &quot;Radhaagopalam&quot;.

&quot;MuthyalaMuggu&quot; is one of the path-breaking films of yesteryear as the characters and story are even relevant today. This film launched Ravu Gopalarao in a negative role who soon became most sought-after actor in negative roles for next 20 years. The dialogues by Mullapudi were a runaway hit with all generations alike and popular even now.

Mullapudi translated the Thiruppavai written by the Tamil Vaishnavite saint Andal into Telugu as &quot;Melupalukula Melukolupu.&quot; This translation used Bapu&#x27;s illustrations for each translated verse.

===Television===

During the years 1985–90, Mullapudi and Bapu made videos for school subjects for children on television. At the behest of then the chief minister of Andhra Pradesh Dr. N.T RamaRao, Bapu-Ramana made these education videos which were aired by Doordarshan in Telugu were very popular. The same were later dubbed and aired by National Doordarshan. A.R. Rahaman, the present day music maestro, was then an upcoming drummer, providing background music for few of these videos.

In this millennium, the magic of the Bapu-Ramana combination provided their expertise for the mega mythology serial &quot;Bhagavatham&quot; on ETV. Etv Sri Bhagavatam serial cast : Arun Govil as Dasavatara and Maha Vishnu, Sunil Kumar Sharma as Rama and Krishna, Gargi Roy Chaudhury as Sita and Rukhmini, Sharmilee Raj as SatyaBhama and Bhudevi, Bhavana as Jambavati, Sana as Yashodha, AVS as Narada, etc.. It was well received by audience and firmly scaled up TRPs for the channel. Also directed Sri Venkateswara Vaibhavam for SVBC-TTD Channel by Bapu Ramana with SaiKiran, Mounica, Ashmita.

==Autobiography==

&quot;Kothi Kommachi&quot;, &quot;Inkothi Kommachi&quot; and &quot;Mukkothi Kommachi&quot; are Mullapudi&#x27;s three-volume autobiography in books and audio forms. Just like the titles, the story keep hopping timelines and incidents. To put it in Mullapudi&#x27;s own words, &quot;it is like a monkey hopping from one branch to another branch.&quot;

==Awards==

Though Mullapudis&#x27; career has many faces – journalist, story teller, film critic, film story writer, dialogue writer and a popular film personality who represented a genre that produced the finest work in film arts, literature, journalism – many are dissatisfied that he has not been nominated for Padma awards, instituted by Government of India. His humble background and disinclination to associate with any political party could have been the reason for this.

However, he received endless appreciation of the Telugu people for his excellent work and has made a respectable place in their hearts. He is one of those who kept the flag of Telugu pride flying high.

<text>John William Waterhouse (baptised 6 April 184910 February 1917) was an English painter known for working first in the Academic style and for then embracing the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood&#x27;s style and subject matter. His paintings are known for their depictions of women from both ancient Greek mythology and Arthurian legend. A high proportion depict a single young and beautiful woman in a historical costume and setting, though there are some ventures into Orientalist painting and genre painting, still mostly featuring women. 

Born in Rome to English parents who were both painters, Waterhouse later moved to London, where he enrolled in the Royal Academy of Art Schools. He soon began exhibiting at their annual summer exhibitions, focusing on the creation of large canvas works depicting scenes from the daily life and mythology of ancient Greece. Many of his paintings are based on authors such as Homer, Ovid, Shakespeare, Tennyson, or Keats.

Waterhouse&#x27;s work is displayed in many major art museums and galleries, and the Royal Academy of Art organised a major retrospective of his work in 2009.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Waterhouse was born in the city of Rome to the English painters William and Isabella Waterhouse in 1849, in the same year that the members of the Pre-Raphaelite Brotherhood, including Dante Gabriel Rossetti, John Everett Millais and William Holman Hunt, were first causing a stir in the London art scene. The exact date of his birth is unknown, though he was baptised on 6 April, and the later scholar of Waterhouse&#x27;s work, Peter Trippi, believed that he was born between 1 and 23 January. His early life in Italy has been cited as one of the reasons many of his later paintings were set in ancient Rome or based upon scenes taken from Roman mythology.

In 1854, the Waterhouses returned to England and moved to a newly built house in South Kensington, London, which was near to the newly founded Victoria and Albert Museum. Waterhouse, or &#x27;Nino&#x27; as he was nicknamed, coming from an artistic family, was encouraged to become involved in drawing, and often sketched artworks that he found in the British Museum and the National Gallery. In 1871, he entered the Royal Academy of Art school, initially to study sculpture, before moving on to painting.

===Early career===

Waterhouse&#x27;s early works were not Pre-Raphaelite in nature, but were of classical themes in the spirit of Alma-Tadema and Frederic Leighton. These early works were exhibited at the Dudley Gallery, and the Society of British Artists, and in 1874 his painting &quot;Sleep and his Half-brother Death&quot; was exhibited at the Royal Academy summer exhibition. The painting was a success and Waterhouse would exhibit at the annual exhibition every year until 1916, with the exception of 1890 and 1915. He then went from strength to strength in the London art scene, his 1876 piece &quot;After the Dance&quot; being given the prime position in that year&#x27;s summer exhibition. Perhaps due to his success, his paintings typically became larger.

===Later career===
In 1883, Waterhouse married Esther Kenworthy, the daughter of an art schoolmaster from Ealing who had exhibited her own flower-paintings at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. In 1895 Waterhouse was elected to the status of full Academician. He taught at the St. John&#x27;s Wood Art School, joined the St John&#x27;s Wood Arts Club, and served on the Royal Academy Council.

One of Waterhouse&#x27;s best known subjects is &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot;, a study of Elaine of Astolat as depicted in the 1832 poem by Alfred, Lord Tennyson, who dies of a mysterious curse after looking directly at the beautiful Lancelot. He actually painted three different versions of this character, in 1888, 1894, and 1916. Another of Waterhouse&#x27;s favorite subjects was Ophelia; the most familiar of his paintings of Ophelia depicts her just before her death, putting flowers in her hair as she sits on a tree branch leaning over a lake. Like &quot;The Lady of Shalott&quot; and other Waterhouse paintings, it deals with a woman dying in or near water. He may also have been inspired by paintings of Ophelia by Dante Gabriel Rossetti and John Everett Millais. 
He submitted his 1888 &quot;Ophelia&quot; painting in order to receive his diploma from the Royal Academy. (He had originally wanted to submit a painting titled &quot;A Mermaid&quot;, but it was not completed in time.) After this, the painting was lost until the 20th century. It is now displayed in the collection of Lord Lloyd-Webber. Waterhouse would paint Ophelia again in 1894 and 1909 or 1910, and he planned another painting in the series, called &quot;Ophelia in the Churchyard&quot;.

Waterhouse could not finish the series of Ophelia paintings because he was gravely ill with cancer by 1915. He died two years later, and his grave can be found at Kensal Green Cemetery in London.

==Gallery==
In total, he produced 118 paintings. See List of paintings by John William Waterhouse for an almost complete list.

<doc id="244541" wikidata="Q1260803" url="?curid=244541" title="Rank of an abelian group">
<text>In mathematics, the rank, Prüfer rank, or torsion-free rank of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; is the cardinality of a maximal linearly independent subset. The rank of &quot;A&quot; determines the size of the largest free abelian group contained in &quot;A&quot;. If &quot;A&quot; is torsion-free then it embeds into a vector space over the rational numbers of dimension rank &quot;A&quot;. For finitely generated abelian groups, rank is a strong invariant and every such group is determined up to isomorphism by its rank and torsion subgroup. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 have been completely classified. However, the theory of abelian groups of higher rank is more involved.

The term rank has a different meaning in the context of elementary abelian groups.

== Definition ==

A subset {&quot;a&quot;&quot;α&quot;} of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; is linearly independent (over Z) if the only linear combination of these elements that is equal to zero is trivial: if

: formula_1

where all but finitely many coefficients &quot;n&quot;&quot;α&quot; are zero (so that the sum is, in effect, finite), then all coefficients are zero. Any two maximal linearly independent sets in &quot;A&quot; have the same cardinality, which is called the rank of &quot;A&quot;.

The rank of an abelian group is analogous to the dimension of a vector space. The main difference with the case of vector space is a presence of torsion. An element of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; is classified as torsion if its order is finite. The set of all torsion elements is a subgroup, called the torsion subgroup and denoted &quot;T&quot;(&quot;A&quot;). A group is called torsion-free if it has no non-trivial torsion elements. The factor-group &quot;A&quot;/&quot;T&quot;(&quot;A&quot;) is the unique maximal torsion-free quotient of &quot;A&quot; and its rank coincides with the rank of &quot;A&quot;.

The notion of rank with analogous properties can be defined for modules over any integral domain, the case of abelian groups corresponding to modules over Z. For this, see finitely generated module#Generic rank.

== Properties ==

* The rank of an abelian group &quot;A&quot; coincides with the dimension of the Q-vector space &quot;A&quot; ⊗ Q. If &quot;A&quot; is torsion-free then the canonical map &quot;A&quot; → &quot;A&quot; ⊗ Q is injective and the rank of &quot;A&quot; is the minimum dimension of Q-vector space containing &quot;A&quot; as an abelian subgroup. In particular, any intermediate group Z&quot;n&quot; &lt; &quot;A&quot; &lt; Q&quot;n&quot; has rank &quot;n&quot;.
* Abelian groups of rank 0 are exactly the periodic abelian groups.
* The group Q of rational numbers has rank 1. Torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1 are realized as subgroups of Q and there is a satisfactory classification of them up to isomorphism. By contrast, there is no satisfactory classification of torsion-free abelian groups of rank 2.
* Rank is additive over short exact sequences: if

::formula_2

:is a short exact sequence of abelian groups then rk &quot;B&quot; = rk &quot;A&quot; + rk &quot;C&quot;. This follows from the flatness of Q and the corresponding fact for vector spaces.

* Rank is additive over arbitrary direct sums:

::formula_3

: where the sum in the right hand side uses cardinal arithmetic.

== Groups of higher rank ==

Abelian groups of rank greater than 1 are sources of interesting examples. For instance, for every cardinal &quot;d&quot; there exist torsion-free abelian groups of rank &quot;d&quot; that are indecomposable, i.e. cannot be expressed as a direct sum of a pair of their proper subgroups. These examples demonstrate that torsion-free abelian group of rank greater than 1 cannot be simply built by direct sums from torsion-free abelian groups of rank 1, whose theory is well understood. Moreover, for every integer formula_4, there is a torsion-free abelian group of rank formula_5 that is simultaneously a sum of two indecomposable groups, and a sum of &quot;n&quot; indecomposable groups. Hence even the number of indecomposable summands of a group of an even rank greater or equal than 4 is not well-defined.

Another result about non-uniqueness of direct sum decompositions is due to A.L.S. Corner: given integers formula_6, there exists a torsion-free abelian group &quot;A&quot; of rank &quot;n&quot; such that for any partition formula_7 into &quot;k&quot; natural summands, the group &quot;A&quot; is the direct sum of &quot;k&quot; indecomposable subgroups of ranks formula_8. Thus the sequence of ranks of indecomposable summands in a certain direct sum decomposition of a torsion-free abelian group of finite rank is very far from being an invariant of &quot;A&quot;.

Other surprising examples include torsion-free rank 2 groups &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot; and &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot;,&quot;m&quot; such that &quot;A&quot;&quot;n&quot; is isomorphic to &quot;B&quot;&quot;n&quot; if and only if &quot;n&quot; is divisible by &quot;m&quot;.

For abelian groups of infinite rank, there is an example of a group &quot;K&quot; and a subgroup &quot;G&quot; such that 
* &quot;K&quot; is indecomposable; 
* &quot;K&quot; is generated by &quot;G&quot; and a single other element; and 
* Every nonzero direct summand of &quot;G&quot; is decomposable.

==Generalization==
The notion of rank can be generalized for any module &quot;M&quot; over an integral domain &quot;R&quot;, as the dimension over &quot;R&quot;0, the quotient field, of the tensor product of the module with the field:
::formula_9
It makes sense, since &quot;R&quot;0 is a field, and thus any module (or, to be more specific, vector space) over it is free.

It is a generalization, since every abelian group is a module over the integers. It easily follows that the dimension of the product over Q is the cardinality of maximal linearly independent subset, since for any torsion element &quot;x&quot; and any rational &quot;q&quot;,
::formula_10

<doc id="244543" wikidata="Q757313" url="?curid=244543" title="Frieza">
<text>, also spelled as Freeza in Funimation&#x27;s English subtitles and Viz Media&#x27;s release of the manga, is a fictional character and one of the main antagonists of the &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; manga series created by Akira Toriyama. He makes his debut in Chapter #247: &quot;Dark Clouds Swirl Over Planet Namek&quot;, first published in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine on October 24, 1989, as the main antagonist of his eponymous saga, depicted as a galactic tyrant feared as the most powerful being in the universe.

Despite not appearing until the manga&#x27;s second half, Frieza is widely considered to be the most iconic and popular villain in &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;, and the archenemy of Goku – since he effectively catalyzes many of the events depicted in the story, due to the destruction of the Saiyan homeworld Planet Vegeta at his hands and Goku&#x27;s arrival on Earth and subsequent conflicts with Raditz, Nappa and Vegeta. Frieza later appears as the primary villain in the 2015 film &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot; and as a recurring character in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;.

== Creation and conception ==
Frieza, a broker who forcibly takes over planets to resell them, often rendering the planet&#x27;s population extinct first, was created around the time of the Japanese economic bubble and was inspired by real estate speculators, whom Toriyama called the &quot;worst kind of people.&quot; Toriyama purposely does not draw bad guys so unscrupulous that it affects one psychologically, although he admits Frieza is close. Therefore, he paid special attention to how Frieza spoke; because villains typically speak rudely, he gave him polite speech making for an unsettling contrast with his cruelty. The character&#x27;s name is a pun on freezer, and because of this, his minions and the members of the Ginyu Force are named after fruits and dairy products, items one would normally put in a refrigerator. The &quot;Shenlong Times&quot; issue #2, a bonus pamphlet given to some buyers of the &quot;Daizenshuu 2: Story Guide&quot; guidebook, says that Frieza was modeled after Toriyama&#x27;s editor at the time, Yū Kondō.

Toriyama had the idea to bring Frieza back while attending a concert by the metal band Maximum the Hormone. It came to him while watching them perform their 2008 song &quot;F&quot;, which is about the fictional character.

Toriyama revealed that he did not think to have Frieza transform until about midway through. He said he has a habit of making characters gradually more tough and complex-looking, until finally making them very sleek, as it is a pain to draw them if their appearance is too complex. The author confirmed this is why Frieza&#x27;s third and most intricate form is only shown for a short time, and joked that three transformations might be one too many.

=== Voice actors ===
In the original Japanese version, Frieza is voiced by Ryūsei Nakao in every single piece of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; media.

In English, Frieza was voiced by Pauline Newstone in the Ocean dub of &quot;Dragon Ball Z.&quot; In Funimation&#x27;s in-house English dub, Frieza was voiced by Linda Young in the &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; series and continued playing him in all subsequent media up until the first episode of &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;. Christopher Ayres voiced the character in later episodes of &quot;Kai&quot; and all subsequent media through &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. Due to being diagnosed with end-stage COPD (chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) and requiring a double lung transplant, Ayres was forced to step down from the role in 2018. He briefly reprised the role in 2019 for &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot; and the home media releases of the Universal Survival Saga of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; before passing away in 2021. Ayres&#x27; understudy Daman Mills, who has a strong ability to imitate Ayres, assumed the role, beginning with the television broadcast of the Universal Survival Saga, and has voiced Frieza indefinitely in all subsequent appearances, with the exception of &quot;Broly&quot;.

==Appearances==
===&quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;===
Before the start of the series, Frieza destroys Planet Vegeta out of both fear of a potential uprising by the Saiyans due to their increasing power, and the prophecy of the coming of the legendary Super Saiyan and Lord Beerus telling and instigating him to destroy planet Vegeta. Frieza only knowingly spares Vegeta, Nappa, and Raditz, who were away on a mission when he blew Planet Vegeta up, after telling them it was struck by a meteor. However, when Bardock made a final stand when Frieza destroyed Planet Vegeta, he did not notice the Saiyan&#x27;s second son being sent to Earth, where he became known as Goku.

Frieza makes his official appearance in the story after Vegeta&#x27;s defeat on Earth at Goku&#x27;s hands, having traveled to Planet Namek to find the seven Namekian Dragon Balls to wish for immortality. He and his men massacre Namekian villages one after another, until Gohan, Krillin, and Vegeta begin to hamper his efforts in their way. Though Frieza manages to gain the Dragon Balls, with the Ginyu Force dealing with the interlopers, his inability to speak Namekian forces him to find the Great Elder of Namek. Frieza ends up fighting Namekian warrior Nail, whom he beats repeatedly until Nail reveals that their fight was only to buy time for Dende to give the words needed to activate the Namekian Dragon Balls, for the warriors from Earth. With his entire army killed by Vegeta and the Ginyu Force defeated by Goku, Frieza intercepts Vegeta and the others personally.

Enraged to find he is too late, as the Dragon Balls have become inert on Guru&#x27;s death, Frieza briefly battles Vegeta, with the Saiyan Prince goading him into transforming and revealing his true power. Frieza transforms into his second form, and during the battle, he finally admits to being the one who had destroyed the planet where the Saiyans had settled. After defeating Vegeta, Frieza takes on Piccolo, who has at this point fused with Nail. Although Piccolo appears to be even with him, he transforms into his third form and dominates the powerful Namekian. Following a brief tussle with Gohan, Frieza decides to transform into his final form. He kills Dende to stop him from healing the others and mortally wounds Vegeta just as Goku arrives, who just recovered following his fight with the Ginyu Force. Frieza fights Goku and the two seem evenly matched, but Frieza powers up to 50% of his maximum power and brutally beats him; however, Goku manages to seriously wound the tyrant with a Spirit Bomb. In retaliation, Frieza critically injures Piccolo and kills Krillin, which sends Goku into a rage, consequently assuming Super Saiyan form for the first time. Goku takes the upper hand and viciously pummels Frieza, who damages the core of Namek in an act of desperation, knowing he can survive in the vacuum of space. The tyrant then uses 100% of his power and briefly regains the advantage, but his power level begins to drop and he is again outclassed by Goku and ultimately sliced in half by one of his own attacks. Though Goku spares the crippled Frieza while leaving for his ship to escape the planet&#x27;s destruction, Frieza attempts to blast Goku from behind, prompting Goku to retaliate with his own attack that apparently destroys Frieza.

However, Frieza survives both the attack and Namek&#x27;s explosion and drifts through space until he is found by his father , who was on his way to Namek to aid him against Goku. Over the next year, Frieza is rebuilt with cybernetic prosthetics, increasing his strength significantly, and the two immediately head for Earth to exact revenge on Goku and his friends, but they are confronted by Trunks, the son of Vegeta and Bulma, who has traveled back to their time from the future. After a brief battle, Frieza is sliced to pieces by Trunks and his remains blasted into oblivion, with his father following shortly afterward. Though finally gone, Frieza&#x27;s cells are later used as a catalyst for the future villain Cell. Cell is eventually destroyed by Gohan, thereby destroying the last traces of Frieza&#x27;s biological tissue.

In the original unaltered timeline where Goku dies of a viral heart disease, Frieza and King Cold are intercepted and killed on Earth by Goku, who arrived via Instant Transmission, and Cell is later killed by Future Trunks.

===&quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&quot;&#x27; / &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;===
Ending up in Earth&#x27;s Hell after being killed by Future Trunks, Frieza spends the next fourteen years being tortured by the playful antics of an overly saccharine cadre of angels and fairies while reliving the memories of his defeats at the hands of Goku and Trunks. But Frieza is resurrected by Sorbet, who saw Frieza&#x27;s return as essential to restore the Frieza Force to its former glory, and his right hand, Tagoma. The two then bring Frieza&#x27;s diced Mecha Frieza form to their ship, where they use their advanced medical technology to restore him to his full organic form. After learning that Goku defeated Majin Buu and fought Beerus to a stalemate, both being the two figures his father warned him never to cross, Frieza decides to undergo four months of intensive training. This led to him achieving a new form which he dubs &quot;Golden Frieza&quot; before setting off for Earth with his army. The Z Fighters hold back Tagoma and Frieza&#x27;s minions long enough for Goku and Vegeta to return from their training session on Beerus&#x27;s planet. Frieza executes his defeated army for their incompetence just as Goku, Vegeta, Beerus, and Whis arrive. Goku reveals his new Super Saiyan Blue form, although Frieza overpowers him yet lacks the stamina for a prolonged fight in his powered state. He then has Sorbet shoot Goku, forcing Vegeta to take up his place. Vegeta nearly kills Frieza, who instead causes his death by destroying Earth. but Whis rewinds time so Goku can quickly kill off Frieza before he destroys the planet. Frieza returns to Hell, where he is once more tormented by the angels. Frieza appears in the manga adaption omake alongside Sorbet and Susami in Hell.

Frieza later returns in the Universal Tournament Arc as a replacement member for the Seventh Universe team after Majin Buu is ineligible to fight due to having fallen into a deep sleep from which nobody could wake him, revealed to have mentally trained himself to maintain his Golden form. When approached by Goku, who is arranging for him to be temporarily revived by Fortuneteller Baba for a day, Frieza accepts the offer on the condition of being fully resurrected by the Dragon Balls after the tournament. Upon being revived, Frieza slaughters a group of assassins hired by the deities of the Ninth Universe to kill him while trapping Goku in a Destroyer-based energy attack meant for him. He then attempted to offer his services to the Ninth Universe deities in return for a place in their universe until Beerus and Whis appeared. Despite Beerus&#x27;s reservations, Goku vouches for him as they join the rest of their team.

As the tournament commences, Frieza meets his Sixth Universe counterpart , a con artist who posed as a hero until a previous contest between the Seventh and Sixth Universes exposed his criminal activities and forced him into hiding. Frieza tricks Frost into believing they have forged an alliance to take out the Saiyans, proceeding to take out both the Ninth Universe&#x27;s Roselle and the Tenth Universe&#x27;s Murichim as the tournament commences. After eliminating Frost when he appears to commence their arrangement, Frieza eventually ends up being one of the four remaining combatants alongside Goku, Android 17, and Jiren of the Eleventh Universe. Frieza unexpectedly teams up with Goku to force Jiren out in a triple elimination with 17 declared the winner, resurrected soon after by Whis at Beerus&#x27;s behest as a reward for his efforts. Frieza then takes his leave to begin rebuilding his empire but is warned by Goku that he will be destroyed if he ever torments the universe again.

During the events of the film &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot;, Frieza starts rebuilding the Frieza Force while deciding to use Earth&#x27;s Dragon Balls to make a wish to increase his height by five centimeters, having become disillusioned with the idea of eternal life from his time in Earth&#x27;s Hell. Frieza recruits the Saiyan Broly and his father Paragus, who accompany him to Earth for the last Dragon Ball, realizing the former&#x27;s potential as he matched Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms. This inspires Frieza to kill Paragus to force Broly&#x27;s transformation into a Super Saiyan, only to be caught in Broly&#x27;s rampage after the latter quickly defeats Goku. Frieza is saved at the last second by Gogeta, a merged warrior between Goku and Vegeta created when they perform the fusion dance technique, who thwarts his attempt to kill off his former subordinates Cheelai and Lemo when they use the Dragon Balls to save Broly&#x27;s life by wishing him off the planet. Frieza falls back while deciding not to go after Cheelai and Lemo as intends to use them to make Broly docile enough for him to use against Goku in the future.

Years later, Frieza is contacted by a former subordinate named Elec to meet him and his group on planet Cereal. Meanwhile, Elec wishes for his younger brother, Gas, to be the strongest warrior in the universe. After Elec sets up a trap to have Granolah and Gas kill Goku and Vegeta, Frieza arrives and murders Gas. Frieza then kills Elec after revealing that he was aware of the latter&#x27;s plan to assassinate him. Frieza reveals to Goku and Vegeta that he had found a place very similar to the &quot;Room of Spirit and Time&quot; on a distant planet and trained in the room for 10 years in just a matter of days, which is why Elec&#x27;s wish did not take him into account at the time it was granted. Frieza presents his new form, , before knocking Goku and Vegeta to the ground, sparing the Saiyans as he only traveled to kill Elec and Gas before leaving Cereal.

== Abilities ==
Frieza is capable of moving at superhuman speeds and flying, and has quick reflexes. Like most characters in the series, he can harness a supernatural energy known as &quot;Ki&quot; and manipulate it into powerful and devastating concussive beams of said energy, with which he can destroy planets with relative ease. Some of Frieza&#x27;s signature &quot;ki&quot; techniques include the , a sharp piercing beam from his finger, and the , a large energy sphere he used to destroy planet Namek and previous to that, Planet Vegeta. He is capable of surviving in the vacuum of space and also seems to possess some form of telekinesis, being able to lift opponents without touching them and causing them to explode.

Frieza&#x27;s power was so great over time, that his body could not comfortably contain it and a series of physical transformations were developed that limit his actual strength. While changing shape from his &quot;first form&quot;, each alteration builds on the previous. In all, Frieza has three transformed states, each with increasing power, some larger than others, and each resulting in different physical attributes, although the two transformed states (along with his first form) were merely to suppress Frieza&#x27;s power, and that his fourth transformed state is his true form, while a fifth and later sixth further transformation that he discovers after performing vigorous times of training that increase his power drastically and lets out most of his latent strength.

;First form

In his weakest form, Frieza is a relatively short humanoid with a large chestnut-shaped skull and two horns. He also has a tail with a spiked end, as well as having three talon-like toes. Frieza wears the same upper-body armor and shorts that many of his subordinates are shown to wear, and while traveling, often gives the appearance of weakness by exclusively using his hoverchair for transportation, leaving his henchmen to do his &quot;dirty work&quot;. Though frail in comparison with his succeeding forms, Frieza still boasts sufficient force to destroy planets. While shifting to his next stage, Frieza breaks his battle-jacket, revealing a natural white armor covering his chest and shoulders.

Frieza&#x27;s 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also initially appears in this form.

;Second form
His second form is much larger, both in height and muscle mass. He grows longer horns, which now instead of protruding sideways from his head curve sharply upwards into near right angles. In this form, Frieza does not have any trouble taking out Vegeta, Krillin, and Gohan. However, Frieza notices that Piccolo&#x27;s power level is about equal to his level, leaving Frieza with no choice but to transform again. This form largely resembles his father, King Cold.

Frieza&#x27;s 6th Universe counterpart Frost also takes on a second form, however, it bears a greater resemblance to Frieza&#x27;s third form and is said to be the equivalent of it by Piccolo.

;Third form
Frieza&#x27;s third form is again more brutish, with an extremely elongated skull (like a xenomorph). His facial features contort and change, with his nose melding into his mouth to form a crude beak. His original horns recede and are now white in color, erupting in pairs along the length of his head. Despite his increased bulk, Frieza&#x27;s speed is significantly higher in this form, easily outpacing Piccolo even after the Namek fighter removed his weighted training clothes. His tail tip, which had been cut off by Krillin, did not regenerate and he now has a slight hunch. Although his tail was surprisingly not regenerated, the rest of his wounds disappeared as if nothing ever touched him.

;Fourth form
Drastically differing from his previous transformations, in his final, true form, Frieza&#x27;s third form (being more like a shell for this final form) cracks and shatters open, revealing a shorter and less bulky appearance. His horns and spikes disappear with his physique becoming entirely streamlined and his skin is now a pure, solid white with purple sections on his head, shoulders, forearms, chest, and shins. All injuries taken in other forms are healed. This is the form that allows him to release his full potential. Frieza can attain 100% power in this form, making his muscle mass engorged compared to his previously sleek frame. This is the peak of Frieza&#x27;s natural potential, and the maximum amount of energy his body can output. In this state, Frieza&#x27;s power increases immensely, making him able to inflict damages to even Super Saiyan Goku and match him in terms of strength and speed. However, to unleash his full power, Frieza needs to subject his body to a muscle strain that drains his energy rather quickly, making him rapidly lose speed and stamina as the fight goes on and because of this issue, Frieza can&#x27;t keep up with Super Saiyan Goku for long. Being aware of this weakness, Frieza tries to finish the fight as quickly as possible by destroying Planet Namek, but the Saiyan is able to defeat him.

Frieza&#x27;s 6th Universe counterpart, Frost, also briefly uses this form during the Tournament of Power.

;Mecha Frieza
After being cut in half by his own attack and being caught in Namek&#x27;s huge explosion, what remains of the still-living Frieza is salvaged and rebuilt with cybernetic enhancements by scientists under the order of King Cold; this form is referred to as in video games. The whole of the lower half of his body and the right side of his face are replaced, as is his left arm from the shoulder down, with scarring and metal accoutrements covering what little was left of his organic self. It is stated that these enhancements have made him even more powerful. However, he was never able to unleash his full power in this form, since he was quickly destroyed by Trunks.
;Golden Frieza
Frieza attains another transformation in the 2015 film &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Resurrection &#x27;F&#x27;&quot; and &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;. According to Frieza, his sixth transformation is achieved after undergoing intensive training for four months, enabling him to gain the strength to progress even further beyond his previous transformations by drawing out all of his latent power (as he had never trained a day in his life beforehand). In this form, Frieza&#x27;s physique is similar to his previous fourth form except his skin is now a golden color as opposed to white, with purple sections on his head, chest, forearms, and shins, thus he is known as in this form. Also, his muscles appear bigger and more defined while in this form, though not as engorged as they became when he used 100% of his power on Namek. In this form at peak power, Frieza can overpower Goku in his Super Saiyan Blue form with relative ease. However, much like when he used 100% of his power in his fourth form, the transformation quickly drains Frieza&#x27;s energy and stamina due to him not training himself further to become accustomed to the form, and thus is unsuitable for prolonged combat, as he soon finds himself unable to compete with Goku and Vegeta in their Super Saiyan Blue forms. After his second revival in the Tournament of Power Saga, Frieza reveals he mastered his Golden form due to intense meditation while in hell. This &quot;True Golden Frieza&quot; can be used indefinitely without any drain on Frieza&#x27;s stamina or even while he is barely conscious.

;Black Frieza
Frieza attains this form in &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; during the Granolah the Survivor saga. In &quot;Dragon Ball Super: Broly&quot;, Vegeta had foreshadowed the possibility that Frieza would take advantage of his restored life following the Tournament of Power to acquire a new form. When he transforms into Black Frieza, his physique appears slightly more muscular compared to his final form, his limbs and tail get darkened a grayish black while the rest of his body retains his final form&#x27;s coloration. Another difference from his Golden form is the purple sections on his shoulders. According to Frieza, this new transformation was achieved when he found a &quot;Room of Spirit and Time&quot; by chance on one of his conquered planets and used it to undergo a 10-year training session within 10 days. Frieza uses this transformation to kill Gas and defeat Goku and Vegeta, in their Ultra Instinct and Ultra Ego states, knocking them both out simultaneously in a single attack.

== Appearances in other media ==
In numerous filler episodes of the anime and &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, Frieza makes numerous cameo appearances, usually as comic relief, causing trouble in Hell, having somehow been permitted to keep his body despite his wrongdoings. In Hell, he is defeated and sent to prison by Goku and Pikkon along with Cell, his father, and the Ginyu Force, and he is later seen watching Goku&#x27;s final battle with Majin Buu in a crystal ball, comically hoping for Goku to lose (this appearance is later contradicted in &quot;Resurrection &quot;F&quot;&quot; and its &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot; adaptation, where Frieza is depicted as unaware that Goku fought and defeated Buu, although for flashback sequences and such, &quot;Super&quot; alludes to &quot;Dragon Ball Z Kai&quot;, where most filler material has been cut). In &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Fusion Reborn&quot;, Frieza briefly escapes from Hell with an army of villains to attack Earth, but he is swiftly defeated by Gohan. In &quot;Dragon Ball GT&quot;, when Goku is sent to Hell by accident, Frieza and Cell confront him, their bodies having been rendered temporarily immortal due to the unbalance between the two worlds. Using a joint attack, Frieza and Cell send Goku to a lower level where he is frozen by a witch, but the two villains end up frozen themselves when they foolishly venture downwards to gloat at Goku. Goku accidentally breaks the ice holding Frieza and Cell and it shatters to pieces, implying that Frieza and Cell have been erased from existence. However, in a future scene, Frieza and Cell are seen being taken away in a jail cell with tape over their mouths and appear in the live-action GT show where he and Cell gain new forms to track down Goku. He appeared in a TV ad for &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Battle of Gods&quot;, as he makes a non-speaking appearance in the film.

He also appears in a chapter of Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Neko Majin&quot; manga, published in August 2003, which also introduces Frieza&#x27;s son, . He briefly appears in the 2006 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; crossover chapter, , of Osamu Akimoto&#x27;s manga &quot;Kochira Katsushika-ku Kameari Kōen-mae Hashutsujo&quot;. Frieza appears in Naho Ōishi&#x27;s 2011 &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; spin-off manga &quot;Episode of Bardock&quot;, but it predominately features his ancestor . He also appears in Toriyama&#x27;s 2014 &quot;Dragon Ball Minus: The Departure of the Fated Child&quot; special.

Frieza has made numerous appearances in other media. The Japanese nu metal/hardcore punk band Maximum the Hormone released the song &quot;F&quot; as part of a double A-side single on July 9, 2008. The entirety of the song references Frieza, with the single itself rising as high as number two on the Oricon music chart. The song was the source of reference used by Toriyama for the title of the film &quot;Fukkatsu no F&quot; and is featured in the movie. Seikima-II frontman Demon Kakka wrote and performed the song that appeared in two episodes of &quot;Dragon Ball Kai&quot; and on the 2009 &quot;Dragon Ball Kai Song Collection&quot; album.

In the manga &quot;Black Cat&quot;, the character Sven Vollfied is often seen using his cell phone with a wrist strap of a miniature-sized badge of Frieza&#x27;s head. A caricature of Frieza mixed with a grey alien was parodied as a mech pilot in an episode of &quot;Magical Shopping Arcade Abenobashi&quot;. The anime &quot;Yakitate!! Japan&quot; featured a spoof re-enactment of the fight between Goku and Frieza, with a character clad in a refrigerator representing the latter. The Cartoon Network show &quot;&quot; had a parody of their own of the climactic fight and the Frieza character, with the Delightful Children From Down the Lane portraying him as a multi-headed monstrosity.

=== Video games ===
Frieza has been featured in many of the video games based on the series. Often, he appears as both a playable character and boss, though more frequently the latter. He is also usually able to transform into his many different forms.

Frieza appears in the Famicom game (and later Playdia remake) &quot;Dragon Ball Z Gaiden: Saiyajin Zetsumetsu Keikaku&quot;. Frieza seems to be somehow resurrected, and he and other past villains start attacking Goku and his friends. Once it&#x27;s revealed these are merely ghost-warriors meant to distract the heroes, however, the false Frieza and his allies are easily dealt with. Other games highlight Frieza in alternate story paths; including those where he successfully attains immortality and goes on to threaten Earth such as &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai&quot;, and &quot;Dragon Ball Z: Budokai 2&quot; where Frieza and Cell are resurrected and controlled by Bobbidi as a distraction for the player.

Frieza also appears as a playable character in the crossover fighting games &quot;Jump Ultimate Stars&quot;, &quot;Battle Stadium D.O.N&quot;, &quot;J-Stars Victory Vs&quot; and &quot;Jump Force&quot;.

==Reception==
Yū Kondō, Toriyama&#x27;s second editor from the Saiyan arc until the appearance of Perfect Cell, and Fuyuto Takeda, his third editor from Perfect Cell until the end of the series, said that &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; hit its peak in popularity during the Frieza arc. In a one-thousand ballot popularity poll held in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; received 815 of them. In 2004, fans of the series voted Frieza the ninth most popular character for a poll in the book &quot;Dragon Ball Forever&quot;. Frieza topped a poll of &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; antagonists by fan vote, the results of which was published by the March 2018 issue of &quot;V Jump&quot;.

Frieza was mentioned as one of the &quot;most beloved characters&quot; in an article by &quot;GamePro&quot;. The casting and direction of his English voices has often been criticized over the years, with IGN&#x27;s Ramsey Isler writing that, coupled with the ambiguous physical features, the &quot;old lady&quot; voice led to some gender confusion with fans. &quot;The Ledger&quot;&#x27;s December 8, 1999, paper names him as one of the reasons that &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot; was listed as a violent show for children, stating, &quot;In one recent episode, beads of sweat form on the brow of a character named Vegeta, as he is nearly strangled to death by an evil foe named Frieza. In another, Frieza uses the horns on his head to impale a good guy named Krillin through the chest.&quot; The paper also comments on Frieza&#x27;s appearance: &quot;Little Gohan is abruptly in the icy metallic grip of one of his arch-nemeses, Frieza, a silvery androgynous giant who looks like a cross between the monster in &quot;Alien&quot; and Batman&#x27;s Mr. Freeze.&quot; Comic Book Resources regarded Frieza&#x27;s role in the original series as the reason why his arc is one of the darkest ever in the franchise due to the violence in fights, deaths and resolution of his fight against Goku, giving it an improvement in retrospect. Both Kotaku and Den of Geek regarded Frieza as the series&#x27; most entertaining villain in the entire series which led to the staff to revive him multiple times in order to appeal to returning fans.

Response to Frieza&#x27;s revival in &quot;Resurrection F&quot; has been mixed to negative. DVD Talk enjoyed the rematch between Frieza and Goku in &quot;Resurrection F&quot; but still lamented that its length was too much when compared with other subplots. IGN was more positive in regards Frieza&#x27;s new powers and rivalry with Goku. Anime News Network lamented Frieza&#x27;s role as he felt that he barely gave a decent fight in the movie as the writing fails to portray him as a menacing villain with the new powers of Goku and Vegeta easily surpassing him alongside other plot devices like the healing beans. In regards to the voice actors &quot;Ayres’ brand of childish pompousness is a lot less threatening in a story where Frieza isn&#x27;t in a position of power from the get-go. Ryusei Nakao&#x27;s slightly more adult tone works a little better in this instance.&quot; Den of Geek found the fight between Goku&#x27;s allies and Frieza&#x27;s army as the best part of the movie in contrast to the lead&#x27;s fights which he felt was &quot;standard&quot; to the point it gets &quot;boring&quot;.

For the final arc of &quot;Dragon Ball Super&quot;, Anime News Network had mixed feelings about the second return of Frieza to have him teamed up with Universe 7. He felt that while Frieza might be turning into a &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; cliche where most characters such as Yamcha, Tien Shinhan, Chiaotzu, Piccolo, Vegeta and Majin Buu served as villains before becoming heroes, his actions were still ambiguous and it was satisfying to see him engage with Goku on a one-on-one to settle their rules in the Tournament of Power. Hobby Consolas commented that Frieza was overpowered by Jiren so many times that it became tiring to see. However, Frieza&#x27;s team-up with Goku to force their enemy out of the tournament&#x27;s arena was found surprising for how such characters who have hated each other for years have decided to join forces to the point even Vegeta is shocked at seeing this. IGN noted that Frieza was absent through so many episodes of the final arc and praised his team up with Goku not only due to their differences but also animation highlights. However, the fact that Frieza is not only revived but also given his own empire back left the reviewer in a dilemma in regards to the impact it might give the franchise in the future due to whether or not he will keep being evil as he kept interacting with Goku for a long time. Cine Premiere agreed that Frieza&#x27;s future actions might be up to debate.

<text>Matsunaga Danjō Hisahide (松永 弾正 久秀 1508 – November 19, 1577) was a &quot;daimyō&quot; and head of the Yamato Matsunaga clan in Japan during the Sengoku period of the 16th century.

He has historical reputation as one of , a nickname which he shared with Ukita Naoie and Saitō Dōsan, due to their ambitious and treasonous personality, along with the habit to resort into underhanded tactics and assassinations to eliminate the oppositions.

==Biography==
He was a retainer of Miyoshi Nagayoshi from the 1540s. He directed the conquest of the province of Yamato in the 1560s and by 1564 had built a sufficient power base to be effectively independent. It is believed that he was conspiring against Nagayoshi during this period; from 1561 to 1563 three of Nagayoshi&#x27;s brothers and his son, Yoshiaki, died. This left Miyoshi Yoshitsugu the adopted heir when Nagayoshi died in 1564, too young to rule. Three men shared his guardianship – Miyoshi Nagayuki, Miyoshi Masayasu, and Iwanari Tomomichi.

In 1565, he then invaded the &quot;shōgun&quot; Ashikaga Yoshiteru&#x27;s palace, who then committed suicide. Yoshiteru&#x27;s brother, Ashikaga Yoshiaki, fled and the shōgun was replaced by his younger cousin, Yoshihide.

In 1566, fighting started between Hisahide and Miyoshi. Initially, the forces of Hisahide were unsuccessful and his apparent destruction of the Buddhist Tōdai-ji in Nara was considered an act of infamy.

In 1568, Oda Nobunaga, with the figurehead Yoshiaki, attacked Hisahide. Nobunaga captured Kyoto in November and Hisahide was forced to submit.

Yoshiaki was made shōgun, a post he held only until 1573 when he attempted to remove himself from Nobunaga&#x27;s power. Hisahide kept control of the Yamato and served Nobunaga in his extended campaigns against the Miyoshi and others, for a while.

In 1573, Hisahide briefly allied with the Miyoshi clan, but when the hope for success was not achieved he returned to Nobunaga to fight the Miyoshi.

In 1577, Nobunaga besieged him at Shigisan Castle. Defeated but defiant, Hisahide committed suicide. A noted tea master, he destroyed his tea bowl, denying it to his enemies.

He ordered his head destroyed to prevent it from becoming a trophy, so his son, Matsunaga Kojiro, grabbed Hisahide&#x27;s head and jumped off the castle wall with his sword through his throat. His son, Hisamichi, also committed suicide in the siege.

Hisahide often appears as a shriveled and scheming old man.

Nobunaga&#x27;s son, Oda Nobutada, with Akechi Mitsuhide, would defeat Hisahide at the Siege of Shigisan. If Hisahide had surrendered, Nobunaga would have given him a small fiefdom.

<text>Coq au vin (; , &quot;rooster/cock with wine&quot;) is a French dish of chicken braised with wine, lardons, mushrooms, and optionally garlic.
A red Burgundy wine is typically used, though many regions of France make variants using local wines, such as &quot;coq au vin jaune&quot; (Jura), &quot;coq au riesling&quot; (Alsace), &quot;coq au pourpre&quot; or &quot;coq au violet&quot; (Beaujolais nouveau), and &quot;coq au Champagne&quot;.

==History==
Several legends trace &quot;coq au vin&quot; to ancient Gaul and Julius Caesar, but the recipe was not documented until the early 20th century; it is generally accepted that it existed as a rustic dish long before that. A somewhat similar recipe, &quot;poulet au vin blanc&quot;, appeared in an 1864 cookbook.

Simone Beck, Louisette Bertholle and Julia Child included &quot;coq au vin&quot; in their 1961 cookbook &quot;Mastering the Art of French Cooking&quot;, and Child prepared it twice on the PBS cooking show &quot;The French Chef.&quot; This exposure helped to increase the visibility and popularity of the dish in the United States, and &quot;coq au vin&quot; was seen as one of Child&#x27;s signature dishes.

==Preparation==
Although the word &quot;coq&quot; in French means &quot;rooster&quot; or &quot;cock&quot;, and tough birds with much connective tissue benefit from braising, &quot;coq au vin&quot; may be made with any poultry, most commonly chicken.

Standard recipes call for red wine (often Burgundy) for braising, lardons, button mushrooms, onions, often garlic, and sometimes brandy. Recipes with vin jaune may specify morels instead of white mushrooms. The preparation is similar in many respects to beef bourguignon. The chicken is seasoned, sometimes floured, seared in fat and slowly simmered in wine until tender. The usual seasonings are salt, pepper, thyme, parsley, and bay leaf, usually in the form of a bouquet garni. The juices are thickened either with a roux or by adding blood at the end.

<doc id="244559" wikidata="Q136177" url="?curid=244559" title="Water integrator">
<text>The Water Integrator ( &quot;Gidravlicheskiy integrator&quot;) was an early analog computer built in the Soviet Union in 1936 by Vladimir Sergeevich Lukyanov. It functioned by careful manipulation of water through a room full of interconnected pipes and pumps. The water level in various chambers (with precision to fractions of a millimeter) represented stored numbers, and the rate of flow between them represented mathematical operations. This machine was capable of solving inhomogeneous differential equations.

The first versions of Lukyanov&#x27;s integrators were rather experimental, made of tin and glass tubes, and each integrator could be used to solve only one problem. In the 1930s it was the only computer in the Soviet Union for solving partial differential equations.

In 1941, Lukyanov created a hydraulic integrator of modular design, which made it possible to assemble a machine for solving various problems. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional hydraulic integrators were designed.

In 1949–1955, an integrator in the form of standard unified units was developed at the NIISCHETMASH Institute. In 1955, the Ryazan plant of calculating and analytical machines began the serial production of integrators with the factory brand name &quot;IGL&quot; (russian: Интегратор Гидравлический Лукьянова – integrator of the Lukyanov hydraulic system). Integrators were widely distributed, delivered to Czechoslovakia, Poland, Bulgaria and China. 

A water integrator was used in the design of the Karakum Canal in the 1940s, and the construction of the Baikal–Amur Mainline in the 1970s. Water analog computers were used in the Soviet Union until the 1980s for large-scale modelling. They were used in geology, mine construction, metallurgy, rocket production and other fields.

Currently, two hydraulic integrators are kept in the Polytechnic Museum in Moscow.

<doc id="244568" wikidata="Q6034312" url="?curid=244568" title="Injective cogenerator">
<text>In category theory, a branch of mathematics, the concept of an injective cogenerator is drawn from examples such as Pontryagin duality. Generators are objects which cover other objects as an approximation, and (dually) cogenerators are objects which envelope other objects as an approximation.

More precisely:

* A generator of a category with a zero object is an object &quot;G&quot; such that for every nonzero object H there exists a nonzero morphism f: &quot;G&quot; → &quot;H&quot;.
* A cogenerator is an object &quot;C&quot; such that for every nonzero object &quot;H&quot; there exists a nonzero morphism f: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;C&quot;. (Note the reversed order).

==The abelian group case==

Assuming one has a category like that of abelian groups, one can in fact form direct sums of copies of &quot;G&quot; until the morphism

:&quot;f&quot;: Sum(&quot;G&quot;) → &quot;H&quot;

is surjective; and one can form direct products of &quot;C&quot; until the morphism

:&quot;f&quot;: &quot;H&quot; → Prod(&quot;C&quot;)

is injective.

For example, the integers are a generator of the category of abelian groups (since every abelian group is a quotient of a free abelian group). This is the origin of the term &quot;generator&quot;. The approximation here is normally described as &quot;generators and relations.&quot;

As an example of a &quot;cogenerator&quot; in the same category, we have Q/Z, the rationals modulo the integers, which is a divisible abelian group. Given any abelian group &quot;A&quot;, there is an isomorphic copy of &quot;A&quot; contained inside the product of |&quot;A&quot;| copies of Q/Z. This approximation is close to what is called the &quot;divisible envelope&quot; - the true envelope is subject to a minimality condition.

==General theory==
Finding a generator of an abelian category allows one to express every object as a quotient of a direct sum of copies of the generator. Finding a cogenerator allows one to express every object as a subobject of a direct product of copies of the cogenerator. One is often interested in projective generators (even finitely generated projective generators, called progenerators) and minimal injective cogenerators. Both examples above have these extra properties.

The cogenerator Q/Z is useful in the study of modules over general rings. If &quot;H&quot; is a left module over the ring &quot;R&quot;, one forms the (algebraic) character module &quot;H&quot;* consisting of all abelian group homomorphisms from &quot;H&quot; to Q/Z. &quot;H&quot;* is then a right R-module. Q/Z being a cogenerator says precisely that &quot;H&quot;* is 0 if and only if &quot;H&quot; is 0. Even more is true: the * operation takes a homomorphism

:&quot;f&quot;: &quot;H&quot; → &quot;K&quot;

to a homomorphism

:&quot;f&quot;*: &quot;K&quot;* → &quot;H&quot;*,

and &quot;f&quot;* is 0 if and only if &quot;f&quot; is 0. It is thus a faithful contravariant functor from left &quot;R&quot;-modules to right &quot;R&quot;-modules.

Every &quot;H&quot;* is pure-injective (also called algebraically compact). One can often consider a problem after applying the * to simplify matters.

All of this can also be done for continuous modules &quot;H&quot;: one forms the topological character module of continuous group homomorphisms from &quot;H&quot; to the circle group R/Z.

==In general topology==

The Tietze extension theorem can be used to show that an interval is an injective cogenerator in a category of topological spaces subject to separation axioms.

<doc id="244576" wikidata="Q1192794" url="?curid=244576" title="Missile Command">
<text>Missile Command is a 1980 shoot &#x27;em up video game developed and published by Atari for arcades. Sega released the game outside North America. It was designed by Dave Theurer, who also designed Atari&#x27;s vector graphics game &quot;Tempest&quot; from the same year. The game was released during the Cold War, and the player uses a trackball to defend six cities from intercontinental ballistic missiles by launching anti-ballistic missiles from three bases.

Atari brought the game to its home systems beginning with the 1981 Atari VCS conversion by Rob Fulop. Numerous contemporaneous clones and modern remakes followed. Atari&#x27;s 1981 port to the Atari 8-bit computers was reused for the Atari 5200 (1982) and built into the Atari XEGS (1987). It is considered to be one of the greatest video games of all time.

==Plot==
The player&#x27;s six cities are being attacked by an endless hail of ballistic missiles, some of which split like multiple independently targetable reentry vehicles. New weapons are introduced in later levels: smart bombs that can evade a less-than-perfectly targeted missile, and bomber planes and satellites that fly across the screen launching missiles of their own. As a regional commander of three anti-missile batteries, the player must defend six cities in their zone from being destroyed.

==Gameplay==
The game is played by moving a crosshair across the sky background via a trackball and pressing one of three buttons to launch a counter-missile from the appropriate battery. Counter-missiles explode upon reaching the crosshair, leaving a fireball that persists for several seconds and destroys any enemy missiles that enter it. There are three batteries, each with ten missiles; a battery becomes useless when all its missiles have been launched or if it is destroyed by enemy fire, whichever occurs first. The missiles of the central battery fly to their targets at much greater speed; only these missiles can effectively kill a smart bomb at a distance.

The game is staged as a series of levels of increasing difficulty; each level contains a set number of incoming enemy weapons. The weapons attack both the cities and the missile batteries and can destroy any target with one hit. Enemy weapons are only able to destroy three cities during one level. A level ends when all enemy weaponry is destroyed or reaches its target. A player who runs out of missiles no longer has control over the remainder of the level. At the conclusion of a level, the player receives bonus points for all remaining missiles and cities; at preset score intervals, the player earns a bonus city that can be used to replace a destroyed one at the end of the current level. These bonus cities can be kept in reserve and are automatically deployed as needed. The scoring multiplier begins at 1x and advances by 1x after every second level, to a maximum of 6x; this multiplier affects both target and bonus values. 

The game inevitably ends once all six cities are destroyed and the player neither has any in reserve nor earns one during the current level. Like most early arcade games, there is no way to &quot;win&quot;; the enemy weapons become faster and more prolific with each new level. The game, then, is just a contest in seeing how long the player can survive. On conclusion of the game, the screen displays &quot;The End&quot;, rather than &quot;Game Over&quot;, signifying that &quot;in the end, all is lost. There is no winner&quot;. This conclusion is skipped, however, if the player makes the high score list and the game prompts the player to enter their initials.

==Development==

Having found a picture of a radar screen in a magazine, Gene Lipkin, then president of Atari&#x27;s Coin-Op division, tasked Steve Calfee, department head, to &quot;Make me a game like this&quot;. At this time, games were usually developed by a single programmer with a deadline of 6 months. If the project was high-profile, this programmer could be assigned a junior programmer as an extra resource. Dave Theurer, who was free after finishing Atari Soccer as a junior programmer, was offered the project, loosely defined as &quot;radar screen showing missiles fired from the USSR toward the US, which is defended by the player&quot;. Because the project was requested by a boss, it was considered &quot;high profile&quot; and a junior programmer, Rich Adam, was assigned to Theurer.

Calfee, Theurer and Adam then worked on refining the game concept. In early iterations the six cities were meant to represent six cities in California: Eureka, San Francisco, San Luis Obispo, Santa Barbara, Los Angeles, and San Diego. While Theurer understood the assignment of making a patriotic game, the current political climate made Theurer hesitant about the possible violent incitations. While enthusiastic about his first project, Theurer put conditions to his work:

# There would be no names of countries attached to either the attacking force or the defending force.
# The game would be purely defensive and never put players in situations where they would be the aggressor.

Thus city names were removed completely. Players would also not be able to retaliate, as that would be a scenario of mutual assured destruction, which Theurer didn&#x27;t find noble: &quot;I did not want to put the player in a position of being a genocidal maniac. Only a crazy person would sling nuclear weapons without context, right?&quot;. Removing mentions of countries and cities would also leave the story&#x27;s details to the player&#x27;s imagination. The only possible game outcome of total destruction was also a message on the futility of war.

To make the game fast-paced, Theurer opted for a trackball as a control, faster than a joystick. The game would also be the first color game made by Atari. Both features ensured the game would stand out compared to the competition of the time. The cabinet would also be innovative, featuring an extra panel of light indicators tied to events in the game.

As the deadline was approaching, the programmers started crunching heavily and Theurer suffered from nightmares of being destroyed by a nuclear blast. A common observation at Atari at the time was that no programmer ever succeeded at having their first game released. This common occurrence was seen as a part of a programmer&#x27;s learning curve but was putting extra pressure on Theurer. (This rule was later named &quot;Theurer&#x27;s law&quot; for being a famous exception)

Coin-op games had to go through early &quot;field tests&quot; where Atari would pay an arcade owner to place their prototype in the arcade for a few days so that the developers could observe player behaviour and reaction, find bugs and ensure the players were understanding the game and having fun. The game was an instant hit but the extra indicator panel was distracting the player and taking their attention from the screen, thus was scrapped entirely.

==Reception==

The game was an instant hit, hailed for its uniqueness, color graphics and challenging score-based gameplay, which were massive draws for arcade games at the time.

&quot;Missile Command&quot; is considered one of the great classic video games from the Golden Age of Arcade Games. The game is also interesting in its manifestation of the Cold War&#x27;s effects on popular culture, in that the game features an implementation of National Missile Defense and parallels real-life nuclear war.

The game sold nearly 20,000 arcade cabinets. &quot;Missile Command&quot; was a commercial success for Sega in Japan, where it was among the top-ten highest-grossing arcade video games of 1980.

In 1983, &quot;Softline&quot; readers named &quot;Missile Command&quot; for the Atari 8-bit computers eighth on the magazine&#x27;s Top Thirty list of Atari programs by popularity. In a retrospective review, Brett Weiss of Allgame gave the arcade version a perfect score of 5 out of 5, in terms of controls, frenetic gameplay, sound effects, theme, and strategic aiming and firing.

In 1995, &quot;Flux&quot; magazine ranked the arcade version 24th on their &quot;Top 100 Video Games&quot;.

==Ports==
&quot;Missile Command&quot; was ported to the Atari 2600 in 1981. The game&#x27;s instruction manual describes a war between two planets: Zardon (the defending player) and Krytol. The original arcade game contains no reference to these worlds. On level 13, if the player uses all of his or her missiles without scoring any points, at the end of the game the city on the right will turn into &quot;RF&quot; – the initials of the programmer Rob Fulop. This Easter egg is originally documented in &quot;Atari Age&quot; (Volume 1, issue #2) in a letter to the editor by Joseph Nickischer, and is the second one publicly acknowledged by Atari. In an interview with &quot;Paleotronic Magazine&quot;, Fulop stated that Atari paid him for his work by giving him a Safeway coupon for a free turkey, which motivated him to leave the company and co-found competing developer Imagic.

&quot;Missile Command&quot; was released for Atari 8-bit computers in 1981 and an identical version for the Atari 5200 in 1982. The same Atari 8-bit port was later used in the 1987 Atari XEGS as a built-in game that boots up if there isn&#x27;t a cartridge or keyboard in the console.

==Legacy==
===Re-releases===
&quot;Missile Command&quot; has seen many re-releases in many Atari compilation titles:

===Sequels===
In late 1980, a two-player sequel &quot;Missile Command 2&quot; was field tested but never released, although at least one prototype appeared in an arcade in Santa Clara, California. This game was similar to the original except that each player had their own set of cities and missile batteries and the players could cooperate to save each other&#x27;s cities from the onslaught. 

In 1992, Atari developed a prototype of an arcade game called &quot;Arcade Classics&quot; for their 20th anniversary, which included &quot;Missile Command 2&quot; and &quot;Super Centipede&quot;. Despite its name, however, this version was not the unreleased sequel, but an enhanced remake of the first game. 

In 1981, an enhancement kit was made by General Computer Corp. to convert &quot;Missile Command&quot; into &quot;Super Missile Attack&quot;. This made the game even harder, and added a UFO to the player&#x27;s enemies.

In 1982, Atari released a game called &quot;Liberator&quot;, which was seen by some as being a sequel to &quot;Missile Command&quot; with the situation essentially reversed; in &quot;Liberator&quot;, the player is the one attacking planetary bases from orbit.

===Updated versions===

Enhanced versions of &quot;Missile Command&quot; were released for the Atari Lynx and Game Boy.

An updated version called &quot;Missile Command 3D&quot; was released for the Atari Jaguar in 1995. It contains three versions of the game: Classic (a straight port of the arcade game), 3D (graphically upgraded and with a rotating viewpoint), and Virtual. It is the only game that works with the virtual reality helmet from Virtuality.

Hasbro Interactive released a 3D remake of &quot;Missile Command&quot; for Microsoft Windows and PlayStation in 1999.

A port of &quot;Missile Command&quot; with high-definition graphics was released via Xbox Live Arcade for the Xbox 360 on July 4, 2007.

&quot;Missile Command&quot; was released for the iPhone and iPod Touch for US$5 on September 23, 2008. It includes two gameplay modes (&quot;Ultra&quot; and &quot;Classic&quot;).

In March 2020, Atari released a new remake, &quot;Missile Command: Recharged&quot;, on mobile platforms, the first in the &quot;Atari Recharged&quot; series. On May 27, the remake also made it to Nintendo Switch as well as home computers via Steam, later on released as a launch title on the Atari VCS.

An updated version of the game was announced in 2018 for the Intellivision Amico. While neither the Intellivision Amico version of &quot;Missile Command&quot; nor the Amico console itself have yet released, a mobile version was announced in late 2023, as part of Intellivision&#x27;s &quot;Amico Home&quot; initiative. This version was released for Android the same year, with an iOS version being announced for a later release.

===Clones===
Contemporary &quot;Missile Command&quot; clones include &quot;Missile Defense&quot; (1981) for the Apple II, &quot;Stratos&quot; (1982) for the TRS-80, &quot;Missile Control&quot; (1983) for the BBC Micro, &quot;Repulsar&quot; (1983) for the ZX Spectrum, and &quot;Barrage&quot; (1983) for the TI-99/4A. Silas Warner programmed the 1980 clone &quot;ABM&quot; for the Apple II several years before writing &quot;Castle Wolfenstein&quot;. Similarly, John Field programmed the &quot;Missile Command&quot;-like game &quot;ICBM&quot; (1981), then went on to create &quot;Axis Assassin&quot;, one of the first five games published by Electronic Arts.

&quot;Atomic Command&quot;, a clone of Missile Command, is playable on the Pip-Boy interface in the &quot;Fallout 4&quot; video game.

===In popular culture===
* &quot;Missile Command&quot; was referenced in the 1980 episode &quot;Call Girl&quot; of the TV sitcom &quot;Barney Miller&quot;, which features a detective who is hooked on the game.
* In the 1991 film &quot;Terminator 2: Judgment Day&quot;, John Connor plays the game in an arcade, echoing the film&#x27;s theme of a future global nuclear war.
* The documentary &quot;High Score&quot; (2006) follows William Carlton, a Portland, Oregon gamer, on his quest to beat the &quot;Missile Command&quot; high score record for Marathon settings.
* In the 2010 open world survival horror video game, &quot;Deadly Premonition&quot;, the game is mentioned by the protagonist Francis York Morgan, while driving.
* In the 2008 episode &quot;Chuck Versus Tom Sawyer&quot; of the NBC show &quot;Chuck&quot;, a weapons satellite access code is hidden in the (fictitious) kill screen of &quot;Missile Command&quot; by its programmer, Mr. Morimoto (Clyde Kusatsu).
* In the 1982 film &quot;Fast Times at Ridgemont High&quot;, &quot;Missile Command&quot;″s &quot;The End&quot; screen is used to help illustrate the film&#x27;s ending.
* The game is shown in the opening title sequence of the 2013 FX television series &quot;The Americans&quot;.
* &quot;Fallout 4&quot; features a holotape called Atomic Command where the player must defend landmarks across the United States from atomic bombs.

===Film connection and adaptation===
The gameplay of &quot;Missile Command&quot;, specifically, the contrails left by incoming ICBMs, and the visuals of cities being destroyed by nuclear warheads on a video display screen, strongly resembles the opening nuclear war scenes from the 1977 film, &quot;Damnation Alley&quot;.

In February 2010, Atari was talking with several studios to turn &quot;Missile Command&quot; into a film. 20th Century Fox acquired the rights to bring &quot;Missile Command&quot; to film the following year. In May 2016, Emmett/Furla/Oasis Films closed a deal to partner with Atari to produce and finance both &quot;Centipede&quot; and &quot;Missile Command&quot;.

==World records==
Two types of world records are monitored for the arcade version of &quot;Missile Command&quot;: Marathon and Tournament settings. Both settings allow the player to start with six cities. Marathon settings award bonus cities, while in tournament mode bonus cities are not awarded at any point in the game.

===Marathon settings===
In 1981, Floridian Jody Bowles played a &quot;Missile Command&quot; arcade game for 30 hours at The Filling Station Eatery in Pensacola. Bowles scored 41,399,845 points with one quarter using Marathon settings, besting the previous known record, according to Atari spokesman Mike Fournell. The record was broken when Victor Ali of the United States scored 80,364,995 points in 1982.

Beginning on March 15, 2013, Victor Sandberg of Sweden scored 81,796,035 points live on Twitch after 56 hours of play. On December 27 of the same year, Sandberg started a 71-hour and 41 minute game with a score of 103,809,990—10 points short of getting an additional 176 cities.

===Tournament settings===
On July 3, 1985, Roy Shildt of Los Angeles set a world record in tournament-set Missile Command, with a score of 1,695,265, as verified by Twin Galaxies. This score, as well it earning his induction into the Video Game Hall of Fame, were published in the 1986 Guinness Book of World Records.

After more than 20 years, on March 9, 2006, UK-based gamer Tony Temple set a new world record of 1,967,830 points, also with Tournament settings as confirmed by Twin Galaxies. Temple&#x27;s score was published in the 2008 Guinness Book of World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition, although Guinness noted that the score was controversial due to Temple playing on game settings that increased cursor speed and was therefore easier than those of Roy Shildt, the previous record holder. Tony Temple increased his world record on two occasions, culminating in a score of 4,472,570 in 2 hours and 57 minutes–verified on September 9, 2010. This is the first verified time that a player passed wave 256 under tournament settings; the game difficulty starts over at wave 1 again.
In 1981 Steve Rakes played a 6.5 hour game without losing a single city, and at which time the machine malfunctioned expelling a small puff of smoke. Rakes is said to have only played Missile Command 15 times previously with the 6.5 hour game being his sixteenth.

<text>Alan Milburn (born 27 January 1958) is a British politician who was Member of Parliament (MP) for Darlington from 1992 to 2010. A member of the Labour Party, he served for five years in the Cabinet, first as Chief Secretary to the Treasury from 1998 to 1999, and subsequently as Secretary of State for Health until 2003, when he resigned. He briefly rejoined the Cabinet as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster in order to manage Labour&#x27;s 2005 re-election campaign. He did not seek re-election in the 2010 election. Milburn was chair of the Social Mobility Commission from 2012 to 2017. Since 2015, he has been Chancellor of Lancaster University.

== Early life and career ==
Milburn was born in Whitehaven, and brought up in the village of Tow Law in County Durham and in Newcastle-upon-Tyne.

He was educated at John Marley School in Newcastle and, after his mother married, Stokesley Comprehensive School in North Yorkshire. He went on to Lancaster University, where he lived in Morecambe and Galgate, graduating in 1979 with a Bachelor of Arts degree with Upper Second Class Honours in History. After leaving university, he returned to Newcastle where, with Martin Spence, he operated a small radical bookshop in the Westgate Road, called &quot;Days of Hope&quot; (the shop was given the Spoonerised nickname &quot;Haze of Dope&quot;). He studied for a PhD at Newcastle University, but did not complete his thesis. 

Milburn was Co-ordinator of the Trade Union Studies Information Unit (TUSIU) from the mid-1980s onwards.

From 1988, Milburn co-ordinated a campaign to defend shipbuilding in Sunderland, Tyne and Wear, and was elected Chairman of Newcastle-upon-Tyne Central Constituency Labour Party. In 1990 he became a Business Development Officer for North Tyneside Borough Council and was elected as President of the North East Region of the Manufacturing Science and Finance trade union. He duly won the seat of Darlington in the 1992 general election.

== Member of Parliament ==
In Parliament, Milburn allied himself with the Blairite modernisers in the Labour Party, close to Tony Blair, MP for the next-door constituency of Sedgefield. The political editor of the New Statesman wrote that &quot;Alan Milburn is regarded by most in Labour as the epitome of Blairite centrism and moderation.&quot;

=== In government ===

In 1997 he was appointed Minister of State at the Department of Health, an important post in which he had responsibility for driving through Private Finance Initiative deals on hospitals. In the reshuffle caused by Peter Mandelson&#x27;s resignation on 23 December 1998, Milburn was promoted to the Cabinet as Chief Secretary to the Treasury.

He became Secretary of State for Health in October 1999, with responsibility for continuing the reduction in waiting times and delivering modernisation in the National Health Service (NHS). In 2002 Milburn introduced NHS foundation trusts, originally envisaged as a new form of not-for-profit provider and &quot;described at the time as a sort of halfway house between the public and private sectors&quot;. Milburn later described his reforms as &quot;getting the private sector into the NHS to work alongside the public sector. We gave more choice to patients. We paid more for the hospitals that were doing more rather than paying everyone the same.&quot;

Milburn was thought to be a candidate for promotion within the Government, but on the day of a reshuffle (12 June 2003) he announced his resignation from government. He cited the difficulties combining family life in North-East England with a demanding job in London as his reason for quitting.

While on the backbenches he continued to be a strong supporter of Tony Blair&#x27;s policies, especially his continued policy of increased private involvement in public service provision. Following his resignation as Secretary of State for Health, Milburn took a post for £30,000 a year as an adviser to Bridgepoint Capital, a venture capital firm heavily involved in financing private health-care firms moving into the NHS, including Alliance Medical, Match Group, Medica and the Robinia Care Group.

He returned to government in September 2004, as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. He was brought back to lead the Labour Party&#x27;s campaign in the 2005 general election, but the unsuccessful start to the campaign led to Milburn taking a back seat, with Gordon Brown returning to take a very prominent role.

=== Backbenches ===
On election night in 2005, he announced he would be leaving the Cabinet for a second time, although rumours persisted that he would challenge Gordon Brown for the succession. On 27 June 2007, Brown was unopposed. On 8 September 2006, after Tony Blair had announced his intention to step down within a year, Charles Clarke suggested Milburn as leader in place of Brown. On 28 February 2007, he and Clarke launched The 2020 Vision, a website intended to promote policy debate in the Labour Party.

He was the honorary president of the political organisation Progress, which was founded by Derek Draper. In 2007, Milburn worked as an advisor to Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd and again in 2010 acted as an advisor to the election campaign of Julia Gillard.
Between January and July 2009, Milburn chaired a governmental commission on social mobility, the Panel on Fair Access to the Professions. The Panel reported in July 2009 with recommendations to improve social mobility by acting at every life stage – including through schools, universities, internship practices and recruitment processes.

In 2007, Milburn became a paid advisor to PepsiCo and sat on its nutritional advisory board. By the time he stood down from Parliament, Milburn had an income at least £115,000 a year from five companies.

In June 2009, he told his local party he would not be standing at the 2010 general election, saying: &quot;Standing down as an MP will give me the chance to balance my work and my family life with the time to pursue challenges other than politics.&quot;

== Later career ==

Despite the change of government following the May 2010 general election, it was reported in August 2010 that Milburn had been offered a role in the Conservative-Liberal Democrat coalition as &quot;social mobility tsar&quot;. Although not officially politically-affiliated, the role would involve advising the government on how to break down social barriers for people from disadvantaged backgrounds, and help people who feel they are barred from top jobs on grounds of race, religion, gender or disability. Milburn provoked criticism from former Cabinet colleague John Prescott, and his former ally Andy Burnham, for advising the government. However, David Miliband defended Milburn claiming that he was serving the country and was not working for the Coalition Government.

In June 2011, Milburn was asked by Andrew Lansley to chair the new clinical commissioning board, as part of the Coalition Government&#x27;s health reforms but he rejected the offer labelling the reforms as &quot;privatization&quot;, &quot;cuts&quot; and a &quot;car crash&quot;.

In 2011, Milburn contributed to &quot;The Purple Book&quot; (alongside other key figures in the Labour Party such as Ed Miliband, Peter Mandelson, Jacqui Smith, Liam Byrne, Tessa Jowell, Tristram Hunt, Stephen Twigg, Rachel Reeves and Liz Kendall). In the book, he called for the Labour Party to adopt a policy of &quot;educational credit&quot;, a system whereby lower and middle-income families whose children attend failing schools can withdraw their children and get funding, worth 150% the cost of education at the failing school, in order to pay for a place at a higher achieving school for the child, with the money coming from the budget of the failing school. The policy was rejected by the leftwing MP Michael Meacher but was welcomed by Labour&#x27;s Shadow Education Secretary Stephen Twigg and other shadow cabinet members.

In 2012, a senior Number 10 adviser called for Andrew Lansley to be &quot;taken out and shot&quot; for introducing the Health and Social Care bill despite widespread opposition, and that Alan Milburn should be ennobled and join the coalition government as Secretary of State for Health. This was rejected by David Cameron and it is understood that Milburn rejected such offer and remained in the Labour Party. He wrote in &quot;The Times&quot; attacking the reforms, but calling for the left to give an alternative.

In July 2012, Milburn was appointed as Chair of the Social Mobility and Child Poverty Commission. He served until his resignation in December 2017.

In 2013 Milburn joined PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) as Chair of PwC&#x27;s UK Health Industry Oversight Board, whose objective is to drive change in the health sector, and assist PwC in growing its presence in the health market. Milburn continued to be chairman of the European Advisory Board at Bridgepoint Capital, whose activities include financing private health care companies providing services ito the NHS, and continued as a member of the Healthcare Advisory Panel at Lloyds Pharmacy. As of 2022 he remains a Senior Adviser to PwC.

In 2015, Milburn became Lancaster University’s third Chancellor, taking over from the mountaineer Chris Bonington.

Early in 2015, Milburn intervened in the British election campaign to criticise Labour&#x27;s health plans, which would limit private sector involvement in the NHS. Milburn was criticised for doing so while having a personal financial interest in the private health sector. In 2017, Milburn was touted as a possible leader of a pro-EU movement after Brexit.

==Personal life==
Milburn married future Labour MEP Mo O&#x27;Toole in 1981; the couple split up in the late 1980s.

Milburn has been in a relationship with Ruth Briel, a consultant psychiatrist, since 1990. They married in 2007. They have two sons.

<text>Heliocentrism (also known as the heliocentric model) is a superseded astronomical model in which the Earth and planets orbit around the Sun at the center of the universe. Historically, heliocentrism was opposed to geocentrism, which placed the Earth at the center. The notion that the Earth revolves around the Sun had been proposed as early as the 3rd century BC by Aristarchus of Samos, who had been influenced by a concept presented by Philolaus of Croton (c. 470 – 385 BC). In the 5th century BC the Greek philosophers Philolaus and Hicetas had the thought on different occasions that the Earth was spherical and revolving around a &quot;mystical&quot; central fire, and that this fire regulated the universe. In medieval Europe, however, Aristarchus&#x27; heliocentrism attracted little attention—possibly because of the loss of scientific works of the Hellenistic period.

It was not until the 16th century that a mathematical model of a heliocentric system was presented by the Renaissance mathematician, astronomer, and Catholic cleric, Nicolaus Copernicus, leading to the Copernican Revolution. In 1576, Thomas Digges published a modified Copernican system. His modifications are close to modern observations. In the following century, Johannes Kepler introduced elliptical orbits, and Galileo Galilei presented supporting observations made using a telescope.

With the observations of William Herschel, Friedrich Bessel, and other astronomers, it was realized that the Sun, while near the barycenter of the Solar System, was not central in the universe. Modern astronomy does not distinguish any center.

==Ancient and medieval astronomy==
While the sphericity of the Earth was widely recognized in Greco-Roman astronomy from at least the 4th century BC, the Earth&#x27;s daily rotation and yearly orbit around the Sun was never universally accepted until the Copernican Revolution.

While a moving Earth was proposed at least from the 4th century BC in Pythagoreanism, and a fully developed heliocentric model was developed by Aristarchus of Samos in the 3rd century BC, these ideas were not successful in replacing the view of a static spherical Earth, and from the 2nd century AD the predominant model, which would be inherited by medieval astronomy, was the geocentric model described in Ptolemy&#x27;s &quot;Almagest&quot;.

The Ptolemaic system was a sophisticated astronomical system that managed to calculate the positions for the planets to a fair degree of accuracy. Ptolemy himself, in his &quot;Almagest&quot;, says that any model for describing the motions of the planets is merely a mathematical device, and since there is no actual way to know which is true, the simplest model that gets the right numbers should be used. However, he rejected the idea of a spinning Earth as absurd as he believed it would create huge winds. Within his model the distances of the Moon, Sun, planets and stars could be determined by treating orbits&#x27; celestial spheres as contiguous realities, which gave the stars&#x27; distance as less than 20 Astronomical Units, a regression, since Aristarchus of Samos&#x27;s heliocentric scheme had centuries earlier necessarily placed the stars at least two orders of magnitude more distant.

Problems with Ptolemy&#x27;s system were well recognized in medieval astronomy, and an increasing effort to criticize and improve it in the late medieval period eventually led to the Copernican heliocentrism developed in Renaissance astronomy.

===Classical antiquity===
====Pythagoreans====
The first non-geocentric model of the universe was proposed by the Pythagorean philosopher Philolaus (d. 390 BC), who taught that at the center of the universe was a &quot;central fire&quot;, around which the Earth, Sun, Moon and planets revolved in uniform circular motion. This system postulated the existence of a counter-earth collinear with the Earth and central fire, with the same period of revolution around the central fire as the Earth. The Sun revolved around the central fire once a year, and the stars were stationary. The Earth maintained the same hidden face towards the central fire, rendering both it and the &quot;counter-earth&quot; invisible from Earth. The Pythagorean concept of uniform circular motion remained unchallenged for approximately the next 2000 years, and it was to the Pythagoreans that Copernicus referred to show that the notion of a moving Earth was neither new nor revolutionary. Kepler gave an alternative explanation of the Pythagoreans&#x27; &quot;central fire&quot; as the Sun, &quot;as most sects purposely hid[e] their teachings&quot;.

Heraclides of Pontus (4th century BC) said that the rotation of the Earth explained the apparent daily motion of the celestial sphere. It used to be thought that he believed Mercury and Venus to revolve around the Sun, which in turn (along with the other planets) revolves around the Earth. Macrobius (AD 395423) later described this as the &quot;Egyptian System,&quot; stating that &quot;it did not escape the skill of the Egyptians,&quot; though there is no other evidence it was known in ancient Egypt.

====Aristarchus of Samos====
The first person known to have proposed a heliocentric system was Aristarchus of Samos . Like his contemporary Eratosthenes, Aristarchus calculated the size of the Earth and measured the sizes and distances of the Sun and Moon. From his estimates, he concluded that the Sun was six to seven times wider than the Earth, and thought that the larger object would have the most attractive force.

His writings on the heliocentric system are lost, but some information about them is known from a brief description by his contemporary, Archimedes, and from scattered references by later writers. Archimedes&#x27; description of Aristarchus&#x27; theory is given in the former&#x27;s book, &quot;The Sand Reckoner&quot;. The entire description comprises just three sentences, which Thomas Heath translates as follows:

Aristarchus presumably took the stars to be very far away because he was aware that their parallax would otherwise be observed over the course of a year. The stars are in fact so far away that stellar parallax only became detectable when sufficiently powerful telescopes had been developed in the 1830s.

No references to Aristarchus&#x27; heliocentrism are known in any other writings from before the common era. The earliest of the handful of other ancient references occur in two passages from the writings of Plutarch. These mention one detail not stated explicitly in Archimedes&#x27; account—namely, that Aristarchus&#x27; theory had the Earth rotating on an axis. The first of these reference occurs in &quot;On the Face in the Orb of the Moon&quot;:

Only scattered fragments of Cleanthes&#x27; writings have survived in quotations by other writers, but in &quot;Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, Diogenes Laërtius lists &quot;A reply to Aristarchus&quot; (Πρὸς Ἀρίσταρχον) as one of Cleanthes&#x27; works, and some scholars have suggested that this might have been where Cleanthes had accused Aristarchus of impiety.

The second of the references by Plutarch is in his &quot;Platonic Questions&quot;:

The remaining references to Aristarchus&#x27; heliocentrism are extremely brief, and provide no more information beyond what can be gleaned from those already cited. Ones which mention Aristarchus explicitly by name occur in Aëtius&#x27; &quot;Opinions of the Philosophers&quot;, Sextus Empiricus&#x27; &quot;Against the Mathematicians&quot;, and an anonymous scholiast to Aristotle. Another passage in Aëtius&#x27; &quot;Opinions of the Philosophers&quot; reports that Seleucus the astronomer had affirmed the Earth&#x27;s motion, but does not mention Aristarchus.

====Seleucus of Seleucia====

Since Plutarch mentions the &quot;followers of Aristarchus&quot; in passing, it is likely that there were other astronomers in the Classical period who also espoused heliocentrism, but whose work was lost. The only other astronomer from antiquity known by name who is known to have supported Aristarchus&#x27; heliocentric model was Seleucus of Seleucia (b. 190 BC), a Hellenistic astronomer who flourished a century after Aristarchus in the Seleucid Empire. Seleucus was a proponent of the heliocentric system of Aristarchus. Seleucus may have proved the heliocentric theory by determining the constants of a geometric model for the heliocentric theory and developing methods to compute planetary positions using this model. He may have used early trigonometric methods that were available in his time, as he was a contemporary of Hipparchus. A fragment of a work by Seleucus has survived in Arabic translation, which was referred to by Rhazes (b. 865).

Alternatively, his explanation may have involved the phenomenon of tides, which he supposedly theorized to be caused by the attraction to the Moon and by the revolution of the Earth around the Earth and Moon&#x27;s center of mass.

====Late antiquity====
There were occasional speculations about heliocentrism in Europe before Copernicus. In Roman Carthage, the pagan Martianus Capella (5th century AD) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun. Capella&#x27;s model was discussed in the Early Middle Ages by various anonymous 9th-century commentators and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work. Also Macrobius (420 CE) described a heliocentric model.

===Ancient India===
Aryabhata (476–550), in his magnum opus &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot; (499), propounded a planetary model in which the Earth was taken to be spinning on its axis and the periods of the planets were given with respect to the Sun. His immediate commentators, such as Lalla, and other later authors, rejected his innovative view about the turning Earth. It has been argued that Aryabhatta&#x27;s calculations were based on an underlying heliocentric model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, although this has also been rebutted. The general consensus is that a synodic anomaly (depending on the position of the Sun) does not imply a physically heliocentric orbit (such corrections being also present in late Babylonian astronomical texts), and that Aryabhata&#x27;s system was not explicitly heliocentric. He also made many astronomical calculations, such as the times of the solar and lunar eclipses, and the instantaneous motion of the Moon. Early followers of Aryabhata&#x27;s model included Varahamihira, Brahmagupta, and Bhaskara II.

===Medieval Islamic world===

For a time, Muslim astronomers accepted the Ptolemaic system and the geocentric model, which were used by to show that the distance between the Sun and the Earth varies. In the 10th century, accepted that the Earth rotates around its axis. According to later astronomer al-Biruni, al-Sijzi invented an astrolabe called &quot;al-zūraqī&quot; based on a belief held by some of his contemporaries that the apparent motion of the stars was due to the Earth&#x27;s movement, and not that of the firmament. Islamic astronomers began to criticize the Ptolemaic model, including Ibn al-Haytham in his &quot; &#x27;alā Baṭalamiyūs&quot; (&quot;Doubts Concerning Ptolemy&quot;, c. 1028), who found contradictions in Ptolemy&#x27;s model, but al-Haytham remained committed to a geocentric model.
Al-Biruni discussed the possibility of whether the Earth rotated about its own axis and orbited the Sun, but in his &quot;Masudic Canon&quot; (1031), he expressed his faith in a geocentric and stationary Earth. He was aware that if the Earth rotated on its axis, it would be consistent with his astronomical observations, but considered it a problem of natural philosophy rather than one of mathematics.

In the 12th century, non-heliocentric alternatives to the Ptolemaic system were developed by some Islamic astronomers, such as Nur ad-Din al-Bitruji, who considered the Ptolemaic model mathematical, and not physical. His system spread throughout most of Europe in the 13th century, with debates and refutations of his ideas continued to the 16th century.

The Maragha school of astronomy in Ilkhanid-era Persia further developed &quot;non-Ptolemaic&quot; planetary models involving Earth&#x27;s rotation. Notable astronomers of this school are Al-Urdi (d. 1266) Al-Katibi (d. 1277), and Al-Tusi (d. 1274).

The arguments and evidence used resemble those used by Copernicus to support the Earth&#x27;s motion.
The criticism of Ptolemy as developed by Averroes and by the Maragha school explicitly address the Earth&#x27;s rotation but it did not arrive at explicit heliocentrism.
The observations of the Maragha school were further improved at the Timurid-era Samarkand observatory under Qushji (1403–1474).

===Medieval India===
In India, Nilakantha Somayaji (1444–1544), in his &quot;Aryabhatiyabhasya&quot;, a commentary on Aryabhata&#x27;s &quot;Aryabhatiya&quot;, developed a computational system for a geo-heliocentric planetary model, in which the planets orbit the Sun, which in turn orbits the Earth, similar to the system later proposed by Tycho Brahe. In the &quot;Tantrasamgraha&quot; (1501), Somayaji further revised his planetary system, which was mathematically more accurate at predicting the heliocentric orbits of the interior planets than both the Tychonic and Copernican models, but did not propose any specific models of the universe. Nilakantha&#x27;s planetary system also incorporated the Earth&#x27;s rotation on its axis. Most astronomers of the Kerala school of astronomy and mathematics seem to have accepted his planetary model.

==Renaissance-era astronomy==
===Medieval period===
Martianus Capella (5th century CE) expressed the opinion that the planets Venus and Mercury did not go about the Earth but instead circled the Sun. Capella&#x27;s model was discussed in the Early Middle Ages by various anonymous 9th-century commentators and Copernicus mentions him as an influence on his own work. Macrobius (420 CE) described a heliocentric model. John Scotus Eriugena(815-877 CE) proposed a model reminiscent of that from Tycho Brahe.

In the 14th century, bishop Nicole Oresme discussed the possibility that the Earth rotated on its axis, while Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa in his &quot;Learned Ignorance&quot; asked whether there was any reason to assert that the Sun (or any other point) was the center of the universe. In parallel to a mystical definition of God, Cusa wrote that &quot;Thus the fabric of the world (&quot;machina mundi&quot;) will &quot;quasi&quot; have its center everywhere and circumference nowhere,&quot; recalling Hermes Trismegistus.

Some historians maintain that the thought of the Maragheh observatory, in particular the mathematical devices known as the Urdi lemma and the Tusi couple, influenced Renaissance-era European astronomy, and thus was indirectly received by Renaissance-era European astronomy and thus by Copernicus.
Copernicus used such devices in the same planetary models as found in Arabic sources. The exact replacement of the equant by two epicycles used by Copernicus in the &quot;Commentariolus&quot; was found in an earlier work by Ibn al-Shatir (d. c. 1375) of Damascus. Copernicus&#x27; lunar and Mercury models are also identical to Ibn al-Shatir&#x27;s.

While the influence of the criticism of Ptolemy by Averroes on Renaissance thought is clear and explicit, the claim of direct influence of the
Maragha school, postulated by Otto E. Neugebauer in 1957, remains an open question. Since the Tusi couple was used by Copernicus in his reformulation of mathematical astronomy, there is a growing consensus that he became aware of this idea in some way. One possible route of transmission may have been through Byzantine science, which translated some of al-Tusi&#x27;s works from Arabic into Byzantine Greek. Several Byzantine Greek manuscripts containing the Tusi couple are still extant in Italy. The Mathematics Genealogy Project suggests that there is a &quot;genealogy&quot; of Nasir al-Dīn al-Ṭūsī → Shams al‐Dīn al‐Bukhārī → Gregory Chioniades → Manuel Bryennios → Theodore Metochites → Gregory Palamas → Nilos Kabasilas → Demetrios Kydones → Gemistos Plethon → Basilios Bessarion → Johannes Regiomontanus → Domenico Maria Novara da Ferrara → Nicolaus (Mikołaj Kopernik) Copernicus. Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519) wrote &quot;Il sole non si move.&quot; (&quot;The Sun does not move.&quot;) and he was a student of a student of Bessarion according to the Mathematics Genealogy Project. It has been suggested that the idea of the Tusi couple may have arrived in Europe leaving few manuscript traces, since it could have occurred without the translation of any Arabic text into Latin.

Other scholars have argued that Copernicus could well have developed these ideas independently of the late Islamic tradition. Copernicus explicitly references several astronomers of the &quot;Islamic Golden Age&quot; (10th to 12th centuries) in &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;: Albategnius (Al-Battani), Averroes (Ibn Rushd), Thebit (Thabit Ibn Qurra), Arzachel (Al-Zarqali), and Alpetragius (Al-Bitruji), but he does not show awareness of the existence of any of the later astronomers of the Maragha school.

It has been argued that Copernicus could have independently discovered the Tusi couple or took the idea from Proclus&#x27;s &quot;Commentary on the First Book of Euclid&quot;, which Copernicus cited. Another possible source for Copernicus&#x27; knowledge of this mathematical device is the &quot;Questiones de Spera&quot; of Nicole Oresme, who described how a reciprocating linear motion of a celestial body could be produced by a combination of circular motions similar to those proposed by al-Tusi.

The state of knowledge on planetary theory received by Copernicus is summarized in Georg von Peuerbach&#x27;s &quot;Theoricae Novae Planetarum&quot; (printed in 1472 by Regiomontanus). By 1470, the accuracy of observations by the Vienna school of astronomy, of which Peuerbach and Regiomontanus were members, was high enough to make the eventual development of heliocentrism inevitable, and indeed it is possible that Regiomontanus did arrive at an explicit theory of heliocentrism before his death in 1476, some 30 years before Copernicus.

===Copernican heliocentrism===

Nicolaus Copernicus in his &quot;De revolutionibus orbium coelestium&quot; (&quot;On the revolution of heavenly spheres&quot;, first printed in 1543 in Nuremberg), presented a discussion of a heliocentric model of the universe in much the same way as Ptolemy in the 2nd century had presented his geocentric model in his &quot;Almagest&quot;. Copernicus discussed the philosophical implications of his proposed system, elaborated it in geometrical detail, used selected astronomical observations to derive the parameters of his model, and wrote astronomical tables which enabled one to compute the past and future positions of the stars and planets. In doing so, Copernicus moved heliocentrism from philosophical speculation to predictive geometrical astronomy. In reality, Copernicus&#x27; system did not predict the planets&#x27; positions any better than the Ptolemaic system. This theory resolved the issue of planetary retrograde motion by arguing that such motion was only perceived and apparent, rather than real: it was a parallax effect, as an object that one is passing seems to move backwards against the horizon. This issue was also resolved in the geocentric Tychonic system; the latter, however, while eliminating the major epicycles, retained as a physical reality the irregular back-and-forth motion of the planets, which Kepler characterized as a &quot;pretzel&quot;.

Copernicus cited Aristarchus in an early (unpublished) manuscript of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; (which still survives), stating: &quot;Philolaus believed in the mobility of the earth, and some even say that Aristarchus of Samos was of that opinion.&quot; However, in the published version he restricts himself to noting that in works by Cicero he had found an account of the theories of Hicetas and that Plutarch had provided him with an account of the Pythagoreans, Heraclides Ponticus, Philolaus, and Ecphantus. These authors had proposed a moving Earth, which did not, however, revolve around a central sun.

==Reception in Early Modern Europe==
===Circulation of Commentariolus (published before 1515)===
The first information about the heliocentric views of Nicolaus Copernicus was circulated in manuscript completed some time before May 1, 1514. In 1533, Johann Albrecht Widmannstetter delivered in Rome a series of lectures outlining Copernicus&#x27; theory. The lectures were heard with interest by Pope Clement VII and several Catholic cardinals.

In 1539, Martin Luther purportedly said:

This was reported in the context of a conversation at the dinner table and not a formal statement of faith. Melanchthon, however, opposed the doctrine over a period of years.

===Publication of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; (1543)===
Nicolaus Copernicus published the definitive statement of his system in &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; in 1543. Copernicus began to write it in 1506 and finished it in 1530, but did not publish it until the year of his death. Although he was in good standing with the Church and had dedicated the book to Pope Paul III, the published form contained an unsigned preface by Osiander defending the system and arguing that it was useful for computation even if its hypotheses were not necessarily true. Possibly because of that preface, the work of Copernicus inspired very little debate on whether it might be heretical during the next 60 years. There was an early suggestion among Dominicans that the teaching of heliocentrism should be banned, but nothing came of it at the time.

Some years after the publication of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; John Calvin preached a sermon in which he denounced those who &quot;pervert the order of nature&quot; by saying that &quot;the sun does not move and that it is the earth that revolves and that it turns&quot;.

===Tycho Brahe&#x27;s geo-heliocentric system (c. 1587)===

Prior to the publication of &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot;, the most widely accepted system had been proposed by Ptolemy, in which the Earth was the center of the universe and all celestial bodies orbited it. Tycho Brahe, arguably the most accomplished astronomer of his time, advocated against Copernicus&#x27; heliocentric system and for an alternative to the Ptolemaic geocentric system: a geo-heliocentric system now known as the Tychonic system in which the Sun and Moon orbit the Earth, Mercury and Venus orbit the Sun inside the Sun&#x27;s orbit of the Earth, and Mars, Jupiter and Saturn orbit the Sun outside the Sun&#x27;s orbit of the Earth.

Tycho appreciated the Copernican system, but objected to the idea of a moving Earth on the basis of physics, astronomy, and religion. The Aristotelian physics of the time (modern Newtonian physics was still a century away) offered no physical explanation for the motion of a massive body like Earth, whereas it could easily explain the motion of heavenly bodies by postulating that they were made of a different sort substance called aether that moved naturally. So Tycho said that the Copernican system &quot;&quot;...expertly and completely circumvents all that is superfluous or discordant in the system of Ptolemy. On no point does it offend the principle of mathematics. Yet it ascribes to the Earth, that hulking, lazy body, unfit for motion, a motion as quick as that of the aethereal torches, and a triple motion at that.&quot; Likewise, Tycho took issue with the vast distances to the stars that Aristarchus and Copernicus had assumed in order to explain the lack of any visible parallax. Tycho had measured the apparent sizes of stars (now known to be illusory), and used geometry to calculate that in order to both have those apparent sizes and be as far away as heliocentrism required, stars would have to be huge (much larger than the sun; the size of Earth&#x27;s orbit or larger). Regarding this Tycho wrote, &quot;Deduce these things geometrically if you like, and you will see how many absurdities (not to mention others) accompany this assumption [of the motion of the earth] by inference.&quot;&quot; He also cited the Copernican system&#x27;s &quot;&quot;opposition to the authority of Sacred Scripture in more than one place&quot; as a reason why one might wish to reject it, and observed that his own geo-heliocentric alternative &quot;offended neither the principles of physics nor Holy Scripture&quot;.&quot;

The Jesuits astronomers in Rome were at first unreceptive to Tycho&#x27;s system; the most prominent, Clavius, commented that Tycho was &quot;confusing all of astronomy, because he wants to have Mars lower than the Sun.&quot; However, after the advent of the telescope showed problems with some geocentric models (by demonstrating that Venus circles the Sun, for example), the Tychonic system and variations on that system became popular among geocentrists, and the Jesuit astronomer Giovanni Battista Riccioli would continue Tycho&#x27;s use of physics, stellar astronomy (now with a telescope), and religion to argue against heliocentrism and for Tycho&#x27;s system well into the seventeenth century.

===Giordano Bruno===
Giordano Bruno is the only known person to defend Copernicus&#x27; heliocentrism in his time. In 1584, Bruno published two important philosophical dialogues (&quot;La Cena de le Ceneri&quot; and &quot;De l&#x27;infinito universo et mondi&quot;) in which he argued against the planetary spheres (Christoph Rothmann did the same in 1586 as did Tycho Brahe in 1587) and affirmed the Copernican principle.

In particular, to support the Copernican view and oppose the objection according to which the motion of the Earth would be perceived by means of the motion of winds, clouds etc., in &quot;La Cena de le Ceneri&quot; Bruno anticipates some of the arguments of Galilei on the relativity principle. Note that he also uses the example now known as Galileo&#x27;s ship.

====Imprisonment, trial and execution, 1593–1600====
During the seven years of his trial in Rome, Bruno was held in confinement, lastly in the Tower of Nona.

Bruno defended himself as he had in Venice, insisting that he accepted the Church&#x27;s dogmatic teachings, but trying to preserve the basis of his cosmological views. In particular, he held firm to his belief in the plurality of worlds, although he was admonished to abandon it. Teaching that belief was among the charges the Inquisition made against him. His trial was overseen by the Inquisitor Cardinal Bellarmine, who demanded a full recantation, which Bruno eventually refused. On 20 January 1600, Pope Clement VIII declared Bruno a heretic, and the Inquisition issued a sentence of death. According to the correspondence of Gaspar Schopp of Breslau, he is said to have made a threatening gesture towards his judges and to have replied:

&quot;Maiori forsan cum timore sententiam in me fertis quam ego accipiam&quot; (&quot;Perhaps you pronounce this sentence against me with greater fear than I receive it&quot;).

He was turned over to the secular authorities. On 17 February 1600, in the Campo de&#x27; Fiori (a central Roman market square), naked, with his &quot;tongue imprisoned because of his wicked words&quot;, he was burned alive at the stake. His ashes were thrown into the Tiber river. On the 400th anniversary of Bruno&#x27;s death, in 2000, Pope John Paul II made a general apology for &quot;the use of violence that some have committed in the service of truth&quot;.

===Johannes Kepler===
Using measurements made at Tycho&#x27;s observatory, Johannes Kepler developed his laws of planetary motion between 1609 and 1619. In &quot;Astronomia nova&quot; (1609), Kepler made a diagram of the movement of Mars in relation to Earth if Earth were at the center of its orbit, which shows that Mars&#x27; orbit would be completely imperfect and never follow along the same path. To solve the apparent derivation of Mars&#x27; orbit from a perfect circle, Kepler derived both a mathematical definition and, independently, a matching ellipse around the Sun to explain the motion of the red planet.

Between 1617 and 1621, Kepler developed a heliocentric model of the Solar System in &quot;Epitome astronomiae Copernicanae&quot;, in which all the planets have elliptical orbits. This provided significantly increased accuracy in predicting the position of the planets. Kepler&#x27;s ideas were not immediately accepted, and Galileo for example ignored them. In 1621, &quot;Epitome astronomia Copernicanae&quot; was placed on the Catholic Church&#x27;s index of prohibited books despite Kepler being a Protestant.

===Galileo Galilei and 1616 ban against Copernicanism===

Galileo was able to look at the night sky with the newly invented telescope. He published his observations that Jupiter is orbited by moons and that the Sun rotates in his &quot;Sidereus Nuncius&quot; (1610) and &quot;Letters on Sunspots&quot; (1613), respectively. Around this time, he also announced that Venus exhibits a full range of phases (satisfying an argument that had been made against Copernicus). As the Jesuit astronomers confirmed Galileo&#x27;s observations, the Jesuits moved away from the Ptolemaic model and toward Tycho&#x27;s teachings.

In his 1615 &quot;Letter to the Grand Duchess Christina&quot;, Galileo defended heliocentrism, and claimed it was not contrary to Holy Scripture. He took Augustine&#x27;s position on Scripture: not to take every passage literally when the scripture in question is in a Bible book of poetry and songs, not a book of instructions or history. The writers of the Scripture wrote from the perspective of the terrestrial world, and from that vantage point the Sun does rise and set. In fact, it is the Earth&#x27;s rotation which gives the impression of the Sun in motion across the sky.
In February 1615, prominent Dominicans including Thomaso Caccini and Niccolò Lorini brought Galileo&#x27;s writings on heliocentrism to the attention of the Inquisition, because they appeared to violate Holy Scripture and the decrees of the Council of Trent. Cardinal and Inquisitor Robert Bellarmine was called upon to adjudicate, and wrote in April that treating heliocentrism as a real phenomenon would be &quot;a very dangerous thing,&quot; irritating philosophers and theologians, and harming &quot;the Holy Faith by rendering Holy Scripture as false.&quot;

In January 1616, Msgr. Francesco Ingoli addressed an essay to Galileo disputing the Copernican system. Galileo later stated that he believed this essay to have been instrumental in the ban against Copernicanism that followed in February. According to Maurice Finocchiaro, Ingoli had probably been commissioned by the Inquisition to write an expert opinion on the controversy, and the essay provided the &quot;chief direct basis&quot; for the ban. The essay focused on eighteen physical and mathematical arguments against heliocentrism. It borrowed primarily from the arguments of Tycho Brahe, and it notedly mentioned the problem that heliocentrism requires the stars to be much larger than the Sun. Ingoli wrote that the great distance to the stars in the heliocentric theory &quot;clearly proves ... the fixed stars to be of such size, as they may surpass or equal the size of the orbit circle of the Earth itself.&quot; Ingoli included four theological arguments in the essay, but suggested to Galileo that he focus on the physical and mathematical arguments. Galileo did not write a response to Ingoli until 1624.

In February 1616, the Inquisition assembled a committee of theologians, known as qualifiers, who delivered their unanimous report condemning heliocentrism as &quot;foolish and absurd in philosophy, and formally heretical since it explicitly contradicts in many places the sense of Holy Scripture.&quot; The Inquisition also determined that the Earth&#x27;s motion &quot;receives the same judgement in philosophy and ... in regard to theological truth it is at least erroneous in faith.&quot; Bellarmine personally ordered Galileo

In March 1616, after the Inquisition&#x27;s injunction against Galileo, the papal Master of the Sacred Palace, Congregation of the Index, and the Pope banned all books and letters advocating the Copernican system, which they called &quot;the false Pythagorean doctrine, altogether contrary to Holy Scripture.&quot; In 1618, the Holy Office recommended that a modified version of Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; be allowed for use in calendric calculations, though the original publication remained forbidden until 1758.

Pope Urban VIII encouraged Galileo to publish the pros and cons of heliocentrism. Galileo&#x27;s response, &quot;Dialogue concerning the two chief world systems&quot; (1632), clearly advocated heliocentrism, despite his declaration in the preface that,

&quot;I will endeavour to show that all experiments that can be made upon the Earth are insufficient means to conclude for its mobility but are indifferently applicable to the Earth, movable or immovable...&quot;
and his straightforward statement,

&quot;I might very rationally put it in dispute, whether there be any such centre in nature, or no; being that neither you nor any one else hath ever proved, whether the World be finite and figurate, or else infinite and interminate; yet nevertheless granting you, for the present, that it is finite, and of a terminate Spherical Figure, and that thereupon it hath its centre...&quot;
Some ecclesiastics also interpreted the book as characterizing the Pope as a simpleton, since his viewpoint in the dialogue was advocated by the character Simplicio. Urban VIII became hostile to Galileo and he was again summoned to Rome. Galileo&#x27;s trial in 1633 involved making fine distinctions between &quot;teaching&quot; and &quot;holding and defending as true&quot;. For advancing heliocentric theory Galileo was forced to recant Copernicanism and was put under house arrest for the last few years of his life. According to J. L. Heilbron, informed contemporaries of Galileo&#x27;s &quot;appreciated that the reference to heresy in connection with Galileo or Copernicus had no general or theological significance.&quot;

In 1664, Pope Alexander VII published his &quot;Index Librorum Prohibitorum Alexandri VII Pontificis Maximi jussu editus&quot; (Index of Prohibited Books, published by order of Alexander VII, P.M.) which included all previous condemnations of heliocentric books.

===Age of Reason===
René Descartes&#x27; first cosmological treatise, written between 1629 and 1633 and titled &quot;The World&quot;, included a heliocentric model, but Descartes abandoned it in the light of Galileo&#x27;s treatment. In his &quot;Principles of Philosophy&quot; (1644), Descartes introduced a mechanical model in which planets do not move relative to their immediate atmosphere, but are constituted around space-matter vortices in curved space; these rotate due to centrifugal force and the resulting centripetal pressure. The Galileo affair did little overall to slow the spread of heliocentrism across Europe, as Kepler&#x27;s &quot;Epitome of Copernican Astronomy&quot; became increasingly influential in the coming decades. By 1686, the model was well enough established that the general public was reading about it in &quot;Conversations on the Plurality of Worlds&quot;, published in France by Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle and translated into English and other languages in the coming years. It has been called &quot;one of the first great popularizations of science.&quot;

In 1687, Isaac Newton published &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, which provided an explanation for Kepler&#x27;s laws in terms of universal gravitation and what came to be known as Newton&#x27;s laws of motion. This placed heliocentrism on a firm theoretical foundation, although Newton&#x27;s heliocentrism was of a somewhat modern kind. Already in the mid-1680s he recognized the &quot;deviation of the Sun&quot; from the center of gravity of the Solar System. For Newton it was not precisely the center of the Sun or any other body that could be considered at rest, but &quot;the common centre of gravity of the Earth, the Sun and all the Planets is to be esteem&#x27;d the Centre of the World&quot;, and this center of gravity &quot;either is at rest or moves uniformly forward in a right line&quot;. Newton adopted the &quot;at rest&quot; alternative in view of common consent that the center, wherever it was, was at rest.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Church remained opposed to heliocentrism as a literal description, but this did not by any means imply opposition to all astronomy; indeed, it needed observational data to maintain its calendar. In support of this effort it allowed the cathedrals themselves to be used as solar observatories called &quot;meridiane&quot;; i.e., they were turned into &quot;reverse sundials&quot;, or gigantic pinhole cameras, where the Sun&#x27;s image was projected from a hole in a window in the cathedral&#x27;s lantern onto a meridian line.
In the mid-18th century the Church&#x27;s opposition began to fade. An annotated copy of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; was published in 1742 by Fathers le Seur and Jacquier of the Franciscan Minims, two Catholic mathematicians, with a preface stating that the author&#x27;s work assumed heliocentrism and could not be explained without the theory. In 1758 the Catholic Church dropped the general prohibition of books advocating heliocentrism from the &quot;Index of Forbidden Books&quot;. The Observatory of the Roman College was established by Pope Clement XIV in 1774 (nationalized in 1878, but re-founded by Pope Leo XIII as the Vatican Observatory in 1891). In spite of dropping its active resistance to heliocentrism, the Catholic Church did not lift the prohibition of uncensored versions of Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; or Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot;. The affair was revived in 1820, when the Master of the Sacred Palace (the Catholic Church&#x27;s chief censor), Filippo Anfossi, refused to license a book by a Catholic canon, Giuseppe Settele, because it openly treated heliocentrism as a physical fact. Settele appealed to pope Pius VII. After the matter had been reconsidered by the Congregation of the Index and the Holy Office, Anfossi&#x27;s decision was overturned. Pius VII approved a decree in 1822 by the Sacred Congregation of the Inquisition to allow the printing of heliocentric books in Rome. Copernicus&#x27; &quot;De Revolutionibus&quot; and Galileo&#x27;s &quot;Dialogue&quot; were then subsequently omitted from the next edition of the &quot;Index&quot; when it appeared in 1835.

Three apparent proofs of the heliocentric hypothesis were provided in 1727 by James Bradley, in 1838 by Friedrich Wilhelm Bessel, and in 1851 by Léon Foucault. Bradley discovered the stellar aberration, proving the relative motion of the Earth. Bessel proved that the parallax of a star was greater than zero by measuring the parallax of 0.314 arcseconds of a star named 61 Cygni. In the same year Friedrich Georg Wilhelm Struve and Thomas Henderson measured the parallaxes of other stars, Vega and Alpha Centauri. Experiments like those of Foucault were performed by V. Viviani in 1661 in Florence and by Bartolini in 1833 in Rimini.

==Reception in Judaism==
Already in the Talmud, Greek philosophy and science under the general name &quot;Greek wisdom&quot; were considered dangerous. They were put under ban then and later for some periods.
The first Jewish scholar to describe the Copernican system, albeit without mentioning Copernicus by name, was Maharal of Prague, in his book &quot;Be&#x27;er ha-Golah&quot; (1593). Maharal makes an argument of radical skepticism, arguing that no scientific theory can be reliable, which he illustrates by the new-fangled theory of heliocentrism upsetting even the most fundamental views on the cosmos.

Copernicus is mentioned in the books of David Gans (1541–1613), who worked with Brahe and Kepler. Gans wrote two books on astronomy in Hebrew: a short one, &quot;Magen David&quot; (1612), and a full one, &quot;Nehmad veNaim&quot; (published only in 1743). He described objectively three systems: those of Ptolemy, Copernicus and Brahe, without taking sides.
Joseph Solomon Delmedigo (1591–1655) in his &quot;Elim&quot; (1629) says that the arguments of Copernicus are so strong, that only an imbecile will not accept them. Delmedigo studied at Padua and was acquainted with Galileo.

An actual controversy on the Copernican model within Judaism arises only in the early 18th century. Most authors in this period had accepted Copernican heliocentrism, with opposition from David Nieto and Tobias Cohn, who argued against heliocentrism on the grounds it contradicted scripture. Nieto merely rejected the new system on those grounds without much passion, whereas Cohn went so far as to call Copernicus &quot;a first-born of Satan&quot;, though he also acknowledged that he would have found it difficult to proffer one particular objection based on a passage from the Talmud.

In the 19th century, two students of the Hatam Sofer wrote books that were given approbations by him even though one supported heliocentrism and the other geocentrism. One, a commentary on Genesis titled &quot;Yafe’ah le-Ketz&quot; written by R. Israel David Schlesinger resisted a heliocentric model and supported geocentrism. The other, &quot;Mei Menuchot&quot; written by R. Eliezer Lipmann Neusatz encouraged acceptance of the heliocentric model and other modern scientific thinking.

Since the 20th century most Jews have not questioned the science of heliocentrism. Exceptions include Shlomo Benizri and R. M.M. Schneerson of Chabad who argued that the question of heliocentrism vs. geocentrism is obsolete because of the relativity of motion. Schneerson&#x27;s followers in Chabad continue to deny the heliocentric model.

==Modern science==
===William Herschel&#x27;s heliocentrism===

In 1783, amateur astronomer William Herschel attempted to determine the shape of the universe by examining stars through his handmade telescopes. Herschel was the first to propose a model of the universe based on observation and measurement. At that time, the dominant assumption in cosmology was that the Milky Way was the entire universe, an assumption that has since been proven wrong with observations. Herschel concluded that it was in the shape of a disk, but assumed that the Sun was in the center of the disk, making the model heliocentric.

Seeing that the stars belonging to the Milky Way appeared to encircle the Earth, Herschel carefully counted stars of given apparent magnitudes, and after finding the numbers were the same in all directions, concluded Earth must be close to the center of the Milky Way. However, there were two flaws in Herschel&#x27;s methodology: magnitude is not a reliable index to the distance of stars, and some of the areas that he mistook for empty space were actually dark, obscuring nebulae that blocked his view toward the center of the Milky Way.

The Herschel model remained relatively unchallenged for the next hundred years, with minor refinements. Jacobus Kapteyn introduced motion, density, and luminosity to Herschel&#x27;s star counts, which still implied a near-central location of the Sun.

===Replacement with galactocentrism and acentrism===
Already in the early 19th century, Thomas Wright and Immanuel Kant speculated that fuzzy patches of light called nebulae were actually distant &quot;island universes&quot; consisting of many stellar systems. The shape of the Milky Way galaxy was expected to resemble such &quot;islands universes.&quot;

However, &quot;scientific arguments were marshalled against such a possibility,&quot; and this view was rejected by almost all scientists until the early 20th century, with Harlow Shapley&#x27;s work on globular clusters and Edwin Hubble&#x27;s measurements in 1924. After Shapley and Hubble showed that the Sun is not the center of the universe, cosmology moved on from heliocentrism to galactocentrism, which states that the Milky Way is the center of the universe.

Hubble&#x27;s observations of redshift in light from distant galaxies indicated that the universe was expanding and acentric. As a result, soon after galactocentrism was formulated, it was abandoned in favor of the Big Bang model of the acentric expanding universe. Further assumptions, such as the Copernican principle, the cosmological principle, dark energy, and dark matter, eventually lead to the current model of cosmology, Lambda-CDM.

===Special relativity and the &quot;center&quot;===

The concept of an absolute velocity, including being &quot;at rest&quot; as a particular case, is ruled out by the principle of relativity, also eliminating any obvious &quot;center&quot; of the universe as a natural origin of coordinates. Even if the discussion is limited to the Solar System, the Sun is not at the geometric center of any planet&#x27;s orbit, but rather approximately at one focus of the elliptical orbit. Furthermore, to the extent that a planet&#x27;s mass cannot be neglected in comparison to the Sun&#x27;s mass, the center of gravity of the Solar System is displaced slightly away from the center of the Sun. (The masses of the planets, mostly Jupiter, amount to 0.14% of that of the Sun.) Therefore, a hypothetical astronomer on an extrasolar planet would observe a small &quot;wobble&quot; in the Sun&#x27;s motion.

===Modern use of &quot;geocentric&quot; and &quot;heliocentric&quot;===
In modern calculations, the terms &quot;geocentric&quot; and &quot;heliocentric&quot; are often used to refer to reference frames. In such systems the origin in the center of mass of the Earth, of the Earth–Moon system, of the Sun, of the Sun plus the major planets, or of the entire Solar System, can be selected. Right ascension and declination are examples of geocentric coordinates, used in Earth-based observations, while the heliocentric latitude and longitude are used for orbital calculations. This leads to such terms as &quot;heliocentric velocity&quot; and &quot;heliocentric angular momentum&quot;. In this heliocentric picture, any planet of the Solar System can be used as a source of mechanical energy because it moves relatively to the Sun. A smaller body (either artificial or natural) may gain heliocentric velocity due to gravity assist – this effect can change the body&#x27;s mechanical energy in heliocentric reference frame (although it will not changed in the planetary one). However, such selection of &quot;geocentric&quot; or &quot;heliocentric&quot; frames is merely a matter of computation. It does not have philosophical implications and does not constitute a distinct physical or scientific model. From the point of view of general relativity, inertial reference frames do not exist at all, and any practical reference frame is only an approximation to the actual space-time, which can have higher or lower precision. Some forms of Mach&#x27;s principle consider the frame at rest with respect to the distant masses in the universe to have special properties.

<text>Zodiac: An Eco-Thriller (1988) is a novel by American writer Neal Stephenson. His second novel, it tells the story of an environmentalist, Sangamon Taylor, uncovering a conspiracy involving industrialist polluters in Boston Harbor. The &quot;Zodiac&quot; of the title refers to the brand of inflatable motor boats the hero uses to get around the city efficiently. His opponents attempt to frame him as an ecoterrorist.

The protagonist is inspired by environmental chemist Marco Kaltofen. Taylor is a recreational user of nitrous oxide, justifying his choice of drug by the eponymous Sangamon&#x27;s principle: &quot;the simpler the molecule, the better the drug&quot;.

==Plot==
In the novel, Taylor is a chemist working for GEE, a fictional environmental activism group which stages both protests and direct actions plugging toxic waste pipes. Taylor becomes involved with Basco Industries, a fictional corporation which produced Agent Orange and is a major supplier of organic chlorine compounds. Basco experiments with genetic engineering to develop chemical producing microbes, driving Taylor&#x27;s efforts to expose their crimes and preserve Boston Harbor.

A number of the later events of the novel take place on Boston Harbor&#x27;s Spectacle Island which at the time of publication was almost entirely composed of garbage. In the story it is frequented by drugged-out and reputedly Satanic groupies of the &quot;two-umlaut&quot; heavy metal music band, Pöyzen Böyzen, who are too intoxicated with angel dust to realize they are poisoning themselves with the toxic waste that was dumped there.

Taylor&#x27;s projects involve sampling the concentration of polychlorinated biphenyls in Boston Harbor with the help of the Gallaghers, a fishing family who record the location of the lobsters they catch. While gathering evidence which GEE will use to expose Basco&#x27;s crimes, Taylor is flummoxed by the fact that the toxins have suddenly disappeared. He eventually discovers that Basco has acquired a bioengineering firm, where his high school nemesis is employed as a genetic engineer, to create a bacterium that is able to digest toxins, cleaning up the harbor instantly. However, Basco had been forced to release the bacteria into the wild without full testing because of their imminent exposure by GEE. Depending on the equilibrium state of the harbor, the new bacteria are also able to create toxins.

To stop Taylor meddling with their plans, Basco discredits him by planting a bomb in his house and framing him as a terrorist trying to assassinate their president. He escapes with the help of a Native American tribe and eventually returns in secret to steal one of their ships containing a large amount of toxins which they are planning to release into the ocean.

<text>In computer science, a lock or mutex (from mutual exclusion) is a synchronization primitive that prevents state from being modified or accessed by multiple threads of execution at once. Locks enforce mutual exclusion concurrency control policies, and with a variety of possible methods there exist multiple unique implementations for different applications.

==Types==
Generally, locks are &quot;advisory locks&quot;, where each thread cooperates by acquiring the lock before accessing the corresponding data. Some systems also implement &quot;mandatory locks&quot;, where attempting unauthorized access to a locked resource will force an exception in the entity attempting to make the access.

The simplest type of lock is a binary semaphore. It provides exclusive access to the locked data. Other schemes also provide shared access for reading data. Other widely implemented access modes are exclusive, intend-to-exclude and intend-to-upgrade.

Another way to classify locks is by what happens when the lock strategy prevents the progress of a thread. Most locking designs block the execution of the thread requesting the lock until it is allowed to access the locked resource. With a spinlock, the thread simply waits (&quot;spins&quot;) until the lock becomes available. This is efficient if threads are blocked for a short time, because it avoids the overhead of operating system process re-scheduling. It is inefficient if the lock is held for a long time, or if the progress of the thread that is holding the lock depends on preemption of the locked thread.

Locks typically require hardware support for efficient implementation. This support usually takes the form of one or more atomic instructions such as &quot;test-and-set&quot;, &quot;fetch-and-add&quot; or &quot;compare-and-swap&quot;. These instructions allow a single process to test if the lock is free, and if free, acquire the lock in a single atomic operation.

Uniprocessor architectures have the option of using uninterruptible sequences of instructions—using special instructions or instruction prefixes to disable interrupts temporarily—but this technique does not work for multiprocessor shared-memory machines. Proper support for locks in a multiprocessor environment can require quite complex hardware or software support, with substantial synchronization issues.

The reason an atomic operation is required is because of concurrency, where more than one task executes the same logic. For example, consider the following C code:

if (lock == 0) {
 // lock free, set it
 lock = myPID;


The above example does not guarantee that the task has the lock, since more than one task can be testing the lock at the same time. Since both tasks will detect that the lock is free, both tasks will attempt to set the lock, not knowing that the other task is also setting the lock. Dekker&#x27;s or Peterson&#x27;s algorithm are possible substitutes if atomic locking operations are not available.

Careless use of locks can result in deadlock or livelock. A number of strategies can be used to avoid or recover from deadlocks or livelocks, both at design-time and at run-time. (The most common strategy is to standardize the lock acquisition sequences so that combinations of inter-dependent locks are always acquired in a specifically defined &quot;cascade&quot; order.)

Some languages do support locks syntactically. An example in C# follows:

public class Account // This is a monitor of an account
 // Use `object` in versions earlier than C# 13
 private readonly Lock _balanceLock = new();
 private decimal _balance = 0;

 public void Deposit(decimal amount)
 // Only one thread at a time may execute this statement.
 lock (_balanceLock)
 _balance += amount;
 }

 public void Withdraw(decimal amount)
 // Only one thread at a time may execute this statement.
 lock (_balanceLock)
 _balance -= amount;
 }


C# introduced in C# 13 on .NET 9.

The code codice_1 can lead to problems if the instance can be accessed publicly.

Similar to Java, C# can also synchronize entire methods, by using the MethodImplOptionsSynchronized attribute.

[MethodImpl(MethodImplOptions.Synchronized)]
public void SomeMethod()
 // do stuff


==Granularity==
Before being introduced to lock granularity, one needs to understand three concepts about locks:
* &quot;lock overhead&quot;: the extra resources for using locks, like the memory space allocated for locks, the CPU time to initialize and destroy locks, and the time for acquiring or releasing locks. The more locks a program uses, the more overhead associated with the usage;
* &quot;lock contention&quot;: this occurs whenever one process or thread attempts to acquire a lock held by another process or thread. The more fine-grained the available locks, the less likely one process/thread will request a lock held by the other. (For example, locking a row rather than the entire table, or locking a cell rather than the entire row);
* &quot;deadlock&quot;: the situation when each of at least two tasks is waiting for a lock that the other task holds. Unless something is done, the two tasks will wait forever.

There is a tradeoff between decreasing lock overhead and decreasing lock contention when choosing the number of locks in synchronization.

An important property of a lock is its &quot;granularity&quot;. The granularity is a measure of the amount of data the lock is protecting. In general, choosing a coarse granularity (a small number of locks, each protecting a large segment of data) results in less &quot;lock overhead&quot; when a single process is accessing the protected data, but worse performance when multiple processes are running concurrently. This is because of increased &quot;lock contention&quot;. The more coarse the lock, the higher the likelihood that the lock will stop an unrelated process from proceeding. Conversely, using a fine granularity (a larger number of locks, each protecting a fairly small amount of data) increases the overhead of the locks themselves but reduces lock contention. Granular locking where each process must hold multiple locks from a common set of locks can create subtle lock dependencies. This subtlety can increase the chance that a programmer will unknowingly introduce a &quot;deadlock&quot;.

In a database management system, for example, a lock could protect, in order of decreasing granularity, part of a field, a field, a record, a data page, or an entire table. Coarse granularity, such as using table locks, tends to give the best performance for a single user, whereas fine granularity, such as record locks, tends to give the best performance for multiple users.

==Database locks==

Database locks can be used as a means of ensuring transaction synchronicity. i.e. when making transaction processing concurrent (interleaving transactions), using 2-phased locks ensures that the concurrent execution of the transaction turns out equivalent to some serial ordering of the transaction. However, deadlocks become an unfortunate side-effect of locking in databases. Deadlocks are either prevented by pre-determining the locking order between transactions or are detected using waits-for graphs. An alternate to locking for database synchronicity while avoiding deadlocks involves the use of totally ordered global timestamps.

There are mechanisms employed to manage the actions of multiple concurrent users on a database—the purpose is to prevent lost updates and dirty reads. The two types of locking are &quot;pessimistic locking&quot; and &quot;optimistic locking&quot;:
* &quot;Pessimistic locking&quot;: a user who reads a record with the intention of updating it places an exclusive lock on the record to prevent other users from manipulating it. This means no one else can manipulate that record until the user releases the lock. The downside is that users can be locked out for a very long time, thereby slowing the overall system response and causing frustration.
:: Where to use pessimistic locking: this is mainly used in environments where data-contention (the degree of users request to the database system at any one time) is heavy; where the cost of protecting data through locks is less than the cost of rolling back transactions, if concurrency conflicts occur. Pessimistic concurrency is best implemented when lock times will be short, as in programmatic processing of records. Pessimistic concurrency requires a persistent connection to the database and is not a scalable option when users are interacting with data, because records might be locked for relatively large periods of time. It is not appropriate for use in Web application development.
* &quot;Optimistic locking&quot;: this allows multiple concurrent users access to the database whilst the system keeps a copy of the initial-read made by each user. When a user wants to update a record, the application determines whether another user has changed the record since it was last read. The application does this by comparing the initial-read held in memory to the database record to verify any changes made to the record. Any discrepancies between the initial-read and the database record violates concurrency rules and hence causes the system to disregard any update request. An error message is generated and the user is asked to start the update process again. It improves database performance by reducing the amount of locking required, thereby reducing the load on the database server. It works efficiently with tables that require limited updates since no users are locked out. However, some updates may fail. The downside is constant update failures due to high volumes of update requests from multiple concurrent users - it can be frustrating for users.
:: Where to use optimistic locking: this is appropriate in environments where there is low contention for data, or where read-only access to data is required. Optimistic concurrency is used extensively in .NET to address the needs of mobile and disconnected applications, where locking data rows for prolonged periods of time would be infeasible. Also, maintaining record locks requires a persistent connection to the database server, which is not possible in disconnected applications.

== Lock compatibility table ==
Several variations and refinements of these major lock types exist, with respective variations of blocking behavior. If a first lock blocks another lock, the two locks are called &quot;incompatible&quot;; otherwise the locks are &quot;compatible&quot;. Often, lock types blocking interactions are presented in the technical literature by a &quot;Lock compatibility table&quot;. The following is an example with the common, major lock types:

*✔ indicates compatibility
*X indicates incompatibility, i.e, a case when a lock of the first type (in left column) on an object blocks a lock of the second type (in top row) from being acquired on the same object (by another transaction). An object typically has a queue of waiting requested (by transactions) operations with respective locks. The first blocked lock for operation in the queue is acquired as soon as the existing blocking lock is removed from the object, and then its respective operation is executed. If a lock for operation in the queue is not blocked by any existing lock (existence of multiple compatible locks on a same object is possible concurrently), it is acquired immediately.
Comment: In some publications, the table entries are simply marked &quot;compatible&quot; or &quot;incompatible&quot;, or respectively &quot;yes&quot; or &quot;no&quot;.

==Disadvantages==
Lock-based resource protection and thread/process synchronization have many disadvantages:
* Contention: some threads/processes have to wait until a lock (or a whole set of locks) is released. If one of the threads holding a lock dies, stalls, blocks, or enters an infinite loop, other threads waiting for the lock may wait indefinitely until the computer is power cycled.
* Overhead: the use of locks adds overhead for each access to a resource, even when the chances for collision are very rare. (However, any chance for such collisions is a race condition.)
* Debugging: bugs associated with locks are time dependent and can be very subtle and extremely hard to replicate, such as deadlocks.
* Instability: the optimal balance between lock overhead and lock contention can be unique to the problem domain (application) and sensitive to design, implementation, and even low-level system architectural changes. These balances may change over the life cycle of an application and may entail tremendous changes to update (re-balance).
* Composability: locks are only composable (e.g., managing multiple concurrent locks in order to atomically delete item X from table A and insert X into table B) with relatively elaborate (overhead) software support and perfect adherence by applications programming to rigorous conventions.
* Priority inversion: a low-priority thread/process holding a common lock can prevent high-priority threads/processes from proceeding. Priority inheritance can be used to reduce priority-inversion duration. The priority ceiling protocol can be used on uniprocessor systems to minimize the worst-case priority-inversion duration, as well as prevent deadlock. 
* Convoying: all other threads have to wait if a thread holding a lock is descheduled due to a time-slice interrupt or page fault.

Some concurrency control strategies avoid some or all of these problems. For example, a funnel or serializing tokens can avoid the biggest problem: deadlocks. Alternatives to locking include non-blocking synchronization methods, like lock-free programming techniques and transactional memory. However, such alternative methods often require that the actual lock mechanisms be implemented at a more fundamental level of the operating software. Therefore, they may only relieve the &quot;application&quot; level from the details of implementing locks, with the problems listed above still needing to be dealt with beneath the application.

In most cases, proper locking depends on the CPU providing a method of atomic instruction stream synchronization (for example, the addition or deletion of an item into a pipeline requires that all contemporaneous operations needing to add or delete other items in the pipe be suspended during the manipulation of the memory content required to add or delete the specific item). Therefore, an application can often be more robust when it recognizes the burdens it places upon an operating system and is capable of graciously recognizing the reporting of impossible demands.

===Lack of composability===
One of lock-based programming&#x27;s biggest problems is that &quot;locks don&#x27;t compose&quot;: it is hard to combine small, correct lock-based modules into equally correct larger programs without modifying the modules or at least knowing about their internals. Simon Peyton Jones (an advocate of software transactional memory) gives the following example of a banking application: design a class that allows multiple concurrent clients to deposit or withdraw money to an account, and give an algorithm to transfer money from one account to another.

The lock-based solution to the first part of the problem is:

 class Account:
 member balance: Integer
 member mutex: Lock
 method deposit(n: Integer)
 mutex.lock()
 balance ← balance + n
 mutex.unlock()
 method withdraw(n: Integer)
 deposit(−n)

The second part of the problem is much more complicated. A routine that is correct &quot;for sequential programs&quot; would be

 function transfer(from: Account, to: Account, amount: Integer)
 from.withdraw(amount)
 to.deposit(amount)

In a concurrent program, this algorithm is incorrect because when one thread is halfway through , another might observe a state where has been withdrawn from the first account, but not yet deposited into the other account: money has gone missing from the system. This problem can only be fixed completely by putting locks on both accounts prior to changing either one, but then the locks have to be placed according to some arbitrary, global ordering to prevent deadlock:

 function transfer(from: Account, to: Account, amount: Integer)
 if from &lt; to &quot;// arbitrary ordering on the locks&quot;
 from.lock()
 to.lock()
 else
 to.lock()
 from.lock()
 from.withdraw(amount)
 to.deposit(amount)
 from.unlock()
 to.unlock()

This solution gets more complicated when more locks are involved, and the function needs to know about all of the locks, so they cannot be hidden.

==Language support==

Programming languages vary in their support for synchronization:
* Ada provides protected objects that have visible protected subprograms or entries as well as rendezvous.
* The ISO/IEC C standard provides a standard mutual exclusion (locks) application programming interface (API) since C11. The current ISO/IEC C++ standard supports threading facilities since C++11. The OpenMP standard is supported by some compilers, and allows critical sections to be specified using pragmas. The POSIX pthread API provides lock support. Visual C++ provides the codice_2 attribute of methods to be synchronized, but this is specific to COM objects in the Windows architecture and Visual C++ compiler. C and C++ can easily access any native operating system locking features.
* C# provides the codice_3 keyword on a thread to ensure its exclusive access to a resource.
* Visual Basic (.NET) provides a codice_4 keyword like C#&#x27;s codice_3 keyword.
* Java provides the keyword codice_6 to lock code blocks, methods or objects and libraries featuring concurrency-safe data structures.
* Objective-C provides the keyword codice_7 to put locks on blocks of code and also provides the classes NSLock, NSRecursiveLock, and NSConditionLock along with the NSLocking protocol for locking as well.
* PHP provides a file-based locking as well as a codice_8 class in the codice_9 extension. 
* Python provides a low-level mutex mechanism with a codice_10 class from the codice_11 module.
* The ISO/IEC Fortran standard (ISO/IEC 1539-1:2010) provides the codice_12 derived type in the intrinsic module codice_13 and the codice_3/codice_15 statements since Fortran 2008.
* Ruby provides a low-level mutex object and no keyword.
* Rust provides the codice_16 struct.
* x86 assembly language provides the codice_17 prefix on certain operations to guarantee their atomicity.
* Haskell implements locking via a mutable data structure called an codice_18, which can either be empty or contain a value, typically a reference to a resource. A thread that wants to use the resource ‘takes’ the value of the codice_18, leaving it empty, and puts it back when it is finished. Attempting to take a resource from an empty codice_18 results in the thread blocking until the resource is available. As an alternative to locking, an implementation of software transactional memory also exists.
*Go provides a low-level Mutex object in standard&#x27;s library sync package. It can be used for locking code blocks, methods or objects.

<text>The Gulf of Ob (), also known as the Bay of Ob (), is a bay of the Arctic Ocean, located in northern Russia at the mouth of the Ob River. It is the world&#x27;s longest estuary.

==Geography==
The mouth of the Gulf of Ob is in the Kara Sea between the Gyda and Yamal peninsulas. It is about long and varies in width from about . It generally runs north and south. The gulf is relatively shallow, with an average depth from , which restricts heavy sea transport. The Taz Estuary is an eastern side-branch formed by the Taz River.

There are several islands near the mouth of the Ob, at the beginning of the estuary, such as Khaley Island. All these islands are close to the shore and they are generally flat and low-lying. They are protected wetlands under Ramsar. Further north, except for a few islands located close to the shore, such as Khalevigo and Nyavigo, the Gulf of Ob is free of islands until it meets the Kara Sea.

Beluga whales seasonally migrate to the Gulf of Ob.

==Fossil fuels==
Very large natural gas and petroleum deposits have been discovered in this region. To the west is the Yamal project to develop resources in the Yamal Peninsula. To the south-east the Yamburg gas field is the world&#x27;s third largest natural gas field, located between the southern portion of the gulf and the Taz Estuary to the east. Oil and gas from the wells are sent south via pipeline and rail transport.

A new port has been developed at Sabetta, on the west bank of the gulf, to support the Yamal LNG plant. Commercial operation started in December 2017 with the loading of the first LNG carrier.

Gazprom&#x27;s Arctic Gate offshore oil loading terminal is in the gulf, designed to operate where ice could be over two meters thick.

The fossil gas company PAO Novatek has since 2019 had permission for natural gas extraction from a major part of the eastern shore Gyda Peninsula. In 2020 the company presented plans for construction of a major port for gas shipment. The port is called Utrenneye and the project is named Arctic LNG 2.

In the &quot;Wide Screen&quot; version, the player controls Mickey Mouse whose task is to catch eggs as they roll down four slopes, two on either side of the screen. If an egg is dropped, it lands on the floor and is registered as a miss. The eggs roll faster as the total caught count increases, but temporarily slow down upon reaching multiples of 100. The misses are reset at 200 and 500 caught eggs. Missing three eggs between resets will end the game. Periodically, Minnie Mouse peers out of the window; if Mickey misses an egg while Minnie is present onscreen, the miss counts as half and the egg releases a chick who walks away off screen. This half-miss is displayed as a blinking miss symbol. In Game A eggs roll from three of four slopes, the inactive slope depends on the current miss count. In Game B eggs roll from all four slopes, the number and rate of descent of eggs is higher than in Game A. The gameplay is similar to &quot;Egg&quot; which was only released outside of Japan, while Mickey Mouse was released in Japan and a few european countries.

The &quot;Panorama&quot; version is completely different, where the player controls Mickey Mouse, who is performing acrobatics in a circus. The player must move Mickey left and right to catch batons, whilst avoiding flaming torches. The speed the objects fall increases upon the total score closing in on multiples of 100. If the player misses a baton or touches a flaming torch, a life is lost. After three lives are lost, the game ends. Once the player reaches 300 points, all misses are cancelled. If the player has no misses, they will receive double points until the next miss. The gameplay is similar to &quot;Donkey Kong Circus&quot;.

===&quot;Egg&quot;===

Egg was released in the &quot;Wide Screen&quot; series on October 14, 1981. It is a single-screen single-player game.

The player character is a wolf who waits outside a hen house. The wolf must catch the eggs that fall out of the side of the hen house, for one point each. Three lives are given. A life is lost for each egg missed, or half of a life if the egg is missed while a hen appears. The game ends when all three lives are lost. The gameplay is the same as &quot;Mickey Mouse&quot; in the &quot;Wide Screen&quot; series.

&quot;Egg&quot; was recreated in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 3&quot; for Game Boy Color.

===&quot;Turtle Bridge&quot;===

Turtle Bridge was released in the &quot;Wide Screen&quot; series on February 1, 1982. It is a single-screen single-player game.

The player uses a line of five turtles as stepping stones to transfer baggage from one side of a river to the other. Once a package is tossed to a colleague on the other side, the player can return to the home bank to fetch the next package. The turtles are not motionless but will dive to feed on any fish within reach, and they dive more frequently as the game progresses. The player may need to wait for the colleague on the far bank and cannot return to the home bank while carrying a package. Two to twelve points are awarded, depending on how quickly the package is delivered. It takes approximately 1 hour of game play to accrue 1000 points. Unlike other similar games, the scoreboard can display scores past 1000. Lives are lost if the explorer lands on a turtle that dives. A life can be recovered at the score levels 200 and 500. The game ends when all lives are lost.

In Game A, the middle turtle of the five has no fish swimming in reach and never dives unless the explorer waits too long on its back, at which point fish appear and the turtle dives. In Game B, all turtles will dive from the outset, and the colleague appears less frequently.

In both Game A and Game B if the player reaches 200 and 500 points without any lives lost, there will be a period of 20 and 30 seconds respectively when no new fish appear under the turtles. The same goes for 1200, 1500, 2200 points etc. 

&quot;Turtle Bridge&quot; was recreated in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 3&quot; for Game Boy Color.

Two points are earned for each fire blocked. Three misses are allowed, which occur each time the fort catches fire. All misses are erased at 200 points and again at 500; if there are not any misses at these times, 5 points are awarded per hit for a period of time.

&quot;Fire Attack&quot; was recreated in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot; for Game Boy Advance, although, the Game Boy Advance version of the &quot;Legacy Mode&quot; was censored, due to &quot;outdated stereotypes&quot;, being turned into generic &quot;Bandits&quot;.

Mario and Luigi are working in a bottling plant, on either side of several stacked conveyor belts. The object of the game is to move boxes of bottles through the machine without dropping any. Each brother can climb a ladder to one of three positions. Mario receives a box at the bottom right, and must be in his lowest position to move it into the bottling machine. The box moves left through the machine, to Luigi, who must be in his lowest position to move it to the next level, which moves it to the right, to Mario&#x27;s middle position, who raises it to the next level. The box moves to Luigi&#x27;s middle position, then to Mario&#x27;s highest position, and finally to Luigi&#x27;s highest position, where Luigi throws the box onto a truck. When the truck is full, the Brothers have a short break, before getting back to work. Successfully moving a box up one level earns the player 1 point, and loading the truck with eight boxes earns 10 points, for a total of 58 points for all the boxes in the truck. If a Brother is not there to catch a box, however, it falls to the floor and breaks, angering the Brothers&#x27; supervisor, resulting in a miss. The third miss ends the game.

&quot;Mario Bros.&quot; was recreated in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 3&quot; for Game Boy Color, and &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 4&quot; for Game Boy Advance.

In the &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series until &quot;Ultimate&quot;, Mr. Game &amp; Watch&#x27;s forward air has him hit opponents with a package, referencing &quot;Mario Bros.&quot; One of his taunts from &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS&quot; and &quot;Wii U&quot; onward also references the game where he sits and sighs, referencing Mario and Luigi completing a level.

If all blocks are eliminated fast enough, a bonus bar at the top would add 5 points per segment, the most being 20 points. Along the top row are red blocks, which require two hits to destroy. If the player eliminates all but the red blocks, and then hits each red block once to make them flash, it awards more bonus points.

&quot;Spitball Sparky&quot; was recreated in &quot;Game &amp; Watch Gallery 3&quot; for Game Boy Color.

===&quot;Tetris Jr.&quot;===
Tetris Jr. is a prototype in the &quot;Multi Screen&quot; series that was never released to the public. There is only one known copy in existence, making it the rarest of all Game &amp; Watches. Like regular &quot;Tetris&quot;, the object of the &quot;Tetris Jr.&quot; is to score as many points as possible by forming complete rows from falling blocks of various shapes, but instead of positioning the falling block by moving it left or right, the players move the entire playing field instead. There are two game modes available.

In game A, a clown on the top screen throws randomly selected blocks of various shapes down a chute toward the bottom screen. The Rotate Button turns blocks 90° as they falls. The down direction the D-pad increase the speed of the falling block. The left and right directions on the D-pad moves the entire playing field.

When a row is completely filled, it is removed and points are awarded based on how many rows are cleared in one turn: 1 row - 7 points, 2 rows - 25 points, 3 rows - 100 points, and 4 rows - 400 points.

If the playing field fills up with enough blocks so that a falling block can not move beyond the narrow chute, the playing field can then no longer be moved left or right and the chute will fill with blocks until it reaches the top when a miss is scored. When three misses are scored, the game is over.

In Game B, the players have 3 rounds of 60 seconds each to try and score as many points as possible by forming complete rows. Every time they clear a row, points are awarded (similar to Game A) and in addition, a few more seconds are added back on the clock extending the time they have in the round. When the timer reaches 0, however, a miss is scored. The game ends after the third miss.

<text>The Ancient Tombs at Longtou Mountain are the burial sites of twelve royal figures from the Balhae (Bohai) kingdom. It is located on Longtou Mountain, southeast of Toudao Town () in Helong, Jilin Province, China, a region possibly called the &quot;Western Field of the Ran Valley&quot; () by the Balhae people. The mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo is located here.

==History==
Construction on the first tombs at Longtou Mountain began sometime after 745, when King Mun moved the Balhae capital city to Junggyeong. The cemetery was in use until the end of the Balhae Kingdom.

The discovery of Princess Jeonghyo&#x27;s tombstone resolved speculation amongst scholars that the area was the former location of Hyundeok Province (顯德府) of the Balhae Kingdom.

The site has been a Major Historical and Cultural Site Protected at the National Level since January 13, 1988. The walls and the murals of the tomb have been covered with anti-corrosive chemicals; at one point the tomb included at least one tower, but it is no longer standing.

== Excavation == 
The first excavations at Longtou Mountain were conducted in 1980 by the Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture Museum of Jilin (). They excavated the Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo in the Dragon Sea section. At the same time, members of the museum, in addition to other organisations, conducted a survey of a 7.5 km2 area. Local archaeologists were also invited to conduct test excavations on some of the other tombs, which produced various precious artefacts.

In 1982, the Yanbian Museum excavated seven tombs in the Dragon Sea area. All seven were clustered quite close together, but the tomb roofs had already collapsed. Some tombs cut through older tombs. Two of these tombs contained two people, who had been interred at the same time; four tombs contained two people, who had been interred one after the other; one tomb contained four people, one of whom was first interred, followed by the other three on a separate occasion. In the cases of a secondary burial, the second person was placed on top of the first body&#x27;s head or feet.

==Layout==
There are three burial zones:
* Dragon Lake ()
* Dragon Sea ()
** The location of Princess Jeonghyo&#x27;s mausoleum
** One robbed-out tumulus to the south-east. The inner north, east, and west walls were plastered, but the tomb had collapsed by 2012.
** 10 burials distributed over terraces to the east of Princess Jeonghyo&#x27;s burial
* Stone Kingdom ()

==Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo==
The Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo (Chinese: Zhēnxiào Gōngzhǔ mù 贞孝公主墓, ) was made in 793 by the people of the early Balhae kingdom. The mausoleum contains, among other things, the first complete discovered and detailed murals done by Balhae artists, and hence provides valuable insights to historians.

The mausoleum originally had a funerary pagoda made from brick and stone slabs, in addition to a tumulus. Only the pagoda&#x27;s foundations remain, which show that it was originally square, measuring 5.50x5.65 m. Below the funerary pagoda and tumulus, the princess&#x27; burial comprised an entry passage, tomb entrance, internal passage, and burial chamber. The burial chamber is underground, and was excavated in October 1980. The burial chamber measured 2.10x3.10 m and was built from bricks, with stone slabs forming the roof. The mounds of earth lined with stones demonstrate the continuance of Goguryeo-style tomb but the formal clothing shows Tang style, which implies that Balhae actively accepted the Tang culture. There were originally 12 murals depicting people on the rear walls of the internal passage and north, east, and west walls of the burial chamber. The chamber is surrounded by four murals on each wall, depicting thirteen people in action, such as warriors (3), chamber attendants, musicians, and maids, wearing red, blue, yellow, purple, and brown robes. The murals displayed the image of the Balhae people in its completeness for the first time.

The burial chamber contains a 1.05-metre tall, 0.58-metre width × 0.26-m depth &quot;mugui&quot;-shaped () complete and unbroken granite epitaph, on which 728 Chinese characters, in the Regular Script style, are inscribed in 18 horizontal lines. The epitaph is of a typical combined written form, which contained both the chronological writings of the Princess&#x27; whole life and the remembrance writings which displayed the praise and remembrance for the Princess. The Balhae scholar author of this epitaph was highly learned in the traditional Chinese literature, as reflected in the use of poetic lines modeled upon poets of the early Tang dynasty.

===Interments===
The epitaph explains that Princess Jeonghyo (貞孝公主) is the fourth daughter of King Mun, the third ruler of Balhae and a younger sister of Princess Jeonghye (貞惠公主). The epitaph shows that Balhae considered its ruler as an emperor equivalent to that of the Tang dynasty.

The epitaph also recorded that the Princess died on Monday, 6 July 792, during the fifty-sixth year of the Daeheung era. She was accompanied in the burial at Ran Valley () in Xi Yuan (西原 or Western Plains) in the winter of 809 () (western Gregorian solar calendar Monday, 11 January 810, Chinese lunar calendar 28th day of the 11th month). She was given the posthumous name &quot;Jeonghyo&quot; to qualify her as virtuous and filial. She was likely a horse-rider, as the remains of a horse were found in the chamber. The epitaph recorded the year of death as 792. This corrected previous works such as Jin Yufu&#x27;s () &quot;Book of the Balhae Kingdom&quot; (), which recorded 793 instead.

The skeletal remains were scattered all over the chamber when discovered by archaeologists, due to previous looting. However, the looters missed several golden and copper items, jewelry, pottery, and figurines. The gold ornament depicting a three stranded bird&#x27;s wing is a piece of evidence demonstrating how Balhae was inherited of Goguryeo&#x27;s crowns. Reconstruction showed that the bones belong to a woman, presumably the princess; but there is also a male, possibly an attendant or child. But family ancestry records do state that the princess married and had a daughter who was born in 782 but died in 787.

<doc id="244600" wikidata="Q200085" url="?curid=244600" title="Pietro Badoglio">
<text>Pietro Badoglio, 1st [[Duke of Addis Abeba]], 1st Marquess of Sabotino ( , ; 28 September 1871 – 1 November 1956), was an Italian general during both World Wars and the first viceroy of Italian East Africa. With the fall of the Fascist regime in Italy, he became Prime Minister of Italy.

== Early life and career ==

Badoglio was born in 1871. His father, Mario Badoglio, was a modest landowner, and his mother, Antonietta Pittarelli, was of middle-class background. On 5 October 1888 he was admitted to the Royal Military Academy in Turin. He received the rank of second lieutenant in 1890. In 1892, he finished his studies and was promoted to first lieutenant.

After completing his studies, he served with the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot; (Italian Royal Army) from 1892, at first as a lieutenant (&quot;tenente&quot;) in artillery. Badoglio was involved in the First Italo-Ethiopian War and the Italo-Turkish War.

== First World War ==
At the beginning of Italian participation in the First World War, he was a lieutenant colonel (&quot;tenente colonnello&quot;); he rose to the rank of major general following his handling of the capture of Monte Sabotino in May 1916 and by the late months of 1917, by now already a lieutenant general, was named as vice-chief of staff (&quot;sottocapo di stato maggiore&quot;) despite being one of those mainly responsible for the disaster during the Battle of Caporetto on 24 October 1917. 

With regard to the Battle of Caporetto, although he was blamed in various quarters for his disposition of the forces under his command before the battle, a commission of inquiry rejected most of the criticisms made upon him. In the years after the First World War, in which he held several high posts in the &quot;Regio Esercito&quot;, Badoglio exerted a constant effort in modifying official documents in order to hide his role in the defeat.

== Genocide in Libya ==

After the war, Badoglio was named as a senator, but also remained in the army with special assignments to Romania and the U.S. in 1920 and 1921. At first, he opposed Benito Mussolini and after 1922 was side-lined by being sent to Brazil as ambassador. A political change of heart soon returned him to Italy and a senior role in the army, as chief of staff from 4 May 1925. On 25 June 1926, Badoglio was promoted to the rank of Marshal of Italy (&quot;Maresciallo d&#x27;Italia&quot;).

Badoglio was the first sole governor of Tripolitania and Cyrenaica (later amalgamated as Italian Libya) from 1929 to 1933. During his governorship, he played a vital part (with Rodolfo Graziani, deputy governor of Cyrenaica) in defeating the Libyan Resistance by waging a near-genocidal campaign. On 20 June 1930, Badoglio wrote to Graziani: &quot;As for overall strategy, it is necessary to create a significant and clear separation between the controlled population and the rebel formations. I do not hide the significance and seriousness of this measure, which might be the ruin of the subdued population ... But now the course has been set, and we must carry it out to the end, even if the entire population of Cyrenaica must perish.&quot; By 1931, well over half of the population of Cyrenaica were confined to 15 concentration camps where many died as a result of overcrowding (and lack of water, food and medicine) while Badoglio&#x27;s air force used chemical weapons against the Bedouin rebels in the desert. On 24 January 1932 (the third anniversary of his appointment), Badoglio proclaimed the end of Libyan resistance for the first time since the Italian invasion in 1911.

== Italian invasion of Ethiopia ==
On 3 October 1935, because the progress of De Bono&#x27;s invasion of Abyssinia was judged by Mussolini to be too slow, Badoglio, who had in the meantime launched an epistolary campaign against Emilio de Bono, replaced de Bono as the commander. Badoglio asked for and was given permission to use chemical weapons, using the torture and murder of downed Italian pilot Tito Minniti during the Ethiopian &quot;Christmas Offensive&quot; as a pretext for doing so. British historian Sir Ian Kershaw wrote the &quot;barbarous initiatives in the conduct of the war &quot;in Ethiopia&quot;&quot; came as a rule from the military elite rather than from Mussolini himself.

Badoglio employed mustard gas to effectively destroy the Ethiopian armies confronting him on the northern front. He commanded the Italian forces at the First Battle of Tembien, the Battle of Amba Aradam, the Second Battle of Tembien, and the Battle of Shire. On 31 March 1936, Badoglio defeated Emperor Haile Selassie commanding the last Ethiopian army on the northern front at the Battle of Maychew. On 26 April, with no Ethiopian resistance left between his forces and Addis Ababa, Badoglio launched his &quot;March of the Iron Will&quot; to take the Ethiopian capital city and end the war. By 2 May, Haile Selassie had fled the country.

On 5 May 1936, Marshal Badoglio led the victorious Italian troops into Addis Ababa. Mussolini declared King Victor Emmanuel to be the Emperor of Ethiopia, and Ethiopia became part of the Italian Empire. On this occasion, Badoglio was appointed the first viceroy and governor general of Ethiopia and ennobled with the victory title of &quot;Duke of Addis Abeba&quot; ad personam.

On 11 June 1936, Rodolfo Graziani replaced Badoglio as viceroy and governor-general of Ethiopia. Badoglio returned to his duties as supreme chief of the Italian general staff. According to &quot;Time&quot; magazine, Badoglio even joined the Fascist Party in early June.

== World War II ==

Badoglio was chief of staff from 1925 to 1940, and had the final say on the entire structure of the Armed Forces, including doctrine, selection of officers, and armaments, influencing the whole military environment. He did not oppose the decision of Mussolini and the King to declare war on France and Great Britain. Following the Italian army&#x27;s poor performance in the invasion of Greece in December 1940, he resigned from the General Staff. He was replaced by Ugo Cavallero.

By early 1943, there was a widely-held belief among the military elite that Italy needed to sign an armistice in order to exit the war. Mussolini needed to be removed, as he was not willing to sign an armistice, nor were the Allies willing to sign an armistice with him. The two men considered to replace Mussolini were Marshal Badoglio and Marshal Enrico Caviglia. As Marshal Caviglia was one of the few Royal Army officers who was known to dislike Fascism, the king was unwilling to have him as prime minister. Victor Emmanuel wanted an officer who was committed to continuing the Fascist system, which led him to choose Badoglio who had faithfully served Mussolini and committed an array of atrocities in Ethiopia, but who had a grudge against Mussolini for making him the scapegoat for the failed invasion of Greece in 1940. Moreover, Badoglio was an opportunist well known for his sycophancy towards those in power, which led the king to choose him as Mussolini&#x27;s successor as he knew that Badoglio would do anything to have power whereas Caviglia had a reputation as a man of principle and honour. On 15 July 1943, in a secret meeting Victor Emmanuel told Badoglio that he would soon be sworn in as Italy&#x27;s new prime minister and the king wanted no &quot;ghosts&quot; (i.e. liberal politicians from the pre-fascist era) in his cabinet.

On 24 July 1943, as Italy had suffered several setbacks following the Allied invasion of Sicily in World War II, Mussolini summoned the Fascist Grand Council, which voted no confidence in Mussolini. The following day, Mussolini was removed from government by King Victor Emmanuel III and arrested. On 3 September 1943, General Giuseppe Castellano signed the Italian armistice with the Allies in Cassibile on behalf of Badoglio, who was named Prime Minister of Italy. Wary of the potentially hostile German response to the Armistice, Badoglio hesitated to formally announce the treaty.

On 8 September 1943, the armistice document was published by the Allies in the Badoglio Proclamation, and Badoglio had not informed the Italian armed forces. The units of the Italian Royal Army, Royal Navy, and Royal Air Force were generally surprised by the change and unprepared for German actions to disarm them. In the early hours of the following day, 9 September 1943, Badoglio, King Victor Emmanuel, some military ministers, and the chief of the general staff escaped to Pescara and Brindisi seeking Allied protection.

On 29 September 1943, the longer version of the armistice was signed in Malta by both Badoglio and Eisenhower. On 13 October, Badoglio and the Kingdom of Italy officially declared war on Nazi Germany. Badoglio continued to head the government for another nine months.

== Final years ==
Due to increased tensions with the Soviet Union, the British government saw Badoglio as a guarantor of an anti-communist post-war Italy. Consequently, Badoglio was never tried for Italian war crimes committed in Africa.

Badoglio died in the &quot;comune&quot; of his birth, Grazzano Badoglio, on 1 November 1956.

<doc id="244601" wikidata="Q1366475" url="?curid=244601" title="Effects of nuclear explosions">
<text>The effects of a nuclear explosion on its immediate vicinity are typically much more destructive and multifaceted than those caused by conventional explosives. In most cases, the energy released from a nuclear weapon detonated within the lower atmosphere can be approximately divided into four basic categories:
*the blast and shock wave: 50% of total energy
*thermal radiation: 35% of total energy
*ionizing radiation: 5% of total energy (more in a neutron bomb)
*residual radiation: 5–10% of total energy with the mass of the explosion.

Depending on the design of the weapon and the location in which it is detonated, the energy distributed to any one of these categories may be significantly higher or lower. The physical blast effect is created by the coupling of immense amounts of energy, spanning the electromagnetic spectrum, with the surroundings. The environment of the explosion (e.g. submarine, ground burst, air burst, or exo-atmospheric) determines how much energy is distributed to the blast and how much to radiation. In general, surrounding a bomb with denser media, such as water, absorbs more energy and creates more powerful shock waves while at the same time limiting the area of its effect. When a nuclear weapon is surrounded only by air, lethal blast and thermal effects proportionally scale much more rapidly than lethal radiation effects as explosive yield increases. This bubble is faster than the speed of sound. The physical damage mechanisms of a nuclear weapon (blast and thermal radiation) are identical to those of conventional explosives, but the energy produced by a nuclear explosion is usually millions of times more powerful per unit mass, and temperatures may briefly reach the tens of millions of degrees.

Energy from a nuclear explosion is initially released in several forms of penetrating radiation. When there is surrounding material such as air, rock, or water, this radiation interacts with and rapidly heats the material to an equilibrium temperature (i.e. so that the matter is at the same temperature as the fuel powering the explosion). This causes vaporization of the surrounding material, resulting in its rapid expansion. Kinetic energy created by this expansion contributes to the formation of a shock wave which expands spherically from the center. Intense thermal radiation at the hypocenter forms a nuclear fireball which, if the explosion is low enough in altitude, is often associated with a mushroom cloud. In a high-altitude burst where the density of the atmosphere is low, more energy is released as ionizing gamma radiation and X-rays than as an atmosphere-displacing shockwave.

== Direct effects ==

=== Blast damage ===

The high temperatures and radiation cause gas to move outward radially in a thin, dense shell called &quot;the hydrodynamic front&quot;. The front acts like a piston that pushes against and compresses the surrounding medium to make a spherically expanding shock wave. At first, this shock wave is inside the surface of the developing fireball, which is created in a volume of air heated by the explosion&#x27;s &quot;soft&quot; X-rays. Within a fraction of a second, the dense shock front obscures the fireball and continues to move past it, expanding outwards and free from the fireball, causing a reduction of light emanating from a nuclear detonation. Eventually the shock wave dissipates to the point where the light becomes visible again giving rise to the characteristic double flash caused by the shock wave–fireball interaction. It is this unique feature of nuclear explosions that is exploited when verifying that an atmospheric nuclear explosion has occurred and not simply a large conventional explosion, with radiometer instruments known as Bhangmeters capable of determining the nature of explosions.

For air bursts at or near sea level, 50–60% of the explosion&#x27;s energy goes into the blast wave, depending on the size and the yield of the bomb. As a general rule, the blast fraction is higher for low yield weapons. Furthermore, it decreases at high altitudes because there is less air mass to absorb radiation energy and convert it into a blast. This effect is most important for altitudes above 30  km, corresponding to less than 1 percent of sea-level air density.

The effects of a moderate rain storm during an Operation Castle nuclear explosion were found to dampen, or reduce, peak pressure levels by approximately 15% at all ranges.

Much of the destruction caused by a nuclear explosion is from blast effects. Most buildings, except reinforced or blast-resistant structures, will suffer moderate damage when subjected to overpressures of only 35.5 kilopascals (kPa) (5.15 pounds-force per square inch or 0.35 atm). Data obtained from Japanese surveys following the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki found that was sufficient to destroy all wooden and brick residential structures. This can reasonably be defined as the pressure capable of producing severe damage.

The blast wind at sea level may exceed 1,000 km/h, or ~300 m/s, approaching the speed of sound in air. The range for blast effects increases with the explosive yield of the weapon and also depends on the burst altitude. Contrary to what might be expected from geometry, the blast range is not maximal for surface or low altitude blasts but increases with altitude up to an &quot;optimum burst altitude&quot; and then decreases rapidly for higher altitudes. This is caused by the nonlinear behavior of shock waves. When the blast wave from an air burst reaches the ground it is reflected. Below a certain reflection angle, the reflected wave and the direct wave merge and form a reinforced horizontal wave, known as the &#x27;&quot;Mach stem&quot; and is a form of constructive interference. This phenomenon is responsible for the bumps or &#x27;knees&#x27; in the above overpressure range graph.

For each goal overpressure, there is a certain optimum burst height at which the blast range is maximized over ground targets. In a typical air burst, where the blast range is maximized to produce the greatest range of severe damage, i.e. the greatest range that ~ of pressure is extended over, is a GR/ground range of 0.4 km for 1 kiloton (kt) of TNT yield; 1.9 km for 100 kt; and 8.6 km for 10 megatons (Mt) of TNT. The optimum height of burst to maximize this desired severe ground range destruction for a 1 kt bomb is 0.22  km; for 100 kt, 1  km; and for 10 Mt, 4.7  km.

Two distinct, simultaneous phenomena are associated with the blast wave in the air:

* Static overpressure, i.e., the sharp increase in pressure exerted by the shock wave. The overpressure at any given point is directly proportional to the density of the air in the wave.
* Dynamic pressures, i.e., drag exerted by the blast winds required to form the blast wave. These winds push, tumble and tear objects.

Most of the material damage caused by a nuclear air burst is caused by a combination of the high static overpressures and the blast winds. The long compression of the blast wave weakens structures, which are then torn apart by the blast winds. The compression, vacuum and drag phases together may last several seconds or longer, and exert forces many times greater than the strongest hurricane.

Acting on the human body, the shock waves cause pressure waves through the tissues. These waves mostly damage junctions between tissues of different densities (bone and muscle) or the interface between tissue and air. Lungs and the abdominal cavity, which contain air, are particularly injured. The damage causes severe hemorrhaging or air embolisms, either of which can be rapidly fatal. The overpressure estimated to damage lungs is about 70 kPa. Some eardrums would probably rupture around 22 kPa (0.2 atm) and half would rupture between 90 and 130 kPa (0.9 to 1.2 atm).

=== Thermal radiation ===

Nuclear weapons emit large amounts of thermal radiation as visible, infrared, and ultraviolet light, to which the atmosphere is largely transparent. This is known as &quot;flash&quot;. The chief hazards are burns and eye injuries. On clear days, these injuries can occur well beyond blast ranges, depending on weapon yield. Fires may also be started by the initial thermal radiation, but the following high winds due to the blast wave may put out almost all such fires, unless the yield is very high where the range of thermal effects vastly outranges blast effects, as observed from explosions in the multi-megaton range. This is because the intensity of the blast effects drops off with the third power of distance from the explosion, while the intensity of radiation effects drops off with the second power of distance. This results in the range of thermal effects increasing markedly more than blast range as higher and higher device yields are detonated.

Thermal radiation accounts for between 35 and 45% of the energy released in the explosion, depending on the yield of the device. In urban areas, the extinguishing of fires ignited by thermal radiation may matter little, as in a surprise attack fires may also be started by blast-effect-induced electrical shorts, gas pilot lights, overturned stoves, and other ignition sources, as was the case in the breakfast-time bombing of Hiroshima. Whether or not these secondary fires will in turn be snuffed out as modern noncombustible brick and concrete buildings collapse in on themselves from the same blast wave is uncertain, not least of which, because of the masking effect of modern city landscapes on thermal and blast transmission are continually examined. When combustible frame buildings were blown down in Hiroshima and Nagasaki, they did not burn as rapidly as they would have done had they remained standing. The noncombustible debris produced by the blast frequently covered and prevented the burning of combustible material.
Fire experts suggest that unlike Hiroshima, due to the nature of modern U.S. city design and construction, a firestorm in modern times is unlikely after a nuclear detonation. This does not exclude fires from being started but means that these fires will not form into a firestorm, due largely to the differences between modern building materials and those used in World War II-era Hiroshima.

There are two types of eye injuries from thermal radiation: flash blindness and retinal burn. Flash blindness is caused by the initial brilliant flash of light produced by the nuclear detonation. More light energy is received on the retina than can be tolerated but less than is required for irreversible injury. The retina is particularly susceptible to visible and short wavelength infrared light since this part of the electromagnetic spectrum is focused by the lens on the retina. The result is bleaching of the visual pigments and temporary blindness for up to 40 minutes. A retinal burn resulting in permanent damage from scarring is also caused by the concentration of direct thermal energy on the retina by the lens. It will occur only when the fireball is actually in the individual&#x27;s field of vision and would be a relatively uncommon injury. Retinal burns may be sustained at considerable distances from the explosion. The height of burst and apparent size of the fireball, a function of yield and range will determine the degree and extent of retinal scarring. A scar in the central visual field would be more debilitating. Generally, a limited visual field defect, which will be barely noticeable, is all that is likely to occur.

When thermal radiation strikes an object, part will be reflected, part transmitted, and the rest absorbed. The fraction that is absorbed depends on the nature and color of the material. A thin material may transmit most of the radiation. A light-colored object may reflect much of the incident radiation and thus escape damage, like anti-flash white paint. The absorbed thermal radiation raises the temperature of the surface and results in scorching, charring, and burning of wood, paper, fabrics, etc. If the material is a poor thermal conductor, the heat is confined to the surface of the material.

The actual ignition of materials depends on how long the thermal pulse lasts and the thickness and moisture content of the target. Near ground zero where the energy flux exceeds 125 J/cm2, what can burn, will. Farther away, only the most easily ignited materials will flame. Incendiary effects are compounded by secondary fires started by the blast wave effects such as from upset stoves and furnaces.

In Hiroshima on 6 August 1945, a tremendous firestorm developed within 20 minutes after detonation and destroyed many more buildings and homes, built out of predominantly &#x27;flimsy&#x27; wooden materials. A firestorm has gale-force winds blowing in towards the center of the fire from all directions. It is not peculiar to nuclear explosions, having been observed frequently in large forest fires and following incendiary raids during World War II. Despite fires destroying a large area of Nagasaki, no true firestorm occurred in the city even though a higher yielding weapon was used. Many factors explain this seeming contradiction, including a different time of bombing than Hiroshima, terrain, and crucially, a lower fuel loading/fuel density than that of Hiroshima.
As thermal radiation travels more or less in a straight line from the fireball (unless scattered), any opaque object will produce a protective shadow that provides protection from the flash burn. Depending on the properties of the underlying surface material, the exposed area outside the protective shadow will be either burnt to a darker color, such as charring wood, or a brighter color, such as asphalt. If such a weather phenomenon as fog or haze is present at the point of the nuclear explosion, it scatters the flash, with radiant energy then reaching burn-sensitive substances from all directions. Under these conditions, opaque objects are therefore less effective than they would otherwise be without scattering, as they demonstrate maximum shadowing effect in an environment of perfect visibility and therefore zero scatterings. Similar to a foggy or overcast day, although there are few if any, shadows produced by the sun on such a day, the solar energy that reaches the ground from the sun&#x27;s infrared rays is nevertheless considerably diminished, due to it being absorbed by the water of the clouds and the energy also being scattered back into space. Analogously, so too is the intensity at a range of burning flash energy attenuated, in units of J/cm2, along with the slant/horizontal range of a nuclear explosion, during fog or haze conditions. So despite any object that casts a shadow being rendered ineffective as a shield from the flash by fog or haze, due to scattering, the fog fills the same protective role, but generally only at the ranges that survival in the open is just a matter of being protected from the explosion&#x27;s flash energy.

The thermal pulse also is responsible for warming the atmospheric nitrogen close to the bomb and causing the creation of atmospheric NOx smog components. This, as part of the mushroom cloud, is shot into the stratosphere where it is responsible for dissociating ozone there, in the same way combustion NOx compounds do. The amount created depends on the yield of the explosion and the blast&#x27;s environment. Studies done on the total effect of nuclear blasts on the ozone layer have been at least tentatively exonerating after initial discouraging findings.
== Indirect effects ==

=== Electromagnetic pulse ===
Gamma rays from a nuclear explosion produce high energy electrons through Compton scattering. For high altitude nuclear explosions, these electrons are captured in the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field at altitudes between 20 and 40 kilometers where they interact with the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field to produce a coherent nuclear electromagnetic pulse (NEMP) which lasts about one millisecond. Secondary effects may last for more than a second. The pulse is powerful enough to cause moderately long metal objects (such as cables) to act as antennas and generate high voltages due to interactions with the electromagnetic pulse. These voltages can destroy unshielded electronics. There are no known biological effects of EMP. The ionized air also disrupts radio traffic that would normally bounce off the ionosphere.

Electronics can be shielded by wrapping them completely in conductive material such as metal foil; the effectiveness of the shielding may be less than perfect. Proper shielding is a complex subject due to the large number of variables involved. Semiconductors, especially integrated circuits, are extremely susceptible to the effects of EMP due to the close proximity of their p–n junctions, but this is not the case with thermionic tubes (or valves) which are relatively immune to EMP. A Faraday cage does not offer protection from the effects of EMP unless the mesh is designed to have holes no bigger than the smallest wavelength emitted from a nuclear explosion.

Large nuclear weapons detonated at high altitudes also cause geomagnetically induced current in very long electrical conductors. The mechanism by which these geomagnetically induced currents are generated is entirely different from the gamma-ray induced pulse produced by Compton electrons.

=== Radar blackout===

The heat of the explosion causes air in the vicinity to become ionized, creating the fireball. The free electrons in the fireball affect radio waves, especially at lower frequencies. This causes a large area of the sky to become opaque to radar, especially those operating in the VHF and UHF frequencies, which is common for long-range early warning radars. The effect is less for higher frequencies in the microwave region, as well as lasting a shorter time – the effect falls off both in strength and the affected frequencies as the fireball cools and the electrons begin to re-form onto free nuclei.

A second blackout effect is caused by the emission of beta particles from the fission products. These can travel long distances, following the Earth&#x27;s magnetic field lines. When they reach the upper atmosphere they cause ionization similar to the fireball but over a wider area. Calculations demonstrate that one megaton of fission, typical of a two-megaton H-bomb, will create enough beta radiation to blackout an area across for five minutes. Careful selection of the burst altitudes and locations can produce an extremely effective radar-blanking effect. The physical effects giving rise to blackouts also cause EMP, which can also cause power blackouts. The two effects are otherwise unrelated, and the similar naming can be confusing.

=== Ionizing radiation ===
About 5% of the energy released in a nuclear air burst is in the form of ionizing radiation: neutrons, gamma rays, alpha particles and electrons moving at speeds up to the speed of light. Gamma rays are high-energy electromagnetic radiation; the others are particles that move slower than light. The neutrons result almost exclusively from the fission and fusion reactions, while the initial gamma radiation includes that arising from these reactions as well as that resulting from the decay of short-lived fission products. The intensity of initial nuclear radiation decreases rapidly with distance from the point of burst because the radiation spreads over a larger area as it travels away from the explosion (the inverse-square law). It is also reduced by atmospheric absorption and scattering.

The character of the radiation received at a given location also varies with the distance from the explosion. Near the point of the explosion, the neutron intensity is greater than the gamma intensity, but with increasing distance the neutron-gamma ratio decreases. Ultimately, the neutron component of the initial radiation becomes negligible in comparison with the gamma component. The range for significant levels of initial radiation does not increase markedly with weapon yield and, as a result, the initial radiation becomes less of a hazard with increasing yield. With larger weapons, above 50 kt (200 TJ), blast and thermal effects are so much greater in importance that prompt radiation effects can be ignored.

The neutron radiation serves to transmute the surrounding matter, often rendering it radioactive. When added to the dust of radioactive material released by the bomb, a large amount of radioactive material is released into the environment. This form of radioactive contamination is known as nuclear fallout and poses the primary risk of exposure to ionizing radiation for a large nuclear weapon.

Details of nuclear weapon design also affect neutron emission: the gun-type assembly Little Boy leaked far more neutrons than the implosion-type 21 kt Fat Man because the light hydrogen nuclei (protons) predominating in the exploded TNT molecules (surrounding the core of Fat Man) slowed down neutrons very efficiently while the heavier iron atoms in the steel nose forging of Little Boy scattered neutrons without absorbing much neutron energy.

It was found in early experimentation that normally most of the neutrons released in the cascading chain reaction of the fission bomb are absorbed by the bomb case. Building a bomb case of materials which transmitted rather than absorbed the neutrons could make the bomb more intensely lethal to humans from prompt neutron radiation. This is one of the features used in the development of the neutron bomb.

=== Earthquake ===
The seismic pressure waves created from an explosion may release energy within nearby plates or otherwise cause an earthquake event. An underground explosion concentrates this pressure wave, and a localized earthquake event is more probable. The first and fastest wave, equivalent to a normal earthquake&#x27;s P wave, can inform the location of the test; the S wave and the Rayleigh wave follow. These can all be measured in most circumstances by seismic stations across the globe, and comparisons with actual earthquakes can be used to help determine estimated yield via differential analysis, by the modelling of the high-frequency (&gt;4 Hz) teleseismic P wave amplitudes. However, theory does not suggest that a nuclear explosion of current yields could trigger fault rupture and cause a major quake at distances beyond a few tens of kilometers from the shot point.

=== Summary of the effects ===
The following table summarizes the most important effects of single nuclear explosions under ideal, clear skies, weather conditions. Tables like these are calculated from nuclear weapons effects scaling laws. Advanced computer modelling of real-world conditions and how they impact on the damage to modern urban areas has found that most scaling laws are too simplistic and tend to overestimate nuclear explosion effects. The scaling laws that were used to produce the table below assume (among other things) a perfectly level target area, no attenuating effects from urban terrain masking (e.g. skyscraper shadowing), and no enhancement effects from reflections and tunneling by city streets. As a point of comparison in the chart below, the most likely nuclear weapons to be used against countervalue city targets in a global nuclear war are in the sub-megaton range. Weapons of yields from 100 to 475 kilotons have become the most numerous in the US and Russian nuclear arsenals; for example, the warheads equipping the Russian Bulava submarine-launched ballistic missile (SLBM) have a yield of 150 kilotons. US examples are the W76 and W88 warheads, with the lower yield W76 being over twice as numerous as the W88 in the US nuclear arsenal.

Further complicating matters, under global nuclear war scenarios with conditions similar to that during the Cold War, major strategically important cities like Moscow and Washington are likely to be hit numerous times from sub-megaton multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicles, in a cluster bomb or &quot;cookie-cutter&quot; configuration. It has been reported that during the height of the Cold War in the 1970s Moscow was targeted by up to 60 warheads. 

The reason that the cluster bomb concept is preferable in the targeting of cities is twofold: the first is that large singular warheads are much easier to neutralize as both tracking and successful interception by anti-ballistic missile systems than it is when several smaller incoming warheads are approaching. This strength in numbers advantage to lower yield warheads is further compounded by such warheads tending to move at higher incoming speeds, due to their smaller, more slender physics package size, assuming both nuclear weapon designs are the same (a design exception being the advanced W88). The second reason for this cluster bomb, or &#x27;layering&#x27; (using repeated hits by accurate low yield weapons) is that this tactic along with limiting the risk of failure reduces individual bomb yields, and therefore reduces the possibility of any serious collateral damage to non-targeted nearby civilian areas, including that of neighboring countries. This concept was pioneered by Philip J. Dolan and others.

== Other phenomena ==

Gamma rays from the nuclear processes preceding the true explosion may be partially responsible for the following fireball, as they may superheat nearby air and/or other material. The vast majority of the energy that goes on to form the fireball is in the soft X-ray region of the electromagnetic spectrum, with these X-rays being produced by the inelastic collisions of the high-speed fission and fusion products. It is these reaction products and not the gamma rays which contain most of the energy of the nuclear reactions in the form of kinetic energy. This kinetic energy of the fission and fusion fragments is converted into internal and then radiation energy by approximately following the process of blackbody radiation emitting in the soft X-ray region.

As a result of numerous inelastic collisions, part of the kinetic energy of the fission fragments is converted into internal and radiation energy. Some of the electrons are removed entirely from the atoms, thus causing ionization. Others are raised to higher energy (or excited) states while still remaining attached to the nuclei. Within an extremely short time, perhaps a hundredth of a microsecond or so, the weapon residues consist essentially of completely and partially stripped (ionized) atoms, many of the latter being in excited states, together with the corresponding free electrons. The system then immediately emits electromagnetic (thermal) radiation, the nature of which is determined by the temperature. Since this is of the order of 107 degrees, most of the energy emitted within a microsecond or so is in the soft X-ray region. Because temperature depends on the average internal energy/heat of the particles in a certain volume, internal energy or heat is from kinetic energy.

For an explosion in the atmosphere, the fireball quickly expands to maximum size and then begins to cool as it rises like a balloon through buoyancy in the surrounding air. As it does so, it takes on the flow pattern of a vortex ring with incandescent material in the vortex core as seen in certain photographs. This effect is known as a mushroom cloud. Sand will fuse into glass if it is close enough to the nuclear fireball to be drawn into it, and is thus heated to the necessary temperatures to do so; this is known as trinitite. At the explosion of nuclear bombs lightning discharges sometimes occur.

Smoke trails are often seen in photographs of nuclear explosions. These are not from the explosion; they are left by sounding rockets launched just prior to detonation. These trails allow observation of the blast&#x27;s normally invisible shock wave in the moments following the explosion.

The heat and airborne debris created by a nuclear explosion can cause rain; the debris is thought to do this by acting as cloud condensation nuclei. During the city firestorm which followed the Hiroshima explosion, drops of water were recorded to have been about the size of marbles. This was termed &quot;black rain&quot; and has served as the source of a book and film by the same name. Black rain is not unusual following large fires and is commonly produced by pyrocumulus clouds during large forest fires. The rain directly over Hiroshima on that day is said to have begun around 9 a.m. with it covering a wide area from the hypocenter to the northwest, raining heavily for one hour or more in some areas. The rain directly over the city may have carried neutron activated building material combustion products, but it did not carry any appreciable nuclear weapon debris or fallout, although this is generally to the contrary to what other less technical sources state. The &quot;oily&quot; black soot particles, are a characteristic of incomplete combustion in the city firestorm.

The element einsteinium was discovered when analyzing nuclear fallout.

A side-effect of the Pascal-B nuclear test during Operation Plumbbob may have resulted in the first man-made object launched on an Earth escape trajectory. The so-called &quot;thunder well&quot; effect from the underground explosion may have launched a metal cover plate into space at six times Earth&#x27;s escape velocity, although the evidence remains subject to debate, due to aerodynamic heating likely disintegrating it before it could exit the atmosphere.

=== Ignition of fusion in the environment ===

==== Atmospheric ignition ====
In 1942, there was speculation among the scientists developing the first nuclear weapons in the Manhattan Project that a sufficiently large nuclear explosion might ignite fusion reactions the Earth&#x27;s atmosphere. Since the proposal of the CNO cycle in 1937, it was known that not only the hydrogen in water vapor, but the carbon, nitrogen, and oxygen nuclei in the atmosphere undergo exothermic fusion reactions to heavier nuclei; at stellar temperatures they behave as a fuel. The fear was that similar temperatures in the bomb&#x27;s initial fireball might trigger the exothermic reactions &lt;chem&gt;^{14}N \ + \ ^{1}H \rightarrow ^{15}O \ + \ \gamma &lt;/chem&gt; or &lt;chem&gt;^{14}N \ + \ ^{14}N \rightarrow ^{24}Mg \ + \ \alpha &lt;/chem&gt;, sustaining itself until all the world&#x27;s atmospheric nitrogen was consumed. Hans Bethe was assigned to study this hypothesis from the project&#x27;s earliest days, and he eventually concluded that such a reaction could not sustain itself on a large scale due to cooling of the nuclear fireball through an inverse Compton effect. Richard Hamming was asked to make a similar calculation just before the first nuclear test, and he reached the same conclusion. Nevertheless, the notion has persisted as a rumor for many years and was the source of apocalyptic gallows humor at the Trinity test where Enrico Fermi took side bets on atmospheric ignition. 

Subsequent analysis shows that besides the cooling effect, the latter reaction, with a Gamow energy of 16.46 GeV, was unlikely to have occurred in even a single instance during the Trinity test, as the fireball core reached 1.01 × 1011 K, equivalent to the far lower thermal energy of 8.7 MeV. However, the possibility of fusion of hydrogen nuclei during the test, whose Gamow energies are on the order of 1 MeV, is not known. The first artificial initiation of a thermonuclear reaction is accepted to be the 1951 American nuclear test Greenhouse George.

==== Oceanic ignition ====
Fears of igniting the ocean&#x27;s higher density of hydrogen, deuterium, or oxygen nuclei during American testing in the Pacific, remained a serious concern, especially as yields increased by orders of magnitude. These were raised from the first air burst over water and submerged tests in Operation Crossroads at Bikini Atoll, and continuing with the first full thermonuclear and megaton-level test of Ivy Mike.

==Survivability==

Survivability is highly dependent on factors such as if one is indoors or out, the size of the explosion, the proximity to the explosion, and to a lesser degree the direction of the wind carrying fallout. Death is highly likely and radiation poisoning is almost certain if one is caught in the open with no terrain or building masking effects within a radius of from a 1 megaton airburst, and the 50% chance of death from the blast extends out to ~ from the same 1 megaton atmospheric explosion.

An example that highlights the variability in the real world and the effect of being indoors is Akiko Takakura. Despite the lethal radiation and blast zone extending well past her position at Hiroshima, Takakura survived the effects of a 16 kt atomic bomb at a distance of from the hypocenter, with only minor injuries, due mainly to her position in the lobby of the Bank of Japan, a reinforced concrete building, at the time. In contrast, the unknown person sitting outside, fully exposed, on the steps of the Sumitomo Bank, next door to the Bank of Japan, received lethal third-degree burns and was then likely killed by the blast, in that order, within two seconds.

With medical attention, radiation exposure is survivable to 200 rems of acute dose exposure. If a group of people is exposed to a 50 to 59 rems acute (within 24 hours) radiation dose, none will get radiation sickness. If the group is exposed to 60 to 180 rems, 50% will become sick with radiation poisoning. If medically treated, all of the 60–180 rems group will survive. If the group is exposed to 200 to 450 rems, most if not all of the group will become sick; 50% will die within two to four weeks, even with medical attention. If the group is exposed to 460 to 600 rems, 100% of the group will get radiation poisoning, and 50% will die within one to three weeks. If the group is exposed to 600 to 1000 rems, 50% will die in one to three weeks. If the group is exposed to 1,000 to 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 weeks. At 5,000 rems, 100% of the group will die within 2 days.

==Nuclear explosion impact on humans indoors==
Researchers from the University of Nicosia simulated, using high-order computational fluid dynamics, an atomic bomb explosion from a typical intercontinental ballistic missile and the resulting blast wave to see how it would affect people sheltering indoors. They found that the blast wave was enough in the moderate damage zone to topple some buildings and injure people caught outdoors. However, sturdier buildings, such as concrete structures, can remain standing. The team used advanced computer modelling to study how a nuclear blast wave speeds through a standing structure. Their simulated structure featured rooms, windows, doorways, and corridors and allowed them to calculate the speed of the air following the blast wave and determine the best and worst places to be. 

The study showed that high airspeeds remain a considerable hazard and can still result in severe injuries or even fatalities. Furthermore, simply being in a sturdy building is not enough to avoid risk. The tight spaces can increase airspeed, and the involvement of the blast wave causes air to reflect off walls and bend around corners. In the worst cases, this can produce a force equivalent to multiple times a human&#x27;s body weight. The most dangerous critical indoor locations to avoid are windows, corridors, and doors. The study received considerable interest from the international press.

<doc id="244602" wikidata="Q2290484" url="?curid=244602" title="Two-phase locking">
<text>In databases and transaction processing, two-phase locking (2PL) is a pessimistic concurrency control method that guarantees conflict-serializability. It is also the name of the resulting set of database transaction schedules (histories). The protocol uses locks, applied by a transaction to data, which may block (interpreted as signals to stop) other transactions from accessing the same data during the transaction&#x27;s life.

By the 2PL protocol, locks are applied and removed in two phases:
# Expanding phase: locks are acquired and no locks are released.
# Shrinking phase: locks are released and no locks are acquired.
Two types of locks are used by the basic protocol: &quot;Shared&quot; and &quot;Exclusive&quot; locks. Refinements of the basic protocol may use more lock types. Using locks that block processes, 2PL, S2PL, and SS2PL may be subject to deadlocks that result from the mutual blocking of two or more transactions.

==Read and write locks==
Locks are used to guarantee serializability. A transaction is &quot;holding&quot; a lock on an object if that transaction has acquired a lock on that object which has not yet been released.

For 2PL, the only used data-access locks are read-locks (shared locks) and write-locks (exclusive locks). Below are the rules for &quot;read-locks&quot; and &quot;write-locks&quot;:

* A transaction is allowed to read an object if and only if it is holding a &quot;read-lock&quot; or &quot;write-lock&quot; on that object.
* A transaction is allowed to write an object if and only if it is holding a &quot;write-lock&quot; on that object.
* A schedule (i.e., a set of transactions) is allowed to hold multiple locks on the same object simultaneously if and only if none of those locks are write-locks. If a disallowed lock attempts on being held simultaneously, it will be blocked.

== Variants ==
===Two-phase locking===
According to the two-phase locking protocol, each transaction handles its locks in two distinct, consecutive phases during the transaction&#x27;s execution:

# Expanding phase (aka Growing phase): locks are acquired and no locks are released (the number of locks can only increase).
# Shrinking phase (aka Contracting phase): locks are released and no locks are acquired.

The two phase locking rules can be summarized as: each transaction must never acquire a lock after it has released a lock. The serializability property is guaranteed for a schedule with transactions that obey this rule.

Typically, without explicit knowledge in a transaction on end of phase 1, the rule is safely determined only when a transaction has completed processing and requested commit. In this case, all the locks can be released at once (phase 2).

=== Conservative two-phase locking ===

Conservative two-phase locking (C2PL) differs from 2PL in that transactions obtain all the locks they need before the transactions begin. This is to ensure that a transaction that already holds some locks will not block waiting for other locks. C2PL &quot;prevents&quot; deadlocks. 

In cases of heavy lock contention, C2PL reduces the time locks are held on average, relative to 2PL and Strict 2PL, because transactions that hold locks are never blocked. In light lock contention, C2PL holds more locks than is necessary, because it is difficult to predict which locks will be needed in the future, thus leading to higher overhead. 

A C2PL transaction will not obtain any locks if it cannot obtain all the locks it needs in its initial request. Furthermore, each transaction needs to declare its read and write set (the data items that will be read/written), which is not always possible. Because of these limitations, C2PL is not used very frequently.

===Strict two-phase locking===
To comply with the strict two-phase locking (S2PL) protocol, a transaction needs to comply with 2PL, and release its &quot;write (exclusive)&quot; locks only after the transaction has ended (i.e., either &quot;committed&quot; or &quot;aborted&quot;). On the other hand, &quot;read (shared)&quot; locks are released regularly during the shrinking phase. 

Unlike 2PL, S2PL provides strictness (a special case of cascade-less recoverability). This protocol is not appropriate in B-trees because it causes Bottleneck (while B-trees always starts searching from the parent root). 

===Strong strict two-phase locking===
or Rigorousness, or Rigorous scheduling, or Rigorous two-phase locking

To comply with strong strict two-phase locking (SS2PL), a transaction&#x27;s read and write locks are released only after that transaction has ended (i.e., either committed or aborted). A transaction obeying SS2PL has only a phase 1 and lacks a phase 2 until the transaction has completed. Every SS2PL schedule is also an S2PL schedule, but not vice versa.

<doc id="244603" wikidata="Q570276" url="?curid=244603" title="Spinlock">
<text>In software engineering, a spinlock is a lock that causes a thread trying to acquire it to simply wait in a loop (&quot;spin&quot;) while repeatedly checking whether the lock is available. Since the thread remains active but is not performing a useful task, the use of such a lock is a kind of busy waiting. Once acquired, spinlocks will usually be held until they are explicitly released, although in some implementations they may be automatically released if the thread being waited on (the one that holds the lock) blocks or &quot;goes to sleep&quot;.

Because they avoid overhead from operating system process rescheduling or context switching, spinlocks are efficient if threads are likely to be blocked for only short periods. For this reason, operating-system kernels often use spinlocks. However, spinlocks become wasteful if held for longer durations, as they may prevent other threads from running and require rescheduling. The longer a thread holds a lock, the greater the risk that the thread will be interrupted by the OS scheduler while holding the lock. If this happens, other threads will be left &quot;spinning&quot; (repeatedly trying to acquire the lock), while the thread holding the lock is not making progress towards releasing it. The result is an indefinite postponement until the thread holding the lock can finish and release it. This is especially true on a single-processor system, where each waiting thread of the same priority is likely to waste its quantum (allocated time where a thread can run) spinning until the thread that holds the lock is finally finished.

Implementing spinlocks correctly is challenging because programmers must take into account the possibility of simultaneous access to the lock, which could cause race conditions. Generally, such an implementation is possible only with special assembly language instructions, such as atomic (i.e. un-interruptible) test-and-set operations and cannot be easily implemented in programming languages not supporting truly atomic operations. On architectures without such operations, or if high-level language implementation is required, a non-atomic locking algorithm may be used, e.g. Peterson&#x27;s algorithm. However, such an implementation may require more memory than a spinlock, be slower to allow progress after unlocking, and may not be implementable in a high-level language if out-of-order execution is allowed.

==Example implementation==

The following example uses x86 assembly language to implement a spinlock. It will work on any Intel 80386 compatible processor.

; Intel syntax

locked: ; The lock variable. 1 = locked, 0 = unlocked.
 dd 0

spin_lock:
 mov eax, 1 ; Set the EAX register to 1.
 xchg eax, [locked] ; Atomically swap the EAX register with
 ; the lock variable.
 ; This will always store 1 to the lock, leaving
 ; the previous value in the EAX register.
 test eax, eax ; Test EAX with itself. Among other things, this will
 ; set the processor&#x27;s Zero Flag if EAX is 0.
 ; If EAX is 0, then the lock was unlocked and
 ; we just locked it.
 ; Otherwise, EAX is 1 and we didn&#x27;t acquire the lock.
 jnz spin_lock ; Jump back to the MOV instruction if the Zero Flag is
 ; not set; the lock was previously locked, and so
 ; we need to spin until it becomes unlocked.
 ret ; The lock has been acquired, return to the calling
 ; function.

spin_unlock:
 xor eax, eax ; Set the EAX register to 0.
 xchg eax, [locked] ; Atomically swap the EAX register with
 ; the lock variable.
 ret ; The lock has been released.

==Significant optimizations==

The simple implementation above works on all CPUs using the x86 architecture. However, a number of performance optimizations are possible:

On later implementations of the x86 architecture, &quot;spin_unlock&quot; can safely use an unlocked MOV instead of the slower locked XCHG. This is due to subtle memory ordering rules which support this, even though MOV is not a full memory barrier. However, some processors (some Cyrix processors, some revisions of the Intel Pentium Pro (due to bugs), and earlier Pentium and i486 SMP systems) will do the wrong thing and data protected by the lock could be corrupted. On most non-x86 architectures, explicit memory barrier or atomic instructions (as in the example) must be used. On some systems, such as IA-64, there are special &quot;unlock&quot; instructions which provide the needed memory ordering.

To reduce inter-CPU bus traffic, code trying to acquire a lock should loop reading without trying to write anything until it reads a changed value. Because of MESI caching protocols, this causes the cache line for the lock to become &quot;Shared&quot;; then there is remarkably &quot;no&quot; bus traffic while a CPU waits for the lock. This optimization is effective on all CPU architectures that have a cache per CPU, because MESI is so widespread. On Hyper-Threading CPUs, pausing with codice_1 gives additional performance by hinting to the core that it can work on the other thread while the lock spins waiting. 

Transactional Synchronization Extensions and other hardware transactional memory instruction sets serve to replace locks in most cases. Although locks are still required as a fallback, they have the potential to greatly improve performance by having the processor handle entire blocks of atomic operations. This feature is built into some mutex implementations, for example in glibc. The Hardware Lock Elision (HLE) in x86 is a weakened but backwards-compatible version of TSE, and we can use it here for locking without losing any compatibility. In this particular case, the processor can choose to not lock until two threads actually conflict with each other.

A simpler version of the test can use the codice_2 instruction on x86, or the codice_3 built into many Unix compilers.

With the optimizations applied, a sample would look like:

; In C: while (!__sync_bool_compare_and_swap(&amp;locked, 0, 1)) while (locked) __builtin_ia32_pause();
spin_lock:
 mov ecx, 1 ; Set the ECX register to 1.
retry:
 xor eax, eax ; Zero out EAX, because cmpxchg compares against EAX.
 XACQUIRE lock cmpxchg [locked], ecx
 ; atomically decide: if locked is zero, write ECX to it.
 ; XACQUIRE hints to the processor that we are acquiring a lock.
 je out ; If we locked it (old value equal to EAX: 0), return.
pause:
 mov eax, [locked] ; Read locked into EAX.
 test eax, eax ; Perform the zero-test as before.
 jz retry ; If it&#x27;s zero, we can retry.
 rep nop ; Tell the CPU that we are waiting in a spinloop, so it can
 ; work on the other thread now. Also written as the &quot;pause&quot;.
 jmp pause ; Keep check-pausing.
out:
 ret ; All done.

spin_unlock:
 XRELEASE mov [locked], 0 ; Assuming the memory ordering rules apply, release the 
 ; lock variable with a &quot;lock release&quot; hint.
 ret ; The lock has been released.
On any multi-processor system that uses the MESI contention protocol,
such a test-and-test-and-set lock (TTAS) performs much better than the simple test-and-set lock (TAS) approach.

With large numbers of processors,
adding a random exponential backoff delay before re-checking the lock performs even better than TTAS.

A few multi-core processors have a &quot;power-conscious spin-lock&quot; instruction that puts a processor to sleep, then wakes it up on the next cycle after the lock is freed. A spin-lock using such instructions is more efficient and uses less energy than spin locks with or without a back-off loop.

==Alternatives==

The primary disadvantage of a spinlock is that, while waiting to acquire a lock, it wastes time that might be productively spent elsewhere. There are two ways to avoid this:

# Do not acquire the lock. In many situations it is possible to design data structures that do not require locking, e.g. by using per-thread or per-CPU data and disabling interrupts.
# Switch to a different thread while waiting. This typically involves attaching the current thread to a queue of threads waiting for the lock, followed by switching to another thread that is ready to do some useful work. This scheme also has the advantage that it guarantees that resource starvation does not occur as long as all threads eventually relinquish locks they acquire and scheduling decisions can be made about which thread should progress first. Spinlocks that never entail switching, usable by real-time operating systems, are sometimes called &quot;raw spinlocks&quot;.

Most operating systems (including Solaris, Mac OS X and FreeBSD) use a hybrid approach called &quot;adaptive mutex&quot;. The idea is to use a spinlock when trying to access a resource locked by a currently-running thread, but to sleep if the thread is not currently running. (The latter is &quot;always&quot; the case on single-processor systems.)

OpenBSD attempted to replace spinlocks with ticket locks which enforced first-in-first-out behaviour, however this resulted in more CPU usage in the kernel and larger applications, such as Firefox, becoming much slower.

<text>Wild Wild West is a 1999 American steampunk Western film directed by Barry Sonnenfeld and written by S. S. Wilson and Brent Maddock alongside Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman, based on a story conceived by Jim and John Thomas. Loosely adapted from &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, a 1960s television series created by Michael Garrison, it is the only production since the television film &quot;More Wild Wild West&quot; (1980) to feature the characters from the original series.

The film stars Will Smith (who previously collaborated with Sonnenfeld on &quot;Men in Black&quot; two years earlier in 1997) and Kevin Kline as two U.S. Secret Service agents who work together to protect U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant (Kline in a dual role) and the United States from all manner of dangerous threats during the American Old West. The film features a supporting cast consisting of Kenneth Branagh, Salma Hayek, Ted Levine, and M. Emmet Walsh, as well as an orchestral film score by Western film score veteran Elmer Bernstein and extensive visual effects courtesy of Industrial Light &amp; Magic.

Released theatrically in the United States on June 30, 1999 by Warner Bros. and produced on a $170 million budget (making it one of the most expensive films ever made when adjusting for inflation at the time of its release), &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was a commercial failure, grossing only $113.8 million domestically and $108.3 million overseas for a worldwide total of $222.1 million. Receiving largely negative reviews from critics, the film was nominated for eight Razzies and won five at the 20th Golden Raspberry Awards, including Worst Picture and Worst Original Song (for the song &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; by Smith).

==Plot==
Four years after the end of the American Civil War in 1869, U.S. Army Captain James T. &quot;Jim&quot; West and U.S. Marshal Artemus Gordon cross paths with each other in their hunt for ex-Confederate General &quot;Bloodbath&quot; McGrath, seemingly responsible for a massacre in New Liberty where West&#x27;s parents were killed. U.S. President Ulysses S. Grant informs them about the disappearances of America&#x27;s key scientists and a treasonous plot by McGrath, giving them the task of finding the scientists.

Aboard their train &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, West and Gordon examine the severed head of scientist Thaddeus Morton, finding a clue that leads them to Dr. Arliss Loveless, a legless ex-Confederate officer and engineering genius. Infiltrating Loveless&#x27; plantation during a party, the duo rescues a woman named Rita Escobar, who asks for their help in rescuing her father Guillermo Escobar, who is one of the kidnapped scientists.

Loveless holds a demonstration of his newest weapon, a steam-powered prototype tank, and uses McGrath&#x27;s soldiers for target practice. Accusing McGrath of &quot;betrayal&quot; for surrendering at Appomattox Court House, Loveless shoots and leaves him for dead. Gordon, West, and Rita find McGrath, who reveals Loveless framed him for the massacre before dying. Upon catching up with Loveless on &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, a panicked Rita accidentally releases sleeping gas during a brief fight, knocking out West, Gordon, and herself.

West and Gordon wake up as Loveless pulls away in &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, taking Rita hostage. Announcing his intention to capture Grant at the golden spike ceremony, he leaves the duo in a deadly trap in a cornfield. After narrowly escaping, West and Gordon stumble across Loveless&#x27; private railroad, leading to his secret industrial complex at Spider Canyon. There, they witness Loveless&#x27; ultimate weapon, a giant mechanical spider armed with nitroglycerin cannons that he uses to capture Grant and Gordon at the ceremony, while West gets shot and left for dead by one of Loveless&#x27; henchwomen upon being caught sneaking in the spider.

At his complex, Loveless announces his plan to dissolve the United States, dividing the territory among Great Britain, France, Spain, Mexico, the Native American people and Loveless himself. When Grant refuses to surrender, Loveless orders Gordon to be executed, but West, having survived, disguises himself as a belly dancer and distracts Loveless, allowing Gordon to free the captives.

Loveless escapes on his spider, taking Grant with him. As Loveless once again demands that Grant surrender, he refuses and Loveless responds by destroying a small town. Using a flying machine, Gordon and West catch up to the spider, where West battles Loveless&#x27; henchmen before confronting Loveless himself, now on mechanical legs. After freeing Grant, Gordon shoots one of Loveless&#x27; legs, allowing West to gain the upper hand. As the mechanical spider approaches a cliff, Loveless shoots at West with the concealed gun he used to kill McGrath, but instead hits the spider&#x27;s machinery, halting it abruptly at the canyon&#x27;s edge. Both West and Loveless fall from the spider, but West survives by catching a chain dangling from the machinery.

Grant promotes Gordon and West as the first agents of his new United States Secret Service. As Grant departs on &quot;The Wanderer&quot;, West and Gordon reunite with Rita and attempt to court her, only for Rita to reveal that Professor Escobar is actually her husband. Gordon and West ride into the sunset on the spider.

==Production==
===Development===
&quot;Variety&quot; first reported in January 1992 that Warner Bros. had optioned the film rights to Michael Garrison&#x27;s television show &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot;, and hired Richard Donner to direct a film adaptation written by Shane Black, with Mel Gibson in the role of Jim West (Donner coincidentally directed three episodes of the original series). However, Donner and Gibson left the project to work on a film adaptation of &quot;Maverick&quot; (another film based on a Western television series) in 1994. Despite this, the project continued in the development stage, with Tom Cruise rumored for the lead in 1995. Cruise instead starred in &quot;&quot; the following year.

Discussions with Will Smith and Barry Sonnenfeld began in February 1997 after the two had wrapped up production on &quot;Men in Black&quot; for Columbia Pictures the same year. Smith declined to do the lead role in &quot;The Matrix&quot; in order to star in &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. Warner Bros. pursued George Clooney to co-star with Smith as Artemus Gordon, with Kevin Kline, Matthew McConaughey and Johnny Depp also in contention for the role while screenwriters S. S. Wilson and Brent Maddock (best known for writing the &quot;Short Circuit&quot; and &quot;Tremors&quot; films) were hired by Warner Bros. to script the film between April and May 1997. Clooney signed on the following August after dropping out of &quot;Jack Frost&quot;, while the Wilson-Maddock script was rewritten by Jeffrey Price and Peter S. Seaman (best known for writing the films &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot; and &quot;Doc Hollywood&quot;). However in December 1997, Clooney was replaced by Kline after an agreement with Sonnenfeld: &quot;Ultimately, we all decided that rather than damage this project trying to retrofit the role for me, it was better to step aside and let them get someone else.&quot;

===Writing===
The film featured several significant changes from the television series. For instance, Dr. Loveless, as portrayed by Kenneth Branagh in the film, went from a dwarf to a man without legs who uses a steam-powered wheelchair (similar to that employed by the villain in the episode &quot;The Night of the Brain&quot;); his first name was also changed from Miguelito to Arliss and was given the motive of a Southerner who sought the defeat of the North after the Civil War. Kevin Kline plays Artemus Gordon in the film, whose character is similar to the show&#x27;s version of him portrayed by Ross Martin, except that he is much more egotistical than Jim West. The film depicted Kline&#x27;s Gordon creating more ridiculous, humorous, and implausible inventions than those created by Martin&#x27;s Gordon in the original series, as well as having an aggressive rivalry with West, unlike in the television series where he and West had a very close friendship and trusted each other with their lives. While Gordon did indeed impersonate Grant in three episodes of the series (&quot;The Night of the Steel Assassin&quot;, &quot;The Night of the Colonel&#x27;s Ghost&quot; and &quot;The Night of the Big Blackmail&quot;), they were not played by the same actor. Additionally, West was originally portrayed by Robert Conrad, a Caucasian rather than an African American, which serves a critical plot point as West&#x27;s parents were among the victims of Loveless&#x27;s massacre at New Liberty.

Jon Peters produced the film alongside director Sonnenfeld. In a 2002 Q&amp;A event that appears on &quot;An Evening with Kevin Smith&quot;, filmmaker Kevin Smith talked about working as a screenwriter for Peters on a fifth potential &quot;Superman&quot; film in 1997. He revealed that Peters demanded, among other things, that Superman fight a giant spider in the third act. After &quot;Batman&quot; director Tim Burton came onboard, Smith&#x27;s script was scrapped and the film was never produced due to further complications. A year later, he noted that &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;, with Peters on board as producer, was released with the inclusion of a giant mechanical spider in the final act. Neil Gaiman also revealed that Peters insisted that a giant mechanical spider be included in a proposed film adaptation of &quot;The Sandman&quot;.

===Filming===
Principal photography was set to begin in January 1998, but was pushed three months later to April 22, 1998. The interior sequences on the trains of both Artemus Gordon and Dr. Loveless were shot on sets at Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, 4000 Warner Boulevard, Burbank, California, while the exterior sequences were shot in Idaho on the Camas Prairie Railroad. &quot;The Wanderer&quot; in the film is portrayed by the Baltimore &amp; Ohio 4–4–0 No. 25, one of the oldest operating steam locomotives in the U.S. Built in 1856 at the Mason Machine Works in Taunton, Massachusetts, it was later renamed The &quot;William Mason&quot; in honor of its manufacturer. During preproduction, the engine was sent to the steam shops at the Strasburg Rail Road for restoration and repainting. The locomotive is brought out for the B&amp;O Train Museum in Baltimore&#x27;s &quot;Steam Days&quot;. The &quot;William Mason&quot; and the &quot;Inyo&quot; (which was the locomotive used in the original television series) both appeared in the 1956 Disney film &quot;The Great Locomotive Chase&quot;.

Much of the Wild West footage was shot around Santa Fe, New Mexico, particularly at the western town film set at the Cook Movie Ranch (now Cerro Pelon Ranch). During the shooting of a sequence involving stunts and pyrotechnics, a planned building fire grew out of control and quickly overwhelmed the local fire crews that were standing by. Much of the town was destroyed before the fire was contained.

===Music===
The orchestral film score, including its main theme, was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein, a veteran of many Western film scores such as &quot;The Magnificent Seven&quot;. The score mainly follows the Western genre&#x27;s symphonic tradition, while at times also acknowledging the film&#x27;s anachronistic playfulness by employing a more contemporary music style with notable rock percussion and electronic organ. The score also briefly incorporates Richard Markowitz&#x27;s theme from the original television series in one cue (uncredited in the film and not included on the album); ironically, this was one of the film&#x27;s few elements that were faithful to the series, which also did not credit Markowitz for the theme. Additional parts of the score were composed by Bernstein&#x27;s son Peter, while his daughter Emilie served as one of the orchestrators and producers.

Like most of his films during this period, Will Smith recorded a hip hop song based on the film&#x27;s plot, also titled &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; was a number-one hit on the U.S. pop charts, though it also won a Golden Raspberry Award for Worst Original Song. It was produced by Rob Fusari, who lifted a sample from Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1976 hit &quot;I Wish&quot;. The song also features guest vocals from R&amp;B group Dru Hill, and was a star-making vehicle for Dru Hill lead singer Sisqó. Old-school rapper Kool Moe Dee had previously recorded a &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; single of his own in 1987, to which he re-performs the chorus from his old &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; as the chorus of this new &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. A performance of the song by Smith, Dee, Dru Hill, and Sisqo at the 1999 MTV Movie Awards also included Wonder performing a reprise of the chorus on piano.

====Score====
===Score Deluxe Edition===
==Release==
Upon release on June 30, 1999, alongside Paramount Pictures and Warner Bros.&#x27; R-rated film &quot;South Park: Bigger, Longer &amp; Uncut&quot;, several news reports arose stating that adolescent moviegoers purchased tickets into seeing the PG-13-rated &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; in theaters, but instead went to see the &quot;South Park&quot; film. This was a result of a film industry crackdown that made sneaking into R-rated films tougher for children, as proposed by U.S. President Bill Clinton at the time in response to the moral panic generated by the Columbine High School massacre, which had occurred two months before the release of both films.

===Marketing===
Warner Bros. heavily promoted &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; as an anticipated summer blockbuster instead of Brad Bird&#x27;s animated film &quot;The Iron Giant&quot;, which was released two months after &quot;Wild Wild West&quot;. This sparked controversy as &quot;The Iron Giant&quot; was becoming more critically successful than the critically-panned &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; upon release, despite eventually underperforming at the box office due to the studio deciding to spend their money on marketing for &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; among other films.

===Home media===
Warner Home Video released &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; on VHS and DVD on November 30, 1999, on LaserDisc on December 28, 1999, and on Blu-ray on May 29, 2011.

==Reception==
===Box office===
&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; grossed $27,687,484 during its opening weekend, with a total of $40,957,789 for the Independence Day weekend and ranking first at the North American box office. It dropped into second place below &quot;American Pie&quot; in its second weekend, making $16.8 million. The film ended its theatrical run on October 10, 1999 after five months, having grossed $113,804,681 domestically and $108,300,000 overseas for a worldwide total of $222,104,681 against a production budget of $170 million, making it commercially unsuccessful.

===Critical response===
On Rotten Tomatoes, the film has an approval rating of 16% based on reviews from 131 critics, with an average rating of 4.1/10. The site&#x27;s critical consensus reads, &quot;Bombastic, manic, and largely laugh-free, &quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is a bizarre misfire in which greater care was lavished upon the special effects than on the script.&quot; On Metacritic, the film has a score of 40 out of 100 based on 25 critics, indicating &quot;generally mixed-to-negative reviews&quot;. Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film an average grade of &quot;C+&quot; on an A+ to F scale.

Roger Ebert of &quot;The Chicago Sun-Times&quot; gave the film one star out of four, writing that &quot;&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; is a comedy dead zone. You stare in disbelief as scenes flop and die. The movie is all concept and no content; the elaborate special effects are like watching money burn on the screen.&quot; Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave the film a negative review, saying that the film &quot;leaves reality so far behind that its storytelling would be arbitrary even by comic-book standards, and its characters share no common ground or emotional connection.&quot;

Original series star Robert Conrad was critical of the film adaptation. While he had no problem with changing Jim West to be African-American, he felt that Will Smith was wrong for the part and would have preferred someone with &quot;a Wesley Snipes body with a Denzel Washington head&quot;. He also would have preferred either Kevin Spacey or Gary Sinise for Artemus Gordon, and despised changing Dr. Loveless from a dwarf to an amputee.

===Accolades===
&quot;Wild Wild West&quot; later ranked in the listed bottom 20 of the Stinkers&#x27; &quot;100 Years, 100 Stinkers&quot; list (which noted the 100 worst films of the 20th century) at #2, but lost to &quot;Battlefield Earth&quot;.

==Soundtrack==

A soundtrack containing hip hop and R&amp;B music was released on June 15, 1999, by Interscope Records and Overbrook Music. It peaked at number four on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums.

==Video game==
An action-adventure video game titled &quot;Wild Wild West: The Steel Assassin&quot; was developed and released by SouthPeak Interactive on December 7, 1999, almost six months following the film&#x27;s release.

==Lawsuit==
In 1997, writer Gilbert Ralston sued Warner Bros. over the upcoming feature film based on the series. Ralston helped create the original television series &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and scripted the pilot episode &quot;The Night of the Inferno&quot;. In a deposition, Ralston explained that in 1964, he had been approached by producer Michael Garrison, who &quot;said he had an idea for a series, good commercial idea, and wanted to know if I could glue the idea of a Western hero and a James Bond type together in the same show&quot;. Ralston said he then created the Civil War characters, the format, the story outline and nine drafts of the script that were the basis for the television series. It was his idea, for example, to have a secret agent named Jim West who would perform secret missions for a bumbling President Grant.

Ralston&#x27;s experience brought to light a common Hollywood practice of the 1950s and 1960s when television writers who helped create popular series allowed producers or studios to take credit for a show, thus cheating the writers out of millions of dollars in royalties. However, Ralston died in 1999 before his suit was settled, resulting in Warner Bros. paying his family between $600,000 and $1.5 million.

<doc id="244611" wikidata="Q134465" url="?curid=244611" title="Newton's law of universal gravitation">
<text>Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation describes gravity as a force by stating that every particle attracts every other particle in the universe with a force that is proportional to the product of their masses and inversely proportional to the square of the distance between their centers of mass. Separated objects attract and are attracted as if all their mass were concentrated at their centers. The publication of the law has become known as the &quot;first great unification&quot;, as it marked the unification of the previously described phenomena of gravity on Earth with known astronomical behaviors.

This is a general physical law derived from empirical observations by what Isaac Newton called &quot;inductive reasoning&quot;. It is a part of classical mechanics and was formulated in Newton&#x27;s work &quot;Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot; (Latin for &#x27;Mathematical Principles of Natural Philosophy&#x27; (the &quot;Principia&quot;)), first published on 5 July 1687. 

The equation for universal gravitation thus takes the form:

formula_1

where &quot;F&quot; is the gravitational force acting between two objects, &quot;m1&quot; and &quot;m2&quot; are the masses of the objects, &quot;r&quot; is the distance between the centers of their masses, and &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant.

The first test of Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation between masses in the laboratory was the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; and approximately 71 years after his death.

Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation resembles Coulomb&#x27;s law of electrical forces, which is used to calculate the magnitude of the electrical force arising between two charged bodies. Both are inverse-square laws, where force is inversely proportional to the square of the distance between the bodies. Coulomb&#x27;s law has charge in place of mass and a different constant.

Newton&#x27;s law was later superseded by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, but the universality of the gravitational constant is intact and the law still continues to be used as an excellent approximation of the effects of gravity in most applications. Relativity is required only when there is a need for extreme accuracy, or when dealing with very strong gravitational fields, such as those found near extremely massive and dense objects, or at small distances (such as Mercury&#x27;s orbit around the Sun).

== History ==
Before Newton&#x27;s law of gravity, there were many theories explaining gravity. Philoshophers made observations about things falling down − and developed theories why they do – as early as Aristotle who thought that rocks fall to the ground because seeking the ground was an essential part of their nature.

Around 1600, the scientific method began to take root. René Descartes started over with a more fundamental view, developing ideas of matter and action independent of theology. Galileo Galilei wrote about experimental measurements of falling and rolling objects. Johannes Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion summarized Tycho Brahe&#x27;s astronomical observations.

Around 1666 Isaac Newton developed the idea that Kepler&#x27;s laws must also apply to the orbit of the Moon around the Earth and then to all objects on Earth. The analysis required assuming that the gravitation force acted as if all of the mass of the Earth were concentrated at its center, an unproven conjecture at that time. His calculations of the Moon orbit time was within 16% of the known value. By 1680, new values for the diameter of the Earth improved his orbit time to within 1.6%, but more importantly Newton had found a proof of his earlier conjecture.

In 1687 Newton published his &quot;Principia&quot; which combined his laws of motion with new mathematical analysis to explain Kepler&#x27;s empirical results. His explanation was in the form of a law of universal gravitation: any two bodies are attracted by a force proportional to their mass and inversely proportional to their separation squared.
Newton&#x27;s original formula was:

formula_2

where the symbol formula_3 means &quot;is proportional to&quot;. To make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them (the gravitational constant). Newton would need an accurate measure of this constant to prove his inverse-square law. When Newton presented Book 1 of the unpublished text in April 1686 to the Royal Society, Robert Hooke made a claim that Newton had obtained the inverse square law from him, ultimately a frivolous accusation.

=== Newton&#x27;s &quot;causes hitherto unknown&quot; ===

While Newton was able to formulate his law of gravity in his monumental work, he was deeply uncomfortable with the notion of &quot;action at a distance&quot; that his equations implied. In 1692, in his third letter to Bentley, he wrote: &quot;That one body may act upon another at a distance through a vacuum without the mediation of anything else, by and through which their action and force may be conveyed from one another, is to me so great an absurdity that, I believe, no man who has in philosophic matters a competent faculty of thinking could ever fall into it.&quot;

He never, in his words, &quot;assigned the cause of this power&quot;. In all other cases, he used the phenomenon of motion to explain the origin of various forces acting on bodies, but in the case of gravity, he was unable to experimentally identify the motion that produces the force of gravity (although he invented two mechanical hypotheses in 1675 and 1717). Moreover, he refused to even offer a hypothesis as to the cause of this force on grounds that to do so was contrary to sound science. He lamented that &quot;philosophers have hitherto attempted the search of nature in vain&quot; for the source of the gravitational force, as he was convinced &quot;by many reasons&quot; that there were &quot;causes hitherto unknown&quot; that were fundamental to all the &quot;phenomena of nature&quot;. These fundamental phenomena are still under investigation and, though hypotheses abound, the definitive answer has yet to be found. And in Newton&#x27;s 1713 &quot;General Scholium&quot; in the second edition of &quot;Principia&quot;: &quot;I have not yet been able to discover the cause of these properties of gravity from phenomena and I feign no hypotheses. ... It is enough that gravity does really exist and acts according to the laws I have explained, and that it abundantly serves to account for all the motions of celestial bodies.&quot;

== Modern form ==
In modern language, the law states the following:

Assuming SI units, &quot;F&quot; is measured in newtons (N), &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 in kilograms (kg), &quot;r&quot; in meters (m), and the constant &quot;G&quot; is 
The value of the constant &quot;G&quot; was first accurately determined from the results of the Cavendish experiment conducted by the British scientist Henry Cavendish in 1798, although Cavendish did not himself calculate a numerical value for &quot;G&quot;. This experiment was also the first test of Newton&#x27;s theory of gravitation between masses in the laboratory. It took place 111 years after the publication of Newton&#x27;s &quot;Principia&quot; and 71 years after Newton&#x27;s death, so none of Newton&#x27;s calculations could use the value of &quot;G&quot;; instead he could only calculate a force relative to another force.

== Bodies with spatial extent ==

If the bodies in question have spatial extent (as opposed to being point masses), then the gravitational force between them is calculated by summing the contributions of the notional point masses that constitute the bodies. In the limit, as the component point masses become &quot;infinitely small&quot;, this entails integrating the force (in vector form, see below) over the extents of the two bodies.

In this way, it can be shown that an object with a spherically symmetric distribution of mass exerts the same gravitational attraction on external bodies as if all the object&#x27;s mass were concentrated at a point at its center. (This is not generally true for non-spherically symmetrical bodies.)

For points &quot;inside&quot; a spherically symmetric distribution of matter, Newton&#x27;s shell theorem can be used to find the gravitational force. The theorem tells us how different parts of the mass distribution affect the gravitational force measured at a point located a distance &quot;r&quot;0 from the center of the mass distribution:

* The portion of the mass that is located at radii causes the same force at the radius &quot;r&quot;0 as if all of the mass enclosed within a sphere of radius &quot;r&quot;0 was concentrated at the center of the mass distribution (as noted above).
* The portion of the mass that is located at radii exerts &quot;no net&quot; gravitational force at the radius &quot;r&quot;0 from the center. That is, the individual gravitational forces exerted on a point at radius &quot;r&quot;0 by the elements of the mass outside the radius &quot;r&quot;0 cancel each other.

As a consequence, for example, within a shell of uniform thickness and density there is &quot;no net&quot; gravitational acceleration anywhere within the hollow sphere.

== Vector form ==
Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation can be written as a vector equation to account for the direction of the gravitational force as well as its magnitude. In this formula, quantities in bold represent vectors.

formula_4
where
* F21 is the force applied on body 2 exerted by body 1,
* &quot;G&quot; is the gravitational constant,
* &quot;m&quot;1 and &quot;m&quot;2 are respectively the masses of bodies 1 and 2,
* r21 = r2 − r1 is the displacement vector between bodies 1 and 2, and
* formula_5 is the unit vector from body 1 to body 2.

It can be seen that the vector form of the equation is the same as the scalar form given earlier, except that F is now a vector quantity, and the right hand side is multiplied by the appropriate unit vector. Also, it can be seen that F12 = −F21.

== Gravity field ==

The gravitational field is a vector field that describes the gravitational force that would be applied on an object in any given point in space, per unit mass. It is actually equal to the gravitational acceleration at that point.

It is a generalisation of the vector form, which becomes particularly useful if more than two objects are involved (such as a rocket between the Earth and the Moon). For two objects (e.g. object 2 is a rocket, object 1 the Earth), we simply write r instead of r12 and &quot;m&quot; instead of &quot;m&quot;2 and define the gravitational field g(r) as:

formula_6
so that we can write:

formula_7

This formulation is dependent on the objects causing the field. The field has units of acceleration; in SI, this is m/s2.

Gravitational fields are also conservative; that is, the work done by gravity from one position to another is path-independent. This has the consequence that there exists a gravitational potential field &quot;V&quot;(r) such that

formula_8

If &quot;m&quot;1 is a point mass or the mass of a sphere with homogeneous mass distribution, the force field g(r) outside the sphere is isotropic, i.e., depends only on the distance &quot;r&quot; from the center of the sphere. In that case

formula_9

As per Gauss&#x27;s law, field in a symmetric body can be found by the mathematical equation:

where formula_10 is a closed surface and formula_11 is the mass enclosed by the surface.

Hence, for a hollow sphere of radius formula_12 and total mass formula_13,

formula_14

For a uniform solid sphere of radius formula_12 and total mass formula_13,

formula_17

== Limitations ==

Newton&#x27;s description of gravity is sufficiently accurate for many practical purposes and is therefore widely used. Deviations from it are small when the dimensionless quantities formula_18 and formula_19 are both much less than one, where formula_20 is the gravitational potential, formula_21 is the velocity of the objects being studied, and formula_22 is the speed of light in vacuum.
For example, Newtonian gravity provides an accurate description of the Earth/Sun system, since

formula_23

where formula_24 is the radius of the Earth&#x27;s orbit around the Sun.

In situations where either dimensionless parameter is large, then
general relativity must be used to describe the system. General relativity reduces to Newtonian gravity in the limit of small potential and low velocities, so Newton&#x27;s law of gravitation is often said to be the low-gravity limit of general relativity.

=== Observations conflicting with Newton&#x27;s formula ===
* Newton&#x27;s theory does not fully explain the precession of the perihelion of the orbits of the planets, especially that of Mercury, which was detected long after the life of Newton. There is a 43 arcsecond per century discrepancy between the Newtonian calculation, which arises only from the gravitational attractions from the other planets, and the observed precession, made with advanced telescopes during the 19th century.
* The predicted angular deflection of light rays by gravity (treated as particles travelling at the expected speed) that is calculated by using Newton&#x27;s theory is only one-half of the deflection that is observed by astronomers. Calculations using general relativity are in much closer agreement with the astronomical observations.
* In spiral galaxies, the orbiting of stars around their centers seems to strongly disobey both Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation and general relativity. Astrophysicists, however, explain this marked phenomenon by assuming the presence of large amounts of dark matter.

=== Einstein&#x27;s solution ===

The first two conflicts with observations above were explained by Einstein&#x27;s theory of general relativity, in which gravitation is a manifestation of curved spacetime instead of being due to a force propagated between bodies. In Einstein&#x27;s theory, energy and momentum distort spacetime in their vicinity, and other particles move in trajectories determined by the geometry of spacetime. This allowed a description of the motions of light and mass that was consistent with all available observations. In general relativity, the gravitational force is a fictitious force resulting from the curvature of spacetime, because the gravitational acceleration of a body in free fall is due to its world line being a geodesic of spacetime.

== Extensions ==

In recent years, quests for non-inverse square terms in the law of gravity have been carried out by neutron interferometry.

== Solutions ==
The two-body problem has been completely solved, as has the restricted three-body problem.

The n-body problem is an ancient, classical problem of predicting the individual motions of a group of celestial objects interacting with each other gravitationally. Solving this problem – from the time of the Greeks and on – has been motivated by the desire to understand the motions of the Sun, planets and the visible stars. 
The classical problem can be informally stated as: &quot;given the quasi-steady orbital properties&quot; (&quot;instantaneous position, velocity and time&quot;) &quot;of a group of celestial bodies, predict their interactive forces; and consequently, predict their true orbital motions for all future times&quot;.

In the 20th century, understanding the dynamics of globular cluster star systems became an important &quot;n&quot;-body problem too. The &quot;n&quot;-body problem in general relativity is considerably more difficult to solve.

<text>László József Bíró (; ; 29 September 1899 – 24 October 1985), Hispanicized as Ladislao José Biro, was a Hungarian-Argentine inventor who patented the first commercially successful modern ballpoint pen. The first ballpoint pen had been invented roughly 50 years earlier by John J. Loud, but it was not a commercial success.

==Early life==
Bíró was born to a Hungarian Jewish family in Budapest, Kingdom of Hungary, within the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in 1899 to Mózes Mátyás Schweiger and Janka Ullmann. The Schweigers changed their name to Bíró in 1905. After leaving school, Bíró began work as a journalist in Hungary.

==Invention of the ballpoint pen==
While working as a journalist, Bíró noticed that the ink used in newspaper printing dried quickly, leaving the paper dry and smudge-free. He tried using the same ink in a fountain pen, but found that it would not flow into the tip, as it was too viscous. In 1930 he observed children playing with marbles in a puddle, noticing that the marbles left a trail of water in their wake. This gave him an idea: Why not use a ball-shaped metal nib for writing, which became the initial design idea for the ball pen.

Bíró presented the first production of the ballpoint pen at the Budapest International Fair in 1931. Working with his brother György, a chemist, he developed a new tip consisting of a ball that was free to turn in a socket, and as it turned it would pick up a special viscous ink from a cartridge and then roll to deposit it on the paper. Bíró patented the invention in Paris in 1938.

During World War II, Bíró fled the Nazis with his brother. They relocated to Argentina in 1943 at the invitation of the President of Argentina, Agustin Justo, who met the inventor in Yugoslavia while on vacation, noticing the unusual writing implement. On 17 June 1943, the brothers filed another patent, issued in the US as , and formed &quot;Biro Pens of Argentina&quot; (in Argentina the ballpoint pen is known as &quot;birome&quot;, a portmanteau of the brothers&#x27; surname with that of their business partner, Juan Jorge Meyne). This new design was supposedly licensed for production in the United Kingdom for supply to Royal Air Force aircrew.

In 1945, Marcel Bich bought the patent from Bíró for the pen, which soon became the main product of his company Bic. Bic has sold more than 100 billion ballpoint pens worldwide. In November of that same year, promoter Milton Reynolds introduced a gravity-fed pen to the US market, to try to get around Biro&#x27;s patent, which was based on capillary action, where fresh ink is drawn out of the reservoir of the pen as ink is deposited on the paper. Because the Reynolds workaround depended on a gravity feed, it did not infringe, but required thinner ink and a larger barrel.

== Personal life and death ==
In 1931, Bíró married to Erzsébet Schick in Terézváros, the daughter of Zsigmond Schick and Anna Honig. In 1938, Bíró and his wife converted to Lutheranism.

László Bíró died in Buenos Aires, Argentina, on October 24, 1985.

==Legacy==
A ballpoint pen is widely referred to as a &quot;biro&quot; in many countries, including the UK, Ireland, Australia and Italy. Although the word is a registered trademark, in some countries it has become genericised. 

Argentina&#x27;s Inventors&#x27; Day is celebrated on Bíró&#x27;s birthday, 29 September. On 29 September 2016, the 117th anniversary of his birth, Google commemorated Bíró with a Google Doodle for &quot;his relentless, forward-thinking spirit&quot;.

<text>Pall Mall ( ) is a small unincorporated community in the Wolf River valley of Fentress County, Tennessee, United States. It is named after Pall Mall, London. Pall Mall is located near the Kentucky-Tennessee state-line in northeastern-central Tennessee. The population was at 1,398 people according to the 2000 census.

==Notable people==
The World War I hero Alvin York was raised in Pall Mall. His son Andrew Jackson York (1919–2022) lived in the community. York is commemorated at the Sgt. Alvin C. York State Historic Park in Pall Mall, which includes the family farmhouse and grist mill. York is buried at Wolf River Cemetery in Pall Mall.

John Marshall Clemens (1798–1847), father of Mark Twain and Orion Clemens, was postmaster of Pall Mall from 1832 to 1835; he, his wife Jane Lampton Clemens, and their children Orion, Pamela, Margaret, and Benjamin (born, perhaps here, in 1832) lived in the community at Three Forks of the Wolf River during this period (1831–1835), where they conceived Mark Twain (though the family moved to Florida, Missouri a few months before he was born).

Other notable natives of Pall Mall include U.S. Representative Lincoln Davis and fugitive Billy Dean Anderson.

<doc id="244628" wikidata="Q53390" url="?curid=244628" title="Maureen Connolly">
<text>Maureen Catherine Connolly-Brinker (née Connolly; September 17, 1934 – June 21, 1969), known as &quot;Little Mo&quot;, was an American tennis player, the winner of nine major singles titles in the early 1950s. In 1953, she became the first woman to win a Grand Slam (all four major tournaments during the same calendar year). She is also the only player in history to win a title without losing a set at all four major championships. The following year, in July 1954, a horseback riding accident seriously injured her right leg and ended her competitive tennis career at age 19. She died of ovarian cancer at the age of 34.

==Early years==
Connolly was born in San Diego, California on September 17, 1934, the first child of Martin and Jessamine Connolly. Her parents divorced when she was age 3, and she was raised by her mother and an aunt. She loved horseback riding as a child, but her mother was unable to pay the cost of riding lessons. So, she took up the game of tennis. Connolly&#x27;s tennis career began at the age of 10 on the municipal courts of San Diego. Her first coach, Wilbur Folsom, encouraged her to switch from a left-handed grip to a right-handed one, and she soon became a baseline specialist with tremendous power and accuracy. When she was age 11, Connolly was dubbed &quot;Little Mo&quot; by San Diego sportswriter Nelson Fisher, who compared the power of her forehand and backhand to the firepower of the USS &quot;Missouri&quot;, known colloquially as &quot;Big Mo&quot;. In 1948, Folsom was replaced as her coach by Eleanor Tennant, who previously coached Alice Marble and Bobby Riggs. At age 14, she won 56 consecutive matches, and the following year, she became the youngest girl to win the U.S. national championship for girls 18 and under.

==Playing career==
At the 1951 U.S. Championships, Connolly at age 16 defeated Shirley Fry to become, at that time, the youngest ever to win America&#x27;s most prestigious tennis tournament. Her coach at the time was Eleanor Tennant.

Connolly won her first Wimbledon title in 1952, defeating Louise Brough in the final. She had arrived at the tournament with a shoulder injury but refused to withdraw when Tennant instructed her to do so. The ensuing argument resulted in the end of their partnership. Connolly was seeded first at the 1952 U.S. Championships, and she successfully defended her title with a victory in the final against Doris Hart. For the 1953 season, she hired a new coach, the Australian Davis Cup captain Harry Hopman, and she entered all four Grand Slam tournaments for the first time. She defeated Julie Sampson in the Australian Championships final and Doris Hart in the finals of the French Championships, Wimbledon, and the U.S. Championships to become the first woman, and only the second tennis player after Don Budge, to win the world&#x27;s four major titles in the same year, commonly known as a Grand Slam. She lost only one set in those four tournaments.

Connolly won the last nine Grand Slam singles tournaments she played, including 50 consecutive singles matches. During her Wightman Cup career from 1951 through 1954, she won all seven of her singles matches. Connolly&#x27;s achievements made her the darling of the media and one of the more popular personalities in the U.S.; she was named Female Athlete of the Year by the Associated Press for three straight years, from 1951 through 1953. In 1954, Connolly did not defend her title at the Australian Championships, but successfully defended her French and Wimbledon championships.

==Later life==
===Horseriding accident===
Two weeks after she won her third-straight Wimbledon title, she was horseback riding in San Diego on July 20, 1954. A passing concrete mixer truck frightened her horse Colonel Merryboy, which pinned Connolly between the horse and truck. She was thrown and suffered a compound fracture to her right fibula, which ultimately ended her tennis career at age 19. She had intended to turn professional after the 1954 U.S. National Championships. She officially retired from tennis in February 1955 when she announced her impending marriage to Norman Brinker. Connolly retained Melvin Belli as counsel and sued the concrete mixer company. On December 17, 1957, the Supreme Court of California unanimously affirmed a $95,000 jury verdict in her favor; the opinion was signed by Chief Justice Phil S. Gibson.

===Marriage===
In June 1955, Connolly married Norman Brinker, a member of the 1952 Olympic equestrian team for the United States, who shared her love of horses. They had two daughters, Cindy and Brenda, and she remained partially involved in tennis, acting as a correspondent for some U.S. and British newspapers at major U.S. tennis tournaments. Connolly was a coach for the British Wightman Cup team during its visits to the U.S. In Texas, where the couple lived, she established the Maureen Connolly Brinker Foundation to promote junior tennis.

In 1957, she published an autobiography titled &quot;Forehand Drive&quot;. Connolly recognized the downside of her tennis career, writing &quot;I have always believed greatness on a tennis court was my destiny, a dark destiny, at times, where the court became my secret jungle and I a lonely, fear-stricken hunter. I was a strange little girl armed with hate, fear, and a Golden Racket.&quot;

==Death==
In 1966, Connolly was diagnosed with ovarian cancer. On June 4, 1969, she underwent a third operation for a stomach tumour at Baylor Hospital in Dallas. She died nearly three weeks later on June 21, at the age of 34.

==Legacy==
According to John Olliff and Lance Tingay of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; and the &quot;Daily Mail&quot;, Connolly was ranked in the world top 10 from 1951 through 1954, reaching a career high of world number one in those rankings from 1952 through 1954. Connolly was included in the year-end top-10 rankings issued by the United States Lawn Tennis Association from 1950 through 1953. She was the top-ranked U.S. player from 1951 through 1953.

Connolly was inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in 1969 and the International Women&#x27;s Sports Hall of Fame in 1987. In 1956, she was inducted by the San Diego Hall of Champions into the Breitbard Hall of Fame honoring San Diego&#x27;s finest athletes both on and off the playing surface.

Since 1973, the Maureen Connolly Challenge Trophy is played, a yearly competition between the best female tennis players age 18 and younger from the United States and Great Britain.
Brinker Elementary School in Plano, Texas is named in honor of her. The school was dedicated on November 20, 1988.

Connolly was portrayed by Glynnis O&#x27;Connor in &quot;Little Mo&quot;, a television movie that aired on September 5, 1978.

In 2019, the United States Postal Service released a commemorative Forever stamp in her honor.

<doc id="244629" wikidata="Q408891" url="?curid=244629" title="Scientific law">
<text>Scientific laws or laws of science are statements, based on repeated experiments or observations, that describe or predict a range of natural phenomena. The term &quot;law&quot; has diverse usage in many cases (approximate, accurate, broad, or narrow) across all fields of natural science (physics, chemistry, astronomy, geoscience, biology). Laws are developed from data and can be further developed through mathematics; in all cases they are directly or indirectly based on empirical evidence. It is generally understood that they implicitly reflect, though they do not explicitly assert, causal relationships fundamental to reality, and are discovered rather than invented.

Scientific laws summarize the results of experiments or observations, usually within a certain range of application. In general, the accuracy of a law does not change when a new theory of the relevant phenomenon is worked out, but rather the scope of the law&#x27;s application, since the mathematics or statement representing the law does not change. As with other kinds of scientific knowledge, scientific laws do not express absolute certainty, as mathematical laws do. A scientific law may be contradicted, restricted, or extended by future observations.

A law can often be formulated as one or several statements or equations, so that it can predict the outcome of an experiment. Laws differ from hypotheses and postulates, which are proposed during the scientific process before and during validation by experiment and observation. Hypotheses and postulates are not laws, since they have not been verified to the same degree, although they may lead to the formulation of laws. Laws are narrower in scope than scientific theories, which may entail one or several laws. Science distinguishes a law or theory from facts. Calling a law a fact is ambiguous, an overstatement, or an equivocation. The nature of scientific laws has been much discussed in philosophy, but in essence scientific laws are simply empirical conclusions reached by the scientific method; they are intended to be neither laden with ontological commitments nor statements of logical .

Social sciences such as economics have also attempted to formulate scientific laws, though these generally have much less predictive power.

== Overview ==
A scientific law always applies to a physical system under repeated conditions, and it implies that there is a causal relationship involving the elements of the system. Factual and well-confirmed statements like &quot;Mercury is liquid at standard temperature and pressure&quot; are considered too specific to qualify as scientific laws. A central problem in the philosophy of science, going back to David Hume, is that of distinguishing causal relationships (such as those implied by laws) from principles that arise due to constant conjunction.

Laws differ from scientific theories in that they do not posit a mechanism or explanation of phenomena: they are merely distillations of the results of repeated observation. As such, the applicability of a law is limited to circumstances resembling those already observed, and the law may be found to be false when extrapolated. Ohm&#x27;s law only applies to linear networks; Newton&#x27;s law of universal gravitation only applies in weak gravitational fields; the early laws of aerodynamics, such as Bernoulli&#x27;s principle, do not apply in the case of compressible flow such as occurs in transonic and supersonic flight; Hooke&#x27;s law only applies to strain below the elastic limit; Boyle&#x27;s law applies with perfect accuracy only to the ideal gas, etc. These laws remain useful, but only under the specified conditions where they apply.

Many laws take mathematical forms, and thus can be stated as an equation; for example, the law of conservation of energy can be written as formula_1, where formula_2 is the total amount of energy in the universe. Similarly, the first law of thermodynamics can be written as formula_3, and Newton&#x27;s second law can be written as formula_4 While these scientific laws explain what our senses perceive, they are still empirical (acquired by observation or scientific experiment) and so are not like mathematical theorems which can be proved purely by mathematics.

Like theories and hypotheses, laws make predictions; specifically, they predict that new observations will conform to the given law. Laws can be falsified if they are found in contradiction with new data.

Some laws are only approximations of other more general laws, and are good approximations with a restricted domain of applicability. For example, Newtonian dynamics (which is based on Galilean transformations) is the low-speed limit of special relativity (since the Galilean transformation is the low-speed approximation to the Lorentz transformation). Similarly, the Newtonian gravitation law is a low-mass approximation of general relativity, and Coulomb&#x27;s law is an approximation to quantum electrodynamics at large distances (compared to the range of weak interactions). In such cases it is common to use the simpler, approximate versions of the laws, instead of the more accurate general laws.

Laws are constantly being tested experimentally to increasing degrees of precision, which is one of the main goals of science. The fact that laws have never been observed to be violated does not preclude testing them at increased accuracy or in new kinds of conditions to confirm whether they continue to hold, or whether they break, and what can be discovered in the process. It is always possible for laws to be invalidated or proven to have limitations, by repeatable experimental evidence, should any be observed. Well-established laws have indeed been invalidated in some special cases, but the new formulations created to explain the discrepancies generalize upon, rather than overthrow, the originals. That is, the invalidated laws have been found to be only close approximations, to which other terms or factors must be added to cover previously unaccounted-for conditions, e.g. very large or very small scales of time or space, enormous speeds or masses, etc. Thus, rather than unchanging knowledge, physical laws are better viewed as a series of improving and more precise generalizations.

== Properties ==

Scientific laws are typically conclusions based on repeated scientific experiments and observations over many years and which have become accepted universally within the scientific community. A scientific law is &quot;inferred from particular facts, applicable to a defined group or class of phenomena, and expressible by the statement that a particular phenomenon always occurs if certain conditions be present&quot;. The production of a summary description of our environment in the form of such laws is a fundamental aim of science.

Several general properties of scientific laws, particularly when referring to laws in physics, have been identified. Scientific laws are:
* True, at least within their regime of validity. By definition, there have never been repeatable contradicting observations.
* Universal. They appear to apply everywhere in the universe. 
* Simple. They are typically expressed in terms of a single mathematical equation.
* Absolute. Nothing in the universe appears to affect them.
* Stable. Unchanged since first discovered (although they may have been shown to be approximations of more accurate laws),
* All-encompassing. Everything in the universe apparently must comply with them (according to observations).
* Generally conservative of quantity.
* Often expressions of existing homogeneities (symmetries) of space and time.
* Typically theoretically reversible in time (if non-quantum), although time itself is irreversible.
* Broad. In physics, laws exclusively refer to the broad domain of matter, motion, energy, and force itself, rather than more specific systems in the universe, such as living systems, e.g. the mechanics of the human body.

The term &quot;scientific law&quot; is traditionally associated with the natural sciences, though the social sciences also contain laws. For example, Zipf&#x27;s law is a law in the social sciences which is based on mathematical statistics. In these cases, laws may describe general trends or expected behaviors rather than being absolutes.

In natural science, impossibility assertions come to be widely accepted as overwhelmingly probable rather than considered proved to the point of being unchallengeable. The basis for this strong acceptance is a combination of extensive evidence of something not occurring, combined with an underlying theory, very successful in making predictions, whose assumptions lead logically to the conclusion that something is impossible. While an impossibility assertion in natural science can never be absolutely proved, it could be refuted by the observation of a single counterexample. Such a counterexample would require that the assumptions underlying the theory that implied the impossibility be re-examined.

Some examples of widely accepted impossibilities in physics are perpetual motion machines, which violate the law of conservation of energy, exceeding the speed of light, which violates the implications of special relativity, the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics, which asserts the impossibility of simultaneously knowing both the position and the momentum of a particle, and Bell&#x27;s theorem: no physical theory of local hidden variables can ever reproduce all of the predictions of quantum mechanics.

== Laws as consequences of mathematical symmetries ==

Some laws reflect mathematical symmetries found in nature (e.g. the Pauli exclusion principle reflects identity of electrons, conservation laws reflect homogeneity of space, time, and Lorentz transformations reflect rotational symmetry of spacetime). Many fundamental physical laws are mathematical consequences of various symmetries of space, time, or other aspects of nature. Specifically, Noether&#x27;s theorem connects some conservation laws to certain symmetries. For example, conservation of energy is a consequence of the shift symmetry of time (no moment of time is different from any other), while conservation of momentum is a consequence of the symmetry (homogeneity) of space (no place in space is special, or different from any other). The indistinguishability of all particles of each fundamental type (say, electrons, or photons) results in the Dirac and Bose quantum statistics which in turn result in the Pauli exclusion principle for fermions and in Bose–Einstein condensation for bosons. Special relativity uses rapidity to express motion according to the symmetries of hyperbolic rotation, a transformation mixing space and time. Symmetry between inertial and gravitational mass results in general relativity.

The inverse square law of interactions mediated by massless bosons is the mathematical consequence of the 3-dimensionality of space.

One strategy in the search for the most fundamental laws of nature is to search for the most general mathematical symmetry group that can be applied to the fundamental interactions.

== Laws of physics ==
=== Conservation laws ===

==== Conservation and symmetry ====
Conservation laws are fundamental laws that follow from the homogeneity of space, time and phase, in other words &quot;symmetry&quot;.
* Noether&#x27;s theorem: Any quantity with a continuously differentiable symmetry in the action has an associated conservation law.
* Conservation of mass was the first law to be understood since most macroscopic physical processes involving masses, for example, collisions of massive particles or fluid flow, provide the apparent belief that mass is conserved. Mass conservation was observed to be true for all chemical reactions. In general, this is only approximative because with the advent of relativity and experiments in nuclear and particle physics: mass can be transformed into energy and vice versa, so mass is not always conserved but part of the more general conservation of mass–energy.
* Conservation of energy, momentum and angular momentum for isolated systems can be found to be symmetries in time, translation, and rotation.
* Conservation of charge was also realized since charge has never been observed to be created or destroyed and only found to move from place to place.

==== Continuity and transfer ====

Conservation laws can be expressed using the general continuity equation (for a conserved quantity) can be written in differential form as:
: formula_5
where &quot;ρ&quot; is some quantity per unit volume, J is the flux of that quantity (change in quantity per unit time per unit area). Intuitively, the divergence (denoted ∇⋅) of a vector field is a measure of flux diverging radially outwards from a point, so the negative is the amount piling up at a point; hence the rate of change of density in a region of space must be the amount of flux leaving or collecting in some region (see the main article for details). In the table below, the fluxes flows for various physical quantities in transport, and their associated continuity equations, are collected for comparison.

More general equations are the convection–diffusion equation and Boltzmann transport equation, which have their roots in the continuity equation.

=== Laws of classical mechanics ===

==== Principle of least action ====

Classical mechanics, including Newton&#x27;s laws, Lagrange&#x27;s equations, Hamilton&#x27;s equations, etc., can be derived from the following principle:
: formula_6
where formula_7 is the action; the integral of the Lagrangian
: formula_8
of the physical system between two times &quot;t&quot;1 and &quot;t&quot;2. The kinetic energy of the system is &quot;T&quot; (a function of the rate of change of the configuration of the system), and potential energy is &quot;V&quot; (a function of the configuration and its rate of change). The configuration of a system which has &quot;N&quot; degrees of freedom is defined by generalized coordinates q = (&quot;q&quot;1, &quot;q&quot;2, ... &quot;qN&quot;).

There are generalized momenta conjugate to these coordinates, p = (&quot;p&quot;1, &quot;p&quot;2, ..., &quot;pN&quot;), where:
: formula_9

The action and Lagrangian both contain the dynamics of the system for all times. The term &quot;path&quot; simply refers to a curve traced out by the system in terms of the generalized coordinates in the configuration space, i.e. the curve q(&quot;t&quot;), parameterized by time (see also parametric equation for this concept).

The action is a &quot;functional&quot; rather than a &quot;function&quot;, since it depends on the Lagrangian, and the Lagrangian depends on the path q(&quot;t&quot;), so the action depends on the &quot;entire&quot; &quot;shape&quot; of the path for all times (in the time interval from &quot;t&quot;1 to &quot;t&quot;2). Between two instants of time, there are infinitely many paths, but one for which the action is stationary (to the first order) is the true path. The stationary value for the &quot;entire continuum&quot; of Lagrangian values corresponding to some path, &quot;not just one value&quot; of the Lagrangian, is required (in other words it is &quot;not&quot; as simple as &quot;differentiating a function and setting it to zero, then solving the equations to find the points of maxima and minima etc&quot;, rather this idea is applied to the entire &quot;shape&quot; of the function, see calculus of variations for more details on this procedure).

Notice &quot;L&quot; is &quot;not&quot; the total energy &quot;E&quot; of the system due to the difference, rather than the sum:
: formula_10

The following general approaches to classical mechanics are summarized below in the order of establishment. They are equivalent formulations. Newton&#x27;s is commonly used due to simplicity, but Hamilton&#x27;s and Lagrange&#x27;s equations are more general, and their range can extend into other branches of physics with suitable modifications.

From the above, any equation of motion in classical mechanics can be derived.

Corollaries in mechanics :
* Euler&#x27;s laws of motion
* Euler&#x27;s equations (rigid body dynamics)

Corollaries in fluid mechanics :

Equations describing fluid flow in various situations can be derived, using the above classical equations of motion and often conservation of mass, energy and momentum. Some elementary examples follow.
* Archimedes&#x27; principle
* Bernoulli&#x27;s principle
* Poiseuille&#x27;s law
* Stokes&#x27; law
* Navier–Stokes equations
* Faxén&#x27;s law

=== Laws of gravitation and relativity ===

Some of the more famous laws of nature are found in Isaac Newton&#x27;s theories of (now) classical mechanics, presented in his &quot;Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica&quot;, and in Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity.

==== Modern laws ====

Special relativity :

The two postulates of special relativity are not &quot;laws&quot; in themselves, but assumptions of their nature in terms of &quot;relative motion&quot;.

They can be stated as &quot;the laws of physics are the same in all inertial frames&quot; and &quot;the speed of light is constant and has the same value in all inertial frames&quot;.

The said postulates lead to the Lorentz transformations – the transformation law between two frame of references moving relative to each other. For any 4-vector
: formula_11
this replaces the Galilean transformation law from classical mechanics. The Lorentz transformations reduce to the Galilean transformations for low velocities much less than the speed of light &quot;c&quot;.

The magnitudes of 4-vectors are invariants – &quot;not&quot; &quot;conserved&quot;, but the same for all inertial frames (i.e. every observer in an inertial frame will agree on the same value), in particular if &quot;A&quot; is the four-momentum, the magnitude can derive the famous invariant equation for mass–energy and momentum conservation (see invariant mass):
: formula_12
in which the (more famous) mass–energy equivalence is a special case.

General relativity :

General relativity is governed by the Einstein field equations, which describe the curvature of space-time due to mass–energy equivalent to the gravitational field. Solving the equation for the geometry of space warped due to the mass distribution gives the metric tensor. Using the geodesic equation, the motion of masses falling along the geodesics can be calculated.

Gravitoelectromagnetism :

In a relatively flat spacetime due to weak gravitational fields, gravitational analogues of Maxwell&#x27;s equations can be found; the GEM equations, to describe an analogous &quot;gravitomagnetic field&quot;. They are well established by the theory, and experimental tests form ongoing research.

These equations can be modified to include magnetic monopoles, and are consistent with our observations of monopoles either existing or not existing; if they do not exist, the generalized equations reduce to the ones above, if they do, the equations become fully symmetric in electric and magnetic charges and currents. Indeed, there is a duality transformation where electric and magnetic charges can be &quot;rotated into one another&quot;, and still satisfy Maxwell&#x27;s equations.

Pre-Maxwell laws :

These laws were found before the formulation of Maxwell&#x27;s equations. They are not fundamental, since they can be derived from Maxwell&#x27;s equations. Coulomb&#x27;s law can be found from Gauss&#x27;s law (electrostatic form) and the Biot–Savart law can be deduced from Ampere&#x27;s law (magnetostatic form). Lenz&#x27;s law and Faraday&#x27;s law can be incorporated into the Maxwell–Faraday equation. Nonetheless, they are still very effective for simple calculations.
* Lenz&#x27;s law
* Coulomb&#x27;s law
* Biot–Savart law

Other laws :
* Ohm&#x27;s law
* Kirchhoff&#x27;s laws
* Joule&#x27;s law

=== Photonics ===

Classically, optics is based on a variational principle: light travels from one point in space to another in the shortest time.
* Fermat&#x27;s principle

In geometric optics laws are based on approximations in Euclidean geometry (such as the paraxial approximation).
* Law of reflection
* Law of refraction, Snell&#x27;s law

In physical optics, laws are based on physical properties of materials.
* Brewster&#x27;s angle
* Malus&#x27;s law
* Beer–Lambert law

In actuality, optical properties of matter are significantly more complex and require quantum mechanics.

=== Laws of quantum mechanics ===

Quantum mechanics has its roots in postulates. This leads to results which are not usually called &quot;laws&quot;, but hold the same status, in that all of quantum mechanics follows from them. These postulates can be summarized as follows:
* The state of a physical system, be it a particle or a system of many particles, is described by a wavefunction.
* Every physical quantity is described by an operator acting on the system; the measured quantity has a probabilistic nature.
* The wavefunction obeys the Schrödinger equation. Solving this wave equation predicts the time-evolution of the system&#x27;s behavior, analogous to solving Newton&#x27;s laws in classical mechanics.
* Two identical particles, such as two electrons, cannot be distinguished from one another by any means. Physical systems are classified by their symmetry properties.

These postulates in turn imply many other phenomena, e.g., uncertainty principles and the Pauli exclusion principle.

=== Radiation laws ===

Applying electromagnetism, thermodynamics, and quantum mechanics, to atoms and molecules, some laws of electromagnetic radiation and light are as follows.
* Stefan–Boltzmann law
* Planck&#x27;s law of black-body radiation
* Wien&#x27;s displacement law
* Radioactive decay law

== Laws of chemistry ==
Chemical laws are those laws of nature relevant to chemistry. Historically, observations led to many empirical laws, though now it is known that chemistry has its foundations in quantum mechanics.

Quantitative analysis :

The most fundamental concept in chemistry is the law of conservation of mass, which states that there is no detectable change in the quantity of matter during an ordinary chemical reaction. Modern physics shows that it is actually energy that is conserved, and that energy and mass are related; a concept which becomes important in nuclear chemistry. Conservation of energy leads to the important concepts of equilibrium, thermodynamics, and kinetics.

Additional laws of chemistry elaborate on the law of conservation of mass. Joseph Proust&#x27;s law of definite composition says that pure chemicals are composed of elements in a definite formulation; we now know that the structural arrangement of these elements is also important.

Dalton&#x27;s law of multiple proportions says that these chemicals will present themselves in proportions that are small whole numbers; although in many systems (notably biomacromolecules and minerals) the ratios tend to require large numbers, and are frequently represented as a fraction.

The law of definite composition and the law of multiple proportions are the first two of the three laws of stoichiometry, the proportions by which the chemical elements combine to form chemical compounds. The third law of stoichiometry is the law of reciprocal proportions, which provides the basis for establishing equivalent weights for each chemical element. Elemental equivalent weights can then be used to derive atomic weights for each element.
More modern laws of chemistry define the relationship between energy and its transformations.

Reaction kinetics and equilibria :
* In equilibrium, molecules exist in mixture defined by the transformations possible on the timescale of the equilibrium, and are in a ratio defined by the intrinsic energy of the molecules—the lower the intrinsic energy, the more abundant the molecule. Le Chatelier&#x27;s principle states that the system opposes changes in conditions from equilibrium states, i.e. there is an opposition to change the state of an equilibrium reaction.
* Transforming one structure to another requires the input of energy to cross an energy barrier; this can come from the intrinsic energy of the molecules themselves, or from an external source which will generally accelerate transformations. The higher the energy barrier, the slower the transformation occurs.
* There is a hypothetical intermediate, or &quot;transition structure&quot;, that corresponds to the structure at the top of the energy barrier. The Hammond–Leffler postulate states that this structure looks most similar to the product or starting material which has intrinsic energy closest to that of the energy barrier. Stabilizing this hypothetical intermediate through chemical interaction is one way to achieve catalysis.
* All chemical processes are reversible (law of microscopic reversibility) although some processes have such an energy bias, they are essentially irreversible.
* The reaction rate has the mathematical parameter known as the rate constant. The Arrhenius equation gives the temperature and activation energy dependence of the rate constant, an empirical law.

Thermochemistry :
* Dulong–Petit law
* Gibbs–Helmholtz equation
* Hess&#x27;s law

Gas laws :
* Raoult&#x27;s law
* Henry&#x27;s law

Chemical transport :
* Fick&#x27;s laws of diffusion
* Graham&#x27;s law
* Lamm equation

== Laws of biology ==
=== Ecology ===

* Competitive exclusion principle or Gause&#x27;s law

=== Genetics ===

* Mendelian laws (Dominance and Uniformity, segregation of genes, and Independent Assortment)
* Hardy–Weinberg principle

=== Natural selection ===
Whether or not Natural Selection is a “law of nature” is controversial among biologists. Henry Byerly, an American philosopher known for his work on evolutionary theory, discussed the problem of interpreting a principle of natural selection as a law. He suggested a formulation of natural selection as a framework principle that can contribute to a better understanding of evolutionary theory. His approach was to express relative fitness, the propensity of a genotype to increase in proportionate representation in a competitive environment, as a function of adaptedness (adaptive design) of the organism.

== Laws of Earth sciences ==

=== Geography ===

* Arbia&#x27;s law of geography
* Tobler&#x27;s first law of geography
* Tobler&#x27;s second law of geography

=== Geology ===

* Archie&#x27;s law
* Buys Ballot&#x27;s law
* Birch&#x27;s law
* Byerlee&#x27;s law
* Principle of original horizontality
* Law of superposition 
* Principle of lateral continuity
* Principle of cross-cutting relationships
* Principle of faunal succession
* Principle of inclusions and components 
* Walther&#x27;s law

== Other fields ==
Some mathematical theorems and axioms are referred to as laws because they provide logical foundation to empirical laws.

Examples of other observed phenomena sometimes described as laws include the Titius–Bode law of planetary positions, Zipf&#x27;s law of linguistics, and Moore&#x27;s law of technological growth. Many of these laws fall within the scope of uncomfortable science. Other laws are pragmatic and observational, such as the law of unintended consequences. By analogy, principles in other fields of study are sometimes loosely referred to as &quot;laws&quot;. These include Occam&#x27;s razor as a principle of philosophy and the Pareto principle of economics.

== History ==
The observation and detection of underlying regularities in nature date from prehistoric times – the recognition of cause-and-effect relationships implicitly recognises the existence of laws of nature. The recognition of such regularities as independent scientific laws &quot;per se&quot;, though, was limited by their entanglement in animism, and by the attribution of many effects that do not have readily obvious causes—such as physical phenomena—to the actions of gods, spirits, supernatural beings, etc. Observation and speculation about nature were intimately bound up with metaphysics and morality.

In Europe, systematic theorizing about nature (&quot;physis&quot;) began with the early Greek philosophers and scientists and continued into the Hellenistic and Roman imperial periods, during which times the intellectual influence of Roman law increasingly became paramount.The formula &quot;law of nature&quot; first appears as &quot;a live metaphor&quot; favored by Latin poets Lucretius, Virgil, Ovid, Manilius, in time gaining a firm theoretical presence in the prose treatises of Seneca and Pliny. Why this Roman origin? According to [historian and classicist Daryn] Lehoux&#x27;s persuasive narrative, the idea was made possible by the pivotal role of codified law and forensic argument in Roman life and culture.
For the Romans ... the place par excellence where ethics, law, nature, religion and politics overlap is the law court. When we read Seneca&#x27;s &quot;Natural Questions&quot;, and watch again and again just how he applies standards of evidence, witness evaluation, argument and proof, we can recognize that we are reading one of the great Roman rhetoricians of the age, thoroughly immersed in forensic method. And not Seneca alone. Legal models of scientific judgment turn up all over the place, and for example prove equally integral to Ptolemy&#x27;s approach to verification, where the mind is assigned the role of magistrate, the senses that of disclosure of evidence, and dialectical reason that of the law itself.

The precise formulation of what are now recognized as modern and valid statements of the laws of nature dates from the 17th century in Europe, with the beginning of accurate experimentation and the development of advanced forms of mathematics. During this period, natural philosophers such as Isaac Newton (1642–1727) were influenced by a religious view – stemming from medieval concepts of divine law – which held that God had instituted absolute, universal and immutable physical laws. In chapter 7 of &quot;The World&quot;, René Descartes (1596–1650) described &quot;nature&quot; as matter itself, unchanging as created by God, thus changes in parts &quot;are to be attributed to nature. The rules according to which these changes take place I call the &#x27;laws of nature&#x27;.&quot; The modern scientific method which took shape at this time (with Francis Bacon (1561–1626) and Galileo (1564–1642)) contributed to a trend of separating science from theology, with minimal speculation about metaphysics and ethics. (Natural law in the political sense, conceived as universal (i.e., divorced from sectarian religion and accidents of place), was also elaborated in this period by scholars such as Grotius (1583–1645), Spinoza (1632–1677), and Hobbes (1588–1679).)

The distinction between natural law in the political-legal sense and law of nature or physical law in the scientific sense is a modern one, both concepts being equally derived from &quot;physis&quot;, the Greek word (translated into Latin as &quot;natura&quot;) for &quot;nature&quot;.

<text>Jay&#x27;s Journal is a 1979 book that was published in a diary format. The book is presented as an autobiographical account of a depressed teenage boy who becomes involved with a Satanic group. After participating in several occult rituals, Jay believes he is being haunted by a demon named &quot;Raul.&quot; The book was edited and written by Beatrice Sparks, and is based partly on the life of 16-year-old Alden Barrett from Pleasant Grove, Utah, who died by suicide in 1971. Critics allege Sparks misrepresented Barrett&#x27;s life and experiences.

==Plot==

In the mid-to-late 1970s, Jay is a religious, depressed teenager who begins a journal after being persuaded by his Sunday School teachers. Jay nicknames his diary Judas and begins writing poetry venting his feelings about conformity, and discusses his parents, who he frequently gets in trouble with. He is friends with two boys named Brad and Dell, who he frequently discusses in his entries.

Jay falls in love with a girl named Debbie Dale, and begins writing odes to her in his journal. Brad and Dell discourage his crush on Debbie, though, because she is known to have dated a lot of boys. Regardless, his crush becomes gradually more intense, to the point where Jay copes with marijuana when Debbie goes to Phoenix with her parents for her birthday.

For his fifteenth birthday, Jay&#x27;s dad gives him a job at a pharmacy he works at. When Debbie returns from Phoenix, Jay begins a relationship with her and his infatuation grows. Debbie begins to ask him to lend her amphetamines from the pharmacy that he works at, and makes him cover up the theft by filling the capsules with powdered milk. Although feeling guilty about what he does, Jay is far too infatuated with Debbie to refuse, so he ignores his guilt and does so.

Jay&#x27;s guilt begins to worsen when he imagines scenarios of people being given the false, ineffective capsules to help their intense pain. He especially feels guilty after hearing about his Aunt Laurel being in intense pain from cancer, to the point where she was &quot;crying and begging him [Jay&#x27;s dad] to give her something and make her die.&quot; His feelings towards Debbie become conflicted, and he tries to maintain his love for her.

Jay is caught stealing drugs by his dad, who angrily fires him on the spot. The pharmacy begins to get into legal trouble, and Jay&#x27;s dad calls the police and has Jay sent to a juvenile detention center. Jay, who is still writing in his journal, expresses regret over his crimes and reminisces about life with Brad and Dell. He is delighted by the frequent letters that Debbie sends, but then Debbie stops writing to him and they break up, leaving Jay distraught.

Jay eventually meets Pete, who appears different to him. Pete introduces him to matters relating to the occult. In further detail, Jay writes, 

Jay is confused by Pete, but eventually claims to witness Pete move a chair with &quot;mental powers&quot; and make a wart on his finger disappear. He finds himself drawn to Pete, who teaches him and some other boys about different aforementioned topics. He writes about liaisons between him and Pete in which they discuss auras and psychic selves. Eventually, Pete begins giving Jay herbs that make him have strange yet alluring dreams. Jay is upset when he is informed that he will soon be released from the detention center, but his perspective on his family soon improves, and he begins missing them and anticipating arriving home.

Jay is released into the custody of his parents, but finds that his home life is unexciting with all of the conditions. At a dinner with his cousins, he tries to explain the topics that Pete taught him about, but he is shut down. Upset, he renounces his faith and strives to see Pete again. He goes hitchhiking to reunite with Pete, who tells him to invite his friends to a group that he is creating. Jay ends up grounded by his parents. At school, Jay tries to explain Pete&#x27;s teachings to Brad and Dell, who laugh at him.

Jay becomes hypnotized by Pete&#x27;s teachings, but decides that he needs to get his life together, beginning with getting a job. Jay&#x27;s dad gives him a job at a stationery store, but Jay feels bored of his life. Jay, Brad, and Dell are eventually roped in by missionaries sent by Pete, who gives them a list of kids to try to bring into the cult. Jay begins to hang out with members of the cult, and has fun with them. Jay has many romantic interests throughout the story, particularly one with a girl named Janie, who spurns him after he refuses to go to a dance with her. 

Jay&#x27;s faith becomes conflicted with the introduction of Satanism. He eventually meets a girl named Tina, who becomes interested in him. They begin having liaisons, and Jay begins to fall in love with her. Tina brings him further and further into the Satanic lifestyle, where she encourages him to take drugs and participate in orgies, often with animals. When Jay decides to step away from the rituals and break up with Tina, she convinces him with witchcraft to stay with her.

The two of them decide to &quot;get married&quot; in a graveyard, where a kitten is strangled on the altar they use. After the wedding, Jay&#x27;s lifestyle becomes more reckless when he and Tina begin attacking cattle and bathing in blood to baptize themselves. Jay&#x27;s writing and poems begin to become more and more unhinged.

Eventually, Jay decides to participate in his school&#x27;s production of &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot;. Another student takes the role that Jay wanted, but then the student&#x27;s appendix bursts, leaving the role open. Jay suspects that Tina may have something to do with the incident, and eventually the two of them break up when one of Tina&#x27;s ex-boyfriends contact her, which leaves Jay heartbroken once more.

Eventually, Jay has visions of a demon named Raul and believes he has been possessed by Raul. Both Brad and Dell later die in car accidents, seemingly linked to the occult&#x27;s practices, and Jay becomes sick when he goes to their funerals.

When Jay&#x27;s little brother Chad becomes unnerved and tells Jay that he does not recognize him, Jay determines that he does not feel in control of his body. In one final attempt to save himself from Raul, he decides to contact the Bishop for an exorcism. He writes a note to his parents, requesting that all his possessions be given to Debbie as a wedding gift.

The story ends with an epilogue in the form of a letter written by Jay&#x27;s mom addressed to Janie. She writes that they found Jay dead, having killed himself from a gun shot to the head. Devastated, she reflects on his life and celebrates the sixteen-and-a-half years he lived.

==Response==
Some critics have challenged the authenticity of the story, noting that the editor of this book, Beatrice Sparks, has filled the same role on many other &quot;actual, anonymous diaries of teenagers&quot; that explore such sensational themes as drug addiction, teenage pregnancy, and prostitution. These books, the most well-known of which is &quot;Go Ask Alice&quot;, serve as cautionary tales.

According to a book written by Barrett&#x27;s brother Scott (&quot;A Place in the Sun: The Truth Behind Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot;) and interviews with the family, Sparks used 21 entries of 212 total from Barrett&#x27;s actual journal. The other entries were fictional, with Sparks claiming they were based on case histories from other teenagers Sparks worked with and interviews of friends and acquaintances of Barrett.

Within the city of Pleasant Grove, &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot; has been the source of many urban legends, including alleged locations where Jay performed actions described in the book, his home, the effect on his family after his death, and other rumors.

In 2004, a local Salt Lake City paper, City Weekly, ran a story containing interviews with the Barrett family and their friends. Apart from pointing out the book&#x27;s untruths, its authors assert that, ironically, the book &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot; actually inspired imitative acts of what readers took to be Satanic rituals.

Due to allegations of ritual cattle mutilation arising in &quot;Jay&#x27;s Journal&quot;, the book came to the attention of Royal Canadian Mounted Police officers investigating reports of killed and mutilated cows in Alberta.

==Adaptations==
A rock opera titled &quot;A Place in the Sun&quot; was created and performed in 1997 and 1998 by Utah band Grain, led by Bryan Hall. According to some of Alden&#x27;s family members, it was a more accurate portrayal and showed Sparks&#x27; alleged exploitation of the story. 

In 2022 and 2023, Hall and his band, Bay of Pigs, began live performances of another rock opera telling Alden Barrett&#x27;s story. It is called &quot;Pleasant Grove&quot; and was performed as a work-in-progress in Utah at the Springville Utah Rivoli theater in two runs during 2023. The band at the heart of its creation, Bay of Pigs, has plans to continue developing the project for other performances.

<doc id="244633" wikidata="Q223061" url="?curid=244633" title="Réaumur scale">
<text>The Réaumur scale (; °Ré, °Re, °r), also known as the &quot;octogesimal division&quot;, is a temperature scale for which the melting and boiling points of water are defined as 0 and 80 degrees respectively. The scale is named for René Antoine Ferchault de Réaumur, who first proposed a similar scale in 1730.

== Change in scale ==
Réaumur&#x27;s thermometer contained diluted alcohol (ethanol) and was constructed on the principle of using 0° for the melting temperature of water, and graduating the tube into degrees, each of which was one-thousandth of the volume contained by the bulb and tube up to the zero mark. He suggested that the concentration of alcohol employed be such that it began boiling at 80 °Ré – that is, when it had expanded in volume by 8%. He chose alcohol instead of mercury because it expands more visibly, but this posed problems: his original thermometers were very bulky, and the low boiling point of alcohol made them unsuitable for many applications. Instrument-makers generally chose different liquids, and then used 80 °Ré to signify the boiling point of water, causing much confusion. 

During 1772 Jean-André Deluc studied the several substances then used in thermometers and concluded that mercury thermometers were the best for practical use, on the grounds that among these substances its volume varies the most linearly with the method of mixtures. In detail, if two portions of water of equal masses A, B were mixed, and let the resulting water be C, and if we immerse a thermometer in A, B, C, we obtain lengths formula_1. Deluc expected that formula_2, and similarly for other ratios of mixtures. He found that thermometers made using mercury allowed the closest fit to his expectation of linearity.

From the late 18th century mercury was used almost without exception.

== Use ==
The Réaumur scale was used widely in Europe, particularly in France, Germany and Russia, and was referenced in the works of Thomas Jefferson, Thomas Mann, Fyodor Dostoevsky, Gustave Flaubert, James Joyce, Leo Tolstoy, and Vladimir Nabokov. For example, in Query VII of &quot;Notes on the State of Virginia&quot;, Jefferson converts readings from the Fahrenheit thermometer at Williamsburg to the Réaumur scale. At the beginning of Book X of &quot;The Brothers Karamazov&quot;, the narrator says, &quot;We had eleven degrees of frost&quot;, i.e. −11 °Ré, equivalent to or . By the 1790s, France had chosen the Celsius scale as part of the metric system, rather than the Réaumur measurement, but the Réaumur scale continued to be used in some parts of Europe until at least the mid-19th century, and in parts of Russia until the early 20th. While living in Paris, George Orwell mentions &quot;translating Réaumur into Fahrenheit&quot; even in 1929. Its main modern uses are in some Italian and Swiss factories for measuring milk temperature during cheese production, and in the Netherlands for measuring temperature when cooking sugar syrup for desserts and sweets.

Uses outside of Europe include a Mexican colonel in Santa Anna&#x27;s army in San Antonio, Texas in 1836 recording the night&#x27;s temperature as and 1 °Ré.

== Conversion between different temperature units ==
 313.15 K = 40 °C = 104 °F = 563.67 °Ra = 28.5 °Ro = 13.2 °N = 90 °D = 32 ºRé

<doc id="244642" wikidata="Q714984" url="?curid=244642" title="Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture">
<text>The Yanbian Korean Autonomous Prefecture is an autonomous prefecture in the east of Jilin Province, China. Yanbian is bordered to the north by Heilongjiang Province, on the west by Jilin&#x27;s Baishan City and Jilin City, on the south by North Korea&#x27;s North Hamgyong Province and on the east by Primorsky Krai in Russia. Yanbian is designated as a Korean autonomous prefecture due to the large number of Chaoxianzu living in the region. The prefectural capital is Yanji and the total area is .

The prefecture has an important Balhae archaeological site: the Ancient Tombs at Longtou Mountain, which includes the Mausoleum of Princess Jeonghyo.

==History==
In the Ming dynasty, Yanbian was governed by the Jianzhou Guard () and in the late Qing dynasty the area was divided into the Yanji () and Hunchun () subprefectures. From 1644 to 1800s, the Manchurian Qing state maintained a policy of disallowing Han Chinese immigration into traditionally Manchurian lands in order to ensure that the Manchu were not assimilated by the Han Chinese. However, this effort failed because of the trading and agricultural opportunities available to Han Chinese migrants in the northeast region which made it profitable to evade the rules, as well as later Qing relaxation of the same rules (Chuang Guandong) to discourage Russian encroachment. Thus, in the 19th century, Chinese immigrants migrated en masse from China proper to areas that were formerly off limits to Han Chinese migration.

In the late 19th century, Korean immigrants migrated en masse from the Korean Peninsula to China. After the foundation of the Republic of China, a second wave arrived. Of the 2 million ethnic Koreans in Manchuria at the time of the communist takeover, 1.2 million remained in the region after the end of World War II. Many participated in the Chinese Civil War, most on the side of the Chinese communists. When the civil war was over, the new Chinese government gave these Koreans their own autonomous region () in 1952. Yanbian was upgraded to an ethnic autonomous prefecture in 1955. During the Cultural Revolution, ethnic Koreans were killed and persecuted in Yanbian.

Korean (Joseon) migration into Northeast China began in significant numbers in the last quarter of the 19th century and was mainly motivated by economic hardship on the Korean side of the border. After the Japanese annexed Korea in 1910, a small but significant number of migrants also came to Manchuria for political reasons.

In 1952, the Korean migrants comprised some 60% of the local population, but by 2000 that was down to 32%. The Chinese authorities subsidize Korean language schools and publications, but also take measures to prevent an emergence of Korean irredentism in the area. From the late 1990s, the Chaoxianzu have assimilated into mainstream Chinese culture with increasing speed, often switching to daily use of Chinese and choosing to attend Chinese-language schools.

<text>The Imperial Service College (ISC) was an English independent school based in Windsor, originally known as St. Mark&#x27;s School when it was founded in 1845.

In 1906, St Mark’s School absorbed boys from the former United Services College, which had failed. In 1911, St Mark’s was also in difficulties, and after securing support from the Imperial Service College Trust it was renamed as Imperial Service College, St Mark’s. On the death of Lord Kitchener in 1916, Prince Alexander of Teck, soon to become Alexander Cambridge, 1st Earl of Athlone, launched a public appeal for a permanent endowment of the school in Kitchener’s memory. He noted that the Imperial Service College had been founded “for the purpose of providing a public school education for the Sons of Officers of limited means belonging to the Navy, Army, and Higher Civil Services.”

In 1942, the school merged with Haileybury to form Haileybury and Imperial Service College.

During the 1950s, part of the site was the home of the Royal Horse Guards Light Aid Detachment Royal Electrical and Mechanical Engineers (LAD REME RHG), while the school’s Kipling Memorial Building (1939) was occupied by the Royal Borough of New Windsor Council.

The area is now being redeveloped as offices.

<doc id="244648" wikidata="Q3750" url="?curid=244648" title="Gera">
<text>Gera is a city in the German state of Thuringia. With around 93,000 inhabitants, it is the third-largest city in Thuringia after Erfurt and Jena as well as the easternmost city of the &quot;Thüringer Städtekette&quot;, an almost straight string of cities consisting of the six largest Thuringian cities from Eisenach in the west, via Gotha, Erfurt, Weimar and Jena to Gera in the east. Gera is the largest city in the Vogtland, and one of its historical capitals along with Plauen, Greiz and Weida. The city lies in the East Thuringian Hill Country, in the wide valley of the White Elster, between Greiz (upstream) and Leipzig (downstream). Gera is located in the Central German Metropolitan Region, approximately south of Saxony&#x27;s largest city of Leipzig, east of Thuringia&#x27;s capital Erfurt, west of Saxony&#x27;s capital Dresden and 90 km (56 miles) north of Bavaria&#x27;s city of Hof (Saale).

First mentioned in 995 and developing into a city during the 13th century, Gera has historical significance as being one of the main residences of the Ducal House of Reuss and subsequently the capital of the Principality of Reuss-Gera (1848-1918) and of the People&#x27;s State of Reuss (1918-1920), one of the many microstates the Thuringian region consisted of, before they were unified to form Thuringia in 1920.

Over the 19th century, Gera became a centre of the textile industry and saw a period of rapid growth. In 1952, the city also became an administrative centre in GDR as one of the capitals of Gera administrative district (Bezirk). In 1990, Gera became part of re-established Thuringia. The loss of its administrative functions as well as its industrial core (caused both by structural change among the European textile industry and the economic system change after the German reunification) precipitated the city&#x27;s slide into an enduring economic crisis.

Since 1990, many of Gera&#x27;s buildings have been restored and big urban planning programmes like the Bundesgartenschau 2007 were implemented to stimulate Gera&#x27;s economy. Sights include some retained buildings of the royal residence epoque and many public and private buildings from the economic heyday between 1870 and 1930. The famous painter Otto Dix was born in Gera in 1891.

==History==
=== Middle Ages ===
The place name &quot;Gera&quot; originally referred to the area of the Elster river valley where the city stands now. The first known documentary mention of Gera dates from 995.

In 999 Emperor Otto III assigned the &quot;province&quot; of Gera to the Quedlinburg Abbey. In turn, the church assigned the protectorship of this area in 1209 to the Vogts of Weida (in German: &quot;Vögte von Weida&quot;) who served as its administrators. The Vogts of Weida were the ancestors of the Reussians, who ruled Gera until 1918. Gera was first mentioned as a town in 1237, though it is unclear in which year Gera got the municipal law. The small town got circumvallated in the 13th century on an area of 350 x 350 m and the Vogts&#x27; city castle was built in the south-western corner at today&#x27;s Burgstraße. A municipal seal was first used in 1350, the council was first named in 1360 and the town hall was mentioned in 1426. The abbess of Quedlinburg remained the formal sovereign of Gera until 1358, as the Wettins followed her up. The Vogt&#x27;s couldn&#x27;t emancipate themselves from Wettin rule. In 1450, Gera was almost totally destroyed during the Saxon Fratricidal War, but it could recuperate quick because the starting textile manufacture brought wealth to the town.
=== Early modern period ===

The Reformation was introduced in Gera in 1533 against the will of the Vogts by the Wettins. After the Schmalkaldic War in 1546, the Wettins lost Gera to the Bohemian Crown, who however had no influence on the city, so that the Vogts resp. the Reussians (which arose from the Vogts in the mid-16th century) as indeed rulers were strengthened. During the 16th century, some cloth-makers from the Spanish Netherlands migrated to Gera as religious refugees at Count Henry&#x27;s invitation and raised the textile business in Gera. In the 18th century, there was a first peak in this industry (Putting-out system), which can be seen today at the large agents houses.

In 1673, the Reussians were raised to Imperial Counts which granted them full sovereignty within the Holy Roman Empire; Gera became their royal residence. In 1686 and 1780, big town fires destroyed most buildings in Gera. The town was rebuilt relatively uniform during the 1780s in late-Baroque style, which marks the inner city until today.

In 1806 Napoleon established his Imperial Headquarters at Gera during the War of the Fourth Coalition. From here, on October 12, 1806, the French Emperor purposely sent an arrogant and threatening letter to King Frederick William III of Prussia – a letter that enticed Prussia to war and a crushing defeat at the Battle of Jena a few days later.

=== Since 1815 ===

The Gera line of Reussians died out in 1802, so that it had no royal resident until the new one moved there from Schleiz in 1848. From 1848 to 1918 Gera served as the capital of the Principality of Reuss-Gera. With the industrial revolution in the mid-19th century, Gera grew rapidly, due largely to its textile industry, which saw the first Power loom installed in 1836. In 1859, Gera was first connected by railway to Halle via Zeitz and Weißenfels. During the following decades, rail lines in all directions made Gera to a transport hub, and the town kept growing. The second electric tram in Germany was installed in Gera in 1892.

After World War I, during the German Revolution of 1918–19, the prince of Reuss was forced to abdicate and as the resultant &quot;Republic of Reuss&quot; joined the newly founded state of Thuringia in 1920. After the incorporation of some suburbs in the 1910s and 1920s Gera, with some 80,000 inhabitants, was the largest city in Thuringia, although the more centrally located Weimar became its capital.

After the Nazi takeover of Germany, the Jewish community of Gera was destroyed, the synagogue burnt down in the Kristallnacht in 1938 and the city&#x27;s Jews emigrated or were murdered in concentration camps. A month before the end of World War II, on 6 April 1945, U.S. bombing destroyed parts of the city and killed 514 residents. Some 300 buildings were hit, including the Osterstein castle and several historic buildings in city centre, many of which weren&#x27;t rebuilt after the war, so in present day nearly half of Geras buildings date back to before World War II. U.S. forces occupied Gera on 14 April 1945 but were replaced by the Soviets on 1 July 1945.

Gera became part of the GDR in 1949 and was a flash point in the Uprising of 1953 in East Germany as thousands of workers – among them many employees of the Soviet-established Wismut uranium mining entity in the nearby Ore Mountains (&quot;Erzgebirge&quot;) – demanded higher wages and free elections. The demonstrations were put down by Soviet military forces, including armored units.

With governmental reorganization in East Germany, the city became the capital of the newly created District of Gera in 1952. The population rose during the GDR period, and massive &quot;Plattenbau&quot; prefabricated apartment blocks, built throughout East Germany, were constructed in Gera.

After German reunification in 1990, Gera became part of the restored state of Thuringia. However, Gera lost most of its administrative functions after reunification, and nearly all the city&#x27;s factories were closed. This led to a continuing economic crisis with significant unemployment, and the city&#x27;s population declined from 135,000 in 1990 to less than 100,000 a decade later.

The city hosted the Bundesgartenschau (federal horticultural exhibition) in 2007.

== Geography and demographics ==
=== Topography ===
Gera is located in a smooth-hilly landscape in eastern Thuringia at the White Elster river (progression: ), between the Thuringian Highland approx. in the south-west, the Ore Mountains approx. in the south-east and the Leipzig Bay approx. in the north. The municipal territory is marked by the Elster valley, crossing it in south-northern direction. West of the valley, the landscape is more hilly and forested (with the Gera Municipal Forest), whereas the eastern parts are more flat and in agricultural use. The elevation is between 180 metres (the level of the White Elster river) and (when measured at Gera-Falka at the furthest southeastern point). Usually the height above sea level for the city appears as when measured at the market place.

Small tributaries of the White Elster river within the borders of Gera are the &quot;Erlbach&quot; on the western side and the &quot;Wipsenbach&quot;, &quot;Gessenbach&quot; and &quot;Brahme&quot; on the eastern side.

=== Climate ===
Gera has a humid continental climate (Dfb) or an oceanic climate (&quot;Cfb&quot;) according to the Köppen climate classification system. Summers are warm and sometimes humid, winters are relatively cold. The city&#x27;s topography creates a microclimate caused through the basin position with sometimes inversion in winter (quite cold nights under ) and heat and inadequate air circulation in summer. Annual precipitation is only with moderate rainfall throughout the year. Light snowfall mainly occurs from December through February, but snow cover does not usually remain for long.

=== Administrative division ===

Gera abuts the following municipalities: 
* in the Burgenlandkreis district in the north: Wetterzeube and Gutenborn in the federal state of Saxony-Anhalt
* in the Greiz district in the east: Pölzig, Hirschfeld, Brahmenau, Schwaara, Korbußen, Ronneburg, Kauern, Hilbersdorf and Linda; in the south: Endschütz, Wünschendorf, Zedlitz and Hundhaupten; in the west: Saara, Kraftsdorf, Hartmannsdorf and Bad Köstritz
* in the Saale-Holzland district: Silbitz in the north-west.

The main urban quarters are the city centre, Untermhaus (incorporated 1919) in the west, Langenberg (1950), Tinz (1919) and Bieblach (1905) in the north, Leumnitz (1919) in the east, Pforten (1919) and Zwötzen (1919) in the south-east as well as Debschwitz (1912) and Lusan (1919) in the south-west.

=== Demographics ===

For centuries, Gera was a small town of about 2,000 inhabitants. As the textile business saw a first peak, the population rose to 7,000 in 1800 and further to 17,000 after the early stage of industrialisation in 1870. Gera&#x27;s heyday between 1870 and 1930 led to a demographic boom with a population of 83,000 at the end of this phase in 1930. In 1950, Gera had 98,000 inhabitants and the all-time peak was reached in 1988 with a population of 135,000. After the German reunification in 1990, the city saw a significant decline in population, despite the large incorporations of 1994. The population shrunk to 113,000 in 2000 and 95,000 in 2012.

The average decrease of population between 2009 and 2012 was approximately 0.55% p. a, whereas the population in bordering rural regions is shrinking with accelerating tendency. Suburbanization played only a small role in Gera. It occurred after the reunification for a short time in the 1990s, but most of the suburban areas were situated within the administrative city borders. During the 1990s and the 2000s, many inhabitants left Gera to search a better life in west Germany or other major east German cities like Jena or Leipzig. Since 2010, emigration is no big issue anymore. Now, the birth deficit, caused by the high average age of the population, is getting a bigger problem because the immigration isn&#x27;t sufficient to compensate it yet. Despite urban planning activities to tear down unused flats, vacancy is still a problem with rates around 12% (according to 2011 EU census). A positive side effect for the inhabitants is that Gera has one of the lowest rent levels in Germany.

The birth deficit was 715 in 2012, this is -7.5 per 1,000 inhabitants (Thuringian average: -4.5; national average: -2.4). The net migration rate was +3.6 per 1,000 inhabitants in 2012 (Thuringian average: -0.8; national average: +4.6). The most important regions of origin of Gera migrants are bordering rural areas of Thuringia, Saxony-Anhalt and Saxony as well as foreign countries like Poland, Russia, Ukraine, Hungary, Serbia, Romania and Bulgaria.

Like other eastern German cities, Gera has only a small foreign population: circa 1.6% are non-Germans by citizenship and overall 5.0% are migrants (according to 2011 EU census). Differing from the national average, the biggest groups of migrants in Gera are Russians, Vietnamese people and Ukrainians. During recent years, the economic situation of the city improved a bit: the unemployment rate declined from 22% in 2005 to 11% in 2013, which is still the highest one out of all Thuringian districts. Due to the official atheism in former GDR, most of the population is non-religious. In 2011, 9.8% were members of the Evangelical Church in Central Germany and 2.6% were Catholics, giving Gera one of the lowest shares of religious people in the Western world.

== Culture, sights and cityscape ==

=== Museums ===
There are some museums in Gera:
* The &quot;Orangerie&quot; at Orangerieplatz hosts an exhibition of art from the Middle Ages to the contemporary period. 
* The &quot;Otto-Dix-Haus&quot; (“Otto Dix House”) at Mohrenplatz 4, birthplace and childhood home of the famous artist Otto Dix, has a collection of his drawings, prints, paintings and childhood sketch books, and an exhibition about his life. 
* The &quot;Museum für Angewandte Kunst&quot; (Museum for Applied Arts) at Greizer Straße shows 20th century contemporary art (inside &quot;Ferber House&quot;). It displays collections of Bauhaus ceramics by the artists Otto Lindig und Theodor Bogler; architectural works of Thilo Schoder; and photographs by Aenne Biermann.
* The &quot;Museum für Naturkunde&quot; (Natural History Museum) at Nicolaiberg hosts a natural history exhibition (inside the &quot;Schreiber House&quot;, the oldest building in the city), with its adjacent botanical garden, the Botanischer Garten Gera
* The &quot;Stadtmuseum&quot; (city museum) at Museumsplatz shows an exhibition of Gera&#x27;s municipal history.
* The &quot;Haus Schulenburg&quot; (Schulenburg House) at Straße des Friedens is a factory owner&#x27;s mansion, built in 1913/14 by the famous architect Henry van de Velde. It hosts topical furniture and decoration and can be visited.

=== Cityscape ===
Like its western neighbour-city Jena, Gera is a protracted city along a wide valley in south-northern direction. The historic city centre is quite small and located between Sorge in the north, Nicolaistraße in the east, Stadtgraben in the south and Reichsstraße in the west. It survived World War II, but during the 1960s and 1970s, the GDR government demolished larger inner-city areas to rebuild them with modern concrete architecture, which marks the view of Gera&#x27;s centre, particularly in the north-west until today. Between 1870 and 1930, the city was largely extended in all directions. As distinct from other German cities, there is no citywide spatial separation between the worker&#x27;s quarters and the upper-class mansion districts, instead, the mansions and the tenements are situated near to each other, spread over all the districts. The hilly areas and those next to the river and the parks are more upscale, whereas the areas next to the railway and the factories are more working-class styled. Nevertheless, the &quot;Gründerzeit&quot; architecture is quite diverse and interesting in Gera. Most buildings were extensively refurbished after 1990. Especially Gera&#x27;s mansion architecture from the 1900s and 1910s is unique. The 1920s brought some modern-style &quot;Bauhaus&quot; buildings to the then rich city. During the GDR period, urban growth was handled by establishing big &quot;Plattenbau&quot; settlements on the city&#x27;s periphery, like the Lusan district in south and the Bieblach district in north. Overall nearly half of Geras buildings date back to World War II.

==== Other sights ====
* The &quot;town hall&quot; at Marktplatz (market square) is one of the biggest Renaissance town halls in Germany with a nearly 60 m high tower, built between 1573 and 1576. The Marktplatz itself forms a good ensemble of 18th century patricians houses in late-Baroque style.
* The &quot;Stadttheater&quot; (city theatre) at Küchengartenallee is the former royal Reussian theatre, built in 1902 by Heinrich Seeling in neo-Baroque style. 
* The &quot;Stadtapotheke&quot; (city pharmacy) is a Renaissance building at Marktplatz with a beautiful bay, established in 1592. 
* The &quot;Küchengarten&quot; (literally “Kitchen Garden”) with the &quot;Orangerie&quot; is a park ensemble west of the city centre, established in 1732 by the Reussians. 
* The &quot;Höhler&quot; is a cellar system under the city centre with a length of approx. , established in 17th and 18th century for storing beer. A part can be visited via an entrance at Nicolaiberg 3.

== Economy and infrastructure ==

=== Basic economic data ===
In 2022, 22544 people were employed full-time in Gera with a median salary of EUR 2,595.34. The median wage in Gera is 10% lower compared to eastern Germany.

=== Agriculture, industry and services ===

Agriculture has some importance in the rural districts of Gera, especially in the northern and eastern city parts. Approximately 57% of the municipal territory is in agricultural use: growing maize, rapeseed and crops as well as pasturing cattle.

The city&#x27;s economy features industrial machinery (Dagro Gera GmbH), communications (DTKS GmbH, Deutsche Telekom), security locks (Schloßsicherungen Gera GmbH), optics (POG Präzisionsoptik Gera GmbH), electrical equipment (Electronicon Kondensatoren GmbH), and margarine manufacturing (Othüna). Other companies include a compressor manufacturer (Kompressorenwerk Kaeser), a precision-tool maker (SMK-Präzisionsmechanik), and a subsidiary of the construction company Max Bögl. The e-commerce service-provider D+S Europe has a service centre in Gera with several hundred workers, and Rittal, a manufacturer of information-technology enclosures, moved from Bad Köstritz to Gera. Some industrial branches operating before 1990 no longer have major importance. Sectors either no longer existing or sharply reduced include those in toolmaking (VEB Wema Union), textiles (VEB Modedruck), textile machinery (VEB Textima), electronic equipment (VEB Elektronik Gera). Other industries that had a presence included VEB Carl Zeiss Jena and a brewery. One important industrial branch had been uranium-ore mining in nearby Ronneburg (Wismut), whereby the region became the Soviet Union&#x27;s leading uranium supplier. In 2012 Gera had 41 companies with more than 20 workers in the industrial sector, employing 3,400 people and generating an overall turnover of €452 million.

Gera is a supra-centre according to the Central Place Theory in German regional planning. This makes the city a regional centre for retailing, with three major shopping centres: &quot;Gera-Arcaden&quot;, &quot;Amthor-Passage&quot; and &quot;Elster-Forum&quot;. Health services are important, with one of the biggest hospitals in Thuringia, the SRH Waldklinikum. Nevertheless, Gera&#x27;s economy is weak compared to equal-sized neighbouring cities like Jena or Zwickau. While Jena counts 51,000 and Zwickau 50,000 jobs liable to pay into the German social insurance, Gera had only 35,000 of those full-time jobs in 2012. The commuter balance was +14,000 in Jena and +16,000 in Zwickau, but only +2,000 in Gera, which is one of the lowest ratios among German supra-centres, highlighting the lack of ability of Gera to provide jobs for the region. The unemployment rate reached 11.2% in September 2013 - the highest among all Thuringian districts.

=== Transport ===

==== By rail ====

Since the late 19th century, Gera has been a hub in the railway network. The first railway ran to the Thuringian Railway in Weißenfels (with connection to Halle) via Zeitz in 1859. Further main lines were opened to Gößnitz (with connection to Chemnitz) in 1865, to Saalfeld in 1871, to Leipzig (via Zeitz) in 1873, to Plauen in 1875, to Weimar (with connection to Erfurt) via Jena in 1876 and to Hof in 1883. The secondary railways to Werdau (opened in 1876) and Meuselwitz (opened via Pölzig in 1901 and via Lumpzig in 1887) are abandoned. Nevertheless, none of these lines are electrified or in use for long-distance trains. Today, there are regional express trains to Göttingen via Jena and Erfurt, to Leipzig via Zeitz, to Altenburg, Glauchau and Zwickau via the Gößnitz line, to Greiz, to Hof and to Saalfeld. Local trains provide connections to Weimar via Jena, Leipzig, Weischlitz (near Plauen), Hof and Saalfeld. The most lines run every two hours, so that there is hourly service (express and local trains in alternation) to most directions. The electrification of the west-eastern mainline Weimar – Jena – Gera – Gößnitz is in discussion for closing that gap in the network and enable Gera&#x27;s connection to long-distance trains, which can be reached today either via Jena or via Leipzig.

The most important stations in Gera are the &quot;Gera main station&quot; (former Prussian station), where all the trains stop, and the &quot;Gera southern station&quot; (former Saxonian station), where all the trains, except the local ones to Weimar, stop. More stations in Gera are &quot;Langenberg&quot; at the Leipzig line, &quot;Zwötzen&quot; at the Saalfeld and Hof line as well as &quot;Gera Ost&quot; and &quot;Liebschwitz&quot; at the Plauen line. Freight transport by rail is immaterial in Gera since the 1990s.

==== By road ====
The two Autobahnen crossing each other nearby at &quot;Hermsdorf junction&quot; are the Bundesautobahn 4 (Frankfurt–Dresden) and the Bundesautobahn 9 (Berlin–Munich), which were both built during the 1930s. Furthermore, there are three Bundesstraßen connecting Gera: the Bundesstraße 2 to Zeitz in the north and Hof in the south, the Bundesstraße 7 to Jena (via Eisenberg) in the west and to Altenburg in the east and the Bundesstraße 92 to Plauen (via Greiz) in the south. Important secondary roads run to Altenburg (via Lumpzig), to Werdau (via Linda), to Wünschendorf, to Stadtroda and to Hermsdorf. As part of the Bundesgartenschau 2007, a new bypass road was built in the east to improve the connection of southern city parts to the A 4 and to relieve the city centre from transit traffic.

==== By aviation ====
The closest regional airports are the Leipzig/Halle Airport, about north and the Erfurt-Weimar Airport, about west of Gera. Both serve mainly holiday flights. The nearest major airports are the Frankfurt Airport, the Munich Airport and the Berlin Brandenburg Airport. In the eastern part of Gera lies the airfield Gera-Leumnitz meant for private aviation.

==== By bike ====
Cycling is becoming more popular since the construction of quality cycle tracks began in the 1990s. For tourists, there are the &quot;Weiße Elster track&quot; and the &quot;Thuringian city string track (Radweg Thüringer Städtekette)&quot;. Both connect points of tourist interest, the first along the White Elster valley from the Elster Mountains at the Czech border to Saale river in Halle and second from Eisenach via Erfurt, Weimar, Jena and Gera to Altenburg. For inner city every-day traffic, some cycle lanes exist along several main streets.

==== Trams and buses ====

The Gera tram network was the second in Germany that launched electrical engines in 1892. Today, there are two long lines, one from Bieblach via city centre to Lusan (line 3) and another one – opened in 2006 – from Untermhaus via city centre to Zwötzen (line 1). The third short line is a connection between Lusan and the Zwötzen railway station (line 2). Another line is planned to connect Langenberg and the northern city parts. On line 3 is one course every 5 minutes, on line 1 every 10 minutes and on line 2 every 20 minutes.

The bus network connects districts without trams as well as neighbouring municipalities that do not have a rail connection.
=== Education ===

Tertiary institutions are the private college &quot;SRH Fachhochschule für Gesundheit Gera&quot; (university of applied sciences for health) with 500 students and the Gera branch of the Duale Hochschule Gera-Eisenach (cooperative state college) with 850 students locally.

Furthermore, there are four Gymnasiums, all of them are state-owned. The Goethe-Gymnasium/Rutheneum seit 1608 (“since 1608”) focuses on music education as an elite boarding school, in addition to the common curriculum.

==Politics==

The first freely elected mayor after German reunification was independent Ralf Rauch, who served from 1994 to 2006. He was succeeded by Norbert Vornehm of the Social Democratic Party (SPD), who served from 2006 to 2012. Viola Hahn was elected in 2012, but was defeated seeking re-election in 2018, failing to progress to the second round. Julian Vonarb served from 2018 to 2024 when he was also defeated seeking re-election, succeeded by Kurt Dannenberg (CDU). The most recent mayoral election was held on 26 May 2024, with a runoff held on 9 June, and the results were as follows:
