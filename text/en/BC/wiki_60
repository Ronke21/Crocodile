<text>Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr. (April 20, 1951 – July 1, 2005) was an American soul and R&amp;B singer, songwriter, and record producer. Over his career, he achieved eleven consecutive RIAA-certified platinum albums and sold over 40 million records worldwide. Known as the &quot;Velvet Voice&quot;, Vandross was recognized by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as one of the 200 greatest singers of all time (2023) and was named one of the greatest R&amp;B artists by &quot;Billboard&quot;. NPR also included him among its 50 Great Voices. He won eight Grammy Awards, including Song of the Year in 2004 for &quot;Dance with My Father&quot;. He has been inducted into both the National Rhythm &amp; Blues Hall of Fame and the Grammy Hall of Fame.

Vandross began his career as a backing vocalist in the 1970s, contributing to albums by Roberta Flack, Donny Hathaway, Todd Rundgren, Evelyn &quot;Champagne&quot; King, Judy Collins, Chaka Khan, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, David Bowie, Ben E. King, Stevie Wonder, and Donna Summer. He later became the lead singer of the group Change, which released the Gold-certified album, &quot;The Glow of Love&quot;, in 1980 on Warner/RFC Records.

After Vandross left the group, he was signed to Epic Records as a solo artist and released his debut solo album, &quot;Never Too Much&quot;, in 1981. The following year, he was credited as the primary producer on Aretha Franklin&#x27;s album &quot;Jump to it&quot;, which topped the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B Albums chart. His hit songs include &quot;Never Too Much&quot;, &quot;Here and Now&quot;, &quot;Any Love&quot;, &quot;Power of Love/Love Power&quot;, &quot;I Can Make It Better&quot;, and &quot;For You to Love&quot;. He also recorded several covers of songs originally performed by other artists, including &quot;Since I Lost My Baby&quot;, &quot;Superstar&quot;, &quot;I (Who Have Nothing)&quot;, and &quot;Always and Forever&quot;.

Vandross collaborated on several notable duets, including &quot;The Closer I Get to You&quot; with Beyoncé, &quot;Endless Love&quot; with Mariah Carey, and &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot; with Janet Jackson of which the latter two were hit songs in his career. The tribute album &quot;So Amazing: An All-Star Tribute to Luther Vandross&quot; was released shortly after his death. In 2024, Kendrick Lamar and SZA released the chart-topping single &quot;Luther&quot;, paying homage to Vandross and sampling his rendition of &quot;If This World Were Mine&quot;, a duet with Cheryl Lynn. That same year, he was the subject of the documentary &quot;&quot;, which chronicles his life, career, and legacy.

== Early life ==
Luther Ronzoni Vandross Jr. was born on April 20, 1951, at Bellevue Hospital, in the Kips Bay neighborhood of Manhattan, New York City. His birth occurred concurrently with General Douglas MacArthur&#x27;s ticker-tape parade throughout the same city. He was the fourth and youngest child (Anthony, Patricia, Ann) as well as the second son of Mary Ida Vandross and Luther Vandross Sr. His father was an upholsterer and singer, and his mother was a nurse. Vandross was raised in Manhattan&#x27;s Lower East Side in the Alfred E. Smith Houses public housing development. At the age of three, having his own phonograph, Vandross taught himself to play the piano by ear.

His father died of diabetes when Vandross was eight years old. In 2003, Vandross wrote the song &quot;Dance with My Father&quot; and dedicated it to him; the title was based on his childhood memories and his mother&#x27;s recollections of the family singing and dancing in the house. His family moved to the Bronx when he was nine. His sisters, Patricia &quot;Pat&quot; and Ann, began taking Vandross to the Apollo Theater and to a theater in Brooklyn to see Dionne Warwick and Aretha Franklin perform. Patricia sang with the vocal group The Crests and was featured on the songs &quot;My Juanita&quot; and &quot;Sweetest One&quot;.

Vandross graduated from William Howard Taft High School in the Bronx in 1969, and attended Western Michigan University for one and a half semesters before dropping out to continue pursuing a career in music.

== Career ==
While in high school, Vandross founded the first Patti LaBelle fan club, of which he was president. He also performed in a group, Shades of Jade, that once played at the Apollo Theater. During his early years in show business, he appeared several times at the Apollo&#x27;s famous amateur night. While he was a member of a theater workshop, Listen My Brother, he was involved in the singles &quot;Only Love Can Make a Better World&quot; and &quot;Listen My Brother&quot;. The group performed in front of tens of thousands at the Harlem Cultural Festival in late August 1969. Directly afterward, he appeared with the group in the pilot episode and other episodes of the first season of &quot;Sesame Street&quot; during 1969–1970.

=== 1970s: Backing vocalist and first groups ===
Vandross added backing vocals to &quot;Roberta Flack &amp; Donny Hathaway&quot; in 1972, and worked on Delores Hall&#x27;s &quot;Hall-Mark&quot; album (1973). He sang with her on the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Gonna Make It Easier for Me&quot;, which he wrote, and he contributed another song, &quot;In This Lonely Hour&quot;. After his song &quot;Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)&quot; was re-written as &quot;Fascination&quot; with David Bowie for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Young Americans&quot; (1975) album, Vandross went on to tour with him as a backing vocalist in September 1974. Vandross wrote &quot;Everybody Rejoice/A Brand New Day&quot; for the 1975 Broadway musical &quot;The Wiz&quot;.

Vandross also sang backing vocals for artists, including Roberta Flack, Chaka Khan, Ben E. King, Bette Midler, Diana Ross, Carly Simon, Barbra Streisand, David Bowie, Cat Stevens, Gary Glitter, Ringo Starr, Sister Sledge, and Donna Summer, and for the bands Mandrill, Chic and Todd Rundgren&#x27;s Utopia.

Before his solo breakthrough, Vandross was part of a singing quintet named Luther in the late 1970s. The quintet consisted of former Shades of Jade members Anthony Hinton and Diane Sumler, as well as Theresa V. Reed, and Christine Wiltshire, signed to Cotillion Records. Although the singles &quot;It&#x27;s Good for the Soul&quot;, &quot;Funky Music (Is a Part of Me)&quot;, and &quot;The Second Time Around&quot; were relatively successful, their two albums, the self-titled &quot;Luther&quot; (1976) and &quot;This Close to You&quot; (1977), which Vandross produced, did not sell enough to make the charts. Vandross bought back the rights to those albums after Cotillion dropped the group, preventing them from being re-released. Both albums were re-released in 2024.

Vandross also wrote and sang commercial jingles from 1977 until the early 1980s, for companies including NBC, Mountain Dew, Kentucky Fried Chicken, Burger King, and Juicy Fruit. He continued his successful career as a popular session singer during the late 1970s. His aforementioned song &quot;Everybody Rejoice&quot;, sometimes called &quot;A Brand New Day&quot;, was used in a Kodak commercial during the mid-1970s.

In 1978, Vandross sang lead vocals for Gregg Diamond&#x27;s disco band, Bionic Boogie, on the song titled &quot;Hot Butterfly&quot;. Also in 1978, he appeared on Quincy Jones&#x27;s &quot;Sounds...and Stuff Like That!!&quot;, most notably on the song &quot;I&#x27;m Gonna Miss You in the Morning&quot; along with Patti Austin. Vandross also sang with the band Soirée and was the lead vocalist on the track &quot;You Are the Sunshine of My Life&quot;; he also contributed background vocals to the album along with Jocelyn Brown and Sharon Redd, each of whom also saw solo success. Additionally, he sang the lead vocals on the group Mascara&#x27;s LP title song &quot;See You in L.A.&quot; released in 1979. Vandross also appeared on the group Charme&#x27;s 1979 album &quot;Let It In&quot;.

=== 1980s: Change and solo breakthrough ===

Vandross made his career breakthrough as a featured singer with the vaunted pop-dance act Change, a studio concept created by French-Italian businessman Jacques Fred Petrus. Their 1980 hits, &quot;The Glow of Love&quot; (by Romani, Malavasi and Garfield) and &quot;Searching&quot; (by Malavasi), featured Vandross as the lead singer. In a 2001 interview with &quot;Vibe&quot;, Vandross said &quot;The Glow of Love&quot; was &quot;the most beautiful song I&#x27;ve ever sung in my life.&quot; Both songs were from Change&#x27;s debut album, &quot;The Glow of Love&quot;.

Vandross was originally intended to perform on their second and highly successful album &quot;Miracles&quot; in 1981, but declined the offer as Petrus didn&#x27;t pay enough money. Vandross&#x27;s decision led to a recording contract with Epic Records that same year, but he also provided background vocals on &quot;Miracles&quot; and on the new Petrus-created act, the B. B. &amp; Q. Band in 1981. During that year, Vandross jump-started his second attempt at a solo career with his debut album, &quot;Never Too Much&quot;. In addition to the hit title track it contained a version of the Bacharach &amp; David song &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;.

The song &quot;Never Too Much&quot;, written by Vandross, reached number-one on the R&amp;B charts. This period also marked the beginning of a songwriting collaboration with bassist Marcus Miller, who played on many of the tracks and would also produce or co-produce a number of tracks for Vandross. The &quot;Never Too Much&quot; album was arranged by Vandross&#x27;s high school classmate, Nat Adderley Jr., a collaboration that would last throughout Vandross&#x27;s career.

Vandross released a series of successful R&amp;B albums during the 1980s and continued his session work with guest vocals on groups like Charme in 1982. Many of his earlier albums made a bigger impact on the R&amp;B charts than on the pop charts. During the 1980s, two of Vandross&#x27;s singles reached No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B charts: &quot;Stop to Love&quot;, in 1986, and a duet with Gregory Hines, &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing Better Than Love.&quot; Vandross was at the helm as producer for Aretha Franklin&#x27;s Gold-certified, award-winning comeback album &quot;Jump to It&quot;. He also produced its follow-up album, 1983&#x27;s &quot;Get It Right&quot;.

In 1983, the opportunity to work with his main musical influence, Dionne Warwick, came about with Vandross producing, writing songs, and singing on &quot;How Many Times Can We Say Goodbye&quot;, her fourth album for Arista Records. The title track duet reached No. 27 on the Hot 100 chart (#7 R&amp;B/#4 Adult Contemporary), while the second single, &quot;Got a Date&quot; was a moderate hit (#45 R&amp;B/#15 Club Play).

Vandross wrote and produced &quot;It&#x27;s Hard for Me to Say&quot; for Diana Ross from her &quot;Red Hot Rhythm &amp; Blues&quot; album. Ross performed the song as an a cappella tribute to Oprah Winfrey on her final season of &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. She then proceeded to add it to her successful 2010–12 &quot;More Today Than Yesterday: The Greatest Hits Tour. Vandross also recorded a version of this song on his &quot;Your Secret Love&quot; album in 1996.
In 1985, Vandross first spotted the talent of Jimmy Salvemini, who was 15 at the time, on &quot;Star Search&quot;. He thought Salvemini had the perfect voice for some of his songs and contacted him. He was managed by his brother, Larry Salvemini. A contract was negotiated with Elektra Records for $250,000 and Vandross agreed to produce the album. He contacted his old friends – Cheryl Lynn, Alfa Anderson (of Chic), Phoebe Snow and Irene Cara – to appear on the record. Jimmy Salvemini&#x27;s album, &quot;Roll It&quot;, was released in 1986.

Vandross also sang the ad-libs and background vocals, along with Syreeta Wright and Philip Bailey, in Stevie Wonder&#x27;s 1985 hit &quot;Part-Time Lover&quot;. In 1984, he voiced a cartoon character named Zack for ABC&#x27;s &quot;Zack of All Trades&quot;, a three Saturday morning animated PSA spots. He sang as part of the background chorus on Bowie&#x27;s 1986 single &quot;Underground&quot;, from the movie &quot;Labyrinth&quot;.

The 1989 compilation album &quot;The Best of Luther Vandross... The Best of Love&quot; included the ballad &quot;Here and Now&quot;, his first single to chart in the Billboard pop chart top ten, peaking at number six.

=== 1990s ===
In 1990, Vandross wrote, produced and sang background for Whitney Houston in a song titled &quot;Who Do You Love&quot; which appeared on her album &quot;I&#x27;m Your Baby Tonight&quot;. That year, he guest starred on the television sitcom &quot;227&quot;.

More albums followed in the 1990s, beginning with 1991&#x27;s &quot;Power of Love&quot; which spawned two top ten pop hits. He won his first Grammy award for Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance in 1991. He won his second Best Male R&amp;B Vocal in the Grammy Awards of 1992, and his track &quot;Power of Love/Love Power&quot; won the Grammy Award for Best R&amp;B Song in the same year. In 1992, &quot;The Best Things in Life Are Free&quot;, a duet with Janet Jackson from the movie &quot;Mo&#x27; Money&quot; became a hit. In 1993, he had a brief non-speaking role in the Robert Townsend movie &quot;The Meteor Man&quot;. He played a hit man who plotted to stop Townsend&#x27;s title character.

Vandross hit the top ten again in 1994, teaming with Mariah Carey on a cover version of Lionel Richie and Diana Ross&#x27;s duet &quot;Endless Love&quot;. It was included on the album &quot;Songs&quot;, a collection of songs that had inspired Vandross over the years. He also appears on &quot;The Lady Is a Tramp&quot; released on Frank Sinatra&#x27;s &quot;Duets&quot; album. At the Grammy Awards of 1997, he won his third Best Male R&amp;B Vocal for the track &quot;Your Secret Love&quot;.

A second greatest hits album, released in 1997, compiled most of his 1990s hits and was his final album released through Epic Records. After releasing &quot;I Know&quot; on Virgin Records, he signed with J Records. His first album on Clive Davis&#x27;s new label, titled &quot;Luther Vandross&quot;, was released in 2001, and it produced the hits &quot;Take You Out&quot; (#7 R&amp;B/#26 Pop), and &quot;I&#x27;d Rather&quot; (#17 Adult Contemporary/#40 R&amp;B/#83 Pop). Vandross scored at least one top 10 R&amp;B hit every year from 1981 to 1994.

In 1997, Vandross sang the American national anthem, &quot;The Star-Spangled Banner&quot;, during Super Bowl XXXI at the Louisiana Superdome, New Orleans, Louisiana.

=== 2000s ===

He made two public appearances at Diana Ross&#x27;s Return to Love Tour: at its opening in Philadelphia at First Union Spectrum and its final stop at Madison Square Garden on July 6, 2000.

In September 2001, Vandross performed a rendition of Michael Jackson&#x27;s hit song &quot;Man in the Mirror&quot; at Jackson&#x27;s 30th Anniversary special, alongside Usher and 98 Degrees.

In the spring of 2003, Vandross&#x27;s last collaboration was Doc Powell&#x27;s song &quot;What&#x27;s Going On&quot;, a cover of Marvin Gaye&#x27;s seminal 1971 original, from Powell&#x27;s album &quot;97th and Columbus&quot;.

In 2003, Vandross released the album &quot;Dance with My Father&quot;. It sold 442,000 copies in the first week and debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart. The title track of the same name, which was dedicated to Vandross&#x27;s childhood memories of dancing with his father, won Vandross and his co-writer, Richard Marx, the 2004 Grammy Award for Song of the Year. The song also won Vandross his fourth and final award in the Best Male R&amp;B Vocal Performance category. The album was his only career No. 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; album chart. The video for the title track features various celebrities alongside their fathers and other family members. The second single released from the album, &quot;Think About You&quot;, was the number one Urban Adult Contemporary Song of 2004 according to &quot;Radio &amp; Records&quot;.

In 2003, after the televised NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball championship, CBS Sports gave &quot;One Shining Moment&quot; a new look. Vandross, who had been to only one basketball game in his life, was the new singer, and the video had none of the special effects, like glowing basketballs and star trails, that videos from previous years had. This song version is in use today.

=== Posthumous releases ===
J Records released a song in 2006, &quot;Shine&quot; – an upbeat R&amp;B track that samples Chic&#x27;s disco song &quot;My Forbidden Lover&quot; – which reached No. 31 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. The song was originally slated to be released on the soundtrack to the movie, &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot;, but it was shelved. A later remix of the song peaked at No. 10 on the Club Play chart. &quot;Shine&quot; and a track titled &quot;Got You Home&quot; were previously unreleased songs on &quot;The Ultimate Luther Vandross&quot; (2006), a greatest hits album on Epic Records/J Records/Legacy Recordings that was released August 22, 2006.

On October 16, 2007, Epic Records/J Records/Legacy Recordings released a 4-disc boxed set titled &quot;Love, Luther&quot;. It features nearly all of Vandross&#x27;s R&amp;B and pop hits throughout his career, as well as unreleased live tracks, alternate versions, and outtakes from sessions that Vandross recorded. The set also includes &quot;There&#x27;s Only You&quot;, a version of which had originally appeared on the soundtrack to the 1987 film &quot;Made in Heaven&quot;.

In October 2015, Sony Music released a re-configured edition of its &quot;The Essential Luther Vandross&quot; compilation containing three unreleased songs: &quot;Love It, Love It&quot; (which made its premiere a year prior on the UK compilation &quot;The Greatest Hits&quot;), a live recording of &quot;Bridge Over Troubled Water&quot; with Paul Simon and Jennifer Holliday, and a cover of Astrud Gilberto&#x27;s &quot;Look to the Rainbow&quot;.

== Personal life ==
Vandross never married and had no children. His mother outlived all of her four children, and his three elder siblings along with his father all predeceased him due to diabetes and asthma.

=== Sexual orientation ===
In 2006, Bruce Vilanch, a friend and colleague of Vandross, told &quot;Out&quot; magazine, &quot;He said to me, &#x27;No one knows I&#x27;m in the life.&#x27; ... He had very few sexual contacts&quot;. According to Vilanch, Vandross experienced his longest romantic relationship with a man while living in Los Angeles during the late 1980s and early 1990s. In December 2017, 12 years after his death, Vandross&#x27; friend Patti LaBelle confirmed that he was gay. In addition, Vandross was well aware that officially coming out as gay while he was actively making music would have been detrimental to the trajectory of his career, given the majority of his target audience were women seeking some mode of emotional engagement from his words. LaBelle said &quot;[Vandross] had a lot of lady fans&quot; and &quot;he just didn&#x27;t want to upset the world&quot;.

In December 1985, Vandross filed a libel suit against a British magazine after it attributed his 85-pound weight loss to AIDS. He weighed when he started a diet in May of that year.

=== 1986 car accident ===
After signing Jimmy Salvemini and having completed his debut album &quot;Roll It&quot;, Vandross, Salvemini, and Salvemini&#x27;s brother and manager Larry decided to celebrate. On January 12, 1986, they were riding in Vandross&#x27;s convertible on Laurel Canyon Boulevard, in the north section of Hollywood Hills in Los Angeles. Vandross was driving at 50 mph (80 km/h) in a 35 mph (56 km/h) zone when he veered across the double yellow center line of the two lane street, turned sideways and collided with the front of a southbound car, then swung around and hit another car head on. Vandross and Salvemini were rushed to the Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.

Larry Salvemini, who was in the passenger seat, was killed in the collision. Vandross suffered three broken ribs, a broken hip, several bruises and facial cuts. Jimmy Salvemini, who was in the back of the car, had cuts, bruises and contusions. Vandross faced vehicular manslaughter charges as a result of Larry&#x27;s death, and his driving license was suspended for a year. There was no evidence that Vandross was under the influence of alcohol or other drugs; he pleaded no contest to reckless driving. At first, the Salvemini family was supportive of Vandross, but later filed a wrongful death suit against him. The case was settled out of court with a payment to the Salvemini family of about $630,000. &quot;Roll It&quot; was released later that year.

== Health problems and death ==
Vandross had diabetes and hypertension. On April 16, 2003, he had a severe stroke at his home in New York City and was in a coma for nearly two months. The stroke affected his ability to speak and sing and required him to use a wheelchair. He later regained the ability to walk.

At the 2004 Grammy Awards, Vandross appeared in a pre-taped video segment to accept his Song of the Year Award for &quot;Dance With My Father&quot;, saying, &quot;When I say good-bye, it&#x27;s never for long, because &quot;I believe in the power of love&quot; (Vandross sang the last six words). His mother, Mary, accepted the award in person on his behalf. His last public appearance was on May 6, 2004, on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;. Vandross died on July 1, 2005, at the JFK Medical Center in Edison, New Jersey, at the age of 54 due to complications of a stroke.

Vandross&#x27;s funeral was held at Riverside Church in New York City on July 8, 2005. Aretha Franklin, Patti LaBelle, Stevie Wonder, Dionne Warwick and Cissy Houston were among the speakers and singers at the service. Vandross was entombed at George Washington Memorial Park in Paramus, New Jersey.

== Artistry ==
Possessing a tenor vocal range, Vandross was commonly referred to as &quot;The Velvet Voice&quot;, and was sometimes called &quot;The Best Voice of a Generation&quot;. He was also regarded as the &quot;Pavarotti of Pop&quot; by many critics.

== Legacy ==
Vandross has been cited as an inspiration by a number of other artists, including 112, Boyz II Men, D&#x27;Angelo, Hootie &amp; the Blowfish, Jaheim, John Legend, Mint Condition, Ne-Yo, Ruben Studdard, and Usher. Stokley Williams, the lead singer of Mint Condition, has said that he has &quot;studied Luther for such a long time because he was the epitome of perfect tone.&quot; On his influence, John Legend has said, &quot;All us people making slow jams now, we was inspired by the slow jams Luther Vandross was making.&quot;

In 2008, Vandross was ranked No. 54 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s List of 100 Greatest Singers of All Time. Mariah Carey stated in several interviews that standing next to Vandross while recording their duet &quot;Endless Love&quot; was intimidating. In 2010, NPR included Vandross in its 50 Greatest Voices in recorded history, saying Vandross represents &quot;the platinum standard for R&amp;B song stylings.&quot; The announcement was made on NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; on November 29, 2010.

=== Tribute ===
In 1999, Whitney Houston sang Vandross&#x27; &quot;So Amazing&quot; as a tribute to Vandross as he sat in the audience during the Soul Train Awards. Johnny Gill, El DeBarge, and Kenny Lattimore provided background vocals. On July 27, 2004, GRP Records released a smooth jazz various artists tribute album, &quot;Forever, for Always, for Luther&quot;, including ten popular songs written by Vandross. The album featured vocal arrangements by Luther and was produced by Rex Rideout and Bud Harner. Rideout had co-authored songs, contributed arrangements and played keyboards on Vandross&#x27;s final three albums. The tribute album was mixed by Ray Bardani, who recorded and mixed most of Luther&#x27;s music over the years. It featured an ensemble of smooth jazz performers, many of whom had previously worked with Vandross.

On September 20, 2005, the album &quot;So Amazing: An All-Star Tribute to Luther Vandross&quot; was released. The album is a collection of some of his songs performed by various artists, including Patti LaBelle, Stevie Wonder, Aretha Franklin, Mary J. Blige, Usher, Fantasia, Beyoncé, Donna Summer, Alicia Keys, Elton John, Celine Dion, Wyclef Jean, Babyface, John Legend, Angie Stone, Jamie Foxx, and Teddy Pendergrass. Aretha Franklin won a Grammy for her rendition of &quot;A House Is Not a Home&quot;, and Stevie Wonder and Beyoncé won a Grammy for their cover of &quot;So Amazing&quot;.

On November 21, 2006, saxophonist Dave Koz released a follow-up to the earlier smooth jazz GRP tribute album, this time on his own Rendezvous Entertainment label, an album called &quot;Forever, for Always, for Luther Volume II&quot;, also produced by Rex Rideout and Bud Harner. Koz played on all the featured Luther Vandross tracks, which were recorded by various smooth jazz artists.

On April 20, 2021, Google celebrated his 70th birthday with a Google Doodle of an animated clip that plays Vandross&#x27;s song &quot;Never Too Much&quot;.

The 2024 documentary &quot;&quot; chronicles Vandross&#x27;s life, career, and legacy.

<text>A department store is a retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different areas of the store, each area (&quot;department&quot;) specializing in a product category. In modern major cities, the department store made a dramatic appearance in the middle of the 19th century, and permanently reshaped shopping habits, and the definition of service and luxury. Similar developments were under way in London (with Whiteleys), in Paris () and in New York City (Stewart&#x27;s).

Today, departments often include the following: clothing, cosmetics, do it yourself, furniture, gardening, hardware, home appliances, houseware, paint, sporting goods, toiletries, and toys. Additionally, other lines of products such as food, books, jewellery, electronics, stationery, photographic equipment, baby products, and products for pets are sometimes included. Customers generally check out near the front of the store in discount department stores, while high-end traditional department stores include sales counters within each department. Some stores are one of many within a larger retail chain, while others are an independent retailer.

Since the 1980s, they have come under heavy pressure from discounters, and have come under even heavier pressure from e-commerce sites since the 2000s.
==Types==

Department stores can be classified in several ways:
* Mainline department store or simply, the traditional department store, offering mid- to high-end goods, most or at least some of the time at the full retail price. Examples are Macy&#x27;s, Bloomingdale&#x27;s, Nordstrom, J.C. Penney, Montgomery Ward, Sears and Belk.
**Junior department store, a term used principally in the second part of the 20th century for a smaller version of a mainline department store. These were usually either independent stores, or chains such as Boston Store and Harris &amp; Frank, which specialized in cosmetics and wearing apparel and accessories, with few home goods.
* Discount department store, a large discount store selling apparel and home furnishings at a discount, either selling overstock from mainline department stores, or merchandise especially made for the discount department store market. Examples are Nordstrom Rack, Saks Off 5th, Marshalls, Ross Dress for Less, TJ Maxx, and Kohl&#x27;s.

Some sources may refer to the following types of stores as department stores, even though they are not generally considered as such:
*Hypermarkets (discount superstores with full grocery offerings, such as Target, Walmart and Carrefour)
*Variety stores, also known in the U.S. as five and dimes, or dollar stores

==History==
===Origins in England, 1700s===
One of the first department stores may have been Bennett&#x27;s in Derby, first established as an ironmonger (hardware shop) in 1734. It still stands to this day, trading in the same building. However, the first reliably dated department store to be established, was Harding, Howell &amp; Co., which opened in 1796 on Pall Mall, London. The oldest department store chain may be Debenhams, which was established in 1778 and closed in 2021. It is the longest trading defunct British retailer. An observer writing in &quot;Ackermann&#x27;s Repository&quot;, a British periodical on contemporary taste and fashion, described the enterprise in 1809 as follows:

The house is one hundred and fifty feet in length from front to back, and of proportionate width. It is fitted up with great taste, and is divided by glazed partitions into four departments, for the various branches of the extensive business, which is there carried on. Immediately at the entrance is the first department, which is exclusively appropriated to the sale of furs and fans. The second contains articles of haberdashery of every description, silks, muslins, lace, gloves, &amp;etc. In the third shop, on the right, you meet with a rich assortment of jewelry, ornamental articles in ormolu, French clocks, &amp;etc.; and on the left, with all the different kinds of perfumery necessary for the toilette. The fourth is set apart for millinery and dresses; so that there is no article of female attire or decoration, but what may be here procured in the first style of elegance and fashion. This concern has been conducted for the last twelve years by the present proprietors who have spared neither trouble nor expense to ensure the establishment of a superiority over every other in Europe, and to render it perfectly unique in its kind.

This venture is described as having all of the basic characteristics of the department store; it was a public retail establishment offering a wide range of consumer goods in different departments. Jonathan Glancey for the BBC writes:

Harding, Howell &amp; Co was focused on the needs and desires of fashionable women. Here, at last women were free to browse and shop, safely and decorously, away from home and from the company of men. These, for the main part, were newly affluent middle-class women, their good fortune – and the department store itself – nurtured and shaped by the Industrial Revolution. This was transforming life in London and the length and breadth of Britain at a dizzying pace on the back of energetic free trade, fecund invention, steam and sail, and a seemingly inexhaustible supply of expendable cheap labour.
This pioneering shop was closed down in 1820 when the business partnership was dissolved. All the major High Streets in British cities had flourishing department stores by the mid-or late nineteenth century. Increasingly, women became the main customers. Kendals (formerly Kendal Milne &amp; Faulkner) in Manchester lays claim to being one of the first department stores and is still known to many of its customers as Kendal&#x27;s, despite its 2005 name change to House of Fraser. The Manchester institution dates back to 1836 but had been trading as Watts Bazaar since 1796. At its zenith the store had buildings on both sides of Deansgate linked by a subterranean passage &quot;Kendals Arcade&quot; and an art nouveau tiled food hall. The store was especially known for its emphasis on quality and style over low prices giving it the nickname &quot;the Harrods of the North&quot;, although this was due in part to Harrods acquiring the store in 1919. Harrods of London can be traced back to 1834, though the current store was built between 1894 and 1905. Opened in 1830, Austins in Derry remained in operation as the world&#x27;s oldest independent department store until its closure in 2016. Lewis&#x27;s of Liverpool operated from 1856 to 2010. The world&#x27;s first Christmas grotto opened in Lewis&#x27;s in 1879, entitled &#x27;Christmas Fairyland&#x27;. Liberty &amp; Co. in London&#x27;s West End gained popularity in the 1870s for selling Oriental goods. In 1889, Oscar Wilde wrote &quot;Liberty&#x27;s is the chosen resort of the artistic shopper&quot;.

===Origins in Parisian &quot;magasins de nouveautés&quot;===

The Paris department stores have roots in the &quot;magasin de nouveautés&quot;, or novelty store; the first, the Tapis Rouge, was created in 1784. They flourished in the early 19th century. Balzac described their functioning in his novel &quot;César Birotteau&quot;. In the 1840s, with the arrival of the railroads in Paris and the increased number of shoppers they brought, they grew in size, and began to have large plate glass display windows, fixed prices and price tags, and advertising in newspapers.

A novelty shop called &quot;Au Bon Marché&quot; had been founded in Paris in 1838 to sell items like lace, ribbons, sheets, mattresses, buttons, and umbrellas. It grew from and 12 employees in 1838 to and 1,788 employees in 1879. Boucicaut was famous for his marketing innovations; a reading room for husbands while their wives shopped; extensive newspaper advertising; entertainment for children; and six million catalogs sent out to customers. By 1880 half the employees were women; unmarried women employees lived in dormitories on the upper floors.

&quot;Au Bon Marché&quot; soon had half a dozen or more competitors including Printemps, founded in 1865; La Samaritaine (1869), Bazar de Hotel de Ville (BHV); and Galeries Lafayette (1895). The French gloried in the national prestige brought by the great Parisian stores. The great writer Émile Zola (1840–1902) set his novel (1882–83) in the typical department store, making it a symbol of the new technology that was both improving society and devouring it.

=== First Australian department stores ===
Australia is notable for having the longest continuously operating department store, David Jones. The first David Jones department store was opened on 24 May 1838, by Welsh born immigrant David Jones in a &quot;large and commodious premises&quot; on the corner of George and Barrack Streets in Sydney, only 50 years after the foundation of the colony. Expanding to a number of stores in the various states of Australia, David Jones is the oldest continuously operating department franchise in the world. Other department stores in Australia include Grace Bros founded in 1885, now merged with Myer which was founded in 1900.

===First American department stores (1825–1858)===
Arnold Constable was the first American department store. It was founded in 1825 as a small dry goods store on Pine Street in New York City. In 1857 the store moved into a five-story white marble dry goods palace known as the Marble House. During the Civil War, Arnold Constable was one of the first stores to issue charge bills of credit to its customers each month instead of on a bi-annual basis. The store soon outgrew the Marble House and erected a cast-iron building on Broadway and Nineteenth Street in 1869; this &quot;Palace of Trade&quot; expanded over the years until it was necessary to move into a larger space in 1914. Financial problems led to bankruptcy in 1975.

In New York City in 1846, Alexander Turney Stewart established the &quot;Marble Palace&quot; on Broadway, between Chambers and Reade streets. He offered European retail merchandise at fixed prices on a variety of dry goods, and advertised a policy of providing &quot;free entrance&quot; to all potential customers. Though it was clad in white marble to look like a Renaissance palazzo, the building&#x27;s cast iron construction permitted large plate glass windows that permitted major seasonal displays, especially in the Christmas shopping season. In 1862, Stewart built a new store on a full city block uptown between 9th and 10th streets, with eight floors. His innovations included buying from manufacturers for cash and in large quantities, keeping his markup small and prices low, truthful presentation of merchandise, the one-price policy (so there was no haggling), simple merchandise returns and cash refund policy, selling for cash and not credit, buyers who searched worldwide for quality merchandise, departmentalization, vertical and horizontal integration, volume sales, and free services for customers such as waiting rooms and free delivery of purchases. In 1858, Rowland Hussey Macy founded Macy&#x27;s as a dry goods store.

===Innovations 1850–1917===

Marshall Field &amp; Company originated in 1852. It was the premier department store on the busiest shopping street in the Midwest at the time, State Street in Chicago. Marshall Field&#x27;s served as a model for other department stores in that it had exceptional customer service. Marshall Field&#x27;s also had the firsts; among many innovations by Marshall Field&#x27;s were the first European buying office, which was located in Manchester, England, and the first bridal registry. The company was the first to introduce the concept of the personal shopper, and that service was provided without charge in every Field&#x27;s store, until the chain&#x27;s last days under the Marshall Field&#x27;s name. It was the first store to offer revolving credit and the first department store to use escalators. Marshall Field&#x27;s book department in the State Street store was legendary; it pioneered the concept of the &quot;book signing&quot;. Moreover, every year at Christmas, Marshall Field&#x27;s downtown store windows were filled with animated displays as part of the downtown shopping district display; the &quot;theme&quot; window displays became famous for their ingenuity and beauty, and visiting the Marshall Field&#x27;s windows at Christmas became a tradition for Chicagoans and visitors alike, as popular a local practice as visiting the Walnut Room with its equally famous Christmas tree or meeting &quot;under the clock&quot; on State Street.

In 1877, John Wanamaker opened what some claim was the United States&#x27; first &quot;modern&quot; department store in Philadelphia: the first to offer fixed prices marked on every article and also introduced electrical illumination (1878), the telephone (1879), and the use of pneumatic tubes to transport cash and documents (1880) to the department store business.

Another store to revolutionize the concept of the department store was Selfridges in London, established in 1909 by American-born Harry Gordon Selfridge on Oxford Street. The company&#x27;s innovative marketing promoted the radical notion of shopping for pleasure rather than necessity and its techniques were adopted by modern department stores the world over. The store was extensively promoted through paid advertising. The shop floors were structured so that goods could be made more accessible to customers. There were elegant restaurants with modest prices, a library, reading and writing rooms, special reception rooms for French, German, American and &quot;Colonial&quot; customers, a First Aid Room, and a Silence Room, with soft lights, deep chairs, and double-glazing, all intended to keep customers in the store as long as possible. Staff members were taught to be on hand to &quot;assist&quot; customers, but not too aggressively, and to &quot;sell&quot; the merchandise. Selfridge attracted shoppers with educational and scientific exhibits; in 1909, Louis Blériot&#x27;s monoplane was exhibited at Selfridges (Blériot was the first to fly over the English Channel), and the first public demonstration of television by John Logie Baird took place in the department store in 1925.

In Japan, the first &quot;modern-style&quot; department store was Mitsukoshi, founded in 1904, which has its root as a kimono store called Echigoya from 1673. When the roots are considered, however, Matsuzakaya has an even longer history, dated from 1611. The kimono store changed to a department store in 1910. In 1924, Matsuzakaya store in Ginza allowed street shoes to be worn indoors, something innovative at the time. These former kimono shop department stores dominated the market in its earlier history. They sold, or instead displayed, luxurious products, which contributed to their sophisticated atmospheres. Another origin of the Japanese department store is from railway companies. There have been many private railway operators in the nation and, from the 1920s, they started to build department stores directly linked to their lines&#x27; termini. Seibu and Hankyu are typical examples of this type.
===Innovation (1917–1945)===
In the middle of the 1920s, American management theories such as the scientific management of F.W. Taylor started spreading in Europe. The International Management Institute (I.M.I.) was established in Geneva in 1927 to facilitate the diffusion of such ideas. A number of department stores teamed up together to create the International Association of Department Stores in Paris in 1928 to have a discussion space dedicated to this retail format.

===Expansion to malls===

The U.S. Baby Boom led to the development of suburban neighborhoods and suburban commercial developments, including shopping malls. Department stores joined these ventures following the growing market of baby boomer spending.

A handful of U.S. retailers had opened seasonal stores in resorts, as well as smaller branch stores in suburbs, in the 1920s and 1930s. Examples include, in suburban Los Angeles, The Broadway-Hollywood, Bullocks Wilshire, The May Company-Wilshire, Saks-Beverly Hills, as well as two Strawbridge and Clothier stores: Suburban Square (1930) and Jenkintown (1931) outside Philadelphia. Suburban Square was the first shopping center anchored by a department store. In the 1950s, suburban growth took off – for example, in 1952, May Company California opened a four-level, store in Lakewood Center near Los Angeles, at the time, the largest suburban department store in the world. However, only three years later it would build an even bigger, store in the San Fernando Valley at Laurel Plaza.

===Expansion worldwide===

===2010–today===
Starting in 2010 many analysts referred to a retail apocalypse in the United States and some other markets, referring to the closing of brick-and-mortar retail stores, especially those of large chains. In 2017, over 12,000 U.S. stores closed due to over-expansion of malls, rising rents, bankruptcies, leveraged buyouts, low quarterly profits other than during holiday peak periods, delayed effects of the Great Recession of 2008-9, shifts in spending to experiences rather than material goods, relaxed dress codes in workplaces, and the shift to e-commerce in which Amazon.com and Walmart dominated versus the online offerings of traditional retailers.

COVID-19 increased the number of permanent store closings in two ways: first through mandatory temporary closing of stores, especially in March and April 2020, with customers largely staying away from stores for non-essential purchases for many more months after that; and secondly, by causing a shift to working from home, which stimulated e-commerce further and reduced demand for business apparel.

===Click-and-collect, curbside pickup===
Click-and-collect services at department stores had been increasing during the 2010s, with many creating larger, distinctly signed, designated areas. Some of the more elaborate ones included features such as reception and seating areas with coffee served, computers with large screens for online shopping, and dressing rooms.

With the onset of COVID-19 in 2020, most U.S. retailers offered a curbside pickup service as an option on their websites, and a dedicated area at one of the store entrances accessible by car.

===Store-within-a-store===
Along with discount stores, mainline department stores implemented more and more &quot;stores-within-a-store&quot;. For luxury brands this was often in boutiques similar to the brands&#x27; own shops on streets and in malls; they hired their own employees who merchandised the selling space, and rang up the transactions at the brand&#x27;s own cash registers. The main difference was that the boutique was physically inside the department store building, although in many cases there are walls or windows between the main store space and the boutique, with designated entrances.

<text>Microsoft Agent is a technology developed by Microsoft which employs animated characters, text-to-speech engines, and speech recognition software to enhance interaction with computer users. It came pre-installed as part of Windows 2000 and later versions of Microsoft Windows up to Windows Vista. It was not included with Windows 7, and was completely discontinued in Windows 8. Microsoft Agent functionality was exposed as an ActiveX control that can be used by web pages.

The theory behind the software came from work on social interfaces by Clifford Nass and Byron Reeves at Stanford&#x27;s Center for the Study of Language and Information.

==Version history==
Interactive character technology was first introduced in Microsoft Bob, which used an early version of Microsoft Agent technology internally referred to as &quot;Microsoft Actor&quot;. It was the code used in the initial version of the Office Assistant in Microsoft Office 97. Microsoft Agent was subsequently created by Tandy Trower in an attempt to offer technology that was more flexible and available to third-party developers to include in their applications and web pages. The software release also included four interactive characters as well as a utility that enables developers to assemble their own characters and interactions. 

Microsoft Agent replaced the original Microsoft Actor code in Office 2000, although this use did not include Agent&#x27;s much-touted speech synthesis or recognition capabilities or any of the four Microsoft Agent sample characters. Instead, the Office team created their own characters, including one named &quot;Clippit&quot; (commonly dubbed &quot;Clippy&quot;). However, Microsoft Bob Actors and Office 97 assistants are incompatible with Office 2000 and later versions, and vice versa.

The initial version of Microsoft Agent was quietly released on MSDN in 1997.

==Technology==
Microsoft Agent characters are stored in files of the .ACS extension or in a single .ACF file for character definitions, and multiple .ACA files (one per animation) for better World Wide Web distribution. Microsoft Office 97 and Microsoft Bob Actor characters are stored in files of the .ACT extension. Microsoft Agent character definition files are stored in files of the .ACD file extension, and are generated by the Microsoft Agent Character Editor.

The speech engine itself is driven by the Microsoft Speech API (SAPI), version 4 and above. Microsoft SAPI provides a control panel for easily installing and switching between various available Text to Speech and Speech to Text engines, as well as voice training and scoring systems to improve the quality and accuracy of both engines.

Microsoft provided four agent characters for free, downloaded from the Microsoft Agent website. These were called Peedy, Merlin, Genie, and Robby. Some characters also shipped with Microsoft Office up to version 2003 as the Office Assistants and with Windows XP as search assistants. New Microsoft Agent characters could also be created using Microsoft&#x27;s development tools, including the Agent Character Editor. Agents can be embedded in software with Visual Basic for Applications and in web pages with VBScript, and automated tools for the purpose of simplifying this exist. However, web page agents were only compatible with Internet Explorer, since alternative browsers like Opera or Mozilla Firefox do not support ActiveX.

==Support after Windows XP==
In Windows Vista, Microsoft Agent uses Speech API (SAPI) version 5.3 as its primary text-to-speech provider. (In previous versions of Windows, Agent uses SAPI version 4, which is not supported in Windows Vista and later.) Beginning with Vista, multilingual features of Microsoft Agent under a particular language version of the OS are not supported; that is, Agent will function in other languages only under a localized Windows version of the same language.

Microsoft announced in April 2009 that all Microsoft Agent development and support will be discontinued with the release of Windows 7. Microsoft is no longer offering licenses or distributing the SDK.

However, due to customer feedback, Microsoft provided an installation package of the Microsoft Agent core components for use on Windows 7. The download supported SAPI 5.3 compatible speech engines, and also contained the character “Merlin”, which shipped with Windows Vista.

<doc id="249176" wikidata="Q548675" url="?curid=249176" title="Levi-Civita connection">
<text>In Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian geometry (in particular the Lorentzian geometry of general relativity), the Levi-Civita connection is the unique affine connection on the tangent bundle of a manifold that preserves the (pseudo-)Riemannian metric and is torsion-free.

The fundamental theorem of Riemannian geometry states that there is a unique connection that satisfies these properties.

In the theory of Riemannian and pseudo-Riemannian manifolds the term covariant derivative is often used for the Levi-Civita connection. The components (structure coefficients) of this connection with respect to a system of local coordinates are called Christoffel symbols.

== History ==
The Levi-Civita connection is named after Tullio Levi-Civita, although originally &quot;discovered&quot; by Elwin Bruno Christoffel. Levi-Civita, along with Gregorio Ricci-Curbastro, used Christoffel&#x27;s symbols to define the notion of parallel transport and explore the relationship of parallel transport with the curvature, thus developing the modern notion of holonomy.

In 1869, Christoffel discovered that the components of the intrinsic derivative of a vector field, upon changing the coordinate system, transform as the components of a contravariant vector. This discovery was the real beginning of tensor analysis. 

In 1906, L. E. J. Brouwer was the first mathematician to consider the parallel transport of a vector for the case of 
a space of constant curvature.

In 1917, Levi-Civita pointed out its importance for the case of a hypersurface immersed in a Euclidean space, i.e., for the case of a Riemannian manifold embedded in a &quot;larger&quot; ambient space. He interpreted the intrinsic derivative in the case of an embedded surface as the tangential component of the usual derivative in the ambient affine space. The Levi-Civita notions of intrinsic derivative and parallel displacement of a vector along a curve make sense on an abstract Riemannian manifold, even though the original motivation relied on a specific embedding formula_1

In 1918, independently of Levi-Civita, Jan Arnoldus Schouten obtained analogous results. In the same year, Hermann Weyl generalized 
Levi-Civita&#x27;s results.

== Notation ==
* denotes a pseudo-Riemannian manifold.
* is the tangent bundle of .
* is the pseudo-Riemannian metric of .
* are smooth vector fields on , i. e. smooth sections of .
* is the Lie bracket of and . It is again a smooth vector field.

The metric can take up to two vectors or vector fields as arguments. In the former case the output is a number, the (pseudo-)inner product of and . In the latter case, the inner product of is taken at all points on the manifold so that defines a smooth function on . Vector fields act (by definition) as differential operators on smooth functions. In local coordinates formula_2, the action reads
: formula_3
where Einstein&#x27;s summation convention is used.

== Formal definition ==
An affine connection formula_4 is called a Levi-Civita connection if
# &quot;it preserves the metric&quot;, i.e., formula_5.
# &quot;it is torsion-free&quot;, i.e., for any vector fields formula_6 and formula_7 we have formula_8, where formula_9 is the Lie bracket of the vector fields formula_6 and formula_7.

Condition 1 above is sometimes referred to as compatibility with the metric, and condition 2 is sometimes called symmetry, cf. Do Carmo&#x27;s text.

== Fundamental theorem of (pseudo-)Riemannian geometry ==

Theorem Every pseudo-Riemannian manifold formula_12 has a unique Levi Civita connection formula_4.

&quot;Proof&quot;:
To prove uniqueness, unravel the definition of the action of a connection on tensors to find 
: formula_14.
Hence one can write the condition that formula_4 preserves the metric as
: formula_16.
By the symmetry of formula_17,
: formula_18.
By torsion-freeness, the right hand side is therefore equal to
: formula_19.
Thus, the Koszul formula
: formula_20
holds. Hence, if a Levi-Civita connection exists, it must be unique, because formula_21 is arbitrary, formula_17 is non degenerate, and the right hand side does not depend on formula_4. 

To prove existence, note that for given vector field formula_6 and formula_7, the right hand side of the Koszul expression is linear over smooth functions in the vector field formula_21, not just real-linear. Hence by the non degeneracy of formula_17, the right hand side uniquely defines some new vector field, which is suggestively denoted formula_28 as in the left hand side. By substituting the Koszul formula, one now checks that for all vector fields formula_29 and all functions formula_30,
: formula_31
: formula_32
: formula_33
: formula_34
Hence the Koszul expression does, in fact, define a connection, and this connection is compatible with the metric and is torsion free, i.e. is a Levi-Civita connection.

With minor variation, the same proof shows that there is a unique connection that is compatible with the metric and has prescribed torsion.

== Christoffel symbols ==
Let formula_4 be an affine connection on the tangent bundle. Choose local coordinates formula_36 with coordinate basis vector fields formula_37 and write formula_38 for formula_39. The Christoffel symbols formula_40 of formula_4 with respect to these coordinates are defined as
: formula_42

The Christoffel symbols conversely define the connection formula_4 on the coordinate neighbourhood because
: formula_44
that is,
: formula_45
An affine connection formula_4 is compatible with a metric iff
: formula_47
i.e., if and only if
: formula_48
An affine connection is torsion free iff
: formula_49
i.e., if and only if 
: formula_50
is symmetric in its lower two indices.

As one checks by taking for formula_51, coordinate vector fields formula_52 (or computes directly), the Koszul expression of the Levi-Civita connection derived above is equivalent to a definition of the Christoffel symbols in terms of the metric as
: formula_53
where as usual formula_54 are the coefficients of the dual metric tensor, i.e. the entries of the inverse of the matrix formula_55.

== Derivative along curve ==
The Levi-Civita connection (like any affine connection) also defines a derivative along curves, sometimes denoted by .

Given a smooth curve on and a vector field along its derivative is defined by
: formula_56

Formally, is the pullback connection on the pullback bundle .

In particular, formula_57 is a vector field along the curve itself. If formula_58 vanishes, the curve is called a geodesic of the covariant derivative. Formally, the condition can be restated as the vanishing of the pullback connection applied to formula_59:
: formula_60

If the covariant derivative is the Levi-Civita connection of a certain metric, then the geodesics for the connection are precisely those geodesics of the metric that are parametrised proportionally to their arc length.

== Parallel transport ==
In general, parallel transport along a curve with respect to a connection defines isomorphisms between the tangent spaces at the points of the curve. If the connection is a Levi-Civita connection, then these isomorphisms are orthogonal – that is, they preserve the inner products on the various tangent spaces.

The images below show parallel transport induced by the Levi-Civita connection associated to two different Riemannian metrics on the punctured plane formula_61. The curve the parallel transport is done along is the unit circle. In polar coordinates, the metric on the left is the standard Euclidean metric formula_62, while the metric on the right is formula_63. The first metric extends to the entire plane, but the second metric has a singularity at the origin:
: formula_64
: formula_65
: formula_66.
Warning: This is parallel transport on the punctured plane &quot;along&quot; the unit circle, not parallel transport &quot;on&quot; the unit circle. Indeed, in the first image, the vectors fall outside of the tangent space to the unit circle.

== Example: the unit sphere in R3 ==
Let be the usual scalar product on . Let be the unit sphere in . The tangent space to at a point is naturally identified with the vector subspace of consisting of all vectors orthogonal to . It follows that a vector field on can be seen as a map , which satisfies
formula_67

Denote as the differential of the map at the point . Then we have:

In fact, this connection is the Levi-Civita connection for the metric on inherited from . Indeed, one can check that this connection preserves the metric.

== Behaviour under conformal rescaling ==
If the metric formula_17 in a conformal class is replaced by the conformally rescaled metric of the same class formula_69, then the Levi-Civita connection transforms according to the rule
formula_70
where formula_71 is the gradient vector field of formula_72 i.e. the vector field formula_17-dual to formula_74, in local coordinates given by formula_75. Indeed, it is trivial to verify that formula_76 is torsion-free. To verify metricity, assume that formula_77 is constant. In that case,
formula_78

As an application, consider again the unit sphere, but this time under stereographic projection, so that the metric (in complex Fubini–Study coordinates formula_79) is:
formula_80
This exhibits the metric of the sphere as conformally flat, with the Euclidean metric formula_81, with formula_82. We have formula_83, and so
formula_84
With the Euclidean gradient formula_85, we have
formula_86
These relations, together with their complex conjugates, define the Christoffel symbols for the two-sphere.

<doc id="249182" wikidata="Q502074" url="?curid=249182" title="Heliport">
<text>A heliport is a small airport which has a helipad, suitable for use by helicopters, powered lift, and various types of vertical lift aircraft. 

Designated heliports typically contain one or more touchdown and liftoff areas and may also have limited facilities such as fuel or hangars. In some larger towns and cities, customs facilities may also be available. The broader term vertiport refers to take-off/landing sites for all aircraft landing vertically.

Early advocates of helicopters hoped that heliports would become widespread, but they have become contentious in urban areas due to the excessive noise caused by helicopter traffic.

In American use a heliport is defined as &quot;an area of land, water, or structure used or intended to be used for the landing and takeoff of helicopters and includes its buildings and facilities if any&quot;. A heliport will consist of one or more helipads, which are defined as &quot;a small, designated area, usually with a prepared surface, on a heliport, airport, landing/take-off area, apron/ramp, or movement area used for takeoff, landing, or parking of helicopters&quot;.

In Canada the term heliport is legally only used for a certified aerodrome for helicopter use.

==Heliport airspace==
The airspace immediately surrounding the heliport is called the Primary Surface. This area coincides in shape and size with the designated take-off and landing area. This surface is a horizontal plane equal to the elevation of the established heliport elevation. The Primary Surface is further broken down into three distinct regions. These are, the &#x27;Touch-down and Lift-off&#x27; (TLOF) area, the &#x27;Final Approach and Takeoff&#x27; (FATO) area and the &#x27;Safety Area&#x27;. 

The TLOF is a load-bearing, generally paved area, normally centered in the FATO, on which the helicopter lands and / or takes off. The FATO is a defined area over which the pilot completes the final phase of the approach to a hover or a landing, and from which the pilot initiates take-off. The FATO elevation is the lowest elevation of the edge of the TLOF. The Safety Area is a defined area on a heliport surrounding the FATO intended to reduce the risk of damage to helicopters accidentally diverging from the FATO.

==Purpose==
In a large metropolitan and urban areas, a heliport can serve passengers needing to quickly move within the city, or to outlying regions. Generally, heliports can be situated closer to a town or city center than an airport for fixed-wing aircraft. The advantage in flying by helicopter to a destination, or even to the city&#x27;s main airport, is that travel can be much faster than by surface transport. As an example, the Downtown Manhattan Heliport in New York City provides scheduled service to John F. Kennedy International Airport, and is used to move wealthy persons and important goods quickly to destinations as far away as Maryland.

Police departments use heliports as a base for police helicopters, and larger departments may have a dedicated large heliport facility dedicated such as the LAPD Hooper Heliport.

Some skyscrapers feature rooftop heliports to serve the transport needs of executives or clients. Many of these rooftop sites also serve as Emergency Helicopter Landing Facilities (EHLF), in case emergency evacuation is needed. The U.S. Bank Tower in Los Angeles is an example.

Helipads are common features at hospitals, where they serve to facilitate helicopter air ambulance and MEDEVACs for transferring patients into and out of hospital facilities. Some large trauma centers may have multiple helipads, while most small hospitals have just one. Helipads allow hospitals to accept patients flown in from remote accident sites, where there are no local hospitals or facilities capable of providing the level of emergency care required.

The National EMS Pilots Association (NEMSPA) has published multiple white papers, surveys and safety recommendations for the enhancement of hospital helipad operations to improve patient safety.

==Heliport markings ==
While heliports can be oriented in any direction, they will generally have very definitive approach and departure paths. However, heliports are not numbered in the same way that runways at airports are. Recommended standard practice by both the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the International Civil Aviation Organization (ICAO) is to orient a H in the center of the TLOF, in line with the preferred approach / departure direction.

An information box should also be included in the TLOF area, which provides the aircraft gross weight the helipad is rated for, as well as the maximum size helicopter the helipad has been designed to accommodated, which is based on the helicopter rotor diameter and overall length of the largest design helicopter that will service the helipad. Under normal conditions, it is standard practice to paint the maximum gross weight a helipad is designed to support in either metric tonnes, kilograms, or thousands of pounds, along with the maximum helicopter dimensions in metres or feet. Arrows are oftentimes painted on the heliport to indicate to pilots the preferred approach / departure paths. Other common markings can include ownership, radio frequencies, company logo(s), and magnetic north.

==Lighting==
To conduct night-time operations, a heliport must have lighting installed that meets specific aeronautical standards. Heliport perimeter lights are generally installed around the TLOF area, and may be flush mounted on the TLOF itself, or mounted just off the TLOF perimeter on short metal or concrete extensions.

One alternative to lighting the TLOF if certain criteria are met, is to light the area of the FATO instead. Some locations, due to environmental conditions, illuminate the TLOF and FATO. Lighting should never constitute an obstruction that a helicopter may impact, and for this reason, in the U.S., heliport lighting is not allowed to extend above the TLOF or FATO more than . Current standards recommend that all perimeter lighting be green. Prior standards recommended amber lighting for perimeter lights; however this wavelength has been shown to interfere with night vision goggle (NVG) operations, when used with older incandescent lighting.

In the past, lighting has been traditionally incandescent, but increasingly, light-emitting diodes (LEDs) are being incorporated, due to lower power requirements and increased life. While flood lights may be used to enhance surface operations, they should not interfere with flight crew night vision, and should be kept off during flight operations, and only used when conducting ground movement operations. To conduct night operations, a lighted wind cone is also required. At ground-based heliports, lead-in lights may be incorporated to identify the preferred approach / departure direction. Visual slope guidance systems (such as HAPI, PAPI, etc.) are recommended options in both ICAO and FAA documents. While airports commonly use 6.6A direct current power, heliport lighting is normally AC powered. Radio control of the lighting by the pilot via an automated ground-based controller is also common.

==Approach / departure airspace==

To provide for a safe environment to perform normal helicopter landing and take-off operations, each heliport must have unobstructed approach / departure paths.

The minimum recommended separation between flight paths is 135 degrees. A heliport approach path is broken down into two distinct airspace surfaces; the Approach Surface, and the Transitional Surface. The approach surface begins at each end of the heliport primary surface with the same width as the primary surface, and extends outward and upward for a horizontal distance of , where its width is . The slope of the approach surface is 8-to-1 for civil heliports. The Transitional Surfaces extend outward and upward from the lateral boundaries of the primary surface, and from the approach surfaces, at a slope of 2-to-1 for a distance of , measured horizontally from the centerline of the primary and approach surfaces. Approach paths can either be straight or curved to accommodate obstructions and avoidance areas.

== Recent Regulatory Developments ==

* EASA Certification Specifications: The European Union Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has introduced new Certification Specifications (CS-HPT-DSN) for surface-level Visual Flight Rules (VFR) heliports. This regulation aligns with ICAO Annex 14, Volume II, and establishes requirements for heliport infrastructure, including Final Approach and Take-off Areas (FATO), Safety Areas, and Touchdown and Lift-off Areas (TLOF). Aerodrome operators are now responsible for demonstrating compliance with these specifications to ensure safety and operational efficiency at heliports located at airports.
* FAA Advisory Circular Updates: The Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) updated its Advisory Circular (AC 150/5390-2D) in May 2023, which provides comprehensive design standards for heliports. This document outlines planning, design, and construction guidelines to ensure safety and operational performance for various types of heliports, including those serving emergency services and general aviation. It emphasizes the importance of adhering to these standards for projects funded under federal assistance programs.

<doc id="249183" wikidata="Q1018743" url="?curid=249183" title="Ludlow Massacre">
<text>The Ludlow Massacre was a mass killing perpetrated by anti-striker militia during the Colorado Coalfield War. Soldiers from the Colorado National Guard and private guards employed by Colorado Fuel and Iron Company (CF&amp;I) attacked a tent colony of roughly 1,200 striking coal miners and their families in Ludlow, Colorado, on April 20, 1914. Approximately 21 people were killed, including miners&#x27; wives and children. John D. Rockefeller Jr. was a part-owner of CF&amp;I who had recently appeared before a United States congressional hearing on the strikes, and he was widely blamed for having orchestrated the massacre.

The massacre was the seminal event of the 1913–1914 Colorado Coalfield War, which began with a general United Mine Workers of America strike against poor labor conditions in CF&amp;I&#x27;s southern Colorado coal mines. The strike was organized by miners working for the Rocky Mountain Fuel Company and Victor-American Fuel Company. Ludlow was the deadliest single incident during the Colorado Coalfield War and spurred a ten-day period of heightened violence throughout Colorado. In retaliation for the massacre at Ludlow, bands of armed miners attacked dozens of anti-union establishments, destroying property and engaging in several skirmishes with the Colorado National Guard along a front from Trinidad to Louisville. From the strike&#x27;s beginning in September 1913 to intervention by federal soldiers under President Woodrow Wilson&#x27;s orders on April 29, 1914, an estimated 69 to 199 people were killed during the strike. Historian Thomas G. Andrews declared it the &quot;deadliest strike in the history of the United States.&quot;

The Ludlow Massacre was a watershed moment in American labor relations. Socialist historian Howard Zinn described it as &quot;the culminating act of perhaps the most violent struggle between corporate power and laboring men in American history&quot;. Congress responded to public outrage by directing the House Committee on Mines and Mining to investigate the events. Its report, published in 1915, was influential in promoting child labor laws and an eight-hour work day. The Ludlow townsite and the adjacent location of the tent colony, northwest of Trinidad, Colorado, is now a ghost town. The massacre site is owned by the United Mine Workers of America, which erected a granite monument in memory of those who died that day. The Ludlow tent colony site was designated a National Historic Landmark on January 16, 2009, and dedicated on June 28, 2009. Subsequent investigations immediately following the massacre and modern archeological efforts largely support some of the strikers&#x27; accounts of the event.

==Background==
Areas of the Rocky Mountains have veins of coal close to the surface, providing significant and relatively accessible reserves. In 1867, these coal deposits caught the attention of William Jackson Palmer, then leading a survey team planning the route of the Kansas Pacific Railway. The rapid expansion of rail transport in the United States made coal a highly valued commodity, and it was rapidly commercialized.

At its peak in 1910, the coal mining industry of Colorado employed 15,864 people, 10% of jobs in the state. Colorado&#x27;s coal industry was dominated by a handful of operators. Colorado Fuel and Iron was the largest coal operator in the west and one of the nation&#x27;s most powerful corporations, at one point employing 7,050 people and controlling of coal land. John D. Rockefeller purchased a controlling stake in the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company in 1902, and nine years later he turned over his controlling interest in the company to his son, John D. Rockefeller Jr., who managed the company from his offices at 26 Broadway in New York.

Mining was dangerous and difficult work. Colliers in Colorado were constantly threatened by explosions, suffocation, and collapsing mine walls. In 1912, the death rate in Colorado&#x27;s mines was 7.06 per 1,000 employees, compared to a national rate of 3.15. In 1914, the United States House Committee on Mines and Mining reported:

Miners were generally paid according to tonnage of coal produced, but so-called &quot;dead work&quot;, such as shoring up unstable roofs, was often unpaid. The tonnage system drove many poor and ambitious colliers to gamble with their lives by neglecting precautions and taking on risk, often with fatal consequences. Between 1884 and 1912, mining accidents killed more than 1,700 in Colorado. In 1913 alone, 110 men died in mine-related accidents.
Colliers had little opportunity to air their grievances. Many resided in company towns, in which all land, real estate, and amenities were owned by the mine operator, and which were expressly designed to inculcate loyalty and squelch dissent. Welfare capitalists believed that anger and unrest among the workers could be placated by raising colliers&#x27; standard of living, while subsuming it under company management. Company towns indeed brought tangible improvements to many colliers&#x27; lives, including larger houses, better medical care, and broader access to education. But owning the towns gave companies considerable control over all aspects of workers&#x27; lives, and they did not always use this power to augment public welfare. Historian Philip S. Foner has described company towns as &quot;feudal domain[s], with the company acting as lord and master. ... The &#x27;law&#x27; consisted of the company rules. Curfews were imposed. Company guards—brutal thugs armed with machine guns and rifles loaded with soft-point bullets—would not admit any &#x27;suspicious&#x27; stranger into the camp and would not permit any miner to leave.&quot; Miners who came into conflict with the company were often summarily evicted from their homes.

Frustrated by working conditions they found unsafe and unjust, colliers increasingly turned to unions. Nationwide, organized mines boasted 40% fewer fatalities than nonunion mines. Colorado miners repeatedly attempted to unionize after the state&#x27;s first strike in 1883. The Western Federation of Miners organized primarily hard-rock miners in the gold and silver camps during the 1890s.

Beginning in 1900, the United Mine Workers of America began organizing coal miners in the western states, including southern Colorado. The union decided to focus on the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company because of its harsh management tactics under the conservative and distant Rockefellers and other investors. To break or prevent strikes, the coal companies hired strike breakers, mainly from Mexico and southern and eastern Europe. The Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company mixed immigrants of different nationalities in the mines to discourage communication that might lead to organization.

==Strike==
Suffering attempts to suppress union activity, the United Mine Workers of America secretly continued its unionization efforts in the years leading up to 1913. Eventually, the union presented a list of seven demands:

# Recognition of the union as bargaining agent
# Compensation for digging coal at a ton rate based on 2,000 pounds (previous ton rates were of long tons of 2,200 pounds)
# Enforcement of the eight-hour work-day law
# Payment for &quot;dead work&quot; (laying track, timbering, handling impurities, etc.)
# Weight checkmen elected by the workers (to keep company weightmen honest)
# Right to use any store, and to choose their boarding houses and doctors
# Strict enforcement of Colorado&#x27;s laws (such as mine safety rules, abolition of scrip), and an end to the company guard system

The major coal companies rejected the demands. In September 1913, the United Mine Workers of America called a strike. Those who went on strike were evicted from their company homes and moved to tent villages prepared by the union. The tents were built on wood platforms and furnished with cast-iron stoves on land the union had leased in preparation for a strike.
When leasing the sites, the union had selected locations near the mouths of canyons that led to the coal camps in order to block any strikebreakers&#x27; traffic. The company hired the Baldwin–Felts Detective Agency to protect the new workers and harass the strikers.

Baldwin–Felts had a reputation for aggressive strike breaking. Agents shone searchlights on the tent villages at night and fired bullets into the tents at random, occasionally killing and maiming people. They used an improvised armored car, mounted with a machine gun the union called the &quot;Death Special&quot;, to patrol the camp&#x27;s perimeters. The steel-covered car was built at the Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company plant in Pueblo, Colorado, from the chassis of a large touring sedan. Confrontations between striking miners and working miners, whom the union called scabs, sometimes resulted in deaths. Frequent sniper attacks on the tent colonies drove the miners to dig pits beneath the tents to hide in. Armed battles also occurred between (mostly Greek) strikers and sheriffs recently deputized to suppress the strike: this was the Colorado Coalfield War.
As strike-related violence mounted, Colorado governor Elias M. Ammons called in the Colorado National Guard on October 28. At first, the Guard&#x27;s appearance calmed the situation, but the Guard leaders&#x27; sympathies lay with company management. Guard Adjutant-General John Chase, who had served during the violent Cripple Creek strike 10 years earlier, imposed a harsh regime. On March 10, 1914, a replacement worker&#x27;s body was found on the railroad tracks near Forbes, Colorado. The National Guard said the strikers had murdered the man. In retaliation, Chase ordered the Forbes tent colony destroyed. The attack was launched while the residents were attending a funeral of two infants who had died a few days earlier. Photographer Lou Dold witnessed the attack, and his images of the destruction often appear in accounts of the strike.

The strikers persevered until the spring of 1914. By then, according to historian Anthony DeStefanis, the National Guard had largely broken the strike by helping the mine operators bring in non-union workers. The state had also run out of money to maintain the Guard, and Ammons decided to recall them. He and the mining companies, fearing a breakdown in order, left one company of Guardsmen in southern Colorado. They formed a new company called &quot;Troop A&quot;, which consisted largely of Colorado Fuel &amp; Iron Company mine camp guards and mine guards hired by Baldwin–Felts, who were given National Guard uniforms.

==Massacre==

On the morning of April 20, the day after some in the tent colony celebrated Orthodox Easter, three Guardsmen appeared at the camp ordering the release of a man they claimed was being held against his will. The camp leader, Louis Tikas, left to meet with Major Patrick J. Hamrock at the train station in Ludlow village, from the colony. While this meeting was progressing, two militias installed a machine gun on a ridge near the camp and took positions along a rail route about half a mile south of Ludlow. Simultaneously, armed Greek miners began flanking to an arroyo. When two of the militias&#x27; dynamite explosions – detonated to draw support from the National Guard units at Berwind and Cedar Hill – alerted the Ludlow tent colony, the miners took up positions at the bottom of the hill. When the militia opened fire, hundreds of miners and their families ran for cover.

The fighting raged for the entire day. The militia was reinforced by non-uniformed mine guards later in the afternoon. At dusk a passing freight train stopped on the tracks in front of the Guards&#x27; machine-gun placements, allowing many of the miners and their families to escape to an outcrop of hills to the east called the Black Hills. By 7 p.m., the camp was in flames, and the militia descended on it and began to search and loot it. Tikas had remained in the camp the entire day and was still there when the fire started. He and two other men were captured by the militia. Tikas and Lt. Karl Linderfelt, commander of one of two Guard companies, had confronted each other several times in the previous months. While two militiamen held Tikas, Linderfelt broke a rifle butt over his head. Tikas and the other two captured miners were later found shot dead. Tikas had been shot in the back. Their bodies lay along the Colorado and Southern Railway tracks for three days in full view of passing trains. The militia officers refused to allow them to be moved until a local of a railway union demanded they be taken away for burial.

During the battle, four women and 11 children hid in a pit beneath one tent, where they were trapped when the tent above them was set on fire. Two of the women and all the children suffocated. These deaths became a rallying cry for the United Mine Workers of America, who called the incident the Ludlow Massacre.

Julia May Courtney reported different numbers in her contemporaneous article &quot;Remember Ludlow!&quot; for the magazine &quot;Mother Earth&quot;. She said that, in addition to men who were killed, a total of 55 women and children had died in the massacre. According to her account, the militia:


Some reports say a second machine gun was brought in to support the estimated 200 Guardsmen who participated in the engagement, and that a Colorado and Southern train&#x27;s operators purposely put their engine between a machine gun and the strikers as a shield against National Guard fire.

A board of Colorado military officers described the events as beginning with the killing of Tikas and other strikers in custody, with gunfire largely emanating from the southwestern corner of the Ludlow Colony. Guardsmen stationed on &quot;Water Tank Hill&quot;—the name for the machine gun position—fired into the camp. The Guardsmen reported having seen women and children withdrawing the morning before the battle and said they thought the strikers would not have begun firing if they had women still with them. The board&#x27;s official report commended the &quot;truly heroic behavior&quot; of Linderfelt, the guardsmen, and the militia during the battle and blamed the strikers for any civilian casualties during the engagement, despite those killed being family members of the strikers. The report also blamed the looting that occurred afterward on &quot;Troop &#x27;A&#x27;&quot;, a unit composed largely of non-uniformed mine guards who had been integrated into the Guard.

In addition to the miners and their family members, three regular members of the National Guard and one other militiaman were reported killed in the day&#x27;s fighting by contemporary accounts. However, modern historians assert that only one of the militia&#x27;s number, a private named Martin of the National Guard, was killed. Martin was fatally shot in the neck, presumably by strikers.

==Aftermath==
In the aftermath of the massacre came the Ten Day War, part of the wider Colorado Coalfield War. As news of the deaths of women and children spread, the leaders of organized labor issued a call to arms. They urged union members to get &quot;all the arms and ammunition legally available&quot;. Subsequently, the coal miners began a large-scale guerrilla war against the mine guards and facilities throughout Colorado&#x27;s southern coalfields. In the town of Trinidad, the United Mine Workers of America openly and officially distributed arms and ammunition to strikers at union headquarters.

Over the next ten days, 700 to 1,000 strikers &quot;attacked mine after mine, driving off or killing the guards and setting fire to the buildings.&quot; At least 50 people, including those at Ludlow, were killed during the ten days of fighting between the guards and miners. Hundreds of state militia reinforcements were rushed to the coalfields to regain control of the situation. The fighting ended only after President Woodrow Wilson sent in federal troops. The troops disarmed both sides, displacing and often arresting the militia in the process. The Colorado Coalfield War produced a total death toll of approximately 75.

The United Mine Workers of America finally ran out of money, and called off the strike on December 10, 1914. In the end, the strikers&#x27; demands were not met, the union did not obtain recognition, and many striking workers were replaced. 408 strikers were arrested, 332 of whom were indicted for murder.

Of those present at Ludlow during the massacre, only John R. Lawson, leader of the strike, was convicted of murder, and the Colorado Supreme Court eventually overturned the conviction. Twenty-two National Guardsmen, including 10 officers, were court-martialed. While Linderfelt was found responsible for the deaths of Tikas and other strikers that exhibited execution-style injuries, he and all others were acquitted.

An Episcopalian minister, Reverend John O. Ferris, pastored Trinity Church in Trinidad and another church in Aguilar. He was one of the few pastors in Trinidad permitted to search and provide Christian burials to the deceased victims of the Ludlow Massacre.

The massacre sparked nationwide reproach for the Rockefellers, especially in New York, where protesters demonstrated outside of the Rockefeller building in New York City. Protesters led by Ferrer Center anarchists Alexander Berkman and Carlo Tresca followed when Rockefeller Jr. fled upstate to the family estate near Tarrytown. In early July, a failed bomb plot on the Tarrytown estate ended with a dynamite explosion in East Harlem and three dead anarchists. The New York City Police Department inaugurated its bomb squad within a month. Bomb plots continued throughout the rest of the year.

Although the UMWA failed to win recognition from the company, the strike had a lasting effect both on conditions at the Colorado mines and on labor relations nationally. John D. Rockefeller Jr. engaged W. L. Mackenzie King, a labor relations expert and future Canadian Prime Minister, to help him develop reforms for the mines and towns. Improvements included paved roads and recreational facilities, as well as worker representation on committees dealing with working conditions, safety, health, and recreation. He prohibited discrimination against workers who had belonged to unions and ordered the establishment of a company union. The miners voted to accept the Rockefeller plan.

Rockefeller Jr. also brought in pioneer public relations expert Ivy Lee, who warned that the Rockefellers were losing public support and developed a strategy that Rockefeller followed to repair it. Rockefeller had to overcome his shyness, go to Colorado to meet the miners and their families, inspect the homes and the factories, attend social events, and listen closely to the grievances. This was novel advice, and attracted widespread media attention. The Rockefellers were able both to resolve the conflict, and present a more humanized version of their leaders.

Over time, Ludlow has assumed &quot;a striking centrality in the interpretation of the nation&#x27;s history developed by several of the most important left-leaning thinkers of the 20th century.&quot; Historian Howard Zinn wrote his master&#x27;s thesis and several book chapters on Ludlow. George McGovern wrote his doctoral dissertation on the subject. In 1972, the same year as his U.S. presidential campaign, he published this dissertation with the help of historian Leonard Guttridge under the title &quot;The Great Coalfield War&quot;.

A United States Commission on Industrial Relations (CIR), headed by labor lawyer Frank Walsh, conducted hearings in Washington, DC, collecting information and taking testimony from all the principals, including Rockefeller Sr., who testified that, even after knowing that guards in his pay had committed atrocities against the strikers, he &quot;would have taken no action&quot; to prevent his hirelings from attacking them. The commission&#x27;s report endorsed many of the reforms the unions sought, and provided support for bills establishing a national eight-hour workday and a ban on child labor;.

==In other media==
Several popular songs have been written and recorded about the events at Ludlow. American folk singer Woody Guthrie&#x27;s is &quot;Ludlow Massacre&quot;, Red Dirt country singer Jason Boland&#x27;s &quot;Ludlow&quot;, and Irish musician Andy Irvine&#x27;s is &quot;The Monument (Lest We Forget)&quot;.

Upton Sinclair&#x27;s novel &quot;King Coal&quot; is loosely based on the origin and aftermath of the Ludlow Massacre. Thomas Pynchon&#x27;s 2006 novel &quot;Against the Day&quot; contains a chapter on the massacre.

American writer and Colorado Poet Laureate David Mason wrote what he calls a verse-novel, &quot;Ludlow&quot; (2007), inspired by the labor dispute. Composer Lori Laitman&#x27;s opera &quot;Ludlow&quot; is based on Mason&#x27;s book. The University of Colorado&#x27;s New Opera Works presented Act I of the opera in June 2012, directed by Beth Greenberg.

==Commemorations==
===Memorial===
In 1916, the United Mine Workers of America bought the site of the Ludlow tent colony. Two years later, they erected the Ludlow Monument to commemorate those who died during the strike. It was fabricated by the Jones Brothers Company of Barre, Vermont using local granite and was commissioned by Sam Falsetto, president of the United Mine Workers of Trinidad, Colorado. The Springfield Granite Company served as the contractor. The monument was damaged in May 2003 by unknown vandals. The repaired monument was unveiled on June 5, 2005, with slightly altered faces on the statues.

===National Historic Landmark===
The tent colony site was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1985, was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark in 2009. Although the area continued to be occupied by mine workers and their families after the events of May 1914, they relocated, leaving the original encampment site relatively undisturbed. The site is consequently one of the best-preserved archaeological remains of such an encampment, and the monument is one of the earliest to commemorate a labor action of this type. The site is the first of its kind to be investigated by archeologists.

On May 7, 2003, vandals attacked the monument cutting off the solid granite/marble head of the male figure and the arm of the female figure. The missing parts were never recovered but replaced in 2005 with funding from private donations.

===Centennial===
On April 19, 2013, Colorado Governor John Hickenlooper signed an executive order to create the Ludlow Centennial Commemoration Commission. The group worked to develop programming in the state, such as lectures and exhibits, to commemorate the Ludlow workers&#x27; struggle and raise awareness of the massacre. It worked with Colorado museums, historical societies, churches and art galleries, and supplied programming in 2014.

==Historical investigation==
===Archaeology===
In 1996, the 1913–1914 Colorado Coalfield War Project began under the leadership of Randall H. McGuire of Binghamton University, Dean Saitta of University of Denver, and Philip Duke of Fort Lewis College, who later formed the Ludlow Collective. Their team conducted excavations of the territory of the former tent colony and surrounding areas.

<doc id="249187" wikidata="Q3752543" url="?curid=249187" title="Robert April">
<text>Robert April is a fictional character in the &quot;Star Trek&quot; media franchise. April was the USS &quot;Enterprise&quot;&#x27;s first commanding officer, preceding Captain Christopher Pike.

The character first appeared in the &quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; episode &quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot; (1974), in which he is voiced by James Doohan. April&#x27;s first live-action appearance was in the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022), in which he is portrayed by Adrian Holmes.

==Development and casting==
A prison chaplain named &quot;Robert April&quot; appears in two episodes of &quot;Have Gun – Will Travel&quot; (1957–63), for which &quot;Star Trek&quot; creator Gene Roddenberry wrote. The name stuck with Roddenberry, and &quot;Robert M. April&quot; commanded the starship &quot;Yorktown&quot; in his 1964 &quot;Star Trek&quot; proposal to CBS. The captain&#x27;s name was changed to &quot;Christopher Pike&quot; when NBC accepted the &quot;Star Trek&quot; project later that year.

Fred Bronson (writing as John Culver) came up with the idea of the &quot;Enterprise&quot; having a captain who preceded Pike for &quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot;. He selected the name &quot;Robert April&quot; from Roddenberry&#x27;s original list of possible &quot;Enterprise&quot; captain names.

During the development of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, Adrian Holmes submitted two taped auditions for the role. Producer Henry Alonso Myers said Holmes had the gravitas to play April, who is &quot;mythic&quot; by virtue of being the first captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

==Depiction==
=== Television ===
====&quot;Star Trek: The Animated Series&quot; (1974)====
In &quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot;, the &quot;Enterprise&quot; crew begins to rapidly age in reverse. The old age of Commodore April and his wife Sarah (voiced by Nichelle Nichols) affords them more time at maturity, allowing them to save the crew and undo the reverse aging process.

====&quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot; (2022)====
In the pilot episode of &quot;Star Trek: Strange New Worlds&quot;, April (now an Admiral) orders Captain Pike, in command of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;, on a rescue mission. Although Pike violates General Order 1 on the mission, April uses his influence with Starfleet Command to keep Pike from being charged.

==== References ====
April is listed as one of Starfleet&#x27;s most decorated officers in the &quot;Star Trek: Discovery&quot; episode &quot;Choose Your Pain&quot; (2017), along with Jonathan Archer, Matthew Decker (&quot;The Doomsday Machine&quot;), Philippa Georgiou, and Christopher Pike. In the second season&#x27;s &quot;Brother&quot; (2019), Pike states that he was April&#x27;s first officer aboard the &quot;Enterprise&quot;.

=== Literature ===
April appears in the novels &quot;Final Frontier&quot; (1988) and &quot;Best Destiny&quot; (1992) by Diane Carey as the captain of the &quot;Enterprise&quot;. Carey&#x27;s version of April comes from Coventry, and he wears cardigan sweaters over his uniform due to a blood disorder that causes him to feel slightly chilly most of the time. Lacking a &quot;live action&quot; image of April, designer and author Michael Okuda created a collage of Roddenberry&#x27;s head on William Shatner&#x27;s body to illustrate April in &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot; (1994). April is militaristic in the &quot;Star Trek: Early Voyages&quot; comics (1997–1998), and another timeline&#x27;s version of April appears in a comic prologue to &quot;Star Trek Into Darkness&quot;, &quot;Countdown to Darkness&quot; (2013).

== Reception ==
Timothy Donohoo, writing for CBR.com, said Robert April &quot;had elements of both Kirk and Pike&quot;, noting that he was heroic but also faced with self-doubt about his leadership. He said the character concept was &quot;revolutionary in many ways&quot; because &quot;the idea of the hero doubting himself and questioning his own actions&quot; was rare in that era&#x27;s movie and television scripts.

&quot;The Counter-Clock Incident&quot; writer Fred Bronson thanked Adrian Holmes for &quot;bring[ing April] to life&quot; in &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot;. Michael Okuda, who created the photo-collage depiction of April for &quot;The Star Trek Encyclopedia&quot;, also commended Holmes&#x27;s casting. Keith DeCandido said outcry over casting a dark-skinned actor as April, having been previously depicted with light skin in animation and print, &quot;has served as a nice way of revealing the racists among &quot;Trek&quot; fans&quot;. &quot;Screen Rant&quot; said April&#x27;s re-envisioning &quot;does not disappoint&quot; and is &quot;part of the fun&quot; of &quot;Strange New Worlds&quot; reiterating on 1960s-era &quot;Star Trek&quot; characters.

<text>The Generation Game is a British game show produced by the BBC in which four teams of two people from the same family, but different generations, compete to win prizes.

==The game==
There are eight competitors, hence the catchphrase &quot;Let&#x27;s meet the eight who are going to generate&quot; used in earlier series by Bruce Forsyth. The couples were a generation apart and in later series, but not originally, of different genders. Most of the time it was mother/son, father/daughter. Sometimes aunt/nephew and uncle/niece played. In the first two rounds, two couples compete against each other in two games. One game usually involves first seeing a skilled professional construct or perform something, such as pottery or dancing. The contestants attempt to do the same, and a score is given by the professional. The other game usually involves more of a quiz element, such as identifying pieces of music. At the end of each of the first two rounds, the couple with the lower score is eliminated.

The two highest-scoring couples compete against each other in the final (or End Game, as Larry Grayson referred to it). This is often a big set-piece performance; in the series presented by Forsyth it was usually a drama or farce (in which many elements were deliberately choreographed to go wrong in order to generate more comedy), in later programmes a musical or dance performance. The couple that scores the highest go through to the final &#x27;conveyor belt&#x27;. Originally, this was scored the same way in the first rounds, but when Davidson took over, the winner was decided by an audience vote, apart from in his penultimate series when the winner was decided on points scored.

At the end of the show, one member (both members during the second Forsyth era) of the victorious team watches prizes pass on a conveyor belt, and wins as many as could be recalled in 45 seconds (20 seconds per teammate during the second Forsyth era), with some items awarding a bonus prize if the contestant or team recalls that item. In both the first Forsyth era and the Grayson era, a short quiz between the two team members decided who would play the conveyor belt, whilst in the Davidson era, the winning team decided themselves on who would play.

A trademark of the show is that a cuddly toy is always among the prizes. This led to an affectionate joke: &quot;Dinner service...fondue set...Cuddly toy! Cuddly toy!&quot;, which is sometimes quoted when the show is mentioned. The audience and the host shout out the names of the prizes, especially in later series, allowing the contestants to carry away large numbers of items. In the fifth series of Davidson&#x27;s run, an added twist involved four prizes being referred to as &quot;phantom prizes&quot;, if the contestant was to mention those, gunge would be hurled at them every time one was recalled.

In the Jim Davidson run, if contestants correctly recalled 15 of the 20 prizes in 45 (later 60) seconds, they won everything and the star prize, which was a holiday. In Davidson&#x27;s final two series, each point scored by the winning team became one second. Another feature o|f the 1999-2000 Davidson series was that if a contestant correctly recalled a &quot;Phantom&quot; prize, they would be gunged with that item.

==History==
===1971–1977: Origins and first Bruce Forsyth era===
The show is based on the Dutch TV show &quot;Één van de acht&quot; (&quot;One of the Eight&quot;), the format devised in 1969 by Theo Uittenbogaard for VARA Television. Mies Bouwman, a Dutch talk show host and presenter of the show, came up with the idea of the conveyor belt. She had seen it on a German programme and wanted to incorporate it into the show.

Another antecedent for the game show was &quot;Sunday Night at the London Palladium&quot; on ATV, which had a game called Beat the Clock, taken from an American game show of the same name. It featured married couples playing silly games within a certain time to win prize money. This was hosted by Bruce Forsyth from 1958, and he took the idea with him when he went over to the BBC.

During the 1970s, game shows became more popular and started to replace expensive variety shows. As a result, many variety performers were recruited for game shows. The BBC, suffering poor ratings, decided to make its own game show. Bill Cotton, the BBC&#x27;s Head of Light Entertainment, believed that Forsyth was best for the job. For years, &quot;The Generation Game&quot; was one of the strongest shows in the BBC&#x27;s Saturday night line-up, and became the number-one game show on British television during the 1970s, regularly gaining over 21 million viewers. Its theme song &quot;Life Is The Name Of The Game&quot; was written and sung by Forsyth, and later released on record.

===1978–1982: Larry Grayson era===
In the mid-1970s London Weekend Television recruited Forsyth to host &quot;The Big Night&quot; on Saturdays. Alan Boyd, producer of &quot;The Generation Game&quot; at the time, remembers that there were many proposals as to who should take over, with Bill Cotton having a brief discussion with his favoured choice, Cilla Black, who would not consider the move; other names mentioned included Jimmy Tarbuck and Kenneth Williams. However, he felt he did not want the new programme to be compared to Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;Generation Game&quot;, so he cast Larry Grayson, with a new theme tune, which incorporated Grayson&#x27;s &quot;shut that door&quot; catchphrase. There was also new scenery, and a new co-host, Isla St Clair. It worked, as &quot;The Big Night&quot; failed to beat &quot;The Generation Game&quot; in viewing figures and was off the air within three months.

The show reached its peak under Grayson. It attracted an audience of 25 million on one occasion, when the 1979 ITV strike broke out. Grayson&#x27;s apparent incompetence and inability to remember what was going on was carefully contrived. In 1980, a junior version was considered, to be titled &quot;The Younger Generation Game&quot;, with two young siblings of different ages in place of older contestants. It was not confirmed whether Grayson would have hosted this proposed spin-off version, and it ultimately was never commissioned.

===Cancellation===
By the early 1980s, &quot;The Generation Game&quot; was being beaten by ITV&#x27;s &quot;Game for a Laugh&quot;. The show continued through to the end of 1981, but shortly after a highlights episode from the last series aired on 3 January 1982, Grayson decided to quit whilst the show was still popular. The BBC approached Jimmy Tarbuck to present the show, but he turned it down. The series was later cancelled.

===1990–2002 revival: Second Bruce Forsyth and Jim Davidson eras===
&quot;The Generation Game&quot; returned in September 1990 with the original host, Bruce Forsyth, and his new hostess, Rosemarie Ford. After leaving the show for a second time in 1994 to move to ITV, Forsyth was replaced by Jim Davidson, who had previously stood in on an edition when Forsyth was unwell. The show became more lively and chaotic during the Davidson era, introducing characters such as Mr Blobby, comedy sketches, and gunge similarly seen on Tiswas, with appearances from the Phantom Flan Flinger. Davidson&#x27;s hostesses were Sally Meen, Melanie Stace and Lea Kristensen. This incarnation ended in April 2002, after again being beaten by ITV, this time by &quot;Pop Idol&quot;. Davidson had announced in March that he was quitting the show. The series ended the following month.

===Later revivals===
====2003–2005: Paul O&#x27;Grady pilots and Graham Norton special====
The BBC were planning on reviving the show with Paul O&#x27;Grady as its new presenter in 2004. Filming two non-broadcast pilot episodes in 2003, both O&#x27;Grady and the production team were unhappy with the result, with O&#x27;Grady leaving the project. Graham Norton hosted a one-off special at Christmas 2005 featuring celebrity contestants Kelly Holmes, Davina McCall, Rupert Grint and James Fleet; this was titled &quot;Generation Fame&quot;.

====2007 retrospective====
&quot;The Generation Game&quot; returned with original host Forsyth in 2007 under the title &quot;Brucie&#x27;s Generation Game: Now and Then&quot;, broadcast on UKTV Gold. This version was a retrospective of earlier editions, similar to the digital channel&#x27;s &quot;Wogan&quot; and &quot;Jim&#x27;ll Fix It&quot; revivals around the same time.

====2011: David Walliams&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;====
In 2011, a version of the show featured as part of David Walliams&#x27;s &quot;24 Hour Panel People&quot;, a charity marathon of game shows for Comic Relief. Walliams competed with his mother Kathleen. The other team consisted of Miranda Hart and Patricia Hodge, who play mother and daughter in the sitcom &quot;Miranda&quot;. Vernon Kay presented the episode.

====2014–2015: Miranda Hart discussions====
On 20 April 2014, it was announced that comedian Miranda Hart (who appeared on the 2011 charity special) was in &quot;early talks&quot; with the BBC about hosting a revived version of the show. A pilot episode was filmed before Christmas that year, but the controller of the channel, Charlotte Moore, revealed in August 2015 that the project was &quot;very much on hold&quot; due to Hart wanting to concentrate on her acting and writing career.

====2017–2018: Mel and Sue====
On 11 May 2017, it was reported that Mel and Sue were linked to host a reboot for the BBC as part of a package for not staying with &quot;The Great British Bake Off&quot; after its move to Channel 4. On 23 July 2017, it was confirmed that Mel and Sue would host. However, on 7 February 2018, two episodes instead of the planned four were confirmed, with the BBC saying &quot;During the production process it&#x27;s not unusual for a new series to change length as the format evolves&quot;.

The first episode aired on BBC One on 1 April 2018. It received generally poor reviews from TV critics: Gerard O&#x27;Donovan from &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; gave it one star, writing: &quot;...There&#x27;s little to say other than that it was a shameless carbon copy of memorable moments from &quot;The Generation Game&quot; of the 1970s or 80s.&quot; Carol Midgley of &quot;The Times&quot; gave it two stars, saying: &quot;It needs to relax and dial down the gush. Brucie made it look so easy. Didn&#x27;t he do well?&quot; The &quot;i (newspaper)&quot; newspaper&#x27;s Jeff Robinson said the show &quot;felt forced and scripted, another territory for the Mel and Sue brand to colonise post-&quot;Bake Off&quot; rather than an original updating of an old format.&quot; Sam Wollaston of &quot;The Guardian&quot; was more positive, giving it three stars and writing: &quot;Somehow, it manages to be both a little bit glorious and groansome to the max at the same time.&quot;

==Catchphrases==

The show introduced a number of catchphrases, including Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s &quot;Didn&#x27;t he/she/they do well?&quot;, &quot;Let&#x27;s meet the eight who are going to generate&quot; and &quot;Let&#x27;s have a look at the old scoreboard&quot;. Later, when the show was revived, Forsyth&#x27;s assistant was Rosemarie Ford, so the catchphrase was amended to &quot;What&#x27;s on the board, Miss Ford?&quot; (originally &quot;What have they scored, Miss Ford?&quot;). Forsyth always opened the show with &quot;Good evening Ladies Gentlemen and Children welcome to the Generation Game, it&#x27;s Nice to see you, to see you ...&quot; to which the audience would shout &quot;Nice!&quot;, a catchphrase that Forsyth retained in his later television appearances. Others included &quot;Good game, good game,&quot; &quot;I hope you&#x27;re playing this at home,&quot; and &quot;Give us a twirl,&quot; which was said to hostess Anthea Redfern to show off her dress.

Grayson supplied his own catchphrases, including &quot;Shut that door!&quot;, &quot;What a gay day!&quot; and &quot;Seems like a nice boy!&quot; Scores were preceded by &quot;What are the scores on the doors?&quot; to which St Clair would reply &quot;The names in the frames say...&quot; before announcing them. After the conveyor belt finale, Grayson would say &quot;What a lot you&#x27;ve got... you have got a lot!&quot; but he abandoned this after his second season as it did not register with the public. Grayson and St Clair apparently had a strong bond; Grayson always introduced her at the start of each show as &quot;my lovely Isla&quot; and &quot;my favourite girl, my Saturday girl.&quot; She once referred to them as being &quot;like a couple of naughty sisters.&quot;

Jim Davidson would later present but no real catchphrases were used; however, he made a running gag acknowledging this and tried out several &#x27;potential catchphrases&#x27;.

==Hostesses==
Each host of &quot;The Generation Game&quot; was joined by a female hostess, who brought the contestants on stage, handed out the prizes and often joined in the games. The first was Anthea Redfern, who began an affair with host Forsyth and married him during the series&#x27; run. When she was absent on maternity leave, actress Jenny Lee Wright stood in for a number of shows. Isla St. Clair was Grayson&#x27;s hostess throughout his tenure on the show. Rosemarie Ford supported Forsyth on his second stint as host. Sally Meen, Melanie Stace and Lea Kristensen were Davidson&#x27;s hostesses.

==Merchandise==

===Board games===
In 1975, Strawberry Fayre and Denys Fisher published a board game (simply called &quot;Generation Game&quot; with host Bruce Forsyth on the cover) featuring a three-dimensional diorama of the set, a working countdown clock and the famous sliding doors.

In 1990, Rainbow Games published another board game (only this time as &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Generation Game&quot; still with Forsyth on the cover).

===Books===
In 1992, a book called &quot;Bruce Forsyth&#x27;s Generation Game Book: Games, Quizzes, and D-I-Y (Do It Yourself) Fun for All the Family&quot; was published by Vermillion. 

==International versions==
In addition to the original Dutch version and long-running British version, Rudi Carrell hosted the German version &quot;&quot; from 1974 to 1979 on Das Erste. There was also a Swedish version, &quot;Tjocka Släkten&quot;, presented by Lasse Berghagen and Inga Gill from 1990 to 1991, and a French version, &quot;Salut les artites&quot;, presented by Georges Beller and Krystina Ferentz in 1993. In 2008 a South African version of the show was made, hosted by comedian Barry Hilton together with actress/presenter Cindy Nkabinde on channel SABC 2.

<doc id="249192" wikidata="Q6414" url="?curid=249192" title="Lake Garda">
<text>Lake Garda (, , or , ; ; ) is the largest lake in Italy. It is a popular holiday location in northern Italy, between Brescia and Milan to the west, and Verona and Venice to the east. The lake cuts into the edge of the Italian Alps, particularly the Alpine sub-ranges of the Garda Mountains and the Brenta Group. Glaciers formed this alpine region at the end of the last ice age. The lake and its shoreline are divided between the provinces of Brescia (to the south-west), Verona (south-east) and Trentino (north).

==Etymology==
In Roman times the lake was known as &quot;Benacus&quot; and by some it was revered as god Benacus, the personification of the lake, sometimes associated with the cult of Neptune. Today it is better known as Lake Garda, a toponym of Germanic origin attested since the Middle Ages and deriving from that of the homonymous town on the Veronese shore of the lake, which, together with another famous locality of the lake, Gardone Riviera, and others less known – such as Gàrdola, Gardoncino, Gardoni, Guàrdola and Le Garde – testifies to the Germanic presence in the area that dated from the 6th to the 8th century CE, in particular, the Lombard one. The name &quot;Garda&quot; is evolved from the Germanic word &quot;warda&quot;, meaning &quot;place of guard&quot;, &quot;place of observation&quot; or &quot;place of safety&quot;.

The classic toponym of the lake, or &quot;Benācus lacus&quot; (&quot;Benaco&quot;), is almost certainly of Celtic origin, therefore prior to romanization, and should derive from &quot;bennacus&quot;, comparable with the Irish &quot;bennach&quot;, which means &quot;horned&quot;. The term may derive from the many promontories of the lake.

== Geography ==
===Morphology and hydrography===
The northern part of the lake is located in a depression that insinuates itself inside the Alps, while the southern part occupies an area of the upper Pianura Padana. The shape is typical of a moraine valley, probably having been formed under the action of a Paleolithic glacier. Although traces of the glacier&#x27;s actions are evident today, in more recent years it has been hypothesised that the glacier occupied a previously existing depression, created by stream erosion 5 to 6 million years ago.

A characteristic of Garda is the limited size of the hydrographic basin () compared to the lake surface: at a length of of the lake corresponds the of the basin, while the respective widths are and . The eastern watershed of the Benacense basin has a direction parallel to the axis of the lake, while the western one has a more sinuous course. Within the basin, the major peaks are Presanella () and Adamello (). Morphologically, the Garda hydrographic basin can be divided into four areas: the plain of about , the lake surface of about , the western portion of about 500 km2 and the eastern one of approximately .

To the south of Lake Garda, between Brescia, Mantua and Verona, a large morainic amphitheatre develops: a succession of hilly circles with small flat areas interposed, in some cases marshy, originated thanks to the transport and storage action of the great Garda glacier. These morainic deposits were formed during the glaciations Günz, Mindel, Riss and Würm: very limited morainic deposits are attributed to the two oldest, Günz and Mindel, while the outer morainic circles are attributed to the Riss glaciation and the inner ones to the Würm glaciation. The morphology of the hills is gentle and with delicate lines; from the highest points, it is possible to perceive the relationships that link the hills to the mountains as well as the circular amphitheatre shape of the hills, which seem to embrace the southern part of the lake.

The main tributary of Lake Garda is the Sarca River, others include the Ponale River (fed by Lago di Ledro), the (via the Cascate del Varone) and various streams from both mountainsides, while the only outlet is the Mincio River (, at Peschiera). The subdivision is created by the presence of a fault submerged between Sirmione and Punta San Vigilio which is almost a natural barrier that hampers the homogenization between the water of the two zones.

If the water level of the Adige River is excessive, water is diverted to the lake through the Mori-Torbole tunnel.

===Geology===
The Lake Garda area is considered one of the most seismic in Italy. The oldest known earthquake that struck the Garda region seems to have occurred in 243 (or perhaps 245): it was so disastrous that the city of Benaco, located where Toscolano Maderno stands today, suddenly disappeared. The disappearance of the town is probably due to the cracking and landslide of the mountain above Toscolano, which caused the flooding of a small lake enclosed by the mountains, whose waters submerged the populous town.

Other earthquakes, more or less intense, followed one another periodically: in 793, when according to the chroniclers it caused great calamities, especially in the Baldo area; in 1457, during which a mountain above Salò lowered; in 1703, when it caused the fall of numerous houses and caused many victims; in 1810, an earthquake particularly hit Malcesine where it caused a clouding of the waters and the formation of a crack long and wide in the town square; in 1836, when the tremors caused some landslides in Mount Tomè, in the northernmost part of Monte Baldo, which in turn caused a strong eruption of water.

In 1866 a rather long period of seismic agitation began in the Baldo area, with earthquakes of varying intensity, tremors, shaking and other phenomena of lesser importance, which saw as the most important event the earthquake of 5 January 1892, which shook the entire Garda region with extraordinary violence, causing the fall of chimneys and walls.

Other earthquakes more recently hit Salò and its surroundings, in particular, the earthquake of 31 October 1901 caused widespread damage to buildings, some collapses and cracks in the ground, while another earthquake in 2004 caused damage to some buildings.

===Islands===
The lake has also numerous small islands and five main ones, the largest being Isola del Garda. Nearby to the south is San Biagio island, also known as the Isola dei Conigli (&quot;island of the rabbits&quot;). Both are offshore of San Felice del Benaco, on the lake&#x27;s western side. The three other main islands are Isola dell&#x27;Olivo, Isola di Sogno, and Isola di Trimelone, all farther north near the eastern side.

===Climate===
The particularly mild climate favours the growth of some hardy Mediterranean plants, including the olive tree, parasol pine, mediterranean cypress, chinese windmill palm and Canary Island Date Palm. Some hardy citrus trees, such as hardy lemons and satsuma can also be found, which are extremely rare at this latitude (46° North). In ancient times, poets like Catullus wrote about &quot;Lacus Benacus&quot; with its mild climate vivified by the winds. The lake is oriented from north to south towards the Po Valley, so many winds typical of the lake are the result of a difference between lower and higher altitude temperatures. Due to this, winds are generated that descend from the mountains to the plains in the morning and go back to the mountains in the afternoon. The bottleneck formed by the lake basin affects the timing of the winds, many of which happen on a regular daily basis. The winds are all named, most in regional Italian dialect so a single wind may have different names.

===Fauna and flora===
Lake Garda is rich in biodiversity. &quot;Salmo carpio&quot;, also known as the carpione (&quot;carpione del Garda&quot; or &quot;Lake Garda carpione&quot;) is a rare salmonid fish endemic to Lake Garda. It has been introduced to a number of other lakes in Italy and elsewhere but unsuccessfully in all cases. The population in Lake Garda has been strongly declining, and is considered critically endangered (IUCN 3.1). The main threats are due to overfishing, pollution and possibly competition from introduced species such as Coregonus and other Salmonidae.

Adult lake trout outside the mating season are silvery with very few black spots on the body and almost none on the head. During the mating season, some males develop a dark mottled body colouration. Garda lake trout reach a length of up to . They live primarily in depths of . They feed on zooplankton and bottom-dwelling crustaceans in summer. Males and females reach sexual maturity at two or three years. The mating takes place every one to two years. The spawning takes place in depth in the vicinity of underwater springs. The maximum age is five years.

Areas around Lake Garda, inhabited since prehistoric times, are an environment of great naturalistic value, with vegetation typical of the Mediterranean climate such as olive trees, vines, lemon trees, agave and other plants, which thrive thanks to the microclimate created by the Garda basin, which makes winter particularly mild. During the spring wildflowers such as primroses, iris, violets and red lilies are born, while in summer some bloom varieties of wild orchids. Thanks to the presence of protected areas, hares and small wild mammals, water birds and birds of prey survive, while ponds and ditches are populated by pike, carp and eels. The herds of cattle, horses and other domestic animals give a bucolic aspect to the hilly landscape.

== History ==
Traces of human presence around the lake have been found related to the Middle Paleolithic, in particular flint tools, but only above certain altitudes, as at lower altitudes, the actions of the glaciers have cancelled all the clues that could have proved the presence of man. There are some signs of encampments from Upper Paleolithic, in particular on the slopes of Monte Baldo and Stivo. In the Neolithic the populations that inhabited the lake came into contact with the square-mouthed vases culture, as evidenced by the objects accompanying some tombs from this period found near Arco.

===Bronze and Iron ages===
The greatest evidence of human presence in prehistoric times dates back to the Bronze Age, when numerous aggregates of stilt houses arose in the lower lake before being abandoned during the Iron Age in favour of more strategic points. Lake Garda was a meeting point between the populations of Reti and Veneti, whose presence is testified in particular by the necropolis of Garda, as well as that of the Etruscans who came to trade in these areas. Also plausible is the presence of the Cenomani, who would have settled in the area between Brescia and the lake around the 6th century BC, leaving their traces mostly in the Lombard toponymy.

===Roman times===

The integration between Romans and Cenomani, who controlled the Garda area, probably began in 225 BC, when there was a treaty of alliance between Cenomani, Veneti and Romans, even if the actual Romanization of the territory took place between the 2nd and 1st centuries BC. In 89 BC the rights of Latin cities were granted to the Garda areas by the will of the Roman consul Gnaeus Pompeius Strabo, while forty years later Roman citizenship was finally granted to Brixia (whose countryside included the western and northern banks of the Benaco) and Verona (which instead included the eastern shore). During the 1st century AD many roads were built, such as the &quot;via Gallica&quot;, which connected Verona to Milan passing through Peschiera (the ancient &quot;Arilica&quot;), and the &quot;via Claudia Augusta&quot;, which connected the plain with the Resia pass and therefore the northernmost territories, as well as some minor roads that connected the Adige valley with the Garda. Two &quot;pagi&quot; were also established: &quot;pagus Benacenses&quot; on Brescia and &quot;pagus Claudienses&quot; on Verona.

In 268 AD the Battle of Lake Benacus was fought between the army of the Roman Empire, commanded by the future emperor Claudius Gothicus, and the German federation of the Alamanni. The overwhelming victory obtained by the Romans allowed the expulsion of Alemanni from northern Italy, due to the very serious losses they suffered during the battle.

The Roman presence is amply testified also by settlements, villas (in particular the notes Grottoes of Catullus), by the remains of centuriation still visible today, by the remains of sanctuaries, tombstones and epigraphic testimonies.

===Middle Ages===
In the Middle Ages Lake Garda was described by Dante in his &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;:
After the collapse of the Roman Empire, the Garda region witnessed the passage of numerous Germanic populations, but the first one that settled there, after a long migration, was that of the Lombards. Their testimonies are mostly present along the southern and eastern shores, preferred to other areas due to their strategic importance: from here it was possible to control both the waterways of Garda and Mincio, and the Adige valley. During the Lombard hegemony, there was a first administrative reorganization, as well as the definitive Christianization of the area, begun in the previous centuries by Vigilius of Trent and Zeno of Verona. The lake remained on the border between three powerful Lombard duchies: Brescia, Verona and Trento.

The first documents that testify the presence of a &quot;Fines Gardenses&quot;, an entity with its own officials for the administration of justice, even if not autonomous with respect to the Count of Verona, date back to 825, while after the year 1000 county of Garda was established by the emperor Henry II. Starting from the 11th century, towns around the lake began to develop a differentiated policy compared to that of the major centres of influence – Brescia, Verona and Trento – and this greater autonomy meant that many centres became free communities. These possessed comfortable economic conditions compared to the inland countries and a strong social awareness and sense of community.

In the 13th century, however, the Signoria Scaligera was established and it soon subdued the eastern shore of the lake. The Scaliger built numerous defensive constructions, in particular, they built the castles of Sirmione, Malcesine and Riva, reinforced the port structures of Lazise and Torri del Benaco, and built a great defense system called &quot;Serraglio&quot;, the only one of its kind in Italy. This fortified system, completed by Cangrande II in 1355, included isolated castles in Ponti sul Mincio and Monzambano, serious continuous and uninterrupted castles and towers connected by defensive walls starting from the fortress of Valeggio sul Mincio and then continuing up to Nogarole Rocca. The Seraglio remained practically intact until the mid-19th century when it was partially dismantled.

===Early modern history===
In 1387, following the defeat of Antonio della Scala, the whole Garda area was subjected to the Visconti; as early as 1405 the eastern shore passed into the hands of the Republic of Venice, while the western shore remained afflicted by the struggles between Guelphs and Ghibellines. In 1426 the Visconti lost Brescia and the western shore of the lake, which thus passed into the hands of Venice: gathered under the flag of the Republic of Venice, the 34 Benacense municipalities obtained ample autonomy. The war returned in 1438, due to the struggle between Venice and Milan: an exceptional event, remembered with the name of &quot;Galeas per montes&quot;, was the passage of a fleet composed of six galleys and twenty-five ships on the slopes of Monte Baldo, pulled by 2,000 oxen. This fleet sailed on Adige and almost reached Rovereto, from where it was transported to Lake Garda by land through the valley of Lake Loppio. The fleet was then used to counter the Milanese one and had its greatest success in a battle at Riva del Garda, which was followed by the capitulation of the city.

In 1508 the League of Cambrai was formed against the Serenissima: Venice strengthened the castles of its mainland domains, including those of Salò and Padenghe, and sent several galleys to the lake, as well as having new ones built directly on Lake Garda. During the war the Venetians lost part of their domains which were however recovered in 1512. In 1516 emperor Maximilian I came to Italy and the lake returned to German hands again, allowing the Serenissima to recover the lost territories.

In 1796 the territories of the Serenissima were involved in the Napoleonic wars: at the end of May, the French advanced to the lake and defeated the Austrians at Borghetto sul Mincio, conquering Peschiera. At the end of July, the French were defeated and had to retreat beyond Salò, which was then occupied by the Austrians. Numerous clashes took place between the adversaries on the battlefield of Lake Garda. In 1797 the French occupied Mantua, while Brescia valleys and towns on the lake rose up against the Napoleonic forces, even if the Republic of Venice maintained its neutral status and did not send aid to rescue. The Veronese, on the other hand, autonomously organized expeditions against the centres occupied by the French, but were defeated and forced to retreat to Verona, where on 17 April the anti-French insurrections called &quot;Pasque Veronesi&quot; (&quot;Pasque Veronesi&quot;) began. &quot;. On 17 October the Treaty of Campoformio was signed: the southwestern shores went to the French, while the north-eastern ones went to the Austrians. In 1799 the war continued until the following year the lake returned to French hands: it became part of the Cisalpine Republic (later transformed into Italian Republic and then again in Kingdom of Italy, always under French control.

In 1815 following the definitive defeat of Napoleon Bonaparte, during the Congress of Vienna it was decided to create the Kingdom of Lombardy–Venetia: in this way, the whole Garda region returned to Austrian hands.

The First Italian War of Independence saw an initial slow advance of the Piedmontese army towards the lake: at the news of its approach, Salò rebelled against the Austrians, several soldiers were taken prisoner and the Austrian insignia demolished. During the events also Riva del Garda and several towns on the Veronese side rose up. The Austrian army was forced to retreat to the Mincio line due to the advance of the Piedmontese troops and on 4 April the Austrians were driven out of Lonato and Desenzano, while the Piedmontese attempt to conquer Peschiera was unsuccessful. After the Piedmontese defeat of Custoza the pre-war &quot;status quo&quot; was restored. In 1859 the Second War of Independence began; on 18 June the Hunters of the Alps managed to enter Salò, from where Giuseppe Garibaldi wanted to leave to continue the advance towards Veneto crossing the lake with some boats, but new orders forced him to move the troops in the Brescia valleys. However, the Italian troops managed to sink an Austrian steamship before leaving Salò. Shortly after the battle of Solferino and San Martino was won by the Franco-Savoyards and Peschiera was besieged. With the armistice of Villafranca the war was put to an end: Garda returned to be a land border, on this occasion between Italians and Austrians. During the Third War of Independence Garibaldi returned to Salò again and from there he invaded Trentino. Meanwhile, the Austrians repeatedly bombarded Gargnano and tried to impose their dominance. Despite the humiliating Italian defeat, in 1866 Veneto was finally handed over to the Kingdom of Italy, except for the northern part of the lake which still remained under Austrian control.
During the First World War towns on Lake Garda were attacked by aerial bombardment several times. The first took place on 23 July 1915, when Riva del Garda was hit. The steamers of the lake were requisitioned by the Italian army and were re-equipped as warships. The following year some guns and artillery batteries were installed, but on 20 February 1916, Riva was hit again by air. The following day three Austrian planes bombed Desenzano, while on 27 February bombs fell in Nago and Torbole. In 1918 Riva was bombed again. Later Limone and, once again, Riva were targeted, but with the end of the war, Trentino was also passed into Italian hands.

In the period between the two wars the poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio settled in Gardone Riviera, where the &quot;Vittoriale degli Italiani&quot;, his residence and now a museum, would later be built.

Until 1943 the events of Second World War did not particularly affect the lake region, but following the birth of the Italian Social Republic (a German puppet state and Fascist Italian rump state), the German command settled in Limone and, on 10 October, that of Benito Mussolini in Gargnano. The Ministry of Defense was located in Desenzano; the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Popular Culture and the press agencies settled in Salò, which became the capital of the newborn Fascist Italy. At the end, Mussolini was strung up on a lamppost in his Lake Garda enclave.

Fasano was the seat of the German embassy and Gardone of the Japanese one, while the Ministry of the Interior and the seat of the Republican Fascist Party (PFR) found accommodation in Maderno. The upper part of the lake was also occupied militarily by the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot;. In April 1945 the lake was freed by the Allies and later became part of the Republic of Italy. The award-winning documentary film The Lost Mountaineers looks at the tragic events that happened in the last days of the war in northern Lake Garda.

== Myth and legend ==
According to the Greco-Roman mythology, the River Mincius was the child of the Lake Benacus.

In ancient German Sagas, Garda was home to Ortnit.

== Towns and villages on the lake ==
Around Lake Garda there are 26 &quot;comuni&quot;, the most populated being Desenzano del Garda (29,179 inhabitants), followed by Arco (17,857) and Riva del Garda (17,518).

==Economy==
===Tourism===

Garda&#x27;s economy is mostly depended on tourism. Back to Roman times, especially from the early imperial age, magnificent villas were present on the shores of the lake, conceived as places dedicated to &quot;otium&quot;, an activity actually reserved for the ruling classes. In particular Sirmione was a privileged place for the presence of sulphurous springs that allowed thermal use. Starting from the Renaissance the lake returned to be populated with noble villas.

Tourism in the modern conception of the term, however, developed from the end of the 19th century, even if it was still an élite tourism that concerned almost exclusively the north-western area of the lake. One of the first tourist resorts was Gardone Riviera, where the first small hotel was built. Expanded over time, it became one of the buildings that made up the luxurious Grand Hotel Gardone Riviera. In its vicinity other small hotels and villas slowly arose and, after the poet Gabriele D&#x27;Annunzio had the Vittoriale degli Italiani built here, the fame of the place grew further.

On the Veronese shore, tourism arrived much later, around the 1930s, when the current &quot;Strada Gardesana Orientale&quot; was built along the shores of the lake. With the arrival of tourists, &quot;lakeside promenades&quot; were planned. Since the 1950s tourism has undergone a sort of transformation: tourism with a long stay has been accompanied by &quot;hit and run&quot; tourism, with a short stop, just for the weekend or even for a few hours. The first is fed by tourists who want to spend their holidays on the lake, coming from different areas (in addition to Italians, numerous Germans, French, Swiss and Dutch), while the second is fed by those who live a short distance from the lake and who want to spend a few hours there. Both types of tourism have caused notable changes in the organization of the territory and the inhabited centres.

Furthermore, in the second half of the 20th century, a real entertainment industry was formed along Lake Garda as a series of parks were built. The most important is Gardaland, the biggest Italian theme park which hosts numerous tourist attractions.

Lake Garda is also a popular destination for sport tourism. Riva, Torbole and Campione are famous for winds that attract people who practice sail, windsurf and kiteboard. The Centomiglia Regatta is also sailed there every year.

== Transport ==

=== Ferries ===

Ship transport is provided by Navigazione Laghi. A daily ferry service connects major towns on the eastern and western shores of Lake Garda. The service runs from Desenzano del Garda to Riva del Garda, via Peschiera del Garda, Salò and Malcesine.

=== Railway ===
The region can be reached directly via the Milan-Venice railway, with Desenzano-Sirmione and Peschiera railway station.

=== Buses ===

Buses are faster alternatives to ferry services. On the eastern coast, ATV (Verona Transport Company) provides at least five daily bus routes between Verona and Garda, with one route extending to Riva del Garda. Trentino Transporti provides daily bus routes between Riva del Garda and Rovereto or Trento. On the western coast, SAIA (Brescia Mobilità) provides regular bus services between Desenzano del Garda, Salò, Gargnano and Brescia.

===Highways===
The lake is located at the centre of a crucial node between Brescia, Verona and Trento, and is therefore easily reachable via the transversal infrastructures of the Po Valley and those of the Brenner-Rome axis:
===Roads===
Lake Garda is also served by a road network that runs along the entire lake and is made up of the following infrastructures:
* State Highway 11 Padana Superiore, from Desenzano del Garda to Peschiera del Garda
* State Highway 45bis Gardesana Occidentale, from Salò to Riva del Garda
* State Highway 249 Gardesana Orientale, from Peschiera del Garda to Riva del Garda
* State Highway 572 di Salò, from Desenzano del Garda to Salò

<text>Naïve empiricism is a term used in several ways in different fields.

In the philosophy of science, it is used by opponents to describe the position, associated with some logical positivists, that &quot;knowledge can be clearly learnt through evaluation of the natural world and its substances, and, through empirical means, learn truths&quot;.

The term also is used to describe a particular methodology for literary analysis.

<doc id="249204" wikidata="Q5172541" url="?curid=249204" title="Corporation sole">
<text>A corporation sole is a legal entity consisting of a single (&quot;sole&quot;) incorporated office, occupied by a single (&quot;sole&quot;) natural person. This structure allows corporations (often religious corporations or Commonwealth governments) to pass without interruption from one officeholder to the next, giving positions legal continuity with subsequent officeholders having identical powers and possessions to their predecessors. A corporation sole is one of two types of corporation, the other being a &quot;corporation aggregate&quot;.

==Ecclesiastical origins==
Most corporations sole are church-related (for example, the archbishopric of Canterbury), although some political offices of the United Kingdom (e.g., many of the secretaries of state), Canada, and the United States are corporations sole.

The concept of corporation sole originated as a means for orderly transfer of ecclesiastical property, serving to keep the title within the denomination or religious society. In order to keep the religious property from being treated as the estate of the vicar of the church, the property was titled to the office of the corporation sole. In the case of the Catholic Church, ecclesiastical property is usually titled to the diocesan bishop, who serves in the office of the corporation sole.

The Catholic Church continues to use corporations sole in holding titles of property: as recently as 2002, it split a diocese in the US state of California into many smaller corporations sole and with each parish priest becoming his own corporation sole, thus limiting the diocese&#x27;s liability for any sexual abuse or other wrongful activity in which the priest might engage. This is, however, not the case everywhere, and legal application varies. For instance, other U.S. jurisdictions have used corporations at multiple levels. In the jurisdictions of England and Wales, Scotland, Northern Ireland, and the Republic of Ireland, a Catholic bishop is not a corporation sole, and real property is held by way of land trusts, a tradition dating back to the suppression of Catholicism by Henry VIII during the English Reformation and the Penal Laws of Ireland.

The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints uses the corporation sole form for its president, which is legally listed as &quot;The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints&quot;.

Iglesia ni Cristo was registered as corporation sole with the Insular Government of the Philippines in 1914 and with the People&#x27;s Republic of China in 2014.

The corporation sole form can serve the needs of a religious organization by reducing its complexity to that of a single office and its holder, thereby eliminating the need for by-laws and a board of directors.

==The Crown==

Within most constitutional monarchies, notably the Commonwealth realms, the Crown is a nonstatutory corporation sole. Although conceptually speaking, the office and officeholder retain dual capacities in that they may act both in a corporate capacity (as monarch) and in an individual capacity (as a private person), they are inseparably fused in law; there is no legal distinction between the office and the individual person who holds it. The Crown (state) legally acts as a person when it enters into contracts and possesses property. As a person, the monarch (officeholder) may hold properties privately, distinct from property he or she possesses corporately, and may act as monarch separate from their personal acts. For example, Charles III as a natural person holds several separate offices, such as king of the United Kingdom, king of Canada, king of Australia, and the supreme governor of the Church of England, all of which are distinct corporations sole, even as he acts as a natural person in his private capacities separate and apart from his role filling these various offices (corporations). Likewise, the office of prime minister has use of certain properties and privileges, such as an official residence and decision-making powers, that remain with the office once the officeholder leaves, even as the officeholder may own property in a private capacity.

The sovereign&#x27;s status as a corporation sole ensures that all references to the king, the queen, His Majesty, Her Majesty, and the Crown are synonymous, referring to exactly the same legal personality over time. While natural persons who serve as sovereign pass on, the sovereign never legally dies; thus the corporate nature of the office of sovereign ensures that the authority of the state continues uninterrupted. In other words, the sovereign is made a corporation sole to prevent the possibility of disruption or interregnum, thereby preserving the stability of the Crown (state). For this reason, at the moment of the demise of the sovereign, a successor is immediately and automatically in place.

As a corporation sole, the legal person of the sovereign is the personification of the state and consequently acts as a guarantor of the rule of law and the fount of all executive authority behind the state&#x27;s institutions. As Australia and Canada have federal systems of government, the sovereign in these cases also possesses capacities as distinct corporation sole in right of each of the Australian states and Canadian provinces; for example, as His Majesty the King of Australia in Right of Queensland and His Majesty the King of Canada in Right of Alberta.

==Secular application in the United States==
Every state of the United States recognizes corporations sole under common law, and about a third of the states have specific statutes that stipulate the conditions under which that state recognizes the corporations sole that are filed with that state for acquiring, holding, and disposing of title for church and religious society property. Almost any religious society or church can qualify for filing as a corporation sole in these states. There can be no legal limitation to specific denominations, therefore a Buddhist temple or Jewish Community Center would qualify as quickly as a Christian church. Some states also recognize corporations sole for various other non-profit purposes including performing arts groups, scientific research groups, educational institutions, and cemetery societies.

<doc id="249206" wikidata="Q114924" url="?curid=249206" title="T-bone steak">
<text>The T-bone and porterhouse are steaks of beef cut from the short loin (called the sirloin in Commonwealth countries and Ireland). Both steaks include a T-shaped lumbar vertebra with sections of abdominal internal oblique muscle on each side. Porterhouse steaks are cut from the rear end of the short loin and thus include more tenderloin steak, along with (on the other side of the bone) a large strip steak. T-bone steaks are cut closer to the front, and contain a smaller section of tenderloin. The smaller portion of a T-bone, when sold alone, is known as a filet mignon (called fillet steak in Commonwealth countries and Ireland), especially if cut from the small forward end of the tenderloin.

Experts differ about how large the tenderloin must be to differentiate T-bone steak from porterhouse. The United States Department of Agriculture&#x27;s &quot;Institutional Meat Purchase Specifications&quot; state that the tenderloin of a porterhouse must be at least wide at its widest, while that of a T-bone must be at least wide.

Owing to their large size, and as they contain meat from two of the most prized cuts of beef (the short loin and the tenderloin), T-bone steaks are generally considered one of the highest quality steaks, and prices at steakhouses are accordingly high. Porterhouse steaks are even more highly valued owing to their larger tenderloin.

In British usage, followed in the Commonwealth countries, &quot;porterhouse&quot; often means a British sirloin steak (i.e. US strip steak) on the bone, i.e. without the tenderloin on the other side of T-bone. Some British on-line butchers also offer American style porterhouse steaks.

In New Zealand and Australia, a porterhouse is sirloin steak (strip steak in USA) off the bone.

The earliest mention of the term &quot;porterhouse steak&quot; in a newspaper appears to have been in a letter written by Thurlow Weed that appeared in the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot; on August 9, 1843, but the following year (August 24, 1844) it also appeared in a list of food prices in The &quot;New York Herald&quot;, and it appeared regularly in newspapers after that.

==Anatomy of the T-bone==
To cut a T-bone from butchered cattle, a lumbar vertebra is sawn in half through the vertebral column. The downward prong of the &#x27;T&#x27; is a transverse process of the vertebra, and the flesh surrounding it is the spinal muscles. The small semicircle at the top of the &#x27;T&#x27; is half of the vertebral foramen.

==Preparation==

T-bone and porterhouse steaks are suited to fast, dry heat cooking methods, such as grilling or broiling. Since they contain a small amount of collagen relative to other cuts, longer cooking times are not necessary to tenderize the meat. There is some contention as to whether the bone conducts heat within the meat so that it cooks more evenly and prevents meat drying out and shrinking during cooking, or the meat near the bone will cook more slowly than the rest of the steak, and the tenderloin will tend to reach the desired temperature before the strip.

===&quot;Bistecca alla fiorentina&quot;===

&quot;Bistecca alla fiorentina&quot; (), consists of a T-bone traditionally sourced from either the Chianina or Maremmana breeds of cattle. A favorite of Tuscan cuisine, the steak is grilled over a wood or charcoal fire, seasoned with salt, sometimes with black pepper, and olive oil, applied immediately after the meat is retired from the heat. Thickly cut and very large, &quot;Bistecca&quot; are often shared between two or more people, and traditionally served very rare, sometimes garnished with lemon wedges, if not accompanied by red wine, and accompanied by Tuscan beans as a side dish.

===&quot;Cotoletta alla milanese&quot;===

The same cut of meat, but from a calf, is used for &quot;cotoletta alla milanese&quot;, which consists of 1.5 cm-thick cuts which are battered in breadcrumbs and fried in clarified butter with salt.

<doc id="249208" wikidata="Q1343972" url="?curid=249208" title="Divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the primes">
<text>The sum of the reciprocals of all prime numbers diverges; that is:
formula_1

This was proved by Leonhard Euler in 1737, and strengthens Euclid&#x27;s 3rd-century-BC result that there are infinitely many prime numbers and Nicole Oresme&#x27;s 14th-century proof of the divergence of the sum of the reciprocals of the integers (harmonic series).

There are a variety of proofs of Euler&#x27;s result, including a lower bound for the partial sums stating that
formula_2
for all natural numbers . The double natural logarithm () indicates that the divergence might be very slow, which is indeed the case. See Meissel–Mertens constant.

==The harmonic series==
First, we will describe how Euler originally discovered the result. He was considering the harmonic series
formula_3

He had already used the following &quot;product formula&quot; to show the existence of infinitely many primes.

formula_4

Here the product is taken over the set of all primes.

Such infinite products are today called Euler products. The product above is a reflection of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Euler noted that if there were only a finite number of primes, then the product on the right would clearly converge, contradicting the divergence of the harmonic series.

==Proofs==

===Euler&#x27;s proof===

Euler&#x27;s proof works by first taking the natural logarithm of each side, then using the Taylor series expansion for as well as the sum of a converging series:

formula_5

for a fixed constant . Then, by using the following relation:

formula_6

of which, as shown in a later 1748 work, the right hand side can be obtained by setting in the Taylor series expansion

formula_7

Thus,
formula_8

It is almost certain that Euler meant that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes less than is asymptotic to as approaches infinity. It turns out this is indeed the case, and a more precise version of this fact was rigorously proved by Franz Mertens in 1874. Thus Euler obtained a correct result by questionable means.

===Erdős&#x27;s proof by upper and lower estimates===

The following proof by contradiction comes from Paul Erdős.

Let denote the th prime number. Assume that the sum of the reciprocals of the primes converges.

Then there exists a smallest positive integer such that

formula_9

For a positive integer , let denote the set of those in which are not divisible by any prime greater than (or equivalently all which are a product of powers of primes ). We will now derive an upper and a lower estimate for , the number of elements in . For large , these bounds will turn out to be contradictory.

;Upper estimate:
:Every in can be written as with positive integers and , where is square-free. Since only the primes can show up (with exponent 1) in the prime factorization of , there are at most different possibilities for . Furthermore, there are at most possible values for . This gives us the upper estimate formula_10
;Lower estimate:
:The remaining numbers in the set difference are all divisible by a prime greater than . Let denote the set of those in which are divisible by the th prime . Then formula_11
:Since the number of integers in is at most (actually zero for ), we get formula_12
:Using (1), this implies formula_13

This produces a contradiction: when , the estimates (2) and (3) cannot both hold, because .

===Proof that the series exhibits log-log growth===

Here is another proof that actually gives a lower estimate for the partial sums; in particular, it shows that these sums grow at least as fast as . The proof is due to Ivan Niven, adapted from the product expansion idea of Euler. In the following, a sum or product taken over always represents a sum or product taken over a specified set of primes.

The proof rests upon the following four inequalities:

* Every positive integer can be uniquely expressed as the product of a square-free integer and a square as a consequence of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic. Start with formula_14 where the &quot;β&quot;s are 0 (the corresponding power of prime is even) or 1 (the corresponding power of prime is odd). Factor out one copy of all the primes whose β is 1, leaving a product of primes to even powers, itself a square. Relabeling: formula_15 where the first factor, a product of primes to the first power, is square free. Inverting all the s gives the inequality formula_16
To see this, note that formula_17 and formula_18 That is, formula_19 is one of the summands in the expanded product . And since formula_20 is one of the summands of , every summand formula_21 is represented in one of the terms of when multiplied out. The inequality follows.
* The upper estimate for the natural logarithm formula_22

Combining all these inequalities, we see that
formula_23

Dividing through by and taking the natural logarithm of both sides gives
formula_24

as desired. Q.E.D.

Using

formula_25

(see the Basel problem), the above constant can be improved to ; in fact it turns out that
formula_26

where is the Meissel–Mertens constant (somewhat analogous to the much more famous Euler–Mascheroni constant).

===Proof from Dusart&#x27;s inequality===

From Dusart&#x27;s inequality, we get
formula_27

Then
formula_28
by the integral test for convergence. This shows that the series on the left diverges.

===Geometric and harmonic-series proof===
The following proof is modified from James A. Clarkson.

Define the &quot;k&quot;-th tail

formula_29

Then for formula_30, the expansion of formula_31 contains at least one term for each reciprocal of a positive integer with exactly formula_32 prime factors (counting multiplicities) only from the set formula_33. It follows that the geometric series formula_34 contains at least one term for each reciprocal of a positive integer not divisible by any formula_35. But since formula_36 always satisfies this criterion,

formula_37

by the divergence of the harmonic series. This shows that formula_38 for all formula_39, and since the tails of a convergent series must themselves converge to zero, this proves divergence.

==Partial sums==

While the partial sums of the reciprocals of the primes eventually exceed any integer value, they never equal an integer.

One proof is by induction: The first partial sum is , which has the form . If the th partial sum (for ) has the form , then the st sum is

formula_40

as the st prime is odd; since this sum also has an form, this partial sum cannot be an integer (because 2 divides the denominator but not the numerator), and the induction continues.

Another proof rewrites the expression for the sum of the first reciprocals of primes (or indeed the sum of the reciprocals of &quot;any&quot; finite set of primes) in terms of the least common denominator, which is the product of all these primes. Then each of these primes divides all but one of the numerator terms and hence does not divide the numerator itself; but each prime &quot;does&quot; divide the denominator. Thus the expression is irreducible and is non-integer.

<doc id="249234" wikidata="Q2188853" url="?curid=249234" title="Bachelor of Education">
<text>A Bachelor of Education (B.Ed. or BEd) is an undergraduate academic degree which prepares students for work as a teacher in schools. A Bachelor of Education program typically lasts three to four years and combines both coursework and practical experience in educational settings. The curriculum is designed to provide foundational knowledge in pedagogy, educational psychology, teaching methodologies, and subject-specific training. Graduates of this program are equipped with the skills necessary to foster a supportive and effective learning environment for their students.

==Countries where colleges and universities award the degree==

===Argentina===
Since the Educational Reform of 2006, a National Institute for Teacher Education (INFD) was established to develop a standard and coherent teacher training structure throughout the country. According to the Argentine Ministry of Education, the creation of the INFD has helped greatly to reform the previous system establishing a national requirement of a 5-Year National Bachelor of Education to work across the nation at public schools, while there are private universities granting a 4-Year Provincial Bachelor of Education with the regional application.
Other harmonization measures included the standardization of academic qualifications by creating a “National Catalog of Titles and Certifications in Professional Technical Education” and a federal system of degrees and transcripts for most levels of education (excluding university education). The 2005 Vocational and Technical Education Law seeks to systematize training standards and quality assurance mechanisms in vocational education throughout the country. At the secondary level, the government is currently standardizing curricular streams nationwide – a reform that is expected to be completed by the end of 2019. Recent guidelines of Education in Argentina on compulsory education aim to decrease the dropout rates in secondary school and improve promotion and graduation rates throughout Argentina.

===Australia===
In Australia, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. In the majority of Australian universities, there is usually 2 distinct types of the Bachelor of Education: Primary and Secondary. The subjects and degree programs are quite different in both degrees e.g. for a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Primary) the focus of their degree would lie in behaviour, children, basic literacy, how children learn etc. For a student studying the Bachelor of Education (Secondary) they would therefore be teaching roughly 11–18-year-old adolescents and their programs would have less focus on those kinds of areas by the Primary degree. Instead, the degree is based around the student&#x27;s intending teaching subjects; usually 1 or 2. In NSW, these teaching areas provide the major focus for their degrees in their final years. They consist of: English, Mathematics, Science (Biology, Physics &amp; Chemistry), Geography, History, Business Studies, Legal Studies, Economics, Society &amp; Culture and Languages.

The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Most Australian State Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or a bachelor&#x27;s degree in one or two subject areas, with a Graduate Diploma in Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an &#x27;End-On&#x27; course similar but slightly longer than a Graduate Diploma in Education.

A Bachelor of Education (Early Childhood) is given to teachers who focus on ages 5–8 years of age. Though this degree does not stop Early Childhood teachers teaching students who are older in Primary school, this degree is still equivalent to a Bachelor of Education Primary and noted as a &quot;specialty&quot; in Early Childhood. , all teachers (with an exemption to Early Childhood Teachers) must sit the LANTITE exam (Literacy and Numeracy Test for Initial Teachers Exam) to gain their registration and prior to their 16th unit of study undertaking. However, in special circumstances this exam requirement can be waived and the select student given a passing grade. 

Prior to 2016, the Graduate Diploma of Education was no longer accredited, as the label Bachelor of Education is now the complete title. 

, Early Childhood Teachers are required to learn the EYLF (Early Years Learning Framework) a framework that is based on theoretical practice and holistic teaching methods for ages birth to five years old. In Queensland, there is a framework more commonly used called QKLG (Queensland Kindergarten Learning Guide), based on the EYLF and used to teach children ages 3–6.

Note: In Australia, the term Undergraduate Degree is used to describe all degrees undertaken by a first-time university student and usually no pre-requisite tertiary level studies are required, mostly just the completion of Secondary High School. Postgraduate degrees are used to describe the degrees completed with an Undergraduate degree as pre-requisite.

===Bangladesh===
In Bangladesh, Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is an undergraduate professional degree for Hons. (4 years) and Diploma (1/2/3 years) in Education offered by the authorized Teachers Training Institutes or colleges for those aimed their profession as a teacher or as an education and curriculum specialist or as an educationalist in the government and non-governmental educational institutes or any educational organizations such as Save the Children, UNICEF, United Nations Development Programme, BFES, SSUF, ASA etc. B.Ed. degree is mandatory for the teaching profession in both of primary and Secondary school level. Without teaching profession, if anyone wants to go other professions such as education &amp; curriculum specialist, researcher, administrator etc. in any educational or other sectors, he/she must have the minimum qualification of Hons. graduation degree in education (B.Ed. hons. degree). Every year many talent Hons. graduate students from this subject get international scholarship from well known universities of other countries like UK, USA, Japan, Australia, Canada etc. The minimum qualification required for entry into B.Ed. Hons. (4 years) course is passed H.S.C. or equivalent and for entry into Diploma (1/2/3 years) course in education is Bachelor of Arts (B.A) or Bachelor of Science (B.Sc.). The Hons. students of this subject have to read basic educational course contents as their major courses with some minor subject courses. In addition, usually for diploma (1/2/3 years) students from Arts faculty are trained to lecture subjects like history, civics, geography and languages and from Science faculty are trained to follow their lecture on mathematics, physics, chemistry and biology etc. whereas graduates from Commerce faculty trained up to lecture on accounting &amp; finance, economics, management &amp; marketing. After B.Ed. hons., one can continue for Master in Education (M.Ed.), M.Phil, PhD in education in some universities of Bangladesh. National Council for Education and related universities as well as their institutions is the constitutional authority to standardize courses for the educationalist and teachers in Bangladesh.

===Canada and the United States===
In Canada and the United States, this degree is awarded for coursework completed within a programme lasting one to five years, depending on the requirements established by the place where the province or state in which the university is located. In Canada, a B.Ed. degree is required for teaching certification.

A B.Ed. programme may have direct entry from high school; as a combined degree with another bachelor&#x27;s degree (e.g., B.A./B.Ed.); or as an after-degree programme where the candidate has obtained a bachelor&#x27;s degree, usually in the field in which the student wishes to teach. A good rapport or previous experience with young children or teens is also a desired characteristic of applicants.

There are several streams to a Bachelor of Education, each corresponding to the particular level of instruction. In the United States, this includes elementary school education, middle school education, and high school education. Students in the elementary education stream generally study for a Liberal Studies degree. In the high school (secondary education) stream, the student specialises in one to two subject areas. Upon completion of the degree, they will prepare and eventually sit for the state&#x27;s Board of Education certification examination.

A typical B.Ed. program may include coursework in pedagogy, educational psychology, educational policy and leadership, assessment, curriculum development; and lesson planning, social justice, special education, and instructional technology.

===India===
The Bachelor of Teaching (B.T.) degree, once offered in India, underwent a transformation in 2002, giving rise to the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) degree. The eligibility criterion for enrolling in the B.Ed. course was modified in 2019 by the National Council for Teacher Education (NCTE), now requiring a graduation-level qualification (10+2+3).

The duration of the B.Ed. course was also extended from two years to four years, a change implemented in 2019 as well, under the guidance of the NCTE. While the &quot;Right to Free and Compulsory Education for Children&quot; (RTE Act 2009) doesn&#x27;t prescribe specific entry-level percentages for B.Ed., the NCTE mandates a minimum of 50% for General Category candidates and 45% for Scheduled Castes and Scheduled Tribes candidates.

The Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) degree has become a mandatory qualification for teaching at the secondary Level (classes 6 to 10) known as TGT and higher secondary (10+2 or classes 11 and 12) levels known as PGT in India. Irrespective of their undergraduate discipline, students can pursue a B.Ed. course, which is now universally four years long and available across both public and private colleges. The Duration of B.Ed Prog after Graduation is still 2 years until NCTE announce some updates to follow New Education Policy 2019. As per Last meeting with Haryana Government, NCTE has informed that there will be no change of duration till 2030 for 2 years B.Ed Prog. Following the completion of a B.Ed., students can opt for a Master of Education (M.Ed.) program at various Indian universities or teacher-training institutes.

Meanwhile, the Bachelor of Elementary Education (B.El.Ed.) program is a comprehensive Four-year integrated professional degree course, tailored for those looking to teach at the elementary level (classes 1 to 5) after their higher secondary education. B.El.Ed. encompasses pedagogical knowledge, subject expertise, human development understanding, and communication skills, affording graduates versatile career paths.

As of a recent 2023 Supreme Court ruling, it was decreed that B.Ed. graduates are ineligible to teach primary-level students. Regardless, completing either a B.Ed. or B.El.Ed. equips individuals to offer their teaching services not only within the state and country but also internationally, given the substantial demand for qualified educators in India. Graduates of these programs can anticipate promising employment opportunities.

=== Ireland ===
In the Republic of Ireland, a 4-Year Bachelor of Education degree combines practical/pedagogical study with a Major sequence in the academic discipline of Education. Modules in the Irish and English languages are compulsory.

Students study a range of Education-related subjects, including Psychology, Sociology, History, Social Policy, Professional Practice. Students also study subjects from another field or discipline as qualification for an intended teaching area or method.

The degree is available in several specialisations, including Primary, Secondary, Human Movement/Health, Music, or Early Childhood education. The longer duration of the course allows for more practical experiences and greater personal or professional development before teaching service. Teacher-Certification bodies require either a Bachelor of Education, or an Undergraduate/Bachelor&#x27;s Degree in one or two subject areas, with a Diploma of Education as a minimum. A B.Ed. is not to be confused with the lesser degree Bachelor of Teaching, which is usually an &#x27;End-On&#x27; course similar but slightly longer than a Diploma of Education.

===Israel===
In Israel, the Bachelor of Education (B.Ed.) is a course offered, suitable for those interested in developing the field. Developed unique training programs tailored contemporary trends in professional training for teaching. In addition, there are plans Sitting studies of academics and teachers complete undergraduate studies. In Israel there are a number of colleges and universities offering B.Ed. studies as Levinsky College of Education and B.Sc.Ed. at The Technion – Israel Institute of Technology

=== Malaysia and Singapore ===
A Bachelor of Science Education is a degree awarded to students who complete the four to five-year course of study in the field of science (major and minor in biology, chemistry, physics, and math) with major Educational courses. It is the combination of degrees in science and education course (sometimes referred to double degree programs B.Sc + B.Ed. = B.Sc.Ed.). Even though B.Sc and B.Ed. are notionally two degrees, they must be taken together. There are very few universities that offer this course because it requires collaboration between the Faculty/School of Science and that of Education, to ensure that the teacher not only can work in an education institution but also in an industrial area related to science.

In Malaysia, it is one of the most difficult admittance degrees for the students to get into. Students not only need a distinction result but also need to go through a psychology test, rigorous interviews and demos of teaching. Students who already get these courses will be given a full scholarship by the Minister of Education. Upon graduation, the students will get job offers from government and private institutions (mostly to teach for matriculation, foundation or high school students) due to deep understanding of specific science and professional teaching training. Graduates also can work in other science related industries. Bachelor of Science &quot;and&quot; Education is totally different from Bachelor of Science &quot;in&quot; Education.

In Singapore, the National Institute of Education, an autonomous institute of Nanyang Technological University, offers a four-year undergraduate programme, offering B.Sc.(Ed.) or B.A.(Ed.) in its initial teacher training programmes. Students are taught pedagogical theories and principles, alongside their chosen subject majors (and minors).

===New Zealand===
The 3-year Bachelor of Education prepares graduates to teach in early childhood centres, primary, intermediate schools and secondary schools. With the Bachelor of Education one can specialise in Primary, Early Childhood, Physical Education and Huarahi Māori. The qualification is designed to equip students with the skills and knowledge they need to be effective teachers, and to gain provisional registration with the New Zealand Teachers Council. Teaching practicums allow students to gain invaluable experience in diverse education settings as they study. The Bachelor of Education can lead on to further postgraduate study.

=== Nigeria ===
In Nigeria, the Bachelor of Education degree is awarded at universities and colleges of education across the nation as a first degree. There are a few specialised universities of education in the country that exist to train teachers professionally. Some of these specialised universities include Tai Solarin University of Education and Ignatius Ajuru University of Education. The B.Ed. can be done as combined honours with a B.A. or B.Sc. It can also be done as a single honours degree with specialisations in nursery and primary education, curriculum development, educational administration and policy studies, among others. Students usually undergo intensive teaching practices at the 2nd and 3rd years of study. Upon graduation, they are registered by the Teachers Registration Council of Nigeria (TRCN) and can be employed as teachers afterwards. Postgraduate education usually take the form of an M.Ed, PGDE, and GDE.

=== South Africa ===
In South Africa the Bachelor of Education Degree is a four-year degree that allows a person to become a teacher, once they have registered with the South African Council for Educators (SACE). 

===Sri Lanka===
The Bachelor of Education degree was first introduced by the University of Ceylon (Sri Lanka) in 1963. J. E. Jayasuriya, then professor of education at University of Ceylon, introduced the course to meet the growing demand for professional teacher qualifications. Then the practice was to join the teaching profession with a bachelor&#x27;s degree either in arts or sciences, and after four years of teaching in a secondary school teachers get the one-year postgraduate diploma in education.

The University of Ceylon used to take only 50–60 postgraduate diploma candidates at a time in an annual program. The B.Ed. degree was introduced combining the bachelor&#x27;s degree and the postgraduate diploma in education. B.Ed. was introduced as a four-year special degree and in contrast with the 9–10 3-hour papers at the final degree examination, a B.Ed. degree required a candidates to sit for 19–20 papers for the finals. This happened due to combining of the bachelor&#x27;s degree and the postgraduate diploma in education. Only the top-performing students were admitted to B.Ed. degree at University of Ceylon, Peradeniya. The first batch graduated in 1967. Following this Australia introduced the B.Ed. degree. Upali M Sedere was the first first-class holder of the B.Ed. degree from University of Ceylon, Peradeniya in 1969. Subsequently, in 1973, the B.Ed. program at the University of Sri Lanka changed in its scope and character.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, where both the university system and school system are very different, the degree is awarded after a three- or four-year course (the course length depends on the university) which is specifically tailored to either primary education or for a limited range of secondary education subjects. It leads to Qualified Teacher Status (QTS) in England and Wales and is a teaching qualification in Scotland and Northern Ireland.

As a result of the Robbins Report on higher education (1963), the teacher training colleges were reformed as Colleges of Education. Such colleges, as in the case of those in London, became &#x27;constituent colleges&#x27; of the Institute of Education, with their academic award being from the University of London. Students were offered an extra year of study, bringing the course up to four years in length and resulting in the award of the Bachelor of Education degree. The first Bachelors of Education graduated in 1968.

The BEd became more widespread in the early 1980s, when a bachelor&#x27;s degree became a requirement for new teachers in the whole of the United Kingdom, replacing the old Certificate in Education (Cert Ed).

The BEd is not the only way of gaining Qualified Teacher Status or gaining a teaching qualification. Other routes are as follows:

<doc id="249244" wikidata="Q539929" url="?curid=249244" title="Duke of Rutland">
<text>Duke of Rutland is a title in the Peerage of England, named after Rutland, a county in the East Midlands of England. Earldoms named after Rutland have been created three times; the ninth earl of the third creation was made duke in 1703, in whose family&#x27;s line the title continues. The heir apparent to the dukedom has the privilege of using the courtesy title of Marquess of Granby.

==Earldom of Rutland==

===First creation===
The title Earl of Rutland was created on 25 February 1390 for Edward of Norwich (1373–1415), son of Edmund of Langley, 1st Duke of York, and grandson of King Edward III. Upon the Duke&#x27;s death in 1402 Edward became Duke of York. The title became extinct upon Edward of Norwich&#x27;s death at the Battle of Agincourt. 

===Second creation===
The title Earl of Rutland was created for a second time on 29 January 1446 for Edmund (1443–1460), second son of Richard Plantagenet, 3rd Duke of York (and younger brother of the future King Edward IV).

===Third creation===
Thomas Manners (c. 1488–1543), son of the 11th Baron de Ros, was created Earl of Rutland in the Peerage of England in 1525. He was the great-grandson of Richard Plantagenet. The barony of &#x27;de Ros&#x27; (sometimes spelt Ros, Roos or de Roos) was created by Simon de Montfort with a writ of summons to the House of Lords for Robert de Ros (1223–1285) in 1264. The title may pass through the female line when there is no male heir, and accordingly, when the 3rd Earl, Edward Manners (c. 1548–1587), left no sons, the barony of Ros passed to the family of his daughter Elizabeth (died 1591) who became the wife of the 2nd Earl of Exeter. The 3rd Earl was succeeded as the 4th Earl by his brother John (died 1588). The barony of Ros was restored to the Manners family when Francis Manners, the 6th Earl (1578–1632), inherited it in 1618 from his cousin William Cecil (1590–1618). However, Francis died without male issue and the assumption of the courtesy title of Lord Ros for the eldest son of subsequent earls appears to have had no legal basis. On the death of the seventh Earl in 1641 the Earldom passed to his distant cousin John Manners of Haddon Hall, grandson of the second son of the first Earl.

==Dukedom of Rutland==

In 1703, the ninth Earl of Rutland was created Duke of Rutland and Marquess of Granby by Queen Anne.

===Marquess of Granby===
The most notable Marquess of Granby was John Manners (1721–1770), eldest son of the third Duke. He was an accomplished soldier and highly popular figure of his time; in 1745 he became a colonel; his military career flourished during the Seven Years&#x27; War.

At the Battle of Minden (1 August 1759), although his role was small, he commanded the reserve cavalry. In 1760, at the Battle of Warburg, he led a cavalry charge which routed the French, losing his hat and wig in the process. In recognition of this, soldiers of the Blues and Royals (his former regiment) have the unique privilege in the British Army of being permitted to salute while not wearing headgear. Granby&#x27;s losing his helmet and wig in the charge gave rise to the expression &#x27;going bald-headed&#x27; at something.

In 1758, the King made him Colonel of the Royal Horse Guards and in 1766, as Lieutenant-General, he became Commander-in-Chief (a basically political appointment). His title was honoured by being used by a large number of pubs throughout Britain. As Colonel, he provided for his most capable soldiers such that when they could no longer be of service to the Regiment, he would give them financial support to start a pub, the sole condition being that the pub was to be named &quot;The Marquis of Granby&quot; after him. The towns of Granby, Quebec in Canada and Granby, Massachusetts and Granby, Connecticut in the United States as well as Granby Street in Norfolk, Virginia, USA were also named after him. So too were two forts, Fort Granby, in Tobago, and Fort Granby in South Carolina.

He died before his father, and therefore did not become Duke.

===Subsidiary titles===
The subsidiary titles of the dukedom are: Marquess of Granby (created 1703), Earl of Rutland (1525), Baron Manners, of Haddon in the County of Derby (1679), and Baron Roos of Belvoir, of Belvoir in the County of Leicester (1896). The title &quot;Baron Roos of Belvoir&quot; is in the Peerage of the United Kingdom; the remaining titles being in the Peerage of England. The most senior subsidiary title, &quot;Marquess of Granby&quot;, is the courtesy title used by the Duke&#x27;s eldest son and heir.

===Family seat===
The Manners family own medieval Haddon Hall, Derbyshire and Belvoir Castle, Leicestershire that were successively extended and rebuilt until the 19th century. Some rooms in both buildings are open to the public. They are Grade I in architecture, set in listed parks, woodland and gardens and span a central water feature, which acted as models for other landscaped estates.

In 2009, to mark 500 years of the occupancy of Belvoir Castle by the family, two aircraft from RAF Cranwell, Lincolnshire, bore the Duke&#x27;s coat of arms. On 11 June 2009, the Duke visited the station to see the aircraft: a King Air from 45 (Reserve) Sqn and a Dominie from 55 (Reserve) Sdn.

===Burials===
The traditional burial place of the Manners family was St Mary the Virgin&#x27;s Church, Bottesford. Since elevation to the dukedom in 1703 most Dukes have been buried in the grounds of the mausoleum at Belvoir Castle. The mausoleum at Belvoir Castle was built by John Henry Manners, 5th Duke of Rutland, following the death of his wife, Elizabeth Howard (1780–1825), daughter of the 5th Earl of Carlisle. After its construction, most of the 18th-century monuments in Belton Church were moved to the mausoleum which then became the family&#x27;s main place of burial.

===Literature===
Jorge Luis Borges recalls the duke of Rutland in his story &quot;A Survey of the Works of Herbet Quain&quot; in the book &quot;The Garden of Forking Paths&quot;.

==Coat of arms==

The original coat of arms of the Manners family had a chief of plain &quot;gules&quot;. The quartered chief, with the fleurs-de-lis of France and lion passant guardant of England, was granted as an augmentation by King Henry VIII to Thomas Manners at the time of his creation as Earl of Rutland, in recognition of his descent in the maternal line from King Edward III.

<text>In computer science, the clique problem is the computational problem of finding cliques (subsets of vertices, all adjacent to each other, also called complete subgraphs) in a graph. It has several different formulations depending on which cliques, and what information about the cliques, should be found. Common formulations of the clique problem include finding a maximum clique (a clique with the largest possible number of vertices), finding a maximum weight clique in a weighted graph, listing all maximal cliques (cliques that cannot be enlarged), and solving the decision problem of testing whether a graph contains a clique larger than a given size.

The clique problem arises in the following real-world setting. Consider a social network, where the graph&#x27;s vertices represent people, and the graph&#x27;s edges represent mutual acquaintance. Then a clique represents a subset of people who all know each other, and algorithms for finding cliques can be used to discover these groups of mutual friends. Along with its applications in social networks, the clique problem also has many applications in bioinformatics, and computational chemistry.

Most versions of the clique problem are hard. The clique decision problem is NP-complete (one of Karp&#x27;s 21 NP-complete problems). The problem of finding the maximum clique is both fixed-parameter intractable and hard to approximate. And, listing all maximal cliques may require exponential time as there exist graphs with exponentially many maximal cliques. Therefore, much of the theory about the clique problem is devoted to identifying special types of graph that admit more efficient algorithms, or to establishing the computational difficulty of the general problem in various models of computation.

To find a maximum clique, one can systematically inspect all subsets, but this sort of brute-force search is too time-consuming to be practical for networks comprising more than a few dozen vertices.
Although no polynomial time algorithm is known for this problem, more efficient algorithms than the brute-force search are known. For instance, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm can be used to list all maximal cliques in worst-case optimal time, and it is also possible to list them in polynomial time per clique.

==History and applications==
The study of complete subgraphs in mathematics predates the &quot;clique&quot; terminology. For instance, complete subgraphs make an early appearance in the mathematical literature in the graph-theoretic reformulation of Ramsey theory by . But the term &quot;clique&quot; and the problem of algorithmically listing cliques both come from the social sciences, where complete subgraphs are used to model social cliques, groups of people who all know each other. used graphs to model social networks, and adapted the social science terminology to graph theory. They were the first to call complete subgraphs &quot;cliques&quot;. The first algorithm for solving the clique problem is that of , who were motivated by the sociological application. Social science researchers have also defined various other types of cliques and maximal cliques in social network, &quot;cohesive subgroups&quot; of people or actors in the network all of whom share one of several different kinds of connectivity relation. Many of these generalized notions of cliques can also be found by constructing an undirected graph whose edges represent related pairs of actors from the social network, and then applying an algorithm for the clique problem to this graph.

Since the work of Harary and Ross, many others have devised algorithms for various versions of the clique problem. In the 1970s, researchers began studying these algorithms from the point of view of worst-case analysis. See, for instance, , an early work on the worst-case complexity of the maximum clique problem. Also in the 1970s, beginning with the work of and , researchers began using the theory of NP-completeness and related intractability results to provide a mathematical explanation for the perceived difficulty of the clique problem. In the 1990s, a breakthrough series of papers beginning with showed that (assuming P ≠ NP) it is not even possible to approximate the problem accurately and efficiently.

Clique-finding algorithms have been used in chemistry, to find chemicals that match a target structure and to model molecular docking and the binding sites of chemical reactions. They can also be used to find similar structures within different molecules. In these applications, one forms a graph in which each vertex represents a matched pair of atoms, one from each of two molecules. Two vertices are connected by an edge if the matches that they represent are compatible with each other. Being compatible may mean, for instance, that the distances between the atoms within the two molecules are approximately equal, to within some given tolerance. A clique in this graph represents a set of matched pairs of atoms in which all the matches are compatible with each other. A special case of this method is the use of the modular product of graphs to reduce the problem of finding the maximum common induced subgraph of two graphs to the problem of finding a maximum clique in their product.

In automatic test pattern generation, finding cliques can help to bound the size of a test set. In bioinformatics, clique-finding algorithms have been used to infer evolutionary trees, predict protein structures, and find closely interacting clusters of proteins. Listing the cliques in a dependency graph is an important step in the analysis of certain random processes. In mathematics, Keller&#x27;s conjecture on face-to-face tiling of hypercubes was disproved by , who used a clique-finding algorithm on an associated graph to find a counterexample.

==Definitions==
An undirected graph is formed by a finite set of vertices and a set of unordered pairs of vertices, which are called edges. By convention, in algorithm analysis, the number of vertices in the graph is denoted by and the number of edges is denoted by . A clique in a graph is a complete subgraph of . That is, it is a subset of the vertices such that every two vertices in are the two endpoints of an edge in . A maximal clique is a clique to which no more vertices can be added. For each vertex that is not part of a maximal clique, there must be another vertex that is in the clique and non-adjacent to , preventing from being added to the clique. A maximum clique is a clique that includes the largest possible number of vertices. The clique number is the number of vertices in a maximum clique of .

Several closely related clique-finding problems have been studied.
*In the maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a maximum clique in the graph. If there are multiple maximum cliques, one of them may be chosen arbitrarily.
*In the weighted maximum clique problem, the input is an undirected graph with weights on its vertices (or, less frequently, edges) and the output is a clique with maximum total weight. The maximum clique problem is the special case in which all weights are equal. As well as the problem of optimizing the sum of weights, other more complicated bicriterion optimization problems have also been studied.
*In the maximal clique listing problem, the input is an undirected graph, and the output is a list of all its maximal cliques. The maximum clique problem may be solved using as a subroutine an algorithm for the maximal clique listing problem, because the maximum clique must be included among all the maximal cliques.
*In the -clique problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number . The output is a clique with vertices, if one exists, or a special value indicating that there is no -clique otherwise. In some variations of this problem, the output should list all cliques of size .
*In the clique decision problem, the input is an undirected graph and a number , and the output is a Boolean value: true if the graph contains a -clique, and false otherwise.
The first four of these problems are all important in practical applications. The clique decision problem is not of practical importance; it is formulated in this way in order to apply the theory of NP-completeness to clique-finding problems.

The clique problem and the independent set problem are complementary: a clique in is an independent set in the complement graph of and vice versa. Therefore, many computational results may be applied equally well to either problem, and some research papers do not clearly distinguish between the two problems. However, the two problems have different properties when applied to restricted families of graphs. For instance, the clique problem may be solved in polynomial time for planar graphs while the independent set problem remains NP-hard on planar graphs.

==Algorithms==

===Finding a single maximal clique===
A maximal clique, sometimes called inclusion-maximal, is a clique that is not included in a larger clique. Therefore, every clique is contained in a maximal clique. Maximal cliques can be very small. A graph may contain a non-maximal clique with many vertices and a separate clique of size 2 which is maximal. While a maximum (i.e., largest) clique is necessarily maximal, the converse does not hold. There are some types of graphs in which every maximal clique is maximum; these are the complements of the well-covered graphs, in which every maximal independent set is maximum. However, other graphs have maximal cliques that are not maximum.

A single maximal clique can be found by a straightforward greedy algorithm. Starting with an arbitrary clique (for instance, any single vertex or even the empty set), grow the current clique one vertex at a time by looping through the graph&#x27;s remaining vertices. For each vertex that this loop examines, add to the clique if it is adjacent to every vertex that is already in the clique, and discard otherwise. This algorithm runs in linear time. Because of the ease of finding maximal cliques, and their potential small size, more attention has been given to the much harder algorithmic problem of finding a maximum or otherwise large clique. However, some research in parallel algorithms has studied the problem of finding a maximal clique. In particular, the problem of finding the lexicographically first maximal clique (the one found by the algorithm above) has been shown to be complete for the class of polynomial-time functions. This result implies that the problem is unlikely to be solvable within the parallel complexity class NC.

===Cliques of fixed size===
One can test whether a graph contains a -vertex clique, and find any such clique that it contains, using a brute force algorithm. This algorithm examines each subgraph with vertices and checks to see whether it forms a clique. It takes time , as expressed using big O notation.
This is because there are subgraphs to check, each of which has edges whose presence in needs to be checked. Thus, the problem may be solved in polynomial time whenever is a fixed constant. However, when does not have a fixed value, but instead may vary as part of the input to the problem, the time is exponential.

The simplest nontrivial case of the clique-finding problem is finding a triangle in a graph, or equivalently determining whether the graph is triangle-free.
In a graph with edges, there may be at most triangles (using big theta notation to indicate that this bound is tight). The worst case for this formula occurs when is itself a clique. Therefore, algorithms for listing all triangles must take at least time in the worst case (using big omega notation), and algorithms are known that match this time bound. For instance, describe an algorithm that sorts the vertices in order from highest degree to lowest and then iterates through each vertex in the sorted list, looking for triangles that include and do not include any previous vertex in the list. To do so the algorithm marks all neighbors of , searches through all edges incident to a neighbor of outputting a triangle for every edge that has two marked endpoints, and then removes the marks and deletes from the graph. As the authors show, the time for this algorithm is proportional to the arboricity of the graph (denoted ) multiplied by the number of edges, which is . Since the arboricity is at most , this algorithm runs in time . More generally, all -vertex cliques can be listed by a similar algorithm that takes time proportional to the number of edges multiplied by the arboricity to the power . For graphs of constant arboricity, such as planar graphs (or in general graphs from any non-trivial minor-closed graph family), this algorithm takes time, which is optimal since it is linear in the size of the input.

If one desires only a single triangle, or an assurance that the graph is triangle-free, faster algorithms are possible. As observe, the graph contains a triangle if and only if its adjacency matrix and the square of the adjacency matrix contain nonzero entries in the same cell. Therefore, fast matrix multiplication techniques can be applied to find triangles in time . used fast matrix multiplication to improve the algorithm for finding triangles to . These algorithms based on fast matrix multiplication have also been extended to problems of finding -cliques for larger values of .

===Listing all maximal cliques===
By a result of , every -vertex graph has at most maximal cliques. They can be listed by the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, a recursive backtracking procedure of . The main recursive subroutine of this procedure has three arguments: a partially constructed (non-maximal) clique, a set of candidate vertices that could be added to the clique, and another set of vertices that should not be added (because doing so would lead to a clique that has already been found). The algorithm tries adding the candidate vertices one by one to the partial clique, making a recursive call for each one. After trying each of these vertices, it moves it to the set of vertices that should not be added again. Variants of this algorithm can be shown to have worst-case running time , matching the number of cliques that might need to be listed. Therefore, this provides a worst-case-optimal solution to the problem of listing all maximal cliques. Further, the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm has been widely reported as being faster in practice than its alternatives.

However, when the number of cliques is significantly smaller than its worst case, other algorithms might be preferable. As showed, it is also possible to list all maximal cliques in a graph in an amount of time that is polynomial per generated clique. An algorithm such as theirs in which the running time depends on the output size is known as an output-sensitive algorithm. Their algorithm is based on the following two observations, relating the maximal cliques of the given graph to the maximal cliques of a graph formed by removing an arbitrary vertex from :
*For every maximal clique of , either continues to form a maximal clique in , or forms a maximal clique in . Therefore, has at least as many maximal cliques as does.
*Each maximal clique in that does not contain is a maximal clique in , and each maximal clique in that does contain can be formed from a maximal clique in by adding and removing the non-neighbors of from .
Using these observations they can generate all maximal cliques in by a recursive algorithm that chooses a vertex arbitrarily and then, for each maximal clique in , outputs both and the clique formed by adding to and removing the non-neighbors of . However, some cliques of may be generated in this way from more than one parent clique of , so they eliminate duplicates by outputting a clique in only when its parent in is lexicographically maximum among all possible parent cliques. On the basis of this principle, they show that all maximal cliques in may be generated in time per clique, where is the number of edges in and is the number of vertices. improve this to per clique, where is the arboricity of the given graph. provide an alternative output-sensitive algorithm based on fast matrix multiplication. show that it is even possible to list all maximal cliques in lexicographic order with polynomial delay per clique. However, the choice of ordering is important for the efficiency of this algorithm: for the reverse of this order,
there is no polynomial-delay algorithm unless P = NP.

On the basis of this result, it is possible to list all maximal cliques in polynomial time, for families of graphs in which the number of cliques is polynomially bounded. These families include chordal graphs, complete graphs, triangle-free graphs, interval graphs, graphs of bounded boxicity, and planar graphs. In particular, the planar graphs have cliques, of at most constant size, that can be listed in linear time. The same is true for any family of graphs that is both sparse (having a number of edges at most a constant times the number of vertices) and closed under the operation of taking subgraphs.

===Finding maximum cliques in arbitrary graphs===
It is possible to find the maximum clique, or the clique number, of an arbitrary &quot;n&quot;-vertex graph in time by using one of the algorithms described above to list all maximal cliques in the graph and returning the largest one. However, for this variant of the clique problem better worst-case time bounds are possible. The algorithm of solves this problem in time . It is a recursive backtracking scheme similar to that of the Bron–Kerbosch algorithm, but is able to eliminate some recursive calls when it can be shown that the cliques found within the call will be suboptimal. improved the time to , and improved it to time, at the expense of greater space usage. Robson&#x27;s algorithm combines a similar backtracking scheme (with a more complicated case analysis) and a dynamic programming technique in which the optimal solution is precomputed for all small connected subgraphs of the complement graph. These partial solutions are used to shortcut the backtracking recursion. The fastest algorithm known today is a refined version of this method by which runs in time .

There has also been extensive research on heuristic algorithms for solving maximum clique problems without worst-case runtime guarantees, based on methods including branch and bound, local search, greedy algorithms, and constraint programming. Non-standard computing methodologies that have been suggested for finding cliques include DNA computing and adiabatic quantum computation. The maximum clique problem was the subject of an implementation challenge sponsored by DIMACS in 1992–1993, and a collection of graphs used as benchmarks for the challenge, which is publicly available.

===Special classes of graphs===

Planar graphs, and other families of sparse graphs, have been discussed above: they have linearly many maximal cliques, of bounded size, that can be listed in linear time. In particular, for planar graphs, any clique can have at most four vertices, by Kuratowski&#x27;s theorem.

Perfect graphs are defined by the properties that their clique number equals their chromatic number, and that this equality holds also in each of their induced subgraphs. For perfect graphs, it is possible to find a maximum clique in polynomial time, using an algorithm based on semidefinite programming.
However, this method is complex and non-combinatorial, and specialized clique-finding algorithms have been developed for many subclasses of perfect graphs. In the complement graphs of bipartite graphs, Kőnig&#x27;s theorem allows the maximum clique problem to be solved using techniques for matching. In another class of perfect graphs, the permutation graphs, a maximum clique is a longest decreasing subsequence of the permutation defining the graph and can be found using known algorithms for the longest decreasing subsequence problem. Conversely, every instance of the longest decreasing subsequence problem can be described equivalently as a problem of finding a maximum clique in a permutation graph. provide an alternative quadratic-time algorithm for maximum cliques in comparability graphs, a broader class of perfect graphs that includes the permutation graphs as a special case. In chordal graphs, the maximal cliques can be found by listing the vertices in an elimination ordering, and checking the clique neighborhoods of each vertex in this ordering.

In some cases, these algorithms can be extended to other, non-perfect, classes of graphs as well. For instance, in a circle graph, the neighborhood of each vertex is a permutation graph, so a maximum clique in a circle graph can be found by applying the permutation graph algorithm to each neighborhood. Similarly, in a unit disk graph (with a known geometric representation), there is a polynomial time algorithm for maximum cliques based on applying the algorithm for complements of bipartite graphs to shared neighborhoods of pairs of vertices.
The algorithmic problem of finding a maximum clique in a random graph drawn from the Erdős–Rényi model (in which each edge appears with probability , independently from the other edges) was suggested by . Because the maximum clique in a random graph has logarithmic size with high probability, it
can be found by a brute force search in expected time . This is a quasi-polynomial time bound. Although the clique number of such graphs is usually very close to , simple greedy algorithms as well as more sophisticated randomized approximation techniques only find cliques with size , half as big. The number of maximal cliques in such graphs is with high probability exponential in , which prevents methods that list all maximal cliques from running in polynomial time. Because of the difficulty of this problem, several authors have investigated the planted clique problem, the clique problem on random graphs that have been augmented by adding large cliques. While spectral methods and semidefinite programming can detect hidden cliques of size , no polynomial-time algorithms are currently known to detect those of size (expressed using little-o notation).

===Approximation algorithms===
Several authors have considered approximation algorithms that attempt to find a clique or independent set that, although not maximum, has size as close to the maximum as can be found in polynomial time. Although much of this work has focused on independent sets in sparse graphs, a case that does not make sense for the complementary clique problem, there has also been work on approximation algorithms that do not use such sparsity assumptions.

 describes a polynomial time algorithm that finds a clique of size in any graph that has clique number for any constant . By using this algorithm when the clique number of a given input graph is between and , switching to a different algorithm of for graphs with higher clique numbers, and choosing a two-vertex clique if both algorithms fail to find anything, Feige provides an approximation algorithm that finds a clique with a number of vertices within a factor of of the maximum. Although the approximation ratio of this algorithm is weak, it is the best known to date. The results on hardness of approximation described below suggest that there can be no approximation algorithm with an approximation ratio significantly less than linear.

==Lower bounds==

===NP-completeness===

The clique decision problem is NP-complete. It was one of Richard Karp&#x27;s original 21 problems shown NP-complete in his 1972 paper &quot;Reducibility Among Combinatorial Problems&quot;. This problem was also mentioned in Stephen Cook&#x27;s paper introducing the theory of NP-complete problems. Because of the hardness of the decision problem, the problem of finding a maximum clique is also NP-hard. If one could solve it, one could also solve the decision problem, by comparing the size of the maximum clique to the size parameter given as input in the decision problem.

Karp&#x27;s NP-completeness proof is a many-one reduction from the Boolean satisfiability problem. It describes how to translate Boolean formulas in conjunctive normal form (CNF) into equivalent instances of the maximum clique problem. Satisfiability, in turn, was proved NP-complete in the Cook–Levin theorem. From a given CNF formula, Karp forms a graph that has a vertex for every pair , where is a variable or its negation and is a clause in the formula that contains . Two of these vertices are connected by an edge if they represent compatible variable assignments for different clauses. That is, there is an edge from to whenever and and are not each other&#x27;s negations. If denotes the number of clauses in the CNF formula, then the -vertex cliques in this graph represent consistent ways of assigning truth values to some of its variables in order to satisfy the formula. Therefore, the formula is satisfiable if and only if a -vertex clique exists.

Some NP-complete problems (such as the travelling salesman problem in planar graphs) may be solved in time that is exponential in a sublinear function of the input size parameter , significantly faster than a brute-force search. However, it is unlikely that such a subexponential time bound is possible for the clique problem in arbitrary graphs, as it would imply similarly subexponential bounds for many other standard NP-complete problems.

===Circuit complexity===

The computational difficulty of the clique problem has led it to be used to prove several lower bounds in circuit complexity. The existence of a clique of a given size is a monotone graph property, meaning that, if a clique exists in a given graph, it will exist in any supergraph. Because this property is monotone, there must exist a monotone circuit, using only and gates and or gates, to solve the clique decision problem for a given fixed clique size. However, the size of these circuits can be proven to be a super-polynomial function of the number of vertices and the clique size, exponential in the cube root of the number of vertices. Even if a small number of NOT gates are allowed, the complexity remains superpolynomial. Additionally, the depth of a monotone circuit for the clique problem using gates of bounded fan-in must be at least a polynomial in the clique size.

===Decision tree complexity===
The (deterministic) decision tree complexity of determining a graph property is the number of questions of the form &quot;Is there an edge between vertex and vertex ?&quot; that have to be answered in the worst case to determine whether a graph has a particular property. That is, it is the minimum height of a Boolean decision tree for the problem. There are possible questions to be asked. Therefore, any graph property can be determined with at most questions. It is also possible to define random and quantum decision tree complexity of a property, the expected number of questions (for a worst case input) that a randomized or quantum algorithm needs to have answered in order to correctly determine whether the given graph has the property.

Because the property of containing a clique is monotone, it is covered by the Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture, which states that the deterministic decision tree complexity of determining any non-trivial monotone graph property is exactly . For arbitrary monotone graph properties, this conjecture remains unproven. However, for deterministic decision trees, and for any in the range , the property of containing a -clique was shown to have decision tree complexity exactly by . Deterministic decision trees also require exponential size to detect cliques, or large polynomial size to detect cliques of bounded size.

The Aanderaa–Karp–Rosenberg conjecture also states that the randomized decision tree complexity of non-trivial monotone functions is . The conjecture again remains unproven, but has been resolved for the property of containing a clique for . This property is known to have randomized decision tree complexity . For quantum decision trees, the best known lower bound is , but no matching algorithm is known for the case of .

===Fixed-parameter intractability===
Parameterized complexity is the complexity-theoretic study of problems that are naturally equipped with a small integer parameter and for which the problem becomes more difficult as increases, such as finding -cliques in graphs. A problem is said to be fixed-parameter tractable if there is an algorithm for solving it on inputs of size , and a function , such that the algorithm runs in time . That is, it is fixed-parameter tractable if it can be solved in polynomial time for any fixed value of and moreover if the exponent of the polynomial does not depend on .

For finding -vertex cliques, the brute force search algorithm has running time . Because the exponent of depends on , this algorithm is not fixed-parameter tractable.
Although it can be improved by fast matrix multiplication, the running time still has an exponent that is linear in . Thus, although the running time of known algorithms for the clique problem is polynomial for any fixed , these algorithms do not suffice for fixed-parameter tractability. defined a hierarchy of parametrized problems, the W hierarchy, that they conjectured did not have fixed-parameter tractable algorithms. They proved that independent set (or, equivalently, clique) is hard for the first level of this hierarchy, W[1]. Thus, according to their conjecture, clique has no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm. Moreover, this result provides the basis for proofs of W[1]-hardness of many other problems, and thus serves as an analogue of the Cook–Levin theorem for parameterized complexity.

 showed that finding -vertex cliques cannot be done in time unless the exponential time hypothesis fails. Again, this provides evidence that no fixed-parameter tractable algorithm is possible.

Although the problems of listing maximal cliques or finding maximum cliques are unlikely to be fixed-parameter tractable with the parameter , they may be fixed-parameter tractable for other parameters of instance complexity. For instance, both problems are known to be fixed-parameter tractable when parametrized by the degeneracy of the input graph.

===Hardness of approximation===

Weak results hinting that the clique problem might be hard to approximate have been known for a long time. observed that, because the clique number takes on small integer values and is NP-hard to compute, it cannot have a fully polynomial-time approximation scheme, unless P = NP. If too accurate an approximation were available, rounding its value to an integer would give the exact clique number. However, little more was known until the early 1990s, when several authors began to make connections between the approximation of maximum cliques and probabilistically checkable proofs. They used these connections to prove hardness of approximation results for the maximum clique problem.
After many improvements to these results it is now known that, for every real number , there can be no polynomial time algorithm that approximates the maximum clique to within a factor better than , unless P = NP.

The rough idea of these inapproximability results is to form a graph that represents a probabilistically checkable proof system for an NP-complete problem such as the Boolean satisfiability problem. In a probabilistically checkable proof system, a proof is represented as a sequence of bits. An instance of the satisfiability problem should have a valid proof if and only if it is satisfiable. The proof is checked by an algorithm that, after a polynomial-time computation on the input to the satisfiability problem, chooses to examine a small number of randomly chosen positions of the proof string. Depending on what values are found at that sample of bits, the checker will either accept or reject the proof, without looking at the rest of the bits. False negatives are not allowed: a valid proof must always be accepted. However, an invalid proof may sometimes mistakenly be accepted. For every invalid proof, the probability that the checker will accept it must be low.

To transform a probabilistically checkable proof system of this type into a clique problem, one forms a graph with a vertex for each possible accepting run of the proof checker. That is, a vertex is defined by one of the possible random choices of sets of positions to examine, and by bit values for those positions that would cause the checker to accept the proof. It can be represented by a partial word with a 0 or 1 at each examined position and a wildcard character at each remaining position. Two vertices are adjacent, in this graph, if the corresponding two accepting runs see the same bit values at every position they both examine. Each (valid or invalid) proof string corresponds to a clique, the set of accepting runs that see that proof string, and all maximal cliques arise in this way. One of these cliques is large if and only if it corresponds to a proof string that many proof checkers accept. If the original satisfiability instance is satisfiable, it will have a valid proof string, one that is accepted by all runs of the checker, and this string will correspond to a large clique in the graph. However, if the original instance is not satisfiable, then all proof strings are invalid, each proof string has only a small number of checker runs that mistakenly accept it, and all cliques are small. Therefore, if one could distinguish in polynomial time between graphs that have large cliques and graphs in which all cliques are small, or if one could accurately approximate the clique problem, then applying this approximation to the graphs generated from satisfiability instances would allow satisfiable instances to be distinguished from unsatisfiable instances. However, this is not possible unless P = NP.

<text>Waitangi Day (, the national day of New Zealand, marks the anniversary of the initial signing—on 6 February 1840—of the Treaty of Waitangi. The Treaty of Waitangi was an agreement towards British sovereignty by representatives of the Crown and indigenous Māori chiefs, and so is regarded by many as the founding document of the nation.

Waitangi Day was first celebrated in 1934, and it was made a national public holiday in 1974. The anniversary is marked annually on 6 February, and a public holiday is observed on the day, or if the date falls on a Saturday or Sunday then the following Monday is observed.

Ceremonies take place at Waitangi and elsewhere to commemorate the signing of the treaty. A variety of events are held, including parties, Māori hui (social gatherings), reflections on New Zealand history, official awards and citizenship ceremonies. The commemoration has also been the focus of protest by Māori activists, and is occasionally the focus of controversy.

==History==

The Treaty of Waitangi () was first signed on 6 February 1840 on the grounds of James Busby&#x27;s house—now known as Treaty House—at Waitangi, in the Bay of Islands. The treaty was signed by representatives acting on behalf of the British Crown and, initially, by about 45 Māori chiefs. Over the course of the next seven months, copies of the treaty were toured around the New Zealand archipelago by the British, and eventually around 540 Māori chiefs would sign. The signing had the effect of securing British sovereignty over the islands of New Zealand, which was officially proclaimed by the Lieutenant-Governor of New Zealand, William Hobson,
on 21 May 1840.

===Previous celebrations===
Prior to 1934, most celebrations of New Zealand&#x27;s founding as a colony were held on 29 January, the date on which William Hobson arrived in the Bay of Islands to issue the proclamation of his appointment, which had been prepared by colonial office officials in England. Hobson had no draft treaty. From the British perspective the proclamation was the key legal document, &quot;what the treaty said was less important&quot;.

In 1932, Governor-General Lord Bledisloe and his wife purchased and presented to the nation the run-down house of James Busby, where the treaty was initially signed. They subsequently donated to restore the building. The Treaty House and grounds were made a public reserve, which was dedicated on 6 February 1934. This event is considered to be the first Waitangi Day.

In 1940, another event was held at the grounds, commemorating the 100th anniversary of the treaty signing. The event was a success and helped raise the profile of the treaty and its day of observance in the national consciousness.

===Annual commemorations===
Annual commemorations of the treaty signing began in 1947. The 1947 event was a Royal New Zealand Navy ceremony centring on a flagpole which the Navy had paid to erect in the grounds. The ceremony was brief and featured no Māori. The following year, a Māori speaker was added to the line-up, and subsequent additions to the ceremony were made nearly every year. From 1952, the governor-general attended, and from 1958 the prime minister also attended, although not every year. From the mid-1950s, a Māori cultural performance was usually given as part of the ceremony. Many of these early features remain a part of Waitangi Day ceremonies, including a naval salute, the Māori cultural performance (now usually a &quot;pōwhiri&quot;, a ceremonial welcome), and speeches from a range of Māori and Pākehā (non-Māori) dignitaries.

===Proposed as public holiday===
The Labour Party stated in its 1957 election manifesto that it would make Waitangi Day a public holiday. After winning that year&#x27;s election, the party said that the country could not afford another public holiday (see the Black Budget). The Waitangi Day Act of 1960 allowed localities to transfer the holiday from their existing regional public holiday to Waitangi Day.

In 1963, after a change of government, the passing of the Waitangi Day Amendment Act transferred the holiday observed in Northland on Auckland Anniversary Day (the Monday closest to 29 January) to Waitangi Day, 6 February. This made Waitangi Day a holiday in Northland only.

===Transition to public holiday===

Waitangi Day became a nationwide public holiday on its observance in 1974 by first undergoing a name change. In 1971 the Labour shadow minister of Māori Affairs, Matiu Rata, introduced a private member&#x27;s bill to make Waitangi Day a national holiday, to be called New Zealand Day. This was not passed into law.

After the 1972 election of the third Labour government under Prime Minister Norman Kirk, it was announced that from 1974, Waitangi Day would be a national holiday known as New Zealand Day. The New Zealand Day Act legislation was passed in 1973. For Kirk, the change was simply an acceptance that New Zealand was ready to move towards a broader concept of nationhood. Diplomatic posts had for some years marked the day, and it seemed timely in view of the country&#x27;s increasing role on the international stage that the national day be known as New Zealand Day. At the 1974 commemorations, the Flag of New Zealand was flown for the first time at the top of the flagstaff at Waitangi, rather than the Union Jack, and a replica of the flag of the United Tribes of New Zealand was also flown.

The election of the third National government in 1975 led to the day being renamed Waitangi Day because the new prime minister, Robert Muldoon, did not like the name &quot;New Zealand Day&quot; and many Māori felt that it debased the treaty. Another Waitangi Day Act was passed in 1976 to change the name back to Waitangi Day and restore Northland&#x27;s anniversary day holiday to that of Auckland.

Waitangi Day underwent &#x27;Mondayisation&#x27; in legislation enacted in 2013, meaning the public holiday is observed on the following Monday if 6 February falls on a Saturday or Sunday.

==Commemorations==

===At Waitangi===

Commemorations at Waitangi usually commence two or three days before Waitangi Day. At Te Tii Waitangi marae, on the southern side of the Waitangi River, political dignitaries are welcomed onto the marae and hear speeches from the local iwi. These speeches often deal with the issues of the day, and vigorous and robust debate occurs. Politicians are usually granted speaking rights, but on occasion, the privilege has been withdrawn, as with Leader of the Opposition Helen Clark in 1999, Prime Ministers John Key in 2016, and Bill English in 2017. In recent years, the official pōwhiri, or welcome ceremony, for members of parliament has moved from Te Tii Waitangi (sometimes referred to as the &quot;lower marae&quot;) to Te Whare Rūnanga (sometimes referred to as the &quot;upper marae&quot;, even though it is not a true marae) at the treaty grounds, which are north of the Waitangi River. In 2018, Jacinda Ardern was the first Prime Minister to attend the commemorations in three years. According to &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;Under Ardern the celebration has taken on a more conciliatory tone, with the prime minister usually spending several days at the treaty grounds listening to Māori leaders and in 2018 memorably asking those gathered to hold her government to account.&quot;

On Waitangi Day, a public service is held at dawn, organised by the Waitangi National Trust, attended by Māori elders and leaders, religious leaders, politicians, members of the diplomatic corps, and defence force personnel. In 2021, this included hīmene (hymns), religious readings, and prayers in many languages. The Royal New Zealand Navy raised flags on the flagstaff in the treaty grounds. Since 2018, members of the government, including the prime minister and members of parliament and their families have served a barbeque breakfast to members of the public following the dawn service. Throughout the day, cultural displays such as kapa haka (Māori dance and song), (educational discussions), and other entertainment take place on stages throughout the treaty grounds. Several waka and sometimes a navy ship also take part in demonstrations in the harbour. The day closes with the flags being lowered by the Navy in a traditional ceremony.

===Elsewhere in New Zealand===
Some marae use the day as an open day and an educational experience for their local communities, giving them the opportunity to experience Māori culture and protocol, or as an opportunity to explain where they see Māori are and the way forward for Māori in New Zealand. Commemorations are largely muted in comparison to those seen on the national days of most countries. There are no mass parades or firework displays, nor truly widespread commemorations.

City councils, museums, libraries and galleries across New Zealand put on free programmes of public events commemorating Waitangi Day for example in 2023 Waikato Museum had Māori weaving demonstrations with Te Roopu Aroha Ki Te Raranga, live music and a film screening of the movie &quot;Whina&quot;. In Wellington there was a concert at Waitangi Park called &quot;Te Rā o Waitangi,&quot; an outdoor film event, waka salutes at Whairepo Lagoon, and bilingual tours of the exhibition &quot;Te Tohu&quot; at the National Library to see the original 1840 Te Tiriti o Waitangi document.

The governor-general hosts an annual garden party for invited guests at Government House in Wellington. At Government House in Auckland, citizenship ceremonies are usually held. As the day is a public holiday, and coincides with the warmest part of the New Zealand summer, many people take the opportunity to spend the day at the beach—an important part of New Zealand culture.

Since 2014, the New Zealand Society of Authors awards the Waitangi Day Literary Honours on Waitangi Day.

=== In Australia ===
At the Kingston Butter Factory in Kingston, Queensland, the Te Korowai Aroha (Cloak of Love) Association held a multicultural festival to mark Waitangi Day annually from 2002. In Sydney, an estimated 8,000 people attended the 2013 Waitangi Day Festival at Holroyd Gardens. The festival featured displays of artefacts, performance of a haka, and Māori culture (cuisine, tattooing and wood carving). 6 February 2015 saw the inaugural Waitangi Day Commemoration held at Nurragingy Reserve, where the focus is more on the document itself, the treaty process and the significance to Māori and Pākehā today. It was co-hosted by the Blacktown City Council and the New South Wales Māori Wardens.

===In the United Kingdom===
In London, England, which has one of the largest New Zealand expatriate populations, the national day is commemorated by the Waitangi Day Charitable Ball, held by the New Zealand Society. The ball also hosts the annual UK New Zealander of the Year awards, cultural entertainment from London-based Māori group Ngāti Rānana, and fine wine and cuisine from New Zealand. Additionally, a service is held by the society at the church of St Lawrence Jewry.

A tradition, observed for more than 30 years , takes place on the closest Saturday to 6 February: New Zealanders, predominately Pākehā, participate in a pub crawl using the London Underground&#x27;s Circle Line. Controversy arises regularly after some Pākehā New Zealanders perform drunken and semi-incomprehensible imitations of haka, which has been considered to be offensive. This pub crawl has been criticised for degrading the mana (&#x27;honor&#x27;) of the treaty.

=== Elsewhere in the world ===
In many other countries with a New Zealand expatriate population, Waitangi Day is commemorated privately. The day is officially commemorated by all New Zealand embassies and high commissions.

For Waitangi Day 2007, Air New Zealand commissioned a number of New Zealanders living in Los Angeles and Southern California to create a sand sculpture of a silver fern on the Santa Monica Beach, creating a stir in the surrounding area.

==Controversy and protest==

By 1971, Waitangi and Waitangi Day had become a focus of protest concerning treaty injustices, with Ngā Tamatoa leading early protests. After a walkout from the ceremony in 1972, Governor General Arthur Porritt responded saying &quot;I just do not believe that racism or discrimination exists in this country,&quot; demonstrating the gap in mutual understanding. Activists initially called for greater recognition of the treaty, but by the early 1980s, they were also arguing that it was a fraud and the means by which Pākehā had conned Māori out of their land. Attempts were made by groups, including the Waitangi Action Committee, to halt the commemorations. A hīkoi travelled from Tūrangawaewae Marae to the treaty grounds in 1984, in protest of Waitangi Day celebrations. With support from the Waitangi Action Committee, the New Zealand Māori Council, the Māori Women&#x27;s Welfare League and the Kīngitanga, the number of marchers grew to 2000 people. Growing protests led to confrontations between police and protesters, sometimes resulting in dozens of arrests.

When the treaty gained greater official recognition in the mid-1980s, emphasis switched back to calls to honour it, and protesters generally returned to the aim of raising awareness of it and what they saw as its neglect by the state. In 1990, a young Māori woman threw a wet black t-shirt at Queen Elizabeth II during her visit to Waitangi, in an effort to &quot;galvanize the country’s attention toward Maori problems&quot; and &quot;get justice under the Treaty of Waitangi.&quot; In 1995, the threat of protests was so intense that security could not be assured and the ceremony was preempted.

Some New Zealand politicians and commentators, such as Paul Holmes, have felt that Waitangi Day is too controversial to be a national day and have sought to replace it with Anzac Day. Others, for example the United Future Party&#x27;s Peter Dunne, have suggested that the name be changed back to New Zealand Day.

===Recent activism===

Waitangi Day celebrations have long been an opportunity for Māori to highlight issues important to Māori, including breaches of the treaty, persistent inequality, high Māori incarceration rates, and advocating for constitutional change which entrench the Treaty of Waitangi. In the past, attempts to vandalise the flagstaff have been an objective of these protests, carrying on a tradition that dates from the 19th century when Hōne Heke chopped down the British flagstaff in nearby Russell. In 2004, protesters succeeded in flying the national Māori flag (known as the flag, referring to Māori sovereignty) above the other flags on the flagstaff by flying it from the top of a nearby tree.

Because of the level of protest activity that had previously occurred at Waitangi, Prime Minister Helen Clark did not attend in 2000. The official commemorations were shifted from Waitangi to Wellington for 2001. Some Māori felt that this was an insult to them and to the treaty. In 2003 and 2004, the anniversary was again officially commemorated at the treaty grounds at Waitangi. In 2004, Leader of the Opposition Don Brash was hit with mud as he entered Te Tii Waitangi marae as a response to his controversial Orewa Speech that year.

On 5 February 2009, the day before Waitangi Day, as Prime Minister John Key was being escorted onto the marae, he was challenged and jostled by two nephews of Māori Party MP Hone Harawira. Both admitted to assault and were sentenced to 100 hours of community service. In 2011, the pair again heckled Key as he entered the marae. A wet T-shirt thrown at Queen Elizabeth II and other attacks on various prime ministers at Waitangi on 6 February have resulted in a large police presence and a large contingent of the armed forces on some years. In 2016 a nurse protesting against the proposed signing of the TPPA trade agreement threw a rubber dildo at Steven Joyce, the MP representing Prime Minister John Key, who had refused to attend, having been denied normal speaking rights. The woman was arrested but later released.

In 2018, Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern visited Waitangi for five days, the longest any prime minister has stayed. Titewhai Harawira, a Māori activist, greeted Ardern and escorted her onto the treaty grounds holding hands—a significant change from Harawira&#x27;s response to Helen Clark&#x27;s visit in 1998, which brought Clark to tears. Ardern is also the first female prime minister to be given speaking rights on the marae by Ngāpuhi, who also offered to bury her child&#x27;s placenta on the treaty grounds. Ardern was praised for her speech during her visit where she said &quot;one day I want to be able to tell my child that I earned the right to stand here, and only you can tell me when I have done that&quot;.

<text>Li Hongzhang, Marquess Suyi (; also Li Hung-chang; February 15, 1823 – November 7, 1901) was a Chinese statesman, general and diplomat of the late Qing dynasty. He quelled several major rebellions and served in important positions in the Qing imperial court, including the Viceroy of Zhili, Huguang and Liangguang.

Although he was best known in the West for his generally pro-modern stance and importance as a negotiator, Li antagonised the British with his support of Russia as a foil against Japanese expansionism in Manchuria and fell from favour with the Chinese after their defeat in the First Sino-Japanese War. His image in China remains controversial, with criticism on one hand for political and military defeats and praise on the other for his success against the Taiping Rebellion, his diplomatic skills defending Chinese interests in the era of unequal treaties, and his role pioneering China&#x27;s industrial and military modernisation. He was presented the Royal Victorian Order by Queen Victoria. The French newspaper &quot;Le Siècle&quot; described him as &quot;the yellow Bismarck.&quot;

== Names ==
Li Hongzhang was also known by other names. His courtesy names were Zifu () and Jianfu (). His art names were Shaoquan (), Yisou () and Shengxin (). The posthumous name awarded to him by the Qing government was Wenzhong (). He was also referred to as Li Zhongtang () and Li Fuxiang (); &quot;Zhongtang&quot; and &quot;Fuxiang&quot; referred to his honorary appointments as Grand Secretary and Crown Prince&#x27;s Grand Tutor respectively. He also held the noble peerage First Class Count Suyi () and was posthumously honoured as First Class Marquis Suyi ().

==Biography==

===Early life and career===
Li was born in a scholar-gentry family in Qunzhi Village (), Modian Township (), northeast of central Hefei, Anhui Province, China. In 1843, he sat for the entry-level imperial examination in Lu Prefecture and obtained a &quot;yougong&quot; (; or &quot;gongsheng&quot; ) position. His father, who was serving as an official in the imperial capital Beijing, was eager to see his son succeed, so he encouraged his son to come to Shuntian Prefecture to take the district-level examination. Li then travelled to Beijing. Along the way, he wrote ten poems under the collection &quot;Entering the Capital&quot; () to express his feelings.

In 1844, Li obtained a &quot;juren&quot; () position in the district-level examination, but failed to make it in the metropolitan-level examination. He then started taking classes under Zeng Guofan. In 1847, he sat for the metropolitan-level examination again and obtained a &quot;jinshi&quot; () position at the young age of 24, and was admitted to the Hanlin Academy as a shujishi (). At the same time, he also continued taking classes under Zeng Guofan to improve his knowledge. Three years later, he took the &quot;sanguan&quot; () examination in the academy and earned the position of a &quot;bianxiu&quot; (; an editor).

===Suppressing the Taiping Rebellion===
In January 1851, the God Worshipping Society led by Hong Xiuquan started the Taiping Rebellion in Guangxi Province. Within about two years, the rebels had conquered many territories in southern China and established the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom with Nanjing as their capital. In 1853, the rebels, advancing from Wuhan, captured Anqing and killed (), the &quot;xunfu&quot; of Anhui Province. The Xianfeng Emperor commissioned (), the Left Vice Secretary of Works, to travel to Anhui Province and recruit civilians to form militias to counter the rebels. Lü Xianji knew that Li was familiar with the local situation in Anhui Province so he secured permission from the imperial court to bring Li along with him as an adviser and assistant. Li was later ordered to remain in Anhui to oversee the militia. In late 1853, the Taiping rebels defeated imperial forces and captured Shucheng County; Lü Xianji committed suicide. In the following year, Jiang Zhongyuan (), the &quot;xunfu&quot; of Anhui Province, committed suicide after Lu Prefecture fell to the rebels. Li then became a subordinate of (), the new &quot;xunfu&quot;, who ordered him to lead troops to attack the rebels, with Li often leading them in person. Li recaptured two counties and Lu Prefecture from the rebels within the following year. For his achievements, he earned the appointment of a &quot;daotai&quot; (道台; circuit administrator) and the privilege of wearing a single-eyed peacock feather in his hat. Later, he led troops into the Huai River area, but could not get along with his subordinates and was forced to abandon his mission.

In the winter of 1858, Li was reassigned to serve in Zeng Guofan&#x27;s office, where he was in charge of drafting documents. Li led a carefree life, flouted rules and regulations, and often woke up late. Zeng Guofan once chided him, &quot;Shaoquan, now that you&#x27;re working in my office, I only have this piece of advice for you: &#x27;Commitment&#x27; is the only thing that matters to us here.&quot; Li was shocked and he improved his behaviour after that. In the same year, (), the &quot;xunfu&quot; of Anhui, abandoned his post when he came under attack by the Taiping rebels. Zeng Guofan drew from Li&#x27;s draft when he wrote a memorial to the imperial court to accuse Weng Tongshu of failing in his duty. The lines from Li&#x27;s draft that were included in Zeng Guofan&#x27;s actual memorial included: &quot;It is my duty, as Your Majesty&#x27;s subject, [to point out the failures of my colleague.] I do not dare to let this pass just because of Weng Tonghe&#x27;s fame and prestige.&quot; Although Li earned Zeng Guofan&#x27;s praise for drafting the memorial, he also caused Weng Tonghe (Weng Tongshu&#x27;s brother) to bear a grudge against him for what he wrote. While serving under Zeng Guofan, he was put in charge of Yanjianshao Circuit () in Fujian Province but did not take up his appointment and remained with Zeng.

In 1860, Li was put in command of the naval forces in Anhui and Jiangsu provinces to counter the Taiping rebels. After Zeng Guofan&#x27;s Xiang Army recaptured Anqing from the rebels in 1861, Zeng wrote a memorial to the imperial court to praise Li, calling him &quot;a talent with great potential&quot;, and sent Li back to Hefei to form a militia. Li managed to recruit enough men to form five battalions in 1862. Zeng Guofan ordered him to bring his troops along with him to Shanghai. Li and his men sailed past rebel-controlled territory along the Yangtze River in British steamboats – the rebels did not attack because Britain was a neutral party – and arrived in Shanghai, where they were commissioned as the Huai Army. Zeng Guofan recommended Li to serve as the &quot;xunfu&quot; of Jiangsu Province. After gaining ground in Jiangsu, Li focused on enhancing the Huai Army&#x27;s capabilities, including equipping them with Western firearms and artillery. Within two years, the Huai Army&#x27;s strength increased from 6,000 to about 60–70,000 men. Li&#x27;s Huai Army combined forces later with Zeng Guofan&#x27;s Xiang Army and Charles George Gordon&#x27;s Ever Victorious Army and prepared to attack the Taiping rebels.

From 1863 to 1864, Li led the Huai Army to attack and recapture Suzhou, Changzhou and other rebel-controlled territories. For his contributions, Li was awarded the honorary appointment Crown Prince&#x27;s Grand Protector () and an imperial yellow jacket. After retaking Changzhou, and capturing and executing the rebel leader Chen Kunshu, Li received a &quot;jiduwei&quot; peerage in recognition of his achievements. An incident connected with the surrender of Suzhou soured Li&#x27;s relationship with Gordon. According to an earlier arrangement with Gordon, the rebel leaders agreed to yield Nanjing to imperial forces on the condition that their lives would be spared. However, after the capture of Nanjing, Li ordered the rebel leaders to be executed. This breach of faith infuriated Gordon so much that he grabbed a rifle and wanted to shoot Li, but Li fled. By the end of 1864, the Taiping Rebellion had basically been suppressed by imperial forces. Li was awarded a noble peerage as &quot;First Class Count Suyi&quot; () and the privilege of wearing a double-eyed peacock feather in his hat.

===As Viceroy of Zhili===
After the suppression of the Taiping Rebellion in 1864, Li assumed a civil office as the &quot;xunfu&quot; of Jiangsu Province for about two years. However, on the outbreak of the Nian Rebellion in Henan and Shandong provinces in 1866, he was ordered to lead troops into battle again. After some misadventures, Li managed to suppress the movement. In recognition of his contributions, he was appointed as Assistant Grand Secretary ().

In 1867, Li was appointed as the Viceroy of Huguang, where he remained until 1870, when the Tianjin Massacre necessitated his transfer to Tianjin to handle the diplomatic crisis with the French. He was given the concurrent appointments as Viceroy of Zhili Province and Beiyang Trade Minister () to oversee various issues in Zhili, Shandong and Fengtian provinces, including trade, tariffs, diplomacy, coastal defence, and modernisation. He was also conferred the honorary position of &quot;Grand Secretary of Wenhua Hall&quot; ().

From the time he became Viceroy of Zhili and Beiyang Trade Minister until his death, with a few intervals of retirement, he shaped the Qing Empire&#x27;s foreign policy to a large extent. In 1876, he signed the Yantai Treaty with Sir Thomas Wade to end a diplomatic crisis with Britain caused by the murder of Augustus Raymond Margary in Yunnan Province. He also arranged treaties with Peru and the Tianjin Convention with Japan, and directed Chinese foreign policy in Korea. Among Li&#x27;s projects to open China to the world on Chinese terms was support for the Chinese Educational Mission, which sent Chinese boys to the United States for education, starting in 1872. The mission was aborted in 1881.

On the death of the Tongzhi Emperor in 1875, Li introduced a large army into the capital and effected a coup which placed the Guangxu Emperor on the throne under the regency of the Empress Dowagers Ci&#x27;an and Cixi. In 1879, Li was awarded the honorary appointment Crown Prince&#x27;s Grand Tutor ().

In 1886, on the conclusion of the Sino-French War, Li arranged a treaty with the French. Li was impressed with the necessity of strengthening the Qing Empire, and while he was Viceroy of Zhili, he raised a large well-drilled and well-armed force, and spent vast sums both in fortifying Port Arthur and the Dagu forts and in strengthening the navy. For years, he had watched the successful reforms effected in Japan and had a well-founded dread of coming into conflict with the Japanese.

===Establishing military academies===

In 1885, Li founded the Tianjin Military Academy () to train Chinese military officers as part of his military reforms. The move was supported by Huai Army commander . The academy was to serve Huai Army and Green Standard Army officers. Various practical military, mathematics and science subjects were taught at the academy. The instructors were German military officers. Another programme was started at the academy for five years in 1887 to train teenagers as new military officers. Mathematics, practical and technical subjects, sciences, foreign languages, Chinese classics and history were taught at the school. Students also took exams. The Weihaiwei and Shanhaiguan military schools copied the Tianjin Military Academy&#x27;s curriculum. The maritime defence fund supplied the budget for the Tianjin Military Academy, which was shared with the Tianjin Naval Academy.

===First Sino-Japanese War===

Because of his prominent role in Chinese diplomacy in Korea and strong political connections in Manchuria, Li found himself directing Chinese forces during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–1895. In fact, it was mostly the armies that he established and controlled that did the fighting, whereas other Chinese troops led by his political rivals did not come to their aid. Rampant corruption further weakened the Chinese military. For instance, one official misappropriated ammunition funds for personal use. As a result, shells ran out during battle, forcing one navy captain, Deng Shichang, to resort to ordering his ship to ram an enemy ship. The defeat of Li&#x27;s modernised armed forces by the Japanese undermined his political standing, as well as the wider cause of the Self-Strengthening Movement.

Li had received the privilege of wearing a three-eyed peacock feather in his hat – a rare exception because three-eyed peacock feathers had previously been restricted to only members of the imperial clan – during Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s 60th birthday celebrations in 1894. However, after the Chinese defeat in the war, Li was disgraced and stripped of his peacock feather. The Qing imperial court initially wanted to send Zhang Yinhuan () and () as their representatives to negotiate with the Japanese, but the Japanese rejected them. Li was selected to take on this mission and was given back his peacock feather.

On March 24, 1895, while negotiating with Japan&#x27;s Prime Minister Itō Hirobumi and Foreign Affairs Minister Mutsu Munemitsu in Shimonoseki, Li was attacked by an assassin, (), who shot him in the left cheek. Koyama was arrested by Japanese police later and he claimed that he desired for the war to continue.

Due to the public embarrassment caused by the attack, the Japanese agreed to the immediate ceasefire Li had urged in the days before, though fighting would continue on Taiwan and in the Penghu Islands. On April 17, 1895, Li signed the Treaty of Shimonoseki with the Japanese, thus ending the First Sino-Japanese War.

===Tour of Russia, Europe and North America===

In 1896, Li attended the coronation of Nicholas II of the Russian Empire on behalf of the Qing Empire and toured Europe, Canada and the United States, where he advocated reform of the American immigration policies that had greatly restricted Chinese immigration after the Chinese Exclusion Act of 1882 (renewed in 1892).

In a famous interview published by The New York Times on September 3, 1896, Li was asked whether he favored the introduction of the newspaper into China as developed in the U.S. or in Europe. Li&#x27;s answer was stunningly honest: &quot;There are newspapers in China, but the Chinese editors, unfortunately, do not tell the truth. They do not, as your papers, tell &#x27;the truth, whole truth, and nothing but the truth.&#x27; The editors in China are great economizers of the truth; they tell only a part of it. They do not have, therefore, the great circulations that your papers have. Because this economy of the truth, our papers fail in the mission of a great press, to be one of the means of civilization.&quot;

While in Britain, he toured parts of the country by train, keeping with his desire to inspire railway development in his own country while constantly fighting against the prejudices of conservative leaders. He visited the industrial area in Barrow, North West England, and toured Lake Windermere on the steamer &quot;Tern&quot; operated by the Furness Railway Company. He also witnessed the 1896 Royal Naval Fleet Review at Spithead. It was during his visit to Britain in 1896 that Queen Victoria made him a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order.

===Boxer Rebellion and death===
In 1900, Li once more played a major diplomatic role in negotiating a settlement with the Eight-Nation Alliance forces which had invaded Beijing to put down the Boxer Rebellion. His early position was that the Qing Empire was making a mistake by supporting the Boxers against the foreign powers. During the Siege of the International Legations, Sheng Xuanhuai and other provincial officials suggested that the Qing imperial court give Li full diplomatic power to negotiate with foreign powers. Li telegraphed back to Sheng Xuanhuai on June 25, describing the declaration of war a &quot;false edict&quot;. This tactic gave the &quot;Southeast Mutual Protection&quot; provincial officials a justification not to follow Empress Dowager Cixi&#x27;s declaration of war. Li refused to accept orders from the government for more troops when they were needed to fight against the foreigners, which he had available. Li controlled the Chinese telegraph service, whose despatches asserted falsely that Chinese forces had exterminated all foreigners in the siege and convinced many foreign readers.

In 1901, Li was the principal Chinese negotiator with the foreign powers which captured Beijing. On September 7, 1901, he signed the Boxer Protocol ending the Boxer Rebellion, and obtained the departure of the Eight-Nation Alliance at the price of huge indemnities for the Chinese. Exhausted from the negotiations, he died from liver inflammation two months later at Xianliang Temple in Beijing. The Guangxu Emperor posthumously honoured Li as Marquis Suyi of the First Class (). This peerage was inherited by Li Guojie, who was assassinated in Shanghai on February 21, 1939, allegedly as a result of his support for the Nanking Reformed Government.

==Family==
Li&#x27;s ancestral family name was actually Xǔ (). His ancestors had migrated from Hukou, Jiangxi Province to Hefei, Anhui Province. Li&#x27;s eighth-great-grandfather, Xu Yingxi (), had given up his second son, Xu Shen (), for adoption by a relative, Li Xinzhuang (). Xu Shen and his descendants had taken Li () to be their family name since then. Li&#x27;s father, Li Wen&#x27;an (李文安; 1801–1855), obtained a &quot;jinshi&quot; degree in the imperial examination in 1838 – the same year as Zeng Guofan. Li Wen&#x27;an also served as a &quot;langzhong&quot; () in the Ministry of Justice.

Li had one elder brother and four younger brothers; he was the second son in his family. His elder brother, (; 1821–1899), served as a &quot;xunfu&quot; and &quot;zongdu&quot; in a number of provinces. His third brother, Li Hezhang (; 1825–1880), served as a military officer. His fourth brother was Li Yunzhang (), his fifth brother was Li Fengzhang (), and his sixth brother was Li Zhaoqing (; 1835–1873).

Li&#x27;s first primary spouse, Lady Zhou (), bore him a son, Li Jingyu (), who died prematurely. Lady Zhou died of illness in 1861.

Li&#x27;s second primary spouse, Zhao Xiaolian (), bore him another son, Li Jingshu (). Li Jingshu inherited his father&#x27;s peerage as Marquis Suyi (), but died early. Li Jingshu&#x27;s son, Li Guojie (; 1881–1939), inherited the Marquis Suyi peerage and served in a number of official positions in the final years of the Qing dynasty. He became an official and industrialist in the Republic of China later. Li Guojie also married the daughter of Natong (; 1857–1925), who served in the Grand Secretariat and Grand Council.

Li&#x27;s secondary spouse, Lady Mo (), bore him three sons: Li Jingyuan (), Li Jingmai (; 1876–1938) and Li Jingjin (). Among the three, only Li Jingmai survived into adulthood. He served as the Qing Empire&#x27;s Ambassador to Austria-Hungary and a Right Vice Secretary () in the Ministry of Civil Affairs ().

Li had three daughters. One of them, Li Ju&#x27;ou (), married Zhang Peilun (1848–1903) and bore the father of the writer Eileen Chang (1920–1995). The other two daughters married Guo Enhou (), the magistrate of Weifang County, and Ren Dehe (), the &quot;zhushi&quot; () of Yixing County.

Li also adopted Li Jingfang (1855–1934), a son of his sixth brother Li Zhaoqing. Li Jingfang served as the Qing Empire&#x27;s Ambassador to Japan and a Left Vice Secretary () in the Ministry of Post and Telecommunications ().

Li&#x27;s brother Li Hanzhang () had a daughter named Li Peisheng ().

His grandson, Li Shiu Tong, would become a sexologist known for his work and relationship with his mentor and romantic partner Magnus Hirschfeld, and would posthumously be recognized as a researcher in his own right following the rediscovery of his manuscripts.

* Honorary Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (United Kingdom).
* Grand Cross of the Order of the Red Eagle, in Diamonds (Germany), &quot;14 June 1896&quot;

==Legacy and assessment==
Li left a word as his self-evaluation: &quot;To know me and judge me is a task for the next millennium&quot; ().

Li was regarded favourably in the United States, owing to his reputation for welcoming foreign influence and his 1896 visit to the country. He was wrongly credited with inventing the American Chinese dish chop suey during the visit. In 1913, William Francis Mannix wrote and published a fabricated &quot;Memoirs of Li Hung Chang&quot; which received widespread praise before being exposed as a forgery in 1923.

His biographer William J. Hail argued that Li &quot;did perhaps all he could for a land where the conservatism of the people, a reactionary officialdom, and unrestrained international rivalry made each step forward a matter of great difficulty,&quot; and praised him as &quot;always progressive, yet patient and conciliatory, it was his fate to bear blame for failures which might have been avoided if he had had his way.&quot; The leader of China&#x27;s New Culture Movement, Hu Shih, was also sympathetic, remarking that if Li had been allowed the opportunity, his achievements for China might have equalled the achievements of his Japanese counterpart, Itō Hirobumi, at the 1895 Treaty of Shimonoseki.

Chinese nationalists criticised Li&#x27;s relations with the Western powers and Japan. Liang Qichao&#x27;s 1902 biography of Li blamed him for China&#x27;s woes and set the tone for further castigation. In Liang&#x27;s view, Li was the chief culprit for the Self-Strengthening Movement, which these nationalists condemned for collaborating with the European imperialists and suppressing the masses. Liang Qichao&#x27;s son, Liang Sicheng, denounced Li in 1951 for &quot;selling out&quot; the country. History textbooks in the People&#x27;s Republic of China labelled Li as a &quot;feudalist&quot; and a traitor to the Chinese people. It was not until the 1980s that mainland historians began a serious debate of the sort which had been taking place in Taiwan.

===Bribery controversy===
Sergei Witte dismissed some rumours during Li&#x27;s visit to Europe that Li was bribed. However, according to the Russian account, Li had urged the Russian government to build a three-million rubles &quot;Li Hongzhang Foundation&quot; to make Li and Zhang Yinheng to support the Sino-Russia railway treaty and Lushun-Dalian Rent Treaty, and a payment of 0.5 million rubles was confirmed. Ma Wenzhong questioned whether the Russian account was reliable.

<text>A group is a set together with an associative operation that admits an identity element and such that there exists an inverse for every element.

Throughout this glossary, we use to denote the identity element of a group.

== Basic definitions ==
Both subgroups and normal subgroups of a given group form a complete lattice under inclusion of subsets; this property and some related results are described by the lattice theorem.

Kernel of a group homomorphism. It is the preimage of the identity in the codomain of a group homomorphism. Every normal subgroup is the kernel of a group homomorphism and vice versa.

Direct product, direct sum, and semidirect product of groups. These are ways of combining groups to construct new groups; please refer to the corresponding links for explanation.

== Types of groups ==
Finitely generated group. If there exists a finite set such that , then is said to be finitely generated. If can be taken to have just one element, is a cyclic group of finite order, an infinite cyclic group, or possibly a group with just one element.

Simple group. Simple groups are those groups having only and themselves as normal subgroups. The name is misleading because a simple group can in fact be very complex. An example is the monster group, whose order is about 1054. Every finite group is built up from simple groups via group extensions, so the study of finite simple groups is central to the study of all finite groups. The finite simple groups are known and classified.

The structure of any finite abelian group is relatively simple; every finite abelian group is the direct sum of cyclic p-groups.
This can be extended to a complete classification of all finitely generated abelian groups, that is all abelian groups that are generated by a finite set.

The situation is much more complicated for the non-abelian groups.

Free group. Given any set , one can define a group as the smallest group containing the free semigroup of . The group consists of the finite strings (words) that can be composed by elements from , together with other elements that are necessary to form a group. Multiplication of strings is defined by concatenation, for instance .

Every group is basically a factor group of a free group generated by . Refer to &quot;Presentation of a group&quot; for more explanation.
One can then ask algorithmic questions about these presentations, such as:
* Do these two presentations specify isomorphic groups?; or
* Does this presentation specify the trivial group?
The general case of this is the word problem, and several of these questions are in fact unsolvable by any general algorithm.

General linear group, denoted by , is the group of -by- invertible matrices, where the elements of the matrices are taken from a field such as the real numbers or the complex numbers.

Group representation (not to be confused with the &quot;presentation&quot; of a group). A &quot;group representation&quot; is a homomorphism from a group to a general linear group. One basically tries to &quot;represent&quot; a given abstract group as a concrete group of invertible matrices, which is much easier to study.

<doc id="249270" wikidata="Q415336" url="?curid=249270" title="Minocycline">
<text>Minocycline, sold under the brand name Minocin among others, is a tetracycline antibiotic medication used to treat a number of bacterial infections such as some occurring in certain forms of pneumonia. It is generally (but not always) less preferred than the tetracycline doxycycline. Minocycline is also used for the treatment of acne and rheumatoid arthritis. It is taken by mouth or applied to the skin.
Common side effects include nausea, diarrhea, dizziness, allergic reactions, and kidney problems. Serious side effects may include anaphylaxis, a lupus-like syndrome, and easy sunburning. Use in the later part of pregnancy may harm the baby and safety during breastfeeding is unclear. It works by decreasing a bacterium&#x27;s ability to make protein thus stopping its growth.
Minocycline was patented in 1961 and came into commercial use in 1971. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 269th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 900,000 prescriptions.

==Medical uses==
===Acne===
Minocycline and doxycycline are frequently used for the treatment of acne vulgaris. Minocycline is specifically indicated to treat inflammatory lesions of non-nodular moderate to severe acne vulgaris in people nine years of age and older. Both minocycline and doxycycline have similar levels of effectiveness and common adverse effects for acne, although doxycycline may have a slightly lower risk of adverse side effects. Both oral/systemic and more recently topical formulations of minocycline are available to treat acne.

Historically, oral minocycline has been an effective treatment for acne vulgaris. However, acne that is caused by antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a growing problem in many countries. In Europe and North America, a number of people with acne no longer respond well to treatment with tetracycline family antibiotics because their acne symptoms are caused by bacteria (primarily &quot;Cutibacterium acnes&quot;) that are resistant to these antibiotics. In order to reduce resistance rates as well as increase the effectiveness of treatment, oral antibiotics should be generally combined with topical acne creams such as benzoyl peroxide or a retinoid (tretinoin, adapalene, etc.). There have also been concerns about systemic minocycline having a variety of rare adverse effects in terms of its use to treat acne.

Oral minocycline is used to treat acne for up to 3 to 4months. Data beyond 3 to 4months are limited.

===Other infections===
Minocycline is also used for other skin infections such as methicillin-resistant &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;.

Although minocycline&#x27;s broader spectrum of activity, compared with other members of the group, includes activity against &quot;Neisseria meningitidis&quot;, its use for prophylaxis is no longer recommended because of side effects (dizziness and vertigo).

It may be used to treat certain strains of methicillin-resistant &quot;S. aureus&quot; infection and a disease caused by drug-resistant &quot;Acinetobacter&quot; spp.

A list of uses includes:
* Amoebic dysentery
* Anthrax
* Bubonic plague
* Cholera
* Ehrlichiosis
* Gonorrhea (when penicillin cannot be given)
* Gougerot-Carteaud syndrome (confluent and reticulated papillomatosis)
* Hidradenitis suppurativa
* For use as an adjuvant to HAART
* Leprosy
* Periodontal disease
* Perioral dermatitis
* Respiratory infections such as pneumonia
* Rocky Mountain spotted fever
* Rosacea
* Syphilis (when penicillin cannot be given)
* Urinary tract infections (UTIs), rectal infections, and infections of the cervix caused by certain microbes

Minocycline has been reported to be effective in the eradication of UTIs and prostatitis.

===Other uses===
Both minocycline and doxycycline have shown effectiveness in asthma due to immune-suppressing effects. Minocycline and doxycycline have modest effectiveness in treating rheumatoid arthritis. However, the 2015 American College of Rheumatology guideline for the treatment of rheumatoid arthritis does not include minocycline.

Recent research indicate that centrally infused minocycline attenuates brain microglial activation, neuroinflammation, and sympathetic activation during pulmonary hypertension.

===Available forms===
Minocycline is available in the form of 50 and 100mg oral capsules, among a variety of other formulations. The oral form of minocycline is usually taken twice daily, once every 12hours, although divided doses four times daily can also be employed. Extended-release oral forms are also available. A topical formulation is available as well.

==Contraindications==
The drug is contraindicated in people with known hypersensitivity to tetracycline antibiotics, as there is complete cross sensitivity in this group. It is also contraindicated in people with severe liver impairment and after the 16th week of pregnancy.

==Side effects==
Minocycline may cause upset stomach, diarrhea, dizziness, unsteadiness, drowsiness, mouth sores, migraines, and vomiting. It increases sensitivity to sunlight, and may affect the quality of sleep and rarely causes sleep disorders. It has also been linked to cases of lupus. Prolonged use of minocycline can lead to blue-gray staining of skin, fingernails, and scar tissue. This staining is not permanent, but can take a very long time for the skin color to return to normal; however, a muddy brown skin color in sun-exposed areas is usually permanent. Permanent blue discoloration of gums or teeth discoloration may also occur. Rare but serious side effects include fever, yellowing of the eyes or skin, stomach pain, sore throat, vision changes, and mental changes, including depersonalization.

Occasionally, minocycline therapy may result in autoimmune disorders such as drug-related lupus and autoimmune hepatitis, which usually occurs in men who also developed minocycline-induced lupus; however, women are more likely to develop minocycline-induced lupus. Significant or complete recovery occurs in most people who develop minocycline-induced autoimmune problems within a period of a few weeks to a year of cessation of minocycline therapy. Autoimmune problems emerge during chronic therapy, but can sometimes occur after only short courses of a couple of weeks of therapy. Drug reaction with eosinophilia and systemic symptoms syndrome can occur during the first few weeks of therapy with minocycline.

Minocycline, but not other tetracyclines, can cause vestibular disturbances with dizziness, ataxia, vertigo, and tinnitus. These effects are thought to be related to minocycline&#x27;s greater penetration into the central nervous system. Vestibular side effects are much more common in women than in men, occurring in 50 to 70% of women receiving minocycline. As a result of the frequency of this bothersome side effect, minocycline is rarely used in female patients. Minocycline&#x27;s vestibular side effects typically resolve after discontinuation of the drug.

Symptoms of an allergic reaction include rash, itching, swelling, severe dizziness, and trouble breathing. Minocycline has also been reported to very rarely cause idiopathic intracranial hypertension (pseudotumor cerebri), a side effect also more common in female patients, potentially leading to permanent vision damage if not recognized early and treated.

Contrary to most other tetracycline antibiotics (doxycycline excluded), minocycline may be used in those with kidney disease, but may aggravate systemic lupus erythematosus. It may also trigger or unmask autoimmune hepatitis.

Minocycline can cause the rare condition of secondary intracranial hypertension, which has initial symptoms of headache, visual disturbances, dizziness, vomiting, and confusion. Brain swelling and rheumatoid arthritis are rare side effects of minocycline in some people.

Minocycline, like most tetracyclines, becomes dangerous past its expiration date. While most prescription drugs lose potency after their expiration dates, tetracyclines are known to become toxic over time. Expired tetracyclines can cause serious damage to the kidney due to the formation of a degradation product, anhydro-4-epitetracycline. Minocycline&#x27;s absorption is impaired if taken at the same time of day as calcium or iron supplements. Unlike some of the other tetracycline group antibiotics, it can be taken with calcium-rich foods such as milk, although this does reduce the absorption slightly.

Minocycline, like other tetracyclines, is associated with esophageal irritation and ulceration if insufficient fluids are taken with the drug before sleep.

A 2007 study suggested that minocycline harms amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) patients. Patients on minocycline declined more rapidly than those on placebo. The mechanism of this side effect is unknown, although a hypothesis is that the drug exacerbated an autoimmune component of the primary disease. The effect does not seem to be dose-dependent because the patients on high doses did not do worse than those on the low doses.

Other possible rare side effects of minocycline include hyperpigmentation and hypersensitivity reactions, among others. It has been associated with more rare and serious adverse effects than other tetracyclines. Some of the rare adverse effects of minocycline may result in death. This has spurred interest in topical instead of systemic minocycline for treatment of acne.

Minocycine has shown thyroid toxicity in animals, including in rodents, mini pigs, dogs, and monkeys.

The use of minocycline to treat acne has been associated with skin and gut dysbiosis (see antibiotic misuse).

==Overdose==
Symptoms of minocycline overdose may include dizziness, nausea, and vomiting. There is no specific antidote for overdose of minocycline and treatment should be symptom-based and supportive. The drug is not removed by hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis.

==Interactions==
The combination of minocycline with dairy, antacids, calcium and magnesium supplements, iron products, laxatives containing magnesium, or bile acid sequestrants may decrease minocycline&#x27;s effectiveness by forming chelates. Combining it with isotretinoin, acitretin or other retinoids can increase the risk for intracranial hypertension. Minocycline significantly reduces concentrations of the anti-HIV drug atazanavir in the body.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===

====Antibiotic activity====
Minocycline mediates its antibiotic activity by binding to the 30S ribosomal subunit of bacteria and thereby inhibiting protein synthesis. It is primarily bacteriostatic. The drug is a broad-spectrum antibiotic and shows activity against a wide range of both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria.

====Other activities====
Minocycline shows a number of off-target activities in addition to its antibiotic activity. These include inhibition of matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs), anti-inflammatory effects, antiapoptotic effects, antioxidant effects, and neuroprotective effects.

Some other reported activities of minocycline include:
* PARP1 inhibition &quot;K&quot;i = 13.8nM
* Neuroprotection IC50 = 10nM
* Microglia full inhibition = 20nM
* Suppression of the mouse&#x27;s locomotor activity = 0.5mg/kg
* Indirect inhibition of inducible nitric oxide synthase

===Pharmacokinetics===
====Absorption====
Minocycline is quickly and nearly completely absorbed from the upper part of the small intestine. Taking it together with food, including milk, has no relevant influence on resorption. It reaches highest blood plasma concentrations after 1 to 2hours.

====Distribution====
The drug has a plasma protein binding of 70 to 75%. It penetrates into almost all tissues; very high concentrations are found in the gallbladder and liver. It crosses the blood–brain barrier better than doxycycline and other tetracyclines, reaching therapeutically relevant concentrations in the cerebrospinal fluid and also in inflamed meninges. Minocycline achieves good concentrations in the urinary bladder, and many other tissues. It shows excellent penetration into the prostate gland. However, while permeation of prostate tissue and semen is good, levels are lower in prosatic fluid.

====Metabolism====
Minocycline is inactivated by metabolism in the liver to about 50%. It is primarily metabolized into 9-hydroxyminocycline. Two &quot;N&quot;-demethylated metabolites are also formed.

====Elimination====
The rest is predominantly excreted into the gut (in part via the gallbladder, in part directly from blood vessels) and eliminated via the feces. About 10–15% are eliminated via the kidneys. It is excreted about 5 to 10% unchanged in urine. For comparison, other tetracyclines, like doxycycline and tetracycline, are excreted 30 to 70% unchanged in urine. The biological half-life of minocycline is 11 to 26hours in healthy people, up to 30hours in those with kidney failure, and significantly longer in those with liver disease.

==Chemistry==
Minocycline is a tetracycline derivative. It is closely structurally related to other tetracyclic antibiotics such as tetracycline, doxycycline, and tigecycline.

The drug is used in form of minocycline hydrochloride dihydrate, which is sparingly soluble in water and slightly soluble in ethanol. Minocycline reacts acidic in aqueous solution.

The partition coefficient (P) of minocycline has been reported to be 39.4 (i.e., log P of 1.60). However, other sources have stated the experimental log P of minocycline to be 0.05, 0.5, and 1.1. In any case, minocycline is consistently described as a highly lipophilic compound with excellent tissue penetration and distribution. It has been said to be unique among the tetracyclines in that it is the most lipophilic of all of the members of this group. Minocycline has 10 to 30times greater lipophilicity than tetracycline and 5times greater lipophilicity than doxycycline. The improved lipophilicity of minocycline is thought to be advantageous in terms of its clinical antibiotic effectiveness.

==History==
Minocycline was patented in 1961, was first described in the scientific literature in 1967, and came into commercial use in 1971. A topical foam for treatment of acne was approved in 2019.

==Research==
===Neuropsychiatric disorders===
Minocycline has been studied for treatment-resistant depression. According to a 2023 systematic review based on four clinical trials, &quot;There is no significant difference with minocycline compared to placebo for depression not responding to first-line antidepressant therapy.&quot;

Early research has found a tentative benefit from minocycline in schizophrenia, with several trials underway. A 2014 meta-analysis found minocycline may reduce negative and total symptom scores and was well tolerated.

Some early studies suggest that minocycline may be beneficial as an add-on treatment for moderate-to-severe obsessive-compulsive disorder (OCD) when used with an SSRI.

===Stroke and neurodegenerative diseases===
In ongoing research and trial, minocycline demonstrated efficacy and seems a promising neuroprotective agent in acute stroke patients, especially in AIS subgroup. Further RCTs are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of minocycline among ICH patients.

Research is examining the possible neuroprotective and anti-inflammatory effects of minocycline against the progression of a group of neurodegenerative disorders including multiple sclerosis, rheumatoid arthritis, Huntington&#x27;s disease, and Parkinson&#x27;s disease. As mentioned above, minocycline harms ALS patients.

A trial found no difference between minocycline and placebo in people with Alzheimers&#x27; disease. Minocycline is somewhat neuroprotective in mouse models of Huntington&#x27;s disease.

===Multiple sclerosis===
A 2007 study reported the impact of the antibiotic minocycline on clinical and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) outcomes and serum immune molecules in 40 MS patients over 24 months of open-label minocycline treatment. Despite a moderately high pretreatment relapse rate in the patient group prior to treatment (1.3/year pre-enrollment; 1.2/year during a three-month baseline period), no relapses occurred between months 6 and 24 on minocycline. Also, despite significant MRI disease-activity pretreatment (19/40 scans had gadolinium-enhancing activity during a three-month run-in), the only patient with gadolinium-enhancing lesions on MRI at 12 and 24 months was on half-dose minocycline. Levels of interleukin-12 (IL-12), which at high levels might antagonize the proinflammatory IL-12 receptor, were elevated over 18 months of treatment, as were levels of soluble vascular cell adhesion molecule-1 (VCAM-1). The activity of matrix metalloproteinase-9 was decreased by treatment. Clinical and MRI outcomes in this study were supported by systemic immunological changes and call for further investigation of minocycline in MS.

===Hearing protection===
Several preclinical studies (in vitro cell cultures and animal models) suggest that minocycline may have otoprotective benefits. Animal models indicate it could potentially reduce noise-induced and blast-induced hearing loss, possibly by protecting hair cells and mitigating inflammation. &quot;In vitro&quot; and animal studies also show minocycline may help decrease ototoxicity from certain drugs like gentamicin, neomycin, and cisplatin.

===Other uses===
Minocycline also has been used as a &quot;last-ditch&quot; treatment for toxoplasmosis in AIDS patients.

<text>The red-necked wallaby or Bennett&#x27;s wallaby (Notamacropus rufogriseus) is a medium-sized macropod marsupial (wallaby), common in the more temperate and fertile parts of eastern Australia, including Tasmania. Red-necked wallabies have been introduced to several other countries, including New Zealand, the United Kingdom (in England and Scotland), Ireland, the Isle of Man, France and Germany.

==Description==

Red-necked wallabies are distinguished by their black nose and paws, white stripe on the upper lip, and grizzled medium grey coat with a reddish wash across the shoulders. They can weigh and attain a head-body length of , although males are generally bigger than females. Red-necked wallabies are very similar in appearance to the black-striped wallaby (&quot;Notamacropus dorsalis&quot;), the only difference being that red-necked wallabies are larger, lack a black stripe down the back, and have softer fur. Red-necked wallabies may live up to nine years.

==Distribution and habitat==
Red-necked wallabies are found in coastal scrub and sclerophyll forest throughout coastal and highland eastern Australia, from Bundaberg, Queensland to the South Australian border; in Tasmania and on many of the Bass Strait islands. It is unclear which of the Tasmanian islands have native populations as opposed to introduced ones.

In Tasmania and coastal Queensland, their numbers have expanded over the past 30 years because of a reduction in hunting pressure and the partial clearing of forest to result in a mosaic of pastures where wallabies can feed at night, alongside bushland where they can shelter by day. For not altogether clear reasons, they are less common in Victoria.

==Behaviour==
Red-necked wallabies are mainly solitary but will gather together when there is an abundance of resources such as food, water or shelter. When they do gather in groups, they have a social hierarchy similar to other wallaby species. A recent study has demonstrated that wallabies, as other social or gregarious mammals, are able to manage conflict via reconciliation, involving the post-conflict reunion, after a fight, of former opponents, which engage in affinitive contacts. Red-necked wallabies are mainly nocturnal. They spend most of the daytime resting.

A female&#x27;s estrus lasts 33 days. During courting, the female first licks the male&#x27;s neck. The male will then rub his cheek against the female&#x27;s. Then the male and female will fight briefly, standing upright like two males. After that they finally mate. A couple will stay together for one day before separating. A female bears one offspring at a time; the young stay in the pouch for about 280 days, whereafter females and their offspring stay together for only a month. However, females may stay in the home range of their mothers for life, while males leave at the age of two. Also, red-necked wallabies engage in alloparental care, in which one individual may adopt the child of another. This is a common behavior seen in many other animal species like wolves, elephants, humans, and fathead minnows.

===Diet===
Red-necked wallabies diets consists of grasses, roots, tree leaves, and weeds.

==Subspecies==
There are two or three subspecies:
*&quot;N. r. banksianus&quot; (Quoy &amp; Gaimard, 1825) – red-necked wallaby [Australian mainland]
*&quot;N. r. rufogriseus&quot; (Desmarest, 1817) sensu lato – Bennett&#x27;s wallaby, which is sometimes replaced by:
** &quot;N. r. fruticus&quot; (Ogilby, 1838) [Tasmania] 
** &quot;N. r. rufogriseus&quot; (Desmarest, 1817) sensu stricto [Bass Strait, King Island]

The Tasmanian subspecies, &quot;Notamacropus rufogriseus rufogriseus&quot;, usually known as Bennett&#x27;s wallaby, is smaller (as island subspecies or species often are), has longer, darker and shaggier fur, and breeds in the late summer, mostly between February and April. They have adapted to living in proximity to humans and can be found grazing on lawns in the fringes of Hobart and other urban areas.

The mainland Australian subspecies, &quot;Notamacropus rufogriseus banksianus&quot;, usually known as the red-necked wallaby, breeds all year round. Captive animals maintain their breeding schedules; Tasmanian females that become pregnant out of their normal season delay birth until summer, which can be anywhere up to 8 months later.

==Introductions to other countries==
There are significant introduced populations in the Canterbury Region of New Zealand&#x27;s South Island. In 1870, several Bennett&#x27;s wallabies were transported from Tasmania to Christchurch, New Zealand. Two females and one male from this stock were later released at Te Waimate, the property of Waimate&#x27;s first European settler Michael Studholme. The year 1874 saw them freed in the Hunters Hills, where over the years their population has dramatically increased. Bennett&#x27;s wallabies are now resident on approximately 350,000 ha of terrain in the Hunters Hills, including the Two Thumb Range, the Kirkliston Range and the Grampians. They have been declared an animal pest in the Canterbury Region and land occupiers must contain the wallabies within specified areas. Bennett&#x27;s wallaby is now widely regarded as a symbol of Waimate.

There are also small colonies in England in the Peak District (extirpated), Derbyshire (extirpated), and the Ashdown Forest in East Sussex (population unknown). These were established ca. 1900. There are also other sightings frequently spotted in West Sussex and Hampshire and recently YouTuber &#x27;Wildlife With Cookie&#x27; found a population in an unknown part of England not associated with the previous mentioned locations. One of this small population was a mother carrying a joey, confirming that breeding was still occurring in the UK. He also went on to locate wallabies with albinism in Kenilworth, Warwickshire.

There is a small colony of red-necked wallabies on the island of Inchconnachan, Loch Lomond in Argyll and Bute, Scotland. This was founded in 1975 with two pairs taken from the Whipsnade Zoo, and had risen to 26 individuals by 1993.

There is a significant group of escaped red-necked wallabies living wild across the Isle of Man, which are the descendants of numerous escapes from a wildlife park on the island in the 1960s and 1970s. A 2017 study by estimated their number in the vicinity of the wildlife park to be 83 individuals, including a very small number of Parma wallabies. A 2023 study by the Manx Wildlife Trust using drone and thermal technology resulted in the first accurate count of the red-necked wallabies in the Ballaugh Curragh Area of Special Scientific Interest and Ramsar site. Two nocturnal surveys, carried out across 400 hectares of the Ballaugh Curragh over two consecutive nights, gave an average number of 568 wallabies with a density of 140 per km². As the survey site included surrounding agricultural land, it is thought the density would be higher when the wallabies retreat into the wet woodland during the day. Wallabies are now widely reported across the northern half of the Isle of Man. Along with concerns about inbreeding leading to a high prevalence of blindness and neurological disorders, there is concern that they are having a detrimental impact on the native ecology of the island, therefore the Isle of Man Government has classed them as an invasive, non-native species via listing on Schedule 8 of the Wildlife Act 1990.

The Baring family, who owned Lambay Island off the eastern coast of Ireland, introduced red-necked wallabies to the island in the 1950s and 1960s. In the 1980s, the red-necked wallaby population at the Dublin Zoo was growing out of control. Unable to find another zoo to take them, and unwilling to euthanize them, zoo director Peter Wilson donated seven individuals to the Barings. The animals have thrived since then and the current population is estimated to be between 30 and 50.

In France, in the southern part of the Forest of Rambouillet, west from Paris, there is a wild group of around 50–100 Bennett&#x27;s wallabies. This population has been present since the 1970s, when some individuals escaped from the zoological park of Émancé after a storm.

In Germany, a wild population originating from zoo escapees exists in the federated state of Mecklenburg-Vorpommern.

In October 2014, three captive Bennett&#x27;s wallabies escaped into the wild in northern Austria and one of them roamed the area for three months before being recaptured, surprisingly surviving the harsh winter there. The case attracted media attention, as it humorously defeated the popular slogan &quot;There are no kangaroos in Austria.&quot;

<text>Mike Rossman (born Michael Albert DePiano on July 1, 1955) is an American former professional boxer who was the WBA light heavyweight champion of the world. He is of both Italian and Jewish descent, which led to his monikers &quot;The Kosher Butcher&quot; and &quot;The Jewish Bomber&quot;.

==Life and career==
Rossman was born in Turnersville, New Jersey, as Michael Albert DePiano. Rossman is his mother&#x27;s maiden name, which he uses rather than that of his father. Rossman&#x27;s father was Italian, and his mother Jewish. He is Jewish, and boxed with a Star of David on his shorts. He began boxing at 14 and turned pro on August 10, 1973.

Rossman fought Víctor Galíndez for the light heavyweight championship of the world on the undercard of an Ali–Spinks rematch in September 1978. Many thought Galindez would defeat him, but Rossman opened up cuts over Galindez&#x27;s eyes and continued fighting until near the end of the 13th round, when the referee stopped the fight, and Rossman became world champion. Rossman made one successful defense before his hometown Philadelphia fans in December of the same year, stopping Italian challenger Aldo Traversaro in the fifth round after opening a wound on Aldo&#x27;s forehead with a left hook.

Later, after losing the title back to Galindez in 1979 (see below), his career declined as he lost several matches; he never again fought a title match. He fought into the early 1980s, and perhaps the biggest name he faced in post-championship status was the upstart Dwight Braxton (today known as Dwight Muhammad Qawi), who defeated him in seven rounds in May 1981.

===Rossman vs. Galindez championship rematch===
In February 1979, Rossman participated in what is sometimes considered one of professional boxing&#x27;s most embarrassing moments (at least in modern times). At a scheduled rematch between Rossman and Galindez, Rossman was left waiting in the ring as Galindez failed to appear: A dispute about the judges of the match between the WBA and the Nevada Athletic Commission prevented the fight from being for the title, so Galindez camp refused to fight. After immediate attempts to remedy the situation failed, the fight was suspended, and rescheduled two months later in April 1979.

With Rossman perhaps still fretting about boxing politics, Galindez was focused on regaining the title, and was able to defeat Rossman. Rossman apparently broke his right hand during the bout, severely limiting his boxing ability. The pain became worse over the course of the fight, and unbearable to a point where Rossman told his father-manager after the ninth round that he could not continue. Galindez was thus able to reclaim the championship.

<doc id="249282" wikidata="Q1277392" url="?curid=249282" title="Earl of Oxford">
<text>Earl of Oxford is a dormant title in the Peerage of England, first created for Aubrey de Vere by the Empress Matilda in 1141. His family was to hold the title for more than five and a half centuries, until the death of the 20th Earl in 1703. The de Veres were also hereditary holders of the office of Master Chamberlain of England from 1133 until the death of the 18th Earl in 1625. Their primary seat was Hedingham Castle in Essex, but they held lands in southern England and the Midlands, particularly in eastern England. The actual earldom was called &quot;Oxenford&quot; until at least the end of the 17th century. Medieval sources thus refer to &quot;my lord of Oxenford&quot; when speaking of the earl.

==Earls of Oxford (1141)==

Soon after his father&#x27;s death in 1141, Aubrey III de Vere was recruited by Empress Matilda. Aubrey&#x27;s brother-in-law, Geoffrey de Mandeville first earl of Essex, apparently negotiated the offer of the earldom of Cambridge, with a secondary offer of one of four counties if Cambridgeshire was claimed by her kinsman. Aubrey held no land in Oxfordshire at the time, but his eldest son Aubrey IV was to marry an heiress with manors in that county. Aubrey IV was supposedly an ally of King John, while his brother Robert, the 3rd Earl was one of the 25 barons of Magna Carta. His descendant, another Robert, the 9th Earl, was a favourite of King Richard II who created him Duke of Ireland. John the 13th Earl was a Lancastrian during the War of the Roses and Henry Tudor&#x27;s commander at the Battle of Bosworth Field in 1485. The 17th Earl has become the most famous of the line because of his emergence as a popular alternative candidate as the actual author of the works of William Shakespeare (see Oxfordian theory of Shakespeare authorship). The 17th Earl was a ward and later son-in-law of Lord Burghley, Queen Elizabeth I&#x27;s Secretary of State. On the death of the 20th Earl, without identifiable heirs male, the title became dormant.

The earls of Oxford held no subsidiary titles, and so their heirs apparent were styled by invented courtesy titles: initially Lord Vere, and later Viscount Bolebec (sometimes spelt Viscount Bulbeck).

The principal Oxford coat of arms or shield was quarterly gules and or (red and yellow) with an argent (white) five-pointed star called a mullet or molet in the first canton. By De Vere family tradition this molet is said to refer to a reappearance of the Star of Bethlehem which showed itself to an earlier De Vere while on a Crusade and thus led him to victory. In the 14th and 15th centuries, the family livery worn by their retainers was orange/tawney decorated with a white molet. A later badge associated with the De Veres is a blue boar. A later shield variation of the De Vere white molet has a smaller blue molet located within the white one but this may be a simple cadency mark – in heraldry the molet is also used in any family to indicate the third son of a title holder. The third son bears his father&#x27;s arms differenced with a molet.

A confusion between the De Vere white molet and Edward IV&#x27;s sunburst and white rose is said to have led to the friendly fire incident between Neville&#x27;s men and De Vere&#x27;s men at the Battle of Barnet in 1471. Fighting in fog, the Nevilles (former Yorkists) fired on their De Vere (staunch Lancastrian) allies and thus brought about the collapse of the Lancastrian centre and right. Both contingents began to rout crying &quot;treachery&quot;.

==Earls of Oxford and Earl Mortimer (1711)==
The title Earl of Oxford and Earl Mortimer was created in the Peerage of Great Britain for Robert Harley in 1711. It became extinct in 1853.

==Earls of Oxford and Asquith (1925)==
After the extinction of the earls of Oxford and earls Mortimer, former Prime Minister H. H. Asquith was keen to choose &quot;Earl of Oxford&quot; for his own title. As an earldom was then traditional for former prime ministers, and Asquith had a number of connections with the city of Oxford, it seemed a logical choice and had the king&#x27;s support. The proposal greatly offended the descendants of the earls, however, and, in the face of their opposition, another title had to be chosen – &quot;Earl of Oxford and Asquith&quot;. For information on this creation, see Earl of Oxford and Asquith.

<doc id="249290" wikidata="Q431355" url="?curid=249290" title="Modest Mouse">
<text>Modest Mouse is an American rock band formed in 1993 in Issaquah, Washington, and currently based in Portland, Oregon. The founding members were lead singer/guitarist Isaac Brock, drummer Jeremiah Green and bassist Eric Judy. They achieved critical acclaim for their albums &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; (1997) and &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; (2000) and found mainstream success with the release of &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; (2004) and its singles &quot;Float On&quot; and &quot;Ocean Breathes Salty&quot;.

From their 1996 debut album &quot;This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About&quot; onwards, the band&#x27;s lineup mostly centered on Brock and Green, undergoing multiple changes. As of 2024, Brock is the only original member of the band, Green having died in December 2022. Judy performed on every Modest Mouse album until his departure in 2012. Guitarist Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) joined the band in 2006, shortly following percussionist Joe Plummer (formerly of the Black Heart Procession) and multi-instrumentalist Tom Peloso, to work on the album &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot; (2007). Guitarist Jim Fairchild joined the band in 2009. The band&#x27;s sixth album, &quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot;, was released in 2015 and their seventh, &quot;The Golden Casket&quot;, in 2021.

== History ==
=== Formation and early years: 1992–1999 ===
When Isaac Brock was a teenager, he was employed at a local family video store just outside Seattle, where he met bassist Eric Judy. Brock and Judy later discovered drummer Jeremiah Green, who also resided near Seattle, at a heavy metal show, at which point they decided to make music together. Brock says he made a point of the band being from Issaquah to avoid association with the music scenes of Seattle or Olympia and to keep with the band&#x27;s suburban lyrical themes. In 1994, at Calvin Johnson&#x27;s Dub Narcotic Studios, Modest Mouse recorded its first EP, &quot;Blue Cadet-3, Do You Connect?&quot;, which was released by K Records. This was followed by a single, &quot;Broke&quot;, recorded by Steve Wold ( bluesman Seasick Steve) under Sub Pop records at Moon Studios in Olympia, Washington. During this time, Modest Mouse also recorded what would have been its first album, &quot;Sad Sappy Sucker&quot;, but constant delays caused the album to be shelved and forgotten. It was not until 2001 that it was officially released. Before the band made its way into the pop music world in 2004, many of Modest Mouse&#x27;s tours included stops at DIY/punk venues such as Speak in Tongues in Cleveland, Ohio, where they continued to play even after becoming popular enough to fill larger venues.

After moving to Up Records, Modest Mouse released two full-length albums and other recordings including the 1996 LP &quot;This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About&quot;. Steve Wold also recorded and produced this album (and at the time was assisting in the recordings as well, but was not officially part of the band) along with the next offering, &quot;Interstate 8&quot;. The 1997 album, &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; (also recorded at Moon Studios, by Scott Swayze) served as the band&#x27;s breakthrough. &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot; gained the band a cult following, and is now popularly considered to be one of the defining albums of mid-1990s indie rock. During this time, Nick Kraft became involved with the task of refining the band&#x27;s sound. Prior to its release, the band had recorded the EP &quot;The Fruit That Ate Itself&quot;. In 2000, Up Records released a singles and rarities collection entitled &quot;Building Nothing Out of Something&quot; that included the entirety of &quot;Interstate 8&quot; except for the songs &quot;Edit the Sad Parts&quot; and &quot;Buttons to Push the Buttons&quot;.

=== &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot;: 2000–2002 ===

In 2000, Modest Mouse released &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot;, its first album on Epic Records. The album, produced by Califone&#x27;s Brian Deck during five months of sessions in Chicago, was met with critical acclaim, including a 9.8/10 score from online music magazine Pitchfork Media, despite concerns about releasing material on a major label. The album would later receive further acclaim.

The band licensed &quot;Gravity Rides Everything&quot; for a Nissan Quest minivan advertisement, a move that Brock has publicly acknowledged as blatantly commercial but necessary to achieve financial stability. Regarding the commercial, Brock stated, &quot;People who don&#x27;t have to make their living playing music can bitch about my principles while they spend their parents&#x27; money or wash dishes for some asshole.&quot;

In 2001, Modest Mouse released the EP &quot;Everywhere and His Nasty Parlour Tricks&quot;, a collection of unused songs from the recording sessions of &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot;. In 2002, the band joined Cake, De La Soul, The Flaming Lips, The Hackensaw Boys and Kinky on the Unlimited Sunshine Tour.

===&quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; and &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot;: 2003–2009 ===

In March 2003, Green left the band after suffering a nervous breakdown; official reports stated he was leaving to work with his side project, Vells. The same year, he and Judy appeared on Adam Forkner&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;VVRSSNN&quot;. Drummer Benjamin Weikel joined the band, replacing Green, along with Murder City Devils guitarist Dann Gallucci, who had previously played with Modest Mouse. Prior to starting the band&#x27;s writing and recording process, Brock was devastated by the loss of &quot;a couple of the most important people in my life&quot;, he said. Following these events, the band released their fourth album, &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot;, on April 6, 2004. The following August, the album was certified Platinum, having two hits with &quot;Float On&quot; and &quot;Ocean Breathes Salty&quot; (both of which they performed on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; on November 13, 2004). The album was nominated for a Grammy Award for Best Alternative Music Album that year, and &quot;Float On&quot; was nominated for Best Rock Song. Green rejoined the band in May 2004, while Weikel returned to drumming exclusively for the Helio Sequence. The public radio program &quot;Marketplace&quot; used &quot;Float On&quot; as bumper music, which helped propel the group to a broader audience.

In 2006, Johnny Marr (formerly of the Smiths) joined the band after Gallucci quit amicably. Modest Mouse released their next album, &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot;, on March 20, 2007 after its original release date of December 19, 2006 was delayed. The album also included bonus track and single &quot;King Rat&quot;, which actor Heath Ledger had known about before the track was released; the band was formally introduced to the actor while on their 2007 tour in Australia. Ledger proposed an outline for a music video to the group, and with his film collective, the Masses, immediately began working on it once he had the band&#x27;s approval. Upon Ledger&#x27;s death in January 2008, the video went unfinished.

&quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot; was the first Modest Mouse album to reach No. 1 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts and had the hit single &quot;Dashboard&quot;, as well as &quot;Missed the Boat&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ve Got Everything&quot;. Modest Mouse released singles for the songs &quot;Satellite Skin&quot;, &quot;Autumn Beds&quot; and &quot;Perpetual Motion Machine&quot; in limited edition—a total of 4,000 copies each—vinyl 7 inches, featuring artwork by art director and illustrator Joshua Marc Levy, J. Alex Stamos, and Natasha Wheat.

The band began a North American tour in June 2008. They returned to Florida, with three shows in Miami, Orlando and St. Augustine, for the first time since they were cut off stage early during the November 2006 Bang Music Festival show. Modest Mouse finished its tour supporting &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot; after two years of promoting the record.

Marr left Modest Mouse to join the Cribs, and was replaced with Jim Fairchild, beginning with the tour of &quot;No One&#x27;s First and You&#x27;re Next&quot;, which was released on August 4, 2009, composed of unreleased tracks from the recording sessions of &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; and &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot;.

=== Touring, lineup changes, and re-releases: 2010–2014 ===
In 2010, &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot; was re-released on vinyl as part of Record Store Day.

On July 4, 2010 the band headlined the second day of the 80/35 Music Festival in Des Moines, Iowa, and the first day of the End of the Road Festival in Dorset, England, on September 10, 2010. At the end of August 2010, Modest Mouse played on the main stage at the Leeds and Reading festivals.

On May 29, Modest Mouse played two new songs during their headline of the Sasquatch festival. The songs were called &quot;Poison the Well&quot; and &quot;Lampshades on Fire&quot;.
They then contributed a cover of the Buddy Holly song &quot;That&#x27;ll Be the Day&quot; to the compilation &quot;Rave On Buddy Holly&quot;, which was released on June 28, 2011. Modest Mouse played at Splendour in the Grass in Woodford, Queensland on July 29, 2011, and at The Warfield in San Francisco on January 25, 2012.

In 2012, Modest Mouse underwent a significant lineup change, which included the departure of founding bassist Eric Judy and percussionist Joe Plummer, replaced by Russell Higbee (formerly of Man Man) and Davey Brozowski, respectively. The lineup also included the additions of multi-instrumentalist and vocalist Lisa Molinaro, and percussionist Ben Massarella, the latter of whom previously played percussion on &quot;The Moon &amp; Antarctica&quot;.

In June of that same year, Pitchfork.tv released a 45-minute documentary on &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot;, which included archival footage taken during live performances and original recording/mix sessions.

Modest Mouse played a Saturday afternoon set at the inaugural Firefly Music Festival in July 2012. Modest Mouse was one of the main acts in the Good Vibes Festival held in Sepang, Malaysia on August 17, 2013. The lineup featured other internationally renowned bands such as Smashing Pumpkins, Ash, and Japandroids. In April 2013, Modest Mouse performed at Coachella Music Festival in Indio, California. They also performed at the 2014 Hangout Music Festival in Gulf Shores, Alabama, in May 2014. They later performed as a headliner at Shaky Knees music festival in Atlanta, Georgia on May 10, 2014, and also headlined Sunday May 25 at Boston Calling in Massachusetts. Modest Mouse then performed at Hudson Valley Music Project in Saugerties, NY in July, 2014. The band&#x27;s final performance of 2014 took place in Inglewood, California during the annual KROQ Almost Acoustic Christmas.

In the fall of 2014 Modest Mouse re-released their first two albums, &quot;This Is a Long Drive for Someone with Nothing to Think About&quot; and &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot;, on CD and vinyl through Isaac Brock&#x27;s Glacial Pace record label.

===&quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot;, &quot;The Golden Casket&quot; and Jeremiah Green&#x27;s death: 2015–2022===
Eight years after the release of &quot;We Were Dead Before the Ship Even Sank&quot;, Modest Mouse released &quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot; on March 17, 2015. On December 15, 2014, they released the lead single &quot;Lampshades on Fire&quot; which debuted on Twin Cities public radio station 89.3 The Current. On December 16, 2014, Modest Mouse made &quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot; available for pre-order for CD and LP formats on the Glacial Pace website and on the iTunes store. 

In 2015, Brock described the follow-up album to &quot;Strangers to Ourselves&quot; as being like a part two to the latter album that they would try to release as soon as legally possible. The follow-up album has also been said to feature at least one song with Nirvana bassist Krist Novoselic. 

Throughout 2019, the band released three standalone singles; &quot;Poison the Well&quot; on March 29, &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot; on April 18, and &quot;Ice Cream Party&quot; on November 15.

Modest Mouse released their seventh studio album, &quot;The Golden Casket&quot;, on June 25, 2021. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;We Are Between&quot;, was released on May 5, followed by its second single, “Leave a Light On”, released on May 24. Writing for the &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot;, music critic Mark Richardson gave a mixed review of the album. Richardson described the tracks on the first half of the album as &quot;sound[ing] like busy arrangements in search of a song&quot;, and noted that &quot;Mr. Brock&#x27;s ear for hooks just barely rescues the tracks from the seriously overstuffed production.&quot; Richardson noted that the back half of the album contained the biggest highlights, which he described as &quot;quite good&quot;. Richardson was particularly fond of the album&#x27;s stripped-down finale, &quot;Back to the Middle&quot;, which he noted &quot;hints at what should be [the band&#x27;s] next change-up: Keep it simple. If the songs are strong and the performances are there, guitar, bass and drums will be more than enough.

In an interview in 2022, celebrating 15 years of &quot;We Were Dead before The Ship Even Sank&quot;, Isaac Brock and Johnny Marr revealed that they were writing songs together again, the first of which is called &quot;Rivers of Rivers&quot;. The writing took place in a &quot;pen pal&quot; kind of way, with Brock saying that there were more songs to be developed in 2022 together &quot;once the world tilts back on its axis&quot;.

In July 2022 the band was mixing a nine-song companion EP to &quot;The Golden Casket&quot;, with Marr confirmed to appear on one of the tracks.

In the midst of a tour celebrating the 25th anniversary of &quot;The Lonesome Crowded West&quot;, drummer and founding member Jeremiah Green took an unannounced leave of absence. Days after his Stage IV cancer diagnosis was revealed to the public, Green died on December 31, 2022.

===&quot;Good News&quot;–era reunion and future: 2023–present===
The band is co-headlining a North American tour with the Pixies in the Summer of 2024. 

In April 2024, Brock announced that he was planning on reuniting the band&#x27;s 2004 line-up which recorded &quot;Good News for People Who Love Bad News&quot; for a tour in celebration of the record.

==Musical style==
Marcy Donelson of AllMusic called Modest Mouse&#x27;s sound &quot;a volatile mix of punk-inspired rawness and simmering atmosphere&quot; showing tendencies of &quot;light-hearted pop&quot;. The band&#x27;s early releases were said to be a mix of emo, post-rock, folk and progressive music. Frontman Isaac Brock&#x27;s lyrical themes tend to explore topics such as small-town life and religion.

<text>Ellington Airport is a public and military use airport in Harris County, Texas, United States. It is owned by the City of Houston&#x27;s department of aviation, Houston Airport System and located southeast of downtown Houston. Formerly known as Ellington Field, then Ellington Air Force Base, then again as Ellington Field it is included in the National Plan of Integrated Airport Systems for 2011–2015, which categorized it as a general aviation reliever airport. The airport does not have scheduled commercial passenger service. However, Continental Airlines used to operate daily regional services between Ellington and Houston&#x27;s George Bush Intercontinental Airport between 1990 and 2004. On 17 October 2018, the City of Houston approved Phase 1 of the Houston Spaceport project on the Ellington Airport site.

== History ==
Established by the Army Air Service on 21 May 1917, Ellington Field was one of the initial World War I Army Air Service installations when aviation was in its infancy. It is named for 1st Lt. Eric Ellington, a U.S. Army aviator who was killed in a plane crash in San Diego, California in 1913. Originally created as a training facility, Ellington Airport is currently used by military, commercial, NASA aircraft and general aviation sectors. Ellington Airport is one of the few airfields built for World War I training purposes still in operation today.

For additional history related to Ellington&#x27;s status as a military airfield, see Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base.

The City of Houston annexed Ellington Field in the late 1960s.

In January 2009, a name change from Ellington Field to Ellington Airport was approved by the Houston City Council. In August 2011, the city announced that the facility would be renamed Ellington International Airport. However, as of May 2013, it is still listed as Ellington Airport by the Federal Aviation Administration and the Houston Airport System.

In April 2014, Sierra Nevada Corporation signed an agreement with Houston Airport System officials to explore development of Ellington as a commercial spaceport. The ultimate goal of the agreement is to use Ellington as a landing site for the company&#x27;s Dream Chaser spaceplane. A feasibility study found it would cost US$48 million to $122 million to equip Ellington for landing and launching small space vehicles on a regular basis. With federal approval in June 2015, Ellington Airport was granted a Launch Site License from the Federal Aviation Administration that established the airport as the 10th commercial spaceport in the United States. On 17 October 2018, the city council approved Phase 1 funding of $18.8 million for improvements to streets, water, wastewater, electrical power distribution facilities and communications facilities on the site.

In September 2017, the Lone Star Flight Museum moved from Galveston&#x27;s Scholes International Airport at Galveston to Ellington, a move that had been in the works since the aftermath of Hurricane Ike in 2008. The Museum built a brand new facility at Ellington to house its airworthy and static aircraft, as well as its Texas Aviation Hall of Fame. The facility is complete with training centers and administrative space, allowing the Museum to operate solely from Ellington.

Groundbreaking on Phase 1 was held in 2019 to include providing streets, water, wastewater, electrical power distribution facilities, and fiber optic and communications facilities necessary to attract future development.

==Overview==

Ellington Airport consists of three active runways (a ILS CAT I runway, an runway, and a runway). The airport supports the operations of the United States military, NASA and a variety of general aviation tenants. The field is a base for NASA&#x27;s administrative, cargo transport and high-altitude aircraft, which also includes NASA&#x27;s fleet of T-38 Talon jets bailed to the agency from USAF, Gulfstream Shuttle Training Aircraft, and a former USN C-9 nicknamed the &quot;Weightless Wonder VI&quot; which replaced the former USAF NKC-135 aircraft known as the Vomit Comet, a zero-g trainer. The only three WB-57F aircraft (used for atmospheric research and reconnaissance) still flying in the world today are housed at Ellington.

The Texas Air National Guard, Texas Army National Guard and the U.S. Coast Guard also maintain a presence at the base. The Coast Guard facility known as Coast Guard Air Station Houston operates 3 Eurocopter MH-65C &quot;Dolphin&quot; Short-Range Recovery (SRR) helicopters for search and rescue (SAR) and port security roles. Several flight schools reside at the airfield. Ellington Field is also home to the largest flying club in Texas and the annual &quot;Wings Over Houston&quot; airshow.

Ellington Field once had scheduled commercial air service: Continental Express flights between Ellington Airport and George Bush Intercontinental Airport in north Houston ended in 2004. Prior to the cessation of commercial air service, the route flown between Bush Intercontinental and Ellington Field was the shortest fixed-wing route flown in the United States at only . Flight times were as short as six minutes, depending on direction of departure. To this day, Ellington Field serves as a reliever airport for both Bush Intercontinental and the William P. Hobby Airport, and handles diverted aircraft from those two airports during bad weather events and peak traffic times. A terminal aerodrome forecast is produced for the airfield 365 days a year at 20Z, 04Z, and 12Z by the 26th Operational Weather Squadron, a USAF weather squadron.

== Facilities and aircraft ==
Ellington Field covers an area of at an elevation of above mean sea level.

It has three runways with concrete surfaces:

*Runway 4/22 is 
*Runway 17R/35L is 
*Runway 17L/35R is 

For the 12-month period ending 31 December 2022, the airport had 115,958 aircraft operations, an average of 317 per day: 74% general aviation, 15% military, 9% air taxi, and 2% scheduled commercial. At that time there were 95 aircraft based at this airport: 32 single-engine, 30 jet, 8 multi-engine, and 25military.

The Lone Star Flight Museum, which was located at Scholes from 1985 until 2017, maintains a fleet of airworthy warbirds including: North American B-25 Mitchell Bomber, Douglas A24 Banshee (Decorated as an SBD-5 Dauntless), Vought F4U Corsair, General Motors (Eastern Aircraft) TBM Avenger, Grumman F6F Hellcat, General Motors FM-2 Wildcat, North American AT-6 Texan, Beech AT-11 Kansan, Cessna AT-17 Bobcat, Stinson L-5, Douglas DC-3, and Stearman PT-17.

The Air National Guard maintains ARFF equipment for use mainly on military aircraft, however they also respond to private emergencies.

<doc id="249294" wikidata="Q16851816" url="?curid=249294" title="Kāwanatanga">
<text>Kāwanatanga is a word in the Māori language of New Zealand, derived from the English word &quot;governor&quot;. &quot;Kāwanatanga&quot; was first used in the Declaration of Independence of New Zealand, 1835. &quot;Kāwanatanga&quot; reappeared in 1840 in Article 1 of the Treaty of Waitangi, where the Māori text &quot;&quot;te Kawanatanga katoa&quot; corresponds to the English text &quot;all the rights and powers of Sovereignty&quot;&quot;.

&quot;Kāwanatanga&quot; is often translated today as governance or government.

==Origin and etymology==
The first part of the word, &quot;Kāwana&quot;, is a transliteration into Māori of the English word &quot;governor&quot;. The suffix &quot;-tanga&quot; is very similar in meaning and use to the English suffix &quot;-ship&quot;, for example &quot;rangatiratanga&quot; (chieftainship) and &quot;kīngitanga&quot; (kingship). So a literal translation of the word would be &quot;governorship&quot;. This word had little meaning to the chiefs signing the treaty, since the concept of being governed by an overseeing authority was alien to Māori. What understanding Māori may have had of the term was derived principally from the Bible and in particular Herod&#x27;s Governorship. At the time the Bible was one of few long printed texts in Māori enjoying wide distribution.

Judith Binney has suggested that the chiefs may have assumed the term referred to the governor, William Hobson, and understood it as referring to his governorship rather than understanding that they were ceding &quot;governance&quot;.

Historians Ranginui Walker and Ruth Ross have suggested that the word &quot;mana&quot; may have been a more appropriate meaning, and note that if &quot;mana&quot; had been used instead of &quot;kāwanatanga&quot;, the treaty may never have been signed by Māori.

==Use in the Treaty of Waitangi==
The meaning attached to this word, and in particular how it relates to &quot;rangatiratanga&quot; is important to discussion of the Treaty of Waitangi. This treaty is still important in contemporary New Zealand, and remains the topic of controversy and political debate. 

Anthropologist Hugh Kawharu has made a contemporary translation of the treaty using the term ‘government’, rather than ‘sovereignty’, for ‘kāwanatanga’. Kawharu noted, ‘There could be no possibility of the Māori signatories having any understanding of government in the sense of “sovereignty”: ie, any understanding on the basis of experience or cultural precedent.’

Māori constitutional lawyer Moana Jackson has stated that, because the New Zealand Government (identified as &quot;Kawanatanga&quot; in the Treaty text) is the body politic enforcing the Treaty and making settlements, &quot;Kawanatanga&quot; is the actual party to the Treaty, not the Crown.

<doc id="249299" wikidata="Q1148977" url="?curid=249299" title="Zhu Bajie">
<text>Zhu Bajie, also named Zhu Wuneng, is one of the three helpers of Tang Sanzang, along with Sun Wukong and Sha Wujing, and a major character of the 16th century novel &quot;Journey to the West&quot;. &quot;Zhu&quot; means &quot;swine&quot; and &quot;Bajie&quot; means &quot;eight precepts&quot;. Prior to his being recruited by the bodhisattva, Guanyin, Zhu Bajie went by &quot;Zhu Gāngliè&quot; (豬剛巤; literally &quot;Strong-Maned Pig&quot;). Buddhist scholars consider that both expressions are related to &quot;Śīla pāramitā&quot;. In many English versions of the story, Zhu Bajie is called &quot;[[Monk]] Pig&quot;, &quot;Pig&quot;, &quot;Piggy&quot;, or &quot;Pigsy&quot;.

Zhu Bajie is a complex and developed character in the novel. He looks like a terrible humanoid-pig monster, part human and part pig, who often gets himself and his companions into trouble through his laziness, gluttony, and propensity for lusting after pretty women. He looks up to his senior disciple Sun Wukong as a big brother. Though he occasionally acts rebelliously when injured by Wukong&#x27;s constant teasing, his schemes usually end in his own humiliation.

His Buddhist name &quot;Zhu Wuneng&quot;, given by Bodhisattva Guanyin, means &quot;pig (reincarnated) who is aware of ability&quot; or &quot;pig who rises to power&quot;, a reference to the fact that he values himself so much as to forget his own grisly appearance. Tang Sanzang gave him the nickname &quot;Bājiè&quot; which means &quot;eight restraints&quot; or &quot;eight commandments&quot; to remind him of his Buddhist diet.

In the original Chinese novel, he is often called &quot;dāizi&quot; (), meaning &quot;idiot&quot;. Sun Wukong, Tang Sanzang, and even the author consistently refers to him as &quot;the idiot&quot; over the course of the story. Bodhisattvas and other heavenly beings usually refer to him as &quot;Tiānpéng&quot; (天蓬), his former title when he was a heavenly marshal.

In modern times, Zhu Bajie is seen as a patron deity of masseuses, hostesses, and prostitutes within Taiwan and other parts of East Asia.

==Character==
Zhu Bajie originally held the title of &quot;Tiānpéng Yuánshuài&quot; (天篷元帅; lit. &quot;Marshal Canopy&quot;), commander-in-chief of 80,000 Celestial sailors. However, he was later banished for misbehavior. At a party organized for all the significant figures in Heaven, Bajie saw the Chang&#x27;e (goddess of the Moon) for the first time and was captivated by her beauty. Following a drunken attempt to seduce her, she reported this to the Jade Emperor and thus he was banished to Earth. In popular retellings, Zhu Bajie was sentenced to a thousand lives where each life would end in a love tragedy. In some retellings of the story, his banishment is linked to Sun Wukong&#x27;s downfall. In any case, he was exiled from Heaven and sent to be reincarnated on Earth, where by mishap he fell into a pig well and was reborn as a man-eating pig-monster known as &quot;Zhū Gāngliè&quot; (猪刚鬛 the &quot;strong-maned pig&quot;).

In the earlier portions of &quot;Journey to the West&quot;, Wukong and Tang Sanzang come to Gao village and find that a daughter of the village elder had been kidnapped and the abductor left a note demanding marriage. In some versions of the story Bajie has convinced the elder to allow him to marry the daughter based on his ability to do large amounts of hard work due to his prodigious strength. The elder recants when he discovers that, although Zhu Bajie manages to do quite a lot of work in the fields, he manages to eat so much that the farm is losing money anyway. After some investigations, Wukong found out that Bajie was the &quot;villain&quot; behind this. He fought with Wukong, who learns after beating him that he has also been recruited by Guanyin to join their pilgrimage and make atonements for his past sins.

At the end of the novel, most of Bajie&#x27;s fellow pilgrims achieve enlightenment and become arhats, but he does not; although much improved, he is still too much a creature of his base desires. He is instead rewarded for his part in the pilgrimage&#x27;s success with a job as &quot;Cleanser of the Altars&quot; () and all the leftovers he can eat. However, his actual rank in relation to the others is unclear, but possibly the lowest.

==Pre-existence==

In traditional Chinese Taoism, there is a divine goddess named Doumu Yuanjun (斗姆元君) who was acclaimed as the mother of all the constellations, even the Emperor Zi-Wei is her son. She has four faces while one of them is akin to a pig&#x27;s face. Tiānpéng Yuánshuài (天篷元帅; lit. &quot;Marshal Heavenly Mugwort&quot;) is one of her most significant understrappers, which is the head general of the North Pole.

According to the depiction in the chapter 217 of 《道法会元》, a biography of Taoism and Chinese mythical stories compiled in Ming Dynasty; Tiānpéng Yuánshuài was a blazing powerful marshal in the North Pole. A phrase depicts his appearance as:

He was scarily imposing with three heads and six arms, red hair, red armor all over; Holding a magic seal, an axe, a firm rope in left hands and a convulsion bell, a symbolic artifact of constellations and a long sword in right. He leads 360,000 warriors; travels along with scary and dark gas, in which there is a five-colored cloud. Numerous deities with great respect always greet his arrivals.

Under his reign, there are a mass of strong myrmidons, with a piece of description withdrawn from ancient books and records of Taoism, three of the most outstanding ones are:

# &quot;Mahatma of heaven&quot;: with height of over a hundred feet, wearing a light-colored gown, disheveled long hair, could create incantatory power with his fingers, holding a sharp sword in his right hand.
# &quot;The Great General of mixed pneuma&quot;: Wearing a high crest and golden corselet the whole body, equipped by a bow, an arrow, and a halberd.
# &quot;Four-eyed thunder marshal&quot;: Aged, with four eyes and a walks with a crutch. Accompanied by two august emissaries.

Also, there are 36 generals and a group of Divine warriors under his dominion; anyhow, as is depicted in myth of Chinese Taoism, he is the commander of a huge deity system in the Northern Pole, in which a great number of valiant deity generals and warriors who all controlled by the Emperor Zi-Wei.
In the novel, after he is punished and becomes Zhu Bajie, there is an obvious recession in both his confidence and power which makes him less militant and lazier as we can find in many parts in the original passage. However, with the remains of power he used to have in his preexistence, he is still capable of fighting against most of the devils appear in their way of journey and in this regard, Sun Wukong always prefers to bring him together when having battles with enemies although they have intermittent personal conflicts all the way.

==Nine-toothed rake==

The nine-toothed rake (, also known as the &quot;Baoqin gold palladium&quot; (寶沁金鈀)) is the primary weapon of Zhu Bajie. This phrase depicts the first point in which Bajie&#x27;s legendary nine-toothed rake had been used:

In another passage, Pig tells of his legendary rake while battling against Sun Wukong:

During their journey, he atrociously kills many demons with his rake, usually with nine blood-spurting holes in their head.

==Personality==

===Merits===
====Respectful====
Despite his previous identity as a great marshal who was in charge of 80,000 celestial marines, he always claims Sun Wukong as &quot;brother&quot; with awe and respect while Sun has conflicts with him and often makes fun of him all the way. Of course, another reason for it is he already knows Sun&#x27;s reputation of being a great fighter in his preexistence.

====Soft-hearted====
During the journey, many demons change their appearances into children and beautiful women, pretending to be in trouble to confuse them with the intention of eating their master Tang Sanzang. However, though Sun Wukong is capable of detecting demons, Zhu Bajie always manages to persuade his brother to release them rather than capturing or killing them, although his kindness often causes trouble and leads to disaster.

====Optimistic====

Though he is constantly captured by numerous demons throughout the journey, he still behaves normally; even when he is about to be eaten, he does not seem to be anxious compared to his other two mates. This is also related to his background as a marshal in preexistence; rich experience in coping with various incidents makes his emotions fluctuate less. In some readings of this book, it is said that Zhu Bajie deliberately does not use his real power on the journey as he knows every time Monkey King would come and save them all. Even if not, other deities would come and help them.

===Demerits===
====Gluttony====
In one part of the book, Zhu Bajie obtains a watermelon and splits it into four pieces to share with his colleagues equally. When he finds watermelon too delicious after finishing his own slice, he finds excuses to eat each piece one by one until he finishes the whole watermelon. He has a big appetite, which is fairly visible in many parts of the story.

====Laziness====
Zhu Bajie is given to laziness. He seemingly never cares about their troubles and works, and always finds excuses to procrastinate their expedition. Every time the four of them arrive in another country, the local people always welcome them with food and accommodation because they come from the Great Tang Empire, which was both culturally and economically influential to all the surrounding areas at that time. Zhu Bajie hence tends to find excuses to persuade his master to stay several more days for better abodes and food due to his greediness.

====Lust====
When he was a marshal in heaven, he dallied with Chang&#x27;e, which was the reason for his banishment. After his reincarnation he drools everytime he meets beauties. Because of his lust the group often sinks into various troubles and even disasters.

All in all, he was given a name that means &quot;eight resistances&quot;, which reminded him to resist temptations of the flesh, including lust, laziness, gluttony, and avarice.

<text>The Tangwai&quot; movement, or simply Tangwai&quot; (), was a loosely knit political movement in Taiwan in the mid-1970s and early 1980s. Although the ruling Kuomintang (KMT) had allowed contested elections for a small number of seats in the Legislative Yuan, opposition parties were still forbidden. As a result, many opponents of the KMT, officially classified as independents, ran and were elected as members &quot;outside the party.&quot; The movement was at times tolerated and other times suppressed, the latter being the case particularly after the Kaohsiung Incident of 1979. Members of the movement eventually formed the Democratic Progressive Party, which after opposition political parties were legalized, contested elections and won the presidency with candidate Chen Shui-bian, ending decades of single party rule in Taiwan.

==History==

Early figures associated with the movement include Kang Ning-hsiang and Huang Hsin-chieh. College professors led a series of demonstrations and open demands for political change in city streets. By 1973 the government began to arrest the leaders of this new movement and fire those professors who openly criticized the regime. While leading an authoritarian government, Chiang Ching-kuo appeared to be open minded to the possibility of political dissent.

Because the majority of seats in the Legislative Yuan were held by delegates purportedly representing constituencies in mainland China, who were elected in 1947 and appointed thereafter (because the &quot;electorate&quot; in mainland China was unable to cast votes in an election in the Taiwan Area), pending the promised retaking of mainland China, the &quot;tangwai&quot; movement had no possibility of gaining power. They were, however, able to use the legislature as a forum for debating the ruling KMT.

In response to more native Taiwanese taking public office, the &quot;tangwai&quot; attempted to contest elections in 1975-1976 and demand even more changes to the political system. The &quot;tangwai&quot; politicians were reluctant to associate themselves with the National Assembly, as those positions were ostensibly tied to constituencies on mainland China. They had been able to win victories in contests for the Taiwan Provincial Assembly where affiliated candidates were able to win 21 out of 77 seats. They also won in four of twenty magistrate and mayoral races. Irregularities in the vote counting process in the city of Zhongli, lead to violent clashes between protesters and police in what is now known as the Zhongli incident. Shih Ming-teh was released from prison soon after Zhongli, and attempted to involve himself with a Provincial Assembly election.

In 1979, the same year which the US ceased its recognition of the Republic of China, conflict between authorities and the &quot;tangwai&quot; again turned violent in the Kaohsiung Incident. The writers of a political publication called &quot;Formosa Magazine&quot; or &quot;Mei-li-tao&quot; planned a series of political marches, first in the southern city of Kaohsiung and later a larger one in Taipei, although the Taipei rally ended up not occurring due to the arrest of the magazine&#x27;s leaders. Police tapped phones and surveilled those associated with the magazine. On the day of the demonstration, activists took to the streets in a parade formation in Kaohsiung, but were diverted several times due to police blocking their intended route. They attempted to reorganize in Tainan, but many of their leaders were arrested over the next few days. Shih Ming-teh evaded arrest for several months by being harbored by members of the Presbyterian Church of Taiwan (PCT). Shih was sent to the infamous Green Island, as was PCT General Secretary Kau Chih-min. The Kaohsiung incident marked the end to open demonstrations by the &quot;tangwai&quot;. Faced with the struggle for diplomatic recognize by the international community, the Kuomintang-led government decided to end political dissent, determining that political activists outside of the party were giving the impression that the government was not stable.

Throughout the 1980s the Chiang administration continued to limit free speech. On the other hand, scholars argue that the various other demonstrations by common citizens helped keep the &quot;tangwai&quot; movement alive despite the mass imprisonment of its leaders. Examples of other social movements from both the middle and working classes which who staged public demonstrations included farmers protesting against corporate farms, and environmentalists opposing a proposed factory from DuPont to be built in Lukang.

The Presbyterian Church of Taiwan was linked to many members of the Tangwai, and the Church itself was at the center of government censure for publishing works in Romanized Taiwanese Hokkien in the 1970s. The government confiscated these works, which led the Church to appeal to the Carter administration of the United States to highlight what it considered a human rights violation.

Efforts to counter the &quot;tangwai&quot; may have included the opening of the political system to Taiwanese who did not hold radical beliefs. Various individuals helped recruit intellectuals to work within the Kuomintang. Sung Shih-hsuan, then chairman of the Provincial Party Committee, introduced social service orientation to local party work, perhaps in an effort to counter the social activism of the Presbyterian Church and Maryknoll order.

Members of the &quot;Tangwai&quot; movement formed the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) in 1986. Although still illegal, the KMT did not take action against the DPP and the party was legalized in 1991. Many current politicians in Taiwan, most notably former President Chen Shui-bian and Vice President Annette Lu, were active in the &quot;tangwai&quot; movement.

&quot;Tangwai&quot; members, including Shih Ming-teh and Lin Yi-hsiung, were often harassed or imprisoned by the KMT government, especially in the wake of the Kaohsiung Incident.

<text>Saoul Paul Mamby (June 4, 1947 – December 19, 2019) was an American professional boxer who fought between 1969 and 2008. He held the WBC super lightweight title from 1980 to 1982.

== Personal ==
Mamby was born in South Bronx, New York, to Victoria, of Spanish descent, and father, Robert, from Jamaica. He converted to Judaism at age 4, and went to Hebrew School at the Bronx&#x27;s Mount Horeb Synagogue.

Mamby became interested in boxing while on vacation in Jamaica. He began his boxing career in 1963 at the age of sixteen, fighting in the Golden Gloves in 1965 and 1966. He compiled an amateur record of 25–5 before turning pro in 1969.

Mamby was a soldier in the U.S. Army and served in Vietnam during the Vietnam War in 1968.

== Boxing career ==

He held the WBC super lightweight title once, starting his -year reign in February 1980 by going to South Korea to stop titlist Kim Sang-Hyun in the 14th round. After that, he made five successful defenses, travelling to Indonesia and Nigeria in the process. He stopped former WBC lightweight champion Esteban De Jesús in the 13th round in July 1980 on the Holmes-LeDoux undercard and decisioned Termite Watkins over 15 on the Holmes-Ali undercard. He won a 15-round nod over Jo Kimpuani on yet another undercard for a Larry Holmes fight against Leon Spinks. He then went to Indonesia to decision Thomas Americo.

In his last bout leaving the ring as champion, he decisioned Obisia Nwankpa in Nigeria.

He was to fight WBA champion Aaron Pryor in the summer of 1982 for a unification bout in the super lightweight division, but instead fought and lost his WBC title by split decision to Leroy Haley in June of that year.

He would play the role of world title challenger twice more, once in a rematch with Haley in February 1983 which he lost in a 12-round unanimous decision. He then challenged new champion Billy Costello in November 1984 but lost another 12-round unanimous decision.

Other boxers Mamby fought include Roberto Durán to whom he lost by points in a non-title fight in 1976, and Saensak Muangsurin to whom he lost in a 15-round decision in Thailand in 1977 in an attempt to win Muangsurin&#x27;s WBC title.

Mamby continued to fight into his 50s, and was forced to retire by the California State athletic commission following his last loss in 2000.

=== Comeback at 60 ===
At the age of 60, Mamby announced a comeback which was to have taken place in Lapwai, Idaho at the Pi-Nee-Waus Community Center of the Nez Perce Tribe, in a card that was subsequently canceled.

Mamby fought several weeks later, weighing 149 pounds (67 kilograms) and lost a ten-round decision to journeyman fighter Anthony Osbourne in the Cayman Islands. As a result, Mamby became one of the oldest boxers to appear in an officially sanctioned bout. It was Mamby&#x27;s eleventh loss in his last 14 fights.

Mamby was known for his ability to take punches well; in 85 professional bouts, he was stopped only once, that by an opponent who was several years younger, Derell Coley, in 1993. On June 23, 2024 Mamby was inducted into the Florida Boxing Hall of Fame.

<doc id="249313" wikidata="Q32133" url="?curid=249313" title="Lysimachus">
<text>Lysimachus (; Greek: Λυσίμαχος, &quot;Lysimachos&quot;; c. 360 BC – 281 BC) was a Thessalian officer and successor of Alexander the Great, who in 306 BC, became king of Thrace, Asia Minor and Macedon.

==Early life and career==
Lysimachus was born in circa 360 BC, to a family of Thessalian stock but they were citizens of Pella in Macedonia. He was the second son of Agathocles and his wife; there is some indication in the historical sources that this wife was perhaps named Arsinoe, and that Lysimachus&#x27; paternal grandfather may have been called Alcimachus. His father was a nobleman of high rank who was an intimate friend of Philip II of Macedon, who shared in Philip II’s councils and became a favourite in the Argead court. Lysimachus and his brothers grew up with the status of Macedonians; all these brothers enjoyed with Lysimachus prominent positions in Alexander’s circle and, like him, were educated at the Macedonian court in Pella.

Pausanias and the historian Justin both record a story that Alexander had Lysimachus thrown to a lion as a punishment. According to Justin this was because Lysimachus had smuggled poison to a person Alexander had condemned to a slow death. Both Pausanias and Justin report that Lysimachus overcame the lion with his bare hands and subsequently became one of Alexander&#x27;s favorites. Some coins issued during Lysimachus&#x27;s appointment had his image on one side and a lion on the other.

He was probably appointed &quot;Somatophylax&quot; during the reign of Philip II. During Alexander&#x27;s Persian campaigns, in 328 BC he was one of his immediate bodyguards. In 324 BC, in Susa, he was awarded a ceremonial crown in recognition of his actions in India. After Alexander&#x27;s death in 323 BC, he was appointed to the government of Thrace as &quot;strategos&quot; although he faced some difficulties from the Thracian king Seuthes.

==Diadochi==

In 315 BC, Lysimachus joined Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus against Antigonus, who, however, diverted his attention by stirring up Thracian and Scythian tribes against him. However, he managed to consolidate his power in the east of his territories, suppressing a revolt of the cities on the Black Sea coast.

In 309 BC, he founded Lysimachia in a commanding situation on the neck connecting the Chersonese with the mainland, forming a bulwark against the Odrysians.

In 306/305 BC, Lysimachus followed the example of Antigonus and assumed the royal title.

In 302 BC, when the second alliance between Cassander, Ptolemy and Seleucus was made, Lysimachus, reinforced by troops from Cassander, entered Asia Minor, where he met with little resistance. On the approach of Antigonus he retired into winter quarters near Heraclea, marrying its widowed queen Amastris, a Persian princess. Seleucus joined him in 301 BC, and at the Battle of Ipsus Antigonus was defeated and slain. Antigonus&#x27; dominions were divided among the victors. Lysimachus&#x27; share was Lydia, Ionia, Phrygia and the north coast of Asia Minor.

Feeling that Seleucus was becoming dangerously powerful, Lysimachus now allied himself with Ptolemy, marrying his daughter Arsinoe II of Egypt. Amastris, who had divorced herself from him, returned to Heraclea. When Antigonus&#x27; son Demetrius I renewed hostilities (297 BC), during his absence in Greece, Lysimachus seized his towns in Asia Minor, but in 294 BC concluded a peace whereby Demetrius was recognized as ruler of Macedonia. He tried to carry his power beyond the Danube, but was defeated and taken prisoner by the Getae king Dromichaetes (or Dromihete), who, however, set him free in 292 BC on amicable terms in return for Lysimachus surrendering the Danubian lands he had captured. Demetrius subsequently threatened Thrace, but had to retire due to a sudden uprising in Boeotia and an attack from King Pyrrhus of Epirus.

In 287 BC, Lysimachus and Pyrrhus in turn invaded Macedonia and drove Demetrius out of the country. Lysimachus left Pyrrhus in possession of Macedonia with the title of king for around seven months before Lysimachus invaded. For a short while the two ruled jointly but in 285 BC Lysimachus expelled Pyrrhus, seizing complete control for himself.

==Later years==
Domestic troubles embittered the last years of Lysimachus’ life. Amastris had been murdered by her two sons; Lysimachus treacherously put them to death. On his return, Arsinoe II asked the gift of Heraclea, and he granted her request, though he had promised to free the city. In 284 BC Arsinoe, desirous of gaining the succession for her sons in preference to Lysimachus’ first child, Agathocles, intrigued against him with the help of Arsinoe&#x27;s paternal half-brother Ptolemy Keraunos; they accused him of conspiring with Seleucus to seize the throne, and Agathocles was put to death.

This atrocious deed by Lysimachus aroused great indignation. Many of the cities of Asia Minor revolted, and his most trusted friends deserted him. The widow of Agathocles and their children fled to Seleucus, who at once invaded the territory of Lysimachus in Asia Minor. In 281 BC, Lysimachus crossed the Hellespont into Lydia and at the decisive Battle of Corupedium was killed. After some days his body was found on the field, protected from birds of prey by his faithful dog. Lysimachus&#x27; body was given over to another son, Alexander, by whom it was interred at Lysimachia.

==Marriages and children==
Lysimachus was married three times and his wives were:
* First marriage: Nicaea, a Greek (Macedonian) noblewoman and daughter of the powerful regent Antipater. Lysimachus and Nicaea married in c. 321 BC. Nicaea bore Lysimachus three children:
** Son, Agathocles
** Daughter, Eurydice
** Daughter, Arsinoe I
Nicaea most probably died by 302 BC. 
* Second marriage: Persian Princess Amastris. Lysimachus married her in 302 BC. Amastris and Lysimachus’ union was brief, as he ended their marriage and divorced her in 300/299 BC. 
* Third marriage: Ptolemaic Greek Princess Arsinoe II. Arsinoe II married Lysimachus in 300/299 BC and remained with him until his death in 281 BC. Arsinoe II bore Lysimachus three sons:
** Ptolemy I Epigonos
** Lysimachus
** Philip
From an Odrysian concubine he had a son borne to him called Alexander.

<text>A wreath () is an assortment of flowers, leaves, fruits, twigs, or various materials that is constructed to form a ring shape.

In English-speaking countries, wreaths are used typically as household ornaments, most commonly as an Advent and Christmas decoration. They are also used in ceremonial events in many cultures around the globe. They can be worn as a chaplet around the head, or as a garland around the neck.

== Etymology ==

The word &quot;wreath&quot; comes from Middle English &quot;wrethe&quot; and from Old English &quot;writha&quot; &#x27;band&#x27;.

== History ==

=== Ancient Etruscan wreaths ===

Wreaths were a design used in ancient times in southern Europe. The most well-known are pieces of Etruscan civilization jewelry, made of gold or other precious metals. Symbols from Greek myths often appear in the designs, embossed in precious metal at the ends of the wreath. Ancient Roman writers referred to Etruscan &quot;corona sutilis&quot;, which were wreaths with their leaves sewn onto a background. These wreaths resemble a diadem, with thin metal leaves being attached to an ornamental band. Wreaths also appear stamped into Etruscan medallions. The plants shown making the wreaths in Etruscan jewelry include ivy, oak, olive leaves, myrtle, laurel, wheat and vines.

Wreaths were worn as crowns by Etruscan rulers. The Etruscan symbolism continued to be used in Ancient Greece and Rome. Roman magistrates also wore golden wreaths as crowns, as a symbolic testament to their lineage back to Rome&#x27;s early Etruscan rulers. Roman magistrates also used several other prominent Etruscan symbols in addition to a golden wreath crown: fasces, a curule chair, a purple toga, and an ivory rod.

=== Ancient Greece and Rome ===


In the Greco-Roman world, wreaths were used as an adornment that could represent a person&#x27;s occupation, rank, their achievements and status. The wreath that was commonly used was the laurel wreath. The use of this wreath comes from the Greek myth involving Apollo, Zeus&#x27; son and the god of life and light, who fell in love with the nymph Daphne. When he pursued her she fled and asked the river god Peneus to help her. Peneus turned her into a laurel tree. From that day, Apollo wore a wreath of laurel on his head. Laurel wreaths became associated with what Apollo embodied; victory, achievement and status and would later become one of the most commonly used symbols to address achievement throughout Greece and Rome. Laurel wreaths were used to crown victorious athletes at the original Olympic Games and are still worn in Italy by university students who just graduated.

Other types of plants used to make wreath crowns also had symbolic meaning. For example, oak leaves symbolized wisdom, and were associated with Zeus, who according to Greek mythology made his decisions while resting in an oak grove. The Twelve Tables, dating to 450 BC, refer to funeral wreaths as a long-standing tradition. Olive wreath was the prize for the winner at the ancient Olympic Games.

== Modern wreaths ==
=== Advent and Christmas wreaths ===

In Christianity, wreaths are used to observe the Advent season, in preparation for Christmastide and Epiphanytide, as well as to celebrate the latter two liturgical seasons. These wreaths, as with other Advent and Christmas decorations, are often set up on the first Sunday of Advent, a custom that is sometimes done liturgically, through a hanging of the greens ceremony. The Advent wreath was first used by Lutherans in Germany in the 16th century, and in 1839, Lutheran priest Johann Hinrich Wichern used a wreath made from a cart wheel to educate children about the meaning and purpose of Christmas, as well as to help them count its approach, thus giving rise to the modern version of the Advent wreath. For every Sunday of Advent, starting with the fourth Sunday before Christmas, he would put a white candle in the wreath and for every day in between he would use a red candle. The use of the Advent wreath has since spread from the Lutheran Church to many Christian denominations, and some of these traditions, such as the Catholic Church and Moravian Church, have introduced unique variations to it. All of the Advent wreaths, however, have four candles, and many of them have a white candle in the centre, the Christ candle, which is lit on Christmas Day. Advent and Christmas wreaths are constructed of evergreens to represent everlasting life brought through Jesus and the circular shape of the wreath represents God, with no beginning and no end. Advent and Christmas wreaths are now a popular symbol in preparation for and to celebrate the coming of Christ, with the former being used to mark the beginning of the Christian Church&#x27;s liturgical year and both serving as décor during Advent and Christmas festivities. While Advent wreaths are erected on stands or placed on tables, Christmas wreaths are often hung on doors or walls. Within Advent, the Church observes Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day, the memorial of Saint Lucy, who is said to have brought &quot;food and aid to Christians hiding in the catacombs&quot; using a candle-lit wreath to &quot;light her way and leave her hands free to carry as much food as possible&quot;; as such, on this day, many young Christian girls dress as Saint Lucy, wearing a wreath on their head.

=== Decorative Wreaths ===
Decorative wreaths originated in Ancient Greece, they were used to promote healthy crop harvests, it would be made from the previous years harvest (such as wheat) and would be hung on people&#x27;s doors in hope for a fruitful harvest in the coming year.

In recent years, wreaths have experienced a significant surge in popularity as versatile home decor items. No longer confined to seasonal displays or special occasions, wreaths are now commonly used year-round to enhance interior and exterior spaces. From vibrant floral wreaths adorning front doors to minimalist greenery wreaths adorning walls, their versatility and customizable nature have captured the attention of interior designers and homeowners alike. The rise of do-it-yourself crafting and online marketplaces has also contributed to the accessibility of wreath-making materials and designs, allowing individuals to express their creativity and personalize their living spaces with these charming and visually appealing accents.

=== Corpus Christi wreaths ===
On the eve of the Feast of Corpus Christi, Christian clergy (chiefly those from the Roman Catholic, Lutheran, and Anglican traditions) bless Corpus Christi wreaths that are made of flowers. Wreaths and bouquets are often &quot;attached to flags and banners, to houses, and to the arches of green boughs that span the streets.&quot; In Christian homes, these wreaths are suspended on walls or displayed on doors and in windows. Corpus Christi wreaths are also &quot;put up in gardens, fields, and pastures, with a prayer for protection and blessing upon the growing harvest.&quot;

=== Funeral and memorial wreaths ===



The symbolism of wreaths has been used at funerals since at least the time of Ancient Greece, to represent a circle of eternal life. Evergreen wreaths were laid at the burial place of early Christian virgin martyrs in Europe, the evergreen representing the victory of the eternal spirit over death.

In early modern England, a wreath custom existed for the funerals of &quot;young maidens&quot;. A young woman of the same age as the one being mourned would lead the funeral procession, carrying a wreath of white flowers to represent the purity of the deceased, and &quot;that eternal crown of glory reserved for her in heaven&quot;.

By the Victorian era, the symbolism of flowers had grown to become an elaborate language, and the symbolism of funeral wreaths was no exception. Flowers represented life and resurrection. Specific flowers were used in funeral wreaths to represent particular sentiments. Cypress and willow were used for crafting wreath frames, and were associated with mourning by the Victorians.

Wreaths are commonly laid at the tombs of soldiers and at memorial cenotaphs during Memorial Day and Remembrance Day ceremonies. Wreaths may also be laid in memory of persons lost at sea, either from an accident or due to navy action. In a memorial service at sea, the wreath is lowered to the water and set adrift. Funeral wreaths were also commonly adorned with a &quot;wreath sash&quot;, a term coined in the World War II era, which was decorated with fringe and embroidered to commemorate life and sacrifice. This practice is still in place today, and wreath sashes now commonly adorn doors of homes to celebrate numerous holidays.

=== Harvest wreath ===

Harvest wreaths, a common household decoration today, are a custom with ancient roots in Europe. The creation of harvest wreaths in Europe can be traced back to ancient times, and is associated with animistic spiritual beliefs. In Ancient Greece, the harvest wreath was a sacred amulet, using wheat or other harvested plants, woven together with red and white wool thread. The harvest wreath would be hung by the door year-round.

Harvest wreaths were an important symbol to the community in Ancient Greece, not merely to the farmer and his family. The festivals devoted to Dionysus, the Oschophoria and Anthesteria, included a ritual procession called the &quot;eiresîonê&quot;. A harvest wreath was carried to Pyanopsia and Thargelia by young boys, who would sing during the journey. The laurel or olive wreath would be hung at the door, and then offerings were made to Helios and the Hours. It was hoped that this ritual would bring protection against crop failure and plagues.

In Poland, the harvest wreath (&quot;wieniec&quot;) is a central symbol of the Harvest Festival, &quot;Dozynki&quot;. Wreaths are made of different shapes and sizes, using harvested grain plants, fruit and nuts. The wreath is then brought to a church for a blessing by a priest. The tradition includes a procession to the family home from the church, with a girl or young woman leading the procession and carrying the wreath. The procession is followed with a celebration and feast.

== Wreaths worn as crowns ==

A wreath may be used as a headdress made from leaves, flowers and branches. It is typically worn in festive occasions and on holy days. Wreaths originally were made for use with pagan rituals in Europe, and were associated with the changing seasons and fertility. Christianity appropriated the symbolism of the wreath based upon its Roman association with honour and moral virtue. During the Middle Ages, Christian art featured depictions of the Virgin Mary and various saints crowned with wreaths, much as figures from Roman and Greek mythology were depicted wearing wreaths, as well as Roman and Greek rulers and heroes.

=== Maypole wreath ===

Wreath customs in Europe have survived over many centuries. The observance of May Day in England includes Maypole festivities, culminating in a race by young unmarried men to climb to the top of the Maypole to capture the May Day wreath perched at the top of the pole. The winner of this contest would wear the wreath as his crown, and would be recognized as the May Day King for the rest of the holiday. Plants traditionally used to make Midsummer wreaths and garlands include white lilies, green birch, fennel, St. John&#x27;s Wort, wormwood, vervain and flax. The flowers used in making the Midsummer wreath had to be picked early in the morning before the dew had dried; the belief was that once the dew dried, the magical properties of the plants evaporated with the dew.

Midsummer celebrations are still observed in Germany and Scandinavia as well, with Maypoles and wreaths playing a prominent role, similar to England.

=== Wreath symbolism in England ===

By the Renaissance period, wreaths became symbols of political and religious alliances in England. Protestant reformers such as the Puritans saw wreaths and the holidays they were associated with, such as May Day, as being pagan corrupting influences that destroyed healthy Christian morality. Soldiers confiscated wreaths in Oxford on May Day of 1648. During the Interregnum following the overthrow of Charles I of England, wreaths symbolized Royalist sympathies. In Bath, Somerset, the coronation of Charles II of England was marked with a procession of 400 maidens in white and green, carrying &quot;gilded crowns, crowns made of flowers, and wreaths made of laurel mixed with tulips&quot;, and led by the mayor&#x27;s wife.

=== Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day crown ===

Saint Lucy is traditionally depicted in Christian artwork wearing a wreath as a crown, and on the wreath stand lit candles symbolizing the light of the world represented by Christ. Sweden in particular has a long history of observing Saint Lucy&#x27;s Day (St. Lucia&#x27;s Day). &quot;St. Lucia&#x27;s crowns&quot;, made of a brass wreath holding candles, are part of the customs associated with this holiday.

==Wreath laying ceremonies==
A wreath laying ceremony is a traditional practice during which funeral wreaths are laid at a grave or memorial site. It is done as a formal sign of respect towards a particular tribute (e.g. Tomb of the Unknown Soldier). These are formal ceremonies that involve high ranking dignitaries such as heads of state. Once a wreath is laid, the person who lays the wreath goes a few steps back to bow/salute the memorial. During wreath laying ceremonies of a military nature, bugle calls such as &quot;Last Post&quot;, &quot;Taps&quot;, or &quot;Sunset&quot; are played.

In the Netherlands, wreath laying () is usually held during the National Remembrance Day celebrations on 4 May. During state visits, a wreath is laid out at the National Monument in Amsterdam.

In Russia, it is tradition to lay wreaths at war memorials on Days of Military Honour and commemorative military holidays, such as Defender of the Fatherland Day and Victory Day. One of the more notable laying of wreaths takes place at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier in Moscow&#x27;s Alexander Garden, where the President of Russia, the Prime Minister of Russia, members of the Federal Assembly, military officers, religious leaders in the Russian Orthodox Church and other dignitaries are led to lay a funeral wreath close to the eternal flame. A moment of silence is then conducted, which is usually followed by a solemn march of an honour guard passes.

In the United Kingdom, wreaths, are most notably laid at the Cenotaph during the National Service of Remembrance on Remembrance Day.

<text>Tuition payments, usually known as tuition in American English and as tuition fees in Commonwealth English, are fees charged by education institutions for instruction or other services. Besides public spending (by governments and other public bodies), private spending via tuition payments are the largest revenue sources for education institutions in some countries. In most developed countries, especially countries in Scandinavia and Continental Europe, there are no or only nominal tuition fees for all forms of education, including university and other higher education.

== Payment methods ==
Some of the methods used to pay for tuition include:
* Scholarship
* Bursary
* Company sponsorship or funding
* Grant
* Government student loan
* Educational 7 (private) 

* Family (parental) money
* Savings

== By location ==
A number of countries, such as South Africa, the United States and the United Kingdom, have &quot;up-front tuition policies.&quot;&lt;ref name=&quot;Marcucci/Johnstone&quot;&gt;Marcucci, Pamela N. and D. Bruce Johnstone, &quot;Tuition Fee Policies in a Comparative Perspective: Theoretical and Political Rationales&quot;, &quot;Journal of Higher Education Policy and Management&quot;, Volume 29, Number 1 (2007), pp. 25-40. (Taylor &amp; Francis Online, retrieved 13 March 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; These policies generally include a tuition fee that is large enough to give parents or guardians &quot;a responsibility to cover some portion of their children’s higher education costs.&quot; This responsibility can make it difficult for a low-income student to attend college without requiring a grant or one or more loans.

College tuition in the United States is one of the costs of a post-secondary education. The total cost of college is called the cost of attendance (or, informally, the &quot;sticker price&quot;) and, in addition to tuition, can include room and board and fees for facilities such as books, transportation, or commuting provided by the college.

In Europe the first cycle is free in several countries: Austria, Cyprus, Czech Republic, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Germany, Greece, Malta, Montenegro, Norway, Poland, Scotland, Slovakia, Slovenia, Sweden, Turkey.

In Hungary the annual tuition at a public university may exceed 15,000 euros. Only 32 percent of the students pay tuition that averages 1,428 euros for a year at a 1st-degree level and 1,552 for a year at the 2nd-degree level. A student in Hungary has an opportunity to receive a scholarship of up to 3,000 euros for living expenses and nearly 4,000 euros for good grades.

In Lithuania the highest tuition is nearly 12,000 euros and 37 percent of the students pay.

Tuition fees in the United Kingdom were introduced in 1998, with a maximum permitted fee of £1,000. Since then, this maximum has been raised to £9,000 (more than €10,000) in most of the United Kingdom, however, only those who reach a certain salary threshold pay this fee through general taxation. The UK state pays for the poorest or low income to access a university, thus university attendance remains high. There are record levels of disadvantaged people accessing a university. Scotland and Wales have abolished tuition. There are no scholarships and the only assistance is a possible loan from the government.

French tuition fees are capped based on the level of education pursued, from 183 Euros per year for undergraduate up to 388 for doctorates. Some public universities have autonomous status, meaning that they can charge much higher tuition, and all private universities charge tuition.

In the German education system almost all universities and most universities of applied sciences are funded by the state and do not charge tuition fees. In exceptional cases universities may offer courses for professionals (e.g. executive MBA programs), which may require tuition payment. Some local governments have recently decided that students from non-EU countries can be charged, although ERASMUS students, students from developing countries and other special groups are exempt. In addition, some private institutions of higher education run on a tuition-based model.

All Nordic countries provide higher education free of charge to their own citizens. The Nordic education systems are almost entirely publicly funded. In Nordic countries education is seen as a civil right and a public service rather than a commodity. The issue of education is seen in these countries as an issue of equality. This is in part because high levels of education are a benefit to the development of society, including business and industry.

In Greece there are no tuition fees as Bachelor-level higher education and some Master-level post-graduate education is provided for free to all Hellene (Greek) citizens as a benefit of citizenship paid by taxes. Universities accept students who have excelled at high school, with the selection being done through the Panhellenic Examinations, a system of state-administered examinations. Furthermore, it is difficult for mature students to be accepted at universities. Doctorate-level higher education is often also provided for free, but some universities may charge fees for PhD degrees. Students may resort to registering at private universities (called colleges, κολέγια), which charge tuition fees, or emigrate to other countries in order to get an education.

In Spain, public universities fees are established annually by laws enacted by the governments of each autonomous community, following a series of basic criteria dictated by the central government and published in the Official State Gazette.

== By institution ==

Tuition is charged at different rates from one type of institution to the next. Net tuition indices mark an increase in the &quot;relative real burden&quot; for payments at various types of institutions for higher education; in the period between 1980 and 1995; example, this burden increased by approximately 80 percent for students at public universities and by 148 percent for students at private universities. More than half of public research universities charge students differential tuition based primarily on their major and their year in college, increasing normal tuition by up to 40 percent. 

Most students or their families who pay for tuition and other education costs do not have enough savings to pay in full while they are in school. Some students must work or borrow money to afford an education. In the United States, student financial aid is available to defray the cost of a post-secondary education: &quot;Financial aid is typically thought to exert the most influence in [attendance], when admitted students consider whether to enroll in a particular institution.&quot; It is often the case that the lower the cost of the school, the more likely a student is to attend.

Developed countries have adopted a dual scheme for education; while basic (i.e. high-school) education is supported by taxes rather than tuition, higher education usually requires tuition payments or fees.

People may purchase tuition insurance to protect themselves from fees related to involuntary withdrawal (illness, death of a parent or guardian, etc.)

== History ==
In medieval Europe, universities were mainly institutions of the Catholic Church. As they mainly trained clergy, most of these universities did not have any need to exact fees from the students with one notable exception: during the 12th century, while under the supervision of Pierre le Mangeur, the University of Paris began collecting two sous weekly in tuition. 

Later, the main duty of universities in most Protestant countries was the training of future civil servants. Again, it was not in the interest of the state to charge tuition fees, as this would have decreased the quality of civil servants. On the other hand, the number of students from the lower classes was usually kept in check by the expenses of living during the years of study, although as early as the mid-19th century there were calls for limiting the university entrance by middle-class persons. A typical family, however, could not afford educating a child or young adult, even if the education itself was free. A similar situation exists today in many Third World countries, where the expenses of &quot;free&quot; schooling (food, books, school uniform, etc.) prevent some children from attending any school.

After World War II the tuition systems of all of today&#x27;s advanced democracies still were highly similar: Education institutions in all countries charged no or only very low tuition fees. It was not before the 1950s that the countries&#x27; education systems developed in different directions. Some countries, especially Anglophone countries (for example the United States) but also Asian countries such as Japan, introduced considerable tuition payments already in the early post-war period. Other countries, particularly in Scandinavia and continental Europe, in contrast remained tuition-free. These developments were unrelated to the massive educational expansion that took place at the same time.

Since the early 1970s, the average cost of tuition has steadily outpaced the growth of the average American household. This trend continued particularly under President Reagan&#x27;s higher education policies in the 1980s. Likewise, there has been a steady decrease in federal funding for grants and a rise in the interest rates of most major student loans, leaving many students struggling to pay debt for years after graduation.

===College tuition for undocumented students===
The Development, Relief, and Education for Alien Minors (DREAM) Act was introduced in the U.S. Senate. It would allow the estimated 50,000 to 65,000 undocumented students in the United States to gain in-state tuition as well as a path towards American citizenship. The Act would apply only to those students with tangible proof of residence in the United States before the age of 18. This Act has stirred debate in numerous groups, including institutions, families, and the Senate itself.

As of March 2013, undocumented students in most States were required to pay the higher out-of-state students&#x27; tuition charged at public universities, often between $20,000 and $35,000 at a local public university. In addition, these students were denied federal assistance as they lacked valid Social Security numbers. Because such students often come from comparatively poor families, the costs are too high to allow many undocumented students to seek university education in the United States.

<doc id="249321" wikidata="Q1140396" url="?curid=249321" title="Koshchei">
<text>Koshchei (), also Kashchei (), often given the epithet &quot;the Immortal&quot;, or &quot;the Deathless&quot; (), is an archetypal male antagonist in Russian folklore.

The most common feature of tales involving Koschei is a spell which prevents him from being killed. He hides &quot;his death&quot; inside nested objects to protect it. For example, his death may be hidden in a needle that is hidden inside an egg, the egg is in a duck, the duck is in a hare, the hare is in a chest, the chest is buried or chained up on a faraway island of Buyan. Usually he takes the role of a malevolent rival figure, who competes for (or entraps) a male hero&#x27;s love interest.

The origin of the tales is unknown. The archetype may contain elements derived from the 12th-century pagan Cuman-Kipchak (Polovtsian) leader Khan Konchak, who is recorded in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot;; over time a balanced view of the non-Christian Cuman Khan may have been distorted or caricatured by Christian Slavic writers.

==Historicity and folk origins==
By at least the 18th century, and likely earlier, Koschei&#x27;s legend had been appearing in Slavic tales. For a long period, no connection was made with any historical character.

===Origin in Khan Konchak===
The origin of the tale may be related to the Polovtsian (Cuman) leader Khan Konchak, who dates from the 12th century. In &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; Konchak is referred to as a koshey (slave). Konchak is thought to have come/returned from Georgia (the Caucasus) to the steppe c. 1126–1130; by c.1172 he is described in Kievan Rus&#x27; chronicles as a leader of the Polovtsi, and as taking part in an uprising. There is not enough information to reconstruct further details of Konchak&#x27;s appearance or nature from historical sources; though unusual features or abnormalities were usually recorded (often as epithets) by chroniclers, none are recorded for Konchak.

The legendary love of gold of Koschei is speculated to be a distorted record of Konchak&#x27;s role as the keeper of the Kosh&#x27;s resources.

Koschei&#x27;s epithet &quot;the immortal&quot; may be a reference to Konchak&#x27;s longevity. He is last recorded in Russian chronicles during the 1203 capture of Kiev, if the record is correct this gives Konchak an unusually long life – possibly over 100 years – for the time this would have been over six generations.

Koschei&#x27;s life-protecting spell may be derived from traditional Turkic amulets, which were egg-shaped and often contained arrowheads (cf. the needle in Koschei&#x27;s egg).

It is thought that many of the negative aspects of Koschei&#x27;s character are distortions of a more nuanced relationship of Khan Konchak with the Christian Slavs, such as his rescuing of Prince Igor from captivity, or the marriage between Igor&#x27;s son and Konchak&#x27;s daughter. Konchak, as a pagan, could have been demonised over time as a stereotypical villain.

===Naming and etymology===
In the &quot;Explanatory Dictionary of the Living Great Russian Language&quot; of Vladimir Dahl, the name &quot;Kashchei&quot; is derived from the verb &quot;kastit&quot; – to harm, to dirty: &quot;probably from the word &quot;kastit&quot;, but remade into koshchei, from &#x27;bone&#x27;, meaning a man exhausted by excessive thinness&quot;. (&quot;Bone&quot; here is in Russian .) Vasmer notes that the word &quot;koshchei&quot; has two meanings that have different etymologies: &quot;thin, skinny person, walking skeleton&quot; or &quot;miser&quot; – the origin of the word &quot;bone&quot;). Old Russian &quot;youth, boy, captive, slave&quot; from the Turkic &quot;košči&quot; &quot;slave&quot;, in turn from &quot;koš&quot; &quot;camp&quot;.

Koschei, as the name of the hero of a fairy tale and as a designation for a skinny person, Max Vasmer in his dictionary considers the original Slavic word (homonym) and associates with the word bone (common Slavic *&quot;kostь&quot;), that is, it is an adjective form &quot;koštіі&quot; (nominative adjective in the nominative case singular), declining according to the type &quot;God&quot;.

Numerous variant names and spellings have been given to Koschei; these include &quot;Kashchei&quot;, &quot;Koshchai&quot;, &quot;Kashshei&quot;, &quot;Kovshei&quot;, &quot;Kosh&quot;, &quot;Kashch&quot;, &quot;Kashel&quot;, &quot;Kostei&quot;, &quot;Kostsei&quot;, &quot;Kashshui&quot;, &quot;Kozel&quot;, &quot;Koz&#x27;olok&quot;, &quot;Korachun&quot;, &quot;Korchun bessmertnyi&quot;, &quot;Kot bezsmertnyi&quot;, &quot;Kot Bezmertnyi&quot;, &quot;Kostii bezdushnyi&quot;; in bylinas he also appears as &quot;Koshcheiushko&quot;, &quot;Koshcheg&quot;, &quot;Koshcherishcho&quot;, &quot;Koshchui&quot;, &quot;Koshel&quot;. 

The term &quot;Koshey&quot; appears in Slavic chronicles as early as the 12th century to refer to an officer or official during a military campaign. Similar terms include the Ukrainian (Koshovyi) for the head of the &#x27;Kish&#x27; (military) (see also Kish otaman). In Old Russian &#x27;Kosh&#x27; means a camp, while in Belarusian a similar term means &#x27;to camp&#x27; and in Turkic languages a similar term means &#x27;a wanderer&#x27;. The use as a personal name is recorded as early as the 15th century on Novogrodian birch bark manuscripts.

In &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; a similar sounding term is used, recorded being inscribed on coins, deriving from the Turkic for &#x27;captive&#x27; or &#x27;slave&#x27;. The same term also appears in the Ipatiev Chronicle, meaning &#x27;captive&#x27;. A second mention of the term is made in &quot;The Tale of Igor&#x27;s Campaign&quot; when Igor is captured by the Polovtsi; this event is recorded as a riddle: &quot;And here Prince Igor exchanged his golden saddle of a prince for the saddle of a Koshey (slave).&quot;

Nikolai Novikov also suggested the etymological origin of &quot;koshchii&quot; meaning &quot;youth&quot; or &quot;boy&quot; or &quot;captive&quot;, &quot;slave&quot;, or &quot;servant&quot;. The interpretation of &quot;captive&quot; is interesting because Koschei appears initially as a captive in some tales.

==In folk tales==
Koschei is a common villain in east-Slavic folk tales. Often tales involving him are of the type AT 302 &quot;The Giant Without A Heart&quot; (see Aarne–Thompson classification systems). He also appears in tales resembling type AT 313 &quot;The Magic Flight&quot;.

He usually functions as the antagonist or rival to a hero. Common themes are love and rivalry.

The typical feature in tales about Koschei is his protection against death (AT 302). To kill him you must find his death which is hidden inside an egg. The egg is hidden inside various animals, and which are then protected by containers or in remote places.

In other tales, Koschei can cast a sleep spell that can be broken by playing an enchanted gusli. Depending on the tale he has different characteristics: he may ride a three- or seven-legged horse; may have tusks or fangs; and may possess a variety of different magic objects (like cloaks and rings) that a hero is sent to obtain; or he may have other magic powers. In one tale he has eyelids so heavy he requires servants to lift them (cf. the Celtic Balor or Ysbaddaden, or Serbian Vy).

The parallel female figure, Baba Yaga, as a rule does not appear in the same tale with Koschei, though exceptions exists where both appear together as a married couple, or as siblings. Sometimes, Baba Yaga appears in tales along with Koschei as an old woman figure, such as his mother or aunt.

===&quot;Marya Morevna&quot;===
In the tale, also known as &quot;The Death of Koschei the Deathless&quot;, Ivan Tsarevitch encounters Koschei chained in the dungeon of Marya Morevna (Ivan&#x27;s wife). He releases and revives Koschei, but Koschei abducts Marya. Ivan tries to rescue Marya several times, but Koschei&#x27;s horse is too fast and he easily catches up with the escaping lovers. Each time Koschei&#x27;s magical horse informs him that he could carry out several activities first and still catch up. After the third unsuccessful escape, Koschei cuts up Ivan and puts his body parts in a barrel which he throws into the sea. However, water of life revives Ivan. He then seeks out Baba Yaga to ask her for a horse swifter than Koshei&#x27;s. After undergoing several trials he steals a horse and finally successfully rescues Marya.

===&quot;Tsarevich Petr and the Wizard&quot;===
Tsar Bel-Belianin&#x27;s wife the Tzaritza is abducted by Koschei (the wizard). The Tsar&#x27;s three sons attempt to rescue her. The first two fail to reach the wizard&#x27;s palace, but the third, Petr, succeeds. He reaches the Tzaritza, conceals himself, and learns how the wizard hides his life. Initially he lies, but the third time he reveals it is in an egg, in a duck, in a hare, that nests in a hollow log, that floats in a pond, found in a forest on the island of Bouyan. Petr seeks the egg, freeing animals along the way – on coming to Bouyan the freed animals help him catch the wizard&#x27;s creatures and obtain the egg. He returns to the wizard&#x27;s domain and kills him by squeezing the egg – every action on the egg is mirrored on the wizard&#x27;s body.

===&quot;The Snake Princess&quot;===
In &quot;The Snake Princess&quot; (Russian ), Koschei turns a princess who does not want to marry him into a snake.

===Ivan Sosnovich===
Koschei hears of three beauties in a kingdom. He kills two and wounds a third, puts the kingdom to sleep (petrifies), and abducts the princesses. Ivan Sosnovich (Russian &quot;Иван Соснович&quot;) learns of Koschei&#x27;s weakness: an egg in a box hidden under a mountain, so he digs up the whole mountain, finds the egg box and smashes it, and rescues the princess.

==Similar folklore figures==
The Serbian Baš Čelik (Head of Steel); Hungarian &#x27;Lead-Headed Monk&#x27;; and Slovak &#x27;Iron Monk&#x27; also all hide their weakness inside a nested series of animals.

==In works of fiction==
Koshchei is mentioned as a miser in the prologue Pushkin&#x27;s Ruslan and Ludmila which describes wonders of the fairy-tale land of Lukomorye: &quot;Там царь Кащей над златом чахнет&quot; (There tsar Kashchei is languishing over gold).

<doc id="249326" wikidata="Q1509725" url="?curid=249326" title="Mirepoix">
<text>A mirepoix ( , ) is a mixture of diced vegetables cooked with fat (usually butter) for a long time on low heat without coloring or browning. The ingredients are not sautéed or otherwise hard-cooked, because the intention is to sweeten rather than caramelize them. Mirepoix is a long-standing part of French cuisine and is the flavor base for a wide variety of dishes, including stocks, soups, stews, and sauces.

When the mirepoix is not precooked, the constituent vegetables may be cut to a larger size, depending on the overall cooking time for the dish. Usually the vegetable mixture is onions, carrots, and celery (either common &#x27;Pascal&#x27; celery or celeriac), with the traditional ratio being 2:1:1—two parts onion, one part carrot, and one part celery. Further cooking, with the addition of tomato purée, creates a darkened brown mixture called .

Similar flavor bases include the Italian soffritto, the Spanish and Portuguese / (braised onions, garlic and tomato), a variation with tomato paste instead of fresh tomato of the Eastern Mediterranean and Balkans region, the German (leeks, carrots and celeriac), the Polish (leeks, carrots, celeriac and parsley root), the Russian/Ukrainian or (onion, carrot and possibly celery, beets or pepper), the United States Cajun/Creole holy trinity (onions, celery and bell peppers), and possibly the French duxelles (mushrooms and often onion or shallot and herbs, reduced to a paste).

==History==
Although the cooking technique is probably older, the word mirepoix dates from the 18th century and derives, as do many other appellations in French cuisine, from the aristocratic employer of the cook credited with establishing and stabilizing it: in this case, Charles-Pierre-Gaston François de Lévis, duc de Lévis-Mirepoix (1699–1757), French field marshal and ambassador and a member of the noble family of Lévis, lords of Mirepoix in Languedoc (nowadays in the department of Ariège) since the 11th century. According to Pierre Larousse (quoted in &quot;The Oxford Companion to Food&quot;), the Duke of Mirepoix was &quot;an incompetent and mediocre individual ... who owed his vast fortune to the affection Louis XV felt toward his wife and who had but one claim to fame: he gave his name to a sauce made of all kinds of meat and a variety of seasonings&quot;.

The term is not encountered regularly in French culinary texts until the 19th century, so it is difficult to know what a dish was like in 18th century France. Antoine Beauvilliers, for instance, in 1814, gives a short recipe for a which is a buttery, wine-laced stock garnished with an aromatic mixture of carrots, onions, and a . Marie-Antoine Carême, in 1816, gives a similar recipe, calling it simply &quot;Mire-poix&quot;. By the mid-19th century, Jules Gouffé refers to mirepoix as &quot;a term in use for such a long time that I do not hesitate to use it here&quot;. His mirepoix is listed among essences and, indeed, is a meaty concoction (laced with two bottles of Madeira), which, like all other essences, was used to enrich many a classic sauce. By the end of the 19th century, the mirepoix had taken on its modern meaning. Joseph Favre, in his &quot;Dictionnaire universel de cuisine&quot; (, reprinted 1978), uses the term to describe a mixture of ham, carrots, onions, and herbs used as an aromatic condiment when making sauces or braising meat.
The is very similar to the mirepoix, except that the is designed to be brought to the table and eaten with the dish or alone as a side dish.

According to the 1938 &quot;Larousse Gastronomique&quot;, a mirepoix may be prepared (with meat) or (without meat). is sometimes called a (although strictly speaking this term more accurately merely designates the technique of dicing with a knife). A contains diced ham or pork belly as an additional ingredient. Similar combinations, both in and out of the French culinary repertoire, may include leeks, parsnips, garlic, tomatoes, shallots, mushrooms, bell peppers, chilies, and ginger, according to the requirements of the regional cuisine or the instructions of the particular chef or recipe. The analogous soffritto (frequently containing parsley) is the basis for many traditional dishes in classic Italian cuisine, and the serves a similar purpose in Spanish cuisines. In Cajun and Creole cuisine, a mirepoix or (jocularly so-called) &quot;holy trinity&quot; is a combination of onions, celery, and bell peppers.

Traditionally, the weight ratio for mirepoix is 2:1:1 of onions, celery, and carrots; the ratio for bones to mirepoix for stock is 10:1. When making a white stock, or , parsnips are used instead of carrots to maintain the pale color.

==International versions==
===German ===

 () means &#x27;soup greens&#x27; in German; the Dutch equivalent is . Soup greens usually come in a bundle and consists of a leek, a carrot, and a piece of celeriac. It may also contain parsley, thyme, celery leaves, rutabaga (swede), parsley root, and onions. The mix depends on regional traditions, as well as individual recipes. The vegetables used are cold-climate roots and bulbs with long shelf lives. act as herbs and impart hearty, strong flavors to the soup or sauce, providing a foil for other strong tasting ingredients such as dried peas and beans or pot roast. Large chunks of vegetables are slow cooked to make flavorful soups and stocks, and are discarded when the vegetables have given up most of their flavor. Finely chopped are browned in fat and used as a basis for a finished sauce. The vegetables may also be cooked long enough until they fall apart, and may become part of the sauce or pureed to form the sauce.

===Italian soffritto===

In Italian cuisine, onions, carrots and celery are chopped to form a , and then slowly cooked in butter or olive oil, becoming soffritto. It is used as the base for most pasta sauces, such as ragù (&quot;ragoût&quot;), but occasionally it can be used as the base of other dishes, such as sauteed vegetables. For this reason, it is a fundamental component in Italian cuisine. It may also contain garlic, shallot, or leek.

According to the Italian restaurateur Benedetta Vitali, soffritto means &#x27;underfried&#x27; and describes it as &quot;a preparation of lightly browned minced vegetables, not a dish by itself&quot;. At one time it was called &quot;false &quot;ragoût&quot;&quot;, because soffritto was thought to vaguely recall the flavor of meat sauce.

===Polish ===

 () is the Polish word for soup vegetables or greens. The word literally means &quot;Italian stuff&quot; because Queen Bona Sforza, who was Italian and married Polish King Sigismund I the Old in 1518, introduced this concept to Polish cuisine. A may consist of carrots, parsnips or parsley root, celery root or celeriac, leeks, and savoy or white cabbage leaves, and sometimes celery leaves and flat-leaf parsley. The most typical, packaged combination is celery root, parsley root, carrots, and leeks. is usually cut up to uniform size and boiled to form a flavor base for soups and stews.

<text>In Mesopotamian myths, the alal was a kind of demon that, to tempt men, came out of the Underworld and took various forms, temptations that the inhabitants of Babylonia were able to reject by means of amulets.

The Chaldean-Assyrian art represents these spirits in the form of horrible monsters, as in the bas-reliefs of the Palace of Ashurbanipal in Nineveh (now Iraq), today in the British Museum) and in small bronzes and clay tablets cooked in the shape of a cylinder, cone, or stamp.

Generally these demons are seen as theriocephalous, with a human body and the head of a lion with open jaws, the ears of a dog and mane of a horse. The feet are frequently replaced by bird claws of prey.

<text>Lawrence Eugene Doby (December 13, 1923 – June 18, 2003) was an American professional baseball player in the Negro leagues and Major League Baseball (MLB) who was the second black player to break baseball&#x27;s color barrier and the first black player in the American League. A native of Camden, South Carolina, and three-sport all-state athlete while in high school in Paterson, New Jersey, Doby accepted a basketball scholarship from Long Island University. At 17 years of age, he began his professional baseball career with the Newark Eagles as the team&#x27;s second baseman. Doby joined the United States Navy during World War II. His military service complete, Doby returned to baseball in 1946, and along with teammate Monte Irvin, helped the Eagles win the Negro League World Series.

In July 1947, three months after Jackie Robinson made history with the Brooklyn Dodgers, Doby broke the color barrier in the American League when he signed a contract to play with Bill Veeck&#x27;s Cleveland Indians. Doby was the first player to go directly to the majors from the Negro leagues. A seven-time All-Star center fielder, Doby and teammate Satchel Paige were the first African-American players to win a World Series championship when the Indians took the crown in 1948. He helped the Indians win 111 games (second-best in MLB history at the time) and the AL pennant in 1954, finished second in the American League Most Valuable Player (MVP) award voting and was the AL&#x27;s RBI leader and home run champion. He went on to play for the Chicago White Sox, Detroit Tigers, and Chunichi Dragons before his retirement as a player in 1962.

Doby later served as the second black manager in the majors with the Chicago White Sox, and in 1995 was appointed to a position in the AL&#x27;s executive office. He also served as a director with the New Jersey Nets of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 1998 by the Hall&#x27;s Veterans Committee and died in 2003 at the age of 79.

==Early life==
Doby was born in Camden, South Carolina, to David Doby and Etta Brooks on December 13, 1923. Doby&#x27;s father served in World War I. David worked as a horse groomer and played semi-professional baseball, but drowned in an accident at age 37 in New York state. Doby&#x27;s mother, who had divorced David before his death, moved to Paterson, New Jersey; Doby remained in Camden. He lived with his grandmother before moving to live with his father&#x27;s sister and brother-in-law from 1934 to 1938. He attended Jackson School, which was segregated under South Carolina state law. His first opportunity to play organized baseball came as a student at Boylan-Haven-Mather Academy, a private school affiliated with the Methodist church. Richard Dubose, who had managed Doby&#x27;s father and was known locally in African-American circles for his baseball expertise, gave Doby some of his first baseball lessons. Reflecting on his years growing up in South Carolina, including how he and playmates used worn down broom handles for bats, Doby said, &quot;Growing up in Camden, we didn&#x27;t have baseball bats. We&#x27;d use a tree here, a tin can there, for bases.&quot;

After completing eighth grade, Doby moved north to Paterson at the age of 14 to be reunited with his mother; she visited him weekly while he lived with one of her friends. At Paterson Eastside High School, Doby was a multi-sport athlete; as well as playing baseball and basketball, he was a wide receiver in football and lettered in track. After winning a state football championship, the Eastside team was invited to play in Florida, but the promoters would not allow Doby, the only black player on the team, to participate. Consequently, the team voted to forgo the trip as a gesture of support for Doby.

During summer vacation Doby played baseball with a black semi-pro team, the Smart Sets, where he played with future Hall of Fame shortstop Monte Irvin. He also had a brief stint with the Harlem Renaissance, a professional basketball team, as an unpaid substitute player. Upon completing high school, he accepted an athletic scholarship to play basketball at Long Island University Brooklyn (LIU). Doby had been dating Eastside classmate Helyn Curvy since his sophomore year and, according to Doby, being able to remain close to Paterson was the &quot;main reason&quot; he selected LIU.

In the summer before he enrolled at LIU, Doby accepted an offer to play for the Newark Eagles of the Negro National League (NNL) for the remainder of the 1942 season, and he transferred to Virginia Union University as a result.

==Negro leagues and World War II==
Negro league umpire Henry Moore advised Newark Eagles&#x27; owners Abe and Effa Manley to give Doby a tryout at Hinchliffe Stadium in Paterson, which was successful; Doby joined the Eagles in 1942 at the age of 17 for $300. The contract stated Doby would play until September when he would start classes at college; to protect his amateur status he signed using the alias &quot;Larry Walker&quot; and local reporters were told he originated from Los Angeles, California. On May 31, Doby appeared in his first professional game when the Eagles played against the New York Cubans at Yankee Stadium. In the 26 games where box scores have been found, Doby&#x27;s batting average was .391. Doby recalled a game against catcher Josh Gibson and pitcher Ray Brown of the Homestead Grays:

My first time up, Josh said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to find out if you can hit a fastball.&#x27; I singled. Next time up, Josh said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to find out if you can hit a curveball.&#x27; I singled. Third time up, Josh said, &#x27;We&#x27;re going to find out how you do after you&#x27;re knocked down.&#x27; I popped up the first time after they knocked me down. The second time, I singled.

Doby&#x27;s career in Newark was interrupted for two years for service in the United States Navy. Doby spent 1943 and part of 1944 at Camp Robert Smalls at the Great Lakes Naval Training School near Chicago. He appeared on an all-black baseball squad and maintained a .342 batting average against teams composed of white players, some of which featured major leaguers. He then went to Treasure Island Naval Base in San Francisco Bay, California. Before serving in the Pacific Theater of World War II, Doby spent time at Navy sites in Ogden, Utah and San Diego, California. He was stationed on Ulithi in the Pacific Ocean in 1945. Doby heard of Jackie Robinson&#x27;s minor league contract deal with the Montreal Royals of the International League from his base on Ulithi listening to Armed Forces Radio, and as a result Doby saw real hope in becoming a Major League baseball player. While in Hawaii, Doby met fellow Navy man and future teammate Mickey Vernon. Vernon, then with the Washington Senators, was so impressed with Doby&#x27;s skills he wrote to Senators owner Clark Griffith, encouraging Griffith to sign Doby should MLB ever allow integration. During his time in the Navy, Doby was described by his colleagues as quiet. Doby was discharged from the Navy in January 1946. In the summer of that year, Doby and Helyn Curvy were married.

After playing for the San Juan Senators in Puerto Rico, Doby rejoined the Eagles in 1946. He made the All-Star roster, batted .360 (fourth in the NNL), hit five home runs (fifth) and led the NNL in triples (six). Manager Biz Mackey led the Eagles, including Doby, Monte Irvin and Johnny Davis, to the Negro World Series championship over Satchel Paige and the Kansas City Monarchs in seven games to conclude the 1946 season. For the Series, Doby hit .372 with one home run, five RBIs, and three stolen bases. Many in the Negro leagues believed Doby or Irvin would be first to break the MLB color barrier, not Robinson. On considering a career in Major League Baseball, Doby said, &quot;I never dreamed that far ahead. Growing up in a segregated society, you couldn&#x27;t have thought that that was the way it was going to be. There was no bright spot as far as looking at baseball until Mr. Robinson got the opportunity to play in Montreal in &#x27;46.&quot;

==Major League Baseball career==

===Integration of American League (1947)===
Cleveland Indians owner and team president Bill Veeck proposed integrating baseball in 1942, which had been informally segregated since the turn of the century, but this was rejected by Commissioner Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Veeck had begun the process of finding a young, talented player from the Negro leagues, and told a reporter in Cleveland that he would integrate the Indians&#x27; roster if he could find a black player with the necessary talent level who could withstand the taunts and pressure of being the first black athlete in the AL. The reporter suggested Doby, whom Veeck had seen at the Great Lakes Naval Training School. Doby&#x27;s name was also mentioned when Veeck talked with reporters who covered the Negro leagues. Indians scout Bill Killefer rated Doby favorably and perhaps just as important for Veeck, reported Doby&#x27;s off-field behavior was not a concern. The Dodgers rated Doby their top young Negro league prospect. But unlike the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; Branch Rickey, who signed Robinson one full season before bringing him to the National League, Veeck used a different strategy, letting Doby remain with the Eagles instead of bringing him through the Indians&#x27; farm system. He told the &quot;Pittsburgh Courier&quot;, &quot;One afternoon when the team trots out on the field, a Negro player will be out there with it.&quot;

While Rickey declined to pay for the purchasing rights of Robinson while he played for the Kansas City Monarchs, Veeck was &quot;determined to buy Doby&#x27;s contract from the Eagles&quot; and had no problem paying purchasing rights. Effa Manley, business manager for the Eagles, believed her club&#x27;s close relationship with the New York Yankees might put Doby in a Yankees uniform, but they did not take interest in him. Veeck finalized a contract deal for Doby with Manley on July 3. Veeck paid her a total of $15,000 for her second baseman—$10,000 for taking him from the Eagles and another $5,000 once it was determined he would stay with the Indians for at least 30 days. After Manley agreed to Veeck&#x27;s offer, she stated to him, &quot;If Larry Doby were white and a free agent, you&#x27;d give him $100,000 to sign as a bonus.&quot; The press were not told that Doby had been signed by the Indians as Veeck wanted to manage how fans in Cleveland would be introduced to Doby. &quot;I moved slowly and carefully, perhaps even timidly&quot;, Veeck said. The Eagles had a doubleheader on July 4 but Doby, who had a .415 batting average and 14 home runs to that point in the season, only played in the first as Veeck sent his assistant and public relations personnel member, Louis Jones, for Doby. The two took a train from Newark to Chicago where the Indians were scheduled to play the Chicago White Sox the next day.

On July 5, with the Indians in Chicago in the midst of a road trip, Doby made his debut as the second black baseball player after Robinson to play in the majors after establishment of the baseball color line. Veeck hired two plainclothes police officers to accompany Doby as he went to Comiskey Park. Player-manager Lou Boudreau initially had a hard time finding a place in the lineup for Doby, who had played second base and shortstop for most of his career. Boudreau himself was the regular shortstop, while Joe Gordon was the second baseman. That day, Doby met his new teammates for the first time. &quot;I walked down that line, stuck out my hand, and very few hands came back in return. Most of the ones that did were cold-fish handshakes, along with a look that said, &#x27;You don&#x27;t belong here&quot;, Doby reminisced years later. Four of Doby&#x27;s teammates did not shake his hand, and of those, two turned their backs to Doby when he tried to introduce himself. During warm-ups, Doby languished for minutes while his teammates interacted with one another. Not until Joe Gordon asked Doby to play catch with him was Doby given the chance to engage. Gordon befriended Doby and became one of his closest friends on the team.

Doby entered the game in the seventh inning as a pinch-hitter for relief pitcher Bryan Stephens and recorded a strikeout. In the 1949 movie &quot;The Kid from Cleveland&quot;, Veeck tells the story that Gordon struck out on three swings in his immediate at-bat after Doby to save face for his new teammate. However, Doby&#x27;s second strike was the result of a foul ball, both the Associated Press and &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; stated Doby struck out on five pitches instead of three, and in addition, Gordon was standing on third base during Doby&#x27;s at-bat. From &quot;Pride and Prejudice: The Biography of Larry Doby&quot;:

After the game, Doby quickly showered and dressed without incident in the Cleveland clubhouse. His escort, Louis Jones, then took him not to the Del Prado Hotel downtown, where the Indians players stayed, but to the black DuSable Hotel in Chicago&#x27;s predominantly black South Side, near Comiskey Park. The segregated arrangement established a pattern, on Doby&#x27;s first day, that he would be compelled to follow, in spring training and during the regular season, in many cities, throughout his playing career.

The Indians had a doubleheader against the White Sox on Sunday, July 6, for which 31,566 were in attendance; it was estimated that approximately 30 percent of the crowd were black. Some congregations of black churches let out early while others walked immediately from Sunday service to Comiskey Park. Boudreau had Doby pinch-hit in the first game but for the second, listed him a starter at first base, a position Doby was not expected to fill when the Indians brought him up to play at second base. Doby had played the position before with the Eagles but was without a proper mitt for first base and met much resistance when attempts were made to borrow one from teammates, including first baseman Eddie Robinson, whom Boudreau had asked Doby to replace that day. Doby said only because Gordon asked in the clubhouse to borrow one of the first baseman&#x27;s mitts did he have one to use in the second game of the doubleheader as earlier direct requests from Doby were rejected. The mitt was loaned by a White Sox player. Boudreau recounts an incident where Robinson refused the mitt to Doby, but when asked by Indians traveling secretary Spud Goldstein, Robinson obliged. It was the only game Doby started for the remainder of the season. Doby recorded his first major league hit in four at-bats and had an RBI in a 5–1 Indians win.

A columnist wrote in the &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; on July 8: &quot;Cleveland&#x27;s man in the street is the right sort of American, as was evidenced right solidly once more by the response to the question: &#x27;How does the signing of Larry Doby by the Indians strike you? Said the man in the street: Can he hit? ... That&#x27;s all that counts.&quot; Conversely, Doby was criticized from players both active and retired. Noted former player Rogers Hornsby said, after watching Doby play one time in 1947:

Bill Veeck did the Negro race no favor when he signed Larry Doby to a Cleveland contract. If Veeck wanted to demonstrate that the Negro has no place in major league baseball, he could have used no subtler means to establish the point. If he were white he wouldn&#x27;t be considered good enough to play with a semi-pro club. He is fast on his feet but that lets him out. He hasn&#x27;t any other quality that could possibly recommend him.

In his rookie year, Doby hit .156 (5-for-32) in 29 games. He played four games at second base and one each at first base and shortstop. Throughout the season, he talked with Jackie Robinson via telephone, the two encouraging each other. &quot;And Jackie and I agreed we shouldn&#x27;t challenge anybody or cause trouble—or we&#x27;d both be out of the big leagues, just like that. We figured that if we spoke out, we would ruin things for other black players.&quot; After his rookie season, Doby again pursued time on the basketball court and appeared with the Paterson Crescents of the American Basketball League after signing a contract in January 1948. He was the first black player to join the league.

===Cleveland Indians===

====1948–1950====
In 1948, Doby experienced his first spring training with the Indians in Tucson, Arizona. Unlike their white teammates, Doby, along with Satchel Paige and Minnie Miñoso, were not permitted to stay at the nearby Santa Rita hotel but instead stayed with a local black family and used a rental car provided by the Indians for transportation. During spring training, Doby read books concerning outfield play, and received instruction and encouragement from former Indians manager Tris Speaker and Indians&#x27; farm system director Hank Greenberg. Doby also credited Indians coach Bill McKechnie with helping him adjust to the majors and learning the outfield. In an exhibition game in Houston against the New York Giants, Doby hit a home run that &quot;may have traveled 500 feet before landing far beyond the fence in center field.&quot; As Moore wrote in his biography of Doby, &quot;With that home run, all doubts that Doby would make the 1948 Cleveland team vanished. That year, he played in 121 games and hit .301 for the season with 14 home runs and 66 RBIs. Throughout the regular season Doby was racially abused by opposing teams, and Veeck asked AL president Will Harridge for support in getting players to rein in their animosity towards Doby.

Doby played a major role in Cleveland&#x27;s World Series victory against the Boston Braves. In Game 4 on October 9, Doby hit the first home run by a black player in World Series history. A picture featuring an embrace between Doby and white teammate Steve Gromek, who had pitched a complete game that day, was on the cover of the next day&#x27;s &quot;Plain Dealer&quot;. Richard Goldstein of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the photograph &quot;a signature moment in the integration of Major League Baseball.&quot; Of the picture, Doby said, &quot;The picture was more rewarding and happy for me than actually hitting the home run. The picture finally showed a moment of a man showing his feelings for me.&quot; The Indians defeated the Braves in six games and with it, Cleveland had its first World Series championship since the 1920 season. Doby&#x27;s .318 batting average during the Series led the Indians. Nationally syndicated columnist Grantland Rice argued that without Doby and Gene Bearden, who had won 20 games that year, the Indians would have finished in fourth or fifth place. After the Series, Doby received a celebratory parade in Paterson, New Jersey, and during the offseason he, along with other teammates, appeared in the 1949 film &quot;The Kid From Cleveland&quot;. With additional income available due to the post-season run and Series championship, Doby and his wife attempted to buy a home in Paterson in an all-white neighborhood but were kept out by a petition from members of the community. The Dobys were allowed to purchase their desired home when the Paterson city mayor intervened on their behalf.
During the 1949 season, Doby was selected to his first MLB All-Star Game. He was one of five Indians selected by Boudreau and joined Jackie Robinson, Roy Campanella and Don Newcombe as the first black players to be amongst those chosen to participate in the 1949 All-Star Game. Boudreau fined Doby after he attempted to steal home with no outs and bases loaded in a game against the Yankees on July 20. Of the fine, Boudreau said, &quot;It was not based only on that attempt to steal home. Larry has taken several unnecessary chances lately. This should make him more careful.&quot; His home run (24) and RBI (85) totals increased during the 1949 season, and by 1950, he was considered the best center fielder in the game by &quot;The Sporting News&quot;. By the first week in July, Doby&#x27;s .370 batting average trailed only 1949 AL batting champion George Kell, who had a .375 average. He earned career-bests in batting average (.326), hits (164) and on-base percentage (OBP) (.442), while playing in 142 games. Doby hit the 100-RBI mark (102) for the first time in his career while his OBP led the AL. He finished eighth in AL MVP voting, highest among outfielders. At the end of the season, Cleveland signed him to a new, more lucrative contract. Doby was named by Cleveland sports writers as the Cleveland Baseball Man of the Year after the season, the first time a black player was chosen.

====1951–1955====
Doby hit 20 home runs and 69 RBIs in 1951, both fewer than the previous season, and his batting average improved to .295. His 21-game hit-streak was the second-longest for the Indians that season, behind Dale Mitchell&#x27;s mark of 23 games in a row. Indians general manager Hank Greenberg reduced Doby&#x27;s salary due to the lower home run numbers despite Doby, who attributed the lower numbers to tightness in his legs, stating he would not accept a pay cut. Indians manager Al López confirmed that Doby was injury-riddled throughout the season, stating that he &quot;was beset by first one injury and then another&quot; including &quot;a muscle tear in his thigh, a groin pull, an ankle twist.&quot; Doby received blame for the Indians&#x27; failure to win the AL pennant and was labeled a &quot;loner&quot; by some in the press, including &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; sports editor Gordon Cobbledick who in an article in &quot;Sport&quot; wrote &quot;Larry&#x27;s a mixed-up guy—a badly mixed-up guy&quot; stemming from &quot;the emotional impact of discovering racial prejudice against him.&quot; Cobbledick also took issue with Doby&#x27;s assertion that opposing pitchers were knocking him down due to Doby being black. The assertion was confirmed by Sam Lacy, who wrote in the &quot;Baltimore Afro-American&quot;, &quot;Statistics show that eight colored players in the two major leagues were hit by pitches a total of 68 times during the 1951 campaign, an average of times per man. No other player was hit as many as eight times in the season.&quot;

One month before spring training for the 1952 season, Doby employed former Olympic track and field athlete Harrison Dillard to come to his home in New Jersey to prepare his legs in hopes of eliminating injuries, which had affected him the previous season. Dillard and the Indians&#x27; team doctor prescribed lower-body warm-ups to Doby before the start of each game. Leg injuries continued to bother Doby during the start of the season. On June 4, 1952, he hit for the cycle. By the end of the 1952 season, Doby was second in the AL in RBIs to teammate Al Rosen by one, 105 to 104. His .541 slugging percentage, runs scored (104), strikeout (111), and home run (32) totals were all highest in the AL.

Leading up to the 1953 season, Doby asked Greenberg and Indians management for a pay raise after earning $22,000 the previous season. In early March, the raise was granted, and he was slated to make $28,000 that year. For 1953, Doby had a .263 batting average, which was his lowest since joining the league in 1947. He led the AL in strikeouts for the second and final time in his career, a career-high 121 times, but hit 29 home runs and 102 RBIs on the year. He also had 96 walks, which was third in the AL.

For the sixth time in his major league career, Doby was named an All-Star during the 1954 season, one of five Indians named. The game was held at Cleveland&#x27;s Municipal Stadium and featured the second-largest crowd to watch an All-Star Game (the largest was in 1935 at the same stadium). In what would prove his final career All-Star at bat, Doby hit a pinch-hit solo home run in the eighth inning to tie the game at 9–9; the AL squad went on to win, 11–9. His home run was the first hit by a black player in an All-Star Game. The game, which had a record 17 hits by the AL and was the highest-scoring All-Star Game until 1998, was called the best ever by All-Star Game founder Arch Ward. As the regular season resumed, Doby helped the Indians to win a franchise-record 111 games and the AL pennant. His regular season 32 home runs and career-high 126 RBIs were highest in the AL, which led to him finishing second in AL MVP voting. The Indians were swept in the 1954 World Series by Doby&#x27;s former Eagles teammate Monte Irvin and the New York Giants.

In his last full season with the Indians in 1955, Doby was selected for his seventh consecutive and final All-Star Game. Doby&#x27;s leg injuries affected him severely at this point in his career and he did not enter the game. He finished the 1955 season with 26 home runs and 75 RBIs while hitting .291 in 131 games, his fewest played since 1948. Not all in Cleveland were disappointed to see Doby leaving. Wrote one &quot;Plain Dealer&quot; columnist, Franklin Lewis: &quot;He has been a controversial athlete. Highly gifted, he was frequently morose, sullen, and upon occasion, downright surly to his teammates ... He thought of himself, at the beginning, as the symbol of the Negro in his league.&quot; Doby responded, &quot;I was looked on as a Black man, not as a human being. I did feel a responsibility to the Black players who came after me, but that was a responsibility, basically, to people, not just to Black people.&quot;

===Later years (1956–1960)===
After spending nine seasons with Cleveland, Doby was traded on October 25, 1955, to the Chicago White Sox for Chico Carrasquel and Jim Busby. Chicago was looking for a consistent home run hitter after finishing the season with 116 home runs as a team. &quot;The search is over for a long ball hitter. We&#x27;ve certainly needed a consistent one—and we&#x27;ve been eying Doby for some time&quot;, said White Sox vice president Chuck Comiskey. White Sox manager Marty Marion believed Doby&#x27;s bat would be a welcome addition to his club when he said, &quot;The guy used to murder us when we played Cleveland. He&#x27;ll make a big difference in the number of one-run and two-run decisions we might lose.&quot; After winning a doubleheader against the Yankees on June 22, 1956, Doby and the White Sox swept New York, the first time since the 1945 season the Yankees had been swept in a four-game series. The White Sox won eight straight games, the longest winning streak in the AL to that point in the season, and had done so with the help of Doby&#x27;s six home runs during the eight-game stretch. &quot;You know, when we dealt for Doby, we weren&#x27;t worried about Larry. We knew he&#x27;d come through&quot;, Comiskey said. Doby finished the season with a .268 batting average and led the team with 24 home runs and 102 RBIs. Chicago finished 1956 in third place in the AL with an 85–69 record.

In a game on August 20, 1957, against the Washington Senators, Doby helped preserve pitcher Bob Keegan&#x27;s no-hitter with a backhand catch off a long line drive from Herb Plews, one of &quot;two close calls&quot; for Keegan that game. His 1957 home run total of 14 tied for the team-high, as he managed a .288 average and recorded 79 RBIs, second-highest on the team after former Indians teammate Minnie Miñoso. The White Sox finished second in the AL with a 90–64 record.
Doby was part of a December 3, 1957, multi-player trade between the White Sox and Baltimore Orioles, then was traded again on April 1 to Cleveland along with Don Ferrarese for Gene Woodling, Bud Daley, and Dick Williams. He appeared in 89 games with the Indians that season and had a .289 batting average, 13 home runs, and 45 RBIs. He was sent to the Detroit Tigers on March 21, 1959, in exchange for Tito Francona. Tigers general manager Rick Ferrell said, &quot;this gives us some more power and we just hope Doby hits as well in Briggs Stadium this season as he has in other years.&quot; He hit .218 with four RBIs before Detroit sold the 35-year-old Doby to the White Sox on May 13 for $20,000.

After 21 games with the White Sox, he was sent to Triple-A affiliate San Diego Padres of the Pacific Coast League after hitting .241 with no home runs and 9 RBIs. Doby fractured an ankle while sliding into third base after hitting a triple during a road game the Padres played against Sacramento, and was sent to a local hospital in Sacramento before going to Johns Hopkins Hospital for further evaluation. Doby worked out with the White Sox before the 1960 season but, due to nagging injuries, did not earn a roster spot. In late April he joined the Toronto Maple Leafs of the International League on a trial basis but was released by the team on May 6 after X-rays showed bone deterioration in his affected ankle.

Doby finished his 13-year major league career with a .283 batting average, accumulated 1,515 hits, 253 home runs and 970 RBIs in 1,533 games and 5,348 at-bats. Of his 1,533 career games, 1,146 of them were spent with the Indians. &quot;I played against great talent in the Major Leagues and I played against great talent in the Negro Leagues. I didn&#x27;t see a lot of difference&quot;, said Doby.

===Nippon baseball (1962)===
Doby had participated in baseball clinics in 1962 as a member of a travel delegation from the U.S. Department of State. That year, Doby came out of retirement and became one of the first Americans to play professional baseball in Japan&#x27;s Nippon Professional Baseball league when he and Don Newcombe, a former teammate with the Newark Eagles, signed contracts with the Chunichi Dragons. Doby spent the season splitting his time between 1B (36 games) and RF (34 games) and batted .225 with 10 HR, 35 RBI, and 27 runs in 240 at bats. After the season, Doby returned to the U.S. in October and resumed his work as a liquor retailer.

==Managerial and executive appointments==
After retiring as a player, Doby became a scout with the Montreal Expos in 1969 and served as a minor league instructor with the organization in 1970. He was batting coach under manager Gene Mauch from 1971 to 1973 and again in 1976. He managed various teams during five seasons of winter league baseball in Venezuela, including Águilas del Zulia during the 1970–71 winter season. Doby rejoined the Indians for the 1974 season as first base coach for manager Ken Aspromonte. When Aspromonte was fired after the 1974 season, the Indians named Frank Robinson the club&#x27;s player-manager and baseball&#x27;s first black manager.

After Robinson&#x27;s hire as manager, Doby returned to work for the Expos. In 1976, Bill Veeck purchased the White Sox for a second time and hired Doby to be the team&#x27;s batting coach. As a team, the White Sox finished the 1976 season with a .255 batting average, 586 runs scored and 73 home runs. By June 29, 1977, the team&#x27;s average was .284, and had recorded 382 runs scored and 87 home runs. They finished the season fourth in team batting average (.278) and had 192 home runs and 844 runs scored as a team. After firing the White Sox&#x27;s manager and former Doby teammate Bob Lemon, Veeck replaced him with Doby on June 30, 1978. At age 53, Doby became the second black manager in the majors after Robinson. &quot;It&#x27;s so nice to work for a man like Bill Veeck. You just work as hard as you can, and if the opportunity arises, you will certainly get the opportunity to fulfill your dreams&quot;, Doby said after being named White Sox manager.

To that point in the season, the White Sox had a 34–40 record. On July 1 in his first game as manager, the White Sox suffered a 10–0 loss to the Minnesota Twins but Doby won his second game, 8–5, the next day against the same team. The White Sox finished 71–90, including 37–50 under Doby, in what would be Doby&#x27;s sole managerial role. Veeck hired player-manager Don Kessinger to succeed Doby after deciding not to re-hire Doby, although Kessinger resigned as manager in the second half of the 1979 season. After removing Doby from the manager&#x27;s role and reassigning him to batting coach, the position Doby held before being named manager, Veeck said, &quot;Larry will always have a role on this team in some capacity.&quot; He served in that role for one additional season and resigned in October 1979.

After retiring from baseball, Doby was named director of communications for the National Basketball Association&#x27;s New Jersey Nets from 1980 to 1989 and also served as the Nets&#x27; director of community affairs until 1990. Doby was named special assistant to the AL&#x27;s last president, Gene Budig, on April 17, 1995.

===Managerial record===
==Second man==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; wrote, &quot;In glorifying those who are first, the second is often forgotten ... Larry Doby integrated all those American League ball parks where Jackie Robinson never appeared. And he did it with class and clout.&quot; During the 1997 season, when the long-departed Jackie Robinson&#x27;s number 42 was being retired throughout baseball, and the still-living Doby was being virtually ignored by the media, an editorial in &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; pointed out that Doby had to suffer the same indignities that Robinson did, and with nowhere near the media attention and implicit support. Scoop Jackson in 2007 wrote, in response to the tradition of MLB players wearing jerseys in homage of Robinson, &quot;Second place finishers in America are suckers. And so are those who make the story of history less simple than it needs to be. This happens sometimes in America. Those who don&#x27;t come first or don&#x27;t do things a certain way get lost. They disappear.&quot; In a 1978 interview, Doby said, &quot;Jackie got all the publicity for putting up with it (racial slurs). But it was the same thing I had to deal with. He was first, but the crap I took was just as bad. Nobody said, &#x27;We&#x27;re gonna be nice to the second Black&#x27;&quot;.

Doby served as one of the pallbearers at Robinson&#x27;s funeral. As fellow Hall of Famer Joe Morgan wrote, &quot;Anyone who knew Larry knew that he admired Robinson and was never jealous of the attention Robinson received.&quot; Former teammate Al Rosen said:

Jackie was a college educated man who had been an officer in the service and who played at the Triple-A level. Jackie was brought in by Branch Rickey specifically to be the first black player in major league baseball. Larry Doby came up as a second baseman who didn&#x27;t have time to get his full college education, and was forced to play a different position in his first major league season. I think, because of those circumstances, he had a more difficult time than Jackie Robinson. I don&#x27;t think he has gotten the credit he deserves.

Doby experienced many prejudices during his time before, during, and after the majors. One incident took place during a game as Doby was sliding into second base when the shortstop from the opposing team spat tobacco juice on him. Doby called it the worst injustice he experienced on the field. He endured many racial slurs, from the stands and elsewhere, during games. He also received death threats. After he had retired as a player, Doby recalled memories of his days as a barrier-breaker. &quot;You know why I hit so well in Washington and St. Louis? They were major Jim Crow seating parks and when I came to bat, I knew where the noise was coming from and who was making it. I felt like a quarterback with 5,000 cheerleaders calling his name. You know most of them couldn&#x27;t afford to be there. I never forgot them.&quot;

Shortly after the Indians had honored Doby by naming a nearby street after him, &quot;The Plain Dealer&quot; columnist Bill Livingston wrote, &quot;The Larry Doby way of pioneering was the same as the Jackie Robinson way in the National League, only Doby&#x27;s debut occurred six short weeks later and with almost no advance preparation by Doby or the Indians.&quot; Doby threw out the ceremonial first pitch at the 1997 Major League Baseball All-Star Game, played at Jacobs Field. The decision to have the game in Cleveland coincided with the 1997 season marking the fiftieth anniversary of Robinson breaking baseball&#x27;s color barrier. It was also 50 years and 3 days since Doby became the first black player in the American League.

==Hall of Fame==
Doby was elected into the National Baseball Hall of Fame on March 3, 1998, by the Veterans Committee at the age of 74. &quot;This is just a tremendous feeling. It&#x27;s kind of like a bale of cotton has been on your shoulders, and now it&#x27;s off&quot;, said Doby. When he received word about his election, it was by a telephone call from fellow Hall member Ted Williams. Upon hearing of Doby&#x27;s election, Gene Mauch, said, &quot;You have to be some kind of special person to go through what Larry and Jackie Robinson went through. They both are. I&#x27;m not too sure there&#x27;s a player in the game today who could handle it.&quot;

He was inducted into the National Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum on July 26, 1998. Doby became the first member born in South Carolina elected to the Hall. Although he was the first to play in MLB, Doby was the last member elected to the Hall of the four players to ever play in both a Negro league and MLB World Series, the others being Satchel Paige, Monte Irvin, and Willie Mays.

==Death ==
Doby and his wife, Helyn, had five children, six grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. When the Dobys moved to Montclair, Yogi Berra and his wife became neighborhood friends and children of the two families played baseball and football together. Doby had a kidney removed in 1997 after a cancerous tumor was detected. Helyn, married to Doby for 55 years, died in 2001 after a six-month battle with cancer.

Doby died on June 18, 2003, at his home in Montclair, New Jersey, at age 79 after suffering from cancer. When Doby died, President George W. Bush made the following statement:

MLB Commissioner Bud Selig (1992–2015) released a statement a day following Doby&#x27;s death:

Former MLB Commissioner Fay Vincent said:

==Honors and legacy==

Long before Doby was inducted into the Baseball Hall of Fame came induction in the Indians Hall of Fame in August 1966. Later, in May 1973, he was inducted into the South Carolina Hall of Fame and in 2010, the New Jersey Hall of Fame. On August 10, 2007, the Indians paid tribute to Doby on Larry Doby Day by collectively using his number (14) on their uniforms. The franchise again honored him when in 2012, Eagle Avenue, next to the Indians&#x27; Progressive Field, was renamed &quot;Larry Doby Way&quot; in an on-field postgame ceremony. Among those present at the ceremony were former star pitcher Jim &quot;Mudcat&quot; Grant, Indians president Mark Shapiro, Cleveland mayor Frank Jackson, and various members of Doby&#x27;s family. The Indians unveiled a life-sized bronze statue of Doby outside Progressive Field on July 25, 2015.

The South Carolina chapter of the Society for American Baseball Research, located in Aiken, South Carolina, is named after Doby, a native South Carolinian.

In 1997, Princeton University awarded Doby an honorary Doctorate of Humanities.

The city of Paterson, New Jersey, renamed the Eastside Park baseball field &quot;Larry Doby Field&quot; on June 1, 2002. The Yogi Berra Museum and Learning Center has a section named the Larry Doby Wing. Of Berra, Doby said, &quot;Yogi was one of the first opposing players to talk to me. As a catcher, Yogi talked to everybody. I finally had to tell the umpire: &#x27;Please tell him to shut up. He asked me how my family was back in the first inning.&#x27;&quot;

In 2011, the U.S. Postal Service announced that Doby would be one of the four baseball players (along with Ted Williams, Joe DiMaggio, and Willie Stargell) to appear on a postage stamp in 2012, as part of its &quot;Major League Baseball All-Stars&quot; series. The stamp was released July 21, 2012.

In 2013, the Bob Feller Act of Valor Award honored Doby as one of 37 Baseball Hall of Fame members for his service in the United States Navy during World War II.

In 2022, the Garden State Parkway&#x27;s Brookdale North Service Area in Bloomfield, New Jersey was renamed the Larry Doby Service Area.

On December 23, 2023, on what would have been his 100th birthday, Doby was posthumously awarded a Congressional Gold Medal.

<text>Chronic wasting disease (CWD), sometimes called zombie deer disease, is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE) affecting deer. TSEs are a family of diseases thought to be caused by misfolded proteins called prions and include similar diseases such as BSE (mad cow disease) in cattle, Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease (CJD) in humans, and scrapie in sheep. Natural infection causing CWD affects members of the deer family. In the United States, CWD affects mule deer, white-tailed deer, red deer, sika deer, elk, bison, squirrels, antelope, caribou, and moose. The transmission of CWD to other species such as squirrel monkeys and humanized mice has been observed in experimental settings.

In 1967, CWD was first identified in mule deer at a government research facility in northern Colorado, United States. It was initially recognized as a clinical &quot;wasting&quot; syndrome and then in 1978, it was identified more specifically as a TSE disease. Since then, CWD has been found in free-ranging and captive animal populations in 33 US states and five Canadian provinces. In addition, CWD has been found in one Minnesota red deer farm, one wild reindeer herd in Norway (March 2016) as well as in wild moose. Single cases of CWD in moose have been found in Finland (March 2018) and in Sweden (March and May 2019, September 2020). CWD was found in South Korea in some deer imported from Canada. CWD is typified by chronic weight loss and clinical signs compatible with brain lesions, aggravated over time, always leading to death. 

Although reports in the popular press have been made of humans being affected by CWD, by 2004 a study for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) suggested, &quot;[m]ore epidemiologic and laboratory studies are needed to monitor the possibility of such transmissions&quot;. A 2019 study concluded that &quot;the potential exists for transmission to humans and subsequent human disease&quot;. The epidemiological study further concluded, &quot;as a precaution, hunters should avoid eating deer and elk tissues known to harbor the CWD agent (e.g., brain, spinal cord, eyes, spleen, tonsils, lymph nodes) from areas where CWD has been identified&quot;. In April 2024, it was revealed that two men from the same hunting group contracted Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease, prompting medical researchers to speculate transmission had occurred from consuming CWD-positive venison.

==History==
Chronic wasting disease was first discovered by American wildlife veterinarian Beth S. Williams. Williams performed necropsies on deer and elk that had died of an unknown syndrome. She recognized that the brain lesions in these animals were consistent with transmissible spongiform encephalopathy (TSE). In 1978, she and neuropathologist Stuart Young cowrote the first scientific paper that named the disease and described it as a TSE.

In February 2003, the Centers for Disease Control published a report of &quot;Fatal degenerative neurologic illnesses in men who participated in wild game feasts--Wisconsin, 2002&quot;. It read in conclusion that &quot;Although no association between CWD and CJD was found, continued surveillance of both diseases remains important to assess the possible risk for CWD transmission to humans.&quot; In September 2003, Hoey pointed out that one of the three patients (the 55 year-old) &quot;presented with a 3-month history of difficulty in writing and unsteadiness of gait, followed by dementia, speech abnormalities and myoclonic jerking. Pathologic examination of the brain at autopsy 3 months later revealed widespread subcortical spongiform lesions consistent with CJD.&quot;

As of 2013 Patrice Klein the CWD Program Manager at USDA/APHIS rejected the somewhat inconclusive findings of Hoey and stated that no evidence had been found of transmission to humans from deer, nor by eating animals in the deer family, but both channels remain a subject of public health surveillance and research.

===Quebec farm outbreak===
The MFFP ministry in Quebec practiced 9500 tests in the period between 2007 and autumn 2018 before they detected a seropositive case in September 2018.

The September 2018 discovery of CWD on a managed operation in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge Quebec prompted a wholesale slaughter of 3500 animals in two months before the enterprise shut down permanently. The CFIA ordered the cull, as well as the decontamination of of soil in certain places on the operation. Post-discovery, each animal was tested for CWD by the CFIA before it was released onto the market. Other Quebec producers lamented the glut of supply. A 400 km2 quarantine area was declared, in which all hunting and trapping activities were banned. The government slaughtered hundreds of wild animals over a two-month period. The routine cull for market was between 70 and 100 animals per week. When the producer was forced to close, the weekly slaughter neared 500 animals per week. One year later, 750 wild specimens had been culled in the 45 km-radius &quot;enhanced monitoring area&quot;, and none tested positive for CWD.
It came to light in August 2019 that prior to 2014 in Canada, all animals on CWD-infected farms were buried or incinerated. Since 2014, however, the CFIA has allowed animals from CWD-infected farms to enter the food chain because there is &quot;no national requirement to have animals tested for the disease&quot;. From one CWD-infected herd in Alberta, 131 elk were sold for human consumption.

For the fall 2019 hunting season in western Quebec, the provincial ministry relaxed the rules for the annual white-tailed deer (WTD) hunt, in an effort to curb the spread of CWD. Any WTD can be hunted with any weapon in certain municipalities in the Outaouais valley and the Laurentides. The MFFP hopes thereby to receive more samples to test for CWD. The quarantine around Grenville was still in place, and the ministry specifically prohibited (only) the &quot;removal&quot; from the quarantine &quot;enhanced monitoring area&quot; zone of &quot;the head, more specifically any part of the brain, the eyes, the retropharyngeal lymph nodes and the tonsils, any part of the spinal column, the internal organs (including the liver and the heart), and the testicles.&quot;

== Signs and symptoms ==
Due to CWD taking 18–24 months after initial exposure to onset, most cases of CWD occur in adult animals; the youngest animal to exhibit clinical symptoms of the disease was 15 months. The disease is progressive and always fatal. The first signs are difficulties in movement. The most obvious and consistent clinical sign of CWD is weight loss over time. Behavioral changes also occur in the majority of cases, including decreased interactions with other animals, listlessness, lowering of the head, tremors, repetitive walking in set patterns, and nervousness. Excessive salivation and grinding of the teeth also are observed. Most deer show increased drinking and urination; the increased drinking and salivation may contribute to the spread of the disease. Loss of fear of humans and appearance of confusion are also common. The APHIS summarized it as:

The cause of CWD (like other TSEs, such as scrapie and bovine spongiform encephalopathy) is a prion, a misfolded form of a normal protein, known as prion protein (PrP), that is most commonly found in the central nervous system (CNS) and peripheral nervous system (PNS). The misfolded form has been shown to be capable of converting normally folded prion protein, PrPC (&quot;C&quot; for cellular) into an abnormal form, PrPSc (&quot;Sc&quot; for scrapie), thus leading to a chain reaction. CWD is thought to be transmitted by this mechanism. The abnormality in PrP has its genetic basis in a particular variant of the protein-coding gene &quot;PRNP&quot; that is highly conserved among mammals and has been found and sequenced in deer. The build-up of PrPd in the brain is associated with widespread neurodegeneration.

===Genetics===
The allele which encodes leucine, codon 132 in the family of Elks, is either homozygous LL, homozygous MM, or heterozygous ML. Individuals with the first encoding seem to resist clinical signs of CWD, whereas individuals with either of the other two encodings have much shorter incubation periods.

In white-tailed deer, polymorphisms at codons 95 (Q-&gt;H) and 96 (G-&gt;S) dramatically affect CWD progression and prion strain specification. Deer containing the 96S allele have delayed progression to clinical disease onset.

When deer with the 95H polymorphism become infected, they select for altered strains of CWD.

=== Spread ===
Researchers in July 2019 stated that &quot;with all the research on the malignity of prions, and the permanence of prions in the wider environment, and their resistance to destruction and degradation, it is necessary to reduce the potential sources of exposure to CWD.&quot; In fact an APHIS scientist observed that, while the longevity of CWD prion is unknown, the scrapie prion has been measured to endure for 16 years. The PrPCWD protein is insoluble in all but the strongest solvents, and highly resistant to digestion by proteases. PrPCWD converts the normal protein PrPC into more of itself upon contact, and binds together forming aggregates. Prusiner noted in 2001 that:

However, it is noted that , although CWD prions were transmissible within the &quot;cervidae&quot; family, CWD was not considered transmissible to humans or to cattle.

How the prions that cause CWD spread is unknown, but recent research indicates that prions can be excreted by deer and elk, and are transmitted by eating grass growing in contaminated soil. Animals born in captivity and those born in the wild have been affected with the disease. Transmission of CWD is thought to be lateral (from animal to animal). Maternal transmission may occur, although it appears to be relatively unimportant in maintaining epidemics. An infected deer&#x27;s saliva is able to spread the CWD prions. Exposure between animals is associated with sharing food and water sources contaminated with CWD prions shed by diseased deer.

==== Direct ====

CWD may be directly transmitted by contact with infected animals, their bodily tissues, and their bodily fluids. Spread may result from contact with infected deer regardless of if they are symptomatic.

Ticks harbor transmission-relevant quantities of infectious prions; consumption of ticks during grooming (alogrooming), a behavior typical of interactions among female deer and females and young, may contribute to oral prion exposures and between-deer (including maternal to offspring) transmission. 

Recent research on Rocky Mountain elk found that with CWD-infected females, many subclinical, a high rate (80%) of maternal-to-offspring transmission of CWD prions occurred, regardless of gestational period. While not dispositive relative to disease development in the fetus, this does suggest that maternal transmission may be yet another important route of direct CWD transmission.

Modern news stories and anecdotal evidence from treating physicians suggest that a human may have contracted Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease via the consumption of squirrel brains infected with CWD.

==== Experimental transmission ====

In addition to the cervid species in which CWD is known to naturally occur, black-tailed deer and European red deer have been demonstrated to be naturally susceptible to CWD. Other cervid species, including caribou, are also suspected to be naturally vulnerable to this disease. Many other non-cervid mammalian species have been experimentally infected with CWD, either orally or by intracerebral inoculation. These species include monkeys, sheep, cattle, prairie voles, mice, and ferrets.

An experimental case study of oral transmission of CWD to reindeer shows certain reindeer breeds may be susceptible to CWD, while other subpopulations may be protective against CWD in free-ranging populations. None of the reindeer in the study showed symptoms of CWD, potentially signifying resistance to different CWD strains.

==== Indirect ====

Environmental transmission has been linked to contact with infected bodily fluids and tissues, as well as contact with contaminated environments. Once in the environment, CWD prions may remain infectious for many years. Thus, decomposition of diseased carcasses, infected &quot;gut piles&quot; from hunters who field dress their cervid harvests, and the urine, saliva, feces, and antler velvet of infected individuals that are deposited in the environment, all have the potential to create infectious environmental reservoirs of CWD.

In 2013, researchers at the National Wildlife Research Center in Fort Collins, Colorado, successfully infected white-tailed deer with the misfolded prion via the nasal passage, when the prions were mixed with clay. This was important because the prions had already been shown by 2006 to bind with sandy quartz clay minerals.

One avian scavenger, the American crow, was recently evaluated as a potential vector for CWD. As CWD prions remain viable after passing through the bird&#x27;s digestive tract, crows represent a possible mechanism for the creation of environmental reservoirs of CWD. Additionally, the crows&#x27; extensive geographic range presents ample opportunities for them to come in contact with CWD. This, coupled with the population density and longevity of communal roosting sites in both urban and rural locations, suggests that the fecal deposits at roosting sites may represent a CWD environmental reservoir. Conservative estimates for crows&#x27; fecal deposits at one winter roosting site for one winter season ranged from 391,552 to 599,032 kg.

CWD prions adhere so tightly to soil surface particles that the ground becomes a source of infection and may be a major route of transmission due to frequent ground contact when animals in the deer family graze.

==Prevention==

By 2012, a voluntary system of control was published by APHIS in the US Federal Register. It depended on voluntary minimum standards methodology, and herd certification programs to avoid interstate movement of the disease vector. It was based on a risk management framework. As of August 2019, APHIS law in 9 CFR Part 55 - CONTROL OF CHRONIC WASTING DISEASE dealt with this problem.

Introduced for the 2019 Minnesota hunting season, a no-cost deer carcass-incineration program was rolled out by Crow Wing County officials hoping to stem the spread of CWD in the region. CWD was found among wild deer in Crow Wing County for the first time in January 2019. The voluntary program encourages both residents and visiting hunters to bring harvested deer carcasses to the county landfill east of Brainerd, Minnesota for incineration and disposal.

In 2023, Minnesota funded a Center for Infectious Disease Research and Policy (CIDRAP) project to assemble 70 public health experts from around the world to devise a response plan for potential human spillover. Michael Osterholm, an infectious disease expert at the University of Minnesota, stressed the urgency of preparedness, noting that the prion responsible for CWD is evolving and becoming more capable of infecting humans. Despite these concerns, a 2022 study by the National Institutes of Health indicated that the likelihood of prions infecting human brain cells remains remote.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis is based on &quot;post mortem&quot; examination (necropsy) and testing; examination of the dead body is not definitive, as many animals die early in the course of the disease and conditions found are nonspecific; general signs of poor health and aspiration pneumonia, which may be the actual cause of death, are common. On microscopic examination, lesions of CWD in the CNS resemble those of other TSEs. In addition, scientists use immunohistochemistry to test brain, lymph, and neuroendocrine tissues for the presence of the abnormal prion protein to diagnose CWD; positive IHC findings in the obex is considered the gold standard. Conventional CWD diagnostic strategies and seeded amplification methods for amplifying CWD prions &quot;in vitro&quot; include: immunohistochemistry (IHC), western blotting (WB), enzyme immunoassay (EIA), protein misfolding cyclic amplification (PMCA), and real time quaking-induced conversion (RT-QuIC).

Available tests, as of July 2019, at the CFIA were not sensitive enough to detect the prion in specimens from animals younger than a year old. Strategies are being developed to allow for the quantification of prion burden in a tissue, body fluid, or environmental sample.

As of 2015, no commercially feasible diagnostic tests could be used on live animals. As early as 2001 an &quot;antemortem&quot; test was deemed urgent. Running a bioassay, taking fluids from animals in the deer family suspected of infection and incubating them in transgenic mice that express the cervid prion protein, can be used to determine whether the cervid is infected, but ethical issues exist with this, and it is not scalable.

A tonsillar biopsy technique has been a reliable method of testing for CWD in live deer, but it only seems to be effective on mule deer and white-tailed deer, not elk. Biopsies of the rectal mucosa have also been effective at detecting CWD in live mule deer, white-tailed deer, and elk, though detection efficacy may be influenced by numerous factors including animal age, genotype, and disease stage.

It is possible for CWD prions to survive sterilization procedures involving an autoclave.

== Epidemiology ==
===North America===
The disease was first identified in 1967 in a closed herd of captive mule deer in contiguous portions of northeastern Colorado. In 1980, the disease was determined to be a TSE. It was first identified in wild elk and mule deer and white-tailed deer in the early 1980s in Colorado and Wyoming, and in farmed elk in 1997. The disease did not affect Canada until 1996.

In May 2001, CWD was also found in free-ranging deer in the southwestern corner of Nebraska (adjacent to Colorado and Wyoming) and later in additional areas in western Nebraska. The limited area of northern Colorado, southern Wyoming, and western Nebraska in which free-ranging deer, moose, and/or elk positive for CWD have been found is referred to as the endemic area. The area in 2006 has expanded to six states, including parts of eastern Utah, southwestern South Dakota, and northwestern Kansas. Also, areas not contiguous (to the endemic area) areas in central Utah and central Nebraska have been found. The limits of the affected areas are not well defined, since the disease is at a low incidence and the amount of sampling may not be adequate to detect it. In 2002, CWD was detected in wild deer in south-central Wisconsin and northern Illinois and in an isolated area of southern New Mexico. In 2005, it was found in wild white-tailed deer in New York and in Hampshire County, West Virginia. In 2008, the first confirmed case of CWD in Michigan was discovered in an infected deer on an enclosed deer-breeding facility. It is also found in the Canadian provinces of Alberta and Saskatchewan.

In February 2011, the Maryland Department of Natural Resources reported the first confirmed case of the disease in that state. The affected animal was a white-tailed deer killed by a hunter.

CWD has also been diagnosed in farmed elk and deer herds in a number of states and in two Canadian provinces. The first positive farmed-elk herd in the United States was detected in 1997 in South Dakota.
Since then, additional positive elk herds and farmed white-tailed deer herds have been found in South Dakota (7), Nebraska (4), Colorado (10), Oklahoma (1), Kansas (1), Minnesota (3), Montana (1), Wisconsin (6), and New York (2). As of fall of 2006, four positive elk herds in Colorado and a positive white-tailed deer herd in Wisconsin remain under state quarantine. All of the other herds have been depopulated or have been slaughtered and tested, and the quarantine has been lifted from one herd that underwent rigorous surveillance with no further evidence of disease. CWD also has been found in farmed elk in the Canadian provinces of Saskatchewan and Alberta. A retrospective study also showed mule deer exported from Denver to the Toronto Zoo in the 1980s were affected. In June 2015, the disease was detected in a male white-tailed deer on a breeding ranch in Medina County, Texas. State officials euthanized 34 deer in an effort to contain a possible outbreak.

In February 2018, the Mississippi Department of Wildlife, Fisheries, and Parks announced that a Mississippi deer tested positive for chronic wasting disease. Another Mississippi whitetail euthanized in Pontotoc County on 8 October 2018 tested positive for CWD. The disease was confirmed by the National Veterinary Services Laboratory in Ames, Iowa on 30 October 2018.

Species that have been affected with CWD include elk, mule deer, white-tailed deer, black-tailed deer, and moose. Other ruminant species, including wild ruminants and domestic cattle, sheep, and goats, have been housed in wildlife facilities in direct or indirect contact with CWD-affected deer and elk, with no evidence of disease transmission. However, experimental transmission of CWD into other ruminants by intracranial inoculation does result in disease, suggesting only a weak molecular species barrier exists. Research is ongoing to further explore the possibility of transmission of CWD to other species.

By April 2016, CWD had been found in captive animals in South Korea; the disease arrived there with live elk that were imported from Canada for farming in the late 1990s.

In the summer of 2018, cases were discovered in the Harpur Farm herd in Grenville-sur-la-Rouge, Quebec.

Over the course of 2018, 12% of the mule deer that were tested in Alberta, had a positive result. More than 8% of Alberta deer were deemed seropositive.

In 2022, it had been recorded that outbreaks of CWD had shown themselves in both the United States and Canada. CWD was present in 29 states, infecting herds of moose, deer and elk in 391 different counties. Alabama (1), Arkansas (19), Colorado (27), Idaho (1), Illinois (19), Iowa (12), Kansas (49), Louisiana (1), Maryland (1), Michigan (9), Minnesota (7), Mississippi (9), Missouri (21), Montana (23), Nebraska (43), New Mexico (3), New York (1), North Carolina (1), North Dakota (7), Ohio (2), Pennsylvania (14), South Dakota (19), Tennessee (14), Texas (7), Utah (7), Virginia (10), West Virginia (5), Wisconsin (37) and Wyoming (22).

In June 2023, as the spread continued, CWD was found in Oklahoma (1) in the wild and Florida (1) for the first time. A case in October 2023 in Yellowstone National Park, Wyoming, whose ecosystem supports the greatest and most diverse array of large wild mammals in the continental US, was reported. The first case in Kentucky was confirmed in December 2023.

In January 2024, British Columbia&#x27;s surveillance program identified its first two positive deer samples from the Kootenay region of the province. 

=== Europe ===
====Scandinavia====
In 2016, the first case of CWD in Europe was from the Nordfjella wild reindeer herd in southern Norway. Scientists found the diseased female reindeer as it was dying, and routine CWD screening at necropsy was unexpectedly positive. The origin of CWD in Norway is unknown, whereas import of infected deer from Canada was the source of CWD cases in South Korea. Norway has strict legislation and rules not allowing importation of live animals and deer into the country. Norway has a scrapie surveillance program since 1997; while no reports of scrapie within the range of Nordfjella reindeer population have been identified, sheep are herded through that region and are a potential source of infection.

In May and June 2016, two infected wild moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;) were found around north from the first case, in Selbu Municipality. By the end of August, a fourth case had been confirmed in a wild reindeer shot in the same area as the first case in March.

In 2017, the Norwegian Environment Agency released guidelines for hunters hunting reindeer in the Nordfjella areas. The guidelines contain information on identifying animals with CWD symptoms and instructions for minimizing the risk of contamination, as well as a list of supplies given to hunters to be used for taking and submitting samples from shot reindeer.

In March 2018, Finnish Food Safety Authority EVIRA stated that the first case of CWD in Finland had been diagnosed in a 15-year-old moose (&quot;Alces alces&quot;) that had died naturally in the municipality of Kuhmo in the Kainuu region. Before this case in Kuhmo, Norway was the only country in the European Economic Area where CWD has been diagnosed. The moose did not have the transmissible North American form of the disease, but similar to the Norwegian variant of CWD, an atypical or sporadic form which occurs incidentally in individual animals of the deer family. In Finland, CWD screening of fallen wild deer has been done since 2003. None of the roughly 2,500 samples analyzed so far have tested positive for the disease. The export of live animals of the deer family to other countries has been temporarily banned as a precautionary measure to stop the spread of the CWD, and moose hunters are going to be provided with more instructions before the start of the next hunting season, if appropriate. The export and sales of meat from deer will not be restricted and moose meat is considered safe to eat as only the brain and nervous tissue of infected moose contains prions.

In March 2019, the Swedish National Veterinary Institute (SVA) diagnosed the first case of CWD in Sweden. A 16-year old emaciated female moose was found in the municipality of Arjeplog in the county of Norrbotten, circling and with loss of shyness towards humans, possibly blind. The moose was euthanized and the head was sent for CWD screening in the national CWD surveillance program. The brainstem tissue, but not lymph nodes, was positive for CWD (confirmed with Western Blot). A second case of CWD was diagnosed in May 2019, with very similar case history, about 70 km east of the first case. This second case, in the municipality of Arvidsjaur, was also an emaciated and apathic 16-year-old female moose that was euthanized. The circumstances of these Swedish cases are similar to the CWD cases in moose in both Norway and Finland. The EU regulated CWD surveillance runs between 2018 – 2020. A minimum of 6,000 deer are to be tested, both free-ranging animals in the deer family, farmed red deer, and semi-domesticated reindeer. The finding of CWD-positive moose initiated an intensified surveillance in the affected municipalities. Adult hunter-harvested moose and slaughtered semi-domesticated reindeer from the area are tested for CWD. In September 2019, a third moose was found positive for CWD, a hunter-harvested 10-year-old apparently healthy female moose from Arjeplog. A fourth case of CWD in moose was verified in September 2020, in a euthanized 14-year-old lame and unshy female moose in the municipality of Robertsfors, in the county of Västerbotten, approximately 200 km from the previous moose cases in the neighboring county of Norrbotten.

==Research==

Research is focused on better ways to monitor disease in the wild, live animal diagnostic tests, developing vaccines, better ways to dispose of animals that died from the disease and to decontaminate the environment, where prions can persist in soils, and better ways to monitor the food supply. Deer harvesting and management issues are intertwined.

<text>In Mesopotamian mythology, Lamashtu (; Akkadian d&quot;La-maš-tu&quot;; Sumerian &quot;Dimme&quot; d&quot;Dim3-me&quot; or &quot;Kamadme&quot;) is a demonic Mesopotamian deity with the &quot;head of a lion, the teeth of a donkey, naked breasts, a hairy body, hands stained (with blood?), long fingers and fingernails, and the feet of Anzû&quot;. She was believed to feed on the blood of human infants and was widely blamed as the cause of miscarriages and cot deaths. 

Although Lamashtu has traditionally been identified as a demoness, the fact that she could cause evil on her own without the permission of other deities strongly indicates that she was seen as a goddess in her own right. Mesopotamian peoples protected against her using amulets and talismans. She was believed to ride in her boat on the river of the underworld and she was associated with donkeys. She was believed to be the daughter of An.

==Mythology==
Lamashtu&#x27;s father was the Sky god Anu. Unlike many other usual demonic figures and depictions in Mesopotamian lore, Lamashtu was said to act in malevolence of her own accord, rather than at the gods&#x27; instructions. Along with this her name was written together with the cuneiform determinative indicating deity. This means she was a goddess or a demigoddess in her own right.

She bore seven names and was described as seven witches in incantations. Her evil deeds included (but were not limited to): slaying children, unborns, and neonates; causing harm to mothers and expectant mothers; eating men and drinking their blood; disturbing sleep; bringing nightmares; killing foliage; infesting rivers and lakes; and being a bringer of disease, sickness, and death.

Pazuzu, a god or demon, was invoked to protect birthing mothers and infants against Lamashtu&#x27;s malevolence, usually on amulets and statues. Although Pazuzu was said to be bringer of famine and drought, he was also invoked against evil for protection, and against plague, but he was primarily and popularly invoked against his fierce, malicious rival Lamashtu.

Incantation against Lamashtu:


In another incantation against her, she appears to be identified with Inanna:

==In modern culture==
* Lamashtu is a demon lord and the goddess of monsters, called the Mother of Beasts and Mistress of Insanity, in the role-playing game setting &quot;Pathfinder&quot;.
* Lamashtu appears as a character in the NBC television series &quot;Constantine&quot; in the episode &quot;The Saint of Last Resorts&quot;.
* Lamashtu is the title of a 2015 audiobook by Paul E Cooley.
* Lamashtu appears as the antagonist in the 2017 film &quot;Still/Born&quot;.
* The song &quot;lamashtu&quot; by Necrophobic on their 2018 album &quot;Mark of the Necrogram&quot; is named for Lamashtu.
* Lamashtu is depicted on the Ankaran Sarcophagus in the videogame &quot;&quot;.
* Lamashtu appears as the demon who possesses two young girls in &quot;The Exorcist: Believer&quot;.
* Lamashtu is worshipped in the 2022 Spanish horror film &quot;Venus&quot;.

==Ritual==
An Akkadian incantation and ritual against Lamashtu is edited in &quot;Texte aus der Umwelt des Alten Testaments&quot; vol. 2 (1988)
It is glossed as an &quot;incantation to dispel lasting fever and Lamashtu&quot;.
The prescribed ritual involves a Lamashtu figurine. A sacrifice of bread must be placed before the figurine and water must be poured over it. A black dog must be made to carry the figurine. Then it is placed near the head of the sick child for three days, with the heart of a piglet placed in its mouth. The incantation must be recited three times a day, besides further food sacrifices. At dusk on the third day, the figurine is taken outdoors and buried near the wall.

<doc id="249345" wikidata="Q726282" url="?curid=249345" title="Ninurta">
<text>Ninurta (: , possible meaning &quot;Lord [of] Barley&quot;), also known as Ninĝirsu (: , meaning &quot;Lord [of] Girsu&quot;), is an ancient Mesopotamian god associated with farming, healing, hunting, law, scribes, and war who was first worshipped in early Sumer. In the earliest records, he is a god of agriculture and healing, who cures humans of sicknesses and releases them from the power of demons. In later times, as Mesopotamia grew more militarized, he became a warrior deity, though he retained many of his earlier agricultural attributes. He was regarded as the son of the chief god Enlil and his main cult center in Sumer was the Eshumesha temple in Nippur. Ninĝirsu was honored by King Gudea of Lagash (ruled 2144–2124 BC), who rebuilt Ninĝirsu&#x27;s temple in Lagash. Later, Ninurta became beloved by the Assyrians as a formidable warrior. The Assyrian king Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883–859 BC) built a massive temple for him at Kalhu, which became his most important cult center from then on. 

In the epic poem &quot;Lugal-e&quot;, Ninurta slays the demon Asag using his talking mace Sharur and uses stones to build the Tigris and Euphrates rivers to make them useful for irrigation. In a poem sometimes referred to as the &quot;Sumerian &quot;Georgica&quot;&quot;, Ninurta provides agricultural advice to farmers. In an Akkadian myth, he was the champion of the gods against the Anzû bird after it stole the Tablet of Destinies from his father Enlil and, in a myth that is alluded to in many works but never fully preserved, he killed a group of warriors known as the &quot;Slain Heroes&quot;. His major symbols were a perched bird and a plow.

It has been suggested that Ninurta was the inspiration for the figure of Nimrod, a &quot;mighty hunter&quot; who is mentioned in association with Kalhu in the Book of Genesis, although the view has been disputed. He may also be mentioned in the Second Book of Kings under the name Nisroch. In the nineteenth century, Assyrian stone reliefs of winged, eagle-headed figures from the temple of Ninurta at Kalhu were commonly, but erroneously, identified as &quot;Nisrochs&quot; and they appear in works of fantasy literature from the time period.

== Worship ==

Ninurta was worshipped in Mesopotamia as early as the middle of the third millennium BC by the ancient Sumerians, and is one of the earliest attested deities in the region. His main cult center was the Eshumesha temple in the Sumerian city-state of Nippur, where he was worshipped as the god of agriculture and the son of the chief-god Enlil. Though they may have originally been separate deities, in historical times, the god Ninĝirsu, who was worshipped in the Sumerian city-state of Girsu, was always identified as a local form of Ninurta. According to the Assyriologists Jeremy Black and Anthony Green, the two gods&#x27; personalities are &quot;closely intertwined&quot;. As the city-state of Girsu declined in importance, Ninĝirsu became increasingly known as &quot;Ninurta&quot;. He became primarily characterized by the aggressive, warlike aspect of his nature.

In later times, Ninurta&#x27;s reputation as a fierce warrior made him immensely popular among the Assyrians. In the late second millennium BC, Assyrian kings frequently held names which included the name of Ninurta, such as Tukulti-Ninurta (&quot;the trusted one of Ninurta&quot;), Ninurta-apal-Ekur (&quot;Ninurta is the heir of [Ellil&#x27;s temple] Ekur&quot;), and Ninurta-tukulti-Ashur (&quot;Ninurta is the god Aššur&#x27;s trusted one&quot;). Tukulti-Ninurta I (ruled 1243–1207 BC) declares in one inscription that he hunts &quot;at the command of the god Ninurta, who loves me.&quot; Similarly, Adad-nirari II (ruled 911–891 BC) claimed Ninurta and Aššur as supporters of his reign, declaring his destruction of their enemies as moral justification for his right to rule. In the ninth century BC, when Ashurnasirpal II (ruled 883–859 BC) moved the capital of the Assyrian Empire to Kalhu, the first temple he built there was one dedicated to Ninurta. 
The walls of the temple were decorated with stone relief carvings, including one of Ninurta slaying the Anzû bird. Ashurnasirpal II&#x27;s son Shalmaneser III (ruled 859–824 BC) completed Ninurta&#x27;s ziggurat at Kalhu and dedicated a stone relief of himself to the god. On the carving, Shalmaneser III&#x27;s boasts of his military exploits and credits all his victories to Ninurta, declaring that, without Ninurta&#x27;s aid, none of them would have been possible. When Adad-nirari III (ruled 811–783 BC) dedicated a new endowment to the temple of Aššur in Assur, they were sealed with both the seal of Aššur and the seal of Ninurta.

After the capital of Assyria was moved away from Kalhu, Ninurta&#x27;s importance in the pantheon began to decline. Sargon II favored Nabu, the god of scribes, over Ninurta. Nonetheless, Ninurta still remained an important deity. Even after the kings of Assyria left Kalhu, the inhabitants of the former capital continued to venerate Ninurta, who they called &quot;Ninurta residing in Kalhu&quot;. Legal documents from the city record that those who violated their oaths were required to &quot;place two minas of silver and one mina of gold in the lap of Ninurta residing in Kalhu.&quot; The last attested example of this clause dates to 669 BC, the last year of the reign of King Esarhaddon (ruled 681 – 669 BC). The temple of Ninurta at Kalhu flourished until the end of the Assyrian Empire, hiring the poor and destitute as employees. The main cultic personnel were a &quot;šangû&quot;-priest and a chief singer, who were supported by a cook, a steward, and a porter. In the late seventh century BC, the temple staff witnessed legal documents, along with the staff of the temple of Nabu at Ezida. The two temples shared a &quot;qēpu&quot;-official.

== Iconography ==
On &quot;kudurrus&quot; from the Kassite Period ( 1600 – 1155 BC), a plough is captioned as a symbol of Ninĝirsu. The plough also appears in Neo-Assyrian art, possibly as a symbol of Ninurta. A perched bird is also used as a symbol of Ninurta during the Neo-Assyrian Period. One speculative hypothesis holds that the winged disc originally symbolized Ninurta during the ninth century BC, but was later transferred to Aššur and the sun-god Shamash. This idea is based on some early representations in which the god on the winged disc appears to have the tail of a bird. Most scholars have rejected this suggestion as unfounded. Astronomers of the eighth and seventh centuries BC identified Ninurta (or Pabilsaĝ) with the constellation Sagittarius. Alternatively, others identified him with the star Sirius, which was known in Akkadian as &quot;šukūdu&quot;, meaning &quot;arrow&quot;. The constellation of Canis Major, of which Sirius is the most visible star, was known as &quot;qaštu&quot;, meaning &quot;bow&quot;, after the bow and arrow Ninurta was believed to carry. In the MUL.APIN Ninurta is consistently identified with Mercury, as it is read: &quot;Mercury whose name is Ninurta travels the (same) path the Moon travels.&quot; However, in Babylonian times, Ninurta was associated with the planet Saturn, while Mercury became associated with Nabu.

== Family ==
Ninurta was believed to be the son of Enlil. In &quot;Lugal-e&quot;, his mother is identified as the goddess Ninmah, whom he renames Ninhursag, but, in &quot;Angim dimma&quot;, his mother is instead the goddess Ninlil. Under the name &quot;Ninurta&quot;, his wife is usually the goddess Gula, but, as Ninĝirsu, his wife is the goddess Bau. Gula was the goddess of healing and medicine and she was sometimes alternately said to be the wife of the god Pabilsaĝ or the minor vegetation god Abu. Bau was worshipped &quot;almost exclusively in Lagash&quot; and was sometimes alternately identified as the wife of the god Zababa. She and Ninĝirsu were believed to have two sons: the gods Ig-alima and Šul-šagana. Bau also had seven daughters, but Ninĝirsu was not claimed to be their father. As the son of Enlil, Ninurta&#x27;s siblings include: Nanna, Nergal, Ninazu, Enbilulu, and sometimes Inanna.

== Mythology ==
=== &quot;Lugal-e&quot; ===
Second only to the goddess Inanna, Ninurta probably appears in more myths than any other Mesopotamian deity. In the Sumerian poem &quot;Lugal-e&quot;, also known as &quot;Ninurta&#x27;s Exploits&quot;, a demon known as Asag has been causing sickness and poisoning the rivers. Ninurta confronts Asag, who is protected by an army of stone warriors. Ninurta slays Asag and his armies. Then Ninurta organizes the world, using the stones from the warriors he has defeated to build the mountains, which he designs so that the streams, lakes and rivers all flow into the Tigris and Euphrates rivers, making them useful for irrigation and agriculture. Ninurta&#x27;s mother Ninmah descends from Heaven to congratulate her son on his victory. Ninurta dedicates the mountain of stone to her and renames her Ninhursag, meaning &quot;Lady of the Mountain&quot;. Finally, Ninurta returns home to Nippur, where he is celebrated as a hero. This myth combines Ninurta&#x27;s role as a warrior deity with his role as an agricultural deity. The title &quot;Lugal-e&quot; means &quot;O king!&quot; and comes from the poem opening phrase in the original Sumerian. &quot;Ninurta&#x27;s Exploits&quot; is a modern title assigned to it by scholars. The poem was eventually translated into Akkadian after Sumerian became regarded as too difficult to understand.

A companion work to the &quot;Lugal-e&quot; is &quot;Angim dimma&quot;, or &quot;Ninurta&#x27;s Return to Nippur&quot;, which describes Ninurta&#x27;s return to Nippur after slaying Asag. It contains little narrative and is mostly a praise piece, describing Ninurta in larger-than-life terms and comparing him to the god An. &quot;Angim dimma&quot; is believed to have originally been written in Sumerian during the Third Dynasty of Ur ( 2112 – 2004 BC) or the early Old Babylonian Period ( 1830 – 1531 BC), but the oldest surviving texts of it date to Old Babylonian Period. Numerous later versions of the text have also survived. It was translated into Akkadian during the Middle Babylonian Period ( 1600 — 1155 BC).

=== Anzû myth ===
In the Old, Middle, and Late Babylonian myth of &quot;Anzû and the Tablet of Destinies&quot;, the Anzû is a giant, monstrous bird. Enlil gives Anzû a position as the guardian of his sanctuary, but Anzû betrays Enlil and steals the Tablet of Destinies, a sacred clay tablet belonging to Enlil that grants him his authority, while Enlil is preparing for his bath. The rivers dry up and the gods are stripped of their powers. The gods send Adad, Girra, and Shara to defeat the Anzû, but all of them fail. Finally, the god Ea proposes that the gods should send Ninurta, Enlil&#x27;s son. Ninurta confronts the Anzû and shoots it with his arrows, but the Tablet of Destinies has the power to reverse time and the Anzû uses this power to make Ninurta&#x27;s arrows fall apart in midair and revert to their original components.

Ninurta calls upon the south wind for aid, which rips the Anzû&#x27;s wings off. The god Dagan announces Ninurta&#x27;s victory in the assembly of the gods and, as a reward, Ninurta is granted a prominent seat on the council. Enlil sends the messenger god Birdu to request Ninurta to return the Tablet of Destinies. Ninurta&#x27;s reply to Birdu is fragmentary, but it is possible he may initially refuse to return the Tablet. In the end, however, Ninurta does return the Tablet of Destinies to his father. This story was particularly popular among scholars of the Assyrian royal court.

The myth of &quot;Ninurta and the Turtle&quot;, recorded in UET 6/1 2, is a fragment of what was originally a much longer literary composition. In it, after defeating the Anzû, Ninurta is honored by Enki in Eridu. Enki senses his thoughts and creates a giant turtle, which he releases behind Ninurta and which bites the hero&#x27;s ankle. As they struggle, the turtle digs a pit with its claws, which both of them fall into. Enki gloats over Ninurta&#x27;s defeat. The end of the story is missing; the last legible portion of the account is a lamentation from Ninurta&#x27;s mother Ninmah, who seems to be considering finding a substitute for her son. According to Charles Penglase, in this account, Enki is clearly intended as the hero and his successful foiling of Ninurta&#x27;s plot to seize power for himself is intended as a demonstration of Enki&#x27;s supreme wisdom and cunning.

=== Other myths ===
In &quot;Ninurta&#x27;s Journey to Eridu&quot;, Ninurta leaves the Ekur temple in Nippur and travels to the Abzu in Eridu, led by an unnamed guide. In Eridu, Ninurta sits in assembly with the gods An and Enki and Enki gives him the &quot;me&quot; for life. The poem ends with Ninurta returning to Nippur. The account probably deals with a journey in which Ninurta&#x27;s cult statue was transported from one city to another and the &quot;guide&quot; is the person carrying the cult statue. The story closely resembles the other Sumerian myth of &quot;Inanna and Enki&quot;, in which the goddess Inanna journeys to Eridu and receives the &quot;mes&quot; from Enki. In a poem known as the &quot;Sumerian &quot;Georgica&quot;&quot;, written sometime between 1700 and 1500 BC, Ninurta delivers detailed advice on agricultural matters, including how to plant, tend, and harvest crops, how to prepare fields for planting, and even how to drive birds away from the crops. The poem covers nearly every aspect of farm life throughout the course of the year.

The myth of the &quot;Slain Heroes&quot; is alluded to in many texts, but is never preserved in full. In this myth, Ninurta must fight a variety of opponents. Black and Green describe these opponents as &quot;bizarre minor deities&quot;; they include the six-headed Wild Ram, the Palm Tree King, the seven-headed serpent and the Kulianna the Mermaid (or &quot;fish-woman&quot;). Some of these foes are inanimate objects, such as the Magillum Boat, which carries the souls of the dead to the Underworld, and the strong copper, which represents a metal that was conceived as precious. This story of successive trials and victories may have been the source for the Greek legend of the Twelve Labors of Heracles.

== Later influence ==
===In antiquity===
In the late seventh century BC, Kalhu was captured by foreign invaders. Despite this, Ninurta was never completely forgotten. Many scholars agree that Ninurta was probably the inspiration for the biblical figure Nimrod, mentioned in as a &quot;mighty hunter&quot;. Though it is still not entirely clear how the name &quot;Ninurta&quot; became &quot;Nimrod&quot; in Hebrew, the two figures bear mostly the same functions and attributes and &quot;Ninurta&quot; is currently regarded as the most plausible etymology for Nimrod&#x27;s name. Eventually, the ruins of the city of Kalhu itself became known in Arabic as &quot;Namrūd&quot; because of its association with Ninurta.

Later in the Old Testament, in both and , King Sennacherib of Assyria is reported to have been murdered by his sons Adrammelech and Sharezer in the temple of &quot;Nisroch&quot;, which is most likely a scribal error for &quot;Nimrod&quot;. This hypothetical error would result from the Hebrew letter מ (mem) being replacing with ס (samekh) and the letter ד (dalet) being replaced with ך (kaf). Due to the obvious visual similarities of the letters involved and the fact that no Assyrian deity by the name of &quot;Nisroch&quot; has ever been attested, most scholars consider this error to be the most likely explanation for the name. If &quot;Nisroch&quot; is Ninurta, this would make Ninurta&#x27;s temple at Kalhu the most likely location of Sennacherib&#x27;s murder. Other scholars have attempted to identify Nisroch as Nusku, the Assyrian god of fire. Hans Wildberger rejects all suggested identifications as linguistically implausible.

Although the Book of Genesis itself portrays Nimrod positively as the first king after the Flood of Noah and a builder of cities, the Greek Septuagint translation of the Hebrew Bible refers to him as a giant and mistranslates the Hebrew words meaning &quot;before Yahweh&quot; as &quot;in opposition against God.&quot; Because of this, Nimrod became envisioned as the archetypal idolator. Early works of Jewish &quot;midrash&quot;, described by the first-century AD philosopher Philo in his &quot;Quaestiones&quot;, portrayed Nimrod as the instigator of the building of the Tower of Babel, who persecuted the Jewish patriarch Abraham for refusing to participate in the project. Saint Augustine of Hippo refers to Nimrod in his book &quot;The City of God&quot; as &quot;a deceiver, oppressor and destroyer of earth-born creatures.&quot;

===In modernity===
In the sixteenth century, Nisroch became seen as a demon. The Dutch demonologist Johann Weyer listed Nisroch in his &quot;Pseudomonarchia Daemonum&quot; (1577) as the &quot;chief cook&quot; of Hell. Nisroch appears in Book VI of John Milton&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Paradise Lost&quot; (first published in 1667) as one of Satan&#x27;s demons. Nisroch, who is described as frowning and wearing beaten armor, calls into question Satan&#x27;s argument that the fight between the angels and demons is equal, objecting that they, as demons, can feel pain, which will break their morale. According to Milton scholar Roy Flannagan, Milton may have chosen to portray Nisroch as timid because he had consulted the Hebrew dictionary of C. Stephanus, which defined the name &quot;Nisroch&quot; as &quot;Flight&quot; or &quot;Delicate Temptation&quot;.

In the 1840s, the British archaeologist Austen Henry Layard uncovered numerous stone carvings of winged, eagle-headed genii at Kalhu. Remembering the Biblical story of Sennacherib&#x27;s murder, Layard mistakenly identified these figures as &quot;Nisrochs&quot;. Such carvings continued to be known as &quot;Nisrochs&quot; in popular literature throughout the remaining portion of the nineteenth century. In Edith Nesbit&#x27;s classic 1906 children&#x27;s novel &quot;The Story of the Amulet&quot;, the child protagonists summon an eagle-headed &quot;Nisroch&quot; to guide them. Nisroch opens a portal and advises them, &quot;Walk forward without fear&quot; and asks, &quot;Is there aught else that the Servant of the great Name can do for those who speak that name?&quot; Some modern works on art history still repeat the old misidentification, but Near Eastern scholars now generally refer to the &quot;Nisroch&quot; figure as a &quot;griffin-demon&quot;.

In 2016, during its brief conquest of the region, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) demolished Ashurnasirpal II&#x27;s ziggurat of Ninurta at Kalhu. This act was in line with ISIL&#x27;s longstanding policy of destroying any ancient ruins which it deemed incompatible with its militant interpretation of Islam. According to a statement from the American Schools of Oriental Research (ASOR)&#x27;s Cultural Heritage Initiatives, ISIL may have destroyed the temple to use its destruction for future propaganda and to demoralize the local population.

In March 2020, archaeologists announced the discovery of a 5,000-year-old cultic area filled with more than 300 broken ceremonial ceramic cups, bowls, jars, animal bones and ritual processions dedicated to Ningirsu at the site of Girsu. One of the remains was a duck-shaped bronze figurine with eyes made from bark which is thought to be dedicated to Nanshe.

In February 2023, the E-ninnu temple (Temple of the White Thunderbird), the primary sanctuary of Ningirsu was identified during the excavations led by British Museum and Getty Museum archaeologists at the site of Girsu.

<text>In ancient Mesopotamian religion, Pazuzu () is a demonic deity who was well known to the Babylonians and Assyrians throughout the first millennium BCE. He is shown with &quot;a rather canine face with abnormally bulging eyes, a scaly body, a snake-headed penis, the talons of a bird and usually wings&quot;. He was believed to be the son of the god Hanbi. 

He was usually regarded as evil, but he could also sometimes be a beneficent entity who protected against winds bearing pestilence and he was thought to be able to force Lamashtu back to the underworld. Amulets bearing his image were positioned in dwellings to protect infants from Lamashtu and pregnant women frequently wore amulets with his head on them as protection from her.

As an apotropaic entity, he is considered as both a personification of a destructive and dangerous wind, but also as a repellant to other demons, one who safeguards the home from their influence. In particular he protects pregnant women and mothers, whom he could defend from the machinations of the demoness Lamashtu, his rival. He is invoked in ritual and representations of him are used as defence charms.

==Function==
Pazuzu has two chief aspects. Firstly as a demon of the home, as a domestic spirit, and secondly as the wandering wind demon, traversing the mountains, where he presents a wilder character.

===Pazuzu as domestic protector deity===
There is a well documented use of Pazuzu in Mesopotamian white magic. His inhuman and grotesque form can be inferred to have been used to frighten away unwanted guests, as well as prevent his wind-demon subjects from entering the home and wreaking havoc. His role in ritual and magic is documented on inscriptions on the backs of his statues, or in ritual texts. Spells, incantations, and special artifacts were used to gain the favour and protection of the demon, such artifacts being placed in and around the home, or worn on the person to achieve the desired effect.

====Protective objects====
Large numbers of Pazuzu heads have been discovered, made from a variety of materials, chiefly terracotta, but also bronze, iron, gold, glass, and bone. These heads often feature holes or loops at the top, allowing them to be worn on necklaces by pregnant women in order to protect the baby from evil forces. Occasionally the heads would be attached to cylinder seals or worn as brooches as well. Some of these heads have been found in graves.

Carved amulets are common. Ritual texts from Uruk state that a woman could be given a bronze necklace or amulet of Pazuzu in order to protect her from miscarrying via the interference of Lamashtu. Some are rectangular, showing Pazuzu in either standing or crouching pose. Larger amulets made from stone could be hung on the wall to protect the room or an entrance. One of this type of amulet that was found inside a home in the Neo-Assyrian town of Dur-Katlimmu was lying on the floor of the main reception room and was thought to have been hung on the wall facing the entryway.

Given the number of artifacts uncovered, it can be inferred that Pazuzu enjoyed great popularity, and based upon the uniformity of the heads, amulets, and statues, it has even been speculated that such representations of the demon-god were mass-produced.

====Ritual texts====
Relating to the representations of Pazuzu, text inscriptions on the backs of representations or on tablets would invoke or otherwise mention Pazuzu.

A ritual text from Assyria prescribes a Pazuzu head as a way to banish sickness. Similarly, a ritual incantation against Lamastu from the Late Babylonian Period directs the reader to make a Pazuzu necklace and hang it around the afflicted person&#x27;s neck.

In the bilingual (Sumerian and Akkadian) version of the &quot;Compendia&quot;, Pazuzu identifies himself:

&quot;I am Pazuzu, son of Ḫanbu, king of the evil lilû-demons. I was enraged (in violent motion) against the strong mountains and ascended them.&quot;

Another text also narrated by him describes Pazuzu encountering other lilû demons in his travels, and breaking their wings, therefore preventing them from inflicting harm. &quot;I ascended a mighty mountain that shook, and the (evil) winds I encountered there were heading West; One by one I broke their wings.&quot; In another text he is perceived as more malicious, as the narrator addresses him as &quot;Agony of Mankind&quot;, &quot;Suffering of Mankind&quot;, &quot;Disease of Mankind&quot;, and chants telling the demon to not enter the home.

==Iconography==
According to Eckart Frahm&#x27;s study, the appearance of Pazuzu has remained fairly uniform throughout his history. Pazuzu is depicted as a combination of diverse animal and human parts. His body of canine form, though scaled not furred, with birds&#x27; talons for feet, two pairs of wings, a scorpion&#x27;s tail and a serpentine penis. He holds his right hand up and his left hand down. His face is striking, with gazelle horns, human ears, a doglike muzzle, bulging eyes, and wrinkles on the cheeks.

==Demonic relationships==
===Parents and siblings===
His father is Hanpu, &quot;The staggering one&quot; or &quot;The perverted one&quot;.

===Wind demons===
Lilû (wind) demons are the class to which Pazuzu and his subjects belong.

There is a connection to the earlier Babylonian personifications of The Four Winds. These beings, as depicted on several cylinder seals, have wings, and each represents a different wind direction; South, East, West, and North. Franz Wiggermann calls attention to the crooked positioning of the masculine West Wind in seals, as similar to posture in Pazuzu&#x27;s iconography. More connections appear in later seals, as this same bent-over figure takes on talons and a scorpion&#x27;s tail. The main difference in their depictions is the head, thus Wiggerman concludes that it is Pazuzu&#x27;s body and not his head that denotes him as a wind demon. Another scholar, Scott Noegel, asserts that Pazuzu&#x27;s possession of four wings links to the term &quot;kippatu&quot;, meaning &quot;circle, loop, circumference, and totality&quot;, suggesting his control over all cardinal directions of wind inherited from his predecessors.

===Lamastu===
The baby-snatching Lamastu was attested as both a subject of and an antagonist of Pazuzu. It is theorized that Pazuzu could have been created specifically as a counter to her. Initially she existed as an independent demoness, with no distinct connection to other demons. Then in the Late Bronze Age she took on the lilû demon classification, thus Pazuzu was introduced as a way to chase her from the home and back into the underworld. It does also seem to be that Pazuzu&#x27;s first appearances and Lamastu&#x27;s reassigning as a lilû both originate from the same time and place, the Middle Assyrian Empire, but this could be a coincidence.

On one Lamastu amulet, a scene shows Pazuzu chasing the demoness away from her victim, while another displays him destroying it.

On a Neo-Assyrian bronze plaque, Pazuzu&#x27;s head is perched above the top of the plaque, and a smaller version of him in the scene is chasing Lamastu away down a river. Other protective spirits also appear in the plaque, including apkallu and other animal-headed demons, there to protect the person who is lying down on a bed.

===Bes===
Some scholars believe that Egyptian demon Bes is a counterpart of Pazuzu. Both are known to be protector demons in the home. They have iconographic links: both having lion parts, wings, a distinctly long phallus, and similar facial features. There are noted similarities between the positioning of the two on protective amulets as well. Another close connection is their association with the protection of pregnant women and mothers.

There is evidence that the two were in each other&#x27;s cultural spheres. A possible Pazuzu figure was found in Egypt, as well as Bes amulets uncovered in sites in Iran. In a seventh century era fort in Nimrud, five Pazuzu heads were found near a Bes amulet.

One theory posits a connection in their names - that Bes, like Pazuzu, could have been derived from the king name Bazi - although Pazuzu&#x27;s name has not yet been proven to have originated from Bazi, nor, it is speculated, has Bes&#x27;s name been proven to be of foreign origin.

===Other protective demons===
On some amulets, Pazuzu appears alongside Ugallu and Lulal, protective deities who were thought to solely benefit mankind thus their presences here may be apotropaic, or deployed to minimise Pazuzu&#x27;s maleficent aspect. Their common positioning on the back of the amulet out of sight of the viewer could suggest the latter. They have also been present on the back of half-relief Pazuzu heads, again out of sight.

==Mythology==
Pazuzu is the god of the southwestern wind and is associated with the plague. Pazuzu was invoked in apotropaic amulets, which combat the powers of his rival, the malicious goddess Lamashtu, who was believed to cause harm to mother and child during childbirth. He would protect humans against any variety of misfortune or plague.

==History==
According to Wiggermann, the Pazuzu figure suddenly appeared in the Early Iron Age. His first visual depictions are not attested until the 8th century BC with the first finds being in the tombs of Nimrud, and his first appearances in texts trace to the 7th century BC. The majority of his representations were found in the 7th and 6th centuries BCE, with the most recent finds dating back to the time of the Seleucid Empire.

===Name===
One speculation for the origin of the name of Pazuzu connects to Bazi, as named in the Tell Leilan version of the Sumerian King List, who was a king of Mari. The name is followed by that of the succeeding king, Zizi. Bazi&#x27;s name is preceded by Anbu, his father, who was suspected to have inspired the god Anbu, which later conflated into Hanbu, Pazuzu&#x27;s father. The theory goes that, given the connection between Anbu and Hanbu, it could be that the name Pazuzu is a construction of the following kings names: Ba-zi-Zi-zi.

Like Pazuzu, Humbaba was used as a protector deity, with depictions of his frightening head being used to ward off evil. It could therefore be speculated that the Pazuzu heads replaced those of Humbaba. Humbaba fell from favour in the Late Bronze Age, shortly before Pazuzu emerged, although the two do not share any great iconographic connection, making it unlikely that Pazuzu could have evolved from the earlier deity.

Another speculation is that rather than Bes and Pazuzu having a common origin point, Pazuzu was an offshoot of Bes.

==In popular culture==
Pazuzu is most famous in western popular culture due to the 1971 novel &quot;The Exorcist&quot; and its 1973 film adaptation &quot;The Exorcist&quot;. In both instances, Pazuzu is the evil spirit that possesses the young girl Regan MacNeil.

<doc id="249352" wikidata="Q2586475" url="?curid=249352" title="Rabisu">
<text>In Akkadian mythology the Rabisu (&quot;the lurker&quot;; Sumerian Maškim, &quot;deputy, attorney&quot;), or possibly Rabasa, are vampiric spirits, daimons, or demons. The Rabisu are associated in mythology with the Curse of Akkad. A consistent translation of &quot;Rabisu&quot; is “Lingerers”. The Rabisu, whether intending malicious actions or not, linger around those who have been found wayward or to be rewarded by the deity Enlil.

==History of Scholarship==
The reason some people may feel as though Rabisu (Akkadian) or Robes (Hebrew) is an evil spirit or evil demon can be attributed to a series of books published in 1903-1904. Assyriologist Reginald Campbell Thompson published the seventeenth volume of &quot;Cuneiform Texts from Babylonian Tablets&quot; and a two-volume series &quot;Devils and Evil Spirits of Babylonia&quot;. In both of these works, the Rabisu is denoted as an evil spirit. However, this caused substantive debate and is still contested by scholars today. In 1903, the claim that the Rabisu was an evil demon spirit was contested by Hans Duhm in &quot;Die bösen Geister im Alten Testament&quot; in which he, along with Assyriologist Charles-Francois Jean were able to compare Hebrew texts to Akkadian demonology to attest that the Rabisu was not a predatory being. In this literature, despite the assertion that the Rabisu was not evil, the entity was still referred to as a &quot;demon&quot; in some classifications. Some have stuck to this notion without question. However, Duhm’s assertion has been challenged from multiple angles. Others who interpreted the Hebrew Bible also reached a separate conclusion that Rovetz (&quot;lurking, crouching&quot; in Hebrew) is not the same entity or in some cases not even the same religion as the spirit of the Rabisu (Akkadian Demon).

One of the main reasons people often mistake the Rabisu to be intrinsically evil is because of modern connotations of the word &quot;demon&quot;. In ancient theology, a daimon had both an intrinsically evil and intrinsically good dichotomy. In vernacular usage, &quot;demon&quot; is often assumed to be evil or malicious. However this is a linguistic artifact. It is also understood by modern translation that Rabisu did not act without divine authority. That is, unless Enlil and his heavenly counsel specifically told or commanded the Rabisu to do something, they would not. Rather, they remained neutral spirits existing between the planes of heaven and earth.

==Rabisu in the Bible==
The book &quot;The Religion of Babylonia and Assyria&quot; by Theophilus Pinches describes the Rabisu as being &quot;the seizer&quot; which is &quot;regarded as a spirit which lay in wait to pounce upon his prey&quot;.

 read:

The New American Bible translates this as

and adds as a footnote:
It is possible that this displays a continued tradition in the emerging culture of the Hebrews.

Rabisu is listed in the rituals of Šurpu which have to do with burning, such as the symbolic burning of witches. The Shurpu ritual allows the banishment of Rabisu described as &quot;a demon that springs unawares on its victims&quot;.

==Nature of the Rabisu==
The spirit identified by the Akkadians as “Rabisu” is not an inherently evil spirit. Despite the Hebrew Bible referring to demons as evil by nature, the demonology expressed by the Akkadians suggests that Rabisu, rather than being an entity of evil, was an entity with no particular moral implications. Rather, the Rabisu was a spirit sent out to correct the transgressions committed by humans. “In Gen 4:7, Robes, which is routinely thought to denote a demon [in which] Akkadian texts indicate that the rabisu is a neutral being that is nothing other than a current of wind dispatched by the deities to perform certain duties”. When one refers to the spirit of the Rabisu as an evil entity (Evil Rabisu) it may be better interpreted as reference to malicious action performed by the Rabisu in response to the wayward actions of an afflicted human. That is, the malicious event does not reflect the Rabisu spirit as a whole.

The Sumerian and Akkadian deity, Enlil, a major god of the earth, sky, atmosphere and storms is the sender of the “windy beings” known as Rabisu. The Rabisu, rather than acting as predatory demons with their own malicious will, were more like links between the divine beings of Heaven and the Earth. In mythology, Enlil sent the spirit of the Rabisu as a sort of messenger. Whether the message entailed good or bad things for the receiver was not a reflection upon the Rabisu but rather the consequence of human actions, which themselves were of different moral character.

==The Curse of Agade==
The myth of the Curse of Akkad can now be understood with this context. The Curse of Akkad, or more correctly The Curse of Agade, is a story told by Sumerians during the Third Dynasty of Ur (2047-1750BCE) about the Akkadian king Naram-Sin who was the grandson and successor of Sargon the Great. Sometimes the Curse of Agade is described as Naram-Sin’s fight with Enlil. Naram-Sin had grown discontent with himself and blamed the gods for not providing relief from his sorrows. Naram-Sin took up arms against Enlil who, in turn, sent the Rabisu to correct Naram-Sin’s transgressions. The story of the Curse of Agade ends with the complete destruction of the city of Akkad, Enlil triumphing over the earthly human domain.

==Similarity to a Myth of Ubar==
The story of the Curse of Agade is similar to a myth of the &quot;lost city&quot; of Ubar, sometimes referred to as &quot;Atlantis of the Sands,&quot; located farther to the south in southeastern Oman. The Rabisu were noted to operate as a flock or unit, as opposed to individual spirits. It was believed that Enlil would send “flocks&quot; of Rabisu in the form of storms of wind, sometimes carrying dust or sand storms. In one tablet from the Akkadian Empire, the author records that “A disfavorable storm arose against the land. It disturbed the people of the upper and lower territory… the awful storm, the (great) storm, that will neither be returned to the steppe-land, nor look back… Cities offer no protection, for such beings borne on the wind are able to penetrate the urban landscape. They pursue people. They invade dwellings and buildings.” This story is nearly identical to a myth that refers to Ubar in which the gods, having grown angry with the residents of Ubar, struck it down in a great storm in which sand entirely engulfed the city and all its people.

==Defeating the Rabisu==
In mythology, the Rabisu, though believed to hold no moral implications, were often opposed by hero figures. In Sumerian texts, the hero is named Hendursanga, roughly translated as “Watchman of the Night.” Other translations include “Isums” which is interpretated as “Herald of the Gods, Watchman of the Streets” (University of Chicago Press 3).

==In Modern Literature and Popular Culture==
In the 1977 grimoire &quot;Simon Necronomicon&quot; by Peter Levenda, which draws upon a blend of real myths including Sumerian and fictional creations, Rabisu are described as ancient demons. It talks about the god Marduk who battled Tiamat, Kingu, and Azag-Thoth. In the book, among the fifty Names of Marduk is the name Nariluggaldimmerankia, which is the sixth. Nariluggaldimmerankia is said to be the sub-commander of wind demons. He is described as the foe of Rabisu and all &quot;maskim&quot; who haunt humans. Marduk&#x27;s seventh name, Asaruludu, is said to have the power using his sacred word Banmaskim to banish all Maškim (a.k.a. Rabisu).

Myths of the Rabiru as lingerers or lurkers may have inspired the title of &quot;The Lurker at the Threshold&quot; a horror novel by August Derleth.

In 2021, Supermassive Games released House of Ashes, an interactive drama horror video game set during the invasion of Iraq in 2003. A squad of American Marines find themselves trapped in an ancient Mesopotamian temple after a raid on a local village in search of weapons goes awry. Concurrently, bat-like vampiric creatures awaken from their millennia-long slumber to roam the temple and stalk and terrorize their newfound human prey.

<text>Sleepwalking, also known as somnambulism or noctambulism, is a phenomenon of combined sleep and wakefulness. It is classified as a sleep disorder belonging to the parasomnia family. It occurs during the slow wave stage of sleep, in a state of low consciousness, with performance of activities that are usually performed during a state of full consciousness. These activities can be as benign as talking, sitting up in bed, walking to a bathroom, consuming food, and cleaning, or as hazardous as cooking, driving a motor vehicle, violent gestures and grabbing at hallucinated objects.

Although sleepwalking cases generally consist of simple, repeated behaviors, there are occasionally reports of people performing complex behaviors while asleep, although their legitimacy is often disputed. Sleepwalkers often have little or no memory of the incident, as their consciousness has altered into a state in which memories are difficult to recall. Although their eyes are open, their expression is dim and glazed over. This may last from 30 seconds to 30 minutes.

Sleepwalking occurs during slow-wave sleep (N3) of non-rapid eye movement sleep (NREM sleep) cycles. It typically occurs within the first third of the night when slow-wave sleep is most prominent. Usually, it will occur once in a night, if at all.

== Signs and symptoms==
Sleepwalking is characterized by:

* partial arousal during non-rapid eye movement (NREM) sleep, typically during the first third of the night
* dreamy content that may or may not be recalled when awake
* dream-congruent motor behavior that may be simple or complex
* impaired perception of the environment
* impaired judgement, planning and problem-solving.

Despite how it is portrayed in many cultures (eyes closed and walking with arms outstretched), the sleepwalker&#x27;s eyes are open but may appear as a glassy-eyed stare or blank expression and pupils are dilated. They are often disoriented, consequent to awakening: the sleepwalker may be confused and perplexed, and might not know why or how they got out of bed; however, the disorientation will fade within minutes. They may talk while sleepwalking, but the talk typically does not make sense to the observer. There are varying degrees of amnesia associated with sleepwalking, ranging from no memory at all, vague memories or a narrative.

===Associated disorders ===
Most studies look at sleep disorders in adults but children can also be affected. In the ten percent of the population that experience sleep-related disorders, children are mainly affected due to their youthful brains. A study conducted in Australia, looked at sleepwalking and its association with sleep behaviors in children. It was found that sleepwalking could be associated with children&#x27;s bedtime routines. Those who have behavioral problems are more likely to develop a sleep disorder and should be assessed. The relationship between sleepwalking and the behavioral and emotional problems are more associated than their bedtime routines. This may very well be because sleep related disorders and sleepwalking happen simultaneously; one cannot exist without the other.

In the study &quot;Sleepwalking and Sleep Terrors in Prepubertal Children&quot; it was found that, if a child had another sleep disordersuch as restless leg syndrome (RLS) or sleep-disorder breathing (SDB)there was a greater chance of sleepwalking. The study found that children with chronic parasomnias may often also present SDB or, to a lesser extent, RLS. Furthermore, the disappearance of the parasomnias after the treatment of the SDB or RLS periodic limb movement syndrome suggests that the latter may trigger the former. The high frequency of SDB in family members of children with parasomnia provided additional evidence that SDB may manifest as parasomnias in children. Children with parasomnias are not systematically monitored during sleep, although past studies have suggested that patients with sleep terrors or sleepwalking have an elevated level of brief EEG arousals. When children receive polysomnographies, discrete patterns (e.g., nasal flow limitation, abnormal respiratory effort, bursts of high or slow EEG frequencies) should be sought; apneas are rarely found in children. Children&#x27;s respiration during sleep should be monitored with nasal cannula or pressure transducer system or esophageal manometry, which are more sensitive than the thermistors or thermocouples currently used in many laboratories. The clear, prompt improvement of severe parasomnia in children who are treated for SDB, as defined here, provides important evidence that subtle SDB can have substantial health-related significance. Also noteworthy is the report of familial presence of parasomnia. Studies of twin cohorts and families with sleep terror and sleepwalking suggest genetic involvement of parasomnias. RLS and SDB have been shown to have familial recurrence. RLS has been shown to have genetic involvement.

Sleepwalking may also accompany the related phenomenon of night terrors, especially in children. In the midst of a night terror, the affected person may wander in a distressed state while still asleep, and examples of sufferers attempting to run or aggressively defend themselves during these incidents have been reported in medical literature.

In some cases, sleepwalking in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder. One study suggests higher levels of dissociation in adult sleepwalkers, since test subjects scored unusually high on the hysteria portion of the &quot;Crown-Crisp Experiential Index&quot;. Another suggested that &quot;A higher incidence [of sleepwalking events] has been reported in patients with schizophrenia, hysteria and anxiety neuroses&quot;. Also, patients with migraine headaches or Tourette syndrome are 4–6 times more likely to sleepwalk.

===Consequences===
During the amnesic state sleepwalkers are in, many things can happen without their recollection. One thing that can happen is a sleep disorder called sexomnia, where an individual can engage in sexual behaviors with oneself or others. Its occurrence is rare, but can happen during sleepwalking. Sleep-related eating disorder, in which sleepwalkers eat involuntarily, can also happen. The events can include eating/drinking regular foods or odd combinations of food. Insomnia and daytime sleepiness can also occur. Most sleepwalkers get injuries at some point during sleepwalking, often minor injuries such as cuts or bruises. In rare occasions, however, sleepwalkers have fractured bones and died as the result of a fall. Sleepwalkers may also face embarrassment of being found naked in public.

==Causes==
The cause of sleepwalking is unknown. A number of, as yet unproven, hypotheses are suggested for why it might occur, including: delay in the maturity of the central nervous system, increased slow wave sleep, sleep deprivation, fever, and excessive tiredness. There may be a genetic component to sleepwalking. One study found that sleepwalking occurred in 45% of children who have one parent who sleepwalked, and in 60% of children if both parents sleepwalked. Thus, heritable factors may predispose an individual to sleepwalking, but expression of the behavior may also be influenced by environmental factors. Genetic studies using common fruit flies as experimental models reveal a link between night sleep and brain development mediated by evolutionary conserved transcription factors such as AP-2 Sleepwalking may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance. Genome-wide multipoint parametric linkage analysis for sleepwalking revealed a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 3.14 at chromosome 20q12-q13.12 between 55.6 and 61.4 cM.

Sleepwalking has been hypothesized to be linked to the neurotransmitter serotonin, which also appears to be metabolized differently in migraine patients and people with Tourette syndrome, both populations being four to nine times more likely to experience an episode of sleepwalking. Hormonal fluctuations have been found to contribute to sleepwalking episodes in women, with the likeliness to sleepwalk being higher before the onset of menstruation. It also appears that hormonal changes during pregnancy decrease the likelihood of engaging in sleepwalking.

Medications, primarily in four classes—benzodiazepine receptor agonists and other GABA modulators, antidepressants and other serotonergic agents, antipsychotics, and β-blockers—have been associated with sleepwalking. The best evidence of medications causing sleepwalking is for zolpidem and sodium oxybate; all other reports are based on associations noted in case reports.

A number of conditions, such as Parkinson&#x27;s disease, are thought to trigger sleepwalking in people without a previous history of sleepwalking.

==Diagnosis==
Polysomnography is the only accurate assessment of a sleepwalking episode. Because this is costly and sleepwalking episodes are usually infrequent, other measures commonly used include self-, parent-, or partner-report. Three common diagnostic systems that are generally used for sleepwalking disorders are International Classification of Diseases (ICD-10), the International Classification of Sleep Disorders (ICSD-3), and the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual.

The Diagnostic and Statistical Manual defines two subcategories of sleepwalking, although sleepwalking does not need to involve either behaviours:

* sleepwalking with sleep-related eating.
* sleepwalking with sleep-related sexual behavior (sexsomnia).

Sleep eating involves consuming food while asleep. These sleep eating disorders are more often than not induced for stress related reasons. Another major cause of this sleep eating subtype of sleepwalking is sleep medication, such as Ambien for example (Mayo Clinic). There are a few others, but Ambien is a more widely used sleep aid. Because many sleep eaters prepare the food they consume, there are risks involving burns and such with ovens and other appliances. As expected, weight gain is also a common outcome of this disorder, because food that is frequently consumed contains high carbohydrates. As with sleepwalking, there are ways that sleep eating disorders can be maintained. There are some medications that calm the sleeper so they can get longer and better-quality rest, but activities such as yoga can also be introduced to reduce the stress and anxiety causing the action.

=== Differential diagnoses ===
Sleepwalking should not be confused with alcohol- or drug-induced blackouts, which can result in amnesia for events similar to sleepwalking. During an alcohol-induced blackout (drug-related amnesia), a person is able to actively engage and respond to their environment (e.g. having conversations or driving a vehicle), however the brain does not create memories for the events. Alcohol-induced blackouts can occur with blood alcohol levels higher than 0.06 g/dl. A systematic review of the literature found that approximately 50% of drinkers have experienced memory loss during a drinking episode and have had associated negative consequences similar to sleepwalkers, including injury and death.

Other differential diagnoses include rapid eye movement sleep behavior disorder, confusional arousals, and night terrors.

=== Assessment ===
An assessment of sleepwalking via polysomnography poses the problem that sleepwalking is less likely to occur in the sleep laboratory, and if an episode occurs, it is usually less complex than what the patient experiences at home. Therefore, the diagnosis can often be made by assessment of sleep history, time-course and content of the sleep related behaviors. Sometimes, home videos can provide additional information and should be considered in the diagnostic process.

Some features that should always be assessed include:

* Age of onset
* When the episode occurs during the sleep period
* How often these episodes occur (frequency) and how long they last (duration)
* Description of the episode, including behavior, emotions, and thoughts during and after the event
* How responsive the patient is to external stimuli during the episode
* How conscious or aware the patient is, when awakened from an episode
* If the episode is remembered afterwards
* The triggers or precipitating factors
* Sleep–wake pattern and sleep environment
* Daytime sleepiness
* Other sleep disorders that might be present
* Family history for NREM parasomnias and other sleep disorders
* Medical, psychiatric, and neurological history
* Medication and substance use history
The assessment should rule out differential diagnoses.

==Treatment==
There have been no clinical trials to show that any psychological or pharmacological intervention is effective in preventing sleepwalking episodes. Despite this, a wide range of treatments have been used with sleepwalkers. Psychological interventions have included psychoanalysis, hypnosis, scheduled or anticipatory waking, assertion training, relaxation training, managing aggressive feelings, sleep hygiene, classical conditioning (including electric shock), and play therapy. Pharmacological treatments have included tricyclic antidepressants (imipramine), an anticholinergic (biperiden), antiepileptics (carbamazepine, valproate), an antipsychotic (quetiapine), benzodiazepines (clonazepam, diazepam, flurazepam and triazolam), melatonin, a selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (paroxetine), a barbiturate (sodium amytal) and herbs.

There is no evidence to show that waking sleepwalkers is harmful or not, though the sleepwalker is likely to be disoriented if awakened.

Unlike other sleep disorders, sleepwalking is not associated with daytime behavioral or emotional problems. This may be because the sleepwalker&#x27;s sleep is not disturbed—unless they are woken, they are still in a sleep state while sleepwalking.

Maintaining the safety of the sleepwalker and others and seeking treatment for other sleep problems is recommended. Reassurance is recommended if sleepwalking is not causing any problems. However, if it causes distress or there is risk of harm, hypnosis and scheduled waking are recommended as treatments.

=== Safety planning ===
For those whose sleepwalking episodes are hazardous, a door alarm may offer a measure of protection. There are various kinds of door alarms that can attach to a bedroom door and when the door is opened, the alarm sounds. The intention is that the sound will fully awaken the person and interrupt the sleepwalking episode, or if the sleepwalker lives with others, the sound will prompt them to check on the person.

Sleepwalkers should aim to have their bedrooms on the ground floor of a home, apartment, dorm, hotel, etc.

Sleepwalkers should not have easily accessible weapons (loaded guns, knives) in the bedroom or any room of the house for that matter. If there are weapons, they should be locked away with keys secluded from the sleepwalker.

For partners of sleepwalkers who are violent or disturb their sleep, sleeping in another room may lead to better sleep quality and quantity.

==Epidemiology==
The lifetime prevalence of sleepwalking is estimated to be 4.6–10.3%. A meta-analysis of 51 studies, that included more than 100,000 children and adults, found that sleepwalking is more common in children with an estimated 5%, compared with 1.5% of adults, sleepwalking at least once in the previous 12 months. The rate of sleepwalking has not been found to vary across ages during childhood.

==History==
Sleepwalking has attracted a sense of mystery, but was not seriously investigated and diagnosed until the 19th century. The German chemist and parapsychologist Baron Karl Ludwig von Reichenbach (1788–1869) made extensive studies of sleepwalkers and used his discoveries to formulate his theory of the Odic force.

Sleepwalking was initially thought to be a dreamer acting out a dream. For example, in one study published by the Society for Science &amp; the Public in 1954, this was the conclusion: &quot;Repression of hostile feelings against the father caused the patients to react by acting out in a dream world with sleepwalking, the distorted fantasies they had about all authoritarian figures, such as fathers, officers and stern superiors.&quot; This same group published an article twelve years later with a new conclusion: &quot;Sleepwalking, contrary to most belief, apparently has little to do with dreaming. In fact, it occurs when the sleeper is enjoying his most oblivious, deepest sleep—a stage in which dreams are not usually reported.&quot; More recent research has discovered that sleepwalking is actually a disorder of NREM (non-rapid eye movement) arousal. Acting out a dream is the basis for a REM (rapid eye movement) sleep disorder called REM Behavior Disorder (or REM Sleep Behavior Disorder). More accurate data about sleep is due to the invention of technologies, such as the electroencephalogram (EEG) by Hans Berger in 1924 and BEAM by Frank Duffy in the early 1980s.

In 1907, Sigmund Freud spoke about sleepwalking to the Vienna Psychoanalytic Society (Nunberg and Federn). He believed that sleepwalking was connected to fulfilling sexual wishes and was surprised that a person could move without interrupting their dream. At that time, Freud suggested that the essence of this phenomenon was the desire to go to sleep in the same area as the individual had slept in childhood. Ten years later, he speculated about somnambulism in the article &quot;A Metapsychological Supplement to the Theory of Dreams&quot; (1916–17 [1915]). In this essay, he clarified and expanded his hypothetical ideas on dreams. He described the dream as a fragile equilibrium that is destabilized by the repressed unconscious impulses of the unconscious system, which does not obey the wishes of the ego. Certain preconscious daytime thoughts can be resistant and these can retain a part of their cathexis as well. Unconscious impulses and day residues can come together and result in a conflict. Freud then wondered about the outcome of this wishful impulse: an unconscious instinctual demand that becomes a dream wish in the preconscious. Freud stated that this unconscious impulse could be expressed as mobility during sleep. This would be what is observed in somnambulism, though what actually makes it possible remains unknown.

As of 2002, sleepwalking has not been detected in non-human primates.
It is unclear whether it simply has not been observed yet, or whether sleepwalking is a uniquely human phenomenon.

==Culture==
===Opera===

Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s 1831 Italian opera semiseria, La sonnambula, the plot of which is centered on the question of the innocence of the betrothed and soon-to-be married Amina, who, upon having been discovered in the bedchamber of a stranger, and despite the assurances of that stranger that Amina was entirely innocent, has been rejected by her enraged fiancé, Elvino—who, then, decides to marry another. In fact, when stressed, Amina was susceptible to somnambulism; and had come to be in the stranger&#x27;s bedchamber by sleep-walking along a high parapet (in full view of the opera&#x27;s audience). Elvino, who later observes the (exhausted by all the fuss) Amina, sleep-walking across a very high, very unstable, and very rickety bridge at the local mill, realizes his mistake, abandons his plans of marriage to the other woman, and re-unites with Amina.

====Jenny Lind and James Braid====
In August 1847, the famous soprano Jenny Lind visited Manchester, and gave two performances as Amina. The outstanding difference between Lind and her contemporaries was that, &quot;whilst the beauty of her voice was far greater than any other in living memory (thus, the &quot;Swedish Nightingale&quot;), what really set her apart was her outstanding ability to act&quot;; and, moreover, in performing as Amina, rather than walking along a wide and well-protected walkway (as the others did), she routinely acrobatically balanced her way along narrow planks.

While she was in Manchester—on the basis that, at the time, many characterized &quot;&quot;hypnotism&quot; as &quot;artificial somnambulism&quot;&quot;, and that, from a rather different perspective, her stage performance could also be described as one of &quot;artificial&quot; (rather than spontaneous) somnambulism—her friends arranged for her to visit the local surgeon James Braid, who had discovered hypnotism in 1841:

===Drama===
* The sleepwalking scene (Act V Scene 1) from William Shakespeare&#x27;s tragic play &quot;Macbeth&quot; (1606) is one of the most famous scenes in all of literature.
* In Walley Chamberlain Oulton&#x27;s two act farce &quot;The Sleep-Walker; or, Which is the Lady&quot; (1812), &quot;Somno&quot;, a histrionic failed-actor-turned-manservant relives his wished-for roles when sleepwalking.

===Literature===
* In Bram Stoker&#x27;s novel &quot;Dracula&quot;, the character Lucy Westenra is described as a sleepwalker. It is while she is sleepwalking that Count Dracula lures and attacks her.

==Sleepwalking as a legal defense==

As sleepwalking behaviours occur without volition, sleepwalking can be used as a legal defense, as a form of legal automatism. An individual can be accused of non-insane or insane automatism. The first is used as a defense for temporary insanity or involuntary conduct, resulting in acquittal. The latter results in a &quot;special verdict of not guilty by reason of insanity.&quot; This verdict of insanity can result in a court order to attend a mental institution.

In the 1963 case &quot;Bratty v A-G for Northern Ireland&quot;, Lord Morris stated, &quot;Each set of facts must require a careful examination of its own circumstances, but if by way of taking an illustration it were considered possible for a person to walk in his sleep and to commit a violent crime while genuinely unconscious, then such a person would not be criminally liable for that act.&quot; While the veracity of the cases are disputed, there have been acts of homicide where the prime suspect may have committed the act while sleepwalking.

Alternative explanations to homicidal or violent sleepwalking include malingering, drug-induced amnesia, and other disorders in which sleep-related violence may occur, such as REM Sleep Behavior Disorder, fugue states, and episodic wandering.

=== Historical cases ===
* 1846, Albert Tirrell used sleepwalking as a defense against charges of murdering Maria Bickford, a prostitute living in a Boston brothel.
* 1961, Sergeant Willis Boshears confessed to strangling a local woman named Jean Constable in the early hours on New Years Day 1961, but claimed that he was asleep and only woke to realize what he had done. He pled not guilty on the basis of being asleep at the time he committed the offence and was acquitted.
* In 1981, Steven Steinberg of Scottsdale, Arizona was accused of killing his wife and acquitted on the grounds of temporary insanity.
* 1991, &quot;R v Burgess&quot;: Burgess was accused of hitting his girlfriend on the head with a wine bottle and then a video tape recorder. He was found not guilty at Bristol Crown Court, by reason of &quot;insane automatism&quot;.

<text>Henry Beaufort, 3rd Duke of Somerset (26 January 143615 May 1464) was an important Lancastrian military commander during the English Wars of the Roses. He is sometimes numbered the 2nd Duke of Somerset, because the title was re-created for his father after his uncle died. He also held the subsidiary titles of 5th Earl of Somerset, 2nd Marquess of Dorset and 2nd Earl of Dorset.

==Biography==
Somerset, born about January 1436, was the son of Edmund Beaufort, 2nd Duke of Somerset, and Eleanor, daughter of Richard Beauchamp, 13th Earl of Warwick and widow of Thomas, fourteenth baron Roos of Hamlake. From 1443 to 1448 Henry was styled Count of Mortain or Morteign, and from 1448 to 1455 Earl of Dorset. While still a youth he fought at the First Battle of St Albans (1455), where he was wounded and his father was killed; thereby he inherited the title of 3rd Duke of Somerset.

He was regarded as &quot;the hope of the [Lancastrian] party&quot;, but he also inherited the &quot;enmities entailed upon him by his father&#x27;s name&quot;. He was brought to the council at Coventry, where in October 1456 an effort was made to reconcile the two parties; but the meeting was disturbed by quarrels between Somerset and Richard Neville, 16th Earl of Warwick, and by a brawl between Somerset&#x27;s men and the town watch of Coventry. In 1457 Queen Margaret of Anjou suggested a marriage between Somerset and his cousin Joan, sister of James II of Scotland, but the proposal came to nothing. On 14 October of that year Somerset was made lieutenant of the Isle of Wight and warden of Carisbrooke Castle. Early in 1458 he took part in the council at London which again endeavoured to effect a political reconciliation, and it was agreed that Richard, Duke of York should pay the widowed Duchess of Somerset and her children an annual pension of five thousand marks as compensation for the death of the 2nd Duke. He then participated in The Love Day with the King, Queen and other leading nobles.

The truce, however, was hollow; Margaret continued to intrigue against York, and in October 1458 proposed that Somerset should be appointed captain of Calais in place of Warwick. War broke out in 1459, and Somerset nearly encountered Warwick at Coleshill just before the Battle of Blore Heath. After the defeat of Lancastrians at Blore Heath and before the Lancastrian victory at Ludford Bridge, he was on 9 October nominated captain of Calais. He crossed the Channel and was refused admittance to Calais by Warwick&#x27;s adherents, but made himself master of the outlying fortress of Guisnes (appointing Andrew Trollope its bailiff). Somerset fought several skirmishes with the Yorkists between Calais and Guisnes until on 23 April 1460 he suffered a decisive reverse at the Battle of Newnham Bridge (called &quot;Pont de Neullay&quot; by the French).

During his absence the Yorkists had won the Battle of Northampton, but Somerset joined the Lancastrians at Pontefract in December 1460, captured a portion of the Yorkist forces at Worksop on 21 December, and won the Lancastrian victory at the Battle of Wakefield on 30 December. He marched south with Margaret and fought at the Second Battle of St Albans (17 February 1461). This second victory was not followed up; the Lancastrians retired north, and on 29 March Edward IV won the Battle of Towton (29 March 1461). Somerset escaped from the battlefield, and in the following July was sent by Margaret to seek aid from Charles VII of France. Charles died before their arrival, but Louis XI summoned Somerset to Tours and sent him back in March 1462 laden with promises of support, but with very little else.

Somerset now began to consider making his peace with Edward IV. He had been attainted by parliament on 4 November 1461, and most of his lands had been granted to Edward&#x27;s brother Richard, Duke of Gloucester and other Yorkists. On his return from France he took command of the Lancastrian forces in Scotland while Margaret went to France, and in the autumn of 1462 he was holding Bamburgh Castle for the Lancastrians. On 24 December, however, he and Sir Ralph Percy, the Governor of Bamburgh Castle, surrendered the castle and submitted to King Edward. The king took him to London, and treated him with marked favour. He received a general pardon on 10 March 1462/1463, and was restored to his dignities by act of the parliament which met on 29 April following.

Somerset, however, soon returned to his old allegiance. Early in 1464 he escaped from Holt Castle in North Wales, where he seems to have been kept in some sort of confinement, and after nearly being recaptured made his way to Margaret on the borders. The Lancastrians now made one more effort to recover the crown, but at the Battle of Hexham on 15 May 1464 they were utterly defeated by John Neville, 1st Marquess of Montagu. Somerset was captured in a barn at the site of what is now known as Dukes House, and beheaded shortly afterwards that same day. He was buried at Hexham Abbey. Parliament annulled the act restoring him to his dignities, which again became forfeit and were never restored. Somerset was unmarried, and his younger brother, Edmund Beaufort, was styled 4th Duke of Somerset by the Lancastrians.

In 1485, some twenty-one years after his death, Somerset, along with Jasper Tudor, had all acts of attainder against him annulled in the first Parliament of Henry VII, &quot;for their true and faithfull Allegeaunces and Services doune to the said blessed King Herrie [VI].&quot;

==Character==
Somerset was described by Chastellain as &quot;un très grand seigneur et un des plus beaulx josnes chevaliers qui fust au royaume anglais&quot; (&quot;A very great lord and one of the most handsome knights in the English kingdom&quot;). 

==Illegitimate progeny==
By his mistress Joan Hill he had an illegitimate son:
*Charles Somerset, 1st Earl of Worcester, 1st Baron Herbert (c.1460-1526), KG, who was given the surname &quot;Somerset&quot; and was created Baron Herbert in 1506 and Earl of Worcester in 1513. From him descend the Earls and Marquesses of Worcester and the Dukes of Beaufort, who are the last known surviving male-line descendants of King Henry II (1154-1189) of England, Count of Anjou, founder of the Plantagenet dynasty, of which King Richard III (1483-1485) was the last ruling member in the male line.
