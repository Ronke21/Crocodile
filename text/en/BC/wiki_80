<text>The Sino-French War, also known as the Tonkin War, was a limited conflict fought from August 1884 to April 1885 between the French Third Republic and Qing China for influence in Vietnam. There was no declaration of war.

The Chinese armies performed better than in their other nineteenth-century wars. Although French forces emerged victorious from most engagements, the Chinese scored noteworthy successes on land, notably forcing the French to hastily withdraw from occupied Lạng Sơn in the late stages of the war, thus gaining control of the town and its surroundings. However, a lack of foreign support, French naval supremacy, and northern threats posed by Russia and Japan forced China to enter negotiations.

China ceded to France its sphere of influence over Northern and Central Vietnam, which respectively became the protectorates of Tonkin and Annam. Both sides ratified the Treaty of Tientsin and no diplomatic gain was reaped by either nation. On another note, the war strengthened the dominance of Empress Dowager Cixi over the Chinese government but France securing its strategic objective did not prevent the collapse of French Prime Minister Jules Ferry&#x27;s government for whom the Tonkin Affair was ignominious.

== Prelude ==
French interest in northern Vietnam dated from the late 18th century, when the political Catholic priest Pigneau de Behaine recruited French volunteers to fight for Nguyễn Ánh and help begin the Nguyễn dynasty, in an attempt to gain privileges for France and for the Roman Catholic Church. France began its colonial campaign in 1858, annexing several southern provinces in 1862 to form the colony of Cochinchina.

French explorers followed the course of the Red River through northern Vietnam to its source in Yunnan, arousing hopes for a profitable trade route with China that could bypass the treaty ports of the Chinese coastal provinces. The main obstacle to this idea, the Black Flag Army – a well-organized private army led by the formidable Liu Yongfu – was levying exorbitant &quot;taxes&quot; on Red River trade between Sơn Tây and Lào Cai on the Yunnan border.

In 1873, a small French force commanded by Lieutenant de Vaisseau Francis Garnier, exceeding his instructions, attacked northern Vietnam. Following a series of French victories against the Vietnamese, the Vietnamese government called on Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Black Flags, who defeated Garnier&#x27;s force beneath the walls of Hanoi. Garnier was killed in this battle, and the French government later disavowed his expedition.

=== Henri Rivière&#x27;s expedition in Tonkin ===

In 1881, French Commandant Henri Rivière was sent with a small military force to Hanoi to investigate Vietnamese complaints about the activities of French merchants. In defiance of the instructions of his superiors, Rivière stormed the citadel of Hanoi on 25 April 1882. Although Rivière subsequently returned the citadel to Vietnamese control, his recourse to force provoked alarm both in Vietnam and in China.

The Vietnamese government, unable to confront Rivière with its own ramshackle army, once again enlisted the help of Liu Yongfu, whose well-trained and seasoned Black Flag soldiers would prove a thorn in the side of the French. The Vietnamese also sought for Chinese support. Vietnam had long been a tributary state of China, and China agreed to arm and support the Black Flags, and to covertly oppose French operations in Tonkin.

The Qing court also sent a strong signal to the French that China would not allow Tonkin to fall under French control. In the summer of 1882, troops of the Chinese Yunnan Army and Guangxi Army crossed the border into Tonkin, occupying Lạng Sơn, Bắc Ninh, Hưng Hóa and other towns. The French minister to China, Frédéric Bourée, was so alarmed by the prospect of war with China that in November and December he negotiated a deal with the Chinese statesman Li Hongzhang to divide Tonkin into French and Chinese spheres of influence. Neither of the parties to these negotiations consulted the Vietnamese.

Rivière, disgusted at the deal cut by Bourée, decided early in 1883 to force the issue. He had recently been sent a battalion of marine infantry from France, giving him just enough men to venture beyond Hanoi. On 27 March 1883, to secure his line of communications from Hanoi to the coast, Rivière captured the citadel of Nam Định with a force of 520 French soldiers under his personal command. During his absence at Nam Định, the Black Flags and Vietnamese made an attack on Hanoi, but Chef de Bataillon Berthe de Villers repulsed them in the Battle of Gia Cuc (Gia Quất) on 28 March. Rivière jubilantly reacted: &#x27;This will force them to take forward their Tonkin Question!&#x27;

Rivière had perfect timing. He had expected to be cashiered for his capture of Nam Định; instead he found himself the hero of the hour. There had recently been a change of government in France, and the new administration of Jules Ferry strongly favoured colonial expansion. It therefore decided to back Rivière. Ferry and Foreign Minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour denounced Bourée&#x27;s agreement with Li Hongzhang and recalled the hapless French minister. They also made it clear to the Chinese that they were determined to place Tonkin under French protection. In April 1883, realising that the Vietnamese lacked the means of resisting the French effectively, the Chinese civil Mandarin Tang Jingsong (唐景崧) persuaded Liu Yongfu to take the field against Rivière with the Black Flag Army. This resulted in a year of Liu Yongfu&#x27;s forces fighting an unconventional war.

On 10 May 1883 Liu Yongfu challenged the French to battle in a taunting message widely placarded on the walls of Hanoi. On 19 May Rivière confronted the Black Flags in the Battle of Paper Bridge, and the French suffered a disastrous defeat. Rivière&#x27;s small force (around 450 men) attacked a strong Black Flag defensive position near the village of Cầu Giấy, a few miles to the west of Hanoi, known to the French as Paper Bridge (Pont de Papier). After initial successes the French were eventually enveloped on both wings; only with difficulty could they regroup and fall back to Hanoi. Rivière, Berthe de Villers and several other senior officers were killed in this action.

== French intervention in Tonkin ==
Rivière&#x27;s death produced an angry reaction in France. Reinforcements were rushed to Tonkin, a threatened attack by the Black Flags on Hanoi was averted, and the military situation was stabilised.

=== Protectorate over Tonkin ===

On 20 August 1883 Admiral Amédée Courbet, who had recently been appointed to the command of the newly formed Tonkin Coasts Naval Division, stormed the forts which guarded the approaches to the Vietnamese capital Huế in the Battle of Thuận An, and forced the Vietnamese government to sign the Treaty of Huế, placing Tonkin under French protection.

At the same time the new commander of the Tonkin expeditionary corps, General Bouët, attacked the Black Flag positions on the Day River. Although the French mauled the Black Flag Army in the Battle of Phủ Hoài (15 August) and the Battle of Palan (1 September), they were unable to capture all of Liu Yongfu&#x27;s positions, and in the eyes of the world the battles were tantamount to French defeats. Bouët was widely held to have failed in his mission, and resigned in September 1883. In the event, severe flooding eventually forced Liu Yongfu to abandon the line of the Day River and fall back to the fortified city of Sơn Tây, several miles to the west.

=== Confrontation between France and China ===

The French prepared for a major offensive at the end of the year to annihilate the Black Flags, and tried to persuade China to withdraw its support for Liu Yongfu, while attempting to win the support of the other European powers for the projected offensive. However, negotiations in Shanghai in July 1883 between the French minister Arthur Tricou and Li Hongzhang were terminated by the Qing government on receipt of a naively optimistic assessment by Marquis Zeng Jize, the Chinese minister to Paris, that the French government had no stomach for a full-scale war with China. Jules Ferry and the French foreign minister Paul-Armand Challemel-Lacour met a number of times in the summer and autumn of 1883 with Marquis Zeng in Paris, but these parallel diplomatic discussions also proved abortive. The Chinese stood firm, and refused to withdraw substantial garrisons of Chinese regular troops from Sơn Tây, Bắc Ninh and Lạng Sơn, despite the likelihood that they would be shortly engaged in battle against the French. As war with China seemed increasingly likely, the French persuaded the German government to delay the release of &quot;Dingyuan&quot; and &quot;Zhenyuan&quot;, two modern battleships then being constructed in German shipyards for China&#x27;s Beiyang Fleet. Meanwhile, the French consolidated their hold on the Delta by establishing posts at Quảng Yên, Hưng Yên and Ninh Bình.

The growing tension between France and China gave rise to anti-foreign demonstrations inside China during the autumn of 1883. The most serious incidents took place in Guangdong province, where Europeans were most prominent. Attacks were made on the property of European merchants in Guangzhou and on Shamian Island. Several European powers, including France, sent gunboats to Guangzhou to protect their nationals.

==== Sơn Tây and Bac Ninh ====
The French accepted that an attack on Liu Yongfu would probably result in an undeclared war with China, but calculated that a quick victory in Tonkin would force the Chinese to accept a &quot;fait accompli&quot;. Command of the Tonkin Campaign was entrusted to Courbet, who attacked Sơn Tây in December 1883. The Sơn Tây Campaign was the fiercest campaign the French had yet fought in Tonkin. Although the Chinese and Vietnamese contingents at Son Tay played little part in the defence, Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Black Flags fought ferociously to hold the city. On 14 December the French assaulted the outer defences of Sơn Tây at Phù Sa, but were thrown back with heavy casualties. Hoping to exploit Courbet&#x27;s defeat, Liu Yongfu attacked the French lines the same night, but the Black Flag attack also failed disastrously. After resting his troops on 15 December, Courbet again assaulted the defences of Sơn Tây on the afternoon of 16 December. This time the attack was thoroughly prepared by artillery, and delivered only after the defenders had been worn down. At 5 p.m. a Foreign Legion battalion and a battalion of marine fusiliers captured the western gate of Sơn Tây and fought their way into the town. Liu Yongfu&#x27;s garrison withdrew to the citadel, and evacuated Sơn Tây under cover of darkness several hours later. Courbet had achieved his objective, but at considerable cost. French casualties at Sơn Tây were 83 dead and 320 wounded. The fighting at Sơn Tây also took a terrible toll of the Black Flags, and in the opinion of some observers broke them once and for all as a serious fighting force. Liu Yongfu felt that he had been deliberately left to bear the brunt of the fighting by his Chinese and Vietnamese allies, and determined never again to expose his troops so openly.

In March 1884, the French renewed their offensive under the command of General Charles-Théodore Millot, who took over responsibility for the land campaign from Courbet after the fall of Sơn Tây. Reinforcements from France and the African colonies had now raised the strength of the Tonkin Expeditionary Corps to over 10,000 men, and Millot organised this force into two brigades. The 1st Brigade was commanded by General Louis Brière de l&#x27;Isle, who had earlier made his reputation as governor of Senegal, and the 2nd Brigade was commanded by the charismatic young Foreign Legion general François de Négrier, who had recently quelled a serious Arab rebellion in Algeria. The French target was Bắc Ninh, garrisoned by a strong force of regular Chinese troops of the Guangxi Army. The Bắc Ninh Campaign was a walkover for the French. Morale in the Chinese army was low, and Liu Yongfu was careful to keep his experienced Black Flags out of danger. Millot bypassed Chinese defences to the southwest of Bắc Ninh, and assaulted the city on 12 March from the southeast, with complete success. The Guangxi Army put up a feeble resistance, and the French took the city with ease, capturing large quantities of ammunition and a number of brand new Krupp cannon.

==== The Tientsin Accord and the Treaty of Huế ====
The defeat at Bắc Ninh, coming close on the heels of the fall of Sơn Tây, strengthened the hand of the moderate element in the Chinese government and temporarily discredited the extremist &#x27;Purist&#x27; party led by Zhang Zhidong, which was agitating for a full-scale war against France. Further French successes in the spring of 1884, including the Capture of Hưng Hóa and Thái Nguyên, convinced the Empress Dowager Cixi that China should come to terms, and an accord was reached between France and China in May. The negotiations took place in Tianjin (Tientsin). Li Hongzhang, the leader of the Chinese moderates, represented China; and Captain François-Ernest Fournier, commander of the French cruiser &quot;Volta&quot;, represented France. The Tientsin Accord, concluded on 11 May 1884, provided for Chinese recognition of the French protectorate over Annam and Tonkin and withdrawal of Chinese troops from Tonkin, in return for a comprehensive treaty that would settle details of trade and commerce between France and China and provide for the demarcation of its disputed border with Vietnam.

On 6 June the French followed up their accord with China by concluding a fresh Treaty of Huế with the Vietnamese, which established a French protectorate over both Annam and Tonkin and allowed the French to station troops at strategic points in Vietnamese territory and to install residents in the main towns. The signature of the treaty was accompanied by an important symbolic gesture. The seal presented by the emperor of China several decades earlier to the Vietnamese emperor Gia Long was melted down in the presence of the French and Vietnamese plenipotentiaries, betokening the renunciation by Vietnam of its traditional links with China.

Fournier was not a professional diplomat, and the Tientsin Accord contained several loose ends. Crucially, it failed to explicitly state a deadline for the Chinese troop withdrawal from Tonkin. The French asserted that the troop withdrawal was to take place immediately, while the Chinese argued that the withdrawal was contingent upon the conclusion of the comprehensive treaty. In fact, the Chinese stance was an ex post facto rationalisation, designed to justify their unwillingness or inability to put the terms of the accord into effect. The accord was extremely unpopular in China, and provoked an immediate backlash. The war party called for Li Hongzhang&#x27;s impeachment, and his political opponents intrigued to have orders sent to the Chinese troops in Tonkin to hold their positions.

==== The Bắc Lệ ambush ====
Li Hongzhang hinted to the French that there might be difficulties in enforcing the accord, but nothing specific was said. The French assumed that the Chinese troops would leave Tonkin as agreed, and made preparations for occupying the border towns of Lạng Sơn, Cao Bằng and Thất Khê. In early June 1884 a French column under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel Alphonse Dugenne advanced to occupy Lạng Sơn. On 23 June, near the small town of Bắc Lệ, the French encountered a strong detachment of the Guangxi Army ensconced in a defensive position behind Thương River. In view of the diplomatic significance of this discovery, Dugenne should have reported the presence of the Chinese force to Hanoi and waited for further instructions. Instead, he gave the Chinese an ultimatum, and on their refusal to withdraw resumed his advance. The Chinese opened fire on the advancing French, precipitating a two-day battle in which Dugenne&#x27;s column was encircled and seriously mauled. Dugenne eventually fought his way out of the Chinese encirclement and extricated his small force.

When news of the Bắc Lệ ambush reached Paris, there was fury at what was perceived as blatant Chinese treachery. Ferry&#x27;s government demanded an apology, an indemnity, and the immediate implementation of the terms of the Tianjin Accord. The Chinese government agreed to negotiate, but refused to apologise or pay any indemnity. The mood in France was against compromise, and although negotiations continued throughout July, Courbet was ordered to take his squadron to Fuzhou (Foochow). He was instructed to prepare to attack the Chinese Fujian Fleet in the harbour and to destroy the Foochow Navy Yard. Meanwhile, as a preliminary demonstration of what would follow if the Chinese were recalcitrant, Rear Admiral Sébastien Lespès destroyed three Chinese shore batteries in the port of Keelung in northern Formosa (Taiwan) by naval bombardment on 5 August. The French put a landing force ashore to occupy Keelung and the nearby coal mines at Pei-tao (Pa-tou), as a &#x27;pledge&#x27; (&quot;gage&quot;) to be bargained against a Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin, but the arrival of a large Chinese army under the command of the imperial commissioner Liu Mingchuan forced it to re-embark on 6 August.

==Sino-French War, August 1884 to April 1885==
===Operations of Admiral Courbet&#x27;s squadron===
====Fuzhou and the Min River====

Negotiations between France and China broke down in mid-August, and on 22 August Courbet was ordered to attack the Chinese fleet at Fuzhou. In the Battle of Fuzhou (also known as the Battle of the Pagoda Anchorage) on 23 August 1884, the French took their revenge for the Bắc Lệ Ambush. In a two-hour engagement watched with professional interest by neutral British and American vessels (the battle was one of the first occasions on which the spar torpedo was successfully deployed), Courbet&#x27;s Far East Squadron annihilated China&#x27;s outclassed Fujian fleet and severely damaged the Foochow Navy Yard (which, ironically, had been built under the direction of the French administrator Prosper Giquel). Nine Chinese ships were sunk in less than an hour, including the corvette &quot;Yangwu&quot;, the flagship of the Fujian fleet. Chinese losses may have amounted to 3,000 dead, while French losses were minimal. Courbet then successfully withdrew down the Min River to the open sea, destroying several Chinese shore batteries from behind as he took the French squadron through the Min&#x27;an and Jinpai passes.

==== Riots in Hong Kong ====
The French attack at Fuzhou effectively ended diplomatic contacts between France and China. Although neither country declared war, the dispute would now be settled on the battlefield. The news of the destruction of the Fujian fleet was greeted by an outbreak of patriotic fervour in China, marred by attacks on foreigners and foreign property. There was considerable sympathy for China in Europe, and the Chinese were able to hire a number of British, German and American army and navy officers as advisers.

Patriotic indignation spread to the British colony of Hong Kong. In September 1884 dock workers in Hong Kong refused to repair the French ironclad &quot;La Galissonnière&quot;, which had suffered shell damage in the August naval engagements. The strike collapsed at the end of September, but the dock workers were prevented from resuming their business by other groups of Chinese workers, including longshoremen, sedan chair carriers and rickshawmen. An attempt by the British authorities to protect the dock workers against harassment resulted in serious rioting on 3 October, during which at least one rioter was shot dead and several Sikh constables were injured. The British suspected, with good reason, that the disturbances had been fomented by the Chinese authorities in Guangdong province.

==== French occupation of Keelung ====

Meanwhile, the French decided to put pressure on China by landing an expeditionary corps in northern Formosa to seize Keelung and Tamsui, redeeming the failure of 6 August and finally winning the &#x27;pledge&#x27; they sought. On 1 October Lieutenant-Colonel Bertaux-Levillain landed at Keelung with a force of 1,800 marine infantry, forcing the Chinese to withdraw to strong defensive positions which had been prepared in the surrounding hills. The French force was too small to advance beyond Keelung, and the Pei-tao coal mines remained in Chinese hands. Meanwhile, after an ineffective naval bombardment on 2 October, Lespès attacked the Chinese defences at Tamsui with 600 sailors from his squadron&#x27;s landing companies on 8 October, but was decisively repulsed by forces under the command of the Fujianese general Sun Kaihua (孫開華). As a result, French control over Formosa was limited to the town of Keelung, far short of what had been hoped for.

==== Blockade of Taiwan ====
Towards the end of 1884 the French were able to enforce a limited blockade of the northern Formosan ports of Keelung and Tamsui and the prefectural capital Taiwan (now Tainan) and the southern port Takow (Kaohsiung). In early January 1885 the Formosa expeditionary corps, now under the command of Colonel Jacques Duchesne, was substantially reinforced with two battalions of infantry, bringing its total strength to around 4,000 men. Meanwhile, drafts from the Hunan Army and Anhui Army had brought the strength of Liu Mingchuan&#x27;s defending army to around 25,000 men. Although severely outnumbered, the French captured a number of minor Chinese positions to the southeast of Keelung at the end of January 1885, but were forced to halt offensive operations in February due to incessant rain.

The blockade succeeded in part because the northern Beiyang Fleet, commanded by Li Hongzhang, denied help to the southern Nanyang Fleet. No Beiyang ships were sent to battle the French. This led the Navy to fail. The most advanced ships were reserved for the northern Chinese fleet by Li Hongzhang, he did not even &quot;consider&quot; using this well equipped fleet to attack the French, since he wanted to make sure it was always under his command. China&#x27;s north and south had rivalries and the government was split into different parties. China did not have a single admiralty in command of the navy and the northern and southern fleets refused to cooperate, guaranteeing French control of the seas during the war. Tianjin&#x27;s northern naval academy also drained southern China of potential sailors, since they enlisted in northern China instead.

==== Shipu Bay, Zhenhai Bay and the rice blockade ====

Although the Formosa expeditionary corps remained confined in Keelung, the French scored important successes elsewhere in the spring of 1885. Courbet&#x27;s squadron had been reinforced substantially since the start of the war, and he now had considerably more ships at his disposal than in October 1884. In early February 1885 part of his squadron left Keelung to head off a threatened attempt by part of the Chinese Nanyang Fleet (Southern Seas fleet) to break the French blockade of Formosa. On 11 February Courbet&#x27;s task force met the cruisers &quot;Kaiji&quot;, &quot;Nanchen&quot; and &quot;Nanrui&quot;, three of the most modern ships in the Chinese fleet, near Shipu Bay, accompanied by the frigate &quot;Yuyuan&quot; and the composite sloop &quot;Chengqing&quot;. The Chinese scattered at the French approach, and while the three cruisers successfully made their escape, the French succeeded in trapping &quot;Yuyuan&quot; and &quot;Chengqing&quot; in Shipu Bay. On the night of 14 February, in the Battle of Shipu, the French attacked the Chinese vessels with two torpedo launches. During a brief engagement inside the bay, &quot;Yuyuan&quot; was seriously damaged by torpedoes and &quot;Chengqing&quot; was hit by &quot;Yuyuan&quot;&#x27;s fire. Both ships were subsequently scuttled by the Chinese. The French torpedo launches escaped almost without loss.

Courbet followed up this success on 1 March by locating &quot;Kaiji&quot;, &quot;Nanchen&quot; and &quot;Nanrui&quot;, which had taken refuge with four other Chinese warships in Zhenhai Bay, near the port of Ningbo. Courbet considered forcing the Chinese defences, but after testing its defenses finally decided to guard the entrance to the bay to keep the enemy vessels bottled up there for the duration of hostilities. A brief and inconclusive skirmish between the French cruiser &quot;Nielly&quot; and the Chinese shore batteries on 1 March enabled the Chinese general Ouyang Lijian (歐陽利見), charged with the defence of Ningbo, to claim the so-called &#x27;Battle of Zhenhai&#x27; as a defensive victory.

In February 1885, under diplomatic pressure from China, Britain invoked the provisions of the 1870 Foreign Enlistment Act and closed Hong Kong and other ports in the Far East to French warships. The French government retaliated by ordering Courbet to implement a &#x27;rice blockade&#x27; of the Yangzi River, hoping to bring the Qing court to terms by provoking serious rice shortages in northern China. The rice blockade severely disrupted the transport of rice by sea from Shanghai and forced the Chinese to carry it overland, but the war ended before the blockade seriously affected China&#x27;s economy.

=== Operations in Tonkin ===
==== French victories in the delta ====


Meanwhile, the French army in Tonkin was also putting severe pressure on the Chinese forces and their Black Flag allies. General Millot, whose health was failing, resigned as general-in-chief of the Tonkin expeditionary corps in early September 1884 and was replaced by General Brière de l&#x27;Isle, the senior of his two brigade commanders. Brière de l&#x27;Isle&#x27;s first task was to beat off a major Chinese invasion of the Red River Delta. In late September 1884, large detachments of the Guangxi Army advanced from Langson and probed into the Lục Nam valley, announcing their presence by ambushing the French gunboats &quot;Hache&quot; and &quot;Massue&quot; on 2 October. Brière de l&#x27;Isle responded immediately, transporting nearly 3,000 French soldiers to the Lục Nam valley aboard a flotilla of gunboats and attacking the Chinese detachments before they could concentrate. In the Kép Campaign, (2 to 15 October 1884), three French columns under the overall command of General de Négrier fell upon the separated detachments of the Guangxi Army and successively defeated them in engagements at Lam Cốt (6 October), Kép (8 October) and Chũ (10 October). The second of these battles was marked by bitter close-quarter fighting between French and Chinese troops, and de Négrier&#x27;s soldiers suffered heavy casualties storming the fortified village of Kép. The exasperated victors shot or bayoneted scores of wounded Chinese soldiers after the battle, and reports of French atrocities at Kép shocked public opinion in Europe. In fact, prisoners were rarely taken by either side during the Sino-French War, and the French were equally shocked by the Chinese habit of paying a bounty for severed French heads.

In the wake of these French victories the Chinese fell back to Bắc Lệ and Đồng Sông, and de Négrier established important forward positions at Kép and Chũ, which threatened the Guangxi Army&#x27;s base at Lạng Sơn. Chũ was only a few miles southwest of the Guangxi Army&#x27;s advanced posts at Đồng Sông, and on 16 December a strong Chinese raiding detachment ambushed two companies of the Foreign Legion just to the east of Chũ, at Hà Hồ&quot;.&quot; The legionnaires fought their way out of the Chinese encirclement, but suffered a number of casualties and had to abandon their dead on the battlefield. De Négrier immediately brought up reinforcements and pursued the Chinese, but the raiders made good their retreat to Đồng Sông.

Shortly after the October engagements against the Guangxi Army, Brière de l&#x27;Isle took steps to resupply the western outposts of Hưng Hóa, Thái Nguyên and Tuyên Quang, which were coming under increasing threat from Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Black Flags and Tang Jingsong&#x27;s Yunnan Army. On 19 November, in the Battle of Yu-Oc, a column making for Tuyên Quang under the command of Duchesne was ambushed in the Yu-Oc gorge by the Black Flags but was able to fight its way through to the beleaguered post. The French also sealed off the eastern Delta from raids by Chinese guerillas based in Guangdong by occupying Tiên Yên, Đông Triều and other strategic points, and by blockading the Cantonese port of Beihai (Pak-Hoi). They also conducted sweeps along the lower course of the Red River to dislodge Annamese guerilla bands from bases close to Hanoi. These operations enabled Brière de l&#x27;Isle to concentrate the bulk of the Tonkin expeditionary corps around Chũ and Kép at the end of 1884, to advance on Lạng Sơn as soon as the word was given.

==== Lạng Sơn Campaign ====

French strategy in Tonkin was the subject of a bitter debate in the Chamber of Deputies in late December 1884. The army minister General Jean-Baptiste-Marie Campenon argued that the French should consolidate their hold on the Delta. His opponents urged an all-out offensive to throw the Chinese out of northern Tonkin. The debate culminated in Campenon&#x27;s resignation and his replacement as army minister by the hawkish General Jules Louis Lewal, who immediately ordered Brière de l&#x27;Isle to capture Lạng Sơn. The campaign would be launched from the French forward base at Chũ, and on 3 and 4 January 1885 General de Négrier attacked and defeated a substantial detachment of the Guangxi Army that had concentrated around the nearby village of Núi Bop to try to disrupt the French preparations. De Nègrier&#x27;s victory at Núi Bop, won at odds of just under one to ten, was regarded by his fellow-officers as the most spectacular professional triumph of his career.

It took the French a month to complete their preparations for the Lạng Sơn Campaign. Finally, on 3 February 1885, Brière de l&#x27;Isle began his advance from Chũ with a column of just under 7,200 troops, accompanied by 4,500 coolies. In ten days the column advanced to the outskirts of Lang Son. The troops were burdened with the weight of their provisions and equipment, and had to march through extremely difficult country. They also had to fight fierce actions to overrun stoutly defended Chinese positions, at Tây Hòa (4 February), Hạ Hòa (5 February) and Đồng Sông (6 February). After a brief pause for breath at Đồng Sông, the expeditionary corps pressed on towards Lạng Sơn, fighting further actions at Quao Pass (9 February), and Vy village (11 February). On 12 February, in a costly but successful battle, the Turcos and marine infantry of Colonel Laurent Giovanninelli&#x27;s 1st Brigade stormed the main Chinese defences at Bắc Việt, several kilometres to the south of Lạng Sơn. On 13 February, the French column entered Lạng Sơn which the Chinese abandoned after fighting a token rearguard action at the nearby village of Kỳ Lừa.

==== Siege and relief of Tuyên Quang ====

The capture of Lang Son allowed substantial French forces to be diverted further west to relieve the small and isolated French garrison in Tuyên Quang, which had been placed under siege in November 1884 by Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Black Flag Army and Tang Jingsong&#x27;s Yunnan Army. The Siege of Tuyên Quang was the most evocative confrontation of the Sino-French War. The Chinese and Black Flags sapped methodically up to the French positions, and in January and February 1885 breached the outer defences with mines and delivered seven separate assaults on the breach. The Tuyên Quang garrison, 400 legionnaires and 200 Tonkinese auxiliaries under the command of &quot;chef de bataillon&quot; Marc-Edmond Dominé, beat off all attempts to storm their positions, but lost over a third of their strength (50 dead and 224 wounded) sustaining a heroic defence against overwhelming odds. By mid-February it was clear that Tuyên Quang would fall unless it was relieved immediately.

Leaving de Négrier at Lang Son with the 2nd Brigade, Brière de l&#x27;Isle personally led Giovanninelli&#x27;s 1st Brigade back to Hanoi, and then upriver to the relief of Tuyên Quang. The brigade, reinforced at Phủ Doãn, on 24 February by a small column from Hưng Hóa under the command of Lieutenant-Colonel de Maussion, found the route to Tuyên Quang blocked by a strong Chinese defensive position at Hòa Mộc. On 2 March 1885 Giovanninelli attacked the left flank of the Chinese defensive line. The Battle of Hòa Mộc was the most fiercely fought action of the war. Two French assaults were decisively repulsed, and although the French eventually stormed the Chinese positions, they suffered very high casualties (76 dead and 408 wounded). Nevertheless, their costly victory cleared the way to Tuyên Quang. The Yunnan Army and the Black Flags raised the siege and drew off to the west, and the relieving force entered the beleaguered post on 3 March. Brière de l&#x27;Isle praised the courage of the hard-pressed garrison in a widely quoted order of the day. &#x27;Today, you enjoy the admiration of the men who have relieved you at such heavy cost. Tomorrow, all France will applaud you!&#x27;

=== End ===
==== Bang Bo, Kỳ Lừa and the retreat from Lạng Sơn ====
Before his departure for Tuyên Quang, Brière de l&#x27;Isle ordered de Négrier to press on from Lạng Sơn towards the Chinese border and expel the battered remnants of the Guangxi Army from Tonkinese soil. After resupplying the 2nd Brigade with food and ammunition, de Négrier defeated the Guangxi Army at the Battle of Đồng Đăng on 23 February 1885 and cleared it from Tonkinese territory. For good measure, the French crossed briefly into Guangxi province and blew up the &#x27;Gate of China&#x27;, an elaborate Chinese customs building on the Tonkin-Guangxi border. They were not strong enough to exploit this victory, however, and the 2nd Brigade returned to Lạng Sơn at the end of February.

By early March, in the wake of the French victories at Hoà Mộc and Đồng Đăng, the military situation in Tonkin had reached a temporary stalemate. Giovanninelli&#x27;s 1st Brigade faced Tang Qingsong&#x27;s Yunnan Army around Hưng Hóa and Tuyên Quang, while de Négrier&#x27;s 2nd Brigade at Lạng Sơn faced Pan Dingxin&#x27;s Guangxi Army. Neither Chinese army had any realistic prospect of launching an offensive for several weeks, while the two French brigades that had jointly captured Lạng Sơn in February were not strong enough to inflict a decisive defeat on either Chinese army separately. Meanwhile, the French government was pressuring Brière de l&#x27;Isle to send the 2nd Brigade across the border into Guangxi province, in the hope that a threat to Chinese territory would force China to sue for peace. Brière de l&#x27;Isle and de Négrier examined the possibility of a campaign to capture the major Chinese military depot at Longzhou (Lung-chou, 龍州), 60 kilometres beyond the border, but on 17 March Brière de l&#x27;Isle advised the army ministry in Paris that such an operation was beyond his strength. Substantial French reinforcements reached Tonkin in the middle of March, giving Brière de l&#x27;Isle a brief opportunity to break the stalemate. He moved the bulk of the reinforcements to Hưng Hóa to reinforce the 1st Brigade, intending to attack the Yunnan Army and drive it back beyond Yen Bay. While he and Giovanninelli drew up plans for a western offensive, he ordered de Négrier to hold his positions at Lang Son.

On 23 and 24 March the 2nd Brigade, only 1,500 men strong, fought a fierce action with over 25,000 troops of the Guangxi Army entrenched near Zhennanguan on the Chinese border. The Battle of Bang Bo (named by the French from the Vietnamese pronunciation of Hengpo, a village in the centre of the Chinese position where the fighting was fiercest), is normally known as the Battle of Zhennan Pass in China. The French took a number of outworks on 23 March, but failed to take the main Chinese positions on 24 March and were fiercely counterattacked in their turn. Although the French made a fighting withdrawal and prevented the Chinese from piercing their line, casualties in the 2nd Brigade were relatively heavy (70 dead and 188 wounded) and there were ominous scenes of disorder as the defeated French regrouped after the battle. As the brigade&#x27;s morale was precarious and ammunition was running short, de Négrier decided to fall back to Lạng Sơn.

The coolies abandoned the French who were already suffering supply issues. The Chinese advanced slowly in pursuit, and on 28 March de Négrier fought a battle at Kỳ Lừa in defence of Lạng Sơn. Rested, recovered and fighting behind breastworks, the French successfully held their positions and inflicted crippling casualties on the Guangxi Army. French casualties at Kỳ Lừa were 7 men killed and 38 wounded. The Chinese left 1,200 corpses on the battlefield, and a further 6,000 Chinese soldiers may have been wounded.

Towards the end of the battle de Négrier was seriously wounded in the chest while scouting the Chinese positions. He was forced to hand over command to his senior regimental commander, Lieutenant-Colonel Paul-Gustave Herbinger. Herbinger was a noted military theoretician who had won a respectable battlefield reputation during the Franco-Prussian War, but was quite out of his depth as a field commander in Tonkin. Several French officers had already commented scathingly on his performance during the Lạng Sơn campaign and at Bang Bo, where he had badly bungled an attack on the Chinese positions.

Upon assuming command of the brigade, Herbinger panicked. Despite the evidence that the Chinese had been decisively defeated and were streaming back in disarray towards the Chinese frontier, he convinced himself that they were preparing to encircle Lạng Sơn and cut his supply line. Disregarding the appalled protests of some of his officers, he ordered the 2nd Brigade to abandon Lạng Sơn on the evening of 28 March and retreat to Chũ. The retreat from Lạng Sơn was conducted without loss and with little interference from the Chinese, but Herbinger set an unnecessarily punishing pace and abandoned considerable quantities of food, ammunition and equipment. When the 2nd Brigade eventually rallied at Chũ, its soldiers were exhausted and demoralised. Meanwhile, the Chinese general Pan Dingxin (潘鼎新), informed by sympathisers in Lạng Sơn that the French were in full retreat, promptly turned his battered army around and reoccupied Lạng Sơn on 30 March. The Chinese were in no condition to pursue the French to Chũ, and contented themselves with a limited advance to Đồng Sông. The retreat was seen as a Chinese victory.

There was also bad news for the French from the western front. On 23 March, in the Battle of Phu Lam Tao, a force of Chinese regulars and Black Flags surprised and routed a French zouave battalion that had been ordered to scout positions around Hưng Hóa in preparation for Giovanninelli&#x27;s projected offensive against the Yunnan Army.

==== Collapse of Ferry&#x27;s government ====

Neither reverse was serious, but in the light of Herbinger&#x27;s alarming reports Brière de l&#x27;Isle believed the situation to be much worse than it was, and sent an extremely pessimistic telegram back to Paris on the evening of 28 March. The political effect of this telegram was momentous. Ferry&#x27;s immediate reaction was to reinforce the army in Tonkin, and indeed Brière de l&#x27;Isle quickly revised his estimate of the situation and advised the government that the front could soon be stabilised. However, his second thoughts came too late. When his first telegram was made public in Paris there was an uproar in the Chamber of Deputies. A motion of no confidence was tabled, and Ferry&#x27;s government fell on 30 March. The &#x27;Tonkin Affair&#x27;, as this humiliating blow to French policy in Tonkin was immediately dubbed, effectively ended Ferry&#x27;s distinguished career in French politics. He would never again become Premier, and his political influence during the rest of his career would be severely limited. His successor, Henri Brisson, promptly concluded peace with China. The Chinese government agreed to implement the Tientsin Accord (implicitly recognising the French protectorate over Tonkin), and the French government dropped its demand for an indemnity for the Bắc Lệ ambush. A peace protocol ending hostilities was signed on 4 April, and a substantive peace treaty was signed on 9 June at Tianjin by Li Hongzhang and the French minister Jules Patenôtre.

==== Japan and Russia&#x27;s threat to join the war against China and the Northern fleet ====
Japan had taken advantage of China&#x27;s distraction with France to intrigue in the Chinese protectorate state of Korea. In December 1884 the Japanese sponsored the &#x27;Gapsin Coup&#x27;, bringing Japan and China to the brink of war. Thereafter the Qing court considered that the Japanese were a greater threat to China than the French. In January 1885 the Empress Dowager directed her ministers to seek an honourable peace with France. Secret talks between the French and Chinese were held in Paris in February and March 1885, and the fall of Ferry&#x27;s ministry removed the last remaining obstacles to a peace.

The Korean issue led to Japan and Russia having deteriorating relations with China, and in northern China Japan potentially threatened to join the war with France against China. North China was menaced by the prospect of Japan and Russia joining in the war which led to China seeking a peace deal even though Chinese forces defeated the French on land.

Throughout the war Li Hongzhang rejected pleas he deploy the Beiyang fleet against the French, citing the Korean issue and threat of Japanese intervention. In truth, Li Hongzhang wanted to maintain direct control of the fleet by keeping it anchored in northern China and away from combat where it could potentially slip out of his personal control.

==== Final engagements ====

Ironically, while the war was being decided on the battlefields of Tonkin and in Paris, the Formosa expeditionary corps won two spectacular victories in March 1885. In a series of actions fought between 4 and 7 March, Duchesne broke the Chinese encirclement of Keelung with a flank attack delivered against the east of the Chinese line, capturing the key position of La Table and forcing the Chinese to withdraw behind the Keelung River. Duchesne&#x27;s victory sparked a brief panic in Taipei, but the French were not strong enough to advance beyond their bridgehead. The Keelung Campaign now reached a point of equilibrium. The French were holding a virtually impregnable defensive perimeter around Keelung but could not exploit their success, while Liu Mingchuan&#x27;s army remained in presence just beyond their advanced positions.

However, the French had one card left to play. Duchesne&#x27;s victory enabled Courbet to detach a marine infantry battalion from the Keelung garrison to capture the Pescadores Islands in late March. Strategically, the Pescadores campaign was an important victory, which would have prevented the Chinese from further reinforcing their army in Formosa, but it came too late to affect the outcome of the war. Future French operations were cancelled on the news of Herbinger&#x27;s retreat from Lạng Sơn on 28 March, and Courbet was on the point of evacuating Keelung to reinforce the Tonkin expeditionary corps, leaving only a minimum garrison at Makung in the Pescadores, when hostilities were ended in April by the conclusion of preliminaries of peace.

The news of the peace protocol of 4 April did not reach the French and Chinese forces in Tonkin for several days, and the final engagement of the Sino-French War took place on 14 April 1885 at Kép, where the French beat off a half-hearted Chinese attack on their positions. Meanwhile, Brière de l&#x27;Isle had reinforced the key French posts at Hưng Hóa and Chũ, and when hostilities ended in the third fortnight of April the French were standing firm against both the Guangxi and Yunnan armies. Although Brière de l&#x27;Isle was planning to attack the Yunnan Army at Phu Lam Tao to avenge the defeat of 23 March, many French officers doubted whether this offensive would have succeeded. At the same time, the Chinese armies had no prospect whatsoever of driving the French from Hưng Hóa or Chũ. Militarily, the war in Tonkin ended in a stalemate.

The peace protocol of 4 April required the Chinese to withdraw their armies from Tonkin, and the French continued to occupy Keelung and the Pescadores for several months after the end of hostilities, as a surety for Chinese good faith. Courbet fell seriously ill during this occupation, and on 11 June died aboard his flagship &quot;Bayard&quot; in Makung harbour. Meanwhile, the Chinese punctiliously observed the terms of the peace settlement, and by the end of June 1885 both the Yunnan and Guangxi armies had evacuated Tonkin. Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Black Flag Army also withdrew from Tonkinese territory.

=== Continuation of insurgency ===

Liu Yongfu&#x27;s Chinese Black Flag forces continued to harass and fight the French in Tonkin after the end of the Sino-French War.

With support from China, Vietnamese and Chinese freebooters fought against the French in Lạng Sơn in the 1890s. They were labelled &quot;pirates&quot; by the French. The Black Flags and Liu Yongfu in China received requests for assistance from Vietnamese anti-French forces.

In 1891, &quot;Goldthwaite&#x27;s Geographical Magazine, Volumes 1–2&quot; wrote, &quot;FOUR months ago, a band of 500 pirates attacked the French residency at Chobo, in &#x27;l&#x27;onkin. They beheaded the French resident, ransacked and burned the town, and killed many of the people.&quot; In 1906 the &quot;Decennial Reports on the Trade, Navigation, Industries, Etc., of the Ports Open to Foreign Commerce in China and Corea, and on the Condition and Development of the Treaty Port Provinces ..., Volume 2&quot; said &quot;Piracy on the Tonkin border was very prevalent in the early years of the decade. Fortified frontier posts were established in 1893 by the Tonkin Customs at the most dangerous passes into China, for the purpose of repressing contraband, the importation of arms and ammunition, and specially the illicit traflic of women, children, and cattle, which the pirates raided in Tonkin and carried beyond the Chinese mountains with impunity. These posts were eventually handed over to the military authorities.&quot; In 1894, &quot;Around Tonkin and Siam&quot; wrote, &quot;This, in my view, is too pessimist an estimate of the situation, a remark which also applies to the objection that these new roads facilitate the circulation of pirates. Defective as they may be, these roads must, it seems to me, be of service to cultivation and trade, and, therefore, in the long run to the pacification of the country.&quot; In 1893 &quot;The Medical World, Volume 11&quot; said &quot;&quot;Captain Hugot, of the Zouaves, was inclose pursuit of the infamous Thuyết, one of the most redoubtable, ferocious, and cunning of the Black Flag (Annamite pirates) leaders, the man who prepared and executed the ambuscade at Hue. The captain was just about to seize the person of the young pretender Hàm-Nghi, whom the Black Flags had recently proclaimed sovereign of Armani, when he was struck by several arrows, discharged by the body-guard of Hàm-Nghi. The wounds were all light, scarcely more than scratches, and no evil effect was feared at the time. After a few days, however, in spite of every care, the captain grew weaker, and it became apparent that he was suffering from the effects of arrow poison. He was removed as quickly and as tenderly as possible to Tánh-Hóa, where he died in horrible agony a few days later, in spite of the most scientific treatment and the most assiduous attention.&quot;— National Druggist.&quot; The 1892 &quot;The Imperial and Asiatic Quarterly Review and Oriental and Colonial Record&quot; said &quot;The French port of Yến Long was surprised by Chinese and Annamite pirates and the troops driven out with loss.&quot;

== French attempts to secure an alliance with Japan ==
The French were well aware of China&#x27;s sensitivities regarding Japan, and as early as June 1883, in the wake of Rivière&#x27;s death at Paper Bridge, began angling for an alliance with Japan to offset their precarious military position in Tonkin. The French foreign minister Paul Challemel-Lacour believed that France &quot;ought not to disdain the support which, at an appropriate moment, the attitude of Japan would be able to supply to our actions&quot;. In order to court the Japanese government, France offered to support Japan&#x27;s pleas for revision of the unequal treaties of the Bakumatsu era, which provided extra-territoriality and advantageous tariffs to foreigners. Japan welcomed the offer of French support, but was reluctant to be drawn into a military alliance. Japan was in effect quite worried of the military might China represented, at least on paper, at that time. As the situation in Annam deteriorated however, France was even more anxious to obtain Japanese help.

After French difficulties in Taiwan, new attempts at negotiating an alliance were made with the Minister General Campenon meeting with General Miura Gorō, but Gorō remained ambiguous, encouraging France to continue to support Japan&#x27;s drive for Treaty revision. Hopes for an alliance were reawakened in December 1884 when a clash occurred between China and Japan in Korea, when Japan supported the Gapsin coup d&#x27;état by Kim Ok-gyun against the pro-Chinese Korean government, prompting Ferry to request the French ambassador in Japan, Joseph Adam Sienkiewicz, to approach the Japanese government with an offer. Sienkiewicz however remained extremely negative to the point of refraining from communicating Ferry&#x27;s proposal. French interest faded in 1885 as the campaign in Tonkin progressed, while, on the contrary Japanese interest increased as the Japanese government and public opinion started to favour open conflict with China. The Sino-French War ended however without an alliance coming to fruition.

== Aftermath ==
===Political situation===

Li Hongzhang and Zeng Jize were key Chinese officials in the negotiations between China, France, and Vietnam. At the time, Li was the viceroy of Zhili and chief minister of Beiyang. Zeng was the Chinese ambassador to France. Li favoured a quick settlement but Zeng talked of prolonging the war. The peace treaty of June 1885 gave the French control of Annam, the contested area of Indochina. They were obliged to evacuate Formosa and the Pescadores Islands (which Courbet had wanted to retain as a French counterweight to British Hong Kong), but the Chinese withdrawal from Tonkin left the way clear for them to reoccupy Lạng Sơn and to advance up the Red River to Lào Cai on the Yunnan–Tonkin border. In the years that followed the French crushed a vigorous Vietnamese resistance movement and consolidated their hold on Annam and Tonkin. In 1887, Cochinchina, Annam and Tonkin (the territories which comprise the modern state of Vietnam) and Cambodia were incorporated into French Indochina. They were joined a few years later by Laos, ceded to France by Siam at the conclusion of the Franco-Siamese crisis of 1893. France dropped demands for an indemnity from China.

Domestically, the unsatisfactory conclusion to the Sino-French War dampened enthusiasm for colonial conquest. The war had already destroyed Ferry&#x27;s career, and his successor Henri Brisson also resigned in the wake of the acrimonious &#x27;Tonkin Debate&#x27; of December 1885, in which Clemenceau and other opponents of colonial expansion nearly succeeded in securing a French withdrawal from Tonkin. In the end, the Chamber voted the 1886 credits to support the Tonkin expeditionary corps by 274 votes to 270.

===Military===
====Land====
There are different interpretations for the significance of the military campaign on land. According to Bruce A. Elleman, the Chinese forces outnumbered the French, their weapons were modern, but their training was largely inferior. Although the Qing troops suffered initial losses, they also won victories (though fewer in number) and managed to push back French forces. The French withdrawal from Lang Són was seen by many as the result of panic and Qing forces captured Lang Són and its surrounding territory by early April 1885. Fighting ended on 4 April 1885 as a result of peace negotiations due to the Qing court&#x27;s concerns about the economy, French naval supremacy, lack of foreign support, and northern threats posed by Russia and Japan. The call for peace seemed unbelievable to some Chinese contemporaries given the Chinese successes immediately prior. Ban Zhao, a front-line commander, reported that his subordinates begged for them to continue their attack. Many other commanders and officers in the south as well as the governor-general of Guangdong-Guangxi, Zhang Zhidong, protested the end of the war. In Taiwan, the French succeeded in occupying Keelung in the north but failed to advance any further after seven months. Henri Cordier described both Keelung and Tamsui as worthless places.

Chinese sources often condemn the final peace agreement and emphasize the Chinese successes that preceded the peace. According to Loyd Eastman, this interpretation fails to account for the overall situation of China, which had to contend with Russian and Japanese threats in the north, the critical situation in Taiwan, and weak supply lines in the south. Eastman claims that fear of conflict with Japan was the deciding factor in the Qing court&#x27;s decision to sue for peace. Elleman states that although &quot;China&#x27;s forces in Tonkin achieved some notable land victories against the French,&quot; it became clear China would not receive any foreign assistance, and this forced Beijing to open negotiations. In the final treaty on 9 June 1885, China affirmed Annam&#x27;s status as a French protectorate and allowed French firms to trade directly in China&#x27;s southern provinces, promising to open five ports in the following years. Although no indemnity was paid, China accrued 20 million taels in debt for the war effort, and lost another 100 million taels in economic losses. As a result, Elleman deemed China to have lost the war by any modern standard.

Jane E. Elliott suggests that contemporary Chinese and foreign analysts may have been correct in finding the final peace treaty amusing as the Chinese seemed to be ascendant. Elliott notes that Western scholarly sources fail to give straightforward reasons and detailed descriptions of Chinese victories. Chinese victories were attributed to French mismanagement or misjudgement, the climate, and the difficulties of logistics. However the same problems also existed for the Chinese. Francis Garnier, Henri Rivière, and many senior French officers died in the war. In some instances, the French were only able to momentarily hold on to forts in Vietnam and Taiwan. The French succeeded in capturing Keelung in Taiwan but failed to take Tamsui for example. These mixed results may have appeared to indicate both French victory in France and French defeat in China. Elliott notes that contemporary European sources were averse to reporting French losses and glossed over mistakes made on the French side. Accounts of battles were manipulated to consistently portray the French as superior and never definitively losing, so that the Chinese never won except in instances of French error. Even recent work &quot;perpetuates the myth that the French defeated the Chinese easily.&quot; The land campaign of the Sino-French War has been described by Chung-yam Po and Katherine Hui-yi Tseng as a French defeat and a Chinese victory.

====Navy====
Historians have judged the Qing dynasty&#x27;s vulnerability and weakness to foreign imperialism in the 19th century to be based mainly on its maritime naval weakness, the historian Edward L. Dreyer said that &quot;Meanwhile, new but not exactly modern Chinese armies suppressed the mid century rebellions, bluffed Russia into a peaceful settlement of disputed frontiers in Central Asia, and defeated the French forces on land in the Sino-French War (1884–85). However the defeat of the fleet, and the resulting threat to steamship traffic to Taiwan, forced China to conclude peace on unfavorable terms.&quot;

<doc id="252074" wikidata="Q414257" url="?curid=252074" title="Nepetalactone">
<text>Nepetalactone is a name for multiple iridoid analog stereoisomers. Nepetalactones are produced by &quot;Nepeta cataria&quot; (catnip) and many other plants belonging to the genus &quot;Nepeta&quot;, in which they protect these plants from herbivorous insects by functioning as insect repellents. They are also produced by many aphids, in which they are sex pheromones. Nepetalactones are cat attractants, and cause the behavioral effects that catnip induces in domestic cats. However, they affect visibly only about two thirds of adult cats. They produce similar behavioral effects in many other felids, especially in lions and jaguars. In 1941, the research group of Samuel M. McElvain was the first to determine the structures of nepetalactones and several related compounds.

==Structure and properties==

Nepetalactone has three chiral centers, two at the fusion of the two rings, and one where the methyl group attaches to the cyclopentane ring. Thus, it has eight (23) stereoisomers. The terms &quot;cis&quot; and &quot;trans&quot; are used to refer to the relative stereochemistry at the ring fusion, and also to the methyl group as compared to the lactone on the cyclopentane.

(&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-Nepetalactone is a colorless oil. Its boiling point is 71 °C at 0.05 mmHg. At 25 °C, its density is 1.0663 g/mL and refractive index 1.4859.

==Natural occurrence==
Plants belonging to the &quot;Nepeta&quot; genus produce 4 different nepetalactone stereoisomers: (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-, (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-, (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)- and (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-nepetalactone. Their relative occurrence varies among plant species. Small amounts of (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)- and (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactone also occur in the wood of &quot;Lonicera tatarica&quot;, but its cat attractant effects are assumed to be caused by actinidine, which occurs in it in higher concentrations.
Nepetalactones are also produced by many aphids, in which they function as sex pheromones. The most common isomer in aphids is (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-nepetalactone. Aphids also commonly produce a structurally related (1&quot;R&quot;,4a&quot;S&quot;,7&quot;S&quot;,7a&quot;R&quot;)-nepetalactol, which is also an aphid sex pheromone. Relative concentrations of these two compounds varies among aphid species.

==Biosynthesis==
Nepetalactone is a bicyclic monoterpene produced through the terpenoid pathway in the genus &quot;Nepeta&quot; using its starting compound, geranyl pyrophosphate (GPP). There are three isomers of nepetalactone and it is suggested their stereochemistry is produced using different enzymes. Geranyl pyrophosphate undergoes hydrolysis and several oxidations to form 8-oxogeranial which can undergo a canonical activation–cyclation step in iridoid biosynthesis. Uncanonically, 8-oxogeranial will be reduced to create an 8-oxocitronellyl enol intermediate. Through a Diels–Alder reaction with a group of cyclases known as nepetalactone-related short-chain dehydrogenase enzymes (NEPS), the different stereoisomers of nepetalactone are biosynthesized.

The process starts with geraniol synthase (GES) hydrolyzing GPP to form geraniol which is oxidized into 8-hydrogeraniol by geraniol-8-hydroxylase (G8H) (scheme 1). Geraniol-8-hydroxylase is further oxidized by 8-hydroxygeraniol oxidoreductase (8OG) to produce 8-oxo-geranial which is reduced by iridoid synthase (ISY) and NADPH to form the intermediate 8-oxocitronellyl enol (scheme 2). This intermediate leads to cyclization by a gene cluster which utilizes ISY and major latex-protein-like genes (MLPL) or NEPS homologs. 8-oxocitronellyl enol is cyclized into (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-nepetalactol by MLPL, NEPS1, or NEPS2 and then oxidized by NEPS5 and the cofactor NAD+ to yield (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-nepetalactone (scheme 3). The process can be repeated with 8-oxocitronellyl enol cyclizing into (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactol by NEPS3 and oxidation by NEPS1 or NEPS5 and NAD+ to yield (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactone (scheme 4). 8-Oxocitronellyl enol can also be cyclized into (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactol by NEPS4 and then oxidized by NEPS1 into (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactone (scheme 5). It is suggested that the lack of the NEPS1 leads to decay and formation of (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-iridodial.

==Effects in felines==
===Duration and efficacy variation===
Nepetalactones affect domestic cats via nasal mucosa. Oral ingestion has no effects. They induce noticeable behavioral effects in about two thirds of adult cats. However, all cats are probably affected by them, but the effects in one third of adult cats are less visible. Nepetalactones do not noticeably affect kittens that are less than three months old. Their effects also tend to be less pronounced in neutered cats in comparison to non-neutered cats, but not significantly.

The effects of nepetalactones begin quickly in domestic cats, and last for 5 to 15 minutes. Cats develop drug tolerance towards nepetalactones after exposure. The tolerance lasts for a few hours.

Lions (&quot;Panthera leo&quot;) and jaguars (&quot;Panthera onca&quot;) are sensitive to nepetalactones. Their effects can last in them for up to 60 minutes. They also affect leopards (&quot;Panthera pardus&quot;). Species exhibiting overall lesser to no sensitivity include tigers (&quot;Panthera tigris&quot;), bobcats (&quot;Lynx rufus&quot;), cougars (&quot;Puma concolor&quot;) or oncillas (&quot;Leopardus tigrinus&quot;).

===Effects===
Two thirds of adult domestic cats begin to lick, sniff, eat, scratch or roll over the nepetalactone source after being exposed to it. They may also begin pawing, shaking their heads, rubbing their cheeks, licking themselves or vocalizing. About one third of adult cats react more passively to nepetalactones, and may assume a sphinx-like posture, decrease vocalization or decrease movement. The effects of nepetalactones are similar in other Felidae.

===Mechanism of action===
Felidae olfactory receptor exposure to nepetalactones or nepetalactols induces β-endorphin secretion in the blood; this endorphin release in turn activates μ-opioid receptors as an agonist, thus working in a similar manner as morphine or other opioids. Naloxone, a μ-opioid receptor antagonist, is known to block the effects of nepetalactones and nepetalactols in domestic cats, which supports this endorphin related mechanism of action. Repeated exposure to nepetalactones or nepetalactols does not induce opioid withdrawals in Felidae, probably because endogenous β-endorphin secretion is controlled. (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)- and (&quot;trans&quot;,&quot;cis&quot;)-nepetalactones have both been shown to function as cat attractants in domestic cats in studies of poor quality. Both isomers occur in catnip for example, but the (&quot;cis&quot;,&quot;trans&quot;)-isomer is the major one.

===Evolutionary reasons for the effects===
Felidae react to plants that contain nepetalactones by licking them and rubbing them in their fur. Nepetalactones and nepetalactols repel some disease-causing insects. For example, nepetalactols are able to repel &quot;Aedes albopictus&quot;. The cats typically hunt other animals by stalking them. This requires being still or slow movements, which allow insects to bite the cat more easily. This would make evolutionary pressure select for the behavior of rubbing of natural insect repellent. This was proposed to be the reason for this widely preserved behavioral trait in Felidae in a paper published in 2021.

<text>In complex analysis, de Branges&#x27;s theorem, or the Bieberbach conjecture, is a theorem that gives a necessary condition on a holomorphic function in order for it to map the open unit disk of the complex plane injectively to the complex plane. It was posed by and finally proven by .

The statement concerns the Taylor coefficients formula_1 of a univalent function, i.e. a one-to-one holomorphic function that maps the unit disk into the complex plane, normalized as is always possible so that formula_2 and formula_3. That is, we consider a function defined on the open unit disk which is holomorphic and injective (&quot;univalent&quot;) with Taylor series of the form

:formula_4

Such functions are called &quot;schlicht&quot;. The theorem then states that

:formula_5

The Koebe function (see below) is a function for which formula_6 for all formula_7, and it is schlicht, so we cannot find a stricter limit on the absolute value of the formula_7th coefficient.

==Schlicht functions==

The normalizations

:formula_9

mean that

:formula_10

This can always be obtained by an affine transformation: starting with an arbitrary injective holomorphic function formula_11 defined on the open unit disk and setting

:formula_12

Such functions formula_11 are of interest because they appear in the Riemann mapping theorem.

A schlicht function is defined as an analytic function formula_14 that is one-to-one and satisfies formula_15 and formula_16. A family of schlicht functions are the rotated Koebe functions

:formula_17

with formula_18 a complex number of absolute value formula_19. If formula_14 is a schlicht function and formula_21 for some 
formula_22, then formula_14 is a rotated Koebe function.

The condition of de Branges&#x27; theorem is not sufficient to show the function is schlicht, as the function
:formula_24
shows: it is holomorphic on the unit disc and satisfies formula_25 for all formula_7, but it is not injective since
formula_27.

==History ==
A survey of the history is given by Koepf (2007).

 proved formula_28, and stated the conjecture that formula_25. and independently proved the conjecture for starlike functions.
Then Charles Loewner () proved formula_30, using the Löwner equation. His work was used by most later attempts, and is also applied in the theory of Schramm–Loewner evolution.

 proved that formula_31 for all formula_7, showing that the Bieberbach conjecture is true up to a factor of formula_33 Several authors later reduced the constant in the inequality below formula_34.
If formula_35 is a schlicht function then formula_36 is an odd schlicht function. 
 showed that its Taylor coefficients satisfy formula_37 for all formula_38. They conjectured that formula_39 can be replaced by formula_19 as a natural generalization of the Bieberbach conjecture. The Littlewood–Paley conjecture easily implies the Bieberbach conjecture using the Cauchy inequality, but it was soon disproved by , who showed there is an odd schlicht function with formula_41, and that this is the maximum possible value of formula_42. Isaak Milin later showed that formula_39 can be replaced by formula_44, and Hayman showed that the numbers formula_45 have a limit less than formula_19 if formula_14 is not a Koebe function (for which the formula_48 are all formula_19). So the limit is always less than or equal to formula_19, meaning that Littlewood and Paley&#x27;s conjecture is true for all but a finite number of coefficients. A weaker form of Littlewood and Paley&#x27;s conjecture was found by .

The Robertson conjecture states that if

:formula_51

is an odd schlicht function in the unit disk with formula_52 then for all positive integers formula_7, 
:formula_54

Robertson observed that his conjecture is still strong enough to imply the Bieberbach conjecture, and proved it for formula_55. This conjecture introduced the key idea of bounding various quadratic functions of the coefficients rather than the coefficients themselves, which is equivalent to bounding norms of elements in certain Hilbert spaces of schlicht functions.

There were several proofs of the Bieberbach conjecture for certain higher values of formula_7, in particular proved formula_57, and proved formula_58, and proved formula_59.

 proved that the limit of formula_60 exists, and has absolute value less than formula_19 unless formula_14 is a Koebe function. In particular this showed that for any formula_14 there can be at most a finite number of exceptions to the Bieberbach conjecture.

The Milin conjecture states that for each schlicht function on the unit disk, and for all positive integers formula_7, 
:formula_65

where the logarithmic coefficients formula_66 of formula_14 are given by

:formula_68
 showed using the Lebedev–Milin inequality that the Milin conjecture (later proved by de Branges) implies the Robertson conjecture and therefore the Bieberbach conjecture.

Finally proved formula_25 for all formula_7.

==De Branges&#x27;s proof==
The proof uses a type of Hilbert space of entire functions. The study of these spaces grew into a sub-field of complex analysis and the spaces have come to be called de Branges spaces. De Branges proved the stronger Milin conjecture on logarithmic coefficients. This was already known to imply the Robertson conjecture about odd univalent functions, which in turn was known to imply the Bieberbach conjecture about schlicht functions . His proof uses the Loewner equation, the Askey–Gasper inequality about Jacobi polynomials, and the Lebedev–Milin inequality on exponentiated power series.

De Branges reduced the conjecture to some inequalities for Jacobi polynomials, and verified the first few by hand. Walter Gautschi verified more of these inequalities by computer for de Branges (proving the Bieberbach conjecture for the first 30 or so coefficients) and then asked Richard Askey whether he knew of any similar inequalities. Askey pointed out that had proved the necessary inequalities eight years before, which allowed de Branges to complete his proof. The first version was very long and had some minor mistakes which caused some skepticism about it, but these were corrected with the help of members of the Leningrad seminar on Geometric Function Theory (Leningrad Department of Steklov Mathematical Institute) when de Branges visited in 1984.

De Branges proved the following result, which for formula_71 implies the Milin conjecture (and therefore the Bieberbach conjecture). 
Suppose that formula_72 and formula_73 are real numbers for positive integers formula_7 with limit formula_75 and such that
:formula_76
is non-negative, non-increasing, and has limit formula_75. Then for all Riemann mapping functions formula_78 univalent in the unit disk with
:formula_79
the maximum value of 
:formula_80
is achieved by the Koebe function formula_81.

A simplified version of the proof was published in 1985 by Carl FitzGerald and Christian Pommerenke (), and an even shorter description by Jacob Korevaar (). A very short proof avoiding use of the inequalities of Askey and Gasper was later found by Lenard Weinstein ().

<doc id="252076" wikidata="Q127244" url="?curid=252076" title="Gδ set">
<text>In the mathematical field of topology, a Gδ set is a subset of a topological space that is a countable intersection of open sets. The notation originated from the German nouns and .
Historically Gδ sets were also called inner limiting sets, but that terminology is not in use anymore.
Gδ sets, and their dual, F sets, are the second level of the Borel hierarchy.

==Definition==

In a topological space a Gδ set is a countable intersection of open sets. The Gδ sets are exactly the level Π sets of the Borel hierarchy.

==Examples==

* Any open set is trivially a Gδ set.
* The irrational numbers are a Gδ set in the real numbers formula_1. They can be written as the countable intersection of the open sets formula_2 (the superscript denoting the complement) where formula_3 is rational.
* The set of rational numbers formula_4 is a Gδ set in formula_1. If formula_4 were the intersection of open sets formula_7 each formula_7 would be dense in formula_1 because formula_4 is dense in formula_1. However, the construction above gave the irrational numbers as a countable intersection of open dense subsets. Taking the intersection of both of these sets gives the empty set as a countable intersection of open dense sets in formula_1, a violation of the Baire category theorem.
* The continuity set of any real valued function is a Gδ subset of its domain (see the &quot;Properties&quot; section for a more general statement).
* The zero-set of a derivative of an everywhere differentiable real-valued function on formula_1 is a Gδ set; it can be a dense set with empty interior, as shown by Pompeiu&#x27;s construction.
* The set of functions in formula_14 not differentiable at any point within contains a dense Gδ subset of the metric space formula_14. (See .)

==Properties==

The notion of Gδ sets in metric (and topological) spaces is related to the notion of completeness of the metric space as well as to the Baire category theorem. See the result about completely metrizable spaces in the list of properties below. formula_16 sets and their complements are also of importance in real analysis, especially measure theory.

=== Basic properties ===
* The complement of a Gδ set is an Fσ set, and vice versa.
* The intersection of countably many Gδ sets is a Gδ set.
* The union of many Gδ sets is a Gδ set.
* A countable union of Gδ sets (which would be called a Gδσ set) is not a Gδ set in general. For example, the rational numbers formula_4 do not form a Gδ set in formula_1.
* In a topological space, the zero set of every real valued continuous function formula_19 is a (closed) Gδ set, since formula_20 is the intersection of the open sets formula_21, formula_22.
* In a metrizable space, every closed set is a Gδ set and, dually, every open set is an Fσ set. Indeed, a closed set formula_23 is the zero set of the continuous function formula_24, where formula_25 indicates the distance from a point to a set. The same holds in pseudometrizable spaces.
* In a first countable T1 space, every singleton is a Gδ set.
* A subspace of a completely metrizable space formula_26 is itself completely metrizable if and only if it is a Gδ set in formula_26.
* A subspace of a Polish space formula_26 is itself Polish if and only if it is a Gδ set in formula_26. This follows from the previous result about completely metrizable subspaces and the fact that every subspace of a separable metric space is separable.
* A topological space formula_26 is Polish if and only if it is homeomorphic to a Gδ subset of a compact metric space.

=== Continuity set of real valued functions ===

The set of points where a function formula_19 from a topological space to a metric space is continuous is a formula_16 set. This is because continuity at a point formula_33 can be defined by a formula_34 formula, namely: For all positive integers formula_35 there is an open set formula_36 containing formula_33 such that formula_38 for all formula_39 in formula_36. If a value of formula_41 is fixed, the set of formula_33 for which there is such a corresponding open formula_36 is itself an open set (being a union of open sets), and the universal quantifier on formula_41 corresponds to the (countable) intersection of these sets. As a consequence, while it is possible for the irrationals to be the set of continuity points of a function (see the popcorn function), it is impossible to construct a function that is continuous only on the rational numbers.

In the real line, the converse holds as well; for any Gδ subset formula_45 of the real line, there is a function formula_46 that is continuous exactly at the points in formula_45.

==Gδ space==

A Gδ space is a topological space in which every closed set is a Gδ set. A normal space that is also a Gδ space is called perfectly normal. For example, every metrizable space is perfectly normal.

<text>In computing, the Windows Driver Model (WDM) also known at one point as the Win32 Driver Model is a framework for device drivers that was introduced with Windows 98 and Windows 2000 to replace VxD, which was used on older versions of Windows such as Windows 95 and Windows 3.1, as well as the Windows NT Driver Model.

==Overview==
WDM drivers are layered in a stack and communicate with each other via I/O request packets (IRPs). The Microsoft Windows Driver Model unified driver models for the Windows 9x and Windows NT product lines by standardizing requirements and reducing the amount of code that needed to be written. WDM drivers will not run on operating systems earlier than Windows 98 or Windows 2000, such as Windows 95 (before the OSR2 update that sideloads the WDM model), Windows NT 4.0 and Windows 3.1. By conforming to WDM, drivers can be binary compatible and source-compatible across Windows 98, Windows 98 Second Edition, Windows Me, Windows 2000, Windows XP, Windows Server 2003 and Windows Vista (for backwards compatibility) on x86-based computers. WDM drivers are designed to be forward-compatible so that a WDM driver can run on a version of Windows newer than what the driver was initially written for, but doing that would mean that the driver cannot take advantage of any new features introduced with the new version. WDM is generally not backward-compatible, that is, a WDM driver is not guaranteed to run on any older version of Windows. For example, Windows XP can use a driver written for Windows 2000 but will not make use of any of the new WDM features that were introduced in Windows XP. However, a driver written for Windows XP may or may not load on Windows 2000.

WDM exists in the intermediary layer of Windows 2000 kernel-mode drivers and was introduced to increase the functionality and ease of writing drivers for Windows. Although WDM was mainly designed to be binary and source compatible between Windows 98 and Windows 2000, this may not always be desired and so specific drivers can be developed for either operating system.

===Device kernel-mode drivers===
With the Windows Drivers Model (WDM) for devices Microsoft implements an approach to kernel mode drivers that is unique to Windows operating systems. WDM implements a layered architecture for device drivers, and every device of a computer is served by a stack of drivers. However, every driver in that stack can chain isolate hardware-independent features from the driver above and beneath it. So drivers in the stack do not need to interact directly with one another. WDM defines architecture and device procedures for a range of devices, such as display and the network card, known as Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS). In the NDIS architecture the layered network drivers include lower-level drivers that manage the hardware and upper-level drivers that implement network data transport, such as the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP).

While WDM defines three types of device drivers, not all driver stacks for a given device contain all types of device drivers. The three WDM device driver types are:

Bus driver: For every bus on the mainboard there is a one bus driver, with the primary responsibility for the identification of all devices connected to that bus and responding to plug and play events. Microsoft will provide bus drivers as part of the operating system, such as PCI, PnPISA, SCSI, USB and FireWire.

Function driver: this is the principal driver for a device and it provides the operational interface for a device by handling read and write operations. Function drivers are written by the device vendors, and for their interaction with the hardware they depend on a specific bus driver being present in the Windows operating system.

Filter driver: This driver is optional, and can modify the behaviour of a device, such as input and output requests. These drivers can be implemented as lower-level and upper-level filter drivers.

===Object-oriented driver stack===
Function drivers and bus drivers are often implemented as driver/minidriver pairs, which in practice is either a class or miniclass, or a port or miniport pair.

Bus drivers for devices attached to a bus are implemented as class drivers and are hardware-agnostic. They will support the operations of a certain type of device. Windows operating systems include a number of class drivers, such as the kbdclass.sys driver for keyboards. Miniclass drivers on the other hand are supplied by the vendor of a device, and only support device specific operations, for a particular device of a given class.

Port drivers support general input/output (I/O) operations for a peripheral hardware interface. The core functionality of port drivers is mandated by the operating system, and Windows operating systems integrate a variety of port drivers. For example, the i8042prt.sys port driver for the 8042 microcontroller connects PS/2 keyboards to the mainboard peripheral bus. The miniport drivers, like the miniclass drivers, are supplied by the hardware vendors and support only device specific operations of peripheral hardware that is connected to a port on the mainboard.

Each driver that processes an I/O request for a device has a corresponding object, which is loaded into main memory. A device object is created by the Windows operating system from the associated device class. Device objects contain structures of type DEVICE_OBJECT, which store pointers to their driver. At run time these pointers are used to locate a driver&#x27;s dispatch routine and member functions. In the WDM driver stack, the filter driver device object, known as the upper filter, will receive an I/O request packet (IRP) for a device from the I/O manager. If the upper filter driver can not serve the request, it will locate the object of the driver one step down in the driver stack. The IRP is passed down the driver stack by calling the function IoCallDriver(), and processed by the function driver device object, also known as functional device object. The function driver device object in turn may pass the IRP to the lower filter, another filter device object. Then the IRP may be passed down to the bus driver, which operates as the physical device object. The bus driver object is at the bottom of the driver stack, and interacts with the hardware abstraction layer, which is part of the Windows operating system kernel and allows Windows operating systems to run on a variety of processors, different memory management unit architectures, and a variety of computer systems with different I/O bus architectures. The execution of an IRP is finished when any of the driver objects in the stack returns the request back to the I/O manager, with the result and a status flag.

== Device drivers for different Windows operating systems ==
The WDM framework was developed by Microsoft to simplify the communication between the operating system and drivers inside the kernel. In Windows operating systems, drivers are implemented as Dynamic Link Libraries .DLL or .SYS files. WDM compliant drivers must follow rules of design, initialisation, plug-and-play, power management and memory allocation. In practice WDM driver programmers reuse large pieces of code when building new object-oriented drivers. This means that drivers in the WDM stack may contain residual functionality, which is not documented in specifications. Drivers that have passed the Microsoft quality test are digitally signed by Microsoft. The Microsoft Hardware Compatibility Tests and the Driver Development Kit include reliability and stress tests.

A device driver that is not designed for a specific hardware component may allow another device to function. This is because the basic functionality of a hardware device class is similar. The functionality of the video card class, for example, allows the Microsoft Basic Display Adapter driver to work with a wide variety of video cards. However, installing the wrong driver for a device will mean that the full functionality of the device can not be used, and may result in poor performance and the destabilization of the Windows operating system. Hardware device vendors may release updated device drivers for particular Windows operating systems, to improve performance, add functionality or fix bugs. If a device is not working as expected the latest device drivers should be downloaded from the vendor website and installed.

Device drivers are designed for particular Windows operating system versions, and device drivers for a previous version of Windows may not work correctly or at all with other versions. Because many device drivers run in kernel mode installing drivers for a previous operating system version may destabilise the Windows operating system. Migrating a computer to a higher version of a Windows operating system therefore requires that new device drivers are installed for all hardware components. Finding up to date device drivers and installing them for Windows 10 has introduced complications into the migration process.

Common device driver compatibility issues include: a 32-bit device driver is required for a 32-bit Windows operating system, and a 64-bit device driver is required for a 64-bit Windows operating system. 64-bit device drivers must be signed by Microsoft, because they run in kernel mode and have unrestricted access to the computer hardware. For operating systems prior to Windows 10 Microsoft allowed vendors to sign their 64-bit drivers themselves, assuming vendors had undertaken compatibility tests. However, Windows 10 64-bit drivers now need to be signed by Microsoft. Therefore, device vendors have to submit their drivers to Microsoft for testing and approval. The driver installation package includes all files in the .inf directory, and all files in the package need to be installed, otherwise the installation of the device driver may fail. For operating system versions before Windows 10 not all files necessary for the driver installation were included in the package, as this requirement was not consistently enforced. Some device driver installers have a user interface GUI, often requiring user configuration input. The absence of a user interface does not mean that the installation of the device driver is not successful. Besides, Windows 10 device drivers are not allowed to include a user interface. The Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) 10.x is used for network devices by the Windows 10 operating system. Network device drivers for Windows XP use NDIS 5.x and may work with subsequent Windows operating systems, but for performance reasons network device drivers should implement NDIS 6.0 or higher. Similarly, WDDM is the driver model for Windows Vista and up, which replaces XPDM used in graphics drivers.

== Device Manager ==
The Device Manager is a Control Panel applet in Microsoft Windows operating systems. It allows users to view and control the hardware attached to the computer. It allows users to view and modify hardware device properties, and is also the primary tool to manage device drivers.

==Criticism==
The Windows Driver Model, while a significant improvement over the VxD and Windows NT Driver Model used before it, has been criticised by driver software developers, most significantly for the following:
* Interactions with power management events and plug and play are difficult. This can lead to situations where Windows machines cannot enter or exit sleep modes correctly due to bugs in driver code.
* I/O cancellation is difficult to get right.
* Complex boilerplate support code is required for every driver.
* There is no support for writing pure user-mode drivers.

There were also a number of concerns about the quality of documentation and samples that Microsoft provided.

Because of these issues, Microsoft has released a new set of frameworks on top of WDM, called the Windows Driver Frameworks (WDF; formerly Windows Driver Foundation), which includes Kernel-Mode Driver Framework (KMDF) and User-Mode Driver Framework (UMDF). Windows Vista supports both pure WDM and the newer WDF. KMDF is also available for download for Windows XP and even Windows 2000, while UMDF is available for Windows XP and above.

<doc id="252079" wikidata="Q4688262" url="?curid=252079" title="Sexual norm">
<text>A sexual norm can refer to a personal or a social norm. Most cultures have social norms regarding sexuality, and define &quot;normal sexuality&quot; to consist only of certain sex acts between individuals who meet specific age criteria, nonconsanguinity (vs. incest), race/ethnicity (vs. interracial relationships), and/or social role and socioeconomic status.

In most societies, the term &quot;normal&quot; identifies a range or spectrum of behaviors. Rather than each act being simply classified as &quot;acceptable&quot; or &quot;not acceptable&quot;, many acts are viewed as &quot;more or less accepted&quot; by different people, and the opinion on how normal or acceptable they are greatly depends on the individual making the opinion as well as the culture itself. Based on information gained from sexological studies, a great many ordinary people&#x27;s sex lives are very often quite different from popular beliefs about &quot;normal&quot;, in private.

If non-restrictive sexual norms are regarded positively, they may be called &quot;sexual freedom&quot;, &quot;sexual liberation&quot; or &quot;free love&quot;. If they are regarded negatively, they may be called &quot;sexual licence&quot; or &quot;licentiousness&quot;. Restrictive social norms, if judged negatively, are called &quot;sexual oppression&quot;. If the restrictive norms are judged positively, they may be regarded as encouraging chastity, &quot;sexual self-restraint&quot; or &quot;sexual decency&quot;, and negative terms are used for the targeted sexuality, e.g. &quot;sexual abuse&quot; and &quot;perversion&quot;.

==Social attitudes==
In the West, some people have relaxed the traditional definitions of normality, choosing instead to define normal sexuality as any sexual practice which does not involve what are regarded as sexual perversions. However, using this definition makes use of a long list of sexual perversions which themselves show up hidden assumptions about cultural norms. Recently, in Western society, consensual paraphilias are becoming more acceptable, in particular &quot;any activity, not otherwise illegal, performed between consenting adults in private.&quot;

This liberalization of attitudes has resulted in the decriminalisation of homosexuality in many countries, following the ground-breaking Wolfenden report in the United Kingdom.

There is a tendency in Western countries towards serial monogamy as a normal heterosexual lifestyle. There is also a movement towards recognizing long-term homosexual relationships (&quot;see same-sex marriage&quot;).

There is also greater acceptance of sexual relationships (partnerships) without requiring the sanction of a form of marriage recognised by the church, state or legal system.

These liberalizing trends can be contrasted with conservative social trends that seek to reverse these patterns of behaviour, with encouragement for young people to choose traditionally accepted roles, beliefs and behaviors, and to exercise sexual abstinence or non-promiscuous lifestyles before marriage.

There is an opposing trend in reaction, that views such changes as a socially destructive force, and is opposed to them. It is often, though not exclusively, associated with people who have religious feelings, and is prevalent in much of Christianity in America, as well as Islam in the Middle East and Asia, and other devout religious groups such as Haredi Jews in Israel. In such countries there is often strong criticism of non-traditional sexualities and sexual liberation.

Some social unrest in both Eastern and Western cultures is due to this conflict between these two trends, and views upon acceptability and control of social and sexual norms.

<doc id="252081" wikidata="Q183679" url="?curid=252081" title="Tsung-Dao Lee">
<text>Tsung-Dao Lee (; November 24, 1926 – August 4, 2024) was a Chinese-American physicist, known for his work on parity violation, the Lee–Yang theorem, particle physics, relativistic heavy ion (RHIC) physics, nontopological solitons, and soliton stars. He was a university professor emeritus at Columbia University in New York City, where he taught from 1953 until his retirement in 2012.

In 1957, at the age of 30, Lee won the Nobel Prize in Physics with Chen Ning Yang for their work on the violation of the parity law in weak interactions, which Chien-Shiung Wu experimentally proved from 1956 to 1957, with her well known Wu experiment.

Lee remains the youngest Nobel laureate in the science fields after World War II. He is the third-youngest Nobel laureate in sciences in history after William L. Bragg (who won the prize at 25 with his father William H. Bragg in 1915) and Werner Heisenberg (who won in 1932 also at 30). Lee and Yang were the first Chinese laureates. Since he became a naturalized American citizen in 1962, Lee is also the youngest American ever to have won a Nobel Prize.

== Biography ==
=== Family ===
Lee was born in Shanghai, China, with his ancestral home in nearby Suzhou. His father Chun-kang Lee (), one of the first graduates of the University of Nanking, was a chemical industrialist and merchant who was involved in China&#x27;s early development of modern synthesized fertilizer. Lee&#x27;s grandfather Chong-tan Lee () was the first Chinese Methodist Episcopal senior pastor of St. John&#x27;s Church in Suzhou (蘇州聖約翰堂).

Lee has four brothers and one sister. Educator Robert C. T. Lee was one of T. D.&#x27;s brothers. Lee&#x27;s mother Chang and brother Robert C. T. moved to Taiwan in the 1950s.

=== Early life ===
Lee received his secondary education in Shanghai (High School Affiliated to Soochow University, 東吳大學附屬中學) and Jiangxi (Jiangxi Joint High School, 江西聯合中學). Due to the Second Sino-Japanese war, Lee&#x27;s high school education was interrupted, thus he did not obtain his secondary diploma. Nevertheless, in 1943, Lee directly applied to and was admitted by the National Chekiang University (now Zhejiang University). Initially, Lee registered as a student in the Department of Chemical Engineering. Very quickly, Lee&#x27;s talent was discovered and his interest in physics grew rapidly. Several physics professors, including Shu Xingbei and Wang Ganchang, largely guided Lee, and he soon transferred into the Department of Physics of National Che Kiang University, where he studied in 1943–1944.

However, again disrupted by a further Japanese invasion, Lee continued at the National Southwestern Associated University in Kunming the next year in 1945, where he studied with Professor Wu Ta-You.

=== Life and research in the U.S.===
Professor Wu nominated Lee for a Chinese government fellowship for graduate study in the United States. In 1946, Lee went to the University of Chicago and was selected by Professor Enrico Fermi to become his PhD student. Lee received his PhD under Fermi in 1950 for his research work &quot;Hydrogen Content of White Dwarf Stars&quot;. Lee served as research associate and lecturer in physics at the University of California at Berkeley from 1950 to 1951.

In 1953, Lee joined Columbia University, where he remained until retirement. His first work at Columbia was on a solvable model of quantum field theory better known as the Lee model. Soon, his focus turned to particle physics and the developing puzzle of K meson decays. Lee realized in early 1956 that the key to the puzzle was parity non-conservation. At Lee&#x27;s suggestion, the first experimental test was on hyperon decay by the Steinberger group. At that time, the experimental result gave only an indication of a 2 standard deviation effect of possible parity violation. Encouraged by this feasibility study, Lee made a systematic study of possible Time reversal (T), Parity (P), Charge Conjugation (C), and CP violations in weak interactions with collaborators, including C. N. Yang. After the definitive experimental confirmation by Chien-Shiung Wu and her assistants that showed that parity was not conserved, Lee and Yang were awarded the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics. Wu was not awarded the Nobel prize, which is considered one of the largest controversies in Nobel committee history.

In the early 1960s, Lee and collaborators initiated the important field of high-energy neutrino physics. In 1964, Lee, with M. Nauenberg, analyzed the divergences connected with particles of zero rest mass, and described a general method known as the KLN theorem for dealing with these divergences, which still plays an important role in contemporary work in QCD, with its massless, self-interacting gluons. In 1974–75, Lee published several papers on &quot;A New Form of Matter in High Density&quot;, which led to the modern field of RHIC physics, now dominating the entire high-energy nuclear physics field.

Besides particle physics, Lee was active in statistical mechanics, astrophysics, hydrodynamics, many body system, solid state, and lattice QCD. In 1983, Lee wrote a paper entitled, &quot;Can Time Be a Discrete Dynamical Variable?&quot;; which led to a series of publications by Lee and collaborators on the formulation of fundamental physics in terms of difference equations, but with exact invariance under continuous groups of translational and rotational transformations. Beginning in 1975, Lee and collaborators established the field of non-topological solitons, which led to his work on soliton stars and black holes throughout the 1980s and 1990s.

From 1997 to 2003, Lee was director of the RIKEN-BNL Research Center (now director emeritus), which together with other researchers from Columbia, completed a 1 teraflops supercomputer QCDSP for lattice QCD in 1998 and a 10 teraflops QCDOC machine in 2001. Leading up to 2005, Lee and Richard M. Friedberg developed a new method to solve the Schrödinger equation, leading to convergent iterative solutions for the long-standing quantum degenerate double-wall potential and other instanton problems. They also did work on the neutrino mapping matrix.

Lee was one of the 20 American recipients of the Nobel Prize in Physics to sign a letter addressed to President George W. Bush in May 2008, urging him to &quot;reverse the damage done to basic science research in the Fiscal Year 2008 Omnibus Appropriations Bill&quot; by requesting additional emergency funding for the Department of Energy&#x27;s Office of Science, the National Science Foundation, and the National Institute of Standards and Technology.

== Educational activities ==

Soon after the re-establishment of China-American relations with the PRC, Lee and his wife, Jeannette Hui-Chun Chin (), were able to go to the PRC, where Lee gave a series of lectures and seminars, and organized the CUSPEA (China-U.S. Physics Examination and Application).

In 1998, Lee established the Chun-Tsung Endowment (秦惠䇹—李政道中国大学生见习基金) in memory of his wife, who had died three years earlier. The Chun-Tsung scholarships, supervised by the United Board for Christian Higher Education in Asia (New York), are awarded to undergraduates, usually in their 2nd or 3rd year, at six universities, which are Shanghai Jiaotong University, Fudan University, Lanzhou University, Soochow University, Peking University, and Tsinghua University. Students selected for such scholarships are named &quot;Chun-Tsung Scholars&quot; (䇹政学者).

== Personal life and death ==
Lee and Jeannette Hui-Chun Chin married in 1950 and had two sons: James Lee () and Stephen Lee (). His wife died in 1996.

Tsung-Dao Lee died in San Francisco on August 4, 2024, at the age of 97.

<text>The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) is the national trade union centre in Scotland. With 40 affiliated unions as of 2020, the STUC represents over 540,000 trade unionists.

The STUC is a separate organisation from the English and Welsh Trades Union Congress (TUC), having been established in 1897 as a result of a political dispute with the TUC regarding political representation for the Labour movement.

The current General Secretary of the Scottish Trades Union Congress is Rozanne Foyer.

==Administrative history==
The Scottish Trades Union Congress (STUC) is a completely independent and autonomous trade union centre for Scotland. It is not a Scottish regional organisation of the Trades Union Congress (TUC). It was established in 1897 largely as a result of a political dispute with the TUC regarding political representation for the Labour movement. A number of meetings were held by the various Scottish trades councils to discuss the situation, resulting in the formation of the STUC in Glasgow, Scotland, in March 1897. From the outset, the STUC was not in competition with the TUC, nor was it a political movement, but sought to ensure that &quot;in any scheme for the government of Scotland provision should be made for the same industrial legislation being applied throughout Great Britain.&quot; Close contact was retained with the TUC with reciprocal arrangements existing for mutual assistance and co-operation when the occasion warranted.

The STUC originally had a rented office at 58 Renfield Street, Glasgow, Scotland, in a building belonging to the Scottish Council for Women&#x27;s Trades. Between 1900 and 1949 the STUC had offices in various locations in Glasgow city centre and the Govanhill area of Glasgow before moving to Woodlands Terrace in the west end of the city in 1949. In 1998, the offices moved to Woodlands Road.

The Annual Congress is the Governing Body of the STUC. From the earliest days, the Congress concerned itself with a wide range of economic and social questions, lobbying British Members of Parliament, and from 1999 the Scottish Parliament and executive, on major issues. Hours and conditions of work and the battles around these issues were always a central preoccupation of the Congress, but it also concerned itself with wider issues such as international affairs, housing, education, transport, peace, racism, and social and economic issues, as well as promoting and supporting joint trades union councils (later renamed trade union councils).

The struggle for independent working class political representation was one of the concerns on which the Congress was founded and in 1900, the Congress was instrumental in establishing the Scottish Workers&#x27; Parliamentary Election Committee, a forerunner of the Scottish Council of the Labour Party, which would nominate and support candidates for Parliamentary elections. The Congress was also involved with the Scottish Workers&#x27; Representation Committee which continued to function until 1909 when its duties were taken over by the national Labour Party. A Scottish Council of the Labour Party was formed in 1915. Despite this involvement in the process which established the Labour Party, the STUC is not, and has never been, affiliated to any political party.

The STUC has always had active women members. In 1897 a female delegate, Margaret Irwin, obtained the highest vote in the election of the first Parliamentary Committee (later renamed the General Council), the governing body of the Congress. She was nominated for chairman but declined nomination on the grounds that to appoint a woman chairman at that time was too premature. However, she acted as the Parliamentary Secretary and was also Secretary of the Scottish Council for Women&#x27;s Trade. The first female President, Bell Jobson, presided at the 1937 Congress. In 1926, the Organisation of Women Committee (later the Women&#x27;s Advisory Committee, now the Women’s Committee) was established by the Congress, specialising in issues relating particularly to women.

In 1937 the Congress agreed a motion to establish youth fellowships as a way of attracting young people to join the unions, and therefore encourage union membership regardless of sex or age. It was realised that to create separate youth fellowships was restrictive, suggesting that the old and young should work separately. Therefore, in 1938, it was decided to establish the Trade Union Youth Advisory Committee (now called the Youth Committee) encouraging youth sections within the existing unions. The Committee is elected by an annual conference of young trade unionists that deals with youth related issues, and elects a delegation to the Annual Congress which submits three motions and amendments like other affiliates. It also organises day and weekend schools and other activities for young trade unionists.

From the 1930s onwards, probably the most important concern of the Congress has been the Scottish economy. The STUC has played its part in the legend of Red Clydeside 1910-1922; the period of militancy and protest by the working people of Glasgow and elsewhere. It has played a role in many historic struggles of the Scottish people including the General Strike of 1926, the post-war reconstruction of Scottish industry, and more recent events like the Upper Clyde Shipbuilders work-in of 1971–1972, the 1984–1985 miners&#x27; strike and the defeat of the poll tax in the early 1990s. The Congress was instrumental in bringing the motor industry to Bathgate and Linwood, Scotland, in the 1960s the STUC played a central role for many decades in the campaign which established the Scottish Parliament.

By 1947 the STUC consisted of 83 affiliated trades unions with a membership of 671,630. In addition, 51 trades councils were affiliated. Membership was made up of members of the Scottish unions and Scottish members of unions covering the British Isles. The period 1977 to 1980 saw membership of the STUC peak to over one million with 80 affiliated unions and 45 trades union councils. A gradual decline of membership then occurred to a total of 634,797 in 2001 with 46 affiliated unions and 33 trades union councils. In 2013, the STUC represented over 630,000 trade unionists, the members of 37 affiliated trade unions and 20 Trades Union Councils.

The focal point of the STUC is its Annual Congress held in April and attended by delegates from affiliated organisations. It is the Annual Congress which sets down the policy of the STUC and which elects the General Council (known as the Parliamentary Committee until 1923). Between Congresses, it is the General Council which implements policy. The affiliates are divided into seven sections: transport, mining and distribution; steel, engineering and electrical; manufacturing; municipal, general and building; financial, scientific and technical services; civil and public services; education and cultural services; and trades union councils. Each of these sections is represented on the General Council (with a number of places in each section reserved for representatives of women workers), approximately on the basis of its proportion of the total STUC membership. There are also two places on the General Council for representatives of black workers, and two places for representatives of young (under the age of 26) workers. Whilst the General Council is elected by the whole of Congress, candidates are restricted to standing for election to the section to which their organisation belongs.

In 2020, the STUC moved to temporary accommodation in Rutherglen before its planned move to a new build premises in Landressy Street, Bridgeton, Glasgow in early 2021.

<doc id="252090" wikidata="Q2731224" url="?curid=252090" title="Learning English (version of English)">
<text>Learning English (previously known as Special English) is a controlled version of the English language first used on October 19, 1959, and still presented daily by the United States broadcasting service Voice of America (VOA). World news and other programs are read one-third slower than regular VOA English. Reporters avoid idioms and use a core vocabulary of about 1500 words, plus any terms needed to explain a story. The intended audience is intermediate to advanced learners of English. In 1962 the VOA published the first edition of the Word Book.

VOA has teamed up with the University of Oregon and produced free online training &quot;Let’s Teach English&quot; for English language educators. The series is based on the &quot;Women Teaching Women English&quot; and is aimed for adult beginning level learners&quot;.&quot;

== Examples ==
VOA Learning English has multiple daily newscasts and 14 weekly features. These include reports on agriculture, economics, health and current events. Other programs explore American society, U.S. history, idiomatic expressions, science, and arts and entertainment.

For example, a May 18, 2010, script described rheumatoid arthritis this way:

A program from July 15, 2010, dealt with patent law:

A remembrance of Michael Jackson aired on July 5, 2009, shortly after his death:

For English learners, the service not only provides clear and simple news and information, it also helps them improve their use of American English. In some countries such as the People&#x27;s Republic of China, VOA Special English is increasingly popular for junior and intermediate English learners. Many teachers around the world, including at the university level, use the programs for language and content.

The BBC and China Radio International have both used the name &quot;Special English&quot; for their slow speed English broadcasts, but they do not appear to have applied the full methodology of the VOA original.

==Specialized English==
Specialized English is a dialect of Special English developed and used by Feba Radio, and now used by staff in the U.S. and in the U.K. The same parameters apply as for Special English — slow speed, short sentences and restricted vocabulary. The word list has over 90% commonality with that of VOA Special English.

<text>Carlos Gardel (born Charles Romuald Gardès; 11 December 1890 – 24 June 1935) was a French-born Argentine singer, songwriter, composer and actor, and the most prominent figure in the history of tango. He was one of the most influential interpreters of world popular music in the first half of the 20th century. Gardel is the most famous popular tango singer of all time and is recognized throughout the world. Described variously as a baritone or tenor because of his wide vocal range, he was known for his rich voice and dramatic phrasing. Together with lyricist and long-time collaborator Alfredo Le Pera, Gardel wrote several classic tangos.

Gardel died in an airplane crash at the height of his career, becoming an archetypal tragic hero mourned throughout Latin America. For many, Gardel embodies the soul of the tango style. He is commonly referred to as &quot;Carlitos&quot;, &quot;El Zorzal&quot; (&quot;The Song thrush&quot;), &quot;The King of Tango&quot;, &quot;El Mago&quot; (The Wizard), &quot;El Morocho del Abasto&quot; (The Brunette boy from Abasto), and ironically &quot;El Mudo&quot; (The Mute).

In 1967, a controversial theory was published by Uruguayan writer Erasmo Silva Cabrera, asserting that Gardel was born in Tacuarembó, Uruguay. Other authors expanded upon this theory, and a museum to Gardel was established in Tacuarembó. But Gardel&#x27;s friends and family all knew him as a French immigrant from Toulouse. Scholarly researchers analyzed the contradictory evidence, especially French birth and baptismal records, and confirmed his birthplace as Toulouse.

==Biography==

===Early life===
Gardel was born to unmarried 25-year-old laundress Berthe Gardès, the baby registered under the name Charles Romuald Gardès in Toulouse, France, on 11 December 1890. The father of the baby boy was listed on his birth certificate as &quot;unknown&quot;, but 11 days later Berthe Gardès signed a statement establishing the baby&#x27;s father as Paul Laserre, a married man who left Toulouse a few months before the baby was born. Berthe Gardès also left Toulouse, a little over a year later, likely to escape the social stigma of having a child born out of wedlock. In early 1893 in Bordeaux, France, mother and son boarded the ship SS &quot;Don Pedro&quot; and sailed to Buenos Aires, arriving on 11 March 1893. Berthe Gardès had her passport recorded upon arrival; she told immigration authorities that she was a widow. The two-year-old boy was recorded as Charles Gardès.

Gardel&#x27;s mother settled at the western edge of the central San Nicolás district of Buenos Aires, at Calle Uruguay 162. She worked two blocks away on Calle Montevideo, pressing clothes in the French style, which commanded a relatively high price in the fashion-conscious city. Gardel grew up speaking Spanish, not French, with friends and family calling him Carlos, the Spanish version of his French name, and often by the familiar diminutive form Carlitos.

Some time after 1918, Laserre traveled from France to Buenos Aires to ask Berthe Gardès, now called Doña Berta, whether she would like to legitimize her son by marrying Laserre. This would have disrupted her story about being a widow. Gardel told his mother that if she did not need this man in her life, neither did he, closing the matter with &quot;I don&#x27;t even wish to see him.&quot; By this time Gardes had already altered his surname to the more Spanish-sounding &quot;Gardel.&quot;

===Career===
Gardel began his singing career in bars and at private parties. He also sang with Francisco Martino and later in a trio with Martino and José Razzano. Gardel created the &quot;tango-canción&quot; in 1917 with his rendition of Pascual Contursi and Samuel Castriota&#x27;s &quot;Mi noche triste&quot;. The recording sold 10,000 copies and was a hit throughout Latin America.

Gardel went on tour through Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Brazil, Puerto Rico, Venezuela and Colombia, as well as making appearances in Paris, New York, Barcelona and Madrid. He sold 70,000 records in the first three months of a 1928 visit to Paris. As his popularity grew, he made a number of films for Paramount in France and the U.S. While sentimental films such as &quot;Cuesta abajo&quot; (1934) and &quot;El día que me quieras&quot; (1935) lack lasting dramatic value, they were outstanding showcases of his tremendous singing talents and movie star looks.

===Romantic life===
Gardel was aware of the fact that much of his popularity was based on his attractiveness to women. In an effort to seem as if he were available to any woman, he sought to keep his love life secret. Gardel had one major girlfriend in his life: Isabel del Valle. He met del Valle in late 1920 when she was fourteen years of age. At the time, he was performing at the Esmeralda Theater in Buenos Aires. They were close for more than a decade. Gardel and del Valle were not seen together very often in public. Gardel&#x27;s mother and del Valle&#x27;s family helped make sure the relationship was not well known. Only Gardel&#x27;s closest friends knew about it.

Gardel arranged for del Valle to have a house; he provided money for her to live on. Around 1930 the relationship began to degrade. Gardel had his lawyer stop making payments to del Valle, who later married another man and moved to Uruguay. She was always respectful of the memory of Gardel, even when interviewed about him in late life for a 1980s television program.

===Death===

Gardel died on 24 June 1935 in a crash between two Ford Trimotor transport aircraft at Olaya Herrera Airfield, Medellín, Colombia. Others who died included the pilot Ernesto Samper, lyricist Alfredo Le Pera, guitarists and , several business associates, and other friends of the group. It is believed that a third guitarist, , died a few days after the crash.

Millions of Gardel&#x27;s fans throughout Latin America went into mourning. Hordes came to pay their respects as his body was taken from Colombia through New York City and Rio de Janeiro. Thousands rendered homage during the two days he lay in state in Montevideo, the city in which his mother lived at the time. Gardel&#x27;s body was laid to rest in La Chacarita Cemetery in Buenos Aires.

==Birthplace controversy==
The place and year of Gardel&#x27;s birth was a controversy that provoked debate; Toulouse, France, in 1890 was the most widely accepted version for many years. The Toulouse birthplace was confirmed in 2012 with the location of his birth certificate. Scholars such as Vanderbilt University history professor Simon Collier, University of Belgrano agriculture history professor Osvaldo Barsky and Uruguayan history professor Jorge Ruffinelli from Stanford University write about how Gardel was born in Toulouse, France, in 1890, and how he laid a false trail about his birthplace beginning in 1920, when he was almost 30.

In October 1920, Gardel first applied for Uruguayan citizenship; in Buenos Aires he went to the Uruguayan consulate to complete paperwork that said he was born in 1887 in Tacuarembó, Uruguay. One month later he was issued a new Argentine identity card that listed him as a Uruguayan national. On 7 March 1923 he applied for citizenship in Argentina. On 1 May 1923 he took the oath of Argentine citizenship. Today, there is no absolute certainty regarding why he took these steps. The most likely reason for this act was to avoid problems with French authorities during an upcoming tour of France. As a French citizen by birth, Gardel had been required to register with the French military during the Great War. It is likely that Gardel never registered; his name is not found on any lists of registrants. Uruguay maintained a neutrality policy during the war, so Gardel probably chose Uruguayan citizenship on that basis.

In 1967, writer Erasmo Silva Cabrera started the modern dispute over Gardel&#x27;s birthplace when he published arguments describing Gardel as having been born in Tacuarembó, Uruguay. Nelson Bayardo wrote a similar book in 1988. In 1990, Eduardo Payssé González published a book containing many biographical details supporting a birthplace of Tacuarembó. The story is that Gardel was born in 1887 the son of influential Uruguayan landowner Carlos Escayola and Escayola&#x27;s sister-in-law, 13-year-old Maria Lelia Oliva. The unwanted boy, named Carlos, was offered to Bertha Gardes who was passing through the area on a cabaret dance tour. Gardes took the boy back to France, where she was from. Later, she and the boy traveled again, this time to Buenos Aires, where they settled. This version of events conflicts with scholarly accounts describing Gardes as an ordinary woman who ironed and pressed clothing in Toulouse in 1890, not a touring dancer.

After Gardel&#x27;s death, his legal representative, Armando Defino, produced a handwritten will which he said was written by Gardel himself, stating he was born in Toulouse, France, to Berthe Gardes (1865–1943), and baptized with the name of Charles Romuald Gardes. This statement agrees with the original birth certificate registered in Toulouse on 11 December 1890.

In his youth in Buenos Aires, Gardel&#x27;s group of close friends called him &quot;El francesito&quot; (Frenchie), acknowledging his French origin. After 1920, Gardel gave contradictory and evasive stories about his birthplace, most likely because of the false papers he had filed. Reporters often wrote that Gardel was Uruguayan, born in Tacuarembó. In the newspaper &quot;El Telégrafo&quot; (Paysandú, Uruguay, 25 October 1933), Gardel was reported as saying, &quot;I&#x27;m Uruguayan, born in Tacuarembó&quot;. In the June 1935 issue of &quot;Caretas&quot; magazine of Antioquia, Colombia, Gardel was reported as saying, &quot;My heart is Argentine, but my soul is Uruguayan, because that is where I was born&quot;. In 1931, Gardel wrote in a witnessed document, &quot;I am French, born in Toulouse, 11 December 1890, son of Berthe Gardes.&quot;

==Compositions==

==Legacy==
Gardel&#x27;s legacy is intimately tied with the tango. For his tango singing, Gardel is still revered from Tokyo to Buenos Aires. A popular saying in Argentina, which serves as a testimony to his long-lived popularity, claims, &quot;Gardel sings better every day.&quot; Another commonly used phrase in Argentina (and some other Latin American countries) which asserts that &quot;Veinte años no es nada&quot; (&quot;Twenty years is nothing&quot;), comes from his song &quot;Volver&quot; (1934). Another common Argentine phrase is &quot;soy/sos Gardel y Le Pera&quot; (&quot;I&#x27;m/You are Gardel and Le Pera&quot;) referring to the greatness of both; used when somebody excels at something. Gardel has been posthumously inducted into the International Latin Music Hall of Fame in 2000 and the Latin Songwriters Hall of Fame in 2014.

In the neighborhood of Abasto, Buenos Aires, the Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 2003, in a house that Gardel bought for his mother in 1927, and where he also lived from 1927 to 1933. Another Carlos Gardel Museum opened in 1999 in Valle Edén, an old farm site south of Tacuarembó, Uruguay.

There is also a small house museum, Casa Gardeliana, in Medellín.

===In literature===
António Lobo Antunes wrote a novel entitled &quot;The Death of Carlos Gardel&quot;, in which one of the characters believes that Gardel did not die in the plane crash in 1935.

Gardel appears as a fictionalized character in the play &quot;El día que me quieras&quot; (1979) by the Venezuelan writer José Ignacio Cabrujas.

===In film===
In the 1939 biopic &quot;The Life of Carlos Gardel&quot;, he is portrayed by Hugo del Carril.

&quot;Doble o Nada&quot; starring Dario Grandinetti and Aitana Sánchez-Gijón was released by Maverick in April 2003. It is a fictional story about a struggling Argentine tango singer who looks and sings like Gardel, and a woman admirer of Gardel, who encounters Franchi.

=== Stamps ===
Over the years, Argentina has issued several postal stamps honoring Gardel. In 1976 and again in 2004, Uruguay produced Gardel stamps, with Uruguay calling him the &quot;immortal Tacuaremboan&quot; in the 2004 version. In 1985, on the 50th anniversary of his death, Colombia produced a Gardel stamp which featured the singer and the airplane model that caused his death. On 16 March 2011, the United States Postal Service issued a set of five &quot;Latin Music Legends&quot; stamps including one picturing Carlos Gardel.

<doc id="252096" wikidata="Q2547820" url="?curid=252096" title="Kinsey Institute">
<text>The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction (often shortened to The Kinsey Institute) is a research institute at Indiana University. Established in Bloomington, Indiana, in 1947 as a nonprofit, the institute merged with Indiana University in 2016, &quot;abolishing the 1947 independent incorporation absolutely and completely.&quot;

The institute&#x27;s mission is &quot;To foster and promote a greater understanding of human sexuality and relationships through research, outreach, education, and historical preservation.&quot; Research, graduate training, information services, and the collection and preservation of library, art, and archival materials are main activities carried out by The Kinsey Institute. The institute and Alfred Kinsey himself have been the subject of much controversy. evolutionary biologist and sex researcher Justin Garcia holds the title of executive director of The Kinsey Institute, previously noted as the institute&#x27;s research director. Garcia is the institute&#x27;s eighth executive director and their youngest in history at 34 years old when appointed as executive director. 
== History ==

=== Formation ===

The origins of the Kinsey Institute lie in the scientific research of Indiana University professor and entomologist turned sexuality researcher, Alfred Kinsey. The 1947 creation of the nonprofit institute, originally named the Institute for Sex Research (ISR), was supported by both Indiana University president Herman B Wells and the Rockefeller Foundation, a major financial backer of Kinsey&#x27;s research. The ISR was established to protect and preserve the confidentiality of Kinsey&#x27;s data and research materials by creating a secure, permanent repository for them.

Alfred Kinsey was director of the institute from 1947 until his death in 1956. Since then, the institute has had six directors: Paul Gebhard PhD (1956–1982), June Reinisch PhD (1982–1993), Stephanie Sanders PhD (interim director, 1993–1995), John Bancroft MD (1994–2004), Julia Heiman PhD (2004–2014), C. Sue Carter PhD (2014–2019), and Justin Garcia PhD (2019–present).

=== Kinsey&#x27;s directorship (1947–1956) ===

Shortly after the ISR&#x27;s establishment, Kinsey&#x27;s interview based research was published in the 1948 bestselling book, &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Male&quot;. Its companion &quot;Sexual Behavior in the Human Female&quot; was published five years later. These books were popularly known as the &quot;Kinsey Reports&quot;. Also, in 1950, research materials being shipped to the ISR were seized by U.S. Customs thereby resulting in the federal court case &quot;U.S. v. 31 Photographs&quot;. This case continued on after Kinsey&#x27;s death, until it was finally settled in the institute&#x27;s favor in 1957. The ruling granted ISR permission to import erotic materials for &quot;research purposes&quot;.

=== Gebhard&#x27;s directorship (1956–1982) ===
Under Paul Gebhard&#x27;s leadership, the interview based research project continued, resulting in the publication of and &quot;Sex Offenders: An Analysis of Types&quot;. Other significant publications included JoAnn Brook&#x27;s&quot; Sexual Nomenclature: A Thesaurus&quot; and Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg&#x27;s &quot;&quot;. Additionally, in response to criticism that Kinsey&#x27;s original data was biased and not well defined, Gebhard and Johnson wrote &quot;The Kinsey Data: Marginal Tabulations of the 1938-1963 Interviews&quot;. To honor its founder, the Institute for Sex Research was renamed The Kinsey Institute for Sex Research in 1981.

=== June Reinisch&#x27;s directorship (1982–1993) ===
When June Machover Reinisch became the new director, the name of the institute changed to The Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, in order to better reflect its expanded mission. During her first years as director, as part of her contract with the university, the institute was completely renovated and expanded adding a new full floor for the library including temperature and humidity controlled stacks, a scholars&#x27; reading room, additional staff offices, and The John Money Visiting Scholars Study, an art gallery and new archives for the art and artifacts collections and additional research offices and laboratory space. Reinisch&#x27;s directorship also saw the creation of a five-volume monographic series, The Kinsey Institute Series, beginning with the publication of &quot;Masculinity/Femininity&quot; resulting from institute-sponsored multidisciplinary seminars. Research focused on at-risk sexual behavior and the effects of prenatal exposure to medications on sexual and psychosexual development. Additionally, in 1990 the establishment of the institute&#x27;s art gallery led to exhibitions featuring its art collection. 
From 1984 to 1993, with direction from Indiana University to play an active role in public education, the institute produced &quot;The Kinsey Report&quot;, an internationally syndicated newspaper column. Although &quot;The Kinsey Report&quot; is no longer a syndicated column, the Kinsey Institute continues to maintain a sex and sexuality FAQ and statistics page on their website. Additionally, a trade book aimed at popular audiences, &quot;The Kinsey Institute New Report on Sex: What you must know to be Sexually Literate&quot;, was released in 1991.

=== Stephanie Sanders&#x27;s interim directorship (1993–1995) ===
Following June Reinisch&#x27;s retirement, Stephanie Sanders held the institute&#x27;s research and curriculum programs together as the Board reorganized its internal structure amid drastic budget cuts from Indiana University.

=== John Bancroft&#x27;s directorship (1995–2004) ===
From 1995 to 2001, The Kinsey Institute operated a clinic for sexual health and menstrual problems under the directorship of John Bancroft. Research focus was placed upon the psychology of sexual behavior, hormonal effects on sex, and sexuality and well-being. Bancroft and Erick Janssen developed the Dual-control model of sexual arousal, a theory of sexual arousal involving inhibitory and excitation processes. In 1999, the website Kinsey Confidential (originally called Kinsey Institute Sexuality Information Service for Students) was started to provide research-based information regarding sexuality to college-aged adults. It includes sex questions and answers provided by sex researcher and columnist Debby Herbenick in both column-format and podcast-format. During the following year, the institute began regularly rotating exhibitions of artwork and archival materials in addition to offering public tours.

=== Julia Heiman&#x27;s directorship (2004–2013) ===
In 2006, the institute began hosting an annual juried art show. In 2007, The Kinsey Institute also hosted the inaugural conference of The University Consortium for Sexuality Research and Training. Also, a question and answer column from the Kinsey Confidential runs in university newspapers including Indiana University&#x27;s &quot;Indiana Daily Student&quot;. Ongoing research themes include such topics as condom usage, sex in long-term relationships, and hormones and reproduction.

=== Sue Carter&#x27;s directorship (2014–2019) ===

Sue Carter, a pioneer in examining mechanisms underlying love, bonding and other emotions, was named director in October 2014. Carter said her directorship will emphasize love, sexuality and well-being. &quot;I want to take Kinsey into directions that are unequivocally important&quot; including sexual trauma, the transgender movement, and medical interventions that can affect a person&#x27;s sexuality and relationships. Reflecting this broadened scope, the institute changed its tagline from &quot;advancing sexual health and knowledge worldwide&quot; to &quot;explore love, sexuality, and well-being&quot; and introduced a new red logo, a circle inscribed with a hexagonal arrangement of circular arcs. The prior logo, a stylised K designed by Enock, Inc., had been phased out around 2010–11. For most of her life, Carter has studied prairie voles. Unlike most other mammals, these voles pair-bond.

=== Justin Garcia&#x27;s directorship (2019–present) ===
On July 1, 2019, evolutionary biologist and sex researcher Justin Garcia became the institute&#x27;s youngest executive director at 34 years old, replacing director Sue Carter.

In 2023, the Indiana House of Representatives passed legislation banning any state funds from going to the Kinsey Institute.

== Library, archive, and art gallery ==

=== Library, archive, and art collection ===
The Kinsey Institute is considered to have one of the largest collections of library, archival, and art materials pertaining to sex, gender, and reproduction. The current collection began as Alfred Kinsey&#x27;s private research collection. To ensure its protection, Kinsey sold it to the institute for one dollar. Over the years, neither state nor grant money have been used to build collections. Instead the institute uses funds obtained from book royalties and fees in addition to donations. A sampling of the broad range of items housed at the institute includes scientific and popular books, pulp magazines, publications from both sexual and anti-sexual organizations, data from Kinsey&#x27;s original interview project, films, photos, erotic objects, and artwork by both professionals and amateurs. Items from all over the world are represented in the collection and some objects even date back to the pre-Columbian era. However, materials do not circulate and must be studied within the reading room which is open to scholars, professionals, university faculty, and students over eighteen who are researching topics pertaining to sexuality, gender, and reproduction. Due to the highly specialized nature of the collection, holdings are described using subject headings created by The Kinsey Institute and organized using a modified version of the Dewey Decimal System.

=== Art gallery ===
The Kinsey Institute&#x27;s art gallery is accessible to the public and hosts a variety of exhibitions each year. Some titles of past exhibitions have included Nature &amp; Nurture: Exploring Human Reproduction from Pregnancy through Early Childhood, Private Eyes: Amateur Art from The Kinsey Institute Collections, Eros in Asia: Erotic Art from Iran to Japan, and Sex and Presidential Politics. Exhibits featuring the institute&#x27;s collection have also traveled around both the state of Indiana and country. Each year since 2006, The Kinsey Institute&#x27;s annual juried art show features art work that explores themes of sexuality, gender, romance, reproduction, gender and sexual politics, the human figure, and the relation between illness and sexuality. Due to the large size of the show, it is hosted at Indiana University&#x27;s SoFa gallery.

<doc id="252098" wikidata="Q284471" url="?curid=252098" title="D20 System">
<text>The d20 System is a role-playing game system published in 2000 by Wizards of the Coast, originally developed for the 3rd edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;. The system is named after the 20-sided dice which are central to the core mechanics of many actions in the game.

Much of the d20 System was released as the System Reference Document (SRD) under the Open Game License (OGL) as Open Game Content (OGC), which allows commercial and non-commercial publishers to release modifications or supplements to the system without paying for the use of the system&#x27;s associated intellectual property, which is owned by Wizards of the Coast.

The original impetus for the open licensing of the d20 System involved the economics of producing role-playing games (RPGs). Game supplements suffered significantly more diminished sales over time than the core books required to play the game. Ryan Dancey, brand manager for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; at the time, directed the effort of licensing the new edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; through the d20 System Trademark, allowing other companies to support the d20 System under a common brand identity. This is distinct from the Open Game License, which simply allows any party to produce works composed of or derivative of designated Open Game Content.

== Mechanics ==

The d20 System is a derivative of the third edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; game system. The three primary designers behind the d20 System were Jonathan Tweet, Monte Cook, and Skip Williams; many others contributed, most notably Richard Baker and Wizards of the Coast then-president Peter Adkison. Many give Tweet the bulk of the credit for the basic resolution mechanic, citing similarities to the system behind his game &quot;Ars Magica&quot;. Tweet, however, stated &quot;The other designers already had a core mechanic similar to the current one when I joined the design team&quot;.

To resolve an action in the d20 System, a player rolls a 20-sided die and adds modifiers based on the natural aptitude of the character (defined by six attributes: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma) and how skilled the character is in various fields (such as in combat), as well as other, situational modifiers. If the result is greater than or equal to a target number (called a Difficulty Class or DC) then the action succeeds. This is called the Core Mechanic. This system is consistently used for all action resolution in the d20 System. In prior games in the &quot;D&amp;D&quot; family, the rules for different actions, such as the first-edition hit tables or the second-edition &quot;Advanced Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; (&quot;AD&amp;D&quot;) &quot;THAC0&quot; and saving throw mechanics, varied considerably in which dice were used and even whether high numbers or low numbers were preferable.

The d20 System is not presented as a universal system in any of its publications or free distributions, unlike game systems like &quot;GURPS&quot;. Rather, the core system has been presented in a variety of formats that have been adapted by various publishers (both Wizards of the Coast and third-party) to specific settings and genres, much like the &quot;Basic Role-Playing&quot; system common to early games by veteran role-playing game publisher Chaosium.

The rules for the d20 System are defined in the System Reference Document or SRD (two separate SRDs were released, one for &quot;D&amp;D&quot; 3rd edition and one for edition 3.5), which may be copied freely or even sold. Designed for fantasy-genre games in (usually) a pseudo-medieval setting, the SRD is drawn from the following &quot;D&amp;D&quot; books: &quot;Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot; v3.5, &quot;Expanded Psionics Handbook&quot;, &quot;Dungeon Master&#x27;s Guide&quot; v3.5, &quot;Monster Manual&quot; v3.5, &quot;Deities and Demigods&quot; v3.0, &quot;Unearthed Arcana&quot;, and &quot;Epic Level Handbook&quot;. Information from these books not in the SRD include detailed descriptions, flavor text, and material Wizards of the Coast considers more specific product identity (such as references to the Greyhawk campaign setting and information on mind flayers).

d20 Modern has its own SRD, called the Modern System Reference Document (MSRD). The MSRD includes material from the &quot;d20 Modern Roleplaying Game&quot;, &quot;Urban Arcana Campaign Setting&quot;, &quot;d20 Menace Manual&quot;, and &quot;d20 Future&quot;. The MSRD can cover a wide variety of genres, but is intended for a modern-day, or in the case of the last of these, a futuristic setting.

==History ==
===Development===
Ryan Dancey believed that the strength of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; came from its gaming community instead of its game system, which supported his belief in an axiom that Skaff Elias promoted known as the &quot;Skaff Effect&quot; which posited that other role-playing game companies increased the success of the market leader, which at that time was Wizards of the Coast. Dancey also theorized that the proliferation of numerous game systems actually made the role-playing game industry weaker, and these beliefs together led Dancey to the idea to allow other publishers to create their own &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; supplements. This led to a pair of licenses that Wizards of the Coast released in 2000, before 3rd edition &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; was released: the Open Gaming License (OGL) made most of the game mechanics of 3rd edition &quot;D&amp;D&quot; permanently open and available for use as what was known as system reference documents, while the d20 Trademark License allowed publishers to use the official &quot;d20&quot; mark of their products to show compatibility with those from Wizards of the Coast. Unlike the OGL, the d20 License was written so that Wizards could cancel it in the future.

===2000–2003: d20 boom===
Initially there was a boom in the RPG industry caused by its use of the d20 license, with numerous companies publishing their own d20 supplements. Some companies used the d20 system to attempt to boost the sales of their proprietary systems, such as Atlas Games and Chaosium, while many other publishers produced d20 content exclusively, including existing companies such as Alderac Entertainment, Fantasy Flight Games, and White Wolf Publishing, as well as new companies like Goodman Games, Green Ronin, Mongoose Publishing, and Troll Lord Games. The success of the d20 license helped create an industry for PDF publishing for role-playing games to fill the demand for d20 products, where electronic delivery presented players with a very quick and inexpensive method to distribute content.

Wizards also began using their d20 system beyond just fantasy games, including their own &quot;Star Wars Roleplaying Game&quot; (2000) and the &quot;d20 Modern Roleplaying Game&quot; (2002). Wizards developed one of the settings from &quot;d20 Modern&quot; into the full &quot;Urban Arcana Campaign Setting&quot; (2003) sourcebook, and further extending the d20 into science-fiction with &quot;d20 Future&quot; (2004) and into historical settings with &quot;d20 Past&quot; (2005), then finished up their &quot;d20&quot; line in 2006 with the classic &quot;Dark•Matter&quot; campaign setting. Third-party publishers used these d20 genre books to base their own campaign settings on, such as White Wolf using the &quot;d20 Modern&quot; rules to publish a licensed version of &quot;Gamma World&quot; (2006) and some supplements.

===2003 onward: 3.5 edition and d20 bust===
In response to the sexually explicit &quot;Book of Erotic Fantasy&quot; (2003) announced by Valar Project for &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, Wizards of the Coast changed the d20 license so that publications were required to meet &quot;community standards of decency&quot;, prompting Valar to simply remove direct references to &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; and publish the book under the OGL. This event, by highlighting that Wizards of the Coast still held wide discretionary power over what counted as legitimate d20 material, made third-party game writers leery of publishing under the d20 license.

Wizards of the Coast released an updated version of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot;, edition 3.5 at Gen Con 36 in August 2003. Third-party publishers were given little warning regarding the update and therefore many companies were stuck with books that were out-of-date before even reaching their audience. Wizards did not make any 3.5 update available for the d20 trademark. Between these two crises, many d20 publishers went out of business or left the field, but most that remained totally abandoned the d20 trademark in favor of publishing under the OGL. Publishers realized that they could publish d20 games successfully without depending upon the core books from Wizards of the Coast, and publishers even started to create OGL-based games that were direct competitors to &quot;D&amp;D&quot;.

== Trademark license ==
Because &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; is the most popular role-playing game in the world, many third-party publishers of the 2000s produced products designed to be compatible with that game and its cousin, d20 Modern. Wizards of the Coast provided a separate license allowing publishers to use some of its trademarked terms and a distinctive logo to help consumers identify these products. This was known as the d20 System Trademark License (d20STL).

The d20STL required publishers to exclude character-creation and advancement rules, apply certain notices, and adhere to an acceptable content policy. D20STL products were also required to clearly state that they require the core books from Wizards of the Coast for use. All d20STL products also had to use the OGL to make use of d20 System open content. However, products that only use the OGL are not bound by these restrictions; thus publishers were able to use the OGL without using the d20STL, and by including their own character-creation and advancement rules allow them to function as complete standalone games.

With the release of the 4th edition of &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons&quot; in 2008, Wizards of the Coast revoked the original d20STL, replacing it with a new license specifically for D&amp;D, known as the Game System License. The terms of this license are similar to the d20STL, but there is no associated OGL or Open Content, and the 4th-edition SRD merely lists the items and terms which may be used in licensed products. This did not affect the legal standing of the OGL, and products based on the SRD may still be released under the OGL alone.

== Controversy ==
When gaming company Valar Project attempted to publish the d20 &quot;Book of Erotic Fantasy&quot; (&quot;BoEF&quot;), which focused on sexual content, Wizards of the Coast altered the d20 System Trademark License in advance of publication of &quot;BoEF&quot; by adding a &quot;quality standards&quot; provision that required publishers to comply with &quot;community standards of decency.&quot; This subsequently prevented the book&#x27;s publication under the d20STL. Wizards of the Coast said this was done to protect its d20 System trademark. The &quot;Book of Erotic Fantasy&quot; was subsequently published without the d20 System trademark under the OGL. Other books subsequently published under similar circumstances include Skirmisher Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Nuisances&quot;, which includes on its cover the disclaimer &quot;Warning: intended for mature readers only.&quot;

The same round of changes to the license also limited the size at which the text &quot;Requires the use of the &quot;Dungeons &amp; Dragons Player&#x27;s Handbook&quot;, Third Edition, published by Wizards of the Coast&quot; (which is required to appear on the front or back cover of most fantasy d20 System products) could be printed, and prohibited making part of it larger than the rest.

<text>Waldshut () is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the south of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighbouring districts are (clockwise from the west) Lörrach, Breisgau-Hochschwarzwald and Schwarzwald-Baar; followed in the south by the Swiss cantons of Schaffhausen, Zürich and Aargau.

==History==
The district dates to the &quot;Oberamt Waldshut&quot;, which was created when the area became part of the state of Baden in the beginning of the 19th century. After some changes it was converted to a district in 1938. In 1973 the districts Säckingen and Hochschwarzwald were dissolved and were partially added to the district Waldshut, which then grew to its current size.

==Geography==
The district covers the southern part of the Black Forest. The river Rhine forms most of the boundary to Switzerland.

==Coat of arms==

The present coat of arms was granted on December 11, 1973, superseding an older one. The bend wavy represents the river Rhine as the main river of the district. The wheel on a blue ground symbolizes the district&#x27;s hydro-electric power industry (there was also a wheel in the old coat of arms). The abbot&#x27;s staff was taken from the arms of the district of Säckingen, to symbolize its monasteries. Green is used to signify the Black Forest.

<doc id="252110" wikidata="Q170177" url="?curid=252110" title="Snowy owl">
<text>The snowy owl (Bubo scandiacus), also known as the polar owl, the white owl and the Arctic owl, is a large, white owl of the true owl family. Snowy owls are native to the Arctic regions of both North America and the Palearctic, breeding mostly on the tundra. It has a number of unique adaptations to its habitat and lifestyle, which are quite distinct from other extant owls. One of the largest species of owl, it is the only owl with mainly white plumage. Males tend to be a purer white overall while females tend to have more extensive flecks of dark brown. Juvenile male snowy owls have dark markings that may appear similar to females until maturity, at which point they typically turn whiter. The composition of brown markings about the wing, although not foolproof, is the most reliable technique to age and sex individual snowy owls. 

Most owls sleep during the day and hunt at night, but the snowy owl is often active during the day, especially in the summertime. The snowy owl is both a specialized and generalist hunter. Its breeding efforts and global population are closely tied to the availability of tundra-dwelling lemmings, but in the non-breeding season, and occasionally during breeding, the snowy owl can adapt to almost any available prey – most often other small mammals and northerly water birds, as well as, opportunistically, carrion. Snowy owls typically nest on a small rise on the ground of the tundra. The snowy owl lays a very large clutch of eggs, often from about 5 to 11, with the laying and hatching of eggs considerably staggered. Despite the short Arctic summer, the development of the young takes a relatively long time and independence is sought in autumn.

The snowy owl is a nomadic bird, rarely breeding at the same locations or with the same mates on an annual basis and often not breeding at all if prey is unavailable. A largely migratory bird, snowy owls can wander almost anywhere close to the Arctic, sometimes unpredictably irrupting to the south in large numbers. Given the difficulty of surveying such an unpredictable bird, there was little in-depth knowledge historically about the snowy owl&#x27;s status. However, recent data suggests the species is declining precipitously. Whereas the global population was once estimated at over 200,000 individuals, recent data suggests that there are probably fewer than 100,000 individuals globally and that the number of successful breeding pairs is 28,000 or even considerably less. While the causes are not well understood, numerous, complex environmental factors often correlated with global warming are probably at the forefront of the fragility of the snowy owl&#x27;s existence.

== Taxonomy ==
The snowy owl was one of the many bird species originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, where it was given the binomial name &quot;Strix scandiaca&quot;. The genus name &quot;Bubo&quot; is Latin for &quot;horned owl&quot; and &quot;scandiacus&quot; is Neo-Latin for &quot;of Scandinavia&quot;. The former generic name &quot;Nyctea&quot; is derived from Greek meaning &quot;night&quot;. Linnaeus originally described the different plumages of this owl as separate species, with the male specimens of snowy owls being considered &quot;Strix scandiaca&quot; and the likely females considered as &quot;Strix nyctea&quot;. Until recently, the snowy owl was regarded as the sole member of a distinct genus, as &quot;Nyctea scandiaca&quot;, but mtDNA cytochrome &quot;b&quot; sequence data shows that it is very closely related to the horned owls in the genus &quot;Bubo&quot; and the species is now thusly often considered inclusive with that genus. However, some authorities debate this classification, still preferring &quot;Nyctea&quot;. Often authorities are motivated to retain the separate genus on the grounds of osteological distinctions.

Genetic testing revealed a reasonably distinct genetic makeup for snowy owls, being about 8% genetically distinct from other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls, perhaps giving credence to those who count the species as separate under &quot;Nyctea&quot;. However, a fairly recent shared origin in evolutionary history has been illustrated through a combination of genetic study and fossil review and there is little, other than osteology of the tarsometatarsus, to outright distinguish the snowy owl from other modern species like the Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;). Genetic testing has indicated that the snowy owl may have diverged from related species at around 4 million years ago. Furthermore, it has determined that the living species genetically most closely related to the snowy owl is the great horned owl (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;). On a broader scale, owls in general have, through genetic materials, been determined to be a highly distinct group, with outwardly similar groups such as Caprimulgiformes revealed to not be at all closely related. Within the owl order, typical owls are highly divergent from barn-owls. Furthermore, the &quot;Bubo&quot; genus likely clustered at some point during the evolutionary process with other largish owls, such as &quot;Strix&quot;, &quot;Pulsatrix&quot; and &quot;Ciccaba&quot;, based on broad similarities in their voice, reproductive behaviors (i.e. hooting postures) and a similar number and structure of chromosomes and autosomes. A number, but not all, of extant typical owls seem to have evolved from an ancient shared common ancestor with the &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. In addition to the question of relationship of the traditional &quot;Bubo&quot; owls to the snowy owls, ongoing ambiguity of the relationship of other similarly large-sized owls has been persistent. These have sometimes either been included in the genus or within separate genera, i.e. the &quot;Ketupu&quot; or fish owls and the &quot;Scotopelia&quot; or fishing owls. Despite the adaptive distinctions, the grouping of these large owls (i.e. &quot;Bubo&quot;, snowy, fish and perhaps fishing owls) appears to be borne out via research of karyotypes.

The fossil history of snowy owls is fairly well documented despite some early confusion on how to distinguish the skeletal structure of the snowy owls from eagle-owls. It was determined that the snowy owl once was distributed much more widely and far farther to the south during the Quaternary glaciation when much of the Northern Hemisphere was in the midst of an ice age. Fossil records shows that snowy owls once could be found in Austria, Azerbaijan, Czechoslovakia, England, France, Germany, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Sardinia and Spain as well as in the Americas in Cape Prince of Wales, Little Kiska Island, St. Lawrence Island, and in Illinois. In the Late Pleistocene the range expanded southward even more so to Bulgaria (80,000–16,000 years, Kozarnika Cave, W Bulgaria). and much of the Italian Peninsula. Pleistocene era fossils from France, i.e. &quot;B. s. gallica&quot;, showed that the snowy owls of the time were somewhat bulkier (though still notably smaller than contemporary eagle-owls of the times, which were larger than the eagle-owls of today) and osteologically more sexually dimorphic in size than the modern form (9.9% dimorphism in favor of females in the fossils against 4.8% in the same features today). There are no subspecific or other geographical variations reported in the modern snowy owls, with individuals of vastly different origins breeding together readily due to their nomadic habits. Despite apparent variations in body size, environmental conditions are the likely variant rather than genetics. No evidence could be found of phylogeographic variation in snowy owls upon testing. Furthermore, the snowy owl appears to have a similar level of genetic diversity as other European owls.

===Hybrids===
Snowy owls are not known to interbreed with other owl species in the wild, and accordingly, no hybrids of snowy owls and other owl species have yet been sighted in the wild. However, a hobby falconer in Kollnburg, Germany, bred hybrids from a male snowy owl and a female Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Bubo bubo&quot;) in 2013. The two resulting male hybrid owls possessed the prominent ear-tufts (generally absent in snowy owls), general size, orange eyes, and the same pattern of black markings on their plumage from their Eurasian eagle-owl mother, while retaining the generally black-and-white plumage colours from their snowy owl father. The hybrids were dubbed &quot;Schnuhus&quot; from the German words for snowy owl and Eurasian eagle-owl (&quot;Schnee-Eule&quot; and &quot;Uhu&quot;, respectively). As of 2014, the hybrids had grown to maturity and were healthy.

== Description ==

The snowy owl is mostly white. They are purer white than predatory mammals like polar bears (&quot;Ursus maritimus&quot;) and Arctic fox (&quot;Vulpes lagopus&quot;). Often when seen in the field, these owls can resemble a pale rock or a lump of snow on the ground. It usually appears to lack ear tufts but very short (and probably vestigial) tufts can be erected in some situations, perhaps most frequently by the female when she is sitting on the nest. The ear tufts measure about and consist of about 10 small feathers. The snowy owl has bright yellow eyes. The head is relatively small and, even for the relatively simply adapted hearing mechanism of a &quot;Bubo&quot; owl, the facial disc is shallow and the ear is uncomplicated. 1 male had ear slits of merely on left and on the right. Females are almost invariably more duskily patterned than like-age males. In mature males, the upper parts are plain white with usually a few dark spots on the miniature ear-tufts, about the head and the tips of some primaries and secondaries whilst the underside is often pure white. Despite their reputation for being purely white, only 3 out of 129 Russian museum specimens of adult males showed an almost complete absence of darker spots. The adult female is usually considerably more spotted and often slightly barred with dark brown on the crown and the underparts. Her flight and tail feathers are faintly barred brown while the underparts are white in base color with brown spotting and barring on the flanks and upper breast. In confusingly plumaged snowy owls, the sex can be determined by the shape of wing markings, which manifest as bars more so in females and spots in males. However, the very darkest males and the lightest females are nearly indistinguishable by plumage. On rare occasions, a female can appear almost pure white, as has been recorded in both the field and in captivity. There is some evidence that some of the species grow paler with age after maturity. One study&#x27;s conclusions were that males were usually but not always lighter and that correctly aging is extremely difficult, sometimes individuals either get lighter, darker or do not change their appearance with age. On the other hand, with close study, it is possible to visually identify even individual snowy owls using the pattern of markings on the wing, which can be somewhat unique in each individual. After a fresh moult, some adult females that previously appeared relatively pale newly evidenced dark, heavy markings. On the contrary, some banded individuals over at least four years were observed to have been almost entirely unchanged in the extent of their markings. In another very pale owl, the barn owl (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;), the sexual dimorphism of spotting appears to be driven by genetics while, in snowy owls, environment may be the dictating factor instead. 

The chicks are initially grayish white but quickly transition to dark gray-brown in the mesoptile plumage. This type of plumage camouflages effectively against the variously colored lichens that dot the tundra ground. This is gradually replaced by plumage showing dark barring on white. At the point of fledging, the plumage often becomes irregularly mottled or blotched with dark and is mostly solidly dark gray-brown above with white eyebrows and other areas of the face white. Recently fledged young can already be sexed to a semi-reliable degree by the dark marking patterns about their wings. The juvenile plumage resembles that of adult females but averages slightly darker on average. By their second moult fewer or more broken bars are usually evidenced on the wing. The extent of white and composition of wing patterns become more dimorphic by sex with each juvenile moult, culminating in the 4th or 5th pre-basic moult, wherein the owls are hard to distinguish from mature adults. Moults usually occur from July and September, non-breeding birds moulting later and more extensively, and are never extensive enough to render the owls flightless. Evidence indicates that snowy owls may attain adult plumage at 3 to 4 years of age, but fragmentary information suggests that some males are not fully mature and/or as fully white in plumage that they can attain until the 9th or 10th year. Generally speaking, moults of snowy owls occur more quickly than do those of Eurasian eagle-owls.

The toes of the snowy owl are extremely thickly feathered white, while the claws are black. The toe feathers are the longest known of any owl, averaging at , against the great horned owl which has the 2nd longest toe feathers at a mean of Occasionally, snowy owls may show a faint blackish edge to the eyes and have a dark gray cere, though this is often not visible from the feather coverage, and a black bill. Unlike many other whitish birds, the snowy owl does not possess black wingtips, which is theorized to minimize wear-and-tear on the wing feathers in the other whitish bird types. The conspicuously notched primaries of the snowy owl appear to give an advantage over similar owls in long-distance flight and more extensive flapping flight. The snowy owl does have some of the noise-canceling serrations and comb-like wing feathers that render the flight of most owls functionally silent, but they have fewer than most related &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. Therefore, in combination with its less soft feathers, the flight of a snowy owl can be somewhat audible at close range. The flight of snowy owls tends to be steady and direct and is reminiscent to some of the flight of a large, slow-flying falcon. Though capable of occasional gliding flight, there is no evidence that snowy owls will soar. It is said that the species seldom exceeds a flying height of around even during passage. While the feet are sometimes described as &quot;enormous&quot;, the tarsus is in osteological terms relatively short at 68% the length of those of a Eurasian eagle-owl but the claws are nearly as large, at 89% of the size of those of the eagle-owl. Despite its relatively short length, the tarsus is of similar circumference as in other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. Also compared to an eagle-owl, the snowy owl has a relatively short decurved rostrum, a proportionately greater length to the interorbital roof and a much longer sclerotic ring surrounding the eyes while the anterior opening are the greatest known in any owl. Owls have extremely large eyes which are nearly the same size in large species such as the snowy owl as those of humans. The snowy owl&#x27;s eye, at about in diameter, is slightly smaller than those of great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls but is slightly larger than those of some other large owls. Snowy owls must be able to see from great distances and in highly variable conditions but probably possess less acute night vision than many other owls. Based on the study of dioptres in different owl species, the snowy owl was determined to have eyesight better suited to long-range perception than to close discrimination, while some related species such as great horned owls could probably more successful perceive closer objects. Despite their visual limits, snowy owls may have up to 1.5 times more visual acuity than humans. Like other owls, snowy owls can probably perceive all colors but cannot perceive ultraviolet visual pigments. Owls have the largest brains of any bird (increasing in sync with the size of the owl species), with the size of the brain and eye related less to intelligence than perhaps to increased nocturnality and predatory behavior.

===Size===

The snowy owl is a very large owl. They are the largest avian predator of the High Arctic and one of the largest owls in the world. Snowy owls are about the sixth or seventh heaviest living owl on average, around the fifth longest and perhaps the third longest winged. This species is the heaviest and longest winged owl (as well as the second longest) in North America, the second heaviest and longest winged owl in Europe (and third longest) but is outsized in bulk by about 3 to 4 other species in Asia. Despite being sometimes described as of similar size, the snowy owl is somewhat larger in all aspects of average size than the great horned owl while the similarly specialized taiga-dwelling great grey owl (&quot;Strix nebulosa&quot;), is longer in total length and of similar dimensions in standard measurements, but is shorter winged and much less heavy than the snowy owl. In Eurasia, the Eurasian eagle-owl is larger in all standards of measurements than the snowy owl not to mention two additional species each from Africa and Asia that are slightly to considerably heavier on average than the snowy owl. Like most birds of prey, the snowy owl shows reverse sexual dimorphism relative to most non-raptorial birds in that females are larger than males. Sexual dimorphism that favors the female may have some correlation with being able to more effectively withstand food shortages such as during brooding as well as the rigors associated with incubating and brooding. Females are sometimes described as “giant” whereas males appear relatively “neat and compact”. However, the sexual dimorphism is relatively less pronounced compared to some other &quot;Bubo&quot; species.

Male snowy owls have been known to measure from in total length, with an average from four large samples of and a maximum length, perhaps in need of verification, of reportedly . In wingspan, males may range from , with a mean of . In females, total length has been known to range from , with a mean of and an unverified maximum length of perhaps (if so they would have the second longest maximum length of any living owl, after only the great grey owl). Female wingspans have reportedly measured from , with a mean of . Despite one study claiming that snowy owl had the highest wing loading (i.e. grams per square cm of wing area) of any of 15 well-known owl species, more extensive sampling demonstratively illustrated that the wing loading of snowy owls is notably lower than Eurasian eagle- and great horned owls. The conspicuously long-winged profile of a flying snowy owl compared to these related species may cause some to compare their flight profile to a bulkier version of an enormous &quot;Buteo&quot; or a large falcon. Body mass in males can average from , with a median of and a full weight range of from six sources. Body mass in females can average from , with a median of and a full weight range of . Larger than the aforementioned body mass studies, a massive pooled dataset at six wintering sites in North America showed that 995 males averaged at while 1,189 females were found to average . Reported weights of down to for males and of for females are probably in reference to owls in a state of starvation. Such emaciated individuals are known to highly impaired and starvation deaths are probably not infrequent in winters with poor food accesses. 

Standard measurements have been even more widely reported than length and wingspan. The wing chord of males can vary from , averaging from with a median of . The wing chord of females can vary from , averaging from with a median of . The tail length of males can vary on average from , with a full range of and a median of . The tail length of females can average from , with a full range of and a median of . Data indicates that slightly longer wing chord and tail lengths were reported on average in Russian data than in American research, however the weights were not significantly different in the two regions. Less widely taken measurements include the culmen, which can measure from with a median average of in males and in females, and the total bill length which is from , with an average in both sexes of . Tarsal length in males averages about , with a range of , and averages about , with a range of , in females.

===Identification===

The snowy owl is certainly one of the most unmistakable owls (or perhaps even animals) in the world. No other species attains the signature white stippled sparsely with black-brown color of these birds, a coloring which renders their bright yellow eyes all the more detectable, nor possesses their obvious extremely long feathering. The only other owl to breed in the High Arctic is the short-eared owl (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;). Both species inhabit open country, overlap in range and are often seen by day, but the short-eared is much smaller and more tan or straw-colored in coloration, with streaked brown on chest. Even the palest short-eared owls conspicuously differ and are darker than the snowy owl; additionally the short-eared most often hunts in extended flights. More similar owls such as the Eurasian eagle-owl and the great horned owl attain a fairly pale, sometimes white-washed look in their northernmost races. These species do not normally breed nearly as far north as snowy owls but overlaps certainly do occur with snowy owls when the latter owl sometimes comes south in winter. However, even the most pale great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls are still considerably more heavily marked with darker base colors than snowy owls (the whitest eagle-owls are paler than the whitest great horned owls), possess much larger and more conspicuous ear tufts and lack the bicolored appearance of the darkest snowy owls. While the great horned owl has yellow eyes like the snowy owl, the Eurasian eagle-owl tends to have bright orange eyes. The open terrain habitats normally used by wintering snowy owls are also distinct from the typical edge and rocky habitats usually favored by the great horned and Eurasian eagle-owls, respectively.

===Vocalizations===
The snowy owl differ in their calls from other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls, with a much more barking quality to their version of a hooting song. Perhaps as many as 15 different calls by mature snowy owls have been documented. The main vocalization is a monotonous sequence that normally contains 2–6 (but occasionally more), rough notes similar to the rhythm of a barking dog: &quot;krooh krooh krooh krooh&quot;... The call may end with an emphatic &quot;aaoow&quot;, which is somewhat reminiscent of the deep alarm call of a great black-backed gull (&quot;Larus marinus&quot;). They will call mainly from a perch but also sometimes do so in flight. The &quot;krooh&quot; call of the male snowy owl may perform multiple functions such as competitive exclusion of other males and advertising to females. The calls of this species may carry exceptionally far in the thin air of Arctic, certainly over more than , and maybe even to as much away. The female has a similar call to male but can be higher-pitched and/or more guttural as well as single notes which are often disyllabic, &quot;khuso&quot;. Female snowy owls have also been known to utter chirps and high screaming notes, similar to those of the nestlings. Both sexes may at times give a series of clucking, squeals, grunts, hisses and cackles, perhaps such as in circumstances when they are excited. The alarm call is a loud, grating, hoarse &quot;keeea&quot;. Another raspier bark is recorded, sometimes called a &quot;watchman&#x27;s rattle&quot; call, and may be transcribed as &quot;rick, rick, rick&quot;, &quot;ha, how, quack, quock&quot; or &quot;kre, kre, kre, kre, kre&quot;. A female attacking to protect her nest was recorded to let out a crowed &quot;ca-ca-oh&quot; call, whilst other owls attacking to protect the nest did a loud version of the typical call while circling before dropping down. They may also clap their beak in response to threats or annoyances. While called clapping, it is believed this sound may actually be a clicking of the tongue, not the beak. Though largely only vocal in the breeding season, leading to some erroneous older accounts describing the snowy owl as completely silent, some vocalizations have been recorded in winter in the northern United States. Initially, the young of the snowy owl have a high pitched and soft begging call which develops into a strong, wheezy scream at around 2 weeks. At the point when the young owls leave the nest around 3 weeks, the shrill squeals they emit may allow the mothers to locate them.

== Distribution and habitat==
===Breeding range===
The snowy owl is typically found in the northern circumpolar region, where it makes its summer home north of latitude 60° north though sometimes down to 55 degrees north. However, it is a particularly nomadic bird, and because population fluctuations in its prey species can force it to relocate, it has been known to breed at more southerly latitudes. Although the total breeding range includes a little over , only about have a high probability of breeding, i.e. breeding at no more than 3–9-year intervals. Snowy owls nest in the Arctic tundra of the northernmost stretches of Alaska, Northern Canada, and the Euro-Siberian region.

Between 1967 and 1975, snowy owls bred on the remote island of Fetlar in the Shetland Isles north of mainland Scotland, discovered by the Shetland RSPB warden, Bobby Tulloch. Females summered as recently as 1993, but their status in the British Isles is now that of a rare winter visitor to Shetland, the Outer Hebrides and the Cairngorms. Vagrant snowy owls have occasionally been found as far south as Lincolnshire. Older records show that the snowy owls may have once semi-regularly bred elsewhere in Shetland. They range in northern Greenland (mostly Peary Land) and, rarely in &quot;isolated parts of the highlands&quot;, Iceland. Thence, they are found breeding at times across northern Eurasia such as in Spitsbergen and western and northern Scandinavia. In Norway, they normally breed in Finnmark and seldom down as far south as Hardangervidda and in Sweden perhaps down to the Scandinavian Mountains while breeding is very inconsistent in Finland.

They also range in much of northern Russia, including northern Siberia, Anadyr, Koryakland, Taymyr Peninsula, Yugorsky Peninsula, Sakha (especially the Chukochya River) and Sakhalin. Breeding has also been reported sporadically to the south in the Komi Republic and even the Kama River in southern Perm Krai. Although considered part of their regular range, the last breeding by snowy owls in the Kola Peninsula was in the early 1980s; similarly, breeding maps show the species in Arkhangelsk Oblast and the Pay-Khoy Ridge but no breeding records are known in at least 30 years in either. They range throughout most of the Arctic isles of Russia such as Novaya Zemlya, Severnaya Zemlya, New Siberian Islands, Wrangel Island, Commander and Hall Islands.

In North America, the breeding range has been known in modern times to include the Aleutians (i.e. Buldir and Attu) and much of northern Alaska, most frequently from the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to Utqiaġvik, and more sporadically down along the coastal-western parts such as through Nome, Hooper Bay, the Yukon Delta National Wildlife Refuge, and rarely even south to the Shumagin Islands. The snowy owl may breed extensively in northern Canada, largely making its home in the Arctic Archipelago. Their Canadian breeding range can include broadly Ellesmere Island up to Cape Sheridan, north coastal Labrador, the northern Hudson Bay, perhaps all of Nunavut (especially the Kivalliq Region), northeastern Manitoba, most of northern mainland and insular Northwest Territories (including the delta of the Mackenzie River) and northern Yukon Territory (where breeding is mostly confined to Herschel Island). Since breeding and distribution is very small, local and inconsistent in northern Europe, northern Canada and northern Alaska represent the core part of the breeding range for snowy owls along with several parts of northern and northeastern/coastal Russia.

===Regular wintering range===

During the winter months, many snowy owls leave the dark Arctic to migrate to regions further south. Southern limits of the regular winter range are difficult to delineate given the inconsistency of appearances south of the Arctic. Furthermore, not infrequently, many snowy owls will overwinter somewhere in the Arctic through the winter, though seldom appear to do so in the same sites where they have bred. Due in no small part to the difficulty and hazardousness of observation for biologists during these harsh times, there is very limited data on overwintering snowy owls in the tundra, including how many occur, where they winter and what their ecology is at this season. The regular wintering range has at times been thought to include Iceland, Ireland and Scotland and across northern Eurasia such as southern Scandinavia, the Baltics, central Russia, southwestern Siberia, Sakhalin southern Kamchatka and, rarely, north China and sometimes the Altai Republic. In North America, they occasionally regularly winter in the Aleutian island chain and do so broadly and with a fair amount of consistency in much of southern Canada, from British Columbia to Labrador. Recent research has indicated that snowy owls regularly winter in several of the northern seas during wintertime, following the leads of sea ice as perching sites and presumably hunting mostly seabirds in polynyas. In February 1886, a snowy owl landed on the rigging of the Nova Scotia steamship &quot;Ulunda&quot; on the edge of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland, over from the nearest land. It was captured and later preserved at the Nova Scotia Museum. Surprisingly, some studies have determined that after a high lemming year in North America, a higher percentage of snowy owls were using marine environments rather than inland ones.

===Irruptive range===
Large winter irruptions at temperate latitudes are thought to be due to good breeding conditions resulting in more juvenile migrants. These result in irruptions occurring further south than the typical snowy owl range in some years. They have been reported, as well as in all northerly states in the contiguous states, as far south as Georgia, Kentucky, South Carolina, nearly all the Gulf Coast of the United States, Colorado, Nevada, Texas, Utah, California and even Hawaii. In January 2009, a snowy owl appeared in Spring Hill, Tennessee, the first reported sighting in the state since 1987. Also notable is the mass southern migration in the winter of 2011/2012, when thousands of snowy owls were spotted in various locations across the United States. This was then followed by an even larger mass southern migration in 2013/2014 with the first snowy owls seen in Florida for decades. The nature of irruptions is less well-documented in Eurasia, in part due to the paucity of this owl in the European side, but accidental occurrence, presumably during irruptions, has been described in the Mediterranean area, France, Crimea, the Caspian part of Iran, Kazakhstan, northern Pakistan, northwestern India, Korea and Japan. Stragglers may too turn up as far south as the Azores and Bermuda.

===Habitat===

Snowy owls are one of the best known inhabitants of the open Arctic tundra. Frequently, the earth in snowy owl breeding grounds is covered with mosses, lichens and some rocks. Often the species preferentially occurs in areas with some rising elevation such as hummocks, knolls, ridges, bluffs and rocky outcrops. Some of these rises in the tundra are created by glacial deposits. The ground is usually rather dry in tundra but in some areas of the southern tundra can also be quite marshy. Not infrequently, they will also use areas of varied coastal habitat, often tidal flats, as a breeding site. Breeding sites are usually at low elevations, usually less than above sea level, but when breeding to the south in inland mountains, such as in Norway, they may nest at as high as . Outside the breeding season, snowy owls may occupy nearly any open landscape. Typically wintering sites are rather windswept with meager cover. These open areas can include coastal dunes, other coastal spots, lakeshores, islands, moorlands, steppes, meadows, prairies, other extensive grasslands and rather shrubby areas of the Subarctic. These may be favored due to their vague similarity to the flat openness of the tundra. Manmade open sites are now perhaps even more used than natural ones, often agricultural fields and rangeland, as well as large areas of cleared forests. During irruption years when they are found in the northeastern United States, juveniles frequent developed areas including urban areas and golf courses, as well as the expected grasslands and agricultural areas that older birds primarily use. On the plains of Alberta, observed snowy owls spent 30% of their time in stubble-fields, 30% in summer fallow, 14% in hayfield and the remainder of the time in pasture, natural grasslands and sloughs. The agricultural areas, large untouched by the farmers in winter, may have had more concentrated prey than the others in Alberta. Perhaps the most consistently attractive habitat in North America to wintering snowy owls in modern times may be airports, which not only tend to have the flat, grassy characteristics of their preferred habitats but also by winter host a particular diversity of prey, both pests which rely on humans as well as wildlife attracted to the extensively grassy and marshy strips that dot the large airport vicinities. For example, Logan International Airport in Massachusetts has relatively one of the most reliable annual populations known in the United States in winter. All ages spend a fair amount of their time over water in the Bering Sea, the Atlantic Ocean and even the Great Lakes, mostly on ice floes. These marine and ocean-like freshwater areas were observed to account for 22–31% of habitat used in 34 radio-tagged American snowy owls over two irruptive years, with the tagged owls occurring a mean of from the nearest land (while 35–58% used the expected preferred habitats of grassland, pasture and other agricultural land).

==Behavior==

Snowy owls may be active to some extent at both day, from dawn to dusk, and night. Snowy owls have been seen to be active even during the very brief winter daytime in the northern winter. During the Arctic summer, snowy owls may tend to peak in activity during the twilight that is the darkest time available given the lack of full nightfall. Reportedly, the peak time of activity during summer is between 9:00 pm and 3:00 am in Norway. The peak time of activity for those owls that once nested on Fetlar was reported between 10:00 and 11:00 pm. According to one authority, the least active times are at noon and midnight. As days become longer near autumn in Utqiaġvik, the snowy owls in the tundra become more active around nightfall and can often be seen resting during the day, especially if it is raining. During winter in Alberta, snowy owls were tracked in the daytime, despite being also active at night (as they were deemed too difficult to track). In the study, they were most active during 8:00–10:00 am and 4:00–6:00 pm and often rested mostly from 10:00 am to 4:00 pm. The owls were perched for 98% of observed daylight and seemed to time their activity to peak times for rodents. The variation of activity is probably in correspondence with their primary prey, the lemmings, and like them, the snowy owl may be considered cathemeral. This species can withstand extremely cold temperatures, having been recorded in temperatures as low as minus 62.5 degrees Celsius with no obvious discomfort and also withstood a 5-hour exposure to minus 93 degrees Celsius but may have struggled with oxygen consumption by the end of this period. The snowy owl has perhaps the second lowest thermal conduction to the plumage on average of any bird after only the Adelie penguin (&quot;Pygoscelis adeliae&quot;) and rivals the best insulated mammals, such as Dall sheep (&quot;Ovis dalli&quot;) and Arctic fox, as the best insulated polar creature. Presumably as many as 7 rodents would need to be eaten daily to survive an extremely cold winter&#x27;s day. Adults and young both have been seen to shelter behind rocks to shield themselves from particularly harsh winds or storms. Snowy owls often spending a majority of time on the ground, perched mostly on a slight rise of elevation. It has been interpreted from the morphology of their skeletal structure (i.e. their short, broad legs) that snowy owls are not well-suited to perching extensively in trees or rocks and prefer a flat surface to sit upon. However, they may perch more so in winter though do so only mainly when hunting, at times on hummocks, fenceposts, telegraph poles by roads, radio and transmission towers, haystacks, chimneys and the roofs of houses and large buildings. Rocks may be used as perches at times in all seasons. Though often relatively sluggish owls, like most related species, they are capable of sudden dashing movements in various contexts. Snowy owls can walk and run quite quickly, using outstretched wings for balance if necessary. This owl flies with fairly rowing wingbeats, occasionally interrupted by gliding on stretched wings. The flight is fairly buoyant for a &quot;Bubo&quot; owl. When displaying, the male may engage in an undulating flight with interspersed wingbeats and gliding in a slight dihedral, finally dropping rather vertically to the ground. They are capable for swimming but do not usually do so. Some seen to be swimming were previously injured but young have been seen to swim into water to escape predators if they cannot fly yet. They will also drink when unfrozen water is available. Snowy owl mothers have been observed to preen their young in the wild, while pairs in captivity have been observed to allopreen. In the period leading up to breeding, snowy owls switched regularly between searching (for nesting grounds) and loafing, often searching less when snow cover was less extensive. 

Snowy owls will fight with conspecifics in all seasons occasionally but this is relatively infrequent during breeding and rarer still during winter. Dogfights and talon interlocking may ensue if the fight between two snowy owls continues to escalate. A study determined that snowy owls are able to orient the whitest parts of their plumage towards the sun, spending about 44% of time oriented as such during sunny days and much less on cloudy days. Some authors interpret this as a presumed signal to conspecifics, but thermoregulation could also be a factor. It is known that during winter in Alberta that female snowy owls are territorial towards one another and may not leave an area for up to 80 days but males are nomadic, usually only staying 1–2 days in an area (seldom to 3–17 days). The females spent on average seven times as long in a given area than did males. During threat displays, individuals will lower the front of the body, stretch the head low and forward, with partially extended wings and feathers on the head and raise their back. If continuously threatened or cornered, the posture in the threat display may become still more contoured and, if pressed, the owl will like back and attempt to slash with its large talons. The threat displays of males are generally more emphatic than those of females. Although snowy owls have been considered as semi-colonial, they do not appear to fit this mold well. Nesting sites can be loosely clustered but this is a coincidental response to concentrated prey and each pair tends to be somewhat intolerant of each other. During winter, snowy owls are usually solitary but some aggregations have been recorded, especially nearer the Arctic when more narrow food selection can lead to up to 20–30 owls gathering in an area of about . Congregations were also recorded in the winter in Montana, where 31–35 owls wintered in a area, owls mostly grouped in loose aggregations of 5–10 owls each or occasionally side-by-side or about apart. In extreme cases in Utqiaġvik, the owls may have exceptionally close active nests that may be down to only apart. Juvenile males appear to be especially prone to loose associations with one another, appearing to be non-territorial and able to hunt freely in front of one another. In a area in and around Utqiaġvik, productive years may have about 54 nests while none may be found in poor years. Utqiaġvik may have about 5 owls in early summer every , have a nest spacing of and the owls territory size is about . In Churchill, Manitoba, nest spacing averaged about . In Southampton Island in a year when the owls nested there, nest spacing averaged , with the closest two apart and density per nest was . In Nunavut, densities could go from 1 owl per in a productive year to 1 owl per in a poor year and from 36 nests in a area to none at all. Owl density on Wrangel Island in Russia was observed be a single bird each . The first known study of winter territories took place in Horicon Marsh where owls ranged from each. In Calgary, Alberta, mean territory size of juvenile females in winter was and adult females was . Wintering owls in central Saskatchewan were radio-monitored, determining that 11 males had an average range of , while that of 12 females was with the combined average being .
===Migration===
It is fair to say that the snowy owl is a partial, if fairly irregular, migrant, having a very broad but patchy wintering range. 1st year birds tend to disperse farther south in winter than older owls with males wintering usually somewhat more to the south than females of equivalent ages, adult females often wintering the farthest north. The snowy owl likely covers more ground than almost any other owl in movements but many complex individual variations are known in movements, and they often do not take the traditional north–south direction that might be assumed. Migratory movements appear to be somewhat more common in America than in Asia. A study of wintering owls in the Kola Peninsula determined that the mean date of arrival of owls was 10 November with a departure date of 13 April, covering an average of during the course of the wintering period and clustering where prey was more concentrated. Some variety of movements recorded each autumn and snowy owls winter annually in plains of Siberia and Mongolia and prairies and marshlands of Canada. The Great Plains area of southern Canada host wintering snowy owls about 2 to 10 times more frequently than other areas of the continent. Some weak correlation has made with individuals having some level of fealty to certain wintering sites. Wintering snowy owls, a total of 419, recorded in Duluth, Minnesota from 1974 to 2012 would occur in larger numbers in years where rats were more plentiful. The amount of individual returns among 43 Duluth-wintering owls was fairly low in subsequent winters (8 for 1 year, a small handful in the next few years, and 9 in non-consecutive years). Sometimes surveys appeared to reveal hundreds of wintering snowy owls on coastal sea ice during an irruptive year. Three siblings that hatched in same nest in Cambridge Bay were recovered in drastically different spots at least a year later: one in eastern Ontario, one in Hudson Bay and one in Sakhalin Island. A nestling banded in Hordaland was recovered to the northeast in Finnmark. In the Logan Airport, 17 of 452 owls were recorded to return, eleven the following year, three 2 years later, and then singles variously 6, 10 and 16 years later. A banded female from Utqiaġvik was recorded to migrate over along seacoast down to Russia, returning over and covering at least in total. Another banded young female from Utqiaġvik went to the same Russian areas, returned to Utqiaġvik and then onto Victoria Island, but did appear to breed, while another also covered a similar route but ended up nesting on Banks Island. Another female migrated to the Canada–United States border, then moved back to the Gulf of Alaska, then to winter in the same border areas and then finally to both Banks and Victoria Island. Snowy owls from the Canadian Arctic were monitored to have covered an average of in one autumn then covered an average of a year later. In late winter, owls from the same area were found to have covered a mean of of ground in the tundra and spent a mean of 108 days, apparently searching for a suitable nesting situation the entire time.

In no fewer than 24 winters between 1882 and 1988, large numbers have occurred in Canada and the United States. These were irruption years. Record breeding irruptive years were recorded in the winters of 2011–2012 and 2014–2015. In the 1940s, it was calculated that the mean gape in time between large irruptions was 3.9 years. Southbound movements as such are much more conspicuous after peak vole years, once thought to be separated by periods of around 3–7 years. However, more extensive research has weakened the argument that irruptions are entirely food-based and the data indicates that irruptive movements are far from predictable. This is because a statewide survey in Alaska found no statewide synchrony in lemming numbers. Therefore, rather than decline of lemmings, it is the successful productivity of several pairs that plays the role, resulting in a large number of young owls that then irrupt. However, the snowy owls cannot breed in high numbers unless lemmings are widely available on the tundra. This connection of irruptions to high years of productivity was confirmed in a study by Robillard et al. (2016). About 90% of the snowy owls seen in irruptive years from 1991 to 2016 that were ageable were identified as juveniles.

==Diet and hunting==
===Hunting techniques===

Snowy owls may hunt at nearly any time of the day or night, but may not attempt to do so during particularly severe weather. During the summer solstice, the owls appear to hunt during &quot;theoretical nightfall&quot;. Night-vision devices have allowed biologists to observe that snowy owls hunt quite often during the extended nighttime during the northern winter. Prey are both taken and eaten on the ground. Like other carnivorous birds, Snowy owls often swallow their small prey whole. Strong stomach juices digest the flesh, while the indigestible bones, teeth, fur, and feathers are compacted into oval pellets that the bird regurgitates 18 to 24 hours after feeding. Regurgitation often takes place at regular perches, where dozens of pellets may be found. Biologists frequently examine these pellets to determine the quantity and types of prey the birds have eaten. When large prey are eaten in small pieces, pellets will not be produced. Larger prey is often torn apart, sometimes including removal of the head, with the large muscles, such as the humerus or breast, typically eaten first. The scattering of remains that results from the increment feeding on larger prey is thought to result in under-identification of them compared to smaller prey items. The aptitude for hunting by day, hunting from the ground and hunting in almost always completely open and treeless areas are the primary ways in which the snowy owl differs in hunting from other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls. Otherwise, the hunting habits are similar. It is thought, due to their less refined hearing compared to other owls, prey is usually perceived via vision and movement. Experiments indicate that snowy owls can detect prey from as far as away. Snowy owls generally use a rise or, occasionally, a perch while hunting. 88% of observed 34 hunts in Utqiaġvik were undertaken from an elevated watch-site (56% mounds or rises, 37% telephone poles). Their hunting style may recall that of buzzards, with the hunting owl sitting rather low and perching immobile for a long spell. Although their usual flight is a slow, deliberate downbeat on the broad, fingered wings, when prey is detected from their perch, flight may be undertaken with a sudden, surprisingly quick accelerated style with interspersed wing beats. In Utqiaġvik, snowy owls may most frequently engage in a brief pursuit hunting style. In high winds capable of keeping their bulk aloft, snowy owls may too engage in a brief hovering flight before dropping onto prey. When hunting fish, apparently, some snowy owls will hover in a style reminiscent of the osprey (&quot;Pandion haliaetus&quot;), although in at least one other case a snowy owl was observed to capture fish by lying on its belly upon a rock by a fishing hole. A dashing stoop or pounce down onto their prey, ending in a high-impact &quot;wallop&quot;, is fairly commonly recorded. Another common technique is the &quot;sweep&quot;, wherein they fly by and grasp the prey while continuing to fly. In winter, snowy owls have been shown to be able to &quot;snow plunge&quot; to capture prey in the subnivean zone, under at least of snow. Perhaps least frequently, snowy owls may pursue their prey on foot, in doing so never taking wing. Snowy owls have been known to capture night-migrating passerines and shorebirds, sometimes perhaps on the wing, as well as large and/or potentially dangerous birds that were caught in air by snowy owls during daylight. On the wing pursuits against other various other carnivorous birds are sometimes undertaken as well to kleptoparasitize the prey caught by the other birds. Few variations of hunting technique were observed in winter observations from Alberta, almost all of the hunts being with the sit-and-wait method (also known as still-hunts). Adult females in Alberta had a considerably better hunting rate than juvenile females. Much as in Alberta, in Syracuse, New York, 90% of 51 hunts were still-hunting, with the sweep variant used after perch departure in 31% of hunts and the pounce method in 45% of hunts. The Syracuse-wintering owls used tall perches, a mixture of manmade objects and trees of around high, in nearly 61% of hunts, while nearly 14% were from low perches (i.e. fence-posts, snow banks and scrap piles) about half as high as the tall perches and started from a ground position nearly 10% of the time. In Sweden, males hunted from a perch more so than did females and adults both focused on significantly smaller prey (small mammals) and may have had more success hunting than juvenile snowy owls. Some snowy owls can survive a fast for up to about 40 days off of fat reserves. These owls were found to have extremely thick subcutaneous fat deposits of and it is likely owls that overwinter in the Arctic rely heavily on these to survive during this scarce time, in combination with lethargic, energy-conserving behavior.

Snowy owls may not infrequently exploit prey inadvertently provided or compromised by human activities, including ducks injured by duck hunters, birds maimed by antenna wires, various animals caught in human traps and traplines as well as domestic or wild prey being bred or farmed by humans in enclosures. A wide variety of accrued reports show that the snowy owl that scavenging on carrion is not uncommon (despite having once been thought to be very rare in all owls), including instances of reindeer (&quot;Rangifer tarandus&quot;) body parts brought to nests and owls following polar bears to secondarily feed on their kills. Even huge marine mammals such as walrus (&quot;Odobenus rosmarus&quot;) and whales can be fed upon by these owls when the opportunity occurs. Snowy owls produce a pellet that in different areas averages a median of about , averaging up to in length as in Europe.

===Prey spectrum===

The snowy owl is primarily a hunter of mammals. Most especially, they often live off of the northerly lemmings. Sometimes other similar rodents like voles and mice can also be found frequently in the snowy owl&#x27;s foods. It is R-selected, meaning that it is an opportunistic breeder capable of taking advantage of increases in prey numbers and diversity, despite its apparent specialization. Birds are commonly taken as well, and may regularly include passerines, northern seabirds, ptarmigan and ducks, among others. Sometimes infrequent consumption of other prey such as beetles, crustaceans and occasionally amphibians and fish is reported (of these only fish are known to have been identified to prey species). It also takes carrion outside the breeding season. All told, more than 200 prey species have been known to be taken by snowy owls around the world. Generally, like other large owls (including even bigger owls like the Eurasian eagle-owl), prey selection tends toward quite small prey, usually small mammals, but they can alternate freely with prey that is much larger than typical given the opportunity or even bigger than themselves, including relatively large mammals and several types of large bird of almost any age. One study estimated for the biomes of Alaska and Canada, mean prey sizes for snowy owls were , in western North America, the mean prey size was and in eastern North America was , while the mean prey size in northern Fennoscandia was similar (at ). The mean number of prey species for snowy owls per biome ranged from 12 to 28. The opportunistic nature of snowy owls has long been known during their primarily winter observed feeding habits (leading to their unpopular nature and frequent persecution well into the 20th century).

===Summer diet===

The snowy owl&#x27;s biology is closely tied to the availability of lemmings. These herbivorous rodents are largish members of the vole clan that are the predominant mammal of the tundra ecosystem alongside the reindeer and probably make up the majority of the mammalian biomass of the ecosystem. Lemmings are key architects of the soil, microtopography and plant life of the entire tundra. In the American lower Arctic areas, brown lemming of the &quot;Lemmus&quot; genus are predominant and tend to be found in lower, wetter habitats (feeding by preference on grasses sedges and mosses) while collared lemmings of the &quot;Dicrostonyx&quot; genus were in more arid, often higher elevation habitats with heathland and ate by preference willow leaves and forbs. The southerly brown lemmings behave differently than more northern collared lemming type, increasing almost limitlessly within preferred habitat whereas the collared type tends to spread to suboptimal habitats and therefore does not appear reach the high regional densities of the brown. Authorities now generally agree that there appears to be no synchrony between the brown and collared lemmings and the feeding access of snowy owls is irregular as a result, but snowy owls can likely alternate between the two lemming types as one or the other increases as they nomadically use different parts of the Arctic. It is possible that the rare coincidental mutual peak of both lemming types within a year results in the erratic high productivity that results in irruptions. Within individual Arctic lemming species, historically, populations can vary in rough 4- to 5-year trends. As a result, in areas such as Banks Island, the breeding rate of snowy owls can vary within a decade by about tenfold. Weights of lemmings taken can range from on Baffin Island, while those taken in Utqiaġvik averaged in female and male lemming, respectively. It was estimated based on captive daily food intake that a snowy owl may consume about of lemmings a day, though other estimates using voles show a daily need for about . On Southampton Island, 97% of the diet was lemmings. A very similar number of lemmings (nearly 100%) were found over 25 years of study in Utqiaġvik, amongst 42,177 cumulative prey items. Of 76 lemmings that could be identified to sex at a cache, male lemmings were found in the cache twice as often as female lemmings. While initial findings indicated on Wrangel Island that female lemmings outnumbered males in prey remains, to the contrary osteology indicated that, like Utqiaġvik, males were more often taken. However, the slightly larger, slower-moving females may be preferred when available.

In some areas, snowy owls can breed where lemmings are uncommon to essentially absent. Even in Utqiaġvik, where the diet is quite homogenously based in lemmings, the hatching of passerines, shorebirds, seabirds and waterfowl can provide a key resource when lemmings are not found regularly and may be the only means by which the young can survive at such lean times. In the Nome, Alaska area, the locally nesting snowy owls reportedly switched from lemmings to ptarmigans when the latter&#x27;s chicks hatched. A somewhat varying diet was also reported in Prince of Wales Island, Nunavut where 78.3% of the biomass was lemmings, with 17.8% from waterfowl, 3.3% from weasel and about 1% from other birds. In Fennoscandia, among 2,700 prey items only a third were Norway lemmings (&quot;Lemmus lemmus&quot;) and a majority were voles at 50.6%, probably largely the tundra vole (&quot;Microtus oeconomus&quot;). A more detailed glance at Finnish Lapland showed that amongst 2,062 prey items, 32.5% of the foods were Norway lemmings (though in some years the balance could range up to 58.1%), 28% were grey red-backed voles (&quot;Myodes rufocanus&quot;) and 12.6% were tundra voles, with birds constituting a very small amount of the prey balance (1.1%). In northern Sweden, a more homogenous diet was found with the Norway lemming constituting about 90% of the foods. In the Yamal Peninsula, 40% of the diet was collared lemmings, 34% were Siberian brown lemming (&quot;Lemmus sibiricus&quot;), 13% were &quot;Microtus&quot; voles and ptarmigan and ducks both constituting 8% and with other birds making up much of the remaining balance. In some parts of the tundra, snowy owls may opportunistically prey upon Arctic ground squirrels (&quot;Spermophilus parryii&quot;). In the Hooper Bay area (much farther south than they usually nest), various rodents, in highland areas, and waterfowl, in marshland, were taken while breeding. When historically breeding on Fetlar in Shetland, the main prey for snowy owls was European rabbits (&quot;Oryctolagus cuniculus&quot;), Eurasian oystercatcher (&quot;Haematopus ostralegus&quot;), parasitic jaegers (&quot;Stercorarius parasiticus&quot;) and Eurasian whimbrel (&quot;Numenius phaeopus&quot;), in roughly that order, followed by other bird species with most (rabbits and secondary birds) prey taken as adults but for the oystercatchers and jaegers which were taken largely as fully grown but only recently fledged juveniles. 22–26% of oystercatcher and jaeger young in the island were estimated to be taken by snowy owls.

Bird predation by nesting snowy owls is highly opportunistic. Willow (&quot;Lagopus lagopus&quot;) and rock ptarmigan (&quot;Lagopus muta&quot;) of any age are often fairly regular in the diet of breeding snowy owls but they cannot be said to particularly specialize on these. Evidence was found in the Yamal Peninsula that the snowy owls became the primary predator of willow ptarmigan and that the predation was so frequent, it may have been the cause of the change of their habitat usage to willow thickets by the local ptarmigan. The reliance on ptarmigan has caused some conservation trickle-down concern for the owls because ptarmigan are hunted in large numbers, with the hunters of Norway permitted to cull up to 30% of the regional population. In North America, avian prey on the breeding ground regularly varies from small passerines like snow buntings (&quot;Plectrophenax nivalis&quot;) and Lapland longspurs (&quot;Calcarius lapponicus&quot;) to large waterfowl like king (&quot;Somateria spectabilis&quot;) and common eider (&quot;Somateria mollissima&quot;) and usually the goslings but also occasionally adults of geese such as brants (&quot;Branta bernicla&quot;), snow geese (&quot;Anser caerulescens&quot;) and cackling geese (&quot;Branta hutchinsii&quot;). Drake eiders of often similar size to the owls themselves are not infrequently the largest prey amongst remains around the nest mound. One nest had the bodies of all eiders that attempting to nest in the vicinity around it. The threatened and declining Steller&#x27;s eider (&quot;Polysticta stelleri&quot;) when nesting in the Utqiaġvik area would appear to avoid the vicinity of snowy owl nests when selecting their own nesting sites due to the predation risk. Intermediately sized seabirds are often focused on in lieu of available lemmings. Foods were studied intensively in Iceland. Among 257 prey items found with a total prey mass of , birds made up 95% of the diet. The leading prey were adult rock ptarmigan, at 29.6% by number and 55.4% by biomass and adult European golden plover (&quot;Pluvialis apricaria&quot;), at 10.5% by number and 7.2% biomass. The rest of the balance was largely other shorebirds, which were taken slightly more often as chicks than adults. Pink-footed geese (&quot;Anser fabalis&quot;) were taken in equal number as goslings and adults, with respectively estimated average weights at these ages of . On the isle of Agattu, the diet consisted entirely of birds, as there are no mammals found there. The much favored food in Agattu was the ancient murrelet (&quot;Synthliboramphus antiquus&quot;), at 68.4% of the biomass and 46% by number, while the secondary prey were followed numerically by smaller Leach&#x27;s storm-petrels (&quot;Oceanodroma leucorhoa&quot;) (20.8%) and Lapland longspurs (10%) and in biomass by smallish ducks, the green-winged teal (&quot;Anas carolinensis&quot;) and harlequin duck (&quot;Histrionicus histrionicus&quot;) (13.4% biomass collectively). In the Murman Coast of Russia, also in the absence of lemmings, seabirds formed the largest part of the diet.

===Winter diet===

On the wintering grounds, mammals often predominate in the snowy owl&#x27;s food inland doing so less in coastal areas. Overall wintering snowy owls eat more diverse foods they do whilst breeding, furthermore coastal wintering snowy owls had more diverse diets than inland ones. As in summer, moderately sized water birds such as teal, northern pintail (&quot;Anas acuta&quot;) and numerous alcids and the like are often focused on when hunting birds. The diet in 62 pellets, amongst at least 75 prey items, from coastal Oregon showed the main foods as black rat (&quot;Rattus rattus&quot;) (at an estimated 40%), red phalarope (&quot;Phalaropus fulicarius&quot;) (31%) and bufflehead (&quot;Bucephala albeola&quot;) (19%). Witnessed attacks were mostly upon buffleheads in Oregon. In coastal southwestern British Columbia, the diet among 139 prey items was 100% avian. The predominant prey were water birds, mostly snatched directly from surface of the water and largely weighing , i.e. buffleheads (at 24% by number and 17.4% by biomass of foods) and horned grebes (&quot;Podiceps auritus&quot;) (at 34.9% by number and 24.6% by biomass), followed by variously other water birds, often the slightly larger species of glaucous-winged gull (&quot;Larus glaucescens&quot;) and the American wigeon (&quot;Mareca americana&quot;). A different study of this area also showed the predominance of ducks and other water birds to wintering snowy owls here, although Townsend&#x27;s vole (&quot;Microtus townsendii&quot; ) (10.65%) and snowshoe hare (&quot;Lepus americanus&quot;) (5.7%) were also notably in a sample of 122 prey items.

During winter, snowy owls consume more strongly nocturnal prey than lemmings such as &quot;Peromyscus&quot; mice and northern pocket gophers (&quot;Thomomys talpoides&quot;). In southern Alberta, 248 prey items were found with North American deermouse (&quot;Peromyscus maniculatus&quot;), at 54.8% by number, and meadow voles (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanica&quot;), at 27% by number, as the main foods of snowy owls over two years. Other prey in Alberta were grey partridge (&quot;Perdix perdix&quot;) (at 5.79% of total), jackrabbits, weasels and owls. Richardson&#x27;s ground squirrels (&quot;Urocitellus richardsonii&quot;) were consumed heavily in the Alberta study in a brief converged times of hibernation emergence and overwintering snowy owls. The sexual dimorphism in prey selection was also studied here, with male owls mainly focusing exclusively on the small rodents, females also took the same rodents but supplemented the diet with all alternate and larger prey. Overall, the meadow and montane voles (&quot;Microtus montanus&quot;) constituted 99% of over 4500 prey items in Montana. In Horicon Marsh in winter, 78% of the diet was meadow vole, with 14% being muskrats (&quot;Ondatra zibethicus&quot;), 6% ducks and smaller balances of rats and other birds. Snowy owls found in Michigan took meadow voles for 86% of the diet, white-footed mouse (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;) for 10.3% and northern short-tailed shrew (&quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot;) for 3.2%. Of 127 stomachs in New England in four irruptive winters from 1927 to 1942, of 155 prey items, 24.5% were brown rats, 11.6% were meadow voles and 10.3% were dovekie (&quot;Alle alle&quot;), with a smaller balance of snowshoe hare and birds from snow buntings to American black ducks (&quot;Anas rubripes&quot;). During the same years, stomach contents in Ontario included 40 identified prey items, led by brown rats (20%), white-footed mice (17.5%) and meadow voles (15%); of 81 prey items from Pennsylvania in 60 stomachs that were not empty, eastern cottontail (&quot;Sylvilagus floridanus&quot;) (32%), meadow vole (11.1%), domestic chicken (&quot;Gallus gallus domesticus&quot;) (11.1%) and northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;) (5%) were the most often identified prey species. Introduced common pheasants were found to be somewhat more vulnerable than native American gamebirds like ruffed grouse due to their tendency to crouch rather than flush when approached by a flighted predator like the snowy owl in a glade or field. Some snowy owls wintering on rocky coasts and jetties were known in New England to live almost entirely off of purple sandpipers (&quot;Calidris maritima&quot;). The availability of brown rats may draw snowy owls to seemingly unattractive settings such as garbage dumps and under bridges. Meanwhile, snowy owls wintering in Lowell, Massachusetts were seen to live largely off of rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;) caught off of buildings. Of 87 prey from stomachs in Maine, 35% were rats or mice, 20% were snowshoe hares and 10% were passerines. A small study of 20 prey items in an irruptive winter in Kansas found that 35% of the prey were red-winged blackbird (&quot;Agelaius phoeniceus&quot;), 15% prairie voles (&quot;Microtus ochrogaster&quot;) and 10% each by American coot (&quot;Fulica americana&quot;) and hispid cotton rats (&quot;Sigmodon hispidus&quot;).

On the isle of St. Kilda, 24 pellets were found for non-breeding snowy owls that stayed through the early summer. Of 46 prey items, the St Kilda field mouse (&quot;Apodemus sylvaticus hirtensis&quot;) was predominant by number at 69.6% but constituted 16.8% of biomass while adult Atlantic puffin (&quot;Fratercula arctica&quot;) constituted 63.5% of the prey biomass and 26% by number (rest of the balance being juvenile puffins and great skuas (&quot;Stercorarius skua&quot;)). The main subspecies of wood mouse was similarly dominant in the diet within County Mayo, Ireland and were presumably snatched at night due to their strict nocturnality. In Knockando, the winter diet was led by European rabbits (40.1%), red grouse (&quot;Lagopus lagopus scotica&quot;) (26.4%) and adult mountain hare (&quot;Lepus timidus&quot;) (20.9%) (in 156 pellets); in Ben Macdui, the diet was led by rock ptarmigan (72.3%), field voles (&quot;Microtus agrestis&quot;) and juvenile mountain hare (8.5%) (33 pellets); in Cabrach, the diet was led by red grouse (40%), mountain hare (20%) and European rabbit (15%) (16 pellets). Among 110 prey items found for snowy owls found wintering during irruption in southern Finland, all but 1 prey item were field voles (the only other prey being a single long-tailed duck (&quot;Clangula hyemalis&quot;)). Far to the east, wintering owls in the Irkutsky District were found to subsist mostly on narrow-headed voles (&quot;Microtus gregalis&quot;). In a wintering population in Kurgaldga Nature Reserve of Kazakhstan, the main foods were grey red-backed voles at 47.4%, winter white dwarf hamster (&quot;Phodopus sungorus&quot;) at 18.4%, steppe pika (&quot;Ochotona pusilla&quot;) at 7.9%, muskrat at 7.9%, Eurasian skylark (&quot;Alauda arvensis&quot;) at 7.9%, grey partridge at 5.3%, and both steppe polecat (&quot;Mustela eversmanii&quot;) and yellowhammer (&quot;Emberiza citrinella&quot;) at 2.6%. On the Kuril Islands, wintering snowy owls&#x27; main foods were reported as tundra voles, brown rats, ermines, and whimbrel, in roughly that order.

While most of the prey species are relatively small, snowy owls can prey on a fairly diverse size of birds and mammals. Data from the Logan Airport in over 6,000 pellets shows that meadow vole and brown rats predominated the diet in the area, supplanted by assorted birds both small and large. American black ducks were primarily taken among bird species with other birds taken here including relatively large and diverse species up to the size of Canada geese (&quot;Branta canadensis&quot;) and great blue herons (&quot;Ardea herodias&quot;) along with brants, American herring gulls (&quot;Larus argentatus&quot;), double-crested cormorants (&quot;Phalacrocorax auritus&quot;). Additionally, other birds as large as western capercaillie (&quot;Tetrao urogallus&quot;) (of both sexes), greater sage-grouse (&quot;Centrocercus urophasianus&quot;), yellow-billed loons (&quot;Gavia adamsii&quot;) and cygnets of Bewick&#x27;s swans (&quot;Cygnus columbianus bewickii&quot;) can be taken by snowy owl. Among large mammalian prey species, snowy owls prey on both young and adults of large leporids such as Arctic hare (&quot;Lepus arcticus&quot;), Alaskan hare (&quot;Lepus othus&quot;), mountain hare and white-tailed jackrabbits (&quot;Lepus townsendii&quot;). At the other end of the scale, the snowy owl has been known to take birds down to the size of dark-eyed juncos (&quot;Junco hyemalis&quot;) and mammals down the size of common shrews (&quot;Sorex araneus&quot;). Fish are rarely taken anywhere but the snowy owl has been known to prey upon Arctic char (&quot;Salvelinus alpinus&quot;) and lake trout (&quot;Salvelinus namaycush&quot;).

===Interspecific predatory relationships===

The snowy owl is in many ways a very unique owl and differs from other species of owl in its ecological niche. Only one other owl, the short-eared owl, is known to breed in the High Arctic. However, the snowy owl shares its primary prey, the brown and collared lemmings, with a number of other avian predators. In sometimes differing parts of the Arctic, competing predators for lemmings are, in addition to short-eared owls, pomarine jaegers (&quot;Stercorarius pomarinus&quot;), long-tailed jaegers (&quot;Stercorarius longicaudus&quot;), rough-legged buzzards (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;), hen harriers (&quot;Circus cyaenus&quot;), northern harriers (&quot;Circus hudsonius&quot;) and generally less specialized gyrfalcons (&quot;Falco rusticollis&quot;), peregrine falcons (&quot;Falco peregrinus&quot;), glaucous gulls (&quot;Larus hypoboreus&quot;) and common ravens (&quot;Corvus corax&quot;). Certain carnivorous mammals, especially the Arctic fox and, in this region, the ermine, are also specialized to hunt lemmings. Most of the lemming predators are intolerant of the competition given the scattered nature of lemming populations and will displace and/or kill one another given the chance. However, given the need to conserve energy in the extreme environment, the predators may react passively to one another. When unusually breeding south in the Subarctic such as western Alaska, Scandinavia and central Russia, the number of predators with which the snowy owls are obligated to share prey and compete with may be too numerous to name. The taking of the young and eggs of snowy owls has been committed by a large number of predators: hawks and eagles, the northern jaegers, peregrine and gyrfalcons, glaucous gulls, common ravens, Arctic wolves (&quot;Canis lupus arctos&quot;), polar bears, brown bears (&quot;Ursus arctos&quot;), wolverines (&quot;Gulo gulo&quot;) and perhaps especially the Arctic fox. Adult snowy owls on the breeding grounds are far less vulnerable and can be justifiably qualified as an apex predator. Instances of the killing of adult snowy owls on the breeding grounds have been witnessed to be committed by a pair of pomarine jaegers on an incubating adult female snowy owl (possibly merely a competitive attack as she was left uneaten) and by an Arctic fox that killed an adult male snowy owl.

When it goes south to winter outside of the Arctic, the snowy owl has the potential to interact with a number of additional predators. By necessity, it shares its wintertime diverse prey with a number of formidable predators. These are known to include their cousins, the great horned owl and the Eurasian eagle-owl. They are relieved of heavy competition from the related species by differing temporal activity, i.e. being more likely to actively hunt in the daytime, and by habitat, using rather more open (quite often nearly treeless) habitats than them. During a study of wintering snowy owls in Saskatchewan, the authors indicated that the snowy owls may avoid areas inhabited and defended by great horned owls. Although they usually occurred here outside of an radius of central great horned owl ranges, they did not avoid the radius and different habitat usage may be a dictating factor. Given their mildly slighter size, it is unlikely that great horned owls (unlike the larger eagle-owl) would regularly dominate snowy owls in interactions and either species may give way to others depending on the size and disposition of the owls involved. Little study has been undertaken into the trophic competition of snowy owls with other predators during winter and, due to their scarcity, few predators are likely to expel much energy on competitive interactions with them, although many other predators will engage in anti-predator mobbing of snowy owls. Largely in winter, snowy owls have been the victim of a number of larger avian predators, though attacks are likely to be singular and rare. Instances of predation on snowy owls are known to have been committed several times in winter only by Eurasian eagle-owls. Additionally, golden eagles (&quot;Aquila chrysaetos&quot;) have been known to prey on snowy owls as well as all northern sea eagles: the bald (&quot;Haliaeetus leucocephalus&quot;), white-tailed (&quot;Haliaeetus albicilla&quot;) and Steller&#x27;s sea eagles (&quot;Haliaeetus pelagicus&quot;). Snowy owls are also sometimes killed by birds that are mobbing them. In one instance, a peregrine falcon killed a snowy owl in a stoop after the owl had killed a fledgling falcon. Anecdotal reports indicate predation by gyrfalcons (on snowy owls of unknown age and condition) but it was possibly also an act of mobbing. In another, a huge throng of Arctic terns (&quot;Sterna paradisaea&quot;) relentlessly swarmed and attacked a snowy owl until it met its demise.

Almost certainly more often than being a victim of other predators, snowy owls are known to dominate, kill and feed on a large diversity of other predators. Snowy owls, much like other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls, will opportunistically kill other birds of prey and predators. Although they will readily plunder the nests of other raptorial birds given the opportunity, most predations are on full-grown raptorial birds during winter due to the scarcity of raptor nests in the open tundra. In addition, most competing predators of the Arctic, except the very large mammals, are probably vulnerable to a hungry snowy owl. In data from the Logan Airport alone over different winters, the snowy owls were observed to have preyed upon an impressive diversity of other raptorial birds: rough-legged buzzards, American kestrels (&quot;Falco sparverius&quot;), peregrine falcons, barn owls, other snowy owls, barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), northern saw-whet owls (&quot;Aegolius acadicus&quot;) and short-eared owls. While owls are likely encountered during corresponding hunting times, it is likely that the swift falcons are usually ambushed at night (much as other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls will do). In both the tundra and the wintering ground, there are several accounts of predation by snowy owls on short-eared owls. In addition, snowy owls have been known to prey on northern harriers, northern goshawks (&quot;Accipiter gentilis&quot;) and gyrfalcons. Snowy owls are also capable of taking large mammalian carnivores. Both juvenile and adult Arctic foxes have been known to fall prey to snowy owls, while predation by snowy owls on red foxes was reported in the Irkutsky District of Russia. A wintering snowy owl in Saskatchewan was observed to have preyed on an adult red fox (&quot;Vulpes vulpes&quot;) weighing around which may be the largest known prey known for snowy owls. Other relatively large carnivoran prey include adult house cat (&quot;felis catus&quot;), American mink (&quot;Mustela vision&quot;), and striped skunk (&quot;Mephitis mephitis&quot;). Also, several members of the weasel family, both small and relatively large, are known to be opportunistically hunted by snowy owls. As a result of its potential predator status, the snowy owl is frequently mobbed at all times of the year by other predatory birds, including fierce dive-bombing by several of the northern falcons on the wintering grounds, including even by the relatively tiny but fierce and very agile merlin (&quot;Falco columbarius&quot;). The much bulkier snowy owls cannot match the speed and flight ability of a falcon and may be almost relentlessly tormented by some birds such as peregrines.

==Breeding==

===Pair bond and breeding territory===
In Utqiaġvik, of 239 recorded breeding attempts, 232 were monogamous, the other 7 social bigamy. On Baffin Island, 1 male bred with 2 females and sired 11 total fledged young. Another case of bigamy was reported in Norway where the 2 females bred to one male were apart in nest site location. On Feltar from 1967 to 1975, a male bred with two females, 1 younger and was possibly his own daughter. In the Feltar males first time breeding with both females, he did not bring food to the younger female. However, when older female disappeared the following year, the male and younger female producing 4 young, but disappeared the subsequent year altogether in 1975. There are also unconfirmed cases of polyandry, with 1 female being fed by 2 males. Snowy owls can breed once per year but when food is scarce many do not even attempt to breed. Despite frequent wandering in search of food, they generally adhere more to a strict breeding season than short-eared owls nesting in the tundra. 9 radio-tagged female snowy owls about Bylot Island were tracked to study how pre-laying snow cover affects their searching behavior for breeding areas. These tracked females searched an average of 36 days and covered an average of . It is thought that the male and female mutually find an attractive breeding spot independently and converge. The breeding territory normally averages about as in both Baffin Island and Ellesmere Island but varies in accordance to abundance of food and density of owls. Nesting territories average at Baffin island in the range of during poor lemming years. Nesting territories may up to on Southampton Island and had a mean distance of between active nests. In Utqiaġvik, nesting pairs can vary from none to at least 7 and the territories average , with mean nest distances of . In the Norwegian highlands, nesting occurs only at times of plenty distances of between nests, averaging . Males marks territory with singing and display flights and likely always initiates. During the display, he engages in exaggerated wing beats with a shallow undulating and bouncy courtship flight with wings held in a dihedral. He often drops to the ground but then flies again to only glide gently back down. Overall, the flight is somewhat reminiscent of the flight of a moth. Females will answer her mate with her song during courtship. While courting, the male often also carries a lemming in his bill, then bows with cocked tail, similarly as in related owls (seldom displaying some other prey like snow buntings). He then flaps his wings open in an emphatic manner, with the ground display being relatively brief (about 5 minutes). The female may possibly refuse to breed if ritual not performed. A possible courtship was engaged in by a male in southern Saskatchewan when a female was sighted. On Southampton Island, at least 20 males observed in late May in a &quot;lemming year&quot;. Nesting territory defense displays, not highly different from courtship displays, includes undulating flight and stiffly raised wings with bouts of exaggerated, delayed wing beats, looking like enormous white moths exposing their white wings under the sun. At times, competing males will interlock claws in mid-air. Territorial and nuptial displays are followed by a ground display by the male with the wings arched up in an &quot;angel&quot; posture, visible for well over a mile.

===Nest sites===

Most individuals arrive at the nest site by April or May with a few overwintering arctic exceptions. Males advertises potential nest sites to his mate by scratching the ground and spreading his wings over it. The nest is usually a shallow depression on a windswept eminence in the open tundra. There seems to be a variety of qualifiers for appropriate nest sites. The nest site is typically snow-free and dry relative to the surrounding environment, usually with a good view of the surrounding landscape. The nest may be made of ridges, elevated mounds, high polygons, hummocks, hills, human-made mounds and occasionally rocky outcrops. If covered with vegetation, taller plants that may obstruct view are plucked away sometimes. The nest sites are often long-established and naturally created by the freeze-thaw process of the tundra. Gravel bars may be used as well. The female may take the most active role in the nest&#x27;s condition of any owl species. No owl build their own nests but female snowy owls take about three days constructing a scrape, digging with her claws and rotating until a fairly circular bowl is formed. She will still not construct or add foreign materials to the nest (despite some circumstantial evidence of moss and grass from outside the nest mound being found). In two separate cases in Utqiaġvik, two separate females dug out a second scrape to the side and below the main nests and appeared to have called all chicks to the more secluded nest to ride out severe weather until the skies cleared. The Utqiaġvik nest scrapes averaged in 91 with a mean depth of while the scrapes were smaller in Hooper Bay, reportedly diameter and in depth. Occasionally, in the lower tundra, snowy owls may too use old nests of rough-legged buzzards as well as abandoned eagle nests. Unlike other northerly breeding raptorial birds, the snowy owl is not known to nest on cliffs and the like, so do not enter into direct competition with eagles, falcons, ravens or other &quot;Bubo&quot; owls when nesting to the relative south. The area of nest mound often has a relatively rich plant life which attract the lemmings, which may tunnel right under and around the owl&#x27;s nest. Geese, ducks and shorebirds of several species known to gain incidental protection by nesting close to snowy owls. Conversely, the snowy owls will sometimes kill and eat both young and adults of these birds, which implies a trade-off in the benefits.

===Eggs===

Egg-laying normally begins during early May to the first 10 days of June. Late thaws are harmful to them since they allow too little time for the full breeding process, with particularly importance given to good food supply in May for adults, even more so apparently than food supply in July when young are being fed. Late nests are possible cases of inexperienced pairs, low food supplies, bigamy or even replacement clutches. The clutch is extremely variable in size averaging around 7–9, with up to 15 or 16 eggs recorded in extreme cases. The clutch size very large relative to related species. Mean clutch sizes were 7.5 in a sample of 24 in Hooper Bay (range of 5–11); 6.7 in a sample of seven from Utqiaġvik (4–9); 9 in a sample of a sample of 5 in Baffin Island; 9.8 on Victoria Island; 8.4 (in a sample of 14) on Elsemere Island; 7.4 on Wrangel Island and 7.74 in Finnish Lapland. The average clutch size was 9.8 in a good year in Victoria Island while in a good year in Utqiaġvik the mean was 6.5. The clutch is laid directly to the ground and are pure, glossy white. An average egg is around with a range of heights from and diameter of . Egg weights are around , the median or average being in different datasets. The average egg size is relatively small, about 20% smaller than Eurasian eagle-owl eggs and 8% smaller than great horned owl eggs. Laying intervals are normally 2 days (41–50 hours mostly). The laying intervals can range up to 3–5 days in inclement weather. The laying of a clutch of 11 eggs can take 20–30 days, while a more typical nest of around 8 takes about up to 16 days. The interval between the 8th and 9th eggs can be up to about 4 days. Incubation begins with the first egg and is by female alone, while she is fed by her mate.

===Parental behavior===

Food is brought to the nest by males and surplus food is stored nearby. Females in breeding season often develop a very extensive brood patch which in this species is a fairly enormous, high vascularized featherless area of pink belly skin. Incubation lasts 31.8–33 days (unconfirmed and possibly dubious reports from as little as 27 to as much as 38-day incubations). The female alone broods the young, often while simultaneously incubating still unhatched eggs. Sometimes older chicks incidentally brood their younger siblings and females may shelter the young under her wings during inclement weather. When first feeding the young, the female may dismantle prey to feed the young only the softer body parts then gradually ramping up the size of proportions until they eat a whole prey item. Aggressive encounters with parent snowy owls are said to be &quot;genuinely dangerous&quot; and one resource claimed the snowy owl to be the bird species with the most formidable nest defense displays towards humans. The usual response to sighted humans near the nest is mild but continued approach begins to increasingly irritate the parents. At times, humans are forcefully dive-bombed upon, while other potential threats are dealt with in a “forward-threat” where the male walks towards the intruders, engaging in impressive feather-raising and fanning out of half-spread wings until they run forward and slash with both their feet and bill. Fairly serious injuries have been sustained in the worst of snowy owl defensive attacks, including cranial trauma, requiring researchers to make the long trek back to medical care, although human fatalities are not known. Snowy owl parents have been seen to aggressively attacked glaucous gulls, arctic fox and dogs in breeding ground in Utqiaġvik. Non-predatory animals like caribou in Utqiaġvik and sheep (&quot;Ovis aries&quot;) in Fetlar are attacked as well, possibly to avoid potential trampling of the eggs or the young. Males are said to do the majority of nest defense but the female will also often become involved as well. Analysis showed in Lapland, Sweden, that females in nest defense against people engaged in vocal displays (warning and mewing calls) and that males did not engage in mewing but did engage in most hooting calls, many warning calls and almost all physical attacks. In other instances, distraction displays are engaged in against predators, with a &quot;broken-wing act&quot; including high, thin squeals interspersed with weird squeaks, often taking flight only to quickly fall from the sky and imitate a struggle. One author recorded a male to draw him about from the nest before ceasing. 77% of 45 distraction displays in Lapland, Sweden were by females.

===Development of young===

Hatching intervals are generally from 1 to 3 days, quite often within 37–45 hours apart. New chicks are semi-altricial (i.e. typically helpless and blind), initially being white and rather wet but dry by the end of the first day. The weight of 7 hatchlings was , with an average of while 3 were . Due to the pronounced asynchrony of the egg-laying and hatching, the size difference between siblings can be enormous and in some cases when the smallest chick weighs only , the biggest chick already has attained a weight of around . When the oldest chick is about 3 weeks, the female will start to hunt as well as the male and both may directly feed the young although in some cases they may not need hunt very much if lemmings are particularly numerous. Caches of lemmings around a nest may include more than 80 lemmings that can support the family. Unlike many owls, the chicks of snowy owls are not known to behave aggressively toward one another or to engage in siblicide, perhaps in part due to the need for energy conservance. Some cases of cannibalism of chicks by the family group were thought to be cases where chicks die from other causes. When they are about 2 weeks, the chicks may begin to walk around the nest site which they leave by 18–28 days, although they are still unable to fly and may find safety in nooks and crannies of vegetation and rocks usually only about from the nest mound, as well as via their parents defense. Leaving the nest is thought to likely be an anti-predator strategy. The male snowy owl may drop fresh prey deliveries directly on the ground near the wandering young. After about three weeks of age, the young may wander fairly widely, rarely to , but usually stay within of the nest mound. Threat postures by young in reaction to researchers were first noticeable at about 20–25 days of age and common at about 28 days and the chicks can be impressively quick and agile-footed. The first fledgling occurs at around 35–50 days, and by 50–60 days the young can fly well and hunt on their own. The total care period is for 2–3.5 months, increasing in length with increased size of the brood. Although independence was once thought to be sought by late August or early September but is more likely by late September to October when migration season for the species begins. The nesting cycle is similar in length to the Arctic short-eared owls and faster than Eurasian eagle-owls by up to 2 months.

===Maturity and nesting success===

Sexual maturity reached the following year but the first breeding is normally at no sooner than the end of the second year of life. There is little strong evidence of typical age of first breeding but initial breeding by males could be inferred by the plumage of males in Utqiaġvik by plumage. At that stage, which the males were essentially all pure white, most were aged to about 3 to 4 years old. The snowy owl seems to markedly inconsistent in regard to breeding every year, often taking at least up to two years between attempts and sometimes as much as nearly a decade. 7 satellite-marking females in Canada proved that they did breed in consecutive years, with 1 breeding over 3 consecutive years. In 23 years at Utqiaġvik, snowys bred in 13 of them. Nesting success can reach 90–100% in even the largest clutches in high lemming years. While over the course of 21 years, 260 total nests were recorded in Utqiaġvik. There, from 4–54 nests were recorded annually. The Utqiaġvik nests bore 3 to 10 sized-clutches with a mean of 6 eggs per nest and an annual mean hatching success from 39 to 91%. 31–87% of chicks were able to depart on foot and 48–65% were annually estimated to survive to fledge; elsewhere, 40% survived to fledge. In another set, 97% of observed eggs both hatched and fledged. In Norway, the fledging success from 10 nests was much lower at about 46%. Norwegian data, which previously indicated it to be an almost accidental breeder in northern Norway, indicates that it is a more regular breeder than expected, though. 3 good years were found for snowy owls between 1968 and 2005: 1974 (when there were 12 pairs), 1978 (22 pairs) and 1985 (20 pairs), with 14 additional locations when potential (but not confirmed) breeding has occurred. The main determinable causes of nest failure were deemed to be starvation and exposure. A number of Norwegian and Finnish nests were known to fail due to severe black fly parasitism.

==Longevity==
The snowy owl can live a long life for a bird. Records show that the oldest snowy owls in captivity can live to 25 to even 30 years of age. Typical lifespans probably reach around 10 years in the wild. The longest known lifespan in the wild was of a snowy owl initially banded (possibly in its first winter) in Massachusetts and recovered dead in Montana 23 years and 10 months later. The annual survival rate for twelve females on Bylot Island was estimated at around 85–92.3%. It is often reputed that snowy owls frequently died from starvation, with historical accounts opining that they &quot;had to&quot; leave their breeding grounds due to lemming &quot;crashes&quot; but would starve to the south. However, it was proven fairly early on that snowy owls often do survive throughout the winter. This is reinforced somewhat by small radio-tracking and banding studies of snowy owls in the northern Great Plains and the intermountain valleys of the northwestern United States. More circumstantial evidence shows a lack of starvation in the eastern part of North America as well. There is evidence that some adults are known to return to the same wintering areas in ensuing years, areas which are far south of their breeding range. At Logan Airport, most snowy owls that are seen appear to be in good condition. Of 71 dead snowy owls found in winter in the northern Great Plains, 86% died from assorted traumas, including collisions with automobiles and other, usually manmade, objects as well as electrocutions and shootings. Only 14% of the 71 deaths were due to apparent starving. Data showed some owls appeared to incur injuries but healed and survived. More evidence was found in wintering snowy owls in New York of healed fractures, though some may require surgery to recover. 537 wintering birds in Saskatchewan were studied based on fat reserves, which were superior in females over males and adults over juveniles; while 31% of females lacked fat reserves, at least 45% of males found starving or in a state of infirmity were males and 63% turned into Wildlife rehabilitation centres were also males. In British Columbia, of 177 snowy owl deaths, of owls to die, only a small percentage were due to natural causes, such as assumed starvation at 13% and 12% were &quot;found dead&quot;. One fledgling on Fetlar died due to pneumonia and &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, while a second died from &quot;Aspergillosis&quot;. Evidence shows that in Utqiaġvik during exceptionally prolonged rains (i.e. 2 to 3 days), nest-departed young were vulnerable to starvation, leading to hypothermia and pneumonia. Due to their natural history, the snowy owl may be affected more severely by blood parasitism than other raptors, due to lowered immunity. Conversely, they appear to have lower levels of ectoparasites such as chewing lice than other large owls per large samples from Manitoba. The snowy owls averaged about 3.9 chewing lice per host against 7.5 for great grey owls and 10.5 for great horned owls.

==Status==
This species presence and numbers is dependent on amount of food available. In &quot;lemming years&quot;, snowy owls can appear to be quite abundant in habitat. Numbers of snowy owls are difficult to estimate even within studies that take place over decades due to the nomadic nature of adults. The population of Scandinavia has long been perceived as very small and ephemeral with Finland holding 0–100 pairs; Norway holding 1–20 pairs and Sweden holding 1–50 pairs. A low breeding population within European Russia has been estimated to hold 1,300–4,500 pairs and Greenland to have 500–1,000 pairs. Other than northern part of the American continent, a majority of the snowy owl&#x27;s breeding range is in northern Russia, but overall estimates are not known. An exact count of 4,871 individuals were seen on surveys between the Indigirka and Kolyma rivers. The numbers estimated by Partners in Flight and other authors by the 2000s was that North America held about 72,500 snowy owls, about 30% of which were juveniles. The Canadian population of snowy owls was estimated at 10,000–30,000 (in the 1990s) or even to 50,000–100,000 individuals, perhaps improbably. Within Canada, the population on Banks Island was once claimed at up to 15,000–25,000 in productive years and in Queen Elizabeth Islands at about 932 individuals. Alaska is the only state with breeding snowy owls but has probably quite a bit fewer breeding owls than does Canada. Furthermore, the Partners in Flight and the IUCN estimated that the world population was roughly 200,000–290,000 individuals as recently as the 2000s. However, in the 2010s, it has been discovered that all prior estimates were extremely excessive and that more precise numbers could be estimated with better surveying, phylogeographic data and more insights into the owl&#x27;s free-wheeling wanderings. It is now believed that there are only 14,000–28,000 mature breeding pairs of snowy owls in the world. During lemming declines, the number of nesting females may drop down to as low as 1,700 worldwide, a dangerously low number, and the number of snowy owls worldwide is less than 10% of what it was once thought to be. Due to the small and rapidly declining population, the snowy was uplisted in 2017 to being a vulnerable species by the IUCN. A 52% decline has been inferred for the North American population since the 1960s with another even more drastic estimate placing the decline from 1970 to 2014 at 64%. Trends are harder to delineate in Scandinavia but a similar downward trend is thought to be occurring. Snowy owls are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES) meaning international trade (including in parts and derivatives) is regulated.

===Anthropogenic mortality and persecution===

Of 438 band encounters in the USG banding laboratory, almost all causes of death that could be determined, whether intentional or not, were correlated with human interference. 34.2% or 150 were dead due to unknown causes, 11.9% were shot, 7.1% were hit by automobiles, 5.5% were found dead or injured on highways, 3.9% were collision from towers or wires, 2.7% were in animal traps, 2.1% in airplane birdstrikes, 0.6% were entangled while the remaining 33.3% recovered injured due to assorted or unknown causes. Snowy owls are endangered by heavy airport usage resulting in birdstrikes. Many such collisions are known in Canada and likely also in Siberia and Mongolia . Despite their danger to planes, no human fatalities have been recorded in collisions with this species. Snowy owls are always far outnumbered in Canadian airports in winter by short-eared owls. However, relative to its scarcity, the snowy accounts for a very large balance of the birdstrikes recorded at American airports due to the attractiveness of the habitat, accounting for 4.6% of 2456 recorded collisions (the barn owl is the most frequently involved in birdstrikes). The species is locally vulnerable to pesticides. The placement of buildings in the Utqiaġvik is now thought to have displaced some snowy owls. In Norway, potential sources of disturbance near the nests include tourism, recreation, reindeer husbandry, motorized traffic, dogs, photographers, ornithologists and scientists. Some biologist have expressed concern that radio-tagging of snowy owls may cause some unclear detrimental effect on snowy owls but little evidence is known if they actually make the owls more susceptible to death.

Snowy owls can be quite wary, as they are not infrequently hunted by Circumpolar peoples. Historically, the snowy owl was one of the most persecuted owl species. In the irruption of 1876–77, an estimated 500 snowy owls were shot, with similar numbers in 1889–90 and an estimated 500–1,000 killed in Ontario alone during 1901–02 invasion and about 800 killed in the 1905–06 invasion. Indigenous people of the Arctic historically killed snowy owls as food but now many communities in northern Alaska are fairly modernized, therefore biologists feel that the permitted killing of snowy owls by the indigenous is outdated. The consumption of snowy owls by humans has been proven as far back as ancient cave deposits in France and elsewhere, and they have even been considered as one of the most frequent food species for early humans. They do not shun developed areas especially with old field that hold rodents and, due to lack of human experience, can be extremely tame and unable to escape armed humans. In British Columbia, of 177 snowy owl deaths, the most often diagnosed cause of death was shootings at 25%, often well after legal protection of the species. The number poached snowy owls in Ontario is opined to be unusually high considering their scarcity. While the species was once otherwise killed as food and then later shot out of resentment for perceived threats against domestic and favored game stock, the reasoning behind ongoing shooting of snowy owls into the 21st century is not well-understood. Siberian snowy owls are frequently victim to baited fox traps, with possibly up to around 300 killed in a year based upon very rough estimates. Warfarin poisoning in use as rodenticides are known to kill some wintering snowy owls, including up to six at Logan Airport alone. Mercury concentrations, most likely through bioaccumulation, have been detected in snowy owls in the Aleutian Islands but it is not known whether fatal mercury poisoning has occurred. PCBs may have killed some snowy owls in concentration. Some airports have advocated and instituted the practice of shooting owls to avoid birdstrikes but successful translocation is possible and preferred given the species protected status.

Climate change is now widely perceived to perhaps the primary driver of the snowy owl&#x27;s decline. As temperatures continue to rise, abiotic factors such as increased rain and reduced snow are likely to effect lemming populations and, in turn, snowy owls. These and potentially many other issues (possibly including modifying migrating behavior, vegetation composition, increased insect, disease and parasite activities, risk of hyperthermia) are a matter of concern. Additionally, reduction of sea ice, which snowy owls are now known to rely extensively on, as a result of warming climates, impacts could be significant. The effect of climate change was essentially confirmed in northern Greenland where a perhaps irrevocable collapse of the lemming population was observed. From 1998 to 2000, the lemming numbers appeared to have quickly declined. The number of lemmings per hectare (ha) is less than one-fifth of what it once was in Greenland (i.e. from 12 lemmings per ha to less than 2 per ha at peak). This is almost certainly correlated with a 98% decline in owl productivity as well as that of the local stoats (the long-tailed jaeger and Arctic foxes, though previously thought to be almost as reliant on lemmings, seem to be more loosely coupled and more generalized and did not decline as much). The amount of lemming mounds is much less than it once in northern Greenland and any variety of population cycle has been apparently abandoned by what remains of the lemmings.

==In popular culture==
* The &quot;Harry Potter&quot; books by J. K. Rowling, and subsequent films of the same name, feature a female snowy owl named Hedwig. Concern was expressed by some in the media that the popularity of the Harry Potter films would cause an increase in the illicit owl trade of snowy owls. However, there was no strong evidence of an increase in snowy owls confiscated from the black market, despite a larger than typical number of snowy owls being reported at wildlife centres.
* The snowy owl ( in French) is the avian symbol of Quebec.

<text>The wood duck or Carolina duck (Aix sponsa) is a partially migratory species of perching duck found in North America. The male is one of the most colorful North American waterfowls.

==Taxonomy==
The wood duck was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Anas sponsa&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;summer duck&quot; from Carolina that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in the first volume of his &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot; that was published between 1729 and 1731. Linnaeus specified the type locality as North America but this has been restricted to Carolina following Catesby. The wood duck is now placed together with the mandarin duck in the genus &quot;Aix&quot; that was introduced in 1828 by the German naturalist Friedrich Boie. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is an Ancient Greek word for an unidentified diving bird mentioned by Aristotle. The specific epithet &quot;sponsa&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;bride&quot; (from &quot;spodere&quot; meaning &quot;pledge&quot;).
==Description==
The wood duck is a medium-sized perching duck. A typical adult is from in length with a wingspan of between . The wood duck&#x27;s weight ranges from . This is about three-quarters the length of an adult mallard. It shares its genus with the Asian mandarin duck (&quot;Aix galericulata&quot;).

The adult male has stunning multicolored iridescent plumage and red eyes, with a distinctive white flare down the neck. The female, less colorful, has a white eye-ring and a whitish throat. Both adults have crested heads. The speculum is iridescent blue-green with a white border on the trailing edge.

The male&#x27;s call is a rising whistle, &quot;jeeeeee&quot;; the females utter a drawn-out, rising squeal, &quot;do weep do weep&quot;, when flushed, and a sharp &quot;cr-r-ek, cr-e-ek&quot; for an alarm call.

==Distribution==
The birds are year-round residents in parts of its southern range, but the northern populations migrate south for the winter. They overwinter in the southern United States near the Atlantic Coast. 75% of the wood ducks in the Pacific Flyway are non-migratory. Due to their attractive plumage, they are also popular in waterfowl collections and as such are frequently recorded in Great Britain as escapees—populations have become temporarily established in Surrey in the past, but are not considered to be self-sustaining in the fashion of the closely related mandarin duck. Along with the mandarin duck, the wood duck is considered an invasive species in England and Wales, and it is illegal to release them into the wild. Given its native distribution, the species is also a potential natural vagrant to Western Europe and there have been records in areas such as Cornwall, Scotland and the Isles of Scilly, which some observers consider may relate to wild birds; however, given the wood duck&#x27;s popularity in captivity, it would be extremely difficult to prove their provenance.

==Behavior==
===Breeding===
Their breeding habitat is wooded swamps, shallow lakes, marshes, ponds and creeks in the eastern United States, the west coast of the United States, some adjacent parts of southern Canada, and the west coast of Mexico. They get their name from being one of the only species of ducks who perch and nest in trees. In recent decades, the breeding range has expanded towards the Great Plains. Currently most breeding occurs in the Mississippi alluvial valley. They usually nest in cavities in trees close to water, although they will take advantage of nesting boxes in wetland locations. Other species may compete with them for nesting cavities, such as birds of prey, as well as mammals such as grey squirrels, and these animals may also occupy nest boxes meant for wood ducks. Wood ducks may end up nesting up to a mile away from their water source as a result. Females line their nests with feathers and other soft materials, and the elevation provides some protection from predators such as raccoons, owls, and hawks. Unlike most other ducks, the wood duck has sharp claws for perching in trees and can, in southern regions, produce two broods in a single season—the only North American duck that can do so.

Wood ducks typically lay their first eggs from February to April. Females typically lay seven to fifteen eggs which are incubated for an average of thirty days. However, if nesting boxes are placed too close together, females may lay eggs in the nests of their neighbours, which may lead to nests with thirty eggs or more and unsuccessful incubation—a behaviour known as &quot;nest dumping&quot;.

The day after they hatch, the precocial ducklings climb to the opening of the nest cavity and jump down from the nest tree to the ground. The morning after hatching, the hen will leave the nest to feed and make sure it is safe for her chicks. When she decides it is safe, she uses a maternal call to call the chicks out. Chicks can jump from as high as 50 feet, surviving by landing either in water, or on top of soft material such as leaf litter. The mother calls them to her and guides them to water. The ducklings can swim and find their own food by this time. Wood ducks prefer nesting over water so the young have a soft landing.

===Food and feeding===
Wood ducks feed by dabbling (feeding from the surface rather than diving underwater) or grazing on land. They mainly eat berries, acorns, and seeds, but also insects, making them omnivores. They are able to crush acorns after swallowing them within their gizzard.

==Conservation==
The population of the wood duck was in serious decline in the late 19th century as a result of severe habitat loss and market hunting for both meat and plumage for the ladies&#x27; hat market in Europe. By the beginning of the 20th century, wood ducks had become rare, almost disappearing in many areas. In response to the Migratory Bird Treaty, established in 1916, and enactment of the U.S. Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, wood ducks finally began to repopulate. By enforcing existing hunting regulations and protecting woodland and marsh habitat, wood duck populations began to rebound starting in the 1920s. The erection of nesting boxes starting in the 1930s further assisted wood duck conservation. A synopsis of evidence from multiple studies performed by Williams et al. (2020) concluded that providing artificial nesting sites for wildfowl, including wood ducks, is beneficial. Wood duck boxes have been found to be less effective than natural, hollow, dead trees but remain overall beneficial for the population.

Landowners as well as park and refuge managers can encourage wood ducks by building wood duck nest boxes near lakes, ponds, and streams. Fulda, Minnesota, has adopted the wood duck as an unofficial mascot, and a large number of nest boxes can be found in the area.

Expanding North American beaver (&quot;Castor canadensis&quot;) populations throughout the wood duck&#x27;s range have also helped the population rebound as beavers create an ideal forested wetland habitat for wood ducks.

The population of the wood duck has increased a great deal in the last several years. The increase has been due to the work of many people constructing wood duck boxes and conserving vital habitat for the wood ducks to breed. During the open waterfowl season, U.S. hunters have been allowed to take only two wood ducks per day in the Atlantic and Mississippi Flyways. However, for the 2008–2009 season, the limit was raised to three. The wood duck limit remains at two in the Central Flyway and at seven in the Pacific Flyway. It is the second most commonly hunted duck in North America, after the mallard.

==In popular culture==
In 2013, the Royal Canadian Mint created two coins to commemorate the wood duck. The two coins are each part of a three coin set to help promote Ducks Unlimited Canada as well as celebrate its 75th anniversary.

<text>Don Juan (), also known as Don Giovanni (Italian), is a legendary, fictional Spanish libertine who devotes his life to seducing women. 

The original version of the story of Don Juan appears in the 1630 play (&quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot;) by Tirso de Molina. The play includes most of the elements found and later adapted in subsequent works, including the setting (Seville), the characters (Don Juan, his servant, his love interest, and her father, whom he kills), moralistic themes (honor, violence and seduction, vice and retribution), and the dramatic ending in which Don Juan dines with and is then dragged down to hell by the stone statue of the father he had previously slain. Tirso de Molina&#x27;s play was subsequently adapted into numerous plays and poems, of which the most famous include a 1665 play, &quot;Dom Juan&quot;, by Molière; a 1787 opera, &quot;Don Giovanni&quot;, with music by Mozart and a libretto by Lorenzo da Ponte largely adapting Tirso de Molina&#x27;s play; a satirical and epic poem, &quot;Don Juan&quot;, by Lord Byron; and &quot;Don Juan Tenorio&quot;, a romantic play by José Zorrilla.

By linguistic extension, from the name of the character, &quot;Don Juan&quot; has become a generic expression for a , and stemming from this, Don Juanism is a non-clinical psychiatric descriptor.

==Pronunciation==

In Spanish, it is pronounced . The usual English pronunciation is , with two syllables and a silent &quot;J&quot;, but today, as more English-speakers are becoming influenced by Spanish, the pronunciation is becoming more common. However, in Lord Byron&#x27;s verse version the name rhymes with &quot;ruin&quot; and &quot;true one&quot;, and traditionally the name was pronounced with three syllables, possibly or , in England at the time and by later critics. This would have been characteristic of English literary precedent, where English pronunciations were often imposed on Spanish names, such as Don Quixote .

==Synopsis==
There have been many versions of the Don Juan story, but the basic outline remains the same: Don Juan is a wealthy Andalusian libertine who devotes his life to seducing women. He takes great pride in his ability to seduce women of all ages and stations in life, and he often disguises himself and assumes other identities in order to seduce women. The aphorism that Don Juan lives by is: (translated as &quot;What a long term you are giving me!&quot;). This is his way of indicating that he is young and that death is still distant—he thinks he has plenty of time to repent later for his sins.

His life is also punctuated with violence and gambling, and in most versions he kills a man: Don Gonzalo (the ), the father of , a girl he has seduced. This murder leads to the famous &quot;last supper&quot; scene, where Don Juan invites a statue of Don Gonzalo to dinner. There are different versions of the outcome: in some versions Don Juan dies, having been denied salvation by God; in other versions he willingly goes to Hell, having refused to repent; in some versions Don Juan asks for and receives a divine pardon.

==Earliest written version==
The first written version of the Don Juan story was a play, (&quot;The Trickster of Seville and the Stone Guest&quot;), published in Spain around 1630 by Tirso de Molina (pen name of Gabriel Téllez).
In Tirso de Molina&#x27;s version Don Juan is portrayed as an evil man who seduces women thanks to his ability to manipulate language and disguise his appearance. This is a demonic attribute, since the devil is known for shape-shifting or taking other peoples&#x27; forms. In fact Tirso&#x27;s play has a clear moralizing intention. Tirso felt that young people were throwing their lives away, because they believed that as long as they made an Act of Contrition before they died, they would automatically receive God&#x27;s forgiveness for all the wrongs they had done, and enter into heaven. Tirso&#x27;s play argues in contrast that there is a penalty for sin, and there are even unforgivable sins. The devil himself, who is identified with Don Juan as a shape-shifter and a &quot;man without a name&quot;, cannot escape eternal punishment for his unforgivable sins. As in a medieval Danse Macabre, death makes us all equal in that we all must face eternal judgment. Tirso de Molina&#x27;s theological perspective is quite apparent through the dreadful ending of his play.

Another aspect of Tirso&#x27;s play is the cultural importance of honor in Spain of the golden age. This was particularly focused on women&#x27;s sexual behavior, in that if a woman did not remain chaste until marriage, her whole family&#x27;s honor would be devalued.

==Later versions==
The original play was written in the Spanish Golden Age according to its beliefs and ideals. But as time passed, the story was translated into other languages, and it was adapted to accommodate cultural changes.

Other well-known versions of Don Juan are Molière&#x27;s play (1665), Antonio de Zamora&#x27;s play (1722), Goldoni&#x27;s play (1735), José de Espronceda&#x27;s poem (1840), and José Zorrilla&#x27;s romantic play (1844). is still performed throughout the Spanish-speaking world on 2 November (&quot;All Souls Day&quot;, the Day of the Dead).

Mozart&#x27;s opera has been called &quot;the opera of all operas&quot;. First performed in Prague in 1787, it inspired works by E. T. A. Hoffmann, Alexander Pushkin, Søren Kierkegaard, George Bernard Shaw, and Albert Camus. The critic Charles Rosen analyzes the appeal of Mozart&#x27;s opera in terms of &quot;the seductive physical power&quot; of a music linked with libertinism, political fervor, and incipient Romanticism. After seeing a performance of Mozart&#x27;s opera, Pushkin wrote a story in the form of a play, not intended for the stage, &quot;The Stone Guest&quot; () in a series &quot;The Little Tragedies&quot; (1830). Alexander Dargomyzhsky composed an opera using the exact text of Pushkin for the libretto (unfinished at the composer&#x27;s death 1869, completed by César Cui, 1872).

The first English version of Don Juan was &quot;The Libertine&quot; (1676) by Thomas Shadwell. A revival of this play in 1692 included songs and dramatic scenes with music by Henry Purcell. Another well-known English version is Lord Byron&#x27;s epic poem &quot;Don Juan&quot; (1821).

, a play derived from an unfinished 1844 retelling of the tale by poet Nikolaus Lenau, inspired Richard Strauss&#x27;s orchestral tone poem . This piece premiered on 11 November 1889, in Weimar, Germany, where Strauss served as Court Kapellmeister and conducted the orchestra of the Weimar Opera. In Lenau&#x27;s version of the story, Don Juan&#x27;s promiscuity springs from his determination to find the ideal woman. Despairing of ever finding her, he ultimately surrenders to melancholy and wills his own death.

In the film &quot;Adventures of Don Juan&quot; starring Errol Flynn (1948), Don Juan is a swashbuckling lover of women who also fights against the forces of evil.

In 1951 the Brazilian writer Guilherme Figueiredo wrote a play entitled &quot;Don Juan&quot;. 

In 1952, the Spanish writer Jacinto Benavente published his play &quot;Ha llegado Don Juan&quot;. 

&quot;Don Juan in Tallinn&quot; (1971) is an Estonian film version based on a play by Samuil Aljošin. In this version, Don Juan is a woman dressed in men&#x27;s clothes. She is accompanied by her servant Florestino on her adventure in Tallinn, the capital of Estonia.

In &quot;Don Juan, or If Don Juan Were a Woman&quot; (1973), a French-Italian co-production, Brigitte Bardot plays a female version of the character.

&quot;Don Juan DeMarco&quot; (1995), starring Johnny Depp and Marlon Brando, is a film in which a mental patient is convinced he is Don Juan, and retells his life story to a psychiatrist.

&quot;Don Jon&quot; (2013), a film set in New Jersey of the 21st century, features an attractive young man whose addiction to online pornography is compared to his girlfriend&#x27;s consumerism.

==Cultural influence==

Don Juan fascinated the 19th-century English novelist Jane Austen: &quot;I have seen nobody on the stage who has been a more interesting Character than that compound of Cruelty and Lust&quot;.

The Danish philosopher Søren Kierkegaard discussed Mozart&#x27;s version of the Don Juan story at length in his 1843 treatise &quot;Either/Or&quot;.

In 1901, Finnish composer Jean Sibelius wrote the second movement of his second symphony based on the climax of Don Juan. The piece begins with a representation of Death walking up the road to Don Juan&#x27;s house, where Don Juan pleads with Death to let him live. Also, the 1905 novel &quot;The Song of the Blood-Red Flower&quot; by the Finnish author Johannes Linnankoski has been influenced by Don Juan along the protagonist of the story.

The protagonist of Shaw&#x27;s 1903 &quot;Man and Superman&quot; is a modern-day Don Juan named not Juan Tenorio but John Tanner. The actor playing Tanner morphs into his model in the mammoth third act, usually called &quot;Don Juan in Hell&quot; and often produced as a separate play due to its length. In it, Don Juan (played by Charles Boyer in a noted 1950s recording) exchanges philosophical barbs with the devil (Charles Laughton).

In 1911, Ukrainian writer Lesya Ukrainka wrote poetic drama &quot;The Stone Host&quot; about Don Juan. As the author herself determined, it&#x27;s about the victory of the conservative principle over the split soul of Donna Anna, and through her – over Don Juan. The traditional seducer of women became a victim of the woman who had broken his will.

In Spain, the first three decades of the twentieth century saw more cultural fervor surrounding the Don Juan figure than perhaps any other period. In one of the most provocative pieces to be published, the endocrinologist Gregorio Marañón argued that, far from the paragon of masculinity he was often assumed to be, Don Juan actually suffered from an arrested psychosexual development.

During the 1918 influenza epidemic in Spain, the figure of Don Juan served as a metaphor for the flu microbe.

The mid-20th-century French author Albert Camus referred to Don Juan in his 1942 essay &quot;The Myth of Sisyphus&quot;. Camus describes Don Juan as an example of an &quot;absurd hero&quot;, as he maintains a reckless abandon in his approach to love. His seductive lifestyle &quot;brings with it all the faces in the world, and its tremor comes from the fact that it knows itself to be mortal&quot;. He &quot;multiplies what he cannot unify ... It is his way of giving and vivifying&quot;.

In the 1956 Buddy Holly single &quot;Modern Don Juan&quot;, the singer gains a reputation for being like the libertine in his pursuit of a romantic relationship.

Swedish film director Ingmar Bergman wrote and directed a comic sequel in 1960 titled &quot;The Devil&#x27;s Eye&quot; in which Don Juan, accompanied by his servant, is sent from Hell to contemporary Sweden to seduce a young woman before her marriage.

Anthony Powell in his 1960 novel &quot;Casanova&#x27;s Chinese Restaurant&quot; contrasts Don Juan, who &quot;merely liked power&quot; and &quot;obviously did not know what sensuality was&quot;, with Casanova, who &quot;undoubtedly had his sensuous moments&quot;. Stefan Zweig observes the same difference between both characters in his biography of &quot;Casanova&quot;.

in 1970 Faroese author William heinesen released his short story , in which a character embodying Don Juan is washed up on the Faroe Islands in Torshavn and begins to seduce the women of that town.

In the 1910 French novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; by Gaston Leroux, the titular character (also known as Erik) had spent much of his life writing an opera, &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;, refusing to play it for Christine Daaé and telling her that it was unlike any music she ever heard and that when it was complete, he would die with it, never sharing it with mankind. Following the unmasking scene, Erik refers to himself as Don Juan as he confronts Christine, verbally and physically abusing her as he uses her hands to gouge his face, exclaiming &quot;When a woman has seen me – as you have – she becomes mine ... I&#x27;m a real Don Juan ... Look at me! I&#x27;m Don Juan Triumphant!&quot;

Don Juan is also a plot point in Susan Kay&#x27;s novel &quot;Phantom&quot;, which expands on Gaston Leroux&#x27;s novel &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;. The titular character was referred to as &quot;Don Juan&quot; in his childhood, a nickname given to him by Javert, a man who exploited Erik as a child. Later in life, he began writing &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;, spending decades on the piece, which Christine Daaé heard after hiding in her room after removing Erik&#x27;s mask.

In the 1986 Broadway musical adaptation of Gaston Leroux&#x27;s 1910 &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot;, the character of the Phantom writes an opera based on the legend of Don Juan called &quot;Don Juan Triumphant&quot;.

Don Juan is mentioned in the 1980 Broadway musical adaptation of Victor Hugo&#x27;s 1862 novel , in which the character Grantaire states that Marius Pontmercy is acting like Don Juan.

The former Thai Queen Sirikit once told reporters that her son Crown Prince Vajiralongkorn, now King Rama X, was &quot;a bit of a Don Juan&quot;.

<doc id="252117" wikidata="Q205780" url="?curid=252117" title="Tenacious D">
<text>Tenacious D is an American comedy rock duo formed in Los Angeles in 1994 by the actors Jack Black and Kyle Gass. Their music showcases Black&#x27;s theatrical vocal delivery and Gass&#x27; acoustic guitar playing. Critics have described their fusion of vulgar absurdist comedy with rock music as &quot;mock rock&quot;. Their songs discuss the duo&#x27;s purported musical and sexual prowess, their friendship and cannabis usage, in a style critics have compared with the storyteller-style lyrics of rock opera.

Prior to the release of the 2001 debut album &quot;Tenacious D&quot;, the duo had a three-episode TV series released on HBO between 1997 and 2000. The series came about after they met David Cross on the LA music scene and Black featured in episodes of &quot;Mr. Show with Bob and David&quot;. The band befriended the musician Dave Grohl, which began a relationship between Grohl&#x27;s band the Foo Fighters and Tenacious D. Towards the end of the 1990s, the duo supported large rock acts such as Weezer, Pearl Jam, Tool, and Beck.

In 2000, they signed with Epic Records and the year after they released &quot;Tenacious D,&quot; their debut album featuring a full band, including Grohl. Their second single, &quot;Tribute&quot;, achieved cult status, contributing to their popularity in the UK, Sweden and Australia. In 2003, the band released &quot;The Complete Master Works&quot;, a concert DVD, which was certified platinum. In 2006, the duo starred in a film, &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, and released the soundtrack as their second album, &quot;The Pick of Destiny.&quot; The film was a box office failure and received mixed reviews, but the Pick of Destiny tour was successful, with performances at venues including Madison Square Garden.

Following years of sporadic festival dates and special appearances, the band released their third album, &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot;, in 2012, making light of &quot;The Pick of Destiny&#x27;s&quot; commercial failure. In 2013, Tenacious D hosted the comedy music festival Festival Supreme in LA. In 2014, they featured on &quot;Ronnie James Dio – This Is Your Life&quot;, a compilation album to raise funds for cancer. Their cover of &quot;The Last in Line&quot; won the Grammy Award for best heavy metal performance at the 57th Annual Grammy Awards. In 2018, the band began independently releasing an animated hand-drawn web series, &quot;Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto&quot;, and released the album &quot;Post-Apocalypto&quot;. In July 2024, Tenacious D cancelled their world tour and put their work on hold after Gass made a controversial on-stage joke about the attempted assassination of Donald Trump.

==History==
===Formation and early years===
Jack Black and Kyle Gass met in Los Angeles in 1986 as members of the Actors&#x27; Gang theater troupe. They were initially not friendly, as Gass was the main musician for the Actor&#x27;s Gang and &quot;felt threatened&quot; by Black. The Actor&#x27;s Gang travelled to Scotland for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival in 1989 to were perform Tim Robbins&#x27; and Adam Simon&#x27;s play &quot;Carnage&quot;. The two became friends during the trip and climbed Arthur&#x27;s Seat on a day off. Following the trip, Black and Gass bonded over music. Black did not learn guitar until he was around 23. He would regularly visit Gass&#x27;s apartment on Cochran Avenue; Gass would teach Black to play guitar in return for food. They worked together professionally at the Actor&#x27;s Gang and collaborated in productions.

Black and Gass eventually wrote their first song after Black was dumped by a girlfriend, a non-comedic song. They later said they felt embarrassed about the song, though they occasionally sing it during interviews when telling their story. Their second song came about when Black was listening to the Metallica song &quot;One&quot; and told Gass that it was &quot;the best song in the world&quot;. Gass told Black that they could not write the best song in the world, but Black put a twist on it and said they could &quot;write a tribute&quot;. Gass played an A-minor chord on his guitar at the apartment and the two spent three days crafting the song. When it was done, Gass said they &quot;knew they had something&quot;. The song made the duo realize their comedic potential. The duo briefly called themselves Responsive Chord while rehearsing the comedy act.

===Rise to popularity===
The band&#x27;s first on-stage appearance was at Highland Grounds in Los Angeles, a coffee shop, where they performed as &quot;The Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon&#x27;s Mischief,&quot; though the production was technically part of a variety event for the Actor&#x27;s Gang&quot;.&quot; In the audience was the actor and comedian Harry Shearer.

The band&#x27;s first performance at an actual music event was a short appearance at Al&#x27;s Bar in the summer of 1994, opening for The Abe Lincoln Story. They performed &quot;Tribute&quot;, still their only song at the time, and asked the audience to vote for their name. Black and Gass gave them the choice between Pets or Meat, Balboa&#x27;s Biblical Theater and the Axe Lords Featuring Gorgazon&#x27;s Mischief (Gass&#x27; favorite). &quot;Tenacious D&quot;—a basketball term used by commentators to describe robust defensive positioning in basketball — did not get the majority of votes, but according to Black &quot;we forced it through&quot;. The venue had become a hotbed for upcoming bands, so much so that in attendance was David Cross, who invited Black and Gass to open for the live version of &quot;Mr. Show&quot;. Black was cast on &quot;Mr. Show&quot; in 1995.

Tenacious D continued to generate momentum on the Los Angeles music scene, notably performing headline shows at Al&#x27;s Bar, Pedro&#x27;s, Largo and The Actors&#x27; Gang studio. Maynard James Keenan, lead vocalist of the band Tool, had also met Cross on the Los Angeles scene, and therefore had also become involved in &quot;Mr. Show&quot;. Keenan invited Black and Gass to support three Californian Tool concerts in December 1995. Tool was the first large act that Tenacious D were a support act for. Black had previously attended UCLA with director Jason Bloom; therefore, when Bloom was made the director of 1996&#x27;s &quot;Bio-Dome&quot;, Black and Gass were invited to perform a short song in the film. The two wrote the song &quot;5 Needs&quot;, and this was their first on-screen appearance as Tenacious D.

In 1997, Tenacious D had become a popular act on the Los Angeles music scene and would perform residencies at The Viper Room. Pete Stahl, the vocalist of the band Scream, worked at The Viper Room at the time and became a fan of Black and Gass. Stahl invited friend Dave Grohl to come and visit The Viper Room to see Tenacious D, though Grohl initially did not want to go. Grohl changed his stance and went to see the band perform a couple of weeks later and thoroughly enjoyed it. This would start a relationship between Grohl, Black and Gass.

Tenacious D recorded their songs &quot;Tribute&quot;, &quot;Kyle Quit the Band&quot;, &quot;Krishna&quot; and &quot;History&quot; and released them in a demo tape called &quot;Tenacious Demo&quot; in the late 1990s with Andrew Gross. They distributed it to various record companies until HBO offered them a TV show based on the tape and Black&#x27;s work on &quot;Mr. Show&quot;.

===Television series and &quot;Tenacious D&quot; (1997–2002)===

Cross and his &quot;Mr. Show&quot; co-writer Bob Odenkirk continued his involvement with Tenacious D by producing three half-hour shows based on the band. The series, entitled &quot;Tenacious D&quot;, premiered on HBO in 1997, immediately following an episode of &quot;Mr. Show&quot;. While a total of three episodes consisting of two shorts each, ten to twelve minutes in length, were produced, only the first was aired that year; the final two episodes did not air until the summer of 2000. According to Gass, the series was cancelled after HBO requested ten episodes with the stipulation that he and Black would have to relinquish their role as executive producers, and only write songs.

After the series aired, the band continued to perform live. At a show at the Viper Room in Los Angeles, they met Dave Grohl, who remarked that he was impressed with their performance; this led to their cameo in the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; music video. They began to open for high-profile acts including Beck, Pearl Jam and Foo Fighters.

In May 2000, Tenacious D signed to Epic Records. As Black&#x27;s profile increased due to his roles in films such as &quot;High Fidelity&quot;, the band recorded their first album, &quot;Tenacious D,&quot; with the producers the Dust Brothers. It was backed by a full band, consisting of Grohl on drums and guitar, keyboardist Page McConnell of Phish, guitarist Warren Fitzgerald of The Vandals, and bassist Steven Shane McDonald of Redd Kross. According to Black, they chose to use a band because &quot;no one&#x27;s ever heard us with a band&quot;. The majority of songs on the album were performed previously on their short-lived television series.

&quot;Tencious&quot; D reached No. 33 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 on October 13, 2001. Although it received mixed reviews, it went on to garner acclaim and by November 2005 had been certified platinum in the US. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; described it &quot;hilarious&quot;, and &quot;no mere comedy record&quot;. AllMusic wrote that it &quot;rocks so damn hard&quot;, but lamented the absence of some of the songs from the television show. &quot;Flak Magazine&quot; criticised the skits between songs, describing them as &quot;distracting&quot; and a &quot;nuisance&quot;.&quot;The Independent&quot; found the album was full of &quot;swearing and scatology&quot; and was &quot;bereft of even the slightest skidmark of humor&quot;.

The first single, &quot;Tribute&quot;, is a tribute to the &quot;greatest song in the world&quot;, which Tenacious D claim they performed to save their souls from a demon. The music video, directed by Liam Lynch, achieved success and was voted the fifth best music video ever by &quot;Kerrang!&quot; readers. This was followed by the second single, &quot;Wonderboy&quot;, with a video directed by Spike Jonze. A third video, an animation depicting Black and Gass as cherubs, was made for &quot;Fuck Her Gently&quot;, directed by the &quot;Ren and Stimpy&quot; creator John Kricfalusi.

The album also included &quot;Dio&quot;, a song written as a tribute to rock singer Ronnie James Dio, which mocked him somewhat for being too old. Dio liked the song enough to ask the band to appear in the music video for his song, &quot;Push&quot;. An EP entitled &quot;D Fun Pak&quot; was released in 2002. It featured a skit and acoustic versions of &quot;Jesus Ranch&quot; and &quot;Kyle Quit The Band&quot;, as well as a megamix by Mocean Worker. &quot;The Complete Masterworks&quot;, a music DVD featuring the entire run of their TV series, music videos, and a live performance from London&#x27;s Brixton Academy recorded in 2002, was released on November 9, 2003.

===&quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot; and the album (2003–2007)===

Black and Gass had dreamt of producing a Tenacious D motion-picture since forming the band; archived footage of banter at an early Tenacious D show records Black as saying &quot;a movie - that would be the pinnacle&quot;.

The duo conceptualized numerous ideas for a film, though the first actual known draft of a script was published on November 7, 2000. The script was based on many songs that would later be released on the duo&#x27;s eponymous debut album that would be released the following year. There is little known about the script, other than it being based around the band playing coffee shops and Black becoming fascinated by Atlantis. Black and Gass both fall in love with a girl called Simmeon who has written books about the fictional island. They later meet Ronnie James Dio, and are sent on a road trip to Miami. This concept was later scrapped.

At some point prior to 2003, the band were in negotiations with the British studio Working Title Films to write and distribute a Tenacious D film, but Black and Gass were not satisfied with the writers&#x27; ideas. In February 2003, it was announced that the band had signed with New Line Cinema to create a film, with Liam Lynch as the director, and Black, Gass and Lynch writing the script and being producers on the production. There was also speculation that Red Hour Productions would produce the film, which was later confirmed. Later in 2003, Black announced the title as &quot;Tenacious D in: The Pick of Destiny&quot; and that the script was about the band&#x27;s search for a sacred guitar pick. Filming had been expected to take place by the end of 2003; however, it was delayed by almost a year due to Black being cast in Peter Jackson&#x27;s big budget remake of &quot;King Kong&quot;. In December 2004, Black and Gass performed some songs from the upcoming soundtrack of the film whilst touring Australia, and announced that the film would include cameos from Meat Loaf and Ronnie James Dio.

Principal photography for &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot; commenced in the spring of 2005, with the production finishing later that summer. The film held its first test screening to the press in October 2005. The film held two re-shoots in the summer of 2006 and according to Lynch, every crew member from the principal photography came back because they &quot;had such a fun time working on set&quot;. Black also stated that the filming on this production was &quot;the most fun I&#x27;ve ever had filming a movie&quot;.

The film held its British premiere on November 1, 2006, at the Vue West End cinema in London, England. The film&#x27;s domestic premiere was held at Grauman&#x27;s Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles on November 9, 2006. Many of the actors who had cameos in the film were in attendance; including Ronnie James Dio, Dave Grohl, and Ben Stiller. The soundtrack for the production was called &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot; and featured a returning John King (of The Dust Brothers) producing it. It was released on November 14, 2006, through Epic Records.

The film was released worldwide on November 22. &quot;Tenacious D in the Pick of Destiny&quot; grossed US$8,334,575 in the US and Canada and a total of US$13,426,450 worldwide, falling well short of its US$20 million production budget and US$40 million in estimated marketing costs. Financially, it is regarded as a box-office bomb. The soundtrack reached No. 8 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 in the US as well as topping the iTunes chart, and #10 in the UK. The film was released globally on DVD on February 27, 2007. In an interview on &quot;the Daily Show&quot; on November 30, 2006, Black admitted the film had &quot;bombed&quot;, but said that DVD sales had shown that the film picked up a cult audience.
Kevin Crust of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; said that the film &quot;might best be enjoyed in an enhanced state of consciousness, a herbal supplement, and we aren&#x27;t talking ginkgo biloba.&quot; Stephen Rae of &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; said that the frequent drug-use in the film gives &quot;the term potty humor a new meaning.&quot; Michael Phillips criticized the frequency of the drug-use by saying: &quot;This may be the problem. Pot rarely helped anybody&#x27;s comic timing.&quot; Stephen Holden of &quot;The New York Times&quot; suggested that the film could be viewed as a &quot;jolly rock &#x27;n&#x27; roll comedy&quot;, but he also described the progression of the film as being a &quot;garish mess.&quot;

The soundtrack received less favourable reviews than for the band&#x27;s first album. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; comments that the soundtrack &quot;never quite takes off&quot;. It criticises the reliance the album makes on a knowledge of the film, and some songs&#x27; existence only to &quot;advance the plot&quot;. It summarizes by saying the album is inferior to the band&#x27;s previous effort. Allmusic also describes the follow-up as less &quot;satisfying&quot; than &quot;Tenacious D&quot;, noting that the songs feel like &quot;narrative filler&quot;. &quot;Blender&quot; continues the criticism of the songs being plot devices calling them &quot;plot-nudging song-sketches&quot;. &quot;The Guardian&quot; views the album more positively, describing the album as a meeting of &quot;old school riffology&quot; and &quot;schoolboy humour&quot;.

To coincide with the release of their new film and album, Tenacious D embarked on The Pick of Destiny Tour, of the US, Canada, UK, Australia, and New Zealand. This tour included the band&#x27;s first appearance at New York City&#x27;s Madison Square Garden. Unlike other tours, this one featured a full backing band. Konesky and Spiker resumed their roles from the album, and Brooks Wackerman was added as drummer. Each member used a pseudonym; Konesky as the Antichrist, Spiker as Charlie Chaplin, and Wackerman as Colonel Sanders. JR Reed also toured as Satan, as well as reprising his role as &quot;Lee&quot;. Black has said that the band lost money on the tour due to the cost of touring with a full band for the first time.

===&quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot; (2008–2012)===

In November 2006, Black expressed wishes to take a year-long break from acting, though Gass hinted a desire for Tenacious D to end at their current highpoint. However, Black confirmed that a third album would be recorded by announcing that a new song has been written for it entitled &quot;Deth Star&quot;. He said that the album would likely be released in 2010, but on other occasions had mentioned the year 2012. In early 2008, Black announced that the band was working on a new album, and a DVD titled &quot;The Complete Masterworks Part 2&quot;. The DVD was released later that year, and included a documentary of their world tour entitled &quot;D Tour: A Tenacious Documentary&quot;. The film focuses on the tour Tenacious D made in support of the film and soundtrack and the consequences of their film&#x27;s poor showing at the box office. Kyle has commented that the new album only has &quot;one to one and a half&quot; songs written for it, and would like to write between twelve and fifteen.

Music magazine &quot;Billboard&quot; quoted Black as revealing that &quot;We just laid down a hot [...] we&#x27;re calling it the bomb track. It&#x27;s a very powerful recording called &quot;Deth Starr&quot; [...] so it has nothing to do with the &quot;Star Wars&quot; [Death Star],&quot; adding that &quot;It&#x27;s kind of sci-fi, doomsday rock.&quot; Jack Black also stated on the Late Show with David Letterman that he had an idea for a song called &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot;, which he described as a &quot;rise from the ashes&quot; workout song similar to &quot;Eye of the Tiger&quot;. He performed a vocal sample of the song along with keyboards.

Gass hinted that the band&#x27;s third album might be called &quot;Tenacious D 3-D&quot;, reasoning that &quot;It&#x27;s the third record, so it should probably be &#x27;Tenacious 3-D.&#x27; There&#x27;s going to be a &#x27;3&#x27; and a &#x27;D,&#x27; so you have to connect them.&quot; Dave Grohl has confirmed that he will appear as the drummer on the album, after performing on both &quot;Tenacious D&quot; and &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot;. In an interview with Spinner.com in December 2010, Black revealed that the band was &quot;about halfway through the writing process&quot; for its new album, telling fans to expect the release of new material &quot;at the end of 2011&quot;. In terms of lyrical themes for the new songs, Black noted that &quot;We&#x27;re gonna be talking about love, there are gonna be some songs about sex and there&#x27;s gonna be songs about food&quot;.

In a May 2011 interview at &quot;Attack of the Show&quot;, Black announced that three songs on their upcoming album would be named &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot;, distinguishable by either letter or number. Also in the same interview, he named another song called &quot;Señorita&quot;. In February 2012 it was revealed that the title of the album would in fact be spelled &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot; and would be released on May 15, 2012.

On March 26, 2012, a 6-minute film was uploaded to the Tenacious D channel on YouTube. The mockumentary, titled &#x27;Tenacious D - To Be the Best&#x27;, documents the uncertain future Tenacious D faced after the box-office failure of &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot;, KG&#x27;s subsequent breakdown and incarceration in &quot;an institution&quot;, and Jack&#x27;s embracing of an indulgent Hollywood lifestyle. The film shows a deranged Kyle escaping the facility and attempting to kill Jack and then himself, before they each realize their importance to each other and revive the band. They produce a new album in 75 minutes in the studio, described as &quot;awful&quot;, but try again and emerge with another new album, described at the end of the film as &quot;the greatest album recorded by anyone, ever&quot;. The film features numerous cameo appearances, including Maria Menounos, Val Kilmer, Dave Grohl, Yoshiki Hayashi, Josh Groban, Richard Ghagan, Mike White, Tim Robbins and Jimmy Kimmel.

The band released the album on April 28, 2012, in its entirety on their SoundCloud account. &quot;Rize of the Fenix&quot; was officially released on May 15, 2012, with mostly positive reviews from music critics.

===&quot;Post-Apocalypto&quot; (2012–2022)===
In June 2012, when asked about a sequel to &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, Black stated that the band had &quot;found a loophole with the internet and animated shorts. That’s the world we’re looking to dive into, and not just for money, mainly for art.&quot; The band would mention later on in that year that they may make an Internet series &quot;exclusive to YouTube.&quot; The project was a fantasy for Black and Gass for a few years, until the Donald Trump presidential campaign inspired them to write a post-apocalyptic comedy in 2016.

In 2018, before performing at Hell &amp; Heaven Metal Fest in Mexico City, the band entered the stage to a short studio snippet of their new song &quot;Post-Apocalypto Theme&quot;. The night after this, Black asked the audience at Shaky Knees Music Festival in Atlanta, Georgia whether they had seen &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot; and that &quot;part 2 is coming out in October&quot;. He went to state that &quot;I don&#x27;t know where you will be able to see it, but we have decided it&#x27;s happening and it&#x27;s coming out. Rocktober&quot;. &quot;Tenacious D in Post-Apocalypto&quot; was released as six individual episodes on YouTube uploaded from September 28 to November 2, with Columbia Records releasing &quot;Post-Apocalypto&quot; on the last day.

At a live screening of the series at Alamo Drafthouse Cinema in New York, Black stated that the two would attempt to speed up their album cycle, jokingly commenting about the duo&#x27;s age if the current speed continues and their record obligation with Sony. Black stated that the fifth album will take time, and &quot;most likely be released [sometime] after 2020&quot;.

On November 29, 2019, for Record Store Day&#x27;s Black Friday, Tenacious D released a &#x27;Blue Series&#x27; 7&quot; Single, featuring the track &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow It, Kage&quot;. The record was produced by Jack White. On October 27, 2020, Tenacious D released a cover of &#x27;Time Warp&#x27;, available to stream online and also released on 7&quot; vinyl. The song included a music video featuring a string of celebrity guests. The single was used to promote Rock the Vote, which encourages Americans to vote in the 2020 Presidential Election. All proceeds from the vinyl sales of the song were donated to Rock the Vote.

On July 1, 2021, Tenacious D released a tribute to the Beatles in which they cover and mashup two songs from &quot;Abbey Road&quot;: &quot;You Never Give Me Your Money&quot; and &quot;The End.&quot; Similar to &quot;Time Warp&quot;, the limited-edition 7&quot; supported charitythis time with all the proceeds going to Doctors Without Borders. In an interview with &quot;Variety&quot; published in September 2021, Black stated that the band was working on their next album, claiming it is &quot;a very big idea that we&#x27;ve been working on for years&quot;. Black predicted the album will be released in 2024. On December 7, 2021, Tenacious D announced a Summer 2022 tour of the United States. This tour was a belated 20th anniversary celebration of their debut album. In March 2022, the tour was extended into the fall.

=== Spicy Meatball Tour, Trump comment and hiatus (2023–present) ===
On May 6, 2023, the duo began the Spicy Meatball Tour by debuting a new song, &quot;Video Games&quot;, at Shaky Knees Music Festival. &quot;Video Games&quot; premiered online on May 11, via a 3D animated music video directed by Adam Paloian and his production company Pinreel Inc., which was the band&#x27;s first new music video since 2012. In early June, it was announced that the tour would continue in the fall, starting with a show in Charlotte, North Carolina. In February 2024, the band announced their first tour of Australia and New Zealand in eleven years, to be held in July 2024. Later in June, the band announced a tour called &#x27;Rock D Vote&#x27; performing in five swing states ahead of the 2024 United States elections.

On July 14, 2024, Tenacious D celebrated Gass&#x27; 64th birthday during their performance at the ICC Sydney Theater. A birthday cake was brought out and Black encouraged Gass to make a wish. Gass responded, &quot;Don&#x27;t miss Trump next time,&quot; referring to the attempted assassination of Donald Trump the day before. Two days later, Black wrote on social media that he was &quot;blindsided&quot; by Gass&#x27; comment and that he did not condone hate speech or political violence &quot;in any form&quot;. Tenacious D canceled the rest of their world tour, and Black said their &quot;creative plans are on hold&quot;. Gass apologized on social media, calling his comment &quot;highly inappropriate, dangerous and a terrible mistake&quot;, and that he did not condone violence &quot;of any kind, in any form, against anyone&quot;, and described the shooting as a &quot;tragedy&quot;. He was subsequently dropped by his longtime talent agent, Michael Greene. Gass deleted his apology later that week. At the premiere for the film &quot;Borderlands&quot; on August 6, Black said he and Gass remained friends and would return &quot;when it feels right&quot;. In February 2025, Tenacious D contributed a cover of REO Speedwagon’s &quot;Keep On Loving You&quot; for the compilation album &quot;Good Music To Lift Los Angeles&quot;.

==Musical style, influences and legacy==
Tenacious D is a comedy rock band, with the majority of their songs played on acoustic guitars, and a heavy reliance on power chords. Satire and comedy are a major aspect of Tenacious D&#x27;s lyrical content. Gass said of their approach: &quot;I&#x27;d love to do the straight music thing, but that&#x27;s kind of against our mission, which is to rebel against the serious singer-songwriter mentality.&quot; Their songs evoke heavy metal clichés of bands like Iron Maiden and Judas Priest. In particular, the song &quot;Dio&quot; pokes fun at the idea of a torch being passed. Songs like &quot;Friendship&quot; parody the lack of real friendship, as well as point out the [bromance] traits in rock groups with the lyric &quot;As long as there&#x27;s a record deal, we&#x27;ll always be friends&quot;. Their short song structures have been described as punk rock-inspired. Tenacious D also employs the technique of deliberate backmasking on &quot;Karate&quot;, a technique employed by other metal bands like Slayer, who recorded a message in &quot;Hell Awaits&quot;.

Black has said that the first song he enjoyed was ABBA&#x27;s &quot;Take a Chance on Me&quot;. His style was distinctly shaped by &quot;big dinosaurs of rock&quot; such as The Who and Led Zeppelin. In addition, Gass lists his influences as being Tom Waits and Tony Robbins. The band claimed that the inspiration for the song &quot;Tribute&quot; came after Black played Metallica&#x27;s &quot;One&quot; for Gass, describing it as &quot;the best song in the world&quot;, leading to an attempt to write an even better song, themselves.
Gass has described Tenacious D&#x27;s comic assertion that they are the best band as being &quot;ridiculous because it&#x27;s a matter of opinion&quot;. Black characterizes Tenacious D&#x27;s comic nature as an antidote to &quot;the masculinity of rock&quot;, adding &quot;There&#x27;s also something funny about the macho-ness of rock. Like the bands that are the fucking hardest rocking are like, &#x27;We&#x27;ll fucking kick your ass, dude... with our rock.&#x27;&quot; Russell Brand, All Shall Perish, The Lonely Island, and Kanye West have in turn been influenced by the work of Tenacious D.

==Appearances==

===Film and television===
Black and Gass first performed together in &quot;Bio-Dome&quot; (1996), followed by &quot;The Cable Guy&quot; (1996), &quot;Bongwater&quot; (1997), &quot;Cradle Will Rock&quot; (1999), &quot;Saving Silverman&quot; (2001), &quot;Shallow Hal&quot; (2001), and &quot;Year One&quot; (2009). Black has starred in a number of films himself, and he has provided voices for animated films. In 2006, Tenacious D starred in their own film, &quot;Tenacious D in The Pick of Destiny&quot;, in which they set out to become the greatest rock band in the world, by means of a guitar pick imbued with mystic powers and crafted from the tooth of Beelzebub.

The duo contributed to the Annie Award-winning martial arts cartoon film &quot;Kung Fu Panda&quot; with Black as Po and Gass as KG Shaw. Their cover of Britney Spears&#x27; &quot;...Baby One More Time&quot; is featured in the end credits of the fourth film of the series.

Black and Gass have made several television appearances performing songs from their first album. On June 16, 2001, Tenacious D were featured as puppets performing &quot;Friendship&quot; on an episode of &quot;Crank Yankers&quot;. They were guest starred when they were taught by Zorak how to perform in an episode of the Cartoon Network/Adult Swim series &quot;Space Ghost Coast to Coast&quot;. In 2002 they guest starred on &quot;MADtv&quot; playing the songs &quot;Tribute&quot;, &amp; &quot;Lee&quot; with the Foo Fighters frontman Dave Grohl on drums. Later, Tenacious D made an appearance in the first episode of &quot;Tom Goes to the Mayor&quot; televised on Adult Swim.

In the run up to the release of the film &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot;, Tenacious D performed the &quot;Pick of Destiny&quot; at the 2006 American Music Awards and on &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;. Tenacious D was a musical guest on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; for the first time, although they had previously appeared as an uncredited musical guest on May 2, 1998. They also opened the 2006 Spike TV Video Game Awards with a performance of &quot;The Metal&quot;, and played &quot;Friendship&quot; at the 2006 MTV Video Music Awards. The band&#x27;s first television appearance of 2008 was in support of the Who at the VH1 Rock Honors.

===Internet===
Black and Gass were interviewed on August 29, 2012, by Tony Hawk as part of the &quot;Dissent&quot; series on the web channel, Ride. The interview was conducted in the Sirius/XM studios as part of the Hawk&#x27;s &quot;Demolition Radio&quot; program. The interview&#x27;s topics include comedy rock and Upland Skatepark.

=== Video games ===
The song &quot;The Metal&quot; is playable in the sixth tier setlist of &quot;Guitar Hero III: Legends of Rock&quot;, as well as being playable in demo versions of the game included in demo kits, &quot;Official Xbox Magazine&quot; Demo Disc #77, some copies of &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Proving Ground&quot;, and formerly as a digital download on the Xbox Games Store.

&quot;The Metal&quot; and &quot;Master Exploder&quot; appear on the soundtrack of &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;. Both Black and Gass voice characters in the game partly modeled after their likenesses; Black voices main character Eddie Riggs, while Gass voices Kage the Kannonier. An in-game Tenacious D guitar was available as a pre-order incentive. &quot;The Metal&quot; was added as downloadable content to &quot;Rock Band&quot; to coincide with &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;″s release.

===Live===

The band spent the first twelve years of their career playing acoustic concerts; just Black and Gass on acoustic guitars, with no backing instruments apart from occasional guests. Black and Gass have expressed angst they experience before concerts saying: &quot;We&#x27;re always looking for a loophole. Pretty much every concert we&#x27;ve ever done, we&#x27;re trying to find a way to cancel the show at the last minute.&quot; The band mainly spent their first five years performing in Los Angeles, with occasional concerts in New York and Colorado. The band embarked on their first ever tour in the summer of 1999. In 2001, Tenacious D started their second nationwide concert tour, performing at larger venues, many of which sold out. In the fall of 2001, Black and Gass toured with Weezer alongside Jimmy Eat World, performing in large arenas. In 2002, the band supported Kid Rock at a handful of concerts, before starting their third domestic tour, &quot;Le Tour!&quot;, playing many medium-sized theaters. Later that year and in early 2003, the band would perform three small European tours, and an Australian tour.

In 2006, the band launched their first ever major tour, The Pick of Destiny Tour. Black and Gass wished to recruit electric guitarist John Konesky and bassist John Spiker, both members of Gass&#x27; side-project Trainwreck, and had been session musicians on &quot;The Pick of Destiny&quot; album. The band also wished to recruit drummer Brooks Wackerman from The Vandals. At early rehearsals of the tour, Black and Gass contemplated whether to go ahead with the musicians, or whether to continue performing acoustic, of which they decided to try the tour with the band. The tour would continue into 2007, with two US legs, a European leg and an Australian leg.

Following The Pick of Destiny Tour, the band would go on to play Reading and Leeds Festivals, Outside Lands, Bonnaroo and the BlizzCon closing ceremony from 2008 to 2010, as well as supporting the Foo Fighters in the fall of 2011. In 2012, the band launched their second major tour, &quot;Rize of the Fenix Tour&quot;. Apart from two performances in Stockholm and Amsterdam, until 2012, the band had never performed to non-English speaking countries. Black claimed it was because foreign concerts were &quot;a little funky&quot; because &quot;the subtleties do get lost in translation&quot;. In June, the band would perform at Rock am Ring and Rock im Park festivals in Germany, which broke the band&#x27;s attendance records. In October, the band embarked on a large tour of Europe, including returns to Germany.

Following the Rize of the Fenix Tour, the band toured smaller venues as &quot;Old School Acoustic Style Tour&quot; in early 2013, performing in North America and Australia. This would be their first acoustic tour since their tour of Australia in 2004. There were two additional acoustic tours in Europe in December 2013 and February 2015. In 2018, the band launched their third major tour, Post-Apocalypto Tour, which would surpass Rize of the Fenix as their biggest tour in the fall of October 2019. In 2023, the band began their fourth major tour, the Spicy Meatball Tour.

==Political activities==
Tenacious D are supporters of cannabis legalization. They have also performed at a NORML benefit concert. Black described his view that allowing drug use would remove the stigma of feeling &quot;naughty&quot; attached to users, making the activity mundane and less attractive. Black was the executive producer for a documentary about Randy Credico entitled &quot;Sixty Spins Around the Sun&quot;. It calls for the so-called Rockefeller Drug Laws to be repealed. Black said of it, &quot;They&#x27;re populating our prisons with people, you know, first time drug offenders—single mothers that have a little bit of coke end up going to prison for 20 years or something. It&#x27;s just cruel and unusual punishment.&quot;

In 2004, Tenacious D supported John Kerry&#x27;s US presidential election campaign by playing a benefit concert for him. Black and Gass were disparaging towards George W. Bush&#x27;s presidency on many occasions. The band performed a benefit concert for Barack Obama&#x27;s presidential campaign on November 2, 2008, in Milwaukee. Other performers included Ben Harper and Relentless7, David Crosby and Graham Nash, and the Beastie Boys. Tenacious D guested with Crosby and Nash on &quot;Find the Cost of Freedom&quot; which concluded the Crosby-Nash set. In 2010, Tenacious D agreed to boycott Arizona due to laws passed there concerning illegal immigration. In 2012, Tenacious D performed at the House of Blues in Cleveland and did a surprise gig at Kent State University earlier on that day to encourage voting. Tenacious D supported Obama that year. In 2017, Black and Gass performed &quot;The Government Totally Sucks&quot; at an anti-Donald Trump Prophets of Rage show in Los Angeles.

==Other projects==
In 2014, Tenacious D provided a cover of &quot;The Last in Line&quot; on the Dio tribute album &quot;This Is Your Life&quot;. The recording won a Grammy Award for Best Metal Performance.

Tenacious D have appeared in numerous music videos by other bands, including &quot;Learn to Fly&quot; by the Foo Fighters, &quot;Push&quot; by Dio, and &quot;Photograph&quot; by Weezer. Black has appeared on his own in many music videos, including a cameo alongside Dave Grohl in the music video for the Eagles of Death Metal song &quot;I Want You So Hard (Boy&#x27;s Bad News)&quot;, alongside Grohl again in the music video for the Foo Fighters&#x27; &quot;Low&quot;, a cameo in the music video for the song &quot;Sexx Laws&quot; by Beck, and the video for &quot;Humility&quot; by Gorillaz.

In addition to appearing in videos, Black and Gass sang backup vocals on the 2003 Styx album &quot;Cyclorama&quot;, on the song &quot;Kiss Your Ass Goodbye&quot;. Tenacious D lent backing vocals to The Vandals album &quot;Look What I Almost Stepped In...&quot;, on the song &quot;Fourteen&quot;. Tenacious D appeared on KROQ-FM&#x27;s twelfth full-length Christmas compilation, &quot;Swallow My Eggnog&quot;, with Sum 41, on a song entitled &quot;Things I Want&quot;. Gass appeared in the Good Charlotte music video for the song &quot;Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous&quot;.

=== Trainwreck ===
Following Black&#x27;s popularity in the film industry, he was unable to tour regularly with Gass, so Gass started Trainwreck, under the pseudonym &quot;Klip Calhoun&quot;. The band also features JR Reed (Lee of Tenacious D) under the pseudonym &quot;Darryl Donald&quot;, as well as Konesky and Spiker, who play lead guitar and bass. They have released a live album, &quot;Trainwreck Live&quot;, and a studio album &quot;The Wreckoning&quot;. Black occasionally appeared with the band under the name &quot;Tuffy McFuckelby&quot;. Trainwreck broke up in 2010, but reunited in 2018 and announced that they were working on a new album.

=== Kyle Gass Band ===
Following the breakup of Trainwreck, Gass started Kyle Gass Band in 2011. The band released their first album, &quot;Kyle Gass Band&quot; in 2013 and &quot;Thundering Herd&quot; in 2016. The band features Mike Bray as lead singer, who used to open for Trainwreck shows. The band also features Konesky reprising his role as electric guitarist.

=== Guitarings ===
Gass and Konesky produced a YouTube show called Guitarings. The first series launched in mid-2009, and the second series lasted for 2011 and 2012. The series featured guitar tutorials for Tenacious D songs, as well as interviews, equipment reviews, music shop tours and answering fan mail.

<text>Maryhill Football Club are an association football team based in the Maryhill area of Glasgow, Scotland. The team is a member of the Scottish Junior Football Association, now playing in the West of Scotland Football League Second Division in the 2022–23 season.

==History==
Formed in 1884 as a Junior club, Maryhill were beaten finalists in the second-ever Scottish Junior Cup in 1887–88 and turned senior the following season. The club entered the Scottish Cup three years running from 1888 but never got further than the second round, suffering 9–3 and 7–2 defeats to Third Lanark and Linthouse respectively in 1889 and 1890. Maryhill eventually returned to the Junior ranks in 1894 with some success, reaching four national cup finals in eight years. The &quot;Hill&quot; also won a wartime final in 1940.

Post-war they were not one of the bigger Junior clubs, but investment from a wealthy backer, Ronnie MacDonald, in the 1990s brought a period of success. 
The team plays at Lochburn Park, and has done since 1897. Club colours are red and black.

The club received national news attention in April 2017 when Gavin Stokes scored the fastest goal on record in world football history in a home game against Clydebank, with his advance to the top corner from the midline timed at 2.1 seconds

In June 2019 it was announced that ICW (Insane Championship Wrestling) was to sponsor the club.

Mark Young was appointed the club&#x27;s new manager on 26 May 2022, replacing Ross Wilson who departed for Bonnyton Thistle.

<doc id="252125" wikidata="Q907894" url="?curid=252125" title="Old Summer Palace">
<text>The Old Summer Palace, also known as Yuanmingyuan () or Yuanmingyuan Park, originally called the Imperial Gardens (), and sometimes called the Winter Palace, was a complex of palaces and gardens in present-day Haidian District, Beijing, China. It is north-west of the walls of the former Imperial City section of Beijing. Widely perceived as the pinnacle work of Chinese imperial garden and palace design, the Old Summer Palace was known for its extensive collection of gardens, its building architecture and numerous art and historical treasures. Constructed throughout the 18th and early 19th centuries, the Old Summer Palace was the main imperial residence of the Qianlong Emperor of the Qing dynasty and his successors, and where they handled state affairs; the Forbidden City was used for formal ceremonies. The Garden was reputed as the &quot;Garden of Gardens&quot; () in its heyday was &quot;arguably the greatest concentration of historic treasures in the world, dating and representing a full 5,000 years of an ancient civilization&quot;, according to Robert McGee, chaplain to the British forces.

During the Second Opium War, French and British troops captured the palace on 6 October 1860, looting and destroying the imperial collections over the next few days. As news emerged that an Anglo-French delegation had been imprisoned by the Qing government, with 19 delegation members being sentenced to death, the 8th Earl of Elgin, the British High Commissioner to China, retaliated by ordering the complete destruction of the palace on 18 October, which was then carried out by troops under his command. The palace was so large – covering more than – that it took 4,000 men three days to destroy it. Many exquisite artworks – sculptures, porcelain, jade, silk robes, elaborate textiles, gold objects and more – were looted and, according to UNESCO, are now located in 47 museums around the world.

==Overview==
The Imperial Gardens at the Old Summer Palace were made up of three gardens: 
#Garden of Perfect Brightness ()
#Garden of Eternal Spring ()
#Garden of Elegant Spring ()
Together, they covered an area of (2.2mi), almost five times the size of the Forbidden City grounds and eight times the size of the Vatican City. Hundreds of structures, such as halls, pavilions, temples, galleries, gardens, lakes and bridges, stood on the grounds.

In addition, hundreds of examples of Chinese artwork and antiquities were stored in the halls, along with unique copies of literary works and compilations. Several famous landscapes of southern China had been reproduced in the Imperial Gardens.

===Location===

The palace was built on a site abundant in fresh water, near the Jade Spring Hill. The region was renowned for its beautiful landscape. Country homes were built here beginning in the 13th century, during the rule of the Yuan dynasty, then in the 16th-century Li Wei of the Ming Dynasty built the &quot;Qinghua Yuan&quot; estate at the site.

===Western mansions===
The most visible architectural remains of the Old Summer Palace can be found in the Western mansions (Xiyang Lou) section of 18th-century European-style palaces, fountains and formal gardens. These structures, built partly of stone but mainly with a Chinese infrastructure of timber columns, coloured tiles and brick walls, were planned and designed by the Jesuit Giuseppe Castiglione with Michel Benoist responsible for the fountains and waterwork. Qianlong Emperor became interested in the architectural project after seeing an engraving of a European fountain, and employed Castiglione and Benoist to carry out the work to satisfy his taste for exotic buildings and objects.

Western-style palaces, pavilion, aviaries, a maze, fountains, basins, and waterworks as well as perspective paintings organized as an outdoor theatre stage were constructed. A striking clock fountain was placed in front of the largest palace, the Haiyan Tang. The fountain had twelve animals of the Chinese zodiac that spouted water in turn every 2 hours, but all spouting water in concert at noon. These European-style buildings however only occupied an area along the back of the Garden of Eternal Spring that was small compared to the overall area of the gardens. More than 95% of the Imperial Gardens were made up of Chinese-style buildings. There were also a few buildings in Tibetan and Mongol styles, reflecting the diversity of the Qing Empire.

==History==

Initial construction of the Old Summer Palace began in 1707 during the reign of the Kangxi Emperor. It was intended as a gift for the emperor&#x27;s fourth son, Prince Yong (the future Yongzheng Emperor), who would greatly expand the Imperial Gardens in 1725. The Yongzheng Emperor also introduced the waterworks of the gardens, creating lakes, streams and ponds to complement the rolling hills and grounds, and named 28 scenic spots within the garden. The Yongzheng Emperor also constructed a number of &quot;living tableaux&quot; he and his family could observe and interact with. One such scene was called &quot;Crops as Plentiful as Fields&quot; which involved court eunuchs pretending to be rural farmers on an island. Another was called the &quot;Courtyard of Universal Happiness&quot; which was a mock village where the imperial family could interact with shopkeepers, again eunuchs in disguise.

During the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s reign, the second expansion was well underway and the number of scenic spots increased to 50 (the emperor personally directed the construction process). The splendors of the palace and the grounds were depicted in the &quot;Forty Scenes of the Yuanmingyuan&quot;, an album produced in 1744 by the Qianlong Emperor&#x27;s court painters. The construction of the European-style palaces was initiated in 1747.

The last European appearance in the Old Summer Palace in the context of traditional Chinese imperial foreign relations was a diplomatic mission in 1795 representing the interests of the Dutch and Dutch East India Company. The Titsingh delegation included Isaac Titsingh, the Dutch-American Andreas Everardus van Braam Houckgeest, and the Frenchman Chrétien-Louis-Joseph de Guignes. Both published complementary accounts of the mission. Titsingh died before he could publish his version of the events.

==Destruction==



In 1860, during the Second Opium War, a combined Anglo-French expeditionary force, having marched inland from the coast at Tianjin (Tientsin), arrived in Beijing (Peking).

In mid-September, two envoys, Henry Loch and Harry Parkes, went ahead of the main force under a flag of truce to negotiate with Prince Yi and representatives of the Qing Empire at Tongzhou (Tungchow) and to scout out campsites behind enemy lines. The delegation included Thomas William Bowlby, a journalist for &quot;The Times&quot;, along with a small escort of British and Indian soldiers. As the talks concluded on 18 September, the Allied forces attacked Qing troops in the area who they believed were redeploying for an ambush, and the Qing court learned that the British had detained the prefect of Tianjin. It was around this time that the Qing general Sengge Rinchen took the members of the delegation prisoner as they were traversing Qing lines to return to the expeditionary forces. The delegates and their escort were taken to the Ministry of Justice (or Board of Punishments) in Beijing, where they were confined and tortured. Parkes and Loch were returned after two weeks, with 14 other survivors. Nineteen British, French and Indian captives died as a result of the torture.

On the night of 5 October, French units diverted from the main attack force towards the Old Summer Palace. At the time, the palace was occupied by only some eunuchs and palace maids; the Xianfeng Emperor and his entourage had already fled to the Chengde Mountain Resort in Hebei. Although the French commander Charles Cousin-Montauban assured his British counterpart, James Hope Grant, that &quot;nothing had been touched&quot;, extensive looting of the palace had already been carried out by Allied soldiers. There was no significant resistance to the looting, even though many Qing soldiers were in the vicinity.

On October 18, Lord Elgin, the British High Commissioner to China, retaliated against the torture of the delegation members by ordering the destruction of the Old Summer Palace. Destroying the Old Summer Palace was also a warning to the Qing Empire not to use kidnapping as a political tactic against Britain. It took 3,500 British troops to set the entire place ablaze, and the massive fire lasted for three days. Unbeknownst to the troops, some 300 remaining eunuchs and palace maids, who concealed themselves from the soldiers in locked rooms, perished when the palace complex was burnt. Only 13 buildings survived intact, most of them in the remote areas or by the lakeside. (The palace would be sacked once again and completely destroyed in 1900 when the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance invaded Beijing.) Charles George Gordon, who was then a 27-year-old captain in the Royal Engineers and part of the 1860 Anglo-French expeditionary force, wrote about his experience:
British and French soldiers preferred porcelain while neglecting bronze vessels prized locally for cooking and burial in tombs. Many such treasures dated back to the Shang, Zhou and Han dynasties and were up to 3,600 years old. A specific exception was the looting of the Haiyantang Zodiac fountain with its twelve bronze animal heads. Some of the most notable treasures ended up at the Chinese Museum in the Palace of Fontainebleau, which Empress Eugénie specifically set up in 1867 to house these newly acquired collections.

Once the Old Summer Palace had been reduced a sign was raised by the Allied expeditionary force with an inscription in Chinese stating, &quot;This is the reward for perfidy and cruelty&quot;. The burning of the palace was the last act of the war.

According to Professor Wang Daocheng of the Renmin University of China, not all of the palace was destroyed in the original burning. Instead, some historical records indicate that 16 of the garden scenes survived the destruction in 1860. Wang identifies the Republican era and the Cultural Revolution as two significant periods that contributed further to the destruction of the Old Summer Palace. Photographic evidence and eyewitness accounts make it clear that (although the palace complex was initially protected by the Qing emperors) it was during the Boxer Rebellion and in the immediate aftermath of the fall of the dynasty when most of the surviving structures were destroyed. Further, the Imperial household itself sold off the magnificent trees in the garden for revenue during the 1890s and after 1900 the palace was used as a veritable builder&#x27;s yard for anyone who wanted construction materials. Entire buildings were built of materials taken from the Yuanming Yuan and smart Peking houses were adorned with sculptures and architectural elements plundered from the site.

Like the Forbidden City, no commoner had ever been allowed into the Old Summer Palace, as it was used exclusively by the imperial family of the Qing Empire. The burning of the Old Summer Palace is still a very sensitive issue in China today. The destruction of the palace has been perceived as barbaric and criminal by many Chinese, as well as by external observers. In his letter &quot;Expédition de Chine&quot;, Victor Hugo described the looting as, &quot;Two robbers breaking into a museum. One has looted, the other has burnt. ... one of the two conquerors filled its pockets, seing that, the other filled its safes; and they came back to Europe laughing hand-in-hand. ... Before history, one of the bandits will be called France and the other England.&quot; In his letter, Hugo hoped that one day France would feel guilty and return what it had plundered from China. For his apologetic literature, a bust of the French writer was erected in the Old Summer Palace in 2010.

==Aftermath==

Following the sacking of the Old Summer Palace, the Qing imperial court relocated to the Forbidden City.

In 1873, the teenage Tongzhi Emperor attempted to rebuild the Old Summer Palace, on the pretext of turning it into a place of retirement for his two former regents, the empress dowagers Ci&#x27;an and Cixi. However, the imperial court lacked the financial resources to rebuild the palace, and at the urging of the court, the emperor finally agreed to stop the project in 1874. During the 1880s, an adjacent imperial gardens, the Gardens of Clear Ripples (the present-day Summer Palace) was restored for the use of Empress Dowager Cixi as a new summer resort, albeit on a smaller scale.

A few Chinese-style buildings in the outlying Elegant Spring Garden also survived the fire. Some of these buildings were restored by the Tongzhi Emperor before the project was abandoned. In 1900, many of the buildings that had survived or had been restored were burnt by the forces of the Eight-Nation Alliance.

Most of the site was left abandoned and used by local farmers as agricultural land. Only in the 1980s was the site reclaimed by the government and turned into a historical site. The Yuanmingyuan Artists Colony became famous for germinating a new wave of painters such as Fang Lijun and musicians such as Fa Zi on the site before it was shut down by the government and many artists relocated to the Songzhuang area outside of Beijing, where they started the Songzhuang art colony. Debates in the 1990s arose regarding restoration and development issues and a more recent environmental controversy brought a new political life to the park as it became a symbol of China&#x27;s &quot;national wound&quot;.

In the present day, the ruins of the European-style palaces are the most prominent building remnants on the site. This has misled some visitors to believe wrongly that the Old Summer Palace was made up only of European-style buildings.

==Recent developments and plans==
There are currently several plans in China for rebuilding the Imperial Gardens, but such moves have been opposed on the grounds that they will destroy an important relic of modern Chinese history. In addition, any rebuilding would be a colossal undertaking, and no rebuilding of above-the-ground structures has been approved. However, the lakes and waterways in the eastern half of the gardens have been dug up again and refilled with water, while hills around the lakes have been cleared of brushwood, recreating long-forgotten vistas. Several temples located inside the Old Summer Palace grounds have also been refurbished and rebuilt.

In February 2005, work was undertaken to reduce water loss from the lakes and canals in the Old Summer Palace by covering a total of of the beds with a membrane to reduce seepage. The park administration argued the prevention of water loss saves the park money, since water would have to be added to the lakes only once per year instead of three times. However, opponents of the project, such as Professor Zhengchun Zhang of Lanzhou University, feared the measure will destroy the ecology of the park, which depends on the water seepage from the lakes and the connection between the lakes and the underground water system. It is also feared the reduced seepage from the lakes will disturb Beijing&#x27;s underground water system which is already suffering from depletion. There are also concerns about the gardens, which is a designated heritage site in the city of Beijing, changing their natural appearance. This issue, when brought up with the general public several weeks later, immediately caused an uproar from the press and became one of the hottest debates on the Internet in China due to the still painful memory of foreign humiliation epitomised in the destruction of the Old Summer Palace. The Beijing Environmental Protection Bureau (BEPB) recently conducted an assessment of the environmental impact of the measure.

A partial copy of the palace, the &quot;New Yuanming Gardens&quot; (圆明新园; 圓明新園), was built in 1997 in the southern city of Zhuhai in Guangdong province, as an amusement park of , including an lake.

Up to the present, many relics which were taken from the Old Summer Palace remain in foreign museums and private collections. Although the Chinese government has tried to recover them, only a few statuettes from the Garden of Eternal Spring have actually been returned. Seven of the 21 columns displayed at the KODE Art Museums in Bergen, Norway were returned to Peking University in 2014 as part of a deal set up by alumnus Huang Nubo, a real estate developer who donated 10 million Norwegian kroner (US$1.6 million) to the museum, according to the &quot;China Daily&quot;.

It is still debated in China whether to apply for an inclusion of the Old Summer Palace on the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites.

==Transport==
The ruins of the Old Summer Palace remain open to the public and are an important tourist attraction in Haidian District, the Yuanmingyuan Park. They can be accessed from Yuanmingyuan Park station on Line 4 of the Beijing Subway.

<doc id="252130" wikidata="Q185115" url="?curid=252130" title="Edgar Davids">
<text>Edgar Steven Davids (; born 13 March 1973) is a Dutch former professional footballer.

After beginning his career with Ajax, winning several domestic and international titles, he subsequently played in Italy for AC Milan, and later enjoyed a successful spell with Juventus, before being loaned out to Barcelona in 2004. He went on to play for Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur before returning to Ajax. Having struggled with injuries for two years, Davids returned to competitive football during a brief spell with Crystal Palace before retiring at the age of 37. In 2012, he was appointed player-manager at the English League Two club Barnet. He resigned by mutual agreement as manager in January 2014. He was capped 74 times by the Netherlands at international level, scoring six goals, and represented his country at the 1998 FIFA World Cup and the UEFA European Championship (three times: 1996, 2000, and 2004).

One of the greatest and most recognisable players of his generation, Davids often stood out on the football field due to his dreadlocked hair and the protective goggles he wore due to glaucoma. A combative and energetic, yet creative and skilful midfielder, Davids was nicknamed &quot;The Pitbull&quot; by Louis van Gaal because of his marking ability, aggression, and hard tackling style of play. In 2004, he was one of the players chosen by Pelé to feature in the FIFA 100, his list of the world&#x27;s greatest living footballers.

==Early life==
Edgar Steven Davids was born on 13 March 1973, in Paramaribo, Suriname and is of Afro-Surinamese descent, with Jewish heritage from his mother. The family moved to the Netherlands when Davids was an infant. His cousin Lorenzo is also a footballer.

==Club career==
===Ajax===
After being rejected on two previous occasions by the club, Davids started his career at the age of 12 with Ajax. He made his first team debut on 6 September 1991 in a 5–1 home win over RKC Waalwijk. He helped the Amsterdam club to three domestic Eredivisie titles, as well as continental success with the 1992 UEFA Cup and the 1995 UEFA Champions League. In the 1996 UEFA Champions League final, he missed Ajax&#x27;s first penalty in the shoot-out, which they ultimately lost to Juventus. While at Ajax, Davids was nicknamed &quot;The Pitbull&quot; by Ajax manager Louis van Gaal due to his fierce style of play in the team&#x27;s midfield.

===AC Milan and Juventus===
At the start of the 1996–97 season, Davids moved to Italy to play for AC Milan on a free transfer alongside team-mate Michael Reiziger, both early beneficiaries of the &quot;Bosman ruling&quot;. In an unsuccessful season in which defending champions Milan changed their manager twice and finished 11th in Serie A, Davids broke his leg in a 1–0 defeat at Perugia on 23 February 1997. After failing to recover his place in the team he was allowed to join league rivals Juventus in December 1997 for a reduced 9 billion Italian lire (£3 million) transfer fee. At Milan, Davids had been one of the biggest disappointments of the first half of the Serie A season, his teammate Alessandro Costacurta was critical of his character, calling him the &quot;rotten apple&quot; of the dressing room.

At Juventus he soon became a permanent first team member in the midfield, playing initially on the left flank, or later usually in the centre, as a defensive midfielder, forming a notable midfield partnership alongside French playmaker Zinedine Zidane; he was considered by pundits to be one of the best January transfers, while Juventus manager Marcello Lippi opined that Davids&#x27;s new role within the team was one of the most important tactical changes of the season, along with the shift to a three–player defence and using Zidane in a more advanced role behind the strikers. Six successful years in Turin followed, with Davids helping the side to the Serie A title in 1998, 2002 and 2003, as well as two Supercoppa Italiana and the UEFA Intertoto Cup. Lippi once described him as &quot;my one-man engine room&quot;.

Davids was often inspirational in Europe, playing 15 times as the club made it all the way to the 2002–03 Champions League final before losing to Milan on penalties. He had also previously managed to reach the Champions League final with Juventus in 1998, followed by a semi-final finish during the 1998–99 season, as well as reaching the 2002 Coppa Italia Final.

====Barcelona (loan)====
Following some tensions with Juventus manager Lippi, as well as competition from new arrivals for a starting spot at Juventus during the first half of the 2003-04 season, Davids joined Barcelona on loan in January 2004. Joining midway through a season where the club was struggling in mid-table and recently appointed manager Frank Rijkaard was under considerable pressure, Davids led Barça&#x27;s successful resurgence of form which saw them finishing second to Valencia in La Liga. Davids&#x27; arrival has been cited as the catalyst for the Catalan club&#x27;s dominance of Spanish and European football during the mid-to-late 2000s (decade), with Barcelona winning La Liga the following season (after five years without winning the league title) and a La Liga and Champions League double in 2005–06.

===Inter Milan and Tottenham Hotspur===
In the summer of 2004, Davids permanently moved on to Italian club Inter Milan on a three-year contract. When Inter terminated the remaining years of his contract in August 2005, he moved to England on a free transfer to play for Tottenham Hotspur. He had a successful stay at Tottenham and instantly became a fan favourite. His first and only goal was in a 2–1 away win against Wigan Athletic. Davids played for Spurs in the 2005–06 and the 2006–07 seasons, with the club finishing fifth in both seasons.

===Return to Ajax===

Davids signed once more for Ajax on 28 January 2007 and played his first match against club rivals Feyenoord on 4 February. After the mid-season switch, Davids proved his value for the Ajax team again. He was one of the key midfielders in the run for the Dutch championship that was lost on one single goal to PSV on the final day of the league. He also played a major role in Ajax&#x27;s cup campaign. He secured the KNVB Cup for Ajax by scoring the final penalty in a thrilling penalty shoot-out against AZ. Prior to the start of the 2007–08 season, Davids&#x27; leg was broken in a pre-season friendly against Go Ahead Eagles, sidelining him for around three months. In May 2008, Davids said he would leave Ajax when his contract expired on 30 June.

Davids played against the LA Galaxy on 6 December 2008 in an exhibition match held at Mount Smart Stadium in Auckland, New Zealand, as part of an Oceania XI All-Star team, despite the fact he is not from Oceania and has never played for an Oceanic club or national team. Davids was in contract negotiations with English Championship club Leicester City from 22 October 2009; however, he failed to make a decision for over a week and the club withdrew their offer on 30 October.

===Crystal Palace===
On 20 August 2010, Davids agreed a pay-as-you-play deal with English Championship club Crystal Palace. He made his debut on 24 August 2010 at left-back in the Second Round of the League Cup against Portsmouth. On 8 November 2010, he announced his departure from the club, stating it was &quot;one of the greatest experiences of my life&quot;.

==International career==

Davids made his debut for the Netherlands national team on 20 April 1994 in Tilburg, in a 1–0 defeat to the Republic of Ireland. He quickly became an integral part of the squad for the next decade, though he failed to win any major tournaments for the &quot;Oranje&quot;.

During UEFA Euro 1996, he was sent home by then manager Guus Hiddink for saying in a radio interview, &quot;Hiddink should stop putting his head in some players&#x27; asses.&quot;

Nonetheless, Davids remained appreciated by Hiddink, who included him in the Dutch squad for the 1998 FIFA World Cup in France. Davids&#x27; most notable performance for the national team came in the second round match against FR Yugoslavia. He scored the winning goal in the last minute of the game and ensured that the Dutch team went through to the next round to meet Argentina. The Netherlands eventually finished fourth overall and Davids was named to the official FIFA &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;.

In 1999, Davids began wearing protective glasses following surgery in his right eye caused by glaucoma, which developed in 1995 following eye injuries. Davids first wore them on 4 September 1999 in a friendly match against Belgium. On 17 May 2001, Davids was suspended by FIFA when he tested positive for the banned anabolic steroid, nandrolone.

Davids played in Euro 2000, where the Netherlands reached the semi-finals before losing to Italy via penalty shootout. Davids was again named as part of the &quot;Team of the Tournament&quot;.

During the Netherlands&#x27; Euro 2004 qualifying matches, Davids scored the Netherlands&#x27; first qualifying goal in their opening 3–0 victory against Belarus, and subsequently played in five of the remaining seven Group 3 fixtures and both legs of the play-off victory against Scotland.

After Euro 2004, new national team coach Marco van Basten appointed Davids as captain of the team. However, lack of first team football at his club Inter meant Davids lost his place in the national team in October 2004, thus losing the captain&#x27;s armband in the process, which was later handed to goalkeeper Edwin van der Sar. In October 2005, during the latter stages of qualifying for the 2006 World Cup, Davids was recalled to the national team, though not as captain. He fell out of the picture again shortly after, thereby missing out on the Dutch squad for the World Cup.

==Style of play==
A quick, hard-working, tenacious team player, gifted with power and pace, as well as exceptional physical strength and stamina in spite of his diminutive stature. Davids was renowned for his dynamic and combative style of play, tight marking of opponents, and ability to break down opposition plays as a defensive midfielder. A well-rounded midfielder, in addition to his ball-winning ability, as well as his physical and athletic attributes, Davids was also a highly talented and creative player, who was known for his outstanding technique, flair, vision, acceleration, close control, quick footwork, and ball-juggling skills; his technical ability and prowess at street soccer and as a freestyle footballer earned him the nickname &quot;The Mayor of the Street&quot; in his youth. Davids was also a powerful striker of the ball, as well as being an accurate passer and crosser with his excellent left foot, which enabled him to create chances for teammates after winning back possession, or help control the pace of games in midfield. His tactical intelligence, awareness, positioning, and ability to read the game, combined with his speed, energy, tackling, vision, and dribbling ability, allowed him to start counter-attacks after winning back possession and also enabled him to carry the ball forward, make attacking runs, and contribute to his team&#x27;s offensive play by linking up the defence and the attack effectively. His versatility and wide range of skills thus enabled him to be deployed in several other midfield positions throughout his career; he was capable of playing as a left midfielder, or as a central or box-to-box midfielder, or even as a left back, and in his youth, was also deployed as an attacking midfielder, or as a second striker on occasion. Regarded as one of the greatest midfielders of his generation, although he received acclaim for his playing ability and leadership as a footballer, Davids also gained a degree of infamy due to his strong character, temper, and outspokenness, which often led him to be involved in conflicts with his managers; he also struggled with injuries throughout his career. Due to his aggressive and hard-tackling playing style, Davids earned several nicknames throughout his career, such as &quot;The Piranha&quot;, &quot;Tubarão&quot; (The Shark), and most notably, &quot;The Pitbull&quot;. His Juventus manager Lippi once described him as his &quot;one-man engine room.&quot; During his time in Italy, pundits likened him to his rival, Argentine holding midfielder Matías Almeyda, although Almeyda believed that Davids was more offensive-minded, while he instead preferred to focus on the defensive aspect of the game in order to support his more creative and offensive teammates.

==Media==
Davids has appeared in commercials for the American sportswear company Nike. In 1996, he starred in a Nike commercial titled &quot;Good vs Evil&quot; in a gladiatorial game set in a Roman amphitheatre. Appearing alongside football players from around the world, including Ronaldo, Paolo Maldini, Eric Cantona, Patrick Kluivert and Jorge Campos, they defend &quot;the beautiful game&quot; against a team of demonic warriors, before it culminates with Cantona striking the ball and destroying evil.

In a global Nike advertising campaign in the run-up to the 2002 World Cup in Korea and Japan, Davids starred in a &quot;Secret Tournament&quot; commercial (branded by Nike as &quot;Scorpion KO&quot;) directed by Terry Gilliam, appearing alongside football players such as Thierry Henry, Ronaldinho, Francesco Totti, Luís Figo and Japanese star Hidetoshi Nakata, with former player Eric Cantona the tournament &quot;referee&quot;.

Davids features in EA Sports&#x27; &quot;FIFA&quot; video game series, and was selected to appear on the cover of &quot;FIFA Football 2003&quot; alongside Manchester United winger Ryan Giggs and Brazilian international Roberto Carlos. The online game &quot;League of Legends&quot; by Riot Games used Davids&#x27; likeness for a character skin called Striker Lucian without permission. Davids sued, and Dutch courts ruled that Riot Games must compensate Davids a percentage of their earnings from the skin.

==Coaching career==

===Ajax===
In June 2011, Davids was elected to the new supervisory board at Ajax alongside Johan Cruyff.

===Barnet===

Since 2010, Davids had been living in North London with his partner and had been participating in street football as well as managing Sunday league amateur side Brixton United. On 11 October 2012, Davids joined League Two side Barnet in a player-manager role, alongside Mark Robson. The next day, on his managerial debut, Barnet lost 4–1 at Underhill to Plymouth Argyle, with Davids leaving himself out of the squad. They followed this up with a 4–0 home win over Northampton Town where Davids played the full match, captaining the team and being voted Man of the Match. In November, he started against Morecambe which Barnet lost 4–1. Near the end of December 2012, following the departure of Robson, Davids took charge of the club by himself. Davids scored his first goal for Barnet in February 2013 in a 2–0 home victory over Southend United.

In March 2013, on the return journey from a defeat at Accrington Stanley, Davids sent the Barnet team coach back to pick up 36 supporters whose coach had broken down on the motorway and take them to the next service station.

Despite initially guiding Barnet off the foot of League Two, and lifting them out of the relegation zone, Barnet dropped back into the bottom two on the final day of the 2012–13 season, following a defeat to Northampton Town, and were relegated out of the Football League to the advantage of AFC Wimbledon who were able to escape by beating Fleetwood Town. On 21 May 2013, it was announced that Davids would remain in charge of Barnet for the club&#x27;s 2013–14 Conference Premier season. In July 2013, Davids announced his decision to wear the number 1 shirt for the 2013–14 season, a shirt number traditionally worn by goalkeepers, saying that he intended to &quot;set a trend&quot; of midfielders wearing the number 1 shirt.

Discipline was a major problem for Davids in the 2013–14 season. He was booked in each of the first eight league games he played, and sent off in three of them. There was also controversy when it emerged that he would not attend away games that required an overnight stay, leaving assistant manager Ulrich Landvreugd to take charge. In December 2013, Davids considered retiring from football after being sent off for the third time in the season in Barnet&#x27;s 2–1 defeat by Salisbury City.

Davids resigned from his post as manager on 18 January 2014.

In June 2014, Southern Counties East Football League side Greenwich Borough announced they were &quot;in advanced talks&quot; with Davids, with chairman Perry Skinner stating that he was &quot;70% sure he&#x27;ll come on board&quot;. The following month it was announced the club&#x27;s attempt to sign Davids had been unsuccessful.

===Telstar===
In 2020, Davids was appointed as assistant coach of Dutch Eerste Divisie club Telstar.

=== Olhanense ===
On January 4, 2021, Davids was announced as the head coach of Portuguese side, Olhanense. He was sacked on 19 July 2021.

==Personal life==
Davids was engaged to fashion designer Olcay Gulsen. In 1999, Davids started his own Street Soccer brand called Monta Street.

Davids won a lawsuit filed in a Dutch court against &quot;League of Legends&quot; developer Riot Games for using his likeness in an in-game association football-themed skin for the champion Lucian without his permission.

<doc id="252131" wikidata="Q450317" url="?curid=252131" title="Chien-Shiung Wu">
<text>Chien-Shiung Wu (; May 31, 1912 – February 16, 1997) was a Chinese-American particle and experimental physicist who made significant contributions in the fields of nuclear and particle physics. Wu worked on the Manhattan Project, where she helped develop the process for separating uranium into uranium-235 and uranium-238 isotopes by gaseous diffusion. She is best known for conducting the Wu experiment, which proved that parity is not conserved. This discovery resulted in her colleagues Tsung-Dao Lee and Chen-Ning Yang winning the 1957 Nobel Prize in Physics, while Wu herself was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize in Physics in 1978. Her expertise in experimental physics evoked comparisons to Marie Curie. Her nicknames include the &quot;First Lady of Physics&quot;, the &quot;Chinese Madame Curie&quot; and the &quot;Queen of Nuclear Research&quot;.

== Early life ==
Chien-Shiung Wu was born in the town of Liuhe, Taicang in Jiangsu province, China, on May 31, 1912, the second of three children of Wu Zhong-Yi () and Fan Fu-Hua (). The family custom was that children of this generation had Chien as the first character (generation name) of their forename, followed by the characters in the phrase Ying-Shiung-Hao-Jie, which means &quot;heroes and outstanding figures&quot;. Accordingly, she had an older brother, Chien-Ying, and a younger brother, Chien-Hao. Wu and her father were extremely close, and he encouraged her interests passionately, creating an environment where she was surrounded by books, magazines, and newspapers. Wu&#x27;s mother was a teacher and valued education for both sexes. Zhongyi Wu, her father, was an engineer and a social progressive. He participated in the 1913 Second Revolution while in Shanghai and moved to Liuhe after its failure. Zhongyi became a local leader. He created a militia that destroyed local bandits. He also established the Ming De School for girls with himself as principal.

== Education==
Wu received primary education at the Ming De School. Wu grew up as a modest and inquisitive child in a well-to-do family. She did not play outside like the other children but instead would listen to the newly invented radio for pleasure and knowledge. She also enjoyed poetry and Chinese classics such as the Analects, and western literature on democracy that her father promoted at home. Wu would listen to her father recite paragraphs from scientific journals instead of children&#x27;s stories until Wu learned how to read.

Wu left her hometown in 1923 at the age of 11 to go to the Suzhou Women&#x27;s Normal School No. 2, which was from her home. This was a boarding school with classes for teacher training as well as for regular high school, and it introduced subjects in science that slowly became a growing passion for the young Wu. Admission to teacher training was more competitive, as it did not charge for tuition or board and guaranteed a job on graduation. Although her family could have afforded to pay, Wu chose the more competitive option and was ranked ninth among around 10,000 applicants.
In 1929, Wu graduated at the top of her class and was admitted to National Central University in Nanjing. According to government regulations of the time, teacher-training college students wanting to move on to universities needed to serve as schoolteachers for one year. In Wu&#x27;s case, this was only nominally enforced. She went to teach at a public school in Shanghai, the president of which was the famous philosopher Hu Shih. Hu became a very notable political icon whom Wu saw as a second father and would visit Wu when she was in the United States. Hu was previously Wu&#x27;s teacher when she took a few courses at National China College and was impressed when Wu, who sat in the front seat to be noticed by her hero, finished and perfected the first three-hour assessment in less than two hours. Her elders advised her to &quot;ignore the obstacles.&quot; This was similar to what her father always reiterated to her, &quot;Just put your head down and keep walking forward.&quot;

Although Wu ended up doing scientific research, her writing was considered outstanding thanks to her early training. Her Chinese calligraphy was praised by others. Before matriculating to National Central University Wu spent the summer preparing for her studies with her usual full force. She felt that her background and training in Suzhou Women&#x27;s Normal School were insufficient to prepare her for majoring in science. Her father encouraged her to plunge ahead, and bought her three books for her self-study that summer: trigonometry, algebra, and geometry. This experience was the beginning of her habit of self-study, and it gave her sufficient confidence to major in mathematics in the fall of 1930.
From 1930 to 1934, Wu studied at National Central University (now known as Nanjing University) and first majored in mathematics but later transferred to physics. She became involved in student politics. Relations between China and Japan were tense at this time, and students were urging the government to take a stronger line with Japan. Wu was elected as one of the student leaders by her colleagues because they felt that since she was one of the top students at the university, her involvement would be forgiven, or at least overlooked, by the authorities. That being the case, she was careful not to neglect her studies. She led protests that included a sit-in at the Presidential Palace in Nanjing, where the students were met by Chiang Kai-shek.

For two years after graduation, she did graduate-level study in physics and worked as an assistant at Zhejiang University. She became a researcher at the Institute of Physics of the Academia Sinica. Her supervisor was Gu Jing-Wei, a female professor who had earned her PhD abroad at the University of Michigan and encouraged Wu to do the same. She became an important role model to the young Wu, who developed confidence and was sometimes blunt and honest when giving advice to close friends. Wu was accepted by the University of Michigan, and her uncle, Wu Zhou-Zhi, provided the necessary funds. She embarked for the United States with a female friend and chemist from Taicang, Dong Ruo-Fen (), on the in August 1936. Her parents and uncle saw her off at the Huangpu Bund as she boarded the ship. Her father and uncle were very sad while her mother was in tears that day, and little did Wu know that she would never see her parents again. Though her family would survive the Second World War, she would only visit the remaining members of her family decades later when she made trips to China in the 1970s.

== Early physics career ==
===Berkeley===

Wu and Dong Ruo-Fen arrived in San Francisco, where Wu&#x27;s plans for graduate study changed after visiting the University of California, Berkeley. She met physicist Luke Chia-Liu Yuan, a middle-class grandson from the concubine of Yuan Shikai (the self-proclaimed president of the new Republic of China and Emperor of China for six months before his death). As a result of his political lineage, Luke did not talk much about Yuan Shikai and Wu would tease him after she discovered the truth since her father once rebelled against Yuan Shikai. Yuan showed her the Radiation Laboratory, where the director was Ernest O. Lawrence, who would soon win the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1939 for his invention of the cyclotron particle accelerator.

Wu was shocked at the sexism in American society when she learned that at Michigan women were not even allowed to use the front entrance, and decided that she would prefer to study at the more liberal Berkeley in California. Wu was also influenced by her interest in the Berkeley facilities which included the first cyclotron of Lawrence, but her decision would disappoint Dong who studied at Michigan on her own. Yuan took her to see Raymond T. Birge, the head of the physics department, and he offered Wu a place in the graduate school despite the fact that the academic year had already commenced. Wu abandoned her plans to study at Michigan and enrolled at Berkeley. Her Berkeley classmates included Robert R. Wilson, who like others secretly admired Wu, and George Volkoff; her closest friends included post-doctoral student Margaret Lewis and Ursula Schaefer, a history student who chose to remain in the United States rather than return to Nazi Germany.

Wu missed Chinese cuisine and was not impressed with the food at Berkeley, so she always dined with friends such as Schaeffer at her favorite restaurant, the Tea Garden. Wu and her friends would get free meals that were not part of the menu due to her friendship with the owner. Wu applied for a scholarship at the end of her first year, but there was prejudice against Asian students from the department head Birge, and Wu and Yuan were instead offered a readership with a lower stipend. Yuan then applied for, and secured, a scholarship at Caltech. Birge, however, respected Wu for her talents and was the reason Wu could enroll even though the academic year already started.

Wu made rapid progress in her education and her research. Although Lawrence was officially her supervisor, she also worked closely with the famous Italian physicist Emilio Segrè. She quickly became his favorite student and the two conducted studies on beta decay, including xenon, which would provide important results in the future of nuclear bombs. According to Segrè, Wu was a popular student who was talented. In his autobiography, Nobel laureate Luis Alvarez said of Wu, I got to know this graduate student in this idle time. She used the same room next door, and was called &quot;Gee Gee&quot; [Wu&#x27;s nickname at Berkeley]. She was the most talented and most beautiful experimental physicist I have ever met. Segrè recognized Wu&#x27;s brilliance and compared her to Wu&#x27;s heroine Marie Curie, whom Wu always quoted, but said that Wu was more &quot;worldly, elegant, and witty.&quot; Meanwhile, Lawrence described Wu as &quot;the most talented female experimental physicist he had ever known, and that she would make any laboratory shine.&quot; When it came time to present her thesis in 1940, it had two separate parts presented in very neat fashion. The first was on bremsstrahlung, the electromagnetic radiation produced by the deceleration of a charged particle when deflected by another charged particle, typically an electron by an atomic nucleus, with the latter being on radioactive Xe. She investigated the first study using beta-emitting phosphorus-32, a radioactive isotope easily produced in the cyclotron that Lawrence and his brother John H. Lawrence were evaluating for use in cancer treatment and as a radioactive tracer. This marked Wu&#x27;s first work with beta decay, a subject on which she would become an authority.

The second part of the thesis was about the production of radioactive isotopes of Xe produced by the nuclear fission of uranium with the 37-inch and 60-inch cyclotrons at the Radiation Laboratory. Her second part on Xe and nuclear fission so impressed her committee, which featured Lawrence and J. Robert Oppenheimer, whom Wu affectionately called, &quot;Oppie&quot;, that Oppenheimer believed that Wu knew everything about the absorption cross section of neutrons, a concept that would be applied when Wu joined the Manhattan Project.

Wu completed her PhD in June 1940, and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa, the US academic honor society. In spite of Lawrence and Segrè&#x27;s recommendations, she could not secure a faculty position at a university, so she remained at the Radiation Laboratory as a post-doctoral fellow. Because of her early achievements, the &quot;Oakland Tribune&quot; released an issue on her entitled &quot;Outstanding Research in Nuclear Bombardments by a Petite Chinese Lady&quot;. The report quipped, A petite Chinese girl worked side by side with some top US scientists in the laboratory studying nuclear collisions. This girl is the new member of the Berkeley physics research team. Ms. Wu, or more appropriately Dr. Wu, looks as though she might be an actress or an artist or a daughter of wealth in search of Occidental culture. She could be quiet and shy in front of strangers, but very confident and alert in front of physicists and graduate students. China is always on her mind. She was so passionate and excited whenever &quot;China&quot; and &quot;democracy&quot; were referred to, as democracy meant so much in the 1940s. She is preparing to return and contribute to the rebuilding of China. Her plans changed when the Second World War began.

=== World War II and the Manhattan Project===

Wu and Yuan were married at the home of Robert Millikan, Yuan&#x27;s academic supervisor and the President of Caltech, on May 30, 1942. Neither the bride&#x27;s nor the groom&#x27;s families were able to attend due to the outbreak of the Pacific War. Wu and Yuan moved to the East Coast of the United States, where Wu became an assistant professor at Smith College, a private women&#x27;s college in Northampton, Massachusetts, while Yuan worked on radar for RCA. She found the job frustrating, as her duties involved teaching only, and there was no opportunity for research. She appealed to Lawrence, who wrote letters of recommendation to a number of universities. Smith responded by making Wu an associate professor and increasing her salary. She accepted a job from Princeton University in New Jersey as the first female faculty member in the history of the physics department, where she taught officers of the navy.

In March 1944, Wu joined the Manhattan Project&#x27;s Substitute Alloy Materials (SAM) Laboratories at Columbia University. She lived in a dormitory there, returning to Princeton on the weekends. The role of the SAM Laboratories, headed by Harold Urey, was to support the Manhattan Project&#x27;s gaseous diffusion (K-25) program for uranium enrichment. Wu worked alongside James Rainwater in a group led by William W. Havens Jr., whose task was to develop radiation detector instrumentation.
In September 1944, Wu was contacted by the Manhattan District Engineer, Colonel Kenneth Nichols. Wu was frustrated with her lack of professorships and volunteered to help out in the project. In the beginning, Wu was assigned to check the radiation effect of the reactor by building her own instruments; later, however, she was contacted for a much bigger role. The newly commissioned B Reactor, the first practical nuclear reactor ever built, which was located at the Hanford Site had run into an unexpected problem, starting up and shutting down at regular intervals. John Archibald Wheeler and partner Enrico Fermi suspected that a fission product, Xe-135, with a half-life of 9.4 hours, was the culprit, and might be a neutron poison or absorber. Segrè then remembered the 1940 PhD thesis that Wu had done for him at Berkeley on the radioactive isotopes of Xe and told Fermi to &quot;ask Ms. Wu&quot;. The paper on the subject was still unpublished, but after Fermi contacted Wu, Segrè visited her dorm room together with Nichols and collected the typewritten draft prepared for the &quot;Physical Review&quot;. The suspicions of Fermi and Wheeler came true, Wu&#x27;s paper unknowingly verified that Xe-135 was indeed the culprit for the B Reactor; it turned out to have an unexpectedly large neutron absorption cross-section. Wu, wary of her publication giving information to other nations on the arms race of the war, waited for a few months before November 1944, when she and Segrè submitted a complete study on these results, which was published months before the bombs were used the next year.

Wu also used her findings in radioactive uranium separation to build the standard model for producing enriched uranium to fuel the atomic bombs at the Oak Ridge, Tennessee facility as well as build innovative Geiger counters. Like many involved physicists in their later years, Wu later distanced herself from the Manhattan Project due to its destructive outcome and recommended to the Taiwanese president Chiang Kai-shek in 1962 to never build nuclear weapons. However, she was pleased to know that her family was safe in China. Years later, Wu in a rare occasion opened up on her involvement in building the bomb,Do you think that people are so stupid and self-destructive? No. I have confidence in humankind. I believe we will one day live together peacefully.

===Famous early experiments and academic leading career===
After the end of the war in August 1945, Wu accepted an offer of a position as an associate research professor at Columbia. She would remain at Columbia for the rest of her career, and was first named associate professor in 1952, which made her the first woman to become a tenured physics professor in university history.

In November 1949, Wu experimented with the conclusions of Einstein&#x27;s EPR thought experiment, which called quantum entanglement &quot;spooky action at a distance&quot;. Wu was the first to establish the phenomenon and validity of entanglement using photons through observing angular correlation, as her result confirmed Maurice Pryce and John Clive Ward&#x27;s calculations on the correlation of the quantum polarizations of two photons propagating in opposite directions. Specifically, the experiment carried out by Wu was the first important confirmation of quantum results relevant to a pair of entangled photons as applicable to the Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen (EPR) paradox.

==Chinese civil war and permanent residency==

After the second world war, communication with China was restored, and Wu received a letter from her family, but plans to visit China were disrupted by the civil war. Due to the civil war and communist takeover led by Mao Zedong, Wu would not return to China until decades later to meet her surviving uncle and younger brother. Though Wu did not support Mao, she also did not particularly respect the now deposed president Chiang Kai-shek and his wife Soong Mei-ling. Wu found Soong to be class-conscious, while Chiang, now based on Taiwan, was too complacent with foreign affairs and willing to let Soong handle diplomatic issues for him. However she decided to lend a bit more support to the Republic of China or Taiwan, as her teacher Hu carried close ties with the old republic. Due to the war, many were displaced and younger students would leave for the United States, while scholars in America could not return home. She missed China deeply, and would often go with Luke to buy fabric to make her own qipao, which she always wore under her lab coat as a way to remember the country.

Wu was also busy due to the birth of her son, Vincent ( &quot;Yuán Wěichéng&quot;), in 1947. Vincent became a physicist like his parents and attended Columbia, following in Wu&#x27;s footsteps. By the end of the civil war in 1949, Yuan joined the Brookhaven National Laboratory, and the family bought another home in Long Island. Yuan would regularly travel to Brookhaven in Long Island, and on weekends return to the family&#x27;s Manhattan home near Columbia University where Wu worked as its first female physics professor. After the communists came to power in China that year, Wu&#x27;s father wrote urging her not to return. Since her passport had been issued by the Kuomintang government, she found it difficult to travel abroad as places such as Switzerland did not recognize her passport. Sometimes her friend in Switzerland, physicist Wolfgang Pauli, had to secure her special visas just to enter the country. This eventually led to her decision to stay in the United States. With the help of Columbia chairman Charles H. Townes, Wu would become a US citizen in 1954.

== Establishing beta decay ==
In her post-war research, Wu, now an established physicist, continued to investigate beta decay. Enrico Fermi had published his theory of beta decay in 1934, but an experiment by Luis Walter Alvarez had produced results at variance with the theory. Wu set out to repeat the experiment and verify the result. Wu was already heavily invested in working on beta decay as she took on the subject at UC Berkeley. In the year 1949, Wu completely established Fermi&#x27;s theory and showed how beta decay worked, especially in creating electrons, neutrinos, and positrons. Supposedly, most of the electrons should come out of the nucleus at high speeds.

After careful research, Wu suspected that the problem was that a thick and uneven film of copper(II) sulfate () was being used as a copper-64 beta ray source, which was causing the emitted electrons to lose energy. To get around this, she adapted an older form of the spectrometer, a solenoidal spectrometer. She added detergent to the copper sulfate to produce a thin, even film. She then demonstrated that the discrepancies observed were the result of experimental error; her results were consistent with Fermi&#x27;s theory. The speeds of the electrons that were commonly produced in experiments were now shown to be significantly slower. Thus by analyzing radioactive materials used by previous researchers, she proved that this was the cause of the problem and not from theoretical flaws. Wu thus established herself as the leading physicist on beta decay. Her work on beta decay became hugely beneficial to her later research and to modern physics in general.

==Parity experiment==

At Columbia, Wu knew the Chinese-born theoretical physicist Tsung-Dao Lee personally. In the mid-1950s, Lee and another Chinese theoretical physicist, Chen Ning Yang, grew to question a hypothetical law of elementary particle physics, the &quot;law of conservation of parity&quot;. One example highlighting the problem was the puzzle of the theta and tau particles, two apparently differently charged, strange mesons. They were so similar that they would ordinarily be considered to be the same particle, but different decay modes resulting in two different parity states were observed, suggesting that and were different particles, if parity is conserved:

Lee and Yang&#x27;s research into existing experimental results convinced them that parity was conserved for electromagnetic interactions and for the strong interaction. For this reason, scientists had expected that it would also be true for the weak interaction, but it had not been tested, and Lee and Yang&#x27;s theoretical studies showed that it might not hold true for the weak interaction. Lee and Yang worked out a pencil-and-paper design of an experiment for testing conservation of parity in the laboratory. Because of her expertise in choosing and then working out the hardware manufacture, set-up, and laboratory procedures, Wu then informed Lee that she could carry out the experiment.
Wu chose to do this by taking a sample of radioactive cobalt-60 and cooling it to cryogenic temperatures with liquid gases. Cobalt-60 is an isotope that decays by beta particle emission, and Wu was also an expert on beta decay. The extremely low temperatures were needed to reduce the amount of thermal vibration of the cobalt atoms to almost zero. Also, Wu needed to apply a constant and uniform magnetic field across the sample of cobalt-60 in order to cause the spin axes of the atomic nuclei to line up in the same direction. For this cryogenic work, she needed the facilities of the National Bureau of Standards and its expertise in working with liquid gases, and traveled to its headquarters in Maryland with her equipment to carry out the experiments.

Lee and Yang&#x27;s theoretical calculations predicted that the beta particles from the cobalt-60 atoms would be emitted asymmetrically and the hypothetical &quot;law of conservation of parity&quot; was invalid. Wu&#x27;s experiment showed that this is indeed the case: parity is not conserved under the weak nuclear interactions. and are indeed the same particle, which is today known as a kaon, . This result was soon confirmed by her colleagues at Columbia University in different experiments, and as soon as all of these results were published—in two different research papers in the same issue of the same physics journal—the results were also confirmed at many other laboratories and in many different experiments.

The discovery of parity violation was a major contribution to particle physics and the development of the Standard Model. The discovery actually set the stage for the development of the model, as the model relied on the idea of symmetry of particles and forces and how particles can sometimes break that symmetry. The wide coverage of her discovery prompted the discoverer of fission Otto Frisch to mention that those at Princeton would often say that her experiment was the most impactful since the Michelson–Morley experiment that inspired Einstein&#x27;s theory of relativity. The AAUW called it the solution to the biggest riddle in science. Beyond showing the distinct characteristic of weak interaction from the other three conventional forces of interaction, this eventually led to the general CP violation or the violation of the charge conjugation parity symmetry. This violation meant researchers could distinguish matter from antimatter and create a solution that would explain the existence of the universe as one that is filled with matter. This is because the lack of symmetry gave the possibility of matter–antimatter imbalance which would allow matter to exist today through the Big Bang.

Lee and Yang were awarded the Nobel Prize for Physics in 1957 for their theoretical work, despite a &quot;firm tradition&quot; of the vast majority of the previous and following prizes being awarded to experimentalists, not theorists. Wu&#x27;s critical contribution providing the experimental confirmation proving the CP violation through her rigorous experiment was omitted by the Nobel committee. Yang and Lee tried to nominate Wu for a future Nobel prize and thanked her in their speeches. She was nominated at least seven times before 1966, when the Nobel committee announced they would conceal their list of nominees to avoid further public controversy. 1988 Nobel laureate Jack Steinberger frequently called it the biggest mistake of the Nobel committee. Wu&#x27;s role in the discovery was not publicly honored until 1978, when she was awarded the inaugural Wolf Prize.
Wu&#x27;s friend Pauli, who was notable for being the creator of the Pauli exclusion principle, was certain parity was true and was shocked with the discovery. He, like many other known physicists, lost a large hypothetical bet for wagering against the eventual outcome. He later wrote about his feelings on the discovery to Princeton colleague John M. Blatt: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whether anyone has written you as yet about the sudden death of parity. Miss Wu has done an experiment with beta-decay of oriented Co nuclei which shows that parity is not conserved in β decay. ... We are all rather shaken by the death of our well-beloved friend, parity.&quot; He later became even more confounded when he learned that Wu was denied the Nobel prize, and even believed that he had predicted the event through his dream analysis conducted by Dr. Carl Gustav Jung.

== Weak force and conserved vector current ==
Wu quickly became a full professor in 1958, and later on was named the first Michael I. Pupin Professor of Physics in 1973. Some of her impish students called her the Dragon Lady, after the character of that name in the comic strip &quot;Terry and the Pirates&quot; due to Wu&#x27;s strictness and high standards of excellence. Regardless of this, Wu actually treated her students like her children and often ate lunch with them as well as got to know their entourages. She would do this while working from 8 am to 7 or 8 in the evening, with her pay still very low until it was drastically increased after Robert Serber was installed as the new chairman. Her discoveries proved to be important in physics and her work even crossed over to biology and medicine, where her contributions became extremely influential to certain studies on the molecular changes in red blood cells that caused sickle cell disease or anemia.

In December 1962, Wu experimentally demonstrated a universal form and more accurate version of Fermi&#x27;s old beta decay model, confirming the conserved vector current (CVC) hypothesis of Richard Feynman and Murray Gell-Mann on the road to the Standard Model. She would release the results in the succeeding year. In this experiment, she was approached by Gell-Mann after he and Feynman realized they needed an expert on experimental physics to prove their hypothesis. Gell-Mann pleaded to Wu, &quot;How long did Yang and Lee pursue you to follow upon their work?&quot; Their hypothesis was influenced by Wu&#x27;s demonstration that parity was not conserved, which brought other assumptions that physicists have made about the weak interaction into question. The question was if parity cannot be conserved in weak force interaction, then the conservation of charge conjugation could also be in dispute. Conservation and symmetry were basic laws that held true for electromagnetism, gravity, and the strong interaction, so it had been assumed for decades that they should also hold for the weak interaction until Wu debunked these laws. This was also crucial to the future discovery of the electroweak force.

Wu worked with a number of student assistants including Y.K. Lee, Mo Wei or L.W. Mo, and Lee Rong-Gen from Korea. Using a Van de Graaff accelerator at Columbia with proton, heavy hydrogen, and helium beams, they were able to perform their notable experiment. The beta ray spectra were measured in the magnetometer spectroscopy fifty feet from the accelerator. The beta decay sources B-12 and N-12 were produced in the magnetometer. The laboratories were locked during midnight and Mo had to create a duplicate key for everyone to sneak in and out of the laboratory during the wee hours of the morning. Mo would escort Wu to her Manhattan apartment home. Wu&#x27;s discovery was presented at the Hilton hotel on January 26, 1963. Wu was pleased with the achievement and mentioned that it gave a complete foundation for Fermi&#x27;s theory of beta decay as well as provide support for the theory of the two-component neutrino, which her parity experiment first established. Feynman was very happy with the announcement and was so proud of the outcome that he called the CVC theory, together with his diagram and work in quantum electrodynamics, one of his finest scientific accomplishments.

Later in the 1960s, Wu conducted more experiments on beta decay, specifically on double beta decay. She went inside a 2,000 ft deep salt mine below Lake Erie in Ohio to investigate on muonic atoms in which muons take the place of
electrons in normal atoms. The work conducted here would pave the way for its future discovery in the 1980s.

Wu later wrote a textbook with Steven Moszkowski entitled &quot;Beta Decay&quot;, which was published in 1966. It was the first comprehensive study on beta decay, and the book quickly became the standard reference on the subject; it remains one of the standard references in the 21st century.

==Later years and social advocacy==

Wu&#x27;s older brother died in 1958, her father the next year, and her mother in 1962. The United States State Department had imposed severe restrictions on travel to Communist countries by its citizens, so Wu was not permitted to visit mainland China to attend their funerals. She saw her uncle, Wu Zhou-Zhi, and younger brother, Wu Chien-Hao, on a trip to Hong Kong in 1965. After the 1972 Nixon visit to China, relations between the two countries improved, and she visited China again in 1973. Wu nearly visited in 1956, but decided to stay in the US to finish her famous experiment while her husband visited China. By the time she returned, her uncle and brother had perished in the Cultural Revolution, and the tombs of her parents had been destroyed. She was greeted by Zhou Enlai, who personally apologized for the destruction of the tombs. After this, she returned to China and Taiwan several times.

During the late 20th century, Wu continued to be seen as the top experimental physicist in the world and many continued to ask for her guidance in proving certain hypotheses. Herwig Schopper, who was the director general of CERN, commented that physicists believed &quot;if the experiment was done by Wu, it must be correct.&quot; She conducted experiments on Mössbauer spectroscopy and its application in the study of sickle cell anemia. She researched on the molecular changes in the deformation of hemoglobins that cause this form of anemia. She also did research on magnetism in the 1960s. Wu would later work on Bell&#x27;s theorem, which showed results that confirmed the orthodox interpretation of quantum mechanics.

In later life, Wu became more outspoken. She protested the imprisonment in Taiwan of the in-laws of physicist Kerson Huang in 1959 and of the journalist Lei Chen in 1960. With the help of her teacher Hu Shih, Huang&#x27;s in-laws were eventually released on bail. Lei&#x27;s sentence was reduced to ten years by President Chiang Kai-shek. In 1964, she spoke out against gender discrimination at a symposium at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. &quot;I wonder,&quot; she asked her audience, &quot;whether the tiny atoms and nuclei, or the mathematical symbols, or the DNA molecules have any preference for either masculine or feminine treatment&quot;, which garnered heavy applause from the audience. When men referred to her as Professor Yuan, she immediately corrected them and told them that she was Professor Wu.

In 1975, physics department chairman Serber discovered that Wu had a much lower pay than her male colleagues but that she had never reported on it, so he adjusted her pay to make it equal to that of her male counterparts even if Wu only cared about the research at Columbia. Wu later quipped, In China there are many, many women in physics. There is a misconception in America that women scientists are all dowdy spinsters. This is the fault of men. In Chinese society, a woman is valued for what she is, and men encourage her to accomplishments, yet she remains eternally feminine. Wu&#x27;s advocacies and conviction maintained a strong priority for the advancement of the sciences. Later in 1975 as the first female president of the American Physical Society, Wu met with President Gerald Ford to formally request him to create an advisory scientific body for the president, which President Ford granted and signed into law the formation of the Office of Science and Technology Policy.
Wu also continued to be an advocate for human rights issues as she protested the crackdown in China that followed the Tiananmen Square massacre of 1989. In 1978, she was awarded the first Wolf Prize in Physics. One of its criteria considered those who were thought deserving to win a Nobel Prize without receiving one. She retired in 1981 and became a professor emerita.

== Final years and legacy==

Wu would spend most of her time in her later years visiting the People&#x27;s Republic of China, Taiwan, and different American states. She became renowned for her steadfast promotion of teaching STEM subjects to all students regardless of gender or any other discriminating cause. Wu suffered a stroke on February 16, 1997, in New York City. An ambulance rushed her to St. Luke&#x27;s–Roosevelt Hospital Center, where she was pronounced dead. Her granddaughter, Jada Wu Hanjie, remarked, &quot;I was young when I saw my grandmother, but her modesty, rigorousness and beauty were rooted in my mind. My grandmother had emphasized much enthusiasm for national scientific development and education, which I really admire.&quot;

During her retirement, Columbia hosted a celebration &quot;to honor the First Lady of Physics&quot;, which garnered a huge reception, and subsequently held a banquet at the Qian Jia Fu restaurant along Broadway. The Polish-American award-winning professor Isidor Rabi called Wu one who had made greater contributions to science than Marie Curie, in spite of her nickname as the &quot;Chinese Madame Curie&quot;. Maurice Goldhaber later quipped, &quot;People avoid doing experiments in beta decay, simply because they know that Wu Chien-Shiung will do a better job than anybody!&quot; The other physicists were surveyed for their opinions on the finest female physicists, with Wu, Lise Meitner, and Curie coming in different orders depending on their standards; Leon Lederman noted that Curie and Wu were equally above Meitner while Valentine Telegdi ranked Wu first among female physicists. Regardless of the differing views, Wu was highly regarded by members of the scientific community.
In accordance with Wu&#x27;s wishes, her ashes were buried in the courtyard of the Ming De School that her father had founded and that she had attended when she was younger.

<text>The Scottish National Liberation Army (SNLA), nicknamed the Tartan Terrorists, is a Scottish nationalist paramilitary group which aims to bring about Scottish independence from the United Kingdom. The group was founded in 1980 by Adam Busby, a former soldier from Paisley, after the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum, which the organisation claims was fixed. The group&#x27;s activities primarily involved sending letter bombs to UK government officials, carrying out arson attacks, and making numerous hoax threats of violence, before declaring a ceasefire in 2012, to allow debates leading up to the 2014 Scottish independence referendum to take place.

==History==

===Formation===
The SNLA was founded in 1980 by Adam Busby, a former soldier who served in the Argyll and Sutherland Highlanders. Busby was also a founding member of the Scottish Republican Socialist Party (SRSP), and a former member of the Scottish National Party (SNP), in which he joined the Dumbarton branch on his 16th birthday. The SNLA was formed in the wake of the 1979 Scottish devolution referendum,
which despite resulted in the majority of voters (51.6%) supporting the establishment of a devolved parliament in Scotland, this never came to fruition as there was only a 64% voter turnout, with the Yes vote representing only 32.9% of registered voters in the referendum, which did not meet the requirements for at least 40% of voters voting in favour, per the Scotland Act 1978. Busby felt that this outcome called for a more forceful approach towards achieving independence, on the grounds that there was &quot;no constitutional way forward&quot;.

===Activity===
====1980s====
The group started their armed campaign in March 1982, when a letter bomb was sent to the House of Commons addressed to John Nott, the then-Secretary of State for Defence. A man had telephoned the Glasgow offices of &quot;the Scotsman&quot;, claiming that a bomb had been sent to Nott by the SNLA in response to the newly announced changes to the UK&#x27;s trident programme. The bomb subsequently arrived at the House of Commons on 17 March, which was later reported after being discovered by a Ministry of Defence member, who narrowly escaped detonating the bomb. The device was initially thought by the media to have been the work of Irish republican paramilitaries, such as the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), as it coincidentally arrived at the commons on St. Patrick&#x27;s Day. To coincide with the 1982 Glasgow Hillhead by-election  the following week, two further letter bombs were sent to two separate Scottish Social Democratic Party offices in Edinburgh and Glasgow; both devices were subsequently diffused by the authorities upon discovery by office staff. The group later claimed responsibility for a letter bomb that was posted to Queen Elizabeth II at Buckingham Palace, along with two further letter bombs to two Conservative party offices in Edinburgh and London, and an incendiary device that was reportedly planted in the Scottish Assembly building. Scotland Yard claimed no such device had arrived at Buckingham palace, and purported the device that was sent to the London Conservative Party office to have been a hoax. In November, the group claimed responsibility for a firebomb attack at that took place at a Conservative party office in Glasgow on 8 November. On the 24th November, the Glasgow offices of the Press Association reported that it had received a written letter from the group, who claimed responsibility for a letter bomb that was sent to then-Secretary of State for Industry Patrick Jenkin, stating &quot;SNLA will avenge the workers in Craigneuk&quot; in response to a proposal made by the British Steel Corporation to partially close a steel mill in Craigneuk, North Lanarkshire, costing 427 jobs. The letter bomb was discovered by Jenkin&#x27;s secretary, and was later diffused by police. A spokesman for Scotland Yard stated &quot;There is no doubt this could have killed someone. It was similar to others sent to politicians in the past.&quot; Following this incident, security was tightened for an upcoming visit to Edinburgh from then-prime minister Margaret Thatcher, who was due to attend a private dinner taking place in the Edinburgh Assembly rooms in celebration of the centenary of the Scottish Conservatives.

In 1983, the group reportedly carried out 27 attacks, which primarily involved sending letter bombs to public figures including Diana, Princess of Wales, and Margaret Thatcher. The letter bomb targeted at Princess Diana, was posted in February to the then-Lord Provost of Glasgow Michael Kelly to the Glasgow City Chambers, where Diana was due to visit. The letter ignited after being opened by Kelly&#x27;s secretary, Eric Hamilton, who at the time was in his office interviewing a woman who was set to take part in a welcome event for the arrival of HMS Glasgow to the city the following day. Hamilton sustained only minor injuries and rejected hospital treatment, opting instead to join Kelly in welcoming Diana. In April, another letter bomb was sent by the group to a hotel located in South Mimms, where Thatcher was due to attend a Conservative Party Conference that was taking place. The device was later discovered by Salisbury MP candidate Robert Key, who later called the police, leading to the device&#x27;s diffusal. A spokesman for Scotland Yard stated that the device could not have detonated, stating: &quot;The incendiary device was contained in a small jiffy bag. It consisted of lighter fuel.&quot; The SNLA also sent a letter to the London offices of the Press Association, claiming responsibility for the device sent to the hotel, stating it was &quot;in retaliation for cuts in Scots industry.&quot; The letter also contained a claim of responsibility from the group for a letter bomb delivered to an Army careers office in Penge, South East London. In June, the group claimed another letter bomb posted to the Conservative Central Office, which was addressed to then-Conservative Party chairman Cecil Parkinson, which partially ignited after being opened by his secretary, who was unharmed. Claim of responsibility was made by the group in a Glasgow-postmarked letter sent to the Press Association, which stated &quot;Scottish National Liberation Army claims the London letter bomb attacks of 3–4 June.&quot; A spokesperson for Scotland Yard described the device as &quot;a viable device containing substances which could ignite and cause serious injury.&quot; In response to the incident, Commander William Hucklesby, the then-head of Scotland Yard&#x27;s anti-terror branch subsequently issued a warning to mail workers to be vigilant of any suspicious packages. In August, a letter bomb was sent by the group to the manager of Cardowan Colliery; the device did not explode. The day before, the group sent a letter to the Press Association which stated &quot;SNLA attacks on 19/20. No more cuts,&quot; in response to a decision made by the National Coal Board to close the colliery. In September, another letter bomb was sent to then-Secretary of State for Employment Norman Tebbit, which ignited after being opened in the Westminster offices of the Department of Employment by a 19-year-old civil servant. The device contained a written letter, which although was largely destroyed by the explosion, was found to bear &#x27;SNLA&#x27; on the remains. The same day, a letter bomb was posted to then-Secretary of State for Scotland George Younger, which failed to ignite. Around this time, Busby, along with another organisation member, David Dinsmore, fled to Dublin to evade prosecution for conspiracy against the UK government, with Busby facing further charges for scrawling anti-British slogans on a Royal Navy truck in Berwick-upon-Tweed. Following Busby and Dinsmore&#x27;s absconsion, a separate cell for the organisation was subsequently set up in Dublin, and continued to exist for over 20 years. In October, the group claimed responsibility for another letter bomb addressed to then-Employment Secretary Tom King at the House of Commons, which had been intercepted in Glasgow. The group sent a note to the Press Association claiming responsibility for the device, warning that &quot;SNLA attacks take place now. More will follow.&quot; Special Branch officers described the device as &quot;crude, but viable.&quot; In December, an anonymous caller claiming to represent the group phoned the Press Association claiming the group was responsible for an explosion that occurred at the Royal Artillery Barracks in Woolwich, South East London on 11 December, which injured four soldiers, along with a bystander, stating &quot;more will follow&quot;. Scotland Yard were sceptical of this claim, however, and believed the attack was more likely to have been carried out by the Provisional Irish Republican Army (IRA), as the scale of the attack did not match previous attacks carried out by the SNLA, and also due to Thomas Quigley, who was actively involved in simultaneous attacks carried out by the Provisional IRA, being charged with conspiracy to carry out bomb attacks in England the previous week. In October, the SNLA had sent a letter to police stating their intention to carry out a mass bombing campaign in London along with other major towns and cities throughout England. The IRA initially did not claim responsibility for the bombing, and Scotland Yard believed that the SNLA were behind the attack, however, a spokesman for the IRA later claimed the group were responsible for the attack, and no involvement from the SNLA was mentioned. Following this attack, it was determined that the SNLA may have had links to the Irish National Liberation Army (INLA), who threatened to carry out a similar bombing campaign around the same time. Under the orders of Commander William Hucklesby, police in London were instructed to prepare for the possibility a dual threat of bomb attacks from both groups over the Christmas period.

Also in 1983, the group claimed to have planted a plastic explosive under the stage in Perth City Hall, allegedly intending to assassinate Thatcher, who was scheduled to attend a Conservative party conference being held in the building, and launch a renewed campaign for the upcoming general election. An anonymous caller phoned a news agency claiming the group had &quot;planted a six-pound plastic explosive and sealed it in a veterinary medical chest under the City Hall stage,&quot; along with claims that the bomb had remained undetected for 25 days, only being discovered 48 hours before the conference, and that it was set to be detonated remotely. In response to the claims, Tayside Police declined to confirm or deny the incident, stating: &quot;We cannot comment on this, this is a security matter.&quot; In January 1984, group member Thomas Kelly was jailed for ten years after pleading guilty to making and delivering explosive packages; one such device, which was again addressed to Tebbit, was recovered from a post box in Ingram Street, Glasgow. Kelly&#x27;s arrest and conviction were brought about after an undercover Special Branch agent volunteered to inform the police on the SNLA&#x27;s activies, fearing that the Scottish nationalist movement would turn violent. The agent also reportedly held conversations with Kelly at his home, which had been bugged, allowing detectives to listen in. In October 1984, Busby successfully avoided extradition back to the United Kingdom to face criminal charges for the vandalisation of a Naval lorry in August 1983, after a Dublin court ruled that Busby&#x27;s actions were &quot;political.&quot; In November, the group claimed responsibility for the delivery of another letter bomb to Thatcher, which was diffused after being discovered in a post office in Nine Elms, South West London. Scotland Yard described the device as &quot;viable&quot;, and that it could have resulted in serious injury had it been opened. In 1985 the following year, the group claimed responsibility for an incendiary attack that occurred at the Ministry of Defence Headquarters in Whitehall, London. The attack was carried out by planting a miniature device in an empty fifth-floor sub basement inside the building; the fire lasted for more than six hours and caused serious structural damage, estimated at £700,000.

On 19 April 1986, the group claimed responsibility for a letter bomb that was discovered in the House of Commons, addressed to then-Scottish Secretary Malcolm Rifkind. The device was diffused by police after being alerted by a Commons sorting office staff member, who discovered the device. Although the device was described as &quot;crude&quot;, a spokesman for Scotland Yard stated the device &quot;would have caused severe burning to the hands if it had gone off&quot;. On 22 April the following week, another letter bomb claimed by the group was discovered and diffused at the British Steel Headquarters. The group claimed the device was sent to British Steel in response to the closure of a Gartcosh steel works, which resulted in 700 job losses. Two days later on 24 April, the group phoned the Press Association following a bombing that occurred at a British Airways office in Oxford Street, London, claiming responsibility for the attack. The caller provided detailed information on how the bomb was constructed, and clarified that British Airways was targeted in response to an attempt by the UK government to completely privatize the company, which the group believed would result in significant job losses, along with total withdrawal of airline services in remote areas of Scotland. However, despite this claim, the media did not explicitly name who was claiming to be responsible for the bombing, until the following day when the issue was brought up in the House of Commons by Giles Shaw, who acknowledged calls received by the Press Association from the SNLA, along with English terrorist group the Angry Brigade, who claimed responsibility for the bombing &quot;in retaliation for Britain&#x27;s involvement in the American bombing of Libya.&quot; An investigation carried out by the Metropolitan Police anti-terrorist branch found no evidence that the bombing was linked to Libya, and both claims from the SNLA and the Angry Brigade were later discounted by police. In July, the group claimed responsibility for a letter bomb posted to then-Home Secretary Douglas Hurd, which ignited after being opened by Home Office security staff. An anonymous caller phoned &quot;the Scotsman&quot; on behalf of the organisation claiming the delivery was made by an alleged body within the SNLA called the &quot;Willie McRae Commando&quot;. The device was also described as &quot;crude and amateur&quot; by police, and no major injuries were reported.

No further activity was claimed by the group since the letter bomb sent to Hurd, until May 1989, when a huge explosion, followed by a blaze was reported at the Glensanda Quarry in Morvern, near Oban, Argyll. The local coastguard had alerted the local emergency services after residents in the surrounding areas reported hearing a loud explosion accompanied by a large cloud of black smoke on the opposite end of Loch Linnhe, where the Quarry was located. The group phoned the Press Association hours after the blaze, claiming that the group had carried out an attack on the site, and stated that the site was targeted allegedly due to the site being used for &quot;disposal of civilian and nuclear waste&quot;. Despite this claim, police and fire experts concluded that the fire was accidental, reportedly due a rubber conveyor belt catching fire, and many reports on the incident left out the claim of responsibility from the SNLA. Reporters also ruled out any possibility of the incident being an attack, as the Quarry was inaccessible by road, and that workers were transported to the plant directly from Oban on company boats. Claims of the site being redeveloped as a dump for nuclear waste were subsequently denied by nuclear industry officials.

====1990s====

In December 1991, the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; had received claims from the SNLA that the group had planted a bomb on the grounds of Holyrood Palace in a renewed attempt to assassinate the Queen. The group claimed to have broken into the grounds of the palace armed with 11lbs of explosives on the night of 27 June, where Anne, Princess Royal was sleeping, with the Queen due to arrive the following day. The paper had also claimed that two masked men had been seen climbing over the perimeter wall, wearing communication devices and armed with handguns, followed by two other similarly armed men, who allegedly delivered explosive devices intended to be planted in a hole dug in the grounds of the palace, close to where a garden party was scheduled to take place. The paper further claimed that the four men fled the premises after being spotted by security staff. However, Lothian and Borders Police, while acknowledging that an alarm had gone off at the palace, discounted these claims, claiming that no one had been spotted on the grounds, and no member of the royal family was in any danger. The claims to the &quot;Sunday Mail&quot; also contained an interview with Busby, who didn&#x27;t personally take part in the operation, in which he reportedly stated: &quot;The well-planned and audacious assault on Holyrood Palace failed only because of sheer bad luck. Encouraged by the near-success of this operation, which was a serious threat to the lives of English royalty, the SNLA pledges itself to continue these attacks.&quot;

In 1993, another group member, Andrew McIntosh was sentenced to 12 years in prison after being linked to a conspiracy by the SNLA to coerce the UK government into establishing an independent government in Scotland, along with illegal possession of a Kalashnikov rifle, a sawn-off shotgun and a pistol. The High Court in Aberdeen heard that McIntosh had orchestrated a three-month campaign of fear tactics, which involved placing hoax explosives outside Aberdeen-based oil industry buildings and mailing genuine letter bombs to Dounreay nuclear plant in Caithness, the headquarters of Anglian Water in Huntingdon, and the Scottish Office in Edinburgh. McIntosh was arrested on 28 August following a police search of his home, in which a firearms certificate covering the possession of a .22 pistol, a 9mm Browning, and a revolver, along with a semi-automatic rifle, and a Walther P22, which were not covered by the certificate. When questioned by Grampian Police about the hoax explosive devices placed outside oil industry offices following his arrest, which McIntosh allegedly admitted to have been &quot;privy to their making,&quot; McIntosh claimed &quot;Scotland&#x27;s oil is being stolen - that&#x27;s why we targeted those companies.&quot; When asked about the letter bombs, McIntosh stated &quot;Dounreay is a dumping ground for nuclear waste. The Scottish Office are collaborators. Huntingdon are basically thieves stealing our resources.&quot; McIntosh was found to have been linked to the SNLA after he told detectives &quot;I am a volunteer soldier with the SNLA. I am a cell commander. The actions we have taken are directed at those people who are actively working against the interests of Scotland. Whatever I did, I did in the line of duty.&quot; During the trial, bomb experts told the court that the hoax devices planted by McIntosh were crafted in such a way that they were thought to have been real at first, with one expert describing them as &quot;the best hoax bombs seen in Great Britain.&quot; McIntosh was also found to have been a former member of Scottish ultranationalist group Siol nan Gaidheal, which he had briefly joined in 1992 after being disillusioned with the Scottish National Party (SNP). He was later expelled from the group after a few months following a leadership clash. After serving six years, McIntosh was released in 1999. He was rearrested for firearms possession on 9 October 2004, the same day Queen Elizabeth II appeared at the opening ceremony of the newly completed Scottish Parliament Building, and committed suicide whilst in custody on 18 October, just hours before he was due to reappear in the Aberdeen Sheriff Court for his offences.

In March 1995, further explosive devices were posted to various Labour Party figures, in which a device was posted to a venue in Inverness, where a Scottish Labour Party conference was taking place, along with other devices which were sent to the County Durham home of then-Leader of the Opposition, and future prime minister Tony Blair, future Secretary of State for Defence George Robertson, and to the then-headquarters of the Labour Party, John Smith House in Southwark, London. Several shopping centers in Birmingham were also evacuated as a result of bomb threats made by the group. In April, numerous airports in Scotland were on high alert after the group threatened to carry out bomb attacks on aircraft if demands made by the group were not met by 18 May, which included imposing a ban on &quot;English immigration&quot;. The group also claimed to have developed a new type of letter bomb that was designed evade detection systems and detonate inside aircraft cargo units upon reaching a certain height. The following month, the group was reportedly being investigated by police after it was claimed that the group had planted a fake bomb on a British Airways flight heading from Belfast to London. The device, which had its battery removed prior to delivery, was allegedly sent by the group to show that it was capable of causing devastation to British air transportation. Upon investigation, a spokeswoman for British Airways commented &quot;We have had a report on the incident and have been assured there was no risk to the aircraft.&quot; Further enquiries surrounding the incident were subsequently referred to police, where a spokesman for City of London Police, despite open claims from the SNLA, said they were unable to determine if the incident had actually taken place or not, and a spokesman for the Royal Ulster Constabulary declined to comment on the group&#x27;s claim. In August, two men, Kevin Paton and Terrence Webber, were jailed for four years for involvement in the group&#x27;s March activities. Webber had previously made a claim to &quot;Scottish Sun&quot; journalist Alan Muir that the group &quot;wanted Scotland to be free, to be a nation on its own, without the shackles of England and without the English being here, having our jobs&quot;.

In March 1997, Busby was sentenced to two years in prison for sending threats of violence by fax to the Daily Record, and the Press Association news agency. The threats reportedly contained a hit list of intended targets, which included English-born MP for Clydebank and Milngavie Tony Worthington, along with threats of petrol bomb attacks against &quot;English colonists&quot; in Scotland. Busby was later released from prison in November 1997. In May 1999, another Dublin-based organisation member, Hugh Smith McMahon, was given a two-year suspended prison sentence for making a hoax telephone claim that he had planted an explosive device on the Kessock Bridge in Inverness. In July 1999, Busby was rearrested after being linked to a blackmail plot to commit mass murder by contaminating English and Welsh water supplies with weedkiller unless British troops were withdrawn from Northern Ireland. The arrest was made after a month-long joint investigation was carried out by Scotland Yard and the Gardaí after letters were sent to senior figures, including then-prime minister Tony Blair, demanding a &quot;total British military and political withdrawal&quot; from Northern Ireland by June 16, followed by threats of retaliation without warning if the deadline was not met.

====2000s====
In 2000, the SNLA claimed to have sent over 12,000 e-mails bearing anti-English messages to the Northern Constabulary headquarters in Inverness, in an attempt to crash the force&#x27;s main computer system. A spokesman for the Scottish Separatist Group (SSG), who denied involvement in the e-mail attack, claimed that the Northern Constabulary was allegedly targeted due to significant employment of English police officers, along with the SNLA&#x27;s dissatisfaction with the force&#x27;s handling of past investigations. A spokeswoman for the Northern Constabulary clarified that over 1000 e-mails from the SNLA had been received at the Inverness headquarters, but stated that minimal disruption occurred, as the computer receiving the e-mails was not connected to the force&#x27;s other systems.

In 2001, the group claimed responsibility for hoax anthrax packages delivered to the University of St Andrews, where Prince William was studying. The same year, Adam Busby Jr., the son of the organisation founder, was sentenced to six years in jail for carrying out various petrol bomb attacks. In 2002, Cherie Blair became a target of a renewed campaign by the SNLA when she was sent an anonymous parcel containing a vial that was crudely labelled as containing aromatherapy oil, but which on investigation proved to contain caustic acid. In addition, a renewed letter bomb campaign was waged against Scottish politicians, parcels were recovered after a man claiming to be from the SNLA made an anonymous phone call to Scotland Yard, claiming that up to 16 packages were distributed to various targets. In 2003, Paul Smith, a 17-year-old boy from Dumbarton, pleaded guilty to being involved with the actions, where he also admitted to delivering two hoax poison letters to Prince William. Smith also allegedly sent a total of 44 hoax anthrax letters between August 2001 and February 2002, in which one letter was posted to Prince William&#x27;s halls of residence at St. Andrew&#x27;s University, which contained a warning that stated &quot;By the time you read this letter you will not be able to breathe and will be suffering respiratory failure.&quot; When Smith had been arrested in April 2002, his computer was seized by police for further investigation, where it was discovered that Smith had been recruited by an anonymous man via e-mail to aid the group with their activities, in which dozens of e-mails between the two were reportedly found.

In 2006, it was reported that the group was being investigated by the Home Office and Strathclyde Police, after the group had sent an e-mail to the Glasgow offices of &quot;The Sunday Times&quot;, threatening to poison England&#x27;s water supplies. The e-mail stated: &quot;Our aim is to poison water supplies in England, not in the entire UK. We have the means to do this and we shall. This is a war and we intend to win it.&quot; In addition, it was reported that Adam Busby may be targeted for extradition to the United States to face terror charges, following a series of e-mails to the country about how to contaminate US water supplies.

In January 2008, two men, Wayne Cook and Steven Robinson were convicted in Manchester of sending miniature bottles of vodka contaminated with caustic soda to various public figures, which included Blackburn with Darwen councillor John Wright, and &quot;Scottish Daily Express&quot; journalist Myra Philp, and threatening to kill English people &quot;at random and with no discrimination or compunction&quot; by poisoning English water supplies, echoing a previous threat made in 2006. The poisoned bottle sent to Philp was accompanied by a letter signed &#x27;SNLA&#x27; stating &quot;This is necessary to convince the British Government that we will lethally poison England&#x27;s water supplies, if they do not withdraw totally from Scotland.&quot; Cook and Robinson were each sentenced by the Manchester Crown Court to six years in jail for these offences.

In June 2009, Adam Busby Jr. was reincarcerated for six years for sending a total of six packages containing shotgun cartridges accompanied by notes bearing threats of violence to various political figures, including First Minister Alex Salmond, Liberal Democrat MSP Mike Rumbles, the Scottish National Party (SNP) headquarters, and Glasgow City Council. Police linked the crimes to Busby Jr. after he made calls to numerous journalists claiming responsibility for the actions.

====Ceasefire and extradition of Busby====
In July 2010, Adam Busby Sr. was sentenced by an Irish court to four years in jail after being convicted in June 2010 of making hoax bomb threats against transatlantic flights. In 2012, following the UK government&#x27;s offer to legislate to allow the Scottish Government the powers to hold a referendum on Scottish independence, the group issued a statement to media outlets declaring a ceasefire, with hopes of achieving independence more &quot;peacefully and democratically&quot;. The statement said:

Following his 2010 conviction, Adam Busby was released from jail on 21 March 2014, and was reported at the time to be living in a Dublin hostel, banned from internet access, and was awaiting verdicts about possible extradition to Scotland and the US. In February 2015, Busby was extradited back to Scotland. In October of that year, however, a Glasgow court ruled that Busby, who at the time was diagnosed with multiple sclerosis, was medically unfit to be tried over multiple bomb threats. In 2017, the Sheriff court of Lothian and Borders in Edinburgh ruled that Busby, by then 69, was too ill to be sent to the US, as his illness was at an advanced stage.

==Associated organisations==
The Scottish Separatist Group (SSG; ) has been described as the political wing of the SNLA. The SSG was formed in 1995 by breakaway members and supporters of the SNLA and shared the same ideology, with an emphasis on reversing English immigration into Scotland and promoting Scottish Gaelic as the country&#x27;s national language.

In 1999, the SSG issued a letter to the &quot;The Press and Journal&quot; threatening to intensify their protests against English immigration, with a particular focus on demonstrating against the Royal family, who were due to attend upcoming events in Aberdeen. The letter explicitly indicated that the group intended to host demonstrations at Balmoral Castle and Braemar, where the royal family where due to visit, along with Crathie Kirk, where the Queen and Prince Philip where due to be joined by then-prime minister Tony Blair and his wife, Cherie. The letter also claimed that the group, who were reportedly based in Dundee at the time, had set up a new branch in Aberdeen, with the intention of covering Buchan to the Mearns. Alex Salmond, then leader of the Scottish National Party (SNP) condemned the threats, stating &quot;Previous elections have shown there is absolutely no support from the people of the North-east for the kind of politics these people represent.&quot; The letter was forwarded to Grampian Police, who subsequently launched an investigation.

In 2000, the group sent e-mails to several MSPs giving information on how to disrupt an upcoming visit to Inverness from the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh on 3 July, along with announcements of a demonstration from the group against the monarchy, leading to a renewed investigation by police. The week before, it was reported that various road signs near Inverness, Elgin, and Aviemore had been smeared with symbols and slogans associated with both the SSG and the SNLA. The SSG was also discovered to have established links with the alleged political wing of the Real IRA, the 32 County Sovereignty Movement (32CSM), where it was reportedly exchanging information on the upcoming Royal visit to Inverness. The 32CSM also reportedly included a link on their website leading to the SSG&#x27;s website, which featured an appeal for support in disrupting upcoming Royal visits.

In 2006, the Home Office launched an investigation into the SSG under the Terrorism Act 2006 after the group had allegedly published detailed instructions on how to contaminate English water supplies. The published material was said to provide instructions on how to craft and use an unnamed substance, which was described as a &quot;WMD&quot; in the publication, to permanently poison the water supplies of major UK cities, with the aim of &quot;destroying the economic, political and military power of the state by poisoning and contaminating the drinking water supplies of any major city.&quot;

==Reception and legacy==
The SNLA has been condemned by the UK government, the Irish government, and Scottish National Party (SNP) leader John Swinney, who described the organisation as people who &quot;have no interest in Scotland or the Scottish people&quot;, and that its members were &quot;not nationalists, they are criminals plain and simple.&quot; In 2002, &quot;The Independent&quot; described the actions of the group as &quot;a warning of what might have been if democrats had not taken control of the SNP after the Second World War,&quot; and labelled the group as &quot;lost souls in an inhospitable wilderness.&quot;

To date, none of the actions carried out by the group have resulted in any deaths, and the group has long been believed to have consisted of very few members. Author Andrew Murray Scott, who co-wrote &quot;Britain&#x27;s Secret War&quot;, in which the group&#x27;s activities are examined, stated in a 1993 interview with &quot;The Herald&quot; following McIntosh&#x27;s imprisonment: &quot;I believe the SNLA effectively finished in 1984 as an organisation and now it is only one or two people. Adam Busby persistently claims to be involved with it but he could be it.&quot; When the group delivered caustic packages to Downing Street in 2002, University of St Andrews professor and terrorism expert Paul Wilkinson commented: &quot;The SNLA has surfaced from time to time. It&#x27;s obviously very tiny, in fact I understand the police are working on the theory it may have been just one individual behind this.&quot;

<text>Food science (or bromatology) is the basic science and applied science of food; its scope starts at overlap with agricultural science and nutritional science and leads through the scientific aspects of food safety and food processing, informing the development of food technology.

Food science brings together multiple scientific disciplines. It incorporates concepts from fields such as chemistry, physics, physiology, microbiology, and biochemistry. Food technology incorporates concepts from chemical engineering, for example.

Activities of food scientists include the development of new food products, design of processes to produce these foods, choice of packaging materials, shelf-life studies, sensory evaluation of products using survey panels or potential consumers, as well as microbiological and chemical testing. Food scientists may study more fundamental phenomena that are directly linked to the production of food products and its properties.

== Definition ==
The Institute of Food Technologists defines food science as &quot;the discipline in which the engineering, biological, and physical sciences are used to study the nature of foods, the causes of deterioration, the principles underlying food processing, and the improvement of foods for the consuming public&quot;. The textbook &quot;Food Science&quot; defines food science in simpler terms as &quot;the application of sciences and engineering to study the physical, chemical, and biochemical nature of foods and the principles of food processing&quot;.

==Disciplines==
Some of the subdisciplines of food science are described below.

===Food chemistry===

Food chemistry is the study of chemical processes and interactions of all biological and non-biological components of foods. The biological substances include such items as meat, poultry, lettuce, beer, and milk.
It is similar to biochemistry in its main components such as carbohydrates, lipids, and protein, but it also includes areas such as water, vitamins, minerals, enzymes, food additives, flavors, and colors. This discipline also encompasses how products change under certain food processing techniques and ways either to enhance or to prevent them from happening.

====Food physical chemistry====

Food physical chemistry is the study of both physical and chemical interactions in foods in terms of physical and chemical principles applied to food systems, as well as the application of physicochemical techniques and instrumentation for the study and analysis of foods.

=== Food engineering ===
Food engineering is the industrial processes used to manufacture food. It involves coming up with novel approaches for manufacturing, packaging, delivering, ensuring quality, ensuring safety, and devising techniques to transform raw ingredients into wholesome food options.

===Food microbiology===
Food microbiology is the study of the microorganisms that inhabit, create, or contaminate food, including the study of microorganisms causing food spoilage. &quot;Good&quot; bacteria, however, such as probiotics, are becoming increasingly important in food science. In addition, microorganisms are essential for the production of foods such as cheese, yogurt, bread, beer, wine and, other fermented foods.

===Food technology===

Food technology is the technological aspect. Early scientific research into food technology concentrated on food preservation. Nicolas Appert&#x27;s development in 1810 of the canning process was a decisive event. The process was not called canning then and Appert did not really know the principle on which his process worked, but canning has had a major impact on food preservation techniques.

===Foodomics===

In 2009, Foodomics was defined as &quot;a discipline that studies the Food and Nutrition domains through the application and integration of advanced -omics technologies to improve consumer&#x27;s well-being, health, and knowledge&quot;. Foodomics requires the combination of food chemistry, biological sciences, and data analysis.

Foodomics greatly helps scientists in the area of food science and nutrition to gain better access to data, which is used to analyze the effects of food on human health, etc. It is believed to be another step towards a better understanding of the development and application of technology and food. Moreover, the study of foodomics leads to other omics sub-disciplines, including nutrigenomics which is the integration of the study of nutrition, genes, and omics.

===Molecular gastronomy===
Molecular gastronomy is a subdiscipline of food science that seeks to investigate the physical and chemical transformations of ingredients that occur in cooking. Its program includes three axes, as cooking was recognized to have three components, which are social, artistic, and technical.

===Quality control===
Quality control involves the causes, prevention, and communication dealing with food-borne illness. Quality control also ensures that the product meets specs to ensure the customer receives what they expect from the packaging to the physical properties of the product itself.

===Sensory analysis===

Sensory analysis is the study of how consumer&#x27;s senses perceive food.

===Careers in Food Science===
The five most common college degrees leading to a career in food science are: Food science/technology (66%), biological sciences (12%), business/marketing (10%), nutrition (9%) and chemistry (8%).

Careers available to food scientists include food technologists, research and development (R&amp;D), quality control, flavor chemistry, laboratory director, food analytical chemist and technical sales.

The five most common positions for food scientists are food scientist/technologist (19%), product developer (12%), quality assurance/control director (8%), other R&amp;D/scientific/technical (7%), and director of research (5%).

==By country==

===Australia===

The Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) is the federal government agency for scientific research in Australia. CSIRO maintains more than 50 sites across Australia and biological control research stations in France and Mexico. It has nearly 6,500 employees.

===South Korea===
The Korean Society of Food Science and Technology, or KoSFoST, claims to be the first society in South Korea for food science.

===United States===
In the United States, food science is typically studied at land-grant universities. Some of the country&#x27;s pioneering food scientists were women who attended chemistry programs at land-grant universities which were state-run and largely under state mandates to allow for sex-blind admission. Although after graduation, they had difficulty finding jobs due to widespread sexism in the chemistry industry in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Finding conventional career paths blocked, they found alternative employment as instructors in the home economics departments and used that as a base to launch the foundation of many modern food science programs. 

The main US organization regarding food science and food technology is the Institute of Food Technologists (IFT), headquartered in Chicago, Illinois, which is the US member organisation of the International Union of Food Science and Technology (IUFoST).

<doc id="252144" wikidata="Q28173017" url="?curid=252144" title="Ground pangolin">
<text>The ground pangolin (Smutsia temminckii), also known as Temminck&#x27;s pangolin, Cape pangolin or steppe pangolin is a species of pangolin from genus &quot;Smutsia&quot; of subfamily Smutsiinae the within family Manidae. It is one of four species of pangolins which can be found in Africa, and the only one in southern and eastern Africa. The animal was named for the Dutch zoologist Coenraad Jacob Temminck.

== Physical description ==
Pangolins are almost completely covered in overlapping, protective scales, which makes up about 20% of their body weight. The scales are composed of keratin, the same material that forms human hair and fingernails, and give pangolins an appearance similar to a pinecone or artichoke. The underside of a pangolin is not covered with scales, but sparse fur, instead. When threatened, it usually rolls up into a ball, thus protecting its vulnerable belly.
Pangolins are long exclusive of the tail and weigh from . Across all eight species, adult tail length ranges from about . Mature adults are light brown, olive, and dark brown in color, while young are pale brown or pink in color.

Ground pangolins walk on their hind legs, occasionally using their forelegs and their tail for balance. They have five toes on each hind foot, while their forelimbs feature three long, curved central claws, accompanied by two smaller claws on the first and fifth digits. The muscular forelimbs and central claws are adapted for breaking into ant and termite colonies, as well as excavating burrows. Because of these claws, pangolins must balance on the outer edges of their fore feet and tuck in the claws to prevent damage. Pangolins have long, broad tails and small, conical heads with jaws that lack teeth. To replace the act of chewing, the pangolin stomach is muscular, with keratinous spines that project into the interior and contains small stones to mash and grind prey, similarly to a bird&#x27;s gizzard. Pangolins also have long, muscular tongues to reach and lap up ants and termites in cavities. Their tongues stretch so far, they are actually longer than their bodies. The tongue is attached in the lower cavity, near the pelvis and the last pair of ribs, and is able to retract and rest in the chest cavity. Pangolins have reduced pinnae, so they have poor hearing, as well as poor vision, although they do have a strong sense of smell.

== Range and distribution ==
The African pangolin species are native to 15 African countries dispersed throughout southern, central, and east Africa. &quot;S. temminckii&quot; is the only species found in southern and eastern Africa. It prefers savannah woodland with moderate amounts of scrub at low elevations.

== Behavior and social organization ==
Little is known about the pangolin, as it is difficult to study in the wild. Pangolins are solitary animals and only interact for mating. They dig and live in deep burrows made of semispherical chambers. These burrows are large enough for humans to crawl into and stand up. Although it is capable of digging its own burrow, the ground pangolin prefers to occupy those abandoned by warthogs or aardvarks or to lie in dense vegetation, making it even more difficult to observe. African pangolins such as the ground pangolin prefer burrows, while Asian pangolins sleep in hollows and forks of trees and logs. They are nocturnal animals. They mark their territory with urine, secretions, and by scattering their feces. When threatened, their defense mechanism is to curl into a ball with their scales outward, hiss and puff, and lash out with their sharp-edged tails. The scales on the tails are capable of a cutting action to inflict serious wounds. Pangolins are also capable of emitting noxious acid from glands near the anus, similar to a skunk, to ward off predators. The ground pangolin&#x27;s main predators are leopards, hyenas, and humans. Pangolins roll in herbivore dung. Young pangolins ride on the base of their mothers&#x27; tails and slip under the mother when she curls up for protection.

== Diet ==
The ground pangolin is wholly myrmecophagous, meaning that they only feed on ants and termites. In fact, they demonstrate prey selectivity, only eating specific ant and termite species rather than foraging on the most abundant species. They have been observed exposing entire subterranean nests of a certain species of termites without eating any, preferring to find their species of choice. Their determination of suitable prey does not seem to be based on the size of the species alone, but likely also depends on the chemical and mechanical defenses of each species. Even in arid environments, ground pangolins remain selective in their dietary habits with regard to prey species and only prey on a small subset of available ant and termite species.

== Reproduction and lifecycle ==
The lifespan of the pangolin is unknown, but the observed lifespan in captivity is 20 years. They are sexually dimorphic, with the males being 10–50% heavier than females. No defined mating season is known, but pangolins tend to mate during the summer and autumn. The gestation period ranges up to 139 days for ground pangolins and other African species. African species females usually birth only one offspring, but litters of three have been observed in Asian species. When born, a pangolin has soft, pale scales, which begin to harden by the second day. The young are usually about long and about at birth. They are nursed by their mothers for 3 to 4 months, but begin eating termites after only one month. Pangolins reach sexual maturity at 2 years old, when they leave their mothers and begin living alone.

== Conservation status and threats ==
The ground pangolin is listed as vulnerable by the IUCN Red List. The assessors state, &quot;there is an inferred past/ongoing and projected future population reduction of 30–40% over a 27-year period (nine years past, 18 years future; generation length estimated at nine years) based primarily on ongoing exploitation for traditional medicine and bushmeat throughout the species&#x27; range and evidence of increased intercontinental trade to Asia.&quot;

The two main threats encountered by ground pangolin populations are habitat loss and illegal trafficking. Due to human cultivation of land, the pangolin faces habitat fragmentation and corresponding reduction in numbers. Meanwhile, illegal trade has an even stronger impact, as pangolins are reported to be the most trafficked animal in the world (with elephants a close second). The scales alone account for 20% of the black market in protected animal parts; they are boiled off the body and used for traditional medicines. Pangolin meat is sold as a high-end delicacy in China and Vietnam, the blood is believed to be a healing tonic, and pangolin fetuses have alleged health benefits and aphrodisiac qualities. A conservative estimate of pangolins trafficked illegally each year is 10,000, while actual numbers for a two-year period may be in excess of 250,000. How many are left in the wild is unknown. Pangolins are generally poorly known to the public and their endangered status has so far received much less publicity than in the case of more iconic species.

<text>The Connecticut River is the longest river in the New England region of the United States, flowing roughly southward for through four states. It rises 300 yards (270 m) south of the U.S. border with Quebec, Canada, and discharges at Long Island Sound. Its watershed encompasses , covering parts of five U.S. states and one Canadian province, via 148 tributaries, 38 of which are major rivers. It produces 70% of Long Island Sound&#x27;s fresh water, discharging at per second.

The Connecticut River Valley is home to some of the northeastern United States&#x27; most productive farmland, as well as the Hartford–Springfield Knowledge Corridor, a metropolitan region of approximately two million people surrounding Springfield, Massachusetts, and Hartford, Connecticut.

==History==
The word &quot;Connecticut&quot; is a corruption of the Mohegan word &quot;quinetucket&quot; and Nipmuc word &quot;kwinitekw&quot;, which mean &quot;beside the long, tidal river&quot;. The word came into English usage during the early 1600s to name the river, which was also called simply &quot;The Great River&quot;. It was also known as the Fresh River, and the Dutch called it the Verse River.

Early spellings of the name by European explorers included &quot;Cannitticutt&quot; in French or in English.


===Pre-1614: American Indian populations===
Archaeological digs reveal human habitation of the Connecticut River Valley for 6,000 years before present. 
Numerous tribes lived throughout the fertile Connecticut River valley prior to Dutch exploration beginning in 1614. Information concerning how these tribes lived and interacted stems mostly from English accounts written during the 1630s.

The Pequots dominated a territory in the southern region of the Connecticut River valley, stretching roughly from the river&#x27;s mouth at Old Saybrook, Connecticut, north to just below the Big Bend at Middletown, Connecticut. They warred with and attempted to subjugate neighboring agricultural tribes such as the Western Niantics, while maintaining an uneasy stand-off with their rivals the Mohegans.

The Mattabesset (Tunxis) tribe takes its name from the place where its sachems ruled at the Connecticut River&#x27;s Big Bend at Middletown, in a village sandwiched between the territories of the aggressive Pequots to the south and the more peaceable Mohegans to the north.

The Mohegans dominated the region due north, where Hartford and its suburbs sit, particularly after allying themselves with the Colonists against the Pequots during the Pequot War of 1637.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://www.dickshovel.com/moh.html&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Their culture was similar to the Pequots, as they had split off from them and become their rivals some time prior to European exploration of the area.

The agricultural Pocomtuc tribe lived in unfortified villages alongside the Connecticut River north of the Enfield Falls on the fertile stretch of hills and meadows surrounding Springfield, Massachusetts. The Pocomtuc village of Agawam eventually became Springfield, situated on the Bay Path where the Connecticut River meets the western Westfield River and eastern Chicopee River. The Pocomtuc villagers at Agawam helped Puritan explorers settle this site and remained friendly with them for decades, unlike tribes farther north and south along the Connecticut River. The region stretching from Springfield north to the New Hampshire and Vermont state borders fostered many agricultural Pocomtuc and Nipmuc settlements, with its soil enhanced by sedimentary deposits. Occasionally, these villages endured invasions from more aggressive confederated tribes living in New York, such as the Mohawk, Mahican, and Iroquois tribes.

The Pennacook tribe mediated many early disagreements between colonists and other Indian tribes, with a territory stretching roughly from the Massachusetts border with Vermont and New Hampshire, northward to the rise of the White Mountains in New Hampshire. The Western Abenaki (Sokoki) tribe lived in the Green Mountains region of Vermont but wintered as far south as the Northfield, Massachusetts, area. The (Sokoki) tribe migrated to Odanak, Quebec following the epidemics and the wars with the settlers but returned to Vermont. 

===1614–1636: Dutch and Puritan settlement===
In 1614, Dutch explorer Adriaen Block became the first European to chart the Connecticut River, sailing as far north as Enfield Rapids. He called it the &quot;Fresh River&quot; and claimed it for the Netherlands as the northeastern border of the New Netherland colony. In 1623, Dutch traders constructed a fortified trading post at the site of Hartford, Connecticut, called the &quot;Fort Huys de Hoop&quot; (&quot;Fort House of Hope&quot;).

Four separate Puritan-led groups also settled the fertile Connecticut River Valley, and they founded the two large cities that continue to dominate the Valley: Hartford (est. 1635) and Springfield (est. 1636). The first group of pioneers left the Plymouth Colony in 1632 and ultimately founded the village of Matianuck (which became Windsor, Connecticut) several miles north of the Dutch fort. A group left the Massachusetts Bay Colony from Watertown, seeking a site where they could practice their religion more freely. With this in mind, they founded Wethersfield, Connecticut, in 1633, several miles south of the Dutch fort at Hartford.

In 1635, Reverend Thomas Hooker led settlers from Cambridge, Massachusetts, where he had feuded with Reverend John Cotton, to the site in Connecticut of the Dutch Fort House of Hope, where he founded Newtowne. Shortly after Hooker&#x27;s arrival, Newtowne annexed Matianuck based on laws articulated in Connecticut&#x27;s settlement charter, the Warwick Patent of 1631. The patent, however, had been physically lost, and the annexation was almost certainly illegal.

The fourth English settlement along the Connecticut River came out of a 1635 scouting party commissioned by William Pynchon to found a city on the river&#x27;s most advantageous site for commerce and agriculture. Pynchon&#x27;s Massachusetts scouts located the Pocomtuc village of Agawam, where the Bay Path trade route crossed the Connecticut River at two of its major tributaries—the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west—and just north of Enfield Falls, the river&#x27;s first unnavigable waterfall. Pynchon surmised that traders using any of these routes would have to dock and change ships at his site, thereby granting the settlement a commercial advantage. It was initially named Agawam Plantation and was allied with the settlements to the south that became the state of Connecticut. In 1641, Springfield splintered off from the Hartford-based Connecticut Colony, allying itself with the Massachusetts Bay Colony. For decades, Springfield remained the Massachusetts Bay Colony&#x27;s westernmost settlement, on the northern border of the Connecticut Colony.

Of these settlements, Hartford and Springfield quickly emerged as powers. By 1654, however, the success of these English settlements rendered the Dutch position untenable on the Connecticut River. A treaty moved the boundary westward between the Connecticut Colony and New Netherland Colony to a point near Greenwich, Connecticut. The treaty allowed the Dutch to maintain their trading post at Fort Huys de Hoop, which they did until the 1664 British takeover of New Netherland.

===Border disputes===
The Connecticut River Valley&#x27;s central location, fertile soil, and abundant natural resources made it the target of centuries of border disputes, beginning with Springfield&#x27;s defection from the Connecticut Colony in 1641, which brought the Massachusetts Bay Colony to the river. In 1640, Massachusetts Bay Colony asserted a claim to jurisdiction over lands surrounding the river; however, Springfield remained politically independent until tensions with the Connecticut Colony were exacerbated by a final confrontation later that year.

Hartford kept a fort at the mouth of the Connecticut River at Old Saybrook for protection against the Pequots, Wampanoags, Mohegans, and the New Netherland Colony. After Springfield broke ties with the Colony, the remaining Connecticut settlements demanded that Springfield&#x27;s ships pay tolls when passing the mouth of the river. The ships refused to pay this tax without representation at Connecticut&#x27;s fort, but Hartford refused to grant it. In response, the Massachusetts Bay Colony solidified its friendship with Springfield by levying a toll on Connecticut Colony ships entering Boston Harbor. Connecticut was largely dependent on sea trade with Boston and therefore permanently dropped its tax on Springfield, but Springfield allied with Boston nonetheless, drawing the first state border across the Connecticut River.

The Fort at Number 4 in Charlestown, New Hampshire, was the northernmost British colonial presence on the Connecticut River until the end of the French and Indian War in 1763. The Abenaki had resisted British colonial settlement for decades, but colonists began settling north of Brattleboro, Vermont, following the war. Settlement of the Upper Connecticut River Valley increased quickly, with population assessments of 36,000 by 1790.

Vermont was claimed by both New Hampshire and New York, and was settled primarily through the issuance of land grants by New Hampshire Governor Benning Wentworth beginning in the 1740s. New York protested these grants, and King George III decided in 1764 that the border between the provinces should be the western bank of the Connecticut River. Ethan Allen, the Green Mountain Boys, and other residents of the disputed area resisted attempts by New York to exercise authority there, which resulted in the establishment of the independent Vermont Republic in 1777 and its eventual accession to the United States in 1791 as the fourteenth state. Boundary disputes between Vermont and New Hampshire lasted for nearly 150 years and were finally settled in 1933, when the U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed King George&#x27;s boundary as the ordinary low-water mark on the Vermont shore. In some places, the state line is now inundated by the impoundments of dams built after this time.

===The Treaty of Paris and the 19th century===
The Treaty of Paris (1783) that ended the American Revolutionary War created a new international border between New Hampshire and the Province of Canada at &quot;northwesternmost headwaters of the Connecticut&quot;. Several streams fit this description, and thus a boundary dispute led to the short-lived Indian Stream Republic, which existed from 1832 to 1835.

The broad, fertile Connecticut River Valley attracted agricultural settlers and colonial traders to Hartford, Springfield, and the surrounding region. The high volume and numerous falls of the river led to the rise of industry along its banks during the Industrial Revolution. The cities of Springfield and Hartford in particular became centers of innovation and &quot;intense and concentrated prosperity.&quot;

The Enfield Falls Canal was opened in 1829 to circumvent shallows around Enfield Falls, and the locks built for this canal gave their name to the town of Windsor Locks, Connecticut. The Connecticut River Valley functioned as America&#x27;s hub of technical innovation into the 20th century, particularly the cities of Springfield and Hartford, and thus attracted numerous railroad lines. The proliferation of the railroads in Springfield and Hartford greatly decreased the economic importance of the Connecticut River. From the late 1800s until today, it has functioned largely as a center of wildlife and recreation.

===Log drives and the early 20th century===
Starting about 1865, the river was used for massive logging drives from Third Connecticut Lake to initially water powered sawmills near Enfield Falls. Trees cut adjacent to tributary streams including Perry Stream and Indian Stream in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, Halls Stream on the Quebec–New Hampshire border, Simms Stream, the Mohawk River, and the Nulhegan River basin in Essex County, Vermont, would be flushed into the main river by the release of water impounded behind splash dams. Several log drivers died trying to move logs through Perry Falls in Pittsburg. Teams of men would wait at Canaan, Vermont, to protect the bridges from log jams. Men guided logs through a drop along the length of Fifteen-Mile Falls (now submerged under Moore and Comerford reservoirs), and through Logan&#x27;s Rips at Fitzdale, Mulligan&#x27;s Lower Pitch, and Seven Islands. The White River from Vermont and Ammonoosuc River from New Hampshire brought more logs into the Connecticut. A log boom was built between Wells River, Vermont, and Woodsville, New Hampshire, to hold the logs briefly and release them gradually to avoid jams in the Ox Bow. Men detailed to this work utilized Woodsville&#x27;s saloons and red-light district. Some of the logs were destined for mills in Wilder and Bellows Falls, Vermont, while others were sluiced over the Bellows Falls dam. North Walpole, New Hampshire, contained twelve to eighteen saloons, patronized by the log drivers. Mount Tom was the landmark the log drivers used to gauge the distance to the final mills near Holyoke, Massachusetts. These spring drives were stopped after 1915, when pleasure boat owners complained about the hazards to navigation. The final drive included 500 workers controlling 65 million feet of logs. A final pulp drive consisted of 100,000 cords of four-foot logs in 1918. This was to take advantage of the wartime demand.

===The flood of 1936===

In March 1936, due to a winter with heavy snowfall, an early spring thaw and torrential rains, the Connecticut River flooded, overflowing its banks, destroying numerous bridges and isolating hundreds of people who had to be rescued by boat.

The dam at Vernon, Vermont, was topped by . Sandbagging by the National Guard and local volunteers helped prevent the dam&#x27;s powerhouse from being overwhelmed, despite blocks of ice breaking through the upstream walls.

In Northampton, Massachusetts, looting during the flood became a problem, causing the mayor of the city to deputize citizen patrols to protect flooded areas. Over 3,000 refugees from the area were housed in Amherst College and the Massachusetts State Agricultural College (now UMass Amherst).

Unprecedented accumulated ice jams compounded the problems created by the flood, diverting water into unusual channels and damming the river, raising water levels even further. When the jam at Hadley, Massachusetts, gave way, the water crest overflowed the dam at Holyoke, overwhelming the sandbagging there. The village of South Hadley Falls was essentially destroyed, and the southern parts of Holyoke were severely damaged, with 500 refugees.

In Springfield, Massachusetts, , and of streets, were flooded, and 20,000 people lost their homes. The city lost power, and nighttime looting caused the police to issue a &quot;shoot on sight&quot; edict; 800 National Guard troops were brought in to help maintain order. Rescue efforts using a flotilla of boats saved people trapped in upper stories of buildings, bringing them to local fraternal lodges, schools, churches and monasteries for lodging, medical care, and food. The American Red Cross and local, state and federal agencies, including the WPA and the CCC, contributed aid and manpower to the effort. Flooding of roads isolated the city for a time. When the water receded, it left behind silt-caused mud which in places was thick; the recovery effort in Springfield, at the height of the American Great Depression, took approximately a decade.

Overall, the flood caused 171 deaths and US$500 million (US$ with inflation) in damages. Across the northeast, over 430,000 people were made homeless or destitute by flooding that year.

The Connecticut River Flood Control Compact between the states of Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, and Vermont was established in 1953 to help prevent serious flooding.

===1936–present: Water supply===
The creation of the Quabbin Reservoir in the 1930s diverted the Swift River, which feeds the Chicopee River, a tributary of the Connecticut. This resulted in an unsuccessful lawsuit by the state of Connecticut against the diversion of its riparian waters.

Demand for drinking water in eastern Massachusetts passed the sustainable supply from the existing system in 1969. Diverting water from the Connecticut River was considered several times, but in 1986 the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority instead undertook a campaign of water conservation. Demand was reduced to sustainable levels by 1989, reaching approximately a 25% margin of safety by 2009.

==Course==
The Connecticut River is the largest river ecosystem in New England. Its watershed spans Connecticut, Massachusetts, New Hampshire, Vermont, small portions of Maine, and the Canadian province of Quebec.

===The Upper Connecticut River: New Hampshire and Vermont===

The Connecticut River rises from Fourth Connecticut Lake, a small pond south of the Canada–United States border in the town of Pittsburg, New Hampshire, at an elevation of above sea level. It flows through the remaining Connecticut Lakes and Lake Francis for , all within the town of Pittsburg, and then widens as it delineates of the border between New Hampshire and Vermont. The river drops more than in elevation as it winds south to the border of Massachusetts where it sits above sea level.

The region along the river upstream and downstream from Lebanon, New Hampshire, and White River Junction, Vermont, is known as the &quot;Upper Valley&quot;. The exact definition of the region varies, but it generally is considered to extend south to Windsor, Vermont, and Cornish, New Hampshire, and north to Bradford, Vermont, and Piermont, New Hampshire. In 2001, the Trust for Public Land purchased of land in New Hampshire from International Paper, allowing the Connecticut Lakes Headwaters Partnership Task Force to plan the future protection of the land. The property spans the towns of Pittsburg, Clarksville, and Stewartstown, New Hampshire, nearly 3 percent of the land in the state of New Hampshire. The Trust for Public Land worked in partnership with the Society for the Protection of New Hampshire Forests, The Nature Conservancy of New Hampshire, and others to raise around $42 million. A conservation easement over of the property prohibits development of the land while allowing public access. The forest is managed by the Lyme Timber Company, and the conservation easement over the land ensures sustainable forest management of the property.

===The Middle Connecticut River: Massachusetts through central Connecticut===
Following the most recent ice age, the Middle Connecticut River Valley sat at the bottom of Lake Hitchcock. Its lush greenery and rich, almost rockless soil comes from the ancient lake&#x27;s sedimentary deposits. In the Middle Connecticut region, the river reaches its maximum depth – – at Gill, Massachusetts, around the French King Bridge, and its maximum width – – at Longmeadow, directly across from the Six Flags New England amusement park. The Connecticut&#x27;s largest falls – South Hadley Falls – features a vertical drop of . Lush green forests and agricultural hamlets dot this middle portion of the Connecticut River; however, the region is best known for its numerous college towns, such as Northampton, South Hadley, and Amherst, as well as the river&#x27;s most populous city, Springfield. The city sits atop bluffs beside the Connecticut&#x27;s confluence with two major tributaries, the Chicopee River to the east and Westfield River to the west. The region around the Connecticut River is known locally as the Pioneer Valley, and the name adorns many local civic organizations and local businesses. While the southern part of the valley in Massachusetts is heavily urbanized, the northern section is largely rural and the local agriculture is well known for Connecticut shade tobacco.

The Connecticut River is influenced by the tides as far north as Enfield Rapids in Windsor Locks, Connecticut, approximately north of the river&#x27;s mouth. Two million residents live in the densely populated Hartford-Springfield region, which stretches roughly between the college towns of Amherst, Massachusetts, and Middletown, Connecticut. Hartford, the second-largest city and the only state capital on the river, is at the southern end of this region on an ancient floodplain that stretches to Middletown.

===The Lower Connecticut River: Southern Connecticut to Long Island Sound===
 south of Hartford, at Middletown, the Lower Connecticut River section begins with a narrowing of the river, and then a sharp turn southeast. Throughout southern Connecticut, the Connecticut passes through a thinly populated, hilly, wooded region before again widening and discharging into Long Island Sound between Old Saybrook and Old Lyme in flat coastal marshlands. Due to the presence of large, shifting sandbars at its mouth, the Connecticut is the only major river in the Northeastern United States without a port at its mouth. 

====Mouth and tidelands====
The Connecticut River carries a heavy amount of silt from as far north as Quebec, especially during the spring snow melt. This results in a large sandbar near the river&#x27;s mouth which is a formidable obstacle to navigation. The Connecticut is one of the few major rivers in the United States without a major city at its mouth because of this obstacle. Major cities on the Connecticut River are Hartford and Springfield, which lie upriver respectively.

The Nature Conservancy named the Connecticut River&#x27;s tidelands one of the Western Hemisphere&#x27;s &quot;40 Last Great Places&quot;, while the Ramsar Convention on Wetlands listed its estuary and tidal wetlands as one of 1,759 wetlands of international importance. In 1997, the Connecticut River was designated one of only 14 American Heritage Rivers, which recognized its &quot;distinctive natural, economic, agricultural, scenic, historic, cultural, and recreational qualities.&quot; In May 2012, the Connecticut River was designated America&#x27;s first National Blueway in recognition of the restoration and preservation efforts on the river.

===Dams===
The Connecticut River&#x27;s flow is slowed by main stem dams, which create a series of slow-flowing basins from Lake Francis Dam in Pittsburg, New Hampshire, to the Holyoke Dam at South Hadley Falls in Massachusetts. Among the most extensively dammed rivers in the United States, the Connecticut may soon flow at a more natural pace, according to scientists at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, who have devised a computer that – &quot;in an effort to balance human and natural needs&quot; – coordinates the holding and releasing of water between the river&#x27;s 54 largest dams. The Cabot and Turners Falls hydroelectric stations generate up to 68 MW. The Holyoke Canal System and Hadley Falls Station at Holyoke Dam are rated a combined 48 MW.

===Tributaries===
The Connecticut River watershed encompasses , connecting 148 tributaries, including 38 major rivers and numerous lakes and ponds. Major tributaries include (from north to south) the Passumpsic, Ammonoosuc, White, Black, West, Ashuelot, Millers, Deerfield, Chicopee, Westfield, and Farmington rivers. The Swift River, a tributary of the Chicopee, has been dammed and largely replaced by the Quabbin Reservoir which provides water to the Massachusetts Water Resources Authority district in eastern Massachusetts, including Boston and its metropolitan area.

==Ecology==
Along its southern reaches, the Connecticut River has carved a wide, fertile floodplain valley (known in Massachusetts as the Pioneer Valley), depositing rich silt and loam soils known internationally for their agricultural merit. Abundant riparian hardwood species include sycamores, cottonwood, basswood, willows, sassafras, box elder, black elder, osier dogwood and more. The river itself and its many tributaries are home to many typical New England freshwater species. These include dace, crawfish, hellgramites, freshwater mussels, typical frog species, snapping turtles, brook trout, freshwater sturgeon, catfish, walleye, chain pickerel and carp. Introduced species include stocked rainbow trout. The river is an important conduit of many anadromous fish, such as American shad, lamprey, and Atlantic salmon. American eels are also present, as are predators of these migratory fish including striped bass. Shad run as far north as Holyoke, Massachusetts where they are lifted over the Holyoke Dam by a fish elevator. This station publishes annual statistics of the run, and has recorded an occasional salmon. They pass an additional elevator in Turners Falls, Massachusetts, and make it at least as far as Bellows Falls, Vermont. Harbor seals have been recorded traveling upriver as far north as Holyoke in pursuit of migratory fish; it is possible that they ranged farther upstream before the dam was built. In the southernmost portions in southern Connecticut near Long Island Sound, dolphins are spotted on occasion.

There are 12 species of freshwater mussels. Eleven of them occur in the mainstem of the Connecticut; the brook floater is found only in small streams and rivers. Species diversity is higher in the southern part of the watershed (Connecticut and Massachusetts) than in the northern part (Vermont and New Hampshire), largely due to differences in stream gradient and substrate. Eight of the 12 species in the watershed are listed as endangered, threatened, or of special concern in one or more of the states in the watershed.

A number of colonial animal species make their home in the waters of the Connecticut. Deeper areas are habitat for a diversity of colonial organisms including bryozoa. Freshwater sponges the size of dinner plates have been found by scuba divers at depths of more than , thought to be the deepest location of the river, around the French King Bridge in Erving, Massachusetts. Mussels, eels, and northern pike were also observed there.

===Fish===
There are several species of anadromous and catadromous fish, including brook trout, winter flounder, blueback herring, alewife, rainbow trout, large brown trout, American shad (&quot;Alosa sapidissima&quot;), hickory shad, smallmouth bass, Atlantic sturgeon, striped bass (&quot;Morone saxatilis&quot;), American eel, sea lamprey, and endangered shortnose sturgeon and dwarf wedgemussels. Additionally, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service has repopulated the river with another species of migratory fish, the Atlantic salmon, which for more than 200 years had been extinct from the river due to damming. Several fish ladders and fish elevators have been built to allow fish to resume their natural migration upriver each spring.

Fresh and brackish water residents of the main branch and tributaries include common carp, white catfish, brown bullhead, fallfish, yellow perch, smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, northern pike, chain pickerel, bluegill, pumpkinseed sunfish, golden shiner, and rock bass.

Much of the beginning of the river&#x27;s course in the town of Pittsburg is occupied by the Connecticut Lakes, which contain lake trout and landlocked salmon. Landlocked salmon make their way into the river during spring spawning runs of bait fish and during their fall spawn. The river has fly-fishing-only regulations on of river. Most of the river from Lake Francis south is open to lure and bait as well. Two tail-water dams provide cold river water for miles downstream, making for bountiful summer fishing on the Connecticut.

After the first major dam was built near Turners Falls, Massachusetts, thirteen additional dams have ended the Connecticut River&#x27;s great anadromous fish runs. Salmon restoration efforts began in 1967, and fish ladders at a fish elevator at Hadley Falls have since enabled migrating fish to return to some of their former spawning grounds. In addition to dams, warm water discharges between 1978 and 1992 from Vermont Yankee Nuclear Power Plant in Vernon, Vermont released water up to degrees, with the thermal plume reaching downstream as far as Holyoke. This thermal pollution appears to be associated with an 80% decline in American shad fish numbers from 1992 to 2005 at Holyoke Dam. This decline may have been exacerbated by over-fishing in the mid-Atlantic and predation from resurging striped bass populations. The nuclear plant was closed at the end of 2014, after which the shad population has increased.

==Economy==
===Boating===
The mouth of the river up to Essex is thought to be one of the busiest stretches of waterway in Connecticut. Some local police departments and the state Environmental Conservation Police patrol the area a few times a week. Some towns keep boats available if needed. In Massachusetts, the most active stretch of the Connecticut River is centered on the Oxbow, north of Springfield in the college town of Northampton.

Camping is available along much of the river, for non-motorized boats, via the Connecticut River Paddlers&#x27; Trail. The Paddlers&#x27; Trail currently includes campsites on over of the river.

===Pollution and cleanup===
The Water Quality Act of 1965 had a major impact on controlling water pollution in the Connecticut River and its tributaries.

Since then, the river has been restored from Class D to Class B (fishable and swimmable). Many towns along the Lower Connecticut River have enacted a cap on further development along the banks, so that no buildings may be constructed except on existing foundations. Currently, a website provides water quality reports twice a week, indicating whether various portions of the river are safe for swimming, boating and fishing.

=== Crossings ===
The Connecticut River is a barrier to travel between western and eastern New England. Several major transportation corridors cross the river including Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor, Interstate 95 (Connecticut Turnpike), Interstate 90 (Massachusetts Turnpike), Interstate 89, Interstate 93, and Interstate 84. In addition, Interstate 91, whose route largely follows the river, crosses it twice – once in Connecticut and once in Massachusetts.

=== In literature ===
Lydia Sigourney&#x27;s poem was first published in her 1834 poetry collection. A later poem, , was published in 1845, together with a description of a journey along the river.

Wallace Stevens, one of America&#x27;s most important 20th century poets, lived in Hartford, Connecticut, where he was vice-president of the Hartford Insurance Co. He composed many of his poems, including &quot;The River of Rivers in Connecticut&quot;, on his 2.4 mile daily walk to and from his office.

<text>James Richard Steinman (November 1, 1947 – April 19, 2021) was an American composer, lyricist and record producer. He also worked as an arranger, pianist, and singer. His work included songs in the adult contemporary, rock, dance, pop, musical theater, and film score genres. He wrote songs for Bonnie Tyler and Meat Loaf, including &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; (one of the best-selling albums in history), and also wrote and produced &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot; and Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot;. 

His most successful chart singles include Tyler&#x27;s &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, Air Supply&#x27;s &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything for Love (But I Won&#x27;t Do That)&quot;, the Sisters of Mercy&#x27;s &quot;This Corrosion&quot; and &quot;More&quot;, Barry Manilow&#x27;s &quot;Read &#x27;Em and Weep&quot;, Take That&#x27;s &quot;Never Forget&quot;, Celine Dion&#x27;s cover of &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; (originally released by Steinman&#x27;s project Pandora&#x27;s Box) and Boyzone&#x27;s &quot;No Matter What&quot;. Steinman&#x27;s only solo album, &quot;Bad for Good&quot;, was released in 1981.

Steinman&#x27;s work also extended to musical theater, where he began his career. He was credited with the book, music, and lyrics for &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot;, lyrics for &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, and music for &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot;.

==Early life==
Steinman was born November 1, 1947, in Hewlett Harbor, New York, the son of Eleanor, a teacher of Latin, and Louis Steinman, who owned a steel distribution warehouse. He was of Jewish ancestry.

Steinman graduated from George W. Hewlett High School in 1965. In 1963, during his sophomore year at Hewlett High School, Steinman won &quot;Newsday&quot;″s January essay contest on American History for his essay on what he believed were the three greatest American inventions. Steinman received his bachelor&#x27;s degree from Amherst College in 1969.

==Career==

===1960s===
In March 1968, Steinman contributed music for an Amherst College adaptation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;A Man&#x27;s a Man&quot;. In May 1968, he directed an Amherst production of Michael McClure&#x27;s &quot;The Beard&quot;. Over the summer of 1968, he contributed music for an adaptation of Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Baal&quot; by the Island Theater Workshop on Martha&#x27;s Vineyard.

As a senior at Amherst College in Massachusetts, Steinman wrote the book, music and lyrics for &quot;The Dream Engine&quot; (April 1969), a musical that was used to fulfil the requirements for an independent study course in his senior year. Steinman himself played Baal while an audition call went out to fellow students for the remaining roles of the production. Barry Keating (serving as the co-creator and director) also played the role of the Historian/Narrator and worked extensively with Jim to compile the book for the production, often shouting lines from the audience and sourcing heavily from their earlier work with Brechtian form and tropes. The play was presented at the Amherst campus&#x27;s &quot;Kirby Theater&quot; in April 1969 and transferred to nearby Holyoke for a small handful of performances, infamously drawing the attention of local authorities for its ensemble-wide display of nudity in the finale (an element that was begrudgingly muted for the off-campus performances).

&quot;The Dream Engine&quot;, set in a satirical-dystopian 1969, is the story of a young boy named Baal who, along with his rebel fellows, doesn&#x27;t accept the restraints and limits of their society. Baal is the leader of a self-assembled group of wild boys called The Tribe, whose mortal enemies are Max and Emily, the parents of the Girl, a young woman with whom Baal has fallen in love.

Several motifs, lyrics, and monologues from this show appear in songs Steinman later released. For example, the lyrics &quot;turn around bright eyes&quot; from &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; can be heard in the song titled &quot;The Formation of the Tribe&quot;. This was originally a reference to the blast flash of nuclear explosions, and the full riff of the original Dream Engine composition can be heard in the musical break of the Bonnie Tyler recording, including symbolic musical &quot;blasts&quot; to punctuate each phrase. Multiple esoteric references to &quot;silver&quot; and &quot;gold&quot; also occur first, throughout the book, and appear in numerous later Steinman works, and the full monologue that was later recorded to open &quot;You Took The Words Right Out Of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)&quot; is delivered in a love scene between Baal and The Girl.

Steinman said in an interview that Joseph Papp, founder of the New York Shakespeare Festival, saw the play and was so impressed he signed it up during intermission. He wanted to bring it to New York (either Broadway or Central Park), but balked when his Amherst faculty advisor explained to Papp that, contrary to Papp&#x27;s published claim, Steinman was never threatened with &quot;near-expulsion&quot; from the college. Nonetheless, Steinman worked under Papp after his years at Amherst College.

===1970s===
In 1971, Steinman provided music for a puppet show titled &quot;Ubu&quot;. The show, put on by puppeteer and filmmaker Demian, was an adaptation of &quot;Ubu on the Hill&quot;, an 1888 play by Alfred Jarry.

In 1972, Steinman worked with college friend Barry Keating on a musical titled &quot;Rhinegold&quot; at the Mercer Arts Center, based on Richard Wagner&#x27;s opera &quot;Das Rheingold&quot;. Steinman wrote the music and Keating wrote the lyrics.

In 1972, Bette Midler sang a demo of the Steinman song &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;. Midler&#x27;s career was at an early stage at the time; she went on to far greater fame, making that demo a collector&#x27;s item. The demo has been in circulation among fans on the internet.

In 1973, Steinman&#x27;s song &quot;Happy Ending&quot; appeared on the album &quot;Food of Love&quot;, sung by Yvonne Elliman. This was the first commercially released recording of a song written by Steinman. That same year, Steinman wrote music and lyrics for a musical titled &quot;More Than You Deserve&quot; (1973). One of the actors cast in this show was Marvin Lee Aday, who went by the name Meat Loaf, with whom Steinman later collaborated.

In 1973, a single of the song &quot;More Than You Deserve&quot;, from the musical sharing that name, was released. Reid Whitelaw was producer. Norman Bergen was arranger. Meat Loaf was the lead singer. A cover of this single also appears on the 1981 album &quot;Dead Ringer&quot;.

In 1975, while working for Joseph Papp at the New York Shakespeare Festival, Steinman contributed music and lyrics to Thomas Babe&#x27;s &quot;Kid Champion&quot;, which starred Christopher Walken.

In 1976, there was a minor one-month run of a musical titled &quot;The Confidence Man&quot;. It was based loosely on the novel by the same title by Herman Melville. The book and lyrics were written by Ray Errol Fox, the music by Steinman. Ray Fox described the 1976 production as &quot;a capsule version of the show&quot;. In 1986, a more elaborate production of the show with added songs was held at Queens College in New York City. It was directed by Susan Einhorn and performed by Queen&#x27;s College students. Orchestrations were by Steven Margoshes, a frequent Steinman collaborator. One song from &quot;The Confidence Man&quot;, &quot;Milady&quot;, was recorded by Barry Manilow, but never released. The melody of that song later appeared in &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; as the melody of &quot;Für Sarah&quot; (for Sarah). Some music from this show later appeared in the hit song &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, and in the score of the film &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot;. A cast album of the songs from &quot;The Confidence Man&quot;, produced by Jeff Olmstead, was released in 2003. A cabaret show featuring songs from &quot;The Confidence Man&quot; was presented in 1977 at the Manhattan Theatre Club, where Steinman had previously written music for another cabaret show titled &quot;Bloodshot Wine&quot;.

Since 1974, Steinman had been working on a musical entitled &quot;Neverland&quot; (its only performances were during a 1977 workshop at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington DC ). Adapted largely from the Steinman/Keating source material developed for the Dream Engine, it also loosely sourced material from &quot;Peter Pan&quot; by J.M. Barrie. Steinman and Meat Loaf, who were touring with &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot;, felt that three songs were &quot;exceptional&quot; and Steinman began to develop them as part of a seven-song set they wanted to record as an album. The three songs were &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;The Formation of the Pack&quot;, which was retitled &quot;All Revved Up With No Place to Go&quot;. The show also contained Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Bolero&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Great Bolero&#x27;s of Fire&quot;) which was later used at many live shows featuring Steinman work. Jim Steinman originally wanted Kim Milford to sing the album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, but later changed his mind.

Steinman and Meat Loaf had immense difficulty finding a record company willing to sign them. According to Meat Loaf&#x27;s autobiography, the band spent most of 1975, and two-and-a-half years, auditioning &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; and being rejected. CBS executive Clive Davis even claimed that Steinman knew nothing about writing, or rock music in general. Recording started in 1976 in Bearsville, near Woodstock. After numerous further rejections, the album was released by Cleveland International Records in October 1977. The album was an immediate success in Australia and the United Kingdom, and later in the United States. Reports vary as to how many copies of the album have been sold, but in 2007, Cleveland International Records founder Steve Popovich said that it was around 40 million copies. The highest-charting song from the album was &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot;, which reached No. 11 on the Billboard Charts.

In 1979, the Freeway Records label made a 2-LP compilation album titled &quot;L.A. Radio&quot;. It was not commercially released, but promo copies were distributed. It included a spoken word segment titled &quot;Shadows on the Freeway&quot;, written and recited by Steinman. It later appeared on the 1981 album &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; with a new title, &quot;Nocturnal Pleasure&quot;. Parts of it can also be heard at the beginning of the 1989 music video, directed by Ken Russell, for the first release of the song &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;.

Steinman wrote the theme music for the 1979 National Lampoon sitcom &quot;Delta House&quot;. Sean Kelly and Tony Hendra wrote the lyrics. Michael Simmons sang the lead vocal. The music from this later appeared on the song &quot;Dead Ringer for Love&quot;.

===1980s===
In 1980, the film &quot;A Small Circle of Friends&quot; was released. It had an orchestral score composed by Steinman, and orchestrated by his frequent collaborator Steve Margoshes. The motifs of this orchestral score match the melodies of numerous songs Steinman later released, including &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot; and &quot;Für Sarah&quot; from &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot;.

Early in the production of a follow-up album to &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, Meat Loaf developed vocal problems and was unable to continue on the project. Steinman proceeded with the album, released as &quot;Bad for Good&quot; in 1981. Most songs are sung by Steinman himself. Three of the songs are sung by Rory Dodd, who did not receive a clear indication for his work in the album&#x27;s credits, and Karla DeVito sings a duet part on one song. Steinman was this time credited as co-producer with Todd Rundgren for all but one track. Steinman was credited as co-producer with Jimmy Iovine for the song &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot;.

Meat Loaf again recorded songs by Steinman on the album &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; (1981). All of the songs on the album were written by Steinman. One of the songs, &quot;More Than You Deserve&quot;, was previously released. Stephan Galfas was the primary producer for this album. Steinman&#x27;s role in this album was less than his role in &quot;Bad for Good&quot;. The highest-charting song on this album was &quot;Dead Ringer for Love&quot;, a duet with Cher, and the album reached No. 1 on the album charts in the United Kingdom.

Steinman is credited as music producer of every selection on Bonnie Tyler&#x27;s album &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot; (1983). Steinman also wrote and composed two of the songs on the album: &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; and &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot;, the album&#x27;s title selection. For a period in 1983, two songs written and produced by Steinman held the top two positions on the Billboard singles chart, with &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; at number one, and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, performed by Air Supply, at number two. The second of those appeared on Air Supply&#x27;s 1983 compilation albums &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; and &quot;Making Love... The Very Best of Air Supply&quot;. On the inner cover of the album, Steinman is also credited with being the &quot;seductive female voice&quot; speaking the words &quot;I&#x27;d do anything for love, but I won&#x27;t do that&quot; on the song &quot;Getting so Excited&quot;, the same words that would later become the title of a hit single Steinman wrote for Meat Loaf which was released ten years later.

Barry Manilow&#x27;s compilation album &quot;Greatest Hits Vol. II&quot; (1983) included the song &quot;Read &#x27;Em and Weep&quot;, written, composed, and produced by Steinman. It had appeared on Meat Loaf&#x27;s &quot;Dead Ringer&quot; album in 1981, but with a slightly different lyric. The song stayed at No. 1 on the Adult Contemporary Chart for eight consecutive weeks.

In 1983, Ian Hunter released his album &quot;All of the Good Ones Are Taken&quot;. On the title selection, &quot;All of the Good Ones Are Taken&quot;, Steinman is credited with &quot;assistance&quot;. Rory Dodd and Eric Troyer, two singers who often sang on Steinman&#x27;s studio work, were credited with &quot;additional background vocals&quot;.

In 1984, the film &quot;Streets of Fire&quot; was released. The soundtrack included two songs written, composed, and produced by Steinman. They are &quot;Tonight Is What It Means to Be Young&quot; and &quot;Nowhere Fast&quot;. The performance of these two songs is credited to &quot;Fire Incorporated&quot;, which was a reference to an assembly of studio musicians and singers hired for these two songs. The voices heard on these songs include those of Rory Dodd, Holly Sherwood, and Laurie Sargent.

Steinman is credited for producing all the selections on Billy Squier&#x27;s album &quot;Signs of Life&quot; (1984), and Barbra Streisand&#x27;s album of the same year, &quot;Emotion&quot;, featured &quot;Left in the Dark&quot;, which Steinman wrote, composed and produced. The song had previously appeared on &quot;Bad for Good&quot;.

The soundtrack for the 1984 film &quot;Footloose&quot; included the song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, performed by Bonnie Tyler. Steinman produced the selection and is credited with composing the music, and Dean Pitchford, who had written the film itself directly for the screen, for writing the lyrics. The song was a hit single, the soundtrack album was successful, and the film was successful. Some of the music from this song was adapted from the music used for the song &quot;Stark Raving Love&quot; from the album &quot;Bad for Good&quot;.

In 1984, Steinman was hired by, and worked briefly with, rock band Def Leppard on some tracks that were intended for a Def Leppard album. However, Steinman was fired, and the recording work he made with the band was not released. The next album Def Leppard released after this, &quot;Hysteria&quot;, was produced by Robert John &quot;Mutt&quot; Lange.

Jim Steinman wrote a song titled &quot;Vaults of Heaven&quot; which has the same melody as &quot;Milady&quot; from &quot;The Confidence Man&quot; and &quot;Für Sarah&quot; from &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot;. Rory Dodd sang a demo of this &quot;Vaults of Heaven&quot; in 1984. That demo has been in circulation among fans on the internet.

In 1985, Steinman wrote, composed, and produced a theme song for WWF performer Hulk Hogan. It was released in 1985 on an album titled &quot;The Wrestling Album&quot;. The selection was recorded during the recording sessions for &quot;Secret Dreams And Forbidden Fire,&quot; an album that Bonnie Tyler was then recording, and which Steinman also produced. The selection has no lead vocals, and it matches much of the non-vocal parts of the track of &quot;Ravishing&quot; that appeared on &quot;Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire&quot;. The track was also heard as the theme music on the animated television show &quot;Hulk Hogan&#x27;s Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Wrestling&quot;. Steinman produced the track &quot;Love Can Make You Cry&quot;, written by Michael Kehr, Don Kehr and Ian Hunter, for the soundtrack album for the 1986 film &quot;Iron Eagle.&quot; This was a modified version of the original recording of the same song, which had appeared on Urgent&#x27;s 1985 album &quot;Cast The First Stone&quot;. The original recording had been produced by Ian Hunter and Mick Ronson.

According to Steinman in an interview, Andrew Lloyd Webber approached him to write lyrics for &quot;The Phantom of the Opera&quot; because Lloyd Webber felt that his &quot;dark obsessive side&quot; fit in with the project. However, Steinman declined in order to fulfill his commitments to a Bonnie Tyler album. In 1986, the album &quot;Secret Dreams and Forbidden Fire&quot; was released. Bonnie Tyler sang lead vocals, and Steinman produced all the selections on the album. Four of the songs on the album were written and/or composed by Steinman. One, &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, was the same track from the &quot;Footloose&quot; soundtrack. The other three were &quot;Ravishing&quot;, &quot;Rebel Without a Clue&quot; and &quot;Loving You&#x27;s a Dirty Job but Somebody&#x27;s Gotta Do It&quot;, a duet with Todd Rundgren. This album was the first time Steinman worked with Steven Rinkoff, who was a recording engineer on this album. Since this album, the two have been co-producers and regular professional partners on Steinman&#x27;s work.. The Jim Steinman directed video for &quot;If You Were A Woman And I Was A Man&quot; was nominated for six Billboard Video Awards.

In 1987, the Sisters of Mercy released their second album &quot;Floodland&quot;. The track &quot;This Corrosion&quot; was produced by Steinman, and the track &quot;Dominion/Mother Russia&quot; was co-produced by Steinman, along with Larry Alexander and Andrew Eldritch. The soundtrack album for the 1989 film &quot;Rude Awakening&quot; included two tracks produced by Steinman. One was the song &quot;Rude Awakening&quot;, with lead vocals by Bill Medley and was written by Rick Rose and Paul Rothchild. The other, &quot;Darling Be Home Soon&quot;, which featured lead vocals by Phoebe Snow, had been written, composed and originated by John Sebastian.

In 1989, the album &quot;Original Sin&quot; was released. The album artist name is Pandora&#x27;s Box. Pandora&#x27;s Box referred to a group assembled by Steinman, including, officially, four female singers and Steinman himself. The official four female singers were Ellen Foley, Elaine Caswell, Gina Taylor and Deliria Wilde (with Holly Sherwood doing lead vocals on &quot;Good Girls Go to Heaven&quot;). Gina Taylor, who is now better known as Gina Taylor-Pickens, was previously in the group Musique, including the 1978 hit single &quot;In The Bush&quot;. In interview, Elaine Caswell said Pandora&#x27;s Box was &quot;four women; three that existed and [...] Deliria Wilde who was somewhat mythical, someone [Steinman] kind of created&quot;. Deliria Wilde might have been a pseudonym for Holly Sherwood. Sales in Europe were low. The album was successful and reached No. 1 on the album charts in South Africa. It was not released at all in North America. Years later, it was reissued and became available internationally on compact disc. &quot;Original Sin&quot; included the original recording of &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, sung by Elaine Caswell. Two songs from this album &quot;It Just Won&#x27;t Quit&quot; and &quot;Good Girls Go to Heaven (Bad Girls Go Everywhere)&quot; were re-recorded and released on &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;.

In the late 1980s, Jim Steinman was working on an adaptation of the 1974 movie &quot;Phantom of the Paradise&quot; by writer and director Brian De Palma. Steinman made demos for this project. His demos include Rory Dodd singing &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, with an extra verse not heard in the Air Supply recording, and include a 1980s recording of &quot;Who Needs the Young?&quot;

In the late 1980s, Jim Steinman was preparing to produce an album for ELO Part II, a spin-off of the group Electric Light Orchestra. Steinman made a demo of Rory Dodd singing the song Kiss Me Red by Billy Steinberg and Tom Kelly. ELO Part II released their album &quot;Electric Light Orchestra Part Two&quot; in 1990, without Steinman producing. Eric Troyer, a frequent background vocalist on Steinman productions, sang the lead vocal on ELO Part II&#x27;s released recording of &quot;Kiss Me Red&quot;.

===1990s===
With Andrew Eldritch, Steinman co-wrote and co-produced the track &quot;More&quot; for the album &quot;Vision Thing&quot; (1990) by the group the Sisters of Mercy.

Around 1992, Steinman worked with the punk band Iron Prostate, which featured guitarist and writer George Tabb. The group reportedly dissolved while working with Steinman on what was to be their second album. Tabb&#x27;s website has shared a recording of the song &quot;Bring Me The Head of Jerry Garcia&quot;, with Steinman credited as executive producer. The song&#x27;s lyric says of Jerry Garcia, &quot;he plays guitar like diarrhea&quot;.

After a series of financial and legal disputes during the 1980s, Steinman and Meat Loaf met at the singer&#x27;s house in Connecticut at Christmas 1989 or 1990 and sang &quot;Bat out of Hell&quot; on piano. Steinman says that &quot;working together again seemed like the cool thing to do.&quot;

In 1993, the album &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot; was released. Steinman wrote all the songs, and was credited as producer and arranger. Steven Rinkoff was, as usual, credited as co-producer, and others received co-producer credits. The album was successful, reaching the peak position on album charts in many countries. The album had three top 40 singles, with &quot;I&#x27;d Do Anything for Love (But I Won&#x27;t Do That)&quot; reaching the peak position on pop singles charts in 28 countries. The other top 40 singles from this album were &quot;Rock and Roll Dreams Come Through&quot; and &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot;.

&quot;Original Sin&quot;, the eponymous song on the 1989 Pandora&#x27;s Box album, featured on the soundtrack album for the film &quot;The Shadow&quot; (1994). The lyric on this release was slightly different from that heard on the original release of this song. Steinman also produced this version, with lead vocals by Taylor Dayne.

In 1995, the band Watershed released the album &quot;Twister&quot;. Steinman was executive producer for the album, and Steinman&#x27;s partner Steven Rinkoff was producer for all but one track of it. The album consisted of songs written by the band members.

In 1995, Bonnie Tyler released the album &quot;Free Spirit&quot;, featuring two tracks produced and written by Steinman. They were dance versions of the past hits &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; and &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;.

Steinman, along with Brothers in Rhythm and David James, with Steven Rinkoff as associate producer and engineer, co-produced the song &quot;Never Forget&quot;. It was written by Gary Barlow, for the British group Take That. It was released on the album &quot;Nobody Else&quot; (1995) and reached the No. 1 position on the UK singles chart. Like many Steinman/Rinkoff productions, it featured programming and keyboard work by Jeff Bova.

Celine Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Falling into You&quot; (1996) included the song &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, written and produced by Steinman. He also produced, but not authored, two other songs on the album: &quot;River Deep, Mountain High&quot; and &quot;Call the Man&quot;. &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot; reached No. 2 on the Billboard charts and won Steinman the award for BMI song of the year. That award is given for the song, out of all those represented in the BMI catalog, that receives the most radio airplay in a particular year. This album as a whole won two 1997 Grammy Awards, for Best Pop Album and for Album of the Year. Steinman also produced the track &quot;Us&quot;, written by Billy Pace, for Dion&#x27;s album &quot;Let&#x27;s Talk About Love&quot; (1997). Steinman&#x27;s production team prepared a recording of the Steinman/Black song &quot;Is Nothing Sacred&quot; for that album, but it was removed shortly before the album&#x27;s release. A recording of Dion singing the song was leaked and has been shared on fan websites.

Steinman produced two tracks for films in the late 1990s. He produced &quot;In the Dark of the Night&quot;, written by Stephen Flaherty and Lynn Ahrens, for the soundtrack album of the film &quot;Anastasia&quot; (1997). He also produced &quot;I Want to Spend My Lifetime Loving You&quot; (music by James Horner, lyric by Will Jennings) for the film &quot;The Mask of Zorro&quot; (1998). Lead vocals were a duet between Tina Arena and Marc Anthony, and the track also appeared on Tina Arena&#x27;s album &quot;In Deep&quot; (1997).

No later than 1996, Steinman worked on a movie musical titled &quot;Bat Out of Hell 2100&quot;. This was a predecessor to &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot;, and it built upon the storyline of Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Neverland&quot; musical from the 1970s. This movie was not made. A script for &quot;Bat Out of Hell 2100&quot; was leaked, and has been available among fans on the internet. Steinman also made demos for &quot;Bat Out of Hell 2100&quot;. Those include Kyle Gordon a.k.a. Scarpia singing &quot;All Revved Up With No Place To Go&quot; with an alternate lyric, Ellen Foley singing a song titled &quot;City Night&quot;, and Marcus Lovett singing &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;. &quot;City Night&quot; incorporates material from &quot;Come With Me&quot; from &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; and &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;, which uses the melody from &quot;New Orleans is Comin&#x27; To Me&quot; from &quot;The Confidence Man&quot; and &quot;The Future Ain&#x27;t What It Used To Be&quot;. Recordings of all three of those demos have been leaked and circulated among fans on the internet.

Steinman provided lyrics for Andrew Lloyd Webber&#x27;s musical &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, which opened in Washington, D.C. in December 1996. However, it received poor reviews and the Broadway run, scheduled for the following April, was cancelled. A reworked and more successful West End production opened at the Aldwych Theatre on July 1, 1998. In addition to a full-length cast album for the London production, an album was released of well-known performers singing pop versions of the songs from the show. This album was produced by Steinman, as usual with Steven Rinkoff. Those performers include Tom Jones, Tina Arena, Boyzone, Elaine Paige, Donny Osmond, The Everly Brothers, Meat Loaf, Boy George, Sounds of Blackness, Bonnie Tyler, Michael Ball, and Lottie Mayor. One track, &quot;No Matter What&quot; performed by Boyzone, reached the peak position on the pop charts in many countries. The same track appeared on a Boyzone album and their greatest hits album. As of 2019, Boyzone&#x27;s 1998 recording of &quot;No Matter What&quot; is the most recent new song or project written at least in part by Steinman, or to contain any new work of his at all, to achieve major, chart-topping success. The track &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;, performed by Tina Arena, from the same album, also had some chart success. There was also a single released in the UK for charity, of children from Red Hill Primary School and Sylvia Young Theatre School performing &quot;When Children Rule The World&quot;. The singers were named the Red Hill Children, and the single peaked at No. 40 on the UK singles chart.

&quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; (&quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;), opened in Vienna, Austria on October 4, 1997. The show was adapted from Roman Polanski&#x27;s movie &quot;The Fearless Vampire Killers&quot; (1967), and initially directed by Polanski himself. It won six International musical awards, at the International Musical Award Germany (IMAGE 1998), in Düsseldorf. There have been translated productions of &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; in Estonia, Poland, Finland, Hungary and Japan. Many of the various productions of &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot; have had cast recordings released, some of them produced by Steinman, along with other co-producers. Like much of Steinman&#x27;s work, the show includes adaptation (or, recycling) of material Steinman had released before. This includes the song &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, the melody of &quot;Objects in the Rear View Mirror May Appear Closer than They Are&quot;, and many other parts of earlier works.

Ten previously released Steinman songs were included on the 2-disc compilation album &quot;The Very Best of Meat Loaf&quot; (1998). The included recording of the song &quot;Life Is a Lemon and I Want My Money Back&quot; was a new remix made by Steinman&#x27;s production team. The compilation also included three new recordings of songs co-written by Steinman, all three of which he produced. They include the hybrid track &quot;Home By Now/No Matter What&quot; and &quot;A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste&quot; from &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;. Also included is the song &quot;Is Nothing Sacred&quot;, on which Steinman wrote music for Don Black&#x27;s lyrics.

===2000s===
In 2000, South African singer Jennifer Jones sang at the World Aids Day concert. Jones performed &quot;The Future Ain&#x27;t What It Used To Be&quot;. The World Aids Day concert was broadcast worldwide. For many people around the world, this was the first or only time they ever heard that song.

In 2001, the box set &quot;Andrew Lloyd Webber: Now &amp; Forever&quot; was released. It included a recording, produced by Steinman and Andrew Lloyd Webber, and also co-produced by Steven Rinkoff and Nigel Wright, of the Steinman/Webber song &quot;A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste&quot;, from &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;. It was credited to The Metal Philharmonic Orchestra, which was an unrealized performance project idea. Kyle Gordon, a.k.a. &quot;Scarpia&quot;, a singer on many demo recordings for Steinman, sang the lead vocal.

Around 2001, Steinman was working with singer Karine Hannah. Plans to make an album with her were eventually abandoned. Demo recordings of Hannah singing four songs by Steinman were leaked to fans and have since been available on numerous fan sites. The songs on these demos are &quot;Safe Sex&quot;, &quot;Making Love Out of Nothing at All&quot;, &quot;Is Nothing Sacred&quot; and &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot;. Steinman also recorded her voice on a demo of &quot;Catwoman&#x27;s Song&quot;, which recycled parts of the Steinman/Eldritch song &quot;More&quot;. This demo was part of Steinman&#x27;s preparations for the unrealized &quot;Batman: The Musical&quot;. He shared it with fans through a website. In 2002, Russell Watson released the album &quot;Encore&quot;. It included the Steinman/Black song &quot;Is Nothing Sacred&quot;. Steinman had originally worked on his production of this song with Watson on lead vocals.

Composed by Michael Reed and Steinman, with a script by Warner Brown, &quot;Garbo – the Musical&quot;, about the life of the late screen idol Greta Garbo, opened in Sweden to poor reviews in 2002. Preparation for a stage musical based on the Batman comic book series began early in the decade, with Steinman working on the music and lyrics. In August 2002, the &quot;New York Post&quot; reported that Warner Bros. signed Tim Burton to direct. According to an unnamed source Burton was attracted to the project because it was as dark as his 1989 film &quot;Batman&quot; rather than &quot;the goofy, campy turn the franchise took with &quot;Batman Forever&quot; and &quot;Batman and Robin&quot;, both of which were directed by Joel Schumacher.&quot; Steinman said about Burton and the project, &quot;It&#x27;s more like his first two movies than any of the other movies. It&#x27;s very dark and gothic, but really wildly funny. It was my dream that he do this.&quot; However, Warner Bros. cancelled its plans to cast and stage the show. Steinman has since shared some of the song demos from the show via the Dream Pollution website. The Dream Engine has, according to its website and MySpace page, also worked on recordings of some of the songs that were in the show. That includes the songs &quot;We&#x27;re Still The Children We Were Then&quot; and &quot;Not Allowed To Love&quot;.

Steinman was executive producer for the 2003 MTV television film &quot;Wuthering Heights&quot;. He has cited Emily Brontë&#x27;s novel, which had inspired &quot;It&#x27;s All Coming Back to Me Now&quot;, as one of his favorites. A limited-release six-track soundtrack CD was sold through MTV, on Steinman and Rinkoff&#x27;s Ravenous Records label. Jim Steinman is credited as producer for the album and most of its tracks, and Steven Rinkoff is credited with recording, mixing and co-production. That album includes a simple recording of the Steinman/Eldritch song &quot;More&quot; with actors Mike Vogel and Erika Christensen performing lead vocals. It also includes the first-ever release of the song &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Broke (Break It)&quot;, written by Steinman, with lead vocals by Mike Vogel. The album also has a version of &quot;The Future Ain&#x27;t What It Used to Be&quot; by Jim Steinman with lead vocals from Erika Christensen.

In 2002, the Opera Babes released the album &quot;Beyond Imagination&quot;. Steinman produced the track &quot;Vittoria!&quot;, adapted from the Giuseppe Verdi opera &quot;Aida&quot;. Steven Rinkoff was credited with co-production, recording and mixing. Like many Steinman productions, it includes work by electronic-music arranger and programmer Jeff Bova. Steinman was also credited as arranger, along with Jeff Bova and Jon Cohen. In 2004, the film &quot;Shrek 2&quot; was released, along with a soundtrack album. The album has two dance covers of the Steinman/Pitchford song &quot;Holding Out for a Hero&quot;, one with vocals by Jennifer Saunders and the other credited to Frou Frou.

In 2005, The Everly Brothers released a limited edition album titled &quot;On the Wings of a Nightingale: The Mercury Studio Recordings&quot;. This album included the song &quot;A Kiss Is a Terrible Thing to Waste&quot;, written and produced by Steinman. The recording on that album was made in 1987, during the recording sessions that ended up being the 1989 album &quot;Some Hearts&quot;. However, the Steinman song was not released until 2005. This song is different from the song with the same title in &quot;Whistle Down the Wind&quot;. The two songs with this title share only a few words and no music in common, with the Everly Brothers version containing musical motifs recycled from the Steinman song &quot;Out of the Frying Pan (And Into the Fire)&quot;. A demo recording of this song, with Rory Dodd singing lead vocals, has for many years been in circulation among fan websites. Steinman also wrote a later incarnation of &quot;A Kiss Is A Terrible Thing To Waste&quot;, with partly different music and a partly different lyric. Steinman made a recording of this later incarnation with Gina Taylor, a.k.a. Gina Taylor-Pickens or Gina Taylor Pickens, singing the lead vocal. That recording was most likely made when the Pandora&#x27;s Box album &quot;Original Sin&quot; was made, in the late 1980s, and has been in circulation among fans on the internet.

A separate and very different show from &quot;Tanz der Vampire&quot;, &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; opened on Broadway on October 16, 2002. After the original director left the show, it was directed by John Rando, who joined very shortly before the opening. The book was written by David Ives and was notable for the large number of jokes, many of which had a silly or vulgar quality to them. Whereas Tanz had been a &quot;sung-through&quot; musical with no breaks in the music (like an opera), &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot; was a humorous spoken play with songs inserted at some parts.

The reviews tended to be very negative. It closed on January 25, 2003 after 61 preview and 56 regular performances. Financially, it was very unsuccessful and lost roughly $17 million. Steinman did not attend the opening night, in order to show his disgust with the show. In his blog, Steinman also described the show as &quot;DOTV, which you guys know I hated &amp; was disgusted by, &amp; [I] was FIRED by my manager, acting as producer!&quot; The manager he was referring to was David Sonenberg, who was one of the producers of the show and Steinman&#x27;s longtime manager.

During the concerts in his &quot;Hair of the Dog&quot; tour, Meat Loaf told the audience that he and Steinman would be releasing a new album. Later, Meat Loaf said that &quot;lawyers worked for over a year putting together a contract for Steinman to do &quot;Bat Out of Hell III&quot;. It was one of the best producer&#x27;s contracts in the history of the record business.&quot; According to Meat Loaf, the composer had suffered some health setbacks, including a heart attack. Ultimately, according to the singer, Steinman was not well enough to work on such an intense project. However, Steinman&#x27;s manager refuted this version, saying that Steinman&#x27;s &quot;health is excellent&quot; and although he had some &quot;meaningful health problems about four years ago... he&#x27;s been totally healthy the last couple of years... that&#x27;s not the reason he didn&#x27;t participate in [&quot;Bat III&quot;]&quot;.

Produced by Desmond Child, &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot; was released in October 2006. It has fourteen songs, seven of which were written by Steinman; five of these were covers of songs already released on other albums. The other two were adapted from Steinman&#x27;s demos of songs that were intended for musical theater projects. Steinman&#x27;s demo of &quot;In the Land of the Pig, the Butcher is King&quot;, with Rob Evan singing lead vocal, was part of the preparations for the unrealized &quot;Batman: The Musical&quot; project. Steinman&#x27;s demo of &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot;, with Kyle Gordon singing lead vocal, was intended for the possibility that Steinman would provide songs for a musical based on the film &quot;Cry-Baby&quot;. &quot;Cry-Baby&quot; has since been staged, but without any work from Steinman.

In 2006, the album&#x27;s title became the subject of a legal battle between Steinman and Meat Loaf. Steinman had registered a trademark on the title &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; in 1995, and sought to prevent Meat Loaf from using the title. Meat Loaf sought to cancel Steinman&#x27;s trademark and use the title. Aside from the trademark case, he sued Steinman and longtime manager David Sonenberg for $50 million each, for a total of $100 million. An out-of-court settlement was reached, ending the legal cases, allowing Meat Loaf to use the title for this album, and allowing Meat Loaf to release his recordings of the songs &quot;In the Land of the Pig the Butcher Is King&quot; and &quot;Cry to Heaven&quot;. The agreement allowed Steinman to use the title &quot;Jim Steinman&#x27;s Bat Out of Hell&quot; for a musical theatre project based on the songs from &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. This project was announced for opening on February 17, 2017 in Manchester.

In 2006, Westlife released &quot;The Love Album&quot;. It contained a cover of &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot;, produced by Steve Mac. A remix with an added intro, presumably done by Steinman, Rinkoff, and Bova, has leaked and been in circulation among fan sites.

First publicly presented in early 2006, Steinman and Steven Rinkoff created a music performance group named The Dream Engine. The group has worked on studio recordings and held live shows in New York City. It also performed at an award show in Atlanta, Georgia. The people in this project were the first ever to publicly perform the songs &quot;What Part of My Body Hurts the Most&quot;, &quot;We&#x27;re Still the Children We Once Were&quot;, &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, &quot;Not Allowed to Love&quot; and &quot;(It Hurts) Only When I Feel&quot;. The last of those songs is partly adapted from &quot;If It Ain&#x27;t Broke (Break It)&quot;. This project was also the first to perform a revised and politicized lyric to &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot;. With the new lyric, the song alternatively has been called &quot;An American Elegy&quot; and &quot;God&#x27;s Gone A.W.O.L.&quot;. According to Steinman&#x27;s blog, this project was &quot;guided&quot; by Steven Rinkoff. This project has not performed or been active in public since 2006.

===2010s===
In January 2012, it was announced that Steinman was working with Terry Jones of Monty Python fame on a heavy metal version of &quot;The Nutcracker&quot;. In February of the same year, it was announced that he would be inducted into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 14. On April 10, 2012, Amherst College announced that Steinman would receive an honorary degree at the college&#x27;s 191st commencement on May 20. However, honorary degrees are awarded only in person, and Steinman &quot;had to cancel due to unforeseen circumstances&quot;. On April 17, 2013, the college announced that Steinman would speak at a &quot;conversation&quot; on campus that will be open to the public on May 25, and would receive an honorary degree, a doctorate of humane letters, at the college&#x27;s 192nd commencement on May 26. In April 2013, Meat Loaf said that he and Steinman will collaborate on three new songs to be included on Meat Loaf&#x27;s album &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot;, which was (at the time) to be released in 2015. In 2016, Jim Steinman was inducted into the Long Island Music Hall of Fame.

Meat Loaf&#x27;s album &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot; was released in Europe on September 9, 2016, and in North America on September 16, 2016. It contains ten songs composed by Steinman. Jim Steinman wrote either nothing or almost nothing specifically for this album. Paul Crook produced this album. Like Desmond Child&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;, this album was made separately from the production team of Jim Steinman and Steven Rinkoff. Rob Evan was the first singer to perform the songs &quot;Only When I Feel&quot; and &quot;Speaking in Tongues&quot;, in 2005 and 2006. The track &quot;Going All The Way&quot; is a mixture of some previously released material, some previously leaked material, and a little bit of material neither previously released nor previously leaked. Part of &quot;Going All the Way&quot; is in the song &quot;Braver Than We Are/Say A Prayer&quot; from &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;. Part of it is in a leaked demo of Karine Hannah singing, titled &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot;. A small minority of it is not in the leaked demo of Karine Hannah singing or in &quot;Dance of the Vampires&quot;. &quot;Loving You&#x27;s a Dirty Job (But Somebody&#x27;s Got To Do It)&quot; is a cover of the released recording of Bonnie Tyler and Todd Rundgren. &quot;More&quot; is a cover of the released recording of The Sisters of Mercy. The tracks &quot;Who Needs The Young&quot;, &quot;Souvenirs&quot;, &quot;Godz&quot;, &quot;Skull of Your Country&quot;, and &quot;Train of Love&quot; are all covers of unreleased recordings that Steinman made in the 1970s. Recordings from the 1970s of all of those songs have been in circulation among fans on the internet.

In February 2017, Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot; opened for previews at the Manchester Opera House in Manchester, England, then officially premiered at the same venue, then continuing on to the London Coliseum in June. This musical was based on multiple projects, including Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Neverland&quot; musical from the 1970s, the hit albums &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot;, and on assorted other recordings from Steinman&#x27;s career. This musical did not contain any songs that had not been performed in public by the summer of the year 2006, though two songs - &quot;Not Allowed to Love&quot; and &quot;What Part of My Body Hurts the Most&quot; had never been released on any albums or singles at that point. The musical performed at Toronto&#x27;s Ed Mirvish Theatre, then finished in January 2018 to make a return to London in 2018, this time the Dominion Theatre. A German version of the show was produced by Stage Entertainment, and ran at Oberhausen&#x27;s Metronom Theatre from November 2018 to September 2019. The Oberhausen production featured Willemijn Verkaik in the role of Sloane on launch, but she left the show at the end of March 2019. Steinman had also set an American tour of the musical to take place starting in late 2018 through 2019 but it was cancelled after its 3-week run in the first city Toronto was complete. The musical began a limited six week run in New York City&#x27;s Center Theatre from August 1 to September 8, 2019.

A cast recording album for &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot; co-produced by Steinman, Steven Rinkoff, and Michael Reed was released in October 2017 on the BOOH Label, which was created specifically for this album. The album was first distributed in Canada to coincide with the show&#x27;s run in Toronto, then later was released again via Ghostlight Records in July 2018, both as a worldwide digital release and on CD for sale in the UK to coincide with the show&#x27;s run at the Dominion Theatre, London. The cast album features the vocals of the show&#x27;s cast in Manchester, with Andrew Polec and Christina Bennington leading in their roles as Strat and Raven, Rob Fowler and Sharon Sexton as Falco and Sloane, and Danielle Steers and Dom Hartley-Harris as Zahara and Jagwire. Of this original cast, only Andrew Polec, Christina Bennington and Danielle Steers remained with the show from opening in Manchester in 2017 through to complete the NYC run in 2019.

In 2017, Velvet Valve Records was preparing to release music with Karine Hannah singing. In March 2017, Velvet Valve Records digitally released a recording of Hannah singing &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot;. This recording is different from the recording of Hannah singing &quot;Braver Than We Are&quot; from the early 2000s. Plans to release an album with Hannah after the single, possibly to be titled &quot;Renegade Angel&quot;, were abandoned.

==Personal life==
Responding to an interviewer&#x27;s assertion that his songs are tragic, Steinman said he has &quot;never been stomped on literally. Figuratively, I am stomped on every day ... anyway, that is the way I feel sometimes. I&#x27;ve never had my heart broken the way you are talking about. I&#x27;ve never been dumped... but probably because I don&#x27;t allow myself to be dumped.&quot;

At the time of his death, Steinman lived in Ridgefield, Connecticut. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Steinman lived alone in his 6,000 square-foot house described as a &quot;majestic museum of the self, attached to a quaint cottage in the woods of Ridgefield. He spent years expanding and reimagining the house, transforming it into an embodiment of his own eccentric, complicated personality.&quot;

Steinman had a stroke in 2004 and temporarily lost the ability to speak. He had another stroke four years prior to his death.

Per the death certificate from the Connecticut Department of Health, Steinman died from kidney failure at a hospital in Danbury, Connecticut, on April 19, 2021, at age 73. Upon Steinman&#x27;s death, rock writer Paul Stenning said he left a &quot;tremendous legacy&quot;, referring to him as &quot;the greatest ever composer of symphonic rock&quot; and citing him as an influence on a variety of bands across many genres.

His frequent collaborator Meat Loaf (who died nine months after Steinman) reacted to Steinman&#x27;s death by saying, &quot;We didn&#x27;t &quot;know&quot; each other, we &quot;were&quot; each other.&quot;

<text>The vomeronasal organ (VNO), or Jacobson&#x27;s organ, is the paired auxiliary olfactory (smell) sense organ located in the soft tissue of the nasal septum, in the nasal cavity just above the roof of the mouth (the hard palate) in various tetrapods. The name is derived from the fact that it lies adjacent to the unpaired vomer bone (from Latin &#x27;plowshare&#x27;, for its shape) in the nasal septum. It is present and functional in all snakes and lizards, and in many mammals, including cats, dogs, cattle, pigs, and some primates. Humans may have physical remnants of a VNO, but it is vestigial and non-functional.

The VNO contains the cell bodies of sensory neurons which have receptors that detect specific non-volatile (liquid) organic compounds which are conveyed to them from the environment. These compounds emanate from prey, predators, and the compounds called sex pheromones from potential mates. Activation of the VNO triggers an appropriate behavioral response to the presence of one of these three.

VNO neurons are activated by the binding of certain chemicals to their G protein-coupled receptors: they express receptors from three families, called V1R, V2R, and FPR. The axons from these neurons, called cranial nerve zero (CN 0), project to the accessory olfactory bulb, which targets the amygdala and bed nucleus of the stria terminalis, which in turn project to the anterior hypothalamus. These structures constitute the accessory olfactory system.

The VNO triggers the flehmen response in some mammals, which helps direct liquid organic chemicals to the organ. The VNO was discovered by Frederik Ruysch prior to 1732, and later by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813.

==Structure==
===The organ===

The VNO is found at the base of the nasal cavity. It is split into two, being divided by the nasal septum, with both sides possessing an elongated C-shaped, or crescent, lumen. It is encompassed inside a bony or cartilaginous capsule which opens into the base of the nasal cavity.

===The system===
The vomeronasal receptor neurons possess axons which travel from the VNO to the accessory olfactory bulb (AOB), also known as the vomeronasal bulb. These sensory receptors are located on the medial concave surface of the crescent lumen. The lateral, convex surface of the lumen is covered with non-sensory ciliated cells, where the basal cells are also found. At the dorsal and ventral aspect of the lumen are vomeronasal glands, which fill the vomeronasal lumen with fluid. Sitting next to the lumen are blood vessels that dilate or constrict, forming a vascular pump that deliver stimuli to the lumen. A thin duct, which opens onto the floor of the nasal cavity inside the nostril, is the only way of access for stimulus chemicals.

During embryological development, the vomeronasal sensory neurons form from the nasal (olfactory) placode, at the anterior edge of the neural plate (cranial nerve zero).

===Sensory epithelium and receptors===
The VNO is a tubular crescent shape and split into two pairs, separated by the nasal septum. The medial, concave area of the lumen is lined with a pseudo stratified epithelium that has three main cell types: receptor cells, supporting cells, and basal cells. The supporting cells are located superficially on the membrane while the basal cells are found on the basement membrane near the non- epithelium. The receptor neurons possess apical microvilli, to which the sensory receptors are localized. These are G-protein-coupled receptors, which are often referred to as pheromone receptors since vomeronasal receptors have been tied to detecting pheromones.

Three G-protein-coupled receptors have been identified in the VNO, each found in distinct regions: the V1Rs, V2Rs, and FPRs. V1Rs, V2Rs and FPRs are seven transmembrane receptors which are not closely related to odorant receptors expressed in the main olfactory neuroepithelium.

* V1 receptors, V1Rs, are linked to the G protein, Gαi2. The benefit of the GPCR is that they signal in more than one direction. V1Rs are located on the apical compartment of the VNO and a relatively short NH2-terminal and have a great sequence diversity in their transmembrane domains. V1R is specifically expressed in the rodent vomeronasal organ (VNO) and is thought to be responsible for pheromone reception, eliciting a signal transduction.
* V2 receptors, V2Rs, are linked to the G-protein, Gαo. These have long extracellular NH2 terminals which are thought to be the binding domain for pheromonal molecules and are located on the basal compartment of the VNO. V2R genes can be grouped into four separate families, labelled A – D. Family C V2Rs are quite distinct from the other families, and they are expressed in most basal neurons of the VNO.

The vomeronasal organ&#x27;s sensory neurons act on a different signaling pathway than that of the main olfactory system&#x27;s sensory neurons. Activation of the receptors stimulates phospholipase C, which in turn opens the ion channel TRPC2. Upon stimulation activated by pheromones, IP3 production has been shown to increase in VNO membranes in many animals, while adenylyl cyclase and cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP), the major signaling transduction molecules of the main olfactory system, remain unaltered. This trend has been shown in many animals, such as the hamster, the pig, the rat, and the garter snake upon introduction of vaginal or seminal secretions into the environment.

V1Rs and V2Rs are activated by distinct ligands or pheromones.
* Gi proteins are activated upon stimulation with lipophilic odorants.
* Go proteins are activated by nonvolatile proteins, such as the major urinary proteins in mice and exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1 (ESP1).

Many vomeronasal neurons are activated by chemicals in urine. Some of the active compounds are sulfated steroids. Detecting the types and amounts of different sulfated steroids conveys information about the urine donor&#x27;s physiological state, and may therefore serve as an honest signal.

Recent studies proved a new family of formyl peptide receptor like proteins in VNO membranes of mice, which points to a close phylogenetic relation of signaling mechanisms used in olfaction and chemosensors.

===Sensory neurons===
Vomeronasal sensory neurons are extremely sensitive and fire action potentials at currents as low as 1 pA. Many patch-clamp recordings have confirmed the sensitivity of the vomeronasal neurons. This sensitivity is tied to the fact that the resting potential of the vomeronasal neurons is relatively close to that of the firing threshold of these neurons. Vomeronasal sensory neurons also show remarkably slow adaptation and the firing rate increases with increasing current up to 10 pA. The main olfactory sensory neurons fire single burst action potentials and show a much quicker adaptation rate. Activating neurons that have V1 receptors, V1Rs, cause field potentials that have weak, fluctuating responses that are seen the anterior of the accessory olfactory bulb, AOB. Activation of neurons that contain V2 receptors, V2Rs, however, promote distinct oscillations in the posterior of the AOB.

==Function==
In mammals, the sensory neurons of the vomeronasal organ detect non-volatile chemical cues, which requires direct physical contact with the source of odor. Notably, some scents act as chemical-communication signals (pheromones) from other individuals of the same species. Unlike the main olfactory bulb that sends neuronal signals to the olfactory cortex, the VNO sends neuronal signals to the accessory olfactory bulb and then to the amygdala, BNST, and ultimately hypothalamus. Since the hypothalamus is a major neuroendocrine center (affecting aspects of reproductive physiology and behavior as well as other functions such as body temperature), this may explain how scents influence aggressive and mating behavior. For example, in many vertebrates, nerve signals from the brain pass sensory information to the hypothalamus about seasonal changes and the availability of a mate. In turn, the hypothalamus regulates the release of reproductive hormones required for breeding. Some pheromones are detected by the main olfactory system.

==In animals==
The vomeronasal organ originated in tetrapods. The functional vomeronasal system is found in all snakes and lizards, and many mammals.

* Salamanders perform a nose-tapping behavior to presumably activate their VNO.
* Snakes use this organ to sense prey, sticking their tongue out to gather scents and touching it to the opening of the organ when the tongue is retracted.
* The organ is well developed in strepsirrhine primates such as lemurs and lorises, developed to varying degrees in New World monkeys, and underdeveloped in Old World monkeys and apes.
* Elephants transfer chemosensory stimuli to the vomeronasal opening in the roof of their mouths using the prehensile structure, sometimes called a &quot;finger&quot;, at the tips of their trunks.
* Painted turtles use this organ to use their sense of smell underwater.

* Garter snakes – In addition to the main olfactory system, garter snakes have the vomeronasal organ. The vomeronasal organ plays an important role with its sensitivity toward chemicals that are related to mating or sensing prey. For example, snakes use the organ to detect the presence of prey or predator by gathering chemical cues in the environment through the flicking behavior of the forked tongue. Garter snakes also use the vomeronasal organ in pheromone communication. Odors and vomodors should be distinguished. Odors are chemicals detected by the sensory cells in the nasal epithelium through the process of olfaction. Vomodors are chemicals detected by the sensory cells from the vomeronasal organ through the process of vomerolfaction. Entering the lumen, molecules contact the sensory cells attached to the neurosensory epithelium of the vomeronasal organ. The vomeronasal organ is vital to Garter snakes&#x27; perception of airborne prey odors; snakes with vomeronasal nerves cut responded to nonprey odors only.
* Bats— The vomeronasal organ is non-functional in the whole suborder Yinpterochiroptera. In the other suborder of bats, Yangochiroptera, only two families have retained function of the VNO (Phyllostomidae and Miniopteridae).
* Birds— The VNO is absent in all birds

In some other mammals the entire organ contracts or pumps in order to draw in the scents.
==Flehmen response==
Some mammals, particularly felids (cats) and ungulates (which includes horses, cattle, and pigs among other species), use a distinctive facial movement called the flehmen response to direct inhaled compounds to the VNO. The animal lifts its head after finding the odorant, wrinkles its nose while lifting its lips, and ceases to breathe momentarily.

Flehmen behavior is associated with &quot;anatomical specialization&quot;, and animals that present flehmen behavior have incisive papilla and ducts, which connect the oral cavity to the VNO, that are found behind their teeth. However, horses are the exception: they exhibit flehmen response but do not have an incisive duct communication between the nasal and the oral cavity because they do not breathe through their mouths; instead, the VNOs connect to the nasal passages by the nasopalatine duct.

Cats use their vomeronasal organ when scent rubbing; they are able to discriminate between similar smelling substances using this organ, and then perform the rubbing behaviour.

==Evidence for existence in humans==
Many studies have tried to determine whether there is a VNO in adult human beings. Trotier &quot;et al.&quot; estimated that around 92% of their subjects that had no septal surgery had at least one intact VNO. Kjaer and Fisher Hansen, on the other hand, stated that the VNO structure disappears during fetal development as it does for some primates. However, Smith and Bhatnagar (2000) asserted that Kjaer and Fisher Hansen simply missed the structure in older fetuses. Won (2000) found evidence of a VNO in 13 of his 22 cadavers (59.1%) and 22 of his 78 living patients (28.2%). In a study using retrospective analysis of nearly one thousand outpatient nasal endoscopies, Stoyanov et al. (2016) found the organ to be present in 26.83% of the Bulgarian population.

Given these findings, some scientists have argued that there is a VNO in adult human beings. However, most investigators have sought to identify the opening of the VNO in humans, rather than identify the tubular epithelial structure itself. Thus it has been argued that such studies, employing macroscopic observational methods, have sometimes misidentified or even missed the vomeronasal organ.

Among studies that use microanatomical methods, there is no reported evidence that human beings have active sensory neurons like those in working vomeronasal systems of other animals. Furthermore, there is no evidence to date that suggests there are nerve and axon connections between any existing sensory receptor cells that may be in the adult human VNO and the brain. Likewise, there is no evidence for any accessory olfactory bulb in adult human beings, and the key genes involved in VNO function in other mammals have pseudogenized in human beings. Therefore, while many debate the structure&#x27;s presence in adult human beings, a review of the scientific literature by Tristram Wyatt concluded that on current evidence, &quot;most in the field... are skeptical about the likelihood of a functional VNO in adult human beings.&quot;

==History==
The VNO was discovered by Frederik Ruysch prior to 1732, and later by Ludwig Jacobson in 1813.
