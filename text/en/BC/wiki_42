<text>The music of [[Kenya]] is very diverse, with multiple types of folk music based on the variety over 50 regional languages.

Zanzibaran taarab music has also become popular, as has hip hop, reggae music, soul, soukous, zouk, rock and roll, funk and Europop. Additionally, there is a growing western classical music scene and Kenya is home to a number of music colleges and schools.

==Popular music==
The guitar is the most dominant instrument in Kenyan popular music. Guitar rhythms are very complex and include both native beats and imported ones, especially the Congolese cavacha rhythm; music usually involves the interplay of multiple parts and, more recently, showy guitar solos.

Lyrics are most often in Swahili or native languages, like Kalenjin though radio will generally not play music in one of the ethnic languages.

Benga music has been popular since the late 1960s, especially around Lake Victoria. The word &quot;benga&quot; is occasionally used to refer to any kind of pop music: bass, guitar and percussion are the usual instruments.

Partially from 1994 and wholly from 2003 Kenyan popular music has been recognised through the Kisima Music Awards. A number of styles predominate in Kenya including Benga and Reggae have separate categories, and a multitude of Kenyan artists are awarded each year.

===Early 20th century===

The guitar was popular in Kenya even before the 19th century, well before it penetrated other African countries. Fundi Konde was the best-known early guitarist, alongside &quot;Paul Mwachupa&quot; and &quot;Lukas Tututu&quot; the middle of the 1920s, dance clubs had appeared in Mombasa, playing music for Christians to dance in a European style.

During World War II, Kenyan and Ugandan musicians were drafted as entertainers in the King&#x27;s African Rifles and continued after the war as the Rhino Band, the first extremely popular band across Kenya. In 1948, the group split, with many of the members forming the &quot;Kiko Kids&quot; or other bands.

By the 1950s, radio and recording technology had advanced across Kenya. Fundi Konde, the prominent guitarist, was an early broadcaster and influential in the fledgling recording industry.

===Congolese finger-style and the development of benga===

Beginning in about 1952, recordings from legendary Congolese guitarists like Edouard Massengo and Jean-Bosco Mwenda were available in Kenya. Bosco&#x27;s technique of picking with the thumb and forefinger (finger-style) became popular. Finger-style music is swift and usually based around small groups, in which the second guitar follows the first with syncopated bass rhythms. This style of music became extremely popular later in the decade.

===Swahili and Congolese pop===

The two biggest genres of pop music played by Kenyan bands are called the Swahili sound or the &quot;Congolese sound&quot;. Both are based on soukous (rumba) from the Democratic Republic of the Congo. Swahili music can be distinguished by a much slower rhythm, though the styles have had a tendency to merge in recent decades. The genres are not distinguished by language, though Swahili pop is usually in Swahili or the related Taiti language. Both are sometimes in Lingala or one of the native languages of Kenya.

Congolese musicians were the most popular performers in Kenya during the 1970s and 1980s, only losing their mainstream acceptance in the early 1990s. Orchestre Virunga was perhaps the most popular and long-running of the Congolese bands. During this period, Swahili musicians (many from Tanzania) were mostly based around the Wanyika bands. This group of often rival bands began in 1971 when a Tanzanian group named Arusha Jazz came to Kenya, eventually becoming the Simba Wanyika Band. The band first split in 1978, when many of the group members formed Les Wanyika. Other notable Congolese groups in Kenya included Super Mazembe and Les Mangelepa. Tanzania&#x27;s Moro Band and Remmy Ongala also became quite popular in Kenya back in the 1980s. It was hard to differentiate them from the native Kenyan singers.

===Hotel pop===

Tourist-oriented pop covers are popular, and employ more live bands than more authentic Kenyan folk and pop genres. Them Mushrooms, who began playing the Nairobi hotel circuit in 1987, are among these bands. Lately, hotel bands like Them Mushrooms and Safari Sound Band have begun playing reggae.

===Regional pop===

The Luo people, one of Kenya&#x27;s largest ethnic groups, live in the Western part of Kenya and their pop music is what epitomizes the original Benga style. Contemporary variations of Benga and Luo traditional music has produced the Ohangla style that is popular with young Luo. The Luo of Kenya have long played an eight-string lyre called nyatiti, and guitarists from the area sought to imitate the instrument&#x27;s syncopated melodies. In benga, the electric bass guitar is played in a style reminiscent of the nyatiti. As late as the turn of the twentieth century, this bass in nyatiti supported the rhythm essential in transmitting knowledge about the society through music. Opondo Owenga of Gem Yala, the grandfather of Odhiambo Siangla, was known in employing music as a means of teaching history of the Luo. The fathers of the Luo Benga genre are George Ramogi (Omogi wuod Weta) and CK Jazz. He helped the Benga enthusiasts by recording their Benga music in different labels in the capital city Nairobi. Dr. Mengo of Victoria Jazz was a protege of George Ramogi.

In 1967, the first major benga band, Shirati Jazz, was formed by Daniel Owino Misiani. The group launched a string of hits that were East Africa&#x27;s biggest songs throughout the 1970s and 1980s. Shirati Jazz&#x27;s biggest rival was Victoria Jazz, formed in 1972 by Ochieng Nelly Mengo and Collela Mazee. Despite many personnel changes, Victoria Jazz remained popular throughout the 1970s, when the Voice of Kenya radio station pushed an onslaught of East African pop. Victoria C Band of Awino Lawi was one of the splinter group of Victoria Jazz.

1997 saw the death of three prominent Luo Benga artist, Okatch Biggy of Heka Heka Band, George Ramogi and Prince Jully. The Jolly Boys Band of Prince Jully was taken over by his wife Princess Jully and she has since been a leading female Benga musician.[1]

Another famous benga band Migori Super Stars was formed in the mid-1970s and was led by Musa Olwete which later split to form another popular benga band Migori Super Stars C with musicians such as Joseph Ochola (Kasongo Polo Menyo), Onyango Jamba, Ochieng&#x27; Denge denge and others.

More modern benga artists include Akothee Kapere Jazz Band and the rootsy Ogwang Lelo Okoth. The new millennium has seen emergence of Dola Kabarry and Musa Juma. The latter saw his career cut short as he died in 2011.MJ,as he was popularly known to his fans, developed a kind of benga that infused elements of rumba. he was able to mold other musicians such as John Junior, Ogonji, Madanji, and his late brother Omondi Tonny.[2] More recently, the compositions of the trumpeter Christine Kamau combine jazz with benga and rhumba.

There are also Benga artists are based in countries other than Kenya, such as American/Kenyan group Extra Golden.

The Kamba people live to the south and east of Nairobi. Their pop music is closely related to benga, but includes a second guitar that plays a melodious counterpoint to the primary guitar. The most popular &quot;Kamba pop&quot; bands arose in the middle of the 1970s and include &quot;Les Kilimambogo Brothers Band&quot; led by &quot;Kakai Kilonzo&quot;, &quot;Kalambya Boys &amp; Kalambya Sisters&quot; led by Onesmus Musyoki and &quot;Joseph Mutaiti&quot; and &quot;Peter Mwambi &amp; His Kyanganga Boys&quot;. Other groups also include &quot;Lower Mbooni Boys Band&quot;, &quot;Muthetheni Boys Band&quot; and &quot;Ukia Boys Band&quot;.

Other Akamba Pop Bands were formed in the 1980s and included &quot;Kakuku Boys Band&quot; vocalled by John Mutua Muteti whose lyrics consisted of religious, domestic, and court humour, &quot;Ngoleni Brothers&quot; which was formed by Dick Mutuku Mulwa after he left Kalambya Boys &amp; Kalambya Sisters. It can also be noted that &quot;Kalambya Boys&quot; original members were Onesmus Musyoki (vocals), Joseph Mutaiti (vocals), Dick Mutuku Mulwa (rhythm guitar), James Maisha Muli(Drums) and Peter Kisaa (solo guitar). Kalambya Boys split and Joseph Mutaiti formed &quot;Super Kaiti&quot; and &quot;Onesmus Musyoki&quot; went gospel to form &quot;Emali Town Choir&quot;.

Leading Luhya musicians include &quot;Sukuma Bin Ongaro&quot;, and &quot;Shem Tube&quot; with his group Abana Ba Nasery.

It raised up to a certain level and came an instrument with eight strings called &quot;litungu&quot; played popularly in Bungoma by a group of people called bukusu in a band e.g. Sinani Band led by Wanjala Mandari,there after improved and developed in 2020 by Wabwile wa Mbakalo with a love message to educate and fablish the community in luhya/Bukusu dialect Wabwile Wa Mbakalo has become popular in Bungoma region with his sweet voice and recruited other young stars in the region.

===Hip hop===

Hip hop is a hugely popular style of music in Kenya. Artists rap in English, Swahili, the local Sheng slang or even in vernacular language like kikuyu (&quot;G.rongi&quot;), Kisii (&quot;Smallz Lethal&quot;) or dholuo (Gidi Gidi Maji Maji). One of its many popular genres is Genge which is showcased through artists such as Jua Cali, Nonini and Jimwat. There is also Kapuka rap, which is found with artists like Nameless. Female rappers like Needah of Grosspool Music and Xtatic, who got signed to Sony Music are taking the industry to another level. Others like Wangechi and Femi One are also doing the genre some justice.
The country also boasts a large following of hardcore rap which is characterised by swift freestyle battlers and lyricists like &quot;Mc Mike G&quot; of 237 cypher, Bamboo, &quot;G.rongi&quot;,Jay Fourz, SDL, Abass Doobiez and Chiwawa.

The genre also boasts only two live performers; Juliani (formerly of &quot;Ukoo Flani&quot;) and Jemedari, a fresh rapper who draws his roots from Coastal influences.

Camp Mulla, an alternative hip hop group, has had more success than any other Kenyan artist in history. As of 28 September 2012, they have won two &quot;CHAT Awards&quot; and have been nominated for prestigious awards such as the BET Awards, the MTV Europe Music Awards and the MOBO Awards.

===Reggae===

Reggae is one of the most popular genres of music in Kenya. Reggae elements are often mixed with local hip hop and pop music, yet there have not been many mainstream reggae musicians in Kenya. One of the best known local reggae musicians is the late Mighty King Kong. Upcoming reggae artist priest fariis the artist to watch out for. With two albums &quot;warrior&quot; and &quot;Pressure&quot; under his belt, Priest fari is arguably the next big thing on the Kenyan reggae scene. His touch remains the original Jamaican roots reggae.

Other Reggae icons in Kenya include the talented Wyre and Red San. The massive love for reggae in Kenya has led to the inception of other talents including Reggae music Deejays.

===Rock===
Rock music has found a home to a growing fan base and with a number of locally established as well as emerging rock bands (there are over twelve active local rock bands in Nairobi alone) further cementing this genre by engaging in different as well as mutually organised rock themed events. Foreign international rock bands (Jars of Clay, Casting Crowns, 38th Parallel, Zebra &amp; Giraffe) have also graced the local scene, which reflects on the growing influence and acceptance of this genre.

Organized member bodies such as Wiyathi (now defunct) and Roffeke (Rock &#x27;n&#x27; Roll Film Festival Kenya) were fundamental in initially marketing local rock bands in the country by hosting regular shows and helped to establish a vibrant rock community. Recently, the bands also by social event groups like Kenya Rock Fans, have widely assisted the bands to gain popularity and increase their fan base, subsequently the founding of a governing body, the Rock Society of Kenya, which serves to promote the interests of member bands. The society spearheads numerous rock related events like the Battle of the Bands and live rock club shows that has spurred constructive level of activity for bands.

Over the past few years many entertainment spots have also independently incorporated rock music onto their programs further indicating a genuine interest from the public. In addition there are radio stations that play rock music: 98.4 Capital FM and &quot;105.5 X FM&quot;, the latter being a 24-hour rock station. In 2019, 105.5 X FM was shut down by the parent company Radio Africa. KTN (Str8up), STV (The Rumble) and K24 (The Rumble) also play regular weekly rock shows. Popular prominent local rock bands include acts such as Parking Lot Grass, Last Year&#x27;s Tragedy(LYT)- Whose song &quot;March From the Underground&quot; is said to have foreseen the recent attacks on a Kenyan University, Murfy&#x27;s fLaw, Dove Slimme, M20, Rock of Ages, Seismic, The Itch, The Beathogs, Crystal Axis, DEOWA, Rash, Bedslum and kick ass metal band Mortal Soul.

Kalpop is a genre of Klassikan, African, lingual (multicultural), and popular music that originated in its modern form during the mid-1990s in Kenya and later spread to the United States and the United Kingdom. Kalpop music has found a home to a growing fan base and with a number of locally established as well as emerging Kalpop bands (there are over thirteen active local Kalpop bands in Nairobi alone) further cementing this genre by engaging in different as well as mutually organised Kalpop themed events.

DON SANTO, Badman Killa, Blessed Paul, Cash B, Jay Nuclear, Rekless, G-Youts (Washu B and Nicki Mulla), Sleek Whizz, Chizei, are among the many artists playing Kalpop music in Kenya.

===Other genres===

There is a growing interest in other genres of music such as house, Trap Music, and drum and bass. Acts like Just A Band &quot;Skilz&quot; have also dabbled in numerous alternative genres. The growth of Kenyan Trap Music has been recently popularized by artist like Ekko Dydda &amp; artists from Janeson Recordings. Neo-soul music has also gained a huge audience with recurrent events such as Blankets and Wine promoting upcoming Neo-soul bands and artistes such as Sage, Antoneosol, Sarah Mitaru Sauti Sol and Dela the neo-soul music scene in Kenya is slowly growing. Genres such as Genge with artists such as Jua Cali and Nonini acting as ambassadors of this genre. In 2019, a new music genre emerged in Nairobi referred to as Gengeton. Gengeton was a huge success. However, due to the quarantine in 2020 as a result of COVID-19 pandemic, Gengetone musicians such as Boondocks Gang were unable to perform, affecting the earlier success.

Genres such as Kapuka also have an audience with acts such as Nameless, the late Esir, and the late K-rupt sampling from these genres. The Kenyan music scene regards itself as diverse, but some in the scene do launch criticism at what they perceive as a lack of musical originality.
Of late a massive resurgence has occurred in the industry with musical groups such as Sauti Sol receiving global acclaim.

==Traditional music==
Kenya&#x27;s diverse ethnic groups each have their own folk music traditions, though most have declined in popularity in recent years as gospel music became more popular.

The Mammoth franchise previously played as the Baltimore Thunder from 1987 to 1999, the Pittsburgh CrosseFire in 2000, and the Washington Power from 2001 to 2002. Up until the joining of the expansion team San Diego Seals, Colorado was the only non-Canadian team in the Western Division from 2014 to 2018. They have only missed the playoffs twice since moving to Colorado.

In 2004 and from 2006 to 2008, the Mammoth lead the league in attendance. 2006 was the first year in the 20-year history of the NLL that the league had an attendance of more than one million fans in one season. The Mammoth had the honor of hosting fan number one million. In 2008, the Mammoth average attendance per game was higher than Pepsi Center&#x27;s other teams, the Colorado Avalanche (NHL) and the Denver Nuggets (NBA).

==2006 champions==
In the 2006 season, the Mammoth went to the playoffs in the #2 seed in the Western Division. Round one was hosted in Colorado against rivals Calgary. The Mammoth won 18–17 in overtime. Brian Langtry scored the overtime goal. Round two (Western Division finals) was also hosted at Pepsi Center against the Arizona Sting. Rookie Dan Carey scored the winning goal as the Mammoth defeated the Sting 13–12. The championship game was held at HSBC Arena in Buffalo against the Bandits who held the league&#x27;s best record and the incumbent league MVP, goaltender Steve Dietrich . The Mammoth won the Champion&#x27;s Cup by a score of 16–9, with Gavin Prout being named Game MVP.

==2022 champions==
The Mammoth won the National Lacrosse League Cup beating the Buffalo Bandits 2 games to 1, with Dillon Ward being named the Finals MVP.

==Notable players==
*Gary Gait, who retired after the 2005 NLL season as the NLL&#x27;s all-time scoring leader with 596 goals and 495 assists in 174 games (a record since surpassed by John Tavares). Gait also won the 2003 NLL MVP Award while with the Mammoth. On November 12, 2005, Gait was inducted into the NLL Hall of Fame, and on December 30, 2005, his number 22 jersey banner was hung from Pepsi Center rafters — the first NLL number ever to be retired and hung from any arena. Gait was the Mammoth head coach for the 2006 and 2007 seasons before stepping down in August 2007 to pursue other interests.
*Brian Langtry, who won the NLL Rookie of the Year Award in 2003, is well known for his all-out goal scoring attempts. Langtry retired after the 2011 season.
*Gord &quot;Gee&quot; Nash, who was the 2004 Goaltender of the Year.
*Gavin Prout, a crowd favorite who consistently puts up high numbers. In 2006, Prout was named team captain. On October 31, 2009, to the outrage of many fans, Prout was traded to the Rochester Knighthawks, who in turn traded him to the Edmonton Rush on November 10. After a season and a half in Edmonton, Prout was traded back to the Mammoth in March 2011.
*John Grant Jr., who was the 2012 NLL MVP. Retired in 2017.
*Joey Cupido, three time fan favorite award winner who was the 2015 and 2018 Transition Player of the Year.

<doc id="246384" wikidata="Q2346484" url="?curid=246384" title="Music of Morocco">
<text>Moroccan music varies greatly between geographic regions and social groups. It is influenced by musical styles including Arab, Berber, Andalusi, Mediterranean, Saharan, West African, and others.

Musical styles vary by geography. Andalusi music and &quot;malhun&quot; are associated with urban centers in the north, &quot;chaabi&quot; and &quot;aita&quot; are associated with the Atlantic coastal plains, &quot;reggada&quot; is associated with the Beni-Znassen region ( Oujda, Berkane..), gnawa with Essaouira and Marrakesh, &quot;ahidus&quot; with the Middle Atlas, &quot;ahwash&quot; with the Sous region, and &quot;guedra&quot; in the Sahara.

Particularly since the 20th century, musicians have been synthesizing Moroccan musical traditions with influences from around the world, such as blues, rock, metal, reggae, rap, etc. Each genre and musical style is made up of regional subgroups, and is further divided between &#x27;modern&#x27; and &#x27;traditional&#x27; music.

==Traditional music styles==

=== &quot;Aita&quot; ===
Aita ( &quot;call, cry or lament&quot;) is a popular Bedouin musical style that originates from the countryside of Morocco, especially the Atlantic plains—areas such as Doukkala-Abda, Chaouia-Ouardigha, and Rehamna.

===Amazigh folk music===

There are many varieties of Berber folk music and dance, such as Rif, Atlas, Chawia, and Canaria.

==== &quot;Ahwash&quot; ====

&quot;Ahwash&quot; (, ) is a collective musical form associated with Amazigh communities in southern Morocco, particularly around Ouarzazate, the Dra&#x27;a Valley, and Sous. &quot;Ahwash&quot; involves dance, singing, poetry, and percussion.

==== &quot;Ahidus&quot; ====

&quot;Ahidus&quot; (, ) is a style of collective dance and song of the Amazigh tribes in Middle and Eastern High Atlas.

==== &quot;Guedra&quot; ====
&quot;Guedra&quot; is a music and dance style associated with the Tuareg &quot;blue people&quot; of the Moroccan sahara. The name comes from an earthen cookingware over which a hide is stretched to form a drum.

In 2021, the anthology of the art of &quot;Rrways - a journey into the realm of Amazigh wandering poet- singers&quot;, presenting a booklet and ten compact discs with current recordings received the &#x27; Prix Coups de Cœur - Musiques du Monde&#x27; of the Académie Charles Cross in France.

===Andalusi classical music===

&quot;For the music of Andalusia, Spain, see&quot; &quot;main article:&quot; Music of Andalusia

Andalusi classical music ( transliterated &quot;ṭarab andalusi&quot; or &quot;Musiqa al-Ala&quot;, Spanish: música andalusí) is a major genre of Arabic music found in different local substyles across the Maghreb (Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, and Libya in the form of the Ma&#x27;luf style). It originated in the music of Al-Andalus (Muslim Iberia) between the 9th and 15th centuries.

Some of its lyrics are based on poetic works written by authors from Al-Andalus, such as Al-Shushtari, Ibn al-Khatib and Al-Mu&#x27;tamid ibn Abbad. Andalusi music is considered part of the longest traditions of art and music in the world. Andalusi music was greatly influenced by Ziryab&quot;,&quot; a freed Persian slave and musical pioneer, in the early 9th century. After Ziryab&#x27;s death, two new styles of Arabic poetry were introduced in Al-Andalus: Muwashshahat and Zajal.

=== Chaabi &quot;popular&quot; folk music ===

Chaabi (, meaning &quot;popular&quot; in English) is a music consisting of numerous varieties which descend from the multifarious forms of Moroccan folk music. Chaabi was originally performed in markets, but is now found at any celebration or meeting.

=== Raï Music ===
Morocco has produced its own stars like Mimoun El Oujdi and Hanino. Rai music originated from Algeria, but is just as effective and popular in Morocco. This style of music was created during a period of political turmoil, and served a purpose of social and political commentary. Rai music has gained massive support over the years from the urban populace for its purpose of addressing taboo topics. It was also greatly known for code switching between French and Arabic. Rai artists use this method to add to the rhetorical and aesthetic effect of the lyrics, as well as a method of opening the lyrics to a wider range of an audience.

=== Gnawa music ===
Gnawa music is a mystical form of music and incantation of West African origin. It was initially brought to Morocco by Sub-Saharan Africans and gradually became part of the Moroccan musical tradition. The gnawa musicians are respected for their spiritual performances. Through oral traditions, they have handed down a specific cultural ceremony, called &quot;derdeba&quot; or &quot;lila,&quot; which consists of song, dance, the burning of incense and of specific costumes and colours. The instruments used are large drums called “” or “” and metal double castanets called “”. The main instrument is a three-stringed bass lute, called the “&quot;gimbri&quot;” accompanied by the chanting of the singers.

===Classical Malhun===

Classical Malhun is peaceful music associated with urban centers such as Meknes, Fes, Salé, Tetouan, and Oujda. It has been played around in the streets of Morocco for over a thousand years. It is very common music to hear in Morocco.

===Classical Sufi music===

Sufi brotherhoods (&quot;tariqas&quot;) are common in Morocco, and music is an integral part of their spiritual tradition. This music is an attempt at reaching a trance state which inspires mystical ecstasy.

== Recent styles ==

=== Funk ===
Attarazat Addahabia was one of the pioneers of funk music in Morocco. Jil Jilala was also influential in this genre.

=== Rock ===
Nass El Ghiwane, led by Larbi Batma, was an icon of Moroccan music in the late 20th century.

Hoba Hoba Spirit is a rock band that draws influence from traditional Moroccan styles such as gnawa, as well as styles from abroad such as reggae.

Bab L&#x27; Bluz combine Gnawa music with various influences such as blues and psychedelia to embody the &quot;Nayda&quot; movement among young people in Morocco.
=== Hip hop ===
Notable Moroccan hip hop musicians include L&#x27;Morphine, El Grande Toto, Don Big, Dizzy Dros and others. Among the younger generation there are Issam, JIMMY BLANKA (music artists from north Morocco) and Manal Benchlikha.

<doc id="246391" wikidata="Q641361" url="?curid=246391" title="Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014)">
<text>The Philadelphia Wings were a member of the National Lacrosse League, a professional box lacrosse league in North America starting in 1987. They played at the Spectrum (1987–96) and then at the Wells Fargo Center in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania.

The Wings were one of the four original teams in the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League that began play in 1987 and the only team to reclaim its identity from the original 1974–75 National Lacrosse League and also retained the first Philadelphia Wings logo.

The Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League was renamed the Major Indoor Lacrosse League in 1989, and again to the National Lacrosse League in 1998. They are the only franchise to have played all 24 seasons in the same city. The Wings have the most titles in the combined league history with six total: four North American Cups in the MILL era and two Champion&#x27;s Cup since the formation of the NLL.

On July 11, 2014, it was announced on the team&#x27;s website that the Wings would be relocating after 28 years in Philadelphia. On September 19, 2014, it was announced that the team will be known as the New England Black Wolves and will play at the Mohegan Sun Arena.

In September 2017 the National Lacrosse League announced that Comcast-Spectacor would be the owners of an expansion franchise for the 2018–19 season. On November 29, 2017, it was announced the new franchise would use the &quot;Wings&quot; name.

==History==

===Early years===

The Philadelphia Wings were one of the original four franchises in the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League, joining the New Jersey Saints, Washington Wave, and Baltimore Thunder in the premiere season. While the Wings were not an immediate success on the floor, going 3–3 and 3–5 in the first two regular seasons with two playoff losses, they were the biggest draw in the league. They drew an average of almost 12,000 fans to their three 1987 regular season games, and slightly over 12,000 fans for their four games in 1988.

Their first on-field success came in 1989 with a first place 6–2 campaign, ending with their first of a league record 6 titles with an 11–10 win over New York at the Spectrum. The Wings became the first team to repeat with another 6–2 regular season followed by a championship win in Worcester over the New England Blazers. A 5–5 season in 1991 left the Wings in third place in the American Division, 1 game behind the division winners Baltimore and out of the playoffs for the first time in their history, denying them the opportunity for a &quot;threepeat.&quot;

Some of the early stars of those teams included Mike French, Hall of Fame college player at Cornell and a current team executive; John Grant Sr., father of current NLL star John Grant Jr. and member of the Philadelphia Wings (1974–1975) ; Syracuse Hall of Famer Brad Kotz; long time Wings coach, Tony Resch; and long time NLL player and coach John Tucker.

===Wings vs. Bandits===
In 1992, the MILL expanded to Western New York with the Buffalo Bandits. The Bandits were primarily Canadian players from Ontario, while the Wings were still mostly American based, like the rest of the league at the time. The rivalry was instant, as the teams would play each other in 4 of the next 5 title games, interrupted only by the Wings triumph over Rochester in the 1995 season. The Wings struggled in the regular season of 1992, but turned it on in the playoffs to defeat Baltimore and New York and host the Bandits in the championship game. John Tavares would end the Wings quest for their 3rd title with an overtime winner, however.

1993 saw the Wings have a 7–1 season, only to be topped by the Bandits perfect 8–0 season. Both teams dispatched their semifinal opponents, and the rematch was on. The Bandits once again ended the Wings hopes, this time winning a one-goal contest in regulation 13–12.

1994 saw both teams top their respective divisions with 6–2 marks, and again both teams dominated the semifinal game to meet for a 3rd consecutive time for the North American Cup. An incredible run by Philadelphia in the middle of the game buried the Bandits hopes of their own threepeat, giving the Wings a 26–15 win and their third title.

The Wings were their same dominating selves in 1995, going 7–1 to finish atop the single table (a structure the league changed back to before the season), while the Bandits uncharacteristically struggled, finishing just 4th in a 6 team league at 3–5. This meant the Wings faced the Bandits in the semifinals, and due to the MILL&#x27;s &quot;attendance rule&quot; that gave postseason home field advantage to the team with better attendance, the game was played in Buffalo. The Wings proved to be the better team with a 19–16 win on their way to a league high 4th title.

1996 saw the Bandits return to their prior form, while both teams finishing 8–2 and tied atop the league standings. Once again, the teams found themselves in the final, and the Bandits returned the favor of stopping a threepeat with a dominating 15–10 performance.

1997 saw that Wings move from the Spectrum to the new CoreStates Center (now the Wells Fargo Center). It would also be the first time that the Wings and Bandits would not meet in the playoffs since the Bandits had been introduced in 1992. The Wings won another regular season title with a 7–1 record, but were upset in the semifinals by the eventual champion Rochester Knighthawks.

===NLL era===
The league name changed for 1998, but the Wings success did not. Despite the loss of Gary Gait to the Baltimore Thunder, the Wings still claimed their 4th regular season title in 5 years at 9–3. Once again, the Wings were paired up with their arch-rival Bandits in the semifinal round, and the Wings dispatched the Bandits just as they had in the previous semifinal matchup. The Wings advanced to play the Thunder and Gary Gait in the final round, which was a best 2 of 3 series for the one and only time in league history. The Wings opened the series with a 16–12 victory at home, before sweeping the series with a dominating 17–12 road victory in Baltimore Arena. Wings goaltender Dallas Eliuk was named Championship Series MVP.

1999 saw the end of the heated Wings-Bandits rivalry, as the Bandits started to rebuild and fell to a 4–8 mark, missing the postseason. The Wings also had regular season struggles, finishing at just 5–7 and squeaking into the playoffs as the fourth seed. Wings fans probably wish the team had missed the postseason, as the team was pummeled in a record breaking 13–2 loss to the eventual champion Toronto Rock. 2000 saw the team improve slightly to 7–5 during the season, but it ended the same way, with a semifinal loss in Toronto by a more respectable 14–10 score.

That set up the 2001 season, with the Wings once again seeing their league dominance challenged by a newcomer to the league. The Rock and the Wings did not disappoint, with the Rock going 11–3 and the Wings 10–4 in the regular season, and winning their semifinal games to set up a third straight postseason matchup in Toronto, this time with the title on the line. Unlike the previous two games, the Wings dictated the style of play, combined with the stellar goaltending of 2001 Championship Game MVP Dallas Eliuk, built a 9–4 lead, and never looked back. The Rock made a late-game rally but it proved too little, too late, and the Wings claimed their 6th title with a 9–8 upset victory, silencing the 19,409 Toronto Fans in attendance.

The 2002 season was clearly a transition year for the franchise, as they muddled through a difficult season to finish at 8–8 before falling in a quarterfinal game against the Washington Power. Until the 2008 season, it would prove to be the last playoff appearance for the proud franchise.

===Rebuilding===

The 2003 season saw the Wings start off strongly, but collapse down the stretch as they finished 8–8, and lost the division title to the Colorado Mammoth, missing the postseason for the first time since 1991. It would continue to get worse for the Wings, as the next two years ended with a last-place 7–9 2004 season and a 6–10 2005 season. The rebuilding of the Wings began in earnest in the offseason, with Perennial All-Pro Goaltender Dallas Eliuk being granted a trade request to be closer to home (due to his father&#x27;s failing health), the Wings would have three first round draft picks before the 2006 season, adding Sean Greenhalgh, Luke Wiles, and Chad Thompson. Wiles and Thompson were later dealt for Mike Regan, and Greenhalgh was moved to Buffalo after the 2007 season. Despite the added firepower, the Wings saw some improvement, going 8–8 in 2006 but missing the postseason on tiebreakers.

The 2006 draft was again fertile ground for the Wings, adding Geoff Snider, Ian Llord, and Athan Iannucci in the first round, and adding Kyle Wailes, another first round pick, through a trade with Calgary. However, the 2007 season again would leave fans wondering about the future, when the Wings collapsed down the stretch with 4 losses in the last 5 games to crash to a 6–10 record and miss the playoffs for a fifth consecutive season. The entire coaching staff was fired after the season ended, though Lindsay Sanderson kept the role of GM.

===Dave Huntley returns===
On June 8, 2007, the Wings announced that the team&#x27;s original general manager Dave Huntley would be their head coach for the 2008 season. The personnel changes would continue as Sean Greenhalgh was moved to Buffalo and Ian Llord moved to Calgary in a deal that brought the Wings Jason Crosbie on offense and former Defenseman of the Year Taylor Wray on defense. The Wings added goaltender Rob Blasdell in the dispersal draft that occurred for the one-year suspension of the Arizona Sting, and he was named the starting goaltender for the 2008 season. On March 5, 2008, the Wings continued to restructure the team, even when leading the league with a 6–1 record at the halfway point. The Wings were involved in trades with the Chicago Shamrox, Minnesota Swarm, and Edmonton Rush leading to the acquisition of A.J. Shannon and Brandon Miller, while sending Matt Roik, Dan Marohl, Keith Cromwell, and Brad Self elsewhere.

All the changes paid off, as the Wings compiled a 10–6 record, good for a four-way tie for the Eastern Division championship. Due to tiebreakers, they finished with the 4th seed in the East, and travelled to Buffalo for an Eastern Division semifinal game on May 2, 2008. The Wings return to the postseason was short-lived, however, as the Wings dropped a 14–12 decision to the Bandits.

The 2008 season saw the emergence of two new Wings superstars, second year players Athan Iannucci and Geoff Snider. Iannucci scored 71 goals on the season, breaking Gary Gait&#x27;s single-season scoring record of 61, and Snider set new records for loose balls (242), penalty minutes (103), and faceoffs won (318). Both made the All-Star team and All-Pro teams, and Iannucci was named Player of the Month three times as well as league MVP.

The 2009 season was marred by an offseason injury to star Athan Iannucci, who was only able to appear in 10 games, and compiled just 36 points after his record-breaking haul the season before. Needing to re-establish an offense without the focal point, the Wings struggled to a 2–5 start, but were able to rally to win 4 of the next 6 and get back to a 7–8 record heading into the season finale in Rochester with a playoff spot on the line. Back to back playoff berths were not to be, however, as the Wings fell to the Knighthawks 11–8 to finish the season 5th in the East.

===2011 and beyond===

In 2011, after 2 seasons with Dave Huntley as coach, the Wings appointed former Wings player John Tucker to the head coaching position. After winning two championships with the Wings while they were in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League in 1989 and 1990, Tucker had success in coaching the now defunct Baltimore Thunder and Pittsburgh Crossefire.

2011 started out well for Tucker and the Wings. After a slow start at home against Boston and Buffalo, Philadelphia ended January on a 3-game winning streak, taking two games from Colorado, and blowing out Boston on the road. Strong play from Max Seibald and goaltender Brandon Miller highlighted these wins, and put the Wings half a game out of first place. Shortly thereafter, the Wings season began to crumble. After an up and down February, which saw Philadelphia split with Buffalo, and lose in Rochester, the season bottomed out, with the Wings losing 7 out of their last 8 games, and finishing with a 5–11 record, 5 and a half games out of first place and tied with Dave Huntley in 2010 for the worst season record of all time. In June 2011, Tucker announced he was stepping down from the head coaching position to focus on his position as the Wings new director of United States collegiate scouting efforts.

On July 25, current Wings general manager Johnny Mouradian became the team&#x27;s new head coach. Mouradian had previously served as president, general manager, and advisor to the 2010 NLL Champs, the Washington Stealth. Mouradian wasted little time in shaping the 2012 season by trading Athan Iannucci to the Edmonton Rush with teammates Alex Turner and Brodie McDonald, along with Philadelphia&#x27;s first round draft picks in 2012, 2013 and 2014. In exchange, the Wings acquired Edmonton transition player Brodie Merrill, Rush forwards Dean Hill, Mike McLellan, and Edmonton&#x27;s 41st selection in the 2011 entry draft, and the 4th round selection in 2013.

===Relocation===

On July 11, 2014, the Philadelphia Wings announced through their home page that the franchise was looking to relocate for the 2015 season. Citing the increasing saturation of the Philadelphia sports marketplace, “My love for the Wings and my connection with the city has made this move all the more difficult,” said Wings Owner and team president Michael French. “I would like to express my sincere gratitude to all of our Philadelphia supporters over the past 28 years.
“The financial model in a market with so many sport and entertainment alternatives has proven to be unsustainable,” added French. “Finding a new venue with new strategic partners was the only way to ensure financial stability.” 

Despite being one of the oldest and most historic franchises in the league, attendance had begun to falter in the years before the Wings demise. Their attendance dropped 5% from 2011 to 2012 and then another 6% from 2012 to 2013. In February 2013 the Wings hosted a weekday game at 11 am, drawing the smallest attendance (5,139) in franchise history.

On August 4, 2014, it was reported that the Mohegan tribe would be purchasing an NLL team to play at the Mohegan Sun Arena in Uncasville, Connecticut. Two days later it was made official that French had sold half of the franchise to the Mohegans, and that the Wings would be relocating to Uncasville. The franchise would be renamed the New England Black Wolves.

Resurrection

In September 2017 the National Lacrosse League announced that Comcast-Spectacor would be the owners of an expansion franchise for the 2018–19 season. On November 29, 2017, it was announced the team would resume operations using the Wings name.

==Fan support and traditions==
Philadelphia fans were known for their passionate support of their team, and the less-than-hospitable treatment of opposing players. In a poll of the players, over 62% stated that Wings fans had screamed the filthiest and nastiest things at them in the league.

Of the fans, goaltender Rob Blasdell said &quot;They truly are the best fans in the league. They&#x27;re probably the most knowledgeable fans in the league. It would kind of be the same as playing for the Leafs in Toronto. They&#x27;re very, very passionate.&quot; Philadelphia fans enjoy the physical aspect of the game, leading Geoff Snider to comment: &quot;The Philly fans are great. They are very loyal and they get behind it. I got a standing ovation once for a roughing penalty. I&#x27;d never seen anything like that before.&quot;

Fans traditions started from the national anthem, when fans could be heard making a &#x27;tsch&#x27; sound at the end of each line, mocking a recording that was used by the Wings in the early years where the only audible portion of the song was the cymbal crashes. During the introductions of the opposing team, each player&#x27;s name was followed by a call of &quot;sucks&quot;, a tradition that has been extended to the opposing coaches, trainers, and the game officials. The local shot clock operator had escaped the jeering, and was instead cheered.

During the game, the opposing goalie was often the target of fans&#x27; heckling. The most common chant was to remind the goalies &quot;It&#x27;s all your fault&quot; after every goal they allow.

One of the more notable traditions was the dueling &quot;W-I-N-G-S&quot; cheers. The side of the arena with the penalty boxes had long been led by &quot;Chopper&quot;, a Wings superfan with face paint and a hard hat, well known around the league making opposing players who find their way to the penalty box regret their time there. The bench side went through many leaders, from &quot;Big Gabe&quot; and the little gabesters (consisting of Matt Denker, Joshua Gross, Jordan Elsas, Adam David and Eli Goldstein) (father of Scott Gabrielson, a Wings captain in the 1990s) to &quot;Big E&quot; to Chasmo, and now &quot;The Captain&quot; and &quot;Morpheus&quot; or as he made himself known as during the second half of the game on February 29, 2008, &quot;Doctor Lacrosse&quot;. The &quot;kick butt baby&quot; (Eric Kulb Martinez) was the biggest little fan even though he could barely talk. While the leader of the chants aren&#x27;t always the same from year to year, the &quot;W-I-N-G-S WINGS!&quot; cheer did not die out at all, and is still present following the team&#x27;s revival.

<text>The Arizona Sting was a professional American box lacrosse team and a member of the National Lacrosse League from 2004 to 2007. They played at Nationwide Arena in Columbus, Ohio, from 2001 to 2003 as the Columbus Landsharks, and in 2003 moved to Glendale, Arizona. The team adopted the name Sting in November 2003 and began playing in the Glendale Arena (now Desert Diamond Arena). 

In 2005, the Sting defeated the 2004 NLL champion Calgary Roughnecks to win the franchise&#x27;s first-ever West Division title. The Sting fell 19–13 to the East Division champion Toronto Rock in the league championships.

== Team history ==

On October 16, 2007, the NLL announced that the 2008 season had been cancelled due to the failure of the league and the Professional Lacrosse Players&#x27; Association to reach a new collective bargaining agreement. However, the negotiations continued and, on October 25, the league announced that a new seven-year agreement had been reached, and that the season would be played. A new schedule was announced on November 2, 2007, but only included 12 of the expected 14 teams; the Sting and Boston Blazers had been removed. According to a news article posted on the Sting website, 

Prior to the 2009 NLL season, the Arizona Sting ceased operations and its players were put in a dispersal draft.

==All time record==

==Playoff results==

* the Arizona Sting hosted the Champion&#x27;s Cup Finals at Jobing.com Arena. The Knighthawks had the overall top seed in the playoffs, but were unable to host the Championship game due to a scheduling conflict at the Blue Cross Arena.

<doc id="246394" wikidata="Q3868605" url="?curid=246394" title="Music of Zimbabwe">
<text>Zimbabwean music is heavily reliant on the use of instruments such as the mbira, Ngoma drums and hosho. Their music symbolizes much more than a simple rhythm, as the folk and pop style styled music was used as a symbol of hope for Zimbabweans looking to gain independence from Rhodesia. Music has played a significant role in the history of Zimbabwe, from a vital role in the traditional Bira ceremony used to call on ancestral spirits, to protest songs during the struggle for independence. The community in Zimbabwe used music to voice their resistance to their oppression, as one of the only weapons they had available to fight back with. In the eighties, the Music of Zimbabwe was at the center of the African Music scene thanks to genres such as Sungura and Jit. However, several performers were banned by state TV and radio leading to the closing of several music venues.

== Musical Genres ==

=== Rock ===
Some famous Zimbabwean rock bands are - Dividing The Element, Evicted, Flying Bantu and Chikwata-263.

=== Sungura ===
Sungura is the most popular musical genre in Zimbabwe. It emerged in 1953, in a time when regional identity was in formation. This is the local genre of the Zimbabwe music industry. Sungura music became popular in the early 1980s, pioneered by frontman Ephraim Joe and his band Sungura Boys which counted many notable future hit makers as members. Their roll included John Chibadura (guitar)
Simon Chimbetu (guitar and vocals) Naison Chimbetu, Ronnie Gatakata, Michel Jambo (drums), Ephraim Joe (guitar), Moses Marasha (bass), Never Moyo (lead guitar), Bata Sinfirio (rhythm guitar), System Tazvida (guitar and vocals).

The Khiama Boys emerged as natural successors to the Sungura Boys after their demise during the mid-eighties. Members would include System Tazvida (Rhythm guitar), Cephas Karushanga, Nicholas Zacharia (Lead guitar), Alick Macheso (Bass), Silas Chakanyuka (Drums) and Zacharia Zakaria (Sub Rhythm guitar). A great number of these artistes have gone on to forge successful careers with their own bands whilst Nicholas Zacharia has remained as the leader of the band and is still active as of 2008.

James Chimombe, whose romantic ballads and the influential sungura guitar melody (consisting of lead, rhythm and bass), made him a favorite in the late 80s. Other notable artists include Zexie Manatsa, Tinei Chikupo, Paul Matavire, Zvishavane Sounds and Jonah Moyo&#x27;s Devera Ngwena, among others.

The 90s decade was dominated by musicians such as Leonard Dembo, the effervescent Khiama Boys, veteran Simon Chimbetu and then upcoming artistes Alick Macheso, Tongai Moyo and Somandla Ndebele. One of the stars of the decade was Leonard Zhakata, whose musical project was a spinoff of the double play Maungwe Brothers, an act fronted by Zhakata and his cousin Thomas Makion. Other popular acts included Pengaudzoke, the Wrist Brothers, Zimbabwe Chachacha Kings, Aaron Chinamira, King Pharao, Hosiah Chipanga, Stabien Mawire and Paul Mpofu, to mention a few. The decade 2000 till present has been characterised by a wrangle for the crown for the kingship of Sungura between the two most prominent Sungura musicians of the decade, Alick Macheso and Tongai Moyo. Having dominated sales, tour and concert attendances, the heckling and counter-heckling by the artists at shows and in some recorded material is strong proof of their feud akin to the BIG vs Tupac in American &#x27;90s hip hop. 

Other artists to come through this decade include Joseph Garakara, Suluman Chimbetu (son of Simon), Allan Chimbetu (Simon&#x27;s brother), Tryson Chimbetu (Naison&#x27;s son), Cephas Mashakada, Gift Amuli, Howard and Tatenda Pinjisi, First Farai as well as Josphat and Daiton Somanje, the Pengaudzoke frontmen who were pursuing solo careers. Alick Macheso has largely dominated the scene, creating popular dance choreographies such as &#x27;Borrowdale&#x27;, Razor Wire, zoraaa butter, femba bute and kedebu, which mimic everyday routines in Zimbabwean life. A new generation of Sungura artists is emerging, largely influenced by Macheso&#x27;s distinct style of a leading bass guitar. This generation includes artists like Mark Ngwazi, Tendai Ngwazi, Peter Moyo (son of Tongai), Simon Mutambi, Romeo Gasa, Sugar Sugar, Jacob Moyana and Francis &#x27;Slomo&#x27; Dhaka among others. The genre is increasingly getting international recognition with some non-natives trying it out. Notable among these are Eirik Hoff Walmsiness &#x27;Eriki&#x27; from Norway and Indian Dhyaan Kumar.

System Tazvida, Simon Chimbetu, James Chimombe, Tongai Moyo, Paul Matavire, John Chibadura, Leonard Dembo, and Thomas Makion have all died. It&#x27;s also worth noting that a new wave of Sungura, dubbed Trap Sungura, has emerged in Zimbabwe, fueled by Tanto Wavie.

=== Imbube ===

Imbube was created by Zimbabweans while they were still technically a part of Rhodesian culture. This genre consisted of male singers in an acapella style, which differed from most of the typical music at the time that was formed around unique instruments. During this time period, many of the Zimbabwe men worked in mines for long hours. They formed Imbube by singing along together as a means of passing the time. The vocals coming from the caves echoed to produce better quality, and encouraged the men to continue singing these happy tunes. Occasionally the miners would sing songs of social justice, but a majority were generally happy and used as entertainment.

===Jit===
Jit, also known as &quot;Harare beat&quot;, is a generic term for electric guitar-driven pop, and includes popular acts like the New Black Eagles, Mike Mopo and the Four Brothers (a band UK radio DJ John Peel described as &quot;the best live band in the world&quot;). Internationally, The Bhundu Boys are by far the best-known jit performers, and have worked with numerous American and British musicians. Notable recent bands to come up with the Jit sound are Nehoreka who fuse the traditional Jit with funk sounds, there is also Mokoomba and Q Montana. The 1990 film Jit was named for this style.

=== Afro jazz (Zimbabwean jazz) ===
Zimbabwean jazz, also known as Afro Jazz, is Zimbabwean music influenced by a style of township rhythm that evolved in a Southern part of Africa over the last century. One can also trace similarities from Kwela, a pennywhistle-based, street music from the southern part of Africa with jazzy underpinnings and a distinctive, skiffle-like beat. It is also closely related to Marabi which was the name given to a keyboard style (often using cheap pedal organs) that had a musical link to American jazz, ragtime and blues, with roots deep in the African tradition. Early marabi musicians were part of an underground musical culture and were typically not recorded. An example of such an artist in the early 1940s is August Musarurwa of the Skokiaan fame. It has continued to develop and traits of this music can be seen in the works of his grandson, Prince Kudakwashe Musarurwa.

The Pakare Paye Centre has worked for spreading Zimbabwean Jazz to young musicians since 2004, founded by Afro-Jazz musician Oliver Mtukudzi.

===Chimurenga music===

Chimurenga music is a genre developed by Thomas Mapfumo named for the Shona language word for struggle. Mapfumo and his band, the Blacks Unlimited developed a style of music based on traditional mbira music, but played with modern electric instrumentation, with lyrics characterized by social and political commentary. Mapfumo&#x27;s music was a &quot;tool of the liberation war&quot; criticizing the Rhodesian government of Ian Smith, but shifted after independence to speaking out about perceived corruption and mismanagement of the Zimbabwean government of Robert Mugabe.

===Tuku Music===
Tuku Mtukudzi was a prolific recorder who also appeared in films like &quot;Jit&quot;. He played in a plethora of styles, and was known for penetrating lyrics; for example, he wrote a second song about AIDS in Zimbabwe after Paul Matavire&#x27;s hit song &quot;Yakauya AIDS iriko&quot;.

=== Zimdancehall===
Zimdancehall is Zimbabwean music influenced by Jamaican dancehall music, it is also known as Mangoma. There is frequent debate around the origin Zimdancehall within Zimbabwe. Notable Zimdancehall performers include Winky D and Soul Jah love.

===Rumba===
African Rumba, or &#x27;Soukos&#x27; is mostly associated with the Democratic Republic of the Congo but its popularity has inspired Zimbabwe&#x27;s own brand of rumba in musicians such as Simon Chimbetu, Papa Jose and Leonard Karikoga Zhakata. Soukos has been an influence on other artists such as The R.U.N.N. family.

===Gospel===
Gospel music became popular in Zimbabwe in the late 1980s. Jonathan Wutawunashe has been described as &quot;Zimbabwe&#x27;s first real gospel star&quot;. Other population musicians in this genre include Jordan Chataika, Freedom Sengwayo, Mechanic Manyeruke, and Brian Sibalo.

The early nineties saw the rising of new gospel stars in the mold of Ivy Kombo - Moyo and Carol Mujokoro of the EGEA gospel Train whose debut album Mufudzi Wangu was released in 1993 and contains tracks such as &quot;Be Thou My Vision&quot;, &quot;Ndotarisa Kumakomo&quot; and &quot;Utiziro&quot; among others. The two went on to pursue successful solo musical careers and released &quot;Ndaidziwanepi Nyasha&quot; and &quot;Ropa RaJesu&quot; as their debut solo albums respectively.

Gospel artists who emerged from the mid nineties include Pastor Haisa (Lawrence Haisa), Brother Sam with his hits &quot;Makanaka Jesu&quot; and &quot;Cherechedza&quot;, Elias Musakwa, Rita Shonhiwa, The Gospel Trumpet of the &quot;Rose Of Sharon&quot; fame and Shingisai Suluma who only became popular in the early 21st century with the hit song &quot;Mirira Mangwanani&quot;; though she first recorded in the nineties.

In the late-nineties, Charles Charamba, a rising artist, grew in popularity, and currently holds gospel sales records. His music became popular into the first decade of the 21st century, most likely due to his Sungura-based contemporary style.

In the early 21st century, a lot of gospel artists also recorded, though a few really rose to stardom. These include Fungisai Zvakavapano - Mashavave who has risen to become the most dominant female gospel musician in the current era, Stanley Gwanzura (Pastor Gee), Kudzai Nyakudya, Tembalami, and gospel a cappella outfits like Vabati VaJehovah and Shower Power.

== Instruments ==
===Mbira===
The mbira is an integral part of Zimbabwean music. Classified by musicologists as a lamellaphone, part of the plucked idiophone family, it is created from things found in nature such as a wooden board (often fitted with a resonator) and tines. It is frequently played in a &quot;deze&quot; (calabash resonator) which amplifies the sound and augments using shells or bottle caps placed around the edges. Often accompanied by the hosho, a percussion instrument, the mbira is often an important instrument that people play at religious ceremonies, weddings, and other social gatherings. The mbira plays a central role in the traditional Bira ceremony used to call on ancestral spirits.

The instrument is a central piece in their religious rituals. The most important function of mbira is the idea of it being a &quot;telephone to the spirits&quot; during ceremonies. It is the sole way of communication between the living and deceased ancestors, ancient tribal guardians, or guardian spirits. The mbira is required to ask these spirits to bring rain during drought, stop rain during floods, accept their offerings, ask for forgiveness, and bring clouds when crops are damaged by the sun. These instruments were made from resources from the land which connected them further connects the indigenous people to their land and this deep connection has helped communities in Zimbabwe to continue their tradition of mbira music despite the development of colonialism. 

The sound made by this instrument closely imitates the noises made by rain or running water with rich and vibrant tones &quot;like bells&quot;. The sound has a special presence; one that feel the music as much as one hears it. Penetrating and warming at the same time, immediately capturing the involvement of the listeners and drawing them into its mood. The pieces of music played vary by the artist but there is no specific way to play this instrument. The music performed is all about elaboration and variation supporting creative expression of the performer.


Though musicologist Hugh Tracey believed the mbira to be nearing extinction in the 1930s, the instrument has been revived since the 60s and 70s, and has gained an international following through the world music scene. Some renowned mbira players include Dumisani Maraire, Ephat Mujuru, Stella Chiweshe, Chartwell Dutiro, Mbuya Dyoko, Cosmas Magaya, Tute Chigamba, Forward Kwenda, and Chiwoniso Maraire.
There is also pop music in Zimbabwe and around the world that incorporates Zimbabwean indigenous instruments. For example, mbira player Chris Berry with his band Panjea have reached platinum record sales in Zimbabwe and Mozambique, playing a style of music based on traditional mbira rhythms and melodies, but incorporating various other instruments and styles (like hip-hop and dancehall). Thomas Mapfumo is widely credited with popularizing his genre of Chimurenga music, which includes guitar, drums, Western-style vocals, and mbira in the same band. Mapfumo is also famous for his arrangement of traditional mbira lines to be played on the electric guitar. Mbira is incorporated into the music of critically acclaimed American hip-hop duo Shabazz Palaces by Tendai Maraire (son of traditional mbira player Dumisani Maraire).

=== Marimba ===
The marimba was introduced in Zimbabwean Music during the early 1960s when the Kwanongoma College of African Music in Bulawayo adopted it. Founders of the college considered that marimba could boost the musical development of the country, and design a model that it&#x27;s now known as Kwanongoma marimba. Zimbabwean marimba or Kwanongoma marimba is now considered part of the Zimbabwean culture.

The first Zimbabwean marimba was built by Nelson Jones in 1962. However, the wood used was too soft. The next year, Josiah Siyembe Mathe started using a Lozi instrument called Selimba, common in the southwest of Zambia. The original Selimba was an 11-key instrument. Mathe built later a soprano, a tenor, and a bass. using Mukwa wood for the keys.

Michael Bhule built the first set of Kwanongoma marimba. Alport Mhlanga composed the first repertoire for the instrument.

==Bulawayo==
The Ndebele-dominated region of the southwest of Zimbabwe, including the city Bulawayo, has been instrumental in the development of Zimbabwean music. Seminal 1950s guitarist George Sibanda had a following across Africa and was the writer for the hit song Guabi Guabi which is sung all over the world, and Dorothy Masuka was a major player on the South African jazz scene, for example. Among the most popular performers of the region within Zimbabwe, however, was 1980s Ndebele pop sensation Lovemore Majaivana. Ndebele musicians who are active are Black Umfolosi, Insingizi Majahawodwa Ndlovu, Sandra Ndebele, Lwazi Tshabangu, Kuxxman, Go Boyz, Achuzi, Beatar Mangethe, Vusa Mkhaya, Afrika Revenge and Ramadu. The marginalisation of Bulawayo artists in Zimbabwe saw the influence of South African music dominating hence the emergence of kwaito music in Bulawayo pioneered by Go-Boyz in 1996 and more groups like GTI, Achuzi, Amagangsters, artists like Cal Vin etc., emerged. A brand of Jazz was created in Bulawayo, in the 1940s and 1950s, and was made popular by August Musarurwa with his African Dance Band of the Cold Storage Commission of Southern Rhodesia. He recorded the legendary song Sikokiana which went on to be recorded in USA by Louis Armstrong and many others.

==Lyrics==
Zimbabwean musicians&#x27; lyrics mostly contain encouragement of upholding good social values in the family and society as whole. Such lyrics can be seen in songs by artists like Oliver Mtukudzi, Simon Chimbetu and Suluman Chimbetu the Harare 10-piece Afro-fusion band &quot;Nehoreka&quot;, Louis Mhlanga, John Chibadura, Steve Makoni, and Bhundu Boys. However, the lyrics of Thomas Mapfumo are political, praising just leadership and encouraging rising up against bad governance. Many of his albums are named after a word meaning &quot;uprising&quot; or &quot;war of liberation&quot;: &quot;Chimurenga&quot;. His music earned him the wrath of the ZANU-PF government resulting in the banning of most of his music on state owned radio and TV. Another musician with striking lyrics is the late System Tazvida of the Chazezesa Challengers. His lyrics were mostly centered on love and relationships, with songs like &quot;Anodyiwa Haataure&quot;, &quot;Ukarambwa Usachema&quot;, &quot;Vanotipedzera Mashoko&quot; and &quot;Dai Hanzvadzi Yairoorwa&quot;, with which he achieved popularity.
With the emergence of the Urban Grooves-style, the content of lyrics shifted to more closely resemble that of American RnB, Hip Hop and Pop music. These have garnered a following among a younger generation of Zimbabweans. One artist, Maskiri, is known for imitating Eminem&#x27;s style of controversial lyrics.

==Urban Grooves==

Coming on the music scene in the late 1990s and early 2000s, Urban Grooves takes in American Rap, Hip Hop, R&amp;B, Soul and other international music genres, often melded with traditional Zimbabwean music.

Artists such as Sanii Makhalima, Alexio Kawara, Roy and Royce, David Chifunyise, Leonard Mapfumo, Roki, Stach, Betty Makaya, Extra Large, Maskiri, Kactus and Nehoreka laid the groundwork for the new genre, which gained increasing popularity among the youth. The style was helped by the 100% local content policy in effect at the time, which required all radio stations to play only music by Zimbabwean artists.

A second generation of artists such as Trevor Dongo, Drum Dada, Q Montana, Mokoomba and Nehoreka have come to prominence more recently.

<text>A commandery () was a historical administrative division of China that was in use from the Eastern Zhou (c. 7th century BCE) until the early Tang dynasty (c. 7th century CE). Several neighboring countries adopted Chinese commanderies as the basis for their own administrative divisions.

==History and development==
===China===

====Eastern Zhou====
During the Eastern Zhou&#x27;s Spring and Autumn period from the 8th to 5th centuries BCE, the larger and more powerful of the Zhou&#x27;s vassal states—including Qin, Jin and Wei—began annexing their smaller rivals. These new lands were not part of their original fiefs and were instead organized into counties (&quot;xiàn&quot;). Eventually, commanderies were developed as marchlands between the major realms. Despite having smaller populations and ranking lower on the official hierarchies, the commanderies were larger and boasted greater military strength than the counties.

As each state&#x27;s territory gradually took shape in the 5th- to 3rd-century BCE Warring States period, the commanderies at the borders flourished. This gave rise to a two-tier administrative system, with counties subordinate to commanderies. Each of the states&#x27; territories was by now comparatively larger, hence there was no need for the military might of a commandery in the inner regions where counties were established. The border commanderies&#x27; military and strategic significance became more important than those of counties.

====Qin dynasty====
Following the unification of China in 221 BCE under the Qin Empire, the Qin government still had to engage in military activity because there were rebels from among the six former states who were unwilling to submit to Qin rule. As a result, Qin Shi Huangdi set up 36 commanderies in the Qin Empire, each subdivided into counties. This established the first two-tier administrative system known to exist in China.

====Han dynasty and Three Kingdoms period====

When the Han dynasty triumphed over Chu in 206 BCE, the Zhou feudal system was initially reinstated, with Emperor Gaozu recognizing nearly independent kings and granting large territories to his relatives. These two sets of kingdoms were placed under hereditary rulers assisted by a chancellor (&quot;xiàng&quot;). Parallel to these, some Qin commanderies were continued, placed under a governor appointed directly by the central government.

By the Eastern Han dynasty, the commanderies were subordinated to a new division, the province (&quot;zhōu&quot;). — establishing a three-tier system composed of provinces, commanderies, and counties. Based upon legendary accounts of the Yellow Emperor&#x27;s Nine Provinces which were geographic rather than formal political areas, there were initially 13 provinces and roughly 100 commanderies.

====Jin dynasty and the Southern and Northern dynasties====
China was greatly divided during the following five centuries, during the Jin and Northern and Southern dynasties period. The number of administrative units drastically increased due to intense warfare, fluid political boundaries, forced migrations, widespread population loss, and the loss of central government control in many areas particularly during the Sixteen Kingdoms. Although the legacy three-tier system was still in formal effect, rulers of various kingdoms had defined and re-defined provinces until they became increasingly sub-divided, blurring the distinction between provinces and commanderies and reflecting the chaos of China at the time.

====Sui and Tang dynasties====
China was finally re-united by Emperor Wen of the Sui (581–618) in 589. As there were already over 100 provinces, the province and commandery levels of the administration were merged into one level, typically rendered in English as prefecture, marking the end of the commandery. Some Emperors to referred to this level of administration as a &quot;jun&quot; (&quot;commandery&quot;), but most used &quot;zhou&quot; (&quot;province&quot;) and the political function was the same, regardless. By the end of the Tang dynasty the term &quot;jun&quot; saw no more use in China (and a new higher tier of administrative unit, the circuit had been introduced, bringing back a three-tier system).

==Administrative hierarchy==
In the Warring States period, the chief administrative officers of the areas were known as commandery administrators (). In the Han dynasty, the position of &quot;junshou&quot; was renamed grand administrator (). Both terms are also translated as &quot;governor&quot;. A grand administrator drew an annual salary of 2,000 &quot;dan&quot; () of grain according to the &quot;pinzhi&quot; () system of administrative rank. Many former grand administrators were promoted to the posts of the Three Ducal Ministers or Nine Ministers later in their careers.

<text>The Toronto Rock are a Canadian professional box lacrosse team based in the Greater Toronto Area that competes in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The team was the first Canadian franchise in the NLL. The Rock play their home games at the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, Ontario.

The franchise was founded in 1998 as the Ontario Raiders in Hamilton. The Raiders played at Copps Coliseum before being sold to a group of investors led by then Toronto Maple Leafs Assistant GM Bill Watters, who relocated the franchise to Toronto. They were subsequently renamed the &quot;Toronto Rock&quot;, and began play at Maple Leaf Gardens in the 1999 season. The Toronto Rock won their 6th league championship on May 15, 2011. They hold a tie for the most championships in league history with the Philadelphia Wings and the Buffalo Bandits. In the 2001 season, the Rock moved from the Maple Leaf Gardens to Scotiabank Arena (then known as Air Canada Centre) where they played for 20 seasons. On May 11, 2021, the team announced the relocation from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto to FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, beginning with the 2021–22 NLL season in December. The team continues to represent Toronto while playing home games in Hamilton. The Rock temporarily relocated to Mississauga for the 2025 season while the FirstOntario Centre is closed for renovations.

==History==
The franchise was founded as an NLL expansion team in Hamilton, Ontario and began play in the 1998 season. They were known as the Ontario Raiders, and played their home games at Copps Coliseum. Former Buffalo Bandits coach Les Bartley was hired to coach the new team, and he lured former Bandit Jim Veltman to join him, becoming the Raiders&#x27; captain. The team finished a respectable 6–6 in their inaugural season, but missed the playoffs on a tie-breaker. Following the season, losses of $250,000 forced owner Chris Fritz to look for partners. Maple Leaf Sports &amp; Entertainment considered purchasing the team, but ultimately a group which included Bill Watters, the then Assistant General Manager of the Toronto Maple Leafs, Paul Beeston, former president of the Toronto Blue Jays, Tie Domi, player for the Maple Leafs, and Bobby Orr, former NHL player, bought it for $250,000 and promptly relocated the team to Toronto&#x27;s Maple Leaf Gardens where they rebranded it the Toronto Rock, a name chosen to reflect the city&#x27;s lively rock music scene.

===Championships/Dynasty era (1999–2005)===
In 1999, their first year in Toronto, the Rock won their first NLL Championship, defeating the Rochester Knighthawks 13–10 in Toronto. The next year, the Rock became the first team since the 1994-95 Wings to win back-to-back championships, once again defeating the Knighthawks. That game featured Kaleb Toth&#x27;s dramatic game-winning goal with a second left on the clock, in the last-ever professional sporting event held at Maple Leaf Gardens.

2001 saw the Rock follow the Leafs to the Air Canada Centre, where they advanced to the championship game once again. But the visiting Philadelphia Wings held the Rock to just eight goals, and won their sixth championship. The next season, the Rock recovered from the championship game loss by finishing first overall for the fourth straight year. They advanced to the championship game once again, but for the first time as the visiting team. The Rock defeated the Albany Attack in Albany 13–12. 2002 was also one of the most productive years for the Rock in terms of awards; in addition to winning the Champion&#x27;s Cup, three players were honoured by the league. Blaine Manning was named Rookie of the Year, Pat Coyle was named Defensive Player of the Year, and captain Jim Veltman was given the Sportsmanship Award.

In 2003, Toronto advanced to the championship game for the fifth straight year, once again as the visitors. The game was held in Rochester, where Rock had never won a game, but they prevailed in the lowest-scoring championship game in NLL history, winning 8–6.

Shortly before the 2004 season began, head coach and GM Les Bartley announced that he was fighting colon cancer, and was stepping down. Assistant coaches Ed Comeau and Derek Keenan were named interim coach and interim GM respectively. After a 2–4 start to the season, Comeau and Keenan were fired, and the Rock hired Terry Sanderson to try to turn the team around. The Rock went 8-2 the rest of the season, earning a first round bye after clinching the East Division regular season crown. However, the Buffalo Bandits came to town and upset the Rock 19–10, sending the Bandits to the first NLL championship game &quot;not&quot; featuring the Rock since they joined the league. Jim Veltman was honoured by the league by being named league MVP. This was the first year in the 10-year history of the award that it did not go to Gary Gait, Paul Gait, or John Tavares and the first Toronto Rock player to be named league MVP.

In 2005, the Rock defeated the Rochester Knighthawks in the East Division Final by a score of 12–10 in front of approximately 17,200 fans at the Air Canada Centre. The Rock went on to defeat the Arizona Sting with a 19–13 win in front of an NLL record crowd of 19,432, becoming NLL champions for the fifth time in seven years and solidifying their distinction as an NLL dynasty. Colin Doyle was named league MVP, the second straight year that the award was won by a Rock player.

Despite the championship, the season ended on a sad note for the Rock franchise, as Les Bartley died of cancer at the age of 51 the day after the championship game. Bartley is remembered as an exceptional coach, having led the Toronto Rock to NLL Championships in 1999, 2000, 2002, and 2003.

In 2004, the NLL Coach of the Year Award was renamed the Les Bartley Award in honour of Bartley.

===Kloepfer era (2006–2009)===
From 1999 to 2005, the Rock finished either first overall or first in their division every year, winning five championships. The next few years, however, would bring the franchise back down to Earth. The Rock struggled during the early part of the 2006 season; however, their record balanced out to 8–8 at season&#x27;s end. They made the playoffs, only to be defeated by the first place Knighthawks at Blue Cross Arena in Rochester by a score of 16–8. Head coach and GM Terry Sanderson was fired after the season, and was replaced by new Director of Lacrosse Operations Mike Kloepfer and new head coach Glenn Clark. Clark had played eight seasons with the Rock and had just finished an All-Star season as a member of the Philadelphia Wings, but retired from playing to take the head coaching job with his old club.

Kloepfer made his mark on the team quickly, trading perennial All-Star, former Rookie of the Year and league MVP Colin Doyle to the San Jose Stealth along with Darren Halls and a draft pick for first overall draft pick Ryan Benesch, Kevin Fines, Chad Thompson and two draft picks. Benesch had a very good rookie year, scoring 33 goals and winning the Rookie of the Year award, but the Rock under rookie coach Clark struggled to a worst-ever 6–10 record, barely making the playoffs. They lost the division semifinal against Rochester, who would go on to win their first championship since 1997.

In 2007, the Toronto Rock established an award also called the Les Bartley Award, given to &quot;the Rock player that best exemplifies Les&#x27; emphasis on the importance of character and commitment to the team&quot;. The first winner of this award was team captain Jim Veltman.

Toronto&#x27;s struggles continued in 2008, as the Rock lost their last five games of the season. They finished below .500 for the second straight year, and for the first time since their move to Toronto in 1999, the Rock finished out of the playoffs. Despite the losing season, goaltender Bob Watson was named Goaltender of the Year. 2008 also featured the final season of the only captain the Rock franchise had ever had, Jim Veltman. Veltman retired after fifteen seasons in the NLL, winning seven championships (two with the Bandits and five with the Rock). Chris Driscoll was named the new Rock captain.

After starting the 2009 season with a 1–2 record, the Rock relieved Clark and assistant coach Veltman and Terry Bullen of their coaching duties, and hired former Chicago and Colorado coach Jamie Batley as the new Rock head coach. Clark and Bullen were fired, and Veltman was retained in an advisory position. The coaching change was not enough to propel the Rock back into the playoffs, however. They finished last in the East and out of the playoffs for the second straight year. Director of Lacrosse Operations Mike Kloepfer resigned shortly after the season ended.

===Jamie Dawick era (2009–present)===
On June 10, 2009, the Rock announced that former GM and coach Terry Sanderson had been brought back as the new GM. Jamie Batley was also told by the Rock that he would not be returning as head coach. At the end of the month, the team announced that the Rock had been sold to Oakville-based businessman James Dawick, with Waters saying the price was &quot;in the seven figures.&quot; Two weeks later, former Calgary Roughnecks head coach Troy Cordingley was named as the new coach, giving the Rock an entirely new staff from ownership on down.

Sanderson wasted no time in the rebuilding efforts, most notably re-acquiring Colin Doyle from Washington in exchange for Lewis Ratcliff, Tyler Codron and Joel Dalgarno.
He also traded Luke Wiles to Washington and Bill McGlone to Philadelphia, and re-acquiring former Rock defender Sandy Chapman from Rochester. He then traded team captain Chris Driscoll to the Buffalo Bandits for another former Rock defender Phil Sanderson, and acquired Mike Hominuck from Edmonton and Pat McCready from Buffalo, both for draft picks.

The moves paid off immediately, as the Rock began the 2010 season 6-1 en route to a 9–7 record. This was good for second place in the East and the Rock&#x27;s first playoff berth in four years. In the playoffs, the Rock defeated Buffalo and Orlando on their way to their seventh Championship game, and first since 2005. The Washington Stealth, in their first season in Everett, Washington, proved too strong for the Rock and won the Championship 15–11.

In 2011, the Rock found themselves in the Championship game for the second straight year against the Washington Stealth, this time winning 8–7.

In August 2011, Dawick broke ground on constructing the new $20 million-dollar, privately financed Toronto Rock Athletic Centre (TRAC) in Oakville. The lacrosse facility, which opened in 2012, features two pads, one of which seats 500 fans, and serves as the Rock&#x27;s practice facility as well as the team&#x27;s offices. The arena has played host to exhibition NLL games, the NLL Entry Draft and the NLL Combine.

On May 11, 2021, Dawick announced that the Rock would relocate from Scotiabank Arena in Toronto to FirstOntario Centre in Hamilton, Ontario with a five-year arena lease with an option to extend the agreement afterwards. Their relocation will commence in time for the beginning of the 2022 NLL season in December 2021. The team name will not be changed despite the relocation to Hamilton due their branding as a team that has &quot;always represented the GTHA&quot;.

It was originally announced that beginning in January 2024, the Rock would need to temporarily relocate their home games to the Paramount Fine Foods Centre in Mississauga, Ontario, as following their home games in December 2023 Hamilton&#x27;s FirstOntario Centre would close for renovations for approximately two years. This also forced the Bulldogs and Honey Badgers to temporarily and permanently relocate to Brantford and Brampton, respectively. However, in September 2023 it was announced that the renovations would be delayed and that the Toronto Rock would play the entirety of the 2023/24 season in Hamilton before temporarily relocating to Mississauga for the following season until the renovations are completed.

<text>Hip Young Guitar Slinger is a compilation album of Jimmy Page&#x27;s pre-Led Zeppelin studio sessions, recorded between 1962 and 1966. It was released on 4 September 2000.

==Background==
It is not certain whether Page actually played on every track. For instance, the history section of the Lancastrians&#x27; official website specifically states that he did not play on &quot;We&#x27;ll Sing in the Sunshine&quot; – although he did play on the B-side, &quot;Was She Tall&quot;.

Likewise, officially Page has been credited with playing acoustic twelve string guitar on two tracks on The Kinks&#x27; debut album, specifically on &quot;I&#x27;m a Lover Not a Fighter&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Been Driving On Bald Mountain&quot;, and possibly on the B-side &quot;I Gotta Move&quot;, but not on &quot;Bald Headed Woman&quot; or &quot;Revenge&quot;. Page appeared on the album &quot;Kinky Music&quot; by the &quot;Larry Page Orchestra&quot; on which the track &quot;Revenge&quot; was covered Larry Page, being the Kinks&#x27; then manager and co-writer of &quot;Revenge&quot;.

Many tracks of this collection (on disc 2) are from the 1968/69 &quot;Blues Anytime&quot; series.

<text>The Montreal Express was a member of the National Lacrosse League during the 2002 season. They played at the Molson Centre in Montreal, Quebec. They were inactive during the 2003 and 2004 seasons. The team remained inactive and the franchise was returned to the NLL after the 2004 season. The NLL in turn sold the rights to the franchise to the Minnesota Swarm for the 2005 NLL season.

The first-ever Express game was a record-setting affair, with the Express defeating their expansion cousins the Calgary Roughnecks by a final score of 32-17. New NLL records for most goals by one team (32), most goals by two teams (49), and most penalty minutes by two teams (155) were all set in this game.

<doc id="246407" wikidata="Q7720517" url="?curid=246407" title="The Bugaloos">
<text>The Bugaloos is an American children&#x27;s television series, produced by brothers Sid and Marty Krofft, that aired on NBC on Saturday mornings from 1970 to 1972. Reruns of the show aired in daily syndication from 1978 to 1985 as part of the &quot;Krofft Superstars&quot; package with six other Krofft series. The show features a musical group composed of four British teenagers in insect-themed outfits, constantly beset by the evil machinations of the talent-challenged Benita Bizarre, played by comedian Martha Raye.

==Premise==
The show takes place in the fantasy setting of Tranquility Forest. The central characters are teenage musicians who&#x27;ve formed a pop band named the Bugaloos. The foursome are human, mostly, although they have antennae and actual wings. While occasionally seen air-surfing on leaves, they more usually fly unaided. On the ground, the Bugaloos are sometimes seen traveling around in their &quot;Bugaloo Buggy&quot;, a colorful dune buggy custom-made for the show by car builder George Barris. Other bands mentioned in the show include Blood, Sweat &amp; Soap. 

Peace-loving and hippie-like, the Bugaloos are pursued by the feathered yet flightless Benita Bizarre, who envies the Bugaloos&#x27; ability to fly as much as their ability to create good music.

==Characters==
===The Bugaloos===

* I.Q. (portrayed by John McIndoe) – A grasshopper who plays the guitar and sings lead vocals.
* Harmony (portrayed by Wayne Laryea) – A bumblebee who plays the keyboard and sings backup vocals.
* Courage (portrayed by John Philpott) – A ladybug who plays the drums and sings backup vocals.
* Joy (portrayed by Caroline Ellis) – A butterfly who plays percussion and also sings lead and backup vocals.

===Villains===
* Benita Bizarre (portrayed by Martha Raye) – A jealous, untalented, unattractive, old crone who is the main antagonist of the series who sports a feathered outfit. Benita lives in a gigantic jukebox and uses it to broadcast her own brand of blaring, obnoxious, unpleasant &quot;music&quot;. A dreadful singer, Benita is furious at the popularity of the Bugaloos&#x27; more melodic, upbeat sound. Pitting her technology against their nature, she plots elaborate, unsuccessful schemes to either destroy or enslave them, frequently making use of a powerful ultrasonic weapon called the Stereo Zapper which renders its victim unconscious in seconds. In Episode 2, she steals Joy Bugaloo&#x27;s voice. In Episode 6, she almost succeeds in amputating I.Q.&#x27;s wings with the aim of achieving flight herself. Happily, her schemes never cause permanent harm. Raye also appeared the same year in the &quot;H.R. Pufnstuf&quot; movie as the Boss Witch, which led to her getting the role of Benita.
** Funky Rat (performed by Sharon Baird, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – Benita&#x27;s German-accented chauffeur and chief flunky. The Funky Rat costume was also used for essentially the same role as Boss Witch&#x27;s chauffeur Heinrich Rat in &quot;Pufnstuf&quot;.
** Woofer and Tweeter (performed by Joy Campbell and Van Snowden, voiced by Walker Edmiston and Joan Gerber) – Two anthropomorphic stereo speakers who are Benita&#x27;s two bumbling, sycophantic henchmen.

===Supporting characters===
* Sparky (performed by Billy Barty, voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A firefly whom the Bugaloos took in.
* Nutty Bird (voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A local messenger who periodically delivers messages to and from the Bugaloos.
* Peter Platter (voiced by Walker Edmiston) – A DJ for radio station KOOK in nearby Rock City.
**Mike (voiced by Joan Gerber) – Peter Platters&#x27;s smart-alecky talking microphone.
* Magico The Magician (voiced by Walker Edmiston impersonating Ed Wynn) – A frog magician and hypnotist extraordinaire.
* Gina Lolawattage (voiced by Joan Gerber impersonating Mae West) – A firefly singer and actress who becomes smitten with her #1 fan Sparky.
* Bluebell Flower (voiced by Joan Gerber) – A giant talking flower who alerts the Bugaloos of impending danger, such as Benita&#x27;s latest schemes, serving as their &quot;alarm bell&quot;.
* The Grapevine (voiced by Joan Gerber and Walker Edmiston) – A bunch of talking grapes on a vine who aid Bluebell in giving the Bugaloos the latest bad news (a visual take on the hit Motown song &quot;I Heard it Through the Grapevine&quot;).

==Episodes==
==Production and airing==
Touted as the British version of &quot;The Monkees,&quot; &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; attracted more than 5,000 young actors and actresses to audition in spring 1970 for the show&#x27;s four lead roles, each having to demonstrate aptitude in dance, singing and acting.

Among those auditioning were Elton John&#x27;s future manager John Reid and Phil Collins, who joined the art rock band Genesis later that year. Reid and Collins were two of the three finalists for the role of &quot;I.Q.&quot; given to Scottish musician John McIndoe. &quot;If one of those guys had gotten it instead of me, rock-&#x27;n&#x27;-roll history might have changed,&quot; McIndoe later joked. &quot;Whenever I see them, I say, &#x27;Hey guys, you were lucky you didn&#x27;t get the part&#x27;.&quot;

The show was taped in Los Angeles, California. Seventeen episodes of the series were produced. Like its predecessor, &quot;H. R. Pufnstuf&quot; (1969), &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; ran for only one season (1970–1971) on NBC, with reruns airing the following year (1971–1972). Following production of the first season, the Kroffts tried shooting for a second season and also had a movie deal in the works with Columbia Pictures. However, miscommunication with the actors resulted in their returning to the UK that December against the Kroffts&#x27; wishes. As a result, a potential second season was ultimately scrapped, along with plans for a movie which was shelved due to the bankruptcy of Columbia Pictures.

Although the show featured British actors, it was not widely screened in the U.K.. for example Yorkshire Television and Tyne-Tees Television transmitted the series at lunchtime on Saturdays from late 1971 to early 1972. 

&quot;The Bugaloos&quot; was fitted with an adult laugh track, as was common practice at the time — the inclusion of which the Kroffts were initially against. Sid Krofft commented &quot;We were sort of against that, but Si Rose — being in sitcoms — he felt that when the show was put together that the children would not know when to laugh.&quot; Marty Krofft added &quot;the bottom line — it&#x27;s sad — you gotta tell them when it&#x27;s funny. And the laugh track, (Si) was right. It was necessary, as much as we were always looking to have a &quot;real&quot; laugh track, &quot;a real&quot; audience. In comedies, if you don&#x27;t have them (laugh track), you&#x27;re in big trouble, because if you don&#x27;t hear a laugh track, it&#x27;s not funny. And that&#x27;s the way the audience (at home) was programmed to view these shows.&quot; When discussing the show&#x27;s production techniques for the DVD commentary track in 2006, series stars Caroline Ellis and John Philpott addressed the laugh track. &quot;I was never one for the American canned laughter, because sometimes it&#x27;s too much,&quot; said Ellis. She added, however, that it does help in creating &quot;the atmosphere for the reaction.&quot; Philpott added that, unlike their UK counterparts, US viewing audiences at the time had become accustomed to hearing laughter, saying, &quot;I think you find yourself genuinely laughing more if you are prompted to laugh along with the canned laughter.&quot;

==Music==
The show&#x27;s music director was Hal Yoergler, who also wrote many of the show&#x27;s songs and produced the &quot;Bugaloos&quot; album released in 1970. The title song&#x27;s lyrics were written by Norman Gimbel, and its music was composed by Charles Fox. Gimbel and Fox were also the songwriters of &quot;Killing Me Softly with His Song&quot; and the theme songs to films and programs such as &quot;Last American Hero&quot; (&quot;I Got a Name,&quot; sung by Jim Croce), &quot;Happy Days,&quot; &quot;Laverne and Shirley,&quot; and &quot;The New Adventures of Wonder Woman.&quot; A cover of the Bugaloos theme performed by Collective Soul is included on the 1995 tribute album &quot;Saturday Morning: Cartoons&#x27; Greatest Hits,&quot; produced by Ralph Sall for MCA Records.

The Bugaloos released an album in 1970 (Capitol Records ST-621), featuring studio-recorded versions of some of the songs performed on the show. The track list is as follows:

Side 1
# &quot;If You Become a Bugaloo&quot;
# &quot;The Senses of Our World&quot;
# &quot;For a Friend&quot;
# &quot;Believe&quot;
# &quot;It&#x27;s New to You&quot;

Side 2
# &quot;Fly Away With Us&quot;
# &quot;Older Woman&quot;
# &quot;Just the Memory Stays Around&quot;
# &quot;Gna Gna Gna Gna Gna&quot;
# &quot;Castles in the Air&quot;
# &quot;The Bugaloos (Theme Song)&quot;

One single was released in conjunction with the album: &quot;For a Friend&quot;/&quot;The Senses of Our World&quot; (Capitol 2946). &quot;For a Friend&quot; charted as a minor hit, appearing on &quot;Billboard&quot; the week of December 18, 1970, at No. 118.

The track &quot;Just the Memory Stays Around&quot; did not appear in any episode, and is available only on the LP. The LP was re-released on CD in January 2000 by Vivid Sound in Japan and in 2006 by Cherry Red Records of London.

The Bugaloos recorded 15 songs. In addition to the 11 that appear on the released album, four additional songs appeared on the television show, but remain unreleased:
# &quot;Sparky&quot;
# &quot;I&#x27;m As Happy As Can Be&quot;
# &quot;I Really Love You&quot;
# &quot;Flicker Town&quot;

==Home video==
The complete &quot;Bugaloos&quot; series was released on DVD in May 2006 by Rhino Entertainment. The set contained all 17 digitally remastered, original uncut broadcast episodes, with audio commentary on the pilot episode from creator Sid Krofft and director Tony Charmoli. Cast members John Philpott, Caroline Ellis and John McIndoe also provided audio commentary on some episodes and participated in interviews. Also included were a video jukebox with a selection of songs from the episodes, a photo gallery and a &quot;Bugaloos&quot; Interactive I. Q. Test hosted by McIndoe.

==Proposed Revival==
At Comic Con 2015, Sid and Marty Krofft revealed they were looking to create an updated version of &quot;The Bugaloos&quot; as a preschool television series. It was rumored Cyndi Lauper would portray Benita Bizarre. At 2017&#x27;s Comic Con, they released a teaser trailer of the pilot produced for Nickelodeon with clips of the new series with Lise Simms as Benita Bizarre. However, during a May 2018 radio interview with creator Marty Krofft, Marty revealed that the pilot was not picked up by Nickelodeon and was scrapped. He said they were reshooting the pilot and that Randy Jackson will be involved with the music.

==In popular culture==
The Bugaloos are the binding childhood memory that the two main protagonists in the 2000 film &quot;The Tao of Steve&quot; discover as they begin to bond, as Syd (Greer Goodman) and Dex (Donal Logue) find out that they both had Bugaloos stickers on their respective childhood &quot;Josie and the Pussycats&quot; lunchboxes.

The Bugaloos&#x27; song &quot;Senses of Our World&quot; was sampled by the Chemical Brothers in their track &quot;The Darkness That You Fear&quot;.

<doc id="246410" wikidata="Q646260" url="?curid=246410" title="Calgary Roughnecks">
<text>The Calgary Roughnecks are a Canadian professional box lacrosse team based in Calgary, Alberta, that competes in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The team plays its home games at Scotiabank Saddledome. The team name is derived from the roughnecks who work drilling rigs in Alberta&#x27;s oil and gas industry. The team is affectionately known by fans as the &quot;Riggers&quot;.

The Roughnecks were founded in 2001, their first season was 2002, and they have qualified for the post-season every year from 2003 to 2016. They have won three division championships (2005, 2009, 2011) and have captured the NLL Cup as NLL champions three times. Calgary won all three titles on their home floor, defeating the Buffalo Bandits in 2004, the New York Titans in 2009, and the Bandits again in 2019.

==History==

===Team beginnings===
The National Lacrosse League announced on March 28, 2001, that it had awarded an expansion franchise to a group of four owners led by Brad Banister. The idea for the team was formed a year earlier during Calgary&#x27;s famous Canada Day lacrosse tournament where it was suggested that professional lacrosse could work in Calgary. Within eight weeks of Banister contacting the league, Calgary was announced as the tenth franchise in the NLL at a cost of $500,000. The new team did not immediately announce its nickname, though Banister stated it would relate to the oilpatch. The name was later announced as the &quot;Roughnecks&quot;, named after workers on an oil rig.

Kevin Melnyk was installed as the coach and general manager, but as the season approached, Banister felt that the team was in danger of not being prepared for the season, replaced Melnyk. He took over as general manager, and hired Chris Hall to be the coach. The pair sought to build a more veteran team that is typical for an expansion franchise, and traded their first draft pick, Blaine Manning, to the Toronto Rock for Calgary native Kaleb Toth, who was expected to be the team&#x27;s marquee player.

The team made its debut on November 24, 2001, against the Montreal Express, a fellow expansion team. The Roughnecks lost the game 32–17 in front of 9,517 fans. The score shattered league records for total goals in a game with 49, and Montreal set a new mark for goals by one team. Another loss to the Express followed five days later before the Roughnecks earned their first win in franchise history on December 2 with a 17–11 defeat on the road versus the Ottawa Rebel. The Roughnecks then won three of their next four games, including their first home win on December 14, against the Columbus Landsharks. The team lost its last nine games, however, to finish with a 4–12 record.

===First championship===

In the 2002-2003 season, the Roughnecks enhanced their record to 9-7, with a very successful 6-2 record at home. Leading the team with 63 points was Tracey Kelusky. Close behind him was Kaleb Toth with 61 points. Before the season started Brad Banister promised the fans the playoffs and they were successful in achieving this goal. They travelled to Buffalo for the first playoff game in franchise history. The team lost 16-9 against the Buffalo Bandits to get knocked out of the playoffs.

The Roughnecks continued their improvement in the 2003-2004 season with a record of 10-6. Lewis Ratcliff lead the team with 71 points. Tracey Kelusky finished second with 69. Again Banister predicted a playoff entry and this time he predicted a home game to boot. Finishing third in the West the only way to get a home playoff game was to meet the third place team from the East. In the playoffs, the Roughnecks beat the San Jose Stealth 15-14 on the road to advance to the conference final. Again on the road, the Roughnecks beat the Colorado Mammoth with a final score of 13-11. On May 7, 2004, the Roughnecks hosted the championship game against the Buffalo Bandits, who had knocked them out of the playoff the previous year. Calgary won the Champion&#x27;s Cup by beating the Bandits 14-11 in front of a home crowd of 19,289 in the Pengrowth Saddledome.

For the 2004-2005 season former Roughneck player and assistant coach Dave Bremner was hired as general manager.

The Roughnecks hosted the 2005 NLL All Star Game on February 26, 2005. This was the first NLL game televised nationally in the United States; it was broadcast on NBC. Roughnecks&#x27; captain Kelusky took home the Most Valuable Player award as the East beat the West in an 11-10 overtime win. The 2005 season saw the Roughnecks come in first place in the Western Conference for the first time in franchise history. This garnered them a bye in the first round of the playoffs. On April 30, they hosted the Arizona Sting for the conference title and lost with a score of 19-15.

===Second championship===
Prior to the 2005-2006 season the Roughnecks hired on former Buffalo GM Kurt Silcott to replace Dave Bremner and become the fourth GM in team history.

After beginning the 2007 NLL season 4-1, the Roughnecks lost three straight games, and Silcott fired the only head coach in Roughnecks history, Chris Hall. Silcott filled in as interim head coach for one game, and then hired former Roughnecks player Jeff Dowling as the second head coach in Roughnecks history on March 9, 2007. He was replaced as Head Coach for the 2008 season by Troy Cordingley, while former Toronto Rock Head Coach Terry Sanderson was added as Assistant Coach.

In 2008, Calgary finished 3rd in the West with a 7-9 record, beat Colorado in the division semi-final, but lost in the division final to the Portland LumberJax. Despite this relatively successful season, general manager Kurt Silcott was fired. Team President Brad Banister gave no reason for the firing other than to say that &quot;the team and Silcott are heading into different directions, and this move would allow both parties to succeed to their full potential&quot; and that he would take over as interim GM.

The 2009 season was the most successful in team history. After opening the year with a record five straight wins, the Roughnecks finished the season 12-4. This allowed Calgary to take first overall in the NLL for the first time ever. They would go on to defeat the Colorado Mammoth and San Jose Stealth in the playoffs and then triumph over the New York Titans 12-10 in the Champion&#x27;s Cup final to win their first NLL championship since 2004.

===New ownership===
Banister announced shortly before the 2011 season began that he had placed the team for sale. He had talks with the National Hockey League&#x27;s (NHL) Calgary Flames, who indicated at the time they were not interested in the team. Midway through the season, Banister announced that he was late in meeting payroll and that the team was in danger of folding during the season. In a press release, he made an impassioned plea for the city&#x27;s business community to step forward and save the team.

The announcement touched off several weeks of speculation about the team, its future, and the potential for the Flames to purchase the team. On the floor, the team shrugged off the team&#x27;s instability, finishing with the best record in the NLL at 11–5. As they were set to face the Colorado Mammoth in the West semi-final, Banister put out another plea to the fans for support in the playoff game, threatening to turn the West final, which Calgary would have had the right to host, to their opponent for the game. The Roughnecks defeated the Mammoth, and played the West final at home, but were eliminated by the Washington Stealth in an upset by a 10–8 score.

The team&#x27;s future was settled in the off-season, as Banister announced on June 14, 2011, that the Flames had purchased the team, becoming the third NHL franchise to operate an NLL team after the Mammoth and Bandits. As part of the deal, it was announced that Banister would assist in the team&#x27;s transition period, and was replaced as general manager by former &quot;Calgary Herald&quot; writer and Flames employee Mike Board.

===Third championship===
The 2019 season was up and down for the Roughnecks and they finished the season 10-8. However, they ended it on a winning streak and then upset the suddenly-slumping San Diego Seals in the opening round by a score of 12-11 in San Diego. They then faced the Colorado Mammoth, who had similarly upset the defending champion Saskatchewan Rush and defeated them 8-4 in the West Final in Calgary in one of the lowest-scoring playoff games in NLL history.

This set them up for a best-of-three series against the Buffalo Bandits, which the Roughnecks swept with a 10-7 victory in Game 1 in Buffalo on May 18, and a 14-13 victory in an overtime thriller in Game 2 in Calgary on May 25. Rhys Duch scored the overtime winning goal.

==Mascot==
Howie, the honey badger, is the team&#x27;s official mascot. The Roughnecks introduced the new mascot at a media event on January 26, 2012, and later unveiled the name after holding a naming contest. The team&#x27;s former mascot is Derrick, an oilpatch rigger. Derrick has since returned as a secondary mascot at games.

<doc id="246411" wikidata="Q4794612" url="?curid=246411" title="Music of South Africa">
<text>The music of South Africa exhibits a culturally varied musical heritage in conjunction with the multi-ethnic populace. Genres with the greatest international recognition being mbube, isicathamiya, mbaqanga, afrofusion, kwaito, South African pop music, afro house, South African hip hop, Shangaan electro, bacardi house, bolo house, gqom and amapiano.

The country&#x27;s most internationally recognised and prominent musicians include Solomon Linda, Miriam Makeba, Hugh Masekela, Stimela, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Ray Phiri, Abdullah Ibrahim, Wouter Kellerman, Brenda Fassie, Seether, Die Antwoord, Jeremy Loops, Yvonne Chaka Chaka, Lucky Dube, Lebo M, Goldfish, Freshlyground, Black Coffee, Anatii, Zakes Bantwini, Master KG, Nomcebo Zikode, Nasty C, and Tyla.

== Pre-20th-century history ==

Early records of music in South Africa as well as Southern Africa indicate a fusion of cultural traditions: African, European and Asian.

Modern country&#x27;s early musician Enoch Sontonga wrote the Southern African national anthem &quot;Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika&quot; in 1897. By the end of the nineteenth century, South African cities such as Cape Town were large enough to attract foreign musicians, especially American ragtime players. In the 1890s Orpheus McAdoo&#x27;s Jubilee Singers popularised African-American spirituals.

Makwaya (meaning &quot;choir&quot;), blended European hymnody with African-American spirituals and emphasized close harmony singing.

==Marabi==


The discovery of gold, diamonds and other minerals in South Africa during the late 1800s and early 1900s lead to a rapid urbanisation where Black people would leave their villages and move to the city/town so that they could work in the mines to earn a living. However, due to the Natives Land Act, 1913, black people were not allowed to own property even in the city, leading to slums (at that time, townships did not exist yet as they were created during Apartheid which began in 1948) where they could live.

Shebeens arose in the black community, because alcohol was sold and consumed secretly as black South Africans were forbidden from selling alcohol or entering licensed premises starting in 1927. Women resorted to using their traditional beer brewing skills that they learnt in the rural areas to make and sell traditional beer (locally known as &#x27;Umqombothi&#x27;) to the new black urban class in these shebeens; hence they became known as &quot;Shebeen Queens&quot;.

Eventually, these shebeens would provide a nightlife for people living in the slums including mineworkers as it was the only place where people were allowed to express themselves freely. At that time, jazz was the most popular style of music in the urban areas of South Africa, especially in these shebeens. So, jazz got fused with African traditional music creating a new style of music called &quot;Marabi&quot; a musical style and dance genre. By the end of the 1920s, marabi music had become wildly popular in the shebeens. Sophiatown, a vibrant multiracial suburb, was where this genre was pioneered.

Unfortunately, it had also gained a sordid reputation. Drug dealers, criminals, and prostitution were frequently associated with marabi music and marabi dance, already looked down upon by White South Africans, it was further shunned by the educated Black classes of South Africans as well.

Despite this, it continued to thrive in the townships around Johannesburg and other major cities. By the 1940s and the 1950s, Marabi was at its peak of popularity in South Africa, having created many stars such as Miriam Makeba, Dolly Rathebe, Hugh Masekela and Abdullah Ibrahim that became very influential in the South African music scene.

==Gospel==
Christianity in South Africa was first introduced during the 1600s when Christian missionaries began arriving from the Netherlands. Missionaries from the United Kingdom, France, Germany, Scandinavia and the United States arrived from the early 1800s. Churches and missionary schools were built throughout the country. Native South Africans who were converted into Christianity were taught hymns that were sung in Europe and the USA. Newly converted Christians would eventually compose new hymns in their own African languages. An example would be Enoch Sontonga, who composed Nkosi Sikelel&#x27; iAfrika.

In the early twentieth century, Zionist Christian churches spread across South Africa. They incorporated African musical elements into their gospel songs. South African gospel started to be popular in the 1990s with artists such as Rebecca Malope and Lundi Tyamara. Gqom gospel emerged in the 21st century.

==Neo-traditional styles==
Traditionally styled music is generally appellated as &quot;Sotho-traditional&quot; or &quot;Zulu-traditional&quot;, and has been an important part of the South African music business since the 1930s. Vocal and concertina records were released with a call-and-response style and a concertina used as a counterpoint to the lead vocal. Following World War 1, cheap imported concertinas arrived in South Africa, especially the Italian brand bafstari.

===Sotho-traditional===
The Sotho musician Tshwatlano Makala was the first traditional musician to achieve widespread commercial success. He helped to set the stage for the subsequent rise of Letsema Mat&#x27;sela&#x27;s band, Basotho Dihoba, which used styles from his native Lesotho to develop a genre called mohobelo.

By the 1970s, the concertina of Sotho-traditional music was replaced with an accordion and an electric backing band. This wave of neo-traditional performers was led by Tau Ea Mat&#x27;sekha.

===Zulu===
The Zulu people adopted the guitar following its introduction by the Portuguese in the sixteenth century, and guitars were locally and cheaply made by the 1930s. John Bhengu was the first major Zulu guitarist, earning a reputation in 1950s Durban for his unique &quot;ukupika&quot; style of picking (as opposed to traditional strumming). Bhengu&#x27;s song format, which includes an instrumental introduction (&quot;izihlabo&quot;), a melody and spoken praise (&quot;ukubonga&quot;) for a clan or family, was widely used for a long time in Zulu-traditional music. Bhengu, however, switched to the electric guitar in the late 1960s and began recording as &quot;Phuzushukela&quot; (Sugar Drinker). His popularity exploded, and Zulu-traditional music entered a boom.

Since the 1970s, the concertina has returned to Zulu-traditional music, while diverse influences from pop music and drum and bass were added. Vusi Ximba&#x27;s &quot;Siyakudamisa&quot; (1992) was perhaps the most memorable Zulu-traditional album of the later twentieth century, and drew controversy for racy, comedic lyrics.

===Tsonga-traditional===
Tsonga traditional music was first recorded in the 1950s by Francisco Baloyi for Gallo, and showed a largely African style influenced by Latin rhythms. Mozambiquan musicians Fani Pfumo and Alexander Jafete became prominent studio performers in the 1950s and into the next decade. In 1975, however, Mozambique became independent and a radio station was opened by Radio Bantu, leading to the abandonment of Portuguese elements from this style.

More modern Tsonga bands, such as General MD Shirinda &amp; the Gaza Sisters play a style called Tsonga disco, featuring a male lead vocalist backed by female singers, a guitar, keyboard or synth and disco rhythms. Thomas Chauke &amp; the Shinyori Sisters (Tusk Records) have become probably the best-selling band of any neo-traditional style. George Maluleke na Van&#x27;wanati Sisters have also been instrumental in modernizing the music by experimenting with a faster tempo and native instruments. The most popular Tsonga musicians, however, has arguably been either Thomas Chauke, the pop singer Peta Teanet or the equally successful Penny Penny, Joe Shirimani. Paul Ndlovu is another artist who has contributed a lot in this genre, with his popular hits, &quot;Hi ta famba moyeni&quot; and &quot;Tsakane&quot;.

The modern sound of traditional Xitsonga music comprises more of the earlier native sounds that had initially been abandoned in favor of the Portuguese electronic guitars, namely the xylophone and bass marimba. Bands such as Thomas Chauke and the Xinyori Sisters and George Maluleke predominantly used guitars; however the modern sound replaces these with the xylophone or bass marimba. The Tsonga people&#x27;s preference for the xylophone and marimba type of sound is inherited from the timbila music of the Chopi people, which has been entered into the UNESCO heritage archives as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

===Pedi-traditional===
Pedi-traditional music is principally harepa and is based on the harp. The German autoharp arrived in South Africa in the nineteenth century, brought by Lutheran ministers proselytising among the Pedi. Harepa has not achieved much mainstream success in South Africa, though there was a brief boom in the 1970s, led by Johannes Mohlala and Sediya dipela Mokgwadi.

===Venda-traditional===

Venda-traditional music was also recorded when black music in South Africa was being recognised. The late 1960s (and, more significantly the late 1970s) saw a boom in Venda-speaking artists. This was mainly influenced by the launch of a Venda radio station.

Irene Mawela (who had been singing in the 1960s and 1970s with groups like Mahotella Queens, Sweet Sixteens and the Dark City Sisters) significantly impacted traditional and contemporary Venda music, despite vocal recordings in Zulu, Sotho and Xhosa languages. Mawela&#x27;s 1983 release, &quot;Khanani Yanga&quot;, was one of the most successful Venda-traditional music albums of that year. After some lean years, Mawela returned to the South African music scene with &quot;Tlhokomela Sera&quot;, released in December 2007. Mawela&#x27;s recent numbers like &quot;Mme Anga Khotsi Anga&quot; and &quot;Nnditsheni&quot; are very popular. Solomon Matase is known for his hits &quot;Ntshavheni&quot; and &quot;Vho i fara Phele&quot;.

Alpheus Ramavhea, Mundalamo, Eric Mukhese, and Adziambei Band are also famous for their contributions to Venda music. The latter band still continues to produce music with great success, including a recent album release, &quot;Mutula Gole&quot;, in February 2012. Colbert Mukwevho has been involved with Venda music for over 20 years, starting with 1980s hits like &quot;Kha tambe na thanga dzawe,&quot; &quot;i do nela rothe&quot; and &quot;saga-saga.&quot; In 2006 his comeback album &quot;Mulovha namusi na matshelo&quot;, included hit songs &quot;Ndo takala hani&quot; and &quot;Zwa mutani wavho&quot; which remain popular with Venda and Pedi&#x27;s. He grew up in a family of music. His father Christopher Mukwevho, then leader of the popular band Thrilling Artist, used to feature him at young age.
Rudzani Shurflus Ragimana of shurflus was well known for known for venda reggae music together with Khakhathi and friends, Tshiganzha, Ntshenge. Reggae music is well played by a lot of artists for Tshivenda.

Other performers include: Makhadzi, Fizzy, Prifix, Bhamba, Komrade Li, SubZro, TAKZIT, Humbulani Ramagwedzha, Jahman Chiganja, Khakhathi and Friends, Maduvha Madima, Takalani Mudau, Rapson Mbilummbi Rambuwani, TMan Gavini, Clean-G, Mizo Phyll, Killah Gee, Jininka, Paul Mulaudzi, Malondo Ramulongo, Burning Doctor, Just ice, Lufuno Dagada and Tshidino Ndou.

Another singer making a name for himself in the South African music market is Tshidino Ndou, a reggae artist who is also owner of Vhadino Entertainment music company. Tshidino was born and bred in Tshakhuma, a rural village in South Africa in the Limpopo Province. So far he has two albums, &quot;Ndi do fa na inwi&quot; (2009) (Till death do us part) and &quot;Nne Ndi Nne&quot; (2010) (I am what I am). His song &quot;Ni songo nyadza&quot; (meaning &quot;do not undermine other people&#x27;s religions&quot;), featuring a Venda reggae icon Humbulani Ramagwedzha of thivhulungiwi fame, is gaining extensive media exposure through Phalaphala FM, Soweto TV, Makhado FM and Univen radio.

Tshidino entered the music scene as a founder member of Vhadino House Grooves group which he established alongside his brother, Arthur Ndou in 2008. They released their debut hot album titled Ro Swika meaning we have arrived. The album contains a controversial song &quot;Ri ya groova&quot;, widely known as &quot;Ndo Fara Mudifho&quot;. He has released a single, &quot;Ri khou phusha life&quot;, which has already made a mark on radios and newspapers. The full album was planned for release in 2012, featuring two other giants: Takalani Mudau of &quot;baby fusheani&quot; fame and the Burning Doctor of &quot;A lu na mutwe&quot; fame. Tshidino is not just a musician but also a prominent film producer who is more popular in the Vendawood film industry in the Limpopo Province of South Africa. He plays the character of Vho-Mulingo in Vho-Mulingo comedy. Other movies he produced include &quot;Mathaithai&quot;, , and .

===Xhosa-traditional===
Perhaps the best known neo-traditional South African music, internationally anyway, is the music of Amampondo and the solo work of their leader and founder, Dizu Plaatjies. He and his group took traditional Xhosa music from the hills of Pondoland and the Eastern Cape and put it on stage worldwide. The success of the genre was how the exponents combined their music with their stage performances and dance. The great composer Stompie Mavi, who is originally from Nqamakhwe was also very popular during the 80&#x27;s and 90&#x27;s. His music was inspired by Xhosa rhythms, cultural values and social commentary especially on songs such as Teba and Manyano. Musicians such as Nofinishi Dywili, Madosini, Mantombi Matotiyana and many other women have been on the forefront of traditional Xhosa music. Very recently new and younger artists such as Indwe and Gatyeni are gaining momentum.

==Classical and art music==
Classical and art music in South Africa reached its zenith of popularity in the mid-20th century and was primarily composed by a triumvirate of Afrikaner composers known as the &quot;fathers of South African art music.&quot; These composers were Arnold van Wyk, Hubert du Plessis, and Stefans Grové. All three composers were White South Africans, yet harbored very different views on Apartheid, which was state policy at the time. Stefans Grové was one of the first white composers to incorporate Black African music into his compositions, and openly rejected apartheid ideals in an effort to fuse his &quot;Western art and his physical, African space.&quot; Arnold Van Wyk became known for his government-endorsed nationalistic compositions, though he himself was reluctant to support the apartheid administration. Hubert Du Plessis, on the other hand, was a very strong Afrikaner nationalist, and experienced a &quot;growing consciousness&quot; of his heritage which made him proud to compose such pieces. Du Plessis&#x27; works included chamber music, orchestral pieces, and many pieces for the piano.

Wouter Kellerman, a South African flautist, producer, and composer, is a two-time Grammy Award winner.

===Afrikaans music===

Afrikaans music was primarily influenced by Dutch folk styles, along with French and German influences, in the early twentieth century. Zydeco-type string bands led by a concertina were popular, as were elements of American country music, especially Jim Reeves. The most prolific composers of &quot;tiekie draai&quot; Afrikaans music were lyricist Anton De Waal who wrote many hit songs with songwriters, pianist Charles Segal (&quot;Hey Babariebab Se Ding Is Vim&quot;, &quot;Kalkoenjie&quot;, &quot;Sy Kom Van Kommetjie&quot; and many others) and accordionist, Nico Carstens. Bushveld music based on the Zulu were reinterpreted by such singers as Marais and Miranda. Melodramatic and sentimental songs called &quot;trane trekkers&quot; (tearjerkers) were especially common. In 1973, a country music song won the coveted SARI Award (South African Music Industry) for the Song of the Year – &quot;My Children, My Wife&quot; was written by renowned South African composer Charles Segal and lyricist Arthur Roos. In 1979 the South African Music scene changed from the Tranetrekkers to more lively sounds and the introduction of new names in the market with the likes of Anton Goosen, David Kramer (singer), Koos du Plessis, Fanie de Jager, Flaming Victory and Laurika Rauch. Afrikaans music is currently one of the most popular and best selling industries on the South African music scene.

After World War I, Afrikaner nationalism spread and such musicians as Jewish pianist and composer Charles Segal and accordionist Nico Carstens were popular.

==The 1930s==

===A cappella===

The 1930s saw the spread of Zulu a cappella singing from the Natal area to much of South Africa. The style&#x27;s popularity, finally producing a major star in 1939 with Solomon Linda&#x27;s Original Evening Birds, whose &quot;Mbube&quot; (&quot;The Lion&quot;) was probably the first African recording to sell more than 100,000 copies. It also provided the basis for two further American pop hits, The Weavers&#x27; &quot;Wimoweh&quot; (1951) and The Tokens&#x27; &quot;The Lion Sleeps Tonight&quot; (1961). Linda&#x27;s music was in a style that came to be known as mbube. From the late 1940s to the 1960s, a harsh, strident form called isikhwela jo was popular, though national interest waned in the 1950s until Radio Zulu began broadcasting to Natal, Transvaal and the Orange Free State in 1962 (see 1950s: Bantu Radio and pennywhistle for more details).

Also formed in this era was the Stellenbosch University Choir, part of the University of Stellenbosch, the oldest running choir in the country and was formed in 1936 by William Morris, also the first conductor of the Choir. The current conductor is Andre van der Merwe. They specialise in a cappella music and consist of students from the University.

Ladysmith Black Mambazo, a male a capella ensemble are regarded as a national treasure in South Africa. The origins of the band can be traced back to a series of dreams experienced by Joseph Shabalala, in 1964. In these dreams, Shabalala envisioned the melodies that would define the group&#x27;s distinctive sound. As od 2024, The ensemble has forged a four-decade history with the Grammy Awards, amassing 17 nominations and obtaining five Grammys.

==The 1950s==

===Bantu Radio and the music industry===
By the 1950s, the music industry had diversified greatly, and included several major labels. Innovative musician and composer, Charles Segal was the first white musician to work with the indigenous African people, recording tribal performers and promoting African music overseas starting in the 1950s. Charles Segal was also the first white musician to write in the indigenous African style and to bring the African music genre into the commercial market. His single &quot;Africa&quot; was a hit amongst the diverse South African population in the 1960s and he continued to produce, record and teach his own unique style of African music, which was a mix of African and Jazz influences. These compositions include &quot;Opus Africa&quot;, &quot;African Fantasy&quot;, &quot;Kootanda&quot; and many more. In 1962, the South African government launched a development programme for Bantu Radio in order to foster separate development and encourage independence for the Bantustans. Though the government had expected Bantu Radio to play folk music, African music had developed into numerous pop genres, and the nascent recording studios used radio to push their pop stars. The new focus on radio led to a government crackdown on lyrics, censoring songs which were considered a &quot;public hazard&quot;.

===Pennywhistle jive===
The first major style of South African popular music to emerge was pennywhistle jive (later known as kwela). Black cattle-herders had long played a three-holed reed flute, adopting a six-holed flute when they moved to the cities. Willard Cele is usually credited with creating pennywhistle by placing the six-holed flute between his teeth at an angle. Cele spawned a legion of imitators and fans, especially after appearing in the 1951 film &quot;The Magic Garden (film)&quot;.

Groups of flautists played on the streets of South African cities in the 1950s, many of them in white areas, where police would arrest them for creating a public disturbance. Some young whites were attracted to the music, and came to be known as ducktails. The 1950s also saw &#x27;coloured&#x27; bands develop the new genre of Quela, a hybrid of South African Squares and modern samba. Once again, we see the cross-over between white, Afrikaans music and the indigenous South Africa music in the compositions of pianist and composer, Charles Segal, with his penny whistle hits including &quot;Kwela Kwela&quot; and many others.

==The 1960s==
In the 1960s, a smooth form of mbube called cothoza mfana developed, led by the King Star Brothers, who invented isicathamiya style by the end of the decade.

By the 1960s, the saxophone was commonplace in jive music, the performance of which continued to be restricted to townships. The genre was called sax jive and later mbaqanga. Mbaqanga literally means &quot;dumpling&quot; but implies &quot;home-made&quot; and was coined by Michael Xaba, a jazz saxophonist who did not like the new style.

The early 1960s also saw performers such as bassist Joseph Makwela and guitarist Marks Mankwane add electric instruments and marabi and kwela influences to the mbaqanga style, leading to a funkier and more African sound.

Mbaqanga developed vocal harmonies during the very early 1960s when groups including The Skylarks and the Manhattan Brothers began copying American vocal bands, mostly doo wop. Rather than African-American four-part harmonies, however, South African bands used five parts. The Dark City Sisters were the most popular vocal group in the early 1960s, known for their sweet style. Aaron Jack Lerole of Black Mambazo added groaning male vocals to the female harmonies, later being replaced by Simon &#x27;Mahlathini&#x27; Nkabinde, who has become perhaps the most influential and well-known South African &quot;groaner&quot; of the twentieth century. Marks Mankwane and Joseph Makwela&#x27;s mbaqanga innovations evolved into the more danceable mgqashiyo sound when the two joined forces with Mahlathini and the new female group Mahotella Queens, in Mankwane&#x27;s backing group Makhona Tsohle Band (also featuring Makwela along with saxophonist-turned-producer West Nkosi, rhythm guitarist Vivian Ngubane, and drummer Lucky Monama). The Mahlathini and the Mahotella Queens/Makhona Tsohle outfit recorded as a studio unit for Gallo Record Company, to great national success, pioneering mgqashiyo music all over the country to equal success.

In 1967 Miriam Makeba released US hit &quot;Pata Pata&quot;. 1967, Izintombi Zesi Manje Manje, an mgqashiyo female group that provided intense competition for Mahotella Queens. Both groups were massive competitors in the jive field, though the Queens usually came out on top.

===Soul and jazz===
The late 1960s saw the rise of soul music from the United States. Wilson Pickett and Percy Sledge were among singers who were especially popular and inspired South African performers to enter the field with an organ, a bass-and-drum rhythm section and an electric guitar.

In the 1960s jazz split into two fields. Dance bands like the Elite Swingsters were popular, while avant-garde jazz inspired by the work of John Coltrane, Thelonious Monk and Sonny Rollins was also common. The latter field of musicians included prominent activists and thinkers, including Hugh Masekela, Abdullah Ibrahim (formerly known as &#x27;Dollar Brand&#x27;), Kippie Moeketsi, Sathima Bea Benjamin, Chris McGregor, Johnny Dyani and Jonas Gwangwa. In 1959, American pianist John Mehegan organised a recording session using many of the most prominent South African jazz musicians, resulting in the first two African jazz LPs. The following year saw the Cold Castle National Jazz Festival, which brought additional attention to South African jazz. Cold Castle became an annual event for a few years, and brought out more musicians, especially Dudu Pukwana, Gideon Nxumalo and Chris McGregor. The 1963 festival produced an LP called &quot;Jazz The African Sound&quot;, but government oppression soon ended the jazz scene. Again, many musicians emigrated or went into exile in the UK or other countries.

In 1968 Hugh Masekela got big hit &quot;Grazing in the Grass&quot;, and it reached No.1 on Billboard pop chart. While the African jazz of the north of South Africa was being promoted in Johannesburg, musicians in Cape Town were awakening to their jazz heritage. Pianist Charles Segal, who had moved from Pretoria to Cape Town, brought an enthusiasm for jazz after several trips to the US, where he met and was influenced by the jazz pianist Oscar Peterson. The port city had a long history of musical interaction with seafaring players. The rise of the Coon Carnival and the visionary talent of Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand) and his sax players Basil Coetzee and Robbie Jansen led to Cape Jazz. It was an improvised version of their folk songs with musical reference to European and American jazz which would go on some 20 years later to be South Africa&#x27;s most important jazz export.

==1970s–1980s==

===Mgqashiyo and Isicathamiya===
By the 1970s, only a few long-standing mgqashiyo groups were well-known, with the only new groups finding success with an all-male line-up. Abafana Baseqhudeni and Boyoyo Boys were perhaps the biggest new stars of this period. The Mahotella Queens&#x27; members began leaving the line-up around 1971 for rival groups. Gallo, by far the biggest record company in South Africa, began to create a new Mahotella Queens line-up, recording them with Abafana Baseqhudeni. Lead groaner Mahlathini had already moved to rival label EMI (in early 1972), where he had successful records with backing team Ndlondlo Bashise and new female group the Mahlathini Girls. The new Mahotella Queens line-up over at Gallo found just as much success as the original Queens, recording on-and-off with new male groaners such as Robert Mbazo Mkhize of Abafana Baseqhudeni.

Ladysmith Black Mambazo, headed by the soprano of Joseph Shabalala, arose in the 1960s, and became perhaps the biggest isicathamiya stars in South Africa&#x27;s history. Their first album was 1973&#x27;s &quot;Amabutho&quot;, which was also the first gold record by black musicians; it sold over 25,000 copies. Ladysmith Black Mambazo remained popular throughout the next few decades, especially after 1986, when Paul Simon, an American musician, included Ladysmith Black Mambazo on his extremely popular &quot;Graceland&quot; album and its subsequent tour of 1987.

With progressive jazz hindered by governmental suppression, marabi-styled dance bands rose to more critical prominence in the jazz world. The music became more complex and retained popularity, while progressive jazz produced only occasional hits, such as Winston Ngozi&#x27;s &quot;Yakal Nkomo&quot; and Abdullah Ibrahim&#x27;s &quot;Mannenberg&quot;.

===Disco===
In the middle of the 1970s, American disco was imported to South Africa, and disco beats were added to soul music, which helped bring a halt to popular mbaqanga bands such as the Mahotella Queens. In 1976, South African children rebelled en masse against apartheid and governmental authority, and a vibrant, youthful counterculture was created, with music as an integral part of its focus. Styles from before the 1970s fusion of disco and soul were not widely regarded, and were perceived as being sanctioned by the white oppressors. Few South African bands gained a lasting success during this period, however, with the exception of the Movers, who used marabi elements in their soul. The Movers were followed by the Soul Brothers, and the instrumental band The Cannibals, who soon began working with singer Jacob &quot;Mpharanyana&quot; Radebe. The coloured (not black) band The Flames also gained a following, and soon contributed two members (Blondie Chaplin and Ricky Fataar) to American band The Beach Boys. Harari arose in their place, eventually moving to an almost entirely rock and roll sound. One of Harare&#x27;s members, Sipho &#x27;Hotstix&#x27; Mabuse became a superstar in the 1980s.

== South African rock music ==

=== Afro rock ===

Afro rock, characterised by its fusion of Western rock music with African musical elements, saw the emergence of bands and artists like Assagai in the late 1960s and early 1970s. The original lineup of Assagai comprised five members, three hailing from South Africa and two from Nigeria: Louis Moholo on drums, Mongezi Feza on trumpet and flute, Dudu Pukwana on alto saxophone, Bizo Mngqikana on tenor saxophone, and Fred Coker on guitar and bass. According to Rob Fitzpatrick of The Guardian, Coker played a pivotal role in positioning Assagai as significant competition to Ghana&#x27;s Osibisa, before departing to join Osibisa, replacing Spartacus R. Keyboardist Alan Gowen from the Canterbury scene and percussionist Jamie Muir from King Crimson briefly joined the band from 1971 to 1972.

Operating under the British label Vertigo Records, Assagai is believed to be the sole African or &quot;Black&quot; band ever signed by the label. Their eponymous debut album, featuring collaboration with African musicians like Terri Quaye, was released in 1971. Repertoire Records reissued Assagai on CD in 1994. Their second and final album, &quot;Zimbabwe&quot; adorned with cover art by Roger Dean, also released in 1971, was later reissued as &quot;AfroRock&quot; by the Music for Pleasure record label. Both albums featured compositions by members of the British group Jade Warrior, with guest appearances from them as well.

In the 1960s, Pukwana, Feza, and Moholo had been part of the jazz ensemble The Blue Notes alongside Chris McGregor.

===Punk rock===

During the punk rock boom of the late 1970s, UK and American punk music influenced South African bands, such as Wild Youth and Powerage and gained a cult following, focused in Durban and in and around Johannesburg. Bands such as Dog Detachment and The Radio Rats and Young Dumb &amp; Violent had a similar following on the fringes of the music scene. Cape Town had a big following with Safari Suits, Housewife&#x27;s Choice, The Lancaster Band, The News and Permanent Force (aka Private File after BOSS intervention), soon followed by The Rude Dementals, The Zero&#x27;s, Fred Smith Band, Red Army, Riot Squad, Injury Time and The Vipers. In Cape Town many gigs took place at &quot;Scratch&quot; Club (run by Gerry Dixon and Henry Coombes), 1886, UCT, Off The Road, numerous town halls and other local venues. Some of the aforementioned bands passed through on tours. The &quot;RIOT ROCK&quot; tour of December 1979 being a culmination of the period. National Wake was a multiracial punk rock band in the late 1970s. They were created in protest of the apartheid regime. They were South Africa&#x27;s first multiracial punk band.

===Rock===
There was a thriving, mostly white, rock music scene in Cape Town in the 1970s. The album McCully Workshop Inc. from the psychedelic rock band McCully Workshop is a good example of the genre. The Trutone label was owned by South African company Gallo (Africa) Limited an internationally recognised music producer.

===Alternative rock and Afrikaans===
The early 1980s brought popular attention on alternative rock bands such as The Usual and Scooter&#x27;s Union. In and around Johannesburg the growth of the independent music scene led to not just a surge of bands ranging from big names (relatively speaking) Tribe After Tribe, The Dynamics, The Softies and the Spectres through to smaller hopefuls What Colours, Days Before and No Exit, but also to the growth of a vibrant DIY fanzine scene with &quot;Palladium&quot; and &quot;One Page to Many&quot; two titles of note.

South African alternative rock grew more mainstream with two leading bands, Asylum Kids from Johannesburg and Peach from Durban having chart success and releasing critically acclaimed albums. The burgeoning music scene around Johannesburg saw a surge of small bands, inspired and informed by the UK DIY punk ethic, form and start performing at a growing number of venues from clubs the likes of Metalbeat, Bluebeat, King of Clubs, DV8 and Dirtbox to student run venues such as GR Bozzoli Hall and later the Free People Concert on the University of the Witwatersrand campus.

One artist of specific note to come from this era was James Phillips who was involved with several influential and important bands including Corporal Punishment; Cherry Faced Lurchers; and his Afrikaans alter ego Bernoldus Niemand (roughly translates as Bernard Nobody). With his Bernoldus Niemand character, James managed to cross the language division and influence a whole range of Afrikaans speaking musicians to the same punk ethic that had inspired him, and an important Afrikaans alternative rock scene grew from this influence.

During this period, the only Afrikaners to achieve much mainstream fame were Anton Goosen, a rock singer-songwriter, and Bles Bridges, an imitator of American lounge singer Wayne Newton.

===Gothic rock===
In 1983, Dog Detachment was one of the earliest groups which combined Post-Punk music with elements of Gothic rock. South Africa&#x27;s first Gothic rock band was No Friends of Harry, formed in the mid-1980s. Other notable bands from the second half of the 1980s are The Gathering (not to be confused with the Dutch Metal band), The Death Flowers of No-cypher, Lidice, Attic Muse, The Autumn Ritual, The Elephant Celebes and Penguins in Bondage.

In 1995, The Awakening was formed by vocalist, guitarist and producer Ashton Nyte. The band is credited in major national press as &quot;South Africa&#x27;s most successful Gothic Rock act and one of the top bands in the far broader Alternative scene&quot; and headlined major national festivals throughout South Africa, including the country&#x27;s largest music festival Woodstock, in addition to Oppikoppi and RAMFest. With more than a dozen top ten national singles between 1998 and 2007, The Awakening were the first goth-styled act to have major success in South Africa.

Another notable goth artist was The Eternal Chapter, which had a hit with the cover &quot;Here comes the man&quot;, originally by Boom Boom Room.

== South African pop music ==

=== Afro fusion ===

Stimela originated from Ray Phiri&#x27;s soul group, The Cannibals, formed in the 1970s. Phiri, renowned for his work on Paul Simon&#x27;s albums &quot;Graceland&quot; and &quot;The Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, led The Cannibals to success with several hit singles in South Africa. In the early 1980s, Phiri joined forces with former members of The Cannibals to establish Stimela, an Afro-fusion band (meaning &quot;steam train&quot;). Fusing R&amp;B and jazz with rhythmic elements from South African genres like mbaqanga, Stimela was led by Phiri, who served as guitarist, songwriter, and often lead vocalist. The band sang in English and various South African languages, including recording songs in the Malawian language, Chichewa, amidst the apartheid-era promotion of &quot;retribalization&quot; in black music.

During the 1980s and early 1990s, Stimela&#x27;s music occasionally challenged apartheid&#x27;s boundaries of expression. Certain songs, like &quot;&quot;Whispers in the Deep&quot; advocating for fearless expression, faced bans from airing on the state-controlled radio station, SABC. Additionally, a 1984 duet featuring a white singer, Katie Pennington, titled &quot;Where Did We Go Wrong&quot; was rejected by radio stations for airplay. Despite these restrictions, Stimela&#x27;s 1986 album, &quot;Look, Listen and Decide&quot;&quot; achieved significant commercial success, reaching bestseller status. The band&#x27;s albums attained gold and platinum status.

Stimela debuted at a pivotal moment, filling the void left by the afrofusion band Sakhile&#x27;s hiatus. Sankomota (previously known as &#x27;Uhuru&#x27;), an afrofusion group formed in Lesotho in the 1970s, gained prominence when their debut album was recorded by South African producer Lloyd Ross in 1983. Sankomota&#x27;s hit composition &quot;It&#x27;s Raining&quot; propelled their success, leading to subsequent album releases and a move to South Africa. Bassist Bakithi Khumalo and drummer Vusi Khumalo, later forming the band Theta, provided rhythms for country and Western bands. Tananas, another South African fusion band formed in 1987, blended jazz, country, Congolese rumba, rock, township jazz, ragtime, township jive, Mozambican salsa, and Spanish music. Peace released their debut record and performed alongside Abdullah Ibrahim (Dollar Brand) and Hugh Masekela. The collective Night Cruiser featured in Zakes Mda&#x27;s plays at the Space Theatre.

=== Tsapiky ===

Tsapiky is a music genre originating in Madagascar, in the Toliara Province. It emerged as a blend of South African pop, initially heard on Mozambican radio stations, and indigenous Malagasy tradition during the 1970s. The genre&#x27;s rhythms encompass rapid tempos.

=== Pop ===
P J Powers won the 1986 Song for South Africa competition, the first one run by the SABC. It aimed to promote South African music. The winning song was Don Clarke&#x27;s &quot;Sanbonani.&quot; The final round was televised on national TV, with P J Powers supported by her band, Hotline. &quot;Sanbonani&quot; featured on the &quot;P J Powers and Hotline Greatest Hits&quot; album in 1991.

===International attention===
The original Mahotella Queens line-up reunited with Mahlathini and the Makgona Tsohle Band in 1983, due to unexpected demand from mgqashiyo and mbaqanga fans. Ladysmith Black Mambazo took their first step into the international arena via Paul Simon on his &quot;Graceland&quot; album in 1986, where a series of reissue albums by US label Shanachie sold very well. Mambazo became world travellers, touring the world and collaborating with various Western musicians to massive success. &quot;Graceland&quot; won many awards including the Grammy Award for Best Album of the Year. A year later, Simon produced Black Mambazo&#x27;s first U.S. release, Shaka Zulu, which won the Grammy Award, in 1988, for Best Traditional Folk Album. Since then, and in total, the group has received fifteen Grammy Award Nominations and three Grammy Award wins, including one in 2009. The &quot;Graceland&quot; album not only propelled Mambazo into the spotlight, but paved the way for other South African acts (including Mahlathini and the Queens, Amaswazi Emvelo, Moses Mchunu, Ray Phiri and Stimela, The Mighty Soul beat and others) to become known worldwide as well.

&quot;World in Union,&quot; the Ladysmith Black Mambazo record feat. P J Powers, became an international hit record in 1995. It charted in the UK (no 47 on the singles charts).

Johnny Clegg got his start in the 1970s playing Zulu-traditional music with Sipho Mchunu, and became prominent as the only major white musician playing traditional black music, achieving success in France as &quot;Le Zoulou Blanc&quot; (&quot;The White Zulu&quot;). The 1980s also saw a resurgence in rock and roll bands, among them The Helicopters, Petit Cheval, Sterling and Tellinger.

Mango Groove has racked up a host of achievements throughout the years, and has firmly established itself as one of South Africa&#x27;s most recognised and loved music icons. The group exploded into the national consciousness with the release of its 10 times Platinum debut album in 1989. Taking SA music to the world: Amongst other things, this included Mango Groove being the only South African act invited to perform at the 1997 handover of Hong Kong to China, being the only South African act featured on The Freddie Mercury Tribute concert (broadcast to over a billion people), appearing in front of 200 000 people at the SOS Racisme concert in Paris and receiving 3 encores at the Montrieux Jazz Festival.

=== Reggae ===
The most lasting change, however, may have been the importation of reggae from Jamaica. Following international superstar Bob Marley&#x27;s concert celebrating Zimbabwe&#x27;s independence in 1980, reggae took hold across Africa. Lucky Dube was the first major South African artists; his style was modelled most closely on that of Peter Tosh. Into the 1990s, Lucky Dube was one of the best-selling artists in South African history, especially his 1990 album &quot;Slave&quot;. The 1990s also saw Jamaican music move towards ragga, an electronic style that was more influential on kwaito (South African hip hop music) than reggae.
A group from the Free State called Oyaba also emerged during this period. Their best known hit songs are Tomorrow Nation, Paradise and Love Crazy. Reggae became quite popular and there was also a singer from KwaZulu-Natal, Sipho Johnson known as Jambo.

===Township pop (Bubblegum)===
Township pop also improperly referred to as &quot;bubblegum&quot; is a form of South African pop music that arose in the middle of the 1980s, distinctively based on vocals with overlapping call-and-response vocals. Electronic keyboards and synthesisers are commonplace. Dan Tshanda of the band Splash was the first major bubblegum stars, followed by Sello Chicco Twala. Twala introduced some politically oriented lyrics, such as &quot;We Miss You Manelo&quot; (a coded tribute to Nelson Mandela) and &quot;Papa Stop the War&quot;, a collaboration with Mzwakhe Mbuli.

In 1983 a major new South African star was born, Brenda Fassie. Her single, &quot;Weekend Special&quot;, announced her as the pre-eminent female South African vocalist of her generation. She remained unmatched in popularity, talent until her untimely death in 2004.

The late 1980s saw the rise of Yvonne Chaka Chaka, beginning with her 1984 hit &quot;I&#x27;m in Love With a DJ&quot;, which was the first major hit for bubblegum. Her popularity rose into the 1990s, especially across the rest of Africa and into Europe. Jabu Khanyile&#x27;s Bayete and teen heart-throb Ringo have also become very popular.

===The Voëlvry movement===

Afrikaans-language music saw a resurgence in the 1980s as the &quot;Voëlvry&quot; (&quot;free as a bird&quot; or &quot;outlawed&quot;) movement reflected a new Afrikaans artistic counter-culture largely hostile to the values of the National Party and conservative Afrikanerdom. Spearheaded by the singer-songwriter Johannes Kerkorrel and his &quot;Gereformeerde Blues Band&quot;, the movement (which was named after Kerkorrel&#x27;s 1989 regional tour) also included musicians Bernoldus Niemand (aka James Phillips) and Koos Kombuis. Voëlvry tapped into a growing dissatisfaction with the Apartheid system amongst white Afrikaans speakers, and thus Voëlvry represents the musical branch of opposition that was paralleled by literature and the arts.

==The 1990s==

===New rhythms===
In 1994, South African media was liberalised and new musical styles arose. Prophets of Da City became known as a premier hip hop crew, though a South Africanised style of hip hop known as kwaito soon replaced actual hip hop groups. In kwaito, synthesisers and other electronic instruments are common, and slow jams adopted from Chicago house musicians like The Fingers, Tony Humphries and Robert Owen are also standard. Stars of kwaito include Trompies, Bongo Maffin, TKZee, Mandoza and Boom Shaka. The band Tree63 also emerged, first known for their hit single, &quot;A Million Lights&quot; and then further popularised by their version of Matt Redman&#x27;s &quot;Blessed Be Your Name&quot;.

===Gospel===
The biggest star of 1990s gospel was Rebecca Malope, whose 1995 album &quot;Shwele Baba&quot; was extremely popular. Malope continues to record, in addition to performers such as Lusanda Spiritual Group, Barorisi Ba Morena, Amadodana Ase Wesile, Vuyo Mokoena and International Pentacoastal Church Choir, Rayreed Soul Beat, Lundi, Joyous Celebration, and Scent From Above who have performed in Botswana occasionally. In 2000s Vuyo Mooena has emerged as the best selling Gospel artist. His albums have been audited to be in Top 5 selling in the country. In his album he sang in all South African languages like Venda, Shangaan, Sotho, Zulu and Xhosa. The industry has also been joined by the likes of Hlengiwe Mhlaba (whose Aphendule is popular) and Solly Moholo. Also we see the new singers like Oleseng Shuping become popular and he won the king of gospel award.

===Afrikaans music===
Prof Piet de Villiers was the front runner prior to 1994 with his compositions of Boerneef.

The period after 1994 saw a dramatic growth in the popularity of Afrikaans music. Numerous new young Afrikaans singers (soloists and groups) released CDs and DVDs and attracted large audiences at &quot;kunstefeeste&quot; (art festivals) such as the &quot;Klein Karoo Nasionale Kunstefees – KKNK&quot; in Oudtshoorn, &quot;Aardklop&quot; in Potchefstroom and &quot;Innibos&quot; in Nelspruit.

Apart from dozens of new songs being introduced into the Afrikaans music market, it became popular for modern young artists to sing old Afrikaans songs on a stage or in a pub, with crowds of young admirers singing along. The reason for the dramatic increase in the popularity of Afrikaans music can be speculated about. One theory is that the end of Apartheid in 1994 also meant the end of the privileged position that the Afrikaans culture had in South Africa. After losing the privileged protection and promotion of the language and the culture by the State, the Afrikaans-speaking community seems to have spontaneously started embracing and developing their language and culture. This was due to pop artists like Steve Hofmeyr, Nádine, Kurt Darren, and Nicolis Louw bringing a new fresh sound in Afrikaans Music. Many of the songs sung and/or written by these artists are similar in sound to Euro dance music. Critics would claim that all an Afrikaans pop artist needs for a song to be popular is a catchy tune and an easy beat. This is due to the massive popularity of a form of couples dancing called &quot;langarm&quot; or &quot;sokkie&quot;. The dance halls where this takes place could be considered as night clubs but they play almost exclusively Afrikaans pop music. The Afrikaans pop music market therefore generates tremendous demand for new material.

===Alternative===
The 1990s could be seen as the genesis of a vibrant alternative music scene in South Africa. The Voëlvry movement was a major influence in establishing the scene, but subject material markedly shifted from protest to the more abstract and personal. Major festivals like Oppikoppi and Woodstock were started and grew steadily, firmly cementing the niche under predominantly white university students exploring a newfound intellectual independence after the fall of apartheid. The first band to reach any major recognition was Springbok Nude Girls established in 1994. Other notable acts established in this decade were Lithium (est. circa 1993), The Outsiders (est. 1991), Nine (est. 1992), Fetish (est. 1996), Wonderboom (est. 1996), Boo! (est. 1997), The Awakening (est. 1996), Henry Ate, Just Jinger (est. 1996), Fuzigish and Battery 9.

===Metal===
In the early and mid-1980s there were bands like Black Rose, Stretch, Razor, Lynx, Pentagon, Montreaux, Unchained and Osiris. Then came the new breed of South African metal with a band called Ragnärok, South Africa&#x27;s first thrash metal band, formed by Dean G Smith who were labelled as South Africa&#x27;s Metallica and the only metal band at that time to have a cult following. They formed in South Johannesburg in 1986 playing covers for a short while and then moving on to original music only. Through the late 1980s and into the early 1990s, South Africa grew a well supported metal scene, marked by the release of Johannesburg-based Odysseys&#x27; self-titled album in 1991. There was a burgeoning crossover punk/metal scene in the major centres, particularly spurred on by Cape Towns&#x27; Voice of Destruction and Johannesburg based Urban Assault in the very late 1980s. Johannesburg developed an extreme metal scene in 1992 with rising grindcore/death metal act Retribution Denied, Boksburg based macabre/death metal act Debauchery followed by Pretoria doom metal band Funeral, Christian metal act Abhorrence and Insurrection, Metalmorphosis, Sacrifist and Agro, the latter two acts still perform today. The Cape Town metal scene was on a high in the mid-1990s, driven largely by Pothole and Sacraphyx. Pothole would release two critically acclaimed albums on South Africa&#x27;s most successful punk/metal label, Way-Cool Records – their debut &quot;Force-Fed Hatred&quot; is still the top selling South African metal album to date. Whilst many of the acts failed to find commercial success in terms of CD sales, there was a devout following nationally and local metal bands soon opened the national touring circuit to a higher extent than most other genres. It also attracted international artists to tour the country almost immediately after the demise of apartheid, with some of the most respected international artists having seen fit to visit the country since.

==The 2000s==

===Blues Rock===
The Blues Rock scene has dramatically emerged in South Africa. Albert Frost, Dan Patlansky, The Black Cat Bones, Gerald Clark, Crimson House Blues, The Blues Broers and Boulevard Blues band are some of the most prominent blues acts in South-Africa. Figures like Piet Botha and Valiant Swart have largely contributed to the South-African Blues and Rock scene.

===Afrikaans===

In a resurgence (an increase or revival after a period of little activity, popularity, or occurrence) that has been linked by some to freedom from Apartheid guilt, Afrikaans music saw a surge in new artists, album releases and sales after 2000. In 2004 an Afrikaans album (by balladeer Steve Hofmeyr) was named best-selling album of the year.

In 2007 an Afrikaans song about Boer War general Koos de la Rey by Bok van Blerk became a hit amid debates on whether it represented a call to arms for the reinstatement of Afrikaner rule or just expressed cultural nostalgia.

While the boom in the Afrikaans pop industry has continued from the previous decade through the popularity of arts festivals and dance halls, other Afrikaans music genres experienced a revival of sorts in the new millennium. Rock and alternative Afrikaans music had stagnated somewhat after the heady days of the &quot;Voëlvry&quot; tour and the alternative movement. Signs of a revival could be found in the arrival of Karen Zoid on the music scene due to her distinct alternative sound.

Shortly afterwards, a band of young rockers called &quot;Fokofpolisiekar&quot; became the first group to create alternative rock in Afrikaans. Their controversial name (translated as Fuckoffpolicecar), statements and behavior drew much public attention, making them a symbol of the Afrikaans Rock revival movement. Lead singer Francois Van Coke and songwriter Hunter Kennedy have gone on to explore other genres of music also not previously popular in Afrikaans and have ventured into more commercial routes.

Shortly after the arrival of this and other rock acts, the first Afrikaans television music channel (MK89) was opened which focused mainly on rock music. The Afrikaans (and English) rock and alternative music scene has been booming ever since. Bands like Battery9, Terminatrix, NuL, K.O.B.U.S. and Thys Nywerheid continue to reinvent alternative Afrikaans music, while Jack Parow has continued the Cape&#x27;s development of Afrikaans rap from pioneers Brasse vannie Kaap, finding success as far afield as Holland with his 2009 single &quot;Cooler as Ekke&quot;.

===2009 Breakthrough Experimentalism===
From 2009 into 2010, two unique and eclectic but thoroughly South African groups in particular received high acclaim from international music media, and both groups challenged traditional genre descriptions. They significantly increased global recognition of contemporary South African music culture.

BLK JKS&#x27; experimental Afro-rock took inspiration from The Mars Volta to blend their Zulu heritage and township origins with modern sounds and equipment and an approach to music-making that seems entirely devoid of boundaries, while maintaining the sweet melodies and rhythmic qualities of South Africa&#x27;s traditional music. They received an important boost after performing in Opening Ceremony of 2010 FIFA World Cup.

Die Antwoord has challenged conventions of hip-hop through its blend of English, Afrikaans, and local slang.

In 2016, singer Refentse Morake made waves for releasing his debut album solely in Afrikaans, becoming the first black singer to do so.

===Drum and bass===
The South African drum and bass scene began in the mid nineties. In 2000, events such as Homegrown became a prominent fixture in Cape Town and a launching platform for international and local artists such as Counterstrike, SFR, Niskerone, Tasha Baxter, Anti Alias and Rudeone. Other regular events include It Came From The Jungle in Cape Town and Science Friksun in Johannesburg.

A weekly Sublime drum and bass radio show is hosted by Hyphen on Bush Radio.

===Psychedelic trance===
South African psytrance is a form of darker psychedelic trance music that started and is produced mostly in South Africa. Unlike the Russian dark psytrance, South African psytrance is more rhythmic, melodic and danceable, yet keeps the &#x27;nasty-like&#x27; attitude. Notable record labels include Timecode Records, Mind Manipulation Device and Nano Records.

==Modern day==
The South African music scene has continued to flourish in the 2000s. The decade has seen the rise of Xhosa singer Simphiwe Dana, whose success has seen her hailed as the &quot;new Miriam Makeba&quot;, with her unique combination of jazz, pop, and traditional music. Another similar young singer is Thandiswa Mazwai, originally a kwaito singer with Bongo Maffin. Thandiswa combined local hip-hop rhythms with traditional Xhosa sounds, creating a rich textured style. 2006 saw the rise of Shwi Nomtekhala, a duo combining mbaqanga rhythms and maskandi sounds. The duo has become one of the most influential new acts on the music scene today, outselling even kwaito artists. Their third album &quot;Wangisiza Baba&quot; was a major hit in the country. Cape Town-based female artist Verity has been recognised internationally for innovation in the music industry for selling 2000 copies of her album Journey before it was actually recorded. Rap group &quot;2 and a Half Secondz&quot; has found recognition in Cape Town suburb, Delft since 2009. Cape Town based band Crimson House Blues has made waves throughout the live circuit being hailed as one of the greatest live acts in the country. In addition Willim Welsyn, part of the Afrikaans rock band Willim Welsyn en Sunrise Toffies was nominated and won multiple awards in the Afrikaans Alternative categories.

Nianell, the South African superstar, is also another internationally recognised artist in modern South African music, combing Folk, Classical, Pop, Country, and Celtic music that make her own unique sound. She has released seven albums with songs that switch back and forth between Afrikaans and English. Her first platinum hit that sold more than 2 million copies was &quot;Who Painted The Moon&quot; that was also covered by international superstar Hayley Westenra. In early 2011, she made her initial debut in the U.S. with her compilation album &quot;Who Painted The Moon&quot;.

Ladysmith Black Mambazo remain one of the world&#x27;s most popular choral groups and still retain popularity in South Africa, with their latest offering being the highly praised &quot;Ilembe&quot; (2007/2008). The legendary group boasts three grammy wins. The Mahotella Queens also remain high-selling, and – with the death of long-time groaner Mahlathini in 1999 – have recorded several new albums, including their 2007 release &quot;Siyadumisa (Songs of Praise)&quot;. 2008 has also seen the return of a former singer with the Mahotella Queens, Irene Mawela. Mawela appeared on thousands of mbaqanga and mgqashiyo recording sessions well throughout the 1960s and the 1970s, recording mainly for Gallo Record Company, often as part of the line-ups of the Mahotella Queens, the Mgababa Queens, Izintombi Zomgqashiyo, and also under her own name (though sometimes as Irene &amp; The Sweet Melodians, or Irene &amp; The Zebra Queens). In 1983 she left the company to record as a solo artist, with a successful Venda-traditional release &quot;Khanani Yanga&quot;. Mawela left the music business in the late 1980s, but returned in November 2007 with a brand-new album called &quot;Tlhokomela Sera&quot;, which combines modern contemporary sounds with pure gospel music, making what Mawela calls &quot;gospel jive&quot;.

The music scene in South Africa is focused around four major areas, Johannesburg, Cape Town, Durban and Bloemfontein. One of the characteristics of the scene is the strong sense of community which sees artist, promoters and venues all actively involved in developing the local talent. Bloemfontein&#x27;s music focus is centred predominantly around the metal and Afrikaans genres. Johannesburg, Cape Town and Durban are far more wide-ranging in the genres of music covered by bands and artists. Cape Town is a hotbed for the underground music scene, generally held to be more experimental than the music produced in the other centres. Potchefstroom seems to be the newest development ground for Afrikaans rock music, with various bands like Straatligkinders making their start here.

The introduction of the South African Music Awards (SAMA), intended to recognise accomplishment in the South African recording industry has raised the awareness of local artists and bands. The awards are given in various categories, including album of the year, best newcomer, best artists (male and female) and the best duo or group. South African Music Award winners include Karen Zoid, Freshlyground, Tasha Baxter and Seether.

Uniquely African music aside, the South African music scene has, to a large extent, been characterised by bands seeking to emulate popular genres abroad. However, recent years have seen South African music begin to develop a truly original sound.

South Africa has several annual music festivals including Woodstock South Africa, MotherFudd, Oppikoppi, Rocking the Daisies and Splashy Fen. The music festivals cater to different genres and styles of music. Motherfudd is an exclusively metal festival held early in the year. The 2008 Motherfudd festival had a line-up of 30 bands with 2 stages and took place near Hartebeespoort. The Oppikoppi festival started in 1994 and is held in Limpopo, near the mining town of Northam. Originally a rock festival, Oppikoppi has expanded to include other genres. Splashy Fen is an annual Easter festival held on a farm near Underberg in KwaZulu-Natal, with a focus on rock and reggae music. Since 2016, &quot;The Legend&quot; stage at Splashy, convened by Don Clarke and Dicky Roberts has brought well known local legends back to the festival, including P J Powers in 2019. Rocking the Daisies is an annual music festival which is held outside Cape Town in Darling on the Cloof wine estate. It was established in 2005 with a focus upon rock music and is a &quot;green&quot; festival for which it has garnered awards.

&quot;Skouspel&quot; is a very popular televised annual concert sponsored by the Afrikaans family-magazine Huisgenoot, hosted at the Sun City resort. Skouspel (translates as &quot;spectacle&quot;) focuses primarily on Afrikaans music and regularly features some of the biggest names in the Afrikaans music scene along with new artists.

Although the local music scene has continued to grow exponentially since the 2000s, in 2016 a substantial amount of South Africans still consumed foreign music content opposed to local content.

== South African house and electronic dance music ==

=== Kwaito ===

Kwaito, a music genre that originated in Soweto, Johannesburg, in the 1980s and went mainstream in the 1990s, is a variation of house music characterised by the incorporation of African sounds and samples. Unlike other styles of house music, Kwaito songs typically have a slower tempo and feature catchy melodic and percussive loop samples, along with deep bass lines and vocals. Although it shares similarities with hip hop, kwaito has its own distinct approach to vocal delivery, blending singing, rapping, and shouting in a distinct manner.

=== Deep house ===

South African deep house is commonly referred to as SA deep house or Deep SA. Johannesburg and Pretoria are unofficially acknowledged as the focal points of South Africa&#x27;s deep house culture. Prominent figures in South African deep house include Vinny Da Vinci, DJ Christos, Glen Lewis, DJ Fresh, Lady Lea, Bob Mabena, Fistaz Mixwell, Jazzuelle, Lazarusman, Kat La Kat, Donald, House Victimz, Sishisoul, Jullian Gomes, Liquideep and Chymamusique. In 2014, Vinny Da Vinci released his 10th and as per stipulated final deep house album via the record label, House Afrika.

=== Afro house ===

Afro house emerged in the 1990s, although it is speculated that its roots may have been established in the late 1980s, influenced by the prevalent presence of kwaito, mbaqanga, and house music both locally and internationally. Unfortunately, this period coincided with the apartheid regime, making it challenging to document and disseminate information. Notably, kwaito-associated artists like Brenda Fassie and Sipho Mabuse gained international recognition, with hits on global charts such as KISS-FM and Capitol Radio, serving as the world&#x27;s initial exposure to South African house music. During the era, musicians such as Vinny Da Vinci, DJ Christos, and the Revolution twins were actively involved in hosting parties and DJing at various locations.

===Techno===

The first South African live techno band was Kraftreaktor. Amoraim and Gareth Hinde are from Kraftreaktor and performed at several raves, playing mainly techno-trance music with guest musicians sometimes. Their music was influenced by themselves, but included a unique South African touch. They sometimes integrated African sounds and ethnomusicologist, Gavin Coppenhall.

=== Shangaan electro ===
Shangaan electro also referred to as Tsonga electro, is a dance movement and musical style which originated from a contemporary interpretation of local folk traditions in South African townships. The genre incorporates elements from Tsonga disco and kwaito. Spearheaded by DJ Khwaya and producer Nozinja, it developed into a recognised &quot;Afro-futurist&quot; genre of electronic dance music.

=== Bacardi house ===

During the 2000s, a group of producers including DJ Spoko, DJ Mujava, House Station, Mzo Bullet, and others spearheaded bacardi house, commonly known as &quot;sgubhu saPitori&quot; which featured popular tracks like &quot;Township Funk,&quot; &quot;Tobetsa,&quot; &quot;Casablanca,&quot; and &quot;Mugwanti.&quot; Bacardi house, combines percussive elements with pop-synth melodies.

Vusi Ma R5, born Itumeleng Mosoeu, is another Bacardi pioneer known for hits such as &quot;Tse Nyane&quot; and &quot;Thaba (Ke Chanchitse). He is honorifically known as the King of Bacardi.

=== Bolobedu house ===
Bolobedu house, also known as bolo house, combines Afro-house instrumentals with Bolobedu melodies typically sung using high-pitched auto-tune. The term &quot;bolo house&quot; is derived from the Balobedu, an ethnic group hailing from the Limpopo province. Similar to this ethnic group, the origins of bolo house can be traced back to the late 2000s. Many early bolo house tracks gained popularity regionally, such as DJ Rakzen&#x27;s &quot;Phindi&quot; However, it wasn&#x27;t until the release of DJ Call Me&#x27;s album &quot;Marry Me Season 1&quot; around 2008 that the subgenre garnered national recognition. Bolo house draws inspiration from the sound pioneered by record producer Bojo Mujo, who was born in Limpopo and raised in Gauteng, particularly Pretoria. He rose to prominence in the 2000s with anthemic releases like &quot;Shiwelele&quot; and &quot;Summer Rain&quot;. Notable songs include King Monada’s &quot;Malwedhe&quot; and Master KG and Nomcebo Zikode&#x27;s &quot;Jerusalema&quot;.

=== Gqom ===

Gqom, sometimes referred to as &quot;3-step&quot; (also a subgenre of gqom itself), emerged in the early 2010s in Durban. It was pioneered by music producers Naked Boyz, Sbucardo, DJ Lag, Rudeboyz, Nasty Boyz, Griffit Vigo, Distruction Boyz, Menzi Shabane, and Citizen Boy. The genre is characterized by minimal, raw, and repetitive beats with heavy bass, often incorporating elements of techno, creating a dark and hypnotic club sound. Unlike other house music styles, gqom does not typically use the four-on-the-floor rhythm pattern. The genre was developed by a young generation of technologically skilled DJs who produced music in a DIY fashion, using software such as FL Studio. Gqom and afrotech record producers often blend the two genres together.

Other notable gqom artists are inclusive of Babes Wodumo, Busiswa, DJ Tira, Moonchild Sanelly and Okmalumkoolkat.

FAKA&#x27;s music from the duo&#x27;s &quot;Amaqhawe&quot; EP was selected by Donatella Versace for the Versace Spring 2019 Menswear Collection fashion show.

In 2018, the South Korean boy band BTS released &quot;&quot;Idol&quot;&quot; from their &quot;Love Yourself: Answer&quot; album, which drew inspiration from and incorporated gqom rhythmic elements. The band additionally promoted an alternative digital-only version of the song featuring Trinidadian-American rapper and singer Nicki Minaj.

=== Lekompo ===
The precise origins of lekompo&#x27;s foundational sound are subject to debate. However, there are recognizable elements evocative of various music genres linked to Limpopo.

===Amapiano===

Amapiano, is a subgenre of house and kwaito music, thought to have emerged in the mid-2010s. The genre combines deep house, jazz, and lounge music. Amapiano stands out for its incorporation of high-pitched piano melodies reminiscent of kwaito, characterized by South African basslines and a slower tempo. Additionally, it integrates rhythms from 1990s South African house music and percussion elements from gqom. Central to the genre, is the usage of the slit drum (log drum) popularized by record producer MDU aka TRP.

Other notable amapiano artists include MFR Souls, Kabza de Small, DJ Maphorisa, Mpura, Kamo Mphela, Tyla, Major League DJz, Uncle Waffles, Kelvin Momo and DBN Gogo.

Smash hit, &quot;Monalisa&quot; by Nigerian singer-songwriter Lojay featuring American musician Chris Brown incorporated percussive elements typical of amapiano music.

== South African hip hop ==
In South Africa, the hip hop scene intersects with kwaito, a music genre that highlights African culture and societal concerns. Rappers like Pope Troy utilised socio-economic issues affecting South Africa&#x27;s political landscape and hip hop culture, employing a linguistic approach to engage the masses in discussions about the technical factors contributing to the issues.

South African hip hop has emerged as a significant force in the country&#x27;s mainstream music scene. From its roots as a form of political expression in Cape Town during the 1990s to the emergence of artists like HHP, AKA and Riky Rick, it has evolved over the decades. Notable South African hip hop musicians include Tuks Senganga, Cassper Nyovest, Nasty C, Kwesta, Khuli Chana, iFani, Mo&#x27;Molemi, Da L.E.S, Sjava, K.O, Frank Casino, Okmalumkoolkat, Fifi Cooper, Anatii, Emtee, Shane Eagle, YoungstaCPT, A-Reece, Costa Titch and Big Zulu.

Die Antwoord, an alternative hip hop group, achieved global mainstream success. Reflecting the new &#x27;Zef&#x27; counter-culture in its &quot;cheap-and-dirty values&quot;. The band achieved worldwide attention with their self-published debut thanks to two striking and humorous YouTube music videos released in 2010 that rapidly reached viral proportions. The highly polarised international response to their music helped them secure an album deal with Cherrytree Records, an imprint of Interscope. They also famously triggered a feud with American pop singer Lady Gaga, who offered them the chance to open for her on her Born This Way Tour, which they blatantly refused.

=== Motswako ===

Motswako, a subgenre of hip hop emerged in the 1990s originating in South Africa and widely popularized in Botswana. The genre is characterized by t laid-back rap delivery and a consistent beat. It often incorporates reggae-influenced Afro-centric or drum and bass beats, occasionally employing a four-on-the-floor rhythm. Minimalistic electronic elements provide a backdrop for the rap vocals to shine. In its early stages, Motswako featured rap lyrics predominantly in Setswana, alongside American vernacular, with other South African languages like Zulu, Xhosa, and Afrikaans also being incorporated. The lyrical themes range from spoken word poetry to localized socio-political or economic commentary, drug culture, unity, pride in local culture, romance, objectification of women, pursuit of wealth, aspirations, and celebration. Key figures of motswako include Stoane Seate, Hip Hop Pantsula (HHP), Cassper Nyovest, Tuks Senganga, Mo&#x27;Molemi, Khuli Chana and Spoek Mathambo.

=== Kasi rap ===
Kasi rap, predominantly makes usage of isiZulu and isiXhosa, focused on themes such as adversity, family, and aspirations for a better life. Pro (formerly Pro Kid) was a central figure in the genre, and his album &quot;Heads And Tails&quot; (2005), released under TS Records, solidified his role as its leading voice. In the Western and Eastern Cape, kasi rap transformed into spaza (meaning &quot;tuckshop&quot;), sharing similar thematic explorations. Driemanskap stood out as one of the prominent groups in this movement, alongside other noteworthy artists like Maxhoseni, Kanyi, Red Button, Manelisi, and Deep Soweto.

=== Muthaland Crunk ===
In 2008, the group Jozi (comprising Da L.E.S, Bongani Fassie, Crazy Lu, and Ishmael) blended maskandi with trap in their debut album &quot;Muthaland Crunk&quot;, catapulting them to superstardom. However, the subgenre, &quot;muthaland crunk&quot; faded along with the decline of crunk.

=== African trap music (ATM) ===
African trap music, commonly referred to as ATM, is a subgenre of trap which emerged in 2015. The song that&#x27;s said to have initiated the genre was &quot;Roll Up&quot; Emtee&#x27;s breakthrough hit single, which was released in the same year, citing lyrics, &quot;krapa fasa, baba, let&#x27;s start rolling up the jets&quot;. The genre was spearheaded by musicians Emtee, Sjava, and Saudi. Other significant contributors include Sims, Ranks, Just G and record producer Ruff. African trap music is defined by its trap production infused with South African influences. In terms of lyrics, it often features storytelling as well as relatable themes (black stories of love, survival, success and family politics, among others), and melodies that draw inspiration from South African genres such as Afropop, maskandi, kwaito and mbhaqanga. In contrast to the prevalent use of auto-tune in trap music vocals, Saudi, Sjava, and Emtee rarely used the popular software. Additionally, the majority of the lyrics are sung in South African languages, predominantly IsiZulu. Saudi and Sjava had songs &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Seasons&quot; featured on the Billboard charts through their contributions to the &quot;Black Panther soundtrack&quot;. Additionally, both Emtee and Sjava&#x27;s debut albums, &quot;Avery&quot; and &quot;Isina Muva&quot;, achieved gold status.

=== Gqom trap ===
Gqom trap, which blends elements of gqom and trap music, originated in the 2010s and was developed and introduced by the Durban hip hop collective Witness The Funk.

<text>The Ottawa Rebel was a team in the National Lacrosse League based in Ottawa, Ontario from 2001 until 2003. They initially played at the Corel Centre (now called the Canadian Tire Centre), but part-way through the 2002 season moved to the smaller, but centrally located, Ottawa Civic Centre. From 1997 until 2000 the team was located in Syracuse, New York and was called the Syracuse Smash.

The Rebel was owned by the Brad Watters group which also brought lacrosse to Toronto and Montreal.

In their first season in Ottawa, the Rebel had one win and thirteen losses and finished last of nine teams. Their second season was slightly better, with four wins and twelve losses, but due to tie breakers they finished fourth in the Northern Division and thirteenth overall behind the Calgary Roughnecks, who also finished with a 4–12 record. In their third and final year in Ottawa they again had four wins and twelve losses, placing them fourth in the Northern Division again but tenth out of twelve in the overall league standings.

As the Syracuse Smash they were last overall all three years prompting the move to the Canadian capital.

The franchise became inactive after the 2003 season. In 2005, it was purchased by Bruce Urban and moved to Edmonton, Alberta, becoming the Edmonton Rush. In 2024, it was announced that the National Lacrosse League would return to Ottawa as the Ottawa Black Bears.

<doc id="246415" wikidata="Q623149" url="?curid=246415" title="Billboard">
<text>A billboard (also called a hoarding in the UK and many other parts of the world) is a large outdoor advertising structure (a billing board), typically found in high-traffic areas such as alongside busy roads. Billboards present large advertisements to passing pedestrians and drivers. Typically brands use billboards to build their brands or to push for their new products.

The largest ordinary-sized billboards are located primarily on major highways, expressways, or principal arterials, and command high-density consumer exposure (mostly to vehicular traffic). These afford the greatest visibility due not only to their size, but because they allow creative &quot;customizing&quot; through extensions and embellishments.

Posters are the other common form of billboard advertising, located mostly along primary and secondary arterial roads. Posters are in a smaller format and are viewed principally by residents and commuter traffic, with some pedestrian exposure.

==Advertising style==
Billboard advertisements are designed to catch a person&#x27;s attention and create a memorable impression very quickly, leaving the reader thinking about the advertisement after they have driven past it. They have to be readable in a very short time because they are usually read while being passed at high speeds. Thus there are usually only a few words, in large print, and a humorous or arresting image in brilliant color.

Some billboard designs spill outside the actual space given to them by the billboard, with parts of figures hanging off the billboard edges or jutting out of the billboard in three dimensions. An example in the United States around the turn of the 21st century was the Chick-fil-A billboards (a chicken sandwich fast food chain), which had three-dimensional cow figures in the act of painting the billboards with misspelled anti-beef slogans such as &quot;friends don&#x27;t let friends eat beef.&quot;

The first &quot;scented billboard&quot;, an outdoor sign emitting the odors of black pepper and charcoal to suggest a grilled steak, was erected on NC 150 near Mooresville, North Carolina by the Bloom grocery chain. The sign depicted a giant cube of beef being pierced by a large fork that extended to the ground. The scents were emitted between 7–10 A.M. and 4–7  P.M. from 28 May 2010 through 18 June 2010.

==Types==
===Painted===
Almost all painted billboards were created in large studios. The image was projected on the series of paper panels that made up the billboard. Line drawings were done, then traced with a pounce wheel that created perforated lines. The patterns were then &quot;pounced&quot; onto the board with a chalk-filled pounce bag, marking the outlines of the figures or objects. Using oil paints, artists would use large brushes to paint the image. Once the panels were installed using hydraulic cranes, artists would go up on the installed billboard and touch up the edges between panels. These large, painted billboards were especially popular in Los Angeles where historic firms such as Foster &amp; Kleiser and Pacific Outdoor Advertising dominated the industry. Eventually, these painted billboards gave way to graphic reproduction, but hand-painted billboards are still in use in some areas where only a single board or two is required. The &quot;Sunset Strip&quot; in Los Angeles is one area where hand-painted billboards can still be found, usually to advertise upcoming films or albums.

A technical invention called &quot;trivision&quot; allowed three different images to be rotated for presentation.

===Digital===

A digital billboard shows varying imagery and text created with computer programs and software. Digital billboards can be designed to display running text, have several different displays from the same company, or provide several companies with a certain time slot during the day. Flexible and real-time scheduling can decrease traditional upkeep and maintenance costs, and some billboards may measure audiences or serve dynamic content. 

Using digital billboards dynamically has come to be known as programmatic out-of-home advertising. Billboard posters can play audio using conductive ink; when touched, the posters begin to play sounds. Digital billboards can also employ 3D effects.

===Mobile===
Outdoor advertising, such as a mobile billboard, is effective because it is difficult to ignore. According to a UK national survey, it is also memorable. Capitol Communications Group found that 81.7% of those polled recalled images they saw on a moving multi-image sign. This is compared to a 19% retention rate for static signs.

Unlike a typical billboard, mobile billboards are able to go directly to their target audience. They can be placed wherever there is heavy foot traffic due to an event – including convention centers, train stations, airports, and sports arenas. They can repeat routes, ensuring that an advertiser&#x27;s message is not only noticed but that information is retained through repetition.

===Multi-purpose===

Billboards may be multi-purpose. An advertising sign can integrate its main purpose with a telecommunications antenna or public lighting support. Usually, the structure has a steel pole with a coupling flange on the above-fitted advertising billboard structure that can contain telecommunications antennas. The lighting, wiring, and antennas are placed inside the structure.

===Other===

Common along highways are free-standing two-sided as well as three-sided billboards. Other types of billboards include the billboard bicycle attached to the back of a bicycle or the mobile billboard, a special advertising trailer to hoist big banners. Mechanical billboards display three different messages, with three advertisements attached to a conveyor inside the billboard. There are also three-dimensional billboards, such as the ones at Piccadilly Circus, London. Traditional billboards consist of a large format advertisement printed on a resistant material such as vinyl; this is placed on a large metal structure, which makes it one of the media with the most visibility and high impact within the advertising field. 

==Placement==

Some of the most prominent billboards are alongside highways; since passing drivers typically have little to occupy their attention, the impact of the billboard is greater. Billboards are often drivers&#x27; primary method of finding lodging, food, and fuel on unfamiliar highways. There were approximately 450,000 billboards on US highways in 1991. Somewhere between 5,000 and 15,000 are erected each year. Current numbers are put at 368,263, according to the OAAA (Outdoor Advertising Association of America). In Europe billboards are a major component and source of income in urban street furniture concepts.

An interesting use of billboards unique to highways was the Burma-Shave advertisements between 1925 and 1963, which had 4- or 5-part messages on multiple signs, keeping the reader hooked by the promise of a punchline at the end. This example is in the National Museum of American History at the Smithsonian Institution:

These sorts of multi-sign advertisements are no longer common, though they are not extinct. One example, advertising for the NCAA, depicts a basketball player aiming a shot on one billboard; on the next one, 90 yards (82 meters) away, is the basket. Another example is the numerous billboards advertising the roadside attraction South of the Border near Dillon, SC, along I-95 in many states.

Many cities have high densities of billboards, especially where there is dense pedestrian traffic—Times Square in New York City is a good example. Because of the lack of space in cities, these billboards are placed on the sides of buildings and sometimes are free-standing billboards hanging above buildings. Billboards on the sides of buildings create different stylistic opportunities, with artwork that incorporates features of the building into the design, such as using windows as eyes, or for gigantic frescoes that adorn the entire building.

===Visual and environmental concerns===
Many groups such as Scenic America have complained that billboards on highways cause excessive clearing of trees and intrude on the surrounding landscape, with billboards&#x27; bright colors, lights, and large fonts making it difficult to focus on anything else, making them a form of visual pollution - a state of affairs evoked pithily in Ogden Nash&#x27;s parody of Joyce Kilmer&#x27;s oft-quoted poem &quot; Trees&quot;:

Other groups believe that billboards and advertising contribute negatively to the mental climate of a culture by promoting products as providing feelings of completeness, wellness, and popularity to motivate purchase. B.U.G.A. U.P. was a movement that commenced in Australia and took direct action against primarily tobacco and alcohol billboards. Another focal point for this sentiment would be the magazine AdBusters, which will often showcase politically motivated billboard and other advertising vandalism, called culture jamming. Billboards have been criticized as an example of attention theft.
In 2000, rooftops in Athens had grown so thick with billboards that it was difficult to see its famous architecture. In preparation for the 2004 Summer Olympics, the city embarked on a successful four-year project demolishing the majority of rooftop billboards to beautify the city, overcoming resistance from advertisers and building owners. Most of these billboards were illegal but had been ignored until then.

In 2007, São Paulo, Brazil instituted a billboard ban because there were no viable regulations of the billboard industry. Today, São Paulo is working with outdoor companies to rebuild the outdoor infrastructure in a way that will reflect the vibrant business climate of the city while adopting good regulations to control growth.

===Road safety concerns===
The most comprehensive review of the literature to date by the Centre for Accident Research and Road Safety-Queensland (CARRS-Q) (Australia) found that crash risk increases by approximately 25-29% in the presence of digital roadside advertising signs (digital billboard) compared to control areas. There is an emerging trend in the literature suggesting that roadside advertising signs can increase crash risk, particularly for those signs that have the capacity to frequently change (often referred to as digital billboards).

In the US, many cities enacted laws banning billboards as early as 1909 (California Supreme Court, &quot;Varney &amp; Green vs. Williams&quot;) but the First Amendment has made this difficult. A San Diego law championed by Pete Wilson in 1971 cited traffic safety and driver distraction as the reason for the billboard ban but was narrowly overturned by the Supreme Court in 1981, in part because it banned non-commercial as well as commercial billboards.

===Legal restrictions===
Billboards are largely absent in Australia&#x27;s capital city, Canberra, due to a 1937 ordinance that prohibited unauthorized signs on Commonwealth land. In 2017, the Australian Capital Territory considered relaxing this law to allow more outdoor advertising. An Inquiry into billboards received a record 166 submissions, with only 6 respondents supporting allowing more advertising in the Territory. The other submissions supported the current laws, or pointed to shortcomings and loopholes of the current laws, such as the allowance of mobile billboards, bus wrap advertising and political campaign signs, as well a failure to enforce existing laws.

In 1964, the negative impact of the over-proliferation of signage was abundantly evident in Houston, Texas, US, and it motivated Lady Bird Johnson to ask her husband to create a law. At the same time, the outdoor advertising industry was becoming aware that excessive signs, some literally blocking another, were bad for business.

In 1965, the Highway Beautification Act was signed into law. The act applied only to &quot;Federal Aid Primary&quot; and &quot;Defense&quot; highways and limited billboards to commercial and industrial zones created by states and municipalities. It required each state to set standards based on &quot;customary use&quot; for the size, lighting, and spacing of billboards and prohibited city and state governments from removing billboards without paying compensation to the owner. The act requires states to maintain &quot;effective control&quot; of billboards or lose 10% of their federal highway dollars.

The act also required the screening of junk yards adjacent to regulated highways.

Around major holidays, volunteer groups erected highway signs offering free coffee at rest stops. These were specifically exempted in the act.

Currently, four states—Vermont, Alaska, Hawaii, and Maine—have prohibited billboards. Vermont&#x27;s law went into effect in 1968, Hawaii&#x27;s law went into effect in 1927, Maine&#x27;s law went into effect in 1977, and Alaska&#x27;s law went into effect upon its achievement of statehood in 1959.

In the UK, billboards are controlled as adverts as part of the planning system. To display an illegal advert (that is, without planning permission) is a criminal offense with a fine of up to £2500 per offense (per poster). All of the large UK outdoor advertisers such as CBS Outdoor, JCDecaux, Clear Channel, Titan, and Primesight have numerous convictions for such crimes.

In São Paulo, a city of twelve million in Brazil, Billboards and advertising on vehicles have been banned since January 2007. It also restricted the dimensions of advertising on shop fronts.

In British Columbia, a province of Canada, billboards are restricted to 300m away from roadways, the government also retains the right to remove any billboard it deems an unsafe distraction.

In Toronto, a city of over 2 and a half million in Canada, a municipal tax on billboards was implemented in April 2010. A portion of the tax will help fund arts programs in the city.

In Sweden, there is a general ban against billboards within the road area (typically the road plus ditch), except for standardized signs such as gas stations, restaurants, or hotels. But there is no ban against them outside the road if the landowner approves. Many farmers along major routes earn some money from such signs.

==Usages==

===Highway===

Many signs advertise local restaurants and shops in the coming miles and are crucial to drawing business in small towns. One example is Wall Drug, which in 1936 erected billboards advertising &quot;free ice water&quot;. The town of Wall, South Dakota, was essentially built around the many thousands of customers per day those billboards brought in (20,000 in 1981). Some signs were placed at great distances, with slogans such as &quot;Only 827 miles to Wall Drug, with FREE ice water.&quot; In some areas the signs were so dense that one almost immediately followed the last. This situation changed after the Highway Beautification Act was passed; the proliferation of Wall Drug billboards is sometimes cited as one of the reasons the bill was passed. After the passage of the act, other states (such as Oregon) embarked on highway beautification efforts.

===Railway===
Billboard advertising in underground stations, especially, is perhaps a place where they find a greater degree of acceptability and may assist in maintaining a neat, vibrant, and safe atmosphere if not too distracting. Museum Station, Sydney has mounted restored 1940s billboard panels along the platforms that are in keeping with its heritage listing.

===Big name advertisers===
Billboards are also used to advertise national or global brands, particularly in more densely populated urban areas. According to the Outdoor Advertising Association of America, the top billboard advertisers in the United States in 2017 were McDonald&#x27;s, Apple and GEICO. A large number of wireless phone companies, movie companies, car manufacturers and banks are high on the list as well.

===Tobacco advertising===
Prior to 1999, billboards were a major venue of cigarette advertising; 10% of Michigan billboards advertise alcohol and tobacco, according to the Detroit Free Press. This is particularly true in countries where tobacco advertisements are not allowed in other media. For example, in the US, tobacco advertising was banned on radio and television in 1971, leaving billboards and magazines as some of the last places tobacco could be advertised. Billboards made the news in America when, in the tobacco settlement of 1999, all cigarette billboards were replaced with anti-smoking messages. In a parody of the Marlboro Man, some billboards depicted cowboys riding on ranches with slogans like &quot;Bob, I miss my lung.&quot;

Likely the best-known of the tobacco advertising boards were those for &quot;Mail Pouch&quot; chewing tobacco in the United States during the first half of the 20th century (pictured at left). The company agreed to paint two or three sides of a farmer&#x27;s barn any color he chose in exchange for painting their advertisement on one or two sides of the structure facing the road. The company has long since abandoned this form of advertising, and none of these advertisements have been painted in many years, but some remain visible on rural highways.

===Non-commercial use===
Not all billboards are used for advertising products and services—non-profit groups and government agencies use them to communicate with the public. In 1999 an anonymous person created the God Speaks billboard campaign in Florida &quot;to get people thinking about God&quot;, with witty statements signed by God. &quot;Don&#x27;t make me come down there&quot;, &quot;We need to talk&quot; and &quot;Tell the children that I love them&quot; were parts of the campaign, which was picked up by the Outdoor Advertising Association of America and continues today on billboards across the country.

South of Olympia, Washington is the privately owned Uncle Sam billboard. It features conservative, sometimes inflammatory messages, changed on a regular basis. Chehalis Farmer Al Hamilton first started the board during the Johnson era, when the government was trying to make him remove his billboards along Interstate 5. He had erected the signs after he lost a legal battle to prevent the building of the freeway across his land. Numerous legal and illegal attempts to remove the Uncle Sam billboard have failed, and it is now in its third location. One message, attacking a nearby liberal arts college, was photographed, made into a postcard, and sold in the College Bookstore.

==Governance==

The Traffic Audit Bureau for Media Measurement Inc. (TAB) was established in 1933 as a non-profit organization whose historical mission has been to audit the circulation of out-of-home media in the United States. TAB&#x27;s role has expanded to lead and support other major out-of-home industry research initiatives. Governed by a tripartite board composed of advertisers, agencies, and media companies, the TAB acts as an independent auditor for traffic circulation in accordance with guidelines established by its board of directors.

Similarly, in Canada, the Canadian Outdoor Measurement Bureau (COMB) was formed in 1965 as a non-profit organization independently operated by representatives composed of advertisers, advertising agencies, and members of the Canadian out-of-home advertising industry. COMB is charged with the verification of traffic circulation for the benefit of the industry and its users.

==History==

Early billboards basically displayed groups of large posters on the sides of buildings, with limited but still appreciable commercial value. As eyeballs, roads and highways multiplied, the billboard business thrived.
* Late 15th century – Flyposting was practiced in Europe.
* 1796 – Alois Senefelder, working in Bavaria, introduced lithography, which allowed the mass production of posters.
* 1835 – Jared Bell was making 9 × 6 posters for the circus in the U.S.
* 1862 – Formation of the United Kingdom Billposting Association.
* 1867 – Earliest known billboard rentals
* 1871 – Fredrick Walker designed one of the first art posters.
* 1872 – International Bill Posters Association of North America (now known as the Outdoor Advertising Association of America) established as a billboard-lobbying group.
* 1889 – The world&#x27;s first 24-sheet billboard was displayed at the Paris Exposition and later at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The format was quickly adopted for various types of advertising, especially for circuses, traveling shows, and movies.
* Early 1900s – Poster-art schools were established in England, Austria, and Germany.
* 1908 – The Model T automobile was introduced in the U.S., increasing the number of people using highways and therefore the reach of roadside billboards.
* 1919 – Japanese candy company Glico introduced its building-spanning billboard, the Glico Man.
* 1925 – Burma-Shave made billboards lining the highways.
* 1936 – The Wall Drug billboards started to go up nationwide.
* 1960 – The mechanized Kani Doraku billboard was built in Dotonbori, Osaka.

* 1965 – The Highway Beautification Act was passed after much campaigning by Lady Bird Johnson.
* 1969 – The Public Health Cigarette Smoking Act banned cigarette ads in television and radio, moving that business into billboards.
* 1981 – The United States Supreme Court overturned a San Diego billboard ban, but left room open for other cities to ban commercial billboards.
* 1986 – Non-television advertising became restricted – non-television adverts could not show people smoking. This meant that Benson &amp; Hedges and Silk Cut, amongst other brands, advertised their cigarettes through increasingly indirect and obscure campaigns to a point where they became recognizable.
* 1998 – The four major U.S. tobacco companies signed the Tobacco Master Settlement Agreement, which eliminated billboard advertising of cigarettes in 52 states.
* 2007 – The industry adopted one-sheet plastic poster replacement for paper poster billboards and began the phase-out of PVC flexible vinyl, replacing it with eco-plastics such as polyethylene.
* 2010 – The first &quot;scented billboard&quot;, emitting odors similar to charcoal and black pepper to suggest a steak grilling, was erected in Mooresville, North Carolina by the Bloom grocery chain to promote the sale of beef.
* 2010 – Augmented billboards were introduced in the Transmediale Festival 2010 in Berlin using Artvertiser.

==Notable examples==
* Hollywood Sign
* The Citgo Sign, Kenmore Square, Boston
* Coca-Cola billboard in Kings Cross, Sydney, Australia
* Coca-Cola sign
* Monarch advertising sign
* Osborne bull figures in Spain
* Paddy Power Cleeve Hill Sign
* Piccadilly Circus illuminated signs
* Valdivieso advertising sign

<doc id="246416" wikidata="Q1955040" url="?curid=246416" title="Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo">
<text>Congolese music is one of the most influential music forms of the African continent. Since the 1930s, Congolese musicians have had a huge impact on the African musical scene and elsewhere. Many contemporary genres of music, such as Kenyan Benga and Colombian Champeta, have been heavily influenced by Congolese music. In 2021, Congolese rumba joined other living traditions such as Jamaican reggae music and Cuban rumba on UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;intangible cultural heritage of humanity&quot; list.

Music of the Democratic Republic of the Congo varies in its different forms. Outside Africa, most music from the Democratic Republic of Congo is called &quot;Soukous&quot;, which most accurately refers instead to a dance popular in the late 1960s. The term &quot;rumba&quot; or &quot;rock-rumba&quot; is also used generically to refer to Congolese music, though neither is precise nor accurately descriptive.

People from the Congo have no single term for their own music per se, although &quot;muziki na biso&quot; (&quot;our music&quot;) was used until the late 1970s, and now the most common name is &quot;ndule&quot;, which simply means music in the Lingala language; most songs from the Democratic Republic of the Congo are sung in Lingala.

==History==
===Colonial times (pre-1960)===
Since the colonial era, Kinshasa, Congo&#x27;s capital, has been one of the great centers of musical innovation. The country, however, was carved out from territories controlled by many different ethnic groups, many of which had little in common with each other. Each maintained (and continue to do so) their own folk music traditions, and there was little in the way of a pan-Congolese musical identity until the 1940s.

Like much of Africa, Congo was dominated during the World War II-era by rumba. Congolese musicians appropriated rumba and adapted its characteristics for their instruments and tastes. In the 1950s, record labels began appearing, including CEFA, Ngoma, Loningisa and Opika, each issuing many 78 rpm records; Radio Congo Belge also began broadcasting during this period. Bill Alexandre, a Belgian working for CEFA, brought electric guitars to the Congo.

Popular early musicians include Camille Feruzi, who is said to have popularized rumba during the 1930s and guitarists like Zachery Elenga, Antoine Wendo Kolosoy and, most influentially, Jean Bosco Mwenda. Alongside rumba, other imported genres like American swing, French cabaret and Ghanaian highlife were also popular.

In 1953, the Congolese music scene began to differentiate itself with the formation of African Jazz (led by Joseph &quot;Le Grand Kallé&quot; Kabasele), the first full-time orchestra to record and perform, and the debut of fifteen-year-old guitarist François Luambo Makiadi (aka Franco). Both would go on to be some of the earliest Congolese music stars. African Jazz, which included Kabasele, sometimes called the father of modern Congolese music, as well as legendary Cameroonian saxophonist and keyboardist Manu Dibango, has become one of the most well-known groups in Africa, largely due to 1960&#x27;s &quot;Indépendance Cha Cha&quot;, which celebrated Congo&#x27;s independence and became an anthem for similar movements across the continent.

===Big bands (c. 1950–70)===
Into the 1950s, Kinshasa and Brazzaville became culturally linked, and many musicians moved back and forth between them, most importantly Nino Malapet and one of the founders of OK Jazz, Jean Serge Essous. Recording technology had evolved to allow for longer playing times, and the musicians focused on the seben, an instrumental percussion break with a swift tempo that was common in rumba. Both OK Jazz and African Jazz continued performing throughout the decade until African Jazz broke up in the mid-1960s, TPOK Jazz with Franco Luambo Makiadi at the helm dominated soukous music for the next 20 years.

Tabu Ley Rochereau and Dr. Nico then formed African Fiesta, which incorporated new innovations from throughout Africa as well as American and British soul, rock and country. African Fiesta, however, lasted only two years before disintegrating, and Tabu Ley formed Orchestre Afrisa International instead, but this new group was not able to rival OK Jazz in influence for very long.

Many of the most influential musicians of Congo&#x27;s history emerged from one or more of these big bands, including the colossus Franco Luambo Makiadi usually referred to simply as &quot;Franco&quot;, Sam Mangwana, Ndombe Opetum, Vicky Longomba, Dizzy Madjeku and Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta. Mangwana was the most popular of these solo performers, keeping a loyal fanbase even while switching from Vox Africa and Festival des Marquisards to Afrisa, followed by OK Jazz and a return to Africa before setting up a West African group called the African All Stars. Mose Fan Fan of OK Jazz also proved influential, bringing Congolese rumba to East Africa, especially Kenya, after moving there in 1974 with Somo Somo. Rumba also spread through the rest of Africa, with Brazzaville&#x27;s Pamelo Mounk&#x27;a and Tchico Thicaya moving to Abidjan and Ryco Jazz taking the Congolese sound to the French Antilles.

In Congo, students at Gombe High School became entranced with American rock and funk, especially after James Brown visited Zambia in 1970 and Kinshasa in 1974. Los Nickelos and Thu Zahina emerged from Gombe High, with the former moving to Brussels and the latter, though existing only briefly, becoming legendary for their energetic stage shows that included frenetic, funky drums during the seben and an often psychedelic sound. This period in the late 60s is the soukous era, though the term &quot;soukous&quot; now has a much broader meaning, and refers to all of the subsequent developments in Congolese music as well.

===Zaiko and post Zaiko (c. 1970–90)===

Stukas and Zaiko Langa Langa were the two most influential bands to emerge from this era, with Zaiko Langa Langa being an important starting ground for musicians like Pepe Feli, Bozi Boziana, Evoloko Jocker and Papa Wemba. A smoother, mellower pop sound developed in the early 1970s, led by Bella Bella, Shama Shama and Lipua Lipua, while Verckys Kiamuangana Mateta promoted a rougher garage-like sound that launched the careers of Pepe Kalle and Kanda Bongo Man, among others.

By the beginning of the 1990s, many of the most popular musicians of the classic era had lost their edge or died, and President Mobutu&#x27;s regime continued to repress indigenous music, reinforcing Paris&#x27; status as a 
center for Congolese music. Pepe Kalle, Kanda Bongo Man and Rigo Starr were all Paris-based and were among the most popular Congolese musicians. New styles genres like madiaba and Tshala Mwana&#x27;s mutuashi achieved some popularity. Kinshasa still had popular 
musicians, however, including Bimi Ombale and Dindo Yogo.

In 1993, many of the biggest individuals and bands in Congo&#x27;s history were brought together for an event that helped to revitalize Congolese music, and also jumpstarted the careers of popular bands like Swede Swede. Another notable feature in Congo culture is its sui generis music. The DRC has blended its ethnic musical sources with rumba and merengue to give birth to Soukous.

Influential figures of Soukous and its offshoots (N&#x27;dombolo, Rumba Rock) are Franco Luambo, Tabu Ley, Simaro Lutumba, Papa Wemba, Koffi Olomide, Kanda Bongo Man, Ray Lema, Mpongo Love, Abeti Masikini, Reddy Amisi, Pepe Kalle, and Nyoka Longo. One of the most talented and respected pioneers of African rhumba - Tabu Ley Pascal Rochereau.

Congolese modern music is also influenced in part by its politics. Zaire, then in 1965, Mobutu Sese Seko took over, and despite massive corruption, desperate economic failure, and the attempted military uprising of 1991, he held on until the eve of his death in 1997, when the president, Laurent Kabila. Kabila inherited a nearly ungovernable shell of a nation. He renamed it the Democratic Republic of the Congo.

Kabila could not erase the ruinous effects of the Belgian and Mobutu legacies, and the country is now in a state of chronic civil war. Mobutu instilled a deep fear of dissent and failed to develop his country&#x27;s vast resources. But the walls he built around his people and his attempts to boost cultural and national pride certainly contributed to the environment that bred Africa&#x27;s most influential pop music. Call it soukous, rumba, Zairois, Congo music, or kwassa-kwassa, the pop sound emanating from Congo&#x27;s capital, Kinshasa has shaped modern African culture more profoundly than any other.

Africa produces music genres that are direct derivatives of Congolese Soukous. Some of the African bands sing in Lingala, the main language in the DRC. The same Congolese Soukous, under the guidance of &quot;le sapeur&quot; Papa Wemba, set the tone for a generation of young guys who dress in expensive designer clothing. The numerous singers and instrumentalists who passed through Zaiko Langa Langa went on to rule Kinshasa&#x27;s bustling music scene in the &#x27;80s with such bands as Choc Stars and Papa Wemba&#x27;s Viva la Musica.

One erstwhile member of Viva la Musica, Koffi Olomidé, has been indisputably the biggest Zairean/Congolese star since the early &#x27;90s. His chief rivals are two veterans of the band Wenge Musica, J.B. Mpiana and Werrason. Mpiana and Werrason each claims to be the originator of ndombolo, a style that intersperses shouts with bursts of vocal melody and harmony over a frenetic din of electric guitars, synthesizers and drums. So pervasive is this style today that even Koffi Olomidé&#x27;s current repertory is mostly ndombolo.

<text>The Vancouver Ravens were the original Vancouver National Lacrosse League (NLL) franchise from 2002 to 2004. The team played their home games at General Motors Place, now Rogers Arena, in Vancouver, British Columbia, Canada. At the conclusion of their three-year lease at GM Place, they were unable to secure an extension with GM Place nor able to negotiate with Pacific Coliseum. Combined with a lack of attendance due to unstable ownership, on December 14, 2004, the NLL announced that the Ravens would cease operations and not be playing in the 2005 NLL season.

On June 18, 2007, a bid was submitted to the NLL for the return of the Vancouver Ravens for the 2008 season. The bid that was submitted to the NLL was approved on the condition that an arena lease is obtained and 2,500 season tickets are sold.

On July 16, 2007, there was confirmation that the Vancouver Ravens could play in the 2008 season at GM Place. On July 19, 2007, contrary to earlier reports, the NLL announced that the Vancouver Ravens would not play in the 2008 season.

On August 26, 2008, retired Olympic Boxer and bronze medallist Dale Walters, along with Jeff Hughes, applied to return professional lacrosse back to Vancouver through the purchase and relocation of the Portland Lumberjax.

Since the folding of the Ravens franchise, the National Lacrosse League has returned to British Columbia in the form of the Vancouver Warriors, who play out of Rogers Arena in Vancouver. The franchise was formerly named the Washington Stealth and played in Everett, Washington, before relocating to Langley, BC in 2013, and then to Vancouver in 2018.

<doc id="246421" wikidata="Q10334892" url="?curid=246421" title="Music of Cameroon">
<text>The music of the Cameroon includes diverse traditional and modern musical genres. The best-known contemporary genre is makossa, a popular style that has gained fans across Africa, and its related dance craze bikutsi.

The pirogue sailors of Douala are known for a kind of singing called &quot;Ngoso&quot; which has evolved into a kind of modern music accompanied by zanza, balafon, and various percussion instruments.

==Traditional music==


The ethnicities of Cameroon include an estimated 250 distinct ethnic groups in five regional-cultural divisions. An estimated 38% of the population are Western highlanders–Semi-Bantu or grassfielders including the Bamileke, Bamum, and many smaller Tikar groups in the northwest. 12% are coastal tropical forest peoples, including the Bassa, Duala, and many smaller groups in the southwest. The southern tropical forest peoples (18%) include the Beti-Pahuin and their sub-groups the Bulu and Fang, the Maka and Njem, as well as, the Baka pygmies. In the semi-arid northern regions (the Sahel) and central highlands the Fulani ( or ; ) form an estimated 14% of Cameroonians, while the Kirdi (unbelievers) are a general category, comprising 18% of the population, of various mainly Chadic and Adamawa speakers.

===Beti===
The Beti, or Ewondo, live in the area around Yaoundé and south into Equatorial Guinea. They are best known for bikutsi music, which has been popularized and become a rival for the more urban and accessible makossa of Douala. The name can be loosely translated as &quot;beating the ground continuously&quot;. Bikutsi, characterized by an intense 6/8 rhythm, is played at Beti gatherings including parties, funerals, and weddings.

Beti gatherings fall into two major categories:
*&quot;Ekang phase&quot;: the time when imaginary, mythological, and spiritual issues are discussed
*&quot;Bikutsi phase&quot;: when real-life issues are discussed

A double-sided harp with calabash amplification called the mvet is used during these ceremonies by Beti storytellers, who are viewed as using the mvet as an instrument of God to educate the people. The Ekang phase is intensely musical and usually lasts all night. There are poetic recitations accompanied by clapping and dancing, with interludes for improvised and sometimes obscene performances on the balafon (a type of xylophone). These interludes signal the shift to the bikutsi phase which is much less strictly structured than Ekang. During bikutsi, women dance and sing along with the balafon, and lyrics focus on real-life problems, as well as sexual fantasies.

These female choruses are an integral part of bikutsi, and their intense dancing and screams are characteristic of the genre. Another type of ceremony is the mevungu, when women dance all night to abstain from sex during those hours for a period of nine days. The sso ritual is much-feared by Beti boys as it involves a series of tests to mark a boy&#x27;s passage into manhood.

==Modern popular music==
The earliest recorded popular music from Cameroon comes from the 1930s, when the most popular styles were imported pop music and French-style chanson. In Douala, the most developed city in Cameroon, accordions and ambasse bey music were common, with performers like Lobe Lobe, Ebanda Manfred, and Nelle Eyoum finding a local audience. Ekambi Brillant and the first major Cameroonian hit, &quot;N&#x27;Gon Abo,&quot; set the stage for the development of makossa. Post-independence in 1960, a local variant on palm wine music called assiko, was popular especially Jean Bikoko and Dikoume Bernard.

The urbanization of Cameroon has had a major influence on the country&#x27;s music. Migration to the city of Yaoundé, for example, was a major cause for the popularization of bikutsi music. During the 1950s, bars sprang up across the city to accommodate the influx of new inhabitants and soon became a symbol for Cameroonian identity in the face of colonialism. Balafon orchestras, consisting of 3-5 balafons and various percussion instruments (including the balafon, which is both a harmonic and percussive instrument) became common in the bars. Some of these orchestras, such as Richard Band de Zoetele, became quite popular in spite of scorn from the European elite.

===1950s and 60s===

The middle of the 20th century saw the popularization of a native folk music called bikutsi. Bikutsi is based on a war rhythm played with various rattles and drums and xylophone. Sung by women, bikutsi featured sexually explicit lyrics and songs about everyday problems. In a popularized form, bikutsi gained mainstream success in the 1950s. Anne-Marie Nzié was perhaps the most important of the early innovators. The next bikutsi performer of legendary stature was Messi Me Nkonda Martin and his band, Los Camaroes, who added electric guitars and other new elements.

Balafon orchestras had remained popular throughout the 1950s in Yaoundé&#x27;s bar scene, but the audience demanded modernity, and the popular style at the time was unable to cope. Messi Martin was a Cameroonian guitarist who had been inspired to learn the instrument by listening to Spanish language-broadcasts from neighboring Equatorial Guinea, as well as Cuban, and Zairean rumba. Messi changed the electric guitar by linking the strings together with pieces of paper, thus giving the instrument a damper tone which emitted a &quot;thudding&quot; sound similar to the balafon.

Messi&#x27;s style was immediately popular, and his hits, like &quot;Mengalla Maurice&quot; and &quot;Bekono Nga N&#x27;Konda,&quot; became radio favorites throughout the country beginning in the early 1960s. Further innovations followed, as Messi replaced the handclaps and sanza with a synthesizer and the foot-stamping 6/8 rhythm to drums.

===1970s===

Later in the 1960s, modern makossa developed and became the most popular genre in Cameroon. Makossa is a type of funky dance music, best known outside Africa for Manu Dibango, whose 1972 single &quot;Soul Makossa&quot; was an international hit. Outside of Africa, Dibango and makossa were only briefly popular, but the genre has produced several pan-African superstars through the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. Following Dibango, a wave of musicians electrified makossa in an attempt at making it more accessible outside of Cameroon. Another pop singer in 1970s Cameroon was André-Marie Tala, a blind singer who had a pair of hits with &quot;Sikati&quot; and &quot;Potaksima.&quot;

By the 1970s, bikutsi performers like Maurice Elanga, Les Veterans, and Mbarga Soukous, added brass instruments and found controversy over pornographic lyrics. Mama Ohandja also brought bikutsi to new audiences, especially in Europe. The following decade, however, saw Les Tetes Brulées surpass previous artists in international popularity though their reaction at home was mixed. Many listeners did not like their mellow, almost easy listening-styled bikutsi. Cameroonian audiences preferred more roots-based performers like Jimmy Mvondo Mvelé and Uta Bella, both from Yaoundé.

===1980s===
By the 1980s, makossa had moved to Paris and a new pop-makossa fused elements of Antillean zouk. Prominent musicians from this period included Moni Bilé, Douleur, Bébé Manga, , Petit-Pays, and Esa.

The 1980s also saw rapid development of Cameroon&#x27;s media which saw a flourishing of both makossa and bikutsi. In 1980, L&#x27;Equipe Nationale de Makossa was formed, joining the biggest makossa stars of the period together, including, Grace Decca, Ndedi Eyango, Ben Decca, Guy Lobe, and Dina Bell. Makossa in the 1980s saw a wave of mainstream success across Africa and, to a lesser degree, abroad as Latin influences, Martinican zouk, and pop music changed its form. While makossa enjoyed international renown, bikutsi was often denigrated as the music of savages, and it did not appeal across ethnic lines and into urban areas. Musicians continued to add innovations, however, and improved recording techniques; Nkondo Si Tony, for example, added keyboards and synthesizers while Elanga Maurice added brass instruments. Les Veterans emerged as the most famous bikutsi group in the 1980s while other prominent performers included Titans de Sangmelima, Seba Georges, Ange Ebogo Emerent, Otheo and Mekongo President, who added complex harmonies and jazz influences.

In 1984, a new wave of bikutsi artists emerged, including Sala Bekono formerly of Los Camaroes, Atebass, a bassist, and Zanzibar, a guitarist who would eventually help form Les Têtes Brulées with Jean-Marie Ahanda. 1985 saw the formation of CRTV, a television network that did much to help popularize Cameroonian popular music across the country.

Jean-Marie Ahanda became the most influential bikutsi performer of the late 1980s, and he revolutionized the genre in 1987 after forming Les Têtes Brulées, whose success changed the Cameroonian music industry. The band played an extremely popular form of bikutsi that allowed for greater depth and diversity. Guitarist Zanzibar added foam rubber to the bridge of his guitar, which made the instrument sound more like a balafon than before, and was more aggressive and innovative than previous musicians. Les Têtes Brulées emerged as a reaction against pop-makossa, which was seen as abandoning its roots in favor of mainstream success. The band&#x27;s image was part of its success, and they became known for their shaved heads and multi-colored body painting, done to represent traditional Beti scarification, as well as torn T-shirts that implied a common folkness in contrast to the well-styled pop-makossa performers of the period. They also wore backpacks on stage, a reference to Beti women&#x27;s traditional method of carrying babies while they danced bikutsi.

It took only a few weeks for Les Têtes Brulées to knock makossa off the Cameroonian charts, and the band even toured France. While in France, Les Têtes Brulées recorded their first LP, &quot;Hot Heads&quot;, which was also the first bikutsi music recorded for the CD. &quot;Hot Heads&quot; expanded the lyrical format of the genre to include socio-political issues. Tours of Japan, Africa, Europe, and the United States followed, as well as Claire Denis&#x27; film &quot;Man No Run&quot;, which used footage from their European tour.

===1990s===

In the 1990s, both makossa and bikutsi declined in popularity as a new wave of genres entered mainstream audiences. These included Congolese-influenced new rumba and makossa-soukous, as well as more native forms like bantowbol, northern Cameroonian nganja (which had gained some popularity in the United Kingdom in the mid-1980s), and an urban street music called bend-skin.

Les Têtes Brulées remained the country&#x27;s most well known musical export, especially after accompanying the Cameroonian soccer team to the World Cup in 1990 in Italy and 1994 in the United States. A new wave of bikutsi artists arose in the early 1990s, including Les Martiens (formed by Les Têtes Brulées bassist Atebass) and the sexually themed roots-singer Katino Ateba (&quot;Ascenseur: le secret de l&#x27;homme&quot;) and Douala singer Sissi Dipoko (&quot;Bikut-si Hit&quot;) as well as a resurgence of old performers like Sala Bekono. Bikutsi&#x27;s international renown continued to grow, and the song &quot;Proof&quot; from Paul Simon&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, released to mainstream promotion and success in 1990, gained yet more renown from international audiences. Vincent Nguini also contributed guitar arrangements and performance to Simon&#x27;s &quot;Rhythm of the Saints&quot;, which became an influential world music album, introducing many North American listeners to the wide range of instrumentation and genres.

In 1993, the Pedalé movement was born as a reaction to the Cameroonian economic slump. Youthful artists like Gibraltar Drakuss, Zele le Bombardier, Eboue Chaleur, Pasto, Roger Bekono, Mbarga Soukous, and Saint-Desiré Atango was a return to the aggressive, earthy sound of bikutsi roots. Meanwhile, Henri Dikongué, whose music incorporated, amongst others, bikutsi and makossa, began to release albums which met international success. He went on to tour Europe and North America. The most recent form of Cameroonian popular music is a fusion of Congolese soukous and makossa, a scene which has produced Petit Pays, Marcel Bwanga, Kotto Bass, Papillon and Jean Pierre Essome. Other popular genres include Bend-skin, mangambeu, and makassi.

<doc id="246425" wikidata="Q2294872" url="?curid=246425" title="Music of Mozambique">
<text>The native folk music of [[Mozambique]] has been highly influenced by Portuguese colonisation and local language forms. The most popular style of modern dance music is marrabenta. Mozambican music also influenced another Lusophone music in Brazil, like maxixe (its name derived from Maxixe in Mozambique), and mozambique style in Cuba and New York City.

Culture was an integral part of the struggle for independence, which began in 1964. Leaders of the independence movement used cultural solidarity to gain support from the common people, while the Portuguese colonialists promoted their own culture. By the time independence came in 1975, Mozambican bands had abandoned their previous attempts at European-style music, and began forging new forms based out of local folk styles and the new African popular music coming from Zaire, Zimbabwe, Tanzania, Zambia and South Africa.

In 1978, the Ministry of Education and Culture organized a National Dance Festival that involved more than half a million people, and led to the creation of numerous organizations and festivals promoting Mozambican music.

==Timbila==

The Chopi people of the coastal Inhambane Province are known for a unique kind of xylophone called the &quot;mbila&quot; (pl: &quot;timbila&quot;) and the style of music played with it, which &quot;is believed to be the most sophisticated method of composition yet found among preliterate peoples.&quot; Ensembles consist of around ten xylophones of four sizes and accompany ceremonial dances with long compositions called &quot;ngomi&quot; which consist of an overture and ten movements of different tempos and styles. The ensemble leader serves as poet, composer, conductor, and performer, creating a text, improvising a melody partially based on the features of the Chopi&#x27;s tone language, and composing a second countrapunctal line. The musicians of the ensemble partially improvise their parts according to style, instrumental idiom, and the leader&#x27;s indications. The composer then consults with the choreographer of the ceremony and adjustments are made. (Nettl 1956, p. 18-19)

==Marrabenta==

Marrabenta is the best-known form of music from Mozambique. It is urban in origin, and meant for dancing. Marrabenta was born as a fusion of imported European music played on improvised materials. The word &quot;marrabenta&quot; derives from the Portuguese &quot;rebentar&quot; (&quot;arrabentar&quot; in the local vernacular), meaning &quot;to break&quot;, a reference to cheap guitar strings that snapped quickly. Instruments were fashioned out of tin cans and pieces of wood. Lyrics were usually in local languages, and included songs of social criticism as well as love. Additionally, there are songs whose lyrics are in Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, for nationwide and international promotion of the songs to other CPLP nations. The late 1970s saw tremendous innovation in marrabenta, as 1001 Music Productions recorded artists and staged large concerts. The compilation album &quot;Amanhecer&quot; was released, followed by more such LPs under the title &quot;Ngoma&quot;.

The most influential early marrabenta performer was Fany Pfumo, whose fame began after the success of &quot;Loko ni kumbuka Jorgina&quot;. He recorded in South Africa on HMV and later incorporated South African kwela into his music. The group Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Moçambique formed in 1979, led by long-time performer Wazimbo. The group toured Europe and other parts of the world, and soon brought international recognition to marrabenta.

Many of the most popular musicians in modern Mozambique spent time with Orchestra Marrabenta Star de Moçambique, including Stewart Sukuma, Chico António, Mr. Bow, Neyma, José Mucavel and Mingas, while other popular bands include Ghorwane.

==Pandza==

Pandza is the newest and most-popular style of Mozambican music, its invention credited to N&#x27;Star, Ziqo and Dj Ardiles in Maputo. Pandza is especially popular amongst Mozambican youths and is a mix of marrabenta and ragga. The roots of Pandza originate from marrabenta but pandza has a faster tempo with major influences from ragga and some hip hop. Most pandza is sung in Portuguese and the Shangana language from Maputo and its lyrics most of the time, elaborate the daily lifestyles of young Mozambicans. The most notable pandza singers in Mozambique today include, Lizha James, Ziqo, Dj Ardiles, N&#x27;star, DH, Mr. Kuka, MC Roger, Denny Og, Dj Junior, Cízer Boss and Helio Beatz.

==Hip hop==
Mozambican hip hop is developing bit by bit and it is receiving a positive response. In the first decade of the 21st century, people who were uplifting hip hop were H2O, G-Pro and Danny OG. Modern hip hop artists include Bander Artista, Kins Ferna&#x27;s, Dygo Boy Jurus, Ziqo, Same Blood and Laylizzy. Azagaia, a Maputo-based rapper who was critical of the Mozambican government, was described as &quot;the most influential rapper in Mozambique&quot;; with marches taking place across the country in his honour following his death in 2023.

<doc id="246427" wikidata="Q641641" url="?curid=246427" title="Rochester Knighthawks (1995–2019)">
<text>The Rochester Knighthawks (also known as the K-Hawks) were a professional box lacrosse team in the National Lacrosse League. They played in Rochester, New York at the Blue Cross Arena at the War Memorial. The Knighthawks were previously members of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League from 1995 to 1997. They were members of the NLL since the league&#x27;s inaugural 1998 season.

The Knighthawks reached the playoffs in each of their first 13 seasons, from 1995 to 2007. This is a league record going back to the league&#x27;s original creation, the Eagle Pro Box Lacrosse League. The previous record was 11 straight years, held by the Philadelphia Wings. They were also the first NLL team to win three consecutive championships (2012–14).

The new Knighthawks are owned by Pegula Sports and Entertainment who purchased the intellectual property of the team from former owner Curt Styres who moved the previous version of the team to Halifax, Nova Scotia as the Halifax Thunderbirds at the end of the 2018–2019 season. As an expansion team they are not a continuation of the previous Knighthawks. All records and championships were transferred to Halifax.

== History ==
The Rochester Knighthawks found success throughout their history despite playing in a small market.

In their inaugural season they finished 3rd during the regular season and dispatched the Boston Blazers in the playoff semifinals to get to the finals as an expansion team. As they would do three times later on, they found themselves coming up just short in the championship game, falling in overtime to the Philadelphia Wings.

Just two seasons later, the Knighthawks would find their way to the top of the MILL heap, claiming the final North American Cup before the merger with the National Lacrosse League prior to the 1998 season. It would be ten years before the Knighthawks claimed their second title. They beat the Arizona Sting in the 2007 Championship by a score of 13–11. In 2012, the Knighthawks defeated the Edmonton Rush for the Championship by a score of 9–6. In 2013, the Knighthawks became the first team in the league to clinch back-to-back championship titles since the Toronto Rock in 2002 and 2003 by defeating the Washington Stealth 11–10. In 2014, the Knighthawks set a new league record by winning their third straight championship title.

=== 2007 season ===
After starting the season with a record of 2-2, the Knighthawks beat the Toronto Rock 19–15 in Toronto, where they had only won twice before in team history. The Knighthawks followed this victory up with 11 more, finishing the season with a franchise-record 12 regular-season-game winning streak and a 14–2 record. The Knighthawks were a perfect 8–0 at home, becoming the first team since the 2003 Bandits to post a perfect record at home. The winning streak was extended to 13 games after they defeated the Rock 10–6 in the division semi-finals; and to 14 after beating the Bandits in overtime, 14–13, for the East Division title. After the season, head coach Ed Comeau was named the 2007 Les Bartley Award winner.

Despite having the best overall record, they could not host the championship game due to a scheduling conflict with the Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus at the Blue Cross Arena. Playing the game instead in Arizona, the Knighthawks defeated the Arizona Sting 13–11 on May 12, 2007, to win their first NLL championship. John Grant, Jr., regular-season league MVP, was named MVP of the game.

The winning streak continued during the 2008 season, as the Knighthawks defeated the Buffalo Bandits in the opening game on January 11, 2008. However, the next night in Rochester, the streak was halted at 16 games as they were defeated by the Bandits 14–9.

=== Lease issue ===
During the 2007 season, a dispute over concession revenues between owner Steve Donner and the Sports Management Group, then operators of the Blue Cross Arena, jeopardized the continued play of the Knighthawks in Rochester. Donner claimed that the Knighthawks and the Rochester Americans of the American Hockey League had lost over $500,000 the previous two seasons, and without concession revenue sharing, he would be unable to continue to operate the teams in Rochester. An agreement was reached between the Amerks/Knighthawks SMG, and the City of Rochester on a one-year lease extension on May 11, 2007, that would allow for long-term negotiations to continue through both teams&#x27; 2008 season. Under the extension, the Amerks/Knighthawks agreed to an independent audit of their finances and the city agreed to forgo additional luxury suite revenue from the arena and to loan the Amerks an additional $100,000, added on to a $500,000 loan that is now past-due. On June 16, 2008, the Knighthawks and Americans announced a new five-year lease with the Blue Cross Arena.

=== Curt Styres era ===
On May 28, 2008, the National Lacrosse League&#x27;s Board of Governors approved the sale of a majority stake of the Knighthawks to the President of Arrow Express Sports Curt Styres at a price of $5,575,000, the highest price paid for a team in league history. The league&#x27;s approval was conditional upon whether or not the Knighthawks and Sports Management Group could secure a new lease for play at the Blue Cross Arena. Styres had also recently been approved by the American Hockey League to purchase the Americans. On June 16, 2008, the Knighthawks and Americans announced a new five-year lease with the Blue Cross Arena.

In June 2011, the Americans and Knighthawks were split up when Terrence Pegula purchased the Americans. The split was necessary at the time due to Pegula owning the Buffalo Bandits. This is a rule that would later be changed.

==Original team relocation and replacement==

On September 13, 2018, Styres announced that he would be accepting a new team in Halifax, Nova Scotia and would be relocating the Knighthawks to the city for the winter 2019–2020 season. The Knighthawks intellectual property was sold to Terry and Kim Pegula (the latter of whom was raised in the Rochester suburbs) along with an expansion franchise to ensure Rochester&#x27;s uninterrupted presence in the league. The original name was used, but the color scheme and logo changed. The team logo, colors, and other officials were announced on May 29, 2019, in an event at Blue Cross Arena. The new franchise does not count as a continuation of the previous franchise. All championships and records were transferred to Halifax.

<text>The Beothuk ( or ; also spelled Beothuck) were a group of Indigenous people of Canada who lived on the island of Newfoundland.

The Beothuk culture formed around 1500 CE. This may have been the most recent cultural manifestation of peoples who first migrated from Labrador to present-day Newfoundland around 1 CE. The ancestors of this group had three earlier cultural phases, each lasting approximately 500 years.

== Description ==
The Beothuk lived throughout the island of Newfoundland, mostly in the Notre Dame and Bonavista Bay areas. Estimates of the Beothuk population at the time of contact with Europeans vary. Historian of the Beothuk Ingeborg Marshall argued that European historical records of Beothuk history are clouded by ethnocentrism and unreliable. Scholars from the 19th and early 20th century estimated about 2,000 Beothuk individuals lived at the time of European contact in the 15th century; however, there may have been no more than 500 to 700 people. Based on the carrying capacity of the ecosystem at the time of contact the population is estimated to have been between 1,000 and 1,500. They lived in independent, self-sufficient, extended family groups of 30 to 55 people.

Like many other hunter-gatherers, they appear to have had band leaders but probably not more formal chiefs, in the anthropological definition of the word. They lived in conical dwellings known as &quot;mamateeks&quot;, which were fortified for the winter season. These were constructed by arranging poles in a circle, tying them at the top, and covering them with birch bark. The floors were dug with hollows used for sleeping. A fireplace was made at the centre.

During spring, the Beothuk used red ochre to paint not only their bodies but also their houses, canoes, weapons, household appliances, and musical instruments. This practice led Europeans to refer to them as &quot;Red Indians&quot;. The use of ochre had great cultural significance. The decorating was done during an annual multi-day spring celebration. It designated tribal identity; for example, decorating newborn children was a way to welcome them into the tribe. Forbidding a person to wear ochre was a form of punishment.

Their main food were caribou, salmon, and seals, augmented by harvesting other animal and plant species. The Beothuk followed the seasonal migratory habits of their principal quarry. In the fall, they set up deer fences, sometimes long, used to drive migrating caribou toward waiting hunters armed with bows and arrows.

The Beothuk are also known to have made a pudding out of tree sap and the dried yolk of the eggs of the great auk. They preserved surplus food for use during winter, trapped various fur-bearing animals, and worked their skins for warm clothing. The fur side was worn next to the skin, to trap air against a person&#x27;s body.

Beothuk canoes were made of caribou or seal skin, and the bows of canoes were stiffened with spruce bark. Canoes resembled kayaks and were said to be in length and in width with enough room to carry children, dogs, and property.

The Beothuk followed elaborate burial practices. After wrapping the bodies in birch bark, they buried the dead in isolated locations. In one form, a shallow grave was covered with a rock pile. At other times they laid the body on a scaffold, or placed it in a burial box, with the knees folded. The survivors placed offerings at burial sites to accompany the dead, such as figurines, pendants, and replicas of tools.

About 1000 CE, Norse explorers led by Leif Erikson encountered Indigenous people in northern Newfoundland, who may have been ancestors of the later Beothuk, or Dorset inhabitants of Labrador and Newfoundland. The Norse called them &quot;skrælingjar&quot; (&quot;skraelings&quot;). Beginning in 1497, with the arrival of the Italian explorer John Cabot, sailing under the auspices of King Henry VII, waves of European explorers and settlers had more contacts.

Unlike some other Indigenous groups, the Beothuk tried to avoid contact with Europeans; they moved inland as European settlements grew. The Beothuk visited their former camps only to pick up metal objects. They would also collect any tools, shelters, and building materials left by the European fishermen who had dried and cured their catch before taking it to Europe at the end of the season. Contact between Europeans and the Beothuk was usually negative for one side, with a few exceptions like John Guy&#x27;s party in 1612. Settlers and the Beothuk competed for natural resources, such as salmon, seals, and birds. In the interior, fur trappers established traplines, disrupted the caribou hunts, and ransacked Beothuk stores, camps, and supplies. The Beothuk would steal traps to reuse the metals, and steal from the homes and shelters of European settlers and sometimes ambush them. These encounters led to enmity and mutual violence. With superior arms technology, the settlers generally had the upper hand in hunting and warfare. (Unlike other Native American peoples, the Beothuk appeared to have had no interest in adopting firearms.)

Intermittently, Europeans attempted to improve relations with the Beothuk. Examples included expeditions by naval lieutenants George Cartwright in 1768 and David Buchan in 1811. Cartwright&#x27;s expedition was commissioned by Governor Hugh Palliser; he found no Beothuk, but brought back important cultural information.

Governor John Duckworth commissioned Buchan&#x27;s expedition. Although undertaken for information gathering, this expedition ended in violence. Buchan&#x27;s party encountered several Beothuk near Beothuk Lake. After an initially friendly reception, Buchan left two of his men behind with the Beothuk. The next day, he found them murdered and mutilated. According to the Beothuk Shanawdithit&#x27;s later account, the marines were killed when one refused to give up his jacket and both ran away.

== Causes of starvation ==
The Beothuks avoided Europeans in Newfoundland by moving inland from their traditional settlements. First, they emigrated to different coastal areas of Newfoundland, places the Europeans did not have fish-camps, but they were over-run. Then, they emigrated to inland Newfoundland. The Beothuks&#x27; main food sources were caribou, fish, and seals; their forced displacement deprived them of two of these. This led to the over-hunting of caribou, leading to a decrease in the caribou population in Newfoundland. The Beothuks emigrated from their traditional land and lifestyle into ecosystems unable to support them, causing under-nourishment and, eventually, starvation.

== Extinction ==
Population estimates of Beothuks remaining at the end of the first decade of the 19th century vary widely, from about 150 up to 3,000. Information about the Beothuk was based on accounts by the woman Shanawdithit, who told about the people who &quot;wintered on the Exploits River or at Red Indian Lake and resorted to the coast in Notre Dame Bay&quot;. References in records also noted some survivors on the Northern Peninsula in the early 19th century.

During the colonial period, the Beothuk people allegedly endured territorial pressure from other Indigenous groups: Mi&#x27;kmaq migrants from Cape Breton Island, and Inuit from Labrador. &quot;The Beothuk were unable to procure sufficient subsistence within the areas left to them.&quot; It has been alleged that French bounties induced the Mi&#x27;kmaq to kill Beothuk. This is, however, disputed by most historians and has since come to be known as the &quot;Mercenary Myth&quot;.

Beothuk numbers dwindled rapidly due to a combination of factors, including:
* loss of access to important food sources, from the competition with and displacement by European settlers;
* infectious diseases to which they had no immunity, such as smallpox, introduced by European contact;
* endemic tuberculosis (TB), which weakened tribal members;
* violent encounters with trappers and settlers.

By 1829, with the death of Shanawdithit, the people were declared extinct.

=== Claims of Modern Survivors ===

Oral histories suggest a few Beothuk survived around the region of the Exploits River, Twillingate, Newfoundland and Labrador; and formed unions with European colonists, Inuit and Mi&#x27;kmaq. Some families from Twillingate claim descent from the Beothuk people of the early 19th century.

In 1910, a 75-year-old Indigenous woman named Santu Toney claimed she was the daughter of a Mi&#x27;kmaq mother and a Beothuk father. She recorded a song in the Beothuk language for the American anthropologist Frank Speck. He was conducting field studies in the area. She said her father taught her the song.

Since Santu Toney was born about 1835, this may be evidence some Beothuk people survived beyond the death of Shanawdithit in 1829. Contemporary researchers tried to transcribe the song, as well as improve the recording by current methods. Native groups learned the song to use in celebrations of tradition.

=== Claims of Genocide ===

Scholars disagree in their definition of &quot;genocide&quot; in relation to the Beothuk. While some scholars believe that the Beothuk died out as an unintended consequence of European colonization, others argue that Europeans conducted a sustained campaign of genocide against them. 

Writing in 1766, Governor Hugh Palliser reported to the British secretary of state that &quot;&quot;the barbarous system of killing prevails amongst our people towards the Native Indians — whom our People always kill, when they can meet them&quot;. 

If such a campaign did occur, it was explicitly without official sanction after 1769, any such action thereafter being in violation of Governor John Byron&#x27;s proclamation that &quot;I do strictly enjoin and require all His Majesty&#x27;s subjects to live in amity and brotherly kindness with the native savages&quot; [Beothuk] &quot;of the said island of Newfoundland&quot;&quot;, as well as the subsequent Proclamation issued by Governor John Holloway on July 30, 1807, which prohibited mistreatment of the Beothuk and offered a reward for any information on such mistreatment. 

Adhikari comments how the intentional nature of the destructive violence from colonizers is part of the evidence that makes this a case of genocide. Harring draws parallels between the genocidal violence inflicted upon the Beothuk and the genocidal violence inflicted upon the Aboriginal Tasmanians, and that the government&#x27;s knowledge of such violence while not actively preventing and stopping it implies a tacit approval of the violence.

Adhikari collects various accounts of mass violence conducted by Europeans against the Beothuk, the most infamous of which is a raid that occurred in winter 1789. This was led by John Peyton Sr., who was involved in many acts of violence against the Beothuk. Peyton along with two others fired upon a band of 50 Beothuk with buckshot, killing many while injuring all others, beyond some injured individuals who were physically beaten to death after being shot, any others were left to die from their injuries or freeze to death. 

== Notable Beothuk captives ==
Several Beothuk were captured by settlers from the Newfoundland Colony during the early 19th century.

=== Demasduit ===

Demasduit was a Beothuk woman, about 23 years old at the time she was captured by a party led by the fisherman John Peyton Sr. near Beothuk Lake in March 1819.

The governor of the Newfoundland Colony was seeking to encourage trade and end hostilities with the Beothuk. He approved an expedition, to be led by the Scottish explorer David Buchan, to recover a boat and other fishing gear foraged by the Beothuk. Buchan was accompanied by two soldiers; the Beothuk mistakenly thought Buchan had hostile intentions and killed and decapitated the soldiers accompanying him.

In 1819, an armed party led by Peyton Sr, totaling about nine men (including Peyton Jr.), came upon a Beothuk camp looking for stolen fishing gear. The Beothuk scattered, although Demasduit was unable to escape and begged for mercy, exposing her breasts to show she was a nursing mother with child. Her husband, Nonosabasut, confronted Peyton Sr. and his party, attempting to negotiate for the release of his wife. Peyton Sr. refused and a scuffle broke out between him and Nonosabasut, resulting in the death of the latter. Peyton Sr. and his party took Demasduit to Twillingate, with her baby dying before they reached the settlement.

The settlers at the Newfound Colony named Demasduit &quot;Mary March&quot; after the month she was taken. Government agents took her to St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland. The colonial government hoped to make Demasduit comfortable while she was living in the colony so she might be a bridge between them and the Beothuk. Demasduit learned some English, and taught the settlers about 200 words of the Beothuk language. In January 1820, Demasduit was released to rejoin her people, but she died of tuberculosis on the voyage to Notre Dame Bay.

=== Shanawdithit ===

Shanawdithit was Demasduit&#x27;s niece and the last known full-blooded Beothuk. In April 1823, she was in her early twenties. She, her mother, and sister sought food and help from a white trapper, as they were starving. The three were taken to St. John&#x27;s, but her mother and sister died of tuberculosis, an epidemic among the First Nations. Called &quot;Nancy April&quot; by the settlers, Shanawdithit lived for several years in the home of John Peyton Jr. as a servant.

The explorer William Cormack founded the Beothuk Institute in 1827 to foster friendly dealings with the Beothuk and support their culture. His expeditions found Beothuk artifacts but he also learned the society was dying out. Learning of Shanawdithit, in the winter 1828–1829, Cormack brought her to his centre so he could learn from her. He drew funds from his institute to pay for her support.

Shanawdithit made ten drawings for Cormack, some of which showed parts of the island, and others illustrated Beothuk implements and dwellings, along with Beothuk notions and myths. As she explained her drawings, she taught Cormack Beothuk vocabulary. She told him there were far fewer Beothuk than twenty years previously. To her knowledge, at the time she was taken, only a dozen Beothuk survived. Despite medical care from the doctor William Carson, Shanawdithit died of tuberculosis in St. John&#x27;s on June 6, 1829. At the time, there was no European cure for the disease.

== Archaeology ==

The area around eastern Notre Dame Bay, on the northeast coast of Newfoundland, contains numerous archeological sites containing material from Indigenous cultures. One of these is the Boyd&#x27;s Cove site. At the foot of a bay, it is protected by a maze of islands sheltering it from waves and winds. The site was found in 1981 during an archeological survey to locate Beothuk sites to study their artifacts for insight into Beothuk culture.

Records and information were limited, therefore some questions about the people could not be answered because few record-keeping Europeans contacted the Beothuk. By contrast, peoples such as the Huron or the Mi&#x27;kmaq interacted with the French missionaries, who studied and taught them and had extensive trade with French, Dutch, and English merchants - all of whom made records of their encounters.

There are references that document Beothuk presence in the region of Notre Dame Bay in the last half of the 18th and early part of the 19th century. Previous archaeological surveys and amateur finds indicate it was likely the Beothuk lived in the area prior to European encounter. Eastern Notre Dame Bay is rich in animal and fish life: seals, fish, and seabirds, and its hinterland supported large caribou herds.

Archaeologists found sixteen Indigenous sites, ranging in age from the Maritime Archaic era (7000 BC – modern) through the Palaeo-Eskimo period, down to the Recent Indigenous (including the Beothuk) occupation. Two of the sites are associated with the historical Beothuk. Boyd&#x27;s Cove, the larger of the two, is and is on top of a glacial moraine. The coarse sand, gravel, and boulders were left behind by glaciers.

The artifacts provide answers to an economic question: why did the Beothuk avoid Europeans? The interiors of four houses and their environs produced some 1,157 nails, the majority of which were forged by the Beothuk. The site&#x27;s occupants manufactured some sixty-seven projectile points (most made from nails and bones). They modified nails to use as what are believed to be scrapers to remove fat from animal hides, they straightened fish hooks and adapted them as awls, they fashioned lead into ornaments, and so on. In summary, the Boyd&#x27;s Cove Beothuk took debris from an early modern European fishery and fashioned materials.

=== Trends in findings across Beothuk archaeological sites ===
All Beothuk sites of note are in coastal areas, implying that prior to European settlement most Indigenous settlements were along the coast. This adds evidence to the claim that the Beothuk were cut off from their food sources which led to many of them starving to death as they were pushed inland. Many sites consist of the same elements because they are all former occupational sites. These sites show a variety of material culture based on what period they are from however most contain the remains of animals, remainders of permanent and semipermanent structures such as remains of fire pits and sleeping hollows. Several sites, such as Sampson&#x27;s Head Cove, had wooden and bone tools as well as stone arrowheads. There have also been instances of stone jewelry found at residential sites. Several people have claimed to have uncovered Beothuk burials; however, these are not substantiated by much evidence of this. Additionally, many cases of Beothuk remains may have been true at one point but because of mishandling the remains are now lost and unable to be verified. A prime example of this is a picture of what was said to be a mummified Beothuk child, which was lost by the Newfoundland Museum that it was held in due to the fact that the museum shared a building with a post office. In the early 1900s the child&#x27;s remains, as well as the remains of an adult Beothuk and a number of other Beothuk artifacts, were put in storage by the post office and then subsequently lost. Additionally all images of this were subsequently lost once again due to neglect leaving nothing but first hand accounts to even confirm the existence of the remains and artifacts, leaving them entirely to the public imagination. Other accounts confirm that this is fairly normal for Beothuk remains.

== Genetics ==
In 2007, DNA testing was conducted on material from the teeth of Demasduit and her husband Nonosabasut, two Beothuk individuals buried in the 1820s. The results assigned them to Haplogroup X (mtDNA) and Haplogroup C (mtDNA), respectively, which are also found in current Mi&#x27;kmaq populations in Newfoundland. DNA research indicates they were solely of First Nation Indigenous maternal ancestry, unlike some earlier studies suggesting an Indigenous/European hybrid. However, a 2011 analysis showed although the two Beothuk and living Mi&#x27;kmaq occur in the same haplogroups, SNP differences between Beothuk and Mi&#x27;kmaq individuals indicate they were dissimilar within those groups, and a &#x27;close-relationship&#x27; theory was not supported.

<text>The Buffalo Bandits are a professional box lacrosse team based in Buffalo, New York, that competes in the National Lacrosse League (NLL). The team plays its home games at KeyBank Center. The Bandits played in the Major Indoor Lacrosse League from 1992 to 1997, then in its successor the NLL since 1998 . The Bandits are one of the oldest franchises in the league, behind the Albany FireWolves (which were founded in 1987 as the original Philadelphia Wings (1987–2014) franchise) and the Colorado Mammoth (which were founded in 1987 as the Baltimore Thunder). The Bandits are the oldest franchise still playing in their original city and are one of most successful teams in the league, sharing the record for most league titles at 6 with the Toronto Rock and the original Philadelphia Wings franchise.

The Bandits are owned by Hockey Western New York LLC, led by Terry Pegula who also owns the Rochester Americans, Buffalo Sabres and the Buffalo Bills.

==History==

The Bandits played their first season in 1992. They played home games at Buffalo Memorial Auditorium sharing with the Buffalo Sabres until its closure in 1996.

The Bandits became the first expansion franchise in MILL/NLL history to win a championship in its first season. The Bandits repeated as champions in their second season, compiling the league&#x27;s only perfect season to date that year, lost the championship game their third season and captured their third Championship in 1996, their fifth season. It was not until 1999, their eighth season, that the Bandits did not make the playoffs.

After their 1996 championship-winning season, the Bandits returned to the NLL Championship game on three separate occasions (1997, 2004, 2006) only to lose each time, including twice at home. It would not be until 2008 that the Bandits would win their elusive fourth championship, a 14–13 triumph over Portland. The Bandits would lose the finals three more times before securing their fifth championship in 2023. The Bandits won their fifth title against the Colorado Mammoth winning the third and final game of the three game series 13–4. The following year, the Bandits repeated as champions, winning their sixth title in a sweep of the Albany FireWolves. This ties them with Toronto for most league championships, which that their dominance against Toronto in the postseason has fueled the rivalry while also preventing Toronto from several championship appearances.

As of 2024, Buffalo is the longest tenured team in the NLL, in terms of continuous years in their home city, at 33 seasons.

<text>Burma-Shave was an American brand of brushless shaving cream, famous for its advertising gimmick of posting humorous rhyming poems on small sequential highway roadside signs.

==History==
Burma-Shave was introduced in 1925 by the Burma-Vita company in Minneapolis owned by Clinton Odell. The company&#x27;s original product was a liniment made of ingredients described as having come &quot;from the Malay Peninsula and Burma&quot; (hence its name). Sales were sparse, and the company sought to expand sales by introducing a product with wider appeal.

The result was the Burma-Shave brand of brushless shaving cream and its supporting advertising program. Sales increased; at its peak, Burma-Shave was the second-highest-selling brushless shaving cream in the US. Sales declined in the 1950s, and in 1963 the company was sold to Philip Morris. Its well-known advertising signs were removed at that time. The brand decreased in visibility and eventually became the property of the American Safety Razor Company.

In 1997, the American Safety Razor Company reintroduced the Burma-Shave brand with a nostalgic shaving soap and brush kit, though the original Burma-Shave was a brushless shaving cream, and Burma-Shave&#x27;s own roadside signs frequently ridiculed &quot;Grandpa&#x27;s old-fashioned shaving brush.&quot;

==Roadside billboards==

Burma-Shave sign series first appeared on U.S. Highway 65 near Lakeville, Minnesota, in 1926, and remained a major advertising component until 1963 in most of the contiguous United States. The first series read: &quot;Cheer up, face – the war is over! Burma-Shave&quot;. The exceptions were Nevada (deemed to have insufficient road traffic), and Massachusetts (eliminated due to that state&#x27;s high land rentals and roadside foliage). Typically, six consecutive small signs would be posted along the edge of highways, spaced for sequential reading by passing motorists. The last sign was almost always the name of the product. The signs were originally produced in two color combinations: red-and-white and orange-and-black, though the latter was eliminated after a few years. A special white-on-blue set of signs was developed for South Dakota, which restricted the color red on roadside signs to official warning notices.

This use of a series of small signs, each of which bore part of a commercial message, was a successful approach to highway advertising during the early years of highway travel, drawing the attention of passing motorists who were curious to learn the punchline. As the Interstate system expanded in the late 1950s and vehicle speeds increased, it became more difficult to attract motorists&#x27; attention with small signs. When the company was acquired by Philip Morris, the signs were discontinued on advice of counsel.

Some of the signs featured safety messages about speeding instead of advertisements.

Examples of Burma-Shave advertisements are at The House on the Rock in Spring Green, Wisconsin. Re-creations of Burma-Shave sign sets also appear on Arizona State Highway 66, part of the original U.S. Route 66, between Ash Fork, Arizona, and Kingman, Arizona (though they were not installed there by Burma-Shave during its original campaigns), and on Old U.S. Highway 30 near Ogden, Iowa. Other examples are displayed at The Henry Ford in Dearborn, Michigan, the Interstate 44 in Missouri rest area between Rolla and Springfield (which has old Route 66 building picnic structures), the Forney Transportation Museum in Denver, Colorado and the Virginia Museum of Transportation in Roanoke, Virginia.

===Examples===
The complete list of the 600 or so known sets of signs is listed in
&quot;Sunday Drives&quot;
and in the last part of
&quot;The Verse by the Side of the Road&quot;.
The content of the earliest signs is lost, but it is believed that the first recorded signs, for 1927 and soon after, are close to the originals. The first ones were prosaic advertisements. Generally the signs were printed with all capital letters. The style shown below is for readability:
*Shave the modern way / No brush / No lather / No rub-in / Big tube 35 cents – Drug stores / Burma-Shave

As early as 1928, the writers were displaying a puckish sense of humor:
*Takes the &quot;H&quot; out of shave / Makes it save / Saves complexion / Saves time and money / No brush – no lather / Burma-Shave

In 1929, the prosaic ads began to be replaced by actual verses on four signs, with the fifth sign merely a filler for the sixth:
*Every shaver / Now can snore / Six more minutes / Than before / By using / Burma-Shave
*Your shaving brush / Has had its day / So why not / Shave the modern way / With / Burma-Shave

Previously there were only two to four sets of signs per year. 1930 saw major growth in the company, and 19 sets of signs were produced. The writers recycled a previous joke. They continued to ridicule the &quot;old&quot; style of shaving. And they began to appeal to the wives as well:
*Cheer up face / The war is past / The &quot;H&quot; is out / Of shave / At last / Burma-Shave
*Shaving brushes / You&#x27;ll soon see &#x27;em / On the shelf / In some / Museum / Burma-Shave
*Does your husband / Misbehave / Grunt and grumble / Rant and rave / Shoot the brute some / Burma-Shave
*No matter / How you slice it / It&#x27;s still your face / Be humane / Use / Burma-Shave

In 1932, the company recognized the popularity of the signs with a self-referencing gimmick:
*Free / Illustrated / Jingle book / In every / Package / Burma-Shave
*A shave / That&#x27;s real / No cuts to heal / A soothing / Velvet after-feel / Burma-Shave

In 1935, the first known appearance of a road safety message appeared, combined with a punning sales pitch:
*Train approaching / Whistle squealing / Stop / Avoid that run-down feeling / Burma-Shave
*Keep well / To the right / Of the oncoming car / Get your close shaves / From the half pound jar / Burma-Shave

Safety messages began to increase in 1939, as these examples show. (The first of the four is a parody of &quot;Paul Revere&#x27;s Ride&quot; by Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.)
*Hardly a driver / Is now alive / Who passed / On hills / At 75 / Burma-Shave
*Past / Schoolhouses / Take it slow / Let the little / Shavers grow / Burma-Shave
*If you dislike / Big traffic fines / Slow down / Till you / Can read these signs / Burma-Shave
*Don&#x27;t take / a curve / at 60 per. / We hate to lose / a customer / Burma-Shave

In 1939 and subsequent years, demise of the signs was foreshadowed, as busy roadways approaching larger cities featured shortened versions of the slogans on one, two, or three signs – the exact count is not recorded. The puns include a play on the Maxwell House Coffee slogan, standard puns, and yet another reference to the &quot;H&quot; joke:
*Good to the last strop
*Covers a multitude of chins
*Takes the &quot;H&quot; out of shaving

The war years found the company recycling a lot of their old signs, with new ones mostly focusing on World War II propaganda:
*Let&#x27;s make Hitler / And Hirohito / Feel as bad / as Old Benito / Buy War Bonds / Burma-Shave
*Slap / The Jap / With / Iron / Scrap / Burma-Shave

A 1944 advertisement in &quot;Life&quot; magazine ran:
:TOUGH-WHISKERED YANKS / IN HEAVY TANKS
:HAVE JAWS AS SMOOTH / AS GUYS IN BANKS

1963 was the last year for the signs, most of which were repeats, including the final slogan, which had first appeared in 1953:
*Our fortune / Is your / Shaven face / It&#x27;s our best / Advertising space / Burma-Shave

===Special promotional messages===
*Free offer! Free offer! / Rip a fender off your car / mail it in / for a half-pound jar / Burma-Shave
::A large number of fenders were received by the company, which made good on its promise.
*Free – free / a trip to Mars / for 900 / empty jars / Burma-Shave
::Arlyss French, owner of a Red Owl grocery store, did submit 900 empty jars; the company at first replied: &quot;If a trip to Mars / you earn / remember, friend / there&#x27;s no return.&quot; Then Burma-Shave, on the recommendation of Red Owl&#x27;s publicity team, withdrew the one-way offer and instead sent Mr. and Mrs. French on vacation to the town of Moers (often pronounced &quot;Mars&quot; by foreigners) near Duisburg, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany.

=== Cultural impact ===

A number of films and television shows set between the 1920s and 1950s have used the Burma-Shave roadside billboards to help set the scene. Examples include &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;, &quot;A River Runs Through It&quot;, &quot;The World&#x27;s Fastest Indian&quot;, &quot;Stand By Me&quot;, &quot;Tom and Jerry&quot;, &quot;Rat Race&quot;, &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; and the pilot episode (&quot;Genesis&quot;) of &quot;Quantum Leap&quot;. The long-running series &quot;Hee Haw&quot; borrowed the style for program bumpers, transitioning from one show segment to the next or to commercials.

The Flintstones episode &quot;Divided We Sail&quot; has Barney Rubble reading messages on a series of buoys that say, &quot;If You&#x27;re Queasy riding on the wave, just open your mouth. Shout Terra Firma Shave.&quot;

The final episode of the popular television series &quot;M*A*S*H&quot; featured a series of road signs in Korea &quot;Hawk was gone, now he&#x27;s here. Dance til dawn, give a cheer. Burma-Shave&quot;.

Roger Miller&#x27;s song &quot;Burma Shave&quot; (the B-side to his 1961 single &quot;Fair Swiss Maiden&quot;) has the singer musing that he&#x27;s &quot;seen a million rows of them little red poetic signs up and down the line&quot;, while reciting rhymes in the manner of the ads. Tom Waits&#x27; song &quot;Burma-Shave&quot; (from his 1977 album &quot;Foreign Affairs&quot;) uses the signs as an allegory for an unknown destination. (&quot;I guess I&#x27;m headed that-a-way, Just as long as it&#x27;s paved, I guess you&#x27;d say I&#x27;m on my way to Burma-Shave&quot;) Chuck Suchy&#x27;s song &quot;Burma Shave Boogie&quot; (from his 2008 album &quot;Unraveling Heart&quot;) incorporates several of the Burma Shave rhymes into its lyrics.

The pedestrian passageway between the and stations in the New York City Subway system contains a piece of public art inspired by the Burma-Shave ads; Norman B. Colp&#x27;s &quot;The Commuter&#x27;s Lament, or A Close Shave&quot; consists of a series of signs attached to the roof of the passageway, displaying the following text:
:Overslept, / So tired. / If late, / Get fired. / Why bother? / Why the pain? / Just go home / Do it again.

Several highway departments in the United States use signs in the same style to dispense travel safety advice to motorists.

Several writers of doggerel and humorously bad poetry (such as David Burge) often use &quot;Burma Shave&quot; as the last line of their poems to indicate their non-serious nature.

The word burma-shave was used Apr 2011 in Canada, &quot;enlisted the help of an old friend to burmashave near the corner of Pembina,&quot; to describe a gathering of people holding a sign or signs and waving to traffic by the side of the road (a common sight during election campaigns). The term Burmashaving may specifically describe rural American highway signage in the form of a series of 5 rhyming stationary signs (a take-off of Burma-Vita ad campaigns beginning 1926+). Turned political, the expression burma-shaving is several signs of rhyming prose for political messaging of a jokey or scornful nature, e.g., refer to McCain&#x27;s campaign against Obama, to catch the attention of passing motorists for political campaigning. 

During the Apollo 8 mission, a parody of &quot;&#x27;Twas the Night Before Christmas&quot; written by Ken Young was transmitted to the mission, which referenced &quot;A Burma-Shave sign saying &#x27;Kilroy was here&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Senegal&#x27;s music is best known abroad due to the popularity of mbalax, a development of conservative music from different ethnic groups and &quot;sabar&quot; drumming popularized internationally by Youssou N&#x27;Dour.

==National music==
During the colonial ages Senegal was colonized by France and many, though not all, Senegalese identified as French instead of any African ethnicity. Post-independence, the philosophy of negritude arose, which espoused the idea that the &quot;griot&quot; traditions of Senegal were as valid, classical and meaningful as French classical music. The first President of Senegal, Léopold Sédar Senghor (also a poet) was one of the primary exponents of this.
The national anthem of Senegal, &quot;Pincez tous vos koras, frappez les balafons&quot; (&quot;Pluck all your koras, strike the balafons&quot;), was adopted in 1960. Its lyrics, by president Senghor, refer to Senegalese music tradition, while its music was composed by Herbert Pepper (fr).

==Traditional music==
Ethnically the population of Senegal is 41.3% Wolof, 17.8% Fula, 14.7% Serer, 4.9% Mandinka, 3.7% Jola and 2.1% Soninka, with 1% European and Lebanese and 6.4% classed as &quot;other&quot; Senegalese music has been influenced by its different ethnic groups and griots. It tends to be fast and lively whereas the lyrics are in classical Wolof with rhythms used in &quot;sabar&quot; music of the Serer people of the Kingdom of Sine and spread to the Kingdom of Saloum whence Wolof migrants brought it to the Wolof kingdoms. The &quot;Nder&quot; (lead drum), &quot;Sabar&quot; (rhythm drum), and &quot;Tama&quot; (talking drum) percussion section traces some of its technique to the ritual music of &quot;Njuup&quot;. The Serer people infuse their everyday language with complex overlapping cadences and their ritual with intense collaborative layerings of voice and rhythm.&quot;

The &quot;Njuup&quot; was also the progenitor of &quot;Tassu&quot;, used when chanting ancient religious verses. The griots of Senegambia still use it at marriages, naming ceremonies or when singing the praises of patrons. Most Senegalese and Gambian artists use it in their songs. Each motif has a purpose and is used for different occasions. Individual motifs may represent the history and genealogy of a particular family and are used during weddings, naming ceremonies, funerals etc.

==Popular music after independence==

===1950s and 1960s===
Prior to independence, Senegalese popular music consisted of nightclub dance bands (&quot;orchestres&quot;) that played European music, namely American and French songs. As independence approached and the country sought to move away from its colonial past, the popular music of Senegal began to be influenced by the Cuban music that was becoming popular throughout Africa. Ibra Kasse&#x27;s Star Band was the most famous orchestra of the 1960s and 1970s and was a leader in the modernization of Senegalese music. Super Star de Dakar, led by Nigerian saxophonist, Dexter Johnson, spun off from the Star Band and was the other leading band in Dakar in the 1960s. Both played a style that was heavily influenced by Cuban music but had elements of traditional African music.

The south of Senegal, called Casamance, has a strong Mandinka minority, and began producing masters of the kora in the late 1950s. The band Touré Kunda was the most popular group to arise from this scene, and they soon began playing large concerts across the world.

===1970s and 1980s===
The 1970s saw the increased influence of traditional Senegalese music. Traditional drums like the saber and the tama were introduced by leading orchestras and the music progressed over the decade from predominately Latin-influenced to the Senegalese style known as Mbalax. The Star Band and three of its off-shoots from the 1970s were important in the evolution of the music. In 1970, Orchestra Baobab broke away from the Star Band followed by No. One de Dakar in 1976. All three bands were notable for their integration of traditional musical styles into the common Latin dance styles of the Senegalese nightclub bands of the time. In the town of Thiès, Royal Band de Thiès and Dieuf Dieul de Thiès are also considered influential in the evolution of Senegalese popular music.

In 1977, the entire rhythm section and many other performers in the Star Band left to form Étoile de Dakar, who are often considered the first band to play Mbalax. They quickly eclipsed their compatriots, launching the careers of El Hadji Faye and Youssou N&#x27;Dour. Faye and N&#x27;Dour were Senegal&#x27;s first pop stars, but the stress of fame soon drove the band apart. Faye and guitarist Badou N&#x27;diaye formed Étoile 2000, releasing a hit with &quot;Boubou N&#x27;Gary&quot;, but soon disappearing after three similar-sounding albums.

N&#x27;Dour and other members of Étoile de Dakar became known as Super Étoile de Dakar and released four albums within a few months. Super Étoile de Dakar evolved into N&#x27;Dour&#x27;s backing band. He was soon by far the most popular performer in the country, and perhaps in all of West Africa. He introduced more traditional elements to his Senegalized Cuban music, including traditional rapping (tassou), njuup, bakou music (a kind of trilling that accompanies Serer wrestling) and instruments like the sabar.

While N&#x27;Dour and others Africanized Cuban music, another influential band, Xalam, was doing the same with American funk and jazz. They formed in 1970, led then by drummer Prosper Niang, but their controversial lyrics and unfamiliar jazz sound led to a lack of popularity, and the group moved to Paris in 1973. There, they added Jean-Philippe Rykiel on keyboards. Xalam toured with groups such as Rolling Stones and Crosby, Stills, Nash &amp; Young, finally achieving success in Senegal with 1988&#x27;s &quot;Xarit&quot;.

In the latter part of the 1970s, the band Super Diamono formed, fusing mbalax rhythms and militant populism with jazz and reggae influences. Their 1982 &quot;Jigenu Ndakaru&quot; was especially popular. By the middle of the 1980s, Super Diamono was one of the top bands in Senegal, in close and fierce competition with Super Étoile de Dakar. The band&#x27;s popularity declined, however, slowed somewhat by Omar Pene&#x27;s reformation in 1991.

===1990s to the present===
Into the 1990s, Thione Seck, a griot descended from those of Lat Dior, the king of Kayor, arose to solo stardome from Orchestra Baobab, eventually forming his own band called Raam Daan (&quot;crawl slowly towards your goal&quot;). He used electric instruments on many popular releases, especially &quot;Diongoma&quot; and &quot;Demb&quot;. The same period saw the rise of Ismael Lô, a member of Super Diamono, who had major hits, including &quot;Attaya&quot;, &quot;Ceddo&quot; and &quot;Jele bi&quot;.

Baaba Maal is another popular Senegalese singer. He is from Podor and won a scholarship to study music in Paris. After returning, he studied traditional music with his blind guitarist and family griot, Mansour Seck, and began performing with the band Daande Lenol. His &quot;Djam Leelii&quot;, recorded in 1984, became a critical sensation in the United Kingdom after it was released there in 1989. Maal&#x27;s fusions continued into the next decade, with his &quot;Firin&#x27; in Fouta&quot; (1994) album, which used ragga, salsa and Breton harp music to create a popular sound that launched the careers of Positive Black Soul, a group of rappers, and also led to the formation of the Afro-Celt Sound System. His fusion tendencies continued on 1998&#x27;s &quot;Nomad Soul&quot;, which featured Brian Eno as one of seven producers.

Though female performers were achieving popular breakthroughs elsewhere in West Africa, Senegalese women had few opportunities before the 1990s. The first international release by a woman was &quot;Cheikh Anta Mbacke&quot; (1989) by Kiné Lam. The song&#x27;s success led to a string of female performers, including Fatou Guewel, Madiodio Gning, Daro Mbaye and Khar Mbaye Madiaga. Lam, however, remained perhaps the most influential female musician of the 1990s, creating a modernized version of sabar ak xalam ensembles by adding bass guitar and synthesizer with 1993&#x27;s &quot;Sunu Thiossane&quot;. The release of Fatou Guewel&#x27;s CD entitled &#x27;Fatou&#x27; in 1998 was significantly influential for Mbalax; this is also the case with her band &#x27;Groupe Sope Noreyni&#x27;.

The new century has seen the rise of Viviane Ndour, who got her first break as a backing vocalist to Youssou Ndour with Super Etoile. She is well known in Senegal and the diaspora, collaborating with French rap star Mokobe and Zouk artist Philip Montiero and incorporating RnB, Hip-Hop and other elements into her own style of Mbalax.

Acoustic folk music has also left its mark on Senegal&#x27;s music culture. Artists that have contributed to this genre include TAMA from Rufisque, Pape Armand Boye, les Freres Guisse, Pape et Cheikh, and Cheikh Lo.

The biggest trend in 1990s Senegal, however, was hip hop. Traditional culture includes rapping traditions, such as the formal tassou, performed by women of the Laobe woodworking class the morning after marriages. Modern Senegalese hip hop is mostly in Wolof, alongside some English and French. Positive Black Soul is the best-known group in the country, Daara j, Gokh-Bi System and Wageble too. Senegalese-French rapper MC Solaar is a very well known musician. Senegalese born Akon has risen to world fame.

In 2008 English musician Ramon Goose travelled to Dakar and collaborated with Senegalese griot Diabel Cissokho to record the album Mansana Blues which explores African blues &amp; traditional West African styles, this led on to the formation of The West African Blues Project with Touré Kunda singer Modou Toure.

<text>Panay is the sixth-largest and fourth-most populous island in the Philippines, with a total land area of and a total population of 4,542,926, as of 2020 census. Panay comprises 4.4 percent of the entire population of the country. The City of Iloilo is its largest settlement, with a total population of 457,626 inhabitants as of the 2020 census.

Panay is a triangular island, located in the western part of the Visayas. It is about across. It is divided into four provinces: Aklan, Antique, Capiz, and Iloilo, all in the Western Visayas Region. Just off the mid-southeastern coast lies the island-province of Guimaras. It is located southeast of the island of Mindoro and northwest of Negros across the Guimaras Strait. To the north and northeast is the Sibuyan Sea, Jintotolo Channel and the island-provinces of Romblon and Masbate; to the west and southwest is the Sulu Sea and the Palawan archipelago and to the south is Panay Gulf. Panay is the only main island in the Visayas whose provinces does not bear the name of their island.

Panay is bisected by the Central Panay Mountain Range, its longest mountain chain. The island has many rivers, the longest being the Panay River at a length of , followed by the Jalaur, Aklan, Sibalom, Iloilo and Bugang rivers. Standing at about , the dormant Mount Madja-as (situated in Culasi, Antique) is the highest point of the island, with Mount Nangtud (located between Barbaza, Antique and Jamindan, Capiz) following next at .

The island lent its name to several United States Navy vessels including , sunk in 1937 by the Japanese in the USS &quot;Panay&quot; incident.

==History==

===Etymology===
Before the 13th century, Panay was called &quot;Simsiman&quot;. The community is located at the shores of the Ulian River and was linked by a creek. The creek provided salt to the Ati people as well as animals which lick the salt out of the salty water. Coming from the root word &quot;&quot;simsim&quot;, &quot;simsimin&quot; means &quot;to lick something to eat or to drink&quot;, thus the place was called &quot;Simsiman&quot;.

The native Ati called the island &quot;Aninipay&quot; from words &quot;ani&quot; to harvest and &quot;nipay&quot;&quot;, a hairy grass abundant in the whole Panay.

===Precolonial era===
No pre-Hispanic written accounts of Iloilo and Panay island exist today. Oral traditions, in the form of recited epics like the &quot;Hinilawod&quot;, have survived to a small degree. A few recordings of these epic poems exist. The most notable are the works of noted Filipino anthropologist Felipe Jocano.

While no current archaeological evidence exists describing pre-Hispanic Panay, an original work by Pedro Alcantara Monteclaro published in 1907 called Maragtas details the alleged accounts of the founding of the various pre-Hispanic polities on Panay Island. The book is based on oral and written accounts available to the author at the time. The author made no claim for the historical accuracy of the accounts. Noted anthropologist and historian William Henry Scott initially concluded in his dissertation that it was a myth, but in a revised version admitted its credibility is debatable and concluded it was most likely based on real folk legends.

According to Maragtas, the Confederation of Madja-as was founded after ten datus fled Borneo and landed on Panay Island. The book then goes on to detail their subsequent purchase of the coastal lands in which they settled from the native Ati people.

An old manuscript &quot;Margitas&quot; of uncertain date (discovered by the anthropologist H. Otley Beyer) gives interesting details about the laws, government, social customs, and religious beliefs of the early Visayans, who settled Panay within the first half of the thirteenth century. The term &quot;Visayan&quot; was first applied only to them and to their settlements eastward in the island of Negros, and northward in the smaller islands, which now compose the province of Romblon. In fact, even at the early part of Spanish colonialization of the Philippines, the Spaniards used the term &quot;Visayan&quot; only for these areas. While the people of Cebu, Bohol, and Leyte were for a long time known only as Pintados. The name &quot;Visayan&quot; was later extended to them because, as several of the early writers state, their languages are closely allied to the Visayan dialect of Panay.

Gabriel Ribera, captain of the Spanish royal infantry in the Philippine Islands, also distinguished Panay from the rest of the Pintados Islands. In his report (dated 20 March 1579) regarding a campaign to pacify the natives living along the rivers of Mindanao (a mission he received from Dr. Francisco de Sande, Governor and Captain-General of the Archipelago), Ribera mentioned that his aim was to make the inhabitants of that island &quot;vassals of King Don Felipe… as are all the natives of the island of Panay, the Pintados Islands, and those of the island of Luzon…&quot;

During the early part of the colonial period in the Archipelago, the Spaniards led by Miguel López de Legazpi transferred their camp from Cebu to Panay in 1569. On 5 June 1569, Guido de Lavezaris, the royal treasurer in the Archipelago, wrote to Philip II reporting about the Portuguese attack to Cebu in the preceding autumn. A letter from another official, Andres de Mirandaola (dated three days later, 8 June), also described briefly this encounter with the Portuguese. The danger of another attack led the Spaniards to remove their camp from Cebu to Panay, which they considered a safer place. Legazpi himself, in his report to the Viceroy in New Spain (dated 1 July 1569), mentioned the same reason for the relocation of Spaniards to Panay. It was in Panay that the conquest of Luzon was planned, and later launched on 8 May 1570.

===The account of early Spanish explorers===
During the early part of the Spanish colonization of the Philippines, the Spanish Augustinian Friar Gaspar de San Agustín, O.S.A. described Panay as: &quot;…very similar to that of Sicily in its triangular form, as well as in it fertility and abundance of provision. It is the most populated island after Manila and Mindanao, and one of the largest (with over a hundred leagues of coastline). In terms of fertility and abundance, it is the first.&quot; […] &quot;It is very beautiful, very pleasant, and full of coconut palms… Near the river Alaguer&quot; (&quot;Halaur&quot;), &quot;which empties into the sea two leagues from the town of Dumangas…, in the ancient times, there was a trading center and a court of the most illustrious nobility in the whole island.&quot; Padre Francisco Colin (1592–1660), an early Jesuit missionary and Provincial of his Order in the Philippines also records in the chronicles of the Society of Jesus (published later in 1663 as &quot;Labor euangelica&quot;) that Panay is the island which is most abundant and fertile.

The first Spanish settlement in Panay island and the second oldest Spanish settlement in the Philippines was established by the Miguel López de Legazpi expedition in Panay, Capiz at the banks of the Panay River in northern Panay, the name of which was extended to the whole Panay island. López de Legazpi transferred the capital there from Cebu since it had abundant provisions and was better protected from Portuguese attacks before the capital was once again transferred to Manila.

Miguel de Luarca, who was among the first Spanish settlers in the Island, made one of the earliest account about Panay and its people according to a Westerner&#x27;s point of view. In June 1582, while he was in Arévalo (Iloilo), he wrote in his &quot;Relación de las Yslas Filipinas&quot; the following observations:

The island is the most fertile and well-provisioned of all the islands discovered, except the island of Luzon: for it is exceedingly fertile, and abounds in rice, swine, fowls, wax, and honey; it produces also a great quantity of cotton and abacá fiber.

&quot;The villages are very close together, and the people are peaceful and open to conversion. The land is healthful and well-provisioned, so that the Spaniards who are stricken in other islands go thither to recover their health.&quot;

&quot;The natives are healthy and clean, and although the island of Cebu is also healthful and had a good climate, most of its inhabitants are always afflicted with the itch and buboes. In the island of Panay, the natives declare that no one of them had ever been afflicted with buboes until the people from Bohol – who, as we said above, abandoned Bohol on account of the people of Maluco – came to settle in Panay, and gave the disease to some of the natives. For these reasons the governor, Don Gonzalo Ronquillo, founded the town of Arévalo, on the south side of this island; for the island runs north and south, and on that side live the majority of the people, and the villages are near this town, and the land here is more fertile.&quot; This probably explains why there are reference of presence of Pintados in the Island.

&quot;The island of Panay provides the city of Manila and other places with a large quantity of rice and meat…&quot;... &quot;As the island contains great abundance of timber and provisions, it has almost continuously had a shipyard on it, as is the case of the town of Arévalo, for galleys and fragatas. Here the ship &#x27;Visaya&#x27; was launched.&quot;

Another Spanish chronicler in the early Spanish period, Dr. Antonio de Morga (Year 1609) is also responsible for recording other Visayan customs. Customs such as Visayans&#x27; affinity for singing among their warrior-castes as well as the playing of gongs and bells in naval battles.

&quot;Their customary method of trading was by bartering one thing for another, such as food, cloth, cattle, fowls, lands, houses, fields, slaves, fishing-grounds, and palm-trees (both nipa and wild). Sometimes a price intervened, which was paid in gold, as agreed upon, or in metal bells brought from China. These bells they regard as precious jewels; they resemble large pans and are very sonorous. They play upon these at their feasts, and carry them to the war in their boats instead of drums and other instruments.&quot;

&quot;The early Dutch fleet commander Cornelis Matelieff de Jonge called at Panay in 1607. He mentions a town named &quot;Oton&quot; on the island where there were &quot;18 Spanish soldiers with a number of other Spanish inhabitants so that there may be 40 whites in all&quot;. He explained that &quot;a lot of rice and meat is produced there, with which they [i.e. the Spanish] supply Manila.&quot;&quot;

According to Stephanie J. Mawson, using recruitment records found in Mexico, in addition to the 40 Caucasian Spaniards who then lived in Oton, there were an additional set of 66 Mexican soldiers of Mulatto, Mestizo or Native American descent sentried there during the year 1603. However, the Dutch visitor, Cornelis Matelieff de Jongedid, did not count them in since they were not pure whites like him.

Iloilo City in Panay was awarded by the Queen of Spain the title: &quot;&#x27;La Muy Leal y Noble Ciudad de Iloilo&quot;&#x27; (The Most Loyal and Noble City) for being the most loyal and noble city in the Spanish Empire since it clung on to Spain amidst the Philippine revolution the last nation to revolt against Spain in the Spanish Empire.

=== Colonial rule (1565–1898) ===

The Spaniards landed in Batan (in Panay&#x27;s northeastern territory, which is currently called &quot;Province of Aklan&quot;), in 1565. Following the Spanish conquest, the locals became Christians. Father Andres Urdaneta baptized thousands of Aklanons in 1565, and consequently these settlements were named &quot;Calivo&quot;.

Legazpi then parceled Aklan to his men. Antonio Flores became encomiendero for all settlements along the Aklan River and he was also appointed in charge of pacification and religious instruction. Pedro Sarmiento; was appointed for Batan, Francisco de Rivera; for Mambusao, Gaspar Ruiz de Morales; and for Panay town, Pedro Guillen de Lievana.

Later (in 1569), Miguel López de Legazpi transferred the Spanish headquarters from Cebu to Panay. On 5 June 1569, Guido de Lavezaris, the royal treasurer in the Archipelago, wrote to Philip II reporting about the Portuguese attack to Cebu in the preceding autumn. A letter from another official, Andres de Mirandaola (dated three days later - 8 June), also described briefly this encounter with the Portuguese. The danger of another attack led the Spaniards to remove their camp from Cebu to Panay, which they considered a safer place. Legazpi himself, in his report to the Viceroy in New Spain (dated 1 July 1569), mentioned the same reason for the relocation of Spaniards to Panay. It was in Panay that the conquest of Luzon was planned, and launched on 8 May 1570.

In 1572, the island was organized into two provinces: jurisdictions of Panay (Capiz and Aklan) and Oton (Iloilo and Antique).

In 1693, the town of Capiz, known as El Puerto de Capiz was finally created.

In 1716, Capiz was organized into a separate politico-military province with the transfer of the capital from the town of Panay, Under its jurisdiction were the neighboring islands of Campo, Romblon, Tablas, and Sibuyan.

In 1796, Panay island was divided into three provinces: Iloilo, Antique, and Capiz (which included Aklan and Romblon).

In 1853, The island now comprising Romblon province and Maestre de Campo was organized into separate politico-military “comandancia” administered from Capiz.

In 1898, The Spanish educated Panay Island and were replaced by the revolutionary forces, who were in turn overthrown by the American the following year.

=== World War II ===
On April 16, 1942, Imperial Japanese Army forces landed at San Jose de Buenavista, Capiz City (now the city of Roxas), and Iloilo City during World War II in order to secure Panay and the rest of Visayas. Guerrilla forces under Colonel Macario Peralta Jr. later liberated most of the island and eventually captured the city of Capiz on December 20, 1944. Peralta&#x27;s forces therefore achieved the liberation from Japanese occupation of all of Capiz Province before Allied forces landed at Iloilo City on March 18, 1945, and mopped up the remaining Japanese forces in the island.

=== Modern period ===
Aklan (Akean) became an independent province through &quot;Republic Act No. 1414&quot; signed by Philippine President Ramon Magsaysay on April 25, 1956, separating Aklan from Capiz. The original towns were Altavas, Balete, Batan, Banga, Buruanga, Ibajay, Kalibo, Lezo, Libacao, Madalag, Malay, Makato, Malinao, Nabas, New Washington, Numancia, and Tangalan, then all part of the province of Capiz. The province was inaugurated on November 8, 1956. Jose Raz Menez was appointed the first governor of Aklan by President Magsaysay and he served until December 30, 1959. In 1960, Godofredo P. Ramos became the first elected governor but upon resigning to run for Congress he was succeeded by the vice governor, Virgilio S. Patricio. In 1964, José B. Legaspi succeeded Patricio and he held office for two consecutive terms from 1964 to 1971.

==Geography==

Panay island is the sixth largest island in the Philippines by area, with a total land area of . Mount Madja-as is the highest point in Panay with an elevation of above sea level, located in town of Culasi in the northern province of Antique. Central Panay Mountain Range is the longest and largest mountain range in the island with a total length of north-south. Panay River is the longest river in the island with a total length of located in the province of Capiz.

Boracay Island, a popular tourist destination known for its long white sand shore, is located off the northwest tip of Panay Island. It is part of Aklan province under the jurisdiction of the municipality of Malay.

=== Topography ===
The highest mountain is Mount Madja-as, at .

===Rivers===

Major rivers in Panay include:
* Jalaur River
* Iloilo River
* Batiano River
* Panay River
* Aklan River
* Sibalom River
* Tipulu-an River
* Mao-it River
* Bugang River

==Demographics==
Panay is the most ethnically and linguistically diverse major island in the Visayas, being native to four vibrant non-indigenous ethnolinguistic groups (Hiligaynon/Ilonggo, Karay-a, Capiznon, Aklanon), and two indigenous groups (Suludnon, Ati) or minorities. However, the ethnic and linguistic boundaries within the island do not correspond to its administrative divisions. Only the province of Antique is monolingual, which only speaks Kinaray-a as its primary language. The &quot;lingua franca&quot; of the island is Hiligaynon, native to Iloilo City and the northeastern coastal strip lining the province of Iloilo. For local administrative, educational, and commercial purposes, English and Tagalog are also widely used.

== Economy ==

Panay Island&#x27;s economy thrives due to the combined strengths and contributions of its four provinces. The diversity of industries, including agriculture, fishing, tourism, manufacturing, and natural resource utilization, sustains the island&#x27;s robust economic growth and development. As a result, Panay Island has emerged as the fifth economic giant in the Philippines.

Iloilo, including Iloilo City, which serves as the economic center, plays a pivotal role in driving the island&#x27;s economy. The province is a hub for various industries, including real estate, accommodation, medical centers, education, shopping centers, business centers, IT/BPO centers, and more. Its vibrant and multifaceted economy has positioned Iloilo as one of the most competitive provinces in the country.

Aklan, known for Boracay Island, serves as the tourism center of Panay Island. The world-famous tourist destination attracts a significant number of visitors, contributing to the province&#x27;s tourism industry. Aklan&#x27;s economy benefits from the influx of tourists and the diverse range of activities and services catering to their needs.

Capiz, dubbed the &quot;Seafood Capital of the Philippines,&quot; takes advantage of its coastal areas and swampy lands, supporting a thriving fishing industry. The province&#x27;s aquamarine resources, including prawns, milkfish, marlin, squid, oysters, shrimp, and seaweed, contribute significantly to its economic growth.

Antique&#x27;s economy relies on fishing, with a rich fishing ground along its coastline. Additionally, the province&#x27;s forest resources, such as bamboo, buri, bariw, nito, logs, and charcoal, contribute to the construction industry, furniture-making, and handicrafts. The natural beauty of Antique, including the presence of the rafflesia flower and protected forestland, further enhances its tourism potential.

==Administrative divisions==
The island is covered by 4 provinces, 1 highly urbanized city, 2 component cities, 92 municipalities (93 municipalities if the associated islands of Caluya are included), and 3,291 barangays, all under the jurisdiction of the Western Visayas region.

== Transportation ==

=== Road ===

All the provinces in Panay are interconnected by major inter-provincial roads. Iloilo City is served mostly by passenger jeepneys, white metered taxis and tricycles within the city limits. The primary transportation vehicle used within Roxas City, Kalibo, San Jose de Buenavista and other cities and municipalities in Panay is the tricycle. Travel between cities and municipalities is typically by jeepney, vans and Ceres operated buses. In March 2019, the Land Transportation Franchising and Regulatory Board announced the opening of a new Premium Point-to-Point Bus Service in Iloilo City with express bus services to the airports in Cabatuan, Kalibo and Boracay (Caticlan).

Iloilo is one of the few cities in the Philippines that recently initiated to adopt the mini-bus-like type modern PUJ or modern Jeepneys in contrast to the President Rodrigo Duterte&#x27;s administration to phase out the old dilapidated jeepneys as the mode of mass public transportation in the Philippines.

The Iloilo-Capiz-Aklan Expressway (ICAEx) is also being proposed, which might reduce travel time between provinces in Panay. It will connect Iloilo City and Malay, Aklan through Passi City, Roxas City and Kalibo, Aklan.

=== Airports ===

Panay Island is now served by five airports. The Iloilo International Airport, located in Cabatuan, Iloilo, serves the general area of Iloilo-Guimaras Metropolitan as well the whole province of Iloilo, and is also considered to be the primary gateway into the region. The Kalibo International Airport is one of the two airports serving Boracay, the other being Godofredo P. Ramos Airport (also known as Caticlan Airport) in the municipality of Malay. The Roxas Airport is a domestic airport serving the general area of Roxas City and the province of Capiz. The Evelio Javier Airport (Antique Airport) is the only airport serving the province of Antique located in San Jose. The other, Semirara Airport in Caluya is a municipal airport.

==== International ====

* Iloilo International Airport
* Kalibo International Airport

==== Domestic ====

* Godofredo P. Ramos Airport (Caticlan Airport)
* Roxas Airport
* Evelio Javier Airport (Antique Airport)

=== Rail ===

Proposals to re-connect again Iloilo-Roxas, Iloilo-Kalibo, Iloilo-Malay (Aklan) and Iloilo-San Jose (Antique) from the Iloilo City via rail was included in the revival of the currently defunct Panay Railways network which has a station in Santa Barbara town proper.

<doc id="246437" wikidata="Q188237" url="?curid=246437" title="Music of Cape Verde">
<text>Cape Verde is known internationally for &quot;morna&quot;, a form of folk music usually sung in the Cape Verdean Creole, accompanied by clarinet, violin, guitar and cavaquinho. &quot;Funaná&quot;, &quot;Coladeira&quot;, &quot;Batuque&quot; and &quot;Cabo love&quot; are other musical forms.

==Language==
In the contrary of Cape Verdean literature, the music of Cape Verde is performed in Cape Verdean Creole and not in Portuguese. Therefore, the music, in Cape Verde, is considered to be creolophone and not lusophone. Songs composed in Portuguese do exist (for instance, &quot;“Mar eterno”&quot; from Eugénio Tavares, &quot;“Ponta do Sol”&quot; from António Caldeira Marques, &quot;“Separação”&quot; from Palmeirinho) but are extremely scarce.

==History==
Cape Verde is an island archipelago that was uninhabited until the Portuguese arrived in 1462. The sailors brought with them African slaves, and the islands&#x27; population became mixed with elements of both races. Climate conditions made the islands inhospitable, and the Portuguese governments mostly ignored the inhabitants and the frequent droughts and famines that wracked the islands periodically. As a result, there are now more Cape Verdeans abroad than at home, and sizable communities exist in New England, Portugal, Wales, Senegal, Italy, France and the Netherlands.

In 2011, it would be one of the most recent countries to have its own music award – the Cabo Verde Music Awards. This recognises the greatest songs of the year by Cape Vedean and foreign artists. At the continental level, singers or artists from Cape Verde and Capeverdeans abroad are included in the MTV Africa Music Awards, hosted each year by the music network MTV. From 2001-2011, Cape Verdeans and Capeverdeans abroad were awarded the KORA Awards, with only two singers ever winning – Cesária Évora and Suzanna Lubrano.

==Folk music==
===Morna===
&quot;Morna&quot; is by far the most popular genre of Cape Verdean music, and it has produced an international superstar in Cesária Évora. &quot;Morna&quot; is a national song-style, like Argentinian tango, beloved by Cape Verdeans across the many islands of the country. Lyrics are usually in Creole, and reflect highly-variable themes, including love and lust, patriotism and mourning.

Morna is believed to have originated on Boa Vista as a cheerful song-type. Eugénio Tavares was an influential songwriter of the period, and his songs are still extensively performed. Morna also spread to São Vicente, and composers like B. Leza and Manuel de Novas became popular. Solo vocalists are accompanied by a guitar, violin, bass guitar, piano and cavaquinho (similar to a ukulele).

In the 1930s, &quot;Morna&quot; evolved in a swifter form of music called &quot;coladeira&quot;. It is a more light-hearted and humorous genre, with sensual rhythms. Performers include Codé di Dona, Manuel de Novas, Frank Cavaquim, Djosa Marques and Os Tubarões.

Aside from Évora, popular &quot;morna&quot; musicians include Ildo Lobo, Titina, Celina Pereira, Bana, Djosinha, B. Leza, Travadinha, Sãozinha, Maria Alice, Carmen Souza, Gardénia Benros, and Assol Garcia.

===Funaná===
&quot;Funaná&quot; is an accordion-based genre from Santiago. Prior to independence, &quot;funaná&quot; was denigrated by colonial authorities, who considered it African. Since independence, however, bands like Bulimundo adapted the music for pop audiences and Finaçon, who combined &quot;funaná&quot; and &quot;coladeira&quot; into a fusion called &quot;funacola&quot;. Other group includes Paris-based La MC Malcriado

===Batuque===
&quot;Batuque&quot; is also popular in Cape Verde. Originally a woman&#x27;s folk music, &quot;batuque&quot; is an improvised music with strong satirical or critical lyrics. In the 80&#x27;s, Orlando Pantera has created the &quot;new batuco&quot; (neo-batuku), but he died in 2001 before to achieve his creative work. Performers and songwriters are Orlando Pantera, Vadú, Tcheka, Mayra Andrade, Lura, Zeca di nha Reinalda.

===Tabanka===
&quot;Tabanka&quot; or &quot;Tabanca&quot; is a form of music in Cape Verde, also popular, it characterizes by having an allegro, a binary compass,[1] &quot;and traditionally being melodic only&quot;. Singers or artists and band include Os Tubarões, Zezé di Nha Reinalda, Finaçon, Orlando Pantera and Simentera.

===Coladeira===
&quot;Coladeira&quot; is a form of dance and music from Cape Verde. Singers and musicians includes Nancy Vieira, the band Simentera, Mité Costa, Bana, Manecas Matos, Cabral &amp; Cabo Verde Show, Ildo Lobo, Djalunga, Paulino Vieira, Dudú Araújo, Beto Dias and Suzanna Lubrano

===Colá===
&quot;Colá&quot; is a form of music from Cape Verde. It is mainly sung during religious festivals in the islands of Santo Antão, São Vicente, São Nicolau, Boa Vista and Brava.

==Popular music==

===Cola-zouk===

In the late 1970s, the cape verdean diaspora living in Europe and North America have influenced the traditional &quot;Coladeira&quot; with Compas / Kompa to create a version of Zouk called Cola-zouk, a similar Compas (Kompa) fusion to the French Antillean&#x27;s Zouk&quot; or &quot;Zouk Love&quot;. Later, the new generation who grew up in Cape Verde featured a slow mixed version of electric pop music with Cape Verdean music styles, a light Compas called &quot;Cabo Love&quot; or &quot;Cabo Zouk&quot;. The Cape Verdean Zouks are typically sung in Cape Verdean creole, it is often mistaken for the Angolan kizomba. This light Compas has become popular in Portuguese speaking countries of Africa, Brazil, and the rest of the world. Most of the songs are written in Portuguese/creole.

Cape Verdean Zouk singers and producers include Suzanna Lubrano, Nilton Ramalho, Johnny Ramos, Nelson Freitas, Mika Mendes, Manu Lima, Cedric Cavaco, Elji, Loony Johnson, Klasszik, Mark G, Tó Semedo, Beto Dias, Heavy H, Marcia, Gilyto, Kido Semedo, Ricky Boy, Klaudio Ramos, M&amp;N Pro, Gilson, Gil, G-Amado, Philip Monteiro, Z-BeatZ Pro, Gama, Juceila Cardoso and Denis Graça.

===Hip-hop===
Hip-hop is also a growing trend in Cape Verdean music both inside Cape Verde and those abroad. The music genre started outside Cape Verde and has gained popularity inside Cape Verde. Several of the artists are based outside Cape Verde and the Capeverdean communities abroad, including Portugal, France, Angola and the Netherlands. Rappers include Cape Verde-born Boss AC, Jacky Brown and Stomy Bugsy from France, Angolan-born Elizio, and Nelson Freitas from the Netherlands.

<doc id="246438" wikidata="Q6942271" url="?curid=246438" title="Music of Sierra Leone">
<text>Sierra Leone&#x27;s music is a mixture of native, French, British, West Indian and Creole musical genres.

Palm wine music is representative, played by an acoustic guitar with percussion in countries throughout coastal West Africa.

Sierra Leone, like much of West Africa is open to Rap, Reggae, Dancehall, R&amp;B, and Grime.

==Sierra Leone National music==
The national anthem of Sierra Leone, &quot;High We Exalt Thee, Realm of the Free&quot;, was composed by John Akar with lyrics by Clifford Nelson Fyle and arrangement by Logie E. K. Wright. It was adopted upon independence in 1961.

==Traditional music==
The largest ethnic group in Sierra Leone (2009) is that of the Mel-speaking Temne people, 35% of the population. Next, at 31%, the Mende, along with 2% Mandingo, have music traditions related to Mende populations in neighbouring countries. Other recorded populations were the Limba ( 8%), the Kono (5%), the Loko (2%) and the Sierra Leone Creole people (2%), while 15% were recorded as &quot;others&quot;.

The wars and civil conflict throughout West Africa, have resulted in a decrease in the presence of traditional music artists.

==Popular music==

===Palm-wine===

Sierra Leonean palm wine music is known as maringa, and it was first popularized by the Creole musician Ebenezer Calendar &amp; His Maringar Band, who used Caribbean styles, especially Trinidadian calypso. Calendar played the guitar, trumpet, mandolin and the cornet, while also penning some of the most oft-played songs in Sierra Leonean music in the 1950s and 60s. His most popular song was &quot;Double-Decker Bus&quot;, commissioned by Decca to promote the launching of a double-decker bus line. He eventually moved towards socially and spiritually aware lyrics.

===Gumbe===

Gumbe (also &quot;goombay&quot; or &quot;gumbay&quot;), is a Creole musical genre and has also had a long presence in Sierra Leone. The gumbe, a square drum with legs, was an
important cultural symbol for the Jamaican maroon settlers who were to become part of the Sierra Leone Creole ethnic community. The drum had always been associated with the invocation of
their ancestors (Bilby 2007:15), and played an important role in their Maroon strongholds in Jamaica in the 18th century, in their
fight for freedom against the British. It was used for the communication of messages
and also to warn them of future attacks being planned by the British. The sound of these
drums provoked a trance from which these premonitions were made (Lewin 2000:160).
The gumbe is still used today by the descendants of the maroons in Jamaica and Sierra Leone. Currently
the gumbe enjoys a continuing presence in Creole culture in Sierra Leone. This drum is also
still used in Freetown to enter into a trance and predict the future in events such as baptisms
and weddings (Aranzadi 2010). Gumbe has also been influential on three of Sierra Leones’s 20th century
popular dance-music styles: namely Asiko or Ashiko, Maringa and Milo jazz (Collins: 2007:180). Dr. Oloh was the most widely acknowledged innovator of Sierra Leone gumbe and milo jazz music

===Afropop===

Beginning in the 1970s, rumba, Congolese music, funk and soul combined to form a popular kind of Afropop. Major bands of this era included Sabannoh 75, Orchestra Muyei, Super Combo and the Afro-National. Sierra Leoneans abroad have created their own styles, such as Seydu, Ansoumana Bangura, Abdul Tee-Jay, Bosca Banks, Daddy Rahmanu, Patricia Bakarr and Sidike Diabate and Mwana Musa&#x27;s African Connexion.

===Modern===
The internet has encouraged the youth to new styles of music. Many songs have political and social themes, informing the populace and checking politicians. The independent film, &quot;Sweet Salone&quot;, displays many of these artists, fans, and their music.

Mwana Musa (Musa Kalamulah) and the band African Connexion married Sierra Leone, Congolese and jazz rhythms. Mwana Musa was an able composer who worked with musicians such as David Toop, Steve Beresford, Ray Carless, Ugo Delmirani, Robin Jones, Mongoley (Lipua Lipua) Safroman (GO Malebo)Len Jones one of Sierra Leones finest guitarists, Lindel Lewis, Ayo-Roy MAcauley leading guitarist from Sierra Leone, Kevin Robinson, Paapa Jay-Mensah etc. African Connexion was signed to Charlie Gillet&#x27;s Oval Records and produced &quot;C&#x27;est La Danse&quot;, &quot;Moziki&quot;, &quot;City Limits&quot;, &quot;Midnight Pressure&quot;, &quot;Dancing On The Sidewalk&quot;, a soca-tinged soukous, and &quot;E Sidom Panam&quot; - typical Sierra Leone dance music.

<text>Canigao Channel is a strait in the Central Visayan and Eastern Visayan regions in the Philippines. This strait separates the islands of Bohol and Leyte, while the Cebu Strait separates Bohol and Cebu. Thus, the Camotes Sea is connected to the Bohol Sea both by the Canigao Channel (east of Bohol) and Cebu Strait (west of Bohol).

The Adam Reef, the Abel Reef, the Cain Reef, and the Eve Reef are coral reefs that can be found in this channel. The Tood Islets and Canigao Island can also be found in this channel.

<text>Powell&#x27;s Books is a chain of bookstores, based in Portland, Oregon. Their flagship store, dubbed Powell&#x27;s City of Books, claims to be the largest independent new and used bookstore in the world.

In addition to Powell&#x27;s City of Books, Powell&#x27;s currently operates three other Portland area stores, as well as a satellite store in the town of Condon.

==History==
===20th century===
Walter Powell founded Powell&#x27;s in 1971. His son, Michael Powell, had started a bookstore in Chicago, Illinois, in 1970 which specialized in used, rare, and discounted books, primarily of an academic and scholarly nature. In 1979, Michael Powell joined his father in Portland, right after his father&#x27;s store was not offered a lease renewal; within a year, they found the location that became its current headquarters. Michael bought the bookstore from his father in 1982.

In 1984, Powell&#x27;s opened its first branch store, in a suburban shopping center named Loehmann&#x27;s Plaza (later renamed Cascade Plaza), near Washington Square. The new branch was not a replica of its City of Books location; Powell was concerned that the &quot;edgy&quot; neighborhood of its headquarters location was limiting its customer base, so the new store was &quot;fairly fancy&quot; with white shelving, a tile floor, and banners over the aisles. It was also four times the size of the typical chain bookstore.

A travel bookstore was established in 1985 on Pioneer Courthouse Square, and other stores followed, one a year for the next few years. By the early 1990s, Powell&#x27;s bookstores were part of the resurgence of the independent bookstore, which collectively made 32 percent of book sales in the U.S. The travel store closed in 2005.

Powell&#x27;s established its Internet presence in 1993, beginning with email and FTP-based access to its technical bookstore; it has since expanded to incorporate fiction and other genres as a traditional ecommerce site. Their website was established in 1994, before Amazon.com, and has contributed substantially to the chain&#x27;s recent growth.

The City of Books location grew to its current size after an expansion that opened in 1999; it included a new entrance facing the Pearl District which featured the &quot;Pillar of Books&quot;, a Tenino sandstone carving depicting a stack of eight of the world&#x27;s great books, on a base with the inscription &quot;Buy the book, read the book, enjoy the book, sell the book&quot; in Latin. For the year ending June 2000, Powell&#x27;s revenue was $41.8 million.

===21st century===
In 2002, Powell&#x27;s was cited by &quot;USA Today&quot; as one of America&#x27;s 10 best bookstores.

In January 2008, Powell&#x27;s announced plans to expand the downtown City of Books by adding as many as two floors to the store&#x27;s southeast corner. The expansion was due to add at least of new retail space. Plans submitted to the Portland Design Commission in November 2008 called for a rooftop garden atop the new addition and an &quot;art cube&quot; over a redesigned main entrance.

In March 2010, Michael Powell confirmed plans to hand over management of the business to his daughter Emily as of July. That same month, Powell&#x27;s announced it would close its technical bookstore on the North Park Blocks, moving its sections on math, science, computing, engineering, construction, and transportation into &quot;Powell&#x27;s Books Building 2&quot; at the corner of 10th and Couch Street, near the main City of Books location. The consolidation was in response to a five-year decline in brick-and-mortar sales of technical books in favor of online sales.

In October 2010, Powell&#x27;s announced it had bought 7,000 books from the library of author Anne Rice; Powell&#x27;s offered these association copies on their website. The bookstore was revealed as a charter member of the Google eBooks service when the news was announced by Google on December 6, 2010.

In June 2011, Powell&#x27;s participated in Google Offers during that service&#x27;s first month of operation; according to TechCrunch—which characterized Powell&#x27;s as a &quot;Portland institution&quot;—&quot;5,000 Powell’s vouchers sold out in a matter of hours&quot;, making it &quot;most popular deal in the month.&quot;

Starting in May 2012, Powell&#x27;s began offering access to print on demand books via the Espresso Book Machine.

In early 2013, Emily Powell announced that Miriam Sontz, the company&#x27;s chief operating officer, would take over as chief executive officer.

In 2016, CNN rated it one of the &quot;coolest&quot; bookstores in the world.

CEO Miriam Sontz retired in January 2019. Emily Powell remains president and owner.

== Locations ==
=== Powell&#x27;s City of Books ===
Powell&#x27;s flagship store, dubbed Powell&#x27;s City of Books, is located in the Pearl District on the edge of downtown and occupies a full city block between NW 10th and 11th Avenues and between W. Burnside and NW Couch Streets. It contains over , about 1.6 acres, of retail floor space.

The City of Books has nine color-coded rooms and over 3,500 different sections.
The inventory for its retail and online sales is over four million new, used, rare, and out-of-print books. As of 2009, Powell&#x27;s was buying around 3,000 used books a day.

=== Former locations ===
In the 1980s, Powell&#x27;s had a location across from Washington Square Mall in Tigard. This was the chain&#x27;s second location. This location was eventually replaced by their Cedar Hills Crossing location.

From 1985 to 2005, Powell&#x27;s operated a travel bookstore in Downtown at Pioneer Courthouse Square.

Powell&#x27;s formerly operated two specialty locations. Powell&#x27;s Technical Books, which contained books on math, science, computing, engineering, construction, and transportation, was located adjacent to their flagship store in Downtown. Powell&#x27;s Books for Home &amp; Garden was located adjacent to the Hawthorne store. Both locations were closed, in 2010 and 2020, respectively, due to decreasing in-person sales of these types of books. Their collections were consolidated into the other locations.

==Labor relations==
In 1991, following some post-holiday lay-offs, some of Powell&#x27;s employees formed an organizing committee, seeking to become part of the Oregon Public Employees Union (OPEU). They succeeded in getting more than 35% of the workers to sign union cards, but because less than 65% of them had done so—the OPEU&#x27;s suggested threshold—they decided not to file for a union certification election. In response to issues identified by the organizing employees, Powell&#x27;s updated and expanded its employee handbook in April 1992 with changes that addressed processes for problem solving and grievances, the probation and termination procedure, and other employee assistance, among other changes.

In September 1998, an email from Powell&#x27;s managers announcing reductions in employee&#x27;s wage increases prompted the creation of a new organizing committee of 26 employees. They chose the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU) because they could charter their own self-governing local union which would include about 350 employees serving in a variety of jobs in all stores and in the Internet, corporate, and shipping departments. By March 1999, they had filed for a union certification election with the National Labor Relations Board. A month later, by a vote of 161–155, ILWU Local 5 became official.

In September 1999, ILWU Local 5 met for the first time with Powell&#x27;s management, to begin the contract bargaining process. After some early successes, 2000 saw a slowdown in the discussions, followed by rallies, filings of unfair labor practices, an unsuccessful decertification campaign, a one-day shutdown of the shipping department (accompanied by the slashing of a van&#x27;s tire), and federal mediation. A three-year contract was finally announced in August 2000.

In February 2011, Powell&#x27;s announced the layoffs of 31 employees, over 7% of its unionized workforce, in “response to the unprecedented, rapidly changing nature of the book industry.&quot; It was the first round of layoffs since the store&#x27;s workers formed a union. A union representative said that Powell&#x27;s had reduced its workforce by about 40 in the prior year through attrition, but felt that layoffs were still necessary because of a decline in sales of new books and a rise in health care costs.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, Powell&#x27;s announced the closing of its five locations and the termination of nearly all employees in mid-March 2020. CEO Emily Powell did not provide the precise number of layoffs in the letter she released on March 17, 2020. However, roughly 85% of the 400 members of the company&#x27;s unionized workforce were terminated. The union noted that only 49 of the more than 100 former employees were union-represented, and the remaining managers were now performing front-line duties typically performed by represented employees. This was in response to a large surge in online orders. In July 2020, Powell&#x27;s announced that the store and kiosk in the Portland International Airport would remain closed permanently.

As Powell&#x27;s gradually began re-hiring staff beginning in April 2021, former employees were forced to apply for open positions as new employees. Powell&#x27;s claimed that their right to return to their old jobs had expired, and an agreement to extend those rights (and maintain previous pay levels) had not been reached between Powell&#x27;s and the union. The majority of hired staff have been previous employees.

Powell&#x27;s employees went on a strike, and the store was closed on Labor Day, September 4, 2023.

<doc id="246442" wikidata="Q10334890" url="?curid=246442" title="Music of Mali">
<text>The music of Mali is, like that of most West African nations, ethnically diverse, but one influence predominates: that of the ancient Mali Empire of the Mandinka (from c. 1230 to c. 1600). Mande people (Bambara, Mandinka, Soninke) make up around 50% of Mali&#x27;s population; other ethnic groups include the Fula (17%), Gur-speakers 12%, Songhai people (6%), Tuareg and Moors (10%).

Salif Keita, a noble-born Malian who became a singer, brought Mande-based Afro-pop to the world, adopting traditional garb and styles. The kora players Sidiki Diabaté and Toumani Diabaté have also achieved some international prominence, as have the late Songhai/Fula guitarist Ali Farka Touré and his successors Afel Bocoum and Vieux Farka Touré, the Tuareg band Tinariwen, the duo Amadou et Mariam and Oumou Sangare. Mory Kanté saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music.

While internationally Malian popular music has been known more for its male artists, there are some exceptions: Fatoumata Diawara, prominent Malian singer and guitarist, has even been nominated to two Grammy Awards. Domestically, since at least the 1980s, female singers such as Kandia Kouyaté are ubiquitous on radio and television, in markets and on street-corner stalls. Fans follow them for the moralizing nature of their lyrics, the perception that they embody tradition and their role as fashion trend-setters.

==National music==
The national anthem of Mali is &quot;Le Mali&quot;. After independence under President Modibo Keita orchestras were state-sponsored and the government created regional orchestras for all seven then regions. From 1962 the orchestras competed in the annual &quot;Semaines Nationale de la Jeunesse&quot; (&quot;National Youth Weeks&quot;) held in Bamako. Keita was ousted by a coup d&#x27;état in 1968 organized by General Moussa Traoré.

Most of Keita&#x27;s support for the arts was cancelled, but the &quot;Semaines Nationale de la Jeunesse&quot; festival, renamed the &quot;Biennale Artistique et Culturelle de la Jeunesse&quot;, was held every 2 years starting in 1970. Notable and influential bands from the period included the first electric dance band, Orchestre Nationale A, and the Ensemble Instrumental National du Mali, comprising 40 traditional musicians from around the country and still in operation today.

Mali&#x27;s second president, Moussa Traoré, discouraged Cuban music in favor of Malian traditional music. The annual arts festivals were held biannually and were known as the Biennales. At the end of the 1980s public support for the Malian government declined and praise-singing&#x27;s support for the status quo and its political leaders became unfashionable. The ethnomusicologist Ryan Skinner has done work on the relationship of music and politics in contemporary Mali.

==Traditional music==
The Malinké, Soninke - Sarakole, Dyula and Bambara peoples form the core of Malian culture, but the region of the Mali Empire has been extended far to the north in present-day Mali, where Tuareg and Maure peoples continue a largely nomadic desert culture. In the east Songhay, Bozo and Dogon people predominate, while the Fula people, formerly nomadic cattle-herders, have settled in patches across the nation and are now as often village and city dwelling, as they are over much of West Africa.

Historical interethnic relations were facilitated by the Niger River and the country&#x27;s vast savannahs. The Bambara, Malinké, Sarakole, Dogon and Songhay are traditionally farmers, the Fula, Maur, and Tuareg herders and the Bozo are fishers. In recent years, this linkage has shifted considerably, as ethnic groups seek diverse, nontraditional sources of income.

===Praise-singers===
Mali&#x27;s literary tradition is largely oral, mediated by &quot;jalis&quot; reciting or singing histories and stories from memory. Amadou Hampâté Bâ, Mali&#x27;s best-known historian, spent much of his life recording the oral traditions of his own Fula teachers as well as those of Bambara and other Mande neighbors. The &quot;jeliw&quot; (sing. &quot;jeli&quot;, fem. &quot;jelimusow&quot;, French &quot;griot&quot;) are a caste of professional musicians and orators, sponsored by noble patrons of the horon class and part of the same caste as craftsmen (&quot;nyamakala&quot;).

They recount genealogical information and family events, laud the deeds of their patron&#x27;s ancestors and praise their patrons themselves, as well as exhorting them to behave morally to ensure the honour of the family name. They also act as dispute mediators. Their position is highly respected and they are often trusted by their patrons with privileged information since the caste system does not allow them to rival nobles. The &quot;jeli&quot; class is endogamous, so certain surnames are held only by &quot;jeliw&quot;: these include &quot;Kouyaté&quot;, &quot;Kamissoko&quot;, &quot;Sissokho&quot;, &quot;Soumano&quot;, &quot;Diabaté&quot; and &quot;Koné&quot;.

Their repertoire includes several ancient songs of which the oldest may be &quot;Lambang&quot;, which praises music. Other songs praise ancient kings and heroes, especially Sunjata Keita (&quot;Sunjata&quot;) and Tutu Jara (&quot;Tut Jara&quot;). Lyrics are composed of a scripted refrain (&quot;donkili&quot;) and an improvised section. Improvised lyrics praise ancestors, and are usually based around a surname. Each surname has an epithet used to glorify its ancient holders, and singers also praise recent and still-living family members. Proverbs are another major component of traditional songs.

These are typically accompanied by a full dance band The common instruments of the Maninka &quot;jeli&quot; ensemble are;

*kora (21-24 string lute-harp, classified by the manner of playing as well as the bridge structure)
*balafon (slat xylophone with small gourd resonators)
*&quot;n&#x27;goni&quot; (4-7 string lute)
*&quot;dununba&quot; (large mallet drum hung from one shoulder and played with a curved stick, accompanied by a bell played with the opposite hand)
*&quot;n&#x27;taman&quot; (hourglass-shaped talking drum or tension drum, large and small variants)
*tabale (tall conga-shaped drum played with long, thin flexible sticks)

===Mande music===
The Mande people, including the Mandinka, Maninka and Bamana, have produced a vibrant popular music scene alongside traditional folk music and that of professional performers called jeliw (sing. &quot;jeli&quot;, French &quot;griot&quot;) The Mande people all claim descent from the legendary warrior Sunjata Keita, who founded the Mande Empire. The language of the Mande is spoken with different dialects in Mali and in parts of surrounding Burkina Faso, Ivory Coast, Guinea-Bissau, Guinea, Senegal and The Gambia.

====Instruments====
The kora is by far the most popular traditional instrument. It is similar to both a harp and a lute and can have between 21 and 25 strings. There are two styles of playing the kora; the western style is found mostly in Senegal and The Gambia, and is more rhythmically complex than the eastern tradition, which is more vocally dominated and found throughout Mali and Guinea. Ngoni (lutes) and balafon (xylophones) are also common.

Mande percussion instruments include the tama, djembe and dunun drums. Jeli Lamine Soumano states: &quot;If you want to learn the bala go to Guinea or Mali. If you want to learn the kora go to Gambia or Mali. If you want to learn the n&#x27;goni you have only to go to Mali.&quot; Each area has developed a speciality instrument while still recognizing that the roots of the related forms come from Mali.

====Djembe====
The traditional djembe ensemble is most commonly attributed to the Maninka and Maraka: it basically consists of one small &quot;dunun&quot; (or &quot;konkoni&quot;) and one djembe soloist. A djembe accompanist who carries a steady pattern throughout the piece has since been added, as have the &quot;jeli dununba&quot; (also referred to as the &quot;kassonke dunun&quot;, names derived from the style of playing, not the physical instruments), and the &quot;n&#x27;tamani&quot; (small talking drum). Many ethnic groups, including the Kassonke, the Djokarame, the Kakalo, the Bobo, the Djoula, the Susu, and others, have historical connections with the djembe.

Most vocalists are female in everyday Mande culture, partially due to the fact that many traditional celebrations revolve around weddings and baptisms, mostly attended by women. Several male and female singers are world-renowned. Although it once was rare for women to play certain instruments, in the 21st century women have broadened their range.

====Bamana====

Bamana-speaking peoples live in central Mali: the language is the most common in Mali. Music is simple and unadorned, and pentatonic. Traditional Bamana music is based on &quot;fileh&quot; (half calabash hand drum), &quot;gita&quot; (calabash bowl with seeds or cowrie shells attached to sound when rotated),the &quot;karignyen&quot; (metal scraper), the &quot;bonkolo&quot; drum (played with one open hand and a thin bamboo stick), the &quot;kunanfa&quot; (large bowl drum with cowhide head, played with the open hands, also &quot;barra&quot; or &quot;chun&quot;), the &quot;gangan&quot; (small, mallet-struck &quot;dunun&quot;, essentially the same as the &quot;konkoni&quot; or &quot;kenkeni&quot; played in the djembe ensemble).

The melodic instruments of the Bamana are typically built around a pentatonic structure. The slat idiophone bala, the 6-string doson n&#x27;goni (hunter&#x27;s lute-harp) and its popular version the 6-12 string kamel n&#x27;goni, the soku (gourd/lizard skin/horse hair violin adopted from the Songhai, soku literally means &quot;horse tail&quot;), and the modern guitar are all instruments commonly found in the Bamana repertoire. Bamana culture is centered around Segou, Sikasso, the Wassalou region and eastern Senegal near the border of Mali&#x27;s Kayes region.

Well-known Bamana performers include Mali&#x27;s first female musical celebrity, Fanta Damba. Damba and other Bamana (and Maninka) musicians in cities like Bamako are known throughout the country for a style of guitar music called Bajourou (named after an 18th-century song glorifying ancient king Tutu Jara). Bamana djembe (&quot;djembe&quot; is a French approximation of the Maninka word, with correct English phonetic approximation: jenbe) drumming has become popular since the mid-1990s throughout the world. It is a traditional instrument of the Bamana people from Mali (This is incorrect, the instrument is a Maninka/Maraka instrument adopted by the Bamana).

====Mandinka====
The Mandinka live in Mali, The Gambia and Senegal and their music is influenced by their neighbors, especially the Wolof and Jola, two of the largest ethnic groups in the Senegambian region. The kora is the most popular instrument.

====Maninka====
Maninka music is the most complex of the three Mande cultures. It is highly ornamented and heptatonic, dominated by female vocalists and dance-oriented rhythms. The ngoni lute is the most popular traditional instrument. Most of the best-known Maninka musicians are from eastern Guinea and play a type of guitar music that adapts balafon-playing (traditional xylophone) to the imported instrument.

Maninka music traces its legend back more than eight centuries to the time of Mansa Sunjata. In the time of Mali Empire and his semi-mythic rivalry with the great sorcerer-ruler Soumaoro Kante Mansa of the Susu people, Sunjata sent his &quot;jeli&quot; Diakouma Doua to learn the secrets of his rival. He finds a magical balafon, the &quot;Soso Bala&quot;, the source of Soumaoro&#x27;s power. When Soumaoro heard Diakouma Doua play on the bala he named him Bala Fasseke Kwate (Master of the bala). The Soso Bala still rests with the descendants of the Kouyate lineage in Niaggasola, Guinea, just across the modern border from Mali.

==Tuareg music==

Tinariwen is thought to be the first Tuareg electric band, active since 1982. They played at the Eden project stage of the Live8 concert in July 2005.

==Fula music==
The Fula use drums, the &quot;hoddu&quot; (same as the &quot;xalam&quot;, a plucked skin-covered lute similar to the banjo) and the &quot;riti&quot; or &quot;riiti&quot; (a one-string bowed instrument, in addition to vocal music. &quot;Zaghareet&quot; or ululation is a popular form of vocal music formed by rapidly moving the tongue sideways and making a sharp, high sound.

The Mansa Sunjata forced some Fulani to settle in various regions where the dominant ethnic groups were Maninka or Bamana. Thus, today, we see a number of people with Fula names (Diallo, Diakite, Sangare, Sidibe) who display Fula cultural characteristics, but only speak the language of the Maninka or Bamana.

==Songhay music==
The Songhay are an ethnolinguistic group that traces its history to the Songhai Empire and inhabits the great bend of the mid River Niger. Vieux Farka Toure, son of Ali Farka Toure, has gained popularity after playing in front of an estimated 1 billion viewers worldwide at the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. He has also been called, &quot;the Hendrix of the Sahara&quot;, since his music explores the affinity between West African song and Afro-American blues guitar.

==20th century popular music==

After World War 2 the guitar became common throughout Africa, partially resulting from the mixing of African, American and British soldiers. Dance bands were popular in Mali, especially the town of Kita&#x27;s orchestra led by Boureima Keita and Afro-Jazz de Ségou, the Rail Band and Pioneer Jazz. Imported dances were popular, especially rumbas, waltzes and Argentine-derived tangos. By the 1960s, however, the influence of Cuban music began to rise. After independence in 1960, Malians saw new opportunities for cultural expression in radio, television and recordings. Cuban music remained popular in Mali throughout the 1960s and remains popular today.

Old dance bands reformed under new names as part of the roots revival of Moussa Traoré. Especially influential bands included Tidiane Koné&#x27;s Rail Band du Buffet Hôtel de la Gare, which launched the careers of future stars Salif Keita and Mory Kanté, and Super Biton de Ségou. Bajourou also became popular, beginning with Fanta Sacko&#x27;s &quot;Fanta Sacko&quot;, the first bajourou LP. Fanta Sacko&#x27;s success set the stage for future jelimusow stars which have been consistently popular in Mali; the mainstream acceptance of female singers is unusual in West Africa, and marks Malian music as unique. In 1975, Fanta Damba became the first jelimuso to tour Europe, as bajourou continued to become mainstream throughout Mali.

Not all bands took part in Traoré&#x27;s roots revival. Les Ambassadeurs du Motel formed in 1971, playing popular songs imported from Senegal, Cuba and France. Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band were the two biggest bands in the country, and a fierce rivalry developed. Salif Keita, perhaps the most popular singer of the time, defected to Les Ambassadeurs in 1972. This was followed by a major concert at which both bands performed as part of the Kibaru (literacy) program. The audience fell into a frenzy of excitement and unity, and the concert is still remembered as one of the defining moments in 1970s Malian music.

The mid-70s also saw the formation of National Badema, a band that played Cuban music and soon added Kassé Mady Diabaté who led a movement to incorporate Maninka praise-singing into Cuban-style music.

===Exodus===
Both the Rail Band and Les Ambassadeurs left for Abidjan at the end of the 1970s due to a poor economic climate in Mali. There, Les Ambassadeurs recorded &quot;Mandjou&quot;, an album which featured their most popular song, &quot;Mandjou&quot;. The song helped make Salif Keita a solo star. Many of the biggest musicians of the period also emigrated—to Abidjan, Dakar, Paris (Salif Keita, Mory Kanté), London, New York or Chicago. Their recordings remained widely available, and these exiles helped bring international attention to Mande music.

===1980s===

Les Ambassadeurs and Rail Band continued recording and performing under a variety of names. In 1982 Salif Keita, who had recorded with Les Ambassadeurs&#x27; Kanté Manfila, left the band and recorded an influential fusion album, &quot;Soro&quot;, with Ibrahima Sylla and French keyboardist Jean-Philippe Rykiel. The album revolutionized Malian pop, eliminating all Cuban traces and incorporating influences from rock and pop. By the middle of the decade, Paris had become the new capital of Mande dance music. Mory Kanté saw major mainstream success with techno-influenced Mande music, becoming a #1 hit on several European charts.

Another roots revival began in the mid-1980s. Guinean singer and kora player Jali Musa Jawara&#x27;s 1983 &quot;Yasimika&quot; is said to have begun this trend, followed by a series of acoustic releases from Kanté Manfila and Kasse Mady. Ali Farka Touré also gained international popularity during this period; his music is less in the jeli tradition and resembles American blues.

===Wassoulou===
The region of Wassoulou, south of Bamako, became the centre of a new wave of dance music also referred to as &quot;wassoulou&quot;. Wassoulou had been developing since at least the mid-70s. Jeliw had never played a large part in the music scene there, and music was more democratic.

The modern form of wassoulou is a combination of hunter&#x27;s songs with &quot;sogoninkun&quot;, a type of elaborate masked dance, and the music is largely based on the &quot;kamalengoni&quot; harp invented in the late 1950s by Allata Brulaye Sidibí. Most singers are women. Oumou Sangaré was the first major wassoulou star; she achieved fame suddenly in 1989 with the release of &quot;Moussoulou&quot;, both within Mali and international. The &quot;soku&quot; is a traditional Wassoulou single string fiddle, corresponding to the Songhai &quot;n&#x27;diaraka&quot; or &quot;njarka&quot;, that doubles the vocal melody.

Since the 1990s, although the majority of Malian popular singers are still jelimusow, wassoulou&#x27;s popularity has continued to grow. Wassoulou music is especially popular among youth. Although western audiences categorise wassoulou performers like Oumou Sangaré as feminists for criticizing practices like polygamy and arranged marriage, within Mali they are not viewed in that light because their messages, when they do not support the status quo of gender roles, are subtly expressed and ambiguously worded, thus keeping them open to a variety of interpretations and avoiding direct censure from Malian society.

=== The impact of the 2012 Coup d’état on Malian Music ===

Music was outlawed in August 2012 by MUJAO as a direct result of the Malian Coup d’état. Most musicians in the North fled the country alongside an estimated 500,000 fellow Malians. An announcement from MUJAO spokesman, Osama Ould Abdel Kader justified the ban stating that “We do not want Satan’s music. In its place there will be Quranic verse. Shari’a demands this”. Islam is a fundamental part of Malian society, which is intertwined with music. Music which was deemed “Un Islamic” has been at the centre of religious life in Mali which arguably connected national and religious identity. Music has been an effective means of socialisation and cohesion in Malian society. Due to the imposition of the Salafist doctrine by Ansar Dine, which was incongruous with traditional Malikite Sunni Islam which makes up most of the majority if the Islamic population in Mali. The doctrine of Mali questioned morality, religion, and everyday life for Malians. The more radical form of Salafism in Mali was seen on May 5, 2012, when Ansar al-Din attacked the tomb of Islamic saints in Timbuktu which was highly condemned by the government who issued a statement on national television describing the act as “unspeakable in the name of Islam”. Islamists proceeded to violently enforce the ban of music on Malian musicians. Ahmed Ag Kaedi, a famed Tuareg guitarist received a threat that he would lose his fingers if he ever played guitar again. Islamists further destroyed his guitars, microphones, and amps by dousing them in petrol and setting them alight.

As a result of the conflict, Malian artists gained widespread attention to its music scene with artists such as the Songhoy Blues, gaining recognition from Julian Casablancas and Iggy Pop. The band as a direct result of the Coup d’etat had to go into exile however they continued to create music. The band collaborated with Iggy pop on the song ‘Sahara’ which featured on their critically acclaimed album ‘Résistance’. Featured on their album “Optimisme’, the song ‘Barre’ provides optimistic lyrics such as ‘Youth! Let’s rise or this change!”. Songhoy Blues Guitarist Aliou Touré stated that the track was about change and how it must be implemented in Mali and that the older generation must give space to the new generation. The Songhoy blues affirmed that the bands’ goal was to spread Malian culture in the form of music and to promote peace and unity.

Referring to North Mali, Vieux Farka Touré, son of the critically acclaimed guitarist Ali Farka Touré, stated “There&#x27;s no music up there anymore. You can&#x27;t switch on a radio or a TV, even at home.&quot; Malian Guitarist Anansy Cissé’s album ‘Anoura’ reached number 1 for May 2021 at the World Music charts for 2021. The album includes issues such as poverty, righteous conduct, and an indirect commentary on Mali’s parlous political situation. Anansy’s music implements Malian culture with the use of traditional instruments such as the ‘ngoni’ and ‘calabash’. In 2018 Cissé was to play at peace festival in his hometown of Diré, Timbuktu when he and his band were held captive and their musical instruments destroyed by an armed gang. The aftermath of 2012 is present in contemporary Malian music as musicians aim for artistic freedom and the promotion of peace and unity in Mali. Vieux Farka Touré has been quoted as saying that “Without music, Mali will cease to exist”. Musicians in Mali continue to create music even in the face of persecution and violence. Mali traditionally has been renowned for its musical roots especially by the “Desert blues” guitarist Ali Farka Touré. Post-2012, the musical prohibition of Mali has indirectly promoted Malian music by its exposure to western mainstream music.

<doc id="246445" wikidata="Q150320" url="?curid=246445" title="Ottokar II of Bohemia">
<text>Ottokar II (; , in Městec Králové, Bohemia – 26 August 1278, in Dürnkrut, Lower Austria), the Iron and Golden King, was a member of the Přemyslid dynasty who reigned as King of Bohemia from 1253 until his death in 1278. He also held the titles of Margrave of Moravia from 1247, Duke of Austria from 1251, and Duke of Styria from 1260, as well as Duke of Carinthia and landgrave of Carniola from 1269.

With Ottokar&#x27;s rule, the Přemyslids reached the peak of their power in the Holy Roman Empire. His expectations of the imperial crown, however, were never fulfilled.

Ottokar was the second son of King Wenceslaus I of Bohemia (reigned 1230–1253). Through his mother, Kunigunde, daughter of Philip of Swabia, he was related to the Holy Roman Emperors of the Hohenstaufen dynasty, which became extinct in the male line upon the execution of King Conradin of Sicily in 1268.

Named after his grandfather King Přemysl Ottokar I, he was originally educated for the role of an ecclesiastical administrator, while his elder brother Vladislaus was designated heir of the Bohemian kingdom. He was possibly educated by the Bohemian chancellor Philip of Spanheim, who would later become a rival for the rule of the Duchy of Carinthia.

==Rise to power==
When his brother Vladislaus died in 1247, Ottokar suddenly became the heir to the Bohemian throne. According to popular oral tradition, he was profoundly shocked by his brother&#x27;s death and did not involve himself in politics, becoming focused on hunting and drinking. His father appointed the new heir as Margrave of Moravia, and Ottokar took up residence in Brno, where he was occupied with the reconstruction of the Moravian lands devastated by Mongol raids of 1242.

In 1248, some discontented nobles who supported Emperor Frederick II enticed Ottokar into leading a rebellion against his father King Wenceslaus. During this rebellion he was elected &quot;the younger King&quot; (&quot;mladší král&quot;) on 31 July 1248 and temporarily expelled his father from Prague Castle. Přemysl Ottokar II held the title of King of Bohemia until November 1249. However, Pope Innocent IV excommunicated Ottokar, whereafter Wenceslaus finally managed to defeat the rebels and imprisoned his son at Přimda Castle. 

Father and son eventually reconciled to assist the king&#x27;s aim of acquiring the neighbouring Duchy of Austria, where the last Babenberg duke, Frederick II had been killed in the 1246 Battle of the Leitha River. King Wenceslaus had initially attempted to acquire Austria by marrying his heir, Vladislaus, to the last duke&#x27;s niece Gertrude of Babenberg. That marriage came to an end after half a year with Vladislaus&#x27;s death in January 1247, and in 1248 Gertrude married the Zähringen margrave Herman VI of Baden. At the death of the last of the Babenberg male line in 1246, Emperor Frederick II seized the duchy as an imperial fief and with it, the sizable Babenberg treasure, installing imperial officials in the Austrian lands and naming his grandson Henry as Duke of Austria and Styria. The Emperor died in late 1250, however, and his grandson was unable to fully establish himself in Austria without his grandfather’s support. 

Wenceslaus released Přemysl Ottokar very soon and in 1251 again made him Margrave of Moravia and installed him, with the approval of the Austrian nobles, as governor of Austria. The same year Ottokar entered Austria, where the estates acclaimed him as Duke. To legitimize his position, Přemysl Ottokar married the late Duke Frederick II&#x27;s sister Margaret of Babenberg, who was his senior by 30 years and the widow of the Hohenstaufen king Henry (VII) of Germany. Their marriage took place on 11 February 1252 at Hainburg.

In 1253, King Wenceslaus died and Přemysl Ottokar succeeded his father as King of Bohemia. After the death of the German King Konrad IV in 1254 while his son Conradin was still a minor, Ottokar also hoped to obtain the Imperial dignity - as King of the Romans - for himself. However, his election bid was unsuccessful and Count William II of Holland, the German anti-king since 1247, was generally recognised.

==Building an empire==

Feeling threatened by Ottokar&#x27;s growing regional power beyond the Leitha River, his cousin King Béla IV of Hungary challenged the young king. Béla formed a loose alliance with the Wittelsbach duke Otto II of Bavaria and tried to install his own son Stephen as Duke of Styria, which since 1192 had been ruled in personal union with Austria under the terms of the Georgenberg Pact of 1186. Papal mediation settled the conflict : the parties agreed that Ottokar would yield large parts of Styria to Béla in exchange for recognition of his right to the remainder of Austria.

Subsequently, King Ottokar II led the two crusade expeditions against the pagan Old Prussians (1254–1255 and 1268).
Königsberg (now Kaliningrad, Russia), founded in 1255 by the Teutonic Order, was named in his honour and later became the capital of the Duchy of Prussia.

After a few years of peace the conflict with Hungary resumed: Ottokar defeated the Hungarians in July 1260 at the Battle of Kressenbrunn, ending years of disputes over Styria with Béla IV. Béla now ceded Styria back to Ottokar, and his claim to those territories was formally recognized by Richard of Cornwall, then king of Germany and nominal ruler of all the German lands. This peace agreement was also sealed by a royal marriage. Ottokar ended his marriage to Margaret and married Béla&#x27;s young granddaughter Kunigunda of Halych, who became the mother of his children. The youngest of them became his only legitimate son, Wenceslaus II.

During the Imperial Imperial &quot;interregnum&quot; of 1250 to 1273, Ottokar could increase his personal influence while Richard of Cornwall and Alfonso of Castile jostled to attain the Imperial dignity. In 1266 he occupied the Egerland in north-west Bohemia, and in 1268 he signed an inheritance treaty with the Sponheim duke Ulrich III of Carinthia, succeeding him in Carinthia, Carniola and the Windic March the next year. In 1272 he also acquired Friuli. His rule was once again contested by the Hungarians on the field of battle. After another victory, Ottokar became the most powerful king within the Empire.

==The path to the final battle==

After Richard of Cornwall died in April 1272 and Pope Gregory X rejected the claims raised by Alfonso of Castile, a new election for the Imperial German throne took place in 1273. However, the Bohemian king again failed to win the Imperial crown, as the electors voted for the &quot;little count&quot; Rudolf of Habsburg, Ottokar&#x27;s last and finally victorious rival.

Přemysl Ottokar refused to acknowledge Rudolf&#x27;s election, and urged the Pope to adopt a similar policy. At a convention of the Imperial Diet at Nuremberg in 1274, Rudolf decreed that all Imperial lands that had changed hands since the death of the last Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II must be returned to the crown. This would have deprived Ottokar not only of the Egerland, but also of the Austrian, Styrian, and Carinthian duchies. In 1275 Rudolf placed Ottokar under the Imperial ban and besieged his Hofburg residence in Vienna, while a rebellion led by the Vítkovci noble Záviš of Falkenstein disrupted the Bohemian lands. This compelled Přemysl Ottokar in November 1276 to sign a new treaty by which he gave up all claims to Austria and the neighboring duchies, retaining for himself only Bohemia and Moravia. Ottokar&#x27;s son Wenceslaus became betrothed to Rudolf&#x27;s daughter Judith. There followed an uneasy peace.

Two years later, the Bohemian king made a last attempt to recover his lost lands by force. Přemysl Ottokar again found allies in Bavaria, Brandenburg and Poland. He collected a large army to meet the forces of Rudolf and his ally King Ladislaus IV of Hungary in the Battle on the Marchfeld on 26 August 1278, where he was defeated and killed. Rudolf had his body laid out in state at the Minorites Church in Vienna. (In 1297 Ottokar&#x27;s mortal remains were finally transferred to St. Vitus Cathedral in Prague.) His 6-year-old son Wenceslaus II succeeded him as King of Bohemia.

==Marriage and children==
On 11 February 1252, Přemysl Ottokar II married Margaret of Austria. Margaret was 26 years older than he, and the couple&#x27;s childless marriage ended with an annulment. On 25 October 1261, Ottokar married Kunigunda of Slavonia. They probably had four children:

*Henry (1262–1263)
*Kunigunde (January 1265 – 27 November 1321), married Boleslaus II of Masovia
*Agnes (5 September 1269 – 17 May 1296), married Rudolf II, Duke of Austria
*Wenceslaus II (17 September 1271 – 21 June 1305)

Ottokar also had two extramarital sons and daughters. The most important was his firstborn, Nicholas. He was never accepted as heir apparent to the Bohemian crown by the sitting pope, but was given the Duchy of Opava as fief in 1269. Other illegitimate children include John, provost of Vyšehrad Chapter.

==Legacy==
Přemysl Ottokar is considered one of the greatest kings of Bohemia, along with Charles IV. He was a founder of many new towns (about 30 — not only in Bohemia, Moravia and Silesia, but also in Austria and Styria) and incorporated many existing settlements through civic charters, giving them new privileges. He was a strong proponent of trade, law and order. Furthermore, he instituted open immigration policies through which skilled German-speaking immigrants settled in major cities throughout his domains. As noted, the historic East Prussian city of Königsberg (&quot;King&#x27;s Mountain&quot;) was named in his honor as a tribute to his support of the Teutonic Knights in their war with the pagan Old Prussians.

As Czech traditional law was different from that of his other domains, many principles introduced during his reign formed core of the Czech law for the following centuries. From his time stems the oldest preserved source of Czech law, Zemské desky, and also the oldest written Czech communal law, recorded in the founding deeds of the respective towns. By supporting the city of Jihlava (German: Iglau) with its mines, he laid foundation of the silver wealth of later Bohemian kings. Privileges of civic charters usually excluded the towns from obedience to the traditional courts held by members of nobility. This can be seen as a step towards equality and a precursor of modern civil law.

In the country, Ottokar&#x27;s introduction of the Law of Emphyteusis into the Czech law is sometimes interpreted as &quot;Germanization&quot;. In fact it was creative, for it freed subjects from feudal obligations, except for rent — and tax, if such was levied. Free selling and leaving of estates could also be bought and soon became common. Thus, Ottokar can be reckoned an early Bohemian ruler who furthered Bohemian rights in medieval times. This change of legal environment in Bohemia was introduced by systematic founding of villages chartered under this law.

He issued also a general privilege to the Jews (1254), which established principles of integration of the Jews into the Czech society until 1848. The Jews were now eligible for various positions, such as servants of crown, thereby being somewhat less subject to discrimination. Instead of being able to claim only the support of individual lords, the Jews could from then on claim support of any royal officer.

Ottokar followed with a systematic policy of strengthening his domains by building fortifications. Besides supporting towns, he built many fortresses himself — Zvíkov Castle, Křivoklát Castle or Bezděz Castle in Bohemia, and the famed Hofburg Palace in Vienna — and also induced his vassals to build castles. A sign of rising strength of Bohemia, it was also a reaction to the Mongol raids of the 13th century (see Béla IV of Hungary). Conflict for the title of ownership to these fortified places built by members of nobility was probably the source of an uprising in 1276, which cost Ottokar the Austrian lands, and two years later (in an attempt for reconquest) his life.

Some of the fortresses built by Ottokar were for centuries the strongest in Bohemia. Ironically, Bezděz Castle served as a prison for his son Wenceslaus II of Bohemia for short time after Ottokar&#x27;s death. The castle housed Bohemian legal records Zemské desky and many spiritual and temporal treasures during the destructive civil strife of the Hussite wars (1419–1434) in Bohemia. It was conquered in 1620, during the 30 Years&#x27; War, but by then it was long deserted, and in that state was defended by rebelling subjects against an Imperial army.

Before his conflict with Rudolf of Habsburg, Ottokar exacted influence over a number of relatives, allies and vassals in Germany, such as the Margraviate of Brandenburg — and spiritual principalities, including the Archbishopric of Salzburg and the Patriarchate of Aquileia. After the death of Konradin in 1268 he was an heir of the House of Hohenstaufen&#x27;s claim to the imperial crown. However, he did not raise this claim, remaining content with informal influence in Germany. In 1267 he was appointed protector of the royal domains (of the Holy Roman Empire) east of the Rhine by the German king, Richard of Cornwall. He held this office till 1273.

Ottokar is a significant figure in history and legend. In the &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; by Dante, Ottokar is seen outside the gates of Purgatory, in amiable companionship with his imperial rival Rudolf. He is also the protagonist of a tragedy by the 19th-century Austrian playwright Franz Grillparzer, titled &quot;König Ottokars Glück und Ende&quot;.

There is a statue dedicated to him.

<doc id="246449" wikidata="Q920450" url="?curid=246449" title="Axiom of infinity">
<text>In axiomatic set theory and the branches of mathematics and philosophy that use it, the axiom of infinity is one of the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory. It guarantees the existence of at least one infinite set, namely a set containing the natural numbers. It was first published by Ernst Zermelo as part of his set theory in 1908.

== Formal statement ==
Using first-order logic primitive symbols, the axiom can be expressed as follows:

formula_1

In English, this sentence means: &quot;there exists a set 
𝐈 such that the empty set is an element of it, and for every element formula_2 of 𝐈, there exists an element formula_3 of 𝐈 such that formula_2 is an element of formula_3, the elements of formula_2 are also elements of formula_3, and nothing else is an element of formula_3.&quot;

This sentence can be abbreviated in set-builder notation as:

formula_9

Some mathematicians may call a set built this way an inductive set.

== Interpretation and consequences ==
This axiom is closely related to the von Neumann construction of the natural numbers in set theory, in which the &quot;successor&quot; of &quot;x&quot; is defined as &quot;x&quot; ∪ {&quot;x&quot;}. If &quot;x&quot; is a set, then it follows from the other axioms of set theory that this successor is also a uniquely defined set. Successors are used to define the usual set-theoretic encoding of the natural numbers. In this encoding, zero is the empty set:
: 0 = {}.
The number 1 is the successor of 0:
: 1 = 0 ∪ {0} = {} ∪ {0} = {0} = .
Likewise, 2 is the successor of 1:
: 2 = 1 ∪ {1} = {0} ∪ {1} = {0, 1} = { {}, },
and so on:
: 3 = {0, 1, 2} = { {}, , {{}, {{}}} };
: 4 = {0, 1, 2, 3} = { {}, {{}}, { {}, {{}} }, { {}, {{}}, {{}, {{}}} } }.

A consequence of this definition is that every natural number is equal to the set of all preceding natural numbers. The count of elements in each set, at the top level, is the same as the represented natural number, and the nesting depth of the most deeply nested empty set {}, including its nesting in the set that represents the number of which it is a part, is also equal to the natural number that the set represents.

This construction forms the natural numbers. However, the other axioms are insufficient to prove the existence of the set of &quot;all&quot; natural numbers, formula_10. Therefore, its existence is taken as an axiom – the axiom of infinity. This axiom asserts that there is a set I that contains 0 and is closed under the operation of taking the successor; that is, for each element of I, the successor of that element is also in I.

Thus the essence of the axiom is:

:There is a set, I, that includes all the natural numbers.

The axiom of infinity is also one of the von Neumann–Bernays–Gödel axioms.

== Extracting the natural numbers from the infinite set ==
The infinite set I is a superset of the natural numbers. To show that the natural numbers themselves constitute a set, the axiom schema of specification can be applied to remove unwanted elements, leaving the set N of all natural numbers. This set is unique by the axiom of extensionality.

To extract the natural numbers, we need a definition of which sets are natural numbers. The natural numbers can be defined in a way that does not assume any axioms except the axiom of extensionality and the axiom of induction—a natural number is either zero or a successor and each of its elements is either zero or a successor of another of its elements. In formal language, the definition says:
: formula_11

Or, even more formally:
: formula_12
:: formula_13

=== Alternative method ===
An alternative method is the following. Let formula_14 be the formula that says &quot;x is inductive&quot;; i.e. formula_15. Informally, what we will do is take the intersection of all inductive sets. More formally, we wish to prove the existence of a unique set formula_16 such that
: formula_17 (*)

For existence, we will use the Axiom of Infinity combined with the Axiom schema of specification. Let formula_18 be an inductive set guaranteed by the Axiom of Infinity. Then we use the axiom schema of specification to define our set formula_19 – i.e. formula_16 is the set of all elements of formula_18, which also happen to be elements of every other inductive set. This clearly satisfies the hypothesis of (*), since if formula_22, then formula_2 is in every inductive set, and if formula_2 is in every inductive set, it is in particular in formula_18, so it must also be in formula_16.

For uniqueness, first note that any set that satisfies (*) is itself inductive, since 0 is in all inductive sets, and if an element formula_2 is in all inductive sets, then by the inductive property so is its successor. Thus if there were another set formula_28 that satisfied (*) we would have that formula_29 since formula_16 is inductive, and formula_31 since formula_28 is inductive. Thus formula_33. Let formula_34 denote this unique element.

This definition is convenient because the principle of induction immediately follows: If formula_35 is inductive, then also formula_36, so that formula_37.

Both these methods produce systems that satisfy the axioms of second-order arithmetic, since the axiom of power set allows us to quantify over the power set of formula_34, as in second-order logic. Thus they both completely determine isomorphic systems, and since they are isomorphic under the identity map, they must in fact be equal.

== An apparently weaker version ==
Some old texts use an apparently weaker version of the axiom of infinity, to wit:
: formula_39

This says that &quot;x&quot; is non-empty and for every element &quot;y&quot; of &quot;x&quot; there is another element &quot;z&quot; of &quot;x&quot; such that &quot;y&quot; is a subset of &quot;z&quot; and &quot;y&quot; is not equal to &quot;z&quot;. This implies that &quot;x&quot; is an infinite set without saying much about its structure. However, with the help of the other axioms of ZF, we can show that this implies the existence of ω. First, if we take the powerset of any infinite set &quot;x&quot;, then that powerset will contain elements that are subsets of &quot;x&quot; of every finite cardinality (among other subsets of &quot;x&quot;). Proving the existence of those finite subsets may require either the axiom of separation or the axioms of pairing and union. Then we can apply the axiom of replacement to replace each element of that powerset of &quot;x&quot; by the initial ordinal number of the same cardinality (or zero, if there is no such ordinal). The result will be an infinite set of ordinals. Then we can apply the axiom of union to that to get an ordinal greater than or equal to ω.

== Independence ==
The axiom of infinity cannot be proved from the other axioms of ZFC if they are consistent. (To see why, note that ZFC formula_40 Con(ZFC − Infinity) and use Gödel&#x27;s Second incompleteness theorem.)

The negation of the axiom of infinity cannot be derived from the rest of the axioms of ZFC, if they are consistent. (This is tantamount to saying that ZFC is consistent, if the other axioms are consistent.) Thus, ZFC implies neither the axiom of infinity nor its negation and is compatible with either.

Indeed, using the von Neumann universe, we can build a model of ZFC − Infinity + (¬Infinity). It is formula_41, the class of hereditarily finite sets, with the inherited membership relation. Note that if the axiom of the empty set is not taken as a part of this system (since it can be derived from ZF + Infinity), then the empty domain also satisfies ZFC − Infinity + ¬Infinity, as all of its axioms are universally quantified, and thus trivially satisfied if no set exists.

The cardinality of the set of natural numbers, aleph null (formula_42), has many of the properties of a large cardinal. Thus the axiom of infinity is sometimes regarded as the first &quot;large cardinal axiom&quot;, and conversely large cardinal axioms are sometimes called{{by whom|date=March 2023}} stronger axioms of infinity.

<text>Golden rice is a variety of rice (&quot;Oryza sativa&quot;) produced through genetic engineering to biosynthesize beta-carotene, a precursor of vitamin A, in the edible parts of the rice. It is intended to produce a fortified food to be grown and consumed in areas with a shortage of dietary vitamin A. Genetically modified golden rice can produce up to 23 times as much beta-carotene as the original golden rice.

Golden rice is generally considered to be safe, with the FDA, Health Canada, International Rice Research Institute and the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation supporting its use. It has been met with significant opposition from some environmental and anti-globalisation activists, alleging risks regarding biodiversity and expressing concerns about unforeseen health effects and socioeconomic impacts. In 2016, 107 Nobel laureates wrote an open letter to Greenpeace and its supporters, asking them to abandon their campaign against genetically modified crops in general and golden rice in particular. In 2024, the Filipino Court of Appeals issued a cease and desist order for the growth of golden rice in the country, citing a lack of scientific certainty regarding its health and environmental impact.

==History==
Research for development of golden rice began as a Rockefeller Foundation initiative in 1982.

In the 1990s, Peter Bramley discovered that a single phytoene desaturase gene (bacterial &quot;CrtI&quot;) can be used to produce lycopene from phytoene in GM tomato, rather than having to introduce multiple carotene desaturases that are normally used by higher plants. Lycopene is then cyclized to beta-carotene by the endogenous cyclase in golden rice. The scientific details of the rice were first published in 2000, the product of an eight-year project by Ingo Potrykus of the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology and Peter Beyer of the University of Freiburg.

The first field trials of golden rice cultivars were conducted by Louisiana State University Agricultural Center in 2004. Additional trials were conducted in the Philippines, Taiwan, and in Bangladesh (2015). Field testing provided an accurate measurement of nutritional value and enabled feeding tests to be performed. Preliminary results from field tests showed field-grown golden rice produces 4 to 5 times more beta-carotene than golden rice grown under greenhouse conditions.

=== Approvals ===
In 2018, Canada and the United States approved golden rice, with Health Canada and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) declaring it safe for consumption. This followed a 2016 decision where the FDA had ruled that the beta-carotene content in golden rice did not provide sufficient amounts of vitamin A for US markets. Health Canada declared that golden rice would not affect allergies, and that the nutrient contents were the same as in common rice varieties, except for the intended high levels of provitamin A.

In 2019, golden rice was approved for use as human food and animal feed or for processing in the Philippines. On 21 July 2021, the Philippines became the first country to officially issue the biosafety permit for commercially propagating vitamin A-infused golden rice. The approval came as the first commercial propagation authorisation of genetically engineered rice in South and Southeast Asia. As a result of the permission, golden rice can be grown on a commercial scale in accordance with the terms and conditions specified by the Philippines government. In April 2023, however, the country&#x27;s Supreme Court ordered the agriculture department to stop commercial propagation of golden rice in relation to a petition filed by MASIPAG (a group of farmers and scientists), who claimed that golden rice poses risk to the health of consumers and to the environment. This Writ of Kalikasan was upheld by the Court of Appeals in April 2024.

=== Rejection ===
On 17 April 2024, the Court of Appeals in the Philippines issued a cease-and-desist order on the commercial propagation of two genetically modified crops, golden rice and Bt eggplant, citing a lack of &quot;full scientific certainty&quot; regarding their health and environmental impact. The decision was in response to a petition filed by groups including Magsasaka at Siyentipiko para sa Pag-unlad Agrikultura (Masipag) and Greenpeace Southeast Asia. The court revoked the biosafety permits previously granted by the government to the University of the Philippines Los Baños (UPLB) and the Philippine Rice Research Institute (PhilRice). This decision was criticized for putting the lives of thousands of children at risk.

== Genetics ==
Golden rice was created by transforming rice with two beta-carotene biosynthesis genes:
# &quot;psy&quot; (phytoene synthase) from daffodil (&quot;Narcissus pseudonarcissus&quot;)
# &quot;crtI&quot; (phytoene desaturase) from the soil bacterium &quot;Erwinia uredovora&quot;

(The insertion of a &quot;lcy&quot; (lycopene cyclase) gene was thought to be needed, but further research showed it is already produced in wild-type rice endosperm.)

The &quot;psy&quot; and &quot;crtI&quot; genes were transferred into the rice nuclear genome and placed under the control of an endosperm-specific promoter, so that they are only expressed in the endosperm. The exogenous &quot;lcy&quot; gene has a transit peptide sequence attached, so it is targeted to the plastid, where geranylgeranyl diphosphate is formed. The bacterial &quot;crtI&quot; gene was an important inclusion to complete the pathway, since it can catalyse multiple steps in the synthesis of carotenoids up to lycopene, while these steps require more than one enzyme in plants. The end product of the engineered pathway is lycopene, but if the plant accumulated lycopene, the rice would be red. Recent analysis has shown the plant&#x27;s endogenous enzymes process the lycopene to beta-carotene in the endosperm, giving the rice the distinctive yellow colour for which it is named. The original golden rice was called SGR1, and under greenhouse conditions it produced 1.6 μg/g of carotenoids.

=== Golden Rice 2 ===
In 2005, a team of researchers at Syngenta produced Golden Rice 2. They combined the phytoene synthase (psy) gene from maize with crtl gene from the original golden rice. Golden Rice 2 produces 23 times more carotenoids than golden rice (up to 37 μg/g) because psy gene of maize is the most effective gene for carotenoid synthesis, and preferentially accumulates beta-carotene (up to 31 μg/g of the 37 μg/g of carotenoids).

==Vitamin A deficiency==


The research that led to golden rice was conducted with the goal of helping children who suffer from vitamin A deficiency (VAD). Estimates show that around 1.02 billion people are severely affected by micronutrient deficiencies globally, with vitamin A to be the most deficient nutrient in the body.

Vitamin A supplementation (VAS) programs began in the 1990s in response to evidence demonstrating the association between VAD and increased childhood mortality. Between 1990 and 2013, more than 40 efficacy studies of VAS in children 6–59 months of age were conducted, and two systematic reviews and meta-analyses have concluded that VA supplements can considerably reduce mortality and morbidity during childhood. As of 2017, more than 80 countries worldwide are implementing universal VAS programs targeted to children 6–59 months of age through semi-annual national campaigns. However, UNICEF and a number of NGOs involved in supplementation note more frequent low-dose supplementation is preferable.

As many children in VAD-affected countries rely on rice as a staple food, genetic modification to make rice produce the vitamin A precursor beta-carotene was seen as a simple and less expensive alternative to ongoing vitamin supplements or an increase in the consumption of green vegetables or animal products. Initial analyses of the potential nutritional benefits of golden rice suggested consumption of golden rice would not eliminate the problems of vitamin A deficiency, but could complement other supplementation. Golden Rice 2 contains sufficient provitamin A to provide the entire dietary requirement via daily consumption of some per day.

Vitamin A deficiency is usually coupled to an unbalanced diet. Since carotenes are hydrophobic, sufficient fat must be present in the diet for golden rice (or most other vitamin A supplements) to alleviate vitamin A deficiency. Moreover, this claim referred to an early cultivar of golden rice; one bowl of the latest version provides 60% of Recommended Dietary Allowance (RDA) for healthy children. The RDA levels advocated in developed countries are far in excess of the amounts needed to prevent blindness.

==Research==
In 2009, results of a clinical trial of golden rice with adult volunteers concluded that &quot;beta-carotene derived from golden rice is effectively converted to vitamin A in humans&quot;. A summary for the American Society for Nutrition suggested that &quot;Golden Rice could probably supply 50% of the RDA of vitamin A from a very modest amountperhaps a cupof rice, if consumed daily. This amount is well within the consumption habits of most young children and their mothers.&quot; Beta-carotene is found and consumed in many nutritious foods eaten around the world, including fruits and vegetables. Beta-carotene in food is a safe source of vitamin A.

A 2012 study showed that the beta-carotene produced by golden rice is as effective as beta-carotene in oil at providing vitamin A to children. The study stated that &quot;recruitment processes and protocol were approved&quot;. However, in 2015, the journal retracted the study, claiming that the researchers had acted unethically when providing Chinese children golden rice without their parents&#x27; consent.

Golden rice improves vitamin A intake and may reduce vitamin A deficiency among women and children. Food derived from golden rice varieties is as safe as food derived from conventional rice varieties.

== Controversy ==
Critics of genetically engineered crops have raised various concerns. An early issue was that golden rice originally did not have sufficient beta-carotene content. This problem was solved by the advancing of GR2E event. The speed at which beta-carotene degrades once the rice is harvested, and how much remains after cooking are contested. However, a 2009 study concluded that beta-carotene from golden rice is effectively converted into vitamin A in humans.

Greenpeace opposes the use of any patented genetically modified organisms in agriculture and opposes the cultivation of golden rice, claiming it will open the door to more widespread use of GMOs. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) has emphasised the non-commercial nature of their project, stating that &quot;None of the companies listed ... are involved in carrying out the research and development activities of IRRI or its partners in Golden Rice, and none of them will receive any royalty or payment from the marketing or selling of golden rice varieties developed by IRRI.&quot;

Vandana Shiva, an Indian anti-GMO activist, argued the problem was not the plant per se, but potential issues with loss of biodiversity. Shiva argued that golden rice proponents were obscuring the limited availability of diverse and nutritionally adequate food. Other groups argued that a varied diet containing foods rich in beta-carotene such as sweet potato, leaf vegetables and fruit would provide children with sufficient vitamin A. However, Keith West of Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has said that foodstuffs containing vitamin A are often unavailable, only available in certain seasons, or are too expensive for poor families to obtain.

In 2008, WHO malnutrition expert Francesco Branca cited the lack of real-world studies and uncertainty about how many people will use golden rice, concluding &quot;giving out supplements, fortifying existing foods with vitamin A, and teaching people to grow carrots or certain leafy vegetables are, for now, more promising ways to fight the problem&quot;. Author Michael Pollan, who had criticized the product in 2001, being unimpressed by the benefits, expressed support for the continuation of the research in 2013.

In 2012, controversy surrounded a study published in &quot;The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition&quot;. The study, involving feeding GM rice to children from 6 to 8 years old in China, was later found to have violated human research rules of both Tufts University and the federal government. Subsequent reviews found no evidence of safety problems with the study, but found issues with insufficient consent forms, unapproved changes to study protocol, and lack of approval from a China-based ethics review board. Additionally, the GM rice used was brought into China illegally.

=== Support ===

The Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation supports the use of genetically modified organisms in agricultural development and supports the International Rice Research Institute in developing golden rice. In June 2016, 107 Nobel laureates wrote an open letter to Greenpeace and its supporters, asking it &quot;to abandon their campaign against &#x27;GMOs&#x27; in general and Golden Rice in particular&quot;.

In May 2018, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the use of golden rice for human consumption, stating: &quot;Based on the information IRRI has presented to FDA, we have no further questions concerning human or animal food derived from GR2E rice at this time.&quot; This marks the fourth national health organisation to approve the use of golden rice in 2018, joining Australia, Canada and New Zealand who issued their assessments earlier in the year.

In December 2021, an opinion piece in &quot;Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America&quot; called on regulators to &quot;allow Golden Rice to save lives&quot;, which the authors say has been delayed due to &quot;fear and false accusations&quot;, leading to estimated 266,000 lives lost per year due to vitamin A deficiency.

=== Protests ===
On August 8, 2013, an experimental plot of golden rice being developed by IRRI and DA-PhilRice in Camarines Sur province of the Philippines was uprooted by protesters. British author Mark Lynas reported in &quot;Slate&quot; that the vandalism was carried out by a group of activists led by &quot;Kilusang Magbubukid ng Pilipinas&quot; (KMP) (literally &#x27;Farmers&#x27; Movement of the Philippines&#x27;).

==Distribution==
A recommendation was made that golden rice be distributed free to subsistence farmers. Free licenses for developing countries were granted quickly due to the positive publicity that golden rice received, particularly in &quot;Time&quot; magazine in July 2000. Monsanto Company was one of the companies to grant free licences for related patents owned by the company. The cutoff between humanitarian and commercial use was set at US$10,000. Therefore, as long as a farmer or subsequent user of golden rice genetics would not make more than $10,000 per year, no royalties would need to be paid. In addition, farmers would be permitted to keep and replant seed.

<text>The maxwell (symbol: Mx) is the CGS (centimetre–gram–second) unit of magnetic flux ().

==History==
The unit name honours James Clerk Maxwell, who presented a unified theory of electromagnetism. The &quot;maxwell&quot; was recommended as a CGS unit at the International Electrical Congress held in 1900 at Paris. This practical unit was previously called a &quot;line&quot;, reflecting Faraday&#x27;s conception of the magnetic field as curved lines of magnetic force, which he designated as &quot;line of magnetic induction&quot;. &quot;Kiloline&quot; (103 line) and &quot;megaline&quot; (106 line) were sometimes used because 1 line was very small relative to the phenomena that it was used to measure.

The &quot;maxwell&quot; was affirmed again unanimously as the unit name for magnetic flux at the Plenary Meeting of the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) in July 1930 at Oslo. In 1933, the Electric and Magnetic Magnitudes and Units committee of the IEC recommended to adopt the metre–kilogram–second (MKS) system (Giorgi system), and the name weber was proposed for the practical unit of magnetic flux (), subject to approval of various national committees, which was achieved in 1935. The &quot;weber&quot; was thus adopted as a practical unit of magnetic flux by the IEC.

==Definition==
The &quot;maxwell&quot; is a non-SI unit.

:1 maxwell = 1 gauss × (centimetre)2

That is, one maxwell is the total flux across a surface of one square centimetre perpendicular to a magnetic field of strength one gauss.

The weber is the related SI unit of magnetic flux, which was defined in 1946. 
: 1 maxwell ≘ 10−4 tesla × (10−2 metre)2 = 10−8 weber

<text>The crab-eating macaque (Macaca fascicularis), also known as the long-tailed macaque or cynomolgus macaque, is a cercopithecine primate native to Southeast Asia. As a synanthropic species, the crab-eating macaque thrives near human settlements and in secondary forest. Crab-eating macaques have developed attributes and roles assigned to them by humans, ranging from cultural perceptions as being smart and adaptive, to being sacred animals, being regarded as vermin and pests, and becoming resources in modern biomedical research. They have been described as a species on the edge, living on the edge of forests, rivers, and seas, at the edge of human settlements, and perhaps on the edge of rapid extinction.

Crab-eating macaques are omnivorous and frugivorous. They live in matrilineal groups ranging from 10 to 85 individuals, with groups exhibiting female philopatry and males emigrating from natal group at puberty. Crab-eating macaques are the only old-world monkey known to use stone tools in their daily foraging, and they engage in a robbing and bartering behavior in some tourist locations.

The crab-eating macaque is the most traded primate species, the most culled primate species, the most persecuted primate species and also the most popular species used in scientific research. Due to these threats, the crab-eating macaque was listed as Endangered on the IUCN Red List in 2022.

==Etymology==
&quot;Macaca&quot; comes from the Portuguese word &quot;macaco&quot;, which was derived from &quot;makaku&quot;, a word in Ibinda, a language of Central Africa (&quot;kaku&quot; means monkey in Ibinda). The specific epithet &quot;fascicularis&quot; is Latin for a small band or stripe. Sir Thomas Raffles, who gave the animal its scientific name in 1821, did not specify what he meant by the use of this word.

In Indonesia and Malaysia, the crab-eating macaque and other macaque species are known generically as &quot;kera.&quot;

The crab-eating macaque has several common names. It is often referred to as the long-tailed macaque due to its tail, which is the length of their body and head combined. The name crab-eating macaque refers to it being seen foraging beaches for crabs. Another common name for &quot;M. fascicularis&quot;, often used in laboratory settings, is the cynomolgus monkey which derives from Greek &quot;Kynamolgoi&quot; meaning &quot;dog milkers&quot;. It has also been suggested that cynomolgus refers to a race of humans with long hair and handsome beards who used dogs for hunting according to Aristophanes of Byzantium, who seemingly derived the etymology of the word &quot;cynomolgus&quot; from the Greek κύων, &quot;cyon&quot; &#x27;dog&#x27; (gen. &quot;cyno-s&quot;) and the verb , &#x27;to milk&#x27; (adj. &quot;amolg-os&quot;), by claiming that they milked female dogs.

== Perceptions and terminology ==
Crab-eating macaques are understood and perceived in many ways: smart, pestiferous, exploited, sacred, vermin, invasive.

In 2000 the crab-eating macaque was placed on the list of 100 most invasive species. For example, they are considered an invasive alien species (IAS) on Mauritius, articles argue for long-tailed macaques spreading seeds of invasive plants, competing with native species like the Mauritian flying fox, and having a detrimental impact on native threatened species. Several authors pointed out that the present evidence indicates that predation on birds by monkeys may have been overestimated. address these accusations and they point out the crab-eating macaques do not prefer primary forest thus it is unlikely that Mauritius macaques were ever a major source of indigenous forest destruction. The primary driver of bird extinction has been habitat destruction by humans. Sussman and Tattersall mention that the Dutch abandoned the island in 1710–12 due to monkeys and rats destroying plantations, they point out that the human population was low at this time and the crab-eating macaques would have had plenty of primary forest to exploit, yet they chose to brave the dangers of raiding plantations. They do not deny that macaques on Mauritius prey on bird eggs and disseminate seeds of exotic plants yet the major loss of species on Mauritius is due to habitat loss caused by humans – macaques are successful because they prefer secondary forest and disturbed habitats. This is significant because the perception of crab-eating macaques being invasive and destructive to &quot;native&quot; biodiversity are used as a justification for use in biomedical research.

&quot;Weed&quot; and &quot;non-weed&quot; species are distinguished based on that species ability to thrive in close proximity and association with human settlements. This label was not intentionally proposed to disparage crab-eating macaques but this term, like pest and invasive, can affect how people perceive this species and can trigger negatives perceptions.

==Taxonomy ==
Previously ten subspecies of &quot;Macaca fascicularis&quot;, but the Philippine long-tailed macaque (&quot;M.f. philippinensis&quot;) is under dispute and is tentatively removed from IUCN Red List assessments, with those individuals included with &quot;M.f. fascicularis&quot;.

* &quot;M.f. fascicularis&quot;, common long-tailed macaque – Indonesia, Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand, Cambodia, Singapore, Vietnam
* &quot;M.f. aurea&quot;, Burmese long-tailed macaque – Myanmar, Laos, western and southern Thailand near Myanmar border
* &quot;M.f. antriceps&quot;, Dark crowned long-tailed macaque – Kram Yai Island, Thailand
* &quot;M.f. condorensis&quot;, Con Song long-tailed macaque – Con Son Island, Hon Ba Island, Vietnam 
* &quot;M.f. karimondjiwae&quot;, Karimunjawa long-tailed macaque – Karimunjawa Islands, Indonesia  
* &quot;M.f. umbrosa&quot;, Nicobar long-tailed macaque – Nicobar islands, India 
* &quot;M.f. fusca&quot;, Simeulue long-tailed macaque – Simeulue Island, Indonesia 
* &quot;M.f. lasiae&quot;, Lasia long-tailed macaque – Lasia island, Indonesia 
* &quot;M.f. tua,&quot; Maratua long-tailed macaque – Maratua Island, Indonesia

&quot;M.f. fascicularis&quot; has the largest range, followed by &quot;M.f. aurea&quot;. The other seven subspecies are isolated on small islands: &quot;M.f. antriceps, M.f. condorensis&quot;, and &quot;M.f. karimondjiwae&quot; all populate small shallow-water fringe-islands; &quot;M.f. umbrosa, M.f. fusca, M.f. lasiae&quot;, and &quot;M.f. tua&quot; all inhabit deep-water fringing-islands.

== Evolution ==
The macaque originated in northeastern Africa some 7 million years ago and spread through most of continental Asia by , and subdivided into four groups (sylvanus, sinica, silenus, and fascicularis). The earliest split in the genus &quot;Macaca&quot; likely occurred ~4.5 mya between an ancestor of the &quot;silenus&quot; group and a &quot;fascicularis&quot;-like ancestor from which non-&quot;silenus&quot; species later evolved. The species of the &quot;fascicularis&quot; group (which include m. fascicularis, m. mulatta, and m. fuscata) share a common ancestor that lived 2.5 mya. It is suggested that &quot;M. fascicularis&quot; are the most plesiomorphic (ancestral) taxon in the &quot;fascicularis&quot; clade, thus it is argued that &quot;M. mulatta&quot; evolved from a &quot;fascicularis&quot;-like ancestor that reached mainland from its homeland in Indonesia around 1mya.

A phylogenetic analysis found evidence that the &quot;fascicularis&quot; group originated from an ancient hybridization between the &quot;sinica&quot; and &quot;silenus&quot; groups ~3.45–3.56 mya, soon after the initial separation of two parent lineages (proto-&quot;sinica&quot; and proto-&quot;silenus&quot;) ~3.86 mya. This divergence and subsequent hybridization occurred during rapid glacial-eustatic fluctuations in the early Pleistocene: high sea levels may have led to the initial separation of proto-&quot;sinica&quot; and proto-&quot;silenus&quot; while the subsequent lowering of sea levels facilitated the secondary contact needed for hybridization.

Known fossils indicate that crab-eating macaques inhabited the Sunda Shelf since at least early Pleistocene, ~1mya. It is likely that crab-eating macaques were introduced to Timor and Flores (both on the east side of the Wallace line), by humans around 4,000–5,000 years ago. Crab-eating macaques are the only species on both sides of the Wallace line.

The possible stages of crab-eating macaque evolution and dispersal were proposed:

* Stage 1: more than , crab-eating dispersed into the Sunda Shelf area. Earliest fossil record of crab-eating macaques was found in Java (this collection included H. erectus and leaf monkey species). They probably reached Java by dry land during a period of glacial advance and low sea levels
* Stage 2: around 160 thousand years ago, dispersal and isolation of progenitors of the strongly differentiated deep water fringing island populations occurred. These include &quot;M.f. umbrosa, M.f. fusca, M.f., tua&quot; [fooden includes &quot;M.f. philippinensis&quot; but their subspecies status is currently under debate]. It is thought that the progenitors of these subspecies reached deep water habitats during the penultimate glacial maximum when sea levels were lower than present. These populations became isolated during the interglacial period around 120 kya
* Stage 3: more than 18 thousand years ago, the differentiation of progenitors of populations of the Indochinese peninsula and northern part of the isthmus of Kra occurred. These subspecies include &quot;M.f. aurea&quot; and &quot;M.f. fascicularis&quot;. These two subspecies became differentiated before the last glacial maximum
* Stage 4: 18 thousand years ago, the dispersal and isolation of progenitors of weakly differentiated deep water fringing island populations occurred (&quot;M. f. fascicularis&quot;)
* Stage 5: less than 18 thousand years ago, the isolation of the progenitors of shallow water fringing island populations and populations in Penida and Lombok (deep water) occurred. These subspecies include &quot;M.f. karimondjawae, M.f. atriceps, M.f. condorensis, M.f. fascicularis&quot; 
* Stage 6: 4.5 thousand years ago, the dispersal and isolation of progenitors of populations in easter lesser Sunda islands (deep water), occurred (&quot;M.f. fascicularis&quot;).

==Characteristics==
Crab-eating macaques are sexually dimorphic, males weigh between 4.7 and 8.3 kg and females weigh 2.5–5.7 kg. The height of an adult male is between 412-648mm and 385-505mm for adult females. Their tails are the length of their head and body combined. Dorsal pelage is generally greyish or brownish with a white underbelly with black and white highlights around the crown and face. The face skin is brownish to pinkish except for the eyelids which are white. Adults are usually bearded on and around the face, except for around the snout and eyes. Older females have the fullest beards, with males&#x27; being more whisker like. Subspecies on islands seem to have black coloration of their pelage and large island, and mainland subspecies are lighter.

== Genetics ==
=== Hybridity ===
Along the northern part of range crab-eating macaques hybridize with rhesus macaques (&quot;M. mulatta&quot;). They also have been known to hybridize with southern pig-tailed macaques (&quot;M&quot;. &quot;nemestrina&quot;). Hybrids also occur across subspecies too. Rhesus and crab-eating macaques hybridize within a contact zone where their ranges overlap, which has been proposed to lie between 15 and 20 degrees north and includes Thailand, Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam. Their offspring are fertile, and they continue to mate which leads to a broad range of admixture proportions. Introgression from rhesus to crab-eating macaque populations extends beyond Indochina and the Kra Isthmus, whereas introgression from crab-eating to rhesus macaques is more restricted. There seems to be a rhesus biased and male biased gene flow between rhesus and crab-eating macaque population which has led to different degrees of genetic admixture in these two species.

==Distribution and habitat==
The crab-eating macaque&#x27;s native range encompasses most of mainland Southeast Asia, through the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, the Maritime Southeast Asia islands of Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, offshore islands, the islands of the Philippines, and the Nicobar Islands in the Bay of Bengal. This primate is a rare example of a terrestrial mammal that violates the Wallace line, being found out across the Lesser Sunda Islands. It lives in a wide variety of habitats, including primary lowland rainforests, disturbed and secondary rainforests, shrubland, and riverine and coastal forests of nipa palm and mangrove. It also easily adjusts to human settlements and is considered sacred at some Hindu temples and on some small islands, but as a pest around farms and villages. Typically, it prefers disturbed habitats and forest periphery.

===Introduction to other regions===
Humans have transported crab-eating macaques to at least five islands: Mauritius, West Papua, Ngeaur, Tinjil Island near Java, and Kabaena Island off of Sulawesi, and to Kowloon Hills of Hong Kong.

There was no indigenous human population on Mauritius. Early exploration of Mauritius by Phoenicians, Swahili people and Arab merchants has been suggested but it was not until the early 16th century that there is hard evidence of human presence on the island, with the Portuguese using it as a refreshing post. The Dutch reached the island in 1598 and attempted a permanent settlement from 1638 to 1658 when they abandoned the island, they resettled again from 1664 to 1710, but abandoned the island again due in part to monkeys and rats destroying plantations. Crab-eating macaques were brought to Mauritius either by the Portuguese or the Dutch in the late 1500s to early 1600s. This founder population likely came from Java, although a mixed origin has been suggested.
From the mid-1980s to mid-1990s the population of crab-eating macaques on Mauritius was estimated at 35,000 to 40,000. The present population is not known but estimates indicate it may be as low as 8,000. This significant decline in the population is likely correlated to the booming Macaque breeding industry on Mauritius. As crab-eating macaques are considered invasive and destructive this justifies their use in biomedical research. On Mauritius macaques are also perceived as sacred, source of tourism, pets, pest, and food.

Crab-eating macaques first appeared on Ngeaur Island, during German rule in the early 20th century. Population size has fluctuated between 800 and 400 individuals. The population losses due to eradication efforts, yet the population has survived despite typhoons and WWII bombing on the island.
In Kowloon Hills there are groups of differing species and their hybrids, where they were released during the 1910s. Rhesus macaques and crab-eating macaques interbred and hybridized. Tibetan macaques were also released but did not interbreed. This location has become a popular tourist attraction.
The immunovaccine porcine zona pellucida (PZP), which causes infertility in females, is currently being tested in Hong Kong to investigate its use as potential population control.

Crab-eating macaques have been in West Papua for around 30 to 100 years, but this population has not expanded, remaining at around 60 to 70 individuals.
There is little known of the population on Kabaena Island, Sulawesi. These crab-eating macaques appear to have distinct morphology, which may suggest that they have been on the island for a long period of time.

Between 1988 and 1994, a total of 520 crab-eating macaques including 58 males and 462 females were released on Tinjil Island for the purpose of starting a natural habitat breeding facility. This may be a sustainable way of supplying monkeys for research, but it is in a legal gray area for trading regulations, using captive bred codes (F, C) rather than wild-caught (W).

=== Population size ===
Because crab-eating macaques are synanthropic, enhancing their visibility to humans, this leads to an overestimation in their population size. Researchers have been raising alarms about crab-eating macaque population decline at least since 1986. Many authors cite a 40% decline in the entire crab-eating macaque population between 1980 and 2006. This comes from a population estimate of 5 million in the 1980s-90s. population estimate of 3 million in 2006. It is unclear how the 3 million estimate was reached.

Using a noninvasive probability model to estimate the maximum population abundance, it was estimated that the current population of crab-eating macaques is 1 million, which reflects a continuous decline in the population – 80% reduction over 35 years. This study used a model that overestimated population so the true decline is probably even greater.
A population Viability Analysis (PVA) for crab-eating macaques revealed that the presence and absence of females in a population are key to its short and long term viability. Anything that negatively targets females is likely to threaten population viability, e.g., harvesting for biomedical research targets females.

==Behavior and ecology==
The crab-eating macaque is highly adaptive, living near and benefiting from humans and environmental modifications.

=== Group size and structure ===
Crab-eating macaques live in matrilineal groups ranging from 10 to 85 members, but most often fall in the range of 35–50. Group size varies greatly, especially between non-provisioned and provisioned groups. Large groups live in secondary forest, savanna and thorn scrub vegetation, and urban habitats and temples. Smaller groups live in primary forest, swamp and mangrove forests. Groups will break into subgroups during the day throughout their range. Composition of groups is multi-male/multi-female but females outnumber males with the sex ratio varying between 1:5–6 and 1:2. Groups exhibit female philopatry with males emigrating from natal group at puberty. Males leave natal group as late juveniles or subadults before the age of seven. On average, adult females and juveniles in groups are related at the level of cousins, whereas adult males are unrelated. Higher relatedness in females is expected due to female philopatry.

=== Social organization ===
Macaque social groups have a clear dominance hierarchy among females, these ranks are stable over a female&#x27;s lifetime and the matriline&#x27;s rank may be sustained for generations. Matrilines creating interesting group dynamics, for example males are dominant to females at the individual level but groups of closely related females can have some level of dominance over males. The dominant male within a group is not often stable, and males probably change troops several times during their life; rank below the dominant male is not consistent or stable either – males show sophisticated decision-making when it comes to transferring dominance.

=== Intergroup encounters ===
Direct encounters between adjacent non-provisioned troops are relatively rare which suggests mutual avoidance.

=== Interspecific behavior ===

Interactions have been reported between crab-eating and southern pig-tailed macaques, Colobinae species, proboscis monkey, gibbons and orangutans. Dusky leaf monkeys, crab-eating macaques and white-thighed surilis form tolerant foraging associations, with juveniles playing together. Crab-eating macaques have also been observed grooming Raffles&#x27; banded langurs in Malaysia.

===Conflict===
Group living in all species is dependent on the tolerance of other group members. In crab-eating macaques, successful social group living requires postconflict resolution. Usually, less dominant individuals lose to a higher-ranking individual when conflict arises. After the conflict has taken place, lower-ranking individuals tend to fear the winner of the conflict to a greater degree. In one study, this was seen in the ability to drink water together. Postconflict observations showed a staggered time between when the dominant individual begins to drink and the subordinate. Long-term studies reveal the gap in drinking time closes as the conflict moves further into the past.

Grooming and support in conflict among primates is considered to be an act of reciprocal altruism. In crab-eating macaques, an experiment was performed in which individuals were given the opportunity to groom one another under three conditions: after being groomed by the other, after grooming the other, and without prior grooming. After grooming took place, the individual that received the grooming was much more likely to support their groomer than one that had not previously groomed that individual.

Crab-eating macaques demonstrate two of the three forms of suggested postconflict behavior. In both captive and wild studies, they demonstrated reconciliation, or an affiliative interaction between former opponents, and redirection, or acting aggressively towards a third individual. Consolation was not seen in any study performed.
When crab-eating macaques are approached by others while foraging, they tend to move away.

Postconflict anxiety has been reported in crab-eating macaques that have acted as the aggressor. After a conflict within a group, the aggressor appears to scratch itself at a higher rate than before the conflict. Though the scratching behavior cannot definitely be termed as an anxious behavior, evidence suggests this is the case. An aggressor&#x27;s scratching decreases significantly after reconciliation. This suggests reconciliation rather than a property of the conflict is the cause of the reduction in scratching behavior. Though these results seem counterintuitive, the anxiety of the aggressor appears to have a basis in the risks of ruining cooperative relationships with the opponent.

===Kin altruism and spite===

In a study, a group of crab-eating macaques was given ownership of a food object. Adult females favored their own offspring by passively, yet preferentially, allowing them to feed on the objects they held. When juveniles were in possession of an object, mothers robbed them and acted aggressively at an increased rate towards their own offspring compared to other juveniles. These observations suggest close proximity influences behavior in ownership, as a mother&#x27;s kin are closer to her on average. When given a nonfood object and two owners, one being a kin and one not, the rival will choose the older individual to attack regardless of kinship. Though the hypothesis remains that mother-juvenile relationships may facilitate social learning of ownership, the combined results clearly point to aggression towards the least-threatening individual.

A study was conducted in which food was given to 11 females. They were then given a choice to share the food with kin or nonkin. The kin altruism hypothesis suggests the mothers would preferentially give food to their own offspring. Yet eight of the 11 females did not discriminate between kin and nonkin. The remaining three did, in fact, give more food to their kin. The results suggest it was not kin selection, but instead spite that fueled feeding kin preferentially. This is due to the observation that food was given to kin for a significantly longer period of time than needed. The benefit to the mother is decreased due to less food availability for herself and the cost remains great for nonkin due to not receiving food. If these results are correct, crab-eating macaques are unique in the animal kingdom, as they appear not only to behave according to the kin selection theory, but also act spitefully toward one another.

===Reproduction===

After a gestation period of 162–193 days, the female gives birth to one infant. The infant&#x27;s weight at birth is about . Infants are born with black fur which will begin to turn to a grey or reddish-brown shade (depending on the subspecies) after about three months of age. This coat may indicate to others the status of the infant, and other group members treat infants with care and rush to their defense when distressed. Immigrant males sometimes kill infants not their own in order to shorten interbirth intervals. High-ranking females will sometimes kidnap the infants of lower-ranking females. These kidnappings can result in the death of the infants, as the other female is usually not lactating. A young juvenile stays mainly with its mother and relatives. As male juveniles get older, they become more peripheral to the group. Here they play together, forming crucial bonds that may help them when they leave their natal group. Males that emigrate with a partner are more successful than those that leave alone. Young females, though, stay with the group and become incorporated into the matriline into which they were born.

Male crab-eating macaques groom females to increase the chance of mating. A female is more likely to engage in sexual activity with a male that has recently groomed her than with one that has not.

Studies have found that the dominant male copulates more than other males in the group. DNA tests indicate that dominant males sire most of the offspring in natural crab-eating macaque troops. Reproductive success in females is also linked to dominance. High ranking females have more offspring over their life-time than  low-ranking females – higher ranking females reproduce at a younger age and their offspring have a higher chance of survival.

===Diet===

Crab-eating macaques are omnivorous frugivores and eat fruits, leaves, flowers, shoots, roots, invertebrates, and small animals in variable quantities. They eat durians, such as &quot;Durio graveolens&quot; and &quot;D. zibethinus&quot;, and are a major seed disperser for the latter species.
They exhibit particularly low tolerance for swallowing seeds, but spit seeds out if larger than . This decision to spit seeds is thought to be adaptive; it avoids filling the monkey&#x27;s stomach with wasteful bulky seeds that cannot be used for energy.
Fruit makes up 40% to over 80% of the diet of wild crab-eating macaques, except in highly provisioned populations or highly disturbed environments.

Crab-eating macaques can become synanthrope, living off human resources when feeding in cropfields on young dry rice, cassava leaves, rubber fruit, taro plants, coconuts, mangos, and other crops, often causing significant losses to local farmers. In villages, towns, and cities, they frequently take food from garbage cans and refuse piles.
In Padangtegal Bali macaque 70% of their diet is provisioned.
They become unafraid of humans in these conditions, which can lead to macaques directly taking food from people, both passively and aggressively.

===Tool use===

Crab-eating macaques are the only old world monkey known to use stone tools in their daily foraging. This is mainly observed in populations along the ocean of Thailand and Myanmar (&quot;M.f. aurea&quot; subspecies). A 1887 report described observations to tool use in a Myanmar population. Over 100 years later the first published report is published in 2007. describing crab-eating macaques in Thailand using ax shaped stones to crack rock oysters, detached gastropods, bivalves, and swimming crabs. Also in Thailand, crab-eating macaques have been observed using tools to crack open oil palm nuts in abandoned plantations, the rapid uptake of oil palm nutcracking shows macaques ability to take advantage of anthropogenic changes and the recent establishment of this behavior indicates the potential for macaques to exhibit cultural tendencies. Unfortunately, human activities can negatively impact tool-using macaques, thus disrupting the persistence of these stone tool use traditions.

Another instance of tool use is washing and rubbing foods, such as sweet potatoes, cassava roots, and papaya leaves, before consumption. Crab-eating macaques either soak these foods in water or rub them through their hands as if to clean them. They also peel the sweet potatoes, using their incisors and canine teeth. Adolescents appear to acquire these behaviors by observational learning of older individuals.

=== Robbing and bartering ===
Robbing and bartering is a behavioral pattern in which free ranging nonhuman primates spontaneously steal an object from a human and then hold onto that object until that or another human solicits an exchange by offering food. This behavior is seen in crab-eating macaques at Uluwatu population in Bali, and is described as a population specific behavioral practice, prevalent and persistent across generations and characterized by marked intergroup variation. Synchronized expression of robbing and bartering was socially influenced and more specifically explained by response facilitation. This result further supports the cultural nature of robbing and bartering.
Token-robbing and token/reward-bartering are cognitively challenging tasks for the Uluwatu macaques that revealed unprecedented economic decision-making processes, i.e., value based token selection and payoff maximization. This spontaneous, population specific, prevalent, cross-generational, learned and socially influenced practice may be the first example of a culturally maintained token economy in free-ranging animals.

==Threats==
The crab-eating macaque has been categorized as Endangered on the IUCN Red List; it is threatened by habitat loss due to rapid land use changes in the landscapes of Southeast Asia and the surging demand by the medical industry during the COVID-19 pandemic. A 2008 review of population trends suggested a need for better monitoring of populations due to increased wild trade and rising levels of human-macaque conflict, which continue to decrease overall population levels despite the species&#x27; wide distribution.

Each subspecies faces differing levels of threats, and too little information is available on some subspecies to assess their conditions. &quot;M. f. umbrosa&quot; is likely of important biological significance and has been recommended as a candidate for protection in the Nicobar Islands, where its small, native population has been seriously fragmented. It is listed as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List. The Philippine long-tailed macaque (&quot;M. f. philippensis&quot;) is listed as near threatened, and &quot;M. f. condorensis&quot; is vulnerable. All other subspecies are listed as data deficient and need further study; although recent work is showing &quot;M. f. aurea&quot; and &quot;M. f. karimondjawae&quot; need increased protection.

=== Trade ===
The crab-eating macaque is one of the most widely traded species of mammal listed on the CITES appendices. The international trade in crab-eating macaques is a multibillion-dollar industry. Crab-eating macaques are sold for up to $20,000 to $24,000, and prices rise when supply reduces. International crab-eating macaque trade does not appear to follow a particular trend but continues to change over time. Although peak exports often correlate with declarations of public health emergences.

In the 1970s, India was the largest supplier of macaques, mostly rhesus macaques, but put a ban on export because when it became apparent that monkeys were used to test military weapons. After this ban, crab-eating macaques began to be used more in biomedical research. Imports of crab-eating macaques in the US and elsewhere began to increase during the worldwide reduction and subsequent ban of rhesus macaque exports from India.

In the 1980s, crab-eating macaques were introduced to China and began being bred in captive facilities. Since then, captive macaques have been favored in biomedical trade.

In the 1990s, four major commercial monkey farms operated by Chinese entrepreneurs began exporting wild caught macaques as captive bred, and monkeys smuggled from Laos and Cambodia were likely part of these transactions.
By 2001, China was exporting significantly more crab-eating macaques than rhesus macaques. Cambodia grants harvest permits to five monkey farms to breed crab-eating macaques for export. Crab-eating macaque harvesting began to accelerate as farms and holding areas were established near protected areas. At this time, international trade of crab-eating macaques expanded rapidly.

Between 2000 and 2018, the US was the largest importer of crab-eating macaques ranging from 41.7 to 70,1% of imports. other major importers: France up to 17.1%, Great Britain up to 15.9%, Japan up to 37.9%, and China up to 33.5%. During this time, China was the largest exporter of crab-eating macaques. Other exporters include Mauritius, Laos, Cambodia, Thailand, Indonesia, and Vietnam. Between 2008 and 2019, at least 450,000 live crab-eating macaques and over 700,000 specimens were traded, with mover 50,000 identified as wild caught.

After 2018, Cambodia became the largest exporter of crab-eating macaques, contributing 59% of all macaques traded in 2019 and 2020. Between 2019 and 2020, Chinese crab-eating macaque trade decreased 96%. China banned animal trade in January 2020 due to concerns of COVID-19, yet this cannot account for the significant decrease in crab-eating macaque exports in 2019, the drivers of this decline are still unclear.

Crab-eating macaques are one of the most commonly internationally traded mammals and are also the most common primates in domestic trade, most often for pets or food. Macaques are regularly sold and kept as pets in China, Vietnam, and Indonesia. In Indonesia pet macaques are usually taken from the wild, which was illegal since 2009, but in 2021 the Indonesian government lifted the harvest ban and reinstated a harvest quota. In Indonesia, crab-eating macaques and pig tailed macaques are the only primates that are not included in the list of protected species. Often infants and juveniles are caught and sold in wildlife markets.

==== Laundering ring ====
In November 2022, following a five-year investigation by the DoJ and US Fish and Wildlife, the DoJ indicted Cambodian government officials and Cambodian owner and staff of Vanny Bio Research Corporation LtD, a macaque breeding center in Cambodia, for their alleged involvement in laundering wild-caught monkeys as captive bred. Charles River Laboratories is also under investigation. Unfortunately, the crab-eating macaques involved in the Cambodian smuggling ring imported by Charles River are in limbo – they are ineligible for research but they cannot go back to the wild either. This laundering is a sophisticated trans-border wildlife trafficking network. Crab-eating macaques are harvested in places like Cambodia, Laos, and Myanmar and then laundered through Vietnam and illegally smuggled to places like China.

==Conservation==

The crab-eating macaque is listed on CITES Appendix II.
Its IUCN Red List status was uplisted in 2020 and again in 2022 from the Least Concern classification in 2008 as a result of declining population resulting from hunting and troublesome interactions with humans, despite its wide range and ability to adapt to different habitats. These interactions include the skyrocketing demand for crab-eating macaques by the medical industry during the COVID-19 pandemic, and the rapid development of the landscape in Southeast Asia. A 2008 review of their populations suggested a need for better monitoring of populations due to increased wild trade and rising levels of human-macaque conflict, which continue to decrease overall population levels despite the species&#x27; wide distribution.

The Long-Tailed Macaque Project and The Macaque Coalition are engaged in conservation of the crab-eating macaque through research and public engagement.

==Relationship with humans==

Crab-eating macaques extensively overlap with humans across their range in Southeast Asia. Consequently, they live together in many locations. Some of these areas are associated with religious sites and local customs, such as the monkey forests and temples of Bali in Indonesia, Thailand, and Cambodia, while other areas are characterized by conflict as a result of habitat loss and competition over food and space. Humans and crab-eating macaques have shared environments since prehistoric times, and both tend to frequent forest and river edge habitats. Crab-eating macaques are occasionally used as a food source for some indigenous forest-dwelling peoples. In Mauritius, they are captured and sold to the pharmaceutical industry, and in Angaur island in Palau, they are sold as pets. Macaques feed on sugarcane and other crops, affecting agriculture and livelihoods, and can be aggressive towards humans. Macaques may carry potentially fatal human diseases, including herpes B virus. In Singapore, they have adapted into the urban environment.

In places like Thailand and Singapore human-macaque conflict task forces have been created to try and resolve some of these conflicts.

===In scientific research===
&quot;M. fascicularis&quot; is also used extensively in medical experiments, in particular those connected with neuroscience and disease. Due to their close physiology, they can share infections with humans. Some cases of concern have been an isolated event of &quot;Reston ebolavirus&quot; found in a captive-bred population shipped to the US from the Philippines, which was later found to be a strain of Ebola that has no known pathological consequences in humans, unlike the African strains. Furthermore, they are a known carrier of monkey B virus (&quot;Herpesvirus simiae&quot;), a virus which has produced disease in some lab workers working mainly with rhesus macaques (&quot;M. mulatta&quot;). &quot;Plasmodium knowlesi&quot;, which causes malaria in &quot;M. fascicularis&quot;, can also infect humans. A few cases have been documented in humans, but for how long humans have been getting infections of this malarial strain is unknown. It is, therefore, not possible to assess if this is a newly emerging health threat, or if just newly discovered due to improved malarial detection techniques. Given the long history of humans and macaques living together in Southeast Asia, it is likely the latter.

Crab-eating macaques are one of the most popular species used for scientific research. Crab-eating macaques are used primarily by the biotechnology and pharmaceutical industry in the evaluation of pharmacokinetics, pharmacodynamics, efficacy, and safety of new biologics and drugs, they are also used in infectious disease, TB, HIV/AIDS, and neuroscience studies.  

The use of crab-eating macaques and other nonhuman primates in experimentation is controversial with critics charging that the experiments are cruel, unnecessary and lead to dubious findings. One of the most well known examples of experiments on crab-eating macaques is the 1981 Silver Spring monkeys case.

In 2014, 21,768 crab-eating macaques were imported in the United States to be used in experimentation.

=== Clones ===
On 24 January 2018, scientists in China reported in the journal &quot;Cell&quot; the creation of two crab-eating macaque clones, named &quot;Zhong Zhong and Hua Hua&quot;, using the complex DNA transfer method that produced &quot;Dolly&quot; the sheep.

===Abuse scandal===

In June 2023, BBC exposed a global online network of sadists who shared videos of baby long-tailed macaques being tortured by caretakers in Indonesia. There were many torture methods, from teasing the primates with baby bottles to killing them in blenders, sawing them in half, or cutting off their tails and limbs. Enthusiasts would pay for the caretakers to film videos torturing the macaques. Investigation has led to some prisons and police searches in both Indonesia and the United States, where many of the torture enthusiasts were located.

<text>The monarch butterfly or simply monarch (Danaus plexippus) is a milkweed butterfly (subfamily Danainae) in the family Nymphalidae. Other common names, depending on region, include milkweed, common tiger, wanderer, and black-veined brown. It is among the most familiar of North American butterflies and an iconic pollinator, although it is not an especially effective pollinator of milkweeds. Its wings feature an easily recognizable black, orange, and white pattern, with a wingspan of . A Müllerian mimic, the viceroy butterfly, is similar in color and pattern, but is markedly smaller and has an extra black stripe across each hindwing.

The eastern North American monarch population is notable for its annual southward late-summer/autumn instinctive migration from the northern and central United States and southern Canada to Florida and Mexico. During the fall migration, monarchs cover thousands of miles, with a corresponding multigenerational return north in spring. The western North American population of monarchs west of the Rocky Mountains often migrates to sites in southern California, but have been found in overwintering Mexican sites, as well. Non-migratory populations are found further south in the Americas, and in parts of Europe, Oceania, and Southeast Asia.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;monarch&quot; is believed to have been given in honor of King William III of England, as the butterfly&#x27;s main color is that of the king&#x27;s secondary title, Prince of Orange. The monarch was originally described by Carl Linnaeus in his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; of 1758 and placed in the genus &quot;Papilio&quot;. In 1780, Jan Krzysztof Kluk used the monarch as the type species for a new genus, &quot;Danaus&quot;. Although works published between at least 1883 and 1944 identified the species as &quot;Anosia plexippus&quot;, &quot;Anosia&quot; was generally considered a subgenus of &quot;Danaus&quot;.

Danaus (Ancient Greek ), a great-grandson of Zeus, was a mythical king in Egypt or Libya, who founded Argos; Plexippus () was one of the 50 sons of Aegyptus, the twin brother of Danaus. In Homeric Greek, his name means &quot;one who urges on horses&quot;, i.e., &quot;rider&quot; or &quot;charioteer&quot;. In the tenth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;, at the bottom of page 467, Linnaeus wrote that the names of the &quot;Danai festivi&quot;, the division of the genus to which &quot;Papilio plexippus&quot; belonged, were derived from the sons of Aegyptus. Linnaeus divided his large genus &quot;Papilio&quot;, containing all known butterfly species, into what we would now call subgenera. The &quot;Danai festivi&quot; formed one of the &quot;subgenera&quot;, containing colorful species, as opposed to the &quot;Danai candidi&quot;, containing species with bright white wings. Linnaeus wrote: &quot;&quot; (English: &quot;The names of the &quot;Danai candidi&quot; have been derived from the daughters of Danaus, those of the &quot;Danai festivi&quot; from the sons of Aegyptus.&quot;).

Robert Michael Pyle suggested &quot;Danaus&quot; is a masculinized version of Danaë (Greek ), Danaus&#x27;s great-great-granddaughter, to whom Zeus came as a shower of gold, which seemed to him a more appropriate source for the name of this butterfly.

== Taxonomy ==
Monarchs belong to the subfamily Danainae of the family Nymphalidae. Danainae was formerly considered a separately family Danaidae. The three species of monarch butterflies are:
* &quot;D. plexippus&quot;, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the species known most commonly as the monarch butterfly of North America. Its range extends worldwide, including Hawaii, Australia, New Zealand, Spain, and the Pacific Islands.
* &quot;D. erippus&quot;, the southern monarch, was described by Pieter Cramer in 1775. This species is found in tropical and subtropical latitudes of South America, mainly in Brazil, Uruguay, Paraguay, Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, and southern Peru. The South American monarch and the North American monarch may have been one species at one time. Some researchers believe the southern monarch separated from the monarch&#x27;s population some two million years ago, at the end of the Pliocene. Sea levels were higher, and the entire Amazonas lowland was a vast expanse of brackish swamp that offered limited butterfly habitat.
* &quot;D. cleophile&quot;, the Jamaican monarch, described by Jean-Baptiste Godart in 1819, ranges from Jamaica to Hispaniola.

Six subspecies and two color morphs of &quot;D. plexippus&quot; have been identified:
* &quot;D. p. plexippus&quot; – nominate subspecies, described by Linnaeus in 1758, is the migratory subspecies known from most of North America.
** &quot;D. p. p.&quot; &quot;form nivosus&quot;, the white monarch commonly found on Oahu, Hawaii, and rarely in other locations.
** &quot;D. p. p.&quot; (as yet unnamed) – a color morph lacking some wing vein markings.
* &quot;D. p. nigrippus&quot; (Richard Haensch, 1909) – South America - as &quot;forma&quot;: &quot;Danais&quot; &quot;archippus&quot; f. &quot;nigrippus&quot;. Hay-Roe et al. in 2007 identified this taxon as a subspecies
* &quot;D. p. megalippe&quot; (Jacob Hübner, [1826]) – nonmigratory subspecies, and is found from Florida and Georgia southwards, throughout the Caribbean and Central America to the Amazon River.
* &quot;D. p. leucogyne&quot; (Arthur G. Butler, 1884) − St. Thomas
* &quot;D. p. portoricensis&quot; Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 − Puerto Rico
* &quot;D. p. tobagi&quot; Austin Hobart Clark, 1941 − Tobago

The population level of the white morph in Oahu is nearing 10%. On other Hawaiian islands, the white morph occurs at a relatively low frequency. White monarchs (&quot;D. p. p.&quot; &quot;form nivosus&quot;) have been found throughout the world, including Australia, New Zealand, Indonesia, and the United States. However, some taxonomists disagree on these classifications.

== Genome ==
The monarch was the first butterfly to have its genome sequenced. The 273-million-base pair draft sequence includes a set of 16,866 protein-coding genes. The genome provides researchers insights into migratory behavior, the circadian clock, juvenile hormone pathways, and microRNAs that are differentially expressed between summer and migratory monarchs. More recently, the genetic basis of monarch migration and warning coloration has been described.

No genetic differentiation exists between the migratory populations of eastern and western North America. Recent research has identified the specific areas in the genome of the monarch that regulate migration. No genetic difference is seen between a migrating and nonmigrating monarch, but the gene is expressed in migrating monarchs, but not expressed in nonmigrating monarchs.

A 2015 publication identified genes from wasp bracoviruses in the genome of the North American monarch leading to articles about monarch butterflies being genetically modified organisms.

== Life cycle ==
Like all Lepidoptera, monarchs undergo complete metamorphosis; their life cycle has four phases: egg, larva, pupa, and adult. Monarchs transition from eggs to adults during warm summer temperatures in as little as 25 days, extending to as many as seven weeks during cool spring conditions. During their development, both larvae and their milkweed hosts are vulnerable to weather extremes, predators, parasites, and diseases; commonly fewer than 10% of monarch eggs and caterpillars survive.

===Egg===

The egg is derived from materials ingested as a larva and from the spermatophores received from males during mating. Female monarchs lay eggs singly, most often on the underside of a young leaf of a milkweed plant during the spring and summer. Females secrete a small amount of glue to attach their eggs directly to the plant. They typically lay 300 to 500 eggs over a two- to five-week period.

Eggs are cream colored or light green, ovate to conical in shape, and about in size. The eggs weigh less than each and have raised ridges that form longitudinally from the point to apex to the base. Although each egg is the mass of the female, she may lay up to her own mass in eggs. Females lay smaller eggs as they age. Larger females lay larger eggs. The number of eggs laid by a female, which may mate several times, can reach 1,180.

Eggs take three to eight days to develop and hatch into larvae or caterpillars. The offspring&#x27;s consumption of milkweed benefits health and helps defend them against predators. Monarchs lay eggs along the southern migration route.

===Larva===
The larva (caterpillar) has five stages (instars), molting at the end of each instar. Instars last about 3 to 5 days, depending on factors such as temperature and food availability.

The first-instar caterpillar that emerges from the egg is pale green or grayish-white, shiny, almost translucent, with a large, black head. It lacks banding coloration or tentacles. The larvae or caterpillar eats its egg case and begins to feed on milkweed in a circular motion, often leaving a characteristic, arc-shaped hole in the leaf. Older first-instar larvae have dark stripes on a greenish background and develop small bumps that later become front tentacles. The first instar is usually between long.

The second-instar larva develops a characteristic pattern of white, yellow, and black transverse bands. The larva has a yellow triangle on the head and two sets of yellow bands around this central triangle. It is no longer translucent and is covered in short setae. Pairs of black tentacles begin to grow, a larger pair on the thorax and a smaller pair on the abdomen. The second instar is usually between and long.
The third-instar larva has more distinct bands and the two pairs of tentacles become longer. Legs on the thorax differentiate into smaller pairs near the head and larger pairs further back. Third-instar larvae usually feed using a cutting motion on leaf edges. The third instar is usually between long. The fourth-instar larva has a different banding pattern. It develops white spots on the prolegs near its back, and is usually between long.
The fifth-instar larva has a more complex banding pattern and white dots on the prolegs, with small front legs very close to the head. Its length ranges from .
The larvae typically chew through a latex vein to relieve the pressure and feed above it. Fifth-instar larvae often chew a notch in the petiole of the leaf they are eating, which relieves the latex pressure and causes the leaf to fall into a vertical position.

As the caterpillar completes its growth, it is long (large specimens can reach ) and wide, and weighs about , compared to the first instar, which is long and wide. Fifth-instar larvae greatly increase in size and weight. They then stop feeding and are often found far from milkweed plants as they seek a site for pupating.A monarch caterpillar can travel up to 10 meters from its milkweed plant to find a safe place to pupate.

In a laboratory setting, the fourth- and fifth-instar caterpillar stages showed aggressive behavior with lower food availability. Attacked caterpillars were found to be attacked when feeding on milkweed leaves, and the caterpillars attacked when foraging for milkweed. This demonstrates the aggressive behavior of monarch caterpillars due to the availability of milkweed.

===Pupa===
To prepare for the pupal or chrysalis stage, the caterpillar chooses a safe place for pupation, where it spins a silk pad on a downward-facing horizontal surface. At this point, it turns around and securely latches on with its last pair of hind legs and hangs upside down, in the form of the letter J. After &quot;J-hanging&quot; for about 12–16 hours, it soon straightens out its body and goes into peristalsis some seconds before its skin splits behind its head. It then sheds its skin over a few minutes, revealing a green chrysalis (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLQmrIUILzc). At first, the chrysalis is long, soft, and somewhat amorphous, but over a few hours, it compacts into its distinct shape – an opaque, pale-green chrysalis with small golden dots near the bottom, and a gold-and-black rim around the dorsal side near the top. At first, its exoskeleton is soft and fragile, but it hardens and becomes more durable within about a day. At this point, it is about long and wide, weighing about . At normal summer temperatures, it matures in 8–15 days (usually 11–12 days). During this pupal stage, the adult butterfly forms inside. A day or so before emerging, the exoskeleton first becomes translucent and the chrysalis more bluish. Finally, within 12 hours or so, it becomes transparent, revealing the black and orange colors of the butterfly inside before it ecloses (emerges).

In 2009, monarchs were reared on the International Space Station, successfully emerging from pupae located in the station&#x27;s Commercial Generic Bioprocessing Apparatus.

===Adult===
The adult emerges from its chrysalis after about two weeks of pupation (video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tQDGizDHVs8 ). The emergent adult hangs upside down for several hours while it pumps fluids and air into its wings, which expand, dry, and stiffen. The butterfly then extends and retracts its wings. Once conditions allow, it flies and feeds on many nectar plants. During the breeding season, adults reach sexual maturity in 4–5 days. However, the migrating generation does not reach maturity until overwintering is complete.
The adult&#x27;s wingspan ranges from . The upper sides of the wings are tawny orange, the veins and margins are black, and two series of small white spots occur in the margins. Monarch forewings also have a few orange spots near their tips. Wing undersides are similar, but the tips of forewings and hindwings are yellow-brown instead of tawny orange and the white spots are larger. The shape and color of the wings change at the beginning of the migration and appear redder and more elongated than later migrants. Wings size and shape differ between migratory and nonmigratory monarchs. Monarchs from eastern North America have larger and more angular forewings than the western population.

In eastern North American populations, overall wing size in the physical dimensions of wings varies. Males tend to have larger wings than females and are typically heavier than females. Both males and females have similar thoracic dimensions. Female monarchs tended to have thicker wings, which are thought to convey greater tensile strength and reduce the likelihood of being damaged during migration. Additionally, females had lower wing loading than males, meaning females require less energy to fly.

Adults are sexually dimorphic. Males are slightly larger than females and have a black spot on a vein on each hindwing. The spots contain scales that produce pheromones that many Lepidoptera use during courtship. Females are often darker than males and have wider veins on their wings. The ends of the abdomens of males and females differ in shape.

The adult thorax has six legs, but like all Nymphalidae, the forelegs are small and held against the body. The butterfly uses only its middle and hind legs when walking and clinging.

Adults typically live for 2–5 weeks during their breeding season. Larvae growing in high densities are smaller, have lower survival, and weigh less as adults compared with those growing in lower densities.

== Vision ==
Physiological experiments suggest that monarch butterflies view the world through a tetrachromatic system. Like humans, their retina contain three types of opsin proteins, expressed in distinct photoreceptor cells, each of which absorbs light at a different wavelength. Unlike humans, one of those types of photoreceptor cells corresponds to a wavelength in the ultraviolet range; the other two correspond to blue and green.

In addition to these three photoreceptor cells in the main retina, monarch butterfly eyes contain orange filtering pigments that filter the light reaching some green-absorbing opsins, thereby making a fourth photoreceptor cell sensitive to longer-wavelength light. The combination of filtered and unfiltered green opsins allows the butterflies to distinguish yellow from orange colors. The ultraviolet opsin protein has also been detected in the dorsal rim region of monarch eyes. One study suggests that this allows the butterflies to detect ultraviolet-polarized skylight to orient themselves with the sun for their long migratory flight.

These butterflies are capable of distinguishing colors based on their wavelength only, and not based on intensity; this phenomenon is termed &quot;true color vision&quot;. This is important for many butterfly behaviors, including seeking nectar for nourishment, choosing a mate, and finding milkweed on which to lay eggs. One study found that floral color is more easily recognized at a distance by butterflies searching for nectar than floral shape. This may be because flowers have highly contrasting colors to the green background of a vegetative landscape. Leaf shape is important for oviposition so that the butterflies can ensure their eggs are laid on milkweed.

Beyond the perception of color, the ability to remember certain colors is essential in the life of monarch butterflies. These insects can easily learn to associate color, and to a lesser extent, shape, with sugary food rewards. When searching for nectar, color is the first cue that draws the insect&#x27;s attention toward a potential food source, and shape is a secondary characteristic that promotes the process. When searching for a place to lay its eggs, the roles of color and shape are switched. Also, a difference may exist between male and female butterflies from other species regarding the ability to learn certain colors; however, no differences are noted between the sexes for monarch butterflies.

==Courtship and mating==
Monarch courtship occurs in two phases. During the aerial phase, a male pursues and often forces a female to the ground. During the ground phase, the butterflies copulate and remain attached for about 30 to 60 minutes. Only 30% of mating attempts end in copulation, suggesting that females can avoid mating, though some have more success than others. During copulation, a male transfers his spermatophore to a female. Along with sperm, the spermatophore provides a female with nutrition, which aids her in laying eggs. An increase in spermatophore size increases the fecundity of female monarchs. Males that produce larger spermatophores also fertilize more females&#x27; eggs.

Females and males typically mate more than once. Females that mate several times lay more eggs. Mating for the overwintering populations occurs in the spring, before dispersion. Mating is less dependent on pheromones than in other species in its genus. Male search and capture strategies may influence copulatory success, and human-induced changes to the habitat can influence monarch mating activity at overwintering sites.

==Distribution and habitat==

The range of the western and eastern populations of &quot;D. p. plexippus&quot; expands and contracts depending upon the season. The range differs between breeding areas, migration routes, and winter roosts. However, no genetic differences between the western and eastern monarch populations exist; reproductive isolation has not led to subspeciation of these populations, as it has elsewhere within the species&#x27; range.

In the Americas, the monarch ranges from southern Canada through northern South America. It is also found in Bermuda, the Cook Islands, Hawaii, Cuba, and other Caribbean islands, the Solomons, New Caledonia, New Zealand, Papua New Guinea, Australia, the Azores, the Canary Islands, Madeira, continental Portugal, Gibraltar, the Philippines, and Morocco. It appears in the UK in some years as an accidental migrant.

Overwintering populations of &quot;D. p. plexippus&quot; are found in Mexico, California, along the Gulf Coast of the United States, year-round in Florida, and in Arizona where the habitat has the specific conditions necessary for survival. On the East Coast of the United States, they have overwintered as far north as Virginia Beach, Virginia. Their wintering habitat typically provides access to streams, plenty of sunlight (enabling body temperatures that allow flight), and appropriate roosting vegetation, and is relatively free of predators.

Overwintering, roosting butterflies have been seen on basswoods, elms, sumacs, locusts, oaks, osage-oranges, mulberries, pecans, willows, cottonwoods, and mesquites. While breeding, monarch habitats can be found in agricultural fields, pasture land, prairie remnants, urban and suburban residential areas, gardens, trees, and roadsides – anywhere there is access to larval host plants.

The eastern monarch migration largely depends upon only three of these species: &quot;Asclepias syriaca&quot;, &quot;A. viridis&quot;, and &quot;A. asperula&quot;. However, &quot;Asclepias curassavica&quot;, or tropical milkweed, is often planted as an ornamental in butterfly gardens. Year-round plantings in the USA are controversial and criticized, as they may cause new overwintering sites along the U.S. Gulf Coast, leading to year-round breeding of monarchs. This is thought to adversely affect migration patterns and to cause a dramatic buildup of the dangerous parasite, &quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot;. New research also has shown that monarch larvae reared on tropical milkweed show reduced migratory development (reproductive diapause), and when migratory adults are exposed to tropical milkweed, it stimulates reproductive tissue growth.

== Adult food sources ==
Although larvae eat only milkweed, adult monarchs feed on the nectar of many plants, including:
* &quot;Apocynum cannabinum&quot; – Indian hemp
* &quot;Asclepias&quot; spp. – milkweed
* &quot;Buddleja davidii&quot; - butterfly-bush 
* &quot;Cirsium&quot; sp. – thistle
* &quot;Daucus carota&quot; – wild carrot
* &quot;Dipsacus sylvestris&quot; – teasel
* &quot;Echinacea&quot; sp. – coneflower
* &quot;Erigeron canadensis&quot; – horseweed
* &quot;Eupatorium maculatum&quot; – spotted Joe-Pye weed
* &quot;Eupatorium perfoliatum&quot; – common boneset
* &quot;Hesperis matronalis&quot; – dame&#x27;s rocket
* &quot;Liatris&quot; sp. – blazing stars
* &quot;Medicago sativa&quot; – alfalfa
* &quot;Solidago&quot; sp. – goldenrod
* &quot;Symphyotrichum&quot; sp. – New World aster
* &quot;Syringa vulgaris&quot; – lilac
* &quot;Trifolium pratense&quot; – red clover
* &quot;Vernonia altissima&quot; – tall ironweed
Monarchs obtain moisture and minerals from damp soil and wet gravel, a behavior known as mud-puddling. The monarch has also been noticed puddling at an oil stain on the pavement.

== Flight and migration ==

In North America, monarchs migrate both north and south on an annual basis, making long-distance journeys that are fraught with risks. This is a multi-generational migration, with individual monarchs only making part of the full journey. The population east of the Rocky Mountains attempts to migrate to the sanctuaries of the Mariposa Monarca Biosphere Reserve in the Mexican state of Michoacán and parts of Florida. The western population tries to reach destinations in various coastal sites in central and southern California. The populations east of the Rocky Mountains, which mostly overwinter in central Mexico, may return the following spring as far north as Texas and Oklahoma before producing offspring to carry the journey northward. The second, third, and fourth generations return to their northern locations in the United States and Canada later in the spring and far into the summer.

Captive-raised monarchs appear capable of migrating to overwintering sites in Mexico, though they have a much lower migratory success rate than do wild monarchs (see section on captive-rearing below). Monarch overwintering sites have been discovered recently in Arizona. Monarchs from the eastern US generally migrate longer distances than monarchs from the western US.

Since the 1800s, monarchs have spread globally, and there are now many non-migratory populations.

Flight speeds of adults are around .

== Interactions with predators ==
In both caterpillar and butterfly forms, monarchs are aposematic, warding off predators with a bright display of contrasting colors to warn potential predators of their undesirable taste and poisonous characteristics. One monarch researcher emphasizes that predation on eggs, larvae, or adults is natural since monarchs are part of the food chain, thus people should not take steps to kill predators of monarchs.

Larvae feed exclusively on milkweed and consume protective cardiac glycosides. Toxin levels in the &quot;Asclepias&quot; species vary. Not all monarchs are unpalatable, but exhibit Batesian or automimics. Cardiac glycoside levels are higher in the abdomen and wings. Some predators can differentiate between these parts and consume the most palatable ones.

Butterfly weed (&quot;A. tuberosa&quot;) lacks significant amounts of cardiac glycosides (cardenolides) but instead contains other types of toxic glycosides, including pregnanes. This difference may reduce the toxicity of monarchs whose larvae feed on that milkweed species and affect the butterfly&#x27;s breeding choices, as a naturalist and others have reported that egg-laying monarchs do not favor the plant. Some other milkweeds have similar characteristics.

=== Types of predators ===
While monarchs have a wide range of natural predators, none of these is suspected of causing harm to the overall population, or are the cause of the long-term declines in winter colony sizes.

Several species of birds have acquired methods that allow them to ingest monarchs without experiencing the ill effects associated with the cardiac glycosides (cardenolides). The black-backed oriole can eat the monarch through an exaptation of its feeding behavior that gives it the ability to identify cardenolides by taste and reject them. The black-headed grosbeak, though, has developed an insensitivity to secondary plant poisons that allows it to ingest monarchs without vomiting. As a result, these orioles and grosbeaks periodically have high levels of cardenolides in their bodies, and they are forced to go on periods of reduced monarch consumption. This cycle effectively reduces potential predation of monarchs by 50% indicating that monarch aposematism has a legitimate purpose. The black-headed grosbeak has also evolved resistance mutations in the molecular target of the heart poisons, the sodium pump. The specific mutations that evolved in one of the grosbeak&#x27;s four copies of the sodium pump gene are the same as those found in some rodents that have also evolved to resist cardiac glycosides. Known bird predators include brown thrashers, grackles, robins, cardinals, sparrows, scrub jays, and pinyon jays.

The monarch&#x27;s white morph appeared in Oahu after the 1965–1966 introduction of two bulbul bird species, &quot;Pycnonotus cafer&quot; and &quot;Pycnonotus jocosus&quot;. These are now the most common avian insectivores in Hawaii, and probably the only ones that eat insects as large as monarchs. Although Hawaiian monarchs have low cardiac glycoside levels, the birds may also be tolerant of that toxin. The two species hunt the larvae and some pupae from the branches and undersides of leaves in milkweed bushes. The bulbuls also eat resting and ovipositing adults, but rarely flying ones. Because of its color, the white morph has a higher survival rate than the orange one. This is either because of apostatic selection (i.e., the birds have learned the orange monarchs can be eaten), because of camouflage (the white morph matches the white pubescence of milkweed or the patches of light shining through foliage), or because the white morph does not fit the bird&#x27;s search image of a typical monarch, so is thus avoided.
Some mice, particularly the black-eared mouse (&quot;Peromyscus melanotis&quot;), are, like all rodents, able to tolerate large doses of cardenolides and can eat monarchs. Overwintering adults become less toxic over time making them more vulnerable to predators. In Mexico, about 14% of the overwintering monarchs are eaten by birds and mice and black-eared mice can eat up to 40 monarchs per night.

In North America, eggs and first-instar larvae of the monarch are eaten by larvae and adults of the introduced Asian lady beetle (&quot;Harmonia axyridis&quot;). The Chinese mantis (&quot;Tenodera sinensis&quot;) will consume the larvae once the gut is removed thus avoiding cardenolides. Predatory wasps commonly consume larvae. Many Hemipteran bugs including predatory stink bugs in the subfamily Asopinae and assassin bugs in family Reduviidae eat monarchs. Larvae can sometimes avoid predation by dropping from the plant or by jerking their bodies.

Parasitoids, including tachinid flies and braconid wasps develop inside the monarch larvae eventually killing them and emerging from the larvae or pupa. Non-insect parasites and infectious diseases (pathogens) also kill monarchs.

=== Aposematism ===

Monarchs are toxic and foul-tasting because of the presence of cardenolides in their bodies, which the caterpillars ingest as they feed on milkweed. Monarchs and other cardenolide-resistant insects rely on a resistant form of the Na+/ K+-ATPase enzyme to tolerate significantly higher concentrations of cardenolides than nonresistant species. By ingesting a large number of plants in the genus &quot;Asclepias&quot;, primarily milkweed, monarch caterpillars can sequester cardiac glycosides, or more specifically cardenolides, which are steroids that act in heart-arresting ways similar to digitalis. It has been found that monarchs can sequester cardenolides most effectively from plants of intermediate cardenolide content rather than those of high or low content. Three mutations that evolved in the monarch&#x27;s Na+/ K+-ATPase were found to be sufficient together to confer resistance to dietary cardiac glycosides. This was tested by swapping these mutations into the same gene in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila melanogaster&quot; using CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing. These fruit flies-turned monarch flies were completely resistant to dietary ouabain, a cardiac glycoside found in Apocynaceae, and even sequestered some through metamorphosis, like the monarch.

Different milkweed species have variable effects on parasite growth, virulence, and transmission. One species, &quot;Asclepias curassavica&quot;, appears to reduce the symptoms of &quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot; (OE) infection. The two possible explanations for this include that it promotes overall monarch health to boost the monarch&#x27;s immune system or that chemicals from the plant have a direct negative effect on the OE parasites. &quot;A. curassavica&quot; does not cure or prevent the infection with OE; it merely allows infected monarchs to live longer, and this would allow infected monarchs to spread the OE spores for longer periods. For the average home butterfly garden, this scenario only adds more OE to the local population.

After the caterpillar becomes a butterfly, the toxins shift to different body parts. Since many birds attack the butterfly&#x27;s wings, having three times the cardiac glycosides in the wings leaves predators with a foul taste and may prevent them from ever ingesting the butterfly&#x27;s body. To combat predators that remove the wings only to ingest the abdomen, monarchs keep the most potent cardiac glycosides in their abdomens.

=== Mimicry ===
Monarchs share the defense of noxious taste with the similar-appearing viceroy butterfly in what is perhaps one of the most well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to be an example of Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.

== Human interaction ==
The monarch is the state insect of Alabama, Idaho, Illinois, Minnesota, Texas, Vermont, and West Virginia. Legislation was introduced to make it the national insect of the United States, but this failed in 1989 and again in 1991.

Homeowners are increasingly establishing butterfly gardens; monarchs can be attracted by cultivating a butterfly garden with specific milkweed species and nectar plants. Efforts are underway to establish these monarch waystations.
A 2012 IMAX film, &quot;Flight of the Butterflies&quot;, describes the story of the Urquharts, Brugger, and Trail to document the then-unknown monarch migration to Mexican overwintering areas.

Sanctuaries and reserves have been created at overwintering locations in Mexico and California to limit habitat destruction. These sites can generate significant tourism revenue. However, with less tourism, monarch butterflies may exhibit higher survival rates, as butterflies in tourist isolated areas have shown increases in protein content, immune response and oxidative defense.

Organizations and individuals participate in tagging programs. Tagging information is used to study migration patterns.

The 2012 novel by Barbara Kingsolver, &quot;Flight Behavior&quot;, deals with the fictional appearance of a large population in the Appalachians.

=== Captive rearing ===

Humans interact with monarchs when rearing them in captivity, which has become increasingly popular. However, risks occur in this controversial activity. On one hand, captive rearing has many positive aspects. Monarchs are bred in schools and used for butterfly releases at hospices, memorial events, and weddings. Memorial services for the September 11 attacks include the release of captive-bred monarchs. Monarchs are used in schools and nature centers for educational purposes. Many homeowners raise monarchs in captivity as a hobby and for educational purposes. Monarchs born in captivity are friendly to humans and are a pleasure to play with (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3brZuY-yWh0). They may need to be taught how to feed on artificial food (https://www.youtube.com/shorts/5KH3NLDaRvU).

On the other hand, this practice becomes problematic when monarchs are &quot;mass-reared&quot;. Stories in the &quot;Huffington Post&quot; in 2015 and &quot;Discover&quot; magazine in 2016 have summarized the controversy around this issue.

The frequent media reports of monarch declines have encouraged many homeowners to attempt to rear as many monarchs as possible in their homes and then release them to the wild to &quot;boost the monarch population&quot;. Some individuals, such as one in Linn County, Iowa, have reared thousands of monarchs at the same time.

Some monarch scientists do not condone the practice of rearing &quot;large&quot; numbers of monarchs in captivity for release into the wild because of the risks of genetic issues and disease spread. One of the biggest concerns of mass rearing is the potential for spreading the monarch parasite &quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot; into the wild. This parasite can rapidly build up in captive monarchs, especially if they are housed together. The parasite spores can quickly contaminate all housing equipment so all subsequent monarchs reared in the same containers become infected. One researcher stated that rearing more than 100 monarchs constitutes &quot;mass rearing&quot; and should not be done.

In addition to the disease risks, researchers believe these captive-reared monarchs are not as fit as wild ones, owing to the unnatural conditions in which they are raised. Homeowners often raise monarchs in plastic or glass containers in their kitchens, basements, porches, etc., and under artificial lighting and controlled temperatures. Such conditions would not mimic what the monarchs are used to in the wild and may result in adults unsuited for the realities of their wild existence. In support of this, a recent study by a citizen scientist found that captive-reared monarchs have a lower migration success rate than wild monarchs.

A 2019 study shed light on captive-reared monarchs&#x27; fitness by testing reared and wild monarchs on a tethered flight apparatus that assessed navigational ability. In that study, monarchs that were reared to adulthood in artificial conditions showed a reduction in navigational ability. This happened even with monarchs brought into captivity from the wild for a few days. A few captive-reared monarchs did show proper navigation. This study revealed the fragility of monarch development; if the conditions are not suitable, their ability to properly migrate could be impaired. The same study also examined the genetics of a collection of reared monarchs purchased from a butterfly breeder and found they were dramatically different from wild monarchs, so much so that the lead author described them as &quot;franken-monarchs&quot;.

An unpublished study in 2019 compared the behavior of captive-reared versus wild monarch larvae. The study showed that reared larvae exhibited more defensive behavior than wild larvae. The reason for this is unknown, but it could relate to reared larvae being frequently handled and/or disturbed.

== Threats ==
In February 2015, the United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) reported a study that showed that nearly a billion monarchs had vanished from the butterfly&#x27;s overwintering sites since 1990. The agency attributed the monarch&#x27;s decline partly to a loss of milkweed caused by herbicides that farmers and homeowners had used.

A 2017 report included mention of the new ethanol-in-gasoline standards as reducing the amount of acreage left fallow in the U.S. midwest: &quot;Federal policies such as the Ethanol Fuel Standards (Renewable Fuel Standard), crop insurance, and waning Farm Bill support for CRP reduce support for integrated agro-ecological landscapes capable of sustaining both food production and monarch habitat, principally because these policies promote row crops over mixed, herbaceous perennial vegetation.&quot; 

In 2018, a study correlated monarch butterfly decline to the fact that 95% of corn and soybean crops grown in the United States used genetically modified seeds resistant to the herbicide glyphosate. This meant that instead of spreading the herbicide only before seed planting, farmers could spread the herbicide a second time by air when weeds had begun to challenge the crops. Air application of the herbicide meant that the unplowed margins between the field and road that previously supported milkweed and a range of nectar flowers were now greatly diminished. 

By 2024, the USFWS calculated that the eastern butterflies had declined by approximately 80 percent since the 1980s. The western population was more imperiled, declining by 95 percent. According to the USFWS, the species faces a host of threats, including the loss and degradation of its breeding, migratory, and overwintering habitats, exposure to insecticides, and the growing impacts of climate change. 

===Western monarch populations===

Based on a 2014 20-year comparison, the overwintering numbers west of the Rocky Mountains have dropped more than 50% since 1997 and the overwintering numbers east of the Rockies have declined by more than 90% since 1995. According to the Xerces Society, the monarch population in California decreased by 86% in 2018, going from millions to tens of thousands of butterflies.

The society&#x27;s annual 2020–2021 winter count showed a significant decline in the California population. One Pacific Grove site had no monarch butterflies. A primary explanation for this was the destruction of the butterfly&#x27;s milkweed habitats. This particular population is believed to comprise less than 2000 individuals, .

===Eastern and midwestern monarch populations===

A 2016 study attributed the previous decade&#x27;s 90% decline in overwintering numbers of the eastern monarch population primarily to the loss of breeding habitat and milkweed. The publication&#x27;s authors stated that an 11%–57% probability existed that this population will become &quot;quasi-extinct&quot; over the next 20 years (i.e. unable to sustain a stable population). Other threats identified in the study include climate change, insecticides, and disease.

Chip Taylor, the director of Monarch Watch at the University of Kansas, stated in 2013 that the Midwest milkweed habitat &quot;is virtually gone&quot; with 120–150million acres lost. However, he predicted in 2024 that in the immediate future and perhaps into the next two decades, the eastern monarch butterfly population will be relatively stable because it is not presently on a continuous downward trend as it was from 2000-2006. To help fight the population decline, Monarch Watch encourages the planting of &quot;Monarch Waystations&quot;.

====Habitat loss due to herbicide use and genetically modified crops====
Declines in milkweed abundance and monarch populations between 1999 and 2010 are correlated with the adoption of herbicide-tolerant genetically modified (GM) corn and soybeans, which now constitute 89% and 94% of these crops, respectively, in the U.S. GM corn and soybeans are resistant to the effect of the herbicide glyphosate. Some conservationists attribute the disappearance of milkweed to agricultural practices in the Midwest, where GM seeds are bred to resist herbicides that farmers use to kill unwanted plants that grow near their rows of food crops.

In 2015, the Natural Resources Defense Council filed a suit against the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The Council argued that the agency ignored warnings about the dangers of glyphosate usage for monarchs. However, a 2018 study has suggested that the decline in milkweed predates the arrival of GM crops.

====Losses during migration====
 Eastern and midwestern monarchs are experiencing problems reaching Mexico. Many monarch researchers have cited recent evidence from long-term citizen science data that shows that the number of breeding (adult) monarchs has not declined in the last two decades.

The lack of long-term declines in the numbers of breeding and migratory monarchs, yet the clear declines in overwintering numbers, suggests a growing disconnect exists between these life stages. One researcher has suggested that mortality from car strikes constitutes an increasing threat to migrating monarchs. A study of road mortality in northern Mexico, published in 2019, showed very high mortality from just two &quot;hotspots&quot; each year, amounting to 200,000 monarchs killed.

====Importance of overwintering habitat====

The area of Mexican forest to which eastern and midwestern monarchs migrate reached its lowest level in two decades in 2013. The decline was expected to increase during the 2013–2014 season. Mexican environmental authorities continue to monitor illegal logging of the oyamel fir trees; however, organized criminals have repeatedly crushed such efforts in the name of very short-term financial gain. The oyamel is a major species of evergreen on which the overwintering butterflies spend a significant time during their winter diapause, or suspended development.

A 2014 study acknowledged that while &quot;the protection of overwintering habitat has no doubt gone a long way towards conserving monarchs that breed throughout eastern North America&quot;, their research indicates that habitat loss on breeding grounds in the United States is the main cause of recent and projected population declines.

Western monarch populations have rebounded slightly since 2014 with the Western Monarch Thanksgiving Count tallying 335,479 monarchs in 2022. The population still has much to go for a full recovery.

=== Parasites ===

Parasites include the tachinid flies &quot;Sturmia convergens&quot;, &quot;Compsilura concinnata&quot;, &quot;Madremyia saundersii&quot;, &quot;Hyphantrophaga virilis&quot;, &quot;Nilea erecta&quot;, and &quot;Lespesia archippivora&quot;. &quot;Lespesia&quot;-parasitized butterfly larvae suspend, but die prior to pupation. The fly&#x27;s maggot lowers to the ground, forms a brown puparium, and then emerges as an adult.

Pteromalid wasps, specifically &quot;Pteromalus cassotis&quot;, parasitize monarch pupae. These wasps lay their eggs in the pupae while the chrysalis is still soft. Up to 400 adults emerge from the chrysalis after 14–20 days, killing the monarch.

The bacterium &quot;Micrococcus flacidifex danai&quot; also infects larvae. Just before pupation, the larvae migrate to a horizontal surface and die a few hours later, attached only by one pair of prolegs, with the thorax and abdomen hanging limp. The body turns black shortly thereafter. The bacterium &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot; has no invasive powers, but causes secondary infections in weakened insects. It is a common cause of death in laboratory-reared insects.

&quot;Ophryocystis elektroscirrha&quot; is another parasite of the monarch. It infects the subcutaneous tissues and propagates by spores formed during the pupal stage. The spores are found over all of the bodies of infected butterflies, with the greatest number on the abdomen. These spores are passed, from female to caterpillar, when spores rub off during egg laying and are then ingested by caterpillars. Severely infected individuals are weak, unable to expand their wings, or unable to eclose, and have shortened lifespans, but parasite levels vary in populations. This is not the case in laboratory rearing, where after a few generations, all individuals can be infected.

Infection with &quot;O. elektroscirrha&quot; creates an effect known as culling, whereby migrating monarchs that are infected are less likely to complete the migration. This results in overwintering populations with lower parasite loads. Owners of commercial butterfly-breeding operations claim that they take steps to control this parasite in their practices, although this claim is doubted by many scientists who study monarchs.

=== Confusion of host plants ===
The black swallow-wort (&quot;Cynanchum louiseae&quot;) and pale swallow-wort (&quot;Cynanchum rossicum&quot;) plants are problematic for monarchs in North America. Monarchs lay their eggs on these relatives of native vining milkweed (&quot;Cynanchum laeve&quot;) because they produce stimuli similar to milkweed. Once the eggs hatch, the caterpillars are poisoned by the toxicity of this invasive plant from Europe.

=== Climate ===
Climate variations during the fall and summer affect butterfly reproduction. Rainfall and freezing temperatures affect milkweed growth. Omar Vidal, director general of WWF-Mexico, said, &quot;The monarch&#x27;s lifecycle depends on the climatic conditions in the places where they breed. Eggs, larvae, and pupae develop more quickly in milder conditions. Temperatures above can be lethal for larvae, and eggs dry out in hot, arid conditions, causing a drastic decrease in hatch rate.&quot; If a monarch&#x27;s body temperatures is below , a monarch cannot fly. To warm up, they sit in the sun or rapidly shiver their wings to warm themselves.

Climate change may dramatically affect the monarch migration. A study from 2015 examined the impact of warming temperatures on the breeding range of the monarch and showed that in the next 50 years, the monarch host plant will expand its range further north into Canada and that the monarchs will follow this. While this will expand the breeding locations of the monarch, it will also have the effect of increasing the distance that monarchs must travel to reach their overwintering destination in Mexico, which could result in greater mortality during the migration.

Milkweeds grown at increased temperatures have been shown to contain higher cardenolide concentrations, making the leaves too toxic for the monarch caterpillars. However, these increased concentrations are likely in response to increased insect herbivory, which is also caused by the increased temperatures. Whether increased temperatures make milkweed too toxic for monarch caterpillars when other factors are not present is unknown. Additionally, milkweed grown at carbon dioxide levels of 760 parts per million was found to produce a different mix of the toxic cardenolides, one of which was less effective against monarch parasites.

== Conservation status ==

The number of monarchs overwintering in Mexico has shown a long-term downward trend. Since 1995, coverage numbers have been as high as during the winter of 1996–1997, but on average about . Coverage declined to its lowest point to date () during the winter of 2013–2014, but rebounded to in 2015–2016. The average population of monarchs in 2016 was estimated at 200million. Historically, on average there are 300million monarchs. The 2016 increase was attributed to favorable breeding conditions in the summer of 2015. However, coverage declined by 27% to during the winter of 2016–2017. Some believe this was because of a storm that had occurred during March 2016 in the monarchs&#x27; previous overwintering season. However, this seems unlikely since most current research shows that the overwintering colony sizes do not predict the size of the next summer breeding population.

On July 20, 2022, the International Union for Conservation of Nature added the migratory monarch butterfly (the subspecies common in North America) to its red list as an endangered species. However, a petition in 2023 resulted in its status being changed to &quot;vulnerable&quot;.

The monarch butterfly is not listed under the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora or protected specifically under U.S. domestic laws.

On August 14, 2014, the Center for Biological Diversity and the Center for Food Safety petitioned the United States Secretary of the Interior through the USFWS to protect the &quot;Danaus plexippus plexippus&quot; subspecies of the monarch butterfly as a threatened species under the Endangered Species Act. On December 31, 2014, the USFWS initiated a review of the status of the butterfly to determine whether the petitioned action was warranted, with a due date for the submission of information of March 3, 2015, later extended to December 15, 2020.

On December 17, 2020, the USFWS published in the Federal Register a notice in which it stated that adding the butterfly to the list of threatened and endangered species was &quot;warranted-but-precluded&quot; because budgetary limitations required it to devote its resources to species with higher priorities for listing. The notice stated that the USFWS had 422 12-month petition findings for domestic species yet to be initiated and completed at the beginning of Fiscal Year 2020 (October 1, 2019). 

On June 27, 2023, the USFWS published in the Federal Register a Notice of Proposed Rulemaking for a rule that would give the butterfly a listing priority number (LPN) of 8 for adding its species to that list. LPNs range from 1 to 12 (the lower the LPN, the higher the listing priority). 

On December 12, 2024, the USFWS published in the Federal Register a proposed rule that would list the butterfly as a threatened species and would designate the butterfly&#x27;s critical habitat per the provisions of the Endangered Species Act. The USFWS estimated in the proposed rule that the probability of extinction in the foreseeable future (60 years) is 56-74 percent for the eastern monarch migratory population and 99 percent for the western migratory population. The proposed rule designated seven areas near California&#x27;s Pacific coast as &quot;critical habitat units&quot; for monarch butterflies. The USFWS will accept comments on the proposed rule until March 12, 2025. 

In Ontario, Canada, the monarch butterfly is listed as a species of special concern. In fall 2016, the Committee on the Status of Endangered Wildlife in Canada proposed that the monarch be listed as endangered in Canada, as opposed to its current listing as a &quot;species of concern&quot; in that country. This move, once enacted, would protect critical monarch habitat in Canada, such as major fall accumulation areas in southern Ontario, but it would also have implications for citizen scientists who work with monarchs and for classroom activities. If the monarch were federally protected in Canada, these activities could be limited, or require federal permits.

In Nova Scotia, the monarch is listed as endangered at the provincial level, . This decision (as well as the Ontario decision) is based on a presumption that the overwintering colony declines in Mexico create declines in the breeding range in Canada. Two recent studies have been conducted examining long-term trends in monarch abundance in Canada, using either butterfly atlas records or citizen science butterfly surveys, and neither shows evidence of a population decline in Canada.

==Conservation efforts==

Although the numbers of breeding monarchs in eastern North America have not decreased, reports of declining numbers of overwintering butterflies have inspired efforts to conserve the species.

===Federal actions===
On June 20, 2014, President Barack Obama issued a presidential memorandum entitled &quot;Creating a Federal Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators&quot;. The memorandum established a Pollinator Health Task Force, to be co-chaired by the Secretary of Agriculture and the Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency, and stated:

The U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) publishes sets of landscape performance requirements in its P100 documents, which mandate standards for the GSA&#x27;s Public Buildings Service. Beginning in March 2015, those performance requirements and their updates have included four primary aspects for planting designs that are intended to provide adequate on-site foraging opportunities for targeted pollinators. The targeted pollinators include bees, butterflies, and other beneficial insects.

In May 2015, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a &quot;National Strategy to Promote the Health of Honey Bees and Other Pollinators&quot;. The strategy laid out federal actions to achieve three goals, two of which were:

Many of the priority projects that the National Strategy identified focused on the I-35 corridor, which extends for from Texas to Minnesota. The area through which that highway travels provides spring and summer breeding habitats in the United States&#x27; key monarch migration corridor.

The Task Force simultaneously issued a &quot;Pollinator Research Action Plan&quot;. The Plan outlined five main action areas, covered in ten subject-specific chapters. The action areas were: (1) Setting a Baseline; (2) Assessing Environmental Stressors; (3) Restoring Habitat; (4) Understanding and Supporting Stakeholders; (5) Curating and Sharing Knowledge.

In May 2015, the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and the U.S. Department of the Interior (USDI) issued a 52-page document entitled &quot;Pollinator-Friendly Best Management Practices for Federal Lands&quot;. The document consolidated general information about the practices and procedures to use when considering pollinator needs in project development and management of Federal lands that are managed for native diversity and multiple uses. The document also contained a series of actions to be considered when determining those lands best suited for restoration and rehabilitation of monarch habitat. These included an assurance that native wildflowers are available, diverse, and abundant to provide nectar for monarchs and an assurance that milkweed species that female monarchs prefer for egg laying are available or will be planted. The document identified those milkweed species for each of seven regions within the United States.

On December 4, 2015, President Obama signed into law the Fixing America&#x27;s Surface Transportation (FAST) Act (Pub. L. 114-94). The FAST Act placed a new emphasis on efforts to support pollinators. To accomplish this, the FAST Act amended Title 23 (Highways) of the United States Code. The amendment directed the United States Secretary of Transportation when carrying out programs under that title in conjunction with willing states, to:

# encourage integrated vegetation management practices on roadsides and other transportation rights-of-way, including reduced mowing; and
# encourage the development of habitat and forage for Monarch butterflies, other native pollinators, and honey bees through plantings of native forbs and grasses, including noninvasive, native milkweed species that can serve as migratory way stations for butterflies and facilitate migrations of other pollinators.

The FAST Act also stated that activities to establish and improve pollinator habitat, forage, and migratory way stations may be eligible for Federal funding if related to transportation projects funded under Title 23.

In February 2016, the Office of the U.S. Secretary of the Interior issued a memorandum containing an attachment entitled &quot;Strategy for Implementing Pollinator-Friendly Landscaping Design and Maintenance at Department of the Interior Sites&quot;. The attachment described specific actions that would address the incorporation of pollinator-friendly landscaping design and maintenance into new construction and major renovations, existing sites, contracts, leases and occupancy agreements, and education/outreach programs. The memorandum containing the attachment directed the USDI&#x27;s bureaus and offices (which include the Fish and Wildlife Service, the Bureau of Land Management, and the National Park Service) to implement those actions to the extent that they are appropriate for and consistent with, the mission and function of the facility/site.

In June 2016, the Pollinator Health Task Force issued a &quot;Pollinator Partnership Action Plan&quot;. That Plan provided examples of past, ongoing, and possible future collaborations between the federal government and non-federal institutions to support pollinator health under each of the National Strategy&#x27;s goals.

The USDA&#x27;s Farm Service Agency helps increase U.S. populations of the monarch butterfly and other pollinators through its Conservation Reserve Program&#x27;s State Acres for Wildlife Enhancement (SAFE) Initiative. The SAFE Initiative provides an annual rental payment to farmers who agree to remove environmentally sensitive land from agricultural production and plant species that will improve environmental health and quality. Among other things, the initiative encourages landowners to establish wetlands, grasses, and trees to create habitats for species that the FWS has designated to be threatened or endangered.

As part of its targeted monarch butterfly effort, the USDA&#x27;s Natural Resources Conservation Service (NRCS) works with agricultural producers in the midwest and southern Great Plains to combat the decline of monarch butterflies by planting milkweed and other nectar-rich plants on private lands. The NRCS also provides region-specific guides and plant lists that support populations of monarch butterflies and other pollinators in the Greater Appalachian Mountains Region, the Midwest Region, the Northern and Southern Great Plains, and the Western Coastal Plain.

===Other actions===
Agriculture companies and other organizations are being asked to set aside unsprayed areas to allow monarchs to breed. In addition, national and local initiatives are underway to help establish and maintain pollinator habitats along corridors containing power lines and roadways. The Federal Highway Administration, state governments, and local jurisdictions are encouraging highway departments and others to limit their use of herbicides, to reduce mowing, to help milkweed to grow, and to encourage monarchs to reproduce within their right-of-ways.

====National Cooperative Highway Research Program report====
In 2020, the National Cooperative Highway Research Program (NCHRP) of the Transportation Research Board issued a 208-page report that described a project that had examined the potential for roadway corridors to provide habitat for monarch butterflies. A part of the project developed tools for roadside managers to optimize potential habitats for monarch butterflies in their road rights-of-way.

Such efforts are controversial because the risk of butterfly mortality near roads is high. Several studies have shown that motor vehicles kill millions of monarchs and other butterflies annually. Also, some evidence indicates that monarch larvae living near roads experience physiological stress conditions, as evidenced by elevations in their heart rate.

The NCHRP report acknowledged that, among other hazards, roads present a danger of traffic collisions for monarchs, stating that these effects appear to be more concentrated in particular funnel areas during migration. Nevertheless, the report concluded:

===Butterfly gardening and monarch waystations===
The practice of butterfly gardening and creating &quot;monarch waystations&quot; is commonly thought to increase the populations of butterflies. Efforts to restore falling monarch populations by establishing butterfly gardens and monarch waystations require particular attention to the butterfly&#x27;s food preferences and population cycles, as well to the conditions needed to propagate and maintain milkweed.

For example, in the Washington, DC, area and elsewhere in the northeastern and midwestern United States, common milkweed (&quot;Asclepias syriaca&quot;) is among the most important food plants for monarch caterpillars. A U.S. Department of Agriculture conservation planting guide for Maryland recommends that, for optimum wildlife and pollinator habitat in mesic sites (especially for monarchs), a seed mix should contain 6.0% &quot;A. syriaca&quot; by weight and 2.0% by seed.

However, monarchs prefer to lay eggs on &quot;A. syriaca&quot; when its foliage is soft and fresh. Because monarch reproduction peaks in those areas during the late summer when milkweed foliage is old and tough, &quot;A. syriaca&quot; needs to be mowed or cut back in June through August to ensure that it will be regrowing rapidly when monarch reproduction reaches its peak. Similar conditions exist for showy milkweed (&quot;A. speciosa&quot;) in Michigan and for green antelope horn milkweed (&quot;A. viridis&quot;), where it grows in the Southern Great Plains and the Western United States. Further, the seeds of &quot;A. syriaca&quot; and some other milkweeds need periods of cold treatment (cold stratification) before they will germinate.

To protect seeds from washing away during heavy rains and from seed-eating birds, one can cover the seeds with a light fabric or with an layer of straw mulch. However, mulch acts as an insulator. Thicker layers of mulch can prevent seeds from germinating if they prevent soil temperatures from rising enough when winter ends. Further, few seedlings can push through a thick layer of mulch.

Although monarch caterpillars will feed on butterfly weed (&quot;A. tuberosa&quot;) in butterfly gardens, it is typically not a heavily used host plant for the species. The plant has rough leaves and a layer of trichomes, which may inhibit oviposition or decrease a female&#x27;s ability to sense leaf chemicals. The plant&#x27;s low levels of cardenolides may also deter monarchs from laying eggs on the plant.
 While &quot;A. tuberosa&quot; colorful flowers provide nectar for many adult butterflies, the plant may be less suitable for use in butterfly gardens and monarch waystations than are other milkweed species.

Breeding monarchs prefer to lay eggs on swamp milkweed (&quot;A. incarnata&quot;) in the midwest. However, &quot;A. incarnata&quot; is an early successional plant that usually grows at the margins of wetlands and in seasonally flooded areas. The plant is slow to spread via seeds, does not spread by runners, and tends to disappear as vegetative densities increase and habitats dry out. Although &quot;A. incarnata&quot; plants can survive up to 20 years, most live only two to five years in gardens. The species is not shade-tolerant and is not a good vegetative competitor.

<text>Samuel Ervin Beam (born July 26, 1974), better known by his stage name Iron &amp; Wine, is an American singer-songwriter. He has released six studio albums, several EPs and singles, as well as a few download-only releases, which include a live album (a recording of his 2005 Bonnaroo performance). He occasionally tours with a full band.

The name &quot;Iron &amp; Wine&quot; is taken from a dietary supplement named &quot;Beef, Iron &amp; Wine&quot; that he found in a general store while shooting a film.

==Early life==
Beam was raised in Chapin, South Carolina, where his father worked in land management and his mother was a schoolteacher. When he was a child, his family took regular trips to the country, where his grandfather ran a farm. He attended Seven Oaks Elementary School and Chapin High School. While home from college, he was a waiter at California Dreaming restaurant in Columbia. Beam earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in art from Virginia Commonwealth University in Richmond, Virginia. He specialized in painting before graduating from the Florida State University Film School with an MFA degree. Before the release of the first Iron &amp; Wine album, Beam&#x27;s main source of income was as a professor of film and cinematography at the University of Miami and Miami International University of Art &amp; Design. He had been writing songs for over seven years before a friend lent him a four-track recorder. He began making demos and gave one to his friend Michael Bridwell, brother of Band of Horses lead singer, Ben Bridwell. Michael handed it to Mike McGonigal, editor of Yeti magazine, who chose &quot;Dead Man&#x27;s Will&quot;, later released on &quot;In the Reins&quot;, for inclusion on one of his magazine&#x27;s compilation CDs. Beam later came to the attention of Sub Pop Records co-owner, Jonathan Poneman, who contacted Beam to propose a deal.

==Musical career==
Beam released his first Iron &amp; Wine album, &quot;The Creek Drank the Cradle&quot;, on the Sub Pop label in 2002. Beam wrote, performed, recorded and produced the album in his home studio. Featuring acoustic guitars, banjo, and slide guitar, the album&#x27;s music has been compared to that of Nick Drake, Simon and Garfunkel, Elliott Smith, Neil Young and John Fahey.

Also in 2002, Beam recorded a cover of The Postal Service&#x27;s then-unreleased song &quot;Such Great Heights&quot;. Rather than being included on an Iron &amp; Wine release, the track was initially included as a b-side of the original version by The Postal Service. It was later included on the B-sides and rarities album, &quot;Around the Well&quot;. He then followed up on his debut album in 2003 with &quot;The Sea &amp; The Rhythm&quot;, an EP containing other home-recorded tracks with a similar style to the songs on the debut.

Beam&#x27;s second full-length album, &quot;Our Endless Numbered Days&quot; (2004), was recorded in a professional studio with a significant increase in fidelity. Produced in Chicago by Brian Deck, the focus was still on acoustic material, but the inclusion of other band members gave rise to a slightly different sound. That same year, he recorded the song &quot;The Trapeze Swinger&quot; for the film &quot;In Good Company&quot;, and had his version of &quot;Such Great Heights&quot; featured in an advertisement for M&amp;M&#x27;s and in the film and soundtrack for &quot;Garden State&quot;. This version was later used in a 2006 Ask.com advertisement, and eventually released as a single in 2006 backed with recordings of &quot;The Trapeze Swinger&quot; and &quot;Naked as We Came&quot; made for Radio Vienna.
In February 2005, he released an EP entitled &quot;Woman King&quot;, which expanded on the sounds of his previous LP with the addition of electric guitars. Each track features a spiritual female figure, and had Biblical overtones.

The EP &quot;In the Reins&quot;, a collaboration with the Arizona-based rock band Calexico, was released in September 2005. Beam wrote all of the EP&#x27;s songs years earlier, but Calexico added their trademark fusion of southwestern rock, traditional Mexican music and jazz to the songs&#x27; arrangements. Several tracks, most notably, &quot;Burn That Broken Bed&quot;, feature brass instruments, a first for Beam&#x27;s music.

The third full-length Iron &amp; Wine album, entitled &quot;The Shepherd&#x27;s Dog&quot;, was released September 25, 2007. This album was voted one of the ten best of 2007 by &quot;Paste&quot; magazine. Contributors included Joey Burns and Paul Niehaus of Calexico, as well as jazz musicians Matt Lux and Bob Burger. When asked to describe the album to &quot;The Independent&quot;, Beam remarked that &quot;it&#x27;s not a political propaganda record, but it&#x27;s definitely inspired by political confusion, because I was really taken aback when Bush got reelected.&quot;

Beam has released most of his music on iTunes, including several exclusive EPs. The &quot;Iron &amp; Wine iTunes Exclusive EP&quot; features unreleased studio recordings, including a Stereolab cover and two tracks which had previously only appeared on vinyl. The &quot;Live Session (iTunes Exclusive)&quot; features Beam and his sister, Sarah Beam, performing a number of tracks from his albums, as well as a cover of New Order&#x27;s &quot;Love Vigilantes&quot;. Sarah Beam has contributed backing vocals on many of Beam&#x27;s studio recordings.

Beam&#x27;s music has appeared in television series such as &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, &quot;The L Word&quot; and &quot;House M.D.&quot; &quot;Flightless Bird, American Mouth&quot; was used in the film &quot;Twilight&quot;. The song was specifically chosen for the film&#x27;s prom scene by Kristen Stewart, the female lead, and appears on the film&#x27;s soundtrack.

The B-sides and rarities album &quot;Around the Well&quot; was released in 2009. Iron &amp; Wine also contributed the song &quot;Stolen Houses (Die)&quot; to the AIDS benefit album &quot;Dark Was the Night&quot; produced by the Red Hot Organization.

On November 26, 2010, Iron &amp; Wine released a special edition &quot;Record Store Day Black Friday&quot; 12&quot; vinyl and CD single called, &quot;Walking Far From Home&quot; for independent record stores.

&quot;Kiss Each Other Clean&quot;, Iron &amp; Wine&#x27;s fourth full-length album, was released on January 25, 2011, on Warner Bros. Records in North America and 4AD for the rest of the world. With this album, Beam blended his earlier styles with a stronger pop influence.

&quot;Ghost on Ghost&quot;, Iron &amp; Wine&#x27;s fifth studio album, was released in April 2013 on Nonesuch Records in North America and 4AD for the rest of the world. &quot;Ghost on Ghost&quot; marked a further exploration into the pop sounds of &quot;Kiss Each Other Clean&quot; while also exhibiting jazz and R&amp;B influences, with jazz drummer Brian Blade contributing to the album. In January 2014, recording during the polar vortex in Chicago, Beam and his regular collaborator Brian Deck co-produced eight of the ten songs on Chadwick Stokes&#x27; 2015 album &quot;The Horse Comanche&quot;. Beam contributed the Iron &amp; Wine band to the sessions and sang backing vocals.

Iron &amp; Wine released two albums in 2015. &quot;Archive Series: Volume 1&quot;, released in February, featured unreleased songs recorded during the same period as &quot;The Creek Drank the Cradle&quot;. A covers album, &quot;Sing Into My Mouth&quot;, recorded with Band of Horses singer Ben Bridwell, was released in July. &quot;Love Letter for Fire&quot;, an album of duets with American singer-songwriter Jesca Hoop, was released in 2016 on Sub Pop. Produced, recorded, and mixed by Tucker Martine, the album also featured contributions from Wilco&#x27;s Glenn Kotche, Rob Burger, Eyvind Kang, Sebastian Steinberg, and Edward Rankin-Parker.

In August 2017, Iron &amp; Wine&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Beast Epic&quot; was released through Sub Pop Records. The record saw Beam strip back the production and array of instruments from previous records to return to more simple and melodic song structures.

On March 21, 2019, Calexico and Iron &amp; Wine announced &quot;Years to Burn&quot;, their first collaboration album. It was released on June 14, 2019, via Sub Pop.

&quot;Live at Third Man Records&quot; was released in 2019, after being recorded on August 31, 2017.

In 2024, Iron &amp; Wine released their seventh studio album, Light Verse and a cover of American Football&#x27;s &quot;Never Meant&quot;.

==Personal life==
Beam, his wife Kim, and their five daughters live in Durham, North Carolina. He was raised in the Bible belt as a Christian, but is now an agnostic: &quot;That was a confusing time for me, but I don&#x27;t miss being misled. I&#x27;m not an atheist. There&#x27;s an undeniable unseen world that some people call God and think they know more about than other people. I try not to get hung up on the names.&quot;

In 2011, a portrait of Beam was painted by British artist Joe Simpson. The painting was exhibited around the UK, including in a solo exhibition at The Royal Albert Hall.

<doc id="246474" wikidata="Q312122" url="?curid=246474" title="Stan (song)">
<text>&quot;Stan&quot; is a song by American rapper Eminem, with vocals sampled from the opening lines of British singer Dido&#x27;s song &quot;Thank You&quot;. It was released on November 20, 2000, as the third single from Eminem&#x27;s third album, &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP&quot; (2000). &quot;Stan&quot; peaked at number 51 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Outside of the United States, &quot;Stan&quot; topped the charts in twelve countries, including the United Kingdom, Germany, Australia, and Ireland.

The 45 King–produced track uses a slightly modified break from &quot;Thank You&quot; as its base sample; both songs were released as singles in late 2000. Retrospectively, &quot;Stan&quot; has been called one of Eminem&#x27;s best songs, and is considered one of his signature songs alongside &quot;The Real Slim Shady&quot; and &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;. In 2003, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine ranked &quot;Stan&quot; 296th on its list of The 500 Greatest Songs of All Time, rising to 223rd in a 2021 updated list. The song was also listed 15th on VH1″s list of the greatest hip-hop songs of all time and named in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame&#x27;s 500 Songs that Shaped Rock and Roll.

The song was nominated for multiple awards, including Best Song at the MTV Europe Music Awards, Video of the Year, Best Rap Video, Best Direction, and Best Cinematography at the MTV Video Music Awards. It won Best International Artist Video at the MuchMusic Video Awards. In April 2011, &quot;Complex&quot; magazine put together a list of the 100 greatest Eminem songs and ranked &quot;Stan&quot; second. The eponymous character&#x27;s name gave rise to a slang term that refers to overzealous or maniacal fans of a celebrity or personality; the term has since been included in the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot;.

==Background and recording==
The 45 King was first inspired to develop a production sampling &quot;Thank You&quot; whilst watching the 1998 film &quot;Sliding Doors&quot;, in which the song is featured, at his home. Upon hearing the song, he immediately switched the film off, went into his studio and looped a sample of &quot;Thank You&quot; as well as adding a bassline. He sent the production to his contacts at Interscope Records, through whom it would eventually find its way to Eminem after his manager Paul Rosenberg sent him a tape of the 45 King&#x27;s production work. When listening to the 45 King&#x27;s loop, the &quot;Thank You&quot; lyric &quot;put your picture on my wall... It reminds me that it&#x27;s not so bad, it&#x27;s not so bad&quot; immediately resonated with Eminem, who felt it would be perfectly suited to a song about an obsessed fan. Since the release of his previous album &quot;The Slim Shady LP&quot; (1999), Eminem had received many disturbing letters from fans who appeared to have taken the album&#x27;s violent content seriously, encouraging him to write a song addressing these fans directly. Therefore the story he tells in the song is not true. 

The third verse of the song had to be entirely re-recorded after the engineer, whom Eminem had never worked with before, accidentally taped over the original take against Eminem&#x27;s wishes. Eminem asked to re-record the final three lines, but the engineer – who Eminem claims was smoking marijuana during the session – mistakenly rewound the 2-inch recording tape right back to the start and began recording again. Eminem immediately realised the error and unsuccessfully tried to alert the engineer, but the take would be completely written over. When revealing this anecdote to music website Genius in 2016, Eminem stated that, in his opinion, the original take was &quot;significantly better&quot; than the re-recorded one, expressing his disappointment that it would never be heard.

==Lyrics==

The song tells the story of a person named Stanley &quot;Stan&quot; Mitchell (voiced by Eminem) who claims to be Eminem&#x27;s biggest fan. It has been suggested the name &quot;Stan&quot; is a portmanteau of the words &quot;stalker&quot; and &quot;fan&quot;, though it is unknown if the name was chosen with that intention. The term &quot;stan&quot; has since become an internet slang term for an extremely obsessed fan of something or someone and is derived from the song&#x27;s title. He writes Eminem several letters; over two verses, he is shown to be obsessive over the rapper, and grows increasingly frustrated and angry when there is no reply. He finally creates a voice recording of himself while driving his car on the highway, having consumed large quantities of depressants and alcohol; this verse includes a call-back to Eminem&#x27;s &quot;My Name Is&quot; with the lyrics &quot;I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare me to drive?&quot;, as well as a reference to a common urban legend surrounding Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; (&quot;about that guy who coulda saved that other guy from drownin&#x27;, but didn&#x27;t...&quot;). He reveals that his pregnant girlfriend is tied up in the trunk as he approaches a bridge, realizing in a panic that he has no way to send the tape to Eminem, but it is too late. The verse ends at the sound of his car swerving off the bridge and hitting the water below.

The fourth verse features Eminem as himself, writing back to Stan and attempting to reason with him. Eminem tries to explain to Stan that while he does appreciate having him as a fan and is incredibly grateful, he worries that Stan might not always be taking the lyrics of his songs in the right way. In an example of dramatic irony, Eminem also urges Stan to receive help for his mental health issues and to treat his girlfriend better, lest he end up like a man he had just seen on the news who had driven his car off a bridge in a drunken stupor, killing himself and his pregnant girlfriend. Eminem then realizes halfway through writing his letter that the man he saw on the news was in fact Stan.

==Music video==
Directed by Dr. Dre and Philip Atwell, the video is a literal interpretation of the story. The video features Devon Sawa as Stan and Dido as his pregnant girlfriend. According to Sawa, he got the part because Dr. Dre was a fan of &quot;Final Destination&quot;, which Sawa starred in. He also stated that Macaulay Culkin was the first choice of the role.

The video starts with a prologue that involved Stan dyeing his hair blonde and reacting angrily to being called &quot;Stanley&quot; by his girlfriend. Later, he sits in a basement full of Eminem&#x27;s posters, writing letters that express his devotion as &quot;[Eminem&#x27;s] biggest fan&quot;. He is aware of every development in Eminem&#x27;s personal life. Stan gets angry at his girlfriend when she interrupts him watching Eminem&#x27;s &quot;The Way I Am&quot; video.

Stan wants Eminem to contact him through a personal letter or a phone call; but, due to unfortunate circumstances, Eminem fails to respond in a timely manner. Believing he has been ignored, Stan uses a tape recorder to record himself driving along a rain-soaked highway while his girlfriend is locked up in the trunk, which he does with the intention of driving off a bridge. In the process, Stan references both &quot;My Name Is&quot; (&quot;I drank a fifth of vodka, dare me to drive?&quot;) and an urban legend about Phil Collins&#x27; &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot;, before realizing that there is no way of transmitting this final tape to Eminem. The car then breaks through the bridge barrier, sealing both occupants&#x27; fates.

Stan&#x27;s mother and his little brother Matthew visit his grave. When Matthew opens his hoodie, he has dyed his hair blonde like Stan. Eminem finally gets around to responding to Stan. He apologizes for being late, thanks him for being a fan, and expresses interest in Stan&#x27;s personal life. Eminem worries about Stan&#x27;s mental state and says he does not want Stan to end up like a story he had seen on the news recently — a man who had driven drunk off a bridge with his girlfriend in the trunk, about whom he then realizes, &quot;It was you. Damn.&quot; Unbeknownst to Eminem, flashes of lightning shine on his window, revealing the ghost of Stan silently glaring, smiling after he sees Eminem finally writing the letter he wanted for so long. The video ends with Matthew staring at Stan&#x27;s grave.

==Censorship==
In the MTV &quot;clean&quot; version, the song and video were censored. Significant portions from the first two verses and most of the third verse were removed. MTV also cut out all references of Stan&#x27;s girlfriend bound in the trunk of the car and removed one scene showing him guzzling vodka while driving. In the MTV full version, which is 8:15 long, the third verse censors Stan mentioning his girlfriend in the trunk (so &quot;Shut up bitch&quot; and &quot;screaming in the trunk&quot; is censored), and about him not slitting her throat, but tied her up, and &quot;if she suffocates, she&#x27;ll suffer more, then she&#x27;ll die too&quot;, which &quot;slit&quot;, &quot;tied her up&quot;, &quot;suffocates&quot;, and &quot;die&quot; is censored.

Dido has stated that she was gagged in the third verse of the video; however, this was censored so widely that versions with her gagged are rare. In the uncensored version, Stan is shown drinking at the wheel of the car before showing Dido struggling in the trunk of the car. She manages to remove the duct tape from her mouth and screams before struggling for breath. Most versions were censored so that there is only a brief clip of Dido in the trunk of the car towards the end of the verse. It also censors when Stan says he &quot;drank a fifth of vodka&quot;, which censors &quot;drank&quot; and &quot;vodka&quot;; and censors when he says he is on &quot;a thousand downers&quot;, with &quot;downers&quot; censored; and also censors Stan drinking while driving. At the end of the third verse, &quot;Well, gotta go, I&#x27;m almost at the bridge now&quot; is changed to &quot;Well, gotta go, I&#x27;m almost at the end of the bridge now&quot;. In the fourth verse, the line &quot;[And what&#x27;s this] shit about us meant to be together&quot; is completely censored. All references to the girlfriend in the trunk are censored, including the screaming in the background, and the line: &quot;And had his girlfriend in his trunk, and she was pregnant with his kid.&quot;

In the MTV short version, which was used for radio airplay due to time constraints, the second verse lines that are missing are from &quot;I ain&#x27;t that mad though, I just don&#x27;t like bein&#x27; lied to&quot; to &quot;I even got a tattoo of your name across the chest&quot;; the video cuts showing Stan meeting Eminem, talking about how his father cheated and beat his mother and showed him getting a &quot;Slim Shady&quot; tattoo on his chest. The missing lyrics from the third verse are of Stan talking about drinking while driving and referencing &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; (Eminem quotes the title as &quot;In the Air of the Night&quot;), which in the video, skips from showing Stan narrowly missing another car and swerving to avoid crashing into it. The lines that are missing are from &quot;Hey Slim, I drank a fifth of vodka, you dare to me to drive?&quot; to &quot;I hope you know I ripped all of your pictures off the wall&quot;. It also removes the chorus after the third verse and goes straight to the fourth verse; the video then cuts to Eminem at last receiving the letter from Stan, and the car sinking deeper into the water.

In Fuse&#x27;s original state as a rock and alternative station, the same versions of the video were shown as on MTV. However, in later Fuse airings, more lines and words are silenced than on the clean version of the LP; half of one of the beginning verses are cut out, and then the song fades out about halfway through the second verse, after playing for approximately two minutes. &quot;Stan&quot; was also released on track 17 of &quot;Curtain Call: The Hits&quot;; on the clean and explicit versions, the live track censored only the profanity, unlike the clean version of the studio track.

==Critical reception==
&quot;Stan&quot; was met with critical acclaim, with praise directed to the song&#x27;s narrative structure, emotional range and lyrical depth. Stephen Thomas Erlewine highlighted the song. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; praised the song, too: &quot;Eminem proves himself a peerless rap poet with a profound understanding of the power of language. &quot;Stan,&quot; an epistolary exchange between the artist and a dangerously obsessive fan, may be the most moving song about star worship ever recorded&quot; and added that &quot;Stan&quot; blazes significant new ground for rap. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; would later select &quot;Stan&quot; as the best single of the year 2000. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was also positive: Stan&#x27;, the album&#x27;s most haunting track, is superb storytelling with a point. It has the affecting tone of such rap high points as Ice Cube&#x27;s &#x27;It Was a Good Day&#x27; and Tupac&#x27;s &#x27;Dear Mama&#x27;.&quot;

&quot;NME&quot; magazine praised the song: Stan&#x27; is a wonderful short story, an astute study in extreme fandom.&quot; Sputnik Music described that &quot;Stan&#x27;s sampling of Dido and use of rain and writing sound effects&quot; make the album versatile. The same critic listed the song in the Recommended Downloads list and reviewed it:If you haven&#x27;t heard this, you probably make a career out of living under rocks. It tells the story of an obsessive fan who kills themselves because their idol (Eminem) never writes back, and introduces one of the album&#x27;s key themes – the scary power of fame. Ironic, then, that this album made him the biggest cultural figurehead on the planet. It starts with a sample of Dido&#x27;s &#x27;Thank You&#x27; under a sample of rain. This sample goes on to form the song&#x27;s hook, relating the level of Stan&#x27;s obsession and almost making him a sympathetic character (Your picture on my wall/It reminds me that it&#x27;s not so bad...). Offsetting this is Eminem&#x27;s raps under the persona of Stan, which reveal him as a reprehensible character; mentally unstable, self-mutilating, sexually confused, volatile, and abusive to his pregnant girlfriend (whose life he takes too, when he takes his own). Eminem&#x27;s final verse is him attempting to write back, asking him not to be like this guy he saw on the news...Overplayed? Yes. But even so, of all of Eminem&#x27;s singles, this one demonstrates his power as a rapper and his skill as a poet best. &quot;IGN&quot; praised the song as &quot;easily the most scathingly introspective rumination on fan adoration, idol assimilation, and borderline stalker etiquette. Teamed to Dido&#x27;s lulling &#x27;Thank You&#x27; with its almost somnambulistically hypnotic pop sultriness provides a jolting contrast to the twisted storyline of a musical obsession gone awry. It also paints a picture of what it&#x27;s like to be knee deep in the push-and-pull world of a superstar. The song&#x27;s poignancy never fades, even almost five years later it&#x27;s still potent.&quot; &quot;Slant Magazine&quot; was mixed: Stan&#x27; is an interesting look into the mind of a fanatic (albeit through the eyes of an equally disturbed individual), but it&#x27;s structured entirely around someone else&#x27;s work (Dido&#x27;s &#x27;Thank You&#x27;).&quot;

== Legacy ==

&quot;Stan&quot; is one of Eminem&#x27;s most acclaimed songs and has been called a &quot;cultural milestone&quot;, referred to as &quot;Eminem&#x27;s best song&quot; by About.com. Analyzing &quot;Stan&quot; in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, writer and literary critic Giles Foden compared Eminem to Robert Browning.

At the 2001 Grammy Awards, when he was facing criticism from GLAAD over his lyrics, Eminem responded by performing &quot;Stan&quot; with singer-songwriter Elton John singing Dido&#x27;s lines. Many of the profanities were substituted, for example, &quot;You&#x27;re like his favorite idol&quot; in place of &quot;You&#x27;re like his fucking idol&quot;, and &quot;stuff&quot; for &quot;shit&quot;. Recordings of this performance were available for download on Eminem&#x27;s official website Eminem.com and, later, on his 2005 greatest hits album &quot;Curtain Call: The Hits&quot;.

Rapper Canibus released a response track to &quot;Stan&quot; titled &quot;U Didn&#x27;t Care&quot; in which Canibus, imitating Stan, accused Eminem of not caring about him.
Christian rap artist KJ-52 recorded two songs: &quot;Dear Slim&quot; and &quot;Dear Slim, Part II&quot;, which attempted to contact Eminem in an allusion to &quot;Stan&quot;. Eminem later referenced a fan who had written a letter saying he was praying for him in &quot;Careful What You Wish For&quot;. &quot;My Life&quot; by The Game samples &quot;Stan&quot;. Conservative rapper Tom MacDonald recorded a response track to Stan in 2021. After Eminem released a series of NFTs as part of his &quot;Shady Con&quot; event with Nifty Gateway, MacDonald purchased one — an Eminem-produced instrumental called &quot;Stan&#x27;s Revenge&quot; — for $100,000. MacDonald used the instrumental to create his song &quot;Dear Slim&quot;, released in May 2021. The song&#x27;s accompanying music video paid homage to the music video for &quot;Stan&quot;.

&quot;Stan&quot; has entered the lexicon as a term for an overly obsessed fan of someone or something and is used colloquially to express fandom of all kinds. The term is especially popular in the rap community; in &quot;Ether&quot;, a diss track against rapper Jay-Z, Nas notably called Jay a &quot;stan&quot; of both himself and The Notorious B.I.G. The term was added to the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; in 2017 and the &quot;Merriam-Webster Dictionary&quot; in 2019. 

&quot;Stan&quot; has been listed by many as one of the greatest rap songs of all time. It was ranked number three on a list of the greatest rap songs in history by &quot;Q&quot; magazine and came tenth in a similar survey conducted by Top40-Charts.com. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine&#x27;s list of the &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot; ranked it number 290, one of Eminem&#x27;s two songs on the list along with &quot;Lose Yourself&quot;; in the updated 2010 list, it was ranked at number 296. It ranked number 45 on About.com&#x27;s &quot;Top 100 Rap Songs&quot;.

The song ranked number 15 on VH1&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Songs of Hip Hop&quot;, and number two on their &quot;Countdown Millennium Songs&quot;. It was also named the &quot;46th Best Song of the Decade&quot; by &quot;Complex&quot; magazine, and the 10th Best Song of the decade by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The song was ranked at number 58 in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s list of &quot;100 Greatest Hip-Hop songs of all time&quot;. In 2017, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked the song number two on their list of the 50 greatest Eminem songs, and in 2020, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the song number one on their list of the 30 greatest Eminem songs.

&quot;Stan&quot; has influenced many other hip-hop songs, including Tyler, the Creator&#x27;s 2013 song &quot;Colossus&quot;, from his album &quot;Wolf&quot;. This track dwells on similar themes as &quot;Stan&quot;, such as growing up without a father, feeling like an outsider, and deep emotional attachment to a rapper.

Eminem has referenced &quot;Stan&quot; in some of his later songs, including &quot;River&quot;, &quot;Walk on Water&quot;, &quot;The Ringer&quot;, &quot;Killshot&quot;, and his verse on &quot;Calm Down&quot; by Busta Rhymes.

Eminem&#x27;s song &quot;Bad Guy&quot;, the opening track on &quot;The Marshall Mathers LP 2&quot;, is a sequel to &quot;Stan&quot;. The song is Matthew tracking down Eminem in an attempt to kill him, which he succeeds in doing so. After he dies in the song, Eminem is sent to hell in the song as a punishment for Stan&#x27;s death.

In 2020, &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; featured a Christmas parody of &quot;Stan&quot; called &quot;Stu&quot;, featuring Pete Davidson as Stu writing to Santa and becoming increasingly angry when he does not answer his requests for a PlayStation 5, with a cameo appearance from Eminem himself, who does receive the system for Christmas. Unlike the final verse in the actual song, Santa, sensing Stu&#x27;s rising instability, blows off Stu in his reply, claiming he had the wrong address the whole time. The skit also features cast members Kate McKinnon as Dido and Bowen Yang as Elton John, as well as guest host Jason Bateman as Santa Claus.

In 2022 at Eminem&#x27;s Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony performance, he performed the song with Ed Sheeran, who played guitar during the song and sang Dido&#x27;s lines. In 2024, it was announced that a new documentary on the phenomenon of stan culture, &quot;Stans&quot;, directed by Steven Leckart and produced by Eminem, will be released.

<text>Trapt is an American rock band formed in Los Gatos, California. Nine studio albums have been recorded to date: &quot;Amalgamation&quot; (1999), &quot;Trapt&quot; (2002), &quot;Someone in Control&quot; (2005), &quot;Only Through the Pain&quot; (2008), &quot;No Apologies&quot; (2010), &quot;Reborn&quot; (2013), &quot;DNA&quot; (2016), &quot;Shadow Work&quot; (2020), and &quot;The Fall&quot; (2024). Its lineup for all studio recordings have consisted of Chris Taylor Brown (vocals) and Pete Charell (bass), with various members filling other roles over the course of their career.

Trapt&#x27;s biggest commercial success was their 2002 debut single, &quot;Headstrong&quot;, which became a crossover hit to the pop charts and peaked at number 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Though the band&#x27;s subsequent releases did not match the pop appeal of &quot;Headstrong&quot;, the band was able to maintain a presence in the rock market throughout the decade.

==History==
===Formation and early years (1995–2000)===
The members of Trapt met in middle school in the mid-&#x27;90s, and were in an early NOFX cover band called the Swinging Udders, with Manny Terres on guitar and Aaron Azlant on lead vocals. Shortly thereafter, the band reformed and developed an act with Chris Taylor Brown (lead vocals), Simon Ormandy (guitar), Rick Sanders (guitar), Pete Charell (bass), and David Stege (drums). The band&#x27;s first few rehearsals were in Ormandy&#x27;s guesthouse, which had a party-like atmosphere with its loft overlooking the living room. They began playing at local venues in 1997 before any members had graduated high school. In 1998, still before graduation, they were already opening for up-and-coming fellow acts like Papa Roach. They recorded and released their first CD, &quot;Amalgamation&quot;, in 1999, which they sold at their live shows. Sanders departed from the band afterwards, but the band opted to remain a quartet instead of recruiting an additional guitarist. Drummer Stege also left the band not longer after. He was replaced by Robin Diaz, and in 2000 the band released the EP &quot;Glimpse&quot;.

===&quot;Trapt&quot; (2001–2003)===
In 2001, the band signed with Warner Bros. Records and started recording their debut album. During recording however, Diaz was simultaneously in Trapt, Closure, and Theory of a Deadman, but he ultimately chose to stay in the latter two bands; thus, his place in Trapt was filled by Aaron Montgomery. On November 5, 2002, the band released their major label debut album, &quot;Trapt&quot;, which was certified platinum by the RIAA on November 24, 2003. The album produced a total of three charting singles: &quot;Headstrong&quot;, &quot;Still Frame&quot;, and &quot;Echo&quot; with &quot;Headstrong&quot; as the most successful of the three.

===&quot;Someone in Control&quot; (2004–2006)===
Before releasing their next full-length album, the band released a self-titled three-track EP, released March 30, 2004, that included live versions of the &quot;Made of Glass&quot; and &quot;Echo&quot; tracks from their debut album, as well as a previously unreleased non-LP track, &quot;Promise&quot;.

Their second full-length album, titled &quot;Someone in Control&quot;, was released September 13, 2005. It produced three singles for the band: &quot;Stand Up&quot;, &quot;Waiting&quot;, and &quot;Disconnected (Out of Touch)&quot;. While it reached #14 on the US Billboard 200, the album didn&#x27;t meet Warner&#x27;s expectations, selling 500,000 copies. Disappointed, Warner stopped responding to the band. Brown said of the situation “We didn’t like the situation. We asked them to let us off the label. There was no official parting of the ways; we just said, ‘We’re leaving,’ and there was no response, so we were out of there.” The band signed to Eleven Seven the following year.

===&quot;Only Through the Pain&quot; (2007–2009)===

Their first live album titled &quot;Trapt Live!&quot;, was released on September 18, 2007. The album featured two new studio songs, &quot;Stay Alive&quot; and &quot;Everything to Lose&quot;, as well as live versions of nine songs from their earlier records. On March 7, 2008, it was announced that lead guitarist Simon Ormandy had parted ways with the band. He was replaced by Robb Torres. Despite rumors indicating otherwise, Ormandy&#x27;s departure was amicable, and Brown continued to speak highly of Ormandy to the media, while promoting Torres as the new guitarist. A day later on March 8, Trapt released &quot;Who&#x27;s Going Home With You Tonight?&quot; on the band&#x27;s website, a song from their then-upcoming studio album entitled &quot;Only Through the Pain&quot;, which released on August 5. A music video for the song was released later that year. The band also posted four other songs before the album&#x27;s release: &quot;Black Rose&quot;, &quot;Contagious&quot;, &quot;Wasteland&quot;, and &quot;Ready When You Are&quot;. On April 15, Trapt announced they would be touring as part of Mötley Crüe&#x27;s &quot;Crüe Fest&quot; along with Buckcherry, Papa Roach and The tour began July 1, 2008 in West Palm Beach, Florida, and wrapped up in Burgettstown, Pennsylvania on August 31.

===&quot;No Apologies&quot; and &quot;Reborn&quot; (2010–2013)===
In March 2010, Trapt said they were wrapping up the recording process of their new record with producer Johnny K. &quot;No Apologies&quot; was released on October 12, 2010. The first single, &quot;Sound Off&quot;, was available on iTunes on July 20, 2010. Another song, &quot;Stranger in the Mirror&quot;, was released for free from the band&#x27;s Facebook page August 11, 2010. The band left Eleven Seven shortly after the release. In 2011, the band released the compilation album &quot;Headstrong&quot; under Cleopatra Records, with which they re-recorded 7 tracks from their self-titled, as well as releasing a new track, &quot;Policy of Truth&quot;.

In 2012, the band signed with Epochal Artists, and in October of that year, announced &quot;Reborn&quot; would be released on November 20, before delaying it to January 22, 2013. The tracks &quot;Bring It&quot; and &quot;Love Hate Relationship&quot; were released as a double single.

===&quot;DNA&quot;, &quot;Shadow Work&quot;, and &quot;The Fall&quot; (2014–present)===
In 2014, Trapt re-released their early, out of print albums &quot;Amalgamation&quot; and &quot;Glimpse EP&quot;. and announced &quot;The Self Titled Tour&quot;, a tour focused around their self-titled album. On June 15, Trapt launched an Indiegogo campaign to help fund their next studio album, &quot;DNA&quot;, and a collection of acoustic versions of songs called &quot;The Acoustic Collection&quot;, which came out that summer. Their $50k goal was met two weeks early.

The band&#x27;s seventh studio album, &quot;DNA&quot; was released on August 19, 2016. It was the band&#x27;s poorest charting album to date, debuting and peaking at number 148 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart. Similarly, its three singles, &quot;Passenger&quot;, &quot;Human&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s Over&quot;, failed to crack the top 20 of the Mainstream Rock Songs chart, or chart at all on the Hot Rock Songs chart. They also partook in the Make America Rock Again tour that year and the following year.In 2018, the band released the non-album single &quot;Come Together&quot; with rapper An0maly, which did not chart on any &quot;Billboard&quot; song charts.

In May 2020, a new studio album, &quot;Shadow Work&quot;, was announced. It released the following July, though it failed to chart in the top 200 of albums released in the US Billboard 200 chart in its release week, selling only 600 copies, an 87% drop from their prior studio album, &quot;DNA&quot;, in 2016. In the following December, multiple outlets reported that Brown had been fired from the band, though it was debunked as a hoax hours later. On January 23, 2021, drummer Mike Smith announced that he had left Trapt for &quot;primarily political&quot; reasons. Brendan Hengle left around the same time, but made no announcement.

In 2023, the band announced that their new album, titled &quot;The Fall&quot;, would be released by the end of the year, before being delayed to March 2024, and again to May 31.

==Musical style and influences==
Trapt&#x27;s sound has been described as nu metal, post-grunge, alternative metal and hard rock. AllMusic critic MacKenzie Wilson thought that the band &quot;draws influences from grunge and heavy metal&quot; while &quot;absorbing the heavy rock sounds of Korn, Soundgarden, and Metallica&quot;. The band has cited Korn, Tool, Papa Roach, Pink Floyd, Pearl Jam and Genesis as influences.

==Social media use==
Many publications have taken note of the band&#x27;s unusual use of social media accounts, run by Brown, often to lash out and attack others, something not often done from official band accounts. Music website &quot;MetalSucks&quot; noted in 2015 that the band&#x27;s official Facebook account made lengthy posts criticizing viewers of &quot;Keeping Up with the Kardashians&quot;, which devolved into the account swearing and berating commenters. The comment also included homophobic insults towards internet musician Rob Scallon, whom the band had feuded with on social media earlier in the year over the unauthorized and unattributed use of Scallon&#x27;s videos. In 2017, Brown insulted commenters who disagreed with his defense of former President Trump&#x27;s dismissal of James Comey, and then again later in the year with critics of Brown&#x27;s stance that institutional racism does not exist.

In March 2020, &quot;Metal Injection&quot;, &quot;The A.V. Club&quot;, and &quot;Slate&quot; all reported that the band&#x27;s Twitter account had gone on a week-long effort of arguing with and insulting people. It began with insults of civil rights activist and bishop Talbert W. Swan II and accusations of having a &quot;victim mentality&quot;. The comments then expanded into areas such as defending the Unite the Right rally, calling people &quot;nerds&quot;, challenging the existence of white privilege in society, supporting Trump&#x27;s &quot;Chinese virus&quot; rhetoric in reference to the COVID-19 pandemic, and fat-shaming women. &quot;Loudwire&quot; noted that many notable bands and musicians later responded to counter or ridicule the claims. Brown later used the band account to threaten legal action against an unflattering parody account assuming Trapt&#x27;s identity, but dropped the issue on the same day once the account altered its Twitter handle to make the parody clearer. In May 2020, Brown threatened legal action against multiple Change.org petitions to keep the band&#x27;s music off of the upcoming &quot;Tony Hawk&#x27;s Pro Skater 1 + 2&quot; re-release, even though the band&#x27;s music never appeared on the originals nor was announced for the remaster. In the same month, Brown used the band&#x27;s account to partially blame George Floyd for his own death.

In August 2020, in response to an article by music publication &quot;Consequence of Sound&quot; that asserted that the band drew a small crowd size at a festival, the band took to Twitter to berate the publication and any fans who agreed with the story&#x27;s claim of poor attendance. The following month, the band&#x27;s account was used to publicly berate Travis Livingstone, an artist the band had commissioned, but not paid, for a lyric video for their album release that year. In October 2020, the band drew criticism when they announced their support for the far-right extremist group the Proud Boys and invited the group&#x27;s Dallas, Texas, chapter to their next show in town.

In November 2020, &quot;Spin&quot; reported that Facebook had deleted Trapt&#x27;s page on the grounds of hate speech. In December 2020, the band&#x27;s Twitter account was suspended after Brown wrote a series of Tweets that multiple publications interpreted to be about defending statutory rape, where Brown said he would &#x27;high five&#x27; a hypothetical 15-year-old boy who had sex with a 25-year-old female teacher. In April 2021, Brown defended and clarified his stance, saying it was not meant as a defense of statutory rape, but rather, &quot;a joke in bad taste&quot; in relation to his thoughts on the &quot;double standard between how men need to treat women versus the other way around&quot;.

<text>Oregon Ballot Measure 9 was a 1992 citizens&#x27; initiative concerning LGBT rights in the state of Oregon. It sought to amend the Oregon Constitution to prohibit anti-discrimination laws regarding sexual orientation and to declare homosexuality to be &quot;abnormal, wrong, unnatural, and perverse&quot;.
Listing homosexuality alongside pedophilia and sadism and masochism, it has been described as one of the harshest anti-gay measures presented to voters in American history.

The initiative was an effort of the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), a conservative group active in Oregon politics in the 1990s.
It was defeated in the 1992 general election, receiving 44 percent of the vote. 
The OCA went on to successfully sponsor similar initiatives in several Oregon counties where a majority of voters had supported Measure 9. The Oregon Legislative Assembly eventually overruled these local measures. Opposition to Measure 9 formed the basis of much of the gay rights movement in Oregon.

== Political context ==
The ballot measure was an effort of the Oregon Citizens Alliance (OCA), a conservative group affiliated with the Christian Coalition that was active in Oregon politics in the 1990s.
In 1991, OCA Chairman Lon Mabon announced an &quot;Abnormal Behaviors Initiative&quot; that would seek to prevent state and local governments from &quot;condoning or promoting&quot; homosexuality along with necrophilia, bestiality, or pedophilia.
Supporters of the eventual ballot measure felt that their traditional values were under siege in the face of growing acceptance of homosexuality by society. Opponents stated that the measure was unfairly discriminatory, that it was unconstitutional, and that it demonstrated the homophobia and bigotry of its backers.

The campaign for Measure 9 occurred in the midst of national discourse around &quot;family values&quot; and an economic downturn in which incumbent president George H. W. Bush sought to appeal to socially conservative voters. At the 1992 Republican National Convention, conservative commentator Pat Buchanan gave a speech saying, &quot;There is a religious war going on in this country. It is a cultural war [...] this is a war for the soul of America&quot;.
Bush stated his opposition to anti-discrimination laws protecting sexual orientation, while his opponent Bill Clinton expressed support for LGBT rights. In response to a question at a campaign event in Portland, Oregon, Clinton defended homosexuals&#x27; right to &quot;live their lives and make a contribution to the rest of us&quot;.

The OCA used the slogan &quot;No Special Rights&quot; to imply that LGBT people wanted social advantages (&quot;special rights&quot;) rather than mere equality. In this and similar campaigns, homosexuality was portrayed as a choice rather than an innate characteristic, one that did not deserve protection.
The campaign also made extensive use of a video titled &quot;The Gay Agenda&quot; produced by a California evangelical group, featuring scenes from gay pride parades chosen to portray gay men as hypermasculine and threatening.
Another film titled &quot;Gay RightsSpecial Rights: Inside the Homosexual Agenda&quot; (1993), produced by the Southern Baptist Convention, also circulated in the state.

== Reception ==
Republican Senator and evangelical Christian Mark Hatfield opposed the measure, as did Oregon&#x27;s most prominent newspapers. Opponents outspent the OCA six to one.
On September 10, 1992, the grunge rock band Nirvana played a benefit concert titled, &quot;No on #9&quot;. It was ultimately defeated with 44 percent of the vote in support of the measure.

== Legacy ==
The OCA would go on to back the 1994 Oregon Ballot Measure 13, which would have prevented schools from using materials that were deemed to &quot;legitimize homosexuality&quot;, and the 1994 Oregon Ballot Measure 19. They also backed another measure numbered 9 (&quot;son of 9&quot;) in 2000. All these were unsuccessful.
Another response of the OCA was to place laws similar to Measure 9 on local ballots in the parts of Oregon where a majority of voters had supported Measure 9. They succeeded in this effort in Josephine, Douglas, Linn, and Klamath counties, as well as in Canby and Junction City. The state legislature eventually overruled these local measures.
Opposition to Ballot Measure 9 formed the basis of much of the current gay rights movement in Oregon, including the organization Basic Rights Oregon.
