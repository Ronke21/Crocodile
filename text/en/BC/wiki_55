<text>Leonardo da Vinci Rome Fiumicino Airport () is an international airport in Fiumicino, Italy, serving Rome. It is the busiest airport in the country, the 8th-busiest airport in Europe and the world&#x27;s 36th-busiest airport with over 49.2 million passengers served in 2024. It covers an area of .

Fiumicino serves as the principal hub for ITA Airways, the Italian flag carrier and the largest airline in the country. It was previously the hub for Alitalia, the defunct airline that was Italy&#x27;s largest. It is also an operating base for several other airlines, such as Neos, AeroItalia, Ryanair, Vueling and Wizz Air.

Opened in 1961, it is in Fiumicino, south of Rome, and is named for Italian polymath Leonardo da Vinci (1452–1519). Reproductions of some of his most famous works and inventions are on display inside the airport.

==History==

===Early years===
During construction, the remains of some Roman ships were found.

The airport was officially opened on 15 January 1961, with two runways, replacing the smaller Rome Ciampino Airport, which remains in service for some low-cost airlines as well as domestic and charter operations. Despite being officially opened in 1961, Leonardo da Vinci–Fiumicino Airport had actually been in use since 20 August 1960. This was to help relieve air traffic that was congesting Rome Ciampino Airport during the 1960 Summer Olympics.

During the 1960s, former home-based Alitalia invested heavily in the new airport, building hangars and maintenance centres; in the same period a third runway was added (16L/34R).

===Later development===
Security Services transferred from the Polizia di Stato (Italian State Police) to Aeroporti di Roma S.p.A. in 2000. Aeroporti di Roma created ADR Security S.r.l. (100%-owned) to provide these services as well as security services to airlines (in competition with other security companies such as IVRI). Airport Security is supervised by Polizia di Stato, Guardia di Finanza (Italian Customs Police), Italian Civil Aviation Authority and Aeroporti di Roma S.p.A.. Ground handling services were provided by Aeroporti di Roma until 1999, when it created Aeroporti di Roma Handling (to serve all airlines except for Alitalia, which continued to be handled by Aeroporti di Roma itself). Alitalia provided passenger assistance even before 1999. In 2001, Alitalia created &quot;Alitalia Airport&quot; and started providing ground handling for itself and other airlines. Aeroporti di Roma Handling remains the biggest handler in terms of airlines handled, but Alitalia Airport is the biggest handler in terms of airplanes handled as Alitalia aircraft account for 50% of the ones at Fiumicino. In May 2006, Italy&#x27;s Civil Aviation Authority announced that it took off the limitation of three ramp handlers in Rome Leonardo da Vinci airport. ARE Group and Aviapartner announced that they would create a company called Aviapartner (51% Aviapartner; 49% ARE Group) to serve Milan Malpensa and Rome Leonardo da Vinci.

Since 2005, the airport operates a category III B instrument landing system (ILS). Further improvement work was implemented in 2007 to enable the airport to handle 30 takeoffs/landings per hour, up from 10, in the event of thick fog. Three runways presently operate at Leonardo da Vinci airport: 16L/34R and 16R/34L (separated by a distance of ), and 07/25, used only westwards for takeoffs owing to the prevailing winds. The airport used to have a fourth runway, 16C/34C which was located alongside 16L/34R, it was mostly used as a taxiway or as a backup for 16L/34R; the runway is now designated as Taxiway &quot;D&quot;.

In 2010, the new single baggage handling system for more efficient luggage delivery began operations.

Several projects are planned. These include the construction of an environmentally-friendly cogeneration system, which would allow the airport to produce its own energy; the &quot;Masterplan Fiumicino Nord&quot;, involving four new terminals and two new runways to be built in the future handling 100 million passengers per year.

=== Terrorist attacks ===

Rome-Fiumicino airport has been hit twice by terrorist attacks: the first in 1973 (34 deaths) following the expulsion of the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) from Jordan and the Jordanian-Palestinian civil war, and the second in 1985 (19 deaths +4 terrorists) part of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, presumably linked to Abu Nidal Organization.

== Terminals ==
===Overview===
As of 2021, after major expansion and refurbishment works, the airport now features two terminals:

*Terminal 1 (Gates A1–A83) home base to ITA Airways
*Terminal 3 (Gates E1–E52) is the largest terminal. It also incorporates the former Terminal 5 as well as the satellite building for non-Schengen departures. A new central airside hall has been built as its middle part in recent years.

===Development===

The terminals were upgraded during the 1990s and 2000s. In 1991, the domestic Pier A with 12 gates opened, followed in 1995 by the international Pier B with 10 gates and in 1999 by the international Satellite C with 14 gates. In 2000, the new domestic Terminal A opened, and the terminal buildings, then consisting of Terminal A (with Pier A), Terminal AA, Terminal B (with Pier B) and Terminal C (with Satellite C), were reorganized.

The dedicated Cargo City terminal was added in 2004, while the check-in counters for Northwest Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Continental Airlines, United Airlines, US Airways, American Airlines and El Al in Terminal 5 opened in 2008, with passengers then being bused to what was then called Satellite C. 

In 2009, the terminals were renamed. Terminal A was renamed Terminal 1, Terminal AA was renamed T2, Terminals B and C were consolidated into Terminal 3, and Terminal 5 remained unchanged.

In January 2017, Terminal 5 was closed for renovations; a new central airside hall is currently being built in the middle section. The former Terminal 2 closed permanently on 15 December 2017 to make way for the north-west expansion of Terminal 1. A new three-storey boarding and waiting area, as well as a new Pier A with 13 boarding and 10 remote gates, have been built.

From 17 March 2020 to 6 August 2021, Terminal 1 was closed due to decreased passenger traffic amidst the COVID-19 pandemic; this pause was used to perform a redesign of the main hall layout, which increased the available passenger space.

Future plans include a new Terminal 4, expansion of runways, and new buildings for car parking, services, and airport facilities.

===SkyBridge===
An automated people mover (APM) called SkyBridge (Innovia APM 100) opened in 1999 along with the Satellite C. It consists of two stations, one on the third floor of Terminal 3, and the other on the second floor of gate area E31–44. This shuttle train is the only means of transport for passengers between the two sections of the terminal. The westbound service, from T3 to Gates E31–44, is for departing passengers only, while the eastbound service is for arriving passengers only. Arriving passengers are not permitted to take the train back, as they need to pass through a transfer security checkpoint to re-enter the departure area. Likewise, departing passengers are not permitted to take the train back to Terminal 3.

===Leonardo Express===
Fiumicino Aeroporto railway station is served by the Leonardo Express train operated by Trenitalia, available at the airport terminal. It takes 30 minutes to get to Termini Station in the city center of Rome, with a non-stop trip that is provided every 15 minutes. The railway section to the airport was opened in May 1990, and uses the Rome-Fiumicino railway infrastructure.

===FL lines===
Leonardo da Vinci airport is also connected to Rome by the FL1 line, a suburban commuter and rapid transit line. Departing every 15 minutes, stopping at all stations. The FL1 line does not stop at Termini station, connects the airport with the other main stations of Rome where it is possible to change to the metro network, Trastevere (Tram lines 3 and 8), Ostiense (Metro Piramide), Tuscolana (Metro Ponte Lungo) or Roma Tiburtina (Metro Tiburtina).

===High-speed===
The airport is also connected to the Italian high-speed network, the following connections depart from Fiumicino Aeroporto station:

*Frecciarossa (from 9 December 2018): which connects it to Venice via the national high-speed network with intermediate stops in Roma Termini, Roma Tiburtina, Firenze Santa Maria Novella, Bologna and Padua (frequency two pairs of trains per day).
*Frecciarossa (from 12 July 2022): which connects to Naples via the national high-speed network with intermediate stops in Napoli Afragola and Roma Termini.

===Road===
Leonardo da Vinci is about by car from Rome&#x27;s historic city centre. The airport is also served by different categories of transport: buses, shuttle buses, car sharing and taxis. 

The airport is a terminus for local and national bus lines:
* Night connection COTRAL &quot;Fiumicino Airport - Roma Termini - Roma Tiburtina station&quot;
* Connection COTRAL &quot;Cornelia Metro line A - Fregene - Fiumicino Airport&quot;

*Parking for motorcycles (available on the ground floor of the Multi-storey P-Terminal A).

Leonardo da Vinci has improved the real-time info mobility service that is provided to passengers and airport operators on the leading connections from the airport. This new layout makes it easier for passengers to interpret information on connections to and from the airport. They have also upgraded road surfaces in the arrival areas of Terminal 1 and Terminal 3 to let taxis pull up to the platform more easily and make it easier for passengers to get off.

==Incidents and accidents==
From the 1960s until the 1980s, the airport experienced significant aircraft hijackings as well as being the scene of two major terrorist attacks and the port of origin for an aircraft bombing in flight—some engendered by Palestinians as part of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict.

*On 23 November 1964, TWA Flight 800, operated by a Boeing 707, had an engine catch fire during takeoff. 50 of the 73 passengers and crew on board were killed.
*On 15 January 1973, a number of extremists planned to attack Prime Minister Golda Meir&#x27;s plane at Fiumicino airport. They placed Strela missiles inside a number of vehicles at certain locations around the airport, but Italian and Israeli authorities were able to intercept them.
*On 17 December 1973, during the 1973 Rome airport attacks and hijacking, a Boeing 707-321B operating as Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) Flight 110 was attacked by Palestinian assailants. 30 passengers were killed when phosphorus bombs were thrown aboard the aircraft as it was preparing for departure. During the same incident a Lufthansa Boeing 737 was hijacked and landed at Athens, Damascus and finally in Kuwait. All remaining passengers and crew were then released. Two people died in the incident.
*On 25 December 1974, while flying from Beirut to Rome, Air India Flight 105, a Boeing 747-237B, was hijacked by a 31-year-old male passenger. The crew was able to subdue the hijacker, who was handed over to top Italian police officers after landing.
*On 19 November 1977, an Ethiopian Airlines Boeing 707-360C, a cargo flight, crashed after takeoff W of FCO. The plane barely gained height after takeoff from runway 25, reaching a height of , contacting treetops, and struck the ground further on. All five occupants (three crew, two passengers) were killed. Unconfirmed reports indicated the plane was overloaded.
*On 27 December 1985, during the Rome and Vienna airport attacks, assailants shot and killed 16 people and wounded 99 others at the check-in counter. Most perpetrators were shot by security and police officers.
*On 17 October 1988, Uganda Airlines Flight 775 from London Gatwick to Entebbe International Airport via Fiumicino, crashed short of the runway after two missed approaches. Twenty-six of the 45 passengers aboard, as well as all seven crew members, died.
*On 2 February 2013, Alitalia Flight 1670, operated by a leased ATR 72, en route from Pisa International Airport to Rome, overran the runway during landing. 16 occupants were injured, two of them seriously. The aircraft was subsequently written off. 
*On 8 June 2013, Wizz Air Flight 3141, an Airbus A320-232 (registration HA-LWM) from Bucharest – Henri Coandă Airport, Romania to Rome-Ciampino, Italy, made an emergency landing at Fiumicino Airport when the crew encountered problems lowering one of the main undercarriages and locking it into position. The aircraft diverted to Fiumicino because of the longer runway, and firefighters applied foam after landing as a precautionary measure. The aircraft was evacuated using slides. Initial reports of injured passengers were denied by both Wizz Air and Rome Fiumicino Airport, who said some passengers requested medical checkups but reported no injuries.

<text>Kapuskasing ( ) is a town on the Kapuskasing River in the Cochrane District of Northern Ontario, Canada, approximately east of Hearst and northwest of Timmins. The town was known as MacPherson until 1917, when the name was changed so as not to conflict with another railway stop in Manitoba.

== Etymology ==
The town of Kapuskasing gets its name from the Kapuskasing River. The first reported survey of the district in which Kapuskasing lies was carried out in 1875 by Dr. Robert Bell of the Geological Survey of Canada. He referred to the Kapuskasing River as the &quot;Kai-bush-ka-sing&quot;. According to Bell&#x27;s information, the Kapuskasing River derived its name from the lake at its head.

In 1900, the Bureau of Colonization of the Ontario Department of Agriculture sent parties to survey the region north of the Canadian Pacific Railway between the Quebec border and Lake Nipigon. Their main interest was to seek out and delimit areas for further agricultural settlements that would give Ontario a new farming frontier to offset the attraction of the western prairies.

In 1900, the Department of Crown Lands commissioned a Survey of Exploration of Northern Ontario. Survey parties were sent out to explore, document and report back to the Province on the various resources of water power, timber, etc., that might be available for exploitation. No roads existed, but northern Cree Indians and fur traders had used the local rivers connecting to James Bay for centuries. In the summer of 1900 groups of surveyors traveled the many rivers of this remote area documenting their findings. The results were published by order of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario as &quot;Report of the Survey of Exploration of Northern Ontario 1900&quot;. The section of the report detailing the exploration of the Kapuskasing River contains references to the local Cree names for Sturgeon Falls, White Spruce Rapids, Kapuskasing River, and Big Beaver Falls, among others. Surveyors who explored the Kapuskasing River and tributaries in 1900 had local Cree guides familiar with the country who provided the local place names and their meanings to them. In this report the word &quot;Kapuskasing&quot; is said to mean &quot;Whispering Water&quot;.

At the location where the CNR crossed the Kapuskasing River in 1910, there was an island in the centre of the river. Power and storage dams were built at that location in 1923. Prior to the dam construction, the rapids at that location was known as &quot;White Spruce Rapids&quot; and later known simply as &quot;Spruce Falls&quot;. The first Spruce Falls Company of 1920 took its name from these rapids.

== Geography, climate, and wildlife ==
Kapuskasing lies in the heart of the Great Clay Belt. The topography of the region is very flat, dotted with numerous small lakes and muskeg bogs. Also in the heart of Canada&#x27;s boreal forest, the region is drained by rivers running north to James Bay. The district is heavily forested, mostly by thick stands of black spruce that have commercial value as pulpwood.

Kapuskasing has a humid, continental climate (Koppen Dfb). Kapuskasing has long, cold winters and warm, sometimes humid summers. Spring and autumn are relatively short transitional seasons. Visitors often comment on the deep blue of the sky during clear weather.

Wildlife is abundant. Species such as moose, black bear, lynx and red fox are commonly seen in the area. Lakes and rivers are well populated with walleye, northern pike and yellow perch. Fishing and hunting are very popular recreational activities locally.


== History ==

Located near the western edge of the Clay Belt of &quot;New Ontario&quot;, the town was founded in the early 20th century after the National Transcontinental Railway, forerunner of the Canadian National Railway, was built through the area in 1911. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the founding of Kapuskasing&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

A post-war scheme to settle Canadian Corps combat veterans in the area proved unsuccessful. It was not until the start of pulp and paper milling operations in the 1920s that Kapuskasing began to develop as an organized community.

Val Albert

Name taken from that of an early settler and assigned by postal authorities on October 7, 1936, &quot;to correspond with the village known as {Val} Albert&quot; (CPCGN files). Annexed by Kapuskasing on January 1, 1974.

=== Spruce Falls ===

The Kapuskasing River Pulp and Timber limit, that included of timber and hydro leases at Sturgeon Falls, White Spruce Rapids (Spruce Falls) and Big Beaver Falls, was awarded to speculators Saphrenous A. Mundy and Elihu Stewart in 1917, and Spruce Falls Pulp and Paper Ltd. was incorporated, but no development took place.

The still unexploited timber limits were sold to Kimberly-Clark in 1920. The new Spruce Falls Company Ltd. began the development of the first pulp mill in Kapuskasing under the direction of F.J. Sensenbrenner, a Vice President of Kimberly Clark Corporation for the next 20 years. The small sulphite mill started up in late 1922 with four 12-ton digesters and a daily output of 75 tons of pulp. Spent liquor was discharged untreated into the Kapuskasing River.

Early development was plagued by major setbacks. Fire destroyed the construction camp and power project at Sturgeon Falls. A year&#x27;s supply of pulpwood that was boomed up in the river was washed away in the spring flood. A fire at the new mill killed two workers and brought production to a halt.

In 1923, a water storage and hydro electric dam was built by Morrow and Beatty Ltd. of Peterborough at Spruce Falls. In 1925, the Spruce Falls Company Limited was awarded additional timber limits to the north and south, bringing their total limits up to .

In 1926, the Spruce Falls Power and Paper Company was incorporated under joint ownership of Kimberly-Clark and &quot;The New York Times&quot;. The new company negotiated two additional hydro power leases to the north on the Mattagami River at Smoky Falls and Devils Rapids. Work to build a 550 ton/day paper mill at Kapuskasing, a 75,000 HP hydro generating station at Smoky Falls and a railway and power line connecting the two got underway in the spring of 1926. The contractor for the entire project was Morrow and Beatty Ltd. of Peterborough.

Since July 13, 1928, &quot;The New York Times&quot; has been printed entirely on Spruce Falls paper. The mill has run continuously ever since. The company became known locally as &quot;Uncle Spruce&quot; in affectionate reference to the steady work and benefits provided to this distinct northern community for many decades.

The mill was the focus of the Reesor Siding 1963 Strike, which saw three union workers killed. In 1997, Tembec became the sole owner of the mill which is now known as Tembec — Spruce Falls Operations.

=== Kapuskasing Inn ===

The Kapuskasing Inn was built in 1927–28 by George Roper Gouinlock, son of George Wallace Gouinlock, together with the Civic Centre (built 1928) and the former Sensenbrenner Hospital (built 1929, now Drury Place, a geared-to-income housing complex). They were commissioned by the Spruce Falls Company Ltd. These buildings were all built in an impressive Neo-Tudor style and would form the nucleus of the town. In 1951, the inn hosted Princess Elizabeth and the Duke of Edinburgh on their first visit to Canada.

The landmark inn closed in 2002 and fell in disrepair but was slated for renovation by new investors. On May 22, 2007, youths set fire to the inn. It was damaged beyond repair. The arsonists were not charged as they were below the age of criminal responsibility at the time of the fire. The remains of the inn were demolished in May and June 2008.

=== Internment camp ===

During World War I, the town was the site of one of the largest internment camps in Canada, at Bunk Houses in Kapuskasing from December 1914 to February 1920. The camp held over 1,300 German, Austrian, and Turkish prisoners, though originally the majority were civilian internees of Ukrainian descent who had emigrated from the provinces of Bukovina and Galicia, their homeland, which at the time were part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire, in the first wave of Ukrainian emigration to Canada prior to 1914. Prisoners were employed in the construction of buildings and clearing of land for a government experimental farm on the west side of the Kapuskasing River. Isolation provided ideal security for the minimum security camp, as the railway was the only access to the remote location. Prisoners who attempted to escape into the bush were turned back by endless muskeg and clouds of mosquitoes or minus-40 degree temperatures in winter. In 1917, most were paroled to help relieve labour shortages. Afterwards, the camp was used for prisoners of war and political radicals until its closure in 1920.

While serving as camp paymaster at Kapuskasing during its use for POWs, Captain Watson Kirkconnell, who was later to become a highly important figure in Canadian poetry, helped prevent a prisoner uprising and, on two occasions, he also discovered and foiled attempts to tunnel out of the camp.

Despite years of grief over the combat death of his brother, Captain Kirkconnell later wrote, &quot;Generally speaking, I could feel little animus against our German prisoners. Guarding them was simply a job. It was their duty to try to get away and our duty to prevent it. The ingenuity that they displayed in their attempts to escape was being duplicated by our men in German captivity.&quot;

A small cemetery is all that remains of the internment camp near the Kapuskasing Airport where victims of the 1918 influenza epidemic were laid to rest. An Ontario Historical Plaque was erected by the province to commemorate the Kapuskasing Internment Camp&#x27;s role in Ontario&#x27;s heritage.

=== Kapuskasing Soldier Colony ===
Governments of the day were mistakenly impressed with the agricultural potential of the Great Clay Belt. A federal government experimental farm had been established on the west side of the river to explore and develop crops and systems for farming the area. Under the Returned Soldiers and Sailors Act of 1917, the Kapuskasing Soldier Colony was established to settle veterans returned from the Great War. Settlers received homesteads, grants, and guaranteed loans and were paid for clearing their own land. However, by 1920 only nine of more than 100 original settlers remained, and the project was discontinued.

A 1920 Commission of Enquiry into the failed settlement scheme found that the settlers had not been up to the task at hand. The inhospitable climate and geography had won out. One bitter settler testified, &quot;There are 7 months snow, two months rain and the remainder mosquitoes and black flies.&quot; Settlers had also counted on the development of a pulp mill at Kapuskasing that would provide a local market for pulp wood.

=== Radar site ===
During World War II, Kapuskasing was one of five Northern Ontario radar bases that were set up to watch for potential attacks on the Soo Locks in Sault Ste. Marie, Michigan. Kapuskasing was the headquarters for the radar bases, which were manned by the United States Army Air Forces. The town may have ceased its importance as a location for a traditional military radar base, but has become a site for the Super Dual Auroral Radar Network that is involved with tracking and measuring ionospheric turbulence.

== Demographics ==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Kapuskasing had a population of living in of its total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of . With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.


In 2006, 68% of the population identified French as its first language, 36% identified English as its first language, and 0.02% identified a non-official language as its first language (Cree etc.); 0.02% identified both French and English. The median age of the population was 44.2 years in 2016.

== Transportation ==

Travellers reach Kapuskasing by car, Ontario Northland bus, or plane.

The town&#x27;s pulp and paper mill is served by the Ontario Northland Railway, which took over the trackage serving the mill in 1994. The mill is located near the original National Transcontinental Railway mainline (NTR) that was later nationalized as part of the Canadian National Railway. The railway line crossed the Kapuskasing River in 1913 and was the main means of transportation accessing the town until the late 1950s and the early 1960s, when Highway 11 became the main route to the city.

Kapuskasing Airport was once a refuelling stop for Trans-Canada Air Lines flights in the days before jet airliners. It no longer has scheduled flights.

== Economy ==
The former Spruce Falls, now GreenFirst Forest Products, had purchased the site from Rayonier Advanced Materials (RYAM) in 2021. The pulp and paper mill is the town&#x27;s major employer, soon to be replaced by the Ontario Power Generation&#x27;s Smoky Falls Dam reconstruction site. A former employer was also the Agrium phosphate mine which shut down in 2013. General Motors Canada operates the GM Cold Weather Development Centre in Kapuskasing. Agriculture and Agri-Food Canada operated an agricultural experiment station, or Experimental Farm, close to the town; the Experimental Farm closed in 2014.

== Politics ==
Kapuskasing has a federal representative known as a Member of Parliament, or MP, and a provincial representative known as a Member of Provincial Parliament, or MPP. Carol Hughes of the New Democratic Party is the area&#x27;s MP and represents the federal riding of Algoma—Manitoulin—Kapuskasing. Guy Bourgouin, member of Ontario&#x27;s New Democratic Party, is the town&#x27;s MPP and represents the provincial Mushkegowuk—James Bay riding.

Locally the town is led by Mayor David Plourde. The mayor works with six councillors to complete Kapuskasing&#x27;s municipal government. Local officials are all elected through universal elections, meaning the town is not divided into wards.

== Media ==
Kapuskasing&#x27;s locally originated media include English-language commercial radio station CKAP (branded as Moose FM), French-language community radio station CKGN, and the English-language &quot;Kapuskasing Northern Times&quot; and bilingual &quot;Le/The Weekender&quot; community newspapers and the French newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Horizon&quot;. &quot;Le Nord&quot;, a French newspaper from Hearst, is also available in Kapuskasing. English-language daily newspaper the &quot;Timmins Daily Press&quot; offers minimal coverage through its regional reporting of the Cochrane District. The community receives its only aerial television coverage from CITO-TV-1 channel 10, a repeater of CTV outlet CITO-TV Timmins.

== Public services ==
=== Health ===
Sensenbrenner Hospital was built in 1927-1929 by the Spruce Falls Pulp &amp; Paper Company for its workers. At the time the hospital was one of northern Ontario&#x27;s finest. In 1988, the need for a more modern facility arose and the ultra-modern 53 bed complex was built in a different part of the town. Sensenbrenner serves a regional population of 14,000 residents. The hospital provides both in-patient and out-patient care. Clinical services include; emergency services, chronic cardiorespiratory, acute neurology, specialty clinics, general medicine, surgery, anaesthesia, obstetrics, pediatrics, chronic and long-term care, rehabilitation, and other related diagnostic and treatment services. The health care services are assessment, evaluation, screening, treatment programs and direct therapy. In 1995, the hospital built a private clinic wing near the Emergency Room.

EMS services are provided by Sensenbrenner Hospital, which is managed by the Northeastern Ontario Medical Education Corporation (NOMEC).

The Porcupine Health unit serves the town with preventive education, psychiatric services, social services and child social service.

=== Safety ===
The town operates a fire department which is a member of the Fire Marshalls of Ontario, Public Fire Safety Council.

A local branch of the Ontario Provincial Police is located at the site of the old Kapuskasing Inn.

== In popular culture ==
Kapuskasing is mentioned in the 1994 children’s book &quot;Where is Gah-Ning&quot;, by Robert Munsch. In the story, a young Chinese-Canadian girl wants to visit Kapuskasing, but her father says no. She tries to go by bicycle and later on roller blades; she finally succeeds in getting there by floating on 300 helium balloons. It is also featured in Tomson Highway&#x27;s award-winning play &quot;Dry Lips Oughta Move to Kapuskasing&quot;.
In Season 12 of &quot;&quot;, junior pro hockey player Campbell Saunders comes from Kapuskasing.

The protagonist of Alice Munro&#x27;s story &quot;Train&quot; (2012), set in the early 1960s, is hopeful when he heads for Kapuskasing: &quot;Work there, sure to be work in a lumbering town&quot;.

Canadian singer-songwriter Justin Rutledge has a song called &quot;Kapuskasing Coffee&quot; on his album &quot;Valleyheart&quot;. The album won the Juno Award for Roots &amp; Traditional Album of the Year - Solo in 2014.

<doc id="248436" wikidata="Q2251556" url="?curid=248436" title="Education in Canada">
<text>Education in Canada is for the most part provided publicly, funded and overseen by federal, provincial, and local governments. Education is within provincial jurisdiction and the curriculum is overseen by the province. Education in Canada is generally divided into primary education, followed by secondary education and post-secondary. Education in both English and French is available in most places across Canada. Canada has a large number of universities, almost all of which are publicly funded. Established in 1663, is the oldest post-secondary institution in Canada. The largest university is the University of Toronto with over 85,000 students. Four universities are regularly ranked among the top 100 world-wide, namely University of Toronto, University of British Columbia, McGill University, and McMaster University, with a total of 18 universities ranked in the top 500 worldwide.

According to a 2022 report by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), Canada is the most educated country in the world; the country ranks first worldwide in the percentage of adults having tertiary education, with over 57 percent of Canadian adults having attained at least an undergraduate college or university degree. Canada spends an average of about 5.3 percent of its GDP on education. The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than per student). , 89 percent of adults aged 25 to 64 have earned the equivalent of a high-school degree, compared to an OECD average of 75 percent.

The mandatory education age ranges between 5–7 to 16–18 years, contributing to an adult literacy rate of 99 percent. Just over 60,000 children are homeschooled in the country as of 2016. The Programme for International Student Assessment indicates Canadian students perform well above the OECD average, particularly in mathematics, science, and reading, ranking the overall knowledge and skills of Canadian 15-year-olds as the sixth-best in the world, although these scores have been declining in recent years. Canada is a well-performing OECD country in reading literacy, mathematics, and science, with the average student scoring 523.7, compared with the OECD average of 493 in 2015.

==Assessment agencies==
The Canadian Education Statistics Council (CESC) works in collaboration with provincial and territorial departments that are responsible for education and training, on the Pan-Canadian Education Indicators Program (PCEIP). The CESC includes both the Council of Ministers of Education, Canada (CMEC) and Statistics Canada. The CESC submits an annual report, &quot;Education Indicators in Canada: An International Perspective&quot;, &quot;supports the comparison of educational systems in Canada&#x27;s provinces and territories with member [OECD] countries&quot;.

The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) coordinates the Programme for International Student Assessment (PISA) that is intended to evaluate educational systems—OECD members and non-OECD members—by measuring 15-year-old school pupils&#x27; scholastic performance on mathematics, science, and reading.

==Canada-wide==
The federal government&#x27;s responsibilities in education are limited to the Canadian Military Colleges, the Canadian Coast Guard College, and funding the education of indigenous peoples; all other matters of education in Canada fall under provincial responsibility. As such, there is much variation in the management of education from province to province.

In 2016, 8.5% of men and 5.4% of women aged 25 to 34 had less than a secondary school diploma (340,000 young Canadians). In many places, publicly funded secondary school courses are offered to the adult population. The ratio of secondary school graduates versus non diploma-holders is changing rapidly, partly due to changes in the labour market that require people to have a secondary school diploma and, in many cases, a university degree. Nonetheless, in 2010, 51% of Canadians had completed a tertiary education, the highest rate in the world. The majority of schools, 67%, are co-educational.

Canada spends about 5.2% of its GDP on education in 2020. The country invests heavily in tertiary education (more than US$20,000 per student). Recent reports suggest tuition fee increases across all provinces ranging from a low of .3% in Ontario to a high of 5.7% in Alberta due to a provide-wide restructuring of fees. Since the adoption of section 23 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1982&quot;, education in both English and French has been available in most places across Canada (if the population of children speaking the minority language justifies it). French Second Language education/French Immersion is available to anglophone students across Canada. English Second Language education/English Immersion is also available in Quebec&#x27;s French language schools.

According to an announcement of Canadian Minister of Citizenship and Immigration, Canada is introducing a new, fast-track system to let foreign students and graduates with Canadian work experience become permanent eligible residents in Canada.

Most schools have introduced one or more initiatives such as programs in Native studies, antiracism, Aboriginal cultures and crafts; visits by elders and other community members; and content in areas like indigenous languages, Aboriginal spirituality, indigenous knowledge of nature, and tours to indigenous heritage sites. Although these classes are offered, most appear to be limited by the area or region in which students reside. &quot;The curriculum is designed to elicit development and quality of people&#x27;s cognition through the guiding of accommodations of individuals to their natural environment and their changing social order&quot;

Subjects that typically get assessed (i.e., language arts, mathematics, and science) assume greater importance than non-assessed subjects (i.e., music, visual arts, and physical education) or facets of the curriculum (i.e., reading and writing versus speaking and listening).

Some scholars view academics as a form of &quot;soft power&quot; helping to educate and to create positive attitudes, although there is criticism that educators are merely telling students what to think, instead of how to think for themselves, and using up a large proportion of classroom time in the process. Social promotion policies, grade inflation, lack of corrective feedback for students, teaching methods that slow the development of soft skills compared to past decades, reform mathematics, and the failure to objectively track student progress have also forced secondary schools and colleges to lower their academic standards.

According to a November 2011 &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; opinion piece, Alberta&#x27;s education system provides better results compared to other provinces, partially because of Alberta&#x27;s rigorous &quot;provincial standardized exams&quot;. According to a 2011 study by the University of Saskatchewan, Albertans have higher grades in university due to the comprehensive education compared to other provinces. Grades are also notably boosted when applying for many universities in Canada to entice Albertan students to go to those universities, such as the University of British Columbia. This also explains why the University of Alberta is quite competitive when applying with an out-of-province education.

===Divisions by religion and language===
The Constitution of Canada provides constitutional protections for some types of publicly funded religious-based and language-based school systems.

Section 93 of the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot; contains a guarantee for publicly funded religious-based separate schools, provided the separate schools were established by law prior to the province joining Confederation. Court cases have established that this provision did not apply to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick, Manitoba, British Columbia, and Prince Edward Island, since those provinces did not provide a legal guarantee for separate schools prior to Confederation. The provision did originally apply to Ontario, Quebec, Saskatchewan, Alberta, and Newfoundland and Labrador, since these provinces did have pre-existing separate schools. This constitutional provision was repealed for Quebec by a constitutional amendment in 1997, and for Newfoundland and Labrador in 1998. The constitutional provision continues to apply to Ontario, Saskatchewan, and Alberta. There is a similar federal statutory provision that applies to the Northwest Territories. The issue of separate schools is also addressed in Section 29 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot;, which reaffirms the rights of separate schools found in the &quot;Constitution Act, 1867&quot;.

Section 23(1)(b) of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; guarantees the right of citizens who were educated in the minority language in a particular province to have their children educated in the minority language in publicly funded schools. In practice, this guarantee means that there are publicly funded English schools in Quebec, and publicly funded French schools in the other provinces and the territories.

Quebec students must attend a French school up until the end of secondary school unless one of their parents qualifies as a rights-holder under s. 23(1)(b) of the Charter. In Ontario, French-language schools automatically admit students recognized under section 23 of the &quot;Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; and may admit non-francophone students through the board&#x27;s admissions committee consisting of the school principal, a school superintendent, and a teacher.

An example of how schools can be divided by language and religion is visible in Toronto, which has four public school boards operating in the city. They include two English first language school boards, the separate Toronto Catholic District School Board and secular Toronto District School Board; and two French boards, the separate Conseil scolaire catholique MonAvenir and secular Conseil scolaire Viamonde.

===Length of study===
As education is a provincial matter, the length of study varies depending on the province, although the majority of public early childhood, elementary, and secondary education programs in Canada begin in kindergarten (age five typically by 31 December of that school year) and end after Grade 12 (age 17 by 31 December). After completion of a secondary school diploma, students may go on to post-secondary studies.

Exceptions to the aforementioned length of study include the provinces of Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec, as well as the Northwest Territories. As opposed to the other provinces, the Kindergarten programs in the Northwest Territories, Nova Scotia, Ontario, and Quebec consist of two years, with the first year open to students age four by 31 December. Ontario established its Junior Kindergarten program in the early 1940s. In 2016, the Government of Nova Scotia announced an expansion of its Pre-Primary program to be made available throughout the province by 2020. Implementation of Junior Kindergarten began in the Northwest Territories during the 2017–18 school year, an expansion of an earlier pilot project in several smaller communities in the territory. In 2019, the Government of Quebec announced the creation of kindergarten classes for four-year-olds in the province&#x27;s elementary schools. The length of study at the secondary level also differs in Quebec, with the final grade of secondary schools in the province being Grade 11/&quot;Secondaire V&quot;.

Conversely, in Ontario, a student may choose to lengthen their period of study in a secondary school for an additional number of years, colloquially referred to as a victory lap. From 1989 to 2003, secondary education in Ontario formally included a fifth year (intended for students preparing for post-secondary education), known as the Ontario Academic Credit (age 18 by 31 December). Prior to 1989 Ontario secondary schools included Grade 13 (leading to the Secondary School Honours Graduation Diploma). Although OAC was phased out in 2003, a study in 2010 published by academics with Lakehead University noted that the province was only partially successful in its efforts, with a significant minority of students opting to take a fifth year. Approximately 14 per cent of students in Ontario opted to take a fifth year as late as 2012. In September 2013, the Government of Ontario introduced a 34-credit threshold (30 credits is required for the Ontario Secondary School Diploma) in an effort to limit the length of study for its secondary school students and reduce the financial burden from students returning for a fifth year. A &quot;resident pupil&quot; of Ontario has the right to attend a public secondary school until they&#x27;ve received their 34th-course credit, attended the school for seven years, or are age 20 and have not been in a school in the last four years, after which the secondary school reserves the right to refuse further admission to the student.

While the period of study in Canada begins as early as four years old, the age where a child&#x27;s attendance becomes mandatory varies among the provinces and territories, ranging from ages five to seven. Children who turn five by 31 December are required to begin schooling in British Columbia, New Brunswick, Nova Scotia, and Yukon; although parents are able to apply for a deferment. In Alberta, Newfoundland and Labrador, the Northwest Territories, Ontario, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec, a child is required to attend school at the age of six. Manitoba and Saskatchewan are the only provinces where the minimum compulsory attendance age is seven. Attendance in school is compulsory up to the age of 16 in all provinces except Manitoba, New Brunswick, and Ontario, where attendance is compulsory until the student turns 18, or as soon as a secondary school diploma has been achieved.

===Authorities===
Normally, for each type of publicly funded school (such as Public English or Public French), the province is divided into districts (or divisions). For each district, board members (trustees) are elected only by its supporters within the district (voters receive a ballot for just one of the boards in their area). Normally, all publicly funded schools are under the authority of their local district school board. These school boards would follow a common curriculum set up by the province the board resides in. Only Alberta allows public charter schools, which are independent of any district board. Instead, they each have their own board, which reports directly to the province.

==History==
==Primary and secondary education==
Primary, intermediate, and secondary education combined are sometimes referred to as K-12 (Kindergarten through Grade 12). Secondary schooling, known as high school, collegiate institute, &quot;école secondaire&quot; or secondary school, consists of different grades depending on the province in which one resides. Furthermore, grade structure may vary within a province or even within a school division; as to whether or not they operate middle or junior high schools.

Kindergarten programs are available for children in all provinces in Canada and are typically offered as one-year programs for students who turn five in that year. However, the provinces of Nova Scotia, the Northwest Territories, Ontario, and Quebec operate two-year kindergarten programs, with the first year beginning at the age of four. The names of these programs, provincial funding, and the number of hours provided varies. For example, the Department of Education in Nova Scotia refers to Kindergarten as Grade Primary. Full-day kindergarten programs are offered in all provinces except Alberta, Manitoba, Nunavut, Saskatchewan, and Yukon. Students in the Prairie provinces are not required by statute to attend kindergarten. As a result, kindergarten often is not available in smaller towns.

Since the 1940s, Ontario&#x27;s kindergarten program has consisted of two years: junior kindergarten for four–five-year-olds and senior kindergarten for five–six-year-olds. At Francophone schools in Ontario, these programs are called &quot;Maternelle&quot; and &quot;Jardin&quot;. In 2017, Nova Scotia began to implement a kindergarten program (pre-primary, starting at age four), with provincial-wide service available since 2020. In 2017, the Northwest Territories introduced its junior kindergarten program throughout the territory. Quebec offers subsidized preschool programs and introduced an early kindergarten program for children from low-income families in 2013.

Grade 12 presently serves as the final grade in all provincial secondary curriculums, except Quebec, whose secondary schools ends after Secondary V/Grade 11 (age 16 by September 30, Quebec cut off date is earlier); after which students who wish to pursue further studies may attend a post-secondary institution. Quebec is currently the only province where it treats Grade 12 as a part of the tertiary level of education. Grade 11 also served as the end of secondary education in Newfoundland and Labrador, until the province implemented Grade 12 in 1983. Conversely, from 1921 to 2003, Ontario&#x27;s secondary curriculum lasted a year longer, with secondary schooling ending after Grade 13/Ontario Academic Credit (OAC). Grade 13 was reformed into OAC in 1988, and was offered in secondary schools until 2003, after which the grade was discontinued. A number of Canadian secondary schools offer the International Baccalaureate Program (IB) and Advanced Placement (AP) program. These courses prepare students for first-year university learning and can be used to replace or supplement existing courses in the curriculum. Many universities and colleges across North America offer advanced credits to students who excel in International Baccalaureate and Advanced Placement courses.

Students may continue to receive publicly funded secondary schooling until the ages of 19 to 21 (the cut-off age for secondary school varies between provinces). Depending on the province, those who are the age of majority may continue to attend a standard secondary school, or may be required to attend an adult high school.

Students of secondary school age who have received long-term suspensions or have been expelled, or are otherwise unable or unwilling to attend conventional schools may be offered alternative learning options to complete their secondary education, such as drop-in programs, night school, or distance/online classes. An increasing number of international students are attending pre-tertiary courses at Canadian secondary schools.

==Tertiary education==
Post-secondary education in Canada is provided by universities (research universities, undergraduate universities, and university colleges) and vocational institutions (vocational colleges, career colleges, community colleges, institutes of technology or science, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec, collèges d’enseignement général et professionnel). Universities offer bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, professional, and doctoral degrees as well as post-graduate certificates and diplomas while vocational institutions issue diplomas, associate degrees, certificates, and apprenticeships. Vocational institutions offer career-focused training that is often practical where these institutions train their graduates to work as semi-professionals in various fields such as the skilled trades and technical careers and for workers in support roles in professions such as engineering, information technology, accountancy, business administration, health care, architecture, and law. University colleges and vocational institutions also offer degree programs where a student can take courses and receive credit that can be transferred to a university.

Nearly all post-secondary institutions in Canada have the authority to confer academic credentials (i.e., diplomas or degrees). Generally speaking, universities confer degrees (e.g., bachelor&#x27;s, master&#x27;s, professional or doctorate degrees) while colleges, which typically offer vocationally oriented programs, confer diplomas, associate degrees, and certificates. However, some colleges offer applied arts degrees that lead to or are equivalent to degrees from a university. Private career colleges are overseen by legislative acts for each province. For example, in British Columbia training providers will be registered and accredited with the (PCTIA) Private Career Training Institutions Agency regulated under the &quot;Private Career Training Institutions Act&quot; (SBC 2003) Each province has its own equivalent agency. Unlike the United States, there is no &quot;accreditation body&quot; that oversees the universities in Canada. Universities in Canada have degree-granting authority via an Act or Ministerial Consent from the Ministry of Education of the particular province. Tertiary and post-secondary education in Canada is also the responsibility of the individual provinces and territories. Those governments provide the majority of funding to their public post-secondary institutions, with the remainder of funding coming from tuition fees, the federal government, and research grants. Compared to other countries in the past, Canada has had the highest tertiary school enrolment as a percentage of their graduating population.

===University===

The traditional path to Canadian higher education is typically through university, as it is by far the most prestigious form of higher education in the country. There is no universally prescribed set definition to what constitutes a &quot;university&quot; in Canada as they come in various forms that serve the different educational needs of various Canadians. Each province has its own legislative meaning of the term but universities do intersect in terms of the types of degrees that they offer, research, competitiveness, location, and global institutional reputation. Canadian universities require students&#x27; senior secondary school transcript along with an application for admission. Admissions criteria to a university in Canada involve the grades earned in core senior secondary school courses taken, and an admission GPA based on their senior secondary school courses calculated in the form of a percentage. Applications for admission outline additional academic and extra-curricular achievements that cannot be expressed through a student&#x27;s secondary school transcript. In the case of more prestigious and selective university programs, an essay, statement of intent, or personal statement of experience must be submitted directly to the university. In addition, letters of reference, examples of extracurricular activities, volunteering and community service endeavors, athletic participation, student awards, and scholarships are also required for acceptance to some of Canada&#x27;s most prestigious university programs. Generally, Canadian universities base admission with great weight emphasized around a student&#x27;s academic performance in core senior secondary school courses taken during their grade 11 and 12 years as a measure of academic rigor in addition to assessing a prospective students capability to challenge themselves as predictors of future academic performance at the university level. In addition, most universities in Canada also denote a standardized GPA or an admission average cutoff. This admissions cut off is established based on the competitiveness of applicants applying to individual programs offered at specific universities. A typical competitive program at an esteemed Canadian university could have an admissions cutoff of 90 per cent or higher, while mid-tier universities have programs that maintain cut-offs around 80 per cent. Lower tier and lesser-known Canadian universities with more liberal application processes could have admission cut offs as low as 65 to 70 per cent.

Among the country&#x27;s most prominent institutions are research universities that are domestically and internationally ranked such as the University of Toronto, McGill University, and the University of British Columbia. Other types of universities across Canada include denomination universities (e.g., Redeemer University College, Yorkville University), undergraduate universities (e.g., Acadia University, MacEwan University, Mount Saint Vincent University, St. Francis Xavier University, University of Winnipeg, Wilfrid Laurier University), liberal arts colleges (e.g., University of Lethbridge, Bishop&#x27;s University, Mount Allison University, Nipissing University, St. Thomas University, Trinity Western University), art schools (Alberta University of the Arts, Emily Carr University of Art and Design, LaSalle College Vancouver, Nova Scotia College of Art and Design, Ontario College of Art and Design, Vancouver College of Art and Design), online universities with distance education (Athabasca University, University of Fredericton), and military schools (Royal Military College of Canada, which is the military academy of the Canadian Forces, a full degree-granting university, and the only federal institution in Canada with degree-granting powers) as well as institutions that serve people in more rural and remote parts of the country such as Brandon University, Royal Roads University, Thompson Rivers University, the University of Northern British Columbia, University of Prince Edward Island, University of the Fraser Valley, and Vancouver Island University.

The quality of universities in Canada is internationally recognized and is home to some of the top universities in the world making it a global leader in scientific and technological research and adducing the delivery of higher education to promising Canadian students and prospective international students around the world. Canadian universities have placed in several international post-secondary rankings, with the &quot;Academic Ranking of World Universities&quot; including 30 Canadian universities in its 2025 rankings, &quot;QS World University Rankings&quot; and the &quot;Times Higher Education World University Rankings&quot; including 31 Canadian universities in their 2023 rankings, and the &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report Best Global University Ranking&quot; including 39 Canadian universities in its 2023 rankings.

===Vocational===
Vocational education in Canada is delivered through vocational colleges, career colleges, community colleges, institutes of technology or science, technical schools, colleges of applied arts or applied technology, and in Quebec through collèges d’enseignement général et professionnel. Though it is cheaper in terms of tuition, less competitive to get into, and not as prestigious as going to a four-year university, vocational schools adduce another post-secondary option for students seeking to enter higher education. Admissions to vocational schools in Canada have requirements that are less stringent than a university and vary more significantly but, unlike universities, qualifications and entrance standards into vocational institutions are more lax as they do not delineate admission cut-offs so as long as students meet the minimum average requirements and possess the prerequisite courses, they can gain admission to most vocational institutions across the country. Many vocational institutes such as George Brown College and Mohawk College accept a very high proportion of students with averages above 70 per cent, although they may place no limiting minimum for acceptance, and consequently take students with averages below 60 per cent.

The typical Canadian vocational institute is analogous to that of an American junior college or community college where they offer specialized vocational oriented certifications in an area of training. However, there are some institutions in Canada that offer both vocational training as well as a limited number of 4-year undergraduate university degrees such as Seneca College, Sheridan College, Centennial College of Applied Arts and Technology, Kwantlen Polytechnic University, Vancouver Island University, and Thompson Rivers University. There are over 200 community colleges in Canada. They are often found in remote and rural parts of the country.

Post-secondary vocational institutions in Canada offer apprenticeships, certificates, diplomas, and associate degrees. These are programs that offer specialized vocational education in specific employment fields related to the skilled trades and technical careers which generally last two years. In studying at a vocational school, a student can take the necessary courses needed to earn a certification that will allow for entry into jobs (such as becoming a beautician, licensed practical nurse, drafter, web developer, computer network support specialist, paralegal, medical laboratory technician, cardiovascular technologist, optician, or diagnostic medical sonographer, healthcare assistant etc.) requiring some level of tertiary education but not a full four-year university degree. After graduating from a vocational institution, some students continue their education by transferring to a university to complete a bachelor&#x27;s degree, while others choose to enter the workforce. Apprenticeships are another form of post-secondary vocational education training in Canada, as students combine in-class instruction of theoretical principles with practical workforce training for careers related to the skilled trades. In addition, a series of exams have to be passed before the student is certified as a journeyperson. Skilled trades programs in Canada typically take four years to complete and, once the final level is successfully finished, the person is conferred a trades certificate and can become eligible to work anywhere in the country, provided they pass a series of tests known as the Red Seal exams.

==Private schools==
About 6% of Canadian grade ten students are in private schools, most of which are in Quebec. A Statistics Canada study from 2015 found that these students tend to have higher test scores and future educational attainment than their public school counterparts. Rather than enjoying superior resources and educational practices, the most likely explanation for this discrepancy is the higher expectation of success that students experience from their parents, teachers, and fellow students.

===Private universities===
In the past, private universities in Canada maintained a religious history or foundation. However, since 1999, the Province of New Brunswick passed the &quot;Degree Granting Act&quot; allowing private universities to operate in the Province. The University of Fredericton is the newest university to receive designation in New Brunswick.

Trinity Western University, in Langley British Columbia, was founded in 1962 as a junior college and received full accreditation in 1985. In 2002, British Columbia&#x27;s Quest University became the first privately funded liberal arts university without a denominational affiliation (although it is not the first private liberal arts university). Many provinces, including Ontario and Alberta, have passed legislation allowing private degree-granting institutions (not necessarily universities) to operate there.

Many Canadians remain polarized on the issue of permitting private universities into the Canadian market. On the one hand, Canada&#x27;s top universities find it difficult to compete with the private American powerhouses because of funding, but, on the other hand, the fact that the price of private universities tends to exclude those who cannot pay that much for their education could prevent a significant portion of Canada&#x27;s population from being able to attend these schools.

In addition to the issue of access, some Canadians take issue with protections instituted within the &quot;Charter of Rights and Freedoms&quot; as ruled by the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 and consistent with federal and provincial law that (private) faith-based universities in Canada based on the long-established principles of freedom of conscience and religion can exempt themselves from more recent human rights legislation when they insist in their &quot;community covenant&quot; code signed by staff, faculty and students that they act in accordance with the faith of the school. The covenant may require restraint from those acts considered in contradiction with the tenets of their faith such as homosexual relationships, sex outside marriage or more broadly abstain from consuming alcohol on campus or viewing pornography. However, private-Christian based schools do not preclude homosexual or lesbian students from attending. Some faith-based universities have been known to fire staff and faculty which refused to adhere or whose actions were in opposition with the tenets of the faith, although in some provinces, their dismissals have been successfully challenged in court based on the circumstances.

===Religious schools===
Each province deals differently with private religious schools. In Ontario, the Catholic system continues to be fully publicly funded while other faiths are not. Ontario has several private Islamic, Christian and Jewish schools all funded through tuition fees. Since the Catholic schools system is entrenched in the constitution, the Supreme Court has ruled that this system is constitutional. However, the United Nations Human Rights Committee has ruled that Ontario&#x27;s system is discriminatory, suggesting that Ontario either fund no faith-based schools, or all of them. In 2002 the government of Mike Harris introduced a controversial program to partially fund all private schools, but this was criticized for undermining the public education system and the program was eliminated after the Liberals won the 2003 provincial election.

In other provinces, privately operated religious schools are funded. In British Columbia the government pays independent schools that meet rigorous provincial standards up to 50% of the per-student operating cost of public schools. The province has a number of Sikh, Hindu, Christian, and Islamic schools. Alberta also has a network of charter schools, which are fully funded schools offering distinct approaches to education within the public school system. Alberta charter schools are not private and the province does not grant charters to religious schools. These schools have to follow the provincial curriculum and meet all standards but are given considerable freedom in other areas. In all other provinces, private religious schools receive some funding, but not as much as the public system.

==Levels in education==
As the education system in Canada is managed by the varying provincial governments in Canada, the way the educational stages are grouped and named may differ from each region, or even between districts and individual schools. The ages are the age of the students when they end the school year in June.

*Early childhood education
**CPE Pre-school (French: &quot;Garderie&quot; or &quot;Jardin&quot;), Pre-Kindergarten, Pre-Primary or Junior Kindergarten (JK, ages 3–5 average age 4) (Nova Scotia and Ontario)
**Grade Primary, Senior Kindergarten or Kindergarten (French: &quot;Maternelle)&quot; (SK, ages 4–6 average age 5)
*Elementary education
**Grade 1 (ages 5–7, average age 6), they start in the calendar year when they turn 6 (For example, someone born in July would be the average and be 6 all of grade 1, while someone born in December will be 5 when they start grade 1 and turn 6 during grade 1 and be one of the youngest while someone born in January will start grade 1 at age 6 and turn 7 during grade 1 and be one of the oldest.)
**Grade 2 (ages 6–8 average age 7), 
**Grade 3 (ages 7–9 average age 8)
**Grade 4 (ages 8–10 average age 9)
**Grade 5 (ages 9–11 average age 10 )
**Grade 6 (ages 10–12 average age 11)
*Intermediate education
**Grade 7 (ages 11–13 average age 12) (Secondary School starts here in Quebec)
**Grade 8 (ages 12–14 average age 13) (in some parts of B.C. high school starts in Grade 8)
**Grade 9 (ages 13–15 average age 14)
*Secondary education
**Grade 10 (ages 14–16 average age 15)
**Grade 11 (ages 15–17 average age 16) (Secondary education in Quebec stops here)
**Grade 12 (ages 16–18 average age 17) 
*Tertiary education
**College: In Canada, the term college usually refers to a community college or a technical, applied arts, or applied science school. These are post-secondary institutions granting certificates, diplomas and, in some cases, bachelor&#x27;s degrees. In Quebec, a diploma is also required from a college (CEGEP) to attend university and take the following forms:
***Pre-university program, two years (typically Social Sciences, Natural Sciences, or Arts)
***Professional program, three years (e.g. Paralegal, Dental Hygienist, Nursing, etc.)
**University: A university is an institution of higher education and research, which grants academic degrees in a variety of subjects. A university provides undergraduate (bachelor&#x27;s degree), graduate (master&#x27;s degree), and postgraduate (Ph.D.) education.
**Graduate (or postgraduate)
***One or two years leading to a master&#x27;s degree.
***Three or more years leading to a doctoral degree.

===Grade structure by province===
The following table shows how grades are organized in various provinces. Often, there will be exceptions within each province, both with terminology for groups, and which grades apply to each group.

Notes:
*In British Columbia some schools may group together the higher Elementary and lower Secondary Grades. These schools are referred to as Middle Schools or Jr. Secondary Schools. Some Elementary Schools consist solely of grades K–5. Likewise, some Secondary Schools may only have grades 11 and 12. In addition, some school districts including Vancouver may use just elementary (K–7) and secondary (8–12) schools. British Columbia informally subcategorizes the Elementary level into &quot;Primary&quot; (K–3) and &quot;Intermediate&quot; (4–6 or 7).
*In Ontario, the terms used in French schooling consist of &quot;Maternelle&quot; in regard to Junior Kindergarten and &quot;Jardin&quot; in regard to Kindergarten. This differs from Quebec&#x27;s &quot;Maternelle&quot;, which is the equivalent of Ontario&#x27;s Kindergarten.
*In Manitoba, grade 9 to grade 12 was for a short time referred to as Senior 1 to Senior 4.
*In Newfoundland and Labrador, Level IV is used to collect missed grades that prevented a student from getting their graduation.
*In Nova Scotia the terms for groups, and grades they apply to varies significantly throughout the province. A common, but not universal, organization is shown.
*In Quebec college is two or three years, depending on what a student selects, based usually on what their post-secondary plans are. College in Quebec overlaps what other provinces consider the boundary between secondary education (high school) and post-secondary education (college and university). E.g. &quot;Sec I&quot; = &quot;Secondary Year One&quot; = &quot;Grade 7&quot;
*In Yellowknife, Northwest Territories, schools are now set up as elementary schools with grades K-5, middle schools with grades 6–8, and high schools with grades 9–12; however, high school graduation requirements only include courses taken in grades 10–12.
*In Saskatchewan Elementary school is most often from K–8 and high school from 9–12. High school graduation requirements only taken grades 10–12 and require 24 credits to graduate.

<text>The University of Massachusetts Amherst (UMass Amherst) is a public land-grant research university in Amherst, Massachusetts, United States. It is the flagship campus of the University of Massachusetts system, and was founded in 1863 as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. It is also a member of the Five College Consortium, along with four other colleges in the Pioneer Valley.

UMass Amherst has the largest undergraduate population in Massachusetts with roughly 24,000 enrolled undergraduates. The university offers academic degrees in 109 undergraduate, 77 master&#x27;s, and 48 doctoral programs. Programs are coordinated in nine schools and colleges. It is classified among &quot;R1: Doctoral Universities – Very high research activity&quot;. According to the National Science Foundation, the university spent $211 million on research and development in 2018.

The university&#x27;s 21 varsity athletic teams compete in NCAA Division I and are collectively known as the Minutemen and Minutewomen. The university is a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference while playing ice hockey in Hockey East and football as an FBS independent school. In July 2025 UMass will join the Mid American Conference as a full member, retaining affiliate status in sports where the MAC does not compete.

==History==
===Foundation and early years===
The university was founded in 1863 under the provisions of the Federal Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act to provide instruction to Massachusetts citizens in &quot;agricultural, mechanical, and military arts.&quot; Accordingly, the university was initially named the Massachusetts Agricultural College. In 1867, the college had yet to admit any students and had not completed any buildings but had been through two presidents. That same year, William S. Clark was appointed president of the college and professor of botany. He appointed a faculty, coordinated the completion of construction, and, in the fall of 1867, welcomed the first class of approximately 50 students. Clark became the first president to serve long-term after the school&#x27;s opening. Of the school&#x27;s founding figures, there are a traditional &quot;founding four&quot; – Clark, Levi Stockbridge, Charles Goessmann, and Henry Hill Goodell.The original buildings consisted of Old South College, North College, the Chemistry Laboratory, the Boarding House, the Botanic Museum, and the Durfee Plant House.

The fledgling college grew under the leadership of President Henry Hill Goodell. In the 1880s, Goodell implemented an expansion plan, adding the College Drill Hall in 1883, the Old Chapel Library in 1885, and the East and West Experiment Stations in 1886 and 1890.

The early 20th century saw expansion in enrollment and curriculum. The first female student was admitted in 1875 on a part-time basis and the first full-time female student was admitted in 1892. In 1903, Draper Hall was constructed for the dual purpose of a dining hall and female housing. The first female students graduated with the class of 1905. The first dedicated female dormitory, the Abigail Adams House (on the site of today&#x27;s Lederle Tower), was built in 1920.

===Modern era===
By the 1970s, the University continued to grow and gave rise to a shuttle bus service on campus as well as many other architectural additions; this included the Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center complete with a hotel, office space, fine dining restaurant, campus store, and passageway to the parking garage, the W. E. B. Du Bois Library, and the Fine Arts Center. 

Over the next two decades, the John W. Lederle Graduate Research Center and the Conte National Polymer Research Center were built and UMass Amherst emerged as a major research facility. The Robsham Memorial Center for Visitors welcomed thousands of guests to campus after its dedication in 1989. For athletic and other large events, the Mullins Center was opened in 1993.

===21st century===
In 2003, Massachusetts State Legislature designated the University of Massachusetts Amherst as a research university and the &quot;flagship campus of the University of Massachusetts system&quot;. The university was named a top producer of Fulbright Award winners in the 2008–2009 academic year. Additionally, in 2010, it was named one of the &quot;Top Colleges and Universities Contributing to Teach For America&#x27;s 2010 Teaching Corps.&quot;

From World War II to 2023, the imagery on the official seal of the university was nearly identical to the state flag of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. That image of the seal has been slowly removed starting in 2011, until March 2023 when a new image of the seal, featuring a profile of the Old Chapel spire, was ratified by the campus.

==Organization and administration==
===Colleges and schools===
Since the University of Massachusetts Amherst was founded as the Massachusetts Agricultural College in 1863, 25 individuals have been at the helm of the institution. Originally, the chief executive of UMass Amherst was a president. When UMass Boston was founded in 1963, it was initially reckoned as an off-site department of the Amherst campus and was headed by a chancellor who reported to the president. A 1970 reorganization transferred day-to-day responsibility for UMass Amherst to a chancellor as well, with both chancellors reporting on an equal basis to the president. The title &quot;President of the University of Massachusetts&quot; now refers to the chief executive of the entire five-campus University of Massachusetts system.

The current Chancellor of the Amherst campus is Javier Reyes. The Chancellor resides in Hillside, the campus residence for chancellors. Reyes is the first person of Hispanic descent to serve as Chancellor of the university.

There are approximately 1,300 full-time faculty at the university. The university is organized into nine schools and colleges and offers 111 bachelor&#x27;s degrees, 75 master&#x27;s degrees, and 47 doctoral degrees.

==Academics==
===Rankings and reputation===
&quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot;″s 2025 edition of America&#x27;s Best Colleges ranked UMass Amherst tied for 58th on their list of &quot;Best National Universities&quot;, and tied for 26th among 225 public universities in the U.S. UMass Amherst is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education.

===Commonwealth Honors College===
Commonwealth Honors College at UMass provides students the opportunity to intensify their UMass academic curriculum. Membership in the honors college is not required to graduate from the University with designations such as &quot;magna&quot; or &quot;summa cum laude&quot;. In 2013, the University completed the Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community (CHCRC) on campus to serve the college, including classrooms, administration, and housing for 1,500 students and some faculty.

===Five College Consortium===
UMass Amherst is part of the Five Colleges Consortium, which allows its students to attend classes, borrow books, work with professors, etc., at four other Pioneer Valley institutions: Amherst, Hampshire, Mount Holyoke, and Smith Colleges.

UMass Amherst holds the license for WFCR, the National Public Radio affiliate for Western Massachusetts. In 2014, the station moved its main operations to the Fuller Building on Main Street in Springfield, but retained some offices in Hampshire House on the UMass campus.

===Community service===
The Community Engagement Program (CEP) offers courses that combine classroom learning and community service. Co-curricular service programs include the Alternative Spring Break, Engineers without Borders, the Legal Studies Civil Rights Clinical Project, the Medical Reserve Corps, Alpha Phi Omega, the Red Cross Club, the Rotaract Club, UCAN Volunteer, and the Veterans and Service Members Association (VSMA).

The White House has named UMass Amherst to the President&#x27;s Higher Education Community Service Honor Roll for four consecutive years, in recognition of its commitment to volunteering, service learning, and civic engagement. They have also been named a &quot;Community-Engaged University&quot; by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching.

===Research===

UMass research activities totaled more than $200 million in fiscal year 2014 ($ in today&#x27;s money). In 2016, the faculty adopted an open-access policy to make its scholarship publicly accessible online.

A team of scientists at UMass led by Vincent Rotello has developed a molecular nose that can detect and identify various proteins. The research appeared in the May 2007 issue of Nature Nanotechnology, and the team is currently focusing on sensors, which will detect malformed proteins made by cancer cells.
Also, UMass Amherst scientists Richard Farris, Todd Emrick, and Bryan Coughlin led a research team that developed a synthetic polymer that does not burn. This polymer is a building block of plastic, and the new flame-retardant plastic will not need to have flame-retarding chemicals added to its composition. These chemicals have recently been found in many different areas from homes and offices to fish, and there are environmental and health concerns regarding the additives. The newly developed polymers would not require the addition of potentially hazardous chemicals.

=== Admissions and enrollment ===
In 2012, the university reported that applications to the school had more than doubled since the Fall of 2003 and increased more than 80% since 2005.

The incoming Class of 2022 had an average high school GPA of 3.90 out of a 4.0 weighted scale, up from an average GPA of 3.83 the year before. The average SAT score of the Class of 2022 was 1294/1600, and on average the students ranked in the top fifth of their high school class. Acceptance to the Commonwealth Honors College program of UMass Amherst is more selective with an average SAT score of 1409/1600 and an average weighted high school GPA of 4.29.

== Campus ==


The University&#x27;s campus is situated on 1,450 acres of historically Pocumtuc land, mainly in the town of Amherst, but also partly in the neighboring town of Hadley. The campus extends about from the Campus Center in all directions and may be thought of as a series of concentric rings, with the innermost ring harboring academic buildings and research labs, surrounded by a ring of the seven residential areas and two university-owned apartment complexes. These include North Apartments, Sylvan, Northeast, Central, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Commonwealth Honors College Residential Complex., The two university-owned apartment complexes, North Village and Lincoln Apartments were demolished. They were replaced by a private development called Fieldstone on the former Lincoln Apts. site for undergraduate and graduate students and university owned apartments for family housing called University Village on the former North Village site . These are in turn surrounded by a ring of athletic facilities, smaller administration buildings, and parking lots.

===Libraries===
The W.E.B. Du Bois Library is one of two library buildings on campus and the tallest academic research library in the world, standing 26 stories above ground and 286 feet (90.32 m) tall. Before its construction in the late 1960s, Goodell Hall was the University library, which was built after the library had outgrown its space in the 1885 &quot;Old Chapel&quot; building. Originally known as Goodell Library, the building was named for Henry H. Goodell, who had served as College Librarian, Professor of Modern Languages and English Literature, and eighth President of the Massachusetts Agricultural College. The Library is well regarded for its innovative architectural design, which incorporates the bookshelves into the structural support of the building. It is home of the memoirs and papers of the distinguished African-American activist and Massachusetts native W. E. B. Du Bois, as well as being the depository for other important collections, such as the papers of the late Congressman Silvio O. Conte. The library&#x27;s special collections include works on movements for social change, African American history and culture, labor and industry, literature and the arts, agriculture, and the history of the surrounding region.

The Science and Engineering Library is the other library building, located in the Lederle Graduate Research Center Lowrise.

UMass is also home to the DEFA Film Library, the only archive and study collection of East German films outside of Europe. It was founded in 1993 by Barton Byg, professor of film and German Studies, and so named after the Deutsche-Film Aktiengesellschaft, the East German film company founded in 1946. Some years after German reunification, in 1997, an agreement with two German partners led to the creation of a collection of East German film journals along with a large collection of 16mm and 35mm prints of DEFA films. More have been added since.

The Shirley Graham Du Bois Library and Study Center is located in the New Africa House.

===Other buildings and facilities===
The university has several buildings (constructed in the 1960s and 1970s) of importance in the modernist style, including the Murray D. Lincoln Campus Center and Hotel designed by Marcel Breuer, the Southwest Residential Area designed by Hugh Stubbins Jr. of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, The Fine Arts Center by Kevin Roche, the W.E.B. Du Bois Library by Edward Durell Stone, and Warren McGuirk Alumni Stadium by Gordon Bunshaft. Many of the older dorms and lecture halls are built in a Georgian Revival style such as French Hall, Fernald Hall, Stockbridge Hall, and Flint Laboratory.

The campus facilities underwent extensive renovations during the late 1990s. New and newly renovated facilities include student apartment complexes, the Hampshire Dining Commons, a library Learning Commons, a School of Management, an Integrated Science Building, a Nursing Building, a Studio Arts Building, the Combined Heat and Power (CHP) generation facility, a track facility, and a Recreation Center. Newly completed construction projects on campus include the new Campus Police Station, the George N. Parks Minuteman Marching Band Building, the Life Sciences Laboratories, and the Integrated Learning Center.

=== Residential life ===
Residential Life at the University of Massachusetts Amherst is one of the largest on-campus housing systems in the United States. Over 14,000 students live in 52 residence halls, while families, staff, and graduate students live in 345 units in two apartment complexes (North Village and Lincoln). The fifty-two residence halls and four undergraduate apartment buildings are grouped into seven separate and very different residential areas: Central, Northeast, Orchard Hill, Southwest, Sylvan, North Apartments, and the Commonwealth Honors College Residential Community (CHCRC).

Located in the central corridor of campus, the Honors Community houses undergraduate members of Commonwealth Honors College.

===Major campus expansion===
The University of Massachusetts Amherst campus embarked on a 10-year, $1 billion ($ in today&#x27;s money) capital improvement program in 2004, setting the stage for re-visioning the campus&#x27;s future. This includes construction of $156 million New Science Laboratory Building, $30 million Champions Basketball Center, an $85 million academic building, and $30 million in renovations to the football stadium.

In early 2016, the construction of a new electrical substation located near Tillson Farm was completed. The purpose of the substation is to supply electricity to the university more efficiently and reliably, with estimated savings of $1 million per year ($ in today&#x27;s money). The project was created in partnership with the utilities company Eversource, and cost approximately $26 million ($ in today&#x27;s money).

In April 2017, the University of Massachusetts Amherst officially opened its new Design Building. Previously estimated at $50 million ($ in today&#x27;s money) the facility is the most advanced CLT building in the United States and the largest modern wood building in the northeastern United States.

===Mount Ida Campus of UMass Amherst===
Mount Ida Campus at UMass Amherst primarily serves as a hub for Greater Boston-area career preparation and experiential learning opportunities for UMass Amherst students. The campus exists to connect UMass Amherst, located approximately 94 miles west of Boston, to the Greater Boston business community. It also serves as a secondary instructional site for UMass Amherst, offering an undergraduate program in Veterinary Technology, graduate programs in Statistics and Business and Analytics, as well as graduate courses in Geographic Information Science and Technology. Programs offered align the strengths of UMass Amherst with the growing demand for talent in areas that drive the Massachusetts economy, including health care, business, computer science, and other STEM specialties

On April 6, 2018, Mount Ida College announced that it would shut down and the University of Massachusetts would be absorbing its campus. Mount Ida students were given a guaranteed transfer to UMass Dartmouth, and the campus became part of UMass Amherst.

===Campus safety===
Campus safety features include controlled dormitory access, emergency telephones, lighted sidewalks, and 24-hour campus police patrols on feet and by vehicle.

Riots occurred after the Boston Red Sox lost the 1986 World Series, won in 2004 and 2007, after the Red Sox were eliminated in the 2003 and 2008 playoffs, after UMass&#x27; football team lost in the Division I-AA football championship game in 2006 and after the Patriots first Super Bowl victory over St. Louis in Super Bowl XXXVI. The majority of these riots have been non-violent on the side of the students, except for the 1986 riot in which an argument between hundreds of students intensified into racial altercations where a black student was attacked and beaten to unconsciousness by 15 to 20 white students according to archives from &quot;The Republican&quot;. In the wake of these events, students have worked to have open dialogues with the administration and police department about campus safety, the right to gather, the police force, and better methods of crowd control.

===Iranian student admissions controversy===
UMass Amherst issued an announcement in early 2015 stating, &quot;The University has determined that it will no longer admit Iranian national students to specific programs in the College of Engineering (i.e., Chemical Engineering, Electrical &amp; Computer Engineering, Mechanical &amp; Industrial Engineering) and in the College of Natural Sciences (i.e., Physics, Chemistry, Microbiology, and Polymer Science &amp; Engineering) effective February 1, 2015.&quot; The University claims that this announcement was posted because a graduate student entered Iran for a project and was later denied a visa. This event along with urging from legal advisers contributed to the belief that such incidents inhibited their ability to give Iranian students a &quot;full program of education and research for Iranian students&quot; and thus justified changing their admissions policies. The ensuing criticism on and off campus, as well as wide media publicity, changed the minds of school officials. As a result, UMass made a statement on February 18 committing to once again allowing Iranian students to apply to the aforementioned graduate programs. On the same day, an official in the U.S. Department of State stated in an interview that: &quot;U.S. laws and regulations do not prevent Iranian people from traveling to the United States or studying in engineering program of any U.S. academic institutions.&quot; UMass Amherst replaced the ban with a policy aimed at designing specific curricula for admitted Iranian nationals based on their needs. While less controversial, this policy has still generated backlash, with one student saying, &quot;This university that&#x27;s supposed to be so open-minded forcing him to sign a document saying he won&#x27;t go home and build a bomb or something is just really disappointing to see.&quot;

==Student life==
===Arts on campus===
The UMass Amherst campus offers a variety of artistic venues, both performance and visual art. The most prominent is the Fine Arts Center (FAC) built in 1975. The FAC brings theater, music, and dance performances to campus throughout the year into its performance spaces (Concert Hall, Bezanson Recital Hall, and Bowker Auditorium). These include several performance series: Jazz in July Summer Music Program, The Asian Arts &amp; Culture Program, Center Series, and Magic Triangle Series presenting music, dance, and theater performances, cultural arts events, films, talks, workshops, masterclasses, and special family events. University Museum of Contemporary Art in the FAC has a permanent contemporary art collection of about 2,600 works and hosts numerous visual arts exhibitions each year as well as workshops, masterclasses, and artist residencies.

The 9,000-seat Mullins Center, the multi-purpose arena of UMass Amherst hosts a wide variety of performances including speakers, rock concerts, and Broadway shows. In addition, the Music, Dance, and Theater Departments, the Renaissance Center, and multiple student groups dedicated to the arts provide an eclectic menu of performances throughout the year.

The Interdepartmental Program for Film Studies has been organizing the Massachusetts Multicultural Film Festival on campus since 1991.

=== Groups and activities ===
UMass Amherst has a history of protest and activism among the undergraduate and graduate population and is home to over 200 registered student organizations (RSOs).

====Student Government Association====
The Student Government Association (SGA) is the undergraduate student governmental body and provides funding for the many registered student organizations (RSOs) and agencies, including the Student Legal Services Office (SLSO) and the Center for Student Business (CSB). The SGA also makes formal recommendations on matters of campus policy and advocates for undergraduate students to the Administration, non-student organizations, and local and state government. As of the 2023 school year, the SGA had a budget of over $7.5 million per year, which is collected from students in the form of the $266 per year Student Activities Fee.

====UMass permaculture====
UMass permaculture is one of the first university permaculture initiatives in the nation and transforms marginalized landscapes on the campus into diverse, educational, low-maintenance, and edible gardens. Rather than tilling the soil, a more sustainable landscaping method known as sheet mulching is employed. In November 2010, &quot;about a quarter of a million pounds of organic matter was moved by hand&quot;, using all student and community volunteer labor and no fossil fuels on-site. The process took about two weeks to complete. Now, the Franklin Permaculture Garden includes a diverse mixture of &quot;vegetables, fruit trees, berry bushes, culinary herbs, and a lot of flowers that will attract beneficial insects.&quot;

==== Minuteman Marching Band ====
UMass Amherst has the largest marching band in New England. The Minuteman Marching Band consists of over 390 members and regularly plays at football games. The band also performs in various other places and events like the Collegiate Marching Band Festival in Allentown, Pennsylvania, Bands of America in Indianapolis, Symphony Hall, Boston, The Macy&#x27;s Thanksgiving Day Parade, Tournament of Roses Parade in Pasadena, California, and on occasion Montreal, Quebec, Canada.

====Fraternities and sororities====
Fraternities, sororities, and honor societies have been present on the campus almost since inception, with its first fraternity, the Latin letter-named Q.T.V. emerging in 1869, and the first sorority, Delta Phi Gamma (local) in 1916. Approximately 1,900 students are active members each academic year.

Several fraternities had houses on North Pleasant Street until 2007 when several lots owned by Alpha Tau Gamma were sold to the university for $2,500,000 ($ in today&#x27;s money). Alpha Tau Gamma, a local fraternity associated with the Stockbridge School of Agriculture, then donated $500,001 to endow the salary for the director of the Stockbridge School.

Criticism of sexual and alcohol abuse in Greek Life Organizations has appeared repeatedly in Bostonian and national news. Some students have called for changes in policy. The university has responded by creating a sorority and fraternity accreditation program and scorecard publishing community service, educational programming, grade reports, and conduct reports on their website.

=== 2023-24 Student Demonstrations ===
Following the Hamas-led October 7th, 2023 attack on Israel and the subsequent Israeli bombing campaign and invasion of the besieged Gaza Strip, UMass Amherst experienced Pro-Palestinian student demonstrations throughout the 2023-24 school year.

==== October 25th Sit-in ====
On October 25, 2023, over 500 UMass Amherst students and faculty affiliated with a number of activist groups on campus organized a rally outside of the Whitmore administration building. The aim was to end the university’s ties with arms manufacturers, most prominently Raytheon, which actively recruit on campus. Following the rally, the groups entered the building during regular business hours, with the intent to occupy until their demands were met. When the building closed at 5pm, the administration had not agreed to the demands, and police presence slowly increased. The process of arrests took place from around 6:30 in the evening to around 1 in the morning, with 57 total arrests made on the grounds of trespassing. The following day, the Chancellor agreed to meet with 5 representatives of the student protests, but the two parties were not able to come to an agreement. All of the arrested students later had their charges lowered from criminal to civil infractions.

==== April 29th Encampment ====
Following the International Criminal Court case accusing Israel of committing genocide in Gaza, protests continued at UMass Amherst during the Spring semester. In response to the erection of encampments at other universities around the country, demonstrators at UMass Amherst launched an encampment on April 29th on the university’s South Lawn . In response, the administration urged the demonstrators to remove the tents, saying that the encampment was violating the university’s land use policy. The administration’s aggressive stance towards the encampment was not the same as the response to a similar protest the previous year, which had demanded more equitable solutions for housing and did not face any sanction from the university. At night, demonstrators slept in their tents and prepared for the next day. At around 6 am the next morning, demonstrators were encircled by the university police, and administrators urged them to take down the tents under the threat of arrest. The protesters and administration then came to an agreement that if the tents were taken down, protests would be allowed to continue in that space albeit without structures.

==== May 7th Encampment ====
The following week, on Tuesday, May 7th, another encampment was erected on the university’s South Lawn. Instead of tents, protesters barricaded themselves inside a structure made out of wooden pallets, with the declaration that they would not dismantle the encampment until their demands were met. A rally formed outside in support of the encampment, which quickly swelled to hundreds of students, faculty, staff and community members. After negotiations between the protesters and administrators fell through, university, town, and state police began arresting protesters at around 7 PM. Although UMass Amherst Chancellor Javier Reyes claimed that ”involving law enforcement is the absolute last resort” in an email sent at 8:30pm that night, police reinforcements had been brought in while negotiations were ongoing. The amount of police vehicles numbered 117 with over 200 officers present, and the Massachusetts Daily Collegian noted officers covering their names and badge numbers. As more arrests took place throughout the night, UMPD jails become overcrowded and campus shuttle buses were co-opted to transport arrestees to be held at the Mullins Center. In total 138 people were arrested. Witness testimonies and subsequent reporting have pointed to multiple instances of brutal treatment of protesters by police. Over the summer, UMass attempted to bring felony riot charges against students who it identified as leaders of the protest, but these charges were eventually dropped.

==== Community Reaction ====
The police crackdown on the encampment elicited a campus-wide discussion on the appropriate way for the university’s administration to respond to protests and demonstrations. Despite the district attorney largely dismissing charges against the arrestees, the university nevertheless pursued trespass orders on community members, as well as academic sanctions and even felony charges against student organizers. Sectors of the UMass community held that the chancellor’s decision to call police into campus was an irresponsible escalation that created an unsafe environment and betrayed the core values of the university. Other community members condemned the arrests and later no-trespass orders, with an arrestee stating “UMass is alienating their own — and surrounding — community by doing this… It’s a public university where people all over the area partake in events.” The ACLU of Massachusetts later released a statement declaring “Campus administrators have an obligation to protect students’ safety on campus; at the same time, they must take all necessary measures to protect students’ right to protest. Calling heavily armed police on student political expression is an inherently dangerous choice.” US Representative from Massachusetts Jim McGovern, whose district includes the city of Amherst, also supported the protestors, saying, “I regret that police were brought onto the campus and all the arrests that happened. I&#x27;m a strong believer in the right to peaceful protest. It&#x27;s a hallmark of our history… it also means that you don&#x27;t arrest peaceful protesters.“ Shortly after, during a general faculty meeting on May 20th, a motion was put forth proposing a vote of no confidence in the chancellor. This motion passed with 473 faculty members voting in favor, 332 voting against and 20 abstaining. In addition, all 5 major unions on campus passed resolutions condemning the actions of the Chancellor.

Others praised the chancellor’s handling of the situation, most notably, UMass system president Marty Meehan and the UMass board of trustees. Chairman Stephen Karam stated, &quot;I want to offer the Board’s full and unwavering support for Chancellor Javier Reyes…We have absolute confidence in his leadership, his integrity, and his commitment to our students.&quot; Massachusetts Governor Maura Healey similarly supported the Chancellor’s decision, saying, ”I understand and appreciate that there is a right to protest and to give voice, certainly. But it&#x27;s also clear that there&#x27;s no place for hate or for violence or threats of violence on our college campuses.“ Her comments came despite the university having reported no incidents of violence taking place.

==== Prince Lobel Report ====
On January 16 2025, Massachusetts law firm Prince Lobel, headed by former Republican Attorney General Ralph C. Martin II, released an independent external review of the two encampments in the Spring. The goal of the report was to provide recommendations for potential policy changes and a summary of the events from an outside perspective. The report determined that while the protests themselves may have been peaceful, the chancellor ultimately had the power to determine when a protester is “trespassing” or causing “disorder”, making the his involvement of the police on May 7th justified. The report did contain a few gentle criticisms of the administration&#x27;s actions, declaring “we did not find that there was a significant risk of violence by protesters, counter-protesters or others” and that “Even if (as we have found) the chancellor’s decision was reasonable, there is still a question of whether another road should have been taken.” 

Despite declaring the protests as being peaceful, the report continued on to state “we have little difficulty concluding that the Administration acted reasonably when it decided to remove the April 29 and May 7 Encampments,” citing that the administration was worried that the encampment could provoke violence in a manner similar to the UCLA encampment, which had been attacked by a militant group of counterprotesters on May 1st.

In response to the report, Kevin Young, a History Professor at UMass and May 7 arrestee, wrote an article fact-checking the report. In the article, Young criticized Prince Lobel for being biased towards the administration, saying, “I was one of multiple witnesses who provided the Prince Lobel team with evidence that refutes the key aspects of the Reyes administration’s narrative…The Prince Lobel team appears to have ignored that evidence almost entirely.” Young claimed that while the report claims that safety was a primary concern for the administration, it does not offer any “substantive evidence” for this claim. He also made the case that “placing arbitrary conditions on the right of protest can still be an undue infringement on protester rights,” and that “the Reyes administration’s accumulated pattern of action since October 2023 is strong evidence of anti-Palestinian bias.”
===Media===
==== &quot;The Massachusetts Daily Collegian&quot; ====

&quot;The Massachusetts Daily Collegian&quot;, the official newspaper of UMass Amherst, is published Monday through Thursday during the calendar semester. The &quot;Collegian&quot; is a non-profit student-run organization that receives no funding from the university or student fees. The &quot;Collegian&quot; operates entirely on advertising revenues. Founded in 1890, the paper began as &quot;Aggie Life&quot;, became the &quot;College Signal&quot; in 1901, the &quot;Weekly Collegian&quot; in 1914, and the &quot;Tri-Weekly Collegian&quot; in 1956. Published daily since 1967, the &quot;Collegian&quot; has been broadsheet since January 1994.

==== WMUA 91.1 FM ====
The student-operated radio station, WMUA, is a federally licensed, non-commercial broadcast facility serving the Connecticut River Valley of Western Massachusetts, Northern Connecticut, and Southern Vermont. Although the station is managed by full-time undergraduate students of the University of Massachusetts, station members can consist of various members of the university (undergraduate and graduate students, faculty, and staff), as well as people of the surrounding communities. WMUA began as an AM station in 1949.

====WSYL-FM====
There were two student-run, extremely-low-power FM radio stations from the mid-1970s through the 1980s: one that used the self-assigned identifier &quot;WSYL-FM&quot; (With Songs You Like) which operated in the basement of Cashin, and WOCH (OrChard Hill, the dormitory area), which operated from Grayson.

== Athletics ==

UMass is a member of Division I of the National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA). The university is a member of the Atlantic 10 Conference while playing ice hockey in the Hockey East Association. The football team joined the Mid-American Conference (MAC), to play at Football Bowl Subdivision (FBS; the sport&#x27;s highest level) with games played at Gillette Stadium in 2012. In March 2014, the MAC and UMass announced an agreement for the Minutemen football team to leave the conference after the 2015 season due to UMass declining an offer to become a full member of the conference. In the agreement between the MAC and the university, there was a contractual clause that had UMass playing in the MAC as a football-only member for two more seasons if UMass declined a full membership offer. UMass announced that it would look for a &quot;more suitable conference&quot; for the team. UMass was unable to find a &quot;suitable conference&quot; for nearly a decade, remaining a full A-10 member and becoming an FBS independent, but during the early-2020s conference realignment entered into membership discussions with both the MAC and Conference USA. On February 29, 2024, it was announced that UMass would join the MAC as a full member, including football, in July 2025.

UMass originally was known as the Aggies, later the Statesmen, then the Redmen. In a response to changing attitudes regarding the use of Native American–themed mascots, they changed their mascot in 1972 to the Minuteman, based on the historical &quot;minuteman&quot; relationship with Massachusetts; women&#x27;s teams and athletes are known as Minutewomen.

The UMass Amherst Department of Athletics currently sponsors men&#x27;s intercollegiate baseball, basketball, cross country, ice hockey, football, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, and indoor and outdoor track &amp; field. They also sponsor women&#x27;s intercollegiate basketball, softball, cross country, rowing, lacrosse, soccer, swimming, field hockey, indoor and outdoor track &amp; field, and tennis. Club sports offered which are not also offered at the varsity level are men&#x27;s wrestling, men&#x27;s rowing, men&#x27;s tennis, women&#x27;s ice hockey, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s rugby, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s bicycle racing, and men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s fencing. Men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s downhill skiing have been re-certified as club sports following the April 2, 2009, announcement of their discontinuation as varsity sports.

<text>The University of Massachusetts is the five-campus public university system in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts. The university system includes six campuses (Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, a medical school in Worcester and a law school in Dartmouth), a satellite campus in Springfield and 25 smaller campuses throughout California and Washington with the University of Massachusetts Global.

The University of Massachusetts system is governed by a president and a 22-member board of trustees. The system administration is in Boston and Shrewsbury, is accredited by the New England Commission of Higher Education, and across its campuses enrolled 73,593 students in fall 2023.

==Campuses==
The University of Massachusetts Amherst is the largest school in the UMass system. It was also the first one established, dating back to 1863, when it was founded as the Massachusetts Agricultural College. The University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School was founded in 1962, and is located in Worcester. The University of Massachusetts Boston, originally established in 1964, was merged with Boston State College in 1982. In 1991, the University of Lowell and Southeastern Massachusetts University joined the system as the University of Massachusetts Lowell and University of Massachusetts Dartmouth, respectively.

===University of Massachusetts Amherst===

Amherst is the flagship and the largest of the UMass campuses, as well as the first established. Like many colleges and universities, the Massachusetts Agricultural College (as it was originally called) in Amherst was founded as a land-grant college in 1863, receiving initial start-up funding as part of the Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act. It became &quot;Massachusetts State College&quot; in 1931, and &quot;University of Massachusetts&quot; in 1947. The library system is the largest state-supported library system in New England with over 6.1 million items.

Students participate in 240 campus organizations, 21 NCAA Division I athletic teams, living-learning residence halls, community service, internships, and faculty research. Massachusetts is also part of the Five Colleges consortium, with Smith, Mount Holyoke, Hampshire, and Amherst colleges, all within a free bus ride of each other using the Pioneer Valley Transit Authority. Students can take classes on any of these campuses and participate in all co-curricular and cultural activities.

===University of Massachusetts Boston===

UMass Boston is a research university located in the City of Boston. Located on the Columbia Point peninsula, the university is surrounded by the Boston Harbor, the John F. Kennedy Library and the Massachusetts State Archives. &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; is also headquartered adjacent to campus, as well as Boston College High School. Subsequently, the university holds many partnerships with its neighboring organizations, providing research and employment opportunities.

UMass Boston enrolls more than 12,000 undergraduates and nearly 4,000 graduate students, making it the third largest campus in the system. The university has five undergraduate colleges and two graduate colleges, with over 100 undergraduate programs and 50 graduate programs. The campus is also home to more than 100 student organizations—including clubs, literary magazines, newspaper, radio station, art gallery, and 16 NCAA Division III sports teams.

=== University of Massachusetts Dartmouth ===

Located in southeastern Massachusetts, UMass Dartmouth started in 1895 as the New Bedford Textile School, the Bradford Durfee Textile School, and later Southeastern Massachusetts University (SMU). In addition to the UMass Dartmouth main campus is, satellite campuses are located throughout the South Coast.

The university has nearly 8,000 students and 65 degree programs in its College of Arts &amp; Sciences; Charlton College of Business; College of Engineering; College of Nursing; College of Visual and Performing Arts; School of Education, Public Policy, and Civic Engagement; and the School for Marine Science and Technology. The university hosts internships, undergraduate research opportunities, and service learning experiences, as well as an Honors Program.

The university has more than 100 student organizations and 25 NCAA Division III athletic teams. The buildings of the campus were designed by internationally renowned Modernist architect Paul Rudolph.

The University of Massachusetts School of Law was opened in September 2010 three miles from the Dartmouth campus.

===University of Massachusetts Lowell===

UMass Lowell is the product of a 1971 merger between Lowell State College (founded in 1894 as Lowell Normal School) and Lowell Technological Institute (founded in 1895 as the Lowell Textile School). The merged institution became the University of Lowell, with the former Lowell Tech serving as the North Campus and the former Lowell State serving as the South Campus.

UMass Lowell is located in the Merrimack Valley. It had a total of 18,316 students as of fall 2017 and is the fastest growing of the five UMass campuses. The campus offers over 120 programs taught by 737 faculty members in five colleges.

There are 12 residence halls on the campus. There are more than 120 active student organizations on campus, a campus recreation center, 16 NCAA Division I sports teams that compete in the America East Conference, and the ice hockey team that competes in the Hockey East Conference.

===University of Massachusetts Chan Medical School===

The University of Massachusetts Worcester, also known as UMass Chan Medical School or UMass Medical School is one of the fastest growing academic health science centers in the country and is home to the School of Medicine (SOM) — the Commonwealth&#x27;s only public medical school — the Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences (GSBS), the Graduate School of Nursing (GSN), and a research enterprise that attracts more than $200 million in external funding annually. Its campus is shared with clinical partner UMass Memorial Health Care, the region&#x27;s largest employer.

The work of UMass Chan Medical researcher and 2006 Nobel Prize winner Craig Mello, an investigator of the prestigious Howard Hughes Medical Institute, toward the discovery of RNA interference has launched a promising new field of research. The school is also the home of the Albert Sherman Center, an interdisciplinary, research and education facility that fosters collaboration among scientists and innovation across disciplines.

=== University of Massachusetts School of Law ===
The University of Massachusetts School of Law also known as the University of Massachusetts - Dartmouth Law School, UMass Law School or UMass Law is located near the main campus of UMass Dartmouth in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts and is also a part of UMass Dartmouth.

UMass Law was established in 1981 as the Southeastern Massachusetts-Rhode Island-Avins Law School with a volunteer faculty and a handful of part-time students. It grew from a store-front operation, offering a weekend program of study in Fall River, Massachusetts to a dual-division law school located in its own state-of-the-art facility in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts.

In 1986 the Southeastern Massachusetts-Rhode Island-Avins Law School became the Southern New England School of Law (SNESL). In 1992 the first full-time program at SNESL was established along with SNESL&#x27;s first day classes. In 1994 SNESL moved to its new current site at 333 Faunce Corner Road in North Dartmouth, Massachusetts. In 1995 SNESL was Accredited by New England Association of Schools and Colleges. In 2009 University of Massachusetts Board of Trustees approves UMass Dartmouth plan to offer Juris Doctor (JD) degrees at SNESL.

In 2010 the Massachusetts Board of Higher Education authorized UMass Dartmouth to offer JD degrees along with the establishment of the University of Massachusetts School of Law - Dartmouth (UMass Law). UMass Law was made possible by a $23 million donation of assets, a facility, land, library, technology, and cash from the Southern New England School of Law. In 2010 at the time of the donation from SNESL, SNESL had 1,200 alumni, 200 students, 13 full-time faculty members, and 24 adjunct faculty.

Also in 2010 the first UMass Law class matriculates. In 2011 UMass Law confers their first JD degrees. In 2012 UMass Law was granted provisional approval by Council of the Section of Legal Education and Admissions to the Bar of the American Bar Association with full accreditation being granted four years later.

===UMass Amherst Center at Springfield===
On August 8, 2013, the University of Massachusetts started requesting proposals for potential classroom and office space to establish a satellite center in Springfield. UMass was looking for 25,000 square feet of space that it would use for classrooms, faculty offices and other uses, with the option of doubling the amount of space at a later date. On November 23, 2013, Gov. Deval Patrick and University of Massachusetts President Robert L. Caret announced the selection of Tower Square in downtown Springfield as the university&#x27;s new satellite center. The university would lease 27,321 square feet on the second floor of the 30-floor building, which is owned by the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Co. and located at 1500 Main St. UMass planned to establish academic programs at the center starting in the fall 2014.

In 2014, the state of Massachusetts gave $5.2 million to the Springfield satellite center to allow the university to complete construction and buy furnishings. .

The satellite center, administered by the Amherst campus, opened in March 2014, registering students for September 2014. Programs include nursing, education, business administration, addiction counseling, and GED classes. Enrollment in the more than 20 courses offered at the center has grown from 250 students in the fall of 2014 when it opened to 850 in the spring of 2016, according to Daniel Montagna, director of operations at the center. The institution offers a cybersecurity certificate program funded in 2017 by a $5 million investment by MassMutual.

== University of Massachusetts Global ==
In September 2021, Brandman University reaffiliated with the University of Massachusetts from Chapman University via a change of control agreement and rebranded as UMass Global.

===Collaborations===
The Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center is a joint venture of the University of Massachusetts system, MIT, Harvard, Boston University, and Northeastern to build a shared high-performance computing facility. In 2010, UMass Boston partnered with Dana–Farber/Harvard Cancer Center to collaborate on research aimed at addressing issues of cancer health disparities in disenfranchised populations under U54 Cancer Partnership.

===Inter Campus Programs===
University of Massachusetts Intercampus Graduate School of Marine Sciences and Technology is a graduate degree program offering Master of Science, Doctor of Philosophy and Professional Science Master&#x27;s Degree. The graduates receive a joint degree from all four of the main UMass campuses.

==University president==
The president is the university&#x27;s chief executive officer and works to advance its mission of education, research and public service.
Marty Meehan became the 27th president of the five-campus, 73,000-student University of Massachusetts system on July 1, 2015.

Before the 1962 establishment of the medical school, the president was the administrator of the system&#x27;s only campus in Amherst. When UMass Boston was organized in 1964, it was headed by a chancellor who reported to the president. In 1970, as part of a reorganization, day-to-day leadership responsibilities for UMass Amherst were transferred to a chancellor, with both chancellors reporting on an equal basis to the president. Today, the president administers five campuses.

==Board of trustees==
The University of Massachusetts is governed by a board of trustees that functions as a legislative body dealing mainly with questions of policy. The board establishes the general policies governing the university, but has delegated many powers to the president and, through the president, to campus administrators for day-to-day-operations. In certain rare instances when required by the Massachusetts General Laws, it may function as an appeal body.

The founding board had fourteen appointed members and four &quot;ex-officio&quot; members. Formerly, trustees were appointed by the legislature or the board itself; currently, members are appointed by the governor. The size of the board has fluctuated between twelve and twenty-four members. The current board is composed of nineteen voting members and three &quot;ex-officio&quot; non-voting members. Seventeen board members are appointed by the governor of the Commonwealth; at least five of those appointed must be alumni of the university, and one must be a representative of organized labor. The other two voting members are students. Overall, the board has five student members, elected for one-year terms, from the Amherst, Boston, Dartmouth, Lowell, and Worcester campuses. Voting membership rotates among the campuses: two students are voting members and three others are non-voting members.

<doc id="248446" wikidata="Q214861" url="?curid=248446" title="Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport">
<text>Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport is the primary international airport serving Atlanta and its surrounding metropolitan area, in the U.S. state of Georgia. The airport is located south of the Downtown Atlanta district. It is named after former Atlanta mayors William B. Hartsfield and Maynard Jackson. The airport covers of land and has five parallel runways which are aligned in an east–west direction. There are three runways that are long, one runway that is long, and the longest runway at ATL measures long, which can handle the Airbus A380. Since 1998, Hartsfield–Jackson has been the world&#x27;s busiest airport by passenger traffic, with the exception of 2020, when its passenger traffic dipped for that year due to travel restrictions resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic. In 2023, the airport served over 104.6 million passengers, the most of any airport in the world. Hartsfield–Jackson is also the world&#x27;s busiest airport by aircraft movements. In 2024, it was again named the busiest airport in the world, and saw 2% more capacity than the previous year. 
Hartsfield–Jackson is the corporate headquarters and primary hub of Delta Air Lines. With just over 1,000 flights a day to 225 domestic and international destinations, the Delta hub is the world&#x27;s largest airline hub and is considered the first mega-hub in America. Additionally, Hartsfield–Jackson is the home of Delta&#x27;s Technical Operations Center, which is the airline&#x27;s primary maintenance, repair and overhaul arm. Aside from Delta, Hartsfield–Jackson is also an operating base for low-cost carriers Frontier Airlines, Southwest Airlines, and Spirit Airlines. The airport has international service within North America and to Latin America, Europe, Africa, Middle East and East Asia.

The airport is mostly in unincorporated areas of Clayton County, but it spills into the city limits of Atlanta, College Park, and Hapeville, in territory extending into Fulton County. The airport&#x27;s domestic terminal is served by MARTA&#x27;s Red and Gold rail lines.

== History ==
=== Candler Field/Atlanta Municipal Airport (1925–1961) ===
Hartsfield–Jackson began with a five-year, rent-free lease on that was an abandoned auto racetrack named The Atlanta Speedway. The lease was signed on April 16, 1925, by Mayor Walter Sims, who committed the city to develop it into an airfield. As part of the agreement, the property was renamed Candler Field after its former owner, Coca-Cola tycoon and former Atlanta mayor Asa Candler. The first flight into Candler Field was September 15, 1926, a Florida Airways mail plane flying from Jacksonville, Florida. In May 1928, Pitcairn Aviation began service to Atlanta, followed in June 1930 by Delta Air Service. Those two airlines, later known as Eastern Air Lines and Delta Air Lines, respectively, would both use Atlanta as their chief hubs. The airport&#x27;s weather station became the official location for Atlanta&#x27;s weather observations on September 1, 1928, and records by the National Weather Service.

Atlanta was a busy airport from its inception, and by the end of 1930, it was third behind New York City and Chicago for regular daily flights with sixteen arriving and departing. Candler Field&#x27;s first control tower opened March 1939. The March 1939 Official Aviation Guide shows fourteen weekday airline departures: ten Eastern and four Delta.

In October 1940, the U.S. government declared it a military airfield and the United States Army Air Forces operated Atlanta Army Airfield jointly with Candler Field. The Air Force used the airport primarily to service many types of transient combat aircraft. During World War II, the airport doubled in size and set a record of 1,700 takeoffs and landings in a single day, making it the nation&#x27;s busiest in terms of flight operation. Atlanta Army Airfield closed after the war.

In 1942, Candler Field was renamed Atlanta Municipal Airport and by 1948, more than one million passengers passed through a war surplus hangar that served as a terminal building. Delta and Eastern had extensive networks from ATL, though Atlanta had no nonstop flights beyond Texas, St. Louis, and Chicago until 1961. Southern Airways appeared at ATL after the war and had short-haul routes around the Southeast until 1979.

In 1957, Atlanta saw its first jet airliner: a prototype Sud Aviation Caravelle that was touring the country arrived from Washington, D.C. The first scheduled turbine airliners were Capital Viscounts in June 1956; the first scheduled jets were Delta DC-8s in September 1959. The first trans-Atlantic flight was a Delta/Pan Am interchange DC-8 to Europe via Washington starting in 1964; the first scheduled international nonstops were Eastern flights to Mexico City and Jamaica in 1971–72. Nonstops to Europe started in 1978 and to Asia in 1992–93. a

Atlanta claimed to be the country&#x27;s busiest airport, with more than two million passengers passing through in 1957 and, between noon and 2p.m. each day, it became the world&#x27;s busiest airport. (The April 1957 OAG shows 165 weekday departures from Atlanta, including 45 between 12:05 and 2:00 PM and 20 between 2:25 and 4:25 AM.) Chicago Midway had 414-weekday departures, including 48 between 12:00 and 2:00 PM. In 1957, Atlanta was the country&#x27;s ninth-busiest airline airport by flight count and about the same by passenger count.

=== Original Jet Terminal (1961–1980) ===

In late 1957, work began on a new $21 million terminal, which opened on May 3, 1961. Consisting of six pier concourses radiating from a central building, the terminal was the largest in the country and could handle over six million travelers a year; the first year, nine and a half million people passed through. In March 1962, the longest runway (9/27, now 8R) was ; runway3 was and runway 15 was long.

In 1971, the airport was named William B. Hartsfield Atlanta Airport in honor of Atlanta mayor William B. Hartsfield after his death. The name change took effect on February 28, which would have been Hartsfield&#x27;s 81st birthday. The new name would be relatively brief, as it would be changed later in 1971 to William B. Hartsfield Atlanta International Airport with the growth of flights to and from Atlanta outside North America.

=== Midfield Terminal (1980–present) ===

To address the significant increase in air traffic that outstripped the capacity of the 1961 terminal, and after years of planning and design, construction began on the present midfield terminal complex in 1977 under the administration of Mayor Maynard Jackson. It was billed as the largest construction project in the South, costing $500 million. The complex was designed by Stevens &amp; Wilkinson, Smith Hinchman &amp; Grylls, and Minority Airport Architects &amp; Planners. The new complex, initially consisting of the North and South Terminals, Concourses A through D, and the northern half of the present-day Concourse T (which served as the International Terminal), opened on September 21, 1980, on time and under budget. It was designed to accommodate up to 55 million passengers per year and covered 2.5 million square feet (230,000 m2). In December 1984, a fourth parallel runway was completed, and another runway was extended to the following year. To accommodate increases in international air traffic, a southern extension of Concourse T opened in 1987, and Concourse E opened in 1994 in advance of Atlanta hosting the 1996 Summer Olympics, with Concourse T subsequently being converted to use by domestic flights. MARTA rail service was extended to Hartsfield with the opening of the Airport station in 1988 (the station itself was constructed in 1979-80 as part of the terminal).

In 1999, Hartsfield–Jackson&#x27;s leadership established the Development Program: &quot;Focus On the Future,&quot; involving multiple construction projects to prepare the airport to handle a projected demand of 121 million passengers in 2015. The program was originally budgeted at $5.4 billion over ten years, but the total was revised as of 2007 to over $9 billion.

In 2001, construction of an over fifth runway (10–28) began. It was completed at the cost of $1.28 billion and opened in 2006. It bridges Interstate 285 (the Perimeter) on the airport&#x27;s south side, making Hartsfield–Jackson the nation&#x27;s only currently active civil airport to have a runway above an interstate (although Runway 17R/35L at Stapleton International Airport in Denver, Colorado, crossed Interstate 70 until that airport closed in 1995). The massive project, which involved putting fill dirt eleven stories high in some places, destroyed some surrounding neighborhoods and dramatically changed the scenery of Flat Rock Cemetery and Hart Cemetery, both on the airport property. It was added to help ease traffic problems caused by landing small- and mid-size aircraft on the runways used by larger planes such as the Boeing 777, which need longer runways than the smaller planes. With the fifth runway, Hartsfield–Jackson is one of only a few airports that can perform triple simultaneous landings. The fifth runway was expected to increase the capacity for landings and take-offs by 40%, from an average of 184 flights per hour to 237 flights per hour.
Along with the fifth runway, a new control tower was built to see the entire runway length. The new control tower is the tallest in the United States, over tall. The old control tower, at 231 ft, was demolished in 2006.

In 2003, the Atlanta City Council voted to rename Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport to honor former mayor Maynard Jackson, who died four months prior. The council planned to drop Hartsfield&#x27;s name from the airport, but public outcry (occurring coincidentally during a debate over the state&#x27;s flag) prevented this.

In 2007, an &quot;end-around taxiway&quot; opened, Taxiway Victor. It is expected to save an estimated $26 million to $30 million in fuel each year by allowing airplanes landing on the northernmost runway to taxi to the gate area without preventing other aircraft from taking off. The taxiway drops about from runway elevation to allow takeoffs to continue.

After the Southeastern U.S. drought of 2007, the airport (the state&#x27;s eighth-largest water user) changed to reduce water usage. This included adjusting toilets (725 commodes and 338 urinals) and 601 sinks. (The two terminals alone use a day.) It also stopped using firetrucks to spray water over aircraft when the pilot made the last landing before retirement (a water salute). The city of Macon offered to sell water to the airport through a proposed pipeline.

The Maynard H. Jackson International Terminal and Concourse F opened on the east side of the airport for international passengers in 2012. The 1980 terminal on the other end of the complex then became known as the Domestic Terminal. Prior to the opening of the International Terminal, all Atlanta-bound international passengers needed to go through TSA screening and transit to the terminal to exit the airport. The opening of the International Terminal eliminated the need for this practice, which had been in use since the opening of Concourse E in 1994.

The airport today employs about 55,300 airline, ground transportation, concessionaire, security, the federal government, the City of Atlanta, and airport tenant employees and is the largest employment center in Georgia. With a payroll of $2.4 billion, the airport has a direct and indirect economic impact of $3.2 billion on the local and regional economy and an annual regional economic impact of more than $19.8 billion.

In 2015, the airport became the first airport in the world to serve 100 million passengers in a year. The airport is routinely cited as one of the world&#x27;s busiest, topping the Airports Council International rankings in 2022 and 2023.

=== Historical airline service ===
Delta and Eastern dominated the airport during the 1970s. United, Southern, Piedmont, Northwest and TWA were also present. In 1978, after airline deregulation, United no longer served Atlanta, while Southern successor Republic was the airport&#x27;s third-largest carrier.

Eastern was a larger airline than Delta until deregulation in 1978, but Delta was early to adopt the hub-and-spoke route system, with Atlanta as a hub between the Midwest and Florida, giving it an advantage in the Atlanta market. When the current terminal complex opened in 1980, Delta occupied all of Concourse A and the southern side of Concourse B, while Eastern occupied the remainder of Concourse B and all of Concourse C. All other domestic airlines used Concourse D, and Concourse T (known then as the International Concourse) was used by international flights.

Eastern ceased operations in 1991. From Eastern&#x27;s demise to the 1996 Summer Olympics, Delta&#x27;s hub grew to occupy all of Concourse B and the southern side of Concourse T (which opened in 1987), and international flights moved to the new Concourse E (which opened in 1994). By 1996, Delta&#x27;s regional affiliate Atlantic Southeast Airlines (operating as Delta Connection) relocated to the north side of Concourse C and the gates were converted for use by regional aircraft.

After Eastern ceased operation, Northwest Airlines (the successor of Republic) briefly expressed interest in establishing an Atlanta hub but ultimately decided against it. American Airlines also considered establishing an Atlanta hub around that time but decided Delta was too strong there and instead replaced Eastern&#x27;s other hub in Miami. In 1992, TWA created a small hub at Atlanta and relocated to some of Eastern&#x27;s former gates on Concourse C. TWA abandoned the Atlanta hub concept in 1994 leaving Delta with a monopoly hub at Atlanta.

Japan Airlines was the first Asian carrier to serve Atlanta in 1986. In December 1994, Korean Air became the second Asian carrier to serve the airport.

Atlanta-based ValuJet was established in 1993 as low-cost competition for Delta at ATL. ValuJet built up their hub on Concourse C in the following years. However, ValuJet&#x27;s safety practices were questioned early, and the airline was grounded after the 1996 crash of ValuJet Flight 592. ValuJet resumed operations later that year and in 1997, it merged with AirTran Airways. AirTran would continue operating the hub and was second-largest airline at ATL through the 2000s. AirTran was acquired by Southwest Airlines in 2011, who did not serve Atlanta prior to the acquisition. AirTran was fully absorbed into Southwest in 2014, continuing to operate Atlanta as a focus city and remaining the airport&#x27;s second-largest carrier. In 2024, Southwest announced it was permanently cutting 15 destinations from Atlanta, reducing its footprint from 18 gates to 11, and cutting staff.

In recent years the airport has had an increase in non-Delta flights, both due to the rapid population growth of Metro Atlanta and the airport&#x27;s prominence as a major hub.

Since 2015 the airport has seen growth from low cost carriers such as Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines. Spirit also established Atlanta as an operating base.

In addition to the growth of the low cost carriers, international carriers have increasingly offered service to Atlanta since 2014. In 2014, Virgin Atlantic began offering direct flights to London and in 2015, the airline began offering direct flights to Manchester. In May 2016, Turkish Airlines began offering direct flights to Istanbul and Qatar Airways began Doha flights just one month later on June 1. In March 2019, WestJet began offering direct flights to Calgary, and in 2023, the airline started non-stop service to Vancouver and Winnipeg. In 2024, WestJet began non-stop service to Edmonton. Copa Airlines became the first Latin American carrier to serve the airport in December 2021 with direct flights to Panama City. In June 2022, Air Canada reintroduced Montreal service. Ethiopian Airlines started service to Atlanta in 2023, becoming the first African carrier to serve the airport since South African Airways ended service in 2006. LATAM Perú started service to Atlanta in October 2023 from Lima. Aeromexico Connect resumed service to Atlanta in January 2024 with nonstop service to Guadalajara and Monterrey. Nonstop service to Leon/Guanajuato and Mérida began in March 2024. The Mérida service ended in June. Nonstop service to Querétaro started service in August 2024. Nonstop service to Manzanillo started on November 2. Scandinavian Airlines started service to Atlanta in June 2024 with direct flights from Copenhagen. Etihad Airways will start nonstop service to Atlanta on July 2, 2025 with direct flights to Abu Dhabi.

Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport has two terminals and seven concourses with a total of 192 gates. The Domestic Terminal is located on the west side of the airport and the Maynard H. Jackson Jr. International Terminal is on the east side of the airport. The Domestic Terminal has entrances on both sides, which are known as Domestic Terminal North and Domestic Terminal South. Concourse T is directly connected to the Domestic Terminal and Concourse F is directly connected to the International Terminal. The remaining five concourses (Concourses A-E) are located between the two terminals and are parallel to each other. The terminals and concourses are connected airside by the Transportation Mall, an underground pedestrian tunnel with a series of moving walkways and The Plane Train, a 24/7 underground automated people mover. A second underground walkway connecting the north sides of Concourses B and C once existed for Eastern Air Lines. Though, this underground walkway was closed in the late 2000s and is now used for the airport&#x27;s baggage system.

Delta Air Lines&#x27; hub includes operations on all seven concourses. The south side of Concourse T and all of Concourses A and B are used exclusively by Delta for main line domestic flights. Delta&#x27;s regional flights (operated as Delta Connection) primarily operate from the north side of Concourse C. The south side of Concourse C is used by Southwest Airlines for their operating base. All other domestic airlines operate from Concourse D or the north side of Concourse T. Some Delta and Delta Connection flights operate on Concourse D as well.

International flights operate in Concourses E and F. Concourse F is the only concourse in the airport that has a gate that can support an Airbus A380, the largest passenger aircraft in the world. All non-Delta international carriers operate their ATL flights from this terminal, including Delta&#x27;s partners such as Air France, KLM, Korean Air, LATAM, Virgin Atlantic, Scandinavian, and WestJet. Aeromexico operates in Concourse E. Some WestJet flights operates in Concourse D. 

International passengers arriving in Concourse F will be processed at the Customs and Border Protection checkpoint in that concourse before exiting into the landside of the international terminal. In Concourse E, international passengers ending their journeys in Atlanta will go through a dedicated underground walkway to the Concourse F checkpoint. International passengers arriving in Concourse E that are connecting to another flight will be processed in a separate checkpoint on Concourse E and reenter the concourse via a dedicated TSA checkpoint.

*Concourse T contains 21 gates.
*Concourse A contains 29 gates.
*Concourse B contains 32 gates.
*Concourse C contains 34 gates.
*Concourse D contains 40 gates.
*Concourse E contains 28 gates.
*Concourse F contains 12 gates.

=== Ground transportation ===
The domestic terminal can be accessed directly from Interstate 85 SB at exit 72/Camp Creek Pkwy, or from Interstate 85 NB at exit 71/Riverdale Rd. The international terminal is accessed directly from Interstate 75 SB or NB at exit 239. These freeways in turn connect with the following additional freeways within 10 miles: Interstate 285, Interstate 675, Georgia State Route 166, Interstate 20.

Hartsfield–Jackson has its own train station on the city&#x27;s rapid transit system, MARTA, served by the Red and Gold lines. The above-ground station is inside the main building, between the north and south domestic terminals on the west end. The Airport station is currently the southernmost station in the MARTA system, though expansions via metro or commuter rail further south into Clayton County have been discussed.

Several local shared-ride shuttle services are readily available at Atlanta Airport, offering diverse options for travelers seeking convenient transportation.

The Hartsfield–Jackson Rental Car Center, which opened December 8, 2009, houses all ten airport rental agencies with capacity for additional companies. The complex features 9,900 parking spaces split between two four-story parking decks that together cover , a customer service center, and a maintenance center featuring 140 gas pumps and 30 wash bays equipped with a water recovery system. An automated people mover, the ATL SkyTrain, runs between the rental car center, the Domestic Terminal, and the Gateway Center of the Georgia International Convention Center, while a four-lane roadway that spans Interstate 85 connects the rental car center with the existing airport road network.

=== Other facilities ===

The 990 Toffie Terrace hangar, a part of Hartsfield–Jackson Airport and located within the City of College Park corporate limits, is owned by the City of Atlanta. The building now houses the Atlanta Police Department Helicopter Unit. It once served as the headquarters of the regional airline ExpressJet.

Before its merger with ExpressJet, Atlantic Southeast Airlines was headquartered in the hangar, then named the A-Tech Center. In December 2007, the airline announced it was moving its headquarters into the facility, previously named the &quot;North Hangar.&quot; The hangar includes of hangar bays for aircraft maintenance. It has of adjacent land and 1,400 parking spaces for employees. The airline planned to relocate 100 employees from Macon to the new headquarters. The Atlanta City Council and Mayor of Atlanta Shirley Franklin approved the new 25-year ASA lease, which also gave the airline new hangar space to work on 15 to 25 aircraft in overnight maintenance; previously, its aircraft were serviced at ConcourseC. The airport property division stated that the hangar was built in the 1960s and renovated in the 1970s. Eastern Air Lines and Delta Air Lines had previously occupied the hangar. Delta&#x27;s lease originally was scheduled to expire in 2010, but the airline returned the lease to the City of Atlanta in 2005 as part of its bankruptcy settlement. The city collected an insurance settlement of almost $900,000 due to the cancellation.

== Accidents and incidents ==
* On May 23, 1960, Delta Air Lines Flight 1903, a Convair CV-880-22-1 (N8804E), crashed on takeoff resulting in the loss of all four crew members. This flight was a training flight for two Delta captains who were being type-rated on the 880.
* On February 25, 1969, Eastern Air Lines Flight 955 was hijacked by one passenger shortly after takeoff from ATL en route to Miami. The man pulled a .22 caliber pistol and demanded to be flown to Cuba. He got off the plane in Cuba, and the DC-8 was allowed to fly back to the U.S.
*On April 4, 1977, Southern Airways Flight 242 was on descent to the airport when hail was ingested into the engines, leading them to fail. Pilot errors and difficult weather forced the pilots to attempt an emergency landing on a highway. Upon touchdown, the aircraft struck several buildings and cars, killing 72 people.
* On January 18, 1990, Eastern Air Lines Flight 111, a Boeing 727, overran a Beechcraft King Air operated by Epps Air Service, based at another Atlanta airport. The King Air had landed and was taxiing when the 727, still at high speed in its landing roll, collided with the aircraft. The larger plane&#x27;s wing impacted the roof of the smaller. The pilot of the King Air, an Epps charter pilot, was killed, while a passenger survived. No crew or passengers on the Eastern plane were injured.
* On November 1, 1998, AirTran Airways Flight 867, a Boeing 737, lost control and skidded off of the runway while landing, with main landing gear in a drainage ditch and its empennage extending over the taxiway. The nose gear was folded back into the electrical/electronic compartment and turned 90 degrees from its normal, extended position. The cause was an improperly repaired hydraulic line leak that caused the flight crew to lose control of the airplane.
* On September 10, 2024, Delta Air Lines Flight 295, an Airbus A350-900, and Endeavor Air Flight 5526, a Bombardier CRJ-900, were involved in a low-speed ground collision. While the CRJ-900 was stationary at a runway hold-short point, the right wingtip of the A350 impacted and broke off the CRJ-900&#x27;s vertical stabilizer. There were no injuries reported among the 236 people on board the A350 or 59 people on board the CRJ-900.

== In popular culture ==
The airport was seen in the 2018 Channel 5 documentary &quot;The Secret Life of the World&#x27;s Busiest Airport&quot;.

<text>Chicago O&#x27;Hare International Airport is a major international airport serving Chicago, Illinois, United States, located on the city&#x27;s Northwest Side, approximately northwest of the Loop business district. The airport is operated by the Chicago Department of Aviation and covering . O&#x27;Hare has non-stop flights to 249 destinations in North America, South America, the Caribbean, Europe, Africa, Asia, the Middle East and the North Atlantic region as of Summer 2024. As of 2024, O&#x27;Hare is considered the most connected airport in the US, and 5th most connected airport in the world. It is also the world&#x27;s 4th busiest airport and 16th largest airport.

Designed to be the successor to Chicago&#x27;s Midway International Airport, itself once nicknamed the &quot;busiest square mile in the world,&quot; O&#x27;Hare began as an airfield serving a Douglas manufacturing plant for C-54 military transports during World War II. It was renamed Orchard Field Airport in the mid-1940s and assigned the IATA code ORD. In 1949, it was renamed after aviator Edward &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first Medal of Honor recipient during that war. As the first major airport planned after World War II, O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s innovative design pioneered concepts such as concourses, direct highway access to the terminal, jet bridges, and underground refueling systems.

O&#x27;Hare became famous during the jet age, holding the distinction as the world&#x27;s busiest airport by passenger traffic from 1963 to 1998. It still ranks as one of the busiest airports in the world, according to the Airports Council International rankings. In 2019, O&#x27;Hare had 919,704 aircraft movements, averaging 2,520 per day, the most of any airport in the world, in part because of a large number of regional flights. On the ground, road access to the airport is offered by airport shuttle, bus, the Chicago &quot;L&quot;, or taxis. Interstate 190 (Kennedy Expressway) goes directly into the airport. O&#x27;Hare is a hub for American Airlines and United Airlines (which is headquartered in Willis Tower), as well as an operating base for Frontier Airlines and Spirit Airlines.

==History==
=== Establishment and defense efforts ===
Soon after the opening of Chicago Municipal Airport in 1926, the City of Chicago realized more airport capacity would be needed. The city government investigated various sites in the 1930s but made little progress before America&#x27;s entry into World War II.

O&#x27;Hare began as a manufacturing plant for Douglas C-54 Skymasters during World War II. The site was known as Orchard Place, previously a small German-American farming community. The plant, in the northeast corner of what is now the airport, needed easy access to the workforce of the nation&#x27;s second-largest city, as well as its railroads and location far from enemy threat. 655 C-54s were built at the plant, more than half of all produced. The airfield, from which the C-54s flew out, was known as Douglas Airport; initially, it had four runways. Less known is the fact that it was the location of the Army Air Force&#x27;s 803rd Specialized Depot, a unit charged with storing many captured enemy aircraft; a few representatives of this collection would eventually be transferred to the Smithsonian Institution&#x27;s National Air and Space Museum.

Douglas Company&#x27;s contract ended with the war&#x27;s conclusion. Douglas considered building airliners at Orchard but chose to concentrate civil production at its headquarters in Santa Monica, California. With the departure of Douglas, the complex took the name Orchard Field Airport, and was assigned the IATA code ORD.

The United States Air Force used the field extensively during the Korean War; the airport then had no scheduled airline service. Although not its primary base in the area, the Air Force used O&#x27;Hare as a fighter base; it was home to the 62nd Fighter-Interceptor Squadron flying North American F-86 Sabres from 1950 to 1959. By 1960, the need for O&#x27;Hare as an active duty fighter base was diminishing, just as commercial business was picking up at the airport. The Air Force removed active-duty units from O&#x27;Hare and turned the station over to Continental Air Command, enabling them to base reserve and Air National Guard units there. As a result of a 1993 agreement between the City and the Department of Defense, the reserve base was closed on April 1, 1997, ending its career as the home of the 928th Airlift Wing and of the 126th Air Refueling Wing in 1999. At that time, the remaining site came under the ownership of the Chicago Department of Aviation.

===Early commercial development===
In 1945, Chicago mayor Edward Kelly established a board to choose the site of a new airport to meet future demand. After considering various proposals, the board decided upon the Orchard Field site and acquired most of the federal government property in March 1946. The military retained a small parcel of property on the site and the right to use 25% of the airfield&#x27;s operating capacity for free.

Ralph H. Burke devised an airport master plan based on the pioneering idea of what he called &quot;split finger terminals&quot;, allowing a terminal building to be attached to &quot;airline wings&quot; (concourses), each providing space for gates and planes. (Pre-war airport designs had favored ever-larger single terminals, exemplified by Berlin&#x27;s Tempelhof.) Burke&#x27;s design also included underground refueling, direct highway access to the front of terminals, and direct rail access from downtown, all of which are utilized at airports worldwide today. O&#x27;Hare was the site of the world&#x27;s first jet bridge in 1958, and successfully adapted slip form paving, developed for the nation&#x27;s new Interstate highway system, for seamless concrete runways.

In 1949, the City renamed the facility O&#x27;Hare Airport to honor Edward &quot;Butch&quot; O&#x27;Hare, the U.S. Navy&#x27;s first flying ace and Medal of Honor recipient in World War II. Its IATA code (ORD) remained unchanged, however, resulting in O&#x27;Hare being one of the few IATA codes bearing no connection to the airport&#x27;s name or metropolitan area.

===Arrival of passenger service and subsequent growth===
Scheduled passenger service began in 1955, but growth was slow at first. Although Chicago had invested over $25 million in O&#x27;Hare, Midway remained the world&#x27;s busiest airport and airlines were reluctant to move until highway access and other improvements were completed. The April 1957 Official Airline Guide listed 36 weekday departures from O&#x27;Hare, while Midway had 414. Improvements began to attract the airlines: O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s first international terminal opened in August 1958, and by April 1959 the airport had expanded to with new hangars, terminals, parking and other facilities. The expressway link to downtown Chicago, now known as the Kennedy Expressway, was completed in 1960. New Terminals2 and3, designed by C. F. Murphy and Associates, opened on January 1, 1962.

The biggest factor driving airlines to relocate their operations from Midway to O&#x27;Hare was the jet airliner; the first scheduled jet at O&#x27;Hare was an American 707 from New York to Chicago to San Francisco on March 22, 1959. One-mile-square (2.6-kilometer-square) Midway had no space for the runways that 707s and DC-8s required. Airlines had been reluctant to move to O&#x27;Hare, but they naturally did not want to split their operations: in July 1962, the last fixed-wing scheduled airline flight in Chicago moved from Midway to O&#x27;Hare. Until United returned in July 1964, Midway&#x27;s only scheduled airline was Chicago Helicopter Airways. The arrival of Midway&#x27;s traffic quickly made O&#x27;Hare the world&#x27;s busiest airport, serving 10 million passengers annually. Within two years, that number would double, with Chicagoans boasting that more people passed through O&#x27;Hare in 12 months than Ellis Island had processed in its entire existence. O&#x27;Hare remained the world&#x27;s busiest airport until it was eclipsed by Hartsfield-Jackson Atlanta International Airport in 1998.

O&#x27;Hare had four runways in 1955; runway 14R/32L opened in 1956 and was extended to a few years later, allowing nonstops to Europe. Runway 9R/27L (now 10L/28R) opened in 1968 and runway 4R/22L in 1971.

===Post-deregulation developments===
In the 1980s, after passage of US airline deregulation, the first major change at O&#x27;Hare occurred when TWA left Chicago for St. Louis as its main mid-continent hub. Although TWA had a large hangar complex at O&#x27;Hare and had started Constellation nonstops to Paris in 1958, by the time of deregulation its operation was losing $25 million a year under competition from United and American. Northwest likewise ceded O&#x27;Hare to the competition and shifted to a Minneapolis/St. Paul and Detroit-centered network by the early 1990s after acquiring Republic Airlines in 1986. Delta maintained an O&#x27;Hare hub for some time, even commissioning a new ConcourseL in 1983. Ultimately, Delta found competing from an inferior position at O&#x27;Hare too expensive and closed its Chicago hub in the 1990s, concentrating its upper Midwest operations at Cincinnati.

The dominant hubs established at O&#x27;Hare in the 1980s by United and American continue to operate today. United developed a new two-concourse Terminal1 (dubbed &quot;The Terminal for Tomorrow&quot;), designed by Helmut Jahn. It was built between 1985 and 1987 on the site of the original Terminal1; the structure, which includes 50 gates, is best known for its curved glass forms and the connecting underground tunnel between ConcoursesB andC. The tunnel is illuminated with a neon installation titled &quot;Sky&#x27;s the Limit&quot; (1987) by Canadian artist Michael Hayden, which plays an airy, slow-tempo version of &quot;Rhapsody in Blue&quot;. American renovated and expanded its existing facilities in Terminal3 from 1987 to 1990; those renovations feature a flag-lined entrance hall to ConcoursesH/K.

The demolition of the original Terminal 1 in 1984 to make way for Jahn&#x27;s design forced a &quot;temporary&quot; relocation of international flights into facilities called &quot;Terminal4&quot; on the ground floor of the airport&#x27;s central parking garage. International passengers were then transferred by bus to and from their aircraft. Relocation finally ended with the completion of the 21-gate International Terminal in 1993 (now called Terminal5); it contains all customs facilities. Its location, on the site of the original cargo area and east of the terminal core, necessitated the construction of a peoplemover, which connected the terminal core with the new terminal as well as remote rental and parking lots.

Following deregulation and the buildup of the American and United hubs, O&#x27;Hare faced increasing delays from the late 1980s onward due to its inefficient runway layout; the airfield had remained unchanged since the addition of its last new runway (4R/22L) in 1971. O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s three pairs of angled runways were meant to allow takeoffs into the wind, but they came at a cost: the various intersecting runways were both dangerous and inefficient. Official reports at the end of the 1990s ranked O&#x27;Hare as one of the worst-performing airports in the United States based on the percentage of delayed flights. In 2001, the Chicago Department of Aviation committed to an O&#x27;Hare Modernization Plan (OMP). Initially estimated at $6.6 billion, the OMP was to be paid by bonds issued against the increase in the federal passenger facility charge enacted that year and federal airport improvement funds. The modernization plan was approved by the FAA in October 2005 and involved a complete reconfiguration of the airfield. The OMP included the construction of four new runways, lengthening two existing runways, and decommissioning three old runways to provide O&#x27;Hare with six parallel runways and two crosswind runways.

The OMP was the subject of legal battles, both with suburbs who feared the new layout&#x27;s noise implications as well as with survivors of persons interred in a cemetery the city proposed to relocate; some of the cases were not resolved until 2011. These issues, plus the reduction in traffic as a result of the Great Recession, delayed the OMP&#x27;s completion; construction of the sixth and final parallel runway (9C/27C) began in 2016. Its completion in 2020, along with an extension of runway 9R/27L completed in 2021, concluded the OMP.

===Expansion===

In 2018, the city and airlines committed to PhaseI of a new Terminal Area Plan dubbed O&#x27;Hare 21. The plan calls for two all-new satellite concourses to the southwest of Concourse C, and to expand Terminals 2 and 5 with additional gates, lounges, and updates to operations all over the airport. (Terminal 5 has ten new gates in addition to its newly expanded facilities, plus two additional gates to each accommodate an Airbus A380.) The expansion will enable same-terminal transfers between international and domestic flights, faster connections, improved facilities and technology for TSA and customs inspections and much larger landside amenities such as shopping and restaurants. A principal feature of the plan is the reorganization of the terminal core into an &quot;alliance hub,&quot; the first in North America; airside connections and layout will be optimized around airline alliances. This will be made possible by the construction of the O&#x27;Hare Global Terminal (OGT) where Terminal2 currently stands. The OGT and two new satellite concourses will allow for expansion for both American&#x27;s and United&#x27;s international operations as well as easy interchange with their respective Oneworld (American) and Star Alliance (United) partner carriers, eliminating the need to transfer to Terminal 5.

The project will add over to the airport&#x27;s terminals, add a new customs processing center in the OGT, reconstruct gates and concourses (new concourses will be a minimum of wide), increase the gate count from 185 to 235, and provide 25% more ramp space at every gate throughout the airport to accommodate larger aircraft. After an international design competition that featured public voting on five final architectural proposals, the Studio ORD group, led by architect Jeanne Gang (in collaboration with SCB, Corgan, Milhouse, and STL Architect), was selected to design the OGT, while Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill LLP will design Satellites1 and2. By terms of the agreement, total costs of $8.5 billion for the project are to be borne by bonds issued by the city, which will be retired by airport usage fees paid by airlines. O&#x27;Hare 21 is scheduled for completion of the two satellite terminals in 2028, and overall completion in 2030.

By November 2023, the project&#x27;s cost had ballooned far over budget, leading both American Airlines and United Airlines to call for the global terminal project to be cancelled or scaled back. On May 3, 2024, American Airlines and United Airlines were able to reach an agreement with the City of Chicago to allow the project to continue. In the agreement, the replacement of Terminal 2 would be accelerated, while the addition of Satellite 2 concourse would be delayed. The replacement of Terminal 2 with the OGT was deemed more critical to complete first instead of the Satellite 2 concourse. The design of Satellite 1 concourse was presented to the public on May 29, 2024, it was planned to complete Satellite 1 concourse by 2028.

==Facilities==

===Terminals===
O&#x27;Hare has four numbered passenger terminals with nine lettered concourses and a total of 213 gates—the most of any airport in the world.

* is used for United Airlines, Lufthansa and All Nippon Airways flights. It has 52 gates on two concourses, lettered B–C.
* is used for most United Express and some United flights, as well as all Air Canada, Alaska Airlines, and JetBlue flights. It has 41 gates on two concourses, lettered E–F.
* is used for American Airlines, Aer Lingus, British Airways, Iberia, Japan Airlines, and Spirit Airlines flights. It has 80 gates on four concourses, lettered G, H, K, and L.
* is used for Delta Air Lines, Frontier Airlines and Southwest Airlines flights, as well as all international airlines that do not depart from Terminals 1–3. Terminal 5 is also used for non-pre–cleared international arrivals, as it currently contains the airport&#x27;s U.S. Customs and Border Protection facilities. It has 35 non-sequential gates on a single concourse with the highest number being 40, lettered M. There are 3 gates in this terminal that can accommodate an Airbus A380- the largest commercial airplane in the world.

Terminals 1–3 are connected airside via a walkway. Terminal 5 is separated from the others by taxiways and does not have a walkway between it and Terminals 1–3; passengers transferring between Terminal 5 and the others can only do so landside via a shuttle bus or the Airport Transit System, requiring rescreening at security, or via an airside shuttle bus that runs between Terminal 5 and Terminals 1 and 3 every 15 minutes from 11:30 am to 9:30 pm.

===Runways===
O&#x27;Hare has two sets of parallel runways, one on either side of the terminal complex. Each airfield has three parallel east–west runways (9L/27R, 9C/27C, and 9R/27L on the north side; 10L/28R, 10C/28C, and 10R/28L on the south side) and a crosswind runway oriented northeast–southwest (4L/22R on the north, 4R/22L on the south). The north crosswind runway, 4L/22R, sees limited usage due to intersecting 9R/27L and 9C/27C; however, runway 22L is often used for takeoffs during what is called &quot;west flow&quot; on the main runways. The airfield is managed by three FAA air traffic control towers. O&#x27;Hare has a voluntary nighttime (22:00–07:00) noise abatement program.

In 2015, runway 32R/14L was permanently closed after 72 years of service, in favor of the new runway 10R/28L. In 2019, runway 32L/14R was also closed.

Currently, O&#x27;Hare has the most runways of any civilian airport in the world, totaling eight.

===Hotel===
The Hilton Chicago O&#x27;Hare is between the terminal core and parking garage and is currently the only hotel on airport property. It is owned by the Chicago Department of Aviation and operated under an agreement with Hilton Hotels, who extended their agreement with the city by ten years in 2018.

===Ground transportation===
The Airport Transit System shuttles passengers between the terminal core (Terminals 1–3), Terminal 5, and the O&#x27;Hare Multi-Modal Facility (MMF). The system, which re-opened on November 3, 2021, resumed round-the-clock service starting at 5 a.m. on Monday, April 18, 2022, after a nearly six-year renovation. Meanwhile, free shuttle buses also continue to run 24/7 and contribute to congestion, boarding on the upper (departures) level of all terminals. The Bus Shuttle center, located on the ground level of the parking garage between Terminals 1–3 and directly opposite the Hilton Hotel, provides a temporary boarding location for local hotel shuttles and regional public transport buses. The O&#x27;Hare Multi-Modal Facility is the home of all on-airport car rental firms as well as some extended parking. In addition, the Chicago-area commuter rail system, Metra, has a transfer station of its North Central Service (NCS) located at the northeast corner of the MMF; however, the NCS currently operates an occasional schedule on weekdays only.

The CTA Blue Line&#x27;s north terminus is at and provides direct service to downtown via the Milwaukee–Dearborn subway in the Loop and continuing to west suburban Forest Park. Trains depart at intervals ranging from every four to thirty minutes, 24 hours a day. The station is located on the lower level of the parking garage, and can be accessed directly from Terminals1–3 via tunnel and from Terminal5 via shuttle bus.

Pace, Peoria Charter, Van Galder Bus Company, and Wisconsin Coach Lines operate bus service to O&#x27;Hare, stopping at the MMF.

O&#x27;Hare is directly served by Interstate 190, which offers interchanges with Mannheim Road (U.S. 12 and 45), the Tri-State Tollway (Interstate 294), and Interstate 90. I-90 continues as the Kennedy Expressway into downtown Chicago and becomes the Jane Addams Memorial Tollway northwest to Rockford and the Wisconsin state line.

===Cargo facilities===
There are presently two main cargo areas at O&#x27;Hare. The South Cargo Area was relocated in the 1980s from the airport&#x27;s first air cargo facilities, located east of the terminal core, where Terminal5 now stands. Many of the structures in this new cargo area then had to be rebuilt, again, to allow for the OMP and specifically runway 10R/28L; as a result, what is now called the South Cargo Area is located between 10R/28L and 10C/28C. This large collection of facilities, in three sections (Southwest, South Central, and Southeast), was established mainly by traditional airline-based air cargo; Air France Cargo, American, JAL Cargo, KLM, Lufthansa Cargo, Northwest and United all built purpose-built, freestanding cargo facilities, although some of these are now leased out to dedicated cargo firms. In addition, the area contains two separate facilities for shipper FedEx and one for UPS.

The Northeast Cargo Area (NEC) is a conversion of the former military base (the Douglas plant area) at the northeast corner of the airport property. It is a new facility designed to increase O&#x27;Hare&#x27;s cargo capacity by 50%. Two buildings currently make up the NEC: a building completed in 2016, and a building that was completed in 2017. A third structure will complete the NEC with another of warehouse space.

The current capability of the cargo areas provide of airside cargo space with parking for 40 wide-body freighters matched with over of landside warehousing capability. O&#x27;Hare shipped over in 2018, fifth among airports in the U.S.

===Other facilities===
In 2011, O&#x27;Hare became the first major airport to build an apiary on its property; every summer, it hosts as many as 75 hives and a million bees. The bees are maintained by 30 to 40 ex-offenders with little to no work experience and few marketable skills; they are primarily recruited from Chicago&#x27;s North Lawndale neighborhood. They are taught beekeeping but also benefit from the bees&#x27; labor, turning it into bottled fresh honey, soaps, lip balms, candles and moisturizers marketed under the &quot;beelove&quot; product line. More than 500 persons have completed the program, transferring to jobs in manufacturing, food processing, customer service, and hospitality; the repeat-offender rate is reported to be less than 10%.

The CDA&#x27;s Airport Airfield Operations section is based out of the tall prototype tower architect I.M. Pei designed for the FAA in the 1960s -1970s.

==Major accidents and incidents==

The following is a list of major crashes or incidents that occurred to planes at O&#x27;Hare, on approach, or just after takeoff from the airport:
* On September 17, 1961, Northwest Orient Airlines Flight 706, a Lockheed L-188 Electra, crashed upon takeoff, killing all 37 on board.
* On August 16, 1965, United Airlines Flight 389, a Boeing 727, crashed into Lake Michigan, east of O&#x27;Hare while on approach, killing all 30 on board.
* On December 27, 1968, North Central Airlines Flight 458, a Convair CV-580, crashed into a hangar at O&#x27;Hare, killing 27 on board and one on the ground.

<text>The music of Iraq or Iraqi music, (), also known as the music of Mesopotamia, encompasses the music of a number of ethnic groups and musical genres. Ethnically, it includes Mesopotamian Arabic, Assyrian, Kurdish and the music of Turkmen, among others. Apart from the traditional music of these peoples, Iraqi music includes contemporary music styles such as pop, rock, soul and urban contemporary. 

Iraq is recognized mainly for three instruments, the Oud, Iraqi Santur and Joza. The country&#x27;s oud playing tradition has become an own school and a reference. It is illustrated specially by the figure of the acclaimed Munir Bashir. Other renowned Oudists are Naseer Shamma, Omar Bashir, Jamil Bachir, Ahmed Mukhtar, Rahim AlHaj, and Sahar Taha.

== History ==
=== Instruments ===
In 1929, archaeologists led by the British archaeologist Leonard Woolley, representing a joint expedition of the British Museum and the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology, discovered the Lyres of Ur or Harps of Ur, which are considered to be the world&#x27;s second oldest surviving stringed instruments when excavating the Royal Cemetery of Ur between from 1922 and 1934. They discovered pieces of three lyres and one harp in Ur, located in what was Ancient Mesopotamia, modern day Iraq. They are over 4,500 years old, from ancient Mesopotamia during the Early Dynastic III Period (2550–2450 BC). The decorations on the lyres are fine examples of the court art of Mesopotamia of the period.

==Classical Iraqi music==
Iraqi classical music necessitates some discussion of the social environment, as well as references to the poetry. Poetry is always rendered clearly. Poetry is the art of the Iraqis, and sung poetry is the finest of all. In Baghdad from 760 to 1260, writers spurned musical notation. The music is melodically modal, and moves in a stepwise motion with repeated notes. Use of the lower end of a melodic range is characteristic, as is the use of silence; one listens through the silence. Following a cadence, the singer moves up to the next range of pitches. An arch shape is discernible, and the work ends in the original mode.

Singers of the Baghdad Court were praised for their excellence in composition, their knowledge of history and songs, and their ornaments and innovations. There was support for female singers and orators, such as Arib, a skilled poet, calligrapher, lutenist, composer, and backgammon player who wrote more than one thousand songs. The common instrument (comparable in popularity to the piano or violin in the west) is the oud. Classical Iraqi music is identifiable by the genre/canon, and by how it is performed.

Historically, music would have been played for gatherings of men. With the advent of the sound recording industry, things have changed somewhat. Today one invites musicians to perform at weddings; by the first quarter of the century, concerts were being staged at concert venues.

===Maqam===

Across the Arab world, refers to specific melodic modes. When a musician performs performances, the performer improvises, based on rules. There are between fifty and seventy , each with its own mood and characteristics, and many of which have sub-styles. Other characteristics of Iraqi music include a slow tempo, rhythmically free ornamentation or melodic lines, and predominantly minor modes. Instruments include , , , , , , and . Baghdad&#x27;s &quot;Chalgi&quot; ensembles typically include the and , and may also utilize an .

Maqama texts are often derived from classical Arabic poetry, such as by Muhammad Mahdi al-Jawahiri, al-Mutanabbi and Abu Nuwas, or Persian poets like Hafez and Omar Khayyám. Some performers used traditional sources translated into the dialect of Baghdad, and still others use Arabic, Turkish, Armenian, Hebrew, Turkmen, Aramaic or Persian language lyrics.

====History====

The roots of modern Iraqi maqam can be traced as far back as the Abbasid Caliphate, when that large empire was controlled from Baghdad.

The pesteh, a kind of light song which concludes a maqam performance, has been popularized in the later 20th century, growing more prominent along with the rise of recorded music and broadcast radio. Among the most popular pesteh performers are the husband and wife Salima Pasha and Nazem Al-Ghazali.

The most popular modern singers of maqam are Rachid Al-Qundarchi (1887–1945), Youssouf Omar (1918–1987), Nazem Al-Ghazali (1920–1963), Salim Shibbeth (born 1908), Hassan Chewke (1912–1962), Najim Al-Sheikhli (1893–1938), Mohammed Al-Qubanchi (1900–1989), Hamid Al Saadi (1959-) and Farida Mohammad Ali (1963- ).

==Modern era==
In 1936, Iraq Radio was established by two of Iraq&#x27;s most prominent performers and composers, the Kuwaiti-born Iraqi Jewish musicians, Saleh and Daoud al-Kuwaity with an ensemble, with the exception of the percussion player. The nightclubs of Baghdad also featured almost entirely Jewish musicians. At these nightclubs, ensembles consisted of oud, qanun and two percussionists while the same format with ney and cello were used on the radio.

One of the reasons for the predominance of Jewish instrumentalists in early 20th century Iraqi music was a prominent school for blind Jewish children, which was founded in the late 1920s by the great &quot;qanunji&quot; (&quot;qanun player&quot;) Joseph Hawthorne (&quot;Yusef Za&#x27;arur&quot;) ( ).

The most famous singer of the 1930s–1940s was perhaps the Iraqi Jewish singer Salima Pasha. The respect and adoration for Pasha were unusual at the time, since public performance by women was considered shameful and most female singers were recruited from brothels.

Numerous instrumentalists and singers of the middle and late twentieth century were trained at the Baghdad Conservatory.

In recent years the Iraqi school of oud players has become very prominent, with players such as Salman Shukur and Munir Bashir developing a very refined and delicate style of playing combining older Arabic elements with more recent Anatolian influences.

==Pop music==

Until the fall of Saddam Hussein, the most popular radio station was the Voice of Youth, which used to play the popular music of Iraq to continue the culture of the country. The station also played a mix of rock, hip hop and pop music, all of which had to be imported via Jordan due to international economic sanctions. Irish bands The Corrs and Westlife were especially popular. Iraq also produced a major pan-Arab pop star in exile in Kadim Al Sahir, whose songs include &quot;Ladghat-e Hayya&quot;, which was banned by Hussein for its racy lyrical content.

Other modern Iraqi singers include Ali Al Essawi, whose song &quot;Makhtuba&quot; became huge hit in the Arab world and made him famous throughout the region. Major artists include Shatha Hassoun, Rahma Mezher, Majid al-Muhandis, Hussam Al-Rassam, Rida Al Abdullah and Iraq&#x27;s very own boy band Unknown to No One, as well as Acrassicauda, Iraq&#x27;s first heavy metal band. There are also ethnic Assyrian singers such as Klodia Hanna, Ashur Bet Sargis and Linda George as well as a number of Kurdish, Turkmen, Yazidi, Dom and Armenian musicians such as Seta Hagopian.

==Effect of 2003 Iraq War==
After the 2003 invasion of Iraq and fall of Saddam Hussein, and with some religious figures coming to power, concerts were forbidden in areas considered as &quot;conservative&quot;. However, since 2018, many concert were held in different areas throughout the country. In 2021, Babylon arts festival was held for the first time in almost 20 years. Performers were from Iraq, Middle East, Europe and Africa.

<text>The Raytheon Company was a major U.S. defense contractor and industrial corporation with manufacturing concentrations in weapons and military and commercial electronics. Founded in 1922, it merged in 2020 with United Technologies Corporation to form Raytheon Technologies, which changed its name to RTX Corporation in July 2023. 

Raytheon was established in 1922, reincorporated in 1928, and adopted the Raytheon Company name in 1959. More than 90% of Raytheon&#x27;s revenues were obtained from military contracts and, as of 2012, it was the fifth-largest military contractor in the world. , it was the third-largest defense contractor in the United States by defense revenue. It was the world&#x27;s largest producer of guided missiles, and was involved in corporate and special-mission aircraft until early 2007. In 2018, the company had around 67,000 employees worldwide and annual revenues of about US$25.35 billion.

Over the years, Raytheon shifted its headquarters among various Massachusetts locations: Cambridge from 1922 to 1928; Newton until 1941; Waltham until 1961; and finally, Lexington until 2003.

==History==

===Early years===
In 1922, Vannevar Bush, scientist and professor in the Department of Electrical Engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), along with engineer and physicist Laurence K. Marshall, and scientist Charles G. Smith, founded the American Appliance Company in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Its focus, which was originally on new refrigeration technology, soon shifted to electronics. The company&#x27;s first product was a gaseous (helium) voltage-regulator tube that was based on Charles Smith&#x27;s earlier astronomical research of the star Zeta Puppis. The electron tube was christened with the name &quot;Raytheon&quot; (a compound of Old French and Greek meaning &#x27;light from the gods&#x27;) and was used in a battery eliminator, a type of radio-receiver power supply that plugged into the power grid in place of large batteries. This made it possible to convert household alternating current to a regulated, high voltage direct current for radios and thus eliminate the need for expensive, short-lived batteries.

In 1925, the company changed its name to Raytheon Manufacturing Company and began marketing its rectifier, under the Raytheon brand name, with commercial success. In 1928 Raytheon merged with Q.R.S. Company, an American manufacturer of electron tubes and switches, to form the successor of the same name, Raytheon Manufacturing Company. By the 1930s, it had already grown to become one of the world&#x27;s largest vacuum tube manufacturing companies. In 1933 it diversified by acquiring Acme-Delta Company, a producer of transformers, power equipment, and electronic auto parts.

===During World War II===
Early in World War II, physicists in the United Kingdom invented the magnetron, a specialized microwave-generating electron tube that markedly improved the capability of radar to detect enemy aircraft. American companies were then sought by the US government to perfect and mass-produce the magnetron for ground-based, airborne, and shipborne radar systems, and, with support from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology&#x27;s Radiation Laboratory (recently formed to investigate microwave radar), Raytheon received a contract to build the devices. Within a few month, Raytheon began to manufacture magnetron tubes for use in radar sets, and then complete radar systems. During the war, Raytheon also pioneered the production of shipboard radar systems, particularly for submarine detection. Raytheon was also a contractor for the mass-production of miniature shock-resistant vacuum tubes used in proximity fuses. These tubes were difficult to manufacture and required rigorous attention to detail. At war&#x27;s end in 1945, the company had built about 80 percent of all magnetrons. Raytheon ranked 71st among U.S. corporations in the value of World War II military production contracts.

In 1945, Raytheon&#x27;s Percy Spencer invented the microwave oven by discovering that the magnetron could rapidly heat food. In 1947, the company demonstrated the Radarange microwave oven for commercial use.

===After World War II===
During the post-war years, Raytheon also made generally low- to medium-powered radio and television transmitters and related equipment for the commercial market, but the high-powered market was solidly in the hands of larger, better-financed competitors such as Continental Electronics, General Electric and Radio Corporation of America.

In 1946, the company expanded its electronics capability through acquisitions that included the Submarine Signal Company (founded in 1901), a leading manufacturer of maritime safety equipment. With its broadened capabilities, Raytheon developed the first guidance system for a missile that could intercept a flying target. In 1948, Charles Francis Adams IV was appointed president of the company and served until 1960. In 1948, Raytheon began to manufacture guided missiles. In 1950, its Lark became the first such missile to destroy a target aircraft in flight. Raytheon then received military contracts to develop the air-to-air Sparrow and ground-to-air Hawk missiles, projects that received impetus from the Korean War. In later decades, it remained a major producer of missiles, such as the Patriot antimissile missile and the air-to-air Phoenix missile.

Raytheon made a foray into computers, producing the RAYDAC computer for the U.S. Navy which became operational in 1953. &quot;Unfortunately, the machine was technically obsolete by the time it was operational.&quot; Also in 1953, the company began work on a follow-on, the RAYCOM, which was never completed. In 1954, it entered into a joint venture with Honeywell to form the Datamatic corporation. However it sold its interest to Honeywell a year later, before introduction of the DATAmatic 1000 system.

In 1958, Raytheon acquired the marine electronics company Applied Electronics Company to make commercial marine navigation and radio gear, as well as less-expensive Japanese suppliers of products such as marine/weather band radios and direction-finding gear. In the same year, it changed its name to Raytheon Company.

In the 1950s, Raytheon began manufacturing transistors, including the CK722, priced and marketed to hobbyists.

In 1961, the British electronics company A.C. Cossor merged with Raytheon, following its sale by Philips. The new company&#x27;s name was Raytheon Cossor. The Cossor side of the organisation was still in the Raytheon group in 2010.

In 1965, it acquired Amana Refrigeration, Inc., a manufacturer of refrigerators and air conditioners. Using the Amana brand name and its distribution channels, Raytheon began selling the first countertop household microwave oven in 1967 and became a dominant manufacturer in the microwave oven business.

In 1966, the company entered the educational publishing business with the acquisition of D.C. Heath and Company, marketing an influential physics textbook developed by the Physical Science Study Committee. Raytheon also manufactured the Apollo Guidance Computer, which was introduced that year and flew aboard all NASA Project Apollo missions.

In the late 1970s, Raytheon acquired McGraw-Edison&#x27;s appliances division notable for the Speed Queen line of washers and dryers.

===1980s===
In 1980, Raytheon acquired Beech Aircraft Corporation, a leading manufacturer of general aviation aircraft founded in 1932 by Walter H. Beech. In 1993, the company expanded its aircraft activities by adding the Hawker line of business jets by acquiring Corporate Jets Inc., the business jet product line of British Aerospace (now BAE Systems). These two entities were merged in 1994 to become the Raytheon Aircraft Company. In the first quarter of 2007 Raytheon sold its aircraft operations, which subsequently operated as Hawker Beechcraft, and since 2014 have been units of Textron Aviation. The product line of Raytheon&#x27;s aircraft subsidiary included business jets such as the Hawker 800XP and Hawker 4000, the Beechjet 400A, and the Premier I; the popular King Air series of twin turboprops; and piston-engine aircraft such as the Bonanza. Its special-mission aircraft included the single-turboprop T-6A Texan II, which the United States Air Force and United States Navy had chosen as their primary training aircraft.

===1990s===
In 1991, during the Persian Gulf War, Raytheon&#x27;s Patriot missile received great international exposure, resulting in a substantial increase in sales for the company outside the United States. In an effort to establish leadership in the defense electronics business, Raytheon purchased in quick succession Dallas-based E-Systems (1995); Chrysler Corporation&#x27;s defense electronics and aircraft-modification businesses, which had previously acquired companies such as Electrospace systems (1996) (portions of these businesses were later sold to L-3 Communications), and the defense unit of Texas Instruments, Defense Systems &amp; Electronics Group (1997). Also in 1997, Raytheon acquired the aerospace and defense business of Hughes Aircraft Company from Hughes Electronics Corporation, a subsidiary of General Motors, which included a number of product lines previously purchased by Hughes Electronics, including the former General Dynamics missile business (Pomona facility), the defense portion of Delco Electronics (Delco Systems Operations), and Magnavox Electronic Systems. 

Raytheon also divested itself of several nondefense businesses in the 1990s, including Amana Refrigeration, Raytheon Commercial Laundry (purchased by Bain Capital&#x27;s Alliance Laundry Systems), and Seismograph Service Ltd (sold to Schlumberger-Geco-Prakla). On October 12, 1999, Raytheon exited the personal rapid transit (PRT) business as it terminated its PRT 2000 system due to the high cost of development and the lack of interest.

===2000s===
During the September 11 attacks of 2001, Raytheon had an office in the South Tower of the World Trade Center on the 91st floor. Their office, being 6 floors above where United Airlines Flight 175 collided with the building, was spared from the immediate collision, but was utterly destroyed in the subsequent collapse of the South Tower.

In November 2007, Raytheon purchased Sarcos for an undisclosed sum, seeking to expand into robotics research and production.

In September 2009, Raytheon purchased Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc. as a wholly owned subsidiary.

===2010s===

In December 2010, Applied Signal Technology agreed to be acquired by Raytheon for $490 million.

In October 2014, Raytheon beat rivals Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman for a contract to build 3DELRR, a next-generation long-range radar system, for the USAF worth an estimated $1 billion.

The contract award was immediately protested by Raytheon&#x27;s competitors, Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman. After re-evaluating the bids following the protests, the USAF decided to delay awarding the 3DELRR EMD contract until 2017 and was to issue an amended solicitation at the end of July 2016. In 2017 the USAF again awarded the contract to Raytheon.

In May 2015, Raytheon acquired cybersecurity firm Websense, Inc. from Vista Equity Partners for $1.9 billion and combined it with RCP, formerly part of its IIS segment to form Raytheon|Websense. In October 2015, Raytheon|Websense acquired Foreground Security for $62 million. In January 2016, Raytheon|Websense acquired the firewall provider Stonesoft from Intel Security for an undisclosed amount and renamed itself to Forcepoint.

In July 2016, Poland&#x27;s Defence Minister Antoni Macierewicz planned to sign a letter of intent with Raytheon for a $5.6 billion deal to upgrade its Patriot missile-defence shield.

In 2017, Saudi Arabia signed business deals worth billions of dollars with multiple American companies, including Raytheon.

In July 2019, Qatar&#x27;s Ministry of Defense committed to acquire Raytheon&#x27;s NASAM and Patriot missile defense systems. The company would later be fined for paying bribes to a Qatari officials to influence defense purchases.

===2020s===
In February 2020, Raytheon completed the first radar antenna array for the US Army&#x27;s new missile defense radar, known as the Lower Tier Air and Missile Defense Sensor (LTAMDS), to replace the service&#x27;s Patriot air and missile defense system sensor.

In April 2020, the company merged with United Technologies Corporation to form Raytheon Technologies. The merged company is headquartered in Arlington, Virginia rather than UTC&#x27;s base in Farmington, Connecticut.

Raytheon was sanctioned by the Chinese government in October 2020, and February 2023 due to arm sales to Taiwan.

In July 2023, Raytheon Technologies renamed themselves to RTX Corporation and merged the Raytheon Intelligence &amp; Space and Raytheon Missiles &amp; Defense business segments to form a new Raytheon business segment.

In August 2024, RTX agreed to pay a $200 million fine for the unauthorized export of defense technology to China, Russia, Iran, and elsewhere, to settle more than 750 violations of the Arms Export Control Act and the International Traffic in Arms Regulations, or ITAR. The company was allowed to pay only half the fine to the government and to put half of the fine toward “remedial compliance measures to strengthen RTX’s compliance program.” In October 2024, RTX agreed to pay nearly $1 billion to settle allegations of defrauding the U.S. Defense Department and bribing a Qatari military official. Company officials said the misconduct mostly occurred before 2020 and pledged to improve its compliance programs.

==Environmental record==
Two lawsuits were filed against a Raytheon Company plant in St. Petersburg, Florida, due to concern with health risks, property values, and contamination in April 2008. Raytheon was given until the end of the month to independently test whether or not the groundwater that originated from its area was contaminated. According to the Florida Department of Environmental Protection (DEP), the groundwater contained carcinogenic contaminants, including trichloroethylene, 1,4-dioxane, and vinyl chloride. The DEP also reported that the clouds contained other toxins, such as lead and toluene.

In 1995, Raytheon acquired Dallas-based E-Systems, including a site in St. Petersburg, Florida, In November 1991, prior to Raytheon&#x27;s acquisition, contamination had been discovered at the E-Systems site. Soil and groundwater had been contaminated with the volatile organic compounds trichloroethylene and 1,4-Dioxane. In 2005, groundwater monitoring indicated polluted groundwater was moving into areas outside the site. According to DEP documentation, Raytheon has tested wells on its site since 1996 but had not delivered a final report; therefore, it was given a deadline on May 31, 2008, to investigate its groundwater. Contamination in the area has not affected anyone&#x27;s drinking water supply or health, yet due to negative local media coverage lawsuits are being filed with claims against Raytheon citing decreases in property values.

In another case, Raytheon was ordered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to treat groundwater at the Tucson Plant (acquired during the merger with Hughes) in Arizona since Raytheon used and disposed metals, chlorinated solvents, and other substances at the plant since 1951. The EPA further required the installation and operation of an oxidation process system to treat the solvents and make the water safe to drink.

On 9 August 2006, The Stream Contact Centre in Derry, Northern Ireland, which had a contract with Raytheon at the time, was attacked by protesters. They destroyed the computers, documents, and mainframe of the office, and proceeded to occupy it for eight hours prior to their arrest.

The activists were charged with criminal damage and affray under terrorism laws. The trial of six of the accused began May 19, 2008, in the Laganside Courts in Belfast. Colm Bryce, Gary Donnelly, Kieran Gallagher, Michael Gallagher, Sean Heaton, Jimmy Kelly, Paddy McDaid and Eamonn O&#x27;Donnell were acquitted of all charges on 11 June, with Eamonn McCann found guilty of the theft of two computer discs.

By 2013, the company was also awarded the Goal Achievement Award by the EPA for excellence in greenhouse gas management.

<text>Hong Kong International Airport is an international airport on the island of Chek Lap Kok in western Hong Kong. The airport is also referred to as Chek Lap Kok International Airport or Chek Lap Kok Airport, to distinguish it from its predecessor, the former Kai Tak Airport.

Opened in 1998, Hong Kong International Airport is the world&#x27;s busiest cargo gateway and one of the world&#x27;s busiest passenger airports. It is also home to one of the world&#x27;s largest passenger terminal buildings, which was the largest when the airport opened.

The airport is operated by Airport Authority Hong Kong (AAHK), a statutory body of the Hong Kong government established on 1 December 1995. It runs 24 hours a day and is the primary hub for Cathay Pacific, Greater Bay Airlines, Hong Kong Airlines, HK Express, and Air Hong Kong (cargo carrier). The airport is one of the hubs of Oneworld, and also one of the Asia-Pacific cargo hubs for UPS Airlines. It is a focus city for China Airlines and China Eastern Airlines. Ethiopian Airlines utilizes Hong Kong as a stopover point for their flights.

Hong Kong International Airport, which employed about 60,000 people at the start of 2024, is an important contributor to Hong Kong&#x27;s economy. The economic contribution generated by Hong Kong&#x27;s air travel industry in 2018 amounted to US$33 billion, 10.2% of Hong Kong&#x27;s GDP. More than 100 airlines operate flights from the airport to over 180 cities across the globe. In 2015, HKIA handled 68.5 million passengers, making it the 8th busiest airport worldwide by passenger traffic and the 4th busiest airport worldwide by international passenger traffic. Since 2010, it has also surpassed Memphis International Airport to become the world&#x27;s busiest airport by cargo traffic (excluding 2020 due to disruptions related to the COVID-19 pandemic).

==History==


Chek Lap Kok Airport was designed as a replacement for the former Hong Kong International Airport (commonly known as Kai Tak Airport), built in 1925. Located in the densely built-up Kowloon City District with a single runway extending into Kowloon Bay, Hong Kong Airport had turned on the runway lights for expansion to cope with steadily increasing air traffic. By the 1990s, Kai Tak had become one of the world&#x27;s busiest airports, being a major hub for multiple passenger airlines along with a major cargo and maintenance hub – it far exceeded its annual passenger and cargo design capacities, and one out of every three flights experienced delays, largely due to a lack of space for aircraft, gates, and a second runway. In addition, noise mitigation measures restricted nighttime flights, as severe noise pollution (exceeding 105 dB(A) in Kowloon City) adversely affected an estimated 340,000 people at least.

A 1974 planning study by the Civil Aviation and Public Works departments identified the small island of Chek Lap Kok, off Lantau Island, as a possible future airport replacement site. Far from the congested city centre, flight paths would be routed over the South China Sea rather than crowded urban areas, enabling efficient round-the-clock operation of multiple runways. The Chek Lap Kok (CLK) airport master plan and civil engineering studies were completed between 1982 and 1983, respectively. However, in February 1983, the government shelved the project for financial and economic reasons. In 1988, the Port &amp; Airport Development Strategy (PADS) study was undertaken by consultants, headed by Mott MacDonald Hong Kong Limited, reporting in December 1989. This study looked at forecasts for both airport and port traffic to the year 2011 and came up with three recommended strategies for overall strategic development in Hong Kong. One of the three assumed maintaining the existing airport at Kai Tak; a second assumed a possible airport in the Western Harbour between Lantau Island and Hong Kong Island, and the third assumed a new airport at Chek Lap Kok. The consultants produced detailed analyses for each scenario, enabling the government to consider these appraisals for each of the three &quot;Recommended Strategies&quot;. In October 1989, the Governor of Hong Kong announced to the Legislative Council that a decision had been made on the territory&#x27;s long-term port and airport development strategy. The strategy was to be adopted that included a replacement airport at Chek Lap Kok and incorporating new container terminals 8 and 9 at Stonecutters Island and east of the Tsing Yi island, respectively.

In the PADS study, the consultants advised that the earliest the airport could be opened was January 1998. However, in reaching the government&#x27;s decision, this date was changed to January 1997, six months before the handover of Hong Kong to China. Construction of the new airport was began in 1991. As construction progressed, an agreement was reached with China that as much as possible of the airport would be completed before the handover to China in July 1997. British Prime Minister, John Major, opened the Tsing Ma Bridge, the main access to Lantau Island and the airport and its supporting community in May 1997. Soon after, the airport itself opened in July 1998.

The construction period was extremely rushed; specialists considered that only a 10–20 years period was sufficient for this massive project. Another cause for this rush was due to the uncertain future of the airport construction after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong to the People&#x27;s Republic of China. Shortly after the then-British colonial government of Hong Kong announced plans to construct the new airport, the Chinese government in Beijing began voicing objections to various aspects of the massive project, which prompted financial institutions to delay extending project finance. Without access to this financing, many of the companies who had secured contracts to build various portions of the project halted the construction, resulting in delays that pushed the actual opening of the airport which was originally planned to take place before the transition in sovereignty until one year after. As agreements were reached with the government in China, Beijing withdrew most of its objections and work then continued, albeit behind schedule.

Hong Kong International Airport was built on a large artificial island formed by flattening and levelling the former Chek Lap Kok and Lam Chau islands ( and respectively) and reclaiming of the adjacent seabed. The airport site with its reclamation, added nearly 1% to Hong Kong&#x27;s total surface area, connecting to the north side of Lantau Island near Tung Chung new town.

Construction of the new airport was only part of the Airport Core Programme, which also involved the construction of new roads and rail links to the airport, with associated bridges and tunnels, and major land reclamation projects on both Hong Kong Island and in Kowloon. The project holds the record for the most expensive airport project ever, according to Guinness World Records. The construction of the new airport was also voted as one of the Top 10 Construction Achievements of the 20th Century at the ConExpo conference in 1999.

The detailed design for the airport terminal was awarded to a consortium led by Mott Connell (the Hong Kong office of UK consultant Mott MacDonald) with British Airports Authority as the specialist designers for airport-related aspects, Foster and Partners as the architects, and Ove Arup as the specialist structural designers for the roof. Mott Connell was the designer for the foundations, all other structural components, and the mechanical and electrical work. The sides of the terminals, predominantly glass, were designed to break during high-speed winds, relieving pressure and allowing the terminal to withstand an intense typhoon.

The airport was officially opened in an opening ceremony by the President of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and General Secretary of the Communist Party Jiang Zemin at noon Hong Kong Time on 2 July 1998. Hours later, Air Force One, carrying the President of the United States Bill Clinton, landed at the new airport and became the first foreign visitor to arrive at the new airport. The actual operation of the airport commenced on 6 July 1998, concluding the six-year construction that cost 60 billion US dollar. On that day at 06:25 Hong Kong Time, Cathay Pacific Flight CX 889 from New York JFK Airport became the first commercial flight to land at the airport, pipping the original CX 292 from Rome which was the scheduled as the first arrival. However, the airport had already started to experience some technical difficulties on the first day of opening. The flight information display system (FIDS) had suddenly shut down which caused long delays. Shortly afterwards, the cargo-communication link with Kai Tak, where all the necessary data was stored (some still stored there then), went down. During the same period, someone accidentally deleted an important database for cargo services. This meant that cargo had to be manually stored. At one point, the airport had to turn away all air cargo and freight headed for and exported from Hong Kong (except food and medical supplies) while it sorted out the huge mess. HKIA simply could not keep up without an automated assistant-computer system. For three to five months after its opening, it suffered various severe organisational, mechanical, and technical problems that almost crippled the airport and its operations. Computer glitches were mostly to blame for the major crisis. Lau Kong-wah, a Hong Kong politician, was quoted saying, &quot;This was meant to be a first-class project, but it has turned into a ninth-class airport and a disgrace. Our airport has become the laughingstock of the world.&quot; At one time, the government reopened the cargo terminal at Kai Tak Airport to handle freight traffic because of a breakdown at the new cargo terminal, named Super Terminal One (ST1). However, after six months, the airport started to operate normally.

On 31 July 2000, Todd Salimuchai, a regularised illegal immigrant in Hong Kong with no provable nationality, forced his way through a security checkpoint using a fake pistol, took a woman hostage, and boarded a Cathay Pacific aircraft. He was demanded to be flown to Burma, which he claimed was his native country but had refused to admit him due to his lack of documents. He surrendered to the police two and a half hours later.

Officially opened in June 2007, the second airport terminal, called T2 (check-in facility only), is linked with the MTR Airport Express on a new platform. The terminal also features a new shopping mall, SkyPlaza, providing a large variety of shops and restaurants, together with a few entertainment facilities. T2 also houses a 36-bay coach station for buses to and from mainland China and 56 airline check-in counters, as well as customs and immigration facilities.

Besides T2, the SkyCity Nine Eagles Golf Course was opened in 2007 whereas the second airport hotel, the Hong Kong SkyCity Marriott Hotel, and a permanent cross-boundary ferry terminal, the Skypier, began operations in 2008 and 2009 respectively. Development around T2 also includes the AsiaWorld-Expo which started operation in late 2005. A second passenger concourse, the North Satellite Concourse (NSC), opened in 2010, followed by the Midfield Concourse in December 2015.

During August 2019, the airport was shut down multiple times as demonstrations were held inside the airport during the 2019–20 Hong Kong protests, over 160 flights were cancelled as both the arrivals and departures sections of the airport were occupied.

The third runway, also known as the North Runway, was opened in July 2022. It is the first part of the Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030 to be implemented. The third runway is 650 hectares in land area, roughly the size of Gibraltar. The Centre Runway and Terminal 2 of the airport were then closed to facilitate construction works, expansion and upgrades. The Centre Runway was reopened on the 28th of November 2024. Terminal 2 is undergoing major expansion and is expected to re-open in 2025.

==Composition==
Hong Kong International Airport covers an area of 4,707 acres or . The airport has a total of 89 boarding gates, with 77 jet bridge gates (1–22, 23–36, 40–50, 60–71, 201–219) and 12 virtual gates (228–230, 511–513, 520–524) which are used as assembly points for passengers, who are then ferried to the aircraft by apron buses. Of the 77 jet bridges, five (Gates 5, 23, 60, 62, 64) are capable of handling the Airbus A380, the current users of which are Asiana Airlines, British Airways, Emirates, Qantas and Singapore Airlines. Korean Air and China Southern Airlines previously operated a route to HKIA from Seoul and Beijing respectively using the Airbus A380, but these airlines decided to not use them due to unprofitable nature of the aircraft type. Air France, Lufthansa and Thai Airways International previously operated services to Hong Kong from Paris, Frankfurt and Bangkok using the Airbus A380, though they retired the aircraft types early due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

In addition to Chek Lap Kok, the airport occupies what was Lam Chau.

===Terminal 1===
Terminal 1 of the HKIA, with an area measuring , is one of the largest passenger airport terminal buildings in the world, after the likes of Dubai International Airport Terminal 3 and Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3.

Opened on 6 July 1998, Terminal 1 was the largest airport passenger terminal building, with a total gross floor area of . It briefly conceded the status to Bangkok&#x27;s Suvarnabhumi Airport () when the latter opened on 15 September 2006, but reclaimed the title when the East Hall was expanded, bringing the total area to its current size of . Terminal 1&#x27;s title as the world&#x27;s largest was surrendered to Beijing Capital International Airport Terminal 3 on 29 February 2008.

In late 2021, the air side of Terminal 1 started segregating mainland Chinese flights and other international flights into two separate zones, &quot;Green Zone&quot; and &quot;Orange Zone&quot;, to reduce the risk of cross infection of novel coronavirus between travellers and airport workers serving different destinations.

On 1 November 2022, the sky bridge opened as part of a wider HK$9 billion airport upgrade, connecting Terminal 1 to the T1 Satellite Concourse (T1S). Lined with glass floor panels at the edges, the 200 metre long and 28 metre high bridge, the largest of its kind, is high enough for an Airbus A380 to pass underneath.

====T1 Satellite Concourse====

In 2007, HKIA began the construction of a two-story T1 Satellite Concourse (T1S), previously known as the North Satellite Concourse (NSC), which opened in December 2009. This concourse was designed for narrow-body aircraft and is equipped with 10 jet bridges. The concourse has a floor area of and will be able to serve more than five million passengers annually. T1S was built so the airport could accommodate at least 90 percent of its passengers by aerobridges. It has two levels (one for departures and one for arrivals). A new sky bridge connecting Terminal 1 and T1S opened in November 2022, allowing passengers to walk above taxiing planes, saving time from taking the airport shuttle bus. 

====T1 Midfield Concourse====
On 25 January 2011, Airport Authority Hong Kong (AA) unveiled phase 1 of its midfield development project which was targeted for completion by the end of 2015. The midfield area is located to the west of Terminal 1 between the two existing runways. It was the then last piece of land on the airport island available for large-scale development. This includes 20 aircraft parking stands, three of which are wide enough to serve the Airbus A380 and cater for an additional 10 million passengers annually. Passengers reach the concourse through an extension of the underground automated people mover. A joint venture of Mott MacDonald and Arup led the design of the project. Gammon Construction undertook the construction work. The Concourse began operations on 28 December 2015, and the first flight that used it was the HX658 operated by the Hong Kong Airlines flying from Hong Kong to Okinawa. On 31 March 2016, the concourse was officially inaugurated in a ceremony marking its full commissioning.

===Former Terminal 2===

Former Terminal 2 with an area measuring , together with the SkyPlaza, opened on 28 February 2007 along with the opening of the Airport station&#x27;s Platform 3. It was only a low-cost carrier check-in and processing facility for departing passengers with no gates or arrival facilities (passengers were transported underground to gates at Terminal 1). The SkyPlaza was situated within. Former Terminal 2 was shut down on 28 November 2019 at 23:00 to make way for a new satellite terminal from the three-runway system.

===Other buildings===
Cathay Pacific City, the head office of Cathay Pacific and Air Hong Kong, is located on the airport island. CNAC House, the office for Air China is also located in the airport complex, together with the Civil Aviation Department headquarters. HAECO also has its head office on the airport property. HK Express has its head office on the airport property, in what was previously the Dragonair House, head office of Cathay Dragon.

The Government Flying Service (GFS) has its head office building in the airport. The head office of the Air Accident Investigation Authority (AAIA) is in the Facility Building on the airport property.

== Airport expansion projects ==

In June 2010, the Airport Authority unveiled plans to develop in stages the vast midfield site of the airport island. Stage 1 will involve the construction of a new 20-gate passenger concourse to be built in two phases (completion 2015 and 2020) with 11 gates in phase 1 growing to 20 gates in phase 2. The configuration of the new concourse is similar to those at Atlanta, Bangkok–Suvarnabhumi, Berlin (Terminal 1), Chicago–O&#x27;Hare (Global Terminal), Denver, Detroit (McNamara Terminal), London–Heathrow (Terminals 2 and 5), Los Angeles (TBIT), Munich (Terminal 2), Salt Lake City, Seoul–Incheon, Washington–Dulles and Felipe Ángeles International Airport (Zumpango). After stage 1 of midfield development is completed in 2020, there will be sufficient lands remaining for further new concourses to be built as and when demand for them materialises.

===Master Plan 2030===

One year after, on 2 June 2011, the Airport Authority announced and released their latest version of a 20-year blueprint for the airport&#x27;s development, the &quot;Hong Kong International Airport Master Plan 2030&quot;. The study took three years and according to the authority, nine consulting organisations have been hired for the research, observation, planning and advice. The main focus is to improve the overall capacity and aircraft handling ability of the airport. Based on this, two options have been developed.

====Option 1: Two-runway system====
To maintain the two-runway system, there would be enhancements to the terminal and apron facilities to increase the airport&#x27;s capacity. This option would enable the airport to handle a maximum of 420,000 flight movements per year, with annual passenger and cargo throughput increased to 74 million and six million tonnes respectively. The approximate cost of this plan was $23.4 billion Hong Kong dollars in 2010 prices. The Airport Authority estimated that the airport would reach its maximum runway capacity sometime around 2020 if no extra runway were to be added.

====Option 2: Three-runway system====
This plan focussed on adding a third runway to the north of the Chek Lap Kok, the island the airport is built on, by land reclamation, using deep cement mixing, of about . Associated facilities, additional terminals, airfield and apron facilities, would be built as well, and, combined with the new runway, it was estimated that the airport would be able to handle a maximum of 620,000 flights per year (102 per hour, or about one flight every 36 seconds), and meet forecast annual passenger and cargo throughput of about 97 million and 8.9 million tonnes by 2030 respectively.

There were possible drawbacks. Development costs were a concern: although the proposal would increase the number of direct jobs associated with HKIA to 150,000 by 2030 and generate an ENPV of HK$912 billion (in 2009 dollars), the estimated cost was approximately $86.2 billion (2010) Hong Kong Dollars. There were also environmental and local noise pollution concerns.

On 20 March 2012, the Hong Kong Government adopted this option as the official expansion plan.

The third runway, with its dedicated passenger concourse (T2 Concourse), was built parallel to the current two runways on reclaimed land directly north of the existing airport island. The third runway (referred to as the North runway) began operations in July 2022, while the original North runway (re-designated as the Centre runway) was closed for reconfiguration until 2024. Other facilities of the Three-runway system project include the T2 expansion, new T2 Concourse, automatic people mover, and baggage handling system.

==Statistics==

{{Airport-Statistics|iata=HKG}}

==Operations==
{{Update section|date=February 2023}}


The airport is operated by the Airport Authority Hong Kong, a statutory body wholly owned by the Government of Hong Kong Special Administrative Region.

The airport has three parallel runways, all of which are {{convert|3800|m|ft}} in length and {{convert|60|m|ft}} wide. The south runway has a Category II Precision Approach, while the centre runway has the higher Category IIIA rating, which allows pilots to land in only {{convert|200|m|ft|adj = on}} visibility. The two runways have a capacity of over 60 aircraft movements an hour. The airport is upgrading ATC and runways so that they can handle 68 movements per hour. Normally, the centre runway (07C/25C; until 1 December 2021 the north runway 07L/25R) is used for landing passenger planes. The south runway (07R/25L) is used for passenger planes taking off and cargo flights due to its proximity to the cargo terminal. A third runway (designated 07L/25R) to their north has opened in mid-2022, while the Centre runway has been closed for upgrades. When all three runways are opened, it is estimated that the airport will be able to handle a maximum of 620,000 flights per year (102 per hour, or about one flight every 36 seconds).

There are 49 frontal stands at the main passenger concourse, 28 remote stands and 25 cargo stands. There are also five parking bays at the Northwest Concourse. A satellite concourse with 10 frontal stands for narrow-body aircraft was commissioned to the north of the main concourse at the end of 2009, bringing the total number of frontal stands at the airport to 59.

The airport was the busiest for passenger traffic in Asia in 2010, and the world&#x27;s busiest airport for cargo traffic in 2010. In terms of international traffic, the airport is the third busiest for passenger traffic and the busiest for cargo since its operation in 1998. Over 95 international airlines are providing about 900 scheduled passenger and all-cargo flights each day between Hong Kong and some 160 destinations worldwide. About 76 percent of these flights are operated with wide-body jets. There is also an average of approximately 31 non-scheduled passenger and cargo flights each week.

The operation of scheduled air services to and from Hong Kong is facilitated by air services agreements between Hong Kong and other countries. Since the opening of HKIA, the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region has implemented a policy of progressive liberalisation of air services. Many low-cost airlines have started various regional routes to compete head-on with full-service carriers on trunk routes.

The airport&#x27;s long-term expansion opportunities are subject to variables. The airport opened its third runway in July 2022 as part of a HK$141.5 billion expansion project that would increase its land footprint by 50%. On the other hand, there exists only one airway between Hong Kong and mainland China, and this single route is often and easily backed up causing delays on both sides. In addition, China requires that aircraft flying the single air route between Hong Kong and the mainland must be at an altitude of at least 15,000 feet. Talks are underway to persuade the Chinese military to relax its airspace restriction because of worsening air traffic congestion at the airport. Other than that, Hong Kong Airport Authority is cooperating with other airports in the area to relieve air traffic and in the future, Shenzhen may act as a regional airport while Hong Kong receives all the international flights.

==Air traffic==
The Government Flying Service provides short and long-range search and rescue services, police support, medical evacuation and general-purpose flights for the Government.

===Passenger facilities===
Despite its size, the passenger terminal was designed for convenience. The layout and signage, moving walkways and the automated people mover help passengers move through the building. The HKIA Automated People Mover, a driverless people mover system with 3 stations transports passengers between the check-in area and the gates. The trains travel at {{convert|62|km/h|mph}}. The airport also contains an IMAX theatre that has the largest screen in Hong Kong. The theatre is located in Terminal 2, level 6 and can seat 350 persons at a time.

====Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre====
The Hong Kong Business Aviation Centre (HKBAC) is located within the airport and has its terminal and facilities separate from the public terminal. It provides services for executive aircraft and passengers, including a passenger lounge, private rooms and showers, business centre facilities, ground handling, baggage handling, fuelling, security, customs and flight planning. Designated spaces and hangars are also provided at the HKBAC for private aircraft. HKBAC has broken ground on a HK$400 million ($51 million) expansion. The project, which will double the airport&#x27;s handling capacity for business jet movements, is expected to be completed in 2025.

===Intermodal transportation hub===

To sustain the growth of passengers, the Airport Authority formulated a &quot;push and pull through&quot; strategy to expand its connections to new sources of passengers and cargo. This means adapting the network to the rapidly growing markets in China and in particular to the Pearl River Delta region (PRD). In 2003, a new Airport-Mainland Coach Station opened. The coach station has a {{convert|230|m2|sqft|adj = on}} waiting lounge and sheltered bays for ten coaches. Many buses operate each day to transport passengers between HKIA and major cities on the Mainland.

The Coach Station was relocated to the ground floor (level 3) of Terminal 2 in 2007. The 36 bays at the new Coach Station allow cross-border coaches to make 320 trips a day carrying passengers between the airport and 90 cities and towns in the PRD. Local tour and hotel coaches also operate from T2. The coach station at T2 has shops and waiting lounges as well as a mainland coach service centre which gathers all operators together.

In late September 2003, the SkyPier high-speed ferry terminal opened. Passengers arriving at the SkyPier board buses to the terminal and arriving air passengers board ferries at the pier for their ride back to the PRD. Passengers travelling in both directions can bypass customs and immigration formalities, which reduces transit time. Four ports – Shekou, Shenzhen, Macau and Humen (Dongguan) – were initially served. As of August 2007, SkyPier serves Shenzhen&#x27;s Shekou and Fuyong, Dongguan&#x27;s Humen, Macau, Zhongshan and Zhuhai. Passengers travelling from Shekou and Macau can complete airline check-in procedures with participating airlines before boarding the ferries and go straight to the boarding gate for the flight at HKIA.

In 2009, the permanent SkyPier Terminal opened. The permanent ferry terminal is equipped with four berths, but the terminal is designed to accommodate eight berths. Transfer desks and baggage handling facilities are included, and the terminal is directly connected to the airport automatic people mover system.

===Baggage and cargo facilities===

Ramp handling services are provided by Hong Kong Airport Services Limited (HAS), Jardine Air Terminal Services Limited and SATS HK Limited. Their services include the handling of mail and passenger baggage, transportation of cargo, aerobridge operations and the operation of passenger stairways. The airport has an advanced baggage handling system (BHS), the main section of which is located in the basement level of the passenger terminal, and a separate remote transfer facility at the western end of the main concourse for the handling of tight connection transfer bags.

HKIA handles over five million tonnes of cargo annually. Hong Kong Air Cargo Terminals Limited operates one of the two air cargo terminals at the airport. Its headquarters, the {{convert|328000|m2|sqft|adj = on}} SuperTerminal 1, is the world&#x27;s second-largest stand-alone air cargo handling facility, after the opening of the West Cargo Handling Area of the Shanghai Pudong International Airport on 26 March 2008. The designed capacity is 2.6 million tonnes of freight a year. The second air cargo terminal is operated by Asia Airfreight Terminal Company Limited, and has a capacity of 1.5 million tonnes a year. DHL operates the DHL Central Asia Hub cargo facility which handles 35,000 parcels and 40,000 packages per hour. Hongkong Post operates the Air Mail Centre (AMC) and processes 700,000 packages per day. It is envisaged that HKIA&#x27;s total air cargo capacity per annum will reach nine million tonnes ultimately.

===Aircraft maintenance services===

Both line and base maintenance services are undertaken by Hong Kong Aircraft Engineering Company (HAECO), while China Aircraft Services Limited (CASL) and Pan Asia Pacific Aviation Services Limited carry out line maintenance. Line maintenance services include routine servicing of aircraft performed during normal turnaround periods and regularly scheduled layover periods. Base maintenance covers all airframe maintenance services and for this HAECO has a three-bay hangar, which can accommodate up to three Boeing 747-400 aircraft and two Airbus A320 aircraft, and an adjoining support workshop. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} HAECO also has the world&#x27;s largest mobile hangar, weighing over 400 tons. {{Citation needed|date=May 2017}} It can be used to enclose half of a wide-body aeroplane so that the whole facility can fully enclose four 747s when the mobile hangar is used.

On 29 May 2009, CASL opened its first aircraft maintenance hangar in the maintenance area of the airport. The new hangar occupies an area of about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft}} and can accommodate one wide-body and one narrow-body aircraft at the same time; the hangar also has an about {{convert|10000|m2|sqft|adj = on}} area in its annexe building. CASL specialises in Airbus A320 family and Boeing 737 Next Generation series heavy maintenance.

===Airport based ground services===
{{More citations needed section|date=July 2020}}
The Air Traffic Control Complex (ATCX), located at the centre of the airfield, is the nerve centre of the entire air traffic control system. Some 370 air traffic controllers and supporting staff work around the clock to provide air traffic control services for the Hong Kong Flight Information Region (FIR). At the Air Traffic Control Tower, controllers provide 24-hour aerodrome control services to aircraft operating at the airport. A backup Air Traffic Control Centre/Tower constructed to the north of the ATCX is available for operational use in the event normal services provided in the ATCX are disrupted by unforeseen circumstances. Apart from serving as an operational backup, the facilities are also used for air traffic control training.

The Airport Meteorological Office (AMO) of the Hong Kong Observatory (HKO) provides weather services for the aviation community. The AMO issues alerts of low-level windshear and turbulence. Windshear detection is made using traditional doppler weather radars as well as the more effective doppler LIDAR, of which Hong Kong International Airport was the first to introduce. Doppler LIDAR systems use lasers to detect windshear and wind direction even when atmospheric conditions are too dry for Doppler radar to work.

===Fire and rescue services===
Rescue and fire fighting services within the airport are covered by the Airport Fire Contingent of the Hong Kong Fire Services Department. The contingent has 282 members, operating three fire stations and two rescue berths for 24-hour emergency calls. It is equipped with 14 fire appliances which can respond to incidents within two minutes in optimum conditions of visibility and surface conditions, satisfying the relevant recommendation of the International Civil Aviation Organization. Two high-capacity rescue boats, supported by eight-speed boats, form the core of sea rescue operations. One ambulance is assigned at each of the airport fire stations.

==Ground transport==
The airport is connected to inner Hong Kong by the Route 8 in Hong Kong North Lantau Highway on Lantau Island.

There is an automated people mover, operated by the Airport Authority and maintained by MTR Corporation, connecting the East Hall to the Midfield Concourse via West Hall and Terminal 2. It was extended to SkyPier in late 2009 and extended to Midfield Concourse in 2015.

===Bus===

{{Main|Bus services in Hong Kong}}

Citybus (CityFlyer for Airport services), New Lantau Bus, Long Win Bus and Discovery Bay Transit Services (Permits required) operate more than 40 bus routes to the airport from various parts of Hong Kong, available at the Airport Ground Transportation Centre and Cheong Tat Road. The bus companies also offer more than 20 overnight &quot;N&quot; and &quot;NA&quot; Bus lines (a.k.a. Night services).

Passengers can also take bus route number S1 to the Tung Chung MTR station. From there they can board the MTR Tung Chung line which follows the same route as the MTR Airport Express Line to Central Station with cheaper fare but longer journey time.

There is a bus service to Hong Kong–Zhuhai–Macau Bridge Control Point, with services between Chek Lap Kok, Hong Kong to Zhuhai and Macau. Coach services are also available to major cities and towns in Guangdong province. such as Dongguan, Guangzhou and Shenzhen. And Also for HZMBus to Macau

===Ferry===

Direct ferry services are available from the airport to various destinations throughout the Pearl River Delta (including Macau) via Skypier. Passengers using these services are treated as transit passengers and are not considered to have entered Hong Kong for immigration purposes. For this reason, access to the ferry terminal is before immigration at the airport for arriving passengers. Check-in services are available at these piers. Four ports – Shekou, Shenzhen Airport (Fuyong) and Humen (Dongguan) in mainland China, and Outer Harbour Ferry Terminal in Macau– were initially served, extending to Guangzhou and Zhongshan at the end of 2003. The Zhuhai service began on 10 July 2007 while a Nansha service started on 14 July 2009.

===Rail===

{{Main|Rail transport in Hong Kong}}

The fastest service from the city to the airport is the Airport Express, which is a part of the Hong Kong rail network, and a dedicated airport rail link as part of the MTR rapid transit network. The line serves between Asia-World-Expo and Hong Kong (Central) Station makes intermediate stops at the following stations:

# The Airport Express line originally terminated at Airport station, where trains open doors on both sides, allowing direct access to either Terminal 1 or Terminal 2. It was later extended to AsiaWorld–Expo station on 20 December 2005 to facilitate the opening of the nearby AsiaWorld–Expo venue. During events at the venue, some Tung Chung line trains, which largely share the same tracks as the Airport Express, serve this station instead of Tung Chung, but these trains do not stop by the Airport station.
# Tsing Yi Station (located in the northeastern part of Tsing Yi Island, Kwai Tsing District, Tsing Yi.)
# Kowloon Station (located in the Yau Tsim Mong District on the western part of the Kowloon Peninsula, this station is the major transfer hub in the Kowloon Peninsula. Connections are also available for taxis, MTR Shuttle Buses and public/private buses at Elements. Before the COVID-19 pandemic and currently suspended under further notice as of April 2023, in-town check-in services for major airlines were provided.)
# Hong Kong Station, the terminus, is located at the northern coast of Central and Western District on Hong Kong Island. It takes approximately 24 minutes to reach the airport from Hong Kong Station. Hong Kong Station also provides in-town check-in services for major airlines.

==Accidents and incidents==
The following are aviation accidents or incidents at the current HKIA (see accidents and incidents at the former HKIA at Kai Tak):

*On 22 August 1999, China Airlines Flight 642 (an MD-11 operated by subsidiary Mandarin Airlines), which was landing at Hong Kong International Airport during Typhoon Sam after a flight from Bangkok International Airport (now Bangkok Don Mueang International Airport), rolled over and caught fire, coming to rest upside down beside the runway. Of the 315 passengers and crew on board, 3 people were killed and 219 were injured.
* On 13 April 2010, Cathay Pacific Flight 780, an Airbus A330-342 from Surabaya Juanda International Airport to Hong Kong landed safely after both engines failed due to contaminated fuel. All 322 survived, and 63 of them were injured. Its two pilots received the Polaris Award from the International Federation of Air Line Pilots&#x27; Associations for their heroism and airmanship.
* On 8 September 2016, an airport delivery van crashed into the left engine of KA691 from Hong Kong to Penang with 295 passengers and crew on board as the aircraft was taxiing to the runway. There were no fatalities.
*On 21 July 2021, UPS Airlines Flight 5X003, a Boeing 747-8F, suffered from an engine fire in the #1 engine shortly after take-off. The flight subsequently made a successful emergency landing on Runway 07L and was met by airport fire crews from the Hong Kong Fire Services Department Main Airport Station which extinguished the flames. The Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and the NTSB are currently investigating the incident.
*On 20 December 2022, United Airlines Flight 2831 suffered a bird strike on takeoff which triggered a fire. The plane was ordered back and landed on Runway 07L and was met by airport fire crews who extinguished the flames. The Hong Kong Civil Aviation Department and the NTSB are currently investigating the incident.
*On 17 June 2024, Atlas Air Flight 4304 suffered a tire burst while performing an emergency landing. The tire fragments caused a 4-hour delay that delayed 186 of the 315 flights scheduled during this period. The Airport Authority reported that none of the five crew members on board the cargo plane suffered injuries. The break down of the hydraulic system caused clean-up to take longer than expected.

<text>Amherstburg is a town near the mouth of the Detroit River in Essex County, Ontario, Canada. In 1796, Fort Malden was established here, stimulating growth in the settlement. The fort has been designated as a National Historic Site.

The town is approximately south of the U.S. city of Detroit, Michigan, facing Wyandotte, Grosse Ile Township, Brownstown Charter Township, Trenton, and Gibraltar, Michigan. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area.

==Communities==
Besides the town proper of Amherstburg, the town of Amherstburg comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including the following communities:

* Former Anderdon Township: - Edgewater Beach, McGregor (partially), River Canard (partially); &quot;Golfview&quot;, &quot;Kingsbridge&quot;, &quot;Pointe West&quot;; &quot;Auld&quot;, &quot;Delisle&#x27;s Corners&quot; (partially), &quot;Loiselleville&quot;, &quot;Paquette Corners&quot; (partially), &quot;Rivière-Aux-Canards&quot;, &quot;Southwick&quot;, &quot;Splitlog&quot;
* Former Malden Township: - Amherstburg, Amherst Point, Bar Point, Busy Bee Corners, Erieview Beach, Glen Eden, Lake Erie Country Club, Lakewood Beach, Malden Centre, McGregor (partially), Sunset Beach, Willow Beach, Willowood; &quot;Gordon&quot;, &quot;North Malden&quot;, &quot;Quarries&quot;; &quot;Good Child Beach&quot;, &quot;Sinasac Corners&quot;, &quot;The Meadows&quot;, &quot;Boblo Island&quot;

==History==
French colonists had settled along what became the Canadian side of the Detroit River during the colonial era, establishing small farms. The Petite Côte settlement was founded along the river to the north.

In 1796, after losing the Thirteen Colonies following the American Revolutionary War, the British established Fort Malden as a military fort overlooking the river&#x27;s mouth at Lake Erie. It was occupied as a garrison. This stimulated development in the area, as did the Crown granting land in Upper Canada to Loyalists (now known as United Empire Loyalists) in compensation for losses in the Thirteen Colonies, or as payment for service in the military during the war.



The Crown also wanted to increase population and development in Upper Canada. The new settlers built many of their houses in the French style of a century before, giving the new town a historic character. French-speaking colonists also settled here, some of whom were descendants of soldiers and traders associated with Fort Detroit, or other early colonists. They were known as Fort Detroit French, in contrast to later migrants of the 19th century from Quebec, who became known as Canadian French. St. Jean was their Catholic church.

During the days of the Underground Railroad before the American Civil War, refugee African-American slaves often crossed the Detroit river to escape to freedom in Canada, after the Crown abolished slavery. Although Michigan was a free state, slavecatchers went to Detroit trying to capture slaves and take them to owners for bounty. Detroit abolitionists William Lambert and especially George DeBaptiste were key to helping the slaves escape. DeBaptiste owned a lake steamboat that he used to offload refugees in town while docked ostensibly to load lumber. They used Fort Malden as one of several entry points to Canada. The town is mentioned in &quot;Uncle Tom’s Cabin&quot; as the entry point of George and Eliza, after escaping from slavery in the United States.

By 1869, the town of Amherstburg in the Township of Malden, County of Essex had a population of 2,500. When the fort was no longer needed for military purposes, the government adapted it for use as a provincial &quot;lunatic asylum&quot;. Its main building was later used as a Port of Entry, Money Order office, Post Office &amp; savings bank.

Amherstburg was incorporated as a town in 1878. The town is named after Jeffery Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst, commander of the British forces and first British Governor General of the Province of Quebec (1760).

In 1998, The Town of Amherstburg absorbed the neighbouring Township of Anderdon (to its northeast) and Township of Malden (to its southeast) to form a larger Town of Amherstburg.

At 20:01 Eastern Daylight Time on April 19, 2018, a magnitude 3.6 earthquake (with a depth of ) occurred in Amherstburg, between the main portion of town and McGregor. No damage was reported, but the 30-second shaking was felt in Windsor, Downtown Detroit, and the Downriver communities across the river, such as Grosse Ile, Michigan. Some minor shaking was felt as far away as Toledo, Ohio along Lake Erie and Ann Arbor in the interior of Michigan.
The Amherstburg Police Service was dissolved at the end of 2018, with its officers and responsibilities transferred to a detachment of the Windsor Police Service.

==Education==

The local public high school in Amherstburg is North Star High School. Up until 2022 the high school was General Amherst High School, named after Jeffrey Amherst, 1st Baron Amherst. Although North Star High School is located in the town, some youth residents choose to attend St. Thomas of Villanova Catholic Secondary School, located near the neighbourhood of River Canard. French-speaking students in Amherstburg may also attend École Secondaire E.J. Lajeunesse, located in Windsor, Ontario.

==Tourist attractions==
Amherstburg is home to several tourist attractions, including Fort Malden and the Amherstburg Freedom Museum (formerly the North American Black Historical Museum). This explores the history of African-American refugees in western Ontario, who sought freedom from slavery and made their homes here.

Built c. 1816-19, it was the home of Catherine Reynolds, a landscape painter, and her brother Robert Reynolds. Additional tourist attractions include the Park House Museum and King&#x27;s Navy Yard Park, both of which are located in the heart of old Amherstburg.

A restored Essex Terminal railway caboose is operated as a railway museum.
Gordon House was built in 1798 as a residence overlooking the Detroit River. Since being restored, it houses a Marine exhibit.

Marathon Oil has a coke storage site near the river.

===Chemical plant history===
The production at the Honeywell plant of hydrofluoric acid (HF) was suspended in October 2013 in favour of a plant in Geismar, Louisiana. The Honeywell plant is used in the production of fuels, refrigerants, and other materials. HF is a precursor to numerous pharmaceuticals, as well as being used to produce Teflon, fluoropolymers and fluorocarbons. Because of its highly corrosive nature, HF is also used to dissolve glass, in glass etching and frosting, and is used in quartz purification, chemical milling, steel pickling and cleaning silicon wafers. It is produced by treating the mineral fluorite with sulfuric acid, which produces hydrogen fluoride and calcium sulfate. The plant, which is located at 395 Front Rd, North, had previously suspended its operations between 1992 and 1996. There is hope locally that production will resume at some future time.

The plant&#x27;s gypsum pond was identified in 2008 as the source of high levels of arsenic pollution in the area, which have been a provincial Ministry of the Environment concern since 2006.

Honeywell now owns the adjacent Brunner Mond chemical plant and soda ash settling basins site, whose former owners, General Chemical Industrial Products, declared bankruptcy in 2005. This site was used since 1920 to manufacture calcium chloride and other chemicals, which were shipped from a deep water port on the Detroit River. The site has been since April 2012 the subject of remediation work, supervised by CH2M Hill.

The plant was once part of Allied Chemical, which retained it when it sold the soda ash and calcium chloride operations and Amherst Quarries to General Chemical. The plant is composed of three separate parcels connected through rights of way and easements. In 1999, Allied Signal merged with the much smaller Honeywell Inc. but chose to carry on the newly expanded corporation under the Honeywell name.

==Transportation==

<text>Russia Day () called Day of adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of [[RSFSR]] () before 2002, is the national holiday of the Russian Federation. It has been celebrated annually on 12 June since 1992. The day commemorates the adoption of the Declaration of State Sovereignty of the Russian Soviet Federative Socialist Republic (RSFSR) on 12 June 1990. The passage of this Declaration by the First Congress of People&#x27;s Deputies marked the beginning of constitutional reform in the Russian Soviet state.

==History==

With the creation of the post of the President of the Russian Federation and the adoption of the new Russian Constitution to reflect the new political reality, the national flag, anthem, and emblem of the Russian Federation were major landmarks in the consolidation of Russian statehood. The country&#x27;s new name, the Russian Federation, was adopted on December 25, 1991. In 1992, the Supreme Soviet of Russia proclaimed June 12 as a national holiday. By presidential decree on June 2, 1994, the date was again proclaimed Russia&#x27;s national holiday. Under a subsequent presidential decree on June 16, 1998, the holiday was officially named &quot;Russia Day&quot;. In 2002, the new Labour Code gave its official seal to this title.

In 2019, the self-proclaimed Donetsk People&#x27;s Republic proclaimed Russia Day a &quot;state holiday&quot;.

==Customs==
People may attend concerts and fireworks that take place in many cities throughout the country. Prominent Russian writers, scientists and humanitarian workers receive State Awards from the President of Russia on this day. Most public offices and schools are closed on June 12. If the day falls on a weekend, the public holiday shifts to the following Monday.

However, many Russians see Russia Day only as a day off. As it commemorates the Soviet Union&#x27;s dissolution, it brings back bitter memories for some. This is because the dissolution coincided with severe unemployment, high crime and poverty within Russia and other former Soviet republics.

In 2002, about 5000 representatives from across the country took part in the pageantry from Tverskaya Zastava to Manezh Square. The highlight of the Day of Russia-2003 was the air show, which included aerobatic teams &quot;Russian Knights&quot; and &quot;Swifts&quot;. Sukhoi and MiG planes left a trail forming the Russian flag. On June 12, 2004 at Red Square a historical military parade was held. Its members, soldiers of the Russian army and representatives of 89 regions, dressed in national costumes, presented the audience the most significant milestones of Russian history. In 2007 celebrations occurred in a hundreds of cities. For example, in Krasnoyarsk action thousands of people in white, blue and red robes formed more than a kilometer long tricolor.

Russia Day in 2008 was celebrated for three days from 11 to 14 June. In Tomsk a &quot;Wooden Carnival&quot; displayed a huge wooden Russian ruble, one hundred times the size of the coin. In Samara enthusiasts reconstructed forces of Minin and Pozharsky in 1612 with Polish–Muscovite War. In Moscow, the holiday included a three-hour concert and concluded a six-month contest over the &quot;Seven Wonders of Russia&quot;. In Red Square 20 lines of stage pyrotechnics, confetti cannon in the colors of the Russian flag and 100 guns.

In 2009 residents of Volgograd formed a map of the country covering 127 square meters. In Sevastopol, youths passed through the city center carrying a 30-meter flag of Russia. In Moscow, at Revolution Square that day a two-meter Khokhloma doll was painted. For the first time at the Ostankino Tower the state flag was displayed.

==Name==
According to some surveys, many Russians think that this holiday is Russia&#x27;s Independence Day, but the holiday has never had such a name in official documents. According to the survey of Levada Center in May 2003, 65 percent of the respondents named the holiday as the Independence Day of Russia.

<text>Tecumseh () is a town in Essex County in Southwestern Ontario, Canada. It is on Lake St. Clair east of Windsor and had a population of roughly 23,300 as of the 2021 census according to Statistics Canada. It is part of the Windsor census metropolitan area, and is a part of the Windsor-Essex County region along with the towns of Amherstburg, Essex, Kingsville, LaSalle, and the municipalities of Lakeshore and Leamington. Tecumseh was originally a Franco-Ontarian settlement.

Food processing is a major industry in Tecumseh, as Bonduelle owns a food processing plant near the town. The plant was built by Green Giant in 1931. Green Giant sold the plant in the late 1990s to Family Tradition Foods, who sold it to Carrière Foods in 2006. Carrière Foods was purchased in 2007 by Bonduelle.

The Tecumseh Corn Festival has been recognized as one of the Top 50 Festivals in Ontario by Festivals and Events Ontario.

Tecumseh is surrounded by Lake Erie, Lake St. Clair and the Detroit River. Detroit is easily accessible to Tecumseh residents by the Ambassador Bridge or the Detroit–Windsor Tunnel, both of which are located within the neighbouring municipality of Windsor.

The town is named after Tecumseh, an 18th-century Shawnee chief and warrior who promoted resistance to the expansion of the United States onto Native American lands.

==History==

The building of St. Anne’s (Catholic) Parish Church on the corner of Lesperance and Tecumseh Road in 1858 was the start of the Village of Tecumseh. Settled by a few French families who crossed over from the Detroit River. Land Grants to Charles Lesperance in 1796 from the British Administrators of the District of Hess is Tecumseh’s start. Later the building of the Great Western Railway brought job seekers and more settlement. The town became an important railway depot and stopover for travellers. County residents took horse and buggy into Tecumseh and then transferred onto the train, journeying by rail the rest of the way into Windsor. Several hotels were established in Tecumseh to accommodate travellers. The Bedell Hotel, the Soulliere Inn, the Hebert and the Hotel Perreault were some of the places most frequented by travellers and locals alike.

The French were the original settlers of Tecumseh, the majority of them descendants of the Frenchmen who had lived in the area before the arrival of British administrators after the Paris Peace Agreement in 1763. Those that had been living on their River farms kept them. Today the street names from Ouellette Avenue in Windsor to Lesperance Road in Tecumseh are a reminder of the men that cleared the land and farmed it.

As the town of Windsor grew, the overflow of immigrants settled in Tecumseh and other peripheral regions. Indicative of the change was the mix-up created by the introduction of the tomato to the area of Tecumseh. The first post office was opened in 1870, located on the northeast corner of Tecumseh and Lesperance Roads. Called Ryegate Station, its first Postmaster was a Mr. (Joseph) Christie. It was renamed &quot;Tecumseh&quot; in November 1875. Some of the first businesses in Tecumseh included a lumber mill operated by J.B. Cada; a grocery store operated by Arthur Cecile; a cheese factory on Banwell Road operated by Joseph Breault; a bakery owned by John Dugell; three butcher shops; a canning factory and a brewery eventually closed under Carling Brewery. In 1921 it was felt that Tecumseh was not getting its fair share of improvements in proportion to the taxes paid to the municipality of Sandwich East. A group of people headed by Malcolm Clapp petitioned the legislature to separate from the township and incorporate as the Town of Tecumseh with a population of 978. Dr. Paul Poisson was appointed as the first mayor of the town. The real growth in Tecumseh occurred in 1931 with the establishment of the Green Giant Factory as Fine Foods of Canada. Green Giant (now Bonduelle) is still located in Tecumseh and continues to employ full and part-time workers.

As the population grew, so did the demands for services. In 1922 a fire chief was appointed although no fire department was in existence, the fires were fought by town volunteers. The Ontario Provincial Police started policing the town in 1948 with 2 officers.

In 1999, as part of a reorganization of Essex County, Tecumseh was merged with the Village of St. Clair Beach, and the Township of Sandwich South into the Town of Tecumseh. In 2003, the City of Windsor annexed approximately (located south and east of the Windsor International Airport) from the Town of Tecumseh. Now considered to be a bedroom community of Windsor, Tecumseh is often cited as an example of urban sprawl; new subdivisions have developed on some of Canada&#x27;s most valuable agricultural land beginning in the late 1980s.

==Communities==
Besides the town proper of Tecumseh itself, the town of Tecumseh comprises a number of villages and hamlets, including Fairplay, Maidstone, Oldcastle, Paquette, Paquette Corners (partially) and St. Clair Beach (formerly from Maidstone Township).

<doc id="248462" wikidata="Q920883" url="?curid=248462" title="Music of Colombia">
<text>The music of Colombia is an expression of Colombian culture, music genres, both traditional and modern, according with the features of each geographic region, although it is not uncommon to find different musical styles in the same region. The diversity in musical expressions found in Colombia can be seen as the result of a mixture of Amerindian, African, and European (especially Spanish) influences, as well as more modern American.

Colombia has a vibrant collage of talent that touches a full spectrum of rhythms ranging from Pop music and Classical music to Salsa and Rock music. Colombian music is promoted mainly by the support of the largest record labels, independent companies and the Government of Colombia, through the Ministry of Culture.

==Caribbean region==

Colombia is known as &quot;the land of a thousand rhythms&quot; but actually holds over 1,025 folk rhythms. Some of the best known genres are cumbia and vallenato. The most recognized interpreters of traditional Caribbean and Afro-Colombian music are Totó la Momposina and Francisco Zumaqué. 

=== Western Caribbean Region ===
==== Cumbia ====
Cumbia began as a courtship dance practiced among the African population on the Caribbean coasts of Colombia. It is a mixture of Spanish, Native Colombian and African music. The style of dance is designed to recall the shackles worn around the ankles of the slaves. In the 19th century, slavery was abolished and Africans, Indians and other ethnic groups got a more complete integration in the Colombian culture.

Cumbia is a complex, rhythmic music which arose on Colombia&#x27;s Atlantic coast. In its original form, cumbia bands included only percussion and vocals; modern groups include saxophones, trumpets, keyboards and trombones as well. It evolved out of native influences, combining both traditions. Some observers have claimed that the dance originally associated with iron chains around the ankle. Others still believe that it is a direct import from Guinea, which has a popular dance form called cumbe.
Cumbia&#x27;s form was solidified in the 1940s when it spread from the rural countryside to urban and middle-class audiences. Mambo, big band and porro brass band influences were combined by artists like Lucho Bermúdez to form a refined form of cumbia that soon entered the Golden Age of Cumbia during the 1950s. Discos Fuentes, the largest and most influential record label in the country, was founded during this time. Fruko, known as the &quot;Godfather of Salsa&quot;, introduced Cuban salsa to Colombia and helped bring Discos Fuentes to national prominence by finding artists like La Sonora Dinamita, who brought cumbia to Mexico, where it remains popular.

It is worth pointing out that the &quot;classic&quot; cumbia known throughout Colombia is the Cumbia Cienaguera. This song reflects a uniquely Colombian feel known as &quot;sabor&quot; (flavour) and &quot;ambiente&quot; (atmosphere). Arguably, this song has remained a Colombian staple through the years and is widely known as Colombia&#x27;s unofficial national anthem. Some artists are Los Gaiteros de San Jacinto, Los Graduados, Los Black Stars, Los Golden Boys, Los Teen Agers, and Los Corraleros de Majagual. In the United States, an Afro- Colombian band based in New York called Grupo Rebolu, performs a variety of Afro-Colombian rhythms with authentic instruments such as Tambora and Tambor Alegre. Their repertoire includes Cumbia and many more genres from the Northern coast of Colombia as part of their original compositions.

====Champeta and African-diasporic music====
Some Colombian communities, such as Chocó, Cartagena, San Andres and Providence Island, have large African-descendant communities. Unlike most of the country, cultural mixing with native and European influences have been rare, and, especially in El Chocó, music has changed little since being imported from West Africa. Providencia Island is also home to a type of folk music which is closely related to mento, a Jamaican folk form. Most influentially, however, is the city of Cartagena and its champeta music which has been influenced by soukous, compas, zouk, and reggae. Champeta musicians have included Luis Towers, El Afinaíto, El Sayayín, El Pupy, and Boogaloo, while others like Elio Boom have incorporated Jamaican raggamuffin music to champeta.

====Porro====

Porro bands are a form of big band music that came from Sucre, Córdoba and Sabana de Bolívar. The brass ensembles are modeled after European military bands. Notable porros include Pacho Galan.

===Eastern Caribbean musical region===
====Vallenato====

Vallenato was first played by the pre-Columbian Indians using traditional instruments. The first vallenato singer was Guillermo Buitrago, born in the Magdalena department. Vallenato did not always use accordion as its main instrument. In fact, from 1920 to 1936 the main instrument was the guitar. Groups such as bovea and sus vallenatos also are among the first vallenato singers. They form the group in the city of Barranquilla Atlantico department. They also were the first to take the vallenato music to a different country like Argentina, specifically in northern Argentina.
Contrary to popular belief, vallenato is not a rhythm. Rather, it is a genre. It is made up of four rhythms: Son, Puya, Merengue, and Paseo. Vallenato arose in Valledupar on Colombia&#x27;s Atlantic Coast and only gained popularity elsewhere in the country in the 1980s. Its origins are shrouded in mystery but are said to have begun with Francisco el Hombre, who allegedly defeated Satan in a musical contest. Based around the accordion, the guacharaca, and the caja vallenata (a larger version of the bongo), vallenato has long been connected with cumbia. Influential artists include Alejo Duran and more recently, Alfredo Gutiérrez and Lisandro Meza. In addition to the accordion, the bass guitar has been a common part of vallenato ensembles since it was introduced by Caliya in the mid-1960s. The most recent modernization of vallenato occurred in 1993 when Carlos Vives released &quot;Clásicos de la Provincia&quot;, which made him into a star and changed the face of vallenato.

An important phenomenon has occurred in Colombia with vallenato. At first it was an exclusive kind of music for Atlantic Coast people but because the proliferation of radio programs of this genre in other cities of the republic (such as Bogota), and the migration of people from the coast to the capital, vallenato spread to the rest of Colombia. Not only the music, but the musicians of the genre increased in the capital and other cities. In 2006 for the first time, a musician from Bogota, Alberto &quot;Beto&quot; Jamaica, was the king of vallenato in the traditional competition to play accordion, &quot;El Festival Vallenato&quot;. Other important musicians from other cities have taken importance in the vallenato world.

Vallenato has spawned several subgenres, including vallenato-protesta, which is known for socially aware lyrics, and charanga vallenata, which was invented by Cubans in the United States like progenitor Roberto Torres.

==Pacific Region of Colombia==

===Currulao===
This is one of the most African influenced-styles in all of Colombia, and has its roots among the Afro-Colombian people of the Pacific coast.

In its most basic form, the currulao is played by a group of four musicians.

One musician plays a 6-8 rhythm on a drum known as a &quot;cununo&quot;, which superficially resembles the &quot;alegre&quot; drum (used in Cumbia) to the untrained eye, but is narrower and taller. The Currulao rhythm is created by both striking the skin of the drum with the one&#x27;s hand and tapping the side of the drum with a small stick.

The second musician keeps time on a shaker known in parts of Colombia as a &quot;guasá&quot;(goo-ah-SAH) or &quot;guache&quot;(goo-AH-cheh), which is typically a hollow cylinder made of metal, wooden, or guadua bamboo, filled with light seeds, rice is sometimes used in home-made guasás.

But the main instrument of the currulao style is perhaps the Colombian marimba, a wooden xylophone which resembles the African balafon also for the style of playing.

Many groups in Colombia perform this traditional style of music. Currently, the most renowned groups include Grupo Socavón, Grupo Gualajó, and Grups Bahia Trio. A well renowned figure among the old marimbero masters in Colombia is Baudilio Cuama Rentería from Buenaventura Colombia.

In the United States two Colombian Bands performing this genre with authentic traditional instruments are La Cumbiamba NY, on the east coast (New York), and Aluna Band in the west coast (San Francisco). In 2010, Currulao has been added to the UNESCO list of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.

===Bambuco===

Bambuco is a type of music with Basque and Native American influence, sometimes known as Música del interior. It is not clear the origins of this style, many specialists agree that it has some components of Spanish folk music, while others believe it has a typical rhythm which was inherited from the Quechua or Chibchas. According to Rafael Pombo, the Bambuco orinated among the mestizo masses. Briefly, it is the result of the ethhinic mixture from the colony time, being influencing by different cultural elements. Its popularity has long been, but was extremely popular across Colombia from the mid-1920s to the late 1930s. Artists include Estudiantina, Los Carranguerros de Raquira, Jaime Llano González, Jorge Villamil, and the Morales Pino Trío.

==Contemporary music==
===Colombian salsa===

Salsa music was born among Puerto Ricans and Cubans in New York, but soon spread to Colombia. Native salsa groups like Fruko y sus Tesos and labels that recorded them like Discos Fuentes emerged. Artists like Joe Arroyo followed, inventing a distinctively Colombian form of salsa. Other influential Colombian salsa artists include Cristian Del Real &quot;The Timbal Genius&quot;, Grupo Niche, Alquimia, La Misma Gente, Los Titanes, Los Nemus del Pacífico, Orquesta Guayacán, Grupo Galé and La Sonora Carruseles. Some of the most prolific composers in the genre are Jairo Varela and Nino Caicedo whose compositions have been recorded by Grupo Niche and Orquesta Guayacán respectively. Several Cuban and Puerto Rican musicians who have established in Colombia, such as Diego Valdés and Israel Tanenbaum, have collaborated with Colombians in salsa projects. Recently Colombian dancers have become World Champions year after year and the style is becoming more popular and admired among Salsa professionals worldwide; with two of the most prominent salsa schools being Swing Latino driven by the dance choreographer Eduardo &#x27;El Mulato&#x27; Hernandez, and Constelación Latina driven by one of the world&#x27;s most beloved dancers Jhoanna &#x27;KKO&#x27; Agudelo. As a dance, Colombian Salsa is unique and different from New York/Puerto Rico and Cuban salsa. Colombian Salsa concentrates on footwork and does not incorporate cross-body leads. Dancers leave the upper part of the body still and relaxed while the feet do extremely fast and complex movements.

===Colombian rock music===

In the late 1950s, Mexican rock artists like Enrique Guzmán and César Costa became very popular in Colombia. Soon, native rock bands like Los Speakers and The Flippers gained a wide following. Starting in 1967 (see 1967 in music), native bands like Génesis (unrelated to the more famous band Genesis of a similar name) fused native musical forms (like cumbia) with rock. Marco, the voice of the Rock and Roll, was a pioneer and promoter of the &quot;Rockabilly Colombian&quot; performed with his unmistakable personal stamp in their own language. Virtuality is in their first recordings routed to the sensitive listener to enjoy the simplicity of rock bass, guitar and drums, combined into a whole to produce a very particular and in an atmosphere of a home recording studio, filled with reel tapes and three microphones mixed in mono line. (Marco Tulio Sanchez B) contributed to the Colombian rock and roll look to the past to remember our roots, dabbling in country and rockabilly music evokes Elvis Presley, is called today the &quot;Elvis colombiano&quot;, awarded abroad for their ability on stage as a whole &quot;Showman&quot; and the unmistakable voice of Cronn rocker.
Rock in Colombia gained great popularity during the 1980s with the arrival of bands such as Soda Stereo (Argentina), Los Prisioneros (Chile), and Hombres G (Spain). During the 90&#x27;s, many punk and heavy metal bands appeared in Bogotá, Medellín, and Cali. Colombia has possibly the biggest underground, hardcore, metal and punk movement of the continent, and is known in Latin America as the &quot;punk corner&quot;. Kraken and Masacre are some of the most important Colombian rock bands.

The music event Rock al Parque celebrated yearly in Bogotá is the largest free rock festival in Latin America; around 100 bands playing their music along 3 days and 400,000 people in attendance. Currently, Doctor Krápula, a rock band with strong ska influences that is known for making covers of traditional Latin American songs, enjoys great popularity. A popular Colombian Rock band outside of Colombia is The Monas. Aterciopelados named &quot;Colombia&#x27;s Hottest Band&quot; in a &quot;Time&quot; magazine article, is one of the most recognized Rock bands of Colombia. &quot;The band, made up of front woman Andrea Echeverri and bassist/producer Hector Buitrago, mixes punk, surf guitar and ska with folky Colombian styles such as vallenato, a bouncy, accordion-heavy genre&quot;.

Other popular and interesting bands are Ekhymosis, a group led by Juanes, who began making music in 1988 and are known for doing rock with a Colombian influence, The Hall Effect who make English pop/rock linked with Britpop influences. SOUNDACITY performs a mix of Brit rock, pop and Andean sounds, rhythms and instrumentation, sing both in English and Spanish and have toured the United States east coast. Proper Strangers is an avant-garde rock band. Two Way Analog is an eclectic band whose influence are roadmovies and its soundtracks, Divagash is an electronic soft-rock band, La Pestilencia is a post-hardcore band, Bajo Tierra, Palenke Soultribe (traditional Colombin roots music fused with electronic beats). But, possibly, the most successful &quot;indie&quot; band is Sidestepper, with its fusion of Colombian traditional music, electronic and African rhythms, who already appeared in Coachella Festival in 2006. Some musical groups in the death metal genre are the world-famous Internal Suffering, Carnivore Diprosopus, Goretrade, Mindly Rotten, Suppuration, and Amputated Genitals. Colombia is also the birthplace of the well known black metal band Inquisition, now based in Seattle, Washington. Miguel Fernando Trapezaris, the bassist of Cyprus-based Epic power metal band Winter&#x27;s Verge, is of Colombian descent.

===Colombian pop music===


This musical genre has been growing recently with artists like Los de Adentro, San Alejo, Sebastian Yepes, Lucas Arnau or Mauricio &amp; Palodeagua. Pop with strong traces of traditional Colombian music, named Tropipop, is also rising currently. Fonseca and Maía represent this trend.

=== Some of Colombia&#x27;s most recognized pop artists ===

Shakira is the highest selling and most recognized Colombian artist. After the success of her album &quot;Pies Descalzos&quot; in 1995, Shakira began working with producer Emilio Estefan Jr. and recorded &quot;Dónde Están los Ladrones?&quot;, which sold millions worldwide. Showing all her talent, after her &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; presentation, Shakira went on to make an English album &quot;Laundry Service&quot; which debuted at #3 in the Billboard Charts of the USA.

One of her most successful songs is &quot;Hips Don&#x27;t Lie&quot;, which sold over 10 million copies and downloads worldwide, topped in over 70 countries #1.

She is winner of 2 American and 7 Latin Grammies. In 2008, Shakira was nominated for a Golden Globe.

Singer-songwriter Juanes is also one of the most important singers from Colombia. He stood out at the Latin Grammys in 2003 with his album &quot;Un Día Normal&quot;, which has become very popular in the US and Europe.

===Colombian urban and hip-hop music===

Hip Hop came to Colombia in the late 1980s when a few US Hip-Hop tracks by NWA and MC Hammer spurred a break-dancing fever among the young of the less privileged areas of major cities such as Medellín, Cali and Bogotá. Towards the end of this decade groups began to form, eventually leading to complete album productions in the mid-1990s. La Etnnia and Gotas de Rap were two of the various hip-hop groups that emerged and are widely considered as the pioneers of Colombian Rap. Promoting a very independent style, both groups expressed extreme political and social views, protesting violence, corruption, inequality and hardships in the marginalized regions of Colombia. Then Asilo 38 from Cali come onto the scene with the albums, &quot;La Hoguera&quot; (2000) and &quot;La Descarga&quot; (2002), presenting a more commercial and polished sound, while still retaining strong socio-political messages. It is about this time that 
Reggaeton from Puerto Rico surges in popularity and Hip-Hop in Colombia takes a back seat for a while as artists try their hand at the new controversial sound. Artist(s) such as Tres Pesos, J Balvin, Maluma, Reykon y Yelsid have established themselves in this genre and hits such as &#x27;Baila (Negra de trasero grande)&#x27; by Leka el Poeta and the explixcitly worded &#x27;La Quemona&#x27; and &#x27;Micaela&#x27; by Master Boy take the country by storm. Even the first ever Colombian &#x27;X Factor&#x27; in 2006 produces a Reggaeton singer called Farina Pao Paucar Franco who places third in the competition.
Karol G is a Colombian reggaetón singer who has done collaborations with other reggaetón singers, such as J Balvin, Bad Bunny, and Maluma. Throughout her career, Karol G has had troubles in the industry because reggaetón is a genre that is dominated by male artists. She recounts how when starting her career she noticed that there weren&#x27;t many opportunities for her in the genre because reggaeton was dominated by male artists. In 2018, Karol G&#x27;s single Mi Cama became very popular and she made a remix with J Balvin and Nicky Jam. The Mi cama remix appeared in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs and number 1 in Latin Airplay charts. This year she has collaborated with Maluma called Creeme and with Anuel AA in Culpables. The single, Culpables has been in the top 10 Hot Latin Songs for 2 consecutive weeks.

Reggae has always been popular in the Colombian Caribbean islands of San Andres and Providence and Spanish Reggae from Panama has helped to strengthen the movement of Reggae artists in the Colombian interior. Artists such as Voodoo Soul Jah, Nawal and Alerta Kamarada (Colombian representatives in the Jamaican Reggae festival) are currently spearheading this ever more popular genre in Colombia. 2006 brings a renaissance in Colombian Hip-Hop in the form of Afro-Colombian group ChocQuibTown, fusing traditional rhythms and instruments from their native lands in the Colombian Pacific into their sound. Already hailed as the new phenemomenon in Colombian Hip-Hop, their popularity is ever increasing and making way for other Urban artists to emerge. One such artist is Jiggy Drama, from the island of San Andres, who has become one of the most loved and controversial rap artist in Colombia, his lyrics are spicy and intelligent. Jiggy Drama collaborated with Colombian Party Cartel on the urban merengue track &quot;Chico Malo&quot;. *On the international stage Aztek Escobar based in Houston, Colombian Party Cartel based in Nashville, Tres Coronas based in New York, Adassa based in Miami and 3 of the seven-man group of Culcha Candela in Berlin, Germany are representing Colombian urban music worldwide.

<text>Milton (2021 census population 132,979) is a town in Southern Ontario, Canada, and part of the Halton Region in the Greater Toronto Area. Between 2001 and 2011, Milton was the fastest growing municipality in Canada, with a 71.4% increase in population from 2001 to 2006 and another 56.5% increase from 2006 to 2011. In 2016, Milton&#x27;s census population was 110,128 with an estimated growth to 228,000 by 2031. It remained the fastest growing community in Ontario but was deemed to be the sixth fastest growing in Canada at that time.

Milton is located west of Downtown Toronto on Highway 401, and is the western terminus for the Milton line commuter train and bus corridor operated by GO Transit. Milton is situated on the Niagara Escarpment, a UNESCO world biosphere reserve and the Bruce Trail.

==History==
The Mississaugas of the Credit held 648,000 acres of land north of the Head of the Lake Purchase lands and extending to the unceded territory of the Chippewa of Lakes Huron and Simcoe. In mid-October, 1818, the Chippewa ceded their land to the Crown in the Lake Simcoe-Nottawasaga Treaty and, by the end of October, the Crown sought to purchase the adjacent lands of the Mississaugas of the Credit. 
The Deputy Superintendent of the Indian Department, William Claus, met with the Mississaugas from October 27–29, 1818, and proposed that the Mississaugas sell their 648,000 acres of land in exchange for an annual amount of goods. The continuous inflow of settlers into their lands and fisheries had weakened the Mississaugas&#x27; traditional economy and had left them in a state of impoverishment and a rapidly declining population. In their enfeebled state, Chief Ajetance (d. 1829), on behalf of the assembled people, readily agreed to the sale of their lands for £522.10 of goods paid annually.
Significant municipalities found within the lands of the Ajetance Purchase of 1818 include Brampton and Milton.

The town took root out of a settlement by Jasper Martin along the Sixteen Mile Creek; Martin immigrated from Newcastle upon Tyne, England with his wife Sarah Coates and two sons on May 17, 1818. Martin was granted of land, from the Crown in 1820, designated Lot 14, Concession 2, Township of Trafalgar. Martin built a grist mill along the creek and created a pond, known as Mill Pond, to power his mill. The mill became the centre of settlement for others as they settled in the region. In 1837 the area had a population of approximately 100 people and was named after the English poet John Milton. The town, as it is today, soon after became known as Milton. The two principal property owners of the young town were the Martins and the Fosters, whose names are still reflected in numerous buildings and streets in Milton

Milton was incorporated into a town in 1857. Hugh Foster, of the aforementioned Foster family, donated of land to the county to construct the Milton Town Hall which stands on Mary Street.

By 1869, Milton had a population of 1,000. Records from 1874 indicate that Milton had county buildings, a telegraph office, a foundry, a tannery, a woolen factory, a grist mill and a saw mill, a weekly newspaper and a number of stores.

In 1891, Milton used electricity to light its streets for the first time and in 1905 the Town purchased the Milton Electric Light Company and built its own power station.

In the early 1900s, Milton was well known because of the P.L. Robertson Manufacturing Company, the first to make socket-head screws. Although formed in Hamilton in 1907, the business relocated to Milton in 1908. P.L. Robertson was the inventor of the square-socket drive for screws.

In 1974, the town of Milton added parts of the former township of Esquesing (most of this township comprises Halton Hills), all of Nassagaweya Township including the village of Campbellville, and the northern sections of Trafalgar and Nelson from (a 1962 annexation of the former townships) Oakville and Burlington respectively.

With the addition of the Niagara Escarpment lands, tourism, recreation, and heritage conservation have increased in importance. The Halton Region Museum, which has a large number of historic agricultural buildings, and the Halton County Radial Railway museum are located in Milton, as is Country Heritage Park (formerly the Ontario Agricultural Museum). Five large parks operated by Conservation Halton reside in the town, and Mohawk Raceway is located near Campbellville. It is also home to Maplehurst Correctional Complex, the Vanier Centre for Women and one of two criminal courthouses serving Halton Region.

On January 1st, 2010, land was bought by the City of Mississauga and scaled down its border by to Hwy. 407, affecting 25 residents.

==Neighbourhoods==
Milton&#x27;s Planning Department divides the town into communities. These divisions have little to do with politics and are based on traditional neighbourhoods.

==Education==

Milton&#x27;s public elementary and secondary schools are part of the Halton District School Board. Milton&#x27;s Catholic elementary and secondary schools are part of the Halton Catholic District School Board. There are also several private schools in Milton.

In 2008, the town reached an agreement in principle with Wilfrid Laurier University for the latter to establish a satellite campus in Milton. Funding of $90 million for the Milton Education Village which would also include a Conestoga College satellite campus, on land donated by the town, was approved by the provincial government in April 2018. In October 2018 funding for the project was withdrawn by the new Ontario government (elected in June) before construction had begun. Mayor Gord Krantz indicated that the town would look for alternative funding.

As of the fall 2019 season, there were no reports of funding for a Milton campus but Wilfrid Laurier University was offering some services in town, including a Master of Education program at the Milton Education Village Innovation Centre and a Lecture Series. In summer, Laurier was operating the Enriched Academic Program (LEAP) day camp.

==Transportation==

===Roads===
There are three main arterial east-west regional roads that run through urban Milton: Halton Regional Road #6 or Britannia Road in the south, Halton Regional Road #7 or Derry Road in central Milton, and Halton Regional Road #8 or Steeles Avenue in the north. Three north-south regional roads bisect the town: Halton Regional Road #22 or Tremaine Road in the west; Halton Regional Road #25 or Highway 25 as Ontario Street through the middle of town linking Milton to Acton in the north and Bronte (Oakville) in the south; and Halton Regional Road #4 or James Snow Parkway in the east. A number of improvements have been undertaken since 2009 to increase capacity and alleviate delays due to congestion and train traffic on these numbered regional roads.

Highway 401 bisects the Town and effectively separates the mainly rural and industrial areas to the north from the primarily residential and commercial developments in the southern part of town. The highway was to be widened to ten lanes from the James Snow Parkway to west of Regional Road 25, in a major project, starting in autumn 2019.

===Bridges===
A number of overpass and underpass projects have been constructed in recent years for the grade separation of railway crossings, including on Britannia Road, Derry Road, Main Street, and James Snow Parkway.

===Public transportation===

Milton Transit is the municipal provider of bus services for the town. Milton Transit provides conventional and Milton access+ (paratransit) service, operating on weekdays and Saturdays, with connections to routes and GO Transit services at the Milton GO Station.

Milton Transit has delivered service since the early 1980s in various forms. With recommendations from the North Halton Transit Strategy, Council approved the delivery of a contracted, fixed-route transit system in 2004. Milton Transit officially launched conventional service in August later that year and began purchasing its own branded buses in 2008.

Milton Transit service is provided by a private service provider under contract, PWTransit Canada, who employ bus operators and maintain Milton Transit fleet. Vehicles include 23 low floor buses for full accessibility. In 2018, the town cited 552,654 revenue passenger trips and approximately 400 active bus stops in the community.

Intercity service is served by GO Transit via buses and trains. Commuter service to and from Toronto is the key routing, with some buses connecting to Oakville. On October 31, 2009, GO Transit started service with a line from Square One Shopping Centre in Mississauga to the University of Waterloo, therefore allowing a trip to Kitchener and Cambridge.

===Railways===
Freight trains on the main Montreal-Toronto-Chicago CP line and a secondary CN line are a common sight in Milton. The town at present has very little passenger rail service in comparison to other GTA communities with only one-way, weekday peak-service inbound to Toronto in the morning, and outbound from Toronto in the evening. The nearest Via Rail station in the Toronto-New York City corridor is Oakville station.

The most easily accessible GO Transit railway station is Milton station.

Canadian National Railway planned to build an &quot;intermodal&quot; or &quot;truck-rail hub&quot; facility on rural land in the south of the town (bordered by Tremaine Rd., Britannia Rd. and Lower Base Line) that would be used to transfer freight between trucks and trains. According to a late-July 2019 news report, the plan was controversial with &quot;local mayors and residents voicing objections over potential congestion and environmental impacts&quot; because of the &quot;estimated 1,600 daily truck trips&quot; that the facility would require. Public hearings had been completed by that time. A three person panel was to file its recommendations by early 2020 to the Minister of Environment and Climate Change. Halton Region was also lobbying against the planned facility and stated another area of concern in late 2018:Additionally, CN has only revealed its plans for 400 acres on the site; they have not disclosed its plans for the remaining 800 acres. We have determined that the operations at this site can be significantly expanded which will further increase the impacts on residents and the community.

===Air===
The nearest airport to Milton is the Burlington Airpark in neighboring Burlington, Ontario. It is a thriving general-aviation field, but the airport does not have any regular commercial passenger flight service. Some charter operations are provided.

Pearson International Airport, Canada&#x27;s largest passenger-volume airport, is located only to the east. The much smaller John C. Munro Hamilton International Airport is located from Milton.

==Sports==

===Milton Sports Hall of Fame===
Milton has a long sports history. In 2016, that history was formally recognized through a joint community-municipal project with the creation of the Milton Sports Hall of Fame. A volunteer committee was stuck in 2014. The inaugural class of inductees was announced in August 2016, with the formal induction ceremony taking place on November 24, 2016. A wall of fame to recognize the inaugural inductees as well as future inductees has been constructed in the Milton Sports Centre.

===Baseball===
Baseball has a long history in Milton, particularly in Campbellville where it had its beginnings with the Lumberman&#x27;s Baseball Club as early as 1872. It really flourished as a &quot;community tradition&quot; in the 1920s and 30s, and again in the 1950s and 60s with the Campbellville Intermediate Baseball Team, which won numerous county and provincial titles in a 16-year span from 1952 to 1967. A grandstand and club house was erected in 1960 in Campbellville to make room for the 2,000 spectators that would descend on the hamlet. In 1953, the Campbellville Baseball Club won the OBA Intermediate C Championship in just its second year in the league, before repeating again and again. Managed by Len Andrews, the men&#x27;s Campbellville Merchants baseball team won 11 consecutive Halton county league titles, as well as 12 Ontario Championship titles between 1952 and 1967, an amazing feat for a hamlet of 300 at the time. Known as the Merchants, the intermediate men&#x27;s squad (1952-67 era) was inducted into the Baseball Ontario Hall of Fame in 2014. Campbellville teams won four more provincial titles between 1968 and 1984.

Minor baseball in Milton was formally recognized through the incorporation of the Milton Minor Baseball Association as Baseball Milton in 1985. Programs range from junior t-ball all the way to midget, with house, select and rep leagues. Teams are known as the Milton Mets. In 2016, the Milton Mets major rookie team captured the boys&#x27; COBA Triple-A title.

===Basketball===
The Milton Stags are a youth basketball club and affiliated member club of Basketball Ontario and Basketball Canada.

=== Cricket ===
Cricket activities in Milton started in 2002 from the play fields around Bishop Reding School and later in 2012 from the turf pitch at the Boyne park. Initially, cricket was played in the T-10 format using tape tennis balls. Around 2012, Sal Saeed (president - MCGA) worked with Milton town to set up the first authentic cricket field at Sherwood park. Currently, there are multiple clubs in Milton participating in various indoor/outdoor tournaments.

===Curling===
Milton Curling Club is a member-owned volunteer club with four sheets of ice and is open from October to April.

===Cycling===
The Niagara Escarpment forms an excellent natural training ground for mountain biking and road cycling in Milton. Milton is also home to the Mattamy National Cycling Centre, opened in 2015, which includes the headquarters and practice facilities for Cycling Canada, as well as Canadian Cycling Hall of Fame.

===Gymnastics===
Milton Springers Gymnastics Club have existed since 1974.

===Hockey===
In 1942, the Milton Bricks Tigers won an OHA Junior &quot;C&quot; title. Milton defeated Oakville to advance to the semi-finals and Parry Sound to move on to the finals against the Preston Riversides. In the Schmalz Cup best of three series, which was held at Maple Leaf Gardens, Milton won game one by a score of 6-4, with three goals coming from Milton&#x27;s future NHL player Enio Sclisizzi, and game two by a score of 10-1. This victory came on the heels of a loss in the finals three years earlier versus Aurora.

NHLer and four-time Stanley Cup champion John Tonelli is the most well-known hockey player to come from Milton. There is a Milton arena named in his honour. NHL referee Bruce Hood and linesman Leon Stickle are also Milton products.

A banner hockey year came in 1976 when the Milton Tridents Intermediate B team won the Southern Counties league championship over the Tillsonburg Maroons in seven games, and the Docs and Dents minor atom team won the OMHA Central Ontario zone championship. The Docs and Dents were the first Milton minor hockey team to go undefeated in the Tri-County league, winning 26 games and tying two.

The Milton Icehawks were a Junior &quot;A&quot; ice hockey team in the Ontario Junior A Hockey League. They are one of the most historical teams in the Ontario Junior Hockey League, having been formed in 1966.

Trucking magnate Brad Grant purchased the team in the late 1980s when it seemed like the organization might fold, and led the team to tremendous success in the late 1990s. During his 15-year ownership run, the team captured four division crowns, three league championships and a provincial title. In 2001, Grant sold the team to an Oakville trio that consisted of ex-NHLer Dave Gagner, Mario Forgione, who owned the Mississauga IceDogs at the time and was an automotive parts manufacturing president, and wine distillery consultant Ken Chase.

For the 2003–04 season, Forgione changed the team&#x27;s name from the Merchants to the IceHawks to reflect the team&#x27;s connection with the local minor hockey programs called the Winterhawks, and Forgione&#x27;s ownership of the Mississauga IceDogs. In 2006, Forgione officially affiliated the Icehawks with the IceDogs.

In the spring of 2006, ex-NHL goaltender Rick Heinz&#x27; attempt to purchase the nearby Tier-2 Junior Georgetown Raiders fell through, but by July 2006 the local Campbellville resident Heinz had talked Forgione into selling the Icehawks, and the affiliation with the IceDogs ended. Heinz sold the team just nine months later after starting the season with essentially no committed players. Dean Piett, a commercial real estate businessman from Burlington, and Rob DeVincentis, the Ancaster owner of a construction business, purchased the team from Heinz and have owned the team ever since the sale in 2007. Both Piett and DeVincetis had a son playing on the team in 2008, which led to friction amongst other players.

The Icehawks (2003–2018) have previously been known as the Milton Flyers (1979–1981), Milton Steamers (1981–1986), and Milton Merchants (1986–2003). Many notable players have suited up for Milton over the years, including NHL stars John Tavares, Daniel Carcillo, Sam Gagner, Rich Peverley, Darren Haydar and Matt Read.

The new Milton Menace Hockey Club, a Junior A hockey franchise, was formed from the Newmarket Hurricane team, purchased in early March 2019. The 2019–2020 season was the club&#x27;s first, with games at the Milton Memorial Arena.

===Running===
Milton was represented by distance runner Ed Whitlock, who held numerous age-related records for the marathon, half-marathon and long-distance track events, both indoor and outdoor. Milton&#x27;s Ben Preisner represented Canada at the 2020 Summer Olympics in Tokyo.

===Skating===
The town offers drop-in skating at several arenas; some of those also feature competitive skating events. Private organizations include the Milton Skating Club and Milton Speed Skating.

In 1976, Milton&#x27;s Kevin Parker won a Canadian national novice skating title in London.

===Skiing===
The Niagara Escarpment forms an excellent natural training ground for skiing in Milton. It is also the site of Glen Eden ski area, where Olympian and Miltonian Travis Gerrits got his start.

Milton SC are currently representing Milton in the Canadian Soccer League after joining the league in the 2014 season. Milltown Football Club was a soccer club based in Milton, playing in Division 1 of the Peel Halton Soccer League. Milltown FC joined the Canadian Soccer League in the 2010 season as an expansion club but opted out of the league after one season due to disagreement over membership terms and conditions.

===Swimming===
The Milton Marlins are youth-focused swim team based out of the Milton Sports Centre. Coach and swim trainer Carole Murray was instrumental in teaching thousands of kids in Milton how to swim from the 1970s until she sold her swim school in 2006. She won a coach of the year award from the federal government in 1988. She was also a coach for the Marlins. Under her watch Campbellville&#x27;s Alicia Hicken competed in the Canadian Olympic Trials and Canadian Winter Nationals in 1991.

==Development==

The town has very easy access throughout the GTA by Highways 401 and 407 towards Oakville, Burlington and Hamilton on the town, or by the former Highway 25 (Halton Road 25). There are two key freight railway routes (both by CN and CP), passenger services from GO Transit, and Via Rail passenger connections in the Quebec City–Windsor Corridor in both neighbouring Oakville and Georgetown. There is close proximity to Toronto Pearson International Airport along Highway 401 (under 40 km from 401/Halton 25 exit).

Milton Transit was developed in 1972 to provide public transportation service throughout the urban centre, as well as a feeder route for GO Transit trains and buses.

While most of the development is suburban in nature, larger industrial lots are being developed closer to the escarpment. The major industries in Milton are automotive, advanced manufacturing, distribution and food production.

The town published a Current Development Map and also a Future Urban Structure Map - Building Possibility document that indicates the general plan for the use of lands in future, intended to &quot;minimize further expansion of urban areas and unnecessary and inefficient consumption of land&quot;.

===1970s growth===
In 1978, the Ontario Municipal Board approved the Alliance Ex-Urban project, paving the way for a 532-unit plan, which broke ground with an initial 180 houses at Bronte St. and Derry Rd. in 1979.

A further 600 detached and semi-detached houses were completed in 1979, as Timberlea moved into phase two of its construction. Phase One saw 300 homes built in the Timberlea area bounded by Derry Rd., Thompson Rd. and Ontario St. S. The final Timberlea village includes 1,400 homes.

An additional 30 homes were built in 1979 by Kingsway Plastering on Commercial St, and 10 new units in Campbellville&#x27;s McLaren Subdivision. A 107-unit apartment complex was also completed in 1979 on Millside Drive.

Building permit totals in 1976 reached $28 million, before dipping in 1977, and rebounding to nearly $23 million in 1978. In 1979, the estimated total building permit revenue reached $100 million.

By 1979, the town zoning administrator stated that, due to drinking water limitations at the time, completion of the Timberlea and Alliance projects would &quot;complete all the residential development that can go into the town.&quot; For the next 20 years, very little growth occurred in Milton.

===21st century===
Residential growth has increased substantially since 2002 due to completion of &quot;The Big Pipe&quot; project; designed to deliver water to the town from Lake Ontario. Since then, Milton developed an initial seven new subdivisions, including Hawthorne Village, and several new ones are under development by Mattamy Homes and various other builders. Multiple new grade schools have been built, as well as the Crossroads Centre shopping plaza that includes various major retail stores and restaurants. An eight-screen movie theatre is operated by Cineplex Entertainment under their Galaxy Cinemas brand and opened on June 30, 2006.

In July 2014, Milton council approved 11 new residential applications that will see an additional 6,000 homes built, increasing the population by roughly 25,000 new residents. In 2013-14, Milton approved construction of a track-cycling velodrome venue for the 2015 Pan American Games called the Mattamy National Cycling Centre. The facility sits at the heart of a 150-acre plot of land that is designated for a proposed future Wilfrid Laurier University campus.

A mid 2019 report stated that roughly 3,100 high-density residential units were being planned or being built in the town.

A mid-2019 report discussed two new subdivisions being planned, Agerton (along Trafalgar Road east of the 401), &quot;for a mixed-use employment and higher-density residential community&quot; and Trafalgar, a &quot;mixed-use, transit-supportive, higher-density community ... along Trafalgar Road between Derry Road to south of Britannia Road&quot;. The Milton Education Village area was to be further developed, as an urban neighbourhood with post-secondary education, residential, commercial and recreational segments.

====Official Plan====
As of November 2019, the town was using the Official Plan approved by Halton Region on December 14, 1997, and by the Ontario Municipal Board (OMB) on July 19, 1999. Public meetings were scheduled for late 2019 to obtain residents&#x27; comments on changes that might be appropriate for the next Official Plan.

==Commerce==
The villages of Milton Heights and Peru are unique in Milton, as they were the centres of industrial rather than farming communities. This has given this part of Milton a unique character that has left a legacy in the buildings and people that remain in the area. From the 1850s and &#x27;60s until 1877, a lumber mill operated in the area, as well as a saw mill in the mid-1800s. The railway fueled industry when it opened in 1879 in Milton.

The area was traditionally famous for quarrying and the production of building materials such as lime, limestone and bricks, which started in the 1880s. These industries were of provincial significance and, at their peak at the turn of the 20th century, they employed hundreds of people in the Milton Heights and Peru areas.

In addition, the materials that were produced here were used in many of the buildings in both urban and rural Milton as well as in buildings throughout Ontario. These were huge industrial operations for their time and they attracted considerable immigration to Milton.

Early industry in Milton consisted of the Milton Pressed Brick Company, which started in the 1880s, and the P.L. Robertson screw factory, which started in 1908.

An August 2017 report indicated that Mattamy Homes&#x27; Halton/Hamilton Divisional Office was located in Milton. Other companies with Canadian head offices, or a major employment presence, in Milton include:
* 3M Canada
* Chudleigh&#x27;s Limited
* Dare Foods
* DSV Canada
* Dufferin Aggregates Milton Quarry 
* Gordon Food Service (592 employees)
* Johnson Controls
* Karmax Heavy Stamping, a division of Magna International (950 employees)
* Lowe&#x27;s distribution centre
* Manheim Auto Auctions (750 employees)
* Modatek Systems, a division of Magna International
* Northstar Aerospace
* Rockwool (formerly branded as Roxul) 
* Whirlpool Canada
* Wolseley Canada distribution centre

A 2017 summary of the benefits of Milton as a location for industry stated that the town&#x27;s &quot;proximity to the 400-series highways, rail links, and international airports, as well as the municipality&#x27;s commitment to economic development, have all helped drive Milton&#x27;s dynamic growth&quot;.

The town&#x27;s mid-2019 report highlighted three major new facilities in Milton: Kimberly-Clark&#x27;s of warehouse and distribution, Prologis&#x27; of warehouse space leased to Jaguar Land Rover and Sun Life Financial&#x27;s planned of speculative industrial building. At that time, the town had an inventory of of industrial space, with only 2.7% being unoccupied.

The mid-2019 report also listed new businesses that had opened facilities in town in 2018: PBS Systems Group, Infrastructure Ontario, Enable Education, Responsive Consulting and Throwback Entertainment. At that time, the Derry Green Business Park Development was underway; the plan was &quot;accommodate a mix of businesses including innovative logistics, advanced manufacturing and distribution facilities&quot; in this new area.

<text>Pathé Records was an international record company and label and producer of phonographs, based in France, and active from the 1890s through the 1930s.

== Early years ==
The Pathé record business was founded by brothers Charles and Émile Pathé, then owners of a successful bistro in Paris. In the mid-1890s, they began selling Edison and Columbia phonographs and accompanying cylinder records. Shortly thereafter, the brothers designed and sold their own phonographs. These incorporated elements of other brands. Soon after, they also started marketing pre-recorded cylinder records. By 1896 the Pathé brothers had offices and recording studios not only in Paris, but also in London, Milan, and St. Petersburg.

== Pathé cylinders and discs ==

In 1894, the Pathé brothers started selling their own phonographs. The earliest Pathé offerings were phonograph cylinders. Pathé manufactured cylinder records until approximately 1914. In addition to standard size cylinder records (), Pathé produced several larger styles. The &quot;Salon&quot; records measured in diameter and the larger &quot;Stentor&quot; records measured in diameter. The &quot;Le Céleste&quot; records, the largest commercial cylinder records manufactured by any phonograph company, measured in diameter by long.

In 1905 the Pathé brothers entered the growing field of disc records. They needed to employ several unusual technologies as preventive measures against patent infringement. At first they sold single-sided discs with a recording in wax on top of a cement base. In October 1906 they started producing discs in the more usual manner with shellac. Even with this less eccentric material, the early Pathé discs were unlike any others. The sound was recorded vertically in the groove, rather than side-to-side, and the groove was wider than in other companies&#x27; records, requiring a special ball-shaped stylus for playing. The discs rotated at 90 rpm, rather than the usual 75 to 80 rpm. Originally, the groove started on the inside, near the center of the disc, and spiraled out to the edge. In 1916, Pathé changed over to the customary rim-start format, a more nearly normal 80 rpm speed, and paper labels instead of the stamped-in, paint-filled text previously used. Pathé discs were commonly produced in , , and sizes. , , and discs were also made, as were very large discs that played at 120 rpm. Due to their fragility, unwieldiness, and much higher price, the largest sizes were a commercial failure and were not produced for long.

In France, Pathé became the largest and most successful distributor of cylinder records and phonographs. These, however, failed to make significant headway in foreign markets such as the United Kingdom and the United States where other brands were already in widespread use. Although Pathé cylinder records were never popular outside France, their disc records sold successfully in many foreign countries such as the United States, United Kingdom, Germany, Italy, and Russia.

Pathé was the first company to make master recordings in a different medium than the final commercial product. In the Pathé recording studios, masters were cut on what was called a &quot;Master Cylinder&quot;, rapidly spinning wax cylinders that measured about long and in diameter. Beginning in 1913, special &quot;Paradis&quot; cylinders about in diameter and long were used. The large, fast-spinning cylinders allowed for a greater level of audio fidelity. The various types of commercial Pathé cylinders and discs were then dubbed (or &quot;pantographed&quot;) from these masters. This dubbing process enabled copies of the same master recording to be made available on multiple formats. The process sometimes resulted in uneven results on the final commercial record, causing a pronounced rumble or other audio artifacts (This rumble was generally undetectable on acoustic wind-up phonographs of the period, but is noticeable on electric and more modern equipment.), and has transformed the company&#x27;s early discography into one of the most daunting to rebuild. 

More specifically, the most important part of the Pathé system was the way master cylinders and their finished product were catalogued; in a way very similar to Berliner Gramophone&#x27;s, Pathé used a block system to store the information of Master Cylinders and a serial system for the actual commercial pressings. That is, the same &quot;matrix&quot; number was first allocated to early 1890s cylinders (with a specific selection), then to a proper Master Cylinder that re-recorded the same selection, and then for the later selections that were recorded on the same Master Cylinder after its musical content became obsolete or damaged and had to be reshaved (which weren&#x27;t necessarily the same musical selection). As for the stampers, each stamper of both cylinders and disc (independently from the size) has the same serial number (different between both formats), and is more or less sequential, so that media from 1916 and before (before paper labels were introduced) can be more or less easily traced back after obtaining a great enough information about each &quot;snapshot&quot; of the Master Cylinder.

After 1927, the company started taking a more modern approach and commenced using the simple system of master and stamper discs that the rest of corporations were using. Finally, after 1929, the company dismantled their entire Master Cylinder archive and written proof of every selection recorded to finance the company after the crisis.

The vertically cut Pathé discs normally required a special Pathé phonograph equipped with a sapphire ball stylus. The advantage of the sapphire ball stylus was its permanence. There was no need to change a needle after every record side. Since most records and phonographs used a different playback method, various attachments were marketed that allowed one to equip a Pathé phonograph to play standard, laterally-cut records. Attachments were also sold to equip a standard phonograph to play Pathé records.

In 1920, Pathé introduced a line of &quot;needle-cut&quot; records, at first only for the US market. The needle-cut records were laterally-cut discs designed to be compatible with standard phonographs, and they were labelled &quot;Pathé Actuelle&quot;. In the following year, these &quot;needle-cut&quot; records were introduced in the United Kingdom and within a few more years they were selling more than the vertical Pathés, even on the continent. Attempts to market the Pathé vertical-cut discs abroad were abandoned in 1925, though they continued to sell in France until 1932.

In mid-1922, Pathé introduced a lower priced label called Perfect. This label became one of the most popular and successful &quot;dime store&quot; labels of the 1920s, and survived beyond the end of the US Pathé label – discontinued in 1930 – right up to 1938.

In January 1927, Pathé began recording using the new electronic microphone technology, as opposed to the strictly acoustical-mechanical method of recording they used until then.

In December 1928, the French and British Pathé phonograph assets were sold to the British Columbia Graphophone Company. In July 1929, the assets of the American Pathé record company were merged into the newly formed American Record Corporation. However, the Pathé and Pathé-Marconi records imprints continued in Italy. In 1931 the label continued as VCM group (&#x27;Voce de Maestro [His Master&#x27;s Voice] - Columbia - Marconiphone&#x27;).

The Pathé and Pathé-Marconi labels and catalogue still survive, first as imprints of EMI and now currently EMI&#x27;s successor Parlophone Records. In 1967 EMI Italiana took control of the entire catalog. In turn, the Universal Music Group acquired EMI Italiana in 2013. The film division of Pathé Frères still survives in France.

<text>Trenton (2001 population 16,770) is a large community in Central Ontario in the municipality of Quinte West, Ontario, Canada. Located on the Bay of Quinte, it is the starting point for the Trent-Severn Waterway, which continues northwest to Peterborough and eventually Port Severn on Georgian Bay.

==History==
The Trenton area is part of the traditional area of the Mississauga and other Indigenous First Nations. The first known expedition by Europeans in the area was one by French explorer Samuel de Champlain, which followed the Trent passing through Trenton in 1615. The Trent River is known to the Mississauga as &quot;Sangichiwigewonk&quot;, or &#x27;fast flowing.&#x27; Settlers gave it the name &#x27;Trent&#x27;, after the River Trent in England.

The area around the mouth of the Trent River was first settled by Europeans in the 1780s, after the area was ceded to the British in 1783 as part of the Crawford Purchase. United Empire Loyalists first settled in Trenton in 1792. First named Trent Port, it was renamed Trent Town and later became Trenton. Assorted settlements and town plots in the area went under a number of names until the Village of Trenton was incorporated in 1853. Trenton grew thanks to its port location and the area&#x27;s lumber industry. During the First World War, the town was home to a major munitions plant owned by the British Chemical Company. This facility was built in 1915 to manufacture artillery, rifle, and small arms ammunition. Three weeks before the Armistice, an explosion levelled the plant. Remains of the old plant can still be found today.

Trenton was also an important film production centre. In 1917, a film studio was built in the town and a number of productions were filmed there. In 1923, the Trenton Film Plant was purchased by the Ontario government to house the studio and laboratory of the Ontario Motion Picture Bureau. The advent of talkies and 16mm film made the equipment at the film plant obsolete and the facility closed in 1934.

The construction of a RCAF Station Trenton, a major Royal Canadian Air Force base just east of Trenton, started in 1929 and continued through the 1930s. This provided a major economic boost to the area through the Great Depression, the Second World War and later.

Trenton was incorporated as a city in 1980. On January 1, 1998, Trenton was amalgamated with the Village of Frankford and the Townships of Murray and Sidney to form Quinte West. Home to nearly half the population of Quinte West, Trenton is the largest community within the municipality, and is one of Ontario&#x27;s largest unincorporated settlements.

==Economy==
Canadian Forces Base Trenton/8 Wing, located on the east side of the town, is an important facility for the Royal Canadian Air Force&#x27;s transport and search and rescue operations, and is Trenton&#x27;s main employer.

Other large employers include Trenton Cold Storage, Norampac, Kruger, Mapco, Citipack, Jobsters, Pentair Thermal Controls, Nestlé, ElectroCables, Domtech, Global Med Inc., Mckesson Canada and DECA Cables.

Tourism also plays an important role in the economy, given Trenton&#x27;s location as the southern entry point for the Trent–Severn Waterway.

From 1917 to 1920, The Parker Bros. Textile Mill was a movie studio, which dubbed Trenton &quot;Hollywood North&quot;.

==Transportation==

Highway 401 crosses the Trent River on the north side of the town. Hastings County Road 2 (formerly Ontario Highway 2) is the main east–west route through town, leading towards Brighton in the west and to Belleville in the east. The main north–south route is Hastings County Road 33 (formerly Ontario Highway 33), leading towards Picton to the south and Stirling to the north.

Canadian Pacific and Canadian National main railway lines (Toronto – Ottawa/Montreal) pass through the city. Via Rail offers limited passenger service to and from Toronto, Ottawa and Montreal via Kingston to Trenton Junction station.

Trenton Airport is co-located with CFB Trenton on the east side of town.

Trenton is the starting point for the Trent–Severn Waterway and two locks (Lock 1 and Lock 2) are located in the community.

Trenton also has a local public transit system, run by Quinte Access. It runs an hourly schedule Monday to Friday and limited service on Saturday (no Sunday Service, check for holidays) with Chevrolet Arboc specialized buses with ramps for wheelchairs. Several private firms also provide dispatched taxi services.
==Climate==
==Recreation and culture==
Trenton is located on the Lake Ontario Waterfront Trail. Surrounding Trenton, there are numerous conservation areas, a YMCA, campsites, picnic grounds, and marinas. The area has nine golf courses, three ice hockey rinks, numerous soccer fields, bowling, many kilometres of walking trails, a dog park, curling rinks and baseball diamonds, amongst many other recreational activities. Trenton also serves as a gateway to Prince Edward County, south of the Bay of Quinte. This area is becoming increasingly well known for its vineyards, camping, beaches and boating.

The city is home to the Trenton Golden Hawks a junior hockey team that plays in the OJHL.

Trenton is the site of the National Air Force Museum of Canada. It features an original RAF Halifax Bomber, the 75th RCAF time capsule, a Lockheed CC-130E Hercules, and many other aircraft and exhibits. The museum is presently restoring an Avro Lancaster bomber.

Every summer CFB Trenton also is home to over one thousand Royal Canadian Air Cadets who attend two-week Familiarization Courses, three-week Introductory Specialty Courses, and six-week Advanced Specialty Courses, and has special staff positions for more senior cadets. These summer courses introduce the cadets to a military learning environment. Most camps here also go on trips to the airport, the Air Museum, and other relevant places.

Trenton is a hot spot for sport fishing. Popular freshwater fish in the Bay of Quinte and the Trent River include walleye (pickerel), bass, pike, perch, and mudcat. During particular times of the year, salmon and rainbow trout can be caught in the Trent River and in cold-water streams in the area. Each year in May, the Kiwanis Club of Trenton holds the Annual Live Release Fishing Derby, attracting thousands of sport fishermen from around North America with major prizes for tagged fish and heaviest weighed walleye and Northern pike.

In 1990, Canadian poet Al Purdy (who received the Order of Canada and the Governor General&#x27;s award) published his only novel &quot;A Splinter In The Heart&quot;. It takes place entirely in Trenton and provides a historical look at the town. It mentions many of the landmarks in the city (Mount Pelion, The Bridges, Trent River, etc.) and documents the period of the town directly before and after the huge munitions plant explosion of 1918. Purdy also wrote a poem entitled &quot;At the Quinte Hotel&quot; about the strip club in Trenton called The Sherwood Forest Inn.

Another thing that Trenton is known for is its great swimming, fishing and boating. In addition it is known for being the capital of walleye fishing.

==Education==
The public school system is served by the Hastings &amp; Prince Edward District School Board, and the separate school system is served by the Algonquin and Lakeshore Catholic District School Board as well as one school in the area that is part of the neighbouring school board, the Kawartha Pine Ridge District School Board.

There is also the French public school boards: Conseil des écoles publiques de l&#x27;Est de l&#x27;Ontario and Conseil des écoles catholiques du Centre-Est.

<text>William P. Hobby Airport — colloquially referred to as Houston Hobby or other short names — is an international airport in Houston, Texas, located from downtown Houston. Hobby is Houston&#x27;s oldest commercial airport, and was its primary airport until the Houston Intercontinental Airport, now known as the George Bush Intercontinental Airport, opened in 1969. Hobby was initially closed after the opening of Houston Intercontinental; however, it was re-opened after several years, and became a secondary airport for domestic airline service, and a center for corporate and private aviation.

Houston Hobby is an operating base for Southwest Airlines, which has international and domestic flights from HOU, and carries the vast majority of its passengers. , Houston Hobby is the fifth largest airport in Southwest&#x27;s network. Southwest opened its first international terminal at Houston Hobby, and began service from Houston Hobby to Mexico and Central and South America on October 15, 2015.

The William P. Hobby Airport covers , and has three runways. Its original art deco terminal building, the first passenger airline terminal in Houston, now houses the 1940 Air Terminal Museum.

Hobby became the first 5-Star Airport in North America by Skytrax in 2022.

==History==
Hobby Airport opened in June 1927 as a private landing field in a pasture known as W.T. Carter Field. In the 1930s, it was served by Braniff International Airways and Eastern Air Lines. The site was acquired by the city of Houston and was named Houston Municipal Airport in 1937. The airport was renamed Howard R. Hughes Airport in 1938. Howard Hughes was responsible for several improvements to the airport, including its first control tower, built in 1938.
The airport&#x27;s name changed back to Houston Municipal because Hughes was still alive at the time and regulations did not allow federal improvement funds for an airport named after a living person.

The city of Houston opened a new air terminal and hangar in 1940.

===Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) in 1943===
The first three Women Airforce Service Pilots (WASP) training classes were held at the Houston Municipal Airport in 1943.

===Airlines in the 1940s and 1950s===
In June 1948, Braniff International Airways began international flights from Houston operated with Douglas DC-4 and DC-6s to South America via Cuba and Panama. In the June 1948 timetable, the airline had two flights a week to Havana, Cuba – Panama City, Panama (via Balboa, Canal Zone) – Guayaquil, Ecuador – Lima, Peru and a third flight that skipped Guayaquil. In 1949, Braniff flew direct via Lima to Rio de Janeiro, Brazil and La Paz, Bolivia. In 1950, Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) began nonstop Douglas DC-4 service to Mexico City. On October 1, 1950, Chicago and Southern Air Lines began flying new Lockheed Constellations nonstop to St. Louis and direct to Chicago Midway Airport. Chicago &amp; Southern flew nonstop to New Orleans, the sole purpose being to connect to the airline&#x27;s daily Douglas DC-4 &quot;Caribbean Comet&quot; flights between New Orleans and Havana, Cuba; Kingston, Jamaica and Caracas, Venezuela as Chicago &amp; Southern did not then have local traffic rights between Houston and New Orleans. In 1953, Chicago &amp; Southern (C&amp;S) was acquired by and merged into Delta Air Lines, giving Delta access to Houston for the first time. In 1954, Delta, operating as &quot;Delta C&amp;S&quot;, was flying a daily Convair 340 Houston – New Orleans – Havana, Cuba – Port au Prince, Haiti – Ciudad Trujillo (now Santo Domingo), Dominican Republic – San Juan, Puerto Rico. Also in 1954, an expanded terminal building opened to support the 53,640 airline flights that carried 910,047 passengers. The airport was renamed Houston International Airport the same year.

The April 1957 &quot;Official Airline Guide&quot; lists 26 weekday departures on Eastern, 20 on Braniff (plus four departures a week to/from South America), nine on Continental Airlines, nine on Delta Air Lines, nine on Trans-Texas Airways, four on National Airlines, two on Pan American World Airways and one on American Airlines. There were nonstops to New York City and Washington D.C., but not to Chicago or Denver or anywhere west of Colorado. Later in 1957, KLM Royal Dutch Airlines started Douglas DC-7C flights to Amsterdam via Montreal. In 1958, Delta was operating daily nonstop Douglas DC-7s to New York City and weekly DC-7s direct to Caracas, Venezuela via New Orleans (Delta called this latter service the &quot;El Petrolero&quot;) while Eastern Douglas DC-7s and Lockheed Constellations flew nonstop to New York City.

===The jet age arrives===

Houston&#x27;s first scheduled jets were Delta Douglas DC-8s nonstop to New York in December 1959 (Cearley says they began on December 1). Braniff International introduced Boeing 707s in April 1960, nonstop to Dallas Love Field and direct to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport; Braniff Lockheed L-188 Electra propjets flew nonstop to Chicago Midway Airport and Dallas Love Field, and direct to Denver, Minneapolis/St. Paul, Kansas City and Lubbock. In June 1960, Eastern Airlines Douglas DC-8s flew nonstop to New York City Idlewild Airport and to Atlanta, in addition to Lockheed L-188 Electras nonstop to Washington D.C. National Airport with one-stop Electras to Newark. In July 1960, KLM introduced Douglas DC-8 flights to Amsterdam via Montreal before moving to Houston Intercontinental Airport (now George Bush Intercontinental Airport), where they remain today with nonstop Boeing 787 flights to Amsterdam. On May 15, 1960, Delta Air Lines operated the world&#x27;s first Convair 880 scheduled passenger flight nonstop to New York City Idlewild Airport from Hobby. Delta would introduce Convair 880 flights nonstop to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, St. Louis and New Orleans from Houston in addition to its service to New York City.

In June 1961, National Airlines Douglas DC-8s and Continental 707s began flying nonstop to Los Angeles, and National Electras flew nonstop to Las Vegas, San Diego and San Francisco. These were Houston&#x27;s first nonstops beyond El Paso. In 1963, Continental Vickers Viscounts operated a &quot;milk run&quot; multi-stop service on a routing of Houston-Austin-San Angelo-Midland/Odessa-El Paso-Tucson-Phoenix-Los Angeles while Continental Viscounts also flew direct to Lubbock and Amarillo. In summer 1965, American Airlines only had one jet flight a day from Hobby, a Boeing 707 flying Houston-San Antonio-El Paso-Phoenix-Oakland-San Francisco. Eastern Boeing 727-100s flew nonstop to Washington D.C. Dulles Airport, New Orleans and Corpus Christi and direct to New York Newark Airport and Boston. Eastern Boeing 720s flew nonstop to New York JFK Airport, Atlanta, New Orleans and San Antonio and direct to Boston and Philadelphia. By 1966, Houston-based Trans-Texas Airways (&quot;TTa&quot;) had introduced Douglas DC-9-10s with nonstop flights to Dallas Love Field, Corpus Christi and Baton Rouge and direct to New Orleans. In 1966, Braniff was operating flights via interchange agreements with both Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) and United Airlines from Hobby. The service with Pan Am flew to London, England and Frankfurt, Germany daily with Boeing 707s via at Dallas Love Field and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. The joint operation with United was flown with Boeing 720s twice daily Houston-Dallas-Denver-Seattle and Houston-Dallas-Denver-Portland, OR-Seattle. The same year, Braniff BAC One-Elevens flew nonstop to Dallas Love Field, Fort Worth (via Greater Southwest International Airport), Tulsa and Corpus Christi and direct to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport, Minneapolis/St. Paul, St. Louis and Wichita.

In 1967, the airport was renamed after a former Texas governor, William P. Hobby.

Besides the Braniff/Pan Am and KLM services to Europe, the airport had other long flights: Braniff was flying nonstop from Hobby to Panama City, Panama with Boeing 707s and Boeing 720s in the late 1960s. Braniff&#x27;s April 1969 timetable lists nonstop 707 service to Hawaii; however, Braniff flights from Houston to Hawaii didn&#x27;t actually start until September 1, after the move to IAH. (Hobby&#x27;s 7600-ft runways would have been too short for 707 nonstop service to Hawaii.)

Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH), now George Bush Intercontinental Airport, opened in June 1969; the airlines moved to Intercontinental and Hobby was left with no scheduled passenger service. The Civil Aeronautics Administration recommended years earlier that Houston plan to replace Hobby.

====International service in the 1960s====
Previously, KLM and Pan American World Airways (Pan Am) operated international flights from the International Building at Hobby until the late 1960s. In 1966, Pan Am was operating a daily Boeing 707 flight nonstop to Mexico City with continuing, no change of plane service to Guatemala City, Guatemala; San Salvador, El Salvador; Managua, Nicaragua; San José, Costa Rica and Panama City, Panama. In 1969, both airlines moved to IAH and the International Building was demolished. Braniff International operated international service as well from the airport and in the spring of 1966 was operating nonstop Boeing 707 and Boeing 720 jet service twice a week to Panama City, Panama with connections in Panama to other Braniff flights to South America. Also in 1966, Braniff was operating a joint international service via an agreement with Pan Am to London, England and Frankfurt, Germany on a daily basis with Boeing 707 jetliners via intermediate stops at Dallas Love Field and Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport. Aeronaves de Mexico (now Aeromexico) served Hobby as well with flights to Mexico and in the spring of 1968 was operating Douglas DC-9-10 jet service nonstop to Monterrey with continuing, no change of plane service several days a week to Guadalajara and Acapulco. Trans-Texas Airways also served Mexico and in 1968 was operating direct, no change of plane service from Hobby with Convair 600 turboprops eleven times a week to Monterrey and six times a week to Tampico and Veracruz via south Texas.

===Resumption of airline service===

The first airline to resume passenger flights was Houston Metro Airlines, a commuter airline, which in early 1970 was flying &quot;cross town&quot; service with de Havilland Canada DHC-6 Twin Otters between Hobby and Houston Intercontinental Airport (IAH) with 14 weekday round trips.

Jet airline service resumed on November 14, 1971, when Southwest Airlines operating as an intrastate airline began nonstop Boeing 737-200s to Dallas Love Field (DAL) and San Antonio (Southwest had initially launched service between Intercontinental Airport and Dallas Love Field before serving Hobby). Both Braniff International and Texas International resumed jet service into Hobby with nonstops to Dallas in competition with Southwest.

By fall 1979, Braniff and Texas International had ceased serving Hobby, however, two other jet airlines, Hughes Airwest and Ozark Air Lines, had joined Southwest at the airport, with Southwest operating Boeing 727-200s as well as 737-200s nonstop to Austin, Corpus Christi, Dallas Love Field, Harlingen, Lubbock, San Antonio and its first destination outside Texas, New Orleans. Hughes Airwest (owned by Howard Hughes) was flying nonstop to Las Vegas, Phoenix and Tucson and direct to Burbank (now Bob Hope Airport) and Orange County (now John Wayne Airport) while Ozark was flying nonstop to its hub in St. Louis; both airlines flew McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. Hughes Airwest was acquired by and merged into Republic Airlines which in 1983 had a focus city operation at Hobby with McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s, DC-9-50s and MD-80s nonstop to Chicago O&#x27;Hare Airport (ORD), Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), Detroit, Las Vegas, Memphis, New Orleans and Phoenix. By 1984, another airline flew nonstop Hobby to St. Louis: Air 1 Boeing 727-100s. A number of commuter airlines were flying from Hobby to smaller cities in Texas and Louisiana, including Chaparral Airlines, Commutair, Eagle Commuter, Hammonds Air Service, Metroplex Airlines and Tejas Airlines.

In 1987, Continental Airlines had a &quot;dual hub&quot; operation in Houston with a hub at Intercontinental Airport (IAH) and a second hub at Hobby. In February 1987, Continental had nonstops from Hobby to Austin, Denver, Las Vegas, Los Angeles, Miami, New Orleans, New York LaGuardia Airport, San Antonio and Washington D.C. National Airport. Nonstop &quot;cross town&quot; shuttle service was also being flown between HOU and IAH with Douglas DC-9-10s by Emerald Air operating as the &quot;Houston Proud Express&quot; or Continental with these flights using &quot;CO&quot; flight numbers with seven round trips a day. CO one-stops flew from Hobby to Bozeman, MT, Orlando, Sacramento and Tucson. Continental was operating up to 37 departures a day from HOU with Boeing 727-100s, 727-200s, 737-200s, 737-300s, Douglas DC-9-10s and McDonnell Douglas DC-9-30s. The airline shut down its hub at Hobby and was not serving the airport by the early 1990s although its regional affiliate Continental Express would return with &quot;cross town&quot; turboprop flights to IAH by the mid 1990s followed later by limited Continental mainline jet service. Also in 1987, Pan Am was once again serving Hobby with daily nonstop Boeing 727-200 and Boeing 737-200 service from the airport to Miami, New York JFK Airport and Washington Dulles Airport with the flight to New York continuing on a direct one stop, no change of plane basis to Bermuda.

In the fall of 1991, the OAG listed main line flights to Hobby on American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Northwest Airlines, Trans World Airlines (TWA) and United Airlines in addition to Southwest. Other airlines jets at Hobby in the 1980s included Air Florida, Braniff, Eastern Air Lines, Emerald Air (operating independently and also on behalf of Continental Airlines as the aforementioned &quot;Houston Proud Express&quot; with DC-9s between HOU and IAH), the original Frontier Airlines, Muse Air, People Express, Republic Airlines and TranStar Airlines. Alaska Airlines also served Hobby in 1990 via an interchange agreement with American Airlines which enabled direct Boeing 727-200s to Anchorage and Fairbanks via Dallas/Ft. Worth and Seattle. At one point, Continental Airlines was operating Boeing 737-300s between Hobby and Houston Intercontinental and flying nonstop HOU to its Newark hub. In 2008 the airport handled 8.8 million passengers. Only domestic US destinations and international destinations with border preclearance were being served, but in fall 2015 Southwest opened a new international terminal allowing it to fly to foreign cities.

The headquarters for TranStar Airlines (formerly Muse Air before this new start up air carrier was acquired by Southwest Airlines) were at the airport. Muse Air followed by TranStar operated a hub at Hobby flying McDonnell Douglas MD-80s, DC-9-50s and DC-9-30s nonstop to Austin, Brownsville, TX, Dallas Love Field, Las Vegas, Los Angeles (LAX), Lubbock, Ontario, CA, McAllen, TX, Miami, Midland/Odessa, New Orleans, Orlando, San Antonio, San Francisco, Tampa and Tulsa with direct service to San Diego and San Jose, CA at various times during the 1980s. Several other airlines were based at the airport in the past as well, including Pioneer Air Lines and Trans-Texas Airways (&quot;TTa&quot;) with the latter then changing its name to Texas International Airlines. Trans-Texas followed by Texas International operated a hub at the airport as well. Pioneer and Texas International merged with Continental Airlines, Pioneer in 1955 and Texas International in 1982. Continental continued to use the former Texas International maintenance base at Hobby after the merger.

===21st century===

In May 2011, Southwest Airlines expressed interest in initiating new international flights from Hobby.

On April 9, 2012, Houston Director of Aviation Mario Diaz announced support of international flights from Hobby after multiple studies of the economic impact on the entire city of Houston. On this day Southwest Airlines also debuted its new campaign, called Free Hobby. Supporters are asked to sign a petition. Southwest also started a website just for supporters of international flights from Hobby, freehobbyairport.com.

United Airlines, Houston&#x27;s other major carrier, which would later be forced to compete with Southwest on proposed international routes, has objected to the expansion plans, citing a study which concludes that the change would cost the Houston area jobs and result in a net reduction in GRP.

Houston Mayor Annise Parker backed Southwest&#x27;s fight to make Hobby an international airport on May 23, 2012. On May 30, 2012, Houston&#x27;s city council approved Southwest&#x27;s request for international flights from Hobby.
The groundbreaking of the terminal expansion began in September 2013. Five new gates (two arrival/departure gates and three arrival only gates) were added to accommodate both Boeing 737 and Airbus A320 family aircraft. The expansion was estimated to have cost $156 million and was paid for by Southwest Airlines. The expansion also included constructing a new parking garage as well as a re-organization and expansion of the security checkpoint and Southwest Airlines&#x27; check-in counter. Vertical construction was officially completed on October 15, 2015, and Southwest launched international flights that same day.

Frontier Airlines announced its entry to the airport with direct flights to Cancun, Las Vegas, and Orlando starting in May 2022. Just two months later Frontier Airlines announced a fourth flight from Hobby with a new Denver route starting in September. 

==Facilities==
===Terminal===
William P. Hobby Airport has a single terminal with two concourses (one domestic and one international) and 30 overall gates. The domestic concourse, which has various retail shops and restaurants, opened in 2003 and replaced the original three concourses, which dated back to the 1950s. It also includes an interfaith chapel. The international concourse opened on October 15, 2015.

In February 2020, Hobby Airport became the first airport in Texas to have full biometric entry and exit for passengers who are traveling internationally.

In March 2022, Southwest announced a $250 million expansion project to add seven gates to Hobby&#x27;s west concourse. The city of Houston is contributing $20 million toward the project. Six of the gates will be used exclusively by Southwest for domestic flights. The seventh new gate will be available for use by other airlines at the discretion of the Houston Airport System. The project is expected to take five years.

===Ground transportation===
The Metropolitan Transit Authority of Harris County, Texas, or METRO, stops at Curb Zone 3 at the airport. Currently, there are four bus lines that serve Hobby Airport. 40 Telephone/Heights provides local service to Eastwood Transit Center, Downtown, and North Shepard Park and Ride. 50 Broadway also provides service between the airport and Eastwood Transit Center via the Magnolia Park Transit Center. 73 Bellfort, which runs up to a 12 minute frequency during weekday, runs between the airport and Fannin South Transit Center, connecting to the Metro Rail Red Line. 88 Sagemont runs between the airport and San Jacinto College South Campus. 

Courtesy vans are operated by various hotels and motels in and around the Houston area. There are courtesy telephones in the baggage claim areas to request pickup for most hotels and motels.

Shared-ride shuttle service was available at HOU until 2019 when SuperShuttle (now Transdev) ceased business, citing competition from ride-sharing services Uber and Lyft. Additionally, regularly scheduled bus and shuttle service is provided by various carriers to locations from HOU to areas outside metropolitan Houston and to Galveston and College Station. These services can be found in the baggage claim area.

Taxis are available at Curb Zone 2.
Lyft and Uber are available at Curb Zone 5.

===Other===
There are several artistic pieces located in and on the William P. Hobby Airport grounds. 
Artists Paul Kittleson and Carter Ernst created &quot;Take-off,&quot; a stainless steel bird&#x27;s nest showing interwoven branches created using industrial materials. The nest is wide and is held above the ground by three steel tree trunks. The nest is depicted floating above a subtropical garden. The artists created the work to depict the spirit of Houston&#x27;s industrial force along the coastal plain. &quot;Take-off&quot; is located at Hobby&#x27;s Broadway Street entrance.

The Houston Air Route Traffic Control Center serves as the airport&#x27;s ARTCC.

<doc id="248474" wikidata="Q1007509" url="?curid=248474" title="Greater Napanee">
<text>Greater Napanee is a town in southeastern Ontario, Canada, approximately west of Kingston and the county seat of Lennox and Addington County. It is located on the eastern end of the Bay of Quinte. Greater Napanee municipality was created by amalgamating the old Town of Napanee with the townships of Adolphustown, North and South Fredericksburg, and Richmond in 1999. Greater Napanee is co-extensive with the original Lennox County.

The town is home to the Allan Macpherson House, a historic 1826 property that is now a museum. Macpherson was a major in the Lennox militia, operated the town&#x27;s grist and saw mills, as well as the distillery and general store. He served as post master and land agent, operated the first local printing press and helped fund the establishment of many local schools and churches. The home sits on the banks of the Napanee River, which runs through the town.

The largest employer is a Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company passenger car tire plant (opened in 1988).

The main streets are Dundas Street (east–west) and Centre Street (north–south). Dundas Street is part of former provincial Highway #2, also known as Kingston Road, and travels through downtown from Toronto in the west and onward to Kingston in the east. Centre Street travels through the centre of the town from the modern commercial area close to Highway 401 to the downtown and onwards, as County Road 8 to Lake Ontario.

==History==
The first recorded settlement in the area of Greater Napanee is Ganneious, an Iroquois village, settled temporarily by the Oneida from approximately 1660 to 1690. The village was located on or near the Hay Bay area and is one of seven Iroquois villages settled on the northern shores of Lake Ontario in the 17th century. The exact location of the village has not been determined. 
The area was settled by Loyalists in 1784 and Napanee was first incorporated in 1854. The first Loyalists settlers arrived at Adolphustown on June 15, 1784. Their landing spot and site of the first Loyalist cemetery in the area has been preserved by the Loyalists.

The town developed at the site of a waterfall, the head of navigation, on the Napanee River where early industry could utilize the power potential of the river. The river transported logs from the interior north of the town. Sawmilling, gristmilling and other farm service industries were established. Napanee was first known as Clarksville after Robert Clark, who built a grist mill there.

Sir John A. Macdonald, Canada&#x27;s first prime minister, practised law in Napanee.

<text>Christopher Urswick (1448–1522) was a priest and confessor of Margaret Beaufort. He was Rector of Puttenham, Hertfordshire, and later Dean of Windsor. Urswick is thought to have acted as a go-between in the plotting to place her son Henry VII of England on the throne.

==Early life and education==
Urswick was born at Furness in 1448. His father, John Urswick, and his mother were lay brother and sister of Furness Abbey.

He was educated at Lancaster Royal Grammar School (which was then called &#x27;The Free School at Lancaster&#x27;)

==Career==
He was Archdeacon of Wilts (1488–1522), Archdeacon of Richmond (1494–1500) and Archdeacon of Norfolk (1500–1522). Circa 1486 he was given the prebend of Chiswick in St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. He was also Dean of York from 1488 to 1494, a Canon of St George&#x27;s Chapel, Windsor from 1492 to 1496 and then Dean of Windsor from 1495 to 1505. He was the Lord Almoner from 1485 to 1495.

He declined the position of Bishop of Norwich in 1498 and was collated Archdeacon of Oxford in 1504.

Amongst his more important positions, Urswick became Rector of the Parish of Hackney in 1502, where he ordered the medieval parish church to be rebuilt. St Augustine&#x27;s Tower is the only remnant. 

==Death==
Urswick died on 24 March 1522 in Hackney (parish) and was buried in St Augustine&#x27;s Church, Hackney.

==Commemoration== 
He appears as a minor character in Shakespeare&#x27;s Richard III.

He built a parish house in Hackney (Urswick House, now demolished), where he lived for a time. He is commemorated in Urswick Road in nearby Homerton. 

He founded The Urswick School for 12 poor boys, which was until recently called Hackney Free and Parochial School in Hackney Central. The Urswick Chantry in St. George&#x27;s Chapel commemorates him.

<text>James Gordon MacArthur (December 8, 1937 – October 28, 2010) was an American actor and recording artist.

He had a long career in both movies and television, and his early work was predominantly in supporting roles in films. Later, he had a starring role as Danny &quot;Danno&quot; Williams in the long-running television series &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

In 1963, his spoken-word recording &quot;The Ten Commandments of Love&quot; charted on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100, peaking at number 94.

==Early life==

MacArthur was born in Los Angeles, and was adopted by playwright Charles MacArthur and his wife, actress Helen Hayes. He was raised in Nyack, New York along with his elder sister, the MacArthurs&#x27; biological daughter Mary, who died of polio in 1949. He was educated at Allen-Stevenson School in New York and later at the Solebury School in New Hope, Pennsylvania, where he starred in basketball, football and baseball. 

In his final year at Solebury, MacArthur played guard on the football team, captained the basketball team, rewrote the school&#x27;s constitution, edited the school paper, played Scrooge in a local presentation of &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot; and was president of his class, the student government and the drama club. He also dated fellow student and future actress Joyce Bulifant, whom he married in November 1958 and divorced nine years later. 

MacArthur was raised among people of literary and theatrical talent. Lillian Gish was his godmother, and his family&#x27;s guests included John Steinbeck, John Barrymore, Harpo Marx, Ben Hecht, Beatrice Lillie and the humorist Robert Benchley.

== Acting career ==
=== Early career ===
MacArthur&#x27;s first radio role was on the &quot;Theatre Guild on the Air&quot; in 1948, accompanying his mother Helen Hayes.

MacArthur made his stage debut in Olney, Maryland in 1949 with a two-week stint in &quot;The Corn Is Green&quot;. His sister Mary, who was also in the play, had requested that he join the company. The following summer, he repeated the role in Dennis, Massachusetts and his theatrical career was under way.

In 1954, he played John Day in &quot;Life with Father&quot; with Howard Lindsay and Dorothy Stickney. He became involved in important Broadway productions only after receiving his training in summer-stock theater. He worked as a set painter, lighting director and chief of the parking lot. During a Helen Hayes festival at the Falmouth Playhouse on Cape Cod, he had a few walk-on parts. He also helped the theater&#x27;s electrician and became so interested that he was allowed to remain after his mother&#x27;s plays had ended. As a result, he lit the show for Barbara Bel Geddes in &quot;The Little Hut&quot; and for Gloria Vanderbilt in &quot;The Swan&quot;.

=== Television ===
In 1955, at the age of 18, MacArthur played Hal Ditmar in the television play &#x27;&quot;Deal a Blow&quot;, an episode of the series &quot;Climax!&quot; directed by John Frankenheimer and starring Macdonald Carey, Phyllis Thaxter and Edward Arnold. The critical response was excellent, with the &quot;New York Times&quot; saying that he &quot;performed splendidly.&quot;

The following year, Frankenheimer directed the film version of the play, which was renamed &quot;The Young Stranger&quot; (1957), with MacArthur again in the starring role. His performance was again critically acclaimed, earning him a nomination for Most Promising Newcomer at the 1958 BAFTA awards.

In late 1956, it was announced that MacArthur would make &quot;Underdog&quot;, based on a novel by W. R. Burnett, along with his mother and Susan Strasberg, but the project never materialized.

MacArthur returned to television to appear in &quot;World in White&quot; (1957) and episodes of &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Studio One in Hollywood&quot; and &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot;.

===Disney===
MacArthur was selected by Walt Disney to star in &quot;The Light in the Forest&quot; (1958), playing a white man raised by Indians. In April 1957, he signed a three-picture deal with Disney. For &quot;Light in the Forest&quot; he was paid $2,500 per week, which increased to $3,000 per week for the second film and $3,500 for the third. However, MacArthur was only available to work during his summer vacation from Harvard, where he was studying history.

Disney executives liked his performance and cast him in &quot;Third Man on the Mountain&quot; (1959), playing a young man who climbs the Matterhorn. His mother had a cameo role.

Deciding to make acting his full-time career, he left Harvard in his second year to appear in two more Disney movies, &quot;Kidnapped&quot; (1960) and &quot;Swiss Family Robinson&quot; (1960). He was named a possibility for &quot;Bon Voyage&quot; (1962) but did not appear in the film.

MacArthur made his Broadway debut in 1960 playing opposite Jane Fonda in &quot;Invitation to a March&quot;, for which he received a Theatre World Award. Although he never returned to Broadway, he remained active in theater throughout his career, appearing in such productions as &quot;Under the Yum Yum Tree&quot;, &quot;The Moon Is Blue&quot;, &quot;John Loves Mary&quot; (with his wife Joyce Bulifant), &quot;Barefoot in the Park&quot; and &quot;Murder at the Howard Johnson&#x27;s&quot;.

He also released several records in the early 1960s, scoring two minor hits with &quot;(The Story of) The In-Between Years&quot; and &quot;The Ten Commandments of Love&quot;, which peaked at number 94 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1963.

MacArthur delivered a chilling performance as baby-faced opium dealer Johnny Lubin in &quot;The Untouchables&quot; episode &quot;Death For Sale&quot;. He also appeared in episodes of the television shows &quot;Bus Stop&quot; and &quot;Wagon Train&quot;. He returned to feature films as one of several young actors in &quot;The Interns&quot; (1962), Columbia&#x27;s popular medical drama.

He appeared in episodes of &quot;The Dick Powell Theatre&quot;, &quot;Sam Benedict&quot; and &quot;Arrest and Trial&quot;, then made &quot;Spencer&#x27;s Mountain&quot; (1963) at Warner Bros. with Henry Fonda and &quot;Cry of Battle&quot; (1963) in the Philippines.

In 1963, MacArthur was nominated for the Top New Male Personality category of the Golden Laurel Awards. That year, he starred in and produced a pilot for a television series about a writer, &quot;Postmark: Jim Fletcher&quot;, but it was not sold.

He guest-starred on the television shows &quot;Burke&#x27;s Law&quot;, &quot;The Eleventh Hour&quot; and &quot;The Great Adventure&quot;, &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot; before appearing in the feature films &quot;The Truth About Spring&quot; and &quot;The Bedford Incident&quot;, both in 1965.

In &quot;Battle of the Bulge&quot; (1965), MacArthur again played the role of a young and inexperienced officer. He appeared in &quot;Ride Beyond Vengeance&quot; (1966) and guest-starred on &quot;Branded&quot;, &quot;Combat!&quot;, &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;, &quot;Hondo&quot;, &quot;Insight&quot;, &quot;Death Valley Days&quot;, &quot;Bonanza&quot;, &quot;The Virginian&quot;, &quot;Twelve O&#x27;Clock High&quot; and &quot;Tarzan&quot;.

MacArthur returned to Disney to appear in &quot;Willie and the Yank&quot; (1967) for television, released theatrically as &quot;Mosby&#x27;s Marauders&quot;. He also had a role in &quot;The Love-Ins&quot; (1967) for Sam Katzman and a brief but memorable appearance in the Clint Eastwood film &quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; (1968) as a preacher.

===&quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;===
&quot;Hang &#x27;Em High&quot; was written by Leonard Freeman, who was producing a new police procedural, &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;. Tim O&#x27;Kelly was originally cast as Jack Lord&#x27;s assistant, but test audiences felt that he was too young, so MacArthur was offered the role. MacArthur said that Lord &quot;said &#x27;book him&#x27; to others in the cast, but I guess he said it to me the most. It wasn&#x27;t anything we really thought about at first. But the phrase just took off and caught the public&#x27;s imagination.&quot;

Appearing in the show made MacArthur wealthy, and he invested much of his earnings in Hawaiian real estate.

MacArthur left the show in 1979, feeling that it had become bland and predictable. It was canceled one year later. He later reflected: &quot;It was just time. I called the producer from South America and told him I was heading down the Amazon River.&quot;

William Smith, who replaced him on the show, claimed that MacArthur quit &quot;because Jack Lord wouldn&#x27;t let him have a dressing room. He had to change in the prop truck for eleven years.&quot;

===After &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;===
After leaving &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, McArthur guest-starred on television shows such as &quot;Time Express,&quot; &quot;Murder, She Wrote,&quot; &quot;The Love Boat,&quot; &quot;Fantasy Island,&quot; &quot;Walking Tall&quot;, &quot;The Littlest Hobo&quot;,&quot;Vega$&quot; and &quot;Superboy&quot;. He also appeared in the miniseries &quot;&quot; (1980) and &quot;The Night the Bridge Fell Down&quot; (1983). He returned to the stage, appearing in &quot;A Bedfull of Foreigners&quot; in Chicago in 1984 and in Michigan in 1985. He followed this with &quot;The Hasty Heart&quot; before taking a year out of showbusiness.

In 1987, he again took to the stage in &quot;The Foreigner&quot;, and then played Mortimer in the national tour of &quot;Arsenic and Old Lace&quot;. In 1989, he followed another stint in &quot;The Foreigner&quot; with &quot;Love Letters&quot; and in 1990–1991, &quot;A Bedfull of Foreigners&quot; in Las Vegas.

===Semi-retirement===
From 1959 to 1960, MacArthur partnered with actors James Franciscus and Alan Ladd, Jr. in the ownership of a Beverly Hills telephone-answering service. In June 1972, he directed the Honolulu Community Theatre in a production of his father&#x27;s play &quot;The Front Page&quot;.

He appeared at conventions, collectors&#x27; shows and celebrity sporting events. A keen golfer, he won the 2002 Frank Sinatra Celebrity Invitational Golf Tournament.

MacArthur also appeared in television and radio specials and on interview programs such as &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot;, &quot;Christopher&#x27;s Closeup&quot; and the BBC Radio 5 Live obituary program &quot;Brief Lives&quot;, in which he paid tribute to his &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; castmate Kam Fong. In 1997, MacArthur returned without Jack Lord (who was in declining health) to reprise his character, who had become Hawaii&#x27;s governor, in the 1997 unaired reboot pilot of &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;.

In April 2003, he traveled to Honolulu&#x27;s historic Hawaii Theatre for a cameo role in Joe Moore&#x27;s play &quot;Dirty Laundry&quot;. Negotiations were under way in Summer 2010 for MacArthur to make a cameo appearance in the new CBS primetime remake of &quot;Hawaii Five-0&quot; at the time of his death, a role that eventually was offered to Al Harrington. Before the start of the November 1, 2010, episode, MacArthur&#x27;s death was mentioned in a short tribute.

In 2001, a Golden Palm Star on the Palm Springs Walk of Stars was dedicated to MacArthur.

==Personal life and death==
From 1958 to 1968 he was married to Joyce Bulifant.
At the time of his death, MacArthur was married to former LPGA golfer Helen Beth Duntz. MacArthur had two daughters and two sons.

MacArthur died on October 28, 2010, at the age of 72 of unspecified causes in Florida.

<doc id="248480" wikidata="Q459096" url="?curid=248480" title="Dallas Fort Worth International Airport">
<text>Dallas Fort Worth International Airport is the primary international airport serving the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex and the North Texas region, in the U.S. state of Texas.

It is the largest hub for American Airlines, which is headquartered near the airport, and is the third-busiest airport in the world by aircraft movements and the second-busiest airport in the world by passenger traffic in 2022 and 2023, according to the Airports Council International. As of 2021, it is the sixth-busiest international gateway in the United States and the second-busiest international gateway in Texas (behind Houston-IAH). The hub American Airlines operates at DFW is the second-largest single airline hub in the world and the United States, behind Delta Air Lines″s hub in Atlanta.

Located roughly halfway between the major cities of Dallas and Fort Worth, DFW spreads across portions of Dallas and Tarrant counties and includes portions of the cities of Grapevine, Irving, Euless, and Coppell. At , DFW is the second-largest airport by land area in the United States after Denver International Airport covering an area larger than Manhattan in New York City. It has its own post office ZIP Code, 75261, and United States Postal Service city designation (&quot;DFW Airport, TX&quot;), as well as its own police, fire protection, and emergency medical services.

DFW Airport has service to 254 destinations (191 domestic, 63 international) from 28 passenger airlines. As of April 2023, DFW Airport has service to more nonstop destinations than any other airport in North America. Every major city in the Contiguous United States can be flown to in four hours or less. It is also the largest carbon neutral airport in the world and the first in North America to achieve this status.

==History==

===Planning===
As early as 1927, before the area had an airport, Dallas proposed a joint airport with Fort Worth. Fort Worth declined the offer and thus each city opened its own airport, Love Field in Dallas and Meacham Field in Fort Worth, each of which had scheduled airline service.

In 1940, the Civil Aeronautics Administration earmarked for the construction of a Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport. American Airlines and Braniff Airways struck a deal with the city of Arlington to build an airport there, but the governments of Dallas and Fort Worth disagreed over its construction and the project was abandoned in 1942. After World War II, Fort Worth annexed the site and developed it into Amon Carter Field with the help of American Airlines. In 1953, Fort Worth transferred its commercial flights from Meacham to the new airport, which was from Love Field. In 1960, Fort Worth purchased Amon Carter Field and renamed it Greater Southwest International Airport (GSW) in an attempt to compete with Dallas&#x27; airport, but GSW&#x27;s traffic continued to decline relative to Love Field. By the mid-1960s, Fort Worth was getting 1% of Texas air traffic while Dallas was getting 49%, which led to the virtual abandonment of GSW.

The joint airport proposal was revisited in 1961 after the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) refused to invest more money into separate Dallas and Fort Worth airports. While airline service had steeply declined at both GSW and Meacham, Love Field was congested and had no more room to expand. Following an order from the federal government in 1964 that it would unilaterally choose a site if the cities could not come to an agreement, officials from the two cities finally agreed on a location for a new regional airport that was just north of the near-abandoned GSW and almost equidistant from the two city centers. The land was purchased by the cities in 1966 and construction began in 1969. The cost of the first phase of Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport was estimated at $700 million.

Voters went to the polls in cities throughout the Dallas–Fort Worth metroplex to approve the new North Texas Regional Airport, which was named after the North Texas Commission that was instrumental in the regional airport coming to fruition. The North Texas Commission formed the North Texas Airport Commission to oversee the planning and construction of the giant airport. Area voters approved the airport referendum and the new North Texas Regional Airport would become a reality. However, many Dallas residents remained satisfied with Love Field, and an attempt to establish an independent Dallas Fort Worth Regional Airport Authority—despite strong backing from the Dallas Chamber of Commerce and Dallas mayor J. Erik Jonsson—failed when Dallas voters rejected the proposal by a narrow margin. After further negotiation, the cities instead established an appointed airport board consisting of seven members from Dallas and four from Fort Worth and were able to persuade all existing air carriers at Love, GSW, and Meacham to move to the new regional airport.

Under the original 1967 airport design, DFW was to have pier-shaped terminals perpendicular to a central highway. In 1968, the design was revised to provide for semicircular terminals, which served to isolate loading and unloading areas from the central highway, and to provide additional room for parking in the middle of each semicircle. The plan proposed thirteen such terminals, but only four were built initially.

===Opening and operations===
DFW held an open house and dedication ceremony on September 20–23, 1973, which included the first landing of a supersonic Concorde in the United States, an Air France aircraft en route from Caracas to Paris. The attendees at the airport&#x27;s dedication included former Texas Governor John Connally, Transportation Secretary Claude Brinegar, U.S. Senator Lloyd Bentsen and Texas Governor Dolph Briscoe. The airport opened for commercial service as Dallas/Fort Worth Regional Airport on January 13, 1974, at a cost of $875 million (equivalent to $5.5 billion in 2024), which included $65 million for the land and $810 million in total construction costs. At the time of DFW&#x27;s opening, at , it was the largest airport in the world ever constructed in terms of land area (surpassed in October 1975 with the opening of Montréal-Mirabel International Airport). The first flight to land was American Airlines Flight 341 from New York, which had stopped in Memphis and Little Rock. The surrounding cities began to annex the airport property into their city limits shortly after the airport was developed. The name change to Dallas/Fort Worth International did not occur until 1985.

An innovative feature of the airport during its early history was the Vought Airtrans, the world&#x27;s first operational fully automated people mover system. Later rebranded as the &quot;Airport Train&quot; and then the &quot;TrAAin&quot; (&quot;AA&quot; signifying American Airlines), the system ultimately encompassed of fixed guideways and transported as many as 23,000 persons per day at a maximum speed of .

When it opened, DFW had four terminals, numbered 2W, 2E, 3E and 4E. During its first year of operations, the airport was served by American Airlines, Braniff International Airways, Continental Airlines, Delta Air Lines, Eastern Air Lines, Frontier Airlines, Ozark Air Lines, Rio Airways and Texas International Airlines.

Southwest Airlines had not begun flights when the other airlines agreed to move from Love Field to DFW, and it had only received approval to fly within the state of Texas. It refused to move to DFW because it felt that convenience for Dallas residents was central to its business. After the Airline Deregulation Act was enacted in 1978, Southwest announced flights to other states. Local officials feared that the resumption of long-distance flights at Love would threaten DFW&#x27;s financial stability, prompting the enaction of the Wright Amendment in 1979, which banned airliners with more than 56 seats from operating between Love Field and airports beyond Texas and its four neighboring states: Arkansas, Louisiana, New Mexico, and Oklahoma.

Braniff International Airways was a major operator at DFW in the airport&#x27;s early years, operating a hub from Terminal 2W with international flights to South America and Mexico from 1974, London from 1978, and Europe and Asia from 1979, as well as extensive domestic service before ceasing all operations in 1982. During the Braniff hub era, DFW was one of only four U.S. airports to have scheduled Concorde service; Braniff commenced scheduled Concorde service from Dallas to Washington from 1979 to 1980, using British Airways and Air France aircraft temporarily re-registered to Braniff while flying within the United States. British Airways later briefly flew Concordes to Dallas in 1988 as a substitute for its ordinarily scheduled DC-10 service.

Following airline deregulation, American Airlines (which had already been one of the largest carriers serving the Dallas/Fort Worth area for many years) established its first hub at DFW on June 11, 1981. American finished moving its headquarters from Grand Prairie, Texas, to a building in Fort Worth located on the site of the old Greater Southwest International Airport, near DFW Airport on January 17, 1983; the airline began leasing the facility from the airport, which owns the facility. By 1984, the American hub occupied most of Terminal 3E and part of Terminal 2E. American&#x27;s hub grew to fill all of Terminal 2E by 1991. American also began long-haul international service from DFW, adding flights to London in 1982 and Tokyo in 1987.

Delta Air Lines also built up a hub operation at DFW, which occupied most of Terminal 4E through the 1990s. The Delta hub peaked around 1991, when Delta had a 35% market share at DFW; its share was halved by 2004, after many of its mainline routes were downgraded to more frequent regional jet service in 2003. Delta constructed a satellite terminal in Terminal E in 1988 to accommodate their hub, which was permanently reopened in May 2019 for American Eagle operations. Delta closed its DFW hub in 2004 in a restructuring of the airline to avoid bankruptcy, cutting its DFW operation to only 21 flights a day from over 250 and redeploying aircraft to hubs in Cincinnati, Atlanta and Salt Lake City. Prior to the closure, Delta had a 17.3% market share at DFW.

In 1989 the airport authority announced plans to rebuild the existing terminals and add two runways. After an environmental impact study was released the following year, the cities of Irving, Euless and Grapevine sued the airport over its extension plans, and the legal battle continued until the US Supreme Court ruled in favor of the airport in 1994. The seventh runway opened in 1996. The four primary north–south runways (those closest to the terminals) were all lengthened from to their present length of . The first, 17R/35L, was extended in 1996 (at the same time the new runway was constructed) and the other three (17C/35C, 18L/36R, and 18R/36L) were extended in 2005. DFW is now the only airport in the world with four serviceable paved runways longer than .

Terminal D, built for international flights, and DFW Skylink, a modern bidirectional people mover system, opened in 2005. The remaining Airport Train system, which had been mostly replaced by buses in 2003, had been fully decommissioned weeks earlier. The largest commercial aircraft in the world, the Airbus A380, made its inaugural arrival at DFW in September 2014 and was handled at Terminal D.

From 2004 to 2012, DFW was one of two US Army &quot;Personnel Assistance Points&quot; that received US troops returning from wars in Iraq and Afghanistan for rest and recuperation. This ended on March 14, 2012, leaving Hartsfield–Jackson Atlanta International Airport as the sole Personnel Assistance Point.

In the late 20th century, the Wright Amendment had become unpopular with travelers and business groups because it suppressed local airline competition, but it was backed by powerful political interests including American Airlines, which did not want direct low-fare competition from Southwest Airlines at its DFW fortress hub. Efforts to revise the amendment in the 1980s and early 1990s became mired in lawsuits and political wrangling. In a 2023 statement to &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, former American Airlines chief executive officer Robert Crandall said that at the time, a Wright repeal was a greater threat to American Airlines than to DFW Airport.

The Wright Amendment status quo was upset between 1996 and 2000, when laws were passed adding new states to the Wright service area, and several airlines began long-distance service from Love Field under the previously unexploited 56-seat exemption. This broke Southwest&#x27;s monopoly at Love Field, threatened highly profitable American Airlines routes at DFW, and proved that changes to the amendment were now politically viable. Southwest soon began campaigning to repeal the Wright Amendment, but was staunchly opposed by American Airlines, which feared that Southwest would maintain its near-monopoly at Love Field while simultaneously expanding to DFW Airport and possibly Fort Worth Alliance Airport or Meacham Airport.

In a 2006 agreement brokered by Kay Bailey Hutchison, U.S. Senator from Texas, DFW Airport, Dallas, Fort Worth, Southwest, and American agreed to mutually support the repeal, but with a number of conditions. The agreement permanently capped the number of gates at Love Field and gave American and Southwest preferential leases to the remaining gates. Until 2025, international passenger flights in the metroplex were required to operate from DFW Airport, and Southwest was required to surrender Love Field gates if it or any codeshare agreement partners offered flights from DFW or another airport in the metroplex.

On October 13, 2014, the Wright Amendment domestic flight restrictions ended, allowing airlines to fly from Love Field to anywhere in the U.S. Despite the increased local competition, the number of annual enplanements at DFW grew by five million from 2013 to 2015, only slightly less than an approximately six million passenger increase at Love Field during the same period.

Airports Council International (ACI) named DFW Airport the best large airport with more than 40 million passengers in North America for passenger satisfaction in 2016.

In June 2018, DFW Airport opened a fully functioning, free standing emergency room on airport grounds, located in Southgate Plaza near the Airport Headquarters and Rental Car Center. With this opening, the facility became the first actual ER on an airport&#x27;s property anywhere around the globe.

DFW Airport tentatively completed a $2.7 billion &quot;Terminal Renewal and Improvement Program&quot; (TRIP), which encompassed renovations of three of the original four terminals (A, B, and E). Work on the project began following the conclusion of Super Bowl XLV in February 2011. Terminal A was the first terminal to undergo these renovations, which were completed in January 2017 at a cost of about $1 billion. This was followed by the completion of Terminal E in August 2017 and Terminal B in December 2017. While Terminal C was originally part of the multibillion-dollar renovations, American Airlines in 2014 asked to delay renovations of the terminal.

In early 2023, Frontier Airlines established a crew operating base at DFW and added a gate to accommodate additional flights.

In 2023, DFW served 81,764,044 passengers, a record for the facility, exceeding 80 million passengers for the first time in the airport&#x27;s 50-year history.

===Future===
DFW Airport has embarked on a series of expansion projects expected to last until 2028.

The first phase will construct the long-discussed Terminal F, albeit significantly downsized from earlier plans. The 15-gate concourse will cost $1.63 billion and will be built between 2024 and 2026. Previous plans for Terminal F called for 24 gates at a cost of $3.5 billion. Terminal F will have no landside facilities. Passenger and baggage screening and services will be handled in a new expansion of Terminal E, with passengers boarding Skylink to reach Terminal F, and baggage travelling in a tunnel under International Parkway. Terminal F will be built in a way that it could be expanded to 22 gates in the future.

The second phase of the project will include the delayed renovations of Terminal C, adding piers to with additional gates to terminals A and C, and upgrading roadways. The $2.72 billion project will add nine additional gates and will be completed in phases by 2028.

==Composition and facilities==
Of the portions of the airport, fewer than reside in Grapevine, fewer than are in Irving, over are in Euless, and are in Coppell.

===Terminals===
Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport has five terminals and 174 gates; these terminals are in the City of Grapevine. DFW&#x27;s terminals are designed in a half-circle shape, which minimizes the distance between a passenger&#x27;s car and airplane, and to reduce traffic on main airport roads. The DFW Skylink automated people mover system allows passengers to quickly travel between gates inside the secured area of the airport, with an average travel time of seven minutes.

Terminal D is the airport&#x27;s primary international terminal, with CBP (Customs and Border Protection) facilities to process arriving international passengers and has a gate capable of accommodating an Airbus A380.

American Airlines has a presence in every terminal at DFW. Other domestic airlines and some Canadian airlines operate out of Terminal E, while overseas carriers operate out of Terminal D.

International Airlines that provide nonstop service to DFW include: Air Canada, Air France, Avianca, Emirates, Fiji Airways, Finnair, Iberia, Qatar Airways, Japan Airlines, Korean Air, British Airways, Lufthansa, Qantas, Qatar Airways, Turkish Airlines, Viva, Volaris, and Aeromexico.

*Terminal A has 26 gates.
*Terminal B has 45 gates (35 in the main terminal and 10 in a satellite building).
*Terminal C has 29 gates. 
*Terminal D has 33 gates.
*Terminal E has 41 gates (26 in the main terminal and 15 in a satellite building).

===Hotels===
There are two Hyatt branded hotels located in the central terminal area.

The Hyatt Regency DFW International Airport was built in 1978 as the east wing of the Airport Marina Hotel. It originally had an identical twin west wing, located on the opposite side of International Parkway, which was built in 1974 and demolished for construction of Terminal D. It has 811 rooms, of meeting space and four food and beverage outlets. The hotel is located adjacent to Terminal C, with shuttle buses connecting to all terminals.

The Grand Hyatt DFW opened on July 1, 2005 and has 298 rooms, of meeting space and three food and beverage outlets. The hotel is located directly above Terminal D, with direct access to the check-in area.

===Ground transportation===
The DFW Airport area is served by International Parkway (partially State Highway 97 Spur), which runs through the center of the airport, connecting to Airport Freeway (State Highway 183) on the southern side of the airport and John W. Carpenter Freeway (State Highway 114) on the northern side. International Parkway continues north of State Highway 114, carrying the State Highway 121 designation for a short while until its interchange with the Lyndon B. Johnson Freeway (I-635), where State Highway 121 continues north as the Sam Rayburn Tollway.

Bus routes serving the airport are operated by Dallas Area Rapid Transit (DART) and Trinity Metro. DART operates route 230 from Downtown Irving/Heritage Crossing Station and Southwestern Medical District/Parkland Station to the Remote South Parking facility, and Trinity Metro operates the TRE Link bus route from CentrePort/DFW Airport station.

Three rail systems serve the airport: DART light rail, TEXRail, and the Trinity Railway Express. DART operates light rail from DFW Airport Terminal A station. This provides direct rail service on the to Dallas and Las Colinas (with a later extension to DFW Airport North station). 
TEXRail is a commuter rail service between DFW Airport Terminal B station and T&amp;P Station in downtown Fort Worth. DFW Airport is additionally served by the Trinity Railway Express commuter rail line at CentrePort/DFW Airport Station via shuttle bus to the Remote South parking lot. The line serves both downtown Dallas and downtown Fort Worth. There is also the DART Silver Line opening in 2024 which will also serve terminal B.

A consolidated rental car facility is located at the south end of the airport and connected to all terminals by a dedicated network of shuttle buses. Hosting ten rental car companies, the center was completed in March 2000.

===Other facilities===
A cargo facility at 1639 West 23rd Street is located on the airport property. Tenants include China Airlines, Lufthansa Cargo, and the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

The DFW Airport Department of Public Safety provides the airport with its own police, fire protection, and emergency medical services.

The DFW International Airport headquarters is located nearby at 2400 Aviation Drive.

In 1995, the airport opened Founders&#x27; Plaza, an observation park dedicated to the founders of DFW Airport. The site offered a panoramic view of the south end of the airport and hosted several significant events, including an employee memorial the day after the September 11 attacks in 2001 and the airport&#x27;s 30th anniversary celebration in 2004. As part of the perimeter taxiway project, Founders&#x27; Plaza was closed in 2007 and moved to a new location surrounding a -tall beacon on the north side of the airport in 2008. The plaza features a granite monument and sculpture, post-mounted binoculars, piped-in voices of air traffic controllers and shade pavilions. In 2010, a memorial honoring Delta Air Lines Flight 191 was dedicated at the plaza.

==Accidents and incidents==
*August 2, 1985: Delta Air Lines Flight 191, a Lockheed L-1011 on a Fort Lauderdale–Dallas/Fort Worth–Los Angeles route, crashed near the north end of runway 17L (now 17C) after encountering a severe microburst on final approach; the crash killed 8 of 11 crew members, 128 of 152 passengers on board and one person on the ground. This was the first fatal accident at or near DFW since its opening in January 1974.
*March 24, 1987: The pilot of a Metroflight Convair CV-580, registration number &quot;N73107&quot;, operating for American Eagle Airlines bound for Gregg County Airport, lost directional control during a crosswind takeoff. The left-hand wing and propeller struck the runway and the nose landing gear collapsed as the craft slid onto an adjacent taxiway; eight passengers and three crew aboard the airliner suffered minor or no injuries. The crash was attributed to the pilot&#x27;s decision to disregard wind information and take off in weather conditions that exceeded the rated capabilities of the aircraft; the pilot&#x27;s &quot;overconfidence in [his/her] personal ability&quot; was cited as a contributing factor in the accident report.
*May 21, 1988: An American Airlines McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registration number &quot;N136AA&quot;, operating as AA Flight 70 bound for Frankfurt Airport, overran runway 35L after warning signals prompted the flight crew to initiate a rejected takeoff. The jetliner continued to accelerate for several seconds and did not stop until it had run 1,100 feet (335 m) past the runway threshold, collapsing the nose landing gear. Two crew were seriously injured and the remaining 12 crew and 240 passengers escaped safely; the aircraft was severely damaged and was written off. Investigators attributed the overrun to a shortcoming in the design standards when the DC-10 was built; there had been no requirement to test whether worn (as opposed to new) brake pads were capable of stopping the aircraft during a rejected takeoff and eight of the ten worn pad sets failed.
*August 31, 1988: Delta Air Lines Flight 1141, a Boeing 727, bound for Salt Lake City International Airport, crashed after takeoff, killing 14 of the 108 people on board and injuring 76 others, 26 seriously. To date, this is the last and most recent fatal accident to occur near or on airport property.
*April 14, 1993: The pilot of American Airlines Flight 102, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-30, registration number &quot;N139AA&quot;, lost directional control during a crosswind landing in rain on arrival from Honolulu International Airport. The jetliner slid off runway 17L (now 17C) and dug into deep mud, collapsing the nose landing gear and damaging the left-hand engine and wing. A fire in the left-hand wheel well was rapidly extinguished by firefighters. Two passengers suffered serious injuries while using the evacuation slides; the remaining 187 passengers and 13 crew evacuated safely. The aircraft was written off.
*October 1, 1993: Martinaire Flight 639, a Cessna 208B Caravan cargo aircraft, registration number &quot;N9762B&quot;, was blown off runway 17L by jet blast after arriving from Tulsa International Airport, sustaining substantial damage to the left wing. The pilot, who was the sole occupant, was not injured. The pilot had disregarded a safety advisory from air traffic control and attempted to taxi behind a McDonnell Douglas MD-11 as it was cleared for takeoff.
*July 18, 1997: A Cessna 172 allegedly stolen from Sherman Municipal Airport was unlawfully flown at very low altitude across DFW Airport, Fort Worth Alliance Airport, and the landing area at a Bell Helicopter facility, causing significant air traffic disruptions. The unknown pilot then flew the aircraft back to Sherman Municipal and parked it. The Cessna&#x27;s owner denied flying it that day and stated that he could not positively identify the incident pilot because several people had access to the aircraft.
*May 23, 2001: The right main landing gear of an American Airlines Fokker 100, registration number &quot;N1419D&quot;, operating as AA Flight 1107, collapsed upon landing on runway 17C after a scheduled flight from Charlotte/Douglas International Airport. The pilot was able to maintain directional control and stop the aircraft on the runway. The incident was attributed to metal fatigue caused by a manufacturing flaw in the right main gear; there were no serious injuries to the 88 passengers or 4 crew, but the aircraft was badly damaged and was written off.

<text>Sir James Blount (died 1493) (sometimes spelt &quot;Blunt&quot;) was commander of the English fortress of Hammes, near Calais.

Blount was the son of Walter Blount, 1st Baron Mountjoy, and uncle of William Blount, 4th Baron Mountjoy. In 1473, he sat in Parliament as the MP for Derbyshire.

He was appointed governor of Hammes jointly with his elder brother John Blount, 3rd Baron Mountjoy in 1476.
When, in 1484, the Earl of Oxford and William, 2nd Viscount Beaumont, were imprisoned at Hammes, Blount was apparently persuaded to switch to the Lancastrian side. Blount, Oxford, and Beaumont fled to join Henry Tudor, (the future Henry VII of England who was then living in exile in France).Blount remained with the Lancastrian forces and landed with Henry Tudor&#x27;s forces in 1485 at Milford Haven, where he was knighted.

Blount appears as a minor character in William Shakespeare&#x27;s play Richard III.

<doc id="248488" wikidata="Q3893916" url="?curid=248488" title="Robert Stillington">
<text>Robert Stillington (about 1405 – May 1491) was an English cleric and administrator who was Bishop of Bath and Wells from 1465 and twice served as Lord Chancellor under King Edward IV. In 1483 he was instrumental in the accession of King Richard III, leading to later reprisals against him under King Henry VII.

==Life==
Stillington was Archdeacon of Taunton (1450–1465) and Archdeacon of Berkshire (1464–1465) when he was made Keeper of the Privy Seal from 1460 to 1467.

Stillington was selected as Bishop of Bath and Wells on 30 October 1465, and was consecrated on 16 March 1466. He was appointed Lord Chancellor on 20 June 1467 and held the office until 29 September 1470, when Henry VI was restored to the throne. After the return of Edward IV, he was reappointed to his former office and held it until 18 June 1473, when Edward dismissed him.

In 1478, Stillington spent some weeks in prison, apparently as a result of some association with the disgraced George, Duke of Clarence. It has been suggested that he gave Clarence information about the king&#x27;s prior common law association with a mistress Lady Eleanor Talbot, information that would have put Clarence in a position to claim the throne for himself.

After Edward&#x27;s death in April 1483, Stillington was a member of the council of the boy-king Edward V. Some time in June, a clergyman, identified as Stillington only by the writings [&quot;Mémoires&quot;, book VI chapter 17] of the French diplomat Philippe de Commines (who referred to him as &quot;levesque de Bas&quot; (bishop of Bath) and &quot;ce mauvais evesque&quot; (this bad bishop)), told Richard, Duke of Gloucester, the Lord Protector, that the marriage of Edward IV and Elizabeth Woodville had been invalid on the grounds of Edward&#x27;s earlier marriage to Lady Eleanor Talbot, at which he claimed to have officiated. This led to Elizabeth Woodville&#x27;s children by Edward IV being declared illegitimate and the Duke of Gloucester ascending the throne as Richard III.

After Henry VII defeated Richard III at Bosworth in 1485, he immediately had Stillington imprisoned again. Henry had the bigamy charge against Edward IV reversed, and married Edward&#x27;s daughter, Elizabeth of York.

Some years after Stillington&#x27;s second release, he became involved in the plot to place the impostor Lambert Simnel on the throne in 1487. After finding refuge at Oxford University, he was eventually handed over to the king and imprisoned. He was buried in a chapel of his own founding, since demolished, at Wells Cathedral.

<text>Newark Liberty International Airport is a major international airport serving the New York metropolitan area. The airport straddles the boundary between the cities of Newark in Essex County and Elizabeth in Union County, in the U.S. state of New Jersey. Located approximately south of downtown Newark and west-southwest of Manhattan, it is a major gateway to destinations in Europe, South America, Asia, and Oceania. It is jointly owned by the two cities, and the airport itself is leased to its operator, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. It is the second-busiest airport in the New York airport system behind John F. Kennedy International Airport and ahead of LaGuardia Airport.

The airport is near the Newark Airport Interchange, the junction between both Interstate 95 and Interstate 78 (both of which are components of the New Jersey Turnpike), and U.S. Routes 1 and 9, which has junctions with U.S. Route 22, Route 81, and Route 21. AirTrain Newark connects the terminals with the Newark Liberty International Airport Railway Station. The station is served by NJ Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and &quot;Keystone Service&quot; routes also make stops at the station.

The City of Newark built the airport on of marshland in 1928, and the Army Air Corps operated the facility during World War II. The airport was constructed adjacent to Port Newark and U.S. Route 1. After the Port Authority took over the facility in 1948, an instrument runway, a terminal building, a control tower, and an air cargo center were constructed. The airport&#x27;s Building One from 1935 was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1980.

During 2022, the airport served 43.4 million passengers, which made it the 13th-busiest airport in the nation, and the 23rd-busiest airport in the world. The busiest year to date was 2023, when it served 49.1 million passengers. Newark Liberty International serves 50 carriers, and is the largest hub for United Airlines by available seat miles. The airline serves about 63% of passengers at EWR, making it the largest tenant at the airport. United and FedEx Express, its second-largest tenant, operate in three buildings covering approximately of airport property.

In the 1920s, Newark, New Jersey, was the site of two airfields: Heller Field, which opened in 1919, and Hadley Field, which opened in 1924, that were used by the United States airmail service.

In May 1921, Heller Field was closed and all air mail services moved to Hadley Field, which by 1927 also served four airlines. The U.S. Postal Service, however, desired to have an airfield closer to New York City. In 1927, people and organizations, both national and local in scope, began calling for a new airport in the area of Newark, including Newark&#x27;s mayor, Thomas Raymond.

On August 3, 1927, Raymond ordered plans for a new airport. Construction, which was estimated to cost $6 million (), began on April 1, 1928, along US Route 1 and Port Newark. The construction involved a land reclamation project to create of level ground, above sea level to prevent flooding, upon which a runway was to be laid. In addition to the of earth required for the reclamation, 7,000 Christmas trees and 200 bank safes donated by a local junk vendor were used. 

The airport opened on October 1, 1928, dubbed the Newark Metropolitan Airport. It was the first major airport to serve the New York metropolitan area, the first commercial airport in the United States and the first with a paved airstrip. The first lease for space at Newark Airport was signed by Canadian Colonial Airways in April 1928.
The nation&#x27;s first air traffic control tower and airport weather station opened at Newark in 1930. The Art Deco style Newark Metropolitan Airport Administration Building, adorned with murals by Arshile Gorky, was built in 1934 and dedicated by Amelia Earhart in 1935 and was the first passenger terminal in the United States. It served as the terminal until the opening of the North Terminal in 1953. Newark became the first airport to allow nighttime operations after installing runway lights in 1952.

Construction of the Brewster Hangar began in 1937 and continued through 1938. This hangar was the most advanced of its time. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1979 and is now a museum and Port Authority Police headquarters.

Despite these innovations, critics said the airport was poorly designed because there was no separation of incoming and outbound passengers and no thought given to future expansion, though this did not stop Newark from being the busiest commercial airport. United Airlines, American Airlines, Eastern Airlines, and TWA signed 10-year leases with the airport which ended in 1938. Then they would pay on a month-to-month basis until LaGuardia Airport opened in December 1939; by the middle of 1940, all passenger airlines had left Newark, no longer making it the world&#x27;s busiest airport.

=== World War II ===
When the United States joined World War II in late 1941, the field was closed to commercial aviation, and it was taken over by the United States Army for logistics operations. The growing importance of supplying the overseas air forces and the need for more efficient control of supply shipments led to the activation of the Atlantic (and the Pacific) Overseas Air Service Commands on 1 October 1943. With headquarters at Newark, New Jersey (and Oakland, California for the Pacific Command). The Atlantic Overseas Air Service Command exercised control over the movement of Air Corps cargo through the ports of embarkation on the Atlantic and Gulf coasts.

In 1945, captured German aircraft brought from Europe on HMS &quot;Reaper&quot; for evaluation under Operation Lusty were off-loaded at Newark, and then flown or shipped to Freeman Field in Indiana, or Naval Air Station Patuxent River in Maryland.

=== Reopened ===
The airlines returned to Newark in February 1946, when it was reopened to commercial service. In 1948, the city of Newark leased the airport to the Port of New York Authority, now the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey. As part of the lease agreement, Port Authority took operational control of the airport and began investing heavily in capital improvements, including new hangars, a new terminal, and runway 4/22.

On December 16, 1951, a Miami Airlines C-46 bound for Tampa, lost a cylinder on takeoff from runway 28 and crashed in Elizabeth, killing 56. On January 22, 1952, an American Airlines CV-240 crashed in Elizabeth while on approach to Runway 6, killing all 23 aboard and seven on the ground.

On February 11, 1952, a National DC-6 crashed in Elizabeth following takeoff from runway 24, killing 29 of 63 on board and four on the ground.

Much of Newark Airport&#x27;s traffic shifted to Idlewild, today known as John F. Kennedy International Airport, after Newark was temporarily closed in February 1952; flights were shifted to LaGuardia Airport and Idlewild, which allowed for planes to takeoff and land over the water rather than over the densely populated areas surrounding Newark Airport. The airport remained closed in Newark until November 1952, with the introduction of new flight patterns that directed planes away from Elizabeth. The continued unpopularity and the New York area&#x27;s growing air traffic led to searches for new airport sites. Port Authority&#x27;s proposal to build a new airport at what is now the Great Swamp National Wildlife Refuge was defeated by local opposition.

Through the early 1970s, Newark had a single terminal building located on the north side of the field by what is now Interstate 78. A new control tower opened in 1960, and the terminal was expanded from 26 to 32 gates in 1965. A $200 million expansion of the airport, which was to include three terminals, began in 1967 after three years of planning. In 1973, the airport was renamed Newark International Airport. Former Terminal A and present Terminal B opened in 1973, although some charter and international flights requiring customs clearance remained at the North Terminal. The main building of Terminal C was completed at the same time, but only metal framing work was completed for the terminal&#x27;s satellites. It would lay dormant until the mid-1980s, when, for a brief time, the western third of the terminal was readied for international arrivals and used for People Express transcontinental flights. Terminal C was then completed, and opened in June 1988.

Underutilized in the 1970s, Newark expanded dramatically in the 1980s. People Express struck a deal with the Port Authority to use the North Terminal as its air terminal and corporate office in 1981 and began operations at Newark that April. It grew quickly, increasing Newark&#x27;s traffic through the 1980s. Virgin Atlantic began service between Newark and London in 1984, challenging JFK&#x27;s status as New York&#x27;s international gateway. Federal Express (now known as FedEx Express) opened its second hub at the airport in 1986.

When People Express merged into Continental Airlines in 1987, operations (including corporate office operations) at the North Terminal were reduced, and the building was demolished to make way for cargo facilities in early 1997. This merger started the dominance of Continental Airlines, and later United Airlines, at Newark Airport.

On July 22, 1981, a railroad tank car carrying ethylene oxide caught fire at the freight yard in Port Newark, causing the evacuation of a one-mile radius including an evacuation of the North Terminal building of the airport.

In late 1996, the airport&#x27;s monorail system opened, connecting the three terminals, the overflow parking lots and garages, and the rental car facilities. A new International Arrivals Facility also opened in Terminal B that year. The monorail was expanded to the new Newark Airport train station on Amtrak&#x27;s Northeast Corridor line in 2001, and was renamed AirTrain Newark.

===21st century===

In 2000, the Port Authority moved the historic Building 51 and renamed it to Building One. The building, which weighs more than , was hydraulically lifted, placed atop dollies and rolled about . It is now where the airport&#x27;s administrative offices are located.

====September 11 attacks====

After the hijacking and subsequent crash of United Airlines Flight 93 during the 2001 September 11 attacks, the airport&#x27;s name was changed from Newark International Airport to Newark Liberty International Airport in 2002. This name was chosen over the initial proposal, Liberty International Airport at Newark, and pays tribute to the victims of the September 11 attacks and to the landmark Statue of Liberty, lying east of the airport.

On September 10, 2021, a new 9/11 memorial was dedicated at the historic former administration building, Building One. It features a steel base plate with a small piece of an exterior column from southwest corner of the South Tower of the former World Trade Center.

====International traffic expansion====
In October 2015, Singapore Airlines announced intentions to resume direct nonstop service between Newark and its main hub at Changi Airport, which had ended in November 2013. The airline announced that service would resume some time in 2018, and the Airbus A350-900ULR was chosen as the aircraft for the route. On May 30, 2018, Singapore Airlines officially announced that nonstop service between Newark and Singapore would begin on October 11, 2018, and Newark Liberty once again became host to what was then the world&#x27;s longest non-stop flight.

Continental Airlines (now merged with United Airlines as of 2010) began flying from Newark to Beijing–Capital on June 15, 2005, and to Delhi on November 1, 2005. The airline soon started flights to Mumbai. On July 16, 2007, Continental announced it would seek government approval for nonstop flights between Newark and Shanghai–Pudong in 2009. Continental began flights to Shanghai from Newark on March 25, 2009, using a Boeing 777-200ER aircraft. Newark was the only airport in the New York City Metropolitan Area used by Philippine Airlines (PAL), until financial problems in the late 1990s compelled the airline to terminate this service.

In June 2008, flight caps were put in place to restrict the number of flights to 81 per hour. The flight caps, in effect until 2009, were intended to be a short-term solution to Newark&#x27;s congestion. After the cap expired, the FAA embarked on a seven-year-long project to reduce congestion in all three New York area airports, as well as the surrounding flight paths.

Newark is a major hub for United Airlines (Continental Airlines before the 2010 merger). United has its Global Gateway at Terminal C, having completed a major expansion project that included a new, third concourse, and a new Federal Inspection Services facility. With its Newark hub, United has the most service of any airline in the New York area. On March 6, 2014, United opened a new , $25 million hangar on a parcel to accommodate their wide-body aircraft during maintenance. In 2015, the airline announced plans to leave JFK altogether and streamline its transcontinental operations at Newark. On July 7, 2016, the United States Department of Transportation announced that Newark was one of ten cities to first operate flights to José Martí International Airport in Havana, Cuba.

Southwest Airlines began service at the airport in 2011, flying to ten cities. It ended all Newark service in November 2019, primarily due to the Boeing 737 MAX groundings, low demand, and inadequate facilities, and consolidated its New York area operations to Long Island and LaGuardia.

====Redevelopment and growth====
In 2016, the Port Authority approved and announced a redevelopment plan to replace Terminal A, set to fully open in 2022. A $2.7 billion investment, the new terminal was expected to increase passenger flow and gate flexibility between airlines, and would also be accompanied by a replacement for the AirTrain Newark monorail system, scheduled for completion in 2024. The new Terminal A officially opened on December 8, 2022. The new Terminal A has 33 gates, increasing Newark&#x27;s gate total to 125, including 16 gates that can be alternated to accommodate either 2 narrow-body aircraft or 1 wide-body aircraft. 

As a result of the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States, which affected countless services across the New York City area, aircraft operations at Newark went though drastic changes, with only 15,892,892 passengers in 2020, despite having 46,336,452 the previous years, the most in its history. Alaska Airlines trimmed its Newark schedule to three daily flights and leased their gates (A30 and A31) to JetBlue to accommodate their increased operations. In June 2022, United Airlines announced they would cut about 50 domestic flights from Newark in an effort to reduce delays. On January 11, 2023, the FAA system outage across the United States caused 103 flights from Newark to be grounded, the third highest in the country.

In October 2022, PANYNJ announced their EWR Vision, which will cover short- and long-term development through 2065. Officials named Arup, a global top aviation planning and design firm, to partner with SOM, who has done several projects with the Port Authority and EWR prior. The start of their plans included finishing the new Terminal A, which was successfully completed in January 2023, and replacing the old AirTrain, which was expected to be completed sometime in 2026, but later pushed to 2029. Goals for the project include creating a World Class Gateway for New Jersey, creating long-term economic growth, and creating a phase-by-phase plan that will not affect the airport&#x27;s operations, while simultaneously expanding it to accommodate passenger and cargo growth in that time.

In October 2024, after extensive outreach to airport stakeholders, local community leaders and the public, PANYNJ unveiled the findings of the EWR Vision. Major elements of the EWR Vision Plan include:

* Terminal development: The plan calls for building a new, world-class international terminal to replace the current Terminal B, while enhancing Terminal C to improve the customer experience. Both would complement the airport’s award-winning new Terminal A that opened in January 2023, which could also see further expansion. The spacious, streamlined terminals would allow the airport to accommodate continued growth in passenger volume, while leaving space for further expansion as needed.

* Airside development: The plan envisions improving the airport’s operations with a more efficient and resilient taxiway network, while accommodating the industry trend toward larger aircraft. The new network would increase parking capacity and flexibility for aircraft, while creating redundancies to minimize delays during irregular operations. It incorporates additional deicing facilities, allowing aircraft to push off from gates more quickly. It would also include the industry’s latest safety standards, increasing straight taxiway segments and minimizing the need for crossings. 

* Landside development: The blueprint looks to transform the airport’s vehicular and multi-modal access, prioritizing efficiency and convenience for all users. Alongside terminal buildings, frontages would be expanded to meet industry standards, providing ample space for passenger waiting, loading and unloading while minimizing walking distances. AirTrain access would be simplified, while connectivity and amenities for cyclists, pedestrians, and service vehicles would be improved. The roadway network would also be streamlined to reduce decision points and separate major flows with independent circulation for each terminal.

 Newark serves 50 carriers and is the third-largest hub for United Airlines after Chicago O&#x27;Hare and Houston George Bush Intercontinental. During a 12-month period ending in March 2022, over 63% of all passengers at the airport were carried by United Airlines. The second-busiest airline is JetBlue Airways, which carries 11.4%, followed by American Airlines, which carries 5.6%. The second largest tenant is FedEx, which operates in 3 buildings on around two million square feet of the airport&#x27;s property.

==Facilities==
===Runways and taxiways===
The airport covers and has three runways and one helipad:

* 4L/22R: , asphalt/concrete, grooved
* 4R/22L: , asphalt, grooved
* 11/29: , asphalt, grooved
* Helipad H1: , asphalt

Runway 11/29 is one of the three runways built during World War II. In 1952, Runways 1/19 and 6/24 were closed and a new Runway 4/22 (now 4R/22L) opened at a length of . After 1970, this runway was extended to , shortened for a while to and finally reaching its present length by 2000. Runway 4L/22R opened in 1970 at a length of and was extended to its current length by 2000.

The airport has more than 12 miles of 75-foot-wide taxiways. In 2014, the Port Authority completed a $97 million rehabilitation project of Runway 4L/22R while adding four new taxiways to reduce delays. Three of the new taxiways allow multiple planes to stage for departure at the end of the runway, reducing takeoff delays, while the other new taxiway will allow arriving planes to exit the runway faster and get to the gates quicker.

All approaches except Runway 29 have Instrument Landing Systems and Runway 4R is certified for Category III approaches. Runway 22L had been upgraded to CAT III approach capability.

Runway 4L/22R is primarily used for takeoffs while 4R/22L is primarily used for landings, and 11/29 is used by smaller aircraft or when there are strong crosswinds on the two main runways. Newark&#x27;s parallel runways (4L and 4R) are apart, the fourth-smallest separation of major airports in the U.S., after San Francisco International Airport, Los Angeles International Airport, and Seattle–Tacoma International Airport. Helipad H1 is used by Blade, a helicopter service that goes to EWR and JFK from their heliport on East 34th street in New York City with the purpose of going to and from the airport in under 5 minutes. They use the Bell 407 helicopter.

Unlike the other two major New York–area airports, JFK and LaGuardia, which are located directly next to large bodies of water (Jamaica Bay and the East River, respectively) and whose runways extend at least partially out into them, Newark Airport and its runways are completely land-locked. While located just across Interstate 95 from Newark Bay and not far from the Hudson River, the airport does not directly front upon either body of water.

=== Cargo ===

In 1997, the North Terminal was torn down to make a new air cargo facility. EWR now has almost 1 million square feet of total cargo facility space, and are dedicated to cargo operations. The airport is in both Newark, Essex County and Elizabeth, Union County, and is adjacent to Port Newark–Elizabeth Marine Terminal and Foreign-Trade Zone No. 49. It serves more than 45 air carriers with nearly 1,200 daily arrivals and departures to domestic and international destinations. Climate-controlled warehouse areas and cold storage accommodate perishable items.

Aeroterm operates buildings 339 and 340, and the designated United Airlines cargo facility was constructed in 2001. The FedEx Cargo Complex is a $60-million sort facility at its Newark Hub which includes Buildings 347, 156 and most of 155. Building 157 is a cargo building used by several tenants. Construction of it was completed in 2003. UPS completed construction of their new cargo building in 2019.

=== Air traffic control ===
In December 1935, the airport&#x27;s first air control station came into existence following a flight that crashed outside of Kansas City, killing five people, including a U.S. senator. The airport&#x27;s original terminal, or Building 51, also known as the Administration Building housed the first air traffic control tower for the airport, and was designed by John Homlish in the 1930s. A concrete brutalist-styled and toothbrush-shaped control tower was built in 1960, and opened on January 18 of that year, designed by architect Allan Gordon Lorimer; the cost of the construction was estimated to be $1.5 million. In 2002, this control tower closed and was replaced by a new and taller control tower, and was demolished in 2004. The current air traffic control tower is 325 feet tall (99 m). The current tower is located next to a Marriott hotel, which is located on the airport&#x27;s property. The current tower overlooks the Manhattan Skylines and the George Washington Bridge.

=== Other facilities ===
There are several hotels adjacent to Newark Liberty International Airport. Hotels such as Courtyard by Marriott and the Holiday Inn are located on the airport&#x27;s property. Signature Flight Support is the only fixed-base operator at the airport, providing various services to private aircraft. Terminals A, B, and C all have short-term parking lots. Garage P4 can access the AirTrain directly. Economy Parking P6 can be accessed from the terminals using the Port Authority shuttle bus. An Exxon gas station with a 7-Eleven store (both with street address 100 Lindbergh Road) is located on the airport&#x27;s property.

==Terminals==
Across the airport&#x27;s three terminals, there are 125 gates: Terminal A has 33 gates, Terminal B has 24 gates, and Terminal C has 68 gates.

Gate numbering starts in Terminal A with Gate A1 and ends in Terminal C at C138. Wayfinding signage throughout the terminals was designed by Paul Mijksenaar, who also designed signage for LaGuardia and JFK Airports.

===Terminal A===

In March 2017, the Port Authority approved the project to build a new Terminal A, replacing the original terminal, which opened in 1973. Built on a site once occupied by United Parcel Service and the United States Postal Service, the new terminal cost around $2.7 billion and includes redesigned roadways with 8 new bridges, a new six-level, 2,700-car parking garage and rental center, 33 gates, and a walkway to connect the AirTrain station, parking garage, and terminal building. The terminal officially opened on December 8, 2022. However, due to continued testing of the fire alarm and security system as well as a hesitance from the PANYNJ to open a brand new terminal ahead of the 2022 holiday season, the grand opening was delayed to January 12, 2023, at which 17 of the total 33 gates opened – all on the south side of the terminal. The rest of the 33 gates opened in August 2023.
Designed by Grimshaw Architects, Terminal A references the modern era design of the &quot;modular concrete structures&quot; of the other two terminals through the use of the latest materials that allow for a larger and more light filled space. The redevelopment offers more traffic lanes at pickup and drop-off points, closer check-in counters and security areas to the entrance, and more gate flexibility to allow planes to park at any gate in a &quot;common-use&quot; system. The new Terminal A has four levels: the departures level, the mezzanine level for offices, the arrivals level, and the ground floor, where baggage claim is located. The terminal is operated as EWR Terminal One LLC by Munich Airport International, a subsidiary of Munich Airport, which manages the terminal&#x27;s operations, maintenance, and concessions in the 1 million square feet of retail space. The redevelopment also comes with plans to replace the existing AirTrain monorail system, scheduled to open in 2029, and was not opened along with the new Terminal A.

The new Terminal A handles flights by Air Canada, American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, JetBlue (except for international arrivals from non-precleared flights which are handled at Terminal B), and a minority of United flights not in Terminal C. Multiple technologies in the terminal, such as check-in and security, have been partly-automated. The terminal&#x27;s design has been noted for its use of art from local artists, art on digital columns, a new variety of restaurants and stores, and easy access to power outlets. The terminal was designed to fit New Jersey&#x27;s &quot;Garden State&quot; (the state&#x27;s nickname) image. The new terminal also has a designated section for ridesharing company pickups, public transportation, and taxis. On top of the new Terminal A parking garage, the Port Authority built a rooftop canopy of 12,708 solar panels that is the size of six football fields and the largest solar roof at any airport in the United States. In 2023, Terminal A was awarded the special prize for an exterior in the world selection for the 2023 Prix Versailles in the airports category. In 2024, Skytrax awarded Terminal A their prestigious 5-star rating and named it the best new airport terminal in the world. Terminal A is only the second terminal in North America to achieve both awards.

=== Terminal B ===

Terminal B, like the original Terminal A, was completed in 1973 and has four levels. Terminal B is the only passenger terminal directly operated by the Port Authority. It handles most foreign carriers, such as British Airways, Lufthansa, and Aer Lingus, ultra-low cost regional operators like Spirit Airlines, Sun Country Airlines, and Allegiant Air, and some of United&#x27;s international arrivals.

In 1996, a new $120 million internationals arrival hall opened. The hall is the length of two football fields and features large skylights and windows allowing for natural light and panoramic views of flight activity and the Manhattan skyline. It features 56 immigration booths and seven baggage carrousels. 

In 2006, Terminal B renovations began to increase capacity for departing passengers and passenger comfort. The renovations included expanding and updating the ticketing areas, building a new departure level for domestic flights and building a new arrivals hall. In January 2012, Port Authority executive director Patrick Foye said $350 million would be spent on Terminal B, addressing complaints by passengers that they cannot move freely. The renovations enhanced the terminal&#x27;s &quot;cathedral-like layout&quot; and made the terminal more cohesive while adding more than of usable space. Further developments were made to Terminal B when the Port Authority installed new LED fixtures in 2014. The LED fixtures, developed by Sensity Systems, use wireless network capabilities to collect and feed data into the software that can spot long lines, recognize license plates, and identify suspicious activity and alert the appropriate staff. The full renovation of Terminal B was complete by May 2014.

The original Terminal B building is slated for demolition and replacement with new terminal to be constructed landslide.

===Terminal C===

Terminal C, designed by Grad Associates, was completed in 1988. Terminal C is exclusively operated by and for United Airlines and its regional carrier United Express for their global hub. The main terminal building for Terminal C was built alongside Terminals A and B in the 1970s, but lay dormant until People Express Airlines took it over as a replacement for the former North Terminal when the airline&#x27;s hub there outgrew the old facility.

From 1998 to 2003, Terminal C was rebuilt and expanded in a $1.2 billion program known as the Continental Airlines Global Gateway Project. The project, which was designed by Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill, doubled the available space for outbound travelers as the former baggage claim/arrivals hall was remodeled and turned into a second departures level.

International Concourse C-3, a new facility with capacity for a maximum of 19 narrow-body aircraft (or 12 wide-body planes), was added as well. Completion of this new concourse increased Terminal C&#x27;s mainline jet gates to 57. Accompanying Concourse C-3 was a new international arrivals facility. Also included in the project were an airside corridor connecting Concourses C-1, C-2, and C-3, a President&#x27;s Club (now United Polaris Lounge) for international business class passengers between C-2 and C-3, and new baggage processing facilities, including reconstruction of the former underground parking area into a new baggage claim and arrivals hall.

In November 2014, airport amenity manager OTG announced a $120 million renovation plan for Terminal C that included installing 6,000 iPads and 55 new restaurants headed by celebrity chefs, with the first new restaurants opening in summer of 2015 and the whole project completed in 2016. In 2019, Terminal C was named &#x27;Best for Foodies&#x27; in the nation by Fodor&#x27;s Travel Awards.

===Former terminals===
==== North Terminal (1953–1997) ====
The North Terminal opened in 1953. Former Terminal A and present Terminal B opened in 1973, although some charter and international flights requiring customs clearance remained at the North Terminal prior to the opening of two new terminals. Following significant expansion at EWR, People Express Airlines made a deal with the Port Authority to use the North Terminal as its air terminal and corporate office in 1981 and began operations at Newark that April. When People Express merged with Continental Airlines in 1987, operations at the North Terminal were reduced. In 1997, the North Terminal was closed and then demolished making place for new cargo facilities.

====Terminal A (1973–2023)====

The original Terminal A opened in 1973 and was closed on January 12, 2023, when the new Terminal A opened. It was operated by EWR Terminal One LLC, part of Flughafen München GmbH. Terminal A handled only domestic and Canadian flights served by JetBlue (for domestic flights), Air Canada, Air Canada Express, American Airlines, American Eagle; and some United Express flights.

In Terminal A, there was one United Club in Terminal A&#x27;s second concourse (A2). It also had an Admirals Club for American Airlines and an Air Canada Maple Leaf Lounge. Terminal A was the only terminal that had no immigration facilities; flights arriving from other countries could not use Terminal A without U.S. customs preclearance, although some departing international flights used the terminal. In 2016, the Port Authority approved and announced a redevelopment plan to build a new Terminal A replacing this one.

Part of Terminal A was closed for demolition on September 30, 2021. The remainder of the former Terminal A was closed to the public, and replaced with the new Terminal A on January 12, 2023. As of late spring, 2024, the majority of the terminal has been demolished, with only the headhouse remaining and being used as the home of the Newark Airport Redevelopment Office.

==Ground transportation==
===Train===
A monorail system, AirTrain Newark, connects the terminals with Newark Liberty International Airport Station. The station is served by New Jersey Transit&#x27;s Northeast Corridor Line and North Jersey Coast Line, with connections to regional rail hubs such as Newark Penn Station, Secaucus Junction and New York Penn Station where transfers are available to any rail line in northern New Jersey or Long Island, New York. Amtrak&#x27;s &quot;Northeast Regional&quot; and &quot;Keystone Service&quot; trains also stop at the Newark Liberty International Airport station. Passengers can ride the AirTrain for free between the terminals and the parking lots, parking garages, and rental car facilities.

In September 2012, Port Authority of New York and New Jersey announced that work would commence on a study to explore extending the PATH system to the station. The new station would be located at ground level to the west of the existing NJ Transit station. 
In 2014, the Board of Commissioners approved a formal proposal to extend the PATH to Newark Airport. On January 11, 2017, the Port Authority released its 10-year capital plan that included $1.7 billion for the extension. Under the plan, construction was projected to start in 2020, with service in 2026. , the plan for the station was changed to prioritize providing access from the station to the surrounding neighborhood with preliminary design and planning work for the station expansion underway. The PATH train extension is &quot;being differed to a future capital plan&quot; due to a &quot;current funding shortfall&quot;. On March 22, 2024, the Port Authority approved the $160 million station expansion project that will construct a pedestrian bridge from the station to a plaza off of Frelinghuysen Avenue accessible to pedestrians and cyclists with a drop off area for people coming by car or bus. The project no longer includes an extension of the PATH train but will preserve a right of way in case the line is ever extended. The project is scheduled to be completed in 2026.

In January 2019, New Jersey Governor Phil Murphy announced a plan for a $2 billion replacement project for AirTrain Newark. Murphy stated that replacement is necessary because the system is reaching the end of its projected 25-year life and is subject to persistent delays and breakdowns. The Port Authority would be responsible for funding the project. In October 2019, the Port Authority board approved the replacement project with an estimated cost of $2.05 billion. On May 5, 2021, the Port Authority issued requests for proposals to four teams. In December 2023, the Port Authority announced that the Austrian company Doppelmayr had been awarded the contract to replace the existing train system with a modern cable car system. The contract includes operating costs for 20 years and is close to $1 billion. The new AirTrain is scheduled to open in 2029.

===Bus===
====NJ Transit====

NJ Transit buses operate northbound local service to Irvington, Downtown Newark and Newark Penn Station, where connections are available to the PATH and NJ Transit rail lines. The &quot;go bus 28&quot; is a bus rapid transit line to Downtown Newark, Newark Broad Street Station and Bloomfield Station. Southbound service travels to Elizabeth, Lakewood, Toms River and intermediate points. NJ transit also operates bus routes 37, 62, 67, 107 and 107X to EWR.

====Olympia Trails====
Olympia Trails operates express buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal, Bryant Park, and Grand Central Terminal in Manhattan, Super-Shuttle and Go-link operate shared taxi services as GO Airport Shuttle.

====Trans-Bridge Lines====

United Airlines&#x27; bus service and Trans-Bridge Lines offer shuttles to Lehigh Valley International Airport (ABE) in Hanover Township, Pennsylvania outside Allentown. Continental Airlines, (which later merged into United in 2010), previously operated flights from Newark to Allentown, but switched to a bus service in 1995 due to constant delays from air traffic control.

Trans-Bridge Lines operates buses to EWR on their Allentown-Clinton-New York City eastbound and westbound route using both ABE and the Allentown Bus Terminal in Allentown, Clinton&#x27;s Park and Ride, and Port Authority Bus Terminal in Manhattan with several stops in Lehigh and Northampton counties.

===Road===

Private limousine, car service, and taxis also provide service to/from the airport. For trips to and from New York City, fares are set by the New York City Taxi and Limousine Commission.

The airport is served directly by U.S. Route 1/9, which provides connections to Route 81 and Interstate 78, both of which have interchanges with the New Jersey Turnpike at Interstate 95&#x27;s exits 13A and 14, respectively. The interchange where U.S. Route 1/9, U.S. Route 22, New Jersey Route 21, Interstate 78, and Interstate 95 meet is known as the Newark Airport Interchange. Northbound, Route 1/9 becomes the Pulaski Skyway, which connects to Route 139. Route 139 continues east to the Holland Tunnel, which links Jersey City with Lower Manhattan.

The airport&#x27;s northern, eastern, and western perimeters are directly surrounded by Brewster Road, a two-lane road which primarily serves to connect to the North area, South area, Port Authority police, and most parking lots. The airport&#x27;s official address is 3 Brewster Road.

The airport operates short and long term parking lots with shuttle buses and monorail access to the terminals. The Port Authority&#x27;s electric shuttle bus fleet comprising 36 buses and 19 chargers, was completed in October 2020 at Newark, John F. Kennedy International, and LaGuardia airports. A free cellphone lot waiting area is available for drivers picking up passengers at the airport.

==Airport information==
Newark Airport, along with LaGuardia and JFK airports, uses a uniform style of color-coded signage throughout the airport properties, designed by Paul Mijksenaar. Former New York City traffic reporter Bernie Wagenblast provides the voice for the airport&#x27;s radio station and curbside announcements, as well as the messages heard onboard AirTrain Newark and in its stations. The airport has the IATA airport code &quot;EWR&quot;, rather than a designation that begins with the letter &#x27;N&#x27; because the designator of &quot;NEW&quot; is already assigned to Lakefront Airport in New Orleans. Also, the Department of the Navy uses three-letter identifiers beginning with N for its purposes.

==Accidents and incidents==
* On March 17, 1929, a Colonial Western Airlines Ford Tri-Motor suffered a double engine failure during its initial climb after takeoff, failed to gain height, and crashed into a railroad freight car loaded with sand, killing 14 of the 15 people on board. At the time, it was the deadliest aviation accident in American history.
* On January 14, 1933, Eastern Air Transport, a Curtiss Condor, crashed at Newark; two crewmembers were killed.
* On May 4, 1947, Union Southern Airlines, a Douglas DC-3 with 12 passengers and crew, crashed on landing at Newark after overrunning the runway and into a ditch where it burned. Two crewmembers were killed.
* On December 16, 1951, a Miami Airlines C-46 Commando (converted for passenger use) lost a cylinder on takeoff from Runway 28 and crashed in Elizabeth, killing 56.
* On January 22, 1952, American Airlines Flight 6780, a Convair 240, crashed in Elizabeth on approach to Runway 6, killing 30.
* On February 11, 1952, National Airlines Flight 101, a Douglas DC-6, crashed in Elizabeth after takeoff from Runway 24, killing 33.
* On April 18, 1979, a New York Airways commuter helicopter on a routine flight to LaGuardia Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport plunged into the area between Runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L, killing three passengers and injuring 15. It was later determined the crash was due to a failure in the helicopter&#x27;s tail rotor.
* On March 30, 1983, a Learjet 23 operated by Hughes Charter Air, a night check courier flight, crashed on landing at EWR during an unstabilized approach. Both crewmembers were killed. Marijuana was later found in their systems, believed to have impaired judgement.
* On July 31, 1997, FedEx Flight 14, a McDonnell Douglas MD-11, crashed while landing after a flight from Anchorage International Airport. The Number 3 engine contacted the runway during a rough landing, which caused the aircraft to flip upside down. The aircraft was destroyed by fire. The two crewmembers and three passengers escaped uninjured.
* On May 1, 2013, Scandinavian Airlines Flight 908, an A330-300 that was cleared for takeoff, collided with an ExpressJet Embraer ERJ-145 aircraft on the taxiway. The ERJ-145 lost its tail in the accident.
* On March 1, 2025, FedEx Express Flight 3609 occurred.

<text>A Witches&#x27; Sabbath is a purported gathering of those believed to practice witchcraft and other rituals. The phrase became especially popular in the 20th century.

== Origin of the phrase ==

The most infamous and influential work of witch-hunting lore, &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (1486) does not contain the word sabbath ().

The first recorded English use of &quot;sabbath&quot; referring to sorcery was in 1660, in Francis Brooke&#x27;s translation of Vincent Le Blanc&#x27;s book &quot;The World Surveyed&quot;: &quot;Divers Sorcerers […] have confessed that in their Sabbaths […] they feed on such fare.&quot; The phrase &quot;Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot; appeared in a 1613 translation by &quot;W.B.&quot; of Sébastien Michaëlis&#x27;s &quot;Admirable History of Possession and Conversion of a Penitent Woman&quot;: &quot;He also said to Magdalene, Art not thou an accursed woman, that the Witches Sabbath (French: &quot;le Sabath&quot;] is kept here?&quot; 

The phrase is used by Henry Charles Lea in his &quot;History of the Inquisition of the Middle Ages&quot; (1888). Writing in 1900, German historian Joseph Hansen who was a correspondent and a German translator of Lea&#x27;s work, frequently uses the shorthand phrase &quot;hexensabbat&quot; to interpret medieval trial records, though any consistently recurring term is noticeably rare in the copious Latin sources Hansen also provides (see more on various Latin synonyms, below). 
Lea and Hansen&#x27;s influence may have led to a much broader use of the shorthand phrase, including in English. Prior to Hansen, use of the term by German historians also seems to have been relatively rare. A compilation of German folklore by Jakob Grimm in the 1800s () seems to contain no mention of &quot;hexensabbat&quot; or any other form of the term &quot;sabbat&quot; relative to fairies or magical acts. The contemporary of Grimm and early historian of witchcraft, W.G. Soldan also does not seem to use the term in his history (1843).

===A French connection===
In contrast to German and English counterparts, French writers (including Francophone authors writing in Latin) used the term more frequently, albeit still relatively rarely. There seems to be deep roots to inquisitorial persecution of the Waldensians. In 1124, the term &quot;inzabbatos&quot; is used to describe the Waldensians in Northern Spain. In 1438 and 1460, seemingly related terms &quot;synagogam&quot; and &quot;synagogue of Sathan&quot; are used to describe Waldensians by inquisitors in France. These terms could be a reference to Revelation 2:9 (&quot;I know the blasphemy of them which say they are Jews and are not, but are the synagogue of Satan.&quot;) Writing in Latin in 1458, Francophone author Nicolas Jacquier applies &quot;synagogam fasciniorum&quot; to what he considers a gathering of witches.

About 150 years later, near the peak of the witch-phobia and the persecutions which led to the execution of an estimated 40,000-100,000 persons, with roughly 80% being women, the Francophone writers still seem to be the main ones using these related terms, although still infrequently and sporadically in most cases. Lambert Daneau uses &quot;sabbatha&quot; one time (1581) as &quot;Synagogas quas Satanica sabbatha&quot;. Nicholas Remi uses the term occasionally as well as &quot;synagoga&quot; (1588). Jean Bodin uses the term three times (1580) and, across the channel, the Englishman Reginald Scot (1585) writing a book in opposition to witch-phobia, uses the term but only once in quoting Bodin. 

In 1611, Jacques Fontaine uses &quot;sabat&quot; five times writing in French and in a way that would seem to correspond with modern usage. The following year (1612), Pierre de Lancre seems to use the term more frequently than anyone before.

In 1668, a late date relative to the major European witch trials, German writer Johannes Praetorius published &quot;Blockes-Berges Verrichtung&quot;, with the subtitle &quot;Oder Ausführlicher Geographischer Bericht/ von den hohen trefflich alt- und berühmten Blockes-Berge: ingleichen von der Hexenfahrt/ und Zauber-Sabbathe/ so auff solchen Berge die Unholden aus gantz Teutschland/ Jährlich den 1. Maij in Sanct-Walpurgis Nachte anstellen sollen&quot;. As indicated by the subtitle, Praetorius attempted to give a &quot;Detailed Geographical Account of the highly admirable ancient and famous Blockula, also about the witches&#x27; journey and magic sabbaths&quot;.

Writing more than two hundred years after Pierre de Lancre, another French writer, Lamothe-Langon (whose character and scholarship was questioned in the 1970s), uses the term in (presumably) translating into French a handful of documents from the inquisition in Southern France. Joseph Hansen cited Lamothe-Langon as one of many sources.

==A term favored by recent translators==
Despite the infrequency of the use of the word &quot;sabbath&quot; to denote any such gatherings in the historical record, it became increasingly popular during the 20th century.

===Cautio Criminalis===
In a 2003 translation of Friedrich Spee&#x27;s &quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot; (1631) the word &quot;sabbaths&quot; is listed in the index with a large number of entries. However, unlike some of Spee&#x27;s contemporaries in France (mentioned above), who occasionally, if rarely, use the term &quot;sabbatha&quot;, Friedrich Spee does not ever use words derived from &quot;sabbatha&quot; or &quot;synagoga&quot;. Spee was German-speaking, and like his contemporaries, wrote in Latin. &quot;Conventibus&quot; is the word Spee uses most frequently to denote a gathering of witches, whether supposed or real, physical or spectral, as seen in the first paragraph of question one of his book. This is the same word from which English words &quot;convention&quot;, &quot;convent&quot;, and &quot;coven&quot; are derived. &quot;Cautio Criminalis&quot; (1631) was written as a passionate innocence project. As a Jesuit, Spee was often in a position of witnessing the torture of those accused of witchcraft.

===Malleus Maleficarum===
In a 2009 translation of Dominican inquisitor Heinrich Kramer&#x27;s &quot;Malleus Maleficarum&quot; (1486), the word &quot;sabbath&quot; does not occur. There is a line describing a supposed gathering that uses the word &quot;concionem&quot;; it is accurately translated as an &quot;assembly&quot;. However in the accompanying footnote, the translator seems to apologize for the lack of both the term &quot;sabbath&quot; and a general scarcity of other gatherings that would seem to fit the bill for what he refers to as a &quot;black sabbath&quot;.

===Fine art===

The phrase is also popular in recent translations of the titles of artworks, including:
*&quot;The Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot; by Hans Baldung (1510)
* &quot;Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot; by Frans Francken (1606)
* &quot;Witches&#x27; Sabbath in Roman Ruins&quot; by Jacob van Swanenburgh (1608)
* As a recent translation from the original Spanish &quot;El aquelarre&quot; to the English title &quot;Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot; (1798) and &quot;Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot; or &quot;The Great He-Goat&quot; (1823) both works by Francisco Goya
* &quot;Muse of the Night (Witches&#x27; Sabbath)&quot; by Luis Ricardo Falero (1880)

=== Music ===
In Hector Berlioz&#x27;s &quot;Symphonie Fantastique&quot;, the fifth and final movement of the composition is titled &quot;Hexensabbath&quot; in German and &quot;Songe d&#x27;une nuit du Sabbat&quot; in French, strangely having two different meanings. In the popular English editions of the symphony, the title of the movement is &quot;Dream of a Witches&#x27; Sabbath&quot;, a mixture of the two translations. The setting of the movement is in a satanic dream depicting the protagonist&#x27;s own funeral. Crowds of sorcerers and monsters stand around him, laughing, shouting, and screeching. The protagonist&#x27;s beloved appears as a witch, distorted from her previous beauty.

==Disputed accuracy of the accounts of gatherings==
Modern researchers have been unable to find any corroboration with the notion that physical gatherings of practitioners of witchcraft occurred. In his study &quot;The Pursuit of Witches and the Sexual Discourse of the Sabbat&quot;, the historian Scott E. Hendrix presents a two-fold explanation for why these stories were so commonly told in spite of the fact that sabbats likely never actually occurred. First, belief in the real power of witchcraft grew during the late medieval and early-modern Europe as a doctrinal view in opposition to the canon Episcopi gained ground in certain communities. This fueled a paranoia among certain religious authorities that there was a vast underground conspiracy of witches determined to overthrow Christianity. Women beyond child-bearing years provided an easy target and were scapegoated and blamed for famines, plague, warfare, and other problems. Having prurient and orgiastic elements helped ensure that these stories would be relayed to others.

===Ritual elements===
Bristol University&#x27;s Ronald Hutton has encapsulated the witches&#x27; sabbath as an essentially modern construction, saying:
The book &quot;Compendium Maleficarum&quot; (1608), by Francesco Maria Guazzo, illustrates a typical view of gathering of witches as &quot;the attendants riding flying goats, trampling the cross, and being re-baptised in the name of the Devil while giving their clothes to him, kissing his behind, and dancing back to back forming a round.&quot;

In effect, the sabbat acted as an effective &#x27;advertising&#x27; gimmick, causing knowledge of what these authorities believed to be the very real threat of witchcraft to be spread more rapidly across the continent. That also meant that stories of the sabbat promoted the hunting, prosecution, and execution of supposed witches.

The descriptions of Sabbats were made or published by priests, jurists and judges who never took part in these gatherings, or were transcribed during the process of the witchcraft trials. That these testimonies reflect actual events is for most of the accounts considered doubtful. Norman Cohn argued that they were determined largely by the expectations of the interrogators and free association on the part of the accused, and reflect only popular imagination of the times, influenced by ignorance, fear and religious intolerance towards minority groups.

Some of the existing accounts of the Sabbat were given when the person recounting them was being tortured, and so motivated to agree with suggestions put to them.

Christopher F. Black claimed that the Roman Inquisition&#x27;s sparse employment of torture allowed accused witches to not feel pressured into mass accusation. This in turn means there were fewer alleged groups of witches in Italy and places under inquisitorial influence. Because the Sabbath is a gathering of collective witch groups, the lack of mass accusation means Italian popular culture was less inclined to believe in the existence of Black Sabbath. The Inquisition itself also held a skeptical view toward the legitimacy of Sabbath Assemblies.

Many of the diabolical elements of the Witches&#x27; Sabbath stereotype, such as the eating of babies, poisoning of wells, desecration of hosts or kissing of the devil&#x27;s anus, were also made about heretical Christian sects, lepers, Muslims and Jews. The term is the same as the normal English word &quot;Sabbath&quot; (itself a transliteration of Hebrew &quot;Shabbat&quot;, the seventh day, on which the Creator rested after creation of the world), referring to the witches&#x27; equivalent to the Christian day of rest; a more common term was &quot;synagogue&quot; or &quot;synagogue of Satan&quot; possibly reflecting anti-Jewish sentiment, although the acts attributed to witches bear little resemblance to the Sabbath in Christianity or Jewish Shabbat customs. The &quot;Errores Gazariorum&quot; (&quot;Errors of the Cathars&quot;), which mentions the Sabbat, while not discussing the actual behavior of the Cathars, is named after them, in an attempt to link these stories to an heretical Christian group.

More recently, scholars such as Emma Wilby have argued that although the more diabolical elements of the witches&#x27; sabbath stereotype were invented by inquisitors, the witchcraft suspects themselves may have encouraged these ideas to circulate by drawing on popular beliefs and experiences around liturgical misrule, cursing rites, magical conjuration and confraternal gatherings to flesh-out their descriptions of the sabbath during interrogations.

Christian missionaries&#x27; attitude to African cults was not much different in principle to their attitude to the Witches&#x27; Sabbath in Europe; some accounts viewed them as a kind of Witches&#x27; Sabbath, but they are not. Some African communities believe in witchcraft, but as in the European witch trials, people they believe to be &quot;witches&quot; are condemned rather than embraced.

===Possible connections to real groups===

Other historians, including Carlo Ginzburg, Éva Pócs, Bengt Ankarloo and Gustav Henningsen hold that these testimonies can give insights into the belief systems of the accused. Ginzburg famously discovered records of a group of individuals in Northern Italy, calling themselves &quot;benandanti&quot;, who believed that they went out of their bodies in spirit and fought amongst the clouds against evil spirits to secure prosperity for their villages, or congregated at large feasts presided over by a goddess, where she taught them magic and performed divinations. Ginzburg links these beliefs with similar testimonies recorded across Europe, from the &quot;armiers&quot; of the Pyrenees, from the followers of Signora Oriente in fourteenth century Milan and the followers of Richella and &#x27;the wise Sibillia&#x27; in fifteenth century northern Italy, and much further afield, from Livonian werewolves, Dalmatian &quot;kresniki&quot;, Hungarian &quot;táltos&quot;, Romanian &quot;căluşari&quot; and Ossetian &quot;burkudzauta&quot;. In many testimonies, these meetings were described as out-of-body, rather than physical, occurrences.

===Role of topically-applied hallucinogens===


Carlo Ginzburg&#x27;s researches have highlighted shamanic elements in European witchcraft compatible with (although not invariably inclusive of) drug-induced altered states of consciousness. In this context, a persistent theme in European witchcraft, stretching back to the time of classical authors such as Apuleius,
is the use of unguents conferring the power of &quot;flight&quot; and &quot;shape-shifting.&quot; Recipes for such &quot;flying ointments&quot; have survived from early modern times, permitting not only an assessment of their likely pharmacological effects – based on their various plant (and to a lesser extent animal) ingredients – but also the actual recreation of and experimentation with such fat or oil-based preparations. Ginzburg makes brief reference to the use of entheogens in European witchcraft at the end of his analysis of the Witches Sabbath, mentioning only the fungi Claviceps purpurea and Amanita muscaria by name, and stating about the &quot;flying ointment&quot; on page 303 of &#x27;Ecstasies...&#x27; :
In the Sabbath the judges more and more frequently saw the accounts of real, physical events. For a long time the only dissenting voices were those of the people who, referring back to the &quot;Canon episcopi&quot;, saw witches and sorcerers as the victims of demonic illusion. In the sixteenth century scientists like Cardano or Della Porta formulated a different opinion : animal metamorphoses, flights, apparitions of the devil were the effect of malnutrition or the use of hallucinogenic substances contained in vegetable concoctions or ointments...But no form of privation, no substance, no &quot;&quot; can, by itself, cause the recurrence of such complex experiences...the deliberate use of psychotropic or hallucinogenic substances, while not explaining the ecstasies of the followers of the nocturnal goddess, the werewolf, and so on, would place them in a not exclusively mythical dimension.
– in short, a substrate of shamanic myth could, when catalysed by a drug experience (or simple starvation), give rise to a &#x27;journey to the Sabbath&#x27;, not of the body, but of the mind. Ergot and the Fly Agaric mushroom, while hallucinogenic, were not among the ingredients listed in recipes for the flying ointment. The active ingredients in such unguents were primarily, not fungi, but plants in the nightshade family Solanaceae, most commonly Atropa belladonna (Deadly Nightshade) and Hyoscyamus niger (Henbane), belonging to the tropane alkaloid-rich tribe Hyoscyameae. Other tropane-containing, nightshade ingredients included the Mandrake Mandragora officinarum, Scopolia carniolica and Datura stramonium, the Thornapple.
The alkaloids Atropine, Hyoscyamine and Scopolamine present in these Solanaceous plants are not only potent and highly toxic hallucinogens, but are also fat-soluble and capable of being absorbed through unbroken human skin.

<text>The  (; ) is the national anthem of Spain. It is one of only four national anthems in the world – along with those of Bosnia and Herzegovina, San Marino and Kosovo – that have no official lyrics. Although many different lyrics have been made for it in the past, it has never had official lyrics as a national anthem.
==History==
One of the oldest in the world, the Spanish national anthem was first printed in a document dated 1761 and entitled (&quot;Book of the Ordinance of Newly Played Military Fife and Drum Calls by The Spanish Infantry&quot;), by Manuel de Espinosa. There, it is entitled (). According to the document, Manuel de Espinosa de los Monteros is the composer.

There is a misconception that its author was Frederick II of Prussia, a great lover of music. That mistaken belief arose in 1861 when it was published as fact in the periodical (&quot;Military Spain&quot;). In 1864, Col. Antonio Vallecillo published the story in the diary (&quot;The Public Spirit&quot;), claiming a supposed Prussian origin for . According to Vallecillo, the anthem was a gift from Frederick II to the Count of Colomera, who was serving in the Prussian Court to learn the military tactics developed by Frederick II&#x27;s army, under orders of King Charles III. In 1868, this spurious history was published in , changing the beneficiary of the gift to the Count of Aranda. The myth was picked up in different publications of 1884 and 1903 until it was included in 1908 in the .

In 1770, Charles III declared the the official Honor March, an act that formalized the tradition of playing it in public, especially on solemn occasions. It became the official Spanish anthem during Isabel II&#x27;s reign.

In 1870, after the 1868 Revolution, General Juan Prim organized a national contest to create a new official state anthem, and a jury consisting of three well-known composers was chosen to designate a winning entry. Although over 400 compositions were submitted, including those written by the young composers Federico Chueca, Ruperto Chapí and Tomás Bretón, a new anthem was never selected. After extensive deliberations, the jury had advised that was already considered the country&#x27;s official anthem, and the contest was suspended. By Alfonso XIII&#x27;s time, the Royal Circular Order of 27 August 1908 established the musical score orchestrated by Bartolomé Pérez Casas, Superior musician of the Royal Corps of Halberdier Guards, as the official version; it is known traditionally as the &quot;Grenadier March&quot; or the &quot;Royal Spanish March&quot;. During the Spanish Second Republic the was adopted as the anthem of the republic.

The current symphonic version of the that replaced the Pérez Casas one was written by maestro Francisco Grau and is the official one after the Royal Decree of 10 October 1997, when the Kingdom of Spain bought the author rights of the , then belonging to Pérez Casas&#x27;s heirs. According to the Royal Decree 1560/1997, it should be in the key of B-flat major and a tempo of 76 bpm (♩=76), with a form of AABB and a duration of 52 seconds.

==Current version==
The current official version of , as described in Royal Decree 1560/1997, is a sixteen-bar long phrase, divided in two sections, each one is made up of four repeated bars (AABB form). Tempo is set to ♩= 76 and key to B-flat.

The long, complete version is the honors music for the King, while a shorter version without the repetitions is performed for the Princess of Asturias, the President of the Government of Spain, or during sporting events.

There are also three official arrangements: one for orchestra, another for military band, and a third for organ, written by Francisco Grau and requested by the Government of Spain. All in all, there are six different official adaptations, for each arrangement and length. They all were recorded by the Spanish National Orchestra and the Spanish Royal Guard Band as an official recording and released on compact disc for a limited period of time.

===Copyright issues===
As the harmonisation of was written by Pérez Casas in the early 20th century, the copyright has not yet expired. The government bought it from Pérez Casas&#x27; estate in 1997 for 130 million pesetas (781,315.734 euros) to avoid future legal problems. Until it expires, the copyright belongs to the Ministry of Culture and collecting societies charge copyright fees, which has led to criticism.

As a result, many different harmonisations have been devised by performers to avoid paying. Nonetheless, the rights to the 1997 Francisco Grau revision were transferred to the government at no charge, but they were not placed in the public domain.

==Music==
==Lyrics==
Though the has no official lyrics, words have been written and used for it in the past. One version was used during Alfonso XIII&#x27;s reign and another during the Francoist State; however, none of them were ever made official. The national anthem has been played without words since 1978 when lyrics that had been approved by General Francisco Franco were abandoned. Occasionally the Francoist lyrics have been erroneously performed after their abandonment.

===Lyrics competition===
After witnessing a rendition of &quot;You&#x27;ll Never Walk Alone&quot; at Anfield in 2007, the President of the Spanish Olympic Committee (COE), Alejandro Blanco, said he felt inspired to seek lyrics to ahead of Madrid&#x27;s bid to host the 2016 Olympic Games. That same year Telecinco, enticed by the COE, organized a national contest and posted 25 different lyrics on their website which they thought best matched COE&#x27;s requirements. The winner was chosen, although only 40,000 people voted. The lyrics by Enrique Hernández-Luike, magazine publisher and poet, spoke of freedom, peace and the Constitution. The winning lyrics were sung by the Ronda de Aranzueque choir in Pastrana, and filmed by German television. However, the COE organized a new competition for the lyrics, which resulted in between 2,000 and 7,000 entries (depending on source). A private team of jurors chose the entry by Paulino Cubero, then unemployed. The new lyrics received criticism, resulting in them being pulled only five days later, and the idea was scrapped indefinitely.

A number of the autonomous communities of Spain have their own regional anthems.

==Former lyrics==
===Lyrics during Alfonso XIII&#x27;s reign===
These lyrics were written by Eduardo Marquina (1879–1946) on the occasion of Alfonso XIII&#x27;s silver wedding anniversary. They were never made official.
&lt;poem lang=&quot;es&quot; style=&quot;margin-right:2em; float:left;&quot;&gt;La bandera de España (Coro)
Gloria, gloria, corona de la Patria,
soberana luz
que es oro en tu Pendón.
Vida, vida, futuro de la Patria,
que en tus ojos es
abierto corazón...!
Púrpura y oro: bandera inmortal;
en tus colores, juntas, carne y alma están.
Púrpura y oro: querer y lograr;
Tú eres, bandera, el signo del humano afán.

España guiadora (Solo)
¡Pide, España! ¡Tu nombre llevaremos
donde quieras tú;
que honrarlo es nuestra ley!
¡Manda, España, y unidos lucharemos,
porque vivas tú,
sin tregua pueblo y rey!
Una bandera gloriosa nos das;
¡nadie, viviendo, España, nos la arrancará!
Para que, un día, nos pueda cubrir,
¡danos, España, el gozo de morir por ti!

¡Viva España!... (Coro)
¡Viva España! Del grito de la Patria,
la explosión triunfal
abrió camino al sol;
¡Viva España! repiten veinte pueblos
y al hablar dan fe
del ánimo español...
¡Marquen arado martillo y clarín
su noble ritmo al grito de la Patria fe!
¡Guíe la mente a la mano hasta el fin,
al &quot;Viva España&quot; asista toda España en pie!&lt;/poem&gt;

&lt;poem style=&quot;float:left;&quot;&gt;Flag of Spain (Chorus)
Glory, glory, crown of the Fatherland
sovereign light
which in your standard is gold.
Life, life, future of the Fatherland,
in your eyes it is
an open heart
Purple and gold: immortal flag;
in your colors, together, flesh and soul are.
Purple and gold: to want and to achieve;
You are, flag, the sign of human effort.

Spain guiding (Solo)
Ask of us, Spain! Your name we will take
anywhere you want;
because honoring it is our law!
Command us, Spain, and united we will fight,
so that you may live,
relentless people and king!
You give us a glorious flag;
Nobody, who is alive, Spain, will take it from us!
So that, one day, we can be covered by it,
Give us, Spain, the joy of dying for you!

Long live Spain! ... (Chorus)
Long live Spain! The cry of the Fatherland,
the triumphant explosion
Has opened the way to the sun;
Long live Spain! repeated twenty peoples
and when they speak they have faith
in the Spanish will ...
Mark plow hammer and bugle
your noble rhythm at the cry of the Fatherland faith!
Guide the mind and the hand until the end,
the &quot;Long Live Spain&quot; Spain attends all standing!&lt;/poem&gt;

===Franco-era lyrics===
Lyrics were adapted from an earlier version on 1928 written by José María Pemán (1897–1981) during the reign of Alfonso XIII and the government of Miguel Primo de Rivera. The changes, made by Peman himself, intended to fit the symbols of the extreme right-wing ideology of General Francisco Franco, referred to as National Catholicism, which were the &quot;salute with the extended right arm&quot; and the &quot;yoke and arrows&quot;. The yoke and arrows were the appropriated symbol of Falangism in Spain.

There were no singular official lyrics at the time, though they became popular in certain contexts. In fact, the school textbook &quot;Enciclopedia Álvarez&quot; featured different lyrics that were taught to children.

==Interpretation and etiquette==
Military bands of the Spanish Armed Forces and the National Police Corps of Spain and civilian Marching bands and Concert bands play the B flat-major version of the anthem adapted for wind bands (as arranged by Francisco Grau), and playing the A major version is optional.

The bugle call &quot;To the Colors&quot; in Spain is the version played by Bugle bands in Spanish churches in religious occasions and processions organized by civil groups and the parishes. Various versions adapted for the drum and the bugle are used, even though brass instruments play the anthem as well. But in some bugle bands, the A flat version of the anthem (the old official one, adapted for the bugle) is played. Only a bugle call is sounded when the B flat version is played.

Being the national anthem, and played in honor of the King and the Queen of Spain, it is common for all to stand once it is played. Even though it is also played in church events, respect for the royal family is required by everyone in attendance; civilians stand at attention, and those in uniform salute when not in formation.
