<text>The Prince of Wales Bridge (), previously the Second Severn Crossing () until July 2018, is the M4 motorway bridge over the River Severn between England and Wales, opened in 1996 to supplement the traffic capacity of the Severn Bridge built in 1966. The bridge is operated by England&#x27;s National Highways. It has a total length of .

It is southwest of the Severn Bridge and because it is more closely in line with the rest of the M4, it reduces the length of the journey between England and Wales. The junctions at each end are designed for most traffic to use this crossing, and in order to use the old Severn Bridge, one has to leave the M4 at junction 21 and join the M48 near Aust or at junction 23 near Magor. The new crossing carries more traffic than the Severn Bridge, which is still in use. It is wider than the Severn Bridge, having three lanes and a narrow hard shoulder each way, compared to the two lanes, cycle path and narrow footpath of the original crossing. It is a cable-stayed bridge, whereas the Severn Bridge is a suspension bridge. The position of the bridge is close to that of the Severn Tunnel, which has carried the railway line beneath the river bed since 1886.

Much of the estuary is mudflats at low tide, but at high tide these can be covered by as much as of water. This presented the engineers with a constraint: packets of work were scheduled at low tide, and needed to be completed within the short windows allowed by the tides.

The concession given to the consortium which financed, built and operate the bridge required them to take over the outstanding debt on the original Severn Bridge and to operate the two bridges as a single entity. Tolls were set annually by the government based on the previous year&#x27;s change in the Retail Price Index. On the expiry of the concession in January 2018, the consortium was required to hand the bridge over to public ownership. The tolls on both bridges were subsequently scrapped in December 2018.

== Background ==
The Severn Estuary presented a barrier between the Bristol area and South Wales. The estuary has a maximum tidal range of , amongst the highest in the world, and during a rising or falling tide there are strong currents of up to . Much of the estuary is mud flats that are exposed at low tide; these have been designated a Special Protection Area. The central part of the estuary is a navigable channel which, at the site of the bridge, is known as &quot;The Shoots&quot;. The bridge is upstream from Avonmouth and the Port of Bristol, but downstream from the Port of Sharpness. The Gloucester Harbour Trustees have responsibility for controlling navigation in the estuary&#x27;s tidal waters upstream from the bridge.

Until 1966, road travellers could either use the Aust Ferry, which had operated since medieval times (and as a car ferry since 1926), or use the scheduled car shuttle train service through the Severn Tunnel between Pilning and Severn Tunnel Junction, which operated from 1926 until 1966. Otherwise, the detour via Gloucester would add to the journey. In 1966, the first Severn road bridge, a four-lane suspension bridge, was opened, carrying the M4 motorway between England and South Wales. By 1984, traffic across the first Severn Bridge had tripled and it was projected that by the mid-1990s, the old bridge would be running at capacity. A study was commissioned into building either a second bridge or a tunnel. The consultants reported back in 1986, recommending that a new bridge be built downstream from the existing bridge.

In 1988, it was announced that tenders would be invited from private consortia to fund, build and operate the bridge for a specified period. The consortium would also take over the management of the old bridge and the associated £100 million debt. Tenders were invited in 1989; and in 1990 the concession to build the bridge was awarded to Severn River Crossing plc. Construction work started on 26 April 1992 and the bridge was opened by Prince Charles (the future Charles III, then the Prince of Wales), on 5 June 1996.

== Design ==

The chief architect of the bridge was Ronald Weeks of the Cardiff-based Percy Thomas Partnership, with the detailed engineering design by the Halcrow Group and the French consultancy . The bridge has portals close to Sudbrook, Monmouthshire on the Welsh side and Severn Beach in South Gloucestershire on the English side. It has three principal sections – a 25 span viaduct on the English side of length , a 24 span viaduct of length on the Welsh side and the bridge itself, a structure with a navigational clearance, giving a total length of . The central section, called the Shoots Bridge, is of cable-stayed design and the central span (between the bridge pylons) is in length. The approach viaducts are of a segmental bridge design. The crossing forms a very slight reverse &quot;S&quot; curve – the roadway has an approximate east–west alignment at each of the portals, while the central bridge follows an alignment approximately WNW to ESE.

The Severn Railway Tunnel passes under the estuary bed on a line which is generally about upstream of the bridge, but which passes under the line of the bridge close to the English shore.

The deck, which carries three lanes of traffic in each direction, is wide. The sides of the bridge are fitted with baffle plates to reduce lateral wind loads coming from the Severn Estuary onto the traffic; this has reduced the number of times that speed restrictions have been needed. The overall design of the new crossing makes it more resistant to high winds than the old Severn Bridge.

A small diesel-powered monorail, the Rapid Access Train, runs underneath the full length of the crossing at a top speed of , and is used for safe access to ten stations, such as lifts inside the cable pylons, for bridge maintenance. It can carry up to four passengers plus two tonnes of equipment in its trailer, with an integral crane and safety features such as interlocks, emergency battery propulsion capable of returning to either end of the crossing, and a dead man&#x27;s switch. During the 1990s and early 2000s, the Rapid Access Train was initially disused for a number of years due to rail faults, but has subsequently been returned to service. Travelling access gantries are also present underneath each segment of the crossing to allow for inspection and maintenance across the full width of the structure, with hydraulic lift platforms capable of reaching multiple levels.

== Construction ==

The crossing was built by a business consortium under a public-private partnership. A company called Severn River Crossing plc, led by John Laing plc and GTM-Entrepose, was formed to build the new crossing. This company also took over the responsibility of managing and maintaining the old Severn Bridge crossing, as well as managing and maintaining the new crossing. The cost of constructing the new crossing was to be paid for by tolls collected from motorists using the two crossings. Work on the new crossing began in 1992. Completion was in 1996.

Sub-assemblies for the bridge were constructed onshore and then shifted by a large tracked vehicle (similar to that used to move the Apollo and Space Shuttle at Cape Kennedy) onto a barge (the SAR3), prior to being floated out on the high tide to the site. The 37 bridge pier foundations on the approach viaducts are apart, and consist of open concrete caissons weighing up to 2,000 tonnes, which were founded on the rock of the estuary bed. The decking consists of post-stressed match cast sections, weighing each.

The cable-stayed section of the crossing is over long, consisting of a wide deck made from steel plate girders with a composite reinforced concrete slab. These were prefabricated on shore and put in place using balanced cantilever methods. There are two high twin-leg, reinforced and pre-stressed concrete pylons carrying 240 cables which support the bridge deck, rising to a height of above the river bed or above the bridge deck. Cable vibrations were experienced during construction and secondary cables were added to eliminate this. To avoid detracting from the aesthetics of the primary cables, the secondary cables are very slender and are not very noticeable.

During the summer of 1994 the bridge deck launching gantry fell onto the Gwent viaduct, causing the bridge deck unit to fall onto the deck below. Although this delayed the project by ten weeks, the builders still completed the bridge on schedule two years later.

== Environmental impact ==

The crossing passes over mudflats in the Severn Estuary with part of the eastern approach viaduct sited on the English Stones, a rocky outcrop uncovered at low tide. The estuary wetlands are home to migrating birds such as the ringed plover, redshank and whimbrel, while the curlew, dunlin and grey plover winter in the area. The birds feed on ragworm, lugworm and other invertebrates. Saltmarsh is found along the fringes of the coast. Beds of eelgrass occur on the more sheltered mud- and sandbanks. In 1976, in recognition of the importance of the estuary as a wetland used by migrating birds, an area of was designated a Ramsar site. In 1988, the Severn Estuary was designated a Special Protection Area. The same year an area of was notified as a Site of Special Scientific Interest and designated as such the following year; in 1995, this was extended to cover the whole of the Ramsar site.

Prior to the bridge&#x27;s construction, environmentalists raised numerous concerns and criticisms, chiefly about the immediate damage from construction work and the effects of long-term pollution from a projected increase in car traffic. The construction process resulted in a temporary increase in turbidity of the Severn waters. Although eelgrass is reasonably tolerant to short-term high turbidity and consequent loss of light, the bed of eelgrass in the river was observed to decline considerably during the period of construction. The construction of the approach roads and toll plaza resulted in the permanent loss of some wet pastureland.

Field surveys carried out in 2003 and 2004 reported that the bridge had little effect on the flight paths of the various birdsit was noted that when curlews, dunlins and lapwings approached the bridge, they would change course to gain height and fly over the bridge, but that oystercatchers and turnstones would fly under the bridge. The surveys also showed that the bridge had minimal impact on the roosting habits of most birds, though a flock of mallards were seen to be roosting directly under the bridge, with many positioning themselves on the dry concrete base on one of the pillars. Likewise, it was noted that the bridge had little impact on the birds&#x27; feeding habitsturnstones and lapwings were recorded as feeding on mudflats directly under the bridge while the absence of other waders was attributed to the rocky nature of the foreshore.

== Finances ==
The consortium consisting of two civil engineering firms and two banks that funded and built the bridge had a 30-year concession to redeem its outlay from tolls collected from users of the bridge. At the end of the concession period in January 2018, the bridge passed into public ownership, and is now managed by National Highways.

=== Tolls ===

Tolls were collected from westbound traffic only, near Rogiet, in Wales. Tolls charges were based on a three-tier pricing system: Tolls could be paid by cash, major credit or debit cards, or by use of the Severn TAG system, which was a wireless electronic toll collection system that did not require vehicles to stop.

Motorcycles and UK disabled badge holders travelling in a vehicle were exempted from paying a toll.
Toll prices were reviewed annually on 1 January, in accordance with the Severn Bridges Act 1992 (c. 3).
In late 2008, UK VAT was reduced from 17.5% to 15%, but the bridge toll remained unchanged. For convenience the tolls were kept at round multiples of 10p (the bridge toll was largely paid in cash as card payments were not accepted until mid-2012), but the 13p VAT reduction was not passed on immediately. In 2009, the planned toll for cars would have been £5.50, as the announcements listed, but the actual toll charged was £5.40. George Osborne, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced in March 2015 that the tolls would be reduced to £5.40 in 2018, due to VAT being removed when the bridge comes into public ownership.

In the 2016 United Kingdom budget, Osborne announced that toll charges on the Severn crossings would be halved in 2018. The toll was due to be cut to £5.40 in 2017 but was increased.

It was reported in 2012 that the repayments were likely to continue until the early 2020s due to the introduction of a revised settlement to the operator in return for accepting payment by debit and credit cards. The announcement said that even after repayment was complete the toll charges would likely remain at the same levels. However, in July 2017 it was announced that the toll would be abolished,
In July 2017, the Welsh Secretary, Alun Cairns, announced that tolls would be scrapped at the end of 2018, claiming that this would boost the South Wales economy by around £100m a year. In September 2017, Cairns confirmed that tolls would be reduced in January 2018 as VAT is removed. As announced on 2 October 2018, tolls were abolished on 17 December 2018.

=== Historical toll charges ===

The toll levied was always identical to that on the Severn Bridge.

=== Funding and ownership ===
The bridge was built at a cost of £330 million (excluding VAT) and was owned by the company Severn River Crossing Plc.
As of , Severn River Crossing Plc was owned
*35% John Laing, British developer infrastructure operator
*35% Vinci, French concessions and construction company
*15% Bank of America, American multinational banking and financial services corporation
*15% Barclays Capital, British multinational investment bank

The company&#x27;s 2011 annual report showed the same companies still owned, through subsidiary companies, all the issued ordinary share capital of the Plc.

In 2012, changes were made to the agreement to reflect the effect of changes in VAT and Corporation Tax and the costs of installing credit card handling systems. The net effect was to increase the required revenue from £995.83 million to £1,028.91 million in 1989 prices.

Ownership of the crossing and the original Severn Bridge returned to the UK government on 8 January 2018, when the project&#x27;s required revenue, as defined in the Concession Agreement with the Secretary of State for Transport, had been collected. At that point, responsibility for operating the bridge passed to National Highways.

== Closures ==
On 6 February 2009, the bridge was closed due to bad weather for the first time since its opening, after a number of vehicles were hit by falling ice. Bad weather, and again falling ice, repeated this in December 2009. Temporary speed limits are put in place due to high winds or thick fog, with drivers informed by the electronic signs. Because of the more advanced aerodynamic design of the later bridge, the Second Crossing is far less prone to such restrictions caused by crosswinds than the first Severn Bridge.

On 18 February 2022, both the Prince of Wales Bridge and the Severn Bridge were closed during Storm Eunice, due to high winds. It was the first time that the Prince of Wales Bridge had been closed because of winds.

On 7 December 2024, both the Prince of Wales Bridge and the Severn Bridge were closed due to high winds from Storm Darragh.

== Renaming ==
On 5 April 2018, the Secretary of State for Wales, Alun Cairns, announced that the crossing would be renamed as the &quot;Prince of Wales Bridge&quot; at a ceremony later in the year. He said that the renaming would be &quot;a fitting tribute to His Royal Highness in a year that sees him mark 60 years as The Prince of Wales and decades of continued, dedicated service to our nation&quot;.

An online petition, heavily shared via social media, against the renaming had received more than 30,000 signatures by 8 April. Some politicians criticised the proposed renaming and the lack of public consultation on it, but it was confirmed that the First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, had raised no objection to the proposal. The bridge was formally renamed on 2 July 2018 where a plaque was unveiled by the Prince and the Duchess of Cornwall, which was followed by a reception for local dignitaries and business leaders at the nearby Celtic Manor Resort. There was no prior press release or other official communication from either the UK or Welsh Governments. The total cost for renaming the bridge, including the installation of two above road signs (and associated staffing costs to close the carriageways with and traffic diverted via the M48) along with the ceremony was £216,513.39.

<text>During World War II, Operation Narcissus was a raid by forty members of the Special Air Service on a lighthouse on the southeast coast of Sicily. The team landed on 10 July 1943 with the mission of capturing the lighthouse and the surrounding high ground.

Despite intelligence reports, the area was deserted, and so the position was no threat to the nearby Operation Husky landings. The troopers withdrew without a shot being fired.

<text>The LaFayette Motors Corporation was a United States–based automobile manufacturer. Founded in 1919, LaFayette Motors was named in honor of the Marquis de la Fayette, and LaFayette autos had a cameo of the Marquis as their logo.

==History==
LaFayette was originally headquartered in Mars Hill, Indianapolis, Indiana, and made luxury motor cars, beginning in 1920. LaFayette innovations include the first electric clock in an auto. However, the V8-powered LaFayette cars had low sales given their price of $5,000 when introduced in 1920, equal to $ today.

In 1921, Charles W. Nash became president of LaFayette. Nash was already president of Nash Motors, but for a time the two brands remained separate companies, although Nash Motors was the principal LaFayette Motors stock holder. The LaFayette was considered a halo marque.

In early 1920s, there was speculation about a merger of Pierce-Arrow with LaFayette, Rolls-Royce, or General Motors. A proposed merger with LaFayette did not occur in 1924. Ultimately, Studebaker took control of Pierce-Arrow in 1928.

In 1922, LaFayette&#x27;s facilities were moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

In 1924, Nash Motors became full owner of LaFayette Motors, and the name was retired soon after. Its factories were quickly put to a new, more profitable use: the manufacture of Ajax motor cars.

In 1934, Nash re-introduced the LaFayette name, this time for a line of smaller, less expensive models. Marketed at as “LaFayette Built By Nash&quot;, the cars included some Nash high-end features. They were well-engineered with &quot;conservatively attractive&quot; styling by Alexis de Sakhnoffsky. However, sales of the popular-priced cars did not meet expectations due to the general economic situation during the Great Depression. 

In 1935, Nash introduced a series known as the &quot;Nash 400&quot; to fill the perceived price gap between the LaFayette and the Nash. 

It was determined that this perceived gap was not so important, and that Nash Motors was marketing too many models. The LaFayette and the Nash 400 were combined into a single model called the Nash LaFayette 400 for the 1937 model year. The LaFayette ceased to be regarded as a separate make of car. The base price of $595 (equal to $ today) was competitive to Ford and Plymouth models. The Nash LaFayette 400 featured a longer wheelbase compared to the competition and included an advanced I6 engine with seven main bearings, larger brakes than even the Packard 6, as well as a &quot;seamless one-piece all-steel body&quot; which was the precursor to unitized-construction introduced to the mass-market by the 1941 Nash 600. The 400 was available a four-door sedan, two-door Victoria sedan, three- or (with rumble seat) five-passenger coupe, and a three-passenger Cabriolet.

For 1938, the model became simply the &quot;Nash LaFayette&quot;, and the LaFayette line continued as Nash&#x27;s lowest-priced offering through 1940. 

For 1941, the LaFayette was replaced by the all-new unibody Nash 600.

<doc id="254007" wikidata="Q287152" url="?curid=254007" title="Sap (EP)">
<text>Sap is the second studio EP by the American rock band Alice in Chains, released on February 4, 1992, through Columbia Records. &quot;Sap&quot; is mostly acoustic and marks the first time that guitarist Jerry Cantrell sings lead vocals in an Alice in Chains release, with the song &quot;Brother&quot;. The EP was produced by Alice in Chains and Rick Parashar and features guest vocals by Ann Wilson of the band Heart, Chris Cornell of Soundgarden and Mark Arm of Mudhoney. The track &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; became a hit two years later after being featured on the soundtrack to the 1994 film &quot;Clerks&quot;. On January 14, 1994, &quot;Sap&quot; was certified gold by the RIAA for the sale of more than 500,000 copies.

==Background and recording==
Following the tour for &quot;Facelift,&quot; Alice in Chains entered the studio to record a song for the Cameron Crowe movie &quot;Singles&quot;, but decided to turn the engagement to their advantage. As the guitarist Jerry Cantrell recalled: &quot;So in the session that was meant for recording that one song [&#x27;Would?&#x27;], we ended up demoing about 10 songs, which included all the stuff that ended up on the [1992] &quot;Sap&quot; EP, &#x27;Rooster&#x27; and a couple of others from &quot;Dirt&quot;.”

While in the studio, drummer Sean Kinney had a dream about &quot;making an EP called &quot;Sap.&quot;&quot; The band decided &quot;not to mess with fate,&quot; and &quot;Sap&quot; was recorded and mixed in 1991 with producer Rick Parashar at London Bridge Studio.

The EP was recorded in four or five days in November 1991.

==Music and lyrics==
Lead vocalist Layne Staley encouraged guitarist Jerry Cantrell to sing lead vocals on the EP. Cantrell sings lead vocals on &quot;Brother&quot; and splits lead vocals with Staley on &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot;.

The EP features guest vocals by Ann Wilson from the band Heart, who joined vocalist Layne Staley and guitarist Jerry Cantrell for the choruses of &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Am I Inside&quot;. It also features Mark Arm of Mudhoney and Chris Cornell of Soundgarden, who appeared together on the song &quot;Right Turn&quot;, credited to &quot;Alice Mudgarden&quot; in the liner notes. The song was featured in the 2001 film &quot;Black Hawk Down&quot;. It was guitarist Jerry Cantrell who invited Wilson, Cornell and Arm to sing on &quot;Sap&quot;.

Regarding the lyrical content, Cantrell said he wrote &quot;Brother&quot; about his relationship with his younger brother. The song specifically refers to the period after Cantrell&#x27;s parents divorced, when his younger brother went off to live with his father while he stayed with his mother, and Cantrell said that the song &quot;was a way of trying to build a bridge.&quot; Commenting on &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot;, Cantrell said he wrote the song about a relationship where one person thinks he or she can change the other person, and added that the song speaks of &quot;the different ways that men and women see each other.&quot;

A version of the song &quot;Rooster&quot; was recorded during the sessions for &quot;Sap&quot; and was to be included on the EP, but the band then decided to use the song on their second full-length album instead. This version is featured on the band&#x27;s 1999 box set &quot;Music Bank&quot;.

The hidden track, &quot;Love Song&quot;, described by Cantrell as &quot;the most bizarre song we&#x27;ve ever recorded&quot;, was Kinney&#x27;s idea. All four members switched instruments for the recording, with Kinney on lead vocals and piano, Starr on guitar, Cantrell on bass, and Staley on drums.

==Release and reception==
On February 4, 1992, Alice in Chains released their second EP, &quot;Sap.&quot; The band did not want any ads or promotion for the EP, they just put it in the stores to see if people would buy it. Cantrell said that Alice in Chains released &quot;Sap&quot; &quot;without any fuss or fanfare so as the real Alice fans could find it.&quot; The EP was released while Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Nevermind&quot; was at the top of the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 charts, resulting in a rising popularity of Seattle-based bands, and the term grunge music. &quot;Sap&quot; was soon certified gold.

The album was re-released on March 21, 1995, when &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; became a hit after its inclusion on the soundtrack to the 1994 film, &quot;Clerks.&quot; The re-released version included lyrics and slightly different artwork. The aforementioned song, as well as &quot;Brother,&quot; were performed live during Alice in Chains&#x27; &quot;MTV Unplugged&quot; concert.

In addition to the CD, the album was also released in a limited edition double vinyl along with &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; (&quot;Jar of Flies&quot; was on sides 1 and 2, &quot;Sap&quot; was on side 3, and an etching of the Alice in Chains logo was on side 4). In the UK, &quot;Sap&quot; and &quot;Jar of Flies&quot; were issued as a double CD, as &quot;Sap&quot; had not previously had a UK release. In the UK, &quot;Brother&quot; and &quot;Right Turn&quot; were initially released on the &quot;Would&quot; single and &quot;Got Me Wrong&quot; and &quot;Am I Inside&quot; were released on the &quot;Them Bones&quot; single. Hidden track &quot;Love Song&quot; never appeared on a UK single release and was previously unreleased when &quot;Sap&quot; was released with &quot;Jar of Flies&quot;.

<doc id="254009" wikidata="Q1158759" url="?curid=254009" title="Operation Ladbroke">
<text>Operation Ladbroke was a glider landing by British airborne troops during the Second World War near Syracuse, Sicily, that began on 9 July 1943 as part of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily. The first Allied mission using large numbers of the aircraft, the operation was carried out from Tunisia by glider infantry of the British 1st Airlanding Brigade, commanded by Brigadier Philip Hicks, with a force of 136 Hadrians and eight Airspeed Horsas. The objective was to establish a large invasion force on the ground near the town of Syracuse, secure the Ponte Grande Bridge and ultimately take control of the city itself with its strategically vital docks, as a prelude to the full-scale invasion of Sicily.

En route to Sicily, sixty-five gliders released too early by the American towing aircraft crashed into the sea, drowning approximately 252 men. Of the remainder, only eighty-seven men arrived at the Pont Grande Bridge, although they successfully captured the bridge and held it beyond the time they were to be relieved. Finally, with their ammunition expended and only fifteen soldiers remaining unwounded, the Allied troops surrendered to Italian forces. The Italians, having gained control of the bridge, sought to destroy the structure, but were frustrated by troopers of the 1st Airlanding Brigade who had removed the previously attached explosive charges. Other troops from the brigade, who had landed elsewhere in Sicily, aided further by destroying communications links and capturing gun batteries.

==Background==
By December 1942, with Allied forces advancing through Tunisia after landing there the month before in Operation Torch, the North African Campaign was coming to a close; with victory there imminent, discussions began among the Allies regarding the nature of their next objective. Many Americans argued for an immediate invasion of Northern France, while the British, as well as then-Lieutenant General Dwight D. Eisenhower, argued that the island of Sardinia was the best subsequent target of the Allied forces. In January 1943 the British Prime Minister Winston Churchill and U.S. President Franklin D. Roosevelt settled at the Casablanca Conference on the island of Sicily, whose invasion and occupation could potentially provide the Allies with Mediterranean shipping routes and airfields nearer to mainland Italy and Germany. The codename Operation Husky was decided upon for the Allied invasion of Sicily, and planning for &quot;Husky&quot; began in February. Initially the British Eighth Army, under the command of General Sir Bernard Montgomery, were to land on the south-eastern corner of the island and advance north to the port of Syracuse. Two days later the U.S. Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George S. Patton, would land on the western corner of the island and move towards the port of Palermo.

In March it was decided that the U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, and the British 1st Airborne Division, under Major-General George F. Hopkinson, would be dropped by parachute and glider just prior to the amphibious landings; they would land a few miles behind the beaches and neutralize their defenders, thereby aiding the landing of the Allied ground forces. However, in early May these directives were radically changed at the insistence of the Eighth Army commander, General Montgomery; he argued that with Allied forces landing separately at either end of the island, the defending Axis forces would have the opportunity to defeat each Allied army in turn before both could unite. Instead, the plans were altered to land both the Eighth and Seventh Armies simultaneously along a stretch of coastline on Sicily&#x27;s south-eastern corner. At the same time, the plans for the two airborne divisions, the British 1st and U.S. 82nd, were also adjusted; Montgomery believed that the airborne troops should be landed near Syracuse, so that they could seize the valuable port. The commander of the 82nd Airborne Division Artillery, Brigadier General Maxwell D. Taylor, further asserted that dropping behind the island&#x27;s beaches and overcoming its defences was not a suitable mission for the airborne troops, as they were only lightly armed and vulnerable to the &#x27;friendly fire&#x27; of the planned Allied naval bombardment. In the revised blueprint for the airborne divisions, a reinforced regimental combat team (the 505th Parachute Infantry, under Colonel James M. Gavin, with the 3rd Battalion of the 504th PIR and numerous other units attached) from Major General Ridgway&#x27;s U.S. 82nd Airborne Division would be dropped by parachute north-east of the port of Gela to block the movement of Axis reserves towards the Allied beachheads. Major General Hopkinson&#x27;s British 1st Airborne Division was now to conduct three brigade-size airborne operations: the Ponte Grande road bridge south of Syracuse was to be captured by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Philip Hicks, the port of Augusta was to be seized by Brigadier Ernest Down&#x27;s 2nd Parachute Brigade, and finally the Primasole Bridge over the River Simeto was to be taken and secured by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury&#x27;s 1st Parachute Brigade.

==Planning==

As there were insufficient transport aircraft for all three brigades to conduct their operations simultaneously, it was decided that the first operation would be &quot;Ladbroke&quot;, whose objective was the capture of the Ponte Grande Bridge. The mission, under the command of Brigadier Philip Hicks, was conducted just prior to the amphibious landings, on the night of 9 July, while the remaining two operations took place on successive two nights. The 1st Airlanding Brigade was also given the additional tasks of capturing Syracuse harbour and the urban area that adjoined it, and either destroying or confiscating a coastal artillery battery that was in range of the amphibious landings. When training began for the operation, difficulties immediately arose. The original plan for the airborne operations had called for all three to employ parachutists, but in May Montgomery altered the plan; after determining that airborne troops would be at a considerable distance from Allied ground forces, he believed that the force sent to capture Syracuse would be served best by gliders in order to provide them with the maximum possible amount of firepower. His airborne advisor, Group Captain Cooper of the Royal Air Force, argued that a glider landing conducted at night with inexperienced aircrews was not practical, but the decision was left unchanged.

Montgomery&#x27;s orders raised several issues, the first with the transport aircraft of the Troop Carrier Wings assigned to the airborne operations. When they had arrived in North Africa, it had been decided that the 52nd Troop Carrier Wing would operate with 1st Airborne Division and its counterpart, the 51st, with 82nd Airborne Division. A few weeks later this arrangement was switched, with the 52nd now operating with 82nd Airborne Division and the 51st with 1st Airborne Division; this seemed a logical decision, as each Wing had operational experience with the division it had been paired with. However, the decision to turn the Syracuse assault into a glider-based one was problematic; the 51st had practically no glider experience, whilst the 52nd had much more but was already training for a parachute-based mission. To switch both was impractical and would have led to a number of problems, which left 1st Airborne Division, and thus 1st Airlanding Brigade, with an inexperienced Troop Carrier Wing.

===Glider problems===
Further problems were encountered with the gliders to be used in the operation, and the glider pilots themselves. Until a few months prior to the operation, there was a notable shortage of serviceable gliders in North Africa. In late March a small number of Wacos arrived at Accra on the Gold Coast, but pilots sent to ferry them to North Africa found that they were in poor condition. Due to neglect and the deleterious effects of tropical weather, the pilots were able to assemble only a small number of Wacos and fly them back on 22 April. On 23 April, a larger number of the American gliders began to arrive in North African ports, but were not immediately available for use as the crates holding them were unloaded haphazardly, instructions were often found to be missing, and those men assigned to assemble the gliders were often inexperienced. However, when the decision was made to conduct a glider-borne assault with 1st Airlanding Brigade, assembly was improved, and by 12 June 346 gliders had been put together and delivered to the Troop Carrier Wings. A small number of Horsa gliders were transported to North Africa for use by the brigade. Thirty took off from England and undertook a trip of approximately in Operation Turkey Buzzard. After attacks from &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; fighter patrols and experiencing often turbulent weather, a total of 27 Horsas were delivered to North Africa in time for the operation.

When sufficient gliders had arrived in North Africa, however, they were not all usable even in training; on 16 June, most of the gliders were grounded for repairs, and on 30 June, large numbers of them had developed weaknesses in their tail-wiring, necessitating another grounding period of three days. Given these problems and delays, 51st Troop Carrier Wing was not able to conduct a large-scale glider exercise until mid-June. On 14 June, fifty-four Wacos were flown over and then released to land at an airfield, and a larger exercise was conducted on 20 June; but even these limited exercises were unrealistic, as they were conducted in broad daylight. The British glider pilots themselves also caused difficulties; although there were a sufficient number of them to conduct the operation, they were highly inexperienced. Detached from the Glider Pilot Regiment for the operation, they had no experience with the Waco gliders and night operations involving them, as British doctrine had deemed such operations impossible. On average, the pilots had eight hours of flight experience in gliders. Few were rated as being &#x27;operationally ready&#x27; and none had combat experience. Colonel George Chatterton, the commander of the Glider Pilot Regiment, had protested their participation as he believed they were entirely unfit for any operation. When the training period for the brigade ended with a total of two exercises completed, the glider pilots had an average of 4.5 hours training in flying the unfamiliar Waco, which included an average of 1.2 hours night flying.

===1st Airlanding Brigade===
The units of the 1st Airlanding Brigade were: the 1st Battalion, Border Regiment; 2nd Battalion, South Staffordshire Regiment; 181st (Airlanding) Field Ambulance and 9th Field Company, Royal Engineers. The Staffords were tasked with securing the bridge and the area to the south, while the Borders were to capture Syracuse. For the mission the 1st Airlanding Brigade were allocated 136 Waco and eight Horsa gliders. With the shortage of space in the gliders—Wacos could only accommodate fifteen troops, half that of the Horsa, thus the whole brigade could not be deployed. Six of the Horsas carrying &#x27;A&#x27; and &#x27;C&#x27; companies from the Staffords were scheduled to land at the bridge at 23:15 on 9 July in a coup-de-main operation. The remainder of the brigade would arrive at 01:15 on 10 July using a number of landing-zones between away, then converge on the bridge to reinforce the defence.

===Italian forces===
The Ponte Grande Bridge was immediately outside the area defended by the Italian 206th Coastal Division, which would oppose the British seaborne landing. The fortress commander was Rear Admiral Priamo Leonardi, with Colonel Mario Damiani in command of the army contingent. The Augusta-Syracuse Naval Fortress Area, which included the Coastal Division, was protected by six medium and six heavy coastal artillery batteries, with eleven additional dual-purpose coastal and anti-aircraft batteries, with six batteries only of anti-aircraft guns. Finally the Fortress contained an armoured train with four 120 mm guns. The army contingent was the 121st Coastal Defence Regiment, which included four battalions. There were also naval and air force battalions available, while the 54th Infantry Division &quot;Napoli&quot; was in a position to send reinforcements if required.
==Mission==
On 9 July, a contingent of 2,075 British troops, along with seven jeeps, six anti-tank guns and ten mortars, boarded their gliders in Tunisia and took off at 18:00, bound for Sicily. In the hours that preceded the landing, twelve Boeing B-17 and six Vickers Wellington equipped with radar jamming devices flew back and forth along the coast in the Siracusa-Licata sector; between 21:00 and 21:30, 55 Wellingtons of 205th Group carried out a diversionary bombing of the port and airport of Syracuse, causing a number of civilian and military casualties, including the commander of the Italian naval base, Commander Giuseppe Giannotti. 280 puppets dressed in paratrooper uniforms were launched north of the landing area, in order to deceive the Italian defense.
En route, the gliders encountered strong winds, poor visibility and at times were subjected to anti-aircraft fire. To avoid gunfire and searchlights, pilots of the towing aircraft climbed higher or took evasive action. In the confusion surrounding these manoeuvres, some gliders were released too early and sixty-five of them crashed into the sea, drowning around 252 men. Of the remainder, only twelve landed in the right place. Another fifty-nine landed up to away while the remainder were either shot down or failed to release and returned to Tunisia. About 200 American paratroopers, having been mistakenly parachuted in the area assigned to the Eighth Army, were captured by the Italian 146th Coastal Regiment (206th Coastal Division) in the early hours of 10 July.

Only one Horsa with a platoon of infantry from the Staffords landed near the bridge. Its commander, Lieutenant Withers, divided his men into two groups, one of which swam across the river and took up position on the opposite bank. Thereafter the bridge was captured following a simultaneous assault from both sides. The Italian defenders from the 120th Coastal Infantry Regiment abandoned their pillboxes on the north bank.

The British platoon then dismantled some demolition charges that had been fitted to the bridge and dug-in to wait for reinforcement or relief. Another Horsa landed roughly from the bridge but exploded on landing, killing all on board. Three of the other Horsas carrying the &quot;coup-de-main&quot; party landed within of the bridge—their occupants eventually finding their way to the site. Reinforcements began to arrive at the bridge, but by 06:30 they numbered only eighty-seven men.

Elsewhere, about 150 men landed at Cape Murro di Porco and captured a radio station. Based on a warning of imminent glider landings transmitted by the station&#x27;s previous occupants, the local Italian commander ordered a counter-attack but his troops failed to receive his message. The scattered nature of the landings now worked in the Allies&#x27; favour as they were able to cut all telephone wires in the immediate area. The glider carrying the brigade deputy commander, Colonel O. L. Jones, landed beside an Italian coastal artillery battery; at daylight the staff officers and radio operators attacked and destroyed the battery&#x27;s five guns and their ammunition dump. Other isolated groups of Allied soldiers tried to aid their comrades, assaulting Italian defences and targeting reinforcements. Another attack by a group of paratroopers on three 149/35 mm Italian coastal batteries failed, and the batteries were able to open fire on Allied landing craft and troops at 6:15 on 10 July. At 9:15, the 1st Battalion of the Italian 75th Infantry Regiment (&quot;Napoli&quot; Division) captured another 160 American paratroopers on the Palazzolo Acreide–Syracuse road. Another group of paratroopers attacked an Italian patrol led by Major Paoli, commander of the 126th Artillery Group; Paoli was killed and his unit fell in disarray, and was thus unable to intervene in the later fight against British tanks near the bridge.
The first counterattack on the bridge was by two companies of Italian sailors, who were repulsed by the British. As the Italians responded to the Allied landings, they gathered more troops and brought up artillery and mortars to bombard the Allied-controlled Pont Grande Bridge. The British defenders came under attack from the Italians while the expected British 5th Infantry Division relief did not appear at 10:00 as planned. At 11:30 the Italian 385th Coastal Battalion arrived at the bridge, followed soon afterward by the 1st Battalion, 75th (Napoli) Infantry Regiment. The Italians were positioned to attack the bridge from three sides. By 14:45 there were only fifteen British troops defending the bridge that had not been killed or wounded (four officers and eleven soldiers). At 15:30, with their ammunition consumed, the British stopped fighting. Some men on the south side of the bridge escaped into the countryside, but the rest became prisoners of war. With the bridge back in Italian hands, the first unit from 5th Infantry Division, the 2nd Battalion, Royal Scots Fusiliers, of 17th Infantry Brigade, arrived at the bridge at 16:15 and mounted a successful counter-attack, which had been made possible by the prior removal of demolition charges from the bridge, preventing its destruction by the Italians. The 1st Battalion of the 75th Infantry Regiment, having no artillery, was unable to oppose the British tanks and had to retreat after suffering heavy losses. The survivors from the 1st Airlanding Brigade took no further part in the fighting and were withdrawn back to North Africa on 13 July. During the landings, the losses by 1st Airlanding Brigade were the most severe of all British units involved. The casualties amounted to 313 killed and 174 missing or wounded. Fourteen accompanying glider pilots were killed, and eighty-seven were missing or wounded.

==Aftermath==
After an enquiry into the problems with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted recommendations in the aftermath of Operation Ladbroke. Aircrew were to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders were to be landed before the main force, to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified with complete brigades landing on a drop zone, instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used on Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water, and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following a friendly fire incident over an Allied convoy, more training was given to ship&#x27;s crews in aircraft recognition; Allied aircraft were also painted with three large white stripes. Training for pilots of the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased, and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery by air, the Royal Air Force started experimenting with how to use parachutes to drop them into combat, the jeeps and guns being carried in aircraft&#x27;s bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46, was formed and equipped solely with Douglas Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. Together, the Royal Air Force groups were capable of supplying eighty-eight Albermarles, eighty-eight Stirlings, thirty-six Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes which did not include aircraft held as reserves.

<text>The Poetry Bookshop operated at 35 Devonshire Street (now Boswell Street) in the Bloomsbury district of central London, from 1913 to 1926. It was the brainchild of Harold Monro, and was supported by his moderate income.

The Bookshop not only sold, but also published, poetry by living poets. Readers were encouraged to browse, and several poets actually made their home there, including Wilfred Owen, Wilfrid Wilson Gibson and Robert Frost. The atmosphere was welcoming, and the shop&#x27;s best-sellers were hand-coloured rhyme sheets for children.

During World War I, when Monro was serving in the armed forces, the shop was run almost single-handed by his assistant, Alida Klementaski, whom he later married.

Among the works published by the Poetry Bookshop were collections by Charlotte Mew and Richard Aldington and the &quot;Georgian Poetry&quot; series as well as Ezra Pound&#x27;s seminal 1914 anthology &quot;Des Imagistes&quot;.

Penelope Fitzgerald for quite a few years attempted to interest a publisher in a book on the shop. Her letters reveal the amount of work she did, some of which was useful to her when she wrote her biography of Charlotte Mew.

<text>Operation Fustian was an airborne forces operation undertaken during the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943 in the Second World War. The operation was carried out by Brigadier Gerald Lathbury&#x27;s 1st Parachute Brigade, part of the British 1st Airborne Division. Their objective was the Primosole Bridge across the Simeto River. The intention was for the brigade, with glider-borne forces in support, to land on both sides of the river. They would then capture the bridge and secure the surrounding area until relieved by the advance of British XIII Corps, which had landed on the south eastern coast three days previously. Because the bridge was the only crossing on the river and would give the British Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, its capture was expected to speed the advance and lead to the defeat of the Axis forces in Sicily.

Many of the aircraft carrying the paratroopers from North Africa were shot down or were damaged and turned back by friendly fire and enemy action. Evasive action taken by the pilots scattered the brigade over a large area and only the equivalent of two companies of troops were landed in the correct locations. Despite this and the defence by German and Italian forces, the British paratroops captured the bridge, repulsed attacks and held out against increasing odds until nightfall. The relief force led by the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division, under Major-General Sidney C. Kirkman, which was short of transport, were still away when they halted for the night. By this time, with casualties mounting and supplies running short, the parachute brigade commander, Gerald Lathbury, had relinquished control of the bridge to the Germans. The following day the British units joined forces and the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, with tank support, attempted to recapture the bridge. The bridge was not finally secured until three days after the start of the operation, when another battalion of the Durham Light Infantry, led by the paratroopers, established a bridgehead on the north bank of the river.

The capture of Primosole Bridge did not lead to the expected rapid advance, as by this time the Germans had gathered their forces and established a defensive line. It was not until early the following month that the Eighth Army captured Catania. By this time the 1st Parachute Brigade had been withdrawn to Malta and took no further part in the conquest of Sicily. Lessons were learned from the operation and were later put into practice in future Allied airborne operations.

==Background==
After the Axis powers were defeated in North Africa, the Allied armies&#x27; next logical objective was to cross the Mediterranean, landing in either the south of France, the Balkans, Sicily or Italy. The objective chosen was Sicily, with the landing scheduled for 10 July 1943. The Allied 15th Army Group, commanded by General Sir Harold Alexander, consisted of the American Seventh Army, commanded by Lieutenant General George Patton, which would land in the west between Licata and Scoglitti, and the veteran British Eighth Army, commanded by the experienced General Bernard Montgomery, which would land in the south east between Cape Passero and Syracuse.

In addition to the seaborne landings, there were also airborne landings during the invasion. The U.S. 82nd Airborne Division, under Major General Matthew Ridgway, would land in support of the Seventh Army, while the British 1st Airborne Division, under Major General George Hopkinson, conducted brigade-sized landings along the eastern coast to support the Eighth Army.

The first British airborne landing was Operation Ladbroke, which was carried out by the 1st Airlanding Brigade, under Brigadier Philip Hicks, during the night of 9–10 July. Their objective was to seize and hold the Ponte Grande bridge just outside Syracuse. The second British airborne mission, Operation Glutton, was to have been undertaken by the 2nd Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Ernest Down, on the night of 10–11 July, aiming to capture a bridge beside Augusta. However circumstances changed and the second operation was cancelled.

The third British airborne mission planned was Operation Fustian, to be carried out by the 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Gerald Lathbury, and scheduled for the night of 13–14 July. The 1st Parachute Brigade&#x27;s objective was the Primosole bridge, crossing the Simeto River, south of Catania. The bridge was a vital objective, as it was the only crossing point over the Simeto. Its capture would give the Eighth Army access to the Catania plain, to enable them to continue their advance northwards; its destruction would seriously hamper the advance. Once the parachute brigade had captured the bridge, they would then have to defend it until relieved by units of the Eighth Army advancing from the landing beaches.

===British forces===
The 1st Parachute Brigade, under Brigadier Lathbury, comprised the 1st, the 2nd and 3rd Parachute Battalions, the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, the 1st (Parachute) Squadron, Royal Engineers and the 1st (Airlanding) Anti-Tank Battery, Royal Artillery. The airlanding anti-tank battery were equipped with the 1st Para Brigade&#x27;s only anti-tank guns, the British 6 pounder. Despite the formation being a parachute brigade, the only way to transport the anti-tank guns and the jeeps required to pull them when they had landed, was by glider. Transporting artillery by air was something new to the British or any other army, and this would be the first time that any artillery guns had ever been flown into combat.

The 1st Parachute Brigade was an experienced formation, initially under command of the 1st Airborne Division before being detached from the division to fight in North Africa. The brigade had taken part in the landings in Algeria in November 1942 and the subsequent Battle of Tunisia, during which each of the brigade&#x27;s three parachute battalions had taken part in their own battalion-sized parachute landings. It was during this campaign that the 1st Parachute Brigade had been given their nickname the &quot;Red Devils&quot; by the Germans. A British parachute battalion had an establishment of 556 men in three rifle companies. Each of the companies were divided into a small headquarters and three platoons. The platoons had three sections; each section had a Bren light machine gun and a 2-inch mortar as well as the men&#x27;s own personal weapons. The only heavy weapons in the parachute battalion were in the 3-inch Mortar platoon and the Vickers machine gun platoon which were part of the battalion headquarters.
It was decided that the brigade&#x27;s paratroops would land on four separate drop zones and that the gliders would land at two landing zones. The paratroops of the 1st Parachute Battalion were divided into two groups, one of which would land at &#x27;Drop zone One&#x27; to the north of the river, and the second at &#x27;Drop zone Two&#x27; to the south of it. Once they had landed the two groups would head for their assembly points, before conducting an assault on the bridge from both sides simultaneously. The 2nd Parachute Battalion were to be landed south of the bridge on &#x27;Drop zone Three&#x27;, in the area between the Gornalunga Canal and the main highway. The 2nd Battalion then had to assault and occupy three small hills, which had been given the codenames &#x27;Johnny I&#x27;, &#x27;Johnny II&#x27; and &#x27;Johnny III&#x27;. The hills were believed to be occupied by an Italian force of around platoon strength. Once the battalion had secured the three hills, they were to dig in and prepare to defend the hills against an attack from the south. The 3rd Parachute Battalion would land at &#x27;Drop zone Four&#x27;, north of the bridge. Their objective was to secure the ground in this area, defending against any counterattack from the direction of Catania. The brigade&#x27;s glider force had two landing areas, &#x27;Landing zone Seven&#x27; north of the river and &#x27;Landing zone Eight&#x27; south of the river. Owing to the complexity of the landing plan and the short time between inception and execution, the pathfinders belonging to the 21st Independent Parachute Company, Army Air Corps, would be deployed to mark the correct drop zones. This was the first occasion this had been done in British airborne operations. The pathfinder company had special marker lights and Rebecca and Eureka beacons that the transport aircraft and gliders would be able to identify and home in on.

The senior officers of the 1st Airborne Division had estimated that there would be around 450 casualties during the capture of the bridge, of which 25 per cent would be killed or missing, and the other 75 per cent wounded. It was appreciated that by themselves the three battalions&#x27; medical officers and staff would be unable to cope with the expected numbers of casualties, so one section from the 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance, consisting of one doctor and 16 other ranks, would be attached to each of the parachute battalions. The remainder of the field ambulance, comprising the headquarters with two surgical teams, would be co-located with the brigade and establish their main dressing station in farm buildings to the south of the bridge.

After problems with the first two airborne operations in Sicily, the Royal Air Force advisor assigned to the 1st Airborne Division suggested that the American C-47 pilots adopt the Royal Air Force bomber stream formation. This entailed the aircraft flying in pairs one behind the other with one minute between each aircraft, instead of flying in their normal &#x27;V&#x27; formation. The suggestion was dismissed by the American pilots, who were mostly pre-war airline pilots, not least because their training had not included any instruction in night time navigation and the inexperienced crews relied heavily on following the aircraft in front.

Unconnected with Operation Fustian, but being conducted at the same time, No. 3 Commando would carry out a separate operation to the south of the Simeto River. The commando unit were to carry out an amphibious landing from the sea, then assault and capture the Malati Bridge over the Leonardo River.
The relieving force for both the commandos and paratroopers would be from British XIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant-General Miles Dempsey. The corps consisted of the 5th Infantry Division, 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division and the 4th Armoured Brigade. The armoured brigade, with three tank regiments, was equipped with the American built Sherman tank. Early on 13 July the commander of the 50th Division, Major-General Sidney Kirkman, was called to General Montgomery&#x27;s Eighth Army headquarters. Here he was informed about the two missions by the British Commandos and the 1st Parachute Brigade, and the requirement for the bridges to be captured intact. Montgomery&#x27;s intention was for the 50th Division to lead the Eighth Army&#x27;s advance and relieve the commandos and the paratroopers. To assist Kirkman in the task, Montgomery placed the 4th Armoured Brigade under his command. Montgomery was insistent that he wanted the infantry division to relieve the parachute brigade early on 14 July, which would require the division to advance around in 24 hours. The 50th Division had landed on 10 July and by this time had been fighting for three days non-stop. With the daily temperature most of the time reaching , many of the men in the division were physically exhausted and suffering from heat exhaustion. The division&#x27;s situation was not improved by a grave error of judgement by Montgomery. During the planning for the invasion, he had overestimated the strength of the German and Italian resistance to the Allied landings. The British Eighth Army consisted mainly of infantry, tanks and heavy weapons but were light on any form of mechanical transport, so any advance by the 50th Division would have to be conducted on foot.

===Axis forces===
The Italian Army force in the area of Primosole Bridge came from the 213 Coastal Division commanded by General Carlo Gotti. Coastal divisions were second line divisions, usually formed from men in their forties and fifties, and were intended to perform labour or other second line duties. Recruited from the local population, their officers were mostly men who had retired but had then been called up again. Their morale was low, not least because of their second rate equipment and weapons. It had been intended to improve their armaments with equipment seized from the recently disbanded Vichy French army, but when the arms arrived in Sicily, many of them had been made unusable, and some had the wrong type of ammunition or no ammunition at all.
The Italians were supported by German paratroopers of the 1st Parachute Division, who were ordered to move to Sicily from France, and if necessary were to parachute in on 9 July. The 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion commanded by Major Werner Schmidt had landed at Catania during an Allied air raid early on 13 July. Their aircraft and anti-tank guns were destroyed during the raid, so the battalion left on foot for Primosole Bridge. When Schmidt informed the divisional commander of his intentions, he was warned to expect a sea or airborne landing that night. If the Allies landed to the rear of the division, Schmidt&#x27;s battalion had to hold Primosole Bridge so that the division could escape. Forewarned in this way, the machine gun battalion started to dig in and prepare a defence around to the south of the bridge once they arrived, well located to deal with any parachute or glider landing in that area.

===Primosole Bridge===
The Primosole Bridge is built from steel girders. It has a span of , and is raised above the Simeto River. The land to the north of the bridge is mainly olive and almond groves in tree-lined fields. Immediately to the south of the bridge is the Gornalunga canal, and beyond that three prominent hills. The road crossing the bridge is Highway 114, running from Lentini to the south to Catania to the north. To assist the Italians defending the bridge, four pillbox bunkers had been constructed, two on the north bank and two on the south bank.

==Fustian==
At 19:30 on 13 July 1943, the first aircraft carrying the 1,856 men of the 1st Parachute Brigade took off from North Africa. The aircraft used consisted of 105 Douglas C-47 Skytrains belonging to the 51st Troop Carrier Wing, 51 each from the 60th and the 62d Troop Carrier Groups, while the 64th Troop Carrier Group supplied the other three. No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force supplied eleven Armstrong Whitworth Albemarles. Following behind the parachute force were the glider towing aircraft. These aircraft, again supplied by No. 38 Wing, comprised 12 Albemarles and seven Handley Page Halifaxes, towing 11 Horsa gliders and eight Waco gliders. The gliders were used to carry 77 men, mostly from the anti-tank battery, ten 6 pounder anti-tank guns and 18 jeeps.
The aircraft&#x27;s flight path took them around the south eastern corner of Malta and up the eastern coast of Sicily. The route was measured to ensure that the first planes arrived over the drop zones at 22:20. When the planes arrived off Sicily, they were supposed to stay offshore until reaching the Simeto River, when they would head inland for the drop zones. Somehow, 33 aircraft strayed off course and approached an Allied convoy. The naval gunners had been warned to expect an air raid, and opened fire on the American and British aircraft. Two of the planes, trying to avoid the unexpected anti-aircraft fire, collided and crashed into the sea. Another two were shot down, and nine were so badly shot up, with wounded crew and passengers, that they were forced to turn back towards their airfields in North Africa.

Those aircraft that did reach the Sicilian coast were engaged by Axis anti-aircraft guns, which shot down 11 of them. Another ten were damaged and were forced to abort their mission. Some of the inexperienced pilots now refused to go any further, and on his aircraft Lieutenant Colonel Alastair Pearson, commanding officer of the 1st Parachute Battalion, realising his plane was flying round in circles, had to threaten to shoot the crew to make them continue. The anti-aircraft fire and the evasive action taken by the pilots had dispersed the aircraft formations, and the parachute drop was scattered over a large area. The violent evasive manoeuvring left some of the paratroopers in heaps on the aircraft floor, and they were unable to jump when ordered. When safely back out to sea, some of the pilots refused to try again, considering the risk too great. Of the surviving aircraft which carried on with the mission, only 39 managed to drop their paratroops within of the correct drop zone. The furthest off course were some groups from the 3rd Parachute Battalion and Royal Engineers who landed to the south of the bridge, while another four aircraft landed their paratroops on the slopes of Mount Etna to the north.

Those men of the 1st Parachute Brigade that landed on the southern drop zone were well within range of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion. In the darkness, the Germans initially thought that the paratroopers were their own reinforcements landing, but they soon realised their mistake and opened fire. Some of those who escaped the machine gun fire were rounded up on the drop zone, and about 100 of them became prisoners of war as soon as they had touched ground. In the confusion of the landing, 50 men of the 1st Parachute Battalion had assembled, assaulted and managed to capture the bridge before the 50 Italian defenders could destroy it with the attached demolition charges. The Italians were taken prisoner, just as a second group of 40 paratroopers led by Brigadier Lathbury arrived at the bridge. Lathbury organised the safe removal of the demolition charges and set up a defensive perimeter. More paratroopers continued to gather at the bridge, and soon they numbered around 120 men, who dug in to the north and south.

The Brigade Headquarters and the field ambulance main dressing station were established to the south of the bridge, where the brigade&#x27;s casualties started arriving for treatment. Away from the main dressing station, the medics on the 2nd Battalion drop zone had 29 wounded as a result of the parachute drop, and there were 15 wounded on drop zone one from the 1st Battalion.
The first glider casualties had occurred on takeoff, when two aircraft towing Waco gliders crashed. While en route, one of the gliders was released early by its towing aircraft, and crashed into the sea. When they did arrive over Sicily, the element of surprise was gone, and four gliders were shot down by the coastal anti-aircraft batteries. By the time the gliders arrived at their landing zones, two hours had lapsed since the parachute landings had started. One glider pilot later commented that they did not need the pathfinders, as the tracer and lights from explosions were brighter than any of the landing markers. Of the surviving glider force, only four gliders managed to land relatively unscathed, all the others being caught by the Fallschirmjäger machine gun fire and destroyed on their approach. The four intact gliders had been carrying three of the anti-tank guns, which were now included in the bridge&#x27;s defences. Including the men from the gliders, the 1st Parachute Brigade had 295 men at the bridge. Shortage of manpower was not their only problem; their only support weapons were the anti-tank guns, two 3-inch mortars and a Vickers machine gun.

===Daybreak===
By 04:30 on 14 July, the 1st Parachute Battalion was in control of Primosole Bridge, but the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion were well dug in to the south. Beyond them, 140 men of the 2nd Parachute Battalion had occupied the three small hills, and taken 500 Italian prisoners. In numbers, both battalions had little more than company strength. The 3rd Parachute Battalion had suffered the worst in the scattered parachute drop, and only a few of their men had arrived at the bridge. With no command structure, they were attached to the 1st Parachute Battalion to help defend the bridge. To the north, the Italian 372nd Coastal Battalion and the 10th Arditi Regiment had been informed of the parachute landings. Many of the 372nd Battalion had disappeared, while the Arditi mounted the first of a number of attacks on the British positions. Without the support of any heavy weapons, they were easily fought off.
Also at dawn the first attack by the Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion to the south began, when they opened fire with their machine guns and mortars. Their first assault was against the 2nd Parachute Battalion&#x27;s positions, and was unsuccessful. However, their next assault, later in the morning, succeeded in capturing Johnny II, the second of the small hills. Lieutenant Colonel John Frost, in command of the 2nd Parachute Battalion, immediately counterattacked, but his men were repulsed after sustaining a number of casualties. At 09:00 a forward observation officer attached to the 2nd Parachute Battalion managed to make radio contact with the British cruiser HMS &quot;Newfoundland&quot;, which then used its 6-inch guns to target the Fallschirmjäger positions. The naval gunfire had the desired effect, causing the Germans some casualties and keeping them under cover. From then on, German resistance from the south was restricted to harassing machine gun fire. A grass fire they started did force the 2nd Parachute Battalion to abandon Johnny I, and the remnants of the battalion now concentrated on Johnny III.

To the north of the bridge, a German scratch-built battle group of 350 men, including the 1st Company, 1st Fallschirmjäger Signal Battalion, an anti-aircraft battery and some anti-tank guns, was gathered under the command of Captain Franz Stangenberg, supported by the 113rd Light Trucks Company of the 10th Arditi Regiment (the &quot;Commandos&quot; unit of the Italian Army) with 56 men and six heavily armed SPA-Viberti AS.42, Stangenberg was in position to launch his first assault on the bridge at 14:00. This first attack was driven off by the British paratroopers. For his second attempt Stangenberg brought up three 88 mm anti-aircraft guns in support. This assault was more successful, taking some prisoners, and almost succeeded in reaching the bridge. It also secured a position for the 88s to engage the two pillboxes on the north bank. By 17:00 the men of the 1st Parachute Battalion were almost out of ammunition, and were forced to withdraw to the southern side of the bridge. The German 88s were moved forward again, and this time demolished the pillboxes on the south side. Running short of supplies and with his casualties mounting, Brigadier Lathbury made the decision to relinquish control of the bridge to the Germans, and the parachute brigade moved back . Of the 295 men who had been at the bridge, 115 had become casualties. The 16th (Parachute) Field Ambulance main dressing station could not be moved or evacuated, and remained behind in no man&#x27;s land.

An Italian officer entered the station, and informed the medical staff they were now prisoners of war, but since they were treating casualties from both sides, they were allowed to remain and continue operating. Treatment of the wounded continued all day, and by 22:00 the surgeons had carried out 21 surgical operations and were looking after 62 British and 29 German or Italian patients. At 18:30, in the darkness, Lathbury led the remainder of his men to join the 2nd Parachute Battalion.

During the night of 14–15 June, the Italians mounted several counterattacks with an armoured car squadron (under Captain Paradisi Romolo) reinforced with Blackshirt Commandos aboard the motorized column penetrating the British sector and in a suicidal raid very nearly overran the headquarters of 9th Battalion, the Durham Light Infantry. Another column of armoured cars crossed Primasole Bridge and attacked the 98th Field Regiment Royal Artillery that had only recently having arrived in the area but the Italians were defeated at the intersection of the Lentini and Scordia roads and Semoventes from the 4th Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion, truck-borne infantry and supporting motorcycle companies from &quot;Gruppo Tattico Carmito&quot; (under Lieutenant-Colonel Francesco Tropea) attacked the British 124th Field Artillery Regiment but were unable to repeat their success obtained at Malati Bridge against No. 3 Commando (under Lieutenant Colonel John Durnford-Slater) and suffered a crushing defeat. British war correspondent Evelyn Aubrey Montague reported that several Italians units had indeed fought hard for Primosole Bridge, &quot;While some dropped behind enemy lines and rounded up a large number of Italian prisoners ... the main body captured the bridge and held it all yesterday against tremendous odds. For nearly 24 hours, they were shelled, under mortar fire, strafed from the air, and attacked on the ground by seven Italian battalions. There were less than 200 of them to resist this continuous onslaught, but they held out stubbornly, knowing that behind them our infantry were fighting, furiously to come to their aid.&quot;

By dawn, the 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division had only managed to advance , and were still from No. 3 Commando at the Melati bridge and from Primosole Bridge. It was not until 17:00 that the 5th Battalion, East Yorkshire Regiment, part of the 69th Infantry Brigade, eventually reached Malati Bridge, although by now the commandos had been forced to withdraw after being overwhelmed during what proved to be largely an Italian counterattack from &quot;Gruppo Tattico Carmito&quot; comprising the 4th Self-Propelled Artillery Battalion (under Lieutenant-Colonel Francesco Tropea), the 553rd (under Captain Giovanni Sartor) and 554th (under Captain Fausto Clementi) Motorcycle Companies on 13 July. The bridge was quickly captured; the commandos had dismantled the demolition charges so that it could not be demolished. With their first objective secured, the British infantry continued their advance on foot towards the parachute brigade. The tanks and small amount of motor transport belonging to the 4th Armoured Brigade had been held up even further back. They had been stopped in Carlentini by a destroyed bridge, and the 4th Armoured Brigade did not start moving again until after 19:00.

The 50th (Northumbrian) Division eventually reached Lentini, about halfway from their start point to Primosole Bridge, in the afternoon. Here the streets were blocked by debris, covered by snipers and machine gunners left as a rearguard by the retreating Germans. By nightfall only one of the 50th (Northumbrian) Division&#x27;s infantry battalions, the 6th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, of 151st Infantry Brigade, with some tanks in support, had reached a position from Johnny II. Despite their orders to advance at all speed, they halted for the night.

===Recapture of the bridge===
After the parachute brigade withdrew, the Axis forces gathered at the bridge. They now comprised the remnants of the 372nd Coastal Battalion (under Major Nino Bolla) in the form of two fire support companies and one rifle company and one Blackshirt Commando Battalion(under Major Vito Marciano) and gunners from the 29th Artillery Battalion that arrived from Catania as much needed riflemen for Major Bolla, with this Italian force fighting alongside the German 1st Fallschirmjäger Machine Gun Battalion and Captain Stangenberg&#x27;s Battle Group. The German High Command was aware of the importance of holding the bridge, and overnight they dispatched reinforcements who arrived by parachute. These came from the 1st Fallschirmjäger Division, and consisted of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion, the 1st Battalion, 4th Fallschirmjäger Regiment and a battalion of the 1st Fallschirmjäger Artillery Regiment. The Fallschirmjäger engineers started to form a defensive line to the north of the bridge, and a smaller one on the southern bank.
Early on 15 July, the 1st Parachute Brigade heard tank fire to the south of their position. Brigadier Lathbury sent out a patrol to investigate, which located the tanks and infantry of XIII Corps that had halted just south of them the previous night. The 1st Parachute Brigade and 50th (Northumbrian) Division now moved forward together. The main dressing station, which had continued to operate after being captured, was liberated by the 2nd Parachute Battalion. In an attempt to recapture Primosole Bridge the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry, supported by the 44th Royal Tank Regiment, carried out a number of costly assaults in the face of withering fire from the German and Italian defenders resulting in 100 British casualties, including 34 killed. At one stage they managed to cross the bridge, but three Sherman tanks accompanying them were knocked out by the German 88s, and with no armoured support the infantry were forced to withdraw. However, an error in communication caused the Fallschirmjäger Engineer Battalion to withdraw to the north bank of the river, and this allowed the Durhams to establish a position at the southern end of the bridge. At the main dressing station the surgeons had operated on another 14 wounded by the time ambulances arrived from XIII Corps at 17:00 to evacuate the wounded. At 18:00 the Main Dressing Station was closed and the men moved to Johnny I. During the time the main dressing station had been active, the surgeons had completed 31 operations, and the medics had treated 109 wounded.

The Germans were aware that the British paratroopers had dismantled the explosive charges attached to Primosole Bridge, and now attempted to destroy it by driving trucks laden with explosives onto it. This was unsuccessful.

During the night the 9th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry continued trying to capture the bridge. Their attacks also provided a distraction for the Germans while Lieutenant Colonel Pearson of the 1st Parachute Battalion led two companies of the 8th Battalion, Durham Light Infantry across the Simeto River using a small ford to establish another bridgehead on the northern bank. During the day&#x27;s battle both the British and Germans suffered heavy casualties, but the bridge was eventually retaken by the British infantry.

The remaining machine-gunners, mortar-men and protecting rifle teams from the 372nd Coastal Battalion and the reinforcements from the 29th Artillery Battalion sent to their assistance, held their ground until Major Bolla discovered that the neighbouring Fallschirmjäger unit had retreated without informing them of the planned German withdrawal. Bolla was nevertheless able to extricate his forces and escape the British encirclement.

Leaving the British Eighth Army to continue their advance, at 07:00 16 July the 1st Parachute Brigade were transported in trucks to Syracuse, where they embarked on a LST. Here they remained overnight, sitting through a two-hour air raid, and sailed for Valletta at 12:00 on 17 July. In Operation Fustian they had suffered around 141 dead, and 168 missing or wounded.

==Aftermath==
The operation was successful in the end; though narrow in victory in part because of the uncoordinated and ill-controlled friendly anti-aircraft fire. Only forty percent of the 5,000 paratroopers dropped had landed near their assigned drop zones. The recapture of Primosole Bridge did not result in the rapid advance over the Catania plain envisioned by Montgomery. The by now exhausted 50th (Northumbrian) Infantry Division was holding a position based on the bridge. The 5th Infantry Division took over the lead, but after a number of attacks could not make any further progress. Its 13th Infantry Brigade had to establish another bridgehead across the Simeto, but the Germans had brought in more troops and prepared defensive positions, and after hard fighting it was not until 5 August 1943 that the Eighth Army entered the city of Catania itself. Further hard fighting followed, and they entered Messina just after the United States Seventh Army on 17 August 1943.

After an enquiry into the problems with the airborne missions in Sicily, the British Army and Royal Air Force submitted some recommendations. Aircrew had to be trained in parachute and glider operations, and pathfinders landing before the main force had to have enough time to set out their beacons. The landing plan was simplified, with complete brigades landing on one drop zone instead of the smaller battalion landing areas used in Sicily. Gliders were no longer released at night while still over water and their landing zones would be large enough to accommodate the aircraft with room to spare. Following the friendly-fire incident over the convoy, more training was given to ships&#x27; crews in aircraft recognition and Allied aircraft were painted with three large white stripes on their wings. Training for pilots belonging to the Glider Pilot Regiment was increased and improvements to the gliders were implemented, including better inter-aircraft communication.

For transporting paratroops, to avoid relying solely on American aircraft and pilots, No. 38 Wing Royal Air Force was expanded, becoming No. 38 Group with its Halifax squadrons, now supported by four squadrons of Albemarles and four squadrons of Stirlings. To provide another method of delivering jeeps and artillery guns by air, the air force started experiments on parachuting them into combat, carrying the jeeps and guns in the aircraft&#x27;s large bomb bays. A second Royal Air Force transport group, No. 46 Group, was formed, and was equipped solely with Dakotas, instead of the mixture of aircraft in No. 38 Group. After these changes, the Royal Air Force groups could supply 88 Albemarles, 88 Stirlings, 36 Halifaxes and 150 Dakotas, a total of 362 planes, in addition to aircraft held as reserves.

Lessons were learned from the near-disastrous parachute drops on Sicily and paved the way for larger and more successful operations in Italy, Normandy and Southern France.

<text>Dale Carnegie ( ; spelled Carnagey until c. 1922; November 24, 1888 – November 1, 1955) was an American writer and teacher of courses in self-improvement, salesmanship, corporate training, public speaking, and interpersonal skills. Born into poverty on a farm in Missouri, he was the author of &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot; (1936), a bestseller that remains popular today. He also wrote &quot;How to Stop Worrying and Start Living&quot; (1948), &quot;Lincoln the Unknown&quot; (1932), and several other books.

One of the core ideas in his books is that it is possible to change other people&#x27;s behavior by changing one&#x27;s behavior towards them.

==Biography==
Dale Carnegie was born November 24, 1888, on a farm in Maryville, Missouri. He was the second son of farmers Amanda Elizabeth Harbison (1858–1939) and her husband James William Carnagey (1852–1941). Carnegie grew up around Bedison, Missouri, southeast of Maryville and attended rural Rose Hill and Harmony one room schools. Carnegie would develop a longstanding friendship with another Maryville author, Homer Croy.

In 1904, at age 16, his family moved to a farm in Warrensburg, Missouri. As a youth, he enjoyed speaking in public and joined his school&#x27;s debate team. Carnegie said he had to get up at 3 a.m. to feed the pigs and milk his parents&#x27; cows before going to school. During high school, he grew interested in the speeches at the various Chautauqua assemblies. He completed his high school education in 1906.

He attended the State Teachers College in Warrensburg, graduating in 1908.

His first job after college was selling correspondence courses to ranchers. He moved on to selling bacon, soap, and lard for Armour &amp; Company. He was successful to the point of making his sales territory of South Omaha, Nebraska, the national leader for the firm.

After saving $200, Dale Carnegie quit sales in 1911 in order to pursue a lifelong dream of becoming a Chautauqua lecturer. He ended up instead attending the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York, but found little success as an actor, though it is written that he played the role of Dr. Hartley in a road show of &quot;Polly of the Circus&quot;. When the production ended, he returned to New York, living at the YMCA on 125th Street. There he got the idea to teach public speaking, and he persuaded the YMCA manager to allow him to instruct a class in return for 80% of the net proceeds. In his first session, he had run out of material. Improvising, he suggested that students speak about &quot;something that made them angry&quot;, and discovered that the technique made speakers unafraid to address a public audience. From this 1912 debut, the Dale Carnegie Course evolved. Carnegie had tapped into the average American&#x27;s desire to have more self-confidence, and by 1914, he was earning $500 (about $ today) every week.

During World War I he served in the U.S. Army spending the time at Camp Upton. His draft card noted he had filed for conscientious objector status and had a loss of a forefinger.

By 1916, Dale conducted a sold out lecture at Carnegie Hall, which influenced his decision in 1919 to change the spelling of his last name in honor of the steel magnate, Andrew Carnegie, and easier for others to remember. Carnegie&#x27;s first collection of his writings was &quot;Public Speaking: a Practical Course for Business Men&quot; (1926), later entitled &quot;Public Speaking and Influencing Men in Business&quot; (1932). In 1936, Simon &amp; Schuster published &quot;How to Win Friends and Influence People&quot;. The book was a bestseller from its debut. By the time of Carnegie&#x27;s death, the book had sold five million copies in 31 languages, and there had been 450,000 graduates of his Dale Carnegie Institute. It has been stated in the book that he had critiqued over 150,000 speeches in his participation in the adult education movement of the time.

==Personal life==
His first marriage ended in divorce in August 1931. 

On November 5, 1944, he married his former secretary, Dorothy Price Vanderpool (1913–1998), who also had been divorced. Vanderpool had a daughter, Rosemary, from her first marriage. She and Carnegie had a daughter, Donna Dale. Dorothy ran the Carnegie company following Dale&#x27;s death.

Carnegie died of Hodgkin lymphoma on November 1, 1955, at his home in Forest Hills, New York. He was buried in the Belton cemetery in Cass County, Missouri.

<doc id="254017" wikidata="Q1558441" url="?curid=254017" title="Operation Corkscrew">
<text>Operation Corkscrew was the code name for the Allied invasion of the Italian island of Pantelleria (between Sicily and Tunisia) on 11 June 1943, prior to the Allied invasion of Sicily, during the Second World War. There had been an early Allied plan to occupy the island in late 1940 (Operation Workshop) but it was cancelled when the Luftwaffe arrived in the Mediterranean.

==Background==
Allied attention returned to Pantelleria in early 1943. The radar installations and airfield on the island were seen as a threat to the invasion of Sicily (Operation Husky). The Italian garrison on the island was 12,000 strong in well-entrenched pillboxes and 21 gun batteries. There was an opportunity to assess the impact of bombardment upon fortifications. It was decided to see if the island could be forced into submission by aerial and naval bombardment alone. Failing this, an invasion was planned for 11 June.

==Landings==
Starting in late May, the island was subjected to steadily increasing bombing attacks. In early June, the attacks intensified and 14,203 bombs weighing were dropped on 112 Italian batteries. On 8 June, a Royal Navy task force of five cruisers, eight destroyers and three torpedo boats carried out a bombardment of the main port on the island.

The engagement was observed by General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the Supreme Allied Commander in the Mediterranean, and Admiral Andrew Cunningham from the flagship . From 8 May to 11 June 1943, 5,285 bombing sorties were flown by fighter-bombers, medium and heavy bombers, dropping of bombs on the island.

Two demands for the garrison to surrender went unanswered and on 11 June, the amphibious assault went ahead. About an hour before the landing craft reached the beaches, the accompanying ships opened fire. Unknown to the attackers, the commander of the garrison Admiral Gino Pavesi on Pantelleria had sought permission to surrender from Rome the previous evening and received it that morning. When the first of the British Commandos landed, the Italians had already surrendered and the landing was unopposed.

==Aftermath==
The Italian gun positions were reduced to 47 per cent effectiveness by the intense ten-day air bombardment. Out of 112 guns bombed, 2 had suffered from direct hits, 17 were near misses and 34 were damaged by debris and splinters (10 beyond repair). All control communications were destroyed, along with many gun emplacements and ammunition stores.

The nearby islands of Lampedusa and Linosa quickly fell in the next few days. The operation cleared the way for the Allied invasion of Sicily a month later.

<text>During World War II, Operation Chestnut was a failed British raid by 2 Special Air Service, conducted in support of the Allied invasion of Sicily.

==Background==

Two teams of ten men each, codenamed &#x27;Pink&#x27; and &#x27;Brig&#x27;, parachuted into northern Sicily on the night of 12 July 1943, to disrupt communications, transport and the enemy in general. All radios were broken and much ammunition, explosives, and food were lost in the jump. One team landed near an inhabited area, alerting the defenders. 

Without radios, neither team was able to contact and direct the planes bringing in reinforcements, which subsequently returned to base without any drops being made. The raiders were unable to achieve anything worthwhile and worked their way towards friendly lines evading the enemy.

This was the first parachute raid for 2 SAS, and also the raid when Maj. Geoffrey Appleyard, (former commander of the Small Scale Raiding Force), was lost. Appleyard was aboard the plane carrying &#x27;Pink&#x27; team as drop supervisor. After the drop was made the plane failed to return to base.

<text>Charles Williams Nash (28 January 1864 – 6 June 1948) was an American automobile entrepreneur who served as an executive in the automotive industry. He played a significant role in building up General Motors as its fifth president. In 1916, he bought Thomas B. Jeffery Company, makers of the popular Rambler automobile, and renamed it Nash Motors. The resulting firm played an independent role in an automobile industry increasingly dominated by the Big Three: General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler. 

Nash&#x27;s profits came from focusing on one well-designed car in the upper-medium price range. He bought several distressed companies in Wisconsin, merging them and installing advanced managerial accounting procedures while cutting costs and focusing on long-term growth. He retired as president in 1932, but remained chairman of the board. He facilitated the merger in 1937 with Kelvinator, a manufacturer of refrigerators, home appliances, and commercial refrigeration.

== Early life ==
Nash was born to a poor farming family in Cortland, Illinois, on what is now Route 38 — Lincoln Highway. His mother was Anna E. &quot;Annie&quot; Cadwell (1829–1909), who married David L. Nash. Other Nash siblings included Mazovia (b. 1862), George C. (b. 1866), and Laura W. (b. 1868).

Charles&#x27; parents separated when he was six years old and abandoned him. As a result of a court order, he worked as a farmhand in Michigan as an indentured servant under an agreement that was to last until he was 21. Nash had only three months of schooling per year while he was &quot;bound out&quot; to perform farm chores.

At age 12, Nash ran away and became a farmhand, first in Grand Blanc, Michigan, for $8 per month, then for Alexander McFarland in Mount Morris, Michigan, for $12 per month. On McFarland&#x27;s farm, he learned the carpentry trade from John Shelben and formed the &quot;Adams &amp; Nash&quot; concern to press hay.

While pressing hay on the Halleck farm, he met his future wife, Jessie Halleck, and married her on April 23, 1884. They moved to Flint, Michigan, due to Jessie&#x27;s poor health. In 1890 was hired by William C. Durant of the Flint Road Cart Company, which later became the Durant-Dort Carriage Company.

== Automobile industry ==
Durant hired Nash in 1890 for $1 per day as an upholstery stuffer. Within six months, he was promoted to superintendent of the factory. Within ten years, Nash became vice president and general manager of the Durant-Dort Carriage Company. Nash introduced the straight-line belt conveyor into the assembly of carriages. In 1897, Nash had a chance to drive an early automobile and immediately became interested in its commercial possibilities.

=== General Motors ===
By 1910, the chief business of Durant-Dort Carriage Company was building automobile bodies for the Buick unit of General Motors, which was founded in 1908 by Durant, who had bought Buick in 1904. Durant found himself short of both capital and skilled management. 

Durant brought in Nash to Buick to oversee production. Durant was not concerned that Nash did not have any automotive industry experience; his expertise was in dealing with people and also how to organize an efficient production line. James J. Storrow followed the recommendation and appointed Nash as vice-president of Buick on 13 December 1910.

Nash was searching for an expert in day-to-day manufacturing operations so he could focus more on sales, supplier relations, and logistics. In 1912, Nash hired Walter P. Chrysler from the American Locomotive Company to be Buick&#x27;s works manager.

In late 1912, Durant was fired by the General Motors board, and on November 19, Nash was elected as the fifth president of the company because he had earned the trust of the bankers who controlled the board of directors. Durant had acquired numerous automakers without analyzing their contribution to the product mix and some like Elmore, Cartercar, Reliance Motor Truck, Welch Motor Car, were money-losing operations that left the company financially overextended; thus, there was concern if it could even survive another five years.

Under Nash&#x27;s leadership, General Motors made immense gains in profits earned and in the number of vehicles produced. Nash focused on making GM more efficient by eliminating unprofitable products and streamlining manufacturing. He arranged for GM to purchase 51% of axle maker Weston-Mott. Cost-cutting and higher sales were his top priorities. There was tight control of inventories and cash at the corporate level, as well as changes designed to maximize production at each factory.

Nash had restored GM to organizational stability and financial health. This was reflected in 1914 profits at $7.2 million and doubling for 1915 as well as again doubling for 1916, with the automaker taking in nearly $29 million.

His strategy of consolidating into large units paid off: he combined three different truck operations into one and merged several parts-making operations. Keen to build up international markets, he set up the General Motors Export Company to handle global sales. He also moved GM&#x27;s general offices from New York to Detroit, created a new purchasing office, and set up a new accounting office with standardized accounting procedures. However, Nash was reluctant to pay dividends to shareholders 

By late 1915 and early 1916, Billy Durant attempted to reassert his control over the company, and Nash was caught in the power struggle between Durant and bankers. By May 1916, Durant regained control of the majority of voting stock. He offered Nash a $1 million annual salary to remain with the automaker. Nash described the salary as &quot;more than a man’s worth&quot; and resigned on June 1.

== Nash Motors ==
After he clashed with Durant, Nash resolved never to work for someone else again. Along with former GM executives, James J. Storrow and Walter P. Chrysler, Nash attempted to take over Packard, but the luxury car maker&#x27;s board of directors demurred.

Nash learned that the heirs of the Jeffery Motor Company of Kenosha, Wisconsin, were anxious to retire. It was best known for its Rambler brand of cars and numerous innovations. Nash bought out the pioneering automaker in August 1916 with a down payment check of half a million dollars and the total deal worth $5 million (some reports indicate the price was $9 million). One of the first major investors was Alfred P. Sloan. While Jeffery Motors had total stock of $3 million, the newly incorporated Nash Motors became a substantial force with capital stock value of almost $24 million on 29 July 1916.

In 1917, he renamed the company Nash Motors. The 1917 Nash Model 671 was the first automobile to bear the name of the new company&#x27;s founder. Nils Erik Wahlberg, a former GM engineer, developed new cars and engines for the 1918 model year. Nash Motors became successful almost immediately, with sales totaling 31,008 trucks and cars by 1919.

Nash was able to negotiate procurement contracts with the United States Army during World War I which made the company one of the largest producers of trucks in the nation. In 1918, Nash was appointed to take charge of the engineering and production of aircraft matters for the war effort.

In addition to running his own company, Charles Nash served as president of the luxury automaker LaFayette Motors until Nash Motors bought out the company in 1924.

By 1929, the Big Three automakers (GM, Ford, and Chrysler) controlled 75 percent of the automobile market. Nash Motors was in fourth place, producing 138,000 vehicles in 1928.

Nash focused on producing one high-quality automobile for the upper-medium price range, later adding a smaller, less expensive model, the Ajax. Nash realized he could never compete with the market diversity of the Big Three, so he based his profits on careful management, close attention to costs, and expansion opportunities. Nash was a hands-on executive who concentrated on developing more efficient purchasing and setting up accounting procedures that would specify the source of costs and profits.

Nash acquired other car companies, including Mitchell Motors of Racine in 1923 and LaFayette Motors of Milwaukee in 1924.

During the Great Depression, Nash cars were popular because they provided high quality, durability, and the look of luxury at a relatively low price. The company also saw an opportunity in the luxury car market segment. It introduced the top-of-the-line Ambassador models on a wheelbase in 1932 that soon earned the nickname of &quot;Kenosha Duesenbergs&quot; because of their quality.

During a time when most others were operating in the red or going bankrupt, Nash Motors was only one of two firms in the automobile industry generating a profit. In November 1932, Nash was honored by &quot;Sales Management&quot; (now Sales Management and Marketing) magazine as &quot;The Pace Setter for the Auto Industry.&quot;
Nash gave up the presidency in 1932, but remained board chairman. Nash wanted George W. Mason as his executive vice president, and to have Mason, he had to buy Kelvinator, a leading manufacturer of refrigerators.

After twenty years of success in running his company, Nash turned it over in 1937 and the merged company was renamed Nash-Kelvinator.

== Retirement ==
Nash retired from his namesake company in 1936 to live in California. His health started to fail during his wife&#x27;s illness and eventual death in 1947. He is quoted as describing himself as &quot;the most common cuss that lived.&quot; He died in 1948 at the age of 84 in Beverly Hills, California. Always proud of belonging to the &quot;common people&quot;, he left an estate valued at about US$50 million (approximately US$ in dollars ). Nash was interred in the Forest Lawn Memorial Park Cemetery in Glendale beside his wife.

== Legacy ==
Nash is best remembered for responding to public demand by building smaller, more economical, and affordable cars. Nash Motors successfully marketed cars to America&#x27;s middle class. Charles Nash is also recognized for lean operations in business that included scheduling production and material orders closely, carrying a small inventory, and having flexibility in meeting the changing market needs during the economic turmoil of the 1920s and 1930s. Nash is also credited with developing the straight-line conveyor belt assembly system that he first introduced at the Durant-Dort Carriage Company factory.

<text>Operation Barclay was a World War II deception by the Allies in support of Operation Husky, the Allied invasion of Sicily in July 1943.

The goal was to deceive the Axis powers as to the location of the Allies&#x27; assault across the Mediterranean and to divert the Axis military command&#x27;s attention and resources. Operation Barclay used bogus troop movements, radio traffic, recruitment of Greek interpreters, and acquisition of Greek maps to indicate an invasion through the Balkans.

Operation Barclay created a sham army in the eastern Mediterranean: the Twelfth Army consisting of 12 fictitious divisions. Adolf Hitler suspected that the Allies would invade Europe through the Balkans, and &quot;Barclay&quot; served to reinforce this.

As part of Barclay the British also launched Operation Mincemeat, where faked documents were planted via Spain, and Operation Waterfall, in which a decoy invasion force was assembled in Cyrenaica. To reinforce the impression that an Allied invasion was imminent the Special Operations Executive (SOE), in co-operation with the Greek andartes, mounted Operation Animals, a series of attacks on rail and road networks.

The deception was successful. The German High Command concluded there was a greater concentration of Allied forces in the eastern Mediterranean than was the case and held to this assessment, making subsequent deceptions more credible. German forces in the Balkans were reinforced from 8 to 18 divisions, and the Italian fleet was diverted into the Adriatic Sea. The Allied invasion of Sicily thus achieved total surprise.

The greatly increased number of German occupying forces in Greece resulted in negative consequences for the Greek Resistance. Wide-ranging counterguerrilla operations were carried out, culminating in mass reprisals such as the Massacre of Kalavryta and the Distomo massacre.

<text>ISO/IEC 8859-2:1999, &quot;Information technology — 8-bit single-byte coded graphic character sets — Part 2: Latin alphabet No. 2&quot;, is part of the ISO/IEC 8859 series of ASCII-based standard character encodings, first edition published in 1987. It is informally referred to as &quot;Latin-2&quot;. It is generally intended for Central or &quot;Eastern European&quot; languages that are written in the Latin script. Note that ISO/IEC 8859-2 is very different from code page 852 (MS-DOS Latin 2, PC Latin 2) which is also referred to as &quot;Latin-2&quot; in Czech and Slovak regions. Almost half the use of the encoding is for Polish, and it&#x27;s the main legacy encoding for Polish, while virtually all use of it has been replaced by UTF-8 (on the web).

ISO-8859-2 is the IANA preferred charset name for this standard when supplemented with the C0 and C1 control codes from ISO/IEC 6429. Less than 0.04% of all web pages use ISO-8859-2 as of October 2022. Microsoft has assigned code page 28592 a.k.a. Windows-28592 to ISO-8859-2 in Windows. IBM assigned code page 912 to ISO 8859-2, until that code page was extended in 1999. Code page 1111 is similar, but replaces byte B0 ° (degree sign) with U+02DA ˚ (ring above).

Windows-1250 is similar to ISO-8859-2 and has all the printable characters it has and more. However a few of them are rearranged (unlike Windows-1252, which keeps all printable characters from ISO-8859-1 in the same place).

<text>Nash Motors Company was an American automobile manufacturer based in Kenosha, Wisconsin from 1916 until 1937. From 1937 through 1954, Nash Motors was the automotive division of Nash-Kelvinator. As sales of smaller firms declined after 1950 in the wake of the domestic Big Three automakers’ (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) advantages in production, distribution, and revenue, Nash merged with Hudson Motors to form American Motors Corporation (AMC). Nash automobile production continued from 1954 through 1957 under AMC.

Innovations by Nash included the introduction of an automobile heating and ventilation system in 1938 that is still used today, unibody construction in 1941, seat belts in 1950, a U.S.-built compact car in 1950, and an early muscle car in 1957.

== History ==


Nash Motors was founded in 1916 by former General Motors president Charles W. Nash, who acquired the Thomas B. Jeffery Company. Jeffery&#x27;s best-known automobile was the Rambler whose mass production from a plant in Kenosha began in 1902.

The 1917 Nash Model 671 was the first vehicle produced to bear the name of the new company&#x27;s founder. Sales for 1918 were 10,283 units. More models were added in 1919, and sales rose to 27,081.

The decades of success enjoyed by Nash were said to be due to its focus on building cars &quot;embodying honest worth [at] a price level which held out possibilities of a very wide market.&quot;

The four-wheel drive Jeffery Quad truck became an important product for Nash. Approximately 11,500 Quads were built between 1913 and 1919. They served to move material during World War I under severe conditions. The Quad used Mehul differentials with half-shafts mounted above the load-bearing dead axles to drive the hubs through hub-reduction gearing. In addition, it featured four-wheel steering. The Quad achieved the reputation of being the best four-wheel drive truck produced in the country. The newly formed Nash Motors became the largest producer of four-wheel drives. By 1918, capacity constraints at Nash meant the Paige-Detroit Motor Car Company began to assemble the Nash Quad under license and Nash patents. Nash became the leading producer of military trucks by the end of World War I. After the War ended, surplus Quads were used as heavy work trucks in fields such as construction and logging.

Charles Nash convinced the chief engineer of GM&#x27;s Oakland Division, Finnish-born Nils Eric Wahlberg, to move to Nash&#x27;s new company. The first Nash engine introduced in 1917 by Wahlberg had overhead valves, which Nash had learned about while working for Buick. Wahlberg is also credited with helping design the flow-through ventilation used since then in nearly every motor vehicle.

Introduced in 1938, Nash&#x27;s Weather Eye directed fresh, outside air into the car&#x27;s fan-boosted, filtered ventilation system, where it was warmed (or cooled), and then removed through rearward placed vents. The process also helped to reduce humidity and equalize the slight pressure differential between the outside and inside of a moving vehicle.

Another unique feature of Nash cars was the unequal wheel tracks. The front wheels were set slightly narrower than the rear, thus adding stability and improving cornering. Wahlberg was also an early proponent of wind tunnel testing for vehicles and, during World War II, worked with Theodore (Ted) Ulrich in the development of Nash&#x27;s radically styled Airflyte models.

Nash&#x27;s slogan from the late 1920s and 1930s was &quot;Give the customer more than he has paid for,&quot; and the cars lived up to it. Innovations included a straight-eight engine with overhead valves, twin spark plugs, and nine crankshaft bearings in 1930. The 1932 Ambassador Eight had synchromesh transmissions and free wheeling, automatic centralized chassis lubrication, a worm-drive rear end, and its suspension was adjustable inside the car. A longtime proponent of automotive safety, Nash was among the early mid- and low-priced cars that offered four-wheel brakes.

The Nash was a success among consumers, which meant for the company, &quot;selling for a long time has been 100% a production problem... month after month, all the cars that could be produced were sold before they left the factory floor.&quot;

==Development of the Ajax==
For the 1925 model year, Nash introduced the entry-level marque Ajax. The Ajax was produced in the newly acquired Mitchell Motor Car Company plant in Racine, Wisconsin. Mitchell was the manufacturer of Mitchell-brand automobiles between 1903 and 1923. Sales of Ajax automobiles, while quite respectable, were disappointing. It was believed that the same car would sell better if it were called a Nash. Thus, the Ajax became the &quot;Nash Light Six&quot; in June 1926, and sales improved as expected. 

In an unusual move, Nash Motors offered all Ajax owners a kit to &quot;convert&quot; their Ajax into a Nash Light Six. This kit, supplied at no charge, included a set of new hubcaps, a radiator badge, and all other parts necessary to change the identity of an Ajax into that of a Nash Light Six. This was done to protect Ajax owners from the inevitable drop in resale value when the Ajax marque was discontinued. In this way, Nash Motors showed high value for its customers&#x27; satisfaction and well-being. Most Ajax owners took advantage of this move, and &quot;unconverted&quot; Ajax cars are rare today.

==Acquisition of LaFayette==
Nash was the principal stockholder in LaFayette Motors, a company started in Indianapolis, Indiana in 1920. It later moved to Milwaukee, Wisconsin, and became the producer of a large, powerful, and expensive luxury car. Other significant stockholders were Charles W. Nash and his friends and business associates. However, the LaFayette cars did not sell well.

In 1924, Nash absorbed LaFayette and converted its plant to produce Ajax automobiles. The LaFayette marque was reintroduced in 1934 as a lower-priced companion to Nash. LaFayette ceased to be an independent marque with the introduction of the 1937 models. From 1937 through 1940, the Nash LaFayette was the lowest-priced model, replaced by the new unibody Nash 600 for the 1941 model year.

==Era of George Mason and Nash Kelvinator==

Before retiring, Charles Nash chose Kelvinator Corporation head George W. Mason to succeed him. Mason accepted, but placed one condition on the job: Nash would acquire controlling interest in Kelvinator, which at the time was the leading manufacturer of high-end refrigerators and kitchen appliances in the United States. As of 4 January 1937, the resulting company was known as Nash-Kelvinator. As a brand name, Nash continued representing automobiles for the merged firm. This was the largest merger of companies in two different industries until then.

In 1938, Nash introduced an optional conditioned air heating/ventilating system, an outcome of the expertise shared between Kelvinator and Nash. This was the first hot-water car heater to draw fresh air from outside the car and is the basis of all modern internal combustion engine car heaters in use today. Also in 1938, Nash, along with other car manufacturers Studebaker and Graham, offered vacuum-controlled shifting, an early approach to removing the gearshift from the front floorboards. Automobiles equipped with the Automatic Vacuum Shift (supplied by the Evans Products Company) had a small gear selector lever mounted on the dashboard, immediately below the radio controls.

In 1936, Nash introduced the &quot;Bed-In-A-Car&quot; feature, which converted the car&#x27;s interior into a sleeping compartment. The rear seatbacks were hinged to go up, allowing the back seat cushion to be propped up into a level position. This also created an opening between the passenger compartment and the trunk. Two adults could sleep in the car with their legs and feet in the trunk and their heads and shoulders on the rear seat cushions. In 1949, this arrangement was modified so that fully reclining front seatbacks created a sleeping area within the passenger compartment. In 1950, these reclining seatbacks were made to lock into several intermediate positions. Nash soon called these &quot;Airliner Reclining Seats&quot;.

In 1939, Nash added a thermostat to its &quot;Conditioned Air System&quot;, and thus the famous Nash Weather Eye heater was introduced. The 1939 and 1940 Nash streamlined cars were designed by George Walker and Associates and freelance body stylist Don Mortrude. They were available in three series - LaFayette, Ambassador Six, and Ambassador Eight. For the 1940 model cars, Nash introduced independent coil spring front suspension and sealed beam headlights.

Introduced for the 1941 model year, the Nash 600 was the first mass-produced unibody construction automobile made in the United States. Its lighter weight compared to body-on-frame automobiles and lower air drag helped it to achieve excellent fuel economy for its day. The &quot;600&quot; model designation is said to have been derived from overdrive-equipped examples of this car&#x27;s ability to travel on a tank of gasoline. It would achieve . The 600 models used an unusual steering/front suspension system with extremely long kingpins. Inadequate lubrication became a problem for these systems, commonly resulting in premature failures. The design of the cars was improved by new front ends, upholstery, and chrome trim from 1942 through 1948. The larger Ambassador models shared the same bodies with the 600 but placed this unibody structure on top of a conventional frame, resulting in a robust design.

Post-World War II passenger car production resumed on 27 October 1945, with an Ambassador sedan first off the assembly line. There were a few changes from the 1942 models. The extended, slimmer upper grille bars and a projecting center section on the lower grille were most noticeable. The 600 models featured a conventional front suspension and steering system. Postwar Nashes were six-cylinder only; eight-cylinder engines did not return. The large Ambassador engine thus was the seven main bearing, overhead-valve, , six-cylinder developing .

Nash was considering the potential of offering a pickup truck and developed a prototype built on the existing chassis with a modified 600 front end and cab along with an outsourced cargo bed. For the 1946 model year, Nash introduced the Suburban model that used wood framing and panels on the body. It was similar to the Chrysler Town and Country and Ford Sportsman models. Suburbans were continued in 1947 and 1948, with 1,000 built over the three years. In 1948, the Ambassador convertible returned with 1,000 made.

==Introduction of the Nash Airflyte==


The aerodynamic 1949 Nash &quot;Airflyte&quot; was the first car of an advanced design introduced by the company after the War. Its aerodynamic body shape was developed in a wind tunnel. A &quot;radically aerodynamic&quot; format was first proposed around 1943 by two independent designers, Ted Pietsch and Bob Koto, to Nash&#x27;s vice president of engineering, Nils E. Wahlberg. The resulting all-new 1949 production cars were similar to the proposed sketches. The objective was to reduce the automobile&#x27;s body&#x27;s drag coefficient by using a smooth shape and enclosed front fenders. Closed fenders were conceived by Nash engineers also in the exploration for added strength of unibody construction. In contrast, Hudson, a close competitor, incorporated an actual unibody frame section into its closed rear wheel openings at about the same time. The &quot;cutting-edge aerodynamics&quot; of the all-new postwar design were the most &quot;alarming&quot; in the industry since the Chrysler Airflow. It was built at one of two new factories in El Segundo, California, where the factory is still being used, having been re-purposed as the Boeing Satellite Development Center, immediately south of Los Angeles International Airport, on Nash Street.

A one-piece curved safety glass windshield was used on both models. Wide and low, the automobile featured more interior room than its 1948 predecessor, although its height was lower. Due to its enclosed front fenders, Nash automobiles had a larger turning radius than most other cars. The 600 models used a wheelbase while the Ambassador models stretched to . Both shared the same bodies. Coil springs were used on all four wheels. Both models offered Three trim lines: Super, Super Special, and the top-line Custom. Power was provided by an , flathead I6 cylinder in the 600 and a OHV, I6 in the Ambassador.

In 1949, Nash became the first American car with seat belts as a factory option. They were installed in 40,000 cars, yet buyers did not want them and had dealers remove them. There was &quot;heated debate despite increasing scientific research&quot; about their value and the option was &quot;met with insurmountable sales resistance&quot; with Nash reporting that after one year &quot;only 1,000 had been used&quot; by customers.

The few changes for the 1950 Airflytes were a wider rear window, concealed fuel filler cap, some dashboard features, and the addition on Ambassadors of a GM Hydramatic automatic transmission option. The 600 models were renamed the &quot;Statesman&quot;. A five-position &quot;Airliner&quot; reclining front passenger seatback was optional for both models. The stroke on the Statesman engine was increased , giving and , and the Ambassador received a new cylinder head that increased power to .

Changes for the 1951 model Airflytes were to the rear fenders, elongated to incorporate vertical taillights, a new conventional dashboard replacing the Uniscope mounted on the steering column, and a new upright bar grille with horizontal parking lights as well as the addition of GM Hydramatic as a Statesman option. The three best sales years for Nash up to that time were 1949, 1950, and 1951.

Nash-Kelvinator&#x27;s president, George Mason, felt Nash had the best chance of reaching a larger market by building small cars. He directed Nash towards developing the first compact of the post-war era, the 1950 Nash Rambler, which was marketed as an up-market, feature-laden convertible. Mason orchestrated a contract manufacturing arrangement with Austin of the UK to build Nash&#x27;s new subcompact car, the Metropolitan. It was introduced in March of 1954.

The full-size Nash Airflytes were wholly re-designed for the 1952 model year. They were promoted as the Golden Airflytes in honor of Nash Motors&#x27; 50th anniversary as an automobile builder because the company was counting the years of the Thomas B. Jeffery Company as part of their heritage. Therefore, &quot;Great Cars Since 1902&quot; became one of the company&#x27;s advertising slogans. Nash was the only American car manufacturer besides Ford Motor Company to introduce an all-new 1952 model. 

The new Golden Airflytes presented a more modern, squared-off look than did the 1949 through 1951 models, which were often compared to inverted bathtubs. Nash contracted Battista &quot;Pinin&quot; Farina of Italy to design a body for the new Golden Airflyte. Management wanted a better design, and the result was a combination of an in-house design and Pinin Farina&#x27;s model. Also in 1952, Nash began offering automatic transmissions, either a GM Hydramatic or a Borg-Warner overdrive transmission. Power was provided by a six-cylinder engine that was now bored out to .

Using its Kelvinator refrigeration experience, the automobile industry&#x27;s first single-unit heating and air conditioning system was introduced by Nash in 1954. This was a compact, affordable system for the mass market with controls on the dash and an electric clutch. Entirely incorporated within the engine bay, the combined heating and cooling system had cold air for passengers enter through dash-mounted vents. Competing systems used a separate heating system and an engine-mounted compressor with an evaporator in the car&#x27;s trunk to deliver cold air through the rear package shelf and overhead vents. The alternative layout pioneered by Nash &quot;became established practice and continues to form the basis of the modern and more sophisticated automatic climate control systems.&quot;

==Introduction of the Nash-Healey==
The Anglo-American Nash-Healey sports car was introduced in 1951. This was a collaborative effort between George Mason and British sports car manufacturer Donald Healey. Healey designed and built the chassis and suspension and, until 1952, the aluminum body, which another British manufacturer, Panelcraft Sheet Metal Co. Ltd., fabricated in Birmingham West Midlands. Nash shipped the powertrain components to England, and Healey assembled the cars, then shipped finished vehicles to the U.S. In 1952, the Italian designer Battista Farina restyled the body, and its construction changed to steel and aluminum. High costs, low sales, and Nash&#x27;s focus on the Rambler line led to the termination of Nash-Healey&#x27;s production in 1954 after 506 automobiles had been produced.

While a welcome attempt to improve Nash&#x27;s stodgy image, the Nash-Healey did little to enhance showroom traffic as Nash sales fell steadily from 1951 onward. The Airflyte had initially sold well in the postwar &quot;seller&#x27;s&quot; market. Still, its bulbous styling, rooted in 1940s design trends, quickly became passé, and its underpowered six-cylinder engine proved to be a significant liability against GM&#x27;s new OHV short-stroke V8s. Like fellow independents Hudson, Studebaker, and Packard, Nash charged higher prices for their cars than Ford and GM, which benefited from the economies of scale. The independents also lacked the Big Three&#x27;s extensive dealer network or advertising budget. Low-profit Rambler sales gradually made up more and more of Nash&#x27;s total production. In 1953 and 1954, Ford and GM also waged an all-out price war on each other, further damaging the independents&#x27; sales. Mainline Nashes also lacked body styles; despite introducing a hardtop coupe in 1952, there was no convertible or station wagon, although the Rambler lineup featured all of these versions.

In addition, while Nash had profited from military contracts during the Korean War, that conflict ended in mid-1953. At the same time, the new Secretary of Defense Charles E. Wilson, ex-GM president, began steering defense contracts to his former employer at the expense of the rest of the automotive industry.

Mason commissioned Farina to design a Rambler-based two-seater coupe called the Palm Beach, which may have been intended as a successor to the Nash-Healey. However, the project only progressed to a concept car.

For European endurance racing, Healey and his staff designed and built three special Nash-Healeys with lightweight aluminum racing bodies. These competition versions entered four consecutive Le Mans races and one Mille Miglia.
At Le Mans, they achieved fourth overall in 1950, sixth overall and fourth in class in 1951, third overall and first in class in 1952, and eleventh overall in 1953. In the Mille Miglia, they finished ninth overall in 1950 and seventh overall, as well as placing fourth in class in 1952.

==Formation of American Motors Corporation==

In January 1954, Nash announced the acquisition of the Hudson Motor Car Company as a friendly merger, creating American Motors Corporation (AMC). To improve the financial performance of the combined companies, all production, beginning with the 1955 Nash and Hudson models, would happen at Nash&#x27;s Kenosha plant. Nash would focus most of its marketing resources on its smaller Rambler models, and Hudson would focus its marketing efforts on its full-sized cars.

One of the first things Mason did as CEO of the new company was to initiate talks with James J. Nance, president of Packard, for parts-sharing arrangements between AMC and Packard. At this time, AMC did not have its own V8 engine, and an agreement was made for the new Packard V8 engine and Packard&#x27;s Ultramatic automatic transmission to be used in the 1955 Nash Ambassador and Hudson Hornet models.

In July 1954, Packard acquired Studebaker to form Studebaker-Packard Corporation, however, further talks of a merger between AMC and Packard-Studebaker were cut short when Mason died on 8 October 1954. A week after his death, Mason&#x27;s successor, George W. Romney, announced &quot;there are no mergers under way either directly or indirectly&quot;. Nevertheless, Romney continued with Mason&#x27;s commitment to buy components from Studebaker-Packard Corporation. Although Mason and Nance had previously agreed that Studebaker-Packard would purchase parts from AMC, it did not do so. Moreover, Packard&#x27;s engines and transmissions were comparatively expensive, so AMC began development of its own V8 engine, and replaced the outsourced unit by mid-1956.

For the 1955 model year, all the large Nash and Hudson automobiles were based on a Nash-derived shared unitized body shell using styling themes by Pinin Farina, Edmund E. Anderson, and Frank Spring. Each had individual powertrains and separate, non-interchangeable body parts. This mimicked the longtime practice Big Three (General Motors, Ford, and Chrysler) that allowed for maximum manufacturing economy. Anderson set up separate design studios for Nash, Hudson, and Rambler.

George Romney ordered the removal of the front fender skirts on Nashes and Ramblers for the 1955 models. Customers disliked this feature, yet it was reportedly demanded by George Mason, who liked their appearance.

Even with the merger forming AMC, they were held to a total of about four percent of the market and thus were under pressure to lower expenses and tooling costs for new models, perhaps by innovation.

The Nash Metropolitan, marketed under either the Nash or Hudson brands, became a make unto its own in 1957, as did the Rambler. By this point, Rambler sales comprised most of AMC&#x27;s volume, so George Romney decided to phase out the Nash and Hudson nameplates and focus solely on Rambler. This move would pay off the following year when an economic recession struck the United States and created a strong demand for economical compact cars. Nash and Hudson production ended with the last Hornet made on 25 June, 1957. From 1958 until 1962, Rambler and the Metropolitan were the only brands of cars sold by AMC. By 1965, the Rambler name would begin to be phased out, and AMC would take over as the brand name until the 1988 model year.

In 1970, American Motors acquired Kaiser Jeep (the descendant of Willys-Overland Motors) and its Toledo, Ohio, based manufacturing facilities. In 1979, AMC established a technology partnership with Renault. In 1987, Chrysler Corporation made a public offering to acquire all shares of AMC on the NYSE. The shareholders approved the offer, and AMC became a division of Chrysler Corporation.

==International markets==
Since the early days, Nash vehicles were exported as complete cars or in knock-down kit form for local assembly to many countries around the world including right-hand-drive markets such as the United Kingdom, Australia, New Zealand, and South Africa. International production for both the Nash and Hudson Marques was consolidated after the merger of Nash and Hudson to form American Motors Corporation (AMC) in 1954, after which international-bound operations were conducted at the former Nash factory in Kenosha and the Brampton plant in Canada until 1957, when both the Nash and Hudson Marques were retired.

===Australia===
Several distributors for each Australian state built and sold Nash vehicles in the 1920s. As was the practice for all car brands during the early 20th Century, the chassis and engines were imported, and Australian coach builders locally built the bodies. Early distributors were Wilsford Limited for New South Wales, Richards Brothers for Victoria and the Riverina, Peels Limited for Queensland, Eric Madren Motors (later Nash Cars (W.A) Limited) for Western Australia, and Northern Motors for Tasmania. The recovery period following the end of World War II saw a lull in car manufacturing, petrol rationing, and currency shortages. Some cars were imported in the late 1940s and 1950s despite these factors. In 1950, a few Nash trucks were assembled by Davies Pty Ltd in Launceston, Tasmania.

After the Nash-Hudson merger in 1954, AMC&#x27;s new Rambler vehicles were imported into Australia and distributed by Ira L. &amp; A.C Berk Pty Ltd which had previously held the Hudson franchise since 1939. Hudson was the more recognized brand in Australia, so they were initially sold as Hudson. The Nash Metropolitan was not sold in Australia. The first Rambler-badged vehicles were imported in 1957. This first shipment consisted of 24 cars, 10 of which were Rambler station wagons. Small numbers of Rambler Sixes were imported into Australia up until 1960. AMC made a new deal with Port Melbourne vehicle assembler Australian Motor Industries (AMI) in 1960 to build AMC vehicles from knock-down kits, production of which ran from 1961 until 1976. AMI eventually became Toyota Australia.

===New Zealand===
From 1935, Nash motor vehicles were assembled in New Zealand by Christchurch company Motor Assemblies Limited. The plant also made Studebaker and Standard vehicles and was acquired by Standard Motors in 1954. Production was then moved to Auckland company VW Motors at their Volkswagen plant in Otahuhu, Auckland until 1962. New Zealand saw the Nash Ramblers and the British-built, right-hand-drive Nash Metropolitan. In 1963, AMC struck a deal with Thames company Campbell Motors to build a new vehicle assembly plant for AMC vehicles, which began production in 1964. Renamed Campbell Motor Industries (CMI), the plant built Rambler vehicles from knock-down kits until 1971. CMI eventually became &quot;Toyota New Zealand&quot;.

===South Africa===
Following World War II, Nash motor vehicles were assembled in South Africa by a newly built assembly operation in East London Car Distributors and Assemblers (CDA). The plant also built Packard, Renault, and Standard motor vehicles. CDA was eventually taken over, first by Chrysler, and finally by Peugeot.

===United Kingdom===
Nash vehicles were imported into the United Kingdom by London company Nash Concessionaires. After 1961, Rambler imports switched to the former U.K Hudson operation in Chiswick which was accordingly renamed Rambler Motors (A.M.C.) Limited. AMC&#x27;s deal with Austin for the production of the Nash Metropolitan was independent of the Chiswick Rambler operation.

<doc id="254038" wikidata="Q1356210" url="?curid=254038" title="Requiem (Verdi)">
<text>The Messa da Requiem is a musical setting of the Catholic funeral mass (Requiem) for four soloists, double choir and orchestra by Giuseppe Verdi. It was composed in memory of Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi admired, and therefore also referred to as the Manzoni Requiem. The first performance, at the San Marco church in Milan on 22 May 1874, conducted by the composer, marked the first anniversary of Manzoni&#x27;s death. It was followed three days later by the same performers at La Scala. Verdi conducted his work at major venues in Europe.

Verdi composed the last part of the text, &quot;Libera me&quot;, first, as his contribution to the &quot;Messa per Rossini&quot; that he had begun after Gioachino Rossini had died, already contained the music that later begins the &quot;Dies irae&quot; sequence.

Considered too operatic to be performed in a liturgical setting, the Requiem is usually given in concert form; it takes around 90 minutes to perform. Musicologist David Rosen calls it &quot;probably the most frequently performed major choral work composed since the compilation of Mozart&#x27;s Requiem&quot;.

==Composition history==
After Gioachino Rossini&#x27;s death in 1868, Verdi suggested to his publisher Ricordi that a number of Italian composers collaborate on a Requiem in Rossini&#x27;s honour. He began the effort by submitting the concluding movement, the Libera me. During the next year a &quot;Messa per Rossini&quot; was compiled by Verdi and twelve other famous Italian composers of the time. The premiere was scheduled for 13 November 1869, the first anniversary of Rossini&#x27;s death, but on 4 November, nine days before the premiere, the organising committee abandoned it. Verdi blamed this on the scheduled conductor, Angelo Mariani. He pointed to Mariani&#x27;s lack of enthusiasm for the project, although in fact the conductor had been a part of the organising committee and did his best to support Verdi, this episode marked the beginning of the end of their friendship. The composition remained unperformed until 1988, when Helmuth Rilling premiered the complete &quot;Messa per Rossini&quot; in Stuttgart, Germany, presented at festivals and recorded.
On 22 May 1873, the Italian writer and humanist Alessandro Manzoni, whom Verdi had admired all his adult life and met in 1868, died. Upon hearing of his death, Verdi resolved to complete a Requiem—this time entirely of his own writing—for Manzoni. Verdi traveled to Paris in June, where he commenced work on the Requiem, giving it the form we know today. It included a revised version of the Libera me originally composed for Rossini.

==Performance history==

===19th century===
The Requiem was first performed in the church of San Marco in Milan on 22 May 1874, the first anniversary of Manzoni&#x27;s death, as part of a church liturgy. Verdi himself conducted, and the four soloists were Teresa Stolz (soprano), Maria Waldmann (mezzo-soprano), Giuseppe Capponi (tenor) and (bass).

As Aida, Amneris and Ramfis respectively, Stolz, Waldmann, and Maini had all sung in the European premiere of &quot;Aida&quot; in 1872, and Capponi was also intended to sing the role of Radames at that premiere but was replaced due to illness. Teresa Stolz went on to a brilliant career, Waldmann retired very young in 1875, but the male singers appear to have faded into obscurity. Also, Teresa Stolz was engaged to Angelo Mariani in 1869, but she later left him.

The Requiem was repeated at La Scala three days later on 25 May with the same soloists and Verdi again conducting. It won immediate contemporary success, although not everywhere. It received seven performances at the Opéra-Comique in Paris, but the new Royal Albert Hall in London could not be filled for such a Catholic occasion. In Venice, impressive Byzantine ecclesiastical decor was designed for the occasion of the performance.

Its first performance in the United States was in Boston in 1878, by the Handel and Haydn Society.

It later disappeared from the standard choral repertoire, but made a reappearance in the 1930s and is now regularly performed and a staple of many choral societies.

===20th century and beyond===
The Requiem was reportedly performed approximately 16 times between 1943 and 1944 by prisoners in the concentration camp of Theresienstadt (also known as Terezín) under the direction of Rafael Schächter. The performances were presented under the auspices of the , a cultural organization in the Ghetto.

Since the 1990s, commemorations in the US and Europe have included memorial performances of the Requiem in honor of the Terezín performances. On the heels of previous performances held at the Terezín Memorial, Murry Sidlin performed the Requiem in Terezin in 2006 and rehearsed the choir in the same basement where the original inmates reportedly rehearsed. Part of the Prague Spring Festival, two children of survivors sang in the choir with their parents sitting in the audience.

The Requiem has been staged in a variety of ways several times. Achim Freyer created a production for the Deutsche Oper Berlin in 2006 that was revived in 2007, 2011 and 2013. In Freyer&#x27;s staging, the four sung roles, &quot;Der Weiße Engel&quot; (The White Angel), &quot;Der Tod-ist-die-Frau&quot; (Death is the Woman), &quot;Einsam&quot; (Solitude), and &quot;Der Beladene&quot; (The Load Bearer) are complemented by choreographed allegorical characters.

In 2011, Oper Köln premiered a full staging by Clemens Bechtel where the four main characters were shown in different life and death situations: the Fukushima nuclear disaster, a Turkish writer in prison, a young woman with bulimia, and an aid worker in Africa.

In 2021, the New York Metropolitan Opera performed the Requiem for the 20th anniversary of the September 11 attacks.

In 2025, the Dallas Symphony Orchestra and the Dallas Symphony Chorus, under the baton of JoAnn Falletta, will perform the Requiem as part of the 2025 American Choral Directors Association National Conference.

===Versions and arrangements===
For a Paris performance, Verdi revised the &quot;Liber scriptus&quot; to allow Maria Waldmann a further solo for future performances. Previously, the movement had been set as a choral fugue in a classical Baroque style. With its premiere at the Royal Albert Hall performance in May 1875, this revision became the definitive edition that has been most performed since, although the original version is included in critical editions of the work published by Bärenreiter and University of Chicago Press.

Franz Liszt transcribed the Agnus Dei for solo piano (S. 437). It has been recorded by Leslie Howard.

Carus-Verlag published a version in 2013 for a small ensemble of horn, double bass, gran cassa, timpani, marimba and piano, edited by Michael Betzner-Brandt, in order to make the music accessible for more choirs.

==Structure==
Verdi structured the liturgical text in movements as follows; Differently from traditional settings of the Requiem mass, he assigned several parts to one soloist. He also wrote duets such as Recordare, Lacrymosa and Agnus Dei, and a quartet of solo voices in the Domine Jesu Christe in the offertory.

* 1. Requiem
** Introit (chorus)
** Kyrie (soloists, chorus)
*2. Dies irae
** Dies irae (chorus)
** Tuba mirum (chorus)
** Mors stupebit (bass)
** Liber scriptus (mezzo-soprano, chorus – chorus only in original version)
** Quid sum miser (soprano, mezzo-soprano, tenor)
** Rex tremendae (soloists, chorus)
** Recordare (soprano, mezzo-soprano)
** Ingemisco (tenor)
** Confutatis maledictis (bass, chorus)
** Lacrymosa (soloists, chorus)
* 3. Offertory
* 4. Sanctus (double chorus)
* 5. Agnus Dei (soprano, mezzo-soprano, chorus)
* 6. Lux aeterna (mezzo-soprano, tenor, bass)
* 7. Libera me (soprano, chorus)

==Music==
Throughout the work, Verdi used vigorous rhythms, sublime melodies, and dramatic contrasts—much as he did in his operas—to express the powerful emotions engendered by the text.

=== Movements ===

The work begins with the introit, with muted cellos and later all strings playing a slow descending motif in A minor, into which the choir mutters in low register the prayer for eternal rest. The soloists enter in turn for the Kyrie, with an &quot;exalted theme which soars up over a chromatically descending bass&quot;.

The Dies irae begins, evoking Last Judgment in &quot;thunderous chords, a jagged rising phrase, a wailing chant lurching backwards and forwards, giant bass-drum blows on the offbeat, precipitous woodwind scales, strings tremolando, uprushes of violins, and rapid rhythmic figures splayed out by the trumpets&quot;. The terrifying and recognizable passage is repeated several times, within the section and in the final Libera me. The four orchestral trumpets are augmented by an offstage quartet to produce a call to judgement in the &quot;Tuba mirum&quot;. &quot;Liber scriptus&quot; is a passionate mezzo-soprano solo. &quot;Rex tremendae&quot; alternates a &quot;majestic dotted theme&quot; for the lower voices with a &quot;wide-spanned phrase&quot; salva me, building to a climax. &quot;Ingemisco&quot; is a lyrical tenor solo &quot;with a moment of profound peace&quot;. &quot;Confutatis&quot;, a bass solo of &quot;dignity and resignation&quot;, pleads for God&#x27;s mercy. After a return of Dies irae, &quot;Lacrymosa&quot; closes the sequence with a &quot;desolate theme&quot;, repeated and each time orchestrated more densely, leading to a muted melancholic end. The final Amen, however, is sung as a G major chord, &quot;like a revelation&quot;.

The Offertory is sung by the quartet of soloists.

The Sanctus, a complex eight-part fugue scored for double chorus, begins with a brassy fanfare to announce him &quot;who comes in the name of the Lord&quot;. The orchestra plays animated accompaniment throughout the fugue. &quot;Pleni sunt coeli&quot; is a &quot;serene version of the fugue subject&quot;, still to vivid strings.

For the Agnus Dei, soprano and mezzo-soprano sing a long theme unison in octaves without accompaniment. The movement consists of variations of this theme, harmonised in soft colours, with a calm counterpoint of three flutes, alternating between the soloists and the choir.

In &quot;Lux aeterna&quot;, mezzo-soprano, tenor and bass sing alone, the mezzo-soprano beginning in B-flat major to a tremolo of divided violins, shimmering as a depiction of eternal light. It is answered by the bass in B-flat minor, with bassoons, trombones and tuba. The movement ends in a serene and hopeful mood.

In the &quot;Libera me&quot;, the oldest music by Verdi in the Requiem, the soprano soloist interacts with the choir for the prayer &quot;Deliver me, Lord, from eternal death ... when you will come to judge the world by fire&quot;. The soprano first recites the prayer invoking a mood of &quot;terrible urgency&quot;. The choir murmurs, praying for salvation from everlasting death. The soprano interrupts, with accompaniment recalling the music of the Dies irae. In the following &quot;Tremens factus&quot;, the soprano gasps breathless phrases above a dense texture of muted strings and low flutes. The &quot;crashing chords&quot; of the Dies irae break in, with the passage repeated completely. Then the choir repeats the very beginning, &quot;Requiem aeternam&quot;, with the solo soprano joining softly. The soprano repeats the first &quot;Libera me&quot;, calling the choir to an agitated four-part fugue that illustrates the shattering of the world by fire, with a &quot;devastating climax&quot;. The soprano finally mutters a two-fold &quot;Libera me&quot; on a single low note, ever softer, interpreted as &quot;a prayer as much for the living as for the dead&quot;.

=== Female voices ===
When the Requiem was composed, female singers were not permitted to perform in Catholic Church rituals (such as a requiem mass). However, from the beginning Verdi intended to use female singers in the work. In his open letter proposing the &quot;Requiem&quot; project (when it was still conceived as a multi-author &quot;Requiem&quot; for Rossini), Verdi wrote: &quot;If I were in the good graces of the Holy FatherPope Pius IXI would beg him to permit—if only for this one time—that women take part in the performance of this music; but since I am not, it will fall to someone else better suited to obtain this decree.&quot; In Verdi&#x27;s Requiem, two of the four soloists were women, and the chorus included female voices. This may have slowed the work&#x27;s acceptance in Italy.

=== Reception ===
At the time of its premiere, the Requiem was criticized by some as being too operatic in style for the religious subject matter. According to Gundula Kreuzer, &quot;Most critics did perceive a schism between the religious text (with all its musical implications) and Verdi&#x27;s setting&quot;. Some viewed it negatively as &quot;an opera in ecclesiastical robes&quot;, or alternatively, as a religious work, but one in &quot;dubious musical costume&quot;. While the majority of critics agreed that the music was &quot;dramatic&quot;, some felt that such treatment of the text was appropriate, or at least permissible. As to the quality of the music, the critical consensus agreed that the work displayed &quot;fluent invention, beautiful sound effects and charming vocal writing&quot;. Critics were divided between praise and condemnation with respect to Verdi&#x27;s willingness to break standard compositional rules for musical effect, such as his use of consecutive fifths.

==Instrumentation==
The work is scored for four vocal soloists and the following orchestra:

:woodwind: 3 flutes (3rd doubling piccolo), 2 oboes, 2 clarinets, 4 bassoons
:brass: 4 horns, 8 trumpets (4 offstage), 3 trombones, ophicleide 
:percussion: timpani, bass drum
:strings: violins I, II, violas, violoncellos, double basses.

<text>The Timeline of U.S. Railway History depends upon the definition of a railway, as follows: A means of conveyance of passengers and goods on wheeled vehicles running on rails, also known as tracks.

==1795–1829==
* 1795–96 &amp; 1799–1804 or &#x27;05 — In 1795, Charles Bulfinch, the architect of Boston&#x27;s famed State House first employed a temporary funicular railway with specially designed dumper cars to decapitate&quot; &#x27;the Tremont&#x27;s&#x27; &quot;Beacon Hill summit and begin the decades long land reclamation projects which created most of the real estate in Boston&#x27;s lower elevations of today from broad mud flats, such as South Boston, Eastern parts of Dorchester, much of the shorelines of the entire Charles River basin on both the left and right banks and Brighton from mud flats, and most famously and tellingly especially the Back Bay.
* 1815-1820s One interpretation of historical documents indicates the same equipment was used for a longer, more ambitious period to level and effectively remove &#x27;The Tremont&#x27;, Copely, Cope&#x27;s, and Beacon Hills again into what became Boston&#x27;s Back Bay. These moves were far from completing the project, photos in the 1850s and recent scholarship show the majority of the Back Bay was still tidewater.

===1810s–1830s===
*1800–1825 Various inventors and entrepreneurs make suggestions about building model railways in the United States. Around Coalbrookdale in the United Kingdom, mining railways become increasingly common. An early steam locomotive is given a test run in 1804, but is then wrecked carelessly. For unknown reasons, the inventor does not rebuild it for nearly two decades.
* 1809 Scottsman quarry owner Thomas Leiper, in 1809 when denied a charter to build a canal along the Crum Creek from his quarry to the docks in the tidewater, commissions a short temporary railroad test track in the yard of the Bull&#x27;s Head Tavern in Philadelphia. The track had a grade of one inch and a half to the yard, with a 4% grade to test whether a horse could successfully pull against the slope.
* 1810–1829 The Leiper Railroad was a short horse drawn railroad of three quarters of a mile opens in 1810 after the quarry owner, Thomas Leiper, failed to obtain a charter with legal rights-of-way to instead build his desired canal along Crum Creek. The quarry man&#x27;s &#x27;make-do&#x27; railroad solution was the continent&#x27;s &quot;first chartered railway, first operational non-temporary railway, first well documented railroad, &quot;and&quot; first constructed railroad&quot; also &quot;meant to be permanent&quot;. It was perhaps the only railroad replaced by a canal, and also one of the first to close, and of those, perhaps is alone in reopening again in 1858.

==1825–1832==
Inspired by the speedy success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway (1825) in England&#x27;s railway historical record, capitalists in the United States — already embarking upon great public works infrastructure projects to connect the new territories of the United States with the older seaboard cities industries by the canals of America&#x27;s Canal Age, almost overnight began dreaming up projects using railroads — a technology in its infancy, but one employing steam engines which were rapidly becoming widely known from their successful use on steamboats. American steam engine pioneers were willing to experiment with Heat Engines using higher pressures than the mainly Atmospheric engines still fashionable in Great Britain. The rest of the world lagged the two English speaking nations. Railroads began to be proposed where canals wouldn&#x27;t do, or would be too costly and with an increase in rolling stock tonnage capacity, locomotive power, and a growing confidence born of experience and new materials in less than three decades, the United States generally would discard canals as the principal design choice in favor of far more capable freight haulage technologies.

* 1825 American John Stevens (inventor), builds a test track and runs a locomotive around it in his summer home estate, Hoboken, New Jersey. This partially settles the tractive power questions, showing that on level track, metal on metal wheels can provide tractive effort and pull a load. The ability for any engine to do so on a grade is still widely doubted in the press and minds of potential investors (pubs, clubs, boardrooms, etc.), while the minds of many potential investors were well aware that most railroads in the capital poor United States would have to surmount significant grades to be useful technology. And while news from Europe was delayed 4–8 weeks, well connected Americans were aware in general of United Kingdom news coverage&#x27;s and to a lesser extent, that of continental European developments. In consequence, the 1825 success of the Stockton and Darlington Railway only gradually eroded the three-way nay-sayer beliefs that the careful expensive gentle engineered grades extant in the early British railways was impracticable in most cases in America and that such grades were necessary since steel on iron rails would not provide traction on hills, were it possible to build a locomotive engine powerful enough to surmount such grades. In each case, it would take experience and success against such over at least several months before the misconceptions fell into disdain.
* 1826: The industrial animal powered Granite Railroad opens in Quincy, Massachusetts, to convey quarried granite for the Bunker Hill monument. It later becomes a common carrier railroad. 
:* 1827: Taking advantage of seasonal freezing of the Lehigh Canal, and with materials prepared in advance, the Lehigh Coal &amp; Navigation Company (LC&amp;N) converts their 1818–19 built uniformly graded wagon road into a gravity railroad in just four months of construction. 
 The resultant Summit Hill &amp; Mauch Chunk Railroad, where mules rode special cars down as well, after the coal hoppers, then returned empties up the nine mile return trip, became the first U.S. railway to carry passengers in the same year of 1827. In less than two years the railway was attracting so many visitors, it began charging fares, and then added and operated special tourism excursions on Sunday as a tourist road — which role it carried into 1932 as the world&#x27;s acknowledged first roller coaster. In 1847 the cable railway return track was constructed with planes climbing two prominences along Pisgah Ridge, shortening the up trip to twenty minutes from nearly four hours by mule. 
; 1830s
:*The Baltimore and Ohio is incorporated in 1827 and officially opens in 1830. Other railroads soon follow, including the Camden and Amboy by 1832.
*August 8, 1829: The &quot;Stourbridge Lion&quot;, first steam locomotive imported into the US, is tested along tracks built by the Delaware and Hudson company. Deemed too heavy for the company&#x27;s rails, it and its three brethren are converted to stationary engines for cable railway parts of the transportation system.
*1830 ushers in a flurry of railroad incorporations, charter applications, grants and beginnings of construction. The B&amp;O opens its first stretch to Ellicott&#x27;s Mills and begins regular scheduled passenger services on schedule, May 24, 1830.
* 1830 the Beaver Meadows Railroad from Beaver Meadows, Pennsylvania, is incorporated and constructed to open a second major coal field to the Lehigh Canal at Parryville beyond the Lehigh Gap. This would form the seed company of the first class Lehigh Valley Railroad after the 1870s.

* 1831 The DeWitt Clinton locomotive, built by the West Point Foundry in New York for the Mohawk and Hudson Railroad, made its first test run on July 2, 1831.
*1830s–1860s: Enormous railway building booms in the United States. The mill owners of Lowell and New Hampshire launch the Boston and Lowell Railroad to parallel the historic Middlesex Canal, which had enabled their mills success; this is the first direct attack rail companies mounted against canal interests.
Railroads gradually replace canals as the first-choice mode of transportation infrastructure to champion and build, while canals hold a whip hand on economy for decades more, but falter on flexible destinations, speed, and where they suffer seasonal stoppages yet service year round needs. By the 1860s, in any case, where all the important older canals were to be found any canal with functions satisfiable by parallel railways (excepting by definition, ship canals) is eyed by investors to be supplanted by a competing railroad. The idea of a rail network in the US, which is by then showing early signs some areas have overbuilt in the Eastern United States is still not a common business model. Cut throat competitive capitalism, not co-operation are the rule, and the decade kicks off the forty years or so of the robber barons and excesses in capitalism.

<doc id="254046" wikidata="Q7233992" url="?curid=254046" title="Postal Reorganization Act">
<text>The Postal Reorganization Act of 1970 was a law passed by the United States Congress that abolished the then U.S. Post Office Department, which was a part of the Cabinet, and created the U.S. Postal Service, a corporation-like independent agency authorized by the U.S. government as an official service for the delivery of mail in the United States. President Richard Nixon signed the Act in law on August 12, 1970.

The legislation was a direct outcome of the U.S. postal strike of 1970. Prior to the act, postal workers were not permitted by law to engage in collective bargaining. In the act, the four major postal unions (National Association of Letter Carriers, American Postal Workers Union, National Postal Mail Handlers Union, and the National Rural Letter Carriers&#x27; Association) won full collective bargaining rights: the right to negotiate on wages, benefits and working conditions, although they still were not allowed the right to strike.

The first paragraph of the act reads:

The Postal Reorganization Act (at 39 USC 410(c)(2)) exempts the USPS from Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) disclosure of &quot;information of a commercial nature, including trade secrets, whether or not obtained from a person outside the Postal Service, which under good business practice would not be publicly disclosed&quot;.

<text>Lorna Crozier, (born 24 May 1948) is a Canadian poet, author, and former chair of the Writing Department at the University of Victoria. She is the author of twenty-five books and was named an Officer of the Order of Canada in 2011 as one of Canada&#x27;s pre-eminent poets and for her teaching. Crozier is credited as Lorna Uher on some of her earlier works.

==Life==
Crozier was born in Swift Current, Saskatchewan in 1948. Alcohol and poverty was a common backdrop in her childhood, which later became inspiration for her poetry.

Crozier attended the University of Saskatchewan where she received her B.A. in 1969, and the University of Alberta where she received her M.A. in 1980. Crozier then went on to become a high school English teacher and guidance counsellor. During these years, her first poem was published in &quot;Grain&quot; magazine.

In addition to her professorship at the University of Victoria, Crozier has taught creative writing at the Banff School of Fine Arts, the Saskatchewan Summer School of the Arts, and the Sechelt Summer Writing Festival. Crozier has served as the writer-in-residence at the Cypress Hills Community College in 1983, the Regina Public Library, and the University of Toronto in 1989.

Crozier has authored twenty-five books of work, which typically focus on human relationships, the natural world, language, memory, and perception. Alongside partner Patrick Lane, Crozier has co-authored &quot;No Longer Two People&quot; (1979), and co-edited &quot;Breathing Fire: Canada&#x27;s New Poets&quot; (1995) and &quot;Breathing Fire 2&quot; (2004).
A glowing book review from The Globe and Mail by Jacqueline Baker on Crozier&#x27;s book, &quot;Small Beneath the Sky: A Prairie Memoir&quot; emphasized Crozier&#x27;s prairie roots.

She has received a 1992 Governor General&#x27;s Award, the Canadian Authors Association Award for Poetry, the National Magazine Award (Gold Medal), and first prize in the National CBC Literary Competition. Crozier received the University of Victoria&#x27;s Distinguished Professors Award and the University of Regina presented her with an honorary Doctorate of Law in 2004. In 2015, she received honorary degrees from Simon Fraser University and McGill University.

Crozier has given various benefit readings for organizations such as the Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, Wintergreen Studios, The Land Conservancy of British Columbia, the Victoria READ Society, and PEERS, a group devoted to getting sex workers off the streets. She has read her poetry on every continent other than Antarctica, and on 19 May 2005 Crozier recited a poem for Queen Elizabeth II as part of Saskatchewan&#x27;s Centennial Celebration.

In 2009 she was made a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and in 2011 Crozier became an Officer of the Order of Canada.

Her memoir &quot;Through the Garden: A Love Story (with Cats)&quot; was shortlisted for the 2020 Hilary Weston Writers&#x27; Trust Prize for Nonfiction.

Crozier is a supporter of literacy, animal rights, and the environment.

<text>Motocross is a form of off-road motorcycle racing held on enclosed off-road circuits. The sport evolved from motorcycle trials competitions held in the United Kingdom.

==History==
Motocross first evolved in Britain from motorcycle trials competitions, such as the Auto-Cycle Clubs&#x27;s first quarterly trial in 1909 and the Scottish Six Days Trial that began in 1912. When organisers dispensed with delicate balancing and strict scoring of trials in favour of a race to become the fastest rider to the finish, the activity became known as &quot;hare scrambles&quot;, said to have originated in the phrase, &quot;a rare old scramble&quot; describing one such early race. Though known as scrambles racing (or just scrambles) in the United Kingdom, the sport grew in popularity and the competitions became known internationally as &quot;motocross racing&quot;, by combining the French word for motorcycle, &quot;motocyclette&quot;, into a blend with &quot;cross country&quot;.

The first known scramble race in the world took place in Camberley, Surrey in 1924. The 100th anniversary of the very first Motocross race was commemorated in March 2024. The same cub that ran the 1924 event ran it again over the same land. During the 1930s the sport grew in popularity, especially in Britain where teams from the Birmingham Small Arms Company (BSA), Norton, Matchless, Rudge, and AJS competed in the events. The first motocross race held on an artificial track inside a stadium took place on August 28, 1948, at Buffalo Stadium in the Paris suburb of Montrouge. The event was the forerunner to supercross competitions.

Off-road motorcycles from that era differed little from those used on the street. The intense competition over rugged terrain led to technical improvements in motorcycles. Rigid frames gave way to suspensions by the early 1930s, and swinging fork rear suspension appeared by the early 1950s, several years before manufacturers incorporated it in the majority of production street bikes. The period after World War II was dominated by BSA, which had become the largest motorcycle company in the world. BSA riders dominated international competitions throughout the 1940s.
In 1952 the FIM, motorcycling&#x27;s international governing body, set up an individual European Championship using a 500 cc engine displacement formula. In 1957 it was upgraded to World Championship status. In 1962 a 250 cc world championship was established and, new rules were adopted dividing the races into two 45 minute heat races that were referred to as motos.

In the smaller 250 cc category companies with two-stroke motorcycles came into their own. Companies such as Husqvarna from Sweden, CZ from the former Czechoslovakia, Bultaco from Spain and Greeves from England became popular due to their lightness and agility.

A significant moment in motocross history occurred during the 1963 FIM Motocross World Championship when ČZ factory rider Vlastimil Valek rode a 263cc two-stroke motorcycle to win the first moto of the 500cc Czechoslovakian Motocross Grand Prix ahead of a field of top-class, four stroke motorcycles. The victory marked a turning point in motocross history as, it was the first win by a two-stroke powered motorcycle in the premier division of the Motocross World Championships.

By the mid-1960s, advances in two-stroke engine technology meant that the heavier, four-stroke machines were relegated to niche competitions. Riders from Belgium and Sweden began to dominate the sport during this period.
Motocross arrived in the United States in 1966 when Swedish champion, Torsten Hallman rode an exhibition event against the top American TT riders at the Corriganville Movie Ranch also known as Hopetown in Simi Valley, California. The following year Hallman was joined by other motocross stars including Roger DeCoster, Joël Robert, and Dave Bickers. They dominated the event, placing their lightweight two-strokes into the top six finishing positions. A motorcycle sales boom in the United States fueled by the Baby Boomer generation, helped to spark a growth in the popularity of motocross among young Americans.

Japanese motorcycle manufacturers began challenging the European factories for supremacy in the motocross world by the late 1960s. Suzuki claimed the first world championship for a Japanese factory when Joël Robert won the 1970 250 cc crown. In 1972, the American Motorcyclist Association (AMA) inaugurated the AMA Motocross Championships and, held its first stadium race at the Los Angeles Coliseum, promoted by Mike Goodwin and Terry Tiernan, then-president of the AMA. The stadium event, won by 16-year-old Marty Tripes, paved the way for constructed, stadium-based motocross events known as supercross.

In 1975, the FIM introduced a 125 cc world championship. European riders continued to dominate international motocross competitions throughout the 1970s with Belgian or Swedish riders winning ten Motocross des Nations (MXDN) events between 1969 and 1980 but, by the 1980s, American riders had caught up with American teams winning a string of 13 consecutive MXDN victories between 1981 and 1993. In 1978, Akira Watanabe became the first non-European competitor to win a motocross world championship and, in 1982 Brad Lackey became the first individual American motocross world champion.

From the late 1970s to early 1990s, Japanese motorcycle manufacturers presided over a boom period in motocross technology. The typical air-cooled two-strokes with twin-shock rear suspension and telescopic front forks gave way to water-cooled engines and single-shock absorber rear suspension and &quot;upside-down&quot; (or inverted) front forks. Although the advancement of two-stroke engine technology was the primary focus of the major Japanese motorcycle manufacturers well into the mid 1990s, a rekindled interest in engineering a competitive, lightweight four-stroke motocross race bike was expressed among several brands, including Yamaha Motor Corporation and Husqvarna.

Facing tightening federal emissions regulations in the United States, the AMA increased the allowable displacement capacity for four-stroke engines in 1997, in an effort to encourage manufacturers to develop environmentally friendlier four-stroke machines. Due to the low relative power output of a four-stroke engine compared to the then-dominating two-stroke design, the displacement limit of a four-stroke power motocross bike was raised to 250cc in the 125 class and 550cc in the 250 class.

The new regulations resulted in competitors aboard four-strokes made by smaller European manufacturers, with Husqvarna, Husaberg, and KTM winning world championships on four-stroke machinery. In 1997, Yamaha unveiled a prototype 400cc four-stroke motorcycle, the YZM 400, which was debuted in the FIM Motocross World Championship. The motorcycle made its U.S. debut in 1997, where Yamaha Factory Racing rider Doug Henry led every lap of the main event at the 1997 AMA Supercross Finale and became the first person to win an AMA Supercross race on a four-stroke powered motorcycle. Following Yamaha&#x27;s release of the production model YZ400F in 1998, Henry won the 250 AMA Motocross Championship and became the first person to win a major AMA Motocross title on a four-stroke powered motorcycle. This success motivated the remaining major manufacturers, Honda, Kawasaki, and Suzuki, to develop their own four-stroke motocross race bikes. By 2006, every manufacturer had begun competing with four-stroke machines in the AMA 125 (FIM MX2) and 250 (MX1) classes.

The sport has further evolved into a sub-discipline similar to supercross known as arenacross, which is held in small indoor arenas. Classes were also formed for all-terrain vehicles. Freestyle motocross (FMX) events where riders are judged on their jumping and aerial acrobatic skills have gained popularity, as has supermoto, where motocross machines race both on tarmac and off-road. Vintage motocross (VMX) events take place – usually for motorcycles predating the 1975 model year.
Many VMX races also include a &quot;Post Vintage&quot; portion, which usually includes bikes dating until 1983.

== Major competitions ==
===FIM Motocross World Championship===

The FIM Grand Prix Motocross World Championship is predominantly held in Europe, but also includes events in North America, South America, Asia, Australia, and Africa. It is the major Motocross series worldwide. There are three classes: MXGP for 450cc machines, MX2 for 250cc machines, and Women&#x27;s MX. Competitions consist of two races which are called &quot;motos&quot; with a duration of 30 minutes plus two laps.

===AMA Motocross Championship===
The AMA Motocross Championship begins in mid May and continues until late August. The championship consists of eleven rounds at eleven major tracks all over the continental United States. There are three classes: the 250cc Motocross Class for 150–250 cc 4-stroke machines, the 450cc Motocross Class for 251–450 cc 4-stroke machines and a 250cc Women&#x27;s Class, using the same rules as men&#x27;s 250cc. Race events take place over two motos of 30 minutes plus two laps each.

===Motocross des Nations===

The annual Motocross des Nations is held at the end of the year when National and World Championship series have ended. The competition involves teams of three riders representing their nations. Each rider competes in a different class (MX1, MX2, and &quot;Open&quot;). There are three motos with two classes competing per moto. The location of the event changes from year to year. The United States, Belgium and Great Britain have had the greatest success.

===British Motocross Championship===

Th British Motocross Championship is the main UK off-road competition and organised into classes of MX1 and MX2. MX1 is for 250  cc to 450 cc (fourstroke) and MX2 for 175 cc to 250 cc fourstroke motorcycles. In 2007 an additional youth class, the MXY2 class, was added to the programme at selected rounds.

A &quot;Veterans&quot; series was introduced in 2009 with just two rounds but the demand for places was so high that from 2011 the Veterans series will have three rounds, held over six races.

==Sports derived from motocross==
A number of other types of motorcycle sport have been derived from Motocross.

=== Supercross ===


Supercross is a cycle racing sport involving specialized high-performance off-road motorcycles on constructed dirt tracks with steep jumps and obstacles. Compared to regular motocross, supercross tracks generally have much shorter straights and tighter turns. Professional supercross races, held as the AMA Supercross Championship in the United States, are held almost exclusively in professional baseball and football stadiums.

The supercross season takes place during the winter and spring months, with races in a different city every weekend. There are 17 races in the AMA Supercross Championship schedule, normally beginning in Anaheim, California, and ending in Las Vegas, Nevada. The 250 cc class is split into two series, east and west. The 450 cc class has one large series with events across the US and Canada.

In 2022, the World Supercross Championship was demerged from the AMA Supercross Championship, to be held as a standalone series once more. The series previously ran from 2003 to 2008. Supercross events are also held in Australia, known as the Australian Supercross Championship promoted by Motorcycling Australia. Along with the SX Open held in Auckland, New Zealand, the country&#x27;s biggest event the Aus X-Open forms part of the Oceania Supercross Championship.

=== Freestyle ===
Freestyle Motocross (FMX), a relatively new variation of supercross started by the South African champion, Marco Urzi, does not involve racing and instead it concentrates on performing acrobatic stunts while jumping motocross bikes. The winner is chosen by a group of judges. The riders are scored on style, level of trick difficulty, best use of the course, and frequently, crowd reactions. FMX was introduced to the X Games and mainstream audiences in 1999.

=== SuperMoto ===
Supermoto uses motocross bikes converted for racing on tracks consisting of three sections: flat dirt, dirt obstacles, and paved road. The bikes have special road-racing tires with grooved tread to grip both the pavement and dirt. Some tracks for these race events have jumps, berms, and whoops like motocross tracks. For special events, the Supermoto track may incorporate metal ramps for jumps that can be disassembled and taken to other locations. Supermoto races may take place at modified go-kart tracks, road racing tracks, or even street racing tracks. There are also classes for children, such as the 85 cc class.

Supermoto began in the US the late 1970s when TV journalist Gavin Trippe envisioned a racing event that would prove who the best motorcycle racer was. From 1980 to 1985, he organized a yearly event called &quot;The Superbikers&quot;, which pitted the top riders from three disciplines, flat track, road racing, and motocross against one another on modified bikes raced on special tracks on the television show. Its first exposure to a wide audience came on the American television program ABC&#x27;s &quot;Wide World of Sports&quot; in 1979. After 1985, the sport declined and received little exposure in the US, but in Europe, it started gaining popularity, and in 2003 it was revived in the US, when the name became Supermoto.

=== ATV/Quad Motocross ===
Throughout the United States and the United Kingdom there are many quad racing clubs with enduro and quadcross sections. GNCC Racing began around 1980 and includes hare scramble and enduro type races. To date, events are mainly held in the eastern part of the United States. GNCC racing features many types of obstacles such as, hill climbing, creek and log crossings, dirt roads and wooded trails.

The ATV National Motocross Championship was formed around 1985. ATVMX events are hosted at motocross racetracks throughout the United States. ATVMX consists of several groups, including the Pro (AMA Pro) and Amateur (ATVA) series. Championship mud racing (CMR) saw its infancy in 2006 as leaders of the ATV industry recognized a need for uniformity of classes and rules of various local mud bog events. Providing standardized rules created the need for a governing body that both racers and event promoters could turn to and CMR was born. Once unified, a true points series was established and lead to a national championship for what was once nothing more than a hobby for most. In 2007 the finalized board of directors was established and the first races were held in 2008. Currently, the CMR schedule includes eight competition dates spanning from March to November. Points are awarded throughout the season in several different competition classes of ATV and SxS Mud Racing. The 2008 year included Mud Bog and Mudda-Cross competitions, but the 2009 and future seasons will only have Mudda-Cross competitions. Classes range from 0 to 499 cc, to a Super-Modified class which will allow any size ATV in competition.

=== Sidecarcross ===
Sidecar racing, known as Sidecarcross has been around since the 1950s but has declined in popularity since the mid‑1980s. This variant is common in Europe, with a few followers in the United States, New Zealand, and Australia. The premier competition, the Sidecarcross World Championship, is contested on European tracks only and almost exclusively by Europeans.

Motocross sidecars are purpose built frames that resemble an ordinary motocross-cycle with a flat platform to stand on attached to either side and a handlebar at waist height to hold on to. The side of the &quot;chair&quot; (slang for the platform) usually follows the side of the road the nation in question drives upon, but not always. The passenger balances the bike by being a counterweight, especially in corners and on jumps. It is driven on ordinary crosstracks.

It is very physically demanding, especially for the passenger. This is reflected in most in the Swedish term for passenger, &quot;burkslav&quot;, roughly translated as trunk/barrel-slave. This name comes from the early sidecars which resembled road motorcycle sidecars and not today&#x27;s platform.

The major frame builders today are VMC, BSU, AYR, EML and Woodenleg. Ordinary engines can be used, but size matters and two engines purpose built for sidecars exist, Zabel (Germany) and MTH (Austria) are most common. Four-strokes are becoming more common, usually KTM (Austria).

=== Pit bikes and mini-motocross ===
Pit bikes are small motorbikes that participants in powersports events use to ride around the pits, which are the staging areas where team support vehicles are located. More recently, they have been used in races held on either supercross or motocross tracks. Numerous performance and aesthetic upgrades are often applied to pit bikes.

Originally, there was only one way to acquire a pit bike. A rider would buy a child&#x27;s minibike, usually a Honda CRF110 or Kawasaki KLX110, and apply all the necessary upgrades and modifications to build a competitive pit bike. Of course, a rider could also buy a used bike. Since 2004, manufacturers like Thumpstar have begun designing, manufacturing, importing, and selling already complete pit bikes. These bikes are less expensive, and require less time to complete.

Pit bikes are powered by 4-stroke, horizontal, single-cylinder engines ranging anywhere in displacement from 49 cc to 195 cc. A typical pit bike is usually a small dirt bike, but it has become common to be able to buy pit bikes with street-style wheels and tires. Pit bikes with street tires, as opposed to knobby tires, are used in Mini Supermoto Racing.

Pit bikes are frequently heavily customized with decorative add-ons and performance-enhancing parts. Many riders and mechanics bore-out or replace engines in order to increase displacement and therefore power output. Heavy duty suspension systems are often a necessary addition, since the stock mini-bike suspension was designed for a small child. Wheel, brake, and tire upgrades are sometimes performed to improve handling.

Pit bikes also have their own separate competitions held with classes generally corresponding to wheel size. This is a notable difference from Motocross and Supercross competition, where classes are separated by engine displacement. Pit bike racing is a relatively new niche of motocross, and as such, there is no official governing body similar to the AMA.

<doc id="254054" wikidata="Q878352" url="?curid=254054" title="Rumor">
<text>A rumor (American English), or rumour (British English; see spelling differences; derived from Latin &#x27;noise&#x27;), is an unverified piece of information circulating among people, especially without solid evidence.

In the social sciences, a rumor involves a form of a statement whose veracity is not quickly or ever confirmed. In addition, some scholars have identified rumor as a subset of propaganda. Sociology, psychology, and communication studies have widely varying definitions of rumor.

Rumors are also often discussed with regard to misinformation and disinformation (the former often seen as simply false and the latter seen as deliberately false, though usually from a government source given to the media or a foreign government).

== Early work ==
French and German social science research on rumor locates the modern scholarly definition of it to the pioneering work of the German William Stern in 1902. Stern experimented on rumor involving a &quot;chain of subjects&quot; who passed a story from &quot;mouth to ear&quot; without the right to repeat or explain it. He found that the story was shortened and changed by the time it reached the end of the chain. His student was another pioneer in the field, Gordon Allport.

The experiment is similar to the children&#x27;s game Chinese whispers.

==&quot;A Psychology of Rumor&quot; (1944)==
&quot;A Psychology of Rumor&quot; was published by in 1944, in which he reports on his analysis of over one thousand rumors during World War II that were printed in the &quot;Boston Herald&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Rumor Clinic&quot; Column. He defines rumor as 
a proposition for belief of topical reference disseminated without official verification&quot;. So formidably defined, rumor is but a special case of informal social communications, including myth, legend, and current humor. From myth and legend it is distinguished by its emphasis on the topical. Where humor is designed to provoke laughter, rumor begs for belief.&quot;
Knapp identified three basic characteristics that apply to rumor: 
# they&#x27;re transmitted by word of mouth; 
# they provide &quot;information&quot; about a &quot;person, happening, or condition&quot;; and 
# they express and gratify &quot;the emotional needs of the community.&quot; 
Crucial to this definition and its characteristics is the emphasis on transmission (word of mouth, which then was heard and reported in the newspaper); on content (&quot;topical&quot; means that it can somehow be distinguished from trivial and private subjects—its domain is public issues); and on reception (&quot;emotional needs of the community&quot; suggests that though it is received by an individual from an individual, it is not comprehended in individual but community or social terms).

Based on his study of the newspaper column, Knapp divided those rumors into three types:
# Pipe dream rumors: reflect public desires and wished-for outcomes (e.g. Japan&#x27;s oil reserves were low and thus World War II would soon end).
# Bogie or fear rumors reflect feared outcomes (e.g. An enemy surprise attack is imminent).
# Wedge-driving rumors intend to undermine group loyalty or interpersonal relations (e.g. American Catholics were seeking to avoid the draft; German-Americans, Italian-Americans, Japanese-Americans were not loyal to the American side).

Knapp also found that negative rumors were more likely to be disseminated than positive rumors. These types also differentiate between positive (pipe dream) and negative (bogie and wedge-driving) rumors.

== &quot;The Psychology of Rumor&quot; (1947) ==
In the 1947 study, &quot;The Psychology of Rumor&quot;, Gordon Allport and Leo Postman concluded that, &quot;as rumor travels it [...] grows shorter, more concise, more easily grasped and told.&quot; This conclusion was based on a test of message diffusion between persons, which found that about 70% of details in a message were lost in the first 5-6 mouth-to-mouth transmissions.

In the experiment, a test subject was shown an illustration and given time to look it over. They were then asked to describe the scene from memory to a second test subject. This second test subject was then asked to describe the scene to a third, and so forth and so on. Each person&#x27;s reproduction was recorded. This process was repeated with different illustrations with very different settings and contents.

Allport and Postman used three terms to describe the movement of rumor. They are: &quot;leveling&quot;, &quot;sharpening&quot;, and &quot;assimilation&quot;. Leveling refers to the loss of detail during the transmission process; sharpening to the selection of certain details of which to transmit; and assimilation to a distortion in the transmission of information as a result of subconscious motivations.

Assimilation was observed when test subjects described the illustrations as they ought to be but not as they actually were. For example, in an illustration depicting a battle-scene, test subjects often incorrectly reported an ambulance truck in the background of the illustration as carrying &quot;medical supplies,&quot; when, in fact, it was clearly carrying boxes marked &quot;TNT (102).&quot;

== Social Cognition ==
In 2004, Prashant Bordia and Nicholas DiFonzo published their &quot;Problem Solving in Social Interactions on the Internet: Rumor As Social Cognition&quot; and found that rumor transmission is probably reflective of a &quot;collective explanation process.&quot; This conclusion was based on an analysis of archived message board discussions in which the statements were coded and analysed. It was found that 29% (the majority) of statements within these discussions could be coded as &quot;sense-making&quot; statements, which involved, &quot;[...] attempts at solving a problem.&quot;

It was noted that the rest of the discussion was constructed around these statements, further reinforcing the idea of collective problem solving. The researchers also found that each rumor went through a four-stage pattern of development in which a rumor was introduced for discussion, information was volunteered and discussed, and finally a resolution was drawn or interest was lost.

For the study, archived discussions concerning rumors on the internet and other computer networks such as BITnet were retrieved. As a rule, each discussion had a minimum of five statements posted over a period of at least two days. The statements were then coded as being one of the following: &quot;prudent&quot;, &quot;apprehensive&quot;, &quot;authenticating&quot;, &quot;interrogatory&quot;, &quot;providing information&quot;, &quot;belief&quot;, &quot;disbelief&quot;, &quot;sense-making&quot;, &quot;digressive&quot;, or &quot;un-codable&quot;. Each rumor discussion was then analysed based on this coding system. A similar coding system based on statistical analysis was applied to each discussion as a whole, and the aforementioned four-stage pattern of rumor discussion emerged.

There are four components of managing rumors that both of you need to understand for the sake of your relationship&#x27;s success. The first, anxiety (situational and personality), is when people who either have a more anxious personality, or people who are in an anxiety- lifting situation are more likely to create rumors in order to relieve some of their insecurities. The second component of managing rumors is ambiguity. Ambiguity is when someone is not sure about what is going on, so they end up assuming the worst. The third component is information importance. . Information is key, and if that information is not juicy or if it does not interest people, there won&#x27;t be rumors, but information can often be false. Information can also be ambiguous. The last component of managing rumors is credibility. Rumors are often spread by sources that are not credible. A rumor itself is not credible unless it is proven to be true. That is why people say to never trust the tabloids.

== Political Communication Strategy ==
Rumor has always played a major role in politics, with negative rumors about an opponent typically more effective than positive rumors about one&#x27;s own side.
In the past, much research on rumor came from psychological approaches (as the discussion of Allport and DiFonzio demonstrates above). The focus was especially on how statements of questionable veracity (absolutely false to the ears of some listeners) circulated orally from person to person. Scholarly attention to political rumors is at least as old as Aristotle&#x27;s &quot;Rhetoric&quot;; however, not until recently has any sustained attention and conceptual development been directed at political uses of rumor, outside of its role in war situations. Almost no work had been done until recently on how different forms of media and particular cultural-historical conditions may facilitate a rumor&#x27;s diffusion.

The Internet&#x27;s recent appearance as a new media technology has shown ever new possibilities for the fast diffusion of rumor, as the debunking sites such as snopes.com, urbanlegend.com, and factcheck.org demonstrate. Nor had previous research taken into consideration the particular form or style of deliberately chosen rumors for political purposes in particular circumstances (even though significant attention to the power of rumor for mass-media-diffused war propaganda has been in vogue since World War I; see Lasswell 1927). In the early part of the 21st century, some legal scholars have attended to political uses of rumor, though their conceptualization of it remains social psychological and their solutions to it as public problem are from a legal scholarly perspective, largely having to do with libel and privacy laws and the damage to personal reputations.

== Strategic Communication ==
Similar to their appearance and function in political communication, wherein rumors can be deployed for specific deleterious effect (rumor bomb) or can otherwise plague a candidate for office, rumors also play an important role in strategic communication. Strategic communication is the process of crafting messages in support of specific organizational goals, and is usually concerned with governments, militaries and Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs). Adroit strategic communication requires an understanding of stories, trends and memes circulating within a culture.

Rumors can be viewed as stories that seem rational but that are steeped into speculation, in connection with a certain narrative landscape (the vast array of cultural expression circulating within a community or region). In their book, &quot;Narrative Landmines: Rumors, Islamist Extremism and the Struggle for Strategic Influence&quot;, co-authors Daniel Bernardi, Pauline Hope Cheong, Chris Lundry and Scott W. Ruston coin the term narrative IED to help explain the function and danger of rumors in a strategic communication context. Rumors, as narrative IEDs, are low-cost, low-tech communication weapons that can be used by anyone to disrupt the efforts of communication, civil affairs or outreach campaigns such as those undertaken by governments in crisis response situations or militaries in insurgencies. As Bernardi notes, &quot;Like their explosive cousins, rumors can be created and planted by nearly anybody, require limited resources to utilize, can be deadly for those in its direct path, and can instil fear&quot;.

<doc id="254058" wikidata="Q1984754" url="?curid=254058" title="Five-second rule">
<text>The five-second rule, or sometimes the three-second rule, is a food hygiene urban legend that states a defined time window after which it is not safe to eat food (or sometimes to use cutlery) after it has been dropped on the floor or on the ground and thus exposed to contamination.

While the amount of microbes transferred to a dropped food does increase over time, and in some situations floors may be relatively clean of pathogens, the scientific consensus is opposed to such a general applied rule, and the origin of the idea is unclear. It is speculated to have originated from legends about Genghis Khan. It was first mentioned in print in 1995.

== History ==

The origins of the five-second rule are unclear. Food scientist Pawl Dawson and microbiologist Brian Sheldon have traced the origins to legends surrounding Genghis Khan in the 15th century. He is rumoured to have implemented the &quot;Khan Rule&quot; at his banquets. &quot;If food fell on the floor, it could stay there as long as Khan allowed,&quot; and the idea was that &quot;food prepared for Khan was so special that it would be good for anyone to eat no matter what.&quot;

The first known mention of the myth in modern print was in the 1995 novel &quot;Wanted: Rowing Coach&quot; as a &quot;twenty-second rule&quot;.

== Research ==
The five-second rule has received some scholarly attention. It has been studied as both a public health recommendation and a sociological effect.

=== University of Illinois ===
In 2003, Jillian Clarke, a high school student during an apprenticeship investigated the rule. She found 56% of men and 70% of women surveyed were familiar with the five-second rule. She also determined that a variety of foods were significantly contaminated by even brief exposure to a tile inoculated with &quot;E. coli&quot;. On the other hand, Clarke found no significant evidence of contamination on public flooring. For this work, Clarke received the 2004 Ig Nobel Prize in public health.

A more thorough study in 2007 using salmonella on wood, tiles, and nylon carpet, found that the bacteria could thrive under dry conditions even after twenty-eight days. Tested on surfaces that had been contaminated with salmonella eight hours previously, the bacteria could still contaminate bread and baloney lunchmeat in under five seconds. But a minute-long contact increased contamination about tenfold (especially on tile and carpet surfaces).

=== Rutgers University ===
Researchers at Rutgers University debunked the theory in 2016 by dropping watermelon cubes, gummy candies, plain white bread, and buttered bread from a height of onto surfaces slathered in &quot;Enterobacter aerogenes&quot;. The surfaces used were carpet, ceramic tile, stainless steel and wood. The food was left on the surface for intervals of 5, 30 and 300 seconds. The scientists assessed the amount of &quot;E. aerogenes&quot; transferred between surface and food. Since bacteria tended to be attracted to moisture, wet food had more risk to have bacteria transferred than dry food. To the surprise of the researchers, carpet transferred fewer bacteria than steel or tile. Wood was hard to pin down as it showed a large variation. &quot;The five-second rule is a significant oversimplification of what actually happens when bacteria transfer from a surface to food,&quot; Donald Schaffner, a Rutgers University biologist and an author of the research, stated in the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, &quot;Bacteria can contaminate instantaneously.&quot;

A pediatrician criticized the study for discounting the danger in consuming food after one touches other surfaces like refrigerator handles, light switches, and wallets, which have been found to be similarly contaminated with bacteria.

===Other===
A 2014 study by biology students at Aston University in England suggested that there may be a basis for the five-second rule. Anthony Hilton, head of microbiology at Aston University, indicated in 2017 that food dropped on a seemingly clean floor for a few moments can be eaten with minimal risk. According to Hilton, moist foods that are left on the floor for more than 30 seconds are contaminated with 10 times more bacteria than food that has been left on the floor for 3 seconds.

===Informal===
The five-second rule was featured in an episode of the Discovery Channel series &quot;MythBusters&quot;, which discovered that there was no significant difference in the number of bacteria collected. The aspects that affect the contamination process is the moisture, surface geometry and the location. An episode of &quot;Food Detectives&quot; found that bacteria will cling to food immediately.

<doc id="254059" wikidata="Q28460" url="?curid=254059" title="Handsfree">
<text>Handsfree is an adjective describing equipment that can be used without the use of hands (for example via voice commands) or, in a wider sense, equipment which needs only limited use of hands, or for which the controls are positioned so that the hand can occupy themselves with another task (such as driving) without needing to hunt far afield for the controls.

Devices that are typically used for handsfree communication use Bluetooth as its wireless technology. They still require a smartphone or other device to initiate a call. These devices include Bluetooth headsets, hands-free car kits (HFCK), and personal navigation devices (PND). Originally introduced as optional features connected by a wire to smartphones or other communication devices, they now generally are available with wireless technology. 

Bluetooth handsfree options are now also easily found in any high end automotive as part of the vehicle&#x27;s stereo system, or in after market stereo system units. This option utilizes the vehicle&#x27;s speakers to transmit the caller&#x27;s voice in the phone call and have an embedded microphone in the stereo unit itself, the steering wheel, or a separate wired microphone that can be placed anywhere in the vehicle.

== Mobile phones ==

Handsfree mobile phones are obligatory in many countries for use of a mobile phone while driving. However, studies have shown that even with a hands-free unit, the added distraction to the driver, and the increase in crash rates, are almost as substantial as when driving and talking on a normal mobile phone.

In the United Kingdom, as of 2003, it is illegal to use a handheld mobile phone while driving. Similar laws have been adopted in many jurisdictions worldwide, and many make provisions for hands-free phone use.

Installation of hands-free devices in the UK is governed by MPT 1362, which is now referred to as FCS 1362. A technical document created and updated by the Federation of Communication Services.

In Australia, all states have banned the use of a mobile phone while driving unless it is used with a handsfree headset.

== Software technologies ==
Since handsfree devices replace a phone&#x27;s own speaker and microphone capability in a phone call, they now also must deal with the same issues that standard mobile phones and land phones deal with. The main acoustic issues are echo cancellation and noise suppression, although there are others as well. There have been many ways developed to cancel echo in phone calls and results range from poor to excellent. 

These acoustic technologies must also remove or reduce the noise levels so that the caller is well understood. A person making a call from a handsfree device who is in a busy restaurant or while driving will introduce large levels of noise into the call. This situation is complicated as the software must not only remove the noise around him, but must transmit his voice clearly and loudly to whoever is connected to him. 

The best software solutions combine both echo cancellation and noise cancellation into a single technology so that the caller has the freedom to use a handsfree device anywhere they please. Having an acoustic solution with only one feature will dramatically reduce its flexibility.

== Driving ==

Handsfree driving is when driving without the hands.

<text>The Minnesota River () is a tributary of the Mississippi River, approximately 332 miles (534 km) long, in the U.S. state of Minnesota. It drains a watershed of in Minnesota and about in South Dakota and Iowa.

It rises in southwestern Minnesota, in Big Stone Lake on the Minnesota–South Dakota border just south of the Laurentian Divide at the Traverse Gap portage. It flows southeast to Mankato, then turns northeast. It joins the Mississippi at Mendota south of the Twin Cities of Minneapolis and St. Paul, near the historic Fort Snelling. The valley is one of several distinct regions of Minnesota. The name Minnesota comes from the Dakota language phrase, &quot;Mnisota Makoce&quot; which is translated to &quot;land where the waters reflect the sky&quot;, as a reference to the many lakes in Minnesota rather than the cloudiness of the actual river. At times, the native variant form &quot;Minisota River&quot; is used. For over a century prior to the organization of the Minnesota Territory in 1849, the name St. Pierre (St. Peter) had been generally applied to the river by French and English explorers and writers. Minnesota River is shown on the 1757 edition of Mitchell Map as &quot;Ouadebameniſsouté [&quot;Watpá Mnísota&quot;] or R. St. Peter&quot;. On June 19, 1852, acting upon a request from the Minnesota territorial legislature, the United States Congress decreed the aboriginal name for the river, Minnesota, to be the river’s official name and ordered all agencies of the federal government to use that name when referencing it.

The valley that the Minnesota River flows in is up to five miles (8 km) wide and 250 feet (80 m) deep. It was carved into the landscape by the massive glacial River Warren between 11,700 and 9,400 years ago at the end of the last ice age in North America. Pierre-Charles Le Sueur was the first European known to have traveled along the river. The Minnesota Territory, and later the state, were named for the river.

==Commercial significance==
The river valley is notable as the origin and center of the canning industry in Minnesota. In 1903 Carson Nesbit Cosgrove, an entrepreneur in Le Sueur, presided at the organizational meeting of the Minnesota Valley Canning Company (later renamed Green Giant). By 1930, the Minnesota River valley had emerged as one of the country&#x27;s largest producers of sweet corn. Green Giant had five canneries in Minnesota in addition to the original facility in Le Sueur. Cosgrove&#x27;s son, Edward, and grandson, Robert also served as heads of the company over the ensuing decades before the company was acquired by General Mills. Several docks for barges exist along the river. Farm grains, including corn, are transported to the ports of Minneapolis and Saint Paul, and then shipped down the Mississippi River.

<text>Timbuktu ( ; ; Koyra Chiini: ; ) is an ancient city in Mali, situated north of the Niger River. It is the capital of the Tombouctou Region, one of the eight administrative regions of Mali, having a population of 32,460 in the 2018 census.

Archaeological evidence suggests prehistoric settlements in the region, predating the city&#x27;s Islamic scholarly and trade prominence in the medieval period. Timbuktu began as a seasonal settlement and became permanent early in the 12th century. After a shift in trading routes, particularly after the visit by Mansa Musa around 1325, Timbuktu flourished, due to its strategic location, from the trade in salt, gold, and ivory. It gradually expanded as an important Islamic city on the Saharan trade route and attracted many scholars and traders before it became part of the Mali Empire early in the 14th century. In the first half of the 15th century, the Tuareg people took control for a short period, until the expanding Songhai Empire absorbed it in 1468.

A Moroccan army defeated the Songhai in 1591 and made Timbuktu their capital. The invaders established a new ruling class, the Arma, who after 1612 became virtually independent of Morocco. In its golden age, the town&#x27;s Islamic scholars and extensive trade network supported an important book trade. Together with the campuses of the Sankoré Madrasah, an Islamic university, this established Timbuktu as a scholarly centre in Africa. Notable historic writers, such as Shabeni and Leo Africanus, wrote about the city. These stories fuelled speculation in Europe, where the city&#x27;s reputation shifted from being rich to mysterious. The city&#x27;s golden age as a major learning and cultural centre of the Mali Empire was followed by a long period of decline. Different tribes governed until the French took over Mali in 1893, in a regime that lasted until the country became the Republic of Mali in 1960.

In recent history, Timbuktu faced threats from extremist groups leading to the destruction of cultural sites; efforts by local and international communities have aimed to preserve its heritage. The city&#x27;s population has declined as a result of the recent issues.

==Toponymy==
Over the centuries, the spelling of Timbuktu has varied a great deal: from &quot;Tenbuch&quot; on the Catalan Atlas (1375), to traveller Antonio Malfante&#x27;s &quot;Thambet&quot;, used in a letter he wrote in 1447 and also adopted by Alvise Cadamosto in his &quot;Voyages of Cadamosto&quot;, to Heinrich Barth&#x27;s &quot;Timbúktu&quot; and &quot;Timbu&#x27;ktu&quot;. French spelling often appears in international reference as &#x27;Tombouctou&#x27;. The German spelling &#x27;Timbuktu&#x27; and its variant &#x27;Timbucktu&#x27; have passed into English and the former has become widely used in recent years. Major English-language works have employed the spelling &#x27;Timbuctoo&#x27;, and this is considered the correct English form by scholars; &#x27;Timbuctou&#x27; and &#x27;Timbuctu&#x27; are sometimes used as well.

The French continue to use the spelling &#x27;Tombouctou&#x27;, as they have for over a century; variants include &#x27;Temboctou&#x27; (used by explorer René Caillié) and &#x27;Tombouktou&#x27;, but they are seldom seen. Variant spellings exist for other places as well, such as Jenne (Djenné) and Segu (Ségou). As well as its spelling, Timbuktu&#x27;s toponymy is still open to discussion. At least four possible origins of the name of Timbuktu have been described:
*Songhay origin: both Leo Africanus and Heinrich Barth believed the name was derived from two Songhay words: Leo Africanus writes the Kingdom of Tombuto was named after a town of the same name, founded in 1213 or 1214 by Mansa Sulayman. The word itself consisted of two parts: &quot;tin&quot; (wall) and &quot;butu&quot; (Wall of Butu). Africanus did not explain the meaning of this &quot;Butu&quot;. Heinrich Barth wrote: &quot;The town was probably so called, because it was built originally in a hollow or cavity in the sand-hills. Tùmbutu means hole or womb in the Songhay language: if it were a Temáshight (Tamashek) word, it would be written Timbuktu. The name is generally interpreted by Europeans as &quot;well&quot; of Buktu (also same word in Persian is bâkhtàr باختر = where the sun sets, West), but &quot;tin&quot; has nothing to do with &quot;well&quot;.&quot;
*Berber origin: Malian historian Sekene Cissoko proposes a different etymology: the Tuareg founders of the city gave it a Berber name, a word composed of two parts: &quot;tin&quot;, the feminine form of &quot;in&quot; (place of) and &quot;bouctou&quot;, a small dune. Hence, Timbuktu would mean &quot;place covered by small dunes&quot;.
*Abd al-Sadi offers a third explanation in his 17th-century &quot;Tarikh al-Sudan&quot;: &quot;The Tuareg made it a depot for their belongings and provisions, and it grew into a crossroads for travelers coming and going. Looking after their belongings was a slave woman of theirs called Timbuktu, which in their language means [the one having a] &#x27;lump&#x27;. The blessed spot where she encamped was named after her.&quot;
*The French Orientalist René Basset forwarded another theory: the name derives from the Zenaga root &quot;b-k-t&quot;, meaning &quot;to be distant&quot; or &quot;hidden&quot;, and the feminine possessive particle &quot;tin&quot;. The meaning &quot;hidden&quot; could point to the city&#x27;s location in a slight hollow.

The validity of these theories depends on the identity of the original founders of the city: as recently as 2000, archaeological research has not found remains dating from the 11th/12th century within the limits of the modern city given the difficulty of excavating through metres of sand that have buried the remains over the past centuries. Without consensus, the etymology of Timbuktu remains unclear.

==Prehistory==
Like other important Medieval West African towns such as Djenné (Jenné-Jeno), Gao, and Dia, Iron Age settlements have been discovered near Timbuktu that predate the traditional foundation date of the town. Although the accumulation of thick layers of sand has thwarted archaeological excavations in the town itself, some of the surrounding landscape is deflating and exposing pottery shards on the surface. A survey of the area by Susan and Roderick McIntosh in 1984 identified several Iron Age sites along the el-Ahmar, an ancient wadi system that passes a few kilometers to the east of the modern town.

An Iron Age tell complex located southeast of the Timbuktu near the Wadi el-Ahmar was excavated between 2008 and 2010 by archaeologists from Yale University and the Mission Culturelle de Tombouctou. The results suggest that the site was first occupied during the 5th century BC, thrived throughout the second half of the 1st millennium AD and eventually collapsed sometime during the late 10th or early 11th-century AD.

==History==

Timbuktu has acquired a reputation in the Western world as an exotic, mysterious place, but the city was once a well known trade center and an academic hotspot of the medieval world. Timbuktu reached its golden period under the Mali Empire in the 13th and 14th centuries. Distinguished Malian Mansa Mūsā brought great fame to the city by recruiting scholars from throughout the Islamic world to travel there, establishing it as a center of learning. The scholars focused not only on Islamic studies, but also history, rhetoric, law, science, and, most notably, medicine. Mansa Mūsā also introduced Timbuktu, and the Mali Empire in general, to the rest of the medieval world through his Hajj, as his time in Mecca would soon inspire Arab travelers to visit North Africa. Europeans, however, would not reach the city until much later, due to the difficult and lengthy journey, thus garnering the city an aura of mystery.

Timbuktu primarily gained its wealth from local gold and salt mining, in addition to the trans-Saharan slave trade. Gold was a highly valued commodity in the Mediterranean region and salt was most popular south of the city, though arguably the biggest asset Timbuktu had was its location. The city is situated nine miles from the Niger River, making for good agricultural land. Its position near the edge of the Sahara Desert made it a hub for trans-Saharan trade routes. Timbuktu also acts as a midpoint between the regions of North, West, and Central Africa. Because of this, Timbuktu developed into a cultural melting pot.

The Mali Empire reached a steady decline in the mid-1400s, giving rise to the Songhai Empire. However, the city of Timbuktu entered a brief period of rule under the Tuaregs before it fell to the Songhai people. Despite major shifts in power, Timbuktu generally flourished until the Moroccans invaded the Songhai Empire in 1590 and began to occupy Timbuktu in 1591, after the Battle of Tondibi. In 1593, many of the city&#x27;s scholars were executed or exiled for disloyalty to the new rulers. This, along with a decline in trade as a result of increased competition from newly available trans-Atlantic sailing routes, caused the city to lose its prominence. In the 1890s Timbuktu was formally incorporated into the French colony of Sudan, remaining under French control until the colony became the independent nation of Mali in 1960.

Today, the population of Timbuktu has substantially decreased since its estimated peak of 100,000 people in the medieval period. The city has suffered from great poverty for several years now, relying on government funding as a means of survival.
=== Siege of Timbuktu ===

On 8 August 2023, Timbuktu was brought under a total blockade by Jama&#x27;at Nasr al-Islam wal Muslimin (JNIM), exacerbating poverty, and leading to food shortages. 33,000 fled the city and its surrounding areas and 1,000 have fled to Mauritania since the start of the siege. The siege began after the withdrawal of MINUSMA, the United Nations mission to Mali during the Mali War.

==Geography==

Timbuktu is located on the southern edge of the Sahara north of the main channel of the River Niger. The town is surrounded by sand dunes and the streets are covered in sand. The port of Kabara is to the south of the town and is connected to an arm of the river by a canal. The canal had become heavily silted but in 2007 it was dredged as part of a Libyan financed project.

The annual flood of the Niger River is a result of the heavy rainfall in the headwaters of the Niger and Bani rivers in Guinea and northern Ivory Coast. The rainfall in these areas peaks in August but the floodwater takes time to pass down the river system and through the Inner Niger Delta. At Koulikoro, downstream from Bamako, the flood peaks in September, while in Timbuktu the flood lasts longer and usually reaches a maximum at the end of December.

The area flooded by the river was once more extensive and in years with high rainfall, floodwater reached the western outskirts of Timbuktu itself. A small navigable creek to the west of the town is shown on the maps published by Heinrich Barth in 1857 and Félix Dubois in 1896. Between 1917 and 1921, during the colonial period, the French used slave labour to dig a narrow canal linking Timbuktu with Kabara. Over the following decades this canal became silted and filled with sand, but in 2007 the canal was re-excavated as part of the dredging project so that now when the River Niger floods, Timbuktu is again connected to Kabara. The Malian government has promised to address problems with the design of the canal as it currently lacks footbridges and the steep, unstable banks make access to the water difficult.

Kabara can function as a port only in December and January when the river is in full flood. When the water levels are lower boats dock at Korioumé, which is linked to Timbuktu by of paved road.

===Climate===
Timbuktu features a hot desert climate (&quot;BWh&quot;) according to the Köppen Climate Classification. The weather is extremely hot and dry throughout much of the year, with most of the city&#x27;s rainfall occurring between June and September due to the influence of the Intertropical Convergence Zone (ITCZ). The degree of diurnal temperature variation is higher in the dry season than the wet season. Average daily maximum temperatures in the hottest months of the year – April, May and June – exceed . Lowest temperatures occur during the mildest months of the year – December, January and February. Average maximum temperatures do not drop below . These winter months are characterized by a dry, dusty trade wind blowing from the Saharan Tibesti Region southward to the Gulf of Guinea. Picking up dust particles on their way, these winds limit visibility in what has been dubbed the &quot;Harmattan Haze.&quot; Additionally, when the dust settles in the city, sand builds up and desertification looms.

==Economy==
===Salt trade===

The wealth and very existence of Timbuktu depended on its position as the southern terminus of an important trans-Saharan trade route; nowadays, the only goods that are routinely transported across the desert are slabs of rock salt brought from the Taoudenni mining centre in the central Sahara north of Timbuktu. Until the second half of the 20th century most of the slabs were transported by large salt caravans or azalai, one leaving Timbuktu in early November and the other in late March.

The caravans of several thousand camels took three weeks each way, transporting food to the miners and returning with each camel loaded with four or five slabs of salt. The salt transport was largely controlled by desert nomads of the Arabic-speaking Berabich (or Barabish) tribe. Although there are no roads, the slabs of salt are now usually transported from Taoudenni by truck. From Timbuktu the salt is transported by boat to other towns in Mali.

Between the 12th and 14th centuries, Timbuktu&#x27;s population grew immensely due to an influx of Bono, Tuaregs, Fulanis, and Songhais seeking trade, security, or to study. By 1300, the population increased to 10,000 and continued increasing until it reached about 50,000 in the 1500s.

===Agriculture===

There is insufficient rainfall in the Timbuktu region for purely rain-fed agriculture and crops are therefore irrigated using water from the River Niger. The main agricultural crop is rice. African floating rice (&quot;Oryza glaberrima&quot;) has traditionally been grown in regions near the river that are inundated during the annual flood. Seed is sown at the beginning of the rainy season (June–July) so that when the flood water arrives plants are already in height.

The plants grow up to in height as the water level rises. The rice is harvested by canoe in December. The procedure is very precarious and the yields are low but the method has the advantage that little capital investment is required. A successful crop depends critically on the amount and timing of the rain in the wet season and the height of the flood. To a limited extent the arrival of the flood water can be controlled by the construction of small mud dikes that become submerged as the water rises.

Although floating rice is still cultivated in the Timbuktu Cercle, most of the rice is now grown in three relatively large irrigated areas that lie to the south of the town: Daye (392 ha), Koriomé (550 ha) and Hamadja (623 ha). Water is pumped from the river using ten large Archimedes&#x27; screws which were first installed in the 1990s. The irrigated areas are run as cooperatives with approximately 2,100 families cultivating small plots. Nearly all the rice produced is consumed by the families themselves. The yields are still relatively low and the farmers are being encouraged to change their agricultural practices.

===Tourism===
Most tourists visit Timbuktu between November and February when the air temperature is lower. In the 1980s, accommodation for tourists was provided by Hendrina Khan Hotel and two other small hotels: Hotel Bouctou and Hotel Azalaï. Over the following decades the tourist numbers increased so that by 2006 there were seven small hotels and guest houses. The town benefited by the revenue from the CFA 5000 tourist tax, the sale of handicrafts and employment of local guides.

====Attacks====
Starting in 2008, al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb began kidnapping groups of tourists in the Sahel region. In January 2009, four tourists were kidnapped near the Mali–Niger border after attending a cultural festival at Anderamboukané. One of these tourists was subsequently murdered. As a result of this and various other incidents a number of states including France, Britain and the US, began advising their citizens to avoid travelling far from Bamako. The number of tourists visiting Timbuktu dropped precipitously from around 6000 in 2009 to only 492 in the first four months of 2011.

Because of the security concerns, the Malian government moved the 2010 Festival in the Desert from Essakane to the outskirts of Timbuktu. In November 2011, gunmen attacked tourists staying at a hotel in Timbuktu, killing one of them and kidnapping three others. This was the first terrorist incident in Timbuktu itself.

On 1 April 2012, one day after the capture of Gao, Timbuktu was captured from the Malian military by the Tuareg rebels of the MNLA and Ansar Dine. Five days later, the MNLA declared the region independent of Mali as the nation of Azawad. The declared political entity was not recognized by any regional nations or the international community and it collapsed three months later on 12 July.

On 28 January 2013, French and Malian government troops began retaking Timbuktu from the Islamist rebels. The force of 1,000 French troops with 200 Malian soldiers retook Timbuktu without a fight. The Islamist groups had already fled north a few days earlier, having set fire to the Ahmed Baba Institute, which housed many important manuscripts. The building housing the Ahmed Baba Institute was funded by South Africa, and held 30,000 manuscripts. BBC World Service radio news reported on 29 January 2013 that approximately 28,000 of the manuscripts in the Institute had been removed to safety from the premises before the attack by the Islamist groups, and that the whereabouts of about 2,000 manuscripts remained unknown. It was intended to be a resource for Islamic research.

On 30 March 2013, jihadist rebels infiltrated Timbuktu nine days before a suicide bombing on a Malian army checkpoint at the international airport, killing a soldier. Fighting lasted until 1 April, when French warplanes helped Malian ground forces chase the remaining rebels out of the city center.

==Early accounts in the West==
Tales of Timbuktu&#x27;s fabulous wealth helped prompt European exploration of the west coast of Africa. Among the most famous descriptions of Timbuktu are those of Leo Africanus and Shabeni.

===Leo Africanus===

Perhaps most famous among the accounts written about Timbuktu is that by Leo Africanus, born El Hasan ben Muhammed el- Wazzan-ez-Zayyati in Granada in 1485. His family was among the thousands of Muslims expelled by King Ferdinand and Queen Isabel after their reconquest of Spain in 1492. They settled in Morocco, where he studied in Fes and accompanied his uncle on diplomatic missions throughout North Africa. During these travels, he visited Timbuktu. As a young man he was captured by pirates and presented as an exceptionally learned slave to Pope Leo X, who freed him, baptized him under the name &quot;Johannis Leo de Medici&quot;, and commissioned him to write, in Italian, a detailed survey of Africa. His accounts provided most of what Europeans knew about the continent for the next several centuries. Describing Timbuktu when the Songhai Empire was at its height, the English edition of his book includes the description:
According to Leo Africanus, there were abundant supplies of locally produced grain, cattle, milk and butter, though there were neither gardens nor orchards surrounding the city. In another passage dedicated to describing the wealth of both the environment and the king, Africanus touches upon the rarity of one of Timbuktu&#x27;s trade commodities: salt.
These descriptions and passages alike caught the attention of European explorers. Africanus also described the more mundane aspects of the city, such as the &quot;cottages built of chalk, and covered with thatch&quot; – although these went largely unheeded.

===Shabeni===

Roughly 250 years after Leo Africanus&#x27; visit to Timbuktu, the city had seen many rulers. The end of the 18th century saw the grip of the Moroccan rulers on the city wane, resulting in a period of unstable government by quickly changing tribes. During the rule of one of those tribes, the Hausa, a 14-year-old child named Shabeni (or Shabeeny) from Tetuan on the north coast of Morocco accompanied his father on a visit to Timbuktu.

Shabeni stayed in Timbuktu for three years before moving to a major city called Housa several days&#x27; journey to the southeast. Two years later, he returned to Timbuktu to live there for another seven years – one of a population that was, even centuries after its peak and excluding slaves, double the size of the 21st-century town.

By the time Shabeni was 27, he was an established merchant in his hometown of Tetuan. He made a two-year pilgrimage to Mecca and thus became a hajji, Asseed El Hage Abd Salam Shabeeny. Returning from a trading voyage to Hamburg, he was captured by a ship manned by Englishmen but sailing under a Russian flag, whose captain claimed that his Imperial mistress (Catherine the Great) was &quot;at war with all Muselmen&quot; (see Russo-Turkish War (1787–1792)). He and the ship he had been sailing in were brought to Ostend in Belgium in December 1789 but the British consul managed to get him and the ship released. He set off again in the same ship, but the captain, who claimed to be afraid of his ship being captured again, set him ashore in Dover. In England his story was recorded. Shabeeni gave an indication of the size of the city in the second half of the 18th century. In an earlier passage, he described an environment that was characterized by forest, as opposed to the modern arid surroundings.

==Arts and culture==
=== The mosques ===
Situated on the northern edge of the Niger Delta, Timbuktu is at the crossroads of the Saharan trade routes and the River Niger. Founded in 1100 by the Tuareg, this cultural centre boasts significant architectural landmarks, including three great mosques: Djinguere Ber, Sankore and Sidi Yahya.

The Djinguere Ber Mosque, built in 1328 under the patronage of Mansa Musa, the wealthy ruler of the Mali Empire, served as a testament to the city&#x27;s prosperity during this golden age. Mansa Musa&#x27;s legendary pilgrimage to Mecca, during which he distributed vast amounts of gold, contributed to the construction of the mosque and cemented Timbuktu&#x27;s reputation as a centre of Islamic culture and learning. Over the centuries, the Djinguere Ber mosque has undergone various renovations and extensions, reflecting the changing architectural styles and religious practices of the region.

The Sankore Mosque, built between 1325 and 1463, played a central role in Timbuktu&#x27;s intellectual and educational landscape. As the city flourished as a centre of Islamic learning, the Sankore Mosque became a renowned centre of learning, attracting scholars and students from across the Muslim world. Its libraries housed thousands of manuscripts on subjects ranging from theology to astronomy, contributing to Timbuktu&#x27;s reputation as a centre of intellectual exchange and cultural diversity.

The Sidi Yahya mosque, founded in 1440 by the revered marabout Sheikh al-Mukhtar Hamallah, held both religious and mystical significance for the people of Timbuktu. According to local legend, the mosque awaited the arrival of Sidi Yahya al-Tadlissi, a saint whose presence would sanctify the site. When Sidi Yahya claimed the mosque forty years later, it became a focal point for spiritual devotion and pilgrimage. Over time, the mosque underwent several renovations and refurbishments, reflecting the changing religious and cultural landscape of Timbuktu.

===Cultural events===
The best-known cultural event is the Festival au Désert. When the Tuareg rebellion ended in 1996 under the Konaré administration, 3,000 weapons were burned in a ceremony dubbed the Flame of Peace on 29 March 2007 – to commemorate the ceremony, a monument was built. The Festival au Désert, to celebrate the peace treaty, was held every January in the desert, 75 km from the city until 2010.

The week-long festival of Mawloud is held every January, and celebrates the birthday of Muhammed; the city&#x27;s &quot;most cherished manuscripts&quot; are read publicly, and are a central part of this celebration. It was originally a Shi&#x27;ite festival from Persia and arriving in Timbuktu around 1600. The &quot;most joyful occasion on Timbuktu&#x27;s calendar&quot;, it combines &quot;rituals of Sufi Islam with celebrating Timbuktu&#x27;s rich literary traditions&quot;. It is a &quot;period of feasting, singing, and dancing ... It culminated with an evening gathering of thousands of people in the large sandy square in front of the Sankor é Mosque and a public reading of some of the city&#x27;s most treasured manuscripts.&quot;

Annually, during the winter, Timbuktu has hosted the Living Together festival since 2015.

===World Heritage Site===

During its twelfth session, in December 1988, the World Heritage Committee (WHC) selected parts of Timbuktu&#x27;s historic centre for inscription on its World Heritage list. The selection was based on three criteria:
*Criterion II: Timbuktu&#x27;s holy places were vital to early Islamization in Africa.
*Criterion IV: Timbuktu&#x27;s mosques show a cultural and scholarly Golden Age during the Songhai Empire.
*Criterion V: The construction of the mosques, still mostly original, shows the use of traditional building techniques.

An earlier nomination in 1979 failed the following year as it lacked proper demarcation: the Malian government included the town of Timbuktu as a whole in the wish for inclusion. Close to a decade later, three mosques and 16 mausoleums or cemeteries were selected from the Old Town for World Heritage status: with this conclusion came the call for protection of the buildings&#x27; conditions, an exclusion of new construction works near the sites and measures against the encroaching sand.

Shortly afterwards, the monuments were placed on the List of World Heritage in Danger by the Malian government, as by the selection committee at the time of nomination. The first period on the Danger List lasted from 1990 until 2005, when a range of measures including restoration work and the compilation of an inventory warranted &quot;its removal from the Danger List&quot;. In 2008 the WHC placed the protected area under increased scrutiny dubbed &quot;reinforced monitoring&quot;, a measure made possible in 2007, as the impact of planned construction work was unclear. Special attention was given to the build of a cultural centre.

During a session in June 2009, UNESCO decided to cease its increased monitoring program as it felt sufficient progress had been made to address the initial concerns. Following the takeover of Timbuktu by MNLA and the Islamist group Ansar Dine, it was returned to the List of World Heritage in Danger in 2012.

Many of the current conservation efforts are undertaken by &quot;traditional actors&quot; in the community. Some of their efforts include managing and restoring the historic mosques in the city.

====Attacks by radical Islamic groups====

In May 2012, Ansar Dine destroyed a shrine in the city and in June 2012, in the aftermath of the Battle of Gao and Timbuktu, other shrines, including the mausoleum of Sidi Mahmoud, were destroyed when attacked with shovels and pickaxes by members of the same group. An Ansar Dine spokesman said that all shrines in the city, including the 13 remaining World Heritage sites, would be destroyed because they consider them to be examples of idolatry, a sin in Islam. These acts have been described as crimes against humanity and war crimes. After the destruction of the tombs, UNESCO created a special fund to safeguard Mali&#x27;s World Heritage Sites, vowing to carry out reconstruction and rehabilitation projects once the security situation allows.

==Education==
===Centre of learning===

Timbuktu was a world centre of Islamic learning from the 13th to the 17th century, especially under the Mali Empire and Askia Mohammad I&#x27;s rule. The Malian government and NGOs have been working to catalogue and restore the remnants of this scholarly legacy: Timbuktu&#x27;s manuscripts.

Timbuktu&#x27;s rapid economic growth in the 13th and 14th centuries drew many scholars from nearby Walata (today in Mauritania), leading up to the city&#x27;s golden age in the 15th and 16th centuries that proved fertile ground for scholarship of religions, arts and sciences. To the people of Timbuktu, literacy and books were symbols of wealth, power, and blessings and the acquisition of books became a primary concern for scholars. An active trade in books between Timbuktu and other parts of the Islamic world and emperor Askia Mohammed&#x27;s strong support led to the writing of thousands of manuscripts.

Knowledge was gathered in a manner similar to the early, informal European Medieval university model. Lecturing was presented through a range of informal institutions called madrasahs. Nowadays known as the University of Timbuktu, three &quot;madrasahs&quot; facilitated 25,000 students: Djinguereber, Sidi Yahya and Sankore.

These institutions were explicitly religious, as opposed to the more secular curricula of modern European universities and more similar to the medieval Europe model. However, where universities in the European sense started as associations of students and teachers, West-African education was patronized by families or lineages, with the Aqit and Bunu al-Qadi al-Hajj families being two of the most prominent in Timbuktu – these families also facilitated students in set-aside rooms in their housings. Although the basis of Islamic law and its teaching were brought to Timbuktu from North Africa with the spread of Islam, Western African scholarship developed: Ahmad Baba al Massufi is regarded as the city&#x27;s greatest scholar.

Timbuktu served in this process as a distribution centre of scholars and scholarship. Its reliance on trade meant intensive movement of scholars between the city and its extensive network of trade partners. In 1468–1469 though, many scholars left for Walata when Sunni Ali&#x27;s Songhay Empire absorbed Timbuktu. Then, in the 1591 Moroccan invasion of Timbuktu, scholars had to flee once more, or face imprisonment or murder.

This system of education survived until the late 19th century, while the 18th century saw the institution of itinerant Quranic school as a form of universal education, where scholars would travel throughout the region with their students, begging for food part of the day.
Islamic education came under pressure after the French occupation, droughts in the 1970s and 1980s and by Mali&#x27;s civil war in the early 1990s.

===Manuscripts and libraries===
Hundreds of thousands of manuscripts were collected in Timbuktu over the course of centuries: some were written in the town itself, others – including exclusive copies of the Quran for wealthy families – imported through the lively booktrade. Hidden in cellars or buried, hid between the mosque&#x27;s mud walls and safeguarded by their patrons, many of these manuscripts survived the city&#x27;s decline. They now form the collection of several libraries in Timbuktu, holding up to 700,000 manuscripts in 2003. They include the Ahmed Baba Institute, Mamma Haidara Library, Fondo Kati, Al-Wangari Library, Mohamed Tahar Library, Maigala Library, Boularaf Collection, and Al Kounti Collections. These libraries are the largest among up to 60 private or public libraries that are estimated to exist in Timbuktu today, although some comprise little more than a row of books on a shelf or a bookchest. Under these circumstances, the manuscripts are vulnerable to damage and theft, as well as long term climate damage, despite Timbuktu&#x27;s arid climate. Two Timbuktu Manuscripts Projects funded by independent universities have aimed to preserve them.

In late January 2013 it was reported that rebel forces destroyed many of the manuscripts before leaving the city. &quot;On Friday morning, 25 January 2013, fifteen jihadis entered the restoration and conservation rooms on the ground floor of the Ahmed Baba Institute in Sankoré ... The men swept 4,202 manuscripts off lab tables and shelves, and carried them into the tiled courtyard ... They doused the manuscripts in gasoline ... and tossed in a lit match. The brittle pages and their dry leather covers ... were consumed by the inferno.&quot; However, there was no malicious destruction of any library or collection as most of the manuscripts were safely hidden away. 90% of these manuscripts were saved by the librarian Adbel Kader Haidara and the population organized around the NGO &quot;Sauvegarde et valorisation des manuscrits pour la défense de la culture islamique&quot; (SAVAMA-DCI). Some 350,000 manuscripts were transported to safety, and 300,000 of them were still in Bamako in 2022.

During the occupation by Islamic extremists, the city&#x27;s citizens embarked on a drive to save the &quot;best written accounts of African History&quot;. Interviewed by &quot;Time&quot; magazine, the local residents claimed to have safeguarded the three hundred thousand manuscripts for generations. Many of these documents are still in the safe-keeping of the local residents, who are reluctant to give them over to the government-run Ahmed Baba Institute housed in a modern digitalization building built by the South African government in 2009. The institute houses only 10% of the manuscripts. It was later confirmed by Jean-Michel Djian to &quot;The New Yorker&quot; that &quot;the great majority of the manuscripts, about fifty thousand, are actually housed in the thirty-two family libraries of the &#x27;City of 333 Saints. He added, &quot;Those are to this day protected.&quot; He also added that due to the massive efforts of one individual, two hundred thousand other manuscripts were successfully transported to safety. This effort was organized by Abdel Kader Haidara, then director of Mamma Haidara Library, using his own funds. Haidara purchased metal footlockers in which up to 300 manuscripts could be securely stored. Nearly 2,500 of these lockers were distributed to safe houses across the city. Many were later moved to Dreazen.

==Language==
Although Bambara is the lingua franca of Mali, today the large majority of Timbuktu&#x27;s inhabitants speaks Koyra Chiini, a Songhay language that also functions as the lingua franca. Before the 1990–1994 Tuareg rebellion, both Hassaniya Arabic and Tamashek were represented by 10% each to an 80% dominance of the Koyra Chiini language. With Tamashek spoken by both Ikelan and ethnic Tuaregs, its use declined with the expulsion of many Tuaregs following the rebellion, increasing the dominance of Koyra Chiini. 

Arabic, introduced together with Islam during the 11th century, has mainly been the language of scholars and religion, comparable to Latin in Western Christianity. Although Bambara is spoken by the most numerous ethnic group in Mali, the Bambara people, it is mainly confined to the south of the country. With an improving infrastructure granting Timbuktu access to larger cities in Mali&#x27;s South, use of Bambara was increasing in the city at least until Azawad independence.

==Infrastructure==

With no railroads in Mali except for the Dakar-Niger Railway up to Koulikoro, access to Timbuktu is by road, boat or, since 1961, aircraft. With high water levels in the Niger from August to December, Compagnie Malienne de Navigation (COMANAV) passenger ferries operate a leg between Koulikoro and downstream Gao on a roughly weekly basis. Also requiring high water are &quot;pinasses&quot; (large motorized pirogues), either chartered or public, that travel up and down the river.

Both ferries and &quot;pinasses&quot; arrive at Korioumé, Timbuktu&#x27;s port, which is linked to the city centre by an paved road running through Kabara. In 2007, access to Timbuktu&#x27;s traditional port, Kabara, was restored by a Libyan funded project that dredged the silted canal connecting Kabara to an arm of the Niger River. COMANAV ferries and &quot;pinasses&quot; are now able to reach the port when the river is in full flood.

Timbuktu is poorly connected to the Malian road network with only dirt roads to the neighbouring towns. Although the Niger River can be crossed by ferry at Korioumé, the roads south of the river are no better. However, a new paved road is under construction between Niono and Timbuktu running to the north of the Inland Niger Delta. The road will pass through Nampala, Léré, Niafunké, Tonka, Diré and Goundam. The completed section between Niono and the small village of Goma Coura was financed by the Millennium Challenge Corporation. This new section will service the Alatona irrigation system development of the Office du Niger. The section between Goma Coura and Timbuktu is being financed by the European Development Fund.

Timbuktu Airport was served by Air Mali, hosting flights to and from Bamako, Gao and Mopti. until the airline suspended operations in 2014. Its 6,923 ft (2,110 m) runway in a 07/25 runway orientation is both lighted and paved.

Currently (July 2023), Timbuktu Airport is served by Sky Mali to and from Bamako, using Boeing 737 aircraft.

==In popular culture==
Because much of the gold imported to Europe in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries came from Timbuktu, the city has long been considered a mysterious, hidden place. This association remains with modern Europeans and North Americans: a 2006 survey of 150 young Britons found that 34% did not believe the town existed, while the other 66% considered it &quot;a mythical place&quot;. This perception has been acknowledged in literature describing African history and African-European relations. In popular Western culture, Timbuktu is also often considered an idiomatic stand-in for any faraway place.

The origin of this mystification lies in the excitement brought to Europe by the legendary tales, especially those by Leo Africanus in his &quot;Description of Africa&quot;. Arabic sources focused mainly on more affluent cities in the Timbuktu region, such as Gao and Walata. In West Africa, the city holds an image that has been compared to Europe&#x27;s view on Athens. As such, the picture of the city as the epitome of distance and mystery is a European one.

Stories of great riches served as a catalyst for travellers to visit the inaccessible city, with prominent French explorer René Caillié characterising Timbuktu as &quot;a mass of ill-looking houses built of earth&quot;. This development shifted the city&#x27;s reputation, from being fabled because of its gold to fabled because of its location and mystery. Being used in this sense since at least 1863, English dictionaries now cite Timbuktu as a metaphor for any faraway place.

Timbuktu plays a vital role in Dorothy Dunnett&#x27;s House of Niccolo series of historical novels, as a physical setting in &quot;Scales of Gold&quot;, and as a spiritual and intellectual influence throughout, through the character of Umar, a man from that city enslaved in Europe under the name Loppe, and his friendship with Nicholas, the central character of the series.

The musical &quot;Timbuktu!&quot; premiered on Broadway on March 1, 1978. With lyrics by George Forrest and Robert Wright, set to music by Borodin, Forrest and Wright and a book by Luther Davis, it is a retelling of Forrest and Wright&#x27;s musical &quot;Kismet&quot;, changing the setting to mid-14th century Timbuktu. It starred Eartha Kitt, William Marshall, Gilbert Price, Melba Moore and George Bell. Geoffrey Holder was director, choreographer and costume designer.

<text>A mast cell (also known as a mastocyte or a labrocyte) is a resident cell of connective tissue that contains many granules rich in histamine and heparin. Specifically, it is a type of granulocyte derived from the myeloid stem cell that is a part of the immune and neuroimmune systems. Mast cells were discovered by Friedrich von Recklinghausen and later rediscovered by Paul Ehrlich in 1877. Although best known for their role in allergy and anaphylaxis, mast cells play an important protective role as well, being intimately involved in wound healing, angiogenesis, immune tolerance, defense against pathogens, and vascular permeability in brain tumors.

The mast cell is very similar in both appearance and function to the basophil, another type of white blood cell. Although mast cells were once thought to be tissue-resident basophils, it has been shown that the two cells develop from different hematopoietic lineages and thus cannot be the same cells.

==Structure==

Mast cells are very similar to basophil granulocytes (a class of white blood cells) in blood, in the sense that both are granulated cells that contain histamine and heparin, an anticoagulant. Their nuclei differ in that the basophil nucleus is lobated while the mast cell nucleus is round. The Fc region of immunoglobulin E (IgE) becomes bound to mast cells and basophils, and when IgE&#x27;s paratopes bind to an antigen, it causes the cells to release histamine and other inflammatory mediators. These similarities have led many to speculate that mast cells are basophils that have &quot;homed in&quot; on tissues. Furthermore, they share a common precursor in bone marrow expressing the CD34 molecule. Basophils leave the bone marrow already mature, whereas the mast cell circulates in an immature form, only maturing once in a tissue site. The site an immature mast cell settles in probably determines its precise characteristics. The first &quot;in vitro&quot; differentiation and growth of a pure population of mouse mast cells was carried out using conditioned medium derived from concanavalin A-stimulated splenocytes. Later, it was discovered that T cell-derived interleukin 3 was the component present in the conditioned media that was required for mast cell differentiation and growth.

Mast cells in rodents are classically divided into two subtypes: connective tissue-type mast cells and mucosal mast cells. The activities of the latter are dependent on T-cells.

Mast cells are present in most tissues characteristically surrounding blood vessels, nerves and lymphatic vessels, and are especially prominent near the boundaries between the outside world and the internal milieu, such as the skin, mucosa of the lungs, and digestive tract, as well as the mouth, conjunctiva, and nose.

==Function==

Mast cells play a key role in the inflammatory process. When activated, a mast cell can either selectively release (piecemeal degranulation) or rapidly release (anaphylactic degranulation) &quot;mediators&quot;, or compounds that induce inflammation, from storage granules into the local microenvironment. Mast cells can be stimulated to degranulate by allergens through cross-linking with immunoglobulin E receptors (e.g., FcεRI), physical injury through pattern recognition receptors for damage-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs), microbial pathogens through pattern recognition receptors for pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs), and various compounds through their associated G-protein coupled receptors (e.g., morphine through opioid receptors) or ligand-gated ion channels. Complement proteins can activate membrane receptors on mast cells to exert various functions as well.

Mast cells express a high-affinity receptor (FcεRI) for the Fc region of IgE, the least-abundant member of the antibodies. This receptor is of such high affinity that binding of IgE molecules is in essence irreversible. As a result, mast cells are coated with IgE, which is produced by plasma cells (the antibody-producing cells of the immune system). IgE antibodies are typically specific to one particular antigen.

In allergic reactions, mast cells remain inactive until an allergen binds to IgE already coated upon the cell. Other membrane activation events can either prime mast cells for subsequent degranulation or act in synergy with FcεRI signal transduction. In general, allergens are proteins or polysaccharides. The allergen binds to the antigen-binding sites, which are situated on the variable regions of the IgE molecules bound to the mast cell surface. It appears that binding of two or more IgE molecules (cross-linking) is required to activate the mast cell. The clustering of the intracellular domains of the cell-bound Fc receptors, which are associated with the cross-linked IgE molecules, causes a complex sequence of reactions inside the mast cell that lead to its activation. Although this reaction is most well understood in terms of allergy, it appears to have evolved as a defense system against parasites and bacteria.

Mast cells (MCs) have been shown to release their nuclear DNA and subsequently form mast cell extracellular traps (MCETs) comparable to neutrophil extracellular traps, which are able to entrap and kill various microbes.

===Mast cell mediators===

A unique, stimulus-specific set of mast cell mediators is released through degranulation following the activation of cell surface receptors on mast cells. Examples of mediators that are released into the extracellular environment during mast cell degranulation include:
* serine proteases, such as tryptase and chymase
* histamine (2–5 picograms per mast cell)
* serotonin
* proteoglycans, mainly heparin (active as anticoagulant) and some chondroitin sulfate proteoglycans
* adenosine triphosphate (ATP)
* lysosomal enzymes
** β-hexosaminidase
** β-glucuronidase
** arylsulfatases
* newly formed lipid mediators (eicosanoids):
** thromboxane
** prostaglandin D2
** leukotriene C4
** platelet-activating factor
* cytokines
** TNF-α
** basic fibroblast growth factor
** interleukin-4
** stem cell factor
** chemokines, such as eosinophil chemotactic factor
* reactive oxygen species
Histamine dilates post-capillary venules, activates the endothelium, and increases blood vessel permeability. This leads to local edema (swelling), warmth, redness, and the attraction of other inflammatory cells to the site of release. It also depolarizes nerve endings (leading to itching or pain). Cutaneous signs of histamine release are the &quot;flare and wheal&quot;-reaction. The bump and redness immediately following a mosquito bite are a good example of this reaction, which occurs seconds after challenge of the mast cell by an allergen.

The other physiologic activities of mast cells are much less-understood. Several lines of evidence suggest that mast cells may have a fairly fundamental role in innate immunity: They are capable of elaborating a vast array of important cytokines and other inflammatory mediators such as TNF-α; they express multiple &quot;pattern recognition receptors&quot; thought to be involved in recognizing broad classes of pathogens; and mice without mast cells seem to be much more susceptible to a variety of infections.

Mast cell granules carry a variety of bioactive chemicals. These granules have been found to be transferred to adjacent cells of the immune system and neurons in a process of transgranulation via mast cell pseudopodia.

===In the nervous system===
Unlike other hematopoietic cells of the immune system, mast cells naturally occur in the human brain where they interact with the neuroimmune system. In the brain, mast cells are located in a number of structures that mediate visceral sensory (e.g. pain) or neuroendocrine functions or that are located along the blood–cerebrospinal fluid barrier, including the pituitary stalk, pineal gland, thalamus, and hypothalamus, area postrema, choroid plexus, and in the dural layer of the meninges near meningeal nociceptors. Mast cells serve the same general functions in the body and central nervous system, such as effecting or regulating allergic responses, innate and adaptive immunity, autoimmunity, and inflammation. Across systems, mast cells serve as the main effector cell through which pathogens can affect the gut–brain axis.

===In the gut===
In the gastrointestinal tract, mucosal mast cells are located in close proximity to sensory nerve fibres, which communicate bidirectionally. When these mast cells initially degranulate, they release mediators (e.g., histamine, tryptase, and serotonin) which activate, sensitize, and upregulate membrane expression of nociceptors (i.e., TRPV1) on visceral afferent neurons via their receptors (respectively, HRH1, HRH2, HRH3, PAR2, 5-HT3); in turn, neurogenic inflammation, visceral hypersensitivity, and intestinal dysmotility (i.e., impaired peristalsis) result. Neuronal activation induces neuropeptide (substance P and calcitonin gene-related peptide) signaling to mast cells where they bind to their associated receptors and trigger degranulation of a distinct set of mediators (β-Hexosaminidase, cytokines, chemokines, PGD2, leukotrienes, and eoxins).

==Physiology==
===Structure of the high-affinity IgE receptor, FcεR1===
FcεR1 is a high affinity IgE-receptor that is expressed on the surface of the mast cell. FcεR1 is a tetramer made of one alpha (α) chain, one beta (β) chain, and two identical, disulfide-linked gamma (γ) chains. The binding site for IgE is formed by the extracellular portion of the α chain that contains two domains that are similar to Ig. One transmembrane domain contains an aspartic acid residue, and one contains a short cytoplasmic tail. The β chain contains, a single immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motif ITAM, in the cytoplasmic region. Each γ chain has one ITAM on the cytoplasmic region. The signaling cascade from the receptor is initiated when the ITAMs of the β and γ chains are phosphorylated by a tyrosine kinase. This signal is required for the activation of mast cells. Type 2 helper T cells,(Th2) and many other cell types lack the β chain, so signaling is mediated only by the γ chain. This is due to the α chain containing endoplasmic reticulum retention signals that causes the α-chains to remain degraded in the ER. The assembly of the α chain with the co-transfected β and γ chains mask the ER retention and allows the α β γ complex to be exported to the golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane in rats. In humans, only the γ complex is needed to counterbalance the α chain ER retention.

===Allergen process===
Allergen-mediated FcεR1 cross-linking signals are very similar to the signaling event resulting in antigen binding to lymphocytes. The Lyn tyrosine kinase is associated with the cytoplasmic end of the FcεR1 β chain. The antigen cross-links the FcεR1 molecules, and Lyn tyrosine kinase phosphorylates the ITAMs in the FcεR1 β and γ chain in the cytoplasm. Upon the phosphorylation, the Syk tyrosine kinase gets recruited to the ITAMs located on the γ chains. This causes activation of the Syk tyrosine kinase, causing it to phosphorylate. Syk functions as a signal amplifying kinase activity due to the fact that it targets multiple proteins and causes their activation. This antigen stimulated phosphorylation causes the activation of other proteins in the FcεR1-mediated signaling cascade.

===Degranulation and fusion===
An important adaptor protein activated by the Syk phosphorylation step is the linker for activation of T cells (LAT). LAT can be modified by phosphorylation to create novel binding sites. Phospholipase C gamma (PLCγ) becomes phosphorylated once bound to LAT, and is then used to catalyze phosphatidylinositol bisphosphate breakdown to yield inositol trisphosphate (IP3) and diacyglycerol (DAG). IP3 elevates calcium levels, and DAG activates protein kinase C (PKC). This is not the only way that PKC is made. The tyrosine kinase FYN phosphorylates Grb2-associated-binding protein 2 (Gab2), which binds to phosphoinositide 3-kinase, which activates PKC. PKC leads to the activation of myosin light-chain phosphorylation granule movements, which disassembles the actin–myosin complexes to allow granules to come into contact with the plasma membrane. The mast cell granule can now fuse with the plasma membrane. Soluble N-ethylmaleimide sensitive fusion attachment protein receptor SNARE complex mediates this process. Different SNARE proteins interact to form different complexes that catalyze fusion. Rab3 guanosine triphosphatases and Rab-associated kinases and phosphatases regulate granule membrane fusion in resting mast cells.

===MRGPRX2 mast cell receptor===

Human mast-cell-specific G-protein-coupled receptor MRGPRX2 plays a key role in the recognition of pathogen associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) and initiating an antibacterial response. MRGPRX2 is able to bind to competence stimulating peptide (CSP) 1 - a quorum sensing molecule (QSM) produced by Gram-positive bacteria. This leads to signal transduction to a G protein and activation of the mast cell. Mast cell activation induces the release of antibacterial mediators including ROS, TNF-α and PRGD2 which institute the recruitment of other immune cells to inhibit bacterial growth and biofilm formation.

The MRGPRX2 receptor is a possible therapeutic target and can be pharmacologically activated using the agonist compound 48/80 to control bacterial infection. It is also hypothesised that other QSMs and even Gram-negative bacterial signals can activate this receptor. This might particularly be the case during Bartonella chronic infections where it appears clearly in human symptomatology that these patients all have a mast cell activation syndrome due to the presence of a not yet defined quorum sensing molecule (basal histamine itself?). Those patients are prone to food intolerance driven by another less specific path than the IgE receptor path: certainly the MRGPRX2 route. These patients also show cyclical skin pathergy and dermographism, every time the bacteria exits its hidden intracellular location.

===Enzymes===
==Clinical significance==

===Parasitic infections===

Mast cells are activated in response to infection by pathogenic parasites, such as certain helminths and protozoa, through IgE signaling. Various species known to be affected include &quot;T.spiralis&quot;, &quot;S.ratti&quot;, and &quot;S.venezuelensis&quot;. This is accomplished via Type 2 cell-mediated effector immunity, which is characterized by signaling from IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13. It is the same immune response that is responsible for allergic inflammation more generally, and includes effectors beyond mast cells. In this response, mast cells are known to release significant quantities of IL-4 and IL-13 along with mast cell chymase 1 (CMA1), which is considered to help expel some worms by increasing vascular permeability.

===Mast cell activation disorders ===

Mast cell activation disorders (MCAD) are a spectrum of immune disorders that are unrelated to pathogenic infection and involve similar symptoms that arise from secreted mast cell intermediates, but differ slightly in their pathophysiology, treatment approach, and distinguishing symptoms. The classification of mast cell activation disorders was laid out in 2010.

====Allergic disease====

Allergies are mediated through IgE signaling which triggers mast cell degranulation. Recently, IgE-independent &quot;pseudo-allergic&quot; reactions are thought to also be mediated via the MRGPRX2 receptor activation of mast cells (e.g. drugs such as muscle relaxants, opioids, Icatibant and fluoroquinolones).

Many forms of cutaneous and mucosal allergy are mediated in large part by mast cells; they play a central role in asthma, eczema, itch (from various causes), allergic rhinitis and allergic conjunctivitis. Antihistamine drugs act by blocking histamine action on nerve endings. Cromoglicate-based drugs (sodium cromoglicate, nedocromil) block a calcium channel essential for mast cell degranulation, stabilizing the cell and preventing release of histamine and related mediators. Leukotriene antagonists (such as montelukast and zafirlukast) block the action of leukotriene mediators and are being used increasingly in allergic diseases.

Calcium triggers the secretion of histamine from mast cells after previous exposure to sodium fluoride. The secretory process can be divided into a fluoride-activation step and a calcium-induced secretory step. It was observed that the fluoride-activation step is accompanied by an elevation of cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP) levels within the cells. The attained high levels of cAMP persist during histamine release. It was further found that catecholamines do not markedly alter the fluoride-induced histamine release. It was also confirmed that the second, but not the first, step in sodium fluoride-induced histamine secretion is inhibited by theophylline. Vasodilation and increased permeability of capillaries are a result of both H1 and H2 receptor types.

Stimulation of histamine activates a histamine (H2)-sensitive adenylate cyclase of oxyntic cells, and there is a rapid increase in cellular [cAMP] that is involved in activation of H+ transport and other associated changes of oxyntic cells.

====Anaphylaxis====
In anaphylaxis (a severe systemic reaction to allergens, such as nuts, bee stings, or drugs), the body-wide degranulation of mast cells leads to vasodilation and, if severe, symptoms of life-threatening shock. Products released from these granules include histamine, serotonin, heparin, chondroitin sulphate, tryptase, chymase, carboxypeptidase, and TNF-α. These can vary in their quantities and proportions between individuals, which may explain some of the differences in symptoms seen across patients.

Histamine is a vasodilatory substance released during anaphylaxis.

====Autoimmunity====
Mast cells may be implicated in the pathology associated with autoimmune, inflammatory disorders of the joints. They have been shown to be involved in the recruitment of inflammatory cells to the joints (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis) and skin (e.g., bullous pemphigoid), and this activity is dependent on antibodies and complement components.

====Mastocytosis and clonal disorders====

Mastocytosis is a rare clonal mast cell disorder involving the presence of too many mast cells (&quot;mastocytes&quot;) and CD34+ mast cell precursors. Mutations in c-Kit are associated with mastocytosis. More specifically, the majority (&gt;80%) of patients with mastocytosis have a mutation at codon 816 in the kinase domain of KIT, known as the &quot;KIT&quot; D816V mutation. This mutation, as well as expression of either CD2 or CD25 (confirmed by immunostaining or flow cytometry), are characteristic of primary clonal/monoclonal mast cell activation syndrome (CMCAS/MMAS). The most commonly affected organs in mastocytosis are the skin and bone marrow.

====Monoclonal disorders====
====Neoplastic disorders====
Mastocytomas, or mast cell tumors, can secrete excessive quantities of degranulation products. They are often seen in dogs and cats. Other neoplastic disorders associated with mast cells include mast cell sarcoma and mast cell leukemia.

====Mast cell activation syndrome====

Mast cell activation syndrome (MCAS) is an idiopathic immune disorder that involves recurrent and excessive mast cell degranulation and which produces symptoms that are similar to other mast cell activation disorders. The syndrome is diagnosed based upon four sets of criteria involving treatment response, symptoms, a differential diagnosis, and biomarkers of mast cell degranulation.

==History==
Mast cells were first described by Paul Ehrlich in his 1878 doctoral thesis on the basis of their unique staining characteristics and large granules. These granules also led him to the incorrect belief that they existed to nourish the surrounding tissue, so he named them &quot;Mastzellen&quot; (, as of animals). They are now considered to be part of the immune system.

==Research==
===Autism===
Research into an immunological contribution to autism suggests that autism spectrum disorder (ASD) children may present with &quot;allergic-like&quot; problems in the absence of elevated serum IgE and chronic urticaria, suggesting non-allergic mast cell activation in response to environmental and stress triggers. This mast cell activation could contribute to brain inflammation and neurodevelopmental problems.

===Histological staining===
Toluidine blue: one of the most common stains for acid mucopolysaccharides and glycoaminoglycans, components of mast cells granules.

Bismarck brown: stains mast cell granules brown.

Surface markers: cell surface markers of mast cells were discussed in detail by Heneberg, claiming that mast cells may be inadvertently included in the stem or progenitor cell isolates, since part of them is positive for the CD34 antigen. The classical mast cell markers include the high-affinity IgE receptor, CD117 (c-Kit), and CD203c (for most of the mast cell populations). Expression of some molecules may change in course of the mast cell activation.

===Heterogeneity===
Mast cell heterogeneity significantly impacts the efficacy of mast cell stabilizing drugs disodium cromoglycate and ketotifen in preventing mediator release. In experiments, ketotifen inhibits mast cells from lung and tonsillar tissues when stimulated via an IgE-dependent histamine release mechanism, while disodium cromoglycate is less effective but still inhibited these mast cells. However, both agents fail to inhibit mediator release from skin mast cells, indicating that these cells are unresponsive to these stabilizers. Such differences in mast cell activation suggests the existence of different mast cell types across various tissuesa topic of ongoing research.

Mast cells and enterochromaffin cells are the source of most serotonin in the stomach in rodents.

<text>The Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company was an American motor vehicle manufacturer based in Buffalo, New York, active from 1901 to 1938. Although best known for its expensive luxury cars, Pierce-Arrow also manufactured commercial trucks, fire trucks, boats, camp trailers, motorcycles, and bicycles.

==Origin==

The forerunner of Pierce-Arrow was established in 1865 as Heinz, Pierce and Munschauer. The company was best known for its household items, especially its delicate, gilded birdcages. In 1872, George Norman Pierce bought out the other two principals of the company, changed the name to the George N. Pierce Company, and in 1896 added bicycles to the product line. The company failed in its attempt to build a steam-powered car in 1900 under license from Overman, but by 1901, had built its first single-cylinder, two-speed, no-reverse &quot;Motorette&quot;. In 1903, it produced a two-cylinder car, the &quot;Arrow&quot;.

In 1904, Pierce decided to concentrate on making a larger, more luxurious car for the upscale market, the &quot;Great Arrow&quot;. This became the company&#x27;s most successful product. The solidly built, four-cylinder car won the Glidden Tour in 1905, an endurance run to determine and celebrate the most reliable car. Thirty-three cars entered the 350-mile race from New York City to Bretton Woods, New Hampshire; the race was won by Percy Pierce in a &quot;Great Arrow&quot;.

The noted industrial architect Albert Kahn designed the Pierce Arrow Factory Complex at Elmwood Avenue and Great Arrow Avenue in about 1906. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1974. George Pierce sold all rights in the company in 1907, and he died three years later. In 1908, Pierce Motor Company was renamed as the Pierce-Arrow Motor Car Company.
In 1909, U.S. President William Howard Taft ordered two Pierce-Arrows (and two White Model M Tourers) to be used for state occasions, the first official cars of the White House.
The Pierce-Arrow&#x27;s engine displacement started at , continuing to a massive and was increased later to 5 inch bore and 7 inch stroke for , at the time making it by far the largest Otto engine offered in any production automobile in the world. In 1910, Pierce dropped its other 4-cylinder models and focused exclusively on 6-cylinder cars until 1929. The model 6-36, 6-48, and 6-66 continued for the next decade. Starting in 1918, Pierce-Arrow adopted a four-valve per cylinder T-head inline-six engine (Dual Valve Six) and three spark plugs per cylinder, one of the few, if only, multi-valve flathead design engines ever made. The company did not introduce an 8-cylinder engine until the 1929 Model 126, and a V-12 engine was offered in 1931 until the company closed in 1938.

In 1910, George Pierce died. In 1912, Herbert M. Dawley (later a Broadway actor-director) joined Pierce-Arrow, and he designed almost every model until 1938. Until 1914, Pierce-Arrow also made a line of motorcycles, including the Pierce Four.
In 1914, Pierce-Arrow adopted its most enduring styling hallmark when its headlights were moved from a traditional placement at the radiator&#x27;s sides, into flared housings molded into the front fenders of the car. This gave the car an immediately visible distinction in front or side views. At night, the car appeared to have a wider stance. Pierce patented this placement, which endured until the final model of 1938, although Pierce always offered customers the option of conventional headlamps; only a minority ordered this option.

The Pierce-Arrow was a status symbol, owned by many Hollywood stars and tycoons, and a favorite was the Pierce-Arrow Town Car. Most of the royalty of the world had at least one Pierce-Arrow in its collection. Some have described Pierce and two of its rivals among American luxury cars, Peerless and Packard, as the &quot;Three P&#x27;s of Motordom.&quot; Industrial efficiency expert Frank Gilbreth, father of the authors of &quot;Cheaper By The Dozen,&quot; extolled the virtues of Pierce-Arrow, in both quality and in its ability to safely transport his large family. Its wheelbase was . The transmission was a four speed manual in 1919. Actor Sessue Hayakawa (famed for his role in &quot;Bridge on the River Kwai&quot;) drove a custom-ordered gold-plated Pierce-Arrow. A restored 1919 Pierce-Arrow is on display at the Woodrow Wilson Presidential Library. An open-bodied Pierce-Arrow carried Woodrow Wilson and Warren G. Harding to Harding&#x27;s 1921 inauguration, and one was used prominently in the 1950 movie &quot;Cheaper by the Dozen&quot;.

Pierce-Arrow advertisements were artistic and understated. Unusual for car advertising, the image of the car was in the background rather than the foreground of the picture. Usually, only part of the car was visible. The Pierce-Arrow was typically depicted in elegant and fashionable settings. Some advertisements featured the car in places a car would not normally go, such as the West and other rural settings, a testament to the car&#x27;s ruggedness and quality.

Because of the immense size of most models, several second-hand Pierce-Arrow cars were bought by fire departments, stripped down to the chassis and engine, the wheelbase lengthened, and built back into fire engines. Some of these fire engines were in service for up to 20 years.

==1928–1933==
In 1928, the Studebaker Corporation of South Bend, Indiana, gained control of the Buffalo firm. The association was to last for five years, with moderate benefits to both companies&#x27; engineering departments, which continued to function as separate entities. Pierce-Arrow also gained a dealer network, as the cars were sold through Studebaker dealerships. Under Studebaker&#x27;s ownership, Pierce-Arrow retired the venerable 6-cylinder engine and in 1929 introduced an L-head straight-eight engine, which displaced .

==1933-1938==

In 1933, Pierce-Arrow unveiled the radically streamlined Silver Arrow in a final attempt to appeal to the wealthy at the New York Auto Show. The car was well received by the public and the motoring press, being announced with the slogan &quot;Suddenly it&#x27;s 1940!&quot; Pierce sold five examples but, since it was priced at $10,000 (equal to $ today) during the worst of the Depression, even the rich were hesitant to spend so much. The bodies were built at Studebaker, which subsequently assisted in rolling out a lower-priced production model. This, however, lacked many luxury features of the show car and still failed to generate enough sales.

Starting in 1936, Pierce-Arrow produced a line of camper-trailers, the Pierce-Arrow Travelodge. They also produced a new V12 sedan that was redesigned and considered the safest and most luxurious sedan of its day.
The Rio Grande Southern Railroad converted five Pierce-Arrow automobiles (and a couple of Buicks) into motorized railcars, effectively buses and trucks on rail wheels. The nickname &quot;Galloping Goose&quot; was soon applied to these vehicles, reportedly based on their waddling motion and honking horn. Three are preserved in the Colorado Railroad Museum at Golden.

Pierce was the only luxury brand that did not field a lower-priced car (&quot;e.g.&quot;, the Packard 120) to provide cash flow, and without sales or funds for development, the company declared insolvency in 1938 and closed its doors. The final Pierce-Arrow assembled was built by Karl Wise, the firm&#x27;s chief engineer, from parts secured from the company&#x27;s receivers. Pierce&#x27;s remaining assets (which probably would include the forty Arrows made in October 1938) were sold at auction on a Friday, May 13, 1938.

The factory equipment used to make Pierce-Arrow V12 engines was bought by Seagrave Fire Apparatus, which used it to make engines for fire engines.

==Name trademark==
In 2006, a group of classic car enthusiasts from Switzerland applied the name to a 10 L, 24-cylinder car designed by Luigi Colani. According to their (defunct) website, the company intended to revive the Pierce-Arrow car in the form of a Pierce Silver Arrow II.

The U.S. Trademark Trial and Appeal Board ruled on August 12, 2019, that &quot;Pierce-Arrow&quot; cannot be registered by an unrelated third party as a trademark for the production of a new automobile. This decision establishes a new precedent for protection of Collective Membership Marks.

<doc id="254067" wikidata="Q2084807" url="?curid=254067" title="Topfreedom">
<text>Topfreedom is a cultural and political movement seeking changes in laws to allow women to be topless in public places where men are permitted to be barechested, as a form of gender equality. Specifically, the movement seeks the repeal or overturning of laws which restrict a woman&#x27;s right not to have her chest covered at all times in public.

In addition, topfreedom advocates seek allowing nursing mothers to openly breastfeed in public.

==Social and legal attitudes==
Many societies consider women who expose their nipples and areolae as immodest and contrary to social norms. In many jurisdictions a topless woman may be cited for public lewdness, indecent exposure, public indecency or disorderly conduct. Independently from the legality of the practice, topless women may also face harassment. Topfreedom advocates seek to change community attitudes to breasts as sex objects or indecent.

Several countries in Europe have decriminalised non-sexual toplessness. Topless swimming and sunbathing on beaches has become acceptable in many parts of Europe, though the practice remains controversial in many places, and not common in most places. Many public swimming pools in Europe are owned by municipalities, which are treated as private organisations and allowed to set their dress codes.

===Breastfeeding===

In many countries around the world, breastfeeding in public is not unusual. During 2006–2010 and earlier, a number of news reports in the United States cited incidents where women were refused service or harassed for breastfeeding in public. In response, a majority of U.S. states have passed laws explicitly permitting nursing in public. The United States federal government enacted a law in 1999 which specifically provides that &quot;a woman may breastfeed her child at any location in a Federal building or on Federal property, if the woman and her child are otherwise authorized to be present at the location.&quot; However, these laws generally do not apply to rules imposed by private organizations or on private property, such as restaurants, airlines, or shopping malls.

==Topfreedom by country==
===Asia===
====Taiwan====

In support of Icelandic student Adda Smaradottir&#x27;s FreeTheNipple act in public cyberspace, young women uploaded their topless photos to Facebook and protested against its Community Standards of considering women&#x27;s breasts as sexual materials. Those photos and related news articles were blocked initially, but Facebook considered those photos did not violate Community Standards.

===Europe===
====Denmark====
Bathing and sunbathing in the nude (including topless) is legal on Danish beaches. Nudity and toplessness in other public outdoor places is generally also legal, unless it involves &quot;offensive conduct&quot; or is likely to cause public outrage. The public outrage law is rarely used in practice, but in 1972 audience members were convicted of being nude in the Royal Danish Theatre. In December 2007, a group of women and men calling themselves Topless Front swam topless in public swim baths to promote topless equality. In March 2008, after a campaign by the group, Copenhagen&#x27;s Culture and Leisure Committee voted to allow topless bathing in its swimming pools. After the committee had voted, it was revealed that no laws had existed against topless bathing, effectively making the vote unnecessary. However, some public baths had (and have) restricted it themselves. Public breastfeeding is supported by the vast majority of both sexes in Denmark, is entirely legal and accepted in almost all places, except for a few private cafés and restaurants that have restricted it.

====Finland====
In Finland, toplessness is not illegal, yet topless women have been removed from beaches. and criticized this and organized Finland&#x27;s first event demanding topless equality, called Tissiflashmob (Breast flash mob). On Finland&#x27;s Independence day, 6 December 2019, both Marins and Vallarén showed their breasts on live TV and it sparked a lot of conversation. Tissiflashmob 2020 was bigger than the previous one, now organized at the same time in eight different cities. The city of Helsinki has decided to allow topless sunbathing on its beaches in 2023, regardless of gender. 

====France====
In France, the feminist collective Les TumulTueuses organized a topfree protest in Paris in May 2009. It is legal to sunbathe topless in France, although local regulations may ban the practice with directives about clothing. In 2020, after a police incident, topless sunbathing was defended by the French interior minister.

====Greece====
In Greece, toplessness is legal.

====Iceland====
In Iceland, toplessness is legal.

====Italy====
Female toplessness has been officially legalized (in a nonsexual context) in all public beaches and swimming pools throughout the country (unless otherwise specified by region, province or municipality by-laws) on 20 March 2000, when the Supreme Court of Cassation (through sentence No. 3557) determined that the exposure of the nude female breast, after several decades, is now considered a &quot;commonly accepted behavior&quot;, and therefore, has &quot;entered into the social costume&quot;.

====Poland====
In Poland in 2008–2009, two women from Szczecin including glamour model Dorota Krzysztofek, won a court battle that reasserted the women&#x27;s right to sunbathe topless on public beaches. Krzysztofek, along with her female companion, were fined by local municipal officials for topless sunbathing at a public recreation area. The women refused to pay the fine and took the matter to Civil Court. Their first hearing had to be postponed due to remarkable media interest.

On November 7, 2008, judge Szczepańska upheld the city staff decision, and charged the women with indecent exposure, explaining that their personal freedoms cannot encroach on the freedoms of families with children who frequent the same recreation spot. Although topless sunbathing is not prohibited in Poland, the judge sentenced them to pay a fine of 230 zlotys (150 zlotys by different source, or €40, $55) for breaking the rules of conduct. In her rationale, the judge also said that it is not up to the defendants to teach youngsters human anatomy; however, her decision was appealed by Krzysztofek&#x27;s female friend soon afterwards, with the plea of not guilty.

In 2009, the appellate court declared both women to be innocent, because the city staff were unable to prove that anyone at the beach was indignant or scandalized by their toplessness, and no complaint was ever reported. On the contrary, some visitors stood up to their defense. There were no signs at the recreation area against what is otherwise legal. The appellate court&#x27;s decision was binding, but it also created an aura of ambivalence, with topless sunbathing in public declared acceptable only if nobody else including families with children formally objects to it.

====Romania====
In Romania, women are allowed to appear topless in public as long as it does not have sexual connotations.

====Spain====
There are no laws in Spain that officially prohibit public nudity (in a non-sexual context), and because of this, both topless sunbathing and naturism (the latter on a smaller scale) are frequently practiced without any issues in all beaches throughout the country, while the amount of partakers may vary depending on the location and the day. It is very common in the Balearic Islands, Canaries, Costa Brava and Costa del Sol (a few municipalities, such as Barcelona, have created by-laws to forbid public nudity, including female toplessness on their streets, not on the beach). Due to the widespread practice of topless sunbathing, the municipalities of Galdakao and L&#x27;Ametlla del Vallès decided to legalize female toplessness on their public pools (in March 2016 and June 2018, respectively), and it is tolerated in many others, like in Madrid (without the need of a specific rule). It is less common on private or condominium pools, and a few have by-laws to ban it. Moreover, there are some surveys indicating that more than 40% of the Spanish women who were interviewed (aged 18 or older) reported to have been topless on a beach at least once.

====Sweden====
In Sweden, toplessness is not explicitly illegal. The law usually applied to cases of nudity is about disorderly conduct (&quot;förargelseväckande beteende&quot;) – it does not say anything about how undressed one can be, so it&#x27;s a matter of legal tradition, although there is a law against gender discrimination. However, private or public establishments are permitted to establish dress codes which may require women to wear tops, and deny access or remove individuals who breach these standards. In September 2007, the &quot;Bara Bröst&quot; group (a pun meaning both &quot;Only Breasts&quot; and &quot;Bare Breasts&quot;) appeared to promote topless equality in these semi-public facilities. The group staged several events in public swim baths in September and October 2007, starting in Uppsala from which they were evicted several times, before succeeding in Sundsvall.

The group scored a victory in June 2009 when the Malmö city&#x27;s sports and recreation committee approved new rules that, while requiring everybody to wear bathing suits at indoor public swimming pools, did not require women to cover their breasts. &quot;We don&#x27;t define what bathing suits men should wear so it doesn&#x27;t make much sense to do it for women. And besides, it&#x27;s not unusual for men to have large breasts that resemble women&#x27;s breasts&quot;, said a council spokesman.

====United Kingdom====
According to the Crown Prosecution Service, &quot;In the absence of any sexual context and in relation to nudity where the person has no intention to cause alarm or distress it will normally be appropriate to take no action unless members of the public were actually caused harassment, alarm or distress (as opposed to considering the likelihood of this).&quot; Breastfeeding is a specifically protected activity.

===North America===
====Canada====

In 1991, toplessness as an indecent act was challenged by Gwen Jacob in Guelph, Ontario, who removed her shirt and was charged with indecency. Part of her defense was the double standards between men and women. Although she was convicted, this was overturned by the Court of Appeal. This case determined that being topless is not indecent under the meaning of the Criminal Code. However it did not establish any constitutional right of equality. This case subsequently led to the acquittal of women in British Columbia and Saskatchewan who faced similar charges. Although each province and territory technically reserves its right to interpret the law as it pleases, the Ontario case has proven influential. Since the matter has not been determined by the Supreme Court of Canada, it is still possible that a woman could be convicted elsewhere in Canada, but interpretation of moral law in Canada has become increasingly liberalized. There do not appear to have been any further women charged in Canada since these cases were determined.

In February 2023, the cities of Edmonton and Calgary, both in the province of Alberta, changed their policies such that wearing bathing suit tops in city-operated pools was an individual&#x27;s choice.

====Mexico====
The only public place in Mexico that officially allows female toplessness is Playa Zipolite (a nude beach located in the state of Oaxaca), where the practice of naturism was legalized in 2016. However, the practice of topless sunbathing (as well as naturism in some cases) is commonly tolerated on a few beaches in the state of Quintana Roo, more precisely in the Riviera Maya region (especially between the cities of Playa del Carmen and Tulum); furthermore, there are a few clothing-optional resorts made for adults only (also located in the Riviera Maya) where all men and women aged 18 (or older) can frequent the facilities without the need to wear clothes (if so they wish).

====United States====

In the United States, states have primary jurisdiction in matters of public morality. The topfreedom movement has claimed success in a few instances in persuading some state and federal courts to overturn some state laws on the basis of sex discrimination or equal protection, arguing that a woman should be free to expose her chest in any context in which a man can expose his. Other successful cases have been on the basis of freedom of expression in protest, or simply that exposure of breasts is not indecent (or similar terminology).

Laws and ordinances barring female toplessness are being challenged in federal courts around the nation. Each lawsuit, if it prevails at the appellate level, will legalize topfreedom in the following U.S. circuit courts of appeals (from west to east): 9 (California), 8 (Missouri) and 1 (Maryland). A federal lawsuit in the 7th Circuit (Illinois), was lost at the appellate level and the petition for review by the U.S. Supreme Court was denied.

A preliminary injunction in a federal lawsuit in the 10th Circuit (Colorado), was won at the appellate level. In September 2019, after spending over $300,000, Fort Collins decided to stop defending their ordinance and repeal it. That effectively gave females of all ages the right to go topless wherever males can in the jurisdiction of the 10th Circuit (Wyoming, Utah, Colorado, New Mexico, Kansas and Oklahoma states as well as all counties and cities therein).

===Oceania===
====Australia====
In Australia, indecent exposure laws only refer to the genital area, so technically both male and female toplessness is legal. However, many local councils impose their own rules, and have the power to ask topless people to leave an area. Additionally, women who go topless are sometimes issued charges such as being a public nuisance, or offensive behaviour.

On public beaches, local bylaws are not heavily enforced, and women can often sunbathe topless without legal repercussions.

Breastfeeding in public places is a legal right in Australia. Under the Sex Discrimination Act 1984, no business or service provider can discriminate against a breastfeeding woman. Women can still breastfeed even if no other food/drink is allowed in the area. If a special baby care room is available for breastfeeding, women are not required to use it unless they wish to. If someone abuses a breastfeeding woman or forces her to leave, this may come under state/territory harassment laws. These protections also include women who are expressing breast milk for their baby.

====New Zealand====
In New Zealand, there is no specific law prohibiting nudity in public places. If a person is nude &quot;and&quot; also exhibiting lewd and lascivious, or obscene behaviour, then they may fall afoul of laws.

The High Court of New Zealand has upheld a conviction of disorderly conduct for nudity in the street, because it was not a place where nudity was known to occur or commonplace. Being nude in the street is likely to incur a small fine if a complaint is made against the person, or if the person ignores a police order to cover themselves. However, in practice, the likelihood of being prosecuted for nudity on a public beach is low, providing the person keeps to themselves.

In 2012, a woman swam topless on Ōpunake beach. The police were called, but informed the callers that toplessness was not an offence.

In 2017, nudists used the beach at Tauranga, which caused consternation among some residents. However, the local council said there were no bylaws dealing with the issue, and that nudity was not an offence.

===South America===
====Argentina====
Female toplessness is allowed in the official nude beaches of Puerto Escondido, located near Miramar, and Playa Querandí, located in Villa Gesell, as well as in some private naturist resorts.

On 7 February 2017, hundreds of topless women protested in Buenos Aires, Córdoba, Mar del Plata and Rosario, among other cities throughout the country. The protest was called in Spanish &quot;tetazo&quot; (a portmanteau of the Spanish word &quot;tetas&quot;, meaning &quot;tits&quot;, and the Spanish suffix &quot;-azo&quot;, which denotes a hitting action). The protestors objected against the &quot;objectification&quot; of the female body, and also disapproved the decision made by 20 police officers, who days before, had expelled from a beach located in Necochea 3 women who were topless sunbathing there.

====Brazil====
The Article 233 of the Chapter VI of the Title VI of the Penal Code asserts that indecent exposure (known in Portuguese as &quot;ato obsceno&quot;, meaning &quot;obscene act&quot;) is a wrongdoing act punished with imprisonment or fine, but does not specify what are the nude parts of the human body which could be fitted on this misdemeanor. Despite this vagueness, female toplessness tends to be considered an &quot;obscene act&quot; by the Brazilian authorities, and the practice has been frequently repressed, including some arrests made by the police throughout the years.

Generally, the practice of topless sunbathing by women has been accepted only in official nude beaches and in some private naturist clubs. However, for many years, there has been one notable exception: the Carnival in Rio de Janeiro. During the famous two-night parades yearly held by 12 samba schools (6 on each day) at the Sambadrome Marquês de Sapucaí, the official policy is that only the genital area cannot be publicly shown (in this case all nude men and women must wear a merkin, which is known in Portuguese as &quot;tapa-sexo&quot;, roughly translated as &quot;sex cover&quot;). Thus, both men and women can openly expose their bare breasts and buttocks to the public during the marches without any problem.

Since the early 2010s, there are reports of some small and sporadic protests, especially in some beaches located in Rio de Janeiro. These protests are called in Portuguese &quot;toplessaços&quot; (a portmanteau of the English word &quot;toplessness&quot; and the Portuguese suffix &quot;-aço&quot;, translated from the Spanish &quot;-azo&quot;, which denotes a hitting action). In each protest, a group of women, soon after being reunited, decide to quickly take off all clothes they were wearing above the waist (including bras, bikinis or any other tops), culminating in a state of public &quot;breast-flashing&quot; for a few minutes before putting on their clothes again. This way, these are considered a kind of topless flash mob protests. The purpose of these protests is to claim for the official legalization of female toplessness in Brazil under the principle of gender equality.

====Chile====
Exposing the breasts in public is not a crime, although it is an offense applicable according to the Article 373 of the Penal Code to those who &quot;in any way offend modesty or good customs&quot;. Similarly, the Article 495 says: &quot;Shall be punished with a fine of one monthly tax unit (first paragraph) whoever contravenes the rules that the authority dictates to preserve public order or prevent it from being altered, unless the act constitutes a crime or simple offense&quot;.

Faced with so much inconvenience, a group of women together with the photographer and pioneer of naturism in Chile, René Rojas, managed to create the first nude beach in the country in 2000, called Playa Luna, as well as the unofficial restricted areas that were created in Playa Luna Norte (Tarapacá), Playa Luna Sur (Coliumo), Playa Escondida (Antofagasta), Playa Blanca (Tongoy) and Pichilemu, where it is possible to completely undress with total normality.

====Uruguay====
The practice of female toplessness is allowed in the official nude beaches of Chihuahua, located in the resort of the same name, and La Sirena, located in the resort of Aguas Dulces.

<text>Demchugdongrub (8 February 1902 – 23 May 1966), also known as Prince De (), courtesy name Xixian (), was a Qing dynasty Chinese Mongol prince descended from the Borjigin imperial clan who lived during the 20th century and became the leader of an independence movement in Inner Mongolia. He was most notable for being the chairman of the pro-Japanese Mongol Military Government (1938–39) and later of the puppet state of Mengjiang (1939–45), during the Second Sino-Japanese War. In the modern day, some see Demchugdongrub as a Mongol nationalist promoting Pan-Mongolism, while others view him as a traitor and a pawn of the Japanese during World War II.

==Early life==
Demchugdongrub was a Chahar born into the Plain White Banner of the Eight Banners in Chahar Province during the Qing dynasty. He was the sole son of Namjil Wangchuk, the Duoluo Duling Junwang ( &quot;Duōluō Dùléng Jùnwáng&quot;) of the Sönid Right Banner and Chief of the Xilingol League. His name consists of the Tibetan words &quot;Chakrasamvara&quot; () and &quot;Siddhartha&quot; () respectively.

After Namjil Wangchuk died in 1908, the six-year-old Demchugdongrub, with the approval of the Qing, inherited one of his father&#x27;s titles – the Duoluo Duling Junwang. In his youth Demchugdongrub studied the Mongolian, Chinese, and Manchu languages. After the fall of the Qing, Yuan Shikai promoted Demchugdongrub to the title of Jasagh Heshuo Duling Jinong ( &quot;Zhāsàkè Héshuò Dùléng Qīnwáng&quot;) in 1912.

Demchugdongrub married a daughter of a Taiji (Qing aristocratic title) nobleman from his own Sönid Right Banner, and the next year had their first child, Dolgorsuren ( &quot;Dōugǔ&#x27;ěrsūlóng&quot;). Several years later, Demchugdongrub had four more sons and one daughter with his second wife, Fujin ( &quot;Fújìn&quot;), a daughter of another Taiji nobleman from the Abaga Banner.

===Early political activities===
Demchugdongrub was appointed as a member of the Chahar Provincial Committee in 1929. In 1931, he succeeded to the post of the Chief of the Xilingol League after Yang Cang ( &quot;Yáng Sāng&quot;) and Sodnom Rabdan ( &quot;Suǒtènàmù Lābùtǎn&quot;).

During September 1933, the Mongolian princes of Chahar Province and Suiyuan traveled to the temple at Bailingmiao north of Guihua and gathered in a council chamber with Demchugdongrub, who for months had been trying to found a pan-Mongolian self-rule movement. In mid-October, despite their traditional suspicions of one another, they and Demchugdongrub agreed to draw up confederation documents for the Inner Mongolian banners. They sent word to Nanjing that they intended to rule Inner Mongolia themselves. They indicated that if they were obstructed by the Chinese government, then they would not hesitate to seek assistance from Japan. In response, Nanjing sent Huang Shaohong as an envoy, who in the end authorized the creation of the Mongol Local Autonomy Political Affairs Committee.

==Collaboration with the Japanese==

In 1935, Demchugdongrub, now the leader of the Mongols of Inner Mongolia, made serious efforts to set up an autonomous Mongolian Government in Chahar and Suiyuan. The Japanese General Jirō Minami, commander of the Kwantung Army, and Colonel Seishirō Itagaki gave support to the new Inner Mongolian Autonomous Government, which they felt would weaken China and be subject to the influence of Japan. In April 1935 Minami sent Major Ryūkichi Tanaka and another officer to interview Demchugdongrub with the goal of formalizing Japanese support, but Demchugdongrub did not agree to terms set by the Japanese at that time.

After establishing a ceremonial Mengjiang-Manchukuo alliance in May 1935, Puyi honoured Demchugdongrub with the title of &quot;Martial Virtue Prince of the First Rank&quot; ( &quot;Wǔdé Qīnwáng&quot;). In June 1935 the North Chahar Incident and the resulting Chin–Doihara Agreement substantially affected events in Chahar Province.

The most important provisions of the Chin-Doihara Agreement forced all units of the Chinese 29th Army to be withdrawn from the eastern districts of Chahar province and north of Changpei, including the 132nd Division in Changpei. The withdrawal of the 132nd Division effectively ceded control of nearly all of Chahar province in Mengjiang. Peace and order in Chahar was to be entrusted to the Peace Preservation Corps, an organization that was little more than a police force with light arms only.

Also, no Chinese were to be permitted to migrate to or settle in the northern part of Chahar Province, which was largely populated by nomadic Mongols. No activities of the Kuomintang were to be permitted in Chahar Province. All anti-Japanese institutions and official acts in Chahar Province were banned. When General Minami met with Prince Demchugdongrub in August 1935, the Prince promised close cooperation with Japan, and Minami promised financial assistance to the Prince.

==Expansion into Chahar==

On 24 December 1935, General Minami sent two battalions of irregular Manchurian cavalry under Li Shouxin, a squadron of Japanese planes, and a few tanks to assist the Prince in taking over the northern part of Chahar province. The six districts of northern Chahar were defended by only a few thousand lightly armed Chinese Peace Preservation Corps. With Li&#x27;s assistance the Prince&#x27;s forces were soon able to overrun the area.

The Japanese Kwantung Army, in February 1936, decided to establish the Mongol Military Government ( &quot;Ménggǔ Jūnzhèngfǔ&quot;). with Demchugdongrub as the commander and as the advisor. The Japanese proclaimed that Demchugdongrub was on a mission to &quot;inherit the great spirit of Genghis Khan and retake the territories that belong to Mongolia, completing the grand task of reviving the prosperity of the nationality&quot;.

==Expansion into Suiyuan==
In March 1936, Manchukuo troops occupying Chahar Province invaded northeastern Suiyuan, which was controlled by the Shanxi warlord Yan Xishan. These Japanese-aligned troops seized Bailingmiao in northern Suiyuan, where the pro-Japanese Inner Mongolian Autonomous Political Council maintained its headquarters. Three months later Demchugdongrub, as the head of the Political Council, declared that he was the ruler of an independent Mongolia, and organized an army with the aid of Japanese equipment and training.

On 21–26 April 1936 Demchugdongrub and Li Shouxin met with the Japanese Special Service Chief Captain Takayoshi Tanaka at West Wuchumuhsin. Representatives from places in Inner Mongolia, Qinghai and Mongolia also attended the meeting, which was called the &quot;State-Founding Conference&quot;. A plan was drawn up to create a Mongolian State which would include all of Mongolia and Qinghai. It was to be a monarchy, but would initially be run by an interim committee. A Mongolian Congress was planned and most importantly there was a plan to organize a Mongolian military government and an army. The Mongol Military Government was formed on 12 May 1936. A mutual assistance agreement with Manchukuo was also concluded in July 1936, with Japan providing military and economic aid.

After the conclusion of the treaty, Demchugdongrub set out to enlarge and equip the Inner Mongolian Army for the expansion of his new state into Suiyuan. The Prince increased his army from three cavalry divisions to nine with the aid of Takayoshi Tanaka and his Japanese advisors. The Japanese provided arms captured from the Northeastern Army, but Tanaka ignored the advice of the Mongolian leaders and recruited poorly armed levies and ex-bandits from various regions.

Because it had no ideological unity, poor training, and only enough rifles for half of the soldiers, this force had poor morale and cohesion. It totaled about 10,000 men. A puppet Chinese army, the Grand Han Righteous Army under Wang Ying was attached to Demchugdongrub&#x27;s Inner Mongolian Army.

==Conflict with Yan Xishan==
In August 1936 Demchugdongrub&#x27;s army attempted to invade eastern Suiyuan, but it was defeated by Yan Xishan&#x27;s forces under the command of Fu Zuoyi. Following this defeat, Demchugdongrub rebuilt his armed forces and planned another invasion. Japanese agents carefully sketched and photographed Suiyuan&#x27;s defenses while Demchugdongrub was rebuilding his armed forces.

In November 1936 Demchugdongrub presented Fu Zuoyi with an ultimatum to surrender. When Fu responded that Demchugdongrub was merely a puppet of &quot;certain quarters&quot; and requested that he submit to the authority of the Chiang Kai-shek&#x27;s central government, Prince De&#x27;s Mongolian and Manchurian armies launched another, more ambitious attack. This time Demchugdongrub&#x27;s 15,000 soldiers were armed with Japanese weapons, supported by Japanese aircraft, and often led by Japanese officers. (Japanese soldiers fighting for Mengguguo were often executed by Chinese forces after their capture as illegal combatants, since Mengjiang was not recognized as being part of Japan).

In anticipation of this attempt to take control of Suiyuan, Japanese spies destroyed a large supply depot in Datong and carried out other acts of sabotage. Yan Xishan placed his best troops and most able generals, including Zhao Chengshou and Yan&#x27;s son-in-law, Wang Jingguo, under the command of Fu Zuoyi. During the month of fighting that ensued, the army of Mengguguo suffered severe casualties. Fu&#x27;s forces succeeded in occupying Bailingmiao on 24 November 1936, and was considering invading Chahar before he was warned by the Kwantung Army that doing so would provoke an attack by the Japanese Army. Demchugdongrub&#x27;s forces repeatedly attempted to retake Bailingmiao, but this only provoked Fu into sending troops north, where he successfully seized the last of Demchugdongrub&#x27;s bases in Suiyuan and virtually annihilated his army. After Japanese were found to be fighting in Demchugdongrub&#x27;s army, Yan publicly accused Japan of aiding the invaders. Yan&#x27;s victories in Suiyuan over Japanese-backed forces were praised by Chinese newspapers and magazines, other warlords and political leaders, and many students and other members of the Chinese public.

Demchugdongrub withdrew to Chahar and again reconstructed his army with Japanese help. By the time that the Second Sino-Japanese War began, in July 1937, his army consisted of 20,000 men in eight Cavalry Divisions. The forces under his command participated in Operation Chahar and the Battle of Taiyuan, when the Japanese and Mongol forces finally captured most of Suiyuan province.

The Mengjiang United Autonomous Government ( &quot;Méngjiāng Liánhé Zìzhìzhèngfǔ&quot;) was set up in 1939 with Demchugdongrub first being the vice-chairman, then the chairman. In 1941 he became chairman of the Mongolian Autonomous Federation.

==Downfall==
After World War II, and the collapse of the Federation, Demchugdongrub lived in Beijing for four years under the supervision of the Kuomintang government. Just before the founding of the People&#x27;s Republic of China, in August 1949 he managed to establish an &quot;Autonomous Government&quot; in the westernmost region of Inner Mongolia. In December, threatened by the Communist army, Demchugdongrub fled to the People&#x27;s Republic of Mongolia and was at first welcomed there, but was later arrested by the authorities in the following February and deported to China in September 1950, where he was charged with treason. Under supervision, he wrote nine memoirs and was pardoned 13 years later in April 1963. After his release from jail, Demchugdongrub worked at an Inner Mongolian history museum in Hohhot until his death at the age of 64.

<text>A stowaway or clandestine traveller is a person who secretly boards a vehicle, such as a ship, an aircraft, a train, cargo truck or bus.

Sometimes, the purpose is to get from one place to another without paying for transportation. In other cases, the goal is to enter another country without first obtaining a travel visa or other permission. Stowaways differ from people smuggling in that the stowaway needs to avoid detection by the truck driver, ship crew, and others responsible for the safe and secure operation of the transportation service.

Thousands of stowaways have travelled by sea or land over the last several centuries. A much smaller number of people have attempted to stowaway on aircraft. Many stowaways have died during the attempt, especially in cases of train surfing and wheel-well stowaway flights.

== Origin ==
The word takes its origin with the expression &quot;stow away&quot;. This &quot;stow away&quot; expression is old and was used for things (such as food), such usage is seen for instance in the 1689 book &quot;A New Voyage Round the World, Volume 1&quot; or 1637 &quot;Journals of the House of Lords, Volume 11&quot;.

The word was also used (later) for people. This gave names such as &quot;stow-aways&quot;, when the correct current name in modern English language is &quot;stowaway&quot;. Depending on the circumstances, people were stowed away in order to hide themselves, or to be transported as slaves. The concept of people hiding is not so recent; it was yet forbidden (and so known) in 1748 by king of Spain, under the &quot;polizón&quot; denomination.

=== In the United States ===
The US legislation set up a stowaway concept in 1850. Previously, entry into the territory was free and the &quot;stowaway&quot; word might be older.

In 1891, the new US legislation required the boat to pay the return travel for people not admitted in US, even if stowaways were still admitted.

474 stowaways arrived in US in fiscal year 1910, and 528 next year.

In 1917, a new legislation defined a list of excludable aliens, including stowaways.

Several stowaways arrived in United States by boat during the first half of twentieth century; they were paying for 25 to 30 dollars to travel.

=== From 1843 ===
The Convention on Facilitation of International Maritime Traffic, 1965, as amended, (The FAL Convention), define stowaway as&quot;A person who is secreted on a ship, or in cargo which is subsequently loaded on the ship, without the consent of the shipowner or the master or any other responsible person and who is detected on board the ship after it has departed from a port, or in the cargo while unloading it in the port of arrival, and is reported as a stowaway by the master to the appropriate authorities&quot;.Unnoticed by the captain, crew, port officials and customs authorities, stowaways may gain access to a ship with or without the assistance of port personnel. Once on board the ship, stowaways hide in empty containers, cargo holds, tanks, tunnels, behind false panels, stores, accommodation areas, engine rooms, void spaces, cranes and chain lockers.

The presence of stowaways on board ships may bring serious consequences for ships and, by extension, to the shipping industry as a whole; the ship could be delayed in port; the repatriation of stowaways can be a very complex and costly procedure involving masters, shipowners, port authorities and agents, and the life of stowaways could be endangered as they may spend several days hidden, with the risk of suffocation and without any food or water.

== By transport mode ==

=== Rail transportation ===
Some undocumented migrants travel around Europe in trucks and trains without being detected. A number of them try to get to other European countries, such as France and the United Kingdom.

=== Land travel ===
Stowaways sometimes hide themselves in vehicles such as cargo trucks to get between cities. Although this is also done by migrants who have paid the driver, it is also done by individuals hiding from the driver. In some places, drivers are legally responsible for making sure that stowaways do not board their vehicles, and can be fined or jailed if they do not detect and remove a stowaway when crossing national borders.
=== Ship travel ===
Stowaways on sailing ships and on steamships made this way of illicit travel known throughout the world. Throughout the nineteenth and twentieth centuries poor, would-be emigrants and travelers seeking adventure for no cost helped to make it seem romantic. Noted stowaways to America by steamship have included Henry Armetta, Bruno Richard Hauptmann, Willem de Kooning, Jan Valtin, and Florentino Das. 

Stowaways typically board the ship while it is in port. This can be by the gangway or by climbing the ships side when the crew are not maintaining an adequate security watch of the vessel. To prevent stowaways on ships, the International Chamber of Shipping and Witherbys provide guidance to ships on managing the risks associated with stowaways and with rescue of displaced persons at sea. The International Maritime Organization have also issued revised guidelines for the prevention of access by stowaways.

=== Air travel ===

Poor perimeter security at a number of airports around the world can make it easier for people to stow away on planes. Aviation authorities worry about stowaways because poor security also makes them vulnerable to terrorists and other malicious actors.

Stowaways in aircraft wheel wells face numerous health risks, many of which are fatal: being mangled when the undercarriage retracts, tinnitus, deafness, hypothermia, hypoxia, frostbite, acidosis and finally falling when the doors of the compartment reopen. The landing gear compartment is not equipped with heating, pressure or oxygen, which are vital for survival at a high altitude. According to experts, at , hypoxia causes lightheadedness, weakness, vision impairment and tremors. By the oxygen level of the blood drops and the person will struggle to stay conscious. Above their lungs would need artificial pressure to operate normally. The temperature could drop as low as which causes severe hypothermia. Those stowaways who managed to not be crushed by the retracting undercarriage or killed by the deadly conditions would most likely be unconscious when the compartment door re-opens during the approach and fall several thousand feet to their deaths.

David Learmount, an aviation expert of Flight International, told &quot;BBC&quot; about a lot of ignorance in this area. He suggested that no one would be willing to risk such a journey having full understanding of this kind of ordeal. Stowaways who survived usually travelled relatively short distances or at a low altitude. Two cases are known of people who survived at an altitude of about  – a man on an 8-hour flight, whose body core temperature fell to , and a 16-year-old boy who was unharmed by a 5.5 hour flight, despite losing consciousness. Almost all aircraft stowaways are male.

Aside from risk to themselves, aircraft stowaways can also cause significant risk and stress to others when impacted equipment compromises safety, as well as significant cost of equipment repair, damage to aircraft on landing, and runway closures. In 1994, Flight PH844 discovered the body of a deceased male stowaway was jamming the starboard carriageway. After 3.5 hours of maneuvers attempting to dislodge the body, the flight made an emergency landing using only the nosewheel and port undercarriage. The air force of another country was required to assist move the damaged plane from the runway.

In 1965, Brian Robson attempted to mail himself in a crate on a flight from Melbourne, Australia to London. The flight was diverted to Los Angeles, where he was discovered after four days in the crate. In one reported case, in 2003, a young man mailed himself in a large box and had it shipped on UPS planes from New York City to Texas. He survived because the box travelled in a pressurized hold of an aircraft.

From 1947 until September 2012, there were 96 known stowaway attempts worldwide in wheel wells of 85 separate flights, which resulted in 73 deaths with only 23 survivors.

On November 26, 2024, a passenger without a boarding pass bypassed all security protocols and managed to stow aboard a flight from New York JFK airport to Paris. She hid in the airplane lavatory aboard the plane to avoid getting caught.

== Legal consequences ==
Stowaways may risk being fined or imprisoned, since it is illegal in most jurisdictions to embark on aircraft, boats or trains as stowaways. Airports, sea ports and train stations are typically marked as &quot;no trespassing&quot; or &quot;private property&quot; zones to anyone but customers and employees. Seaports, train stations, and airports often attempt further security by designating restricted areas with signs saying &quot;Authorized Personnel Only&quot;.

Since the September 11 attacks, it has become more difficult to be a stowaway on board transportation arriving to or departing from the United States. Airport security has dramatically increased, and among the new security measures is trained professionals watching over the fences from which stowaways usually gain entrance to an airport&#x27;s runway.

<text>Pixo was a company that developed infrastructure for hand-held devices. It was founded in 1994 when Paul Mercer, a software developer at Apple, left to form his own company. The company developed a system software toolkit in C++ for use on cell phones and other hand-held devices. Pixo was acquired by Sun Microsystems in 2003, and Sun was in turn acquired by Oracle Corporation in 2010.

==Pixo OS and use in Apple&#x27;s iPod==
In 2001, Pixo was rehired by Apple to adapt their system software for use in the iPod. The use of the Pixo OS in the iPod was never formally announced, although the first-generation iPod&#x27;s &quot;About iPod&quot; display includes a mention of Pixo, and a Connectix biography of their VP of engineering Mike Neil mentions his role as &quot;lead architect on the Pixo OS that is used in ... the Apple iPod&quot;. Apple acquired the Pixo OS shortly after shipping the iPod and removed mention of Pixo from the &quot;About iPod&quot; display with a firmware update to the first-generation iPod.

On April 9, 2007, Apple CEO Steve Jobs announced the shipment of its 100 millionth iPod, making the Pixo OS one of the most widely used embedded operating systems.

With the 2014 discontinuation of the iPod Classic
and the 2017 discontinuation of the iPod Nano, which did not run
iOS, Apple no longer sells a Pixo-based iPod.

<doc id="254091" wikidata="Q449670" url="?curid=254091" title="James Russell Lowell">
<text>James Russell Lowell (; February 22, 1819 – August 12, 1891) was an American Romantic poet, critic, editor, and diplomat. He is associated with the fireside poets, a group of New England writers who were among the first American poets that rivaled the popularity of British poets. These writers usually used conventional forms and meters in their poetry, making them suitable for families entertaining at their fireside.

Lowell graduated from Harvard College in 1838, despite his reputation as a troublemaker, and went on to earn a law degree from Harvard Law School. He published his first collection of poetry in 1841 and married Maria White in 1844. The couple had several children, though only one survived past childhood.

He became involved in the movement to abolish slavery. Lowell used poetry to express his anti-slavery views and took a job in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, as the editor of an abolitionist newspaper. After moving back to Cambridge, Lowell was one of the founders of a journal called &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, which lasted only three issues. He gained notoriety in 1848 with the publication of &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;, a book-length poem satirizing contemporary critics and poets. The same year, he published &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, which increased his fame. He went on to publish several other poetry collections and essay collections throughout his literary career.

Maria died in 1853, and Lowell accepted a professorship of languages at Harvard in 1854. He traveled to Europe before officially assuming his teaching duties in 1856, and married Frances Dunlap shortly thereafter in 1857. That year, Lowell also became editor of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;. He continued to teach at Harvard for twenty years.

He received his first political appointment, the ambassadorship to the Kingdom of Spain 20 years later. He was later appointed ambassador to the Court of St. James&#x27;s. He spent his last years in Cambridge in the same estate where he was born, and died there in 1891.

Lowell believed that the poet played an important role as a prophet and critic of society. He used poetry for reform, particularly in abolitionism. However, his commitment to the anti-slavery cause wavered over the years, as did his opinion on African-Americans. He attempted to emulate the true Yankee accent in the dialogue of his characters, particularly in &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;. This depiction of the dialect, as well as his many satires, was an inspiration to writers such as Mark Twain and H. L. Mencken.

==Biography==

===Early life===

James Russell Lowell was born February 22, 1819. He was a member of the eighth generation of the Lowell family, the descendants of Percival Lowle who settled in Newbury, Massachusetts, in 1639. His parents were the Reverend Charles Lowell (1782–1861), a minister at a Unitarian church in Boston who had previously studied theology at Edinburgh, and Harriett Brackett Spence Lowell. By the time that James was born, the family owned a large estate in Cambridge called Elmwood. He was the youngest of six children; his siblings were Charles, Rebecca, Mary, William, and Robert. Lowell&#x27;s mother built in him an appreciation for literature at an early age, especially in poetry, ballads, and tales from her native Orkney. He attended school under Sophia Dana, who later married George Ripley; he later studied at a school run by a particularly harsh disciplinarian, where one of his classmates was Richard Henry Dana Jr.

Lowell attended Harvard College beginning at age 15 in 1834, though he was not a good student and often got into trouble. In his sophomore year, he was absent from required chapel attendance 14 times and from classes 56 times. In his last year there, he wrote, &quot;During Freshman year, I did nothing, during Sophomore year I did nothing, during Junior year I did nothing, and during Senior year I have thus far done nothing in the way of college studies.&quot; In his senior year, he became one of the editors of &quot;Harvardiana&quot;, a literary magazine, to which he contributed prose and poetry that he admitted was of low quality. As he said later, &quot;I was as great an ass as ever brayed &amp; thought it singing.&quot; During his undergraduate years, Lowell was a member of Hasty Pudding and served both as secretary and poet. While at Harvard, he became lifelong friends with fellow troublemaker George W. Minns.

Lowell was elected the poet of the class of 1838 and, as was tradition, was asked to recite an original poem on Class Day, the day before Commencement on July 17, 1838. He was suspended, however, and not allowed to participate. Instead, his poem was printed and made available thanks to subscriptions paid by his classmates. He had composed the poem in Concord, where he had been exiled by the Harvard faculty to the care of the Rev. Barzallai Frost because of his neglect of his studies. During his stay in Concord, he became friends with Ralph Waldo Emerson and got to know the other Transcendentalists. His Class Day poem satirized the social movements of the day; abolitionists, Thomas Carlyle, Emerson, and the Transcendentalists were treated.

Lowell did not know what vocation to choose after graduating, and he vacillated among business, the ministry, medicine, and law. He ultimately enrolled at Harvard Law School in 1840 and was admitted to the bar two years later. While studying law, however, he contributed poems and prose articles to various magazines. During this time, he was admittedly depressed and often had suicidal thoughts. He once confided to a friend that he held a cocked pistol to his forehead and considered killing himself at the age of 20.

===Marriage and family===
In late 1839, Lowell met Maria White through her brother William, a classmate at Harvard, and the two became engaged in the autumn of 1840. Maria&#x27;s father Abijah White, a wealthy merchant from Watertown, insisted that their wedding be postponed until Lowell had gainful employment. They were finally married on December 26, 1844, shortly after the groom published &quot;Conversations on Some of the Old Poets&quot;, a collection of his previously published essays. A friend described their relationship as &quot;the very picture of a True Marriage&quot;. Lowell himself believed that she was made up &quot;half of earth and more than half of Heaven&quot;. She, too, wrote poetry, and the next twelve years of Lowell&#x27;s life were deeply affected by her influence. He said that his first book of poetry &quot;A Year&#x27;s Life&quot; (1841) &quot;owes all its beauty to her&quot;, though it only sold 300 copies.

Maria&#x27;s character and beliefs led her to become involved in the movements directed against intemperance and slavery. She was a member of the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and persuaded her husband to become an abolitionist. James had previously expressed antislavery sentiments, but Maria urged him towards more active expression and involvement. His second volume of poems &quot;Miscellaneous Poems&quot; expressed these antislavery thoughts, and its 1,500 copies sold well.

Maria was in poor health, and the couple moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage, thinking that her lungs could heal there. In Philadelphia, he became a contributing editor for the &quot;Pennsylvania Freeman&quot;, an abolitionist newspaper. In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to Cambridge to make their home at Elmwood. They had four children, though only one (Mabel, born 1847) survived past infancy. Blanche was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son Walter was born in 1850 but died in 1852. Lowell was very affected by the loss of almost all of his children. His grief over the death of his first daughter in particular was expressed in his poem &quot;&quot; (1847). He again considered suicide, writing to a friend that he thought &quot;of my razors and my throat and that I am a fool and a coward not to end it all at once&quot;.

===Literary career===
Lowell&#x27;s earliest poems were published without remuneration in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; in 1840. He was inspired to new efforts towards self-support and joined with his friend Robert Carter in founding the literary journal &quot;The Pioneer&quot;. The periodical was distinguished by the fact that most of its content was new rather than material that had been previously published elsewhere, and by the inclusion of very serious criticism, which covered not only literature but also art and music. Lowell wrote that it would &quot;furnish the intelligent and reflecting portion of the Reading Public with a rational substitute for the enormous quantity of thrice-diluted trash, in the shape of namby-pamby love tales and sketches, which is monthly poured out to them by many of our popular Magazines.&quot; William Wetmore Story noted the journal&#x27;s higher taste, writing that &quot;it took some stand &amp; appealled to a higher intellectual Standard than our milk or watery namby-pamby Mags with which we are overrun&quot;. The first issue of the journal included the first appearance of &quot;The Tell-Tale Heart&quot; by Edgar Allan Poe. Lowell was treated for an eye disease in New York shortly after the first issue, and in his absence Carter did a poor job of managing the journal. The magazine ceased publication after three monthly numbers beginning in January 1843, leaving Lowell $1,800 (~$ in ) in debt. Poe mourned the journal&#x27;s demise, calling it &quot;a most severe blow to the cause—the cause of a Pure Taste&quot;.

Despite the failure of &quot;The Pioneer&quot;, Lowell continued his interest in the literary world. He contributed a poem to &quot;The Token and Atlantic Souvenir&quot; annual gift book in 1842 and a series on &quot;Anti-Slavery in the United States&quot; for the &quot;Daily News&quot;, though his series was discontinued by the editors after four articles in May 1846. He had published these articles anonymously, believing that they would have more impact if they were not known to be the work of a committed abolitionist. In the spring of 1848, he formed a connection with the &quot;National Anti-Slavery Standard of New York&quot;, agreeing to contribute weekly either a poem or a prose article. After only one year, he was asked to contribute half as often to the &quot;Standard&quot; to make room for contributions from Edmund Quincy, another writer and reformer.
&quot;A Fable for Critics&quot; was one of Lowell&#x27;s most popular works, published anonymously in 1848. It proved a popular satire, and the first 3,000 copies sold out quickly. In it, he took good-natured jabs at his contemporary poets and critics—but not all the subjects were pleased. Edgar Allan Poe was referred to as part genius and &quot;two-fifths sheer fudge&quot;; he reviewed the work in the &quot;Southern Literary Messenger&quot; and called it &quot;&#x27;loose&#x27;—ill-conceived and feebly executed, as well in detail as in general ... we confess some surprise at his putting forth so unpolished a performance.&quot; Lowell offered his New York friend Charles Frederick Briggs all the profits from the book&#x27;s success (which proved relatively small), despite his own financial needs.

In 1848, Lowell also published &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, later named by the Grolier Club as the most influential book of 1848. The first 1,500 copies sold out within a week and a second edition was soon issued—though Lowell made no profit, as he had to absorb the cost of stereotyping the book himself. The book presented three main characters, each representing different aspects of American life and using authentic American dialects in their dialogue. Under the surface, &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot; was also a denunciation of the Mexican–American War and war in general.

===First trip to Europe===
In 1850, Lowell&#x27;s mother died unexpectedly, as did his third daughter, Rose. Her death left Lowell depressed and reclusive for six months, despite the birth of his son Walter by the end of the year. He wrote to a friend that death &quot;is a private tutor. We have no fellow-scholars, and must lay our lessons to heart alone.&quot; These personal troubles as well as the Compromise of 1850 inspired Lowell to accept an offer from William Wetmore Story to spend a winter in Italy. To pay for the trip, Lowell sold land around Elmwood, intending to sell off further acres of the estate over time to supplement his income, ultimately selling off 25 of the original . Walter died suddenly in Rome of cholera, and Lowell and his wife, with their daughter Mabel, returned to the United States in October 1852. Lowell published recollections of his journey in several magazines, many of which would be collected years later as &quot;Fireside Travels&quot; (1867). He also edited volumes with biographical sketches for a series on &quot;British Poets&quot;.

His wife Maria, who had been suffering from poor health for many years, became very ill in the spring of 1853 and died on October 27 of tuberculosis. Just before her burial, her coffin was opened so that her daughter Mabel could see her face while Lowell &quot;leaned for a long while against a tree weeping&quot;, according to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow and his wife, who were in attendance. In 1855, Lowell oversaw the publication of a memorial volume of his wife&#x27;s poetry, with only fifty copies for private circulation. Despite his self-described &quot;naturally joyous&quot; nature, life for Lowell at Elmwood was further complicated by his father becoming deaf in his old age, and the deteriorating mental state of his sister Rebecca, who sometimes went a week without speaking. He again cut himself off from others, becoming reclusive at Elmwood, and his private diaries from this time period are riddled with the initials of his wife. On March 10, 1854, for example, he wrote: &quot;Dark without &amp; within. M.L. M.L. M.L.&quot; Longfellow, a friend and neighbor, referred to Lowell as &quot;lonely and desolate&quot;.

===Professorship and second marriage===
At the invitation of his cousin John Amory Lowell, James Russell Lowell was asked to deliver a lecture at the prestigious Lowell Institute. Some speculated the opportunity was because of the family connection, offered as an attempt to bring him out of his depression. Lowell chose to speak on &quot;The English Poets&quot;, telling his friend Briggs that he would take revenge on dead poets &quot;for the injuries received by one whom the public won&#x27;t allow among the living&quot;. The first of the twelve-part lecture series was to be on January 9, 1855, though by December, Lowell had only completed writing five of them, hoping for last-minute inspiration. His first lecture was on John Milton and the auditorium was oversold; Lowell had to give a repeat performance the next afternoon. Lowell, who had never spoken in public before, was praised for these lectures. Francis James Child said that Lowell, whom he deemed was typically &quot;perverse&quot;, was able to &quot;persist in being serious contrary to his impulses and his talents&quot;. While his series was still in progress, Lowell was offered the Smith Professorship of Modern Languages at Harvard, a post vacated by Longfellow, at an annual salary of $1,200, though he never applied for it. The job description was changing after Longfellow; instead of teaching languages directly, Lowell would supervise the department and deliver two lecture courses per year on topics of his own choosing. Lowell accepted the appointment, with the proviso that he should have a year of study abroad. He set sail on June 4 of that year, leaving his daughter Mabel in the care of a governess named Frances Dunlap. Abroad, he visited Le Havre, Paris, and London, spending time with friends including Story, Robert Browning and Elizabeth Barrett Browning, and Leigh Hunt. Primarily, however, Lowell spent his time abroad studying languages, particularly German, which he found difficult. He complained: &quot;The confounding genders! If I die I shall have engraved on my tombstone that I died of &quot;der, die, das&quot;, not because I caught them but because I couldn&#x27;t.&quot;

He returned to the United States in the summer of 1856 and began his college duties. Towards the end of his professorship, then-president of Harvard Charles William Eliot noted that Lowell seemed to have &quot;no natural inclination&quot; to teach; Lowell agreed, but retained his position for twenty years. He focused on teaching literature, rather than etymology, hoping that his students would learn to enjoy the sound, rhythm, and flow of poetry rather than the technique of words. He summed up his method: &quot;True scholarship consists in knowing not what things exists, but what they mean; it is not memory but judgment.&quot; Still grieving the loss of his wife, during this time Lowell avoided Elmwood and instead lived on Kirkland Street in Cambridge, an area known as Professors&#x27; Row. He stayed there, along with his daughter Mabel and her governess Frances Dunlap, until January 1861.

Lowell had intended never to remarry after the death of his wife Maria White. However, in 1857, surprising his friends, he became engaged to Frances Dunlap, whom many described as simple and unattractive. Dunlap, niece of the former governor of Maine Robert P. Dunlap, was a friend of Lowell&#x27;s first wife and formerly wealthy, though she and her family had fallen into reduced circumstances. Lowell and Dunlap married on September 16, 1857, in a ceremony performed by his brother. Lowell wrote, &quot;My second marriage was the wisest act of my life, &amp; as long as &quot;I&quot; am sure of it, I can afford to wait till my friends agree with me.&quot;

===War years and beyond===

In the autumn of 1857, &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; was established, and Lowell was its first editor. With its first issue in November of that year, he at once gave the magazine the stamp of high literature and of bold speech on public affairs. In January 1861, Lowell&#x27;s father died of a heart attack, inspiring Lowell to move his family back to Elmwood. As he wrote to his friend Briggs, &quot;I am back again to the place I love best. I am sitting in my old garret, at my old desk, smoking my old pipe ... I begin to feel more like my old self than I have these ten years.&quot; Shortly thereafter, in May, he left &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; when James T. Fields took over as editor; the magazine had been purchased by Ticknor and Fields for $10,000 two years before. Lowell returned to Elmwood by January 1861 but maintained an amicable relationship with the new owners of the journal, continuing to submit his poetry and prose for the rest of his life. His prose, however, was more abundantly presented in the pages of the &quot;North American Review&quot; during the years 1862–1872. For the &quot;Review&quot;, he served as a coeditor along with Charles Eliot Norton. Lowell&#x27;s reviews for the journal covered a wide variety of literary releases of the day, though he was writing fewer poems. One essay of his for the &quot;North American Review&quot;, an acerbic review of the life and work of the recently deceased Henry David Thoreau titled &quot;Letters to Various Persons,&quot; contributed to a decades-long critical consensus of disdain for Thoreau.

As early as 1845, Lowell had predicted the debate over slavery would lead to war and, as the Civil War broke out in the 1860s, Lowell used his role at the &quot;Review&quot; to praise Abraham Lincoln and his attempts to maintain the Union. Lowell lost three nephews during the war, including Charles Russell Lowell Jr., who became a brigadier general and fell at the Battle of Cedar Creek. Lowell himself was generally a pacifist. Even so, he wrote, &quot;If the destruction of slavery is to be a consequence of the war, shall we regret it? If it be needful to the successful prosecution of the war, shall anyone oppose it?&quot; His interest in the Civil War inspired him to write a second series of &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, including one specifically dedicated to the preliminary Emancipation Proclamation called &quot;Sunthin&#x27; in the Pastoral Line&quot; in 1862.

Shortly after Lincoln&#x27;s assassination, Lowell was asked to present a poem at Harvard in memory of graduates killed in the war. His poem, &quot;Commemoration Ode&quot;, cost him sleep and his appetite, but was delivered on July 21, 1865, after a 48-hour writing binge. Lowell had high hopes for his performance but was overshadowed by the other notables presenting works that day, including Ralph Waldo Emerson and Oliver Wendell Holmes. &quot;I did not make the hit I expected&quot;, he wrote, &quot;and am ashamed at having been tempted again to think I could write &quot;poetry&quot;, a delusion from which I have been tolerably free these dozen years.&quot; Despite his personal assessment, friends and other poets sent many letters to Lowell congratulating him. Emerson referred to his poem&#x27;s &quot;high thought &amp; sentiment&quot; and James Freeman Clarke noted its &quot;grandeur of tone&quot;. Lowell later expanded it with a strophe to Lincoln.

In the 1860s, Lowell&#x27;s friend Longfellow spent several years translating Dante Alighieri&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot; and regularly invited others to help him on Wednesday evenings. Lowell was one of the main members of the so-called &quot;Dante Club&quot;, along with William Dean Howells, Charles Eliot Norton and other occasional guests. Shortly after serving as a pallbearer at the funeral of friend and publisher Nathaniel Parker Willis on January 24, 1867, Lowell decided to produce another collection of his poetry. &quot;Under the Willows and Other Poems&quot; was released in 1869, though Lowell originally wanted to title it &quot;The Voyage to the Vinland and Other Poems&quot;. The book, dedicated to Norton, collected poems Lowell had written within the previous twenty years and was his first poetry collection since 1848.

Lowell intended to take another trip to Europe. To finance it, he sold off more of Elmwood&#x27;s acres and rented the house to Thomas Bailey Aldrich; Lowell&#x27;s daughter Mabel, by this time, had moved into a new home with her husband Edward Burnett, the son of a successful businessman-farmer from Southborough, Massachusetts. Lowell and his wife set sail on July 8, 1872, after he took a leave of absence from Harvard. They visited England, Paris, Switzerland, and Italy. While overseas, he received an honorary Doctorate of Law from the University of Oxford and another from Cambridge University. They returned to the United States in the summer of 1874.

===Political appointments===

Lowell resigned from his Harvard professorship in 1874, though he was persuaded to continue teaching through 1877. It was in 1876 that Lowell first stepped into the field of politics. That year, he served as a delegate to the Republican National Convention in Cincinnati, Ohio, speaking on behalf of presidential candidate Rutherford B. Hayes. Hayes won the nomination and, eventually, the presidency. In May 1877, President Hayes, an admirer of &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, sent William Dean Howells to Lowell with a handwritten note proffering an ambassadorship to either Austria or Russia; Lowell declined, but noted his interest in Spanish literature. Lowell was then offered and accepted the role of Minister to the court of Spain at an annual salary of $12,000. Lowell sailed from Boston on July 14, 1877, and, though he expected he would be away for a year or two, did not return to the United States until 1885, with the violinist Ole Bull renting Elmwood for a portion of that time. The Spanish media referred to him as &quot;José Bighlow&quot;. Lowell was well-prepared for his political role, having been trained in law, as well as being able to read in multiple languages. He had trouble socializing while in Spain, however, and amused himself by sending humorous dispatches to his political bosses in the United States, many of which were later collected and published posthumously in 1899 as &quot;Impressions of Spain&quot;. Lowell&#x27;s social life improved when the Spanish Academy elected him a corresponding member in late 1878, allowing him contribute to the preparation of a new dictionary.

In January 1880, Lowell was informed of his appointment as Minister to England, his nomination made without his knowledge as far back as June 1879. He was granted a salary of $17,500 with about $3,500 for expenses. While serving in this capacity, he addressed an importation of allegedly diseased cattle and made recommendations that predated the Pure Food and Drug Act. Queen Victoria commented that she had never seen an ambassador who &quot;created so much interest and won so much regard as Mr. Lowell&quot;. Lowell held this role until the close of Chester A. Arthur&#x27;s presidency in the spring of 1885, despite his wife&#x27;s failing health. Lowell was already well known in England for his writing and, during his time there, befriended fellow author Henry James, who referred to him as &quot;conspicuously American&quot;. Lowell also befriended Leslie Stephen many years earlier and became the godfather to his daughter, future writer Virginia Woolf. Lowell was popular enough that he was offered a professorship at Oxford after his recall by President Grover Cleveland, though the offer was declined. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1883.

His second wife, Frances, died on February 19, 1885, while still in England.

===Later years and death===

He returned to the United States by June 1885, living with his daughter and her husband in Southboro, Massachusetts. He then spent time in Boston with his sister before returning to Elmwood in November 1889. By this time, most of his friends were dead, including Quincy, Longfellow, Dana, and Emerson, leaving him depressed and contemplating suicide again. Lowell spent part of the 1880s delivering various speeches, and his last published works were mostly collections of essays, including &quot;Political Essays&quot;, and a collection of his poems &quot;Heartsease and Rue&quot; in 1888. His last few years he traveled back to England periodically and when he returned to the United States in the fall of 1889, he moved back to Elmwood with Mabel, while her husband worked for clients in New York and New Jersey. That year, Lowell gave an address at the centenary of George Washington&#x27;s inauguration. Also that year, the Boston &quot;Critic&quot; dedicated a special issue to Lowell on his seventieth birthday to recollections and reminiscences by his friends, including former presidents Hayes and Benjamin Harrison and British Prime Minister William Ewart Gladstone as well as Alfred, Lord Tennyson and Francis Parkman.

In the last few months of his life, Lowell struggled with gout, sciatica in his left leg, and chronic nausea; by the summer of 1891, doctors believed that Lowell had cancer in his kidneys, liver, and lungs. His last few months, he was administered opium for the pain and was rarely fully conscious. He died on August 12, 1891, at Elmwood. After services in the Appleton Chapel, he was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery. After his death, Norton served as his literary executor and published several collections of Lowell&#x27;s works and his letters.

==Writing style and literary theory==

Early in his career, James Russell Lowell&#x27;s writing was influenced by Swedenborgianism, a Spiritualism-infused form of Christianity founded by Emanuel Swedenborg, causing Frances Longfellow (wife of the poet Henry Wadsworth Longfellow) to mention that &quot;he has been long in the habit of seeing spirits&quot;. He composed his poetry rapidly when inspired by an &quot;inner light&quot; but could not write to order. He subscribed to the common nineteenth-century belief that the poet was a prophet but went further, linking religion, nature, and poetry, as well as social reform. Evert Augustus Duyckinck and others welcomed Lowell as part of Young America, a New York-based movement. Though not officially affiliated with them, he shared some of their ideals, including the belief that writers have an inherent insight into the moral nature of humanity and have an obligation for literary action along with their aesthetic function. Unlike many of his contemporaries, including members of Young America, Lowell did not advocate for the creation of a new national literature. Instead, he called for a &quot;natural&quot; literature, regardless of country, caste, or race, and warned against provincialism which might &quot;put farther off the hope of one great brotherhood&quot;. He agreed with his neighbor Longfellow that &quot;whoever is most universal, is also most national&quot;. As Lowell said:

A scholar of linguistics, Lowell was one of the founders of the American Dialect Society. He applied this passion to some of his writings, most famously in &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, in which he presents an early 19th-century rural Yankee dialect, complete with nonstandard local grammar and quasi-phonetic spelling—a literary method called eye dialect. In using this vernacular, Lowell intended to get closer to the common man&#x27;s experience and was rebelling against more formal and, as he thought, unnatural representations of Americans in literature. As he wrote in his introduction to &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot;, &quot;few American writers or speakers wield their native language with the directness, precision, and force that are common as the day in the mother country&quot; (i.e. England). Though intentionally humorous, this precise representation of an early New England dialect was pioneering work within American literature. For example, Lowell&#x27;s character Hosea Biglow says in verse:

Lowell is considered one of the fireside poets, a group of writers from New England in the 1840s who all had a substantial national following and whose work was often read aloud by the family fireplace. Besides Lowell, the main figures from this group were Longfellow, Holmes, John Greenleaf Whittier, and William Cullen Bryant.

==Beliefs==
Lowell was an abolitionist, but his opinions wavered concerning African-Americans. He advocated suffrage for blacks, yet he noted that their ability to vote could be troublesome. Even so, he wrote, &quot;We believe the white race, by their intellectual and traditional superiority, will retain sufficient ascendancy to prevent any serious mischief from the new order of things.&quot; Freed slaves, he wrote, were &quot;dirty, lazy &amp; lying&quot;. Even before his marriage to abolitionist Maria White, Lowell wrote: &quot;The abolitionists are the only ones with whom I sympathize of the present extant parties.&quot; After his marriage, Lowell at first did not share his wife&#x27;s enthusiasm for the cause, but he was eventually pulled in. The couple often gave money to fugitive slaves, even when their own financial situation was not strong, especially if they were asked to free a spouse or child. Even so, he did not always fully agree with the followers of the movement. The majority of these people, he said, &quot;treat ideas as ignorant persons do cherries. They think them unwholesome unless they are swallowed, stones and all.&quot; Lowell depicted Southerners very unfavorably in his second collection of &quot;The Biglow Papers&quot; but, by 1865, admitted that Southerners were &quot;guilty only of weakness&quot; and, by 1868, said that he sympathized with Southerners and their viewpoint on slavery. Enemies and friends of Lowell alike questioned his vacillating interest in the question of slavery. Abolitionist Samuel Joseph May accused him of trying to quit the movement because of his association with Harvard and the Boston Brahmin culture: &quot;Having got into the smooth, dignified, self-complacent, and change-hating society of the college and its Boston circles, Lowell has gone over to the world, and to &#x27;respectability&#x27;.&quot;

Lowell was also involved in other reform movements. He urged better conditions for factory workers, opposed capital punishment, and supported the temperance movement. His friend Longfellow was especially concerned about his fanaticism for temperance, worrying that Lowell would ask him to destroy his wine cellar. There are many references to Lowell&#x27;s drinking during his college years, and part of his reputation in school was based on it. His friend Edward Everett Hale denied these allegations. Lowell considered joining the &quot;Anti-Wine&quot; club at Harvard, and he became a teetotaler during the early years of his first marriage. However, as he gained notoriety, he became popular in social circles and clubs and he drank rather heavily when away from his wife. When he drank, he had wild mood swings, ranging from euphoria to frenzy.

==Criticism and legacy==
In 1849, Lowell said of himself, &quot;I am the first poet who has endeavored to express the American Idea, and I shall be popular by and by.&quot; Poet Walt Whitman said: &quot;Lowell was not a grower—he was a builder. He &quot;built&quot; poems: he didn&#x27;t put in the seed, and water the seed, and send down his sun—letting the rest take care of itself: he measured his poems—kept them within formula.&quot; Fellow fireside poet John Greenleaf Whittier praised Lowell by writing two poems in his honor and calling him &quot;our new Theocritus&quot; and &quot;one of the strongest and manliest of our writers–a republican poet who dares to speak brave words of unpopular truth&quot;. British author Thomas Hughes referred to Lowell as one of the most important writers in the United States: &quot;Greece had her Aristophanes; Rome her Juvenal; Spain has had her Cervantes; France her Rabelais, her Molière, her Voltaire; Germany her Jean Paul, her Heine; England her Swift, her Thackeray; and America has her Lowell.&quot; Lowell&#x27;s satires and use of dialect were an inspiration for writers like Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, H. L. Mencken, and Ring Lardner.

Contemporary critic and editor Margaret Fuller wrote, &quot;his verse is stereotyped; his thought sounds no depth, and posterity will not remember him.&quot; Evert Augustus Duyckinck thought Lowell was too similar to other poets like William Shakespeare and John Milton. Ralph Waldo Emerson noted that, though Lowell had significant technical skill, his poetry &quot;rather expresses his wish, his ambition, than the uncontrollable interior impulse which is the authentic mark of a new poem ... and which is felt in the pervading tone, rather than in brilliant parts or lines.&quot; Even his friend Richard Henry Dana Jr. questioned Lowell&#x27;s abilities, calling him &quot;very clever, entertaining &amp; good humored ... but he is rather a trifler, after all.&quot; In the twentieth century, poet Richard Armour dismissed Lowell, writing: &quot;As a Harvard graduate and an editor for the &quot;Atlantic Monthly&quot;, it must have been difficult for Lowell to write like an illiterate oaf, but he succeeded.&quot; The poet Amy Lowell featured her relative James Russell Lowell in her poem &quot;A Critical Fable&quot; (1922), the title mocking &quot;A Fable for Critics&quot;. Here, a fictional version of Lowell says he does not believe that women will ever be equal to men in the arts and &quot;the two sexes cannot be ranked counterparts&quot;. Modern literary critic Van Wyck Brooks wrote that Lowell&#x27;s poetry was forgettable: &quot;one read them five times over and still forgot them, as if this excellent verse had been written in water.&quot; His &quot;The Vision of Sir Launfal&quot; (1848), was called &quot;one of the worst constructed poems written in English&quot; and &quot;the most disorganized poem ever written&quot;. Nonetheless, in 1969 the Modern Language Association established a prize named after Lowell, awarded annually for &quot;an outstanding literary or linguistic study, a critical edition of an important work, or a critical biography.&quot;

Lowell&#x27;s poem &quot;The Present Crisis&quot;, an early work that addressed the national crisis over slavery leading up to the Civil War, has had an impact in the modern civil rights movement. The National Association for the Advancement of Colored People named its newsletter &quot;The Crisis&quot; after the poem, and Martin Luther King Jr. frequently quoted the poem in his speeches and sermons. The poem was also the source of the hymn &quot;Once to Every Man and Nation&quot;. American composer Emily Bruce Roelofson used Lowell&#x27;s text in her song &quot;From the Close Shut Window&quot;.

<text>Regent&#x27;s Park (officially The Regent&#x27;s Park) is one of the Royal Parks of London. It occupies in north-west Inner London, administratively split between the City of Westminster and the Borough of Camden (and historically between Marylebone and Saint Pancras parishes). In addition to its large central parkland and ornamental lake, it contains various structures and organizations both public and private, generally on its periphery, including Regent&#x27;s University and London Zoo.

What is now Regent&#x27;s Park came into possession of the Crown upon the dissolution of the monasteries in the 1500s, and was used for hunting and tenant farming. In the 1810s, the Prince Regent proposed turning it into a pleasure garden. The park was designed by John Nash and James and Decimus Burton. Its construction was financed privately by James Burton after the Crown Estate rescinded its pledge to do so, and included development on the periphery of townhouses and expensive terrace dwellings. The park is Grade I listed on the Register of Historic Parks and Gardens.

==Description==

The park has an outer ring road called the Outer Circle (4.45 km) and an inner ring road called the Inner Circle (1 km), which surrounds the most carefully tended section of the park, Queen Mary&#x27;s Gardens. Apart from two link roads between these two, the park is reserved for pedestrians (with the exception of The Broad Walk between Chester Road and the Outer Circle, which is a shared use path). The south, east and most of the west side of the park are lined with elegant white stucco terraces of houses designed by John Nash and Decimus Burton. Running through the northern end of the park is Regent&#x27;s Canal, which connects the Grand Union Canal to London&#x27;s historic docks.
The park is mainly open parkland with a wide range of facilities and amenities, including gardens; a lake with a heronry, waterfowl and a boating area; sports pitches; and children&#x27;s playgrounds. The northern side of the park is the home of London Zoo and the headquarters of the Zoological Society of London. There are several public gardens with flowers and specimen plants, including Queen Mary&#x27;s Gardens in the Inner Circle, in which the Open Air Theatre stands; the formal Italian Gardens and adjacent informal English Gardens in the south-east corner of the park; and the gardens of St John&#x27;s Lodge. Winfield House, the official residence of the U.S. Ambassador to the United Kingdom, stands in private grounds in the western section of the park, near the capital&#x27;s first large mosque.

South of the Inner Circle is dominated by Regent&#x27;s University London, home of the European Business School London, Regent&#x27;s American College London (RACL) and Webster Graduate School among others.

Abutting the northern side of Regent&#x27;s Park is Primrose Hill, another park which, with a height of , has a clear view of central London to the south-east, as well as Belsize Park and Hampstead to the north. Primrose Hill is also the name given to the immediately surrounding district.

==Management==
The public areas of Regent&#x27;s Park are managed by The Royal Parks, a charity. The Crown Estate Paving Commission is responsible for managing certain aspects of the built environment of Regent&#x27;s Park. The park lies within the boundaries of the City of Westminster and the London Borough of Camden, but those authorities have only peripheral input to the management of the park. The Crown Estate owns the freehold of Regent&#x27;s Park.

==History==
In the Middle Ages the land was part of the manor of Tyburn, acquired by Barking Abbey. The 1530s Dissolution of the Monasteries meant Henry VIII appropriated it, under that statutory forfeiture with minor compensation scheme. It has been state property since. It was set aside as a hunting and forestry park, Marylebone Park, from that Dissolution until 1649 after which it was let as small-holdings for hay and dairy produce.

===Development by John Nash, James Burton, and Decimus Burton===
Although the park was initially the idea of the Prince Regent, and was named for him, James Burton, the pre-eminent London property developer, was responsible for the social and financial patronage of the majority of John Nash&#x27;s London designs, and for their construction. Architectural scholar Guy Williams has written, &quot;John Nash relied on James Burton for moral and financial support in his great enterprises. Decimus had showed precocious talent as a draughtsman and as an exponent of the classical style... John Nash needed the son&#x27;s aid, as well as the father&#x27;s&quot;. Subsequent to the Crown Estate&#x27;s refusal to finance them, James Burton agreed to personally finance the construction projects of John Nash at Regent&#x27;s Park, which he had already been commissioned to construct: consequently, in 1816, Burton purchased many of the leases of the proposed terraces around, and proposed villas within Regent&#x27;s Park, and, in 1817, Burton purchased the leases of five of the largest blocks on Regent Street. The first property to be constructed in or around Regent&#x27;s Park by Burton was his own mansion: The Holme, which was designed by his son, Decimus Burton, and completed in 1818. Burton&#x27;s extensive financial involvement &quot;effectively guaranteed the success of the project&quot;. In return, Nash agreed to promote the career of Decimus Burton. Such were James Burton&#x27;s contributions to the project that the Commissioners of Woods described James, not Nash, as &quot;the architect of Regent&#x27;s Park&quot;.

Contrary to popular belief, the dominant architectural influence in many of the Regent&#x27;s Park projects – including Cornwall Terrace, York Terrace, Chester Terrace, Clarence Terrace, and the villas of the Inner Circle, all of which were constructed by James Burton&#x27;s company – was Decimus Burton, not John Nash, who was appointed architectural &quot;overseer&quot; for Decimus&#x27;s projects. To the chagrin of Nash, Decimus largely disregarded his advice and developed the Terraces according to his own style, to the extent that Nash sought the demolition and complete rebuilding of Chester Terrace, but in vain. Decimus&#x27;s terraces were built by his father James.

The Regent&#x27;s Park scheme was integrated with other schemes built for the Prince Regent by the triplet of Nash, James Burton, and Decimus Burton: these included Regent Street and Carlton House Terrace in a grand sweep of town planning stretching from St. James&#x27;s Park to Primrose Hill. The scheme is considered one of the first examples of a garden suburb and continues to influence the design of suburbs. The park was first opened to the general public in 1835, initially two days a week. The 1831 diary of William Copeland Astbury describes in detail his daily walks in and around the park, with references to the Zoo, the canal, and surrounding streets, as well as features of daily life in the area.

===Subsequent history===
On 15 January 1867, forty people died when the ice cover on the boating lake collapsed and over 200 people plunged into the lake. The lake was subsequently drained and its depth reduced to four feet before being reopened to the public.

Late in 1916, the Home Postal Depot, Royal Engineers moved to a purpose-built wooden building (200,000 sq ft) on Chester Road, Regent&#x27;s Park. This new facility contained the depot&#x27;s administration offices, a large parcel office and a letter office, these last two previously being at the Mount Pleasant Mail Centre. HM King George V and HM Queen Mary visited the depot on 11 December 1916. The depot vacated the premises in early 1920.

Queen Mary&#x27;s Gardens, in the Inner Circle, were created in the 1930s, bringing that part of the park into use by the general public for the first time. The site had originally been used as a plant nursery and had later been leased to the Royal Botanic Society.

In July 1982, an IRA bomb was detonated at the bandstand, killing seven soldiers.

The sports pitches, which had been relaid with inadequate drainage after the Second World War, were relaid between 2002 and 2004, and in 2005 a new sports pavilion was constructed.

On 7 July 2006 the park held an event for people to remember the events of the 7 July 2005 London bombings. Members of the public placed mosaic tiles on to seven purple petals. Later bereaved family members laid yellow tiles in the centre to finish the mosaic.

==Sport==
Sports are played in the park including cycling, tennis, netball, athletics, cricket, softball, rounders, football, hockey, Australian rules football, rugby, ultimate Frisbee, and running. Belsize Park Rugby Football Club play their home games in the park.

There are three playgrounds and there is boating on the lake.

Sports take place in an area called the Northern Parkland, and are centred on the Hub. This pavilion and underground changing rooms was designed by David Morley Architects and Price &amp; Myers engineers, and opened by Queen Elizabeth II in 2005. It won the IStructE Award for Community or Residential Structures in 2006.

The Outer Circle is used by road cyclists. One circuit is 4.45 km. A number of amateur cycling clubs that meet regularly to complete laps of the Outer Circle for exercise and leisure. Prominent clubs include: Regent&#x27;s Park Rouleurs (RPR), London Baroudeurs (LBCC), Islington Cycling Club (ICC), Cycle Club London (CCL), Rapha Cycle Club (RCC). Many cyclists track &amp; log their rides using the online social network site Strava. As at January, 2018 – some 22,000 cyclists had completed &amp; logged 1.6mn laps of the park using the Strava app. In 2015, Regent&#x27;s Park Cyclists was formed to represent the interest of cyclists and cycling clubs that use the Inner &amp; Outer Circle.

The park was scheduled to play a role in the 2012 Summer Olympics, hosting the baseball and softball events, but these sports were dropped from the Olympic programme with effect from 2012. The Olympic cycling road race was supposed to go through Regent&#x27;s Park, as was the cycling road race in the 2012 Summer Paralympics, but the routes were changed.

==Terraces==

The neoclassical terraces are grand examples of the English townhouse. Sometimes they are collectively called the &quot;Nash terraces&quot;, but other architects contributed. Clockwise from the north, they are:
*Gloucester Gate: A terrace of 11 houses designed by Nash and built by Richard Mott in 1827.
*Cumberland Terrace: Designed by Nash and built by William Mountford Nurse in 1826.

==Villas==
Nine villas were initially built in the park. There follows a list of their names as shown on Christopher and John Greenwood&#x27;s map of London (second edition, 1830), with details of their subsequent fates:

===Close to the western and northern edges of the park===

*Hertford Villa (later known as St Dunstan&#x27;s): Damaged by fire. Rebuilt as Winfield House in the 1930s and now the American Ambassador&#x27;s residence, with the second-largest private garden in London after the King&#x27;s garden at Buckingham Palace.
*Nuffield Lodge: A private residence currently owned by the Oman royal family), and previously owned by Robert Holmes à Court. Nuffield Lodge is said to have one of the largest gardens in central London after Buckingham Palace and Winfield House. The garden runs along the edge of Regent&#x27;s Canal.
*Hanover Lodge: A private residence was the subject of a Court Case in the early 21st century (won by Westminster City Council against the architect, Quinlan Terry, and contractor, Walter Lilly &amp; Co) that ruled that two Grade II listed buildings on the property had been illegally demolished while the property was leased to Conservative peer Lord Bagri.
*Albany Cottage: Demolished. Site now occupied by London Central Mosque.
*Holford House (Stanford&#x27;s map of 1862): Built in 1832 north of Hertford House, it was the largest of the villas at that time. From 1856 it was occupied by Regent&#x27;s Park College (which subsequently moved to Oxford in 1927). In 1944 Holford House was destroyed by a bomb during World War II. Demolished in 1948.
*Between 1988 and 2004, six new villas were built by the Crown Estate and property developers at the north western edge of the park, between the Outer Circle and the Regent&#x27;s Canal. They were designed by the English Neo-Classical architect Quinlan Terry, who designed each house in a different classical style, intended to be representative of the variety of classical architecture, naming them the &quot;Veneto Villa&quot;, &quot;Doric Villa&quot;, &quot;Corinthian Villa&quot;, &quot;Ionic Villa&quot;, &quot;Gothick Villa&quot; and the &quot;Regency Villa&quot; respectively.

===Around the Inner Circle===


*St John&#x27;s Lodge: A private residence (Brunei royal family) but part of its garden, designed by Colvin and Moggridge Landscape Architects in 1994, is open to the public. St John&#x27;s Lodge was the first villa to be constructed in the park by John Raffield.
*The Holme: A private residence (Saudi royal family) but its garden is open several days a year via the National Gardens Scheme. It has been described as &#x27;one of the most desirable private homes in London&#x27; by architectural scholar Guy Williams, and as &#x27;a definition of Western civilization in a single view&#x27; by architectural critic Ian Nairn. The Holme was the second villa to be built in Regent&#x27;s Park.
*South Villa: Site of George Bishop&#x27;s Observatory, which closed when its owner died in 1861 (instruments and dome moved to Meadowbank, Twickenham in 1863). Regent&#x27;s University London now stands on the site, one of the two largest groups of buildings in the park, alongside London Zoo.
*Regent&#x27;s University London has its campus just southwest of the Inner Circle. Previously was home to Bedford College.

===Close to the eastern edge of the park===

*Sir Herbert Taylor&#x27;s Villa: Demolished. Site now part of open parkland. He was Master of St Katherine&#x27;s Hospital when it was based at Regent&#x27;s Park.
*International Students House, London
*The Diorama, 18 Park Square East, opened in 1823, closed 1852. A forerunner of the cinema.

<text>Major David John Croft (born David John Andrew Sharland; 7 September 1922 – 27 September 2011) was an English television comedy screenwriter, producer and director. He produced and wrote a string of BBC sitcoms with partners Jimmy Perry and Jeremy Lloyd, including &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot;, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot;

==Early life==
Croft was born into a show business family: his father, Reginald Sharland (1886–1944), had a successful career as a radio actor in Hollywood, and his mother, Annie Croft (1896–1959), was a famous stage actress who had starred in the 1927 silent film &quot;On With The Dance,&quot; she was also the first woman to own a West End theatre company. His first public appearance was at the age of seven, when he was seen in a commercial which aired in cinemas. After that, his acting career in films &quot;began and ended&quot; with his uncredited appearance as Perkins in the film &quot;Goodbye, Mr. Chips&quot; (1939).

The family lived in Poole, Dorset. Nearby is St Aldhelm&#x27;s Church, Poole and Croft later gave that name to the church in Dad&#x27;s Army. He was educated at two [independent] schools: at St John&#x27;s Wood prep school in North London, followed by Rugby School in Warwickshire.

==Military service==
He enlisted in the Royal Artillery in 1942. He served during the Second World War in North Africa, India and Singapore. After contracting rheumatic fever in North Africa, was sent home to convalesce and then underwent officer training at the Royal Military College, Sandhurst.

Croft was posted to India, arriving as the war in Europe ended, and was assigned to the Essex Regiment, rising to the rank of Major. When his military service ended he began working in the entertainment industry, as an actor, singer and writer.
==Career==
Croft met Freddie Carpenter, who produced many pantomimes for Howard &amp; Wyndham across the UK, resulting in Croft writing scripts such as &quot;Aladdin&quot;, &quot;Cinderella&quot; and &quot;Babes in the Wood&quot;. Through his lifelong friend, composer/conductor Cyril Ornadel, Croft met the producer Fiona Bentley, who had obtained rights to adapt and musicalise a number of Beatrix Potter stories. Croft wrote the scripts and lyrics for a series released on the Children&#x27;s Record Company, a label of EMI, narrated by Vivien Leigh and starring several singer-actors and actresses including Barbara Brown, Graham Stark and Cicely Courtneidge. David Croft himself played a number of roles, including Timmy Willie in &quot;Johnny Town-Mouse&quot;, Kep in &quot;Jemima Puddle-Duck&quot;, and Old Brown in &quot;Squirrel Nutkin&quot;.

Croft relocated to the Northeast of England to work at Tyne Tees Television, where he produced many editions of the variety show &quot;The One O&#x27;Clock Show&quot;. For Tyne Tees, Croft also directed and produced the admags &quot;Ned&#x27;s Shed&quot; and &quot;Mary Goes to Market&quot;, as well as producing his first sitcom, &quot;Under New Management&quot;, set in a derelict pub in the North of England.

After leaving Tyne Tees Television to work at the BBC in the mid-1960s, he produced several of the Corporation&#x27;s sitcoms such as &quot;Beggar My Neighbour&quot;, &quot;A World of His Own&quot;, &quot;Further Up Pompeii!&quot; and &quot;Hugh and I&quot;. It was while producing &quot;Hugh and I&quot; that he was introduced to actor Jimmy Perry, who handed him an unsolicited script for a pilot called &quot;The Fighting Tigers&quot; about the British Home Guard during the Second World War. Croft liked the idea. The two men co-wrote nine series of the show, which was retitled &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot;, as well as a feature film and a stage show based on it.

While &quot;Dad&#x27;s Army&quot; was still running, Croft began to co-write &quot;Are You Being Served?&quot; with Jeremy Lloyd. He was to continue both writing partnerships for the rest of his career in several hit series including &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot;, &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot; and &quot;You Rang, M&#x27;Lord?&quot; (with Perry) and &quot;&#x27;Allo &#x27;Allo!&quot; (with Lloyd). His last full series &quot;Oh, Doctor Beeching!&quot;, broadcast from 1995 to 1997, was co-written with Richard Spendlove. He created a television pilot in 2007, entitled &quot;Here Comes The Queen&quot;, with Jeremy Lloyd. This starred Wendy Richard and Les Dennis, but the show was not continued as a series. Of these, &quot;It Ain&#x27;t Half Hot Mum&quot; &quot;was David’s and my favourite&quot;, Jimmy Perry told journalist Neil Clark for a &quot;Daily Telegraph&quot; article in 2013.

As a producer, Croft&#x27;s regular practice was to signal the end of an episode with the caption &quot;You have been watching ...&quot;, followed by shots of the main cast.

==Personal life==
Croft married theatrical agent Ann Callender on 2 June 1952; the couple had seven children and sixteen grandchildren. In 1986, one daughter, Rebecca, married Simon Cadell, a star of Croft&#x27;s comedy &quot;Hi-de-Hi!&quot;.

Croft was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; on 20 December 1995, when he was surprised by Michael Aspel outside BBC Television Centre.

David Croft died in his sleep at his home in Portugal on 27 September 2011. He was 89 years old. His widow Ann died on 11 June 2016.

==Awards and honours==
Croft became an Officer of The Most Excellent Order of the British Empire with Jimmy Perry in 1978 for services to television. He also received the 1981 &quot;Desmond Davis award&quot; from the British Academy of Film and Television Arts, for his outstanding contributions to the industry.

<text>Maria White Lowell (July 8, 1821 – October 27, 1853) was an American poet and abolitionist. Her poems were privately printed by her husband, James Russell Lowell, the poet, two years after her death.

==Early life==
Maria White was born in Watertown, Massachusetts, to a middle-class, intellectual family. She was raised under a strict ascetic discipline at an Ursuline convent which was burned by a mob in 1834.

==Career==
Lowell became involved in the temperance movement and was a supporter of women&#x27;s rights. On November 6, 1839, she was one of the local women who attended the first &quot;conversation&quot; organized by women&#x27;s rights advocate Margaret Fuller.

The same year, Maria White&#x27;s brother William introduced her to his Harvard College classmate, James Russell Lowell. The two became engaged in the autumn of 1840. However, her father Abijah White, a wealthy merchant, insisted that the wedding be postponed until Lowell had gainful employment.

In the winter of 1843–44, Maria White and her mother left the bleak neighborhood of Boston to spend the spring in the milder climate of Philadelphia. It happened that they went to a Friend&#x27;s boarding-house in the city, and through the kind interest of their hostess, &quot;Friend Parker&quot;, made the acquaintance of others, who introduced the Whites into other Friend homes. The Whites had no knowledge of Quakerism, but their simple sincere natures found much in common with members of that religion who in turn enjoyed getting to know the Whites. Strong friendships followed, and as a natural result of these, Maria White&#x27;s tendency towards the antislavery movement, then in its unpopular beginnings, was strengthened and continued. When the weather grew warmer, and the east winds of New England had lessened, the mother and daughter returned to Watertown. Maria White was urged to remain longer in Philadelphia, and visit some of her new friends in their own homes, but her reply was characteristic: &quot;No, no. I have left one in Cambridge who makes even the east wind warm for me.&quot; She was referring to James Russell Lowell, her fiancé.

Shortly after Lowell published &quot;Conversations on the Old Poets&quot;, a collection of his previously published essays, the couple married on December 26, 1844, at her father&#x27;s house. The new husband believed she was made up &quot;half of earth and more than of Heaven&quot;. A friend described their relationship as &quot;the very picture of a True Marriage&quot;.

White, who became involved in movements against intemperance and slavery, joined the Boston Female Anti-Slavery Society and persuaded Lowell to become an abolitionist. The new Mrs. Lowell, however, was in poor health and the couple moved to Philadelphia shortly after their marriage in the hopes she would be healed there.

In 1845, the newly married pair came again to Philadelphia, and it was arranged that Mr. Lowell would do some editorial work on the &quot;Pennsylvania&#x27;a Freeman&quot;, an antislavery weekly of that city and also make regular contributions to the &quot;Antislavery Standard&quot;. Before leaving Philadelphia, the Lowells had their daguerreotypes taken by Langenheim. These were the only pictures taken in their early married life. In the spring of 1845, the Lowells returned to Cambridge, Massachusetts to make their home at Elmwood in Cambridge, Massachusetts. They had four children, though only one survived past infancy. Their first, Blanche, was born December 31, 1845, but lived only fifteen months; Rose, born in 1849, survived only a few months as well; their only son, Walter, was born in 1850 but died in 1852. Only their fourth child, Mabel, survived to adulthood.

=== Death ===
Frail, delicate, and plagued by ill-health throughout her life, Maria White Lowell died on October 27, 1853, at the age of 32 in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She is buried with her husband in Mount Auburn Cemetery. A volume of her poems was printed privately after her death (Cambridge, 1855). The best known of them are &quot;The Alpine Shepherd&quot; and &quot;The Morning-Glory.&quot;

==Critical response and influence==
In 1870, when Emily Dickinson first met Thomas Wentworth Higginson, he mentioned the poetry of Maria White Lowell. Dickinson asked to know more and she may have been inspired by her work. One of Lowell&#x27;s poems, &quot;The Sick Room&quot;, has been described as &quot;Dickinsonian&quot;. Her poem &quot;The Grave of Keats&quot; was published in the 1874 anthology &quot;Poems of Places&quot;, edited by former neighbor Henry Wadsworth Longfellow.

Amy Lowell, a descendant of the family, praised Maria Lowell&#x27;s writing: &quot;That is poetry! It is better than anything her husband ever wrote, and he always said that she was a better poet than he.&quot;

==Quotes==
* &quot;Two souls with but a single thought, two hearts that beat as one.&quot; – translated by Lowell from Bellinghausen&#x27;s drama, &quot;Der Sohn der Wildnis (1842)&quot; into the play Ingomar the Barbarian

<doc id="254105" wikidata="Q23899" url="?curid=254105" title="Dizzy (series)">
<text>Dizzy is a series of video games, created by the Oliver Twins and published by Codemasters. It was one of the most successful British video game franchises of the late 1980s and early 1990s. Originally created for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC, the series appeared on multiple home computer and video game console formats, with over a dozen games being published between 1987 and 1992.

The series is named for its main character, an anthropomorphic egg, called Dizzy for the way he somersaults and rolls around the landscape. The games are set in various fairytale-like locations and typically involve Dizzy trying to save his friends and family, the Yolkfolk, often from the schemes of his nemesis, the evil wizard Zaks.

Most of the games in the series were platform-adventure games, with an emphasis on puzzle solving, collecting objects and interacting with other characters. In addition to these core adventure games, the &quot;Dizzy&quot; branding and character also appeared in several action games with unrelated gameplay.

Since the demise of the series in the early 1990s, there have been numerous attempts to revive the series. These have included a remake for smartphone platforms, a Kickstarter campaign, and the publishing of several old games that were thought lost. The series has also served as the inspiration for other games, including many fangames.

==Common elements==
===Gameplay===

The games of the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series are commonly categorised into either two or three groups. Core to the series and comprising over half its titles are the adventure games, all of which have similar gameplay and mechanics. The rest of the games in the series all have different gameplay from the adventure games and from one another, and are connected only by branding, themes and character. These are commonly referred to as the arcade games, but are sometimes further split into arcade and puzzle games.

The adventure games also included many elements of platform games, such as running and jumping to avoid enemies and hazards. They also relied heavily on object and inventory based puzzles to interact with the environment and non-player characters. For example, the opening screen of &quot;Dizzy: Prince of the Yolkfolk&quot; tasked the player with escaping from a locked cell using a jug of water, a pile of leaves, and a box of matches.

Additional innovations were added as the series progressed. The ability to carry more than one item simultaneously was added in &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; and refined in &quot;Fantasy World Dizzy&quot;. Collectable items were also first introduced in &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; in the form of coins; later games retained the idea but often used other items such as diamonds or cherries. A health bar was first introduced in &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot;, allowing Dizzy to be hit without dying.

===Characters===
The main protagonist and player character for the series is the eponymous Dizzy, an anthropomorphic egg with big eyes, a smiley face, boxing gloves and minimal identifying features. Named for the way he somersaults and rolls around the screen, Dizzy&#x27;s design was kept deliberately simple. The idea was that this allows players to project themselves onto the character, and to imagine a character beyond what could be achieved by computer graphics of the time.

Throughout most of the series, Dizzy is joined by a cast of recurring characters, also eggs, known as the Yolkfolk, who make up his friends and family. Not present in the original &quot;Dizzy – The Ultimate Cartoon Adventure&quot;, the Yolkfolk are first mentioned in &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; and then appear on-screen in &quot;Fantasy World Dizzy&quot;. Including Dizzy, there are seven Yolkfolk in total: Dizzy, Daisy, Denzil, Dora, Dozy, Dylan, and Grand Dizzy. Introduced to allow for more story threads and more interesting characters, the Oliver Twins based each of them on a different character from popular culture. For example, Dora was modelled on Velma from &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; and Denzil on Fonzie from &quot;Happy Days&quot;.

Except for Dizzy himself, the most prominent member of the Yolkfolk is his girlfriend, Daisy. She is often a damsel in distress, with her rescue being the key motivator to the plot of several of the games. Indeed, when Codemasters issued &quot;Dizzy&quot; collectable cards, Daisy&#x27;s card acknowledged this: &quot;The only problem with Daisy is that she&#x27;s always getting captured&quot;. However, she eventually appears as a second playable character in &quot;Wonderland Dizzy&quot;.

Other than the Yolkfolk, prominent recurring characters are the evil wizard Zaks, who was the primary antagonist in several games of the series; and Dizzy&#x27;s pet, Pogie, a small furry creature known as a Fluffle, who starred in the spin-off game &quot;Dreamworld Pogie&quot;.

===Setting===
The &quot;Dizzy&quot; games all take place in fantasy settings loosely based around fables and fairy tales. By alluding to other well known stories, the games are able to present scenarios and puzzles that are interesting and appealing, while also accessible even to a young audience. For instance, a puzzle in which the player must use magic beans to grow a giant beanstalk relies upon the player&#x27;s pre-existing knowledge of the story of &quot;Jack and the Beanstalk&quot;. Similarly, the games&#x27; simple black-and-white morality, with many of them having the final goal of defeating the evil wizard Zaks, was also a nod to their fairy tales roots. Speaking on the subject, Andrew Oliver said that &quot;it&#x27;s common in any fairy tale to have an evil person to defeat, and so we went down this route&quot;.

==Development==
===Creation===
&quot;Dizzy&quot; was created in 1987 by Andrew and Philip Oliver, collectively known as the Oliver Twins and published by Codemasters. Prior to &quot;Dizzy&quot;, they had mostly written simulation games for Codemasters such as &quot;Grand Prix Simulator&quot;, and they were eager to branch out into different types of games. The character of Dizzy was created before any of his games; the Olivers had noticed that most traditional characters in video games of the time had very small faces which were largely unable to express emotion. As such, they decided to create a new character who was little more than just a large face, rounded out with gloves and boots. They had also written a development tool, Panda Sprites, which could be used to easily rotate images on the screen, and they were eager to put it to use. Trying it out on their new character made him somersault and roll around the screen, which they believed gave him a unique feel and also gave rise to his name, Dizzy.

For the game itself, the Olivers aimed to create something with more story and characters than many contemporary games of the time. Their goal was a game that was more akin to an interactive cartoon, hence the game&#x27;s subtitle, &quot;&quot;. It was initially released for Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum since the two platforms&#x27; similar hardware (both use the Z80 microprocessor) made it easier to develop for both simultaneously. A port to the Commodore 64 followed.

At first, Codemasters&#x27; David Darling was not impressed by Dizzy, and wanted the Olivers to continue to create more Simulator games instead. However they mostly paid game developers only in royalties at that point, so they published it anyway since it constituted such a low risk for them. Initial sales were unremarkable, being similar to an average Codemasters game of the time; unusually, they remained steady for a prolonged period rather than suffering drop off over time. This was enough for both Codemasters and the Olivers to want to produce a sequel.

===Growth of the series===
&quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; was again written for the ZX Spectrum and Amstrad CPC, using an updated version of the game engine from the original Dizzy, and a world editor that the Olivers had also written. Originally, it was just going to be called &quot;Dizzy 2&quot;, but they eventually took motivation from the naming of the &quot;James Bond&quot; series and decided to name it &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot;, aiming to make it clearer that the game was a separate, stand-alone experience that could be enjoyed without having played the original.

One of the problems that they encountered during development was that it was possible to put the game into an unwinnable state. When the player lost a life, they respawned – effectively being brought back to life – in a safe location. One of the game&#x27;s items was a snorkel that was required to move underwater and the twins found that it was possible to respawn in such a way that the snorkel was completely inaccessible, either under or across the water. Being unable to think of any other solution in time for release, they made the decision to give the player only one life. This removed the logic problem but also gave the game a reputation as the series&#x27; most difficult incarnation.

In addition to the three platforms that &quot;Dizzy&quot; had appeared on, &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot; was also ported to the Amiga, Atari ST, Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), and DOS.

The third game in the series, 1989&#x27;s &quot;Fast Food&quot;, saw a departure from the style of the first two games. Instead of the platform adventure gameplay they had, it was a maze game, inspired by &quot;Pac-Man&quot;. The Olivers have given various explanations for this change in interviews they have given over the years, including a desire to prove that the character of Dizzy was valuable even outside the adventure format, caution over not wanting to over-saturate the market with similar games, and even a desire to develop a game that could be made very quickly to be out in time for Christmas. Regardless of the reason for the change in format, it proved to be a successful one, with Philip Oliver later commenting that &quot;people get more involved in the adventures but the arcade games sell just as well&quot;.

The next game, &quot;Fantasy World Dizzy&quot;, was a return to the adventure game format. It also saw the introduction of the Yolkfolk characters, who were prominent throughout the rest of the series. The extra characters allowed the Olivers to include more dialogue in the game, moving it further towards their original conception of an interactive cartoon. &quot;Kwik Snax&quot;, another maze game, though this time with a much greater emphasis on puzzle solving. was released in 1990.

===Handing off to Big Red Software===
&quot;Kwik Snax&quot; was the last &quot;Dizzy&quot; game for the original Amstrad and Spectrum formats the Oliver Twins developed. By this point, it was clear that these formats were not going to survive for much longer and both Codemasters and the Olivers wanted to expand &quot;Dizzy&quot; into the video game console market. Not only could this allow them to reach a larger audience in the UK and Europe, but it could also allow them to break into lucrative foreign markets, such as the US. Even so, demand for &quot;Dizzy&quot; games on the original formats was still strong at the time, and it was Codemasters&#x27; biggest series. Spread too thin to work on new home computer titles themselves, the Olivers decided to contract out future development to Big Red Software.

Speaking after the fact, the twins commented that they had previously contracted out development of ports of their games to other system, and that this felt like the natural next step for them. For the first game that Big Red developed, &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot;, the Olivers still played a major role in the creation, collaborating on the game&#x27;s story and overseeing the game&#x27;s design. The next game, &quot;Panic Dizzy&quot;, was similar; for this falling block puzzle game, the Olivers came up with a design for the game which they sent to Big Red to create.

Big Red Software created two further Dizzy adventure games, &quot;Spellbound Dizzy&quot; and &quot;&quot;, both released in 1991. By this time, they were working almost entirely independently, creating games that fit the pre-established formula with minimal oversight or input from the Olivers.

In 1992, Codemasters published &quot;Crystal Kingdom Dizzy&quot; as a full price game (approximately £10) when all previous games in the series had been budget releases (approximately £3-4). &quot;Crystal Kingdom Dizzy&quot; reached number one in the ZX Spectrum games chart, and ended up being the last &quot;Dizzy&quot; game.

===Console woes===
The first title to be specifically designed for the NES, &quot;Fantastic Dizzy&quot; (also known as &quot;The Fantastic Adventures of Dizzy&quot;) followed the general formula of the adventure games, but also included arcade game sections as mini-games. Two of these mini-games were ported to home computer formats by Big Red as standalone games, becoming &quot;Bubble Dizzy&quot; and &quot;Dizzy Down the Rapids&quot;.

Working on the new system also proved to be something of a challenge for the Olivers, who were unused to the longer development cycles and higher degree of polish required for console games, where they had to compete against titles such as &quot;Super Mario&quot;. The game was completed in 1990, but its release was hampered by the conflict and legal case then ongoing between Codemasters and Nintendo over the Game Genie. It was released in April 1991, but it had missed the important Christmas release window, and lacked a license from Nintendo. Despite a generally favourable reception, the game sold only a quarter of its predicted half million copies.

Further development for consoles was disrupted by disagreements between Codemasters and the Olivers. &quot;Dreamworld Pogie&quot;, a spin-off starring Dizzy&#x27;s pet, Pogie, was going to be a scrolling platform inspired by &quot;Super Mario&quot;, but was cancelled. There were other games that the Olivers had been designing as stand-alone releases which Codemasters only wanted to release as a compilation, &quot;The Excellent Dizzy Collection&quot;. Even then, one of the slated games, &quot;Wonderland Dizzy&quot; (a remake of &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot; with an &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot; theme), was removed from the compilation since Codemasters saw it as being too similar to &quot;Dizzy the Adventurer&quot; (a remake of &quot;Dizzy: Prince of the Yolkfolk&quot;). &quot;The Excellent Dizzy Collection&quot; was eventually released for the Sega Game Gear, and included three games: &quot;Dizzy the Adventurer&quot;; a previously unreleased puzzle game, &quot;Go! Dizzy Go!&quot;; and &quot;Panic Dizzy&quot;, a renamed and updated version of &quot;Dizzy Panic&quot;.

With these strained relations, the Oliver Twins eventually fell out with Codemasters, and stopped working with or for the company. Since intellectual property rights for the series were split between the two parties, with the Olivers owning the copyright and Codemasters the trademark, this effectively put an end to the series.

==Reception==
The &quot;Dizzy&quot; series achieved both critical and commercial success, and was one of the largest and most popular British video game franchises of the late 80s and early 90s with twelve games from the series reaching number one in the charts. Speaking in 1992, Andrew Oliver stated that the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series received more fan-mail than all other Codemasters games combined. In addition to its success in its home market, the &quot;Dizzy&quot; games were also extremely popular in Russia and Eastern Europe.

The series was sufficiently popular that various merchandise was made for it, such as clothing, mugs and clocks, even though this was unusual for video games at the time. There were also discussions with Hanna-Barbera about the possibility of creating a cartoon series based on the franchise, though these ultimately never came to fruition due to concerns that the series did not have enough of a global appeal.

However, reception was not universally positive, with some of the arcade games in particular receiving poor reviews. For example, Adam Peters of &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; referred to &quot;Dizzy Panic&quot; as &quot;a terrible game&quot; and gave it a score of 12%. In a 2012 retrospective on the series, Richard Cobbett of &quot;PC Gamer&quot; described the quality of the games as ranging from &quot;bad to mediyolkre&quot;, though also acknowledged that this was less important given the lower prices and generally lower standards of games at the time.

==Appearances on cover tapes and disks==
&quot;Dizzy&quot; games made numerous appearances on cover tapes and disks of British magazines, usually in the form of cut-down versions or demos. Indeed, the appearance of a version of the original &quot;Dizzy&quot; on an &quot;Amstrad Action&quot; cover tape has been credited with popularising the idea of covermounts in the UK. Sometimes, modified or themed versions of the games were used, such as &quot;Dizzy&#x27;s Easter Eggstravaganza&quot;, an Easter-themed version of &quot;Fast Food&quot; that appeared on a 1993 &quot;Amiga Action&quot; cover disk.

A &quot;Crash&quot; magazine cover tape from 1991 included &quot;Dizzy 3 and a Half: Into Magicland&quot;. This was a short game, comprising only five screens, that served as a prequel for &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot;, and was not commercially released or made available anywhere else. &quot;Crash&quot; also published a special edition of &quot;Treasure Island Dizzy&quot;.

==Remakes and revival attempts==
The Oliver Twins and Codemasters, who both own 50% of the intellectual property, have expressed interest in resurrecting the series. However, the twins concede: 
In October 2011, the website EggCitingNews.com was registered by Codemasters Software Ltd. The main page on the site featured a pair of eyes peering from an egg carton, accompanied by the phrase &quot;Guess who&#x27;s back?&quot;. The following month, the website DizzyGame.com was opened, featuring details of the new release: a port to mobile platforms of &quot;Dizzy: Prince of the Yolkfolk&quot;. The game was developed by Paul Ranson, who worked on the original 1991 title, with updated music by Codemasters&#x27; sound designer Mark Knight, and updated art by Leigh Christian, who had also worked on the original game. Updates that were made to modernise the game included the addition of achievements and a hint system, and the removal of lives. It was released on 9 December of the same year for iOS and Android.

Oliver Twins launched a Kickstarter project titled &quot;Dizzy Returns&quot; in November 2012; the game was to be the first official sequel in over 20 years. The Oliver Twins asked &quot;Dizzy&quot; fans to help pledge £350,000 to the Kickstarter campaign in order for the game to be made. By the Kickstarter project&#x27;s deadline on 21 December, only £25,620 was pledged to the campaign. The Oliver Twins announced on the same day that &quot;Dizzy Returns&quot; was no longer in development. They attributed the failure to starting the campaign very early in pre-development and therefore not having anything concrete to show to potential backers and stated that while they were still interested in revisiting &quot;Dizzy&quot; in the future, any such project would have to have a &quot;considerably different&quot; vision.

In the 2010s, the Oliver Twins found the code for several lost NES games that were written during the 1990s but never published; the brothers subsequently released the games. &quot;Wonderland Dizzy&quot;, a remake of &quot;Magicland Dizzy&quot;, was released on 24 October 2015. &quot;Mystery World Dizzy&quot;, a remake of &quot;Fantasy World Dizzy&quot;, was released on 8 April 2017. &quot;Dreamworld Pogie&quot;, a previously-unreleased spin-off, was discovered in 2011 and released in 2016.

A new game for the series, &quot;Wonderful Dizzy&quot;, in development by the Oliver Twins and based on &quot;The Wonderful Wizard of Oz&quot;, was due to be released for the Spectrum Next in late 2018, but was finished in late 2020 as a regular ZX Spectrum title. A few days before the game&#x27;s release date, the Oliver Twins stated on their website that it would be released on 18 December.

In November 2020, a completely new version of &quot;Fast Food&quot; (now titled &quot;Fast Food Dizzy&quot;) was released for the Nintendo Switch. It was developed and published by the Oliver Twins on the FUZE program for the console.

==Cancelled games==
==Fan-created games==
In addition to the official &quot;Dizzy&quot; games, many fangames have also been created. Many of these were created with DizzyAGE (Dizzy Adventure Game Engine), a specialised game engine released in 2006 that enables fans to easily create their own games in the style of the original games. Fans had previously had to use other game engines, which were not always suited to the puzzle style of the &quot;Dizzy&quot; games. From 2006 to 2016, the makers of DizzyAGE ran a competition each year to find the best game from the previous year, with several of the competitions featuring prizes offered by the Oliver Twins. As of 2018, there are over a hundred fan games listed on the DizzyAGE website.

==Related games==
The &quot;Seymour&quot; series is a similar franchise, also developed by Big Red and published by Codemasters. The first game in the series, &quot;Seymour Goes to Hollywood&quot;, was originally conceived as a &quot;Dizzy&quot; game, but was rebranded due to a desire to keep &quot;Dizzy&quot; retained to fantasy settings.

&quot;Wibble World Giddy&quot; is a 1993 public domain parody game for the Amiga. It features similar gameplay to the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series and stars Giddy, an egg very much like Dizzy except that rather than wear boxing gloves he simply had very large hands. A sequel, &quot;Giddy 2&quot;, was released the following year, also on Amiga, with a third game, &quot;Giddy 3&quot;, being made in 2000 for DOS, then subsequently ported to multiple other formats.

&quot;Clover: A Curious Tale&quot; is a 2009 adventure game that has similar mechanics to and is considered an homage to the &quot;Dizzy&quot; series. The PC version was published by Blitz 1UP, part of the Oliver Twins&#x27; Blitz Games Studios.

<text>David Whittaker (born 24 April 1957 in Bury, England) is an English video game composer. He is known for writing video game music in most of the 1980s and early 1990s for different formats.

==Career==
While composing music, Whittaker directly programmed music; instead of using music composition tools, he used a machine code monitor—then an assembler system or program—while including tools from Supersoft and Commodore. He frequently composed for the format on the Commodore 64 and was impressed with the Amiga&#x27;s sound capabilities, later using sound effects in his compositions for Amiga.

His compositions appeared in Amiga games such as &quot;Shadow of the Beast&quot;, &quot;Obliterator&quot;, &quot;Beyond the Ice Palace&quot;, and &quot;Speedball&quot;. On the Commodore 64, his most popular compositions are in &quot;Glider Rider&quot;, &quot;Storm&quot;, &quot;Street Surfer&quot;, and &quot;Armageddon Man&quot;. His subtune 21 of &quot;Lazy Jones&quot; was the basis for the electronic song &quot;Kernkraft 400&quot; by Zombie Nation. Other formats he has composed for include Amstrad CPC, Atari ST, Atari 8-bit computers, MSX, and ZX Spectrum.

After working for eight years in the US for Electronic Arts at Redwood Shores, he joined British video game developer Traveller&#x27;s Tales in Knutsford, Cheshire, working as Head of Audio in September 2004.

<text>A textbook is a book containing a comprehensive compilation of content in a branch of study with the intention of explaining it. Textbooks are produced to meet the needs of educators, usually at educational institutions, but also of learners (who could be independent learners outside of formal education). Schoolbooks are textbooks and other books used in schools. Today, many textbooks are published in both print and digital formats.

==History==

The history of textbooks dates back to ancient civilizations. For example, Ancient Greeks wrote educational texts. The modern textbook has its roots in the mass production made possible by the printing press. Johannes Gutenberg himself may have printed editions of &quot;Ars Minor&quot;, a schoolbook on Latin grammar by Aelius Donatus. Early textbooks were used by tutors and teachers (e.g. alphabet books), as well as by individuals who taught themselves.

The Greek philosopher Socrates lamented the loss of knowledge because the media of transmission were changing. Before the invention of the Greek alphabet 2,500 years ago, knowledge and stories were recited aloud, much like Homer&#x27;s epic poems. The new technology of writing meant stories no longer needed to be memorized, a development Socrates feared would weaken the Greeks&#x27; mental capacities for memorizing and retelling. (Ironically, we know about Socrates&#x27; concerns only because they were written down by his student Plato in his famous Dialogues.)

Peter Ramus (Petrus Ramus) in 16th Century France challenged the curriculum taught at university and published a text book that could be used by anyone. It was a textbook with a structure of headings and summaries. 

The next revolution in the field of books came with the 15th-century invention of printing with changeable type. The invention is attributed to German metalsmith Johannes Gutenberg, who cast type in molds using a melted metal alloy and constructed a wooden-screw printing press to transfer the image onto paper.

Gutenberg&#x27;s first and only large-scale printing effort was the now iconic Gutenberg Bible in the 1450s – a Latin translation from the Hebrew Old Testament and the Greek New Testament. Gutenberg&#x27;s invention made mass production of texts possible for the first time. Although the Gutenberg Bible itself was expensive, printed books began to spread widely over European trade routes during the next 50 years, and by the 16th century, printed books had become more widely accessible and less costly.

While many textbooks were already in use, compulsory education and the resulting growth of schooling in Europe led to the printing of many more textbooks for children. Textbooks have been the primary teaching instrument for most children since the 19th century. Two textbooks of historical significance in United States schooling were the 18th century New England Primer and the 19th century McGuffey Readers.

Recent technological advances have changed the way people interact with textbooks. Online and digital materials are making it increasingly easy for students to access materials other than the traditional print textbook. Students now have access to electronic books (&quot;e-books&quot;), online tutoring systems and video lectures. An example of an e-book is &quot;Principles of Biology&quot; from Nature Publishing.

Most notably, an increasing number of authors are avoiding commercial publishers and instead offering their textbooks under a creative commons or other open license.

==Market==

===The market for textbooks===

As in many industries, the number of providers has declined in recent years (there are just a handful of major textbook companies in the United States). Also, elasticity of demand is fairly low. The term &quot;broken market&quot; appeared in the economist James Koch&#x27;s analysis of the market commissioned by the Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance.

In the United States, the largest textbook publishers are Pearson Education, Cengage, McGraw-Hill Education, and Wiley. Together they control 90% of market revenue. Another textbook publisher is Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.

The market for textbooks does not reflect classic supply and demand because of agency problems.

===New editions and the used book market in the United States===
Some students save money by buying used copies of textbooks, which tend to be less expensive, and are available from many college bookstores in the US, who buy them back from students at the end of a term. Books that are not being re-used at the school are often purchased by an off-campus wholesaler for 0–30% of the new cost, for distribution to other bookstores. Some textbook companies have countered this by encouraging teachers to assign homework that must be done on the publisher&#x27;s website. Students with a new textbook can use the pass code in the book to register on the site; otherwise they must pay the publisher to access the website and complete assigned homework.

Students who look beyond the campus bookstore can typically find lower prices. With the ISBN or title, author and edition, most textbooks can be located through online used booksellers or retailers.

Most leading textbook companies publish a new edition every 3 or 4 years, more frequently in math and science. Harvard economics chair James K. Stock has stated that new editions are often not about significant improvements to the content. &quot;New editions are to a considerable extent simply another tool used by publishers and textbook authors to maintain their revenue stream, that is, to keep up prices.&quot; A study conducted by The Student PIRGs found that a new edition costs 12% more than a new copy of the previous edition (not surprising if the old version is obsolete), and 58% more than a used copy of the previous edition. Textbook publishers maintain these new editions are driven by demand from teachers. That study found that 76% of teachers said new editions were justified &quot;half of the time or less&quot; and 40% said they were justified &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot;. The PIRG study has been criticized by publishers, who argue that the report contains factual inaccuracies regarding the annual average cost of textbooks per student.

The Student PIRGs also point out that recent emphasis on e-textbooks does not always save students money. Even though the book costs less up-front, the student will not recover any of the cost through resale.

===Bundling in the United States===
Another publishing industry practice that has been highly criticized is &quot;bundling&quot;, or shrink-wrapping supplemental items into a textbook. Supplemental items range from CD-ROMs and workbooks to online passcodes and bonus material. Students often cannot buy these things separately, and often the one-time-use supplements destroy the resale value of the textbook.

According to the Student PIRGs, the typical bundled textbook costs 10%–50% more than an unbundled textbook, and 65% of professors said they &quot;rarely&quot; or &quot;never&quot; use the bundled items in their courses.

A 2005 Government Accountability Office (GAO) Report in the United States found that the production of these supplemental items was the primary cause of rapidly increasing prices:

While publishers, retailers, and wholesalers all play a role in textbook pricing, the primary factor contributing to increases in the price of textbooks has been the increased investment publishers have made in new products to enhance instruction and learning...While wholesalers, retailers, and others do not question the quality of these materials, they have expressed concern that the publishers&#x27; practice 
of packaging supplements with a textbook to sell as one unit limits the opportunity students have to purchase less expensive used books...If publishers continue to increase these investments, particularly in technology, the cost to produce a textbook is likely to continue to increase in the future.
Bundling has also been used to segment the used book market. Each combination of a textbook and supplemental items receives a separate ISBN. A single textbook could therefore have dozens of ISBNs that denote different combinations of supplements packaged with that particular book. When a bookstore attempts to track down used copies of textbooks, they will search for the ISBN the course instructor orders, which will locate only a subset of the copies of the textbook.

Legislation at state and federal levels seeks to limit the practice of bundling, by requiring publishers to offer all components separately. Publishers have testified in favor of bills including this provision, but only in the case that the provision exempts the loosely defined category of &quot;integrated textbooks&quot;. The Federal bill only exempts 3rd party materials in integrated textbooks, however publisher lobbyists have attempted to create a loophole through this definition in state bills.

===Price disclosure===
Given that the problem of high textbook prices is linked to the &quot;broken&quot; economics of the market, requiring publishers to disclose textbook prices to faculty is a solution pursued by a number of legislatures. By inserting price into sales interactions, this regulation will supposedly make the economic forces operate more normally.

No data suggests that this is in fact true. However, The Student PIRGs have found that publishers actively withhold pricing information from faculty, making it difficult to obtain. Their most recent study found that 77% of faculty say publisher sales representatives do not volunteer prices, and only 40% got an answer when they directly asked. Furthermore, the study found that 23% of faculty rated publisher websites as &quot;informative and easy to use&quot; and less than half said they typically listed the price.

The US Congress passed a law in the 2008 Higher Education Opportunity Act that would require price disclosure. Legislation requiring price disclosure has passed in Connecticut, Washington, Minnesota, Oregon, Arizona, Oklahoma, and Colorado. Publishers are currently supporting price disclosure mandates, though they insist that the &quot;suggested retail price&quot; should be disclosed, rather than the actual price the publisher would get for the book.

===Used textbook market===
Once a textbook is purchased from a retailer for the first time, there are several ways a student can sell his/her textbooks back at the end of the semester or later. Students can sell to 1) the college/university bookstore; 2) fellow students; 3) numerous online websites; or 4) a student swap service.

====Campus buyback====
As for buyback on a specific campus, faculty decisions largely determine how much a student receives. If a professor chooses to use the same book the following semester, even if it is a custom text, designed specifically for an individual instructor, bookstores often buy the book back. The GAO report found that, generally, if a book is in good condition and will be used on the campus again the next term, bookstores will pay students 50 percent of the original price paid. If the bookstore has not received a faculty order for the book at the end of the term and the edition is still current, they may offer students the wholesale price of the book, which could range from 5 to 35 percent of the new retail price, according to the GAO report.

When students resell their textbooks during campus &quot;buyback&quot; periods, these textbooks are often sold into the national used textbook distribution chain. If a textbook is not going to be used on campus for the next semester of courses then many times the college bookstore will sell that book to a national used book company. The used book company then resells the book to another college bookstore. Finally, that book is sold as used to a student at another college at a price that is typically 75% of the new book price. At each step, a markup is applied to the book to enable the respective companies to continue to operate.

====Student to student sales====
Students can also sell or trade textbooks among themselves. After completing a course, sellers will often seek out members of the next enrolling class, people who are likely to be interested in purchasing the required books. This may be done by posting flyers to advertise the sale of the books or simply soliciting individuals who are shopping in the college bookstore for the same titles. Many larger schools have independent websites set up for the purpose of facilitating such trade. These often operate much like digital classified ads, enabling students to list their items for sale and browse for those they wish to acquire. Also, at the US Air Force Academy, it is possible to e-mail entire specific classes, allowing for an extensive network of textbook sales to exist.

====Student online marketplaces====
Online marketplaces are one of the two major types of online websites students can use to sell used textbooks. Online marketplaces may have an online auction format or may allow the student to list their books for a fixed price. In either case, the student must create the listing for each book themselves and wait for a buyer to order, making the use of marketplaces a more passive way of selling used textbooks. Unlike campus buyback and online book, students are unlikely to sell all their books to one buyer using online marketplaces, and will likely have to send out multiple books individually.

====Online book buyers====
Online book buyers buy textbooks, and sometimes other types of books, with the aim of reselling them for a profit. Like online marketplaces, online book buyers operate year-round, giving students the opportunity to sell their books even when campus &quot;buyback&quot; periods are not in effect. Online book buyers, who are often online book sellers as well, will sometimes disclaim whether or not a book can be sold back prior to purchase. Students enter the ISBN numbers of the books they wish to sell and receive a price quote or offer. These online book buyers often offer &quot;free shipping&quot; (which in actuality is built into the offer for the book), and allow students to sell multiple books to the same source. Because online book buyers are buying books for resale, the prices they offer may be lower than students can get on online marketplaces. However, their prices are competitive, and they tend to focus on the convenience of their service. Some even claim that buying used textbooks online and selling them to online book buyers has a lower total cost than even textbook rental services.

====Textbook exchanges====
In response to escalating textbook prices, limited competition, and to provide a more efficient system to connect buyers and sellers together, online textbook exchanges were developed. Most of today&#x27;s sites handle buyer and seller payments, and usually deduct a small commission only after the sale is completed.

According to textbook author Henry L. Roediger (and Wadsworth Publishing Company senior editor Vicki Knight), the used textbook market is illegitimate, and entirely to blame for the rising costs of textbooks. As methods of &quot;dealing with this problem&quot;, he recommends making previous editions of textbooks obsolete, binding the textbook with other materials, and passing laws to prevent the sale of used books. The concept is not unlike the limited licensing approach for computer software, which places rigid restrictions on resale and reproduction. The intent is to make users understand that the content of any textbook is the intellectual property of the author and/or the publisher, and that as such, subject to copyright. Obviously, this idea is completely opposed to the millennia-old tradition of the sale of used books, and would make that entire industry illegal.

==== E-textbooks ====

Another alternative to save money and obtaining the materials you are required are e-textbooks. The article &quot;E books rewrite the rules of education&quot; states that, alternately to spending a lot of money on textbooks, you can purchase an e-textbook at a small amount of the cost. With the growth of digital applications for iPhone, and gadgets like the Amazon kindle, e-textbooks are not an innovation, but have been &quot;gaining momentum&quot;. According to the article &quot; Are textbooks obsolete?&quot;, publishers and editorials are concerned about the issue of expensive textbooks. &quot;The expense of textbooks is a concern for students, and e-textbooks, address the face of the issue, Williams says &quot; As publishers we understand the high cost of these materials, and the electronic format permit us diminish the general expense of our content to the market&quot;. E-textbook applications facilitate similar experiences to physical textbooks by allowing the user to highlight and take notes in-page. These applications also extend textbook learning by providing quick definitions, reading the text aloud, and search functionality.

=== Rental programs ===
In-store rentals are processed by either using a kiosk and ordering books online with a third party facilitator or renting directly from the store&#x27;s inventory. Some stores use a hybrid of both methods, opting for in-store selections of the most popular books and the online option for more obscure titles or books they consider too risky to put in the rental system. Rented items can be used for a set duration of time, then are required to be returned to the physical store or shipped back to the third party facilitator by the rental due date. Writing and highlighting is sometimes allowed in rented items, although excessive markup which makes the item unrentable is discouraged. Overdue items are often charged a fee up to the retail price of the rented item. Rented items typically do not include supplemental materials such as access codes, CDs, or loose-leafs.

=== Textbook sharing ===
Using textbook sharing, students share the physical textbook with other students, and the cost of the book is divided among the users of the textbook. Over the life of the textbook, if 4 students use the textbook, the cost of the textbook for each student will be 25% of the total cost of the book.

=== Open textbooks ===

The latest trend in textbooks is &quot;open textbooks&quot;. An open textbook is a free, openly licensed textbook offered online by the copyright holders. According to PIRG, a number of textbooks already exist, and are being used at schools such as MIT and Harvard. A 2010 study published found that open textbooks offer a viable and attractive means to meet faculty and student needs while offering savings of approximately 80% compared to traditional textbook options.

Although the largest question seems to be who is going to pay to write them, several state policies suggest that public investment in open textbooks might make sense. To offer another perspective, any jurisdiction might find itself challenged to find sufficient numbers of credible academics who would be willing to undertake the effort of creating an open textbook without realistic compensation, to make such a proposal work. Currently, some open textbooks have been funded with non-profit investment.

The other challenge involves the reality of publishing, which is that textbooks with good sales and profitability subsidize the creation and publication of low demand but believed to be necessary textbooks. Subsidies skew markets and the elimination of subsidies is disruptive; in the case of low demand textbooks the possibilities following subsidy removal include any or all of the following: higher retail prices, a switch to open textbooks, a reduction of the number of titles published.

On the other hand, independent open textbook authoring and publishing models are developing. Most notably, the startup publisher Flat World Knowledge already has dozens of college-level open textbooks that are used by more than 900 institutions in 44 countries. Their business model was to offer the open textbook free online, and then sell ancillary products that students are likely to buy if prices are reasonable – print copies, study guides, ePub, .Mobi (Kindle), PDF download, etc. Flat World Knowledge compensates its authors with royalties on these sales. With the generated revenue Flat World Knowledge funded high-quality publishing activities with a goal of making the Flat World financial model sustainable. However, in January 2013 Flat World Knowledge announced their financial model could no longer sustain their free-to-read options for students. Flat World Knowledge intends to have open textbooks available for the 125 highest-enrolled courses on college campuses within the next few years.

CK-12 Flexbooks are the open textbooks designed for United States K-12 courses. CK-12 FlexBooks are designed to facilitate conformance to national and United States and individual state textbook standards. CK-12 FlexBooks are licensed under a Creative Commons BY-NC-SA license. CK-12 FlexBooks are free to use online and offer formats suitable for use on portable personal reading devices and computers – both online and offline. Formats for both iPad and Kindle are offered. School districts may select a title as is or customize the open textbook to meet local instructional standards. The file may be then accessed electronically or printed using any print on demand service without paying a royalty, saving 80% or more when compared to traditional textbook options. An example print on demand open textbook title, &quot;College Algebra&quot; by Stitz &amp; Zeager through Lulu is 608 pages, royalty free, and costs about $20 ordered one at a time (March 2011). &quot;(Any print on demand service could be used – this is just an example. School districts could easily negotiate even lower prices for bulk purchases to be printed in their own communities.)&quot; Teacher&#x27;s editions are available for educators and parents. Titles have been authored by various individuals and organizations and are vetted for quality prior to inclusion in the CK-12 catalog. An effort is underway to map state educational standards correlations. Stanford University provided a number of titles in use.

Curriki is another modular K-12 content non-profit &quot;empowering educators to deliver and share curricula.&quot; Selected Curriki materials are also correlated to U.S. state educational standards. Some Curriki content has been collected into open textbooks and some may be used for modular lessons or special topics.

===International market pricing===

Similar to the issue of reimportation of pharmaceuticals into the U.S. market, the GAO report also highlights a similar phenomenon in textbook distribution. Retailers and publishers have expressed concern about the re-importation of lower-priced textbooks from international locations. Specifically, they cited the ability students have to purchase books from online distribution channels outside the United States at lower prices, which may result in a loss of sales for U.S. retailers. Additionally, the availability of lower-priced textbooks through these channels has heightened distrust and frustration among students regarding textbook prices, and college stores find it difficult to explain why their textbook prices are higher, according to the National Association of College Stores. Retailers and publishers have also been concerned that some U.S. retailers may have engaged in reimportation on a large scale by ordering textbooks for entire courses at lower prices from international distribution channels. While the 1998 Supreme Court decision Quality King v. L&#x27;anza protects the reimportation of copyrighted materials under the first-sale doctrine, textbook publishers have still attempted to prevent the U.S. sale of international editions by enforcing contracts which forbid foreign wholesalers from selling to American distributors. Concerned about the effects of differential pricing on college stores, the National Association of College Stores has called on publishers to stop the practice of selling textbooks at lower prices outside the United States. For example, some U.S. booksellers arrange for drop-shipments in foreign countries which are then re-shipped to America where the books can be sold online at used prices (for a &quot;new&quot; unopened book). The authors often getting half-royalties instead of full-royalties, minus the charges for returned books from bookstores.

===Production===

====Cost distribution====
According to the National Association of College Stores, the entire cost of the book is justified by expenses, with typically 11.7% of the price of a new book going to the author&#x27;s royalties (or a committee of editors at the publishing house), 22.7% going to the store, and 64.6% going to the publisher. The store and publisher amounts are slightly higher for Canada. 
Bookstores and used-book vendors profit from the resale of textbooks on the used market, with publishers only earning profits on sales of new textbooks.

====Research====
According to the GAO study published July 2005:
Following closely behind annual increases in tuition and fees at postsecondary institutions, college textbook and supply prices have risen at twice the rate of annual inflation over the last two decades.

Rising at an average of 6 percent each year since academic year 1987–1988, compared with overall average price increases of 3 percent per year, college textbook and supply prices trailed tuition and fee increases, which averaged 7 percent per year. Since December 1986, textbook and supply prices have nearly tripled, increasing by 186 percent, while tuition and fees increased by 240 percent and overall prices grew by 72 percent. While increases in textbook and supply prices have followed increases in tuition and fees, the cost of textbooks and supplies for degree-seeking students as a percentage of tuition and fees varies by the type of institution attended. For example, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student for academic year 2003–2004 was $898 at 4-year public institutions, or about 26 percent of the cost of tuition and fees. At 2-year public institutions, where low-income students are more likely to pursue a degree program and tuition and fees are lower, the average estimated cost of books and supplies per first-time, full-time student was $886 in academic year 2003–2004, representing almost three-quarters of the cost of tuition and fees.
According to the 2nd edition of a study by the United States Public Interest Research Group (US PIRG) published in February 2005: &quot;Textbook prices are increasing at more than four times the inflation rate for all finished goods, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics Producer Price Index. The wholesale prices charged by textbook publishers have jumped 62 percent since 1994, while prices charged for all finished goods increased only 14 percent. Similarly, the prices charged by publishers for general books increased just 19 percent during the same time period.&quot;

According to the 2007 edition of the College Board&#x27;s Trend in College Pricing Report published October 2007: &quot;College costs continue to rise and federal student aid has shown slower growth when adjusted for inflation, while textbooks, as a percentage of total college costs, have remained steady at about 5 percent.&quot;

==K-12 textbooks==
In most U.S. K-12 public schools, a local school board votes on which textbooks to purchase from a selection of books that have been approved by the state Department of Education. Teachers receive the books to give to the students for each subject. Teachers are usually not required to use textbooks, however, and many prefer to use other materials instead.

Textbook publishing in the U.S. is a business primarily aimed at large states. This is due to state purchasing controls over the books, most notably in Texas, where the Texas Education Agency sets curricula for all courses taught by the state&#x27;s 1,000+ school districts, and therefore also approves which textbooks can be purchased.

Commonly used American history textbooks are customized for students in California and Texas.

===High school===
In recent years, high school textbooks of United States history have come under increasing criticism. Authors such as Howard Zinn (&quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;), Gilbert T. Sewall (&quot;&quot;) and James W. Loewen (&quot;Lies My Teacher Told Me: Everything Your American History Textbook Got Wrong&quot;), make the claim that U.S. history textbooks contain mythical untruths and omissions, which paint a whitewashed picture that bears little resemblance to what most students learn in universities. Inaccurately retelling history, through textbooks or other literature, has been practiced in many societies, from ancient Rome to the Soviet Union (USSR) and the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The content of history textbooks is often determined by the political forces of state adoption boards and ideological pressure groups.

Science textbooks have been the source of ongoing debates and have come under scrutiny from several organizations. The presentation or inclusion of controversial scientific material has been debated in several court cases. Poorly designed textbooks have been cited as contributing to declining grades in mathematics and science in the United States and organizations such as the American Academy of Arts and Sciences (AAAS) have criticized the layout, presentation, and amount of material given in textbooks.

Discussions of textbooks have been included on creation and evolution in the public education debate. The &quot;Smith v. Board of School Commissioners of Mobile County&quot; case brought forward a debate about scientific fact being presented in textbooks.

In his book, &quot;Surely You&#x27;re Joking, Mr. Feynman!&quot;, the late physics Nobel Prize laureate Richard P. Feynman described his experiences as a member of a committee that evaluated science textbooks. At some instances, there were nonsensical examples to illustrate physical phenomena; then a company sent – for reasons of timing – a textbook that contained blank pages, which even got good critiques. Feynman himself experienced attempts at bribery.

==Higher education==

In the U.S., college and university textbooks are chosen by the professor teaching the course, or by the department as a whole. Students are typically responsible for obtaining their own copies of the books used in their courses, although alternatives to owning textbooks, such as textbook rental services and library reserve copies of texts, are available in some instances.

In some European countries, such as Sweden or Spain, students attending institutions of higher education pay for textbooks themselves, although higher education is free of charge otherwise.

With higher education costs on the rise, many students are becoming sensitive to every aspect of college pricing, including textbooks, which in many cases amount to one tenth of tuition costs. The 2005 Government Accountability Office report on college textbooks said that since the 1980s, textbook and supply prices have risen twice the rate of inflation in the past two decades. A 2005 PIRG study found that textbooks cost students $900 per year, and that prices increased four times the rate of inflation over the past decade. A June 2007 Advisory Committee on Student Financial Assistance (ACSFA) report, &quot;Turn the Page&quot;, reported that the average U.S. student spends $700–$1000 per year on textbooks.

While many groups have assigned blame to publishers, bookstores or faculty, the ACSFA also found that assigning blame to any one party—faculty, colleges, bookstores or publishers—for current textbook costs is unproductive and without merit. The report called on all parties within the industry to work together to find productive solutions, which included a movement toward open textbooks and other lower-cost digital solutions.

Textbook prices are considerably higher in law school. Students ordinarily pay close to $200 for case books consisting of cases available free online.

==Textbook bias on controversial topics==

In cases of history, science, current events, and political textbooks, &quot;the writer might be biased towards one way or another. Topics such as actions of a country, presidential actions, and scientific theories are common potential biases&quot;.

<doc id="254113" wikidata="Q384153" url="?curid=254113" title="Speedball (video game)">
<text>Speedball is a 1988 video game based on a violent futuristic sport that draws on elements of handball and ice hockey, and rewards violent play as well as goals.

&quot;Speedball&quot; was released in November 1988 for the Amiga and Atari ST and later ported to MS-DOS, Commodore 64, and the Master System. SOFEL released a port for the NES in 1991, as &quot;KlashBall&quot;. It was re-released in 2004 as one of the 30 games on the C64 Direct-to-TV.

==Gameplay==
The game is played by two teams on an enclosed court with a goal at each end, similar to that of ice hockey or five-a-side football. The court contains fixed bounce domes that modify the trajectory and speed of the ball, as well as one hole in the middle at each side where upon entering the ball will appear at the opposite side, keeping its momentum. The layout of the domes on the court changes as the player faces a different team, up to a maximum of 10 variations.

A player has control of only one outfield player on a team at any one time. The game may be played by one or two players; two player games are played competitively. Two game modes are supported: knockout (face increasingly tougher teams controlled by the computer in best of three matches) and league.

The game starts with the player(s) selecting a captain among three available choices, each starting with significantly more points than the other two in one of three stats: stamina, power and skill. All the members in a team start the game with the same stats. During the actual game, as team members hit opponents, the opponent loses a part of his stamina; when stamina drops low enough, that individual player will move slower than the rest. The more powerful a team member is, the more damage he will deliver with a direct hit. Extra skill on the other hand promotes aggression from any team member controlled by the computer towards the opposite team, and improves chances of a successful hit.

While in possession of the ball, the player can either press and immediately release the fire button to do a direct throw, or keep the button pressed to make the ball go higher. Players can then jump to try and catch it, but this makes them more vulnerable to being hit by the opposite team.

As the game progresses, coins and several power-ups appear randomly which can be collected. Power-ups include making the ball become electrified (the opposite team cannot pick it up and will be harmed if they try), and make it teleport to the player&#x27;s team member. Coins can be traded at the end of each game for different bonuses, such as extra time or several enhancements for all members in the player&#x27;s team, including a permanent increase to any of their stats. Computer-controlled players (either on the player or the computer&#x27;s side) cannot collect coins, but the active player controlled by the computer can collect power-ups. The team that has amassed the most goals at the end of the game is the winner.

==Reception==
&quot;Speedball&quot; received scores of 862 (MS-DOS) and 834 (Atari ST) out of 1000 from ACE, 79% from Mean Machines and 57% from Power Play. The game won the 1989 Golden Joystick Game Of The Year award. &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; gave the game a positive review, praising its graphics and long-lasting gameplay. It was also voted Best 16-bit Game of the Year at the Golden Joystick Awards.

The game&#x27;s Master System port was given a 90% by French magazine &quot;Joypad&quot;. &quot;The One&quot; magazine in 1991 rated the game five out of five stars for the Amiga, Atari ST and PC.

==Reviews==
* &quot;Jeux &amp; Stratégie&quot; #56

==Sequels==
&quot;Speedball&quot; was succeeded by &quot;Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe&quot;. &quot;Speedball 2&quot; had a greater and more lasting popularity than &quot;Speedball&quot;, and has been remade and republished a number of times.

<text>Folegandros (also Pholegandros; ) is a small Greek island in the Aegean Sea that, together with Sikinos, Ios, Anafi and Santorini, forms the southern part of the Cyclades. Its surface area is and it has 719 inhabitants (2021).
It has three small villages, Chora, Karavostasis, and Ano Meria, which are connected by a paved road. Folegandros is part of the Thira regional unit.

==Mythology==
According to Greek mythology, it was said to have derived its name from a son of Minos. 

==History ==
Little is known about the ancient history of Folegandros. Its inhabitants were Dorians. Later it came under Athenian rule. The island contained a &quot;polis&quot; (city-state) called Pholegandros, which was sited at the modern Chora and a member of the Delian League, as which it appears on Athenian tribute lists between 425/4 and 416/15 BCE. The island was called the iron Pholegandros by Aratus on account of its ruggedness, and is also noted by ancient geographers Strabo and Ptolemy, who calls it Pholekandros ().

The island was conquered in 1207 by the Venetian Marco Sanudo and remained under the rule of Venice until 1566, when it was taken by the Ottoman Turks. 

The Greeks reclaimed it in the 19th century during the Greek war of independence. The island was visited by the British explorers Theodore and Mabel Bent in early 1884. 

During the 20th century it has been used as a place of exile for political prisoners, especially during the 4th of August regime. 

==Geography==
Folegandros&#x27; landscape is varied, and includes tall cliffs and a large cave. The &quot;capital&quot; of the island, Chora, is built on the edge of a 200-metre high cliff. The port of Folegandros is the small village of Karavostasis. The Ano Meria village contains a small but interesting Ecological and Folklore Museum. Among the notable beaches on Folegandros is Katergo, accessible only by foot or by boat from Karavostasis. Katergo beach is used by naturists.

<text>Raymond Arthur Dart (4 February 1893 – 22 November 1988) was an Australian anatomist and anthropologist, best known for his involvement in the 1924 discovery of the first fossil found of &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot;, an extinct hominin closely related to humans, at Taung in the North of South Africa in the Northwest province.

==Early life==
Raymond Dart was born in Toowong, a suburb of Brisbane, Queensland, Australia, the fifth of nine children and son of a farmer and tradesman. His birth occurred during the 1893 flood, which filled his parents&#x27; home and shop in Toowong. The family moved alternately between their country property near Laidley and their shop in Toowong. The young Dart attended Toowong State School, Blenheim State School and earned a scholarship to Ipswich Grammar School from 1906 to 1909. Dart considered becoming a medical missionary to China and wished to study medicine at the University of Sydney, but his father argued that he should accept the scholarship he won to the newly established University of Queensland and study science. He was a member of the first intake of students to the university in 1911 and studied geology under H.C. Richards and zoology, taking his BSc in 1913. Dart became the first student to graduate with honours from the University of Queensland in 1914 and took his MSc with honours from UQ in 1916. He studied medicine at the University of Sydney taking his MB and M.Surgery in 1917, and conducting his residency at St Andrews College, University of Sydney. He was awarded his M.D. from the University of Sydney in 1927.

Dart served as a captain and medic in the Australian Army in England and France during the last year of World War I.

Following the war, he took up a position as a senior demonstrator at the University College, London in 1920 at the behest of Grafton Elliot Smith, famed anatomist, anthropologist and fellow Australian. This was followed by a year on a Rockefeller Foundation Fellowship at Washington University in St. Louis. Returning to England and work at the University College, London, he reluctantly took up the position of Professor at the newly established department of anatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1922, after encouragement from Elliot Smith and Sir Arthur Keith.

==Career==

In 1924, Dart discovered the first &quot;Australopithecus africanus&quot; fossil, an extinct hominin closely related to humans. His colleague, Professor Robert Burns Young from the Buxton Limeworks, had sent Dart two crates of fossils from the small town of Taung in the North West Province of South Africa. Upon seeing the fossils, Dart immediately recognised one as being an early human because its brain dimensions were too large for a baboon or chimpanzee. Blasting had exposed a breccia-filled cave and the child&#x27;s skull had come to light together with several fossilised monkeys and hyraxes. M. de Bruyn had noticed their unusual nature in November 1924 and informed the Limeworks manager, Mr. A.E. Spiers.

As Dart was not part of the scientific establishment, and because Raymond found the fossil in Africa, and not Europe or Asia, where the establishment supposed man&#x27;s origins, his findings were initially dismissed.

Dart&#x27;s closest ally was Robert Broom whose discoveries of further &quot;Australopithecines&quot; (as well as Wilfrid Le Gros Clark&#x27;s support) eventually vindicated Dart, so much so that in 1947 Sir Arthur Keith said &quot;...Dart was right, and I was wrong&quot;. Keith made this statement referring to his dismissal and scepticism of Dart&#x27;s analysis of the Taung Child as an early human ancestor; Keith thought that it was more likely to be an ape, yet later research by Broom confirmed Dart&#x27;s theories. Dart&#x27;s theories were also popularised by playwright, screenwriter, and science writer Robert Ardrey, first in an article published in &quot;The Reporter&quot; and reprinted in &quot;Science Digest&quot;, and later in Ardrey&#x27;s influential four-book Nature of Man Series, which began in 1961 with &quot;African Genesis&quot;.

Not all of Dart&#x27;s theories would in the end be vindicated. A number of his theories, including that of the killer ape, have been refuted. However, some of his ideas retain support. His work was clearly influenced by the mentors he worked with in his early career, in particular Grafton Elliot Smith.

===Neuroscience===
Dart proposed the idea of dual evolutionary origins of the neocortex. During his research in the 1930s in Africa, he studied the architecture of reptilian brains. He was able to identify a primordial neocortex, the oldest structure that can be considered as a neocortex, in a reptile. He identified a distinction between the cytoarchitecture in an area that split it into a para-hippocampal and a para-pyriform region.

==Personal life==
Dart married Dora Tyree, a medical student from Virginia, U.S., in 1921 in Woods Hole, Massachusetts, U.S., and they divorced in 1934. He married Marjorie Frew, head librarian at the University of Witwatersrand in Johannesburg, South Africa in 1936 and they had two children.

Dart died in Johannesburg in 1988.

==Legacy==
The Institute for the Study of Man in Africa was established in 1956 at Witwatersrand in his honour by Phillip Tobias. In 1964 the Raymond Dart Memorial Lecture was inaugurated at the Institute.

Dart was director of the School of Anatomy at the University of the Witwatersrand, Johannesburg until 1958. There he worked with Tobias, who continued his work in the study of the Cradle of Humankind and other paleoanthropological sites. In 1959, an autobiographical account of Dart&#x27;s discoveries, &quot;Adventures with the Missing Link,&quot; was published (with Dennis Craig as co-author). In the book he acknowledges the crucial role played by his first female student and demonstrator, Josephine Salmons. She brought to his attention the existence of a fossilised baboon skull at the house of Edwin Gilbert Izod, director of the Northern Lime Company and proprietor of a quarry in Taung. The skull was kept as an ornament on the mantlepiece above the fireplace at his home. In bringing the skull to show Dart, she set in motion a chain of events that led to the discovery of the &quot;child skull of Taung&quot;.

At the age of 73, Dart began dividing his time between South Africa and The Institutes for the Achievement of Human Potential (IAHP), an organisation founded by Glenn Doman that treats brain injured children. Dart&#x27;s son, Galen, had suffered motor damage during birth in 1941. Dart spent much of the next twenty years working with the IAHP.

<text>Laurence Housman (; 18 July 1865 – 20 February 1959) was an English playwright, writer and illustrator whose career stretched from the 1890s to the 1950s. He studied art in London and worked largely as an illustrator during the first years of his career, before shifting focus to writing. He was a younger brother of the poet A. E. Housman and his sister and fellow activist in the women&#x27;s suffrage movement was writer/illustrator Clemence Housman.

==Early life==
Laurence Housman was born in Bromsgrove, Worcestershire to Edward Housman, a solicitor and tax accountant, and Sarah Jane Housman (née Williams). He was one of seven children including an older brother and sister, the classical scholar and poet Alfred E. Housman and the writer and engraver Clemence Housman. In 1871 his mother died, and his father remarried to a cousin, Lucy Housman. Under the influence of their eldest brother, Alfred, Housman and his siblings enjoyed many creative pastimes amongst themselves, including poetry competitions, theatrical performances and a family magazine.

The Housmans suffered increasing financial distress as Edward’s business floundered and he succumbed to drinking and illnesses. Despite this, Housman and his brothers managed to receive an education at Bromsgrove School on scholarships. He and his sister Clemence attended a local art class in 1882, and in 1883 they each received a £200 inheritance, which they used to go to study art at the Lambeth School of Art and the Royal College of Art in London.

==Illustrating==
He first worked with London publishers by illustrating such works as George Meredith&#x27;s &quot;Jump to Glory Jane&quot; (1892), Jonas Lie&#x27;s &quot;Weird Tales&quot; (1892), Christina Rossetti&#x27;s &quot;Goblin Market&quot; (1893), Jane Barlow&#x27;s &quot;The End of Elfintown&quot; (1894) and his sister&#x27;s novella &quot;The Were-Wolf&quot; (1896) in an intricate Art Nouveau style. During this period, he also wrote and published several volumes of poetry and a number of hymns and carols.

==Writing==

Housman turned more and more to writing after his eyesight began to fail. 
His first literary success came with the novel &quot;An Englishwoman&#x27;s Love-letters&quot; (1900), published anonymously. He then turned to drama with &quot;Bethlehem&quot; (1902) and was to become best known and remembered as a playwright. His other dramatic works include &quot;Angels and Ministers&quot; (1921), &quot;Little Plays of St. Francis&quot; (1922) and &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; (1934) which was even staged on Broadway. Housman&#x27;s play, &quot;Pains and Penalties&quot;, about Queen Caroline, was produced by Edith Craig and the Pioneer Players.

Some of Housman&#x27;s plays were scandalous for depicting biblical characters and living members of the Royal House on stage, and many of them were performed only privately until the subsequent relaxation of theatrical censorship. In 1937 the Lord Chamberlain ruled that no British sovereign might be portrayed on the stage until 100 years after his or her accession. For this reason, &quot;Victoria Regina&quot; could not be staged until the centenary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession, 20 June 1937. This was a Sunday, so the premiere took place the next day.

Housman also wrote children&#x27;s fairy tales such as &quot;A Farm in Fairyland&quot; (1894) and fantasy stories with Christian undertones for adults, such as &quot;All-Fellows&quot; (1896), &quot;The Cloak of Friendship&quot; (1905), and &quot;Gods and Their Makers&quot; (1897).

A prolific writer with around a hundred published works to his name, his output eventually covered all kinds of literature from socialist and pacifist pamphlets to children&#x27;s stories. He wrote an autobiography, &quot;The Unexpected Years&quot; (1937), which, despite his record of controversial writing, said little about his homosexuality, the practice of which was then illegal.

After his brother&#x27;s A.E.&#x27;s death in 1936, Laurence was made literary executor, and over the next two years brought out further selections of poems from his brother&#x27;s manuscripts. His editorial work has been deprecated recently: &quot;The text of many poems was misrepresented: poems not completed by Housman were printed as though complete; versions he cancelled were reinstated; separate texts were conflated; and many poems were mistranscribed from the manuscripts.&quot;

==Activism==
=== Suffrage movement ===
Laurence Housman identified himself as a feminist, contributing mainly to the Suffrage movement in England. His activism was largely through works of art such as creating banners, creating propaganda, writing and contributing to women&#x27;s newspapers. However, he also participated in physical protests, frequently speaking at suffrage rallies. He took part in handing in a petition against force feeding, and was arrested during associated disturbances.

==== The Suffrage Atelier ====

Laurence Housman and his sister, Clemence Housman, founded the Suffrage Atelier in February 1909. This was a studio that produced artistic propaganda for the suffrage movement. The studio was located at his house, No. 1 Pembroke Cottage Kensington. Although there were other studios throughout England also creating propaganda for the suffrage movement such as the Artists’ Suffrage League and the Women’s Social and Political Union, the Suffrage Atelier was unique because they paid their artists by selling the work to the suffrage community. This studio was important not only in creating propaganda for the suffrage movement but because the creation of banners required collective work. This was significant as it created an environment for women to find other women. Additionally, work such as embroidery, which was known to be domestic, was utilized to propel a political movement and allowed women to earn money.

==== No. 1 Pembroke Cottage Kensington ====
Aside from his Suffrage Atelier studio, Housman opened his house to the suffrage movement and it quickly became a hub for the feminist movement. Along with housing the Suffrage Atelier studio, it additionally held educational classes to help women explore their feminist identities, bringing in public speakers and hosting writing lessons. The house was also used as a safe house on the night of the 1911 census, protecting women participating in the organized Census Boycott.

==== Art and design ====
&quot;The Anti-Suffrage Alphabet&quot; was a book designed by Housman that incorporated illustrations from several women, including Alice B. Woodward and Pamela Colman Smith, which worked to raise funds for the suffrage campaign. The main goal of the book was to criticize women’s disenfranchisement by mocking negative attitudes towards women.

&quot;From Prison to Citizenship&quot; was the first banner created by Housman as a contribution to the Women’s Social and Political Union. This banner was displayed at the Queen’s hall at an unveiling ceremony and has been used regularly by the Women’s Social and Political Union.

==== Writing ====
Housman incorporated his passion for writing in his work with the feminist movement. He was popular for taking other people’s work and giving it a feminist twist. For example, he read  “Tommy this Tommy that” by Rudyard Kipling as “Women this Women that” at a Hyde Park rally.

He also contributed to newspapers, advising women on how to protest; his advice can be found in the &quot;Women’s Freedom League.&quot; Additionally, a series of poems supporting the Suffragette movement was published in &quot;The Women’s Press&quot; as well as &quot;Votes for Women&quot;.

In 1911 the Census Boycott, a feminist movement with the goal of disrupting government processes, asked women to refuse to give their information for the census. The movement was advertised by Housman through a series of articles published in &quot;The Vote&quot;, in which he argued for the reasoning and tactical benefits of the proposal. He also wrote fiction supporting the movement, setting this series in a potential future where the boycott went well.

==== Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage ====

Housman believed men should be an active participant of the suffrage movement. Therefore, Housman along with Israel Zangwill, Henry Nevinson and Henry Brailsford formed the Men’s League for Women’s Suffrage to propel the movement. These four writers were able to successfully convince some men in the 1910 general election to write Vote for Women on their ballot. He was also active in another male feminist group, the Men’s Social and Political Union.

==== Economic beliefs ====
Housman thought economics was a central component working to oppress women. He believed the Suffragettes perceived masculinity to value market values while feminine values leaned to be more utopian and reflect collective values. The Suffrage movement, therefore, centred maternal values, de-individualizing the movement. This, was important as it helped break the stereotype that women, especially mothers, who were active in the movement, were bad citizens.

=== Other activism ===

==== Humanist movement ====

An atheist, Housman was a leading light of the British Ethical and humanist movements in his lifetime. A Vice President of the Ethical Union (today known as Humanists UK), &quot;Housman&#x27;s humanism was active and lifelong, evidenced by his myriad efforts towards equality and social reform, guided by reason and compassion,&quot; to which he donated 40 years of activism. In 1929, he also gave the Conway Hall Memorial Lecture on the topic of ‘The Religious Advance Towards Rationalism’ (using &quot;religious&quot; in the sense of &quot;organised&quot;, as in &quot;religious humanism&quot;).

Housman attributed his own loss of faith and adoption of humanist beliefs to his strict Victorian upbringing. He said: &quot;It was this sanction of obscurantism... which started the breach between myself and the narrow Conservatism of my upbringing. I could not feel that any social or religious system, which so sedulously refused to tell and to face the truth, deserved respect; and though for a while I still conformed, it was without heart or conviction.&quot; Later he opined that many in the Victorian era conformed to Christianity in name only, while acting on &quot;worldly&quot; convictions of right and wrong: &quot;One hears a good deal of talk nowadays about the decay of religion; and the Victorian age is spoken of as though it had been an age of faith. My own impression of it is that it combined much foolish superstition with a smug adaptation of Christianity to social convention and worldly ends.&quot;

==== His sexuality ====
Housman was openly homosexual and invested himself to help other homosexuals to be less stigmatized by society. To do so, he joined an organization called the Order of Chaeronea which was a secret society that worked to gain homosexuals social recognition. Additionally, he also was a founder of the British Society for the Study of Sex Psychology. This was an organization which aimed to advance sex reform hoping for a more open society regarding sexualities by breaking prejudices. It was originally known as the British Society of Psychiatry; however, Housman wanted it known as a society and had it changed. Housman also brought his artistic contributions to the fight of de-stigmatizing homosexuality. For example, he created pamphlets for the organization such as &quot;The Relation of Fellow-Feeling to Sex&quot;.

==== Peace Pledge Union ====
In 1945 he opened Housmans Bookshop in Shaftesbury Avenue, London, founded in his honour by the Peace Pledge Union, of which he was a sponsor. In 1959, shortly after his death, the shop moved to Caledonian Road, where it is still a source of literature on pacifism and other radical approaches to living.

==Later life==
After World War I, Laurence and Clemence left their Kensington home and moved to the holiday cottage which they had previously rented in the village of Ashley in Hampshire. They lived there until 1924, when they moved to Street, Somerset, where Laurence lived the last 35 years of his life.

==Posthumous recognition==
His name and picture (and those of 58 other women&#x27;s suffrage supporters) are on the plinth of the statue of Millicent Fawcett in Parliament Square, London, unveiled in 2018.

== Collections ==
University College London holds c.450 volumes of Housman&#x27;s works. The collection formed part of the holdings of Ian Kenyur-Hodgkins, an antiquarian bookseller whose material was purchased by the University in 1978.

The Harry Ransom Center at the University of Texas holds an archive of Housman&#x27;s material which includes manuscripts and correspondence.
