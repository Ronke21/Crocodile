<text>The Gorbals is an area in the city of Glasgow, Scotland, and former burgh, on the south bank of the River Clyde. By the late 19th century, it had become densely populated; rural migrants and immigrants were attracted by the new industries and employment opportunities of Glasgow. At its peak during the 1930s, the wider Gorbals district (which includes the directly adjoined localities of Laurieston and Hutchesontown) had swollen in population to an estimated 90,000 residents, giving the area a very high population density of around 40,000/km2. 

Redevelopment after the Second World War has taken many turns, and the area&#x27;s population is substantially smaller in the 21st century. The wider Gorbals area was home to 16 high-rise public housing apartment blocks in the 1960s and 1970; only six are still standing, with two more planned for demolition around Easter 2025.

==Meaning of placename==
The name is first documented in the 15th and 16th centuries as &quot;Gorbaldis&quot;, and its etymology is unclear. It may be related to the Ecclesiastical Latin word (&#x27;sheaf&#x27;), found in the Scottish Gaelic term (&#x27;tenth sheaf&#x27;), a tithe of corn given to a parish rector. The taking of was a right given to George Elphinstone in 1616 as part of his 19-year (&#x27;lease&#x27;). The place name would therefore mean &#x27;the Sheaves&#x27;. The name is similar to a Lowland Scots word (&#x27;unfledged bird&#x27;), perhaps a reference to lepers who were allowed to beg for alms in public. (&#x27;garden of the town&#x27;) conforms with certain suggestions made by A.G. Callant in 1888, but other interpretations are also popular.

The village of Gorbals, known once as Bridgend, being at the south end of the bridge over the Clyde towards Glasgow Cross, had been pastoral with some early trading and mining. Thanks to the inventions of James Watt and others, the Industrial Revolution resulted in a major expansion of Glasgow during the nineteenth century. 

In 1846 the city absorbed Gorbals. It then had a population of some 3,000. Many adults worked in cotton spinning and weaving factories, ironworks, and engineering. Increasingly in the 19th and 20th centuries, the area attracted numerous rural migrants from the surrounding countryside, including the Scottish Highlands, and immigrants from Ireland, Italy, Eastern and Central Europe, who found jobs to meet the needs of industrial capital.

==History==
Govan parish was one of the oldest possessions of the church in the region. The &quot;merk&quot; land of &quot;Brigend and Gorbaldis&quot; is referred to in several sources. The village of Brigend was named after the bridge which Bishop William Rae had built in 1345 over the River Clyde; it lasted until the 19th century. 

Lady Marjorie Stewart of Lochow was said to have had a hospital built for lepers and dedicated to St Ninian in 1350, although this year is contested by current historians&#x27; estimates dating her life and activities. The lands on which the hospital was built were named St Ninian&#x27;s Croft. They were later incorporated into Hutchesontown.

After the Protestant Reformation, in 1579 the church granted the land for ground rents (&quot;feued&quot; the land) to Sir George Elphinstone, a merchant who was Provost of Glasgow (1600–1606). The barony and regality of the Gorbals was confirmed in 1606 by a charter of King James VI, which vested Elphinstone&#x27;s son, also named George, and his descendants. These powers descended to Sir Robert Douglas of Blackerstone, who in 1650 &quot;disponed&quot; (legally transferred) the Gorbals to Glasgow&#x27;s magistrates for the benefit of the city, the Trades&#x27; House, and Hutchesons&#x27; Hospital. The magistrates from then on collected the rents and duties and divided them: one fourth to the city, one fourth to the Trades&#x27; House, and the remaining half to Hutchesons&#x27; Hospital.

In 1790 the lands were divided into lots for development; the city acquired the old &quot;feus&quot; of Gorbals and Bridgend, and also the Kingston portion of the Barony of Gorbals. The Trades&#x27; House obtained a western section; and the remaining section lying to the east and south was allocated to Hutchesons&#x27; Hospital. The Hutcheson&#x27;s Trust sub-feud a portion of their lands to an ambitious builder, James Laurie. (His grave, along with those of many other builders of Gorbals, is marked with well-carved masons&#x27; implements, indicating his Master status. The gravestones are visible at the Burial Ground, established in 1715 and now called the Gorbals Rose Garden). Laurie built the first house in St Ninian Street in 1794.

The districts are now known as the Gorbals, Laurieston, Tradeston, Kingston and Hutchesontown. The Little Govan estate, including a small village of the same name, were replaced by the eastern parts of Hutchesontown and Oatlands. 

By the late 19th century, The Gorbals was a successful industrial suburb, and attracted many Protestant and Catholic immigrants from Ireland, especially from Ulster (in particular from County Donegal), and Italy, as well as Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire and Eastern Europe. At one time most of the Jews in Scotland resided in this area. Industrial decay and over-population overwhelmed the area, which became a centre of poverty in the early 20th century. Gorbals railway station opened on 1 September 1877. Changes in the area meant a decrease in business, and it closed to passengers permanently on 1 June 1928.

In the 1870s, the City Improvement Trust cleared away the old Gorbals village and redeveloped the area to form the new Gorbals Cross, at the same time developing new workers&#x27; tenements around the former Oatlands Square.

Much of the early Gorbals village was replaced by modern tenements in the street grid system being adopted in the city centre and notably in the south side, including neighbouring Tradeston, Kinning Park and Hutchesontown. Along the riverside the classical terraces of Laurieston had taken shape.
By 1914, the population of Gorbals and Hutchesontown was working locally and in commerce in the city centre, factories and warehouses nearby of carpetmaking, garment making, food manufacturing, ironworks, chemical works, railways, docks, shipping, construction and engineering. The area supported some 16 schools, 15 churches, three synagogues, swimming baths and libraries, and a range of picture-houses, dance halls and two theatres. One theatre, the Royal Princess, has survived as the Citizens Theatre today. 

Of the suburb&#x27;s 19,000 houses, 48% were now classed as overcrowded. To remedy over-crowding and lack of modern facilities for water and sanitation within houses, local authority housing was started in the 1920s on new areas being brought in by the city&#x27;s expansion of boundaries. The combination of redevelopment and loss of industrial jobs resulted in the population of Gorbals and Hutchesontown falling by 21% between 1921 and 1951. By 1964 there were 12,200 houses.

As took place in London and other major cities, in the post-war planning of the 1950s, Glasgow Corporation joined with other authorities in deciding to demolish much sub-standard housing of inner districts including Gorbals and Hutchesontown. Families were dispersed to new outlying housing estates such as Castlemilk, in overspill agreements with New Towns such as East Kilbride. Other families were rehoused within the area but in huge, concrete, multi-storey towers. These changes broke up many close-knit communities, adding to the residents&#x27; distress.
Glasgow Corporation&#x27;s replacement of old, outdated and crowded housing with new high-rise towers of social housing in the 1960s greatly improved some physical conditions but had adverse social consequences. Lack of awareness of the effects of concentrating families resulted in poor design. The low-quality construction of the concrete, 20-storey flats led to various social and health problems among the residents. Many of the blocks developed mould and structural problems. Their designs prevented residents from visually controlling their internal and external spaces, adding to issues of social dysfunction. The Queen Elizabeth Square flats, designed by Sir Basil Spence, were demolished in 1993 to make way for a new generation of housing development.

In 2004, Glasgow Housing Association announced plans to demolish more of the decaying high-rise blocks, and to comprehensively refurbish and re-clad others. Two of the Area D blocks (Caledonia Road), as well as the entire Area E (Sandiefield) and Laurieston (Stirlingfauld / Norfolk Court) high-rise estates, were demolished between 2002 and 2016. In 2021, it was announced that the two remaining Area D multi storey blocks would also be condemned. The Area B or &quot;Riverside&quot; estate, designed by Robert Matthew, will be the only high-rise flats left in the wider Gorbals area. New housing has been developed at lower density, 
Since the late 20th century, much of the area, particularly Hutchesontown, was comprehensively redeveloped for a third time. It has included a mix of private (market rate) and social housing, with design elements to encourage residents&#x27; and public safety. Earlier phases of this recent redevelopment tended toward yellow-brick reinterpretations of traditional tenements, in a post-modern style. The neighbouring Govanhill district to the south (whose residents observed the demolition/modernisation in nearby areas such as the Gorbals and Pollokshaws with suspicion and successfully opposed the same fate befalling their homes, although they faced other challenges to improve their living conditions) offers some reminder of how the district used to look prior to its redevelopment. The tenement buildings faced directly onto the street, connecting the residents to the community. Since the late 1990s, some neighbourhoods have been redeveloped as terraces of tenements in that style.

More recent phases, planned by Piers Gough, have employed noted modern architects such as Page/Park, Elder &amp; Cannon and CZWG, resulting in more bold and radical designs. Innovative street plans and high-quality landscaping have been added, incorporating many pieces of public art. The Gorbals Leisure Centre opened in January 2000. The number of shopping facilities in the area is on the rise. In 2005, fire destroyed the Catholic Church of Blessed John Duns Scotus as a result of a fallen candle. The church was restored and reopened for worship in September 2010. 

After much of the Hutchesontown area of the Gorbals was improved, the urban and social-regeneration program expanded into the neighbouring Laurieston area to the west.

In the early 2000s, a local heritage group started a campaign to reinstate the Gorbals Cross fountain, aided by people attracted to the group&#x27;s Facebook page, known as Old Gorbals Pictures (Heritage Group). The group have discovered that a copy of the original fountain was installed on the Caribbean island of St Kitts &amp; Nevis. They are working to engage professional help to digitally scan this object to allow for the manufacture of &#x27;Gorbals Cross, No 3&#x27;, to be installed in a new development near to where it originally stood.

Since 1945, the Citizens Theatre has been based in the area at the former Royal Princess&#x27;s Theatre, an historic Victorian building. The area also has a local newspaper &quot;Local News for Southsiders&quot;. The area is served by Bridge Street and West Street subway stations and numerous bus routes.

One of the few buildings to survive the mid-20th century redevelopment is a pub called The Brazen Head, located at the northern end of Cathcart Road. Formerly a railway pub known as the Granite City, much of its clientele is Celtic F.C. supporters. They have been associated with Irish Republicanism. Nearby is the architectural masterpiece of the Caledonia Road Church, a Category A-listed mid-Victorian structure with remaining walls and tower designed by Alexander &quot;Greek&quot; Thomson.

<doc id="249471" wikidata="Q7539285" url="?curid=249471" title="Slavery in the colonial history of the United States">
<text>The institution of slavery in the European colonies in North America, which eventually became part of the United States of America, developed due to a combination of factors. Primarily, the labor demands for establishing and maintaining European colonies resulted in the Atlantic slave trade. Slavery existed in every European colony in the Americas during the early modern period, and both Africans and indigenous peoples were targets of enslavement by Europeans during the era.

As the Spaniards, French, Dutch, and British gradually established colonies in North America from the 16th century onward, they began to enslave indigenous people, using them as forced labor to help develop colonial economies. As indigenous peoples suffered massive population losses due to imported diseases, Europeans quickly turned to importing slaves from Africa, primarily to work on slave plantations that produced cash crops. The enslavement of indigenous people in North America was later replaced during the 18th century by the enslavement of black African people. Concurrent with the development of slavery, racist ideology was developed among Europeans, the rights of free people of color in European colonies were curtailed, slaves were legally defined as chattel property, and the condition of slavery as hereditary.

The Thirteen Colonies of northern British America, were for much or all of the period less dependent on slavery than the Caribbean colonies, or those of New Spain, or Brazil, and slavery did not develop significantly until later in the colonial era. Nonetheless, slavery was legal in every colony prior to the American Revolutionary War (1775-1783), and was most prominent in the Southern Colonies (as well as, the southern Mississippi River and Florida colonies of France, Spain, and Britain), which by then developed large slave-based plantation systems. Slavery in Europe&#x27;s North American colonies which did not have warm climates and ideal conditions for plantations to exist primarily took the form of domestic labor or doing other forms of unpaid work alongside non-enslaved counterparts. The American Revolution led to the first abolition laws in the Americas, although the institution of chattel slavery would continue to exist and expand across the Southern United States until finally being abolished at the time of the American Civil War in 1865.
==Native Americans==


Native Americans enslaved members of their own and other tribes, usually as a result of taking captives in raids and warfare, both before and after Europeans arrived. This practice continued into the 1800s. In some cases, especially for young women or children, Native American families adopted captives to replace members they had lost. Among those native to the modern Southeastern United States, the children of slaves were considered free. Slaves included captives from wars and slave raids; captives bartered from other tribes, sometimes at great distances; children sold by their parents during famines; and men and women who staked themselves in gambling when they had nothing else, which put them into servitude in some cases for life.

In three expeditions between 1514 and 1525, Spanish explorers visited the Carolinas and enslaved Native Americans, who they took to their base on Santo Domingo. The Spanish Crown&#x27;s charter for its 1526 colony in the Carolinas and Georgia was more restrictive. It required that Native Americans be treated well, paid, and converted to Christianity, but it also allowed already enslaved Native Americans to be bought and exported to the Caribbean if they had been enslaved by other Native Americans. This colony did not survive, so it is not clear if it exported any slaves. Native Americans were enslaved by the Spanish in Florida under the encomienda system. New England and the Carolinas captured Native Americans in wars and distributed them as slaves. Native Americans captured and enslaved some early European explorers and colonists.

Larger societies structured as chiefdoms kept slaves as unpaid field laborers. In band societies, owning enslaved captives attested to the captor&#x27;s military prowess. Some war captives were subjected to ritualized torture and execution. Alan Gallay and other historians emphasize differences between Native American enslavement of war captives and the European slave trading system, into which numerous native peoples were integrated. Richard White, in &quot;The Middle Ground&quot;, elucidates the complex social relationships between Native American groups and the early empires, including &#x27;slave&#x27; culture and scalping. Robbie Ethridge states, Let there be no doubt...that the commercial trade in Indian slaves was not a continuation and adaptation of pre-existing captivity patterns. It was a new kind of slave, requiring a new kind of occupational specialty ... organized militaristic slavers.

One example of militaristic slaving can be seen in Nathaniel Bacon&#x27;s actions in Virginia during the late 1670s. In June 1676, the Virginia assembly granted Bacon and his men what equated to a slave-hunting license by providing that any enemy Native Americans caught were to be slaves for life. They also provided soldiers who had captured Native Americans with the right to &quot;reteyne and keepe all such Indian slaves or other Indian goods as they either have taken or hereafter shall take.&quot; By this order, the assembly had made a public decision to enslave Native Americans. In the years to follow, other laws resulted in Native Americans being grouped with other non-Christian servants who had been imported to the colonies (Negro slaves) as slaves for life.

Puritan New England, Virginia, Spanish Florida, and the Carolina colonies engaged in large-scale enslavement of Native Americans, often through the use of Indian proxies to wage war and acquire the slaves. In New England, slave raiding accompanied the Pequot War and King Philip&#x27;s War but declined after the latter war ended in 1676. Enslaved Native Americans were in Jamestown from the early years of the settlement, but large-scale cooperation between slave-trading English colonists and the Westo and Occaneechi peoples, whom they armed with guns, did not begin until the 1640s. These groups conducted enslaving raids in what is now Georgia, Tennessee, North Carolina, South Carolina, Florida, and possibly Alabama. The Carolina slave trade, which included both trading and direct raids by colonists, was the largest among the British colonies in North America, estimated at 24,000 to 51,000 Native Americans by Gallay.

Historian Ulrich Phillips argues that Africans were inculcated as slaves and the best answer to the labor shortage in the New World because Native American slaves were more familiar with the environment, and would often successfully escape into the frontier territory they knew. Africans had more difficulty surviving in unknown territory. Africans were also more familiar with large scale indigo and rice cultivation, of which Native Americans were unfamiliar. The early colonial America depended heavily on rice and indigo cultivation producing disease-carrying mosquitoes caused malaria, a disease the Africans were far less susceptible to than Native American slaves.


During the 17th and 18th centuries, Native American slavery, the enslavement of Native Americans by European colonists, was common. Many of these Native slaves were exported to the Northern colonies and to off-shore colonies, especially the &quot;sugar islands&quot; of the Caribbean. The exact number of Native Americans who were enslaved is unknown because vital statistics and census reports were at best infrequent. Historian Alan Gallay has estimated that from 1670 to 1715, slave traders in the Province of Carolina sold between 24,000 and 51,000 Native Americans into slavery as part of the Indian slave trade in the American Southeast. Andrés Reséndez estimates that between 147,000 and 340,000 Native Americans were enslaved in North America, excluding Mexico. Even after the Indian Slave Trade ended in 1750 the enslavement of Native Americans continued in the west, and also in the Southern states mostly through kidnappings.

Slavery of Native Americans was organized in colonial and Mexican California through Franciscan missions, theoretically entitled to ten years of Native labor, but in practice maintaining them in perpetual servitude, until their charge was revoked in the mid-1830s. Following the 1847–48 invasion by U.S. troops, the &quot;loitering or orphaned Indians&quot; were de facto enslaved in the new state from statehood in 1850 to 1867. Slavery required the posting of a bond by the slave holder and enslavement occurred through raids and a four-month servitude imposed as a punishment for Indian &quot;vagrancy&quot;.

==The first enslaved Africans==
===Carolinas===
The first African slaves in what would become the present-day United States of America arrived in Puerto Rico in the early 16th century, at the hands of the Portuguese. The island&#x27;s native population was conquered by the Spanish settler Juan Ponce de León with the help of a free West African conquistador, Juan Garrido, by 1511. The slave population on the island grew after the Spanish crown granted import rights to its citizens, but did not reach its peak until the 18th century. African slaves arrived on August 9, 1526, in Winyah Bay (off the coast of present-day South Carolina) with a Spanish expedition. Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón brought 600 colonists to start a colony at San Miguel de Gualdape. Records say the colonists included enslaved Africans, without saying how many. After a month Ayllón moved the colony to what is now Georgia.

Until the early 18th century, enslaved Africans were difficult to acquire in the British mainland colonies. Most were sold from Africa to the West Indies for the labor-intensive sugar trade. The large plantations and high mortality rates required continued importation of slaves. One of the first major centers of African slavery in the English North American colonies occurred with the founding of Charles Town and the Province of Carolina (later, South Carolina) in 1670. The colony was founded mainly by sugar planters from Barbados, who brought relatively large numbers of African slaves from that island to develop new plantations in the Carolinas.

To meet agricultural labor needs, colonists also practiced Indian slavery for some time. The Carolinians transformed the Indian slave trade during the late 17th and early 18th centuries by treating such slaves as a trade commodity to be exported, mainly to the West Indies. Historian Alan Gallay estimates that between 1670 and 1715, an estimated 24,000 to 51,000 captive Native Americans were exported from South Carolina to the Caribbean. This was a much higher number than the number of Africans imported to the English mainland colonies during the same period.

In 1733, royal governor George Burrington complained that no ships brought their slave cargoes from Africa directly to the Province of North Carolina.

===Georgia===
The first African slaves in what is now Georgia arrived in mid-September 1526 with Lucas Vázquez de Ayllón&#x27;s establishment of San Miguel de Gualdape for the Spanish Crown. They rebelled and lived with indigenous people, destroying the Spanish colony in less than two months.

Two centuries later, the Province of Georgia was the last of Britain&#x27;s Thirteen Colonies to be established and the farthest south. (Florida, a possession of Spain, lay just to its south). Founded in 1733, British Georgia and its powerful backers did not necessarily object to slavery as an institution, but their business model relied first on labor from Britain (primarily England&#x27;s poor). The British were also concerned with security, given the closeness of Spanish Florida and Spain&#x27;s regular offers to enemy-slaves to revolt or escape. Despite support for slavery, it was not until the defeat of the Spanish by Georgia&#x27;s British colonials in the 1740s (Battle of Bloody Marsh) that arguments for opening the colony to slavery intensified. To staff Georgia&#x27;s new rice plantations and settlements, the colony&#x27;s proprietors relented in 1751, and African slavery grew quickly. After becoming a British royal colony in the 1760s, Georgia began importing slaves directly from Africa.

===Florida===
One African slave, Estevanico arrived with the Narváez expedition in Tampa Bay in April 1528 and marched north with the expedition until September, when they embarked on rafts from the Wakulla River, heading for Mexico.
African slaves arrived again in Florida in 1539 with Hernando de Soto, and in the 1565 founding of St. Augustine, Florida.
When St. Augustine was founded in 1565, the site already had enslaved Native Americans, whose ancestors had migrated from Cuba. The Spanish settlement was sparse and they held comparatively few slaves.

The Spanish promised freedom to refugee slaves from the English colonies of South Carolina and Georgia in order to destabilize English settlement. If the slaves converted to Catholicism and agreed to serve in a militia for Spain, they could become Spanish citizens. By 1730 the black settlement known as Fort Mose developed near St. Augustine and was later fortified. There were two known Fort Mose sites in the eighteenth century, and the men helped defend St. Augustine against the British. It is &quot;the only known free black town in the present-day southern United States that a European colonial government-sponsored. The Fort Mose Site, today a National Historic Landmark, is the location of the second Fort Mose.&quot; During the nineteenth century, this site became marsh and wetlands.

In 1763, Great Britain took over Florida in an exchange with Spain after defeating France in the Seven Years&#x27; War. Spain evacuated its citizens from St. Augustine, including the residents of Fort Mose, transporting them to Cuba. As British colonists developed the colony for plantation agriculture, the percentage of slaves in the population in twenty years rose from 18% to almost 65% by 1783.

===Texas and the southwest===
An African slave, Estevanico, reached Galveston island in November 1528, with the remnants of the Narváez expedition in Florida. The group headed south on the mainland in 1529, trying to reach Spanish settlements. They were captured and held by Native Americans until 1535.
They traveled northwest to the Pacific Coast, then south along the coast to San Miguel de Culiacán, which had been founded in 1531, and then to Mexico City.

Spanish Texas had few African slaves, but the colonists enslaved many Native Americans.
Beginning in 1803, Spain freed slaves who escaped from the Louisiana territory, recently acquired by the United States. More African-descended slaves were brought to Texas by American settlers.

===Virginia and Chesapeake Bay===
The first recorded Africans in Virginia arrived in late August 1619. The &quot;White Lion&quot;, a privateer ship owned by Robert Rich, 2nd Earl of Warwick but flying a Dutch flag, docked at what is now Old Point Comfort (located in modern-day Hampton) with approximately 20 Africans. They were captives from the area of present-day Angola and had been seized by the privateer&#x27;s crew from a Portuguese slave ship, the &quot;São João Bautista&quot;. To obtain the Africans, the Jamestown colony traded provisions with the ship. Some number of these individuals appear to have been treated like indentured servants, since slave laws were not passed until later, in 1641 in Massachusetts and in 1661 in Virginia. But from the beginning, in accordance with the custom of the Atlantic slave trade, most of this relatively small group, appear to have been treated as slaves, with &quot;African&quot; or &quot;negro&quot; becoming synonymous with &quot;slave&quot;. Virginia enacted laws concerning runaway slaves and &#x27;negroes&#x27; in 1672.

Some number of the colony&#x27;s early Africans earned freedom by fulfilling a work contract or for converting to Christianity. At least one of these, Anthony Johnson, in turn, acquired slaves or indentured servants for workers himself. Historians such as Edmund Morgan say this evidence suggests that racial attitudes were much more flexible in early 17th-century Virginia than they would later become. A 1625 census recorded 23 Africans in Virginia. In 1649 there were 300, and in 1690 there were 950. Over this period, legal distinctions between white indentured servants and &quot;Negros&quot; widened into lifelong and inheritable chattel-slavery for Africans and people of African descent.

===New England===
The 1677 work &quot;&quot; documented how hundreds of Praying Indians, who were allied with the New England Colonies, were enslaved and sent to the West Indies in the aftermath of King Philip&#x27;s War by the colonists. Captive indigenous opponents, including women and children, were also sold into slavery at a substantial profit, to be transported to West Indies colonies.

African and Native American slaves made up a smaller part of the New England economy, which was based on yeoman farming and trades, than in the South, and a smaller fraction of the population, but they were present. Most were house servants, but some worked at farm labor. The Puritans codified slavery in 1641. The Massachusetts Bay royal colony passed the &quot;Body of Liberties&quot;, which prohibited slavery in some instances, but did allow three legal bases of slavery. Slaves could be held if they were captives of war, if they sold themselves into slavery, were purchased from elsewhere, or if they were sentenced to slavery by the governing authority. The Body of Liberties used the word &quot;strangers&quot; to refer to people bought and sold as slaves, as they were generally not native born English subjects. Colonists came to equate this term with Native Americans and Africans.

The New Hampshire General Court passed &quot;An Act To Prevent Disorders In The Night&quot; in 1714, prefiguring the development of sundown towns in the United States: Notices emphasizing and re-affirming the curfew were published in &quot;The New Hampshire Gazette&quot; in 1764 and 1771.

===New York and New Jersey===
The Dutch West India Company introduced slavery in 1625 with the importation of eleven enslaved blacks who worked as farmers, fur traders, and builders to New Amsterdam (present day New York City), capital of the nascent province of New Netherland. The Dutch colony expanded across the North River (Hudson River) to Bergen (in today&#x27;s New Jersey). Later, slaves were also held privately by settlers in the area. Although enslaved, the Africans had a few basic rights and families were usually kept intact. They were admitted to the Dutch Reformed Church and married by its ministers, and their children could be baptized. Slaves could testify in court, sign legal documents, and bring civil actions against whites. Some were permitted to work after hours earning wages equal to those paid to white workers. When the colony fell to the English in the 1660s, the company freed all its slaves, which created an early nucleus of free Negros in the area.

The English continued to import slaves to New York. Slaves in the colony performed a wide variety of skilled and unskilled jobs, mostly in the burgeoning port city and surrounding agricultural areas. In 1703 more than 42% of New York City&#x27;s households held slaves, a percentage higher than in the cities of Boston and Philadelphia, and second only to Charleston in the South.

===Midwest, Mississippi River, and Louisiana===

The French introduced legalized slavery into their colonies in New France both near the Great Lakes and the Mississippi River. They also used slave labor on their island colonies in the Caribbean: Guadeloupe and especially Saint-Domingue. After the port of New Orleans was founded in 1718 with access to the Gulf Coast, French colonists imported more African slaves to the Illinois Country for use as agricultural or mining laborers. By the mid-eighteenth century, slaves accounted for as much as one-third of the limited population in that rural area.

Slavery was much more extensive in lower colonial Louisiana, where the French developed sugar cane plantations along the Mississippi River. Slavery was maintained during the French (1699–1763, and 1800–1803) and Spanish (1763–1800) periods of government. The first people enslaved by the French were Native Americans, but they could easily escape into the countryside which they knew well. Beginning in the early 18th century, the French imported Africans as laborers in their efforts to develop the colony. Mortality rates were high for both colonists and Africans, and new workers had to be regularly imported.

Implemented in colonial Louisiana in 1724, Louis XIV of France&#x27;s &quot;Code Noir&quot; regulated the slave trade and the institution of slavery in the French colonies. As a result, Louisiana and the Mobile, Alabama areas developed very different patterns of slavery compared to the British colonies.

As written, the &quot;Code Noir&quot; gave some rights to slaves, including the right to marry. Although it authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners to torture slaves, to separate married couples, and to separate young children from their mothers. It required owners to instruct slaves in the Catholic faith, implying that Africans were human beings endowed with a soul, an idea that had not been acknowledged until then.

The &quot;Code Noir&quot; forbade interracial marriages, but interracial relationships were formed in La Louisiane from the earliest years. In New Orleans society particularly, a formal system of concubinage, known as &quot;plaçage&quot;, developed. Usually formed between young white men and African or African-American women, these relationships were formalized with contracts that sometimes provided for freedom for a woman and her children (if she was still enslaved), education for the mixed-race children of the union, especially boys; and sometimes a property settlement. Free people of color became an intermediate social caste between whites and enslaved blacks; many practiced artisan trades, and some acquired educations and property. Some white fathers sent their mixed-race sons to France for education in military schools.

Gradually in the English colonies, slavery became known as a racial caste system that generally encompassed all people of African descent, including those of mixed race. From 1662, Virginia defined social status by the status of the mother, unlike in England, where under common law fathers determined the status of their children, whether legitimate or natural. Thus, under the doctrine of &quot;partus sequitur ventrum&quot;, children born to enslaved mothers were considered slaves, regardless of their paternity. Similarly, children born to mothers who were free were also free, whether or not of mixed-race. At one time, Virginia had prohibited enslavement of Christian individuals, but lifted that restriction with its 1662 law. In the 19th century, laws were passed to restrict the rights of free people of color and mixed-race people (sometimes referred to as mulattoes) after early slave revolts. During the centuries of slavery in the British colonies, the number of mixed-race slaves increased.

==Slave rebellions==

Colonial slave rebellions before 1776, or before 1801 for Louisiana, include:
* San Miguel de Gualdape (1526)
* Gloucester County, Virginia Revolt (1663)
* New York Slave Revolt of 1712
* Samba Rebellion (1731)
* Stono Rebellion (1739)
* New York Slave Insurrection of 1741
* 1791 Mina conspiracy
* Pointe Coupée conspiracy (1794)

==16th century==
While the British knew about Spanish and Portuguese slave trading, they did not implement slave labor in the Americas until the 17th century. British travelers were fascinated by the dark-skinned people they found in West Africa; they developed mythologies that situated them in their view of the cosmos. The first Africans to arrive in England came voluntarily in 1555 with John Lok (an ancestor of the famous philosopher John Locke). Lok intended to teach them English in order to facilitate the trading of material goods with West Africa. This model gave way to a slave trade initiated by John Hawkins, who captured 300 Africans and sold them to the Spanish. Blacks in England were marginalized but remained free, as slavery was never authorized by law in England.

In 1607, the English established Jamestown as their first permanent colony on the North American continent. Tobacco became the chief commodity crop of the colony, due to the efforts of John Rolfe in 1611. Once it became clear that tobacco was going to drive the Jamestown economy, more workers were needed for the labor-intensive crop. British plantation owners in North America and the Caribbean also needed a workforce for their cash crop plantations, which was initially filled by indentured servants from Britain before transitioning to Native American and West African slave labor. During this period, the English established colonies in Barbados in 1624 and Jamaica in 1655. These and other Caribbean colonies generated wealth by the production of sugar cane, as sugar was in high demand in Europe. They also were an early center of the slave trade for the growing English colonial empire.

English colonists entertained two lines of thought simultaneously toward indigenous Native Americans. Because these people were lighter-skinned, they were seen as more European and therefore as candidates for civilization. At the same time, because they were occupying the land desired by colonists, they were from the beginning, frequent targets of colonial violence. At first, indentured servants were used for labor. These servants provided up to seven years of service in exchange for having their trip to Jamestown paid for by someone in Jamestown. The person who paid was granted additional land in headrights, dependent on how many persons he paid to travel to the colony. Once the seven years were over, the indentured servant who survived was free to live in Jamestown as a regular citizen. However, colonists began to see indentured servants as too costly, in part because the high mortality rate meant the force had to be resupplied. In addition, an improving economy in England reduced the number of persons who were willing to sign up as indentured servants for the harsh conditions in the colonies.

==17th century==
In 1619, the English privateer &quot;White Lion&quot;, with Dutch letters of marque, brought 20 Africans seized Portuguese slave ship to Point Comfort. Several colonial colleges held enslaved people as workers and relied on them to operate.

===The development of slavery in 17th-century America===
The laws relating to slavery and their enforcement hardened in the second half of the 17th century, and the prospects for Africans and their descendants grew increasingly dim. By 1640, the Virginia courts had sentenced at least one black servant, John Punch, to slavery. In 1656 Elizabeth Key won a suit for freedom based on her father&#x27;s status as a free Englishman, his having baptized her as Christian in the Church of England, and the fact that he established a guardianship for her that was supposed to be a limited indenture. Following her case, in 1662 the Virginia House of Burgesses passed a law with the doctrine of &quot;partus&quot;, stating that any child born in the colony would follow the status of its mother, bond or free. This overturned a long held principle of English common law, whereby a child&#x27;s status followed that of the father. It removed any responsibility for the children from white fathers who had abused and raped slave women. Most did not acknowledge, support, or emancipate their resulting children.

During the second half of the 17th century, the British economy improved and the supply of British indentured servants declined, as poor Britons had better economic opportunities at home. At the same time, Bacon&#x27;s Rebellion of 1676 led the planter class to worry about the prospective dangers of creating a large class of restless, landless, and relatively poor white men (most of them former indentured servants). Wealthy Virginia and Maryland planters began to buy slaves in preference to indentured servants during the 1660s and 1670s, and poorer planters followed suit by c.1700. (Slaves cost more than servants, so initially only the wealthy could invest in slaves.) The first European colonists in Carolina introduced African slavery into the colony in 1670, the year the colony was founded, and Charleston ultimately became the busiest slave port in North America. Slavery spread from the South Carolina Lowcountry first to Georgia, then across the Deep South as Virginia&#x27;s influence had crossed the Appalachians to Kentucky and Tennessee. Northerners also purchased slaves, though on a much smaller scale. Enslaved people outnumbered free whites in South Carolina from the early 1700s to the Civil War. An authoritarian political culture evolved to prevent slave rebellion and justify white slaveholding. Northern slaves typically dwelled in towns, rather than on plantations as in the South, and worked as artisans and artisans&#x27; assistants, sailors and longshoremen, and domestic servants.

In 1672, King Charles II of England rechartered the Royal African Company (which had been originally established in 1660), granting the company an exclusive monopoly on all English trade with Africa, which included the slave trade. This monopoly was overturned by an Act of Parliament in 1697. The slave trade to the mid-Atlantic colonies increased substantially in the 1680s, and by 1710 the African population in Virginia had increased to 23,100 (42% of total); Maryland contained 8,000 Africans (23% of total). During the early 18th century, Britain passed Spain and Portugal to become the world&#x27;s leading slave-trading nation.

The North American royal colonies not only imported Africans but also captured Native Americans, impressing them into slavery. Many Native Americans were shipped as slaves to the Caribbean. Many of these slaves from the British colonies were able to escape by heading south, to the Spanish colony of Florida. There they were given their freedom if they declared their allegiance to the King of Spain and accepted the Catholic Church. In 1739 Fort Mose was established by African-American freedmen and became the northern defense post for St. Augustine. The fort was destroyed during the War of Jenkins&#x27; Ear in 1740, though it was rebuilt in 1752. Because Fort Mose became a haven for escaped slaves from the Southern Colonies to the north, it is considered a precursor site of the Underground Railroad.

Chattel slavery developed in British North America before the full legal apparatus that supported slavery did. During the late 17th century and early 18th century, harsh new slave codes limited the rights of African slaves and cut off their avenues to freedom. The first full-scale slave code in British North America was South Carolina&#x27;s (1696), which was modeled on the colonial Barbados slave code of 1661. It was updated and expanded regularly throughout the 18th century.

A 1691 Virginia law prohibited slaveholders from emancipating slaves unless they paid for the freedmen&#x27;s transportation out of Virginia. Virginia criminalized interracial marriage in 1691, and subsequent laws abolished free blacks&#x27; rights to vote, hold office, and bear arms. Virginia&#x27;s House of Burgesses established the basic legal framework for slavery in 1705.

===The Atlantic slave trade to North America===
Of the enslaved Africans brought to the New World an estimated 5–7% ended up in British North America. The vast majority of slaves transported across the Atlantic Ocean were sent to the Caribbean sugar colonies, Brazil, or Spanish America. Throughout the Americas, but especially in the Caribbean, tropical disease took a large toll on their population and required large numbers of replacements. Many Africans had limited natural immunity to yellow fever and malaria; but malnutrition, poor housing, inadequate clothing allowances, and overwork contributed to a high mortality rate.

In British North America, the enslaved population rapidly increased via the birth rate, whereas in the Caribbean colonies they did not. The lack of proper nourishment, being suppressed sexually, and poor health are possible reasons. Of the small numbers of babies born to slaves in the Caribbean, only about 1 in 4 survived the miserable conditions on sugar plantations. It was not only the major colonial powers of Western Europe such as France, Great Britain, Spain, Portugal, and the Dutch Republic that were involved. Other countries, including Sweden and Denmark–Norway, also participated in the Atlantic slave trade, though on a much more limited scale.

===Sexual role differentiation and slavery===
&quot;Depending upon their age and gender, slaves were assigned a particular task, or tasks, that had to be completed during the course of the day.&quot; In certain settings, men would participate in the hard labor, such as working on the farm, while women would generally work in the household. They would &quot;be sent out on errands but in most cases their jobs required that they spend much of their time within their owner&#x27;s household.&quot; These gender distinctions were mainly applied in the Northern colonies and on larger plantations. In Southern colonies and smaller farms, however, women and men typically engaged in the same roles, both working in the tobacco crop fields for example.

Although slave women and men in some areas performed the same type of day-to-day work, &quot;[t]he female slave ... was faced with the prospect of being forced into sexual relationships for the purpose of reproduction.&quot; This reproduction would either be forced between one African slave and another, or between the slave woman and the owner. Slave owners saw slave women in terms of prospective fertility. That way, the number of slaves on a plantation could multiply without having to purchase another African. Unlike the patriarchal society of white Anglo-American colonists, &quot;slave families&quot; were more matriarchal in practice. &quot;Masters believed that slave mothers, like white women, had a natural bond with their children that therefore it was their responsibility—more so than that of slave fathers—to care for their offspring.&quot; Therefore, women had the extra responsibility, on top of their other day-to-day work, to take care of children. Men, in turn, were often separated from their families. &quot;At the same time that slaveholders promoted a strong bond between slave mothers and their children, they denied to slave fathers their paternal rights of ownership and authority...&quot; Biological families were often separated by sale.

===Indentured servitude===

Some historians such as Edmund Morgan and Lerone Bennett have suggested that indentured servitude provided a model for slavery in the 17th-century Crown colonies. In practice, indentured servants were teenagers in England whose fathers sold their labor voluntarily for a period of time (typically four to seven years), in return for free passage to the colonies, room and board and clothes, and training in an occupation. After that, they received cash, clothing, tools, and/or land, and became ordinary settlers.

===The Quaker petition against slavery===
In 1688, four German Quakers in Germantown, a town outside Philadelphia, wrote a petition against the existence of slavery in the Province of Pennsylvania. They presented the petition to their local Quaker Meeting, and the Meeting was sympathetic, but could not decide what the appropriate response should be. The Meeting passed the petition up the chain of authority to the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting, where it continued to be ignored. It was archived and forgotten for 150 years.

The Quaker petition was the first public American document of its kind to protest slavery. It was also one of the first public declarations of universal human rights.

==18th century==
During the Great Awakening of the late eighteenth century, Methodist and Baptist preachers toured in the South, trying to persuade planters to manumit their slaves on the basis of equality in God&#x27;s eyes. They also accepted slaves as members and preachers of new chapels and churches. The first black churches (all Baptist) in what became the United States were founded by slaves and free blacks in Aiken County, South Carolina, in 1773; Petersburg, Virginia, in 1774; and Savannah, Georgia, in 1778, before the end of the Revolutionary War.

Slavery was officially recognized as a serious offense in 1776 by the Philadelphia Yearly Meeting. The &quot;Yearly Meeting&quot; had been against slavery since the 1750s.

===East Indian slaves===
In the early 21st century, new research has revealed that small numbers of East Indians were brought to the Thirteen Colonies as slaves, during the period when both India and the colonies were under British control. As an example, an ad in the &quot;Virginia Gazette&quot; of August 4, 1768, describes one young &quot;East Indian&quot; as &quot;a well made fellow, about 5 feet 4 inches high&quot; who had &quot;a thin visage, a very sly look, and a remarkable set of fine white teeth.&quot; Another slave is identified as &quot;an East India negro man&quot; who speaks French and English. Most of the Indian slaves were already converted to Christianity, were fluent in English, and took western names. Their original names and homes are not known, though some of them reportedly came from Bombay and Bengal. Their descendants have mostly merged with the African-American community, which also incorporated European ancestors. Today, descendants of such East Indian slaves may have a small percent of DNA from Asian ancestors but it likely falls below the detectable levels for today&#x27;s DNA tests, as most of the generations since would have been primarily of ethnic African and European ancestry.

===Beginning of the anti-slavery movement===
African and African-American slaves expressed their opposition to slavery through armed uprisings such as the Stono Rebellion (1739) in South Carolina. More typically, they resisted through work slowdowns, tool-breaking, and running away, either for short periods or permanently. Until the Revolutionary era, almost no white American colonists spoke out against slavery. Even the Quakers generally tolerated slaveholding (and slave-trading) until the mid-18th century, although they emerged as vocal opponents of slavery in the Revolutionary era. During the Great Awakening, Baptist and Methodist preachers in the South originally urged planters to free their slaves. In the nineteenth century, they more often urged better treatment of slaves.

==Further events==
===Late 18th and 19th centuries===
During and following the Revolution, the northern states all abolished slavery, with New Jersey acting last in 1804. Some of these state jurisdictions enacted the first abolition laws in the entire New World. In states that passed gradual abolition laws, such as New York and New Jersey, children born to slave mothers had to serve an extended period of indenture into young adulthood. In other cases, some slaves were reclassified as indentured servants, effectively preserving the institution of slavery through another name.

Often citing Revolutionary ideals, some slaveholders freed their slaves in the first two decades after independence, either outright or through their wills. The proportion of free blacks rose markedly in the Upper South in this period, before the invention of the cotton gin created a new demand for slaves in the developing &quot;Cotton Kingdom&quot; of the Deep South.

By 1808 (the first year allowed by the Constitution to federally ban the import slave trade), all states (except South Carolina) had banned the international buying or selling of slaves. Acting on the advice of President Thomas Jefferson, who denounced the international trade as &quot;violations of human rights which have been so long continued on the unoffending inhabitants of Africa, in which the morality, the reputation, and the best interests of our country have long been eager to proscribe&quot;, in 1807 Congress also banned the international slave trade. However, the domestic slave trade continued in the South. It brought great wealth to the South, especially to New Orleans, which became the fourth largest city in the country, also based on the growth of its port. In the antebellum years, more than one million enslaved African Americans were transported from the Upper South to the developing Deep South, mostly in the slave trade. Cotton culture, dependent on slavery, formed the basis of new wealth in the Deep South.

In 1844 the Quaker petition was rediscovered and became a focus of the burgeoning abolitionist movement.

===Emancipation Proclamation and end of slavery in the US===
On 1 January 1863, Abraham Lincoln signed Emancipation Proclamation freeing slaves in areas in rebellion during the American Civil War when Union troops advanced south. The Thirteenth Amendment (abolition of slavery and involuntary servitude) was ratified in December 1865.

==Social and cultural developments during the colonial period==

===First slave laws===
There were no laws regarding slavery early in Virginia&#x27;s history, but, in 1640, a Virginia court sentenced John Punch, an African, to life in servitude after he attempted to flee his service. The two whites with whom he fled were sentenced only to an additional year of their indenture, and three years&#x27; service to the colony. This marked the first &quot;de facto&quot; legal sanctioning of slavery in the English colonies and was one of the first legal distinctions made between Europeans and Africans.

In 1641, the Massachusetts Bay Colony became the first colony to authorize slavery through enacted law. Massachusetts passed the Body of Liberties, which prohibited slavery in many instances but allowed people to be enslaved if they were captives of war, if they sold themselves into slavery or were purchased elsewhere, or if they were sentenced to slavery as punishment by the governing authority. The Body of Liberties used the word &quot;strangers&quot; to refer to people bought and sold as slaves; they were generally not English subjects. Colonists came to equate this term with Native Americans and Africans.

In 1654, John Casor, a black indentured servant in colonial Virginia, was the first man to be declared a slave in a civil case. He had claimed to an officer that his master, Anthony Johnson, had held him past his indenture term. Johnson himself was a free black, who had arrived in Virginia in 1621 from Portuguese Angola. A neighbor, Robert Parker, told Johnson that if he did not release Casor, he would testify in court to this fact. Under local laws, Johnson was at risk for losing some of his headright lands for violating the terms of indenture. Under duress, Johnson freed Casor. Casor entered into a seven years&#x27; indenture with Parker. Feeling cheated, Johnson sued Parker to repossess Casor. A Northampton County, Virginia court ruled for Johnson, declaring that Parker illegally was detaining Casor from his rightful master who legally held him &quot;for the duration of his life&quot;.

===First inherited status laws===
During the colonial period, the status of enslaved people was affected by interpretations related to the status of foreigners in England. England had no system of naturalizing immigrants to its island or its colonies. Since persons of African origins were not English subjects by birth, they were among those peoples considered foreigners and generally outside English common law. The colonies struggled with how to classify people born to foreigners and subjects. In 1656 Virginia, Elizabeth Key Grinstead, a mixed-race woman, successfully gained her freedom and that of her son in a challenge to her status by making her case as the baptized Christian daughter of the free Englishman Thomas Key. Her attorney was an English subject, which may have helped her case (he was also the father of her mixed-race son, and the couple married after Key was freed).

In 1662, shortly after the Elizabeth Key trial and similar challenges, the Virginia royal colony approved a law adopting the principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot; (called &quot;partus&quot;, for short), stating that any children born in the colony would take the status of the mother. A child of an enslaved mother would be born into slavery, regardless if the father were a freeborn Englishman or Christian. This was a reversal of common law practice in England, which ruled that children of English subjects took the status of the father. The change institutionalized the skewed power relationships between those who enslaved people and enslaved women, freed white men from the legal responsibility to acknowledge or financially support their mixed-race children, and somewhat confined the open scandal of mixed-race children and miscegenation to within the slave quarters.

===First religious status laws===
The Virginia slave codes of 1705 further defined as slaves those people imported from nations that were not Christian. Native Americans who were sold to colonists by other Native Americans (from rival tribes), or captured by Europeans during village raids, were also defined as slaves. This codified the earlier principle of non-Christian foreigner enslavement.

===First anti-slavery causes===
In 1735, the Georgia Trustees enacted a law prohibiting slavery in the new colony, which had been established in 1733 to enable the &quot;worthy poor&quot;, as well as persecuted European Protestants, to have a new start. Slavery was then legal in the other 12 English colonies. Neighboring South Carolina had an economy based on the use of enslaved labor. The Georgia Trustees wanted to eliminate the risk of slave rebellions and make Georgia better able to defend against attacks from the Spanish to the south, who offered freedom to escaped enslaved people. James Edward Oglethorpe was the driving force behind the colony, and the only trustee to reside in Georgia. He opposed slavery on moral grounds as well as for pragmatic reasons, and vigorously defended the ban on slavery against fierce opposition from Carolina merchants of enslaved people and land speculators.

The Protestant Scottish highlanders who settled what is now Darien, Georgia, added a moral anti-slavery argument, which became increasingly rare in the South, in their 1739 &quot;Petition of the Inhabitants of New Inverness&quot;. By 1750 Georgia authorized slavery in the colony because it had been unable to secure enough indentured servants as laborers. As economic conditions in England began to improve in the first half of the 18th century, workers had no reason to leave, especially to face the risks in the colonies.

===Slavery in French Louisiana===

Louisiana was founded as a French colony. Colonial officials in 1724 implemented Louis XIV of France&#x27;s &quot;Code Noir&quot;, which regulated the slave trade and the institution of slavery in New France and the French West Indies. This resulted in Louisiana, which was purchased by the United States in 1803, having a different pattern of slavery than the rest of the United States. As written, the &quot;Code Noir&quot; gave some rights to slaves, including the right to marry. Although it authorized and codified cruel corporal punishment against slaves under certain conditions, it forbade slave owners from torturing them, separating married couples, or separating young children from their mothers. It also required owners to instruct slaves in the Catholic faith.

Together with a more permeable historic French system that allowed certain rights to &quot;gens de couleur libres&quot; (free people of color), who were often born to white fathers and their mixed-race concubines, a far higher percentage of African Americans in Louisiana were free as of the 1830 census (13.2% in Louisiana compared to 0.8% in Mississippi, whose population was dominated by white Anglo-Americans). Most of Louisiana&#x27;s &quot;third class&quot; of free people of color, situated between the native-born French and mass of African slaves, lived in New Orleans. The Louisiana free people of color were often literate and educated, with a significant number owning businesses, properties, and even slaves. Although &quot;Code Noir&quot; forbade interracial marriages, interracial unions were widespread. Whether there was a formalized system of concubinage, known as plaçage, is subject to debate. The mixed-race offspring (Creoles of color) from these unions were among those in the intermediate social caste of free people of color. The English colonies, in contrast, operated within a binary system that treated mulatto and black slaves equally under the law and discriminated against free black people equally, without regard to their skin tone.

When the U.S. took over Louisiana, Americans from the Protestant South entered the territory and began to impose their norms. They officially discouraged interracial relationships (although white men continued to have unions with black women, both enslaved and free.) The &quot;Americanization&quot; of Louisiana gradually resulted in a binary system of race, causing free people of color to lose status as they were grouped with the slaves. They lost certain rights as they became classified by American whites as officially &quot;black&quot;.

===Early abolitionism===
The first voices to advocate the abolition of slavery were Puritans. For example, in 1700, Massachusetts judge and Puritan Samuel Sewall published &quot;The Selling of Joseph,&quot; the first antislavery tract written in America. In it, Sewall condemns slavery and the slave trade and refutes many of the era&#x27;s typical justifications for slavery.
The Puritan influence on slavery was still strong at the time of the American Revolution and beyond. In the decades leading up to the American Civil War, abolitionists such as Theodore Parker, Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau and Frederick Douglass repeatedly used the Puritan heritage of the country to bolster their cause. The most radical anti-slavery newspaper, &quot;The Liberator&quot;, invoked the Puritans and Puritan values over a thousand times. Parker, in urging New England Congressmen to support the abolition of slavery, writes &quot;The son of the Puritan ... is sent to Congress to stand up for Truth and Right ...&quot;

There was legal agitation against slavery in the Thirteen Colonies starting in 1752 by lawyer Benjamin Kent, whose cases were recorded by one of his understudies, the future president John Adams. Kent represented numerous slaves in their attempts to gain their freedom. He handled the case of a slave, Pompey, suing his master. In 1766, Kent was the first lawyer in the United States to win a case to free a slave, Jenny Slew. He also won a trial in the Old County Courthouse for a slave named (1771). Kent also handled Lucy Pernam&#x27;s divorce and the freedom suits of Rose and Salem Orne.

In Massachusetts, slavery was successfully challenged in court in 1783 in a freedom suit by Quock Walker; he said that slavery was in contradiction to the state&#x27;s new constitution of 1780 providing for equality of men. Freed slaves were subject to racial segregation and discrimination in the North, and in many cases they did not have the right to vote until ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870.

<text>Open Source Development Labs (OSDL) was a non-profit organization supported by a consortium to promote Linux for enterprise computing. Founded in 2000, OSDL positioned itself as an independent, non-profit lab for developers who are adding enterprise capabilities to Linux. The headquarters was first incorporated in San Francisco but later relocated to Beaverton in Oregon with second facility in Yokohama, Japan.

On January 22, 2007, OSDL and the Free Standards Group merged to form the Linux Foundation, narrowing their respective focuses to that of promoting Linux.

==Activities==
OSDL sponsored projects, including industry initiatives to enhance Linux for use in corporate data centres, in telecommunications networks, and on desktop computers. It also:
* provided hardware resources to the free software community and the open source community

<doc id="249482" wikidata="Q204284" url="?curid=249482" title="All Nippon Airways">
<text>is a Japanese airline headquartered in Minato, Tokyo. ANA operates services to both domestic and international destinations and is Japan&#x27;s largest airline, ahead of its main rival flag carrier Japan Airlines. As of March 2024, the airline has approximately 12,800 employees. The airline joined as a Star Alliance member in October 1999.

In addition to its mainline operations, ANA controls several subsidiary passenger carriers, such as its regional airline ANA Wings, Air Nippon, Air Do (a low-cost carrier operating scheduled service between Tokyo and cities in Hokkaido), Air Japan and Allex Cargo (ANA Cargo – the freighter division operated by Air Japan). ANA is also the wholly-owned shareholder in Peach, a low-cost carrier joint venture with Hong Kong company First Eastern Investment Group. On 29 March 2013, ANA was named a 5-Star Airline by Skytrax.

== History ==

=== Formation ===
ANA&#x27;s earliest ancestor was (also known as Nippon Helicopter and Aeroplane), an airline company founded on 27 December 1952. Nippon Helicopter was the source of what would later be ANA&#x27;s International Air Transport Association (IATA) airline code, NH.


NH began helicopter services in February 1953. On 15 December 1953, it operated its first cargo flight between Osaka and Tokyo using a de Havilland Dove, JA5008. This was the first scheduled flight flown by a Japanese pilot in postwar Japan. Passenger service on the same route began on 1 February 1954, and was upgraded to a de Havilland Heron in March. In 1955, Douglas DC-3s began flying for NH as well, by which time the airline&#x27;s route network extended from northern Kyūshū to Sapporo. In December 1957 Nippon Helicopter changed its name to All Nippon Airways Company.

ANA&#x27;s other ancestor was . Although it was founded on 26 December 1952, one day before Nippon Helicopter, it did not begin operations until 20 January 1954, when it began night cargo runs between Osaka and Tokyo, also using a de Havilland Dove. It adopted the DC-3 in early 1957, by which point its route network extended through southern Japan from Tokyo to Kagoshima.

Far East Airlines merged with the newly named All Nippon Airways in March 1958. The combined companies had a total market capitalization of 600 million yen, and the result of the merger was Japan&#x27;s largest private airline. The merged airline received a new Japanese name (; ; All Japan Air Transport). The new united airline ran a route network that was amalgamated from its two predecessors, and the company logo of the larger NH was chosen to serve as its logo.

=== Domestic era ===

ANA grew through the 1960s, adding the Vickers Viscount to the fleet in 1960 and the Fokker F27 in 1961. October 1961 marked ANA&#x27;s debut on the Tokyo Stock Exchange as well as the Osaka Securities Exchange. 1963 saw another merger, with Fujita Airlines, raising the company&#x27;s capital to 4.65 billion yen. In 1965 ANA introduced its first jet, the Boeing 727 trijet, on the Tokyo-Sapporo route. Prior to this, the Japan Civil Aviation Bureau denied an import license for ANA&#x27;s 727s unless Japan Airlines (JAL) acquired their own fleet of 727s. ANA also introduced Japan&#x27;s first homegrown turboprop airliner, the NAMC YS-11 in 1965, replacing Convair 440s on local routes. In 1969, ANA introduced Boeing 737 services.

As ANA grew, it started to contract travel companies across Japan to handle ground services in each region. Many of these companies received shares in ANA as part of their deals. Some of these relationships continue today in different forms: for instance, Nagoya Railroad, which handled ANA&#x27;s operations in the Chūbu region along with other partnerships, maintains a permanent seat on ANA&#x27;s board of directors. By 1974, ANA had Japan&#x27;s largest domestic airline network.

While ANA&#x27;s domestic operations grew, the Ministry of Transport had granted government-owned JAL a monopoly on international scheduled flights that lasted until 1986. ANA was allowed to operate international charter flights: its first was a Boeing 727 charter from Tokyo to Hong Kong on 21 February 1971.

ANA bought its first widebody aircraft, six Lockheed L-1011s, in November 1971, following a lengthy sales effort by Lockheed which had involved negotiations between US president Richard Nixon, Japanese prime minister Kakuei Tanaka and UK prime minister Edward Heath (lobbying in favor of engine maker Rolls-Royce). Tanaka also pressed Japanese regulators to permit ANA to operate on Asia routes as part of the package. The aircraft entered service on the Tokyo-Okinawa route in 1974. The carrier had ordered McDonnell Douglas DC-10s but cancelled the order at the last minute and switched to Lockheed. It was later revealed that Lockheed had indirectly bribed Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka to force this switch: the scandal led to the arrest of Tanaka and several managers from ANA and Lockheed sales agent Marubeni for corruption.

Boeing 747-200s were introduced on the Tokyo-Sapporo and Tokyo-Fukuoka routes in 1976 and Boeing 767s in 1983 on Shikoku routes. The carrier&#x27;s first B747s were the short-range SR variant, designed for Japanese domestic routes.

=== International era ===
In 1986, ANA began to expand beyond Japan&#x27;s key domestic carrier to become a competitive international carrier as well, breaking Japan Airlines&#x27; monopoly as the sole Japanese flag carrier like many other countries in Asia. On 3 March 1986, ANA started scheduled international flights with a passenger service from Tokyo to Guam. Flights to Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., followed by year&#x27;s end, and ANA also entered a service agreement with American Airlines to feed the US carrier&#x27;s new flights to Narita.

ANA expanded its international services gradually: to Beijing, Dalian, Hong Kong and Sydney in 1987; to Seoul in 1988; to London and Saipan in 1989; to Paris in 1990 and to New York and Singapore in 1991. Airbus equipment such as the A320 and A321 was added to the fleet in the early 1990s, as was the Boeing 747-400 jet. ANA joined the Star Alliance in October 1999.

In February 2001, to promote the opening of Universal Studios Japan, ANA unveiled the Woody Woodpecker-themed Woody Jet, using the Boeing 767-300, for its domestic flights.

2004 saw ANA&#x27;s profits exceed JAL&#x27;s for the first time. That year, facing a surplus of slots due to the construction of new airports and the ongoing expansion of Tokyo International Airport, ANA announced a fleet renewal plan that would replace some of its large aircraft with a greater number of smaller aircraft.

Also in 2004, ANA set up low-cost subsidiary Air Next to operate flights from Fukuoka Airport starting in 2005, and became the majority shareholder in Nakanihon Airline Service (NAL) headquartered in Nagoya Airport. In 2005, ANA renamed NAL to Air Central, and relocated its headquarters to Chūbu Centrair International Airport. On 12 July 2005, ANA reached a deal with NYK to sell its 27.6% share in Nippon Cargo Airlines, a joint venture formed between the two companies in 1987. The sale allowed ANA to focus on developing its own cargo division. In 2006, ANA, Japan Post, Nippon Express, and Mitsui O.S.K. Lines founded ANA &amp; JP Express (AJV), which would operate freighters. ANA is the top shareholder of AJV. It absorbed Air Japan&#x27;s freighter operations.

&quot;Air Transport World&quot; named ANA its 2007 &quot;Airline of the Year&quot;. In 2006, the airline was recognized by FlightOnTime.info as the most punctual scheduled airline between London and Tokyo for the last four consecutive years, based on official British statistics. Japan Airlines took over the title in 2007. In 2009, ANA announced plans to test an idea as part of the airline&#x27;s &quot;e-flight&quot; campaign, encouraging passengers on select flights to visit the airport restroom before they board. On 10 November of the same year, ANA also announced &quot;Inspiration of JAPAN&quot;, ANA&#x27;s newest international flight concept, with redesigned cabins initially launched on its 777-300ER aircraft.

In July 2011, All Nippon Airways and AirAsia agreed to form a low-cost carrier, called AirAsia Japan, based at Tokyo&#x27;s Narita International Airport. ANA held 51 percent shares and AirAsia held 33 percent voting shares and 16 percent non-voting shares through its wholly owned subsidiary, AA International. The carrier lasted until October 2013, when AirAsia withdrew from the joint venture; the carrier was subsequently rebranded as Vanilla Air.

In March 2018, All Nippon Airways announced the integration of its two low cost carrier subsidiaries Peach Aviation and Vanilla Air into one entity retaining the Peach name; starting in the second half of FY2018 and to be completed by the end of FY2019.

On 29 January 2019, ANA Holdings purchased a 9.5% stake in PAL Holdings, Philippine Airlines&#x27; parent company, for US$95 million.

== Parent company ==
ANA Holdings Inc. was created in April 2013 due to the &quot;changing landscape of the airline industry&quot;, with competition against low cost carriers cited as one of the reasons. The new holding company would have over 70 companies under it, most notably All Nippon Airways, but also low cost subsidiaries such as Peach Aviation, and other catering and ground operations companies. The holding company is led by a separate chairman and CEO.

From the 1970s through the late 1990s, All Nippon Airways was headquartered in the Kasumigaseki Building in Chiyoda, Tokyo. Before moving into its current headquarters, ANA had its headquarters on the grounds of Tokyo International Airport in Ōta, Tokyo. In 2002, ANA announced that it was taking up to 10 floors in the then under-construction Shiodome City Center. ANA announced that it was also moving some subsidiaries to the Shiodome City Center. Shiodome City Center, which became ANA&#x27;s headquarters, opened in 2003.

===Cargo services===
As of May 2021, ANA operated a fleet of six freighter aircraft, Including four Boeing 767-300ER(BCF) and two Boeing 777F aircraft. ANA&#x27;s freighters operate on 18 international routes and 6 domestic routes. ANA operates an overnight cargo hub at Naha Airport in Okinawa, which receives inbound freighter flights from key destinations in Japan, China and Southeast Asia between 1 and 4 a.m., followed by return flights between 4 and 6 a.m., allowing overnight service between these regional hubs as well as onward connections to other ANA and partner carrier flights. The 767 freighters also operate daytime flights from Narita and Kansai to various destinations in East and Southeast Asia. ANA also operates a 767 freighter on an overnight Kansai-Haneda-Saga-Kansai route on weeknights, which is used by overnight delivery services to send parcels to and from destinations in Kyushu.

ANA established a 767 freighter operation in 2006 through a JV with Japan Post, Nippon Express and Mitsui, called ANA &amp; JP Express. ANA announced a second freighter joint venture called Allex in 2008, with Kintetsu World Express, Nippon Express, MOL Logistics and Yusen Air &amp; Sea as JV partners. Allex merged with ANA subsidiary Overseas Courier Services (OCS), an overseas periodical distribution company, in 2009, and ANA &amp; JP Express was folded into ANA in 2010.

ANA Cargo and the United States–based United Parcel Service have a cargo alliance and a code-share agreement, similar to an airline alliance, to transport member cargo on UPS Airlines aircraft.

ANA also has a long historical relationship with Nippon Cargo Airlines, a Narita-based operator of Boeing 747 freighters. ANA co-founded NCA with shipping company Nippon Yusen in 1978, and at one time held 27.5% of NCA&#x27;s stock. ANA sold its stake to NYK in 2005, but retained a technical partnership with NCA. ANA announced in July 2013 that it would charter NCA&#x27;s 747 freighter aircraft for an overnight cargo run between Narita and Okinawa, doubling capacity between ANA&#x27;s key cargo hubs and freeing up 767 aircraft to operate new routes from Okinawa to Nagoya and Qingdao.

On 7 March 2023, Nippon Yusen and ANA Holdings announced that ANA would acquire all shares of NCA from Nippon Yusen by 1 October 2023, or a date to be agreed by the two companies. ANA is also considering a future merger of ANA Cargo and NCA.

==Destinations==
ANA has an extensive domestic route network that covers the entirety of Japan, from Hokkaido in the north to Okinawa in the south. ANA&#x27;s international route network extends through China, Korea, India, Southeast Asia, Canada, United States, Mexico, Australia, and Western Europe. Its key international hub is Narita International Airport, where it shares the South Wing of Terminal 1 with its Star Alliance partners, though Haneda Airport is becoming a major international hub due to its close proximity with downtown Tokyo and the mass expansions occurring there.

ANA&#x27;s international network currently focuses on business destinations; its only remaining &quot;resort&quot; routes are its routes from Haneda and Narita to Honolulu; past resort routes such as Narita-Guam, Kansai-Honolulu and Nagoya-Honolulu have been cancelled, although ANA plans to expand resort service in the future through its low-cost subsidiary Peach Aviation.

=== Fleet development ===
On 31 July 2014, ANA firmed up orders for 7 Airbus A320neos, 23 Airbus A321neos, 20 Boeing 777-9s, 14 Boeing 787-9s and 6 Boeing 777-300ERs, to be used for its short and long-haul fleet renewal. Boeing valued ANA&#x27;s order at approximately $13 billion at list prices.

On 2 February 2015, ANA placed orders with Airbus and Boeing worth $2.2bn for three Boeing 787-10s, five Boeing 737-800s and seven Airbus A321s. In late July 2015, ANA entered into a secret agreement with Airbus to make additional orders in the future (number and model(s) of aircraft unidentified) in exchange for Airbus support of ANA plans to invest in bankrupt Skymark Airlines.

Also in 2015, ANA placed orders for the since cancelled 15 Mitsubishi Regional Jets for regional flights, which were to be operated by ANA Wings.

On 29 January 2016, ANA signed a purchase agreement with Airbus, covering firm orders for three Airbus A380s, for delivery from fiscal 2018 to operate on the Tokyo (Narita) to Honolulu route.

On 11 July 2022, ANA converted two of its 777-9 orders into the freighter variant 777-8F.

===Boeing 787===
ANA was the launch customer for the new Boeing widebody, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, ordering 50 examples with an option for 50 more in April 2004. ANA split the order between 30 of the short-range 787-3 and 20 of the long-haul 787-8. However, ANA later converted its −3 orders to the −8 variant.

Deliveries finally began in late 2011 when ANA received its first Boeing 787 on 21 September, the first-ever Dreamliner to be delivered in the world. ANA flew its first Boeing 787 passenger flight on 26 October 2011, which operated as a charter flight from Tokyo Narita to Hong Kong. ANA also became the second airline to receive the Boeing 787-9 on 28 July 2014. Despite being second, the airline preceded launch customer Air New Zealand for the first commercial flight on the 787-9, a special sightseeing charter for Japanese and American school children on 4 August.

===Historic fleet===
The NAMC YS-11 was an important aircraft for All Nippon Airways, although most of them were used under the name of ANK, or Air Nippon, a subsidiary of All Nippon Airways. The final YS-11 in operation was retired in 2006. Some YS-11s are in museums, or otherwise scrapped or taken apart. After a final retirement process through September 2006, all YS-11s were grounded, and obligated to retire, unless privately owned and were privately restored. The YS-11 was a big part of All Nippon Airways from the 1970s to the early 1990s when it was used on domestic operations.

ANA flew its last flight of an Airbus A321-100 on 29 February 2008. This marked the end of almost ten years of operation of the Airbus A321-100, of which ANA was the only Japanese operator.

All Nippon Airways had historically operated the following aircraft:

== Liveries ==

=== Former livery ===
The ANA former &quot;Mohican&quot; livery consists of a blue and white colour scheme painted as strip sections on the fuselage, with a blue vertical stabilizer with the former ANA logo. All aircraft wearing this livery are either retired or repainted. In 2010, one Boeing 767-300 was repainted in this livery.

In 1982, ANA officially introduced the &quot;Triton blue&quot; livery, which has a white and grey fuselage, with a blue strip painted under the windows, and the vertical stabilizer is painted blue with the word ANA painted sideways. In the first version, the Japanese name and full English name of ANA were painted black on top of windows. After joining Star Alliance, ANA gave the livery its first update, in which the airline&#x27;s Japanese and English name was replaced with the ANA logo.

=== Current livery ===
Currently, ANA still uses the &quot;Triton blue&quot; livery, but it gives another minor update since 2010: the Japanese flag is moved near the ANA logo above the windows, and the slogan &quot;Inspiration of Japan&quot; is added.

===Special liveries===
Many ANA aircraft have operated in special liveries through the years:
* Seven jets in Star Alliance livery: two Boeing 777-200s, one Boeing 777-300ER, one Boeing 767-300ER, one Boeing 767-300, one Boeing 737-800 and one Boeing 787-9
* Twelve Pokémon-themed jets: five Boeing 747-400s, four Boeing 767-300, one Boeing 777-300, one Boeing 777-300ER and one Boeing 787-9
* Four Star Wars-themed jets: one Boeing 787-9 in an R2-D2 livery; one Boeing 777-300ER in a BB-8 livery; one Boeing 767-300ER in a mixed R2-D2 and BB-8 livery; and one Boeing 777-200ER in a C-3PO livery.
* All three Airbus A380-800s in ANA Flying Honu liveries ( meaning &#x27;sea turtle&#x27; in Hawaiian)
* Six Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba-themed jets: two Boeing 767-300ERs, one Boeing 777-200ER from the main airline, and three De Havilland Canada DHC-8 400s from the regional subsidiary ANA Wings.
* Two Boeing 787s and one De Havilland Canada DHC-8 400 painted in ANA Future Promise livery to promote sustainable flying.

===New cabin===



This &quot;Inspiration of Japan&quot; concept was originally set to debut on 20 February 2010 with the delivery of its new Boeing 777-300ER prior to that date, followed by the introduction of the concept on that date on the Narita-New York route. However, due to delays to the new premium economy seats, the debut was pushed back to 19 April. (The delay was due to the failure of a safety test in Japan of a new seat design axle, made by seat manufacturer Koito Industries Ltd. This safety test failure also affected deliveries of aircraft to be operated by three other fellow Star Alliance members – Singapore Airlines for its A380s, Thai Airways&#x27; A330s, and Continental Airlines for new 737-800 deliveries.)

The &quot;Inspiration of Japan&quot; concept has been refitted on its existing 777-300ERs for service on all the airline&#x27;s North American routes, and may be refitted on its European routes. Parts of it may eventually be phased into its existing Boeing 767-300ERs in service as well as the upcoming Boeing 787s in order.

Since February 2010, ANA offers women&#x27;s-only lavatories on international flights. The first Boeing 787 the airline received have the bidets in both economy and business class lavatory.

===Inflight magazine===
ANA&#x27;s inflight magazine is named &quot;Wingspan&quot; and is available both on board and as a freely downloadable application for Apple&#x27;s iPad. The iPad version is named &quot;Virtual Airport&quot; and includes content from &quot;Wingspan&quot; as well as links to airline booking and online check-in pages.

===Bus shuttle services===
Previously, ANA had a dedicated shuttle bus from Düsseldorf to Frankfurt Airport so passengers may board ANA flights at that airport, but the bus service was discontinued after ANA began its dedicated Düsseldorf flights in 2014.

==In popular culture==
*ANA sponsored the film &quot;Happy Flight&quot;, which is about a co-pilot and flight attendant on an ANA flight to Hawaii.
*ANA was featured in &quot;Miss Pilot&quot;, a Japanese television drama about a female pilot.
*ANA sponsored the Japanese television drama &quot;Good Luck!!&quot;, which is about a group of airline crew members. The series starred Takuya Kimura, Shinichi Tsutsumi and Kou Shibasaki.
*The title for &quot;All Nippon Air Line&quot;, a Josei manga by Kei Azumaya that was inspired by All Nippon Airways.
*Some of ANA&#x27;s aircraft were Pokémon themed. Special exclusive promotional cards were also given out to passengers during certain Pokémon marketing campaigns. As of 2016, most of ANA&#x27;s Pokémon themed jets have been either retired or repainted.

<text>Benelli Q.J. is an Italian company, based in the city of Pesaro in the Marche region, that produces motorcycles and scooters.

Since 2005 Benelli is owned by the Qianjiang Motorcycle, a Chinese company owned by the Geely Holding Group. Originally founded in 1911 in Pesaro, Benelli is the second oldest Italian motorcycle company still in business.

Design, development and marketing activities are carried out at the Benelli QJ headquarters in Pesaro, Italy, in synergy with the parent company of Wenling China where motorcycles are produced.

==History==
=== From founding to World War II ===


Benelli was established in Pesaro, Italy in 1911, which possibly makes it the oldest of Italian motorcycle factories in operation. (Moto Guzzi—the oldest motorcycle factory in non-stop operation—was established in 1921, and Peugeot is the world&#x27;s oldest and still producing motorcycle factory due to establishing in 1898.)
After losing her husband, the widow Teresa Boni Benelli invested all of the family capital into the business in the hope that it would offer stable work for her six sons: Giuseppe, Giovanni, Francesco, Filippo, Domenico and Antonio (&quot;Tonino&quot;). She also sent Giuseppe and Giovanni to study Engineering in Switzerland. Initially the business had 6 employees in addition to the 5 brothers working (Tonino didn&#x27;t work because he was too young.)

In the beginning, it was just the Benelli Garage, which repaired bicycles and motorcycles, but was already able to produce all of the spare parts needed for repairs. During World War I, Benelli worked hard fixing parts for the Italian machines in war and in 1919 the first motorcycle was presented to the public. In 1920 the company built its first complete engine in-house, a single-cylinder two-stroke 75 cc model, immediately adapted to a bicycle frame. A year later in 1921, Benelli built its first motorcycle, using their own engine which had by then become a 98 cc model.

But the most successful engine, which made Benelli known in the national and international field, was the 175 cm3 4-stroke with &quot;cascade&quot; distribution and overhead camshaft of 1927, a bold and sophisticated solution that soon became the &quot;trademark&quot; of the Pesaro house. Giuseppe Benelli was inspired by a theoretical study of an engine by Edward Turner published in 1925 in the French magazine Moto Revue. Giuseppe, in order to beat the competition, did not waste time and completely reinterpreted that project introducing an ingenious simple solution to eliminate the negative effects of thermal expansion that afflicted these applications.

The five cylindrical gears with straight teeth of the distribution (one of the crankshaft, three idle, one of the camshaft) were inserted (cascade) in a thin aluminum folder placed on the right side of the engine, on the top of which was mounted the &quot;castelletto&quot; of the distribution with the camshaft and barbells annexed. The whole was fixed to the engine head not rigidly, but leaving the coupling with a degree of freedom. The solution consisted in inserting two screws with the stem partially threaded (columns) in two holes in the castle and screwed on the two of the four prisoners of the thermal head. The threaded part joined firmly to the head, while the part of the threaded screw created a free, but very precise coupling with the two holes in the castle. The screws were tightened so as not to &quot;crush&quot; the castle, but so that they could leave a play of a few tenths of a millimeter sufficient to the two &quot;blocks&quot; (folder-castle/ cylinder-head) to flow over each other in the phase of expansion by the effect of heat, without interfering and creating those deformations that would have made the system unreliable. This solution was patented in 1927 and began the commercial and sporting success of Benelli, which lasted until the outbreak of World War II. (Patent No. 255634 of 29 Oct. 1927 &quot;Arrangement for forming and fixing the transmission box for controlling the distribution shaft at the head in combustion engines&quot;)

Two years after that, using a version specially designed for competitions, Tonino &quot;the terrible&quot; took to the track. He displayed an extraordinary natural talent as a rider and embarked on a very successful career which confirmed the company&#x27;s exceptional capacity for development and production. Riding a Benelli 175, Tonino Benelli won four Italian championship titles in five years: in 1927, 1928 and 1930 with engine single overhead camshaft (SOHC) version, and in 1931 with the double overhead camshaft (DOHC) version. Unfortunately, a bad crash in the GP of the Tigullio in 1932 put an end to his short and brilliant career; on 27 September 1937 Tonino died following a road accident.

As World War II loomed, the Benelli company debuted with a motorcycles with engine four-cylinder in line supercharged 250cc designed for racing with double overhead camshaft, liquid cooled and with a vane compressor, credited with a maximum power of 52 hp at 10,000 rev/min and a maximum speed of 230 km/h. This motorcycle was intended to compete in the 1940 season to try to bissare the Benelli&#x27;s success in the 1939 Isle of Man TT Lightweight 250 cc race, but the outbreak of the Second World War will frustrate all efforts and this solution (banned in the post-war period) will never be used in official competitions.

===After World War II===


At the end of the conflict, much of the factory was destroyed, the equipment dispersed or damaged and it took three or four years to restart the business in a situation of precariousness and misery. To replenish the scarce financial resources, the Benelli acquired a thousand motorcycles abandoned by the belligerent armies on the battlefields to refurbish them for civil use.

Giuseppe Benelli, after irreconcilable disputes with his brothers about productive strategies, split from the company to found first the BBC Automobili in 1946 and after MotoBi in 1952. The management of Benelli factory will pass to the second brother Giovanni who, although not having the design talents of his older brother, had great organizational skills having always managed the productive apparatus of the company. Under his direction Giovanni provides designers with the guidelines of the model of rebirth: the new motorcycle must be light, reliable and cheap. This is how the Letizia model was born, equipped with a two-stroke engine (cheaper than 4-stroke) of 98 cm3 with four bench bearings, mounted on an essential frame, but elastic on both axes. ″Letizia″ will be the motorcycle forerunner of the most famous model of the Benelli postwar: the ″Leoncino″ (little lion). It was produced from 1950 to 1960 in about 45,000 units, the most common motorization was the 125 cm3 2 stroke, but also 150 cm3 for the version &quot;three wheel&quot; and 125 cm3 4 stroke with distribution to &quot;cascade of gears&quot;, immediately abandoned solution for reliability problems.

Since the 1960s, at a time of major market crisis in Italy, Benelli has been saving its balance with exports to the US. In the sixties he chose two different routes to sell overseas: via the importer Cosmopolitan and with the Montgomery Ward and presented the following models:
* Tornado 650: the twin-cylinder maxi was marketed first in the US and then in Europe. The superstructures are completely different, but the peculiarity is the chassis type Metisse, wanted by Steve McQueen. The actor was the image of the importer Cosmopolitan and Montgomery Ward. The ″Tornado″ earned a reputation for reliability and high performance, despite its somewhat hefty weight at . Benelli claimed at the time of launch that the Tornado was capable of 57 hp at 7,400rpm for a top speed of 117 mph. The Tornado (later the Tornado S) was discontinued after 1974, when Benelli introduced a series of &quot;multis&quot; intended to compete with Japanese triples and fours.
* Mojave 260/360: used the chassis and superstructures of the Tornado while the 4-stroke engine was an increase of 175 cc. The motorbike, proposed also in preparation Scrambler, could be bought in store.
* Buzzer/Hurricane/Dynamo/Hornet: small wheeled scooter with 65 cc engine (instead of 50 cc sold in Italy). Compared to the models sold in Italy, the names and some details changed.
* Volcano: low-wheeled &quot;scooter&quot; derived from the Mini Cross but with a displacement of 180 cc.

===The management of Alejandro de Tomaso ===
Towards the end of the 1960s, the arrival of Japanese manufacturers caused a crisis in the European motorcycle industry. The original Benelli company was heavily involved in the American motorcycle market, selling motorcycles under 350cc through Montgomery Ward. The advent of competition from Japan led to Benelli products (still largely of single cylinder pushrod design) losing popularity as they were perceived as old-fashioned in comparison to Hondas of the era which sported overhead cam engines with electric starters, in much the same way as the British motorcycle manufacturers such as Norton, BSA and Triumph were affected in the larger capacity sector.

The Benelli, in obvious economic difficulty, will be purchased by the Italian-Argentine industrialist Alejandro de Tomaso, who was undoubtedly one of the most discussed and powerful figures in Italy in the &#x27;60s, &#x27;70s and &#x27;80s. In 1959 he founded De Tomaso automobili in Modena and made his own series of road and racing cars. He then acquired a number of Italian companies such as Maserati, Innocenti, Ghia and Vignale and then, in 1971, Benelli and the competitor Moto Guzzi in 1973. De Tomaso therefore had many diversified interests, acquired companies in difficulty and then restructured them and tried to sell them back, pocketing the capital gains. His approach evidently had no forward-looking industrial continuity, so that in his acquisitions there were more &quot;shadows&quot; than &quot;lights&quot;. Benelli is no exception, which will live the most troubled period of its centenary history.

The Italian-Argentine manager, in order to challenge the Japanese manufacturers, immediately asks the designers to copy a Honda CB500 Four engine to save time and money. Thus was born the 500 Quattro (1974) which will be the basis of the 750 Sei with its six-cylinder engine in line, first in the world on a road motorcycle. Experts in the field judged the 750 Sei an easy-to-ride motorcycles, with good engine elasticity, exceptional roadholding and excellent brakes. The only downside was the ignition that had to bring the power at the right time to the candles. In 1974 it became &quot;Moto dell&#x27;anno&quot; and in 1975 there were the first deliveries. It had a top speed of 200 km/h, 75 hp at 9500 rpm and was produced in 3200 units until 1977. This industrial policy, combined with little investment in plant and research, with a quality of materials that is not up to the competition, with a lack of distribution and after-sales network, will soon prove to be harmful. Then, the final blow, will be caused by the merger with the acerrima and historical rival (in racing) Moto Guzzi in the Guzzi-Benelli Moto (G.B.M. S.p.a.) that will transform the Benelli in an empty box.

Benelli motorcycles from the 1970s and 1980s, particularly the 750 Sei, often command higher prices than their contemporaries on the secondhand market.

===The management of Andrea Merloni===


After a failed attempt of rebirth in 1989 supported by the Pesaro industrialist Giancarlo Selci, operating in the field of woodworking machinery and ex machine operator in the Benelli factory, in December 1995 there was the decisive turning point: the young Andrea Merloni, at only 28 years old, scion of family of the famous Marche dynasty of household appliances and passionate motorcyclist, has decided to take over the Benelli brand to relaunch it on the world market, first by opening a new factory in Strada della Fornace Vecchia, where Benelli itself is still based today, then entered the most difficult sectors, using young and dynamic designers, launching a series of scooters and maximoto to give immediate oxygen to the crates and organize the sales network and assistance.

So, in just over a year from the acquisition, were placed on the market the first new products such as models Adiva (in the displacement 125 and 150) equipped with rigid canopy foldable in the trunk (first scooter in the world to be equipped with this mechanism, then copied by the competition), the Velvet (in the displacement 125, 150, 250, 400) which remained in the list until 2012, the 491, very popular among fourteen-year-olds of the time, that mounted a rare horizontal Morini engine of 50 cm3 at 2 times with liquid cooling and that made it one of the most performing of the lot, the K2 (50 and 100 cm3) and the Pepe (of 50 cm3 then became the best-selling Benelli scooter in recent years); the latter, powered by a Minarelli engine, had a good commercial success.

In 1999 was hired the technician Riccardo Rosa (ex Cagiva) and was then presented the new Tornado Tre, a sports bike (900 cm3, then brought to 1130 cm3), with interesting technological innovations. It was in fact a pure sports bike, equipped with a 3-cylinder engine in-line that presented a new arrangement of the cooling radiator positioned under the rear tail and equipped with two forced air extraction fans of spectacular effect and a new &quot;mixed&quot; frame consists of a die-cast aluminium and steel tubes joined with a technology of aeronautical origin. 
The Tornado Tre 900 super sport bike was launched in 2002, and the TNT, roadster some years later.

&quot;The races improve the breed&quot; and Merloni, a former driver, knew it well so the next step was to prepare the new Tornado for the races. As per his style, Merloni immediately began to run in 2001 and 2002 in the World Superbike Championship with the Australian rider Peter Goddard, who with his long experience has been able to give directions to improve the bike and consequently also the series. Given that the team was at the start and fierce competition, the results were higher than expected with a 36th place in the final classification in 2001 (with 7 points) and a 22nd place in 2002 (with 23 points). A limited version of the Tornado (named the Tornado LE, where LE stands for Limited Edition) was built.

The results of the new Benelli are encouraging but the strong investments for the Tornado are not compensated by sales and even Andrea Merloni decides to stop.

=== Current Qianjiang ownership ===

In 2005, Benelli was acquired by Qianjiang Motor Group, a Chinese company which has been controlled by the Geely Holding Group since 2015.

The Qianjiang Group is a Chinese manufacturer of small motorcycles and engines, which already owns the Keeway and Generic brands. Qianjiang decided to maintain production and engineering in Pesaro, entrusting the company to sole administrator Yan Haimei. The production of motorcycles started almost immediately with the assembly of 3-cylinder engines (previously performed by Franco Morini Motori) brought back to the marque. The scooter range also restarted with engines of Chinese origin.

For 12 years Benelli QJ carried out the projects and production of the previous management. 2016 was a breakthrough year, with coincided with the acquisition of Qianjiang Group by the Geely Holding Group. The Leoncino 500 and the TRK 500 are still made in Pesaro. Both motorcycles have the same 500 cc twin-cylinder 4 valve, double camshaft engine. The Leoncino is a &quot;naked&quot; bike with historic reference to past models. It comes in two versions, a roadster with 17&quot; cast wheels, and a scrambler with longer suspension and spoked wheels. The TRK 500 is an &quot;Adventure Bike&quot; made for long-distance touring. It also comes in two models, the base model with cast 17&quot; rims is a road touring machine, and the TRK502X is a more dirt-oriented machine. It has more suspension travel, spoked wheels, and a 2&quot; higher seat height. In general, the success of TRK has been overwhelming. In 2020 it was by far the best-selling model in Italy. Benelli currently offers a very wide range of models from 125 single cylinder (135cc in some markets) to 300, 500, 750 twin cylinder and 600 four cylinder models.

The synergy deriving from the know-how of the historic company in Italy and the parent company in China has proved a winning combination. Italian style combined with the large economy of scale available through Chinese ownership have produced attractive models at very competitive costs.

== The Benelli and MotoBi Museum ==

The Benelli and MotoBi museum is located in Pesaro, in Viale Mameli 22, right in the former workshops of the original factory, in use until the end of the 80s.

Of the original plant was &quot;saved&quot; only a building of just over a thousand square meters, the only example of industrial archeology of the city, which became the seat of the Officine Benelli Museum, managed by the Moto Club &quot;Tonino Benelli&quot; and the Benelli Historical Register (R.S.B.).
The &quot;survivor&quot; building of the old Benelli factory, at the time used as a warehouse, was perfectly restored with the supervision of the Superintendence of Fine Arts in the 2000s. In its rooms there are about 200 Benelli, MotoBi and more motorcycles on permanent display and from spring 2021 you can admire the prestigious ASI-Morbidelli collection.

The itinerary starts from the room dedicated to Dr. Paolo Prosperi (co-founder and historical president of the Historic Benelli Register dead in 2020) in which you can admire some motorbikes &quot;symbol&quot; of the over 100-year history of the Pesarese house, photographs of riders, technicians and characters who gave lustre and glory to Benelli and MotoBi, trophies of every era and Benelli, MotoBi and Molaroni engines.

It continues in the large room dedicated to Ing. Giuseppe Benelli in which, in addition to the first motorcycle that passed through Pesaro in 1897, a tricycle De Dion Bouton and motorcycles with engine of all kinds, two very rare Molaroni specimens of the twenties, there are the Benelli motorbikes built before the Second World War and a wide range of MotoBi from 1950 to 1970.

In the third hall two examples of Letizia, all types of the Leoncino model, the two cylinders two stroke, the four cylinders and six cylinders four stroke of the De Tomaso period, some models for the US market and a large series of high and low wheel mopeds.

Then the exhibition continues on a mezzanine floor of about 250 square meters. with scaffolding and wooden roof, where the ASI-Morbidelli Collection was placed it consists of 71 models from 30 brands from 9 countries, all models prior to the S.G.M. and two car models BBC (Version &quot;Giardiniera&quot; and Autotelaio with engine) produced by Giuseppe Benelli, finally, on an ideal &quot;pit line&quot;, some rare examples of racing motorbikes built in the province of Pesaro and Urbino between the sixties and eighties: MotoBi, MBA, Morbidelli, Piovaticci and Sanvenero.

==Palmares==

Tonino Benelli, the younger of the six brothers, graduated as Italian Champion in 1927, 1928, 1930 and 1931, driving in the first three cases the Benelli 175 super sport monoalbero and in 1931 the bialbero. With the latter bike in 1932 will also conquer the square of honor in the European Championship, behind his teammate Carlo Baschieri. The Benelli motorcycles without Tonino, which had to interrupt his brilliant career as a driver in 1932 due to a serious accident occurred in the circuit of Tigullio, continued to reap successes and came to win again the European Title FICM in 1934 of the class &quot;175&quot; with the Belgian centaur Yvan Goor; in 1935 the world speed record of category of the Mile and the Km launched with the milanese rider Raffaele Alberti riding the &quot;250&quot; bialbero sport with 182.500 km/h; in 1939 the Tourist Trophy with the English Ted Mellors always with a &quot;250&quot; bialbero sport.

After the war Benelli won two world titles in the 250 class with the Italian Dario Ambrosini in the 1950 World Championship and with the Australian Kelvin Carruthers in the 1969 World Championship; has also established itself in five Italian Speed Championships in the 250 class with Dario Ambrosini (1950), with the Emilian Tarquinio Provini (1965, 1966), with the Rimini Renzo Pasolini (1968, 1969); in three Italian Speed Championships in the 350 class with Pesaro driver Silvio Grassetti (1967) and again with Pasolini (1968, 1969). Numerous were the affirmations and the placings in the classic of great bottom of the epoch, the Milan-Taranto and the Motogiro d&#x27;Italia, with the Leoncino 125, decidedly the most iconic motorbike of Benelli of the years 50/60.

The Trofeo Pesaro Mobili, held at Villa Fastiggi in Pesaro, was attended by the greatest names in world motorcycling of the time as Giacomo Agostini, Mike Hailwood, Jarno Saarinen and Renzo Pasolini. In 1971 &quot;Mike the Bike&quot; riding an old Benelli &quot;350&quot; came second behind &quot;Ago&quot; driving the three-cylinder MV Agusta.

In the 1972 edition Jarno Saarinen riding the brand new Benelli motorbikes 4 cylinder &quot;500&quot; and &quot;350&quot; wins in both classes beating respectively Giacomo Agostini on MV Agusta and Renzo Pasolini on Aermacchi. The era of De Tomaso begins in promising way, but this will be the first and the last competition of its management. In fact the Italian-Argentine businessman, after the death in Zandvoort of the English pilot Piers Courage, driving a De Tomaso F1,
did not want to know any more about racing. Benelli will only return to compete in the 2000s in WSBK with the &quot;Tornado 900 tre&quot;, the creature wanted by Andrea Merloni.

<text>Skeet shooting is a recreational and competitive activity whose participants use shotguns to attempt to break clay targets which two fixed stations mechanically fling into the air at high speed and at a variety of angles.

Skeet is one of the three major disciplines of competitive clay shooting—alongside trap shooting and sporting clays. There are several types of skeet, including one with Olympic status (often called &quot;Olympic skeet&quot; or &quot;international skeet&quot;), and many with only national recognition.

== General principles ==

For the American version of the sport, the clay discs are in diameter, thick, and fly a distance of .

The international version of skeet uses a target that is slightly larger in diameter [(110±1) mm vs. 109.54 mm], thinner in cross-section [(25.5±.5) mm vs. 28.58  mm], and has a thicker dome center, making it harder to break. International targets are also thrown a longer distance from similar heights, at over , resulting in higher target speed.

The firearm of choice for this task is usually a high-quality, double-barreled over and under shotgun with 24- to 32-inch barrels and very open chokes. Often, shooters will choose an improved cylinder choke (one with a tighter pattern) or a skeet choke (one with a wider pattern), but this is a matter of preference. Some gun shops refer to this type of shotgun as a skeet gun. Skeet chokes are designed to produce a 30 inch shot pattern at 21 yards.

Alternatively, a sporting gun or a trap gun is sometimes used. These have longer barrels (up to 34  inches) and tighter choke. Many shooters of American skeet and other national versions use semi-automatic shotguns and break-open over-and-under shotguns.

The event is in part meant to simulate the action of bird hunting. The shooter shoots from seven positions on a semicircle with a radius of , and an eighth position halfway between stations 1 and 7. There are two houses that hold devices known as &quot;traps&quot; that launch the targets, one at each corner of the semicircle. The traps launch the targets to a point above the ground and outside of station 8. One trap launches targets from above the ground (&quot;high&quot; house) and the other launches it from above the ground (&quot;low&quot; house).

At stations 1 and 2 the shooter shoots at single targets launched from the high house and then the low house, then shoots a double where the two targets are launched simultaneously but shooting the high house target first. At stations 3, 4, and 5 the shooter shoots at single targets launched from the high house and then the low house. At stations 6 and 7 the shooter shoots at single targets launched from the high house and then the low house, then shoots a double, shooting the low house target first then the high house target. At station 8 the shooter shoots one high target and one low target.

The shooter must then re-shoot his first missed target or, if no targets are missed, must shoot his 25th shell at the low house station 8. This 25th shot was once referred to as the shooter&#x27;s option, as he was able to take it where he preferred. Now, to speed up rounds in competition, the shooter must shoot the low 8 twice for a perfect score.

== History ==
Charles Davis and William Harnden Foster of Andover, Massachusetts invented skeet shooting. In 1920, Davis, an avid grouse hunter, and Foster, an avid hunter, painter, illustrator and author of &quot;New England Grouse Hunting&quot;, developed a game which was informally called &quot;Shooting around the clock&quot;. The original course took the form of a circle with a radius of 25 yards with its circumference marked off like the face of a clock and a trap set at the 12-o&#x27;clock position. The practice of shooting from all directions had to cease, however, when a chicken farm started next door. The game evolved to its current setup by 1923, when one of the shooters, William Harnden Foster, solved the problem by placing a second trap at the 6-o&#x27;clock position and cutting the course in half. Foster quickly noticed the appeal of that kind of competition shooting, and set out to make it a national sport.

The sport was introduced in the February 1926 issues of &quot;National Sportsman&quot; and &quot;Hunting and Fishing&quot; magazines, and a prize of 100 dollars was offered to anyone who could come up with a name for the new sport. The winning entry was &quot;skeet&quot;, chosen by Gertrude Hurlbutt. The word allegedly derived from the Norwegian word for &quot;shoot&quot; (&quot;skyte&quot;). The first National Skeet Championship took place in 1926. Shortly thereafter, the National Skeet Shooting Association formed. During World War II the American military used skeet shooting to teach gunners the principles of leading and timing on a flying target. 

For his role in perfecting and developing the sport, William &quot;Bill&quot; Foster was named as one of the first members to the National Skeet Shooters Association Hall of Fame in 1970, and is now known as &quot;The Father of Skeet&quot;.

==Olympic skeet==

Olympic and international skeet is one of the ISSF shooting events. It has had Olympic status since 1968, and, until 1992, was open to both sexes. After that year, all ISSF events have been open to men only, and so women were disallowed to compete in the Olympic skeet competitions in 1996. This was controversial because the 1992 Olympic Champion, Zhang Shan of China, was a woman. However, women continued to have their own World Championships, and in 2000, a separate women&#x27;s skeet event was introduced to the Olympic program.

In Olympic skeet, there is a random delay of between 0 and 3 seconds after the shooter has called for the target. Also, the shooter must hold his gun so that the buttstock is at mid-torso level until the target appears.

Another difference with American skeet is that the sequence to complete the 25 targets in a round of Olympic skeet requires shooters to shoot at doubles, not only in stations 1, 2, 6, and 7, as in American skeet, but also on 3, 4, and 5. This includes a reverse double (low house first) on station 4. This last double was introduced in the sequence starting in 2005.

With her bronze in women&#x27;s skeet shooting at the 2016 Rio Olympic games, Kim Rhode became the first American to medal in 6 successive Olympic games. Her prior Olympic medals were for trap shooting in 1996, 2000 and 2004 and for skeet shooting in 2008 and 2012.

==US national variant==

American skeet is administered by the National Skeet Shooting Association (NSSA). The targets are shot in a different order and are slower than in Olympic skeet. There is also no delay after the shooter has called for them, and the shooter may do this with the gun held &quot;up&quot;, i.e. pre-mounted on the shoulder (as is allowed in trap shooting).

A full tournament is typically conducted over the course of five events. These include four events each shot with a different maximum permissible gauge. These gauges are 12, 20, 28, and .410 bore. The fifth event, usually shot first in a five event competition, is Doubles, during which a pair of targets is thrown simultaneously at stations 1 through 7, and then from station 6 back through either station 2 or 1, depending on the round. The maximum gauge permitted in Doubles is 12 gauge. Each of the five events usually consists of 100 targets (four standard boxes of ammunition). All ties in potential winning scores are broken by shoot offs, usually sudden death by station, and usually shot as doubles, from stations 3, 4 and 5. Tournament management has the right to change the shoot format with respect to the order in which events are conducted, the number of events in a given shoot, and the rules governing shoot offs.

Each event normally constitutes a separate championship. In addition, the scores in the four singles events are combined to crown a High Over All (&quot;HOA&quot;) champion for the tournament, a coveted title. On occasion, the scores for all five events are also combined, to determine the High All Around (&quot;HAA&quot;) champion.

The requisite use of the small bore shotguns, including the difficult .410, is a major differentiation between the American version of the sport and the international version. Some would argue that it makes the American version at least as difficult as the International version, though perhaps at greater expense, given the necessity of one or more guns capable of shooting in all events.

Recognizing that a high level of perfection is beyond the skill, interest, or time available to most shooters, NSSA competitions are subdivided into several classes, each based on the running average score shot over the last five most recent events shot in each gauge, prior to any given competition. This permits shooters of roughly equal ability at the relevant point in time to compete against each other for the individual and HOA titles in their class.

Other national versions of skeet (e.g., English skeet) typically make similar changes to the rules to make them easier or more difficult.

<doc id="249493" wikidata="Q217815" url="?curid=249493" title="Nakhi people">
<text>The Nakhi, Nashi, or Naxi (; Naxi: ) are a people inhabiting the Hengduan Mountains abutting the Eastern Himalayas in the northwestern part of Yunnan Province, as well as the southwestern part of Sichuan Province in China.

The Nakhi are thought to have come originally from northwestern China, migrating south toward Tibetan-populated regions, and usually inhabiting the most fertile riverside land, driving the other competing tribes farther up the hillsides onto less fertile land. The Nakhi traded over the dangerous overland trading links with Lhasa and India, on the so-called tea and horse caravan routes.

The Nakhi form one of the 56 ethnic groups officially recognized by the People&#x27;s Republic of China. The official Chinese government classification includes the Mosuo as part of the Nakhi people.

Nakhi culture is largely its own native Dongba religious, literary, and farming practices, influenced by the Confucian roots of Han Chinese history. Especially in the case of their musical scores, it acts as the foundation of the Nakhi literature. The Nakhi have their own writing, their own distinct language and their own native dress.

==Art and architecture==

There are many arts that are native to the Nakhi people, such as the rarely seen Nakhi handmade embroidery, Dongba painting, Dongba wooden carving and so on. Much of the wood carving that characterizes Nakhi houses are made by Bai craftsmen today. Absorbing architectural styles of the Han, Nakhi houses are built in a standard Han style of one courtyard with one, two, three or four buildings around it, sometimes with linked adjoining courtyards. The mud brick and wood structures have been described at first sight as crude and simple in appearance, but a closer inspection reveals elaborate and delicate patterns on casements and doors, elegant pillars and pillar supports, and a very comfortable and airy living environment.

Nakhi temples are decorated on the interior with carvings on poles, arches and wall paintings that often exhibit a unique combination of Dongba and Buddhist influences. The decorations include depictions of episodes from epics, dancers, warriors, animals and birds, and flowers. The mural paintings depict Dongba gods, and stylistically are derived from Han Chinese interpretations of Tibetan Buddhist themes. A good example is the Delwada Temple.

&quot;There are strong arguments that support the idea that in the past the main ritual activity performed on a temporal basis was the worship of Shu nature spirits on the first days (usually on a dragon or snake day) of the second lunar month, and that this was the traditional New Year of the Nakhi. In Baidi, where the old traditions have been preserved, this is the most important festival, when everybody dressed in their best clothes, gathers around the Baishuitai terrace in a festive atmosphere and pay respect to the Shu gods of nature.&quot; ... &quot;Around the same time when the Shu Nature spirits are worshiped in Baidi, the people gather to honour Sanduo in Baisha and Lijiang.&quot;... &quot;Worship of Heaven ceremony, celebrated some days before Worshiping Shu, is a ritual celebration to remember that Nakhi ancestors came from Heaven, and that therefore they descend also from a celestial lineage.&quot; The New Year is nowadays the main festival for the Nakhi of Lijiang. the New Year is considered a time of renovation for humans, their houses and their fields, a time of spiritual and physical rebirth when every person must be born again, clean and uncontaminated from the hard existence of the previous year (Ceinos 2012).

The Nakhi celebrate the annual Torch Festival on the 24th and 25th of the sixth month of the Lunar calendar, which corresponds approximately to July 8–9, and the Sanduo Festival on February 8.

According to legend, Sanduo is a war god who defends the local people. In ancient times, a hunter discovered a strange stone on Jade Dragon Mountain, and carried the stone home. On his way home, he had to put the stone down for a rest, because it was extremely heavy. When he decided to continue his trip, he could no longer lift the stone, and many thought that it was the embodiment of a god. The Nakhi later built a temple to honour this god, whom they later named Sanduo, and depicted as an immortal in a white coat and a white helmet, carrying a white spear and riding a white horse. They believed that Sanduo would protect the local people and their land. Because Sanduo was thought to have been born in the year of the Goat, it is sacrificed at his festival.

==Clothing==
The Nakhi women wear wide-sleeved loose gowns accompanied by jackets and long trousers, tied with richly decorated belts at the waist. Sheepskin is worn over the shoulder. Especially in Ninglang County, the women wear short jackets and long skirts reaching the ground with several folds. Large black cotton turbans are worn around their heads, which are accompanied with big silver earrings. The men&#x27;s costume is much like that of Han Chinese. In modern times, traditional dress is rarely worn among the younger generation. It is now usually only worn at cultural events and on special occasions.

==Language==
The language is written with Geba script and Dongba script.

==Music==

The Nakhi have several indigenous forms of music, including &quot;baisha xiyue&quot; and the Chinese-inspired &quot;dongjing&quot; discussed above.

==Society==
Nakhi from the northern region, Yongning (), recognized at the provincial level as a separate group, the Na (Mosuo), are known to be matrilineal and matrilocal, i.e. parentage is by the mother and all children – men and women – live in the house of the mother, from birth until death. Their family system is different from the one we know in the West since marriage – that is to say the recognition of a union of individuals by an institution – does not exist. The practice of sexual life is free between non-consanguineous adults: at night, the man goes to the woman with whom he would like to have sex, the woman being free to accept or not. Both men and women are free to have multiple partners. As a result, children do not always know their biological father. The children are raised by the inhabitants of the household, the maternal uncles assuming the role of &quot;father&quot; as understood in the West. This conception stems in part from one of their beliefs presenting the man as the rain on the grass: it serves to foster what is already there. The reproductive role of the man is thus to &quot;water&quot; the fetus already present in the woman. For Nakhi, hereditary characters are contained in bones, and are transmitted by women. However, with the opening to tourism and the exile of some inhabitants, manners tend to change, some Na (Mosuo) people conforming to the monogamous couple.

These practices, which are still observable in the 21st century among the Na, are no longer practiced among the Naxi since the implementation of Confucian practices decided by the lords of Lijiang.

==Traditions==
Cremation has been a tradition since ancient times, although burial was adopted in most Nakhi areas during the late Qing Dynasty and remains the preferred method of disposing of the dead today. Religious scriptures are chanted at the funeral ceremony to expiate the sins of the dead.

Among the Nakhi in Yongning County in Yunnan and the Yanyuan County in Sichuan, there still exist remnants of the Mosuo matrilineal family structure, which was vigorously but unsuccessfully eradicated during the Communist era.

As the heads of the family, a woman leaves her inheritance to her descendants either from the mother, or through her sisters and their offspring.

In Nakhi society, women do most of the household and farm work, and while they keep to the kitchen when guests are present, they are essential to the household and are therefore influential in family decisions.

A few Nakhi men carry on the ancient Chinese tradition of hunting with falcons. This practice is rarely found in other parts of China today.

==History==
The Nakhi, like Mosuo, are believed to be the descendants of the nomadic proto-Qiang. 

Frequently harassed by neighboring tribes, the proto-Nakhi then moved southward to the banks of the Nujiang River and the Jinsha River and then to the Along River in the present-day province of Sichuan in western China. After being pushed south by other conquering tribes, the Nashi settled in the very fertile Baisha and Lijiang areas by the year 3 CE.

Nakhi histories describe a split into three groups while their ancestors were still in Baisha. The ones who remained are known as the Nashi, those in Dali are known as Bai, and those living around the Lugu Lake are called the Mosuo. Today, this description of the origins of the Bai and Mosuo is strenuously contested.

Historians have decided that between the tenth and thirteenth centuries, agricultural production in Lijiang replaced livestock breeding as the main occupation of the people. The production of agricultural, handicraft, mineral, and livestock products led to considerable prosperity, and during this period a number of slave-owning groups in Ninglang, Lijiang, and Weixi counties developed into a feudal caste of lords. Tibetan Buddhism took hold in the Lijiang region following visits from the Karmapas from the fourteenth century onwards.

In 1278, the Yuan dynasty established the Lijiang Prefecture, which represented the imperial court in Yunnan. A chieftain, Mude, was made the hereditary chieftain of Lijiang Prefecture, exercising control over the Nakhi people and other ethnic groups (particularly the Eastern Tibetans inhabiting the region of Kham) during the Ming dynasty. The hereditary chieftains from the Mu family collected taxes and tribute, which then went to the Ming court in the form of silver and grains. The Ming relied on the Mu family as the mainstay for the control of the people of various ethnic groups in northwestern Yunnan Province.

In 1723, during the Qing dynasty, hereditary local chieftains in the Lijiang area were replaced by court officials, and the Mu chieftains were included in this group retaining position as local administrators.

The ancient Nakhi town of Lijiang is now a major tourist destination. In the old town, the Nakhi rent buildings to Han merchants who run shops catering to tourists.

In 2005, Kuang Jianren, a famous Chinese film script writer produced &quot;Snow Bracelet&quot;, a film based on the life of Nakhi ethnic minorities in Yunnan.

==Religion==
The Nakhi are traditionally led by their native Dongbas in matters pertaining to religion. Through both Han Chinese and other cultural influences, Tibetan Buddhism has gained widespread respect (especially in the case of the Mosuo). Taoism, and particularly its &quot;fengshui&quot; practices have been widely practiced since the tenth century.

===Dongba===
Dongba religion is rooted in the beliefs of the Tibetan Bön religion; the word &quot;Dongba&quot; literally means &quot;wise man&quot; in the Nakhi language. Nakhi legend traces Dongba&#x27;s origins to a Bön shaman from eastern Tibet named Ton-pa Shen-rab (丁巴什罗), who lived in a cave near Baishuitai during the 12th century.

Anthropologists claim that many of the Dongba rituals show strong influences from the Bön religion, and are not native in origin. Bön lamas are believed to have settled among the Nashi as farmers, and to have begun to practice exorcisms as a way of earning a little money on the side; they were thus in competition with the native ritual specialists, locally known as &quot;Llü-bu&quot;, or &quot;Ssan-nyi&quot;. This is disputed, largely because the Bon religion is so adulterated by Tibetan Buddhism today that it is difficult to find pure and authentic practitioners to use as a basis for comparison.

Religious scriptures suggest that the Llü-bu were female shamans who practiced divination, exorcism, and other rites in a trance. By the early nineteenth century, the Dongba priests had created a huge religious vocabulary accompanied by a variety of rituals, and had largely displaced the Llü-bu. This is certainly the case with Yi shamans, but the connection to Dongba practices remains unclear.

Adherents of Dongba had no places of worship, and so they were not officially recognized as a religion by the Communists following their arrival to the region. A Dongba shaman is merely a part-time practitioner priest, who is literate in Dongba religious texts that were unreadable by most Nashi, who are not usually taught to read their own language.

The Dongba religion is based on the relationship between nature and man. In Dongba mythology, &quot;Nature&quot; and &quot;Man&quot; are half-brothers, having different mothers. According to the villagers of Shu Ming Village, nature is controlled by spirits called &quot;Shv&quot;. These gods are depicted as human-snake chimeras. The Dongba priests practice rituals such as the &quot;Shv Gu&quot; to appease these spirits and prevent their anger from boiling into natural disasters such as earthquakes and droughts.

Before communist rule in China, many villages still had shrines or places of worship dedicated to nature gods, such as Shu. Nakhi inhabitants of Tacheng, which is in the Lijiang-Nakhi Autonomous county, still profess belief in the &quot;nature and man&quot; relationship.

Their attitude towards nature is clearly illustrated by the story of He Shun, a Dongba priest, who forbade his three sons to cut down more trees than they personally needed, as this would anger the gods and bring misfortune to his family.

One of the most widely practised Dongba rituals, &quot;Zzerq Ciul Zhuaq&quot; (literally, to repay the debts of a tree), has been described in the village of Shuming. The ritual was conducted if somebody was stricken with illness or bad luck, when a Dongba priest would be consulted. On many occasions, the result would show that the person had carried out logging or washing of dirty things in the forest, and the family or person concerned would have to ask the Dongba priest to hold the ritual near where the activity had taken place, and apologize to the nature god Shu.

Being a conservative people, the villagers prohibited logging, and even the cutting of tree branches and gathering of dry pine-needles from the coniferous trees wasn&#x27;t generally allowed. The gathering of pine needles was only allowed in July, when the forests were lush and green. However, only one person from each household was allowed to do this job, in order to enforce fairness between households with more or fewer laborers. (Dry pine needles are mixed with pig manure for fertilizer. Green pine needles are used as a ground covering in courtyards during celebrations)

The elders, locally known as &quot;Lao Min&quot; (), would watch all these activities. The elders also voluntarily carried out the public affairs of the village. Traditionally, they played an important role, which still influences many villages. 

Especially in Longquan, the villagers have traditional regulations for logging and firewood collection. Known as &quot;Jjuq-ssaiq&quot; or &quot;Jjuq-Hal-Keel&quot; by the local people, this refers to the regular logging of trees and firewood every two to three years in the forested area near the particular village. A group of people comprising the Lao Min, the village headman, and the mountain guards will organize the procedure in advance. Even in recent years, Nakhi villages still retain an organization that protects the forests. This organization is administered by the members of the village committee, which necessarily includes the heads of the agricultural Productive Cooperatives, the members of the female union, and the village mountain guard.

Until the communists came to power in China in 1949, villagers followed these traditional principles and tried to use the natural resources conservatively, with thought for the preservation of the natural resources for future generations. However, after 1949 serious cultural and social change came to the Nakhi, and the government encouraged logging by the Han army in Nakhi areas, which in turn led to a loss of influence of the traditional customs.

===Tibetan Buddhism===
Many of the Nakhi embrace the Kagyu lineage of Tibetan Buddhism, resulting from the presence of the eighth and the tenth Karmapas in the Lijiang area during the fourteenth century. Over the years, the Nakhi in Lijiang built Buddhist Gompas, which acted as the place of worship for the Nakhi Buddhist community. The first monastery, Ogmin Namling at Lashiba, was founded by the tenth Karmapa, Chöying Dorje. Religious Mani stones can also be found in some of the Nakhi households.

The Nakhi king invited the eighth Karmapa, Mikyö Dorje to Lijiang in 1516. The king, worried about the safety of the Karmapa on his long journey to Lijiang, dispatched an army of four generals and ten thousand soldiers to accompany him. On the third day of the fourth month, the Karmapa reached the border between Tibet and the Nakhi kingdom. Accompanied by his brother and his uncle, who were both riding elephants and escorted by many riders on horseback, the Nakhi king, riding on a palanquin, received them with this magnificent welcome. The king prostrated himself before the Karmapa, the elephants broke their tethers and bowed down three times before him, and raised their trunks to the sky trumpeting loud as thunderclaps.

==Introduction to the West==
They were brought to the attention of the Western world by two men: the American botanist Joseph Rock and the Russian traveler and writer Peter Goullart, both of whom lived in Lijiang and traveled throughout the area during the early 20th century. Peter Goullart&#x27;s book &quot;Forgotten Kingdom&quot; describes the life and beliefs of the Nakhi and neighboring peoples, while Joseph Rock&#x27;s legacy includes diaries, maps, and photographs of the region, many of which were published in National Geographic.

US TV series The Amazing Race 18 had also introduced the Nakhi people to its viewers whilst visiting Lijiang.

<text>John Zephaniah Holwell (17 September 1711 – 5 November 1798) was a surgeon, an employee of the British East India Company, and a temporary Governor of Bengal (1760). He was also one of the first Europeans to study Indian antiquities and was an early advocate of animal rights and vegetarianism.

==Biography==

Holwell was a survivor of the Black Hole of Calcutta, June 1756, the incident in which British subjects and others were crammed into a small poorly ventilated chamber overnight, with many deaths. Holwell&#x27;s account of this incident (1757) obtained wide circulation in England and some claim this gained support for the East India Company&#x27;s conquest of India. His account of the incident was not publicly questioned during his lifetime nor for more than a century after his death. However, in recent years, his version of the event has been called into question by many historians.

Holwell has also become an important source for modern historians of medicine, as a result of his description of the practice of smallpox variolation in eighteenth-century Bengal, &quot;An Account of the Manner of Inoculating for the Small Pox in the East Indies with Some Observations on the Practice and Mode of Treating that Disease in those Parts&quot; (London, 1767).

Born in Dublin, he grew up in London, and studied medicine at Guy&#x27;s Hospital. He gained employment as a surgeon in the British East India Company and was sent to India in 1732. He served in this capacity until 1749. In 1751, he was appointed as zemindar of the Twenty-four Parganas District of Bengal. He then served as a member of the Council of Fort William (Calcutta) and defended the settlement against Siraj Ud Daulah in 1756. He later succeeded Robert Clive as temporary Governor of Bengal in 1760, but was dismissed from the Council in 1761 for remonstrating against the appointment of Henry Vansittart as Governor of Bengal. He was elected Fellow of the Royal Society in 1767.

==Study of Hinduism==

Holwell was one of the first British travellers to study Hinduism. He came to believe that the Hindu scriptures completed and unlocked a secret meaning of the Bible. He wrote about this in the second and third volumes of his work &quot;Interesting Historical Events, Relative to the Provinces of Bengal, and the Empire of Indostan&quot; (1765–1771).

Holwell was a believer in metempsychosis (transmigration of souls). He came to the conclusion that the fundamental doctrine of the brahmins was that God (the Eternal one) had created angelic beings but they rebelled and so were condemned to be punished, with the possibility of earning a return to grace by passing through a series of rebirths to regain paradise. He held the view that all animals and humans were fallen angels.

Holwell suggested that the Greeks and Egyptians took their belief in metempsychosis from the brahmins. Holwell stated that all religions have much in common but only the Hindu scriptures have all the truths fully articulated. He wrote that Moses&#x27;s version of the creation and Fall of Man is &quot;clogged with too many incomprehensible difficulties to gain our belief&quot;, and is only made intelligible with the Hindu doctrine that humankind are fallen angels.

Holwell was a vegetarian and opposed the Cartesian view that animals are machines without souls. He argued that animals were not created for domination or use by man. He stated that meat and the killing of animals is a violation of man&#x27;s original nature and is the cause of moral and physical evil.

Holwell believed that metempsychosis accounted for the problem of Original sin as the Fall of Man had occurred in heaven long before the creation of Adam and Eve who were fallen angels. In regard to Christianity, Holwell identified as a Christian deist, which was consistent with his belief in transmigration of souls and his enthusiasm for Hinduism.

<text>Job Corps is a program administered by the United States Department of Labor that offers free education and vocational training to young people ages 16 to 24.

== Mission and purpose ==

Job Corps&#x27; mission is to help young people ages 16 through 24 improve the quality of their lives through vocational and academic training aimed at gainful employment and career pathways.

== History ==
===Founding===
The Job Corps was originally designed by a task force established by Labor Secretary Willard Wirtz reporting to Manpower Administrator Sam Merrick. In 1962, the youth unemployment rate was twice the non-youth unemployment rate and the purpose of the initiative was to create a program whereby Youth members of the program could spend half of their time improving national parks and forests and the other half of their time improving their basic education skills which were severely limiting their occupational accomplishments. The Job Corps Task Force initially recommended that Job Corps programs be limited to Federal National Parks, National Forests, and other Federal Lands.

By the time of the Kennedy assassination in 1963, the Job Corps&#x27; operational plans, costs, and budgets had been well developed, including coordination with the U. S. Forest Service and the National Park Service, and Memoranda of Understanding (MOUs) executed among the agencies. Initiating legislation and budgetary authorizations were drafted by the Kennedy Administration and introduced in both houses of Congress.

In 1964, President Johnson, facing military manpower shortages for the Vietnam War, suggested that the Job Corps could be useful in preparing young men to meet the mental and physical requirements for military enlistment.

When President Johnson and his planning staff decided on the war on poverty, most of the proposed programs would take more than a year to even start. However the Job Corps idea was well along in the planning stage and could be deployed rapidly, so the Labor Department Job Corps Task Force was appointed to the Task force for the War on Poverty, and the Job Corps was slated to be the initial operational program.

Job Corps was therefore initiated as the central program of the Johnson Administration&#x27;s War on Poverty, part of his domestic agenda known as the Great Society. Sargent Shriver, the first Director of the Office of Economic Opportunity, modeled the program on the Depression-era Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC). Established in the 1930s as an emergency relief program, the CCC provided room, board, and employment to thousands of unemployed young people. Though the CCC was discontinued after World War II, Job Corps built on many of its methods and strategies.

The first National Director of the Job Corps program was Dr. S. Stephen Uslan, who was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson and reported directly to Sargent Shriver. The current national director of the Office of Job Corps is Rachel Torres. The Job Corps program is currently authorized under Title I of the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act.

===20th Century===
President Richard Nixon sought to shrink the program, and President Ronald Reagan sought to eliminate it, but the program continued with bipartisan Congressional support.

===21st Century===
A series of audits, studies and investigations -- public and private -- starting in the late 1990s, and extending through to the early 2020s, cast doubt on the safety and cost-effectiveness of the program, and have brought calls for the program&#x27;s end. But bipartisan Congressional support has kept the program alive.

With a $1.7 billion annual budget (in 2014 and 2018), it is the U.S. Department of Labor&#x27;s largest-budget training program, providing about 37,000 training slots for young people annually.

Starting in 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic triggered the closure of Job Corps physical sites, and the organization attempted to shift to online education. Enrollment dropped by about 75 percent.

Since its inception in 1964 under the Economic Opportunity Act, Job Corps has served more than 2 million young people. As of 2019, Job Corps serves over 60,000 youths annually at Job Corps centers throughout the country.

== Eligibility ==

People are eligible for Job Corps by meeting the following criteria:

* Is a legal U.S. resident; lawfully admitted permanent resident alien, refugee, or asylee, or other immigrant who has been authorized by the U.S. attorney general to work in the United States; or resident of a U.S. territory.
* Meets low-income criteria.
* Is 16 to 24 years of age.°
* Does not have specific criminal convictions or active probation.
* Is in need of additional technical training, education, or related assistance to complete schoolwork or to find and keep a job.
* Has signed consent from a parent or guardian if a minor.
* Does not exhibit behavioral problems that could prevent them or others from experiencing Job Corps’ full benefits.
* Does not use prohibited drugs.

°Unless waived due to disability.

== Phases of career development ==

Applicants to the Job Corps program are identified and screened for eligibility by organizations contracted by the U.S. Department of Labor. Each student in the Job Corps goes through three stages of the program:

Career Preparation: This period focuses on the assimilation of the student to Job Corps academic assessment, health screening, career exploration, and instruction on career planning. This phase lasts for up to the first 60 days of enrollment.

Career Development: This period is where the student receives all vocational training, academic instruction, employability and social skills development, and driver&#x27;s education.

Career Transition: The period is preceded by a focus on transition readiness, and is the phase of services that immediately follows a student after they leave Job Corps. Career Transition Specialists assist with job placement or searches, and provide support and referrals for housing, transportation, and other essential components of living needed by the former student to obtain and retain employment.

== Career paths ==

Career Technical Training programs (often called vocational programs) offered by Job Corps vary by campus location. Example careers include machinist, auto mechanic, electrician, 911 dispatcher, dental assistant, corrections officer, cook, computer technician, landscaper, and truck driver.

== Locations ==

There are a total of 121 Job Corps centers, including one in Washington, D.C., and two in Puerto Rico.

There are six Regional Offices of Job Corps:

* Atlanta Region
* Boston Region
* Chicago Region
* Dallas Region
* Philadelphia Region
* San Francisco Region

== Evaluations ==

In Program Year 2012, approximately 75 percent of Job Corps’ graduates were reportedly placed. Slightly more than 60 percent joined the workforce or enlisted in the military, while 13.5 percent of Job Corps’ graduates enrolled in education programs. However, analysts have suggested that the data fails to reflect that many of the job placements were in low-skill, low-wage jobs that they could have gotten without Job Corps participation, such as fast-food work or the military.
===Mathematica===

From 1993 to 2008, Princeton University affiliate research organization Mathematica produced a series of evaluations and reports on the Job Corps for the agency&#x27;s parent, the U.S. Department of Labor, and for independent academic journals. Their long-term study involved repeated nationwide surveys of over 6,800 Job Corps participants, and a &quot;control group&quot; of over 4,400 comparable non-participants, over a four-year period -- and, in some reports, used the government-held, employer-reported tax records of individual workers for analysis of the survey subjects&#x27; economic outcomes.

Their researchers ultimately concluded that &quot;the Job Corps model&quot; shows &quot;promise&quot; -- adding that the program&#x27;s effect on participating youth &quot;increases [their] educational attainment, reduces [their] criminal activity, and increases [their] earnings for several postprogram years.&quot; However, they noted that &quot;tax data&quot; indicated that -- except for &quot;the oldest participants&quot; (young adults in their early 20s) -- most participants&#x27; &quot;earnings gains were not sustained&quot; beyond four years after leaving the program.

That said, Mathematica concluded that the Job Corps is &quot;the only federal training program... shown to increase earnings for this [disadvantaged youth] population.&quot;

However, the cost of the program, they concluded, exceeds the overall positive economic impact on society (from slightly improved social outcomes, like reduced crime and reduced welfare expenditures). One of the study&#x27;s leaders, Mathematica senior fellow Peter Schochet, asserted that the program is &quot;a good deal for... enrollees themselves,&quot; but acknowledged that -- &quot;from society&#x27;s perspective&quot; -- &quot;the [Job Corps] program... does not pay for itself.&quot;

===Heritage Foundation===
In 2009, during the Obama administration, the conservative Heritage Foundation political think-tank described the program&#x27;s 40-year history as a &quot;record of failure&quot; -- citing specific findings from that Mathematica journal article, including that Job Corps participants were less likely than non-participants to &quot;earn a high school diploma&quot;; not any more likely to complete, or even attend, college; and earnings of Job Corps participants were essentially the same as a &quot;control group&quot; of similar non-participants.

In their 2009 critique, additionally citing a 2001 Mathematica study, the Heritage Foundation noted that income gains for participants (vs. comparable non-participants) was &quot;never more than $25.20&quot; per week, while they cited a 2003 Mathematica study (withheld from the public by the government until 2006) as indicating negative impacts on childless female participants&#x27; incomes from 1998 through 2001. 

Complaining that Job Corps fails to &quot;substantially raise the wages of participants&quot; -- at a cost of &quot;$25,000 per participant&quot; for an eight-month &quot;average participation period&quot; -- the Heritage Foundation described the agency as &quot;a waste of taxpayers&#x27; dollars,&quot; and &quot;an ideal candidate&quot; to be on &quot;the budget chopping block.&quot;

===Government Accountability Office===
A report from the Government Accountability Office cited over 13,500 safety incidents at Job Corps centers from 2016 to 2017 -- most of them drug-related or assaults.

===Trump administration===

In April 2017, the Trump administration&#x27;s Labor Department inspector general concluded that the agency could not show &quot;beneficial training outcomes.&quot;

==Controversy==

While the Job Corps has remained popular with politicians in both parties (and with private contractors who operate and service Job Corps centers), there have been many critics of the program, from liberal and conservative sources, alike, and questions raised about the program&#x27;s safety and effectiveness.

Anecdotal evidence against the program, at specific sites, multiplied in the 2010s.

In October 2014, CBS News reported on its investigation of a Job Corps training center in North Texas, quoting a student as experiencing &quot;constant fights&quot; (though one attacker strangled him, the attacker was allowed to continue in the program). They quoted a fired security guard, a former police sergeant, as witnessing drug use (&quot;marijuana, cocaine, heroin&quot;) but being pressured by management to keep quiet about it, despite the official Job Corps &quot;zero tolerance&quot; for drug use. (CBS obtained video of a student cutting a white powder on his desk). Student expulsions reportedly hurt contractor and agency standing.

CBS interviewed a former Albuquerque center teacher who alleged that welding students who failed to attend training were given welding-competence certificates, anyway, to take into the workforce. A former career counselor in Texas reported that management pressure to get &quot;job placements&quot; resulted in &quot;85 percent&quot; of reported placements being &quot;fake.&quot; CBS noted that 3 years earlier, the Labor Department&#x27;s inspector general determined that Job Corps had &quot;overstated 42 percent&quot; of job placements at five sites -- and that many of the reported jobs were simply in fast food work.

A CBS affiliate in Milwaukee checked records on their local Job Corps center, and found 11 police reports between 2012-2014, including a knife attack and a student shot.

In 2015, the &quot;Washington Post&quot; noted &quot;violence and even murders&quot; had occurred &quot;at some Job Corps sites,&quot; and -- &quot;despite [an official] zero-tolerance policy [forbidding] violence and illegal drugs&quot; -- [various] &quot;local job corps centers... failed to report and investigate [incidents of] serious misconduct, [such as] drug abuse and assaults,&quot; including &quot;sexual assault.&quot; Further, the &quot;Post&quot; reported, some centers have reportedly understated these offenses, in their official record, to keep student offenders enrolled.

However, progressive philanthropy advocate and watchdog Rick Cohen, writing in &quot;Nonprofit Quarterly,&quot; expressed skepticism of complaints, suggesting that many of these problems were not abnormal for that demographic, whether in Job Corps or not -- and suggested that racial bias may have played a role in suspicions and reporting of perceived problems.

In 2017, Labor Department deputy inspector general Larry D. Turner, testifying before a Congressional committee, reported that Job Corps officials and contractors often failed to report &quot;potentially serious criminal misconduct&quot; to local, state or federal law enforcement -- noting that, of the 12 centers inspectors visited (out of 129), all but one failed to report to law enforcement various &quot;potentially
serious criminal misconduct incidents,&quot; leaving 40 percent of 348 such incidents unreported at those 11 sites. He also noted that Job Corps sites typically had &quot;Physical security weaknesses&quot; (such as &quot;inadequate [or] unmonitored closed circuit television systems,&quot; inadequate security staff, and &quot;compromised perimeters,&quot; and failed to properly screen center employees.&quot;

Job Corps defenders argued that critics were overreacting to these shortcomings, which were not atypical of conditions in innercity and rural settings that Job Corps participants were fleeing.

In 2017, with per-student costs ranging from $15,000 to $45,000, President Trump&#x27;s Labor Secretary, Alexander Acosta, stated that the $1.7 billion annually budgeted program &quot;requires fundamental reform&quot; -- not just &quot;changes at the margins,&quot; but &quot;large-scale changes.&quot;

<doc id="249508" wikidata="Q249662" url="?curid=249508" title="Nagoya Grampus">
<text>; formerly known as is a Japanese association football club that plays in the J1 League, and have for all but one season since the inauguration of the league, following promotion from the J2 League in 2017.

Based in Nagoya, Aichi Prefecture and founded as the company team of the Toyota Motor Corp. in 1939, the club shares its home games between Mizuho Athletic Stadium (capacity 27,000 and the J.League&#x27;s oldest serving stadium) and the much larger Toyota Stadium in the city of Toyota (capacity 45,000).

Grampus had its most successful season up to 1996 when it was managed by Arsène Wenger, well known for his subsequent exploits at Arsenal. They won the Emperor&#x27;s Cup and finished second in the J.League, with their FR Yugoslavia captain Dragan Stojković being named J.League MVP. The 1995 success was eclipsed on November 20, 2010, when the club won its first J.League trophy, under the management of Stojković.

The team&#x27;s name was derived from two prominent symbols of Nagoya. The first is the &quot;shachihoko&quot; (tiger-headed carp) statues atop Nagoya Castle, also called &quot;shachi&quot;; this word is a homophone with the Japanese word for orca, a species formerly referred to as &quot;grampus&quot;. The second is the &quot;maru-hachi&quot; (circle-eight), Nagoya&#x27;s official emblem. The team&#x27;s mascot is Grampus-kun, an orca.

==History==

=== Japan Soccer League era ===
Toyota Motor SC was overshadowed by its colleague Toyota Automated Loom Works SC (founded in 1946 and which was one of the founding members of the Japan Soccer League). When Toyota ALW were relegated to regional leagues in 1968, Toyota Motor saw an opportunity to rise at their expense.

In 1972, the club was founding members of the JSL&#x27;s Second Division and its inaugural champions. They remained in the JSL until the J.League&#x27;s founding in 1993. They were relegated to the JSL Division 2 in 1977. In 1990, the club name was changed to &quot;Nagoya Grampus Eight&quot;.

After a brief return in 1987–88, they were promoted for good in 1989–90 and remained in the top flight for 26 years, until 2016.

===J.League era ===

Grampus Eight was an original member (&quot;Original Ten&quot;) of the J.League in 1993. In 1996, future Arsenal manager Arsène Wenger led Grampus to the 1996 Emperor&#x27;s Cup and a runners-up finish in the J.League, the club&#x27;s best finish.

The team&#x27;s name &quot;Nagoya Grampus Eight&quot; was changed to just &quot;Nagoya Grampus&quot; at the start of the 2008 season. In 2008, Nagoya appointed former player Dragan Stojković as manager. They finished in third place and qualified for the AFC Champions League for the first time. Stojković has since led the club to winning the J.League in the 2010 season, featuring a squad consisting of Marcus Tulio Tanaka, Mu Kanazaki, Seigo Narazaki, Yoshizumi Ogawa, Keiji Tamada and Joshua Kennedy.
After a poor 2016 season, Grampus were relegated to J2 League for the first time in their history. Boško Gjurovski left his post as manager. On 4 January 2017, Yahiro Kazama was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager. On 3 December 2017, Grampus drew 0–0 against Avispa Fukuoka in the promotion playoff final, securing promotion back to J1 League at the first time of asking due to their higher regular season position than Avispa Fukuoka.
On 23 September 2019, Massimo Ficcadenti was appointed as the club&#x27;s new manager. The Italian manager led the club the winner of the J.League Cup in 2021. However, Grampus didn&#x27;t renew a contract with Ficcadenti, and appointed Kenta Hasegawa as their new manager.

===Kashima Soccer Stadium curse===
Since Grampus were dealt a 5–0 defeat by the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium on 16 May in the 1993 J.League season opener, Grampus suffered a losing streak of 22 consecutive games to the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium which included Emperor&#x27;s Cup and J.League Cup games. Grampus finally got their first victory over the Kashima Antlers at the Kashima Soccer Stadium on 23 August of the 2008 J.League season, some 15 years later.

== Affiliated clubs ==

* AS Roma (2022−&quot;present&quot;)

On 25 November 2022, Nagoya Grampus sign partnership with Serie A club, AS Roma.

==In popular culture==
In the &quot;Captain Tsubasa&quot; manga series, one character was player of Nagoya Grampus and is the goalkeeper Ken Wakashimazu which was player of Yokohama Flügels before the closing of the Yokohama team. In 2013, the midfielder Shingo Aoi wear the Nagoya Grampus jersey in a Yoichi Takahashi tribute to the 20 years of J.League.

<text>The S-Bahn ( , ), , is a hybrid urban–suburban rail system serving a metropolitan region predominantly in German-speaking countries. Some of the larger S-Bahn systems provide service similar to rapid transit systems, while smaller ones often resemble commuter or even regional rail systems. The name &quot;S-Bahn&quot; derives from (), (, not to be confused with the present-day &quot;Stadtbahn&quot;) or ().

Similar systems in Austria and German-speaking Switzerland are known as S-Bahn as well. In Belgium, it is known as S-Trein (Flemish) or Train S (French). In Denmark, they are known as S-tog , and in the Czech Republic as Esko or S-lines. In Milan, they are known as [[S-Bahn|Linee S]].

S-Bahn is also a treated as a train category in several European countries.

== Characteristics ==
There is no complete definition of an S-Bahn system. S-Bahn are, where they exist, the most local type of passenger train service that stops at all existing stations on mainline networks inside and around a city (while other mainline trains only call at major stations).

They are slower than regional mainline trains, but usually serve as fast crosstown services within the city. The Copenhagen S-tog for example goes up to , faster than most urban heavy rail and mass transit. S-Bahn trains generally serve the hinterland of a certain city, rather than connecting different cities, although in high population density areas a few exceptions to this exist. A good example of such an exception is the Rhine-Ruhr S-Bahn, which interconnects the cities, towns and suburbs of the Ruhr, a large urban agglomeration.

Many larger S-Bahn systems have at their core a corridor of exclusive trackage that individual suburban branches feed into, creating a high frequency trunk corridor. In many cases, this central corridor is a dedicated grade-separated line in the city centre with close stop spacing and a high frequency, similar to metro systems. A good example of this is Berliner Stadtbahn in Berlin&#x27;s S-Bahn, which is regarded as a tourist attraction.

Outside of the city center, most S-Bahn systems are entirely built on older local railways, or in some cases parallel to an existing dual track railway. Most use existing local mainline railway trackage, but a few branches and lines can be purpose-built S-Bahn lines. S-Bahn trains typically use overhead lines or a third rail for traction power. In Hamburg both methods are used, depending on which line is powered. In smaller S-Bahn systems and suburban sections of larger ones, trains typically share tracks with other rail traffic, with the Berlin S-Bahn, Hamburg S-Bahn and Copenhagen S-train being notable exceptions.

Further out from the central parts of a city the individual services branch off into lines where the distances between stations can exceed 5 km, similar to commuter rail. This allows the S-Bahn to serve a dual transport purpose: local transport within a city centre and suburban transport between suburbs and central boroughs of larger cities. Frequencies vary wildly between systems, with headways ranging from 2 minutes in the core sections of large networks to 30 or even 60 minutes in remote sections of the network, at off-peak times and in smaller systems.

The rolling stock typically used for S-Bahn systems reflects its hybrid purpose. The interior is designed for short journeys with provision for standing passengers, but may have more space allocated to comfortable seating than metro trains.

Integration with other local transport for ticketing, connectivity and easy interchange between lines or other systems like metros is typical for the S-Bahn. Where both S-Bahn and metro exist, the number of interchange stations between the two systems is substantial, with metro tickets being valid on S-Bahn services and vice versa. The S-Bahn Mitteldeutschland constitutes the main local railway system for Leipzig but also connects to Halle, where a few stations are located. The Rostock S-Bahn is an example of a smaller S-Bahn system.

== Etymology ==
=== Germany, Austria and Switzerland ===
The name &quot;S-Bahn&quot; is an abbreviation of the German &quot;Stadtschnellbahn&quot; (&quot;city rapid railway&quot;) and was introduced in December 1930 in Berlin. The name was introduced at the time of the reconstruction of the suburban commuter train tracks— the first section to be electrified was a section of the Berlin–Stettin railway from Berlin Nordbahnhof to Bernau bei Berlin station in 1924, leading to the formation of the Berlin S-Bahn.

The main line Berliner Stadtbahn (&quot;Berlin city railway&quot;) was electrified with a 750 volt third rail in 1928 (some steam trains ran until 1929) and the circle line Berliner Ringbahn was electrified in 1929. The electrification continued on the radial suburban railway tracks along with the timetable moving to a rapid transit model with no more than a 20-minute headway per line where a number of lines overlapped on the main line. The system peaked during the 1936 Summer Olympics in Berlin with trains scheduled at least every 2 minutes.

The idea of heavy rail rapid transit was not unique to Berlin. Hamburg had an electric railway between the central station (&quot;Hauptbahnhof&quot;) and Altona which opened in 1906, and in 1934 the system adopted the &quot;S-Bahn&quot; label from Berlin. In the same year in Denmark, Copenhagen&#x27;s S-tog opened its first line. In Austria, Vienna had its &quot;Stadtbahn&quot; main line electrified in 1908 and also introduced the term &quot;Schnellbahn&quot; (&quot;rapid railway&quot;) in 1954 for its planned commuter railway network, which started operations in 1962. The &quot;S-Bahn&quot; label was sometimes used as well, but the name was only switched to S-Bahn Wien in 2005.

As for Munich, in 1938 the Nazi government broke ground for an S-Bahn-like rapid transport system in Lindwurmstraße near what is now Goetheplatz station on line U6. The system was supposed to run through tunnels in the city centre. The planning process mainly consisted of the bundling and interconnecting of existing suburban and local railways, plus the construction of a few new lines. Plans and construction work - including the building shell of Goetheplatz station - came to a very early halt during World War II and were not pursued in its aftermath. Very extensive nowadays, Munich&#x27;s existing S-Bahn system, together with the first two U-Bahn lines, only began to operate prior to the 1972 Summer Olympics.

The term &quot;S-Bahn&quot; was a registered wordmark of Deutsche Bahn until 14 March 2012, when, at the request of a transportation association, the Federal Patent Court of Germany ordered its removal from the records of the German Patent and Trade Mark Office. Prior to this Deutsche Bahn collected a royalty of 0.4 cents per train kilometer for the use of the term.

=== Denmark ===

The &quot;S&quot; stood for &quot;station&quot;. Just before the opening of the first line in the Copenhagen S-train network, the newspaper &quot;Politiken&quot; on 17 February 1934 held a competition about the name, which in Danish became known as &quot;Den elektriske enquete&quot; or &quot;The electrical survey&quot; (as the Copenhagen S-trains would become the first electrical railways in Denmark). But since an &quot;S&quot; already was put up at all the stations, weeks before the survey, the result became &quot;S-tog&quot; which means &quot;S-train&quot;. This was also just a few years after the S-trains had opened in Berlin and Hamburg. Today the Copenhagen S-trains uses six lines and serves 86 stations, 32 of them are located inside the (quite tiny) municipality borders. Each line uses 6 t.p.h (trains per hour) in each direction, with exception of the (yellow) F-line. The F-line has departures in each direction every five minutes, or 12 t.p.h. service .

== History ==
The history of the &quot;S-Bahn&quot; in present-day Germany begins in the 19th century in Prussia.

=== Early steam services ===
In 1882, the growing number of steam-powered trains around Berlin prompted the Prussian State Railway to construct separate rail tracks for suburban traffic. The &quot;Berliner Stadtbahn&quot; connected Berlin&#x27;s eight intercity rail stations which were spread throughout the city (all but the &quot;Stettiner Bahnhof&quot; which today is a pure S-Bahn station known as Berlin Nordbahnhof; as the city &quot;Stettin&quot; today is Polish city Szczecin). A lower rate for the newly founded &quot;Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn&quot; (Berlin City, Circular and Suburban Rail) was introduced on 1 October 1891. This rate and the growing succession of trains made the short-distance service stand out from other railways.

The second suburban railway was the &quot;Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn&quot; connecting Hamburg with Altona and Blankenese. The Altona office of the Prussian State Railway established the electric powered railway in 1906.

=== Electricity ===

The beginning of the 20th century saw the first electric trains, which in Germany operated at 15,000 V on overhead lines. The &quot;Berliner Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn&quot; instead implemented direct current multiple units running on 750 V from a third rail. In 1924, the first electrified route went into service. The third rail was chosen because it made both the modifications of the rail tracks (especially in tunnels and under bridges) and the side-by-side use of electric and steam trains easier.

To set it apart from the subterranean &quot;U-Bahn&quot;, the term &quot;S-Bahn&quot; replaced &quot;Stadt-, Ring- und Vorortbahn&quot; in 1930.

The Hamburg service had established an alternating current line in 1907 with the use of multiple units with slam doors. In 1940 a new system with 1200 V DC third rail and modern electric multiple units with sliding doors was integrated on this line (on the same tracks). The old system with overhead wire remained up to 1955. The other lines of the network still used steam and later Diesel power. 
In 1934, the &quot;Hamburg-Altonaer Stadt- und Vorortbahn&quot; was renamed as S-Bahn.
== Systems by country ==




=== Austria ===
The oldest and largest S-Bahn system in Austria is the Vienna S-Bahn, which predominantly uses non exclusive rails tracks outside of Vienna. It was established in 1962, although it was usually referred to as &quot;Schnellbahn&quot; until 2005. The white &quot;S&quot; on a blue circle used as the logo is said to reflect the layout of the central railway line in Vienna. However, it has now been changed for a more stylized version that is used all through Austria, except Salzburg. The rolling stock was blue for a long time, reflecting the logo colour, but red is used uniformly for nearly all local traffic today.
In 2004, the Salzburg S-Bahn went into service as the first Euroregion S-Bahn, crossing the border to the neighbouring towns of Freilassing and Berchtesgaden in Bavaria. The network is served by three corporations: the &quot;Berchtesgadener Land Bahn&quot; (BLB)(S4), the Austrian Federal Railways (German: &quot;Österreichischen Bundesbahn&quot; / ÖBB)(S2 and S3) and the &quot;Salzburger Lokalbahn&quot; (SLB)(S1 and S11) and . The Salzburg S-Bahn logo is only different one, it is a white S on a light blue circle.

In 2006 the regional train line in the Rhine Valley in the state of Vorarlberg has been renamed to Vorarlberg S-Bahn. It is a three lines network, operated by the &quot;Montafonerbahn&quot; and the ÖBB. It was later expanded. Presently, a frequent service, the S1, operates between to (D) via . In addition, an hourly service, S3 (ÖBB), connects Bregenz with St. Margrethen (CH), and another service (S2) operates between Feldkirch (A), Schaan (FL) and Buchs SG (CH). The &quot;Montafonerbahn&quot; runs the S4.

The &quot;S-Bahn Steiermark&quot; has been inaugurated in December 2007 in Styria, built to connect its capital city Graz with the rest of the metropolitan area, currently the following lines are active: S1, S11, S3, S31, S5, S51, S6, S61, S7, S8 and S9. The network is operated by three railway companies: the &quot;Graz-Köflacher Bahn&quot; (GKB) (lines: S6, S61 and S7), the ÖBB (lines: S1, S3, S5, S51, S8 and S9) and the &quot;Steiermärkische Landesbahnen&quot; (StB) (lines: S11 and S31).

In December 2007 as well the Tyrol S-Bahn opened, running from Hall in Tirol in the east to Innsbruck Central Station and Telfs in the west and from Innsbruck to Steinach am Brenner. Class 4024 EMUs are used as rolling stock on this network.

In 2010 the &quot;S-Bahn Kärnten&quot; was opened in the state of Carinthia and currently consists of 4 lines operated by ÖBB.

The youngest network is the &quot;S-Bahn Oberösterreich&quot; in the Greater Linz area of the state of Upper Austria, which was inaugurated in December 2016. It is a 5 line system operated by &quot;Stern und Hafferl&quot; and the ÖBB.

=== Belgium ===

Since 2015, the trains of the Brussels Regional Express Network (French: &quot;Réseau Express Régional Bruxellois&quot;, &quot;RER&quot;; Dutch: &quot;Gewestelijk Expresnet&quot;, GEN) of the NMBS/SNCB belong to train category &quot;S&quot; and are referred to as &quot;S train&quot; (Dutch: &#x27;S-trein&#x27;, French: &quot;train S&quot;, German: &#x27;S-Züge&#x27;). In 2018, local trains of NMBS/SNCB in and around Antwerp, Ghent, Liège and Charleroi changed to the train category &quot;S train&quot; as well.

=== Czech Republic ===
In the Czech Republic, integrated commuter rail systems exist in Prague and Moravian-Silesian Region. Both systems are called &quot;Esko&quot;, which is how &quot;S&quot; letter is usually called in Czech. Esko Prague has been operating since 9 December 2007 as a part of the Prague Integrated Transport system. Esko Moravian-Silesian Region began operating on 14 December 2008 as a part of the ODIS Integrated Transport system serving the Moravian-Silesian Region. Both systems are primarily operated by České dráhy. Several shorter lines are operated by other companies.

=== Denmark ===
Copenhagen S-train connects the city centre, other inner and outer boroughs and suburbs with each other. The average distance between stations is 2.0 km, shorter in the city core and inner boroughs, longer at the end of lines that serve suburbs. Of the 86 stations, 32 are located within the central parts of the city. Some stations are located around 40 km from Copenhagen city centre. For this reason the fares vary depending on distances. The one-day passes which the tourists buy are valid only in the most central parts of the S-train system. On weekdays each line has a departure every 10 minutes with the exception of the F-line, on which a train departs every five minutes. Where several lines converge on a common piece of track there could be as many as 30 trains per hour in each direction. On Sundays the seven lines are reduced to four lines, but all stations are served at least every 10 minutes. The three railway stations at Amager have a local service that is the equivalent of the S-trains.

The Copenhagen Metro opened in 2002 as a complement to the already existing S-train system. Copenhagen&#x27;s S-train system is the only one in the country. Outside Denmark, in cities where both exist, is it far from unusual that a metro system later has been complemented with S-trains. The branch towards Køge (the southernmost S-train station in Copenhagen&#x27;s S-network) has a rather unique history, as it was built in the 1970s where no previous railway ever had existed.

=== France ===
Although not called a &quot;Train S&quot; in French, the Paris RER has the characteristic structure of an S-Bahn system, with branches going to distant suburbs and sharing a common corridor in the city center. It is also called &quot;S-Bahn&quot; in some German-language signs.

=== Germany ===
The trains of the Berlin and Hamburg S-Bahn systems ran on separate tracks from the beginning. When other cities started implementing their systems in the 1960s, they mostly had to use the existing intercity rail tracks, and they still more or less use such tracks.

The central intercity stations of Frankfurt, Leipzig, Munich and Stuttgart are terminal stations, so all four cities have monocentric S-Bahn networks. The S-Bahn trains use as their core segment a tunnel under the central station and the city centre (e.g. Munich S-Bahn Stammstrecke and the upcoming &quot;Zweite Stammstrecke&quot;).

The high number of large cities in the Ruhr area promotes a polycentric network connecting all cities and suburbs. The &quot;S-Bahn Rhein-Ruhr&quot;, as it is called, features few tunnels, and its routes are longer than those of other networks. The Ruhr S-Bahn is the only S-Bahn network to be run by more than one corporation in Germany, and the Salzburg S-Bahn holds a similar distinction in Austria. Most Swiss S-Bahn systems are multi-corporation networks, however.

Most German S-Bahn networks have a unique ticket system, separated from the &quot;Deutsche Bahn&quot; rates, instead connected to the city ticket system used for U-bahns and local buses. The S-Bahn of Hanover, however, operates under five different rates due to its large expanse.

One S-Bahn system is no longer in operation: the Erfurt S-Bahn which operated from 1976 until 1995 and was an single-line diesel-powered system which consisted of four stations from Erfurt Central Station to Erfurt Berliner Straße station in the then newly built northern suburbs of Erfurt.

There are several S-Bahn or S-Bahn-like systems in planning, such as the Augsburg S-Bahn (network plan), the Lübeck S-Bahn (network plan) and the tri-country Bodensee S-Bahn.

The Stadtbahn Karlsruhe (a tram-train network) uses the green &quot;S&quot; logo for stations in the outskirts and has its lines indicated by an &quot;S&quot; in front of the line number, but does not refer to itself as &quot;S-Bahn&quot;. The logo also can&#x27;t be found on the trains, contrary to most other systems where it&#x27;s placed somewhere on the sides or at the front of the trains. A new city-centre tunnel opened at the end of 2021, however the blue &quot;U-Bahn&quot; logo is not used either for it. To mark those tunnel stations, a yellow U is used, which is unique and can only be found there.

Despite their names, the &quot;Ortenau S-Bahn&quot; (Offenburg) and the &quot;Danube-Iller Regional S-Bahn&quot; (Ulm/Neu-Ulm, opened 2020) are Regionalbahn services.

The following networks are currently in operation:

=== Liechtenstein ===

The only railway line passing through the Principality of Liechtenstein is the Feldkirch–Buchs railway line, which connects with the Austrian rail network in and with the Swiss network in . In June 2008, the Swiss canton of St. Gallen, the Austrian state of Vorarlberg, and the Principality of Liechtenstein signed an agreement for a project to upgrade this line (and the surrounding ones) and to increase the rail traffic. The project, named was approved by Liechtenstein and Austria in a Letter of Intent signed in April 2020 and under that plan, it was to be fully realised by 2027 and would have cost an estimated €187 million. That plan was however rejected by 62.3% of Liechtenstein voters in a referendum on 30 August 2020.

As of the December 2023 timetable change, an S-Bahn service, the S2 of Vorarlberg S-Bahn, operates between Feldkirch (A), Schaan (FL) and Buchs SG (CH). There are three operational railway stations in Liechtenstein along the Feldkirch–Buchs line: (which serves the capital Vaduz), and . A fourth station, , was closed in 2013.

=== Switzerland ===
&quot;S-Bahn&quot; is also used in the German-speaking part of Switzerland. Swiss French networks use the term &quot;RER&quot; with line numbers prefixed with an R, e.g. as R2, except for the Léman Express in Greater Geneva that uses the prefix L followed by the line number (&quot;L&quot; for &quot;Léman-Express&quot;), e.g. L2. S-Bahn-style services in the Italian and Romansh speaking parts of Switzerland also use, like the Milan suburban system, the &quot;S&quot; prefix, although in Italian such networks are called &quot;rete celere&quot; () instead of S-Bahn.


The oldest network in Switzerland is the Bern S-Bahn, which was established in stages from 1974 onward and has adopted the term S-Bahn since 1995. It is also the only one in Switzerland to use a coloured &quot;S&quot; logo. In 1990, the Zürich S-Bahn, went into service. As of 2022, this network comprises 32 services, covering a large area in Switzerland (and parts of southern Germany). Further S-Bahn services were set up in the course of the &quot;Bahn 2000&quot; initiative in Central Switzerland (a collaborative network of &quot;S-Bahn Luzern&quot; and &quot;Stadtbahn Zug&quot;), and Eastern Switzerland (&quot;S-Bahn St. Gallen&quot;).

The &quot;Basel trinational S-Bahn&quot; services the Basel metropolitan area, thus providing cross-border transportation into both France and Germany. A tunnel connecting Basel&#x27;s two large intercity stations (Basel Badischer Bahnhof and Basel SBB) is planned as &quot;Herzstück Regio-S-Bahn Basel&quot; (lit. heart-piece Regio-S-Bahn Basel).

An international S-Bahn network also existsts across the Swiss-Italian border, in the Swiss Canton of Ticino and the Italian state of Lombardy. Services are operated by Treni Regionali Ticino Lombardia (TILO), a joint venture between Italian railway company Trenord and Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS).

The &quot;RER Vaud&quot; of Lausanne and the &quot;Léman Express&quot; of Geneva serve the area around Lake Geneva (&quot;fr. Lac Léman&quot;). The &quot;Léman express&quot; network expands across the Swiss-French border. It is the largest cross-country S-Bahn network of Europe. &quot;Léman express&quot; was launched in December 2019 and is operated by Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) and SNCF.

Another transborder network for the Lake Constance (&quot;Bodensee&quot;) area, connecting up to four nations, is under discussion. This network would extend across the German states Baden-Württemberg and Bavaria, the Austrian state Vorarlberg, the Principality of Liechtenstein (&quot;S-Bahn FL.A.CH&quot;), and the Swiss cantons of Appenzell Ausserrhoden, Appenzell Innerrhoden, Schaffhausen, St. Gallen and Thurgau. Possible names are &quot;Bodensee-S-Bahn&quot; and &quot;Alpenrhein-Bahn&quot;. Presently, the Bodensee S-Bahn only operates services around Lake Constance in Austria, Germany and Switzerland (without Liechtenstein). It includes, among others, the S14 and S44 services of St. Gallen S-Bahn, which both connect Konstanz (D) with Kreuzlingen and Weinfelden (CH). Since 2022, some S7 services continue from Rorschach (CH) to Bregenz (A) and Lindau-Reutin (D). Additional transborder services are planned.

The Chur S-Bahn provides services around Chur, the capital of the alpine Canton of Graubünden (Grisons) in south-eastern Switzerland.

The Aargau S-Bahn is a small network that services stations in the cantons of Aargau, Lucerne and Bern.

The &quot;RER Fribourg&quot; is an S-Bahn-style service centered at Fribourg/Freiburg and Bulle in the Canton of Fribourg, and extending into the cantons of Neuchâtel and Vaud.

Two unnumbered S-Bahn services (designated only with an &quot;S&quot;), one between Schaffhausen and Erzingen (D), running on railway tracks owned by Deutsche Bahn (DB), and one between Schaffhausen and Jestetten (D), opened in 2013. They are operated by SBB GmbH and THURBO, respectively. Since December 2022, the Schaffhausen–Singen am Hohentwiel line is also serviced by SBB GmbH As of the December 2023 timetable change, the three services of Schaffhausen S-Bahn are numbered S62, S64 and S65.

Additionally, there are services designated &quot;S&quot; that are not part of any formal S-Bahn network. These include the S20, S21, and S22 operated by Swiss Federal Railways in Solothurn or the S27 operated by Südostbahn (SOB) between Siebnen-Wangen and Ziegelbrücke.

Swiss S-Bahn services are operated mostly by the Swiss Federal Railways (SBB CFF FFS) but also by private railway companies, such as &quot;Appenzeller Bahnen&quot; (AB), BLS AG, &quot;Forchbahn&quot; (FB), &quot;Regionalverkehr Bern-Solothurn&quot; (RBS), &quot;Rhätische Bahn&quot; (RhB), &quot;Sihltal Zürich Uetliberg Bahn&quot; (SZU), &quot;Südostbahn&quot; (SOB) or &quot;Zentralbahn&quot; (ZB).

Rail transport in Switzerland, including S-Bahn systems, is noteworthy for its coordination between services due to the clock-face schedule. Due to the proximity of the various S-Bahn systems in Switzerland, services of one network often offer connections to services of neighboring networks. S-Bahn services are used by commuters and tourists (some services call nearby tourist attractions, such as the Rhine Falls or the Swiss Museum of Transport).

<text>The UEFA European Football Championship, less formally the European Championship and informally the Euro or Euros, is the primary association football tournament organised by the Union of European Football Associations (UEFA). The competition is contested by UEFA members&#x27; senior men&#x27;s national teams, determining the continental champion of Europe. It is the second-most watched football tournament in the world after the FIFA World Cup; the Euro 2016 final was watched by a global audience of around 600 million. The competition has been held every four years since 1960, except for 2020, when it was postponed until 2021 due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, but kept the name Euro 2020. Scheduled to be in the even-numbered year between FIFA World Cup tournaments, it was originally called the European Nations&#x27; Cup before changing to its current name in 1968. Since 1996, the individual events have been branded as &quot;UEFA Euro [year]&quot;.

Before entering the tournament, all teams other than the host nations (which qualify automatically) compete in a qualifying process. Until 2016, the championship winners could compete in the following year&#x27;s FIFA Confederations Cup, but were not obliged to do so. From the 2020 edition onwards, the winner competes in the CONMEBOL–UEFA Cup of Champions.

The seventeen European Championship tournaments have been won by ten national teams: Spain have won four titles, Germany have won three titles, Italy and France have won two titles, and the Soviet Union, Czechoslovakia, the Netherlands, Denmark, Greece and Portugal have won one title each. To date, Spain is the only team to have won consecutive titles, doing so in 2008 and 2012.

The most recent championship, held in Germany in 2024, was won by Spain, who lifted a record fourth European title after beating England 2–1 in the final at the Olympiastadion in Berlin.

==History==
===Beginnings===
Regional tournaments for national teams existed before the advent of a truly pan-European competition. Starting in 1883, the British Home Championship was an annual competition contested between the United Kingdom&#x27;s four national teams, England, Scotland, Wales, and Ireland. Until these national teams entered the FIFA World Cup in 1950, it was the most important international tournament these nations competed in. Similarly, from 1927 until 1960, the Central European International Cup was held six times. It brought together the national teams of Austria, Hungary, Italy, Czechoslovakia, Switzerland, and Yugoslavia. The idea for a pan-European football tournament was first proposed by the French Football Federation&#x27;s secretary-general Henri Delaunay in 1927, but it was not until 1958 that the tournament was started, three years after Delaunay&#x27;s death. In honour of Delaunay, the trophy awarded to the champions is named after him. The 1960 tournament, held in France, had four teams competing in the finals out of 17 that entered the competition. It was won by the Soviet Union, beating Yugoslavia 2–1 in a tense final in Paris. Spain withdrew from its quarter-final match against the Soviet Union because of two political protests. Of the 17 teams that entered the qualifying tournament, notable absentees were England, the Netherlands, West Germany and Italy.

Spain held the next tournament in 1964, which saw an increase in entries to the qualification tournament, with 29 entering; West Germany was a notable absentee once again and Greece withdrew after being drawn against Albania, with whom they were still at war. The hosts beat the title holders, the Soviet Union, 2–1 at the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium in Madrid.

The tournament format stayed the same for the 1968 tournament, hosted and won by Italy. For the first and only time, a match was decided on a coin toss (the semi-final between Italy and the Soviet Union) and the final went to a replay, after the match against Yugoslavia finished 1–1. Italy won the replay 2–0. More teams entered this tournament (31), a testament to its burgeoning popularity.

Belgium hosted the 1972 tournament, which West Germany won, beating the Soviet Union 3–0 in the final, with goals coming from Gerd Müller (twice) and Herbert Wimmer at the Heysel Stadium in Brussels. This tournament would provide a taste of things to come, as the German side contained many of the key members of the 1974 FIFA World Cup-winning team.

The 1976 tournament in Yugoslavia was the last in which only four teams took part in the final tournament, and the last in which the hosts had to qualify. Czechoslovakia beat West Germany in the newly introduced penalty shootout. After seven successful conversions, Uli Hoeneß missed, leaving Czechoslovakian Antonín Panenka with the opportunity to score and win the tournament. An &quot;audacious&quot; chipped shot, described by UEFA as &quot;perhaps the most famous spot kick of all time&quot; secured the victory as Czechoslovakia won 5–3 on penalties.

===Expansion to 8 teams===
The competition was expanded to eight teams in the 1980 tournament, again hosted by Italy. It involved a group stage, with the winners of the groups going on to contest the final, and the runners-up playing in the third place play-off. West Germany won their second European title by beating Belgium 2–1, with two goals scored by Horst Hrubesch at the Stadio Olimpico in Rome. Horst Hrubesch scored early in the first half before René Vandereycken equalised for Belgium with a penalty in the second half. With two minutes remaining, Hrubesch headed the winner for West Germany from a Karl-Heinz Rummenigge corner.

France won their first major title at home in the 1984 tournament, with their captain Michel Platini scoring 9 goals in just 5 games, including the opening goal in the final, in which they beat Spain 2–0. The format also changed, with the top two teams in each group going through to a semi-final stage, instead of the winners of each group going straight into the final. The third place play-off was also abolished. The losing teams from the semi-finals win the bronze medal. 
West Germany hosted UEFA Euro 1988, but lost 2–1 to the Netherlands, their traditional rivals, in the semi-finals, which sparked vigorous celebrations in the Netherlands. The Netherlands went on to win the tournament in a rematch of their first game of the group stage, beating the Soviet Union 2–0 at the Olympiastadion in Munich. Marco van Basten scored the second goal, a volley over the keeper from the right wing which is often considered one of the best goals ever scored.

UEFA Euro 1992 was held in Sweden, and was won by Denmark, who had been invited to the finals after UN sanctions prevented Yugoslavia&#x27;s participation as some of the states constituting the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia were at war with each other. The Danes beat holders the Netherlands on penalties in the semi-finals, then defeated world champions Germany 2–0. This was the first tournament in which a unified Germany took part and also the first major tournament to have the players&#x27; names printed on their backs.

===Expansion to 16 teams===
England hosted UEFA Euro 1996, the first tournament to use the nomenclature &quot;Euro [year]&quot; and would see the number of teams taking part double to 16. The hosts, in a replay of the 1990 FIFA World Cup semi-final, were knocked out on penalties by Germany. The surprise team of the tournament was the newly formed Czech Republic, participating on its first international competition following the dissolution of Czechoslovakia, which reached the final after beating Portugal and France in the knockout stage. Germany would go on to win the final 2–1 thanks to the first golden goal ever in a major tournament, scored by Oliver Bierhoff five minutes into extra time. This was Germany&#x27;s first title as a unified nation.

UEFA Euro 2000 was the first tournament to be held by two countries, in the Netherlands and Belgium. France, the reigning World Cup champions, were favoured to win, and they lived up to expectations when they beat Italy 2–1 after extra time, having come from being 1–0 down: Sylvain Wiltord equalised in the last minute of regular time and David Trezeguet scored the winning golden goal in extra time.
UEFA Euro 2004, like 1992, produced an upset: Greece, who had only qualified for one World Cup (1994) and one European Championship (1980) before, beat hosts Portugal 1–0 in the final (after having also beaten them in the opening game) with a goal scored by Angelos Charisteas in the 57th minute to win a tournament for which they were considered among the biggest underdogs. On their way to the Final, they also beat holders France as well as the Czech Republic with a silver goal, a rule which replaced the previous golden goal in 2003, before being abolished itself shortly after this tournament.

The 2008 tournament, hosted by Austria and Switzerland, marked the second time that two nations co-hosted and the first edition where the new trophy was awarded. It commenced on 7 June and finished on 29 June. The final between Germany and Spain was held at the Ernst Happel Stadion in Vienna. Spain defeated Germany 1–0, with a goal scored by Fernando Torres in the 33rd minute, sparking much celebration across the country. This was their first title since the 1964 tournament. Spain were the highest scoring team with 12 goals scored and David Villa finished as the top scorer with four goals. Xavi was awarded the player of the tournament, and nine Spanish players were picked for the team of the tournament.

The UEFA Euro 2012 tournament was co-hosted by Poland and Ukraine. Spain defeated Italy 4–0 in the Final, thus becoming the first nation to defend a European Championship title, as well as the first European team to win three consecutive major tournaments. In scoring the third goal of the final, Torres became the first player to score in two European Championship finals. He was equal top scorer for the tournament with three goals in total, along with Mario Balotelli, Alan Dzagoev, Mario Gómez, Mario Mandžukić, and Cristiano Ronaldo, despite only being used as a substitute player. The tournament was otherwise notable for having the most headed goals in a Euro tournament (26 out of 76 goals in total); a disallowed goal in the England versus Ukraine group game which replays showed had crossed the goal line, and which prompted President of FIFA Sepp Blatter to tweet, &quot;GLT (Goal-line technology) is no longer an alternative but a necessity&quot;, thus reversing his long-held reluctance to embrace such technology; and some crowd violence in group games.

===Expansion to 24 teams===
In 2007, the Football Association of Ireland and Scottish Football Association proposed the expansion of the tournament, which was later confirmed by the UEFA Executive Committee in September 2008. Out of the 54 member associations of UEFA, only three, including England and Germany, opposed the expansion. On 28 May 2010, UEFA announced that UEFA Euro 2016 would be hosted by France. France beat bids of Turkey (7–6 in voting in the second voting round) and Italy, which had the fewest votes in the first voting round. Euro 2016 was the first to have 24 teams in the finals. This was the third time France have hosted the competition. Portugal, which qualified for the knock-out phase despite finishing third in its group, went on to win the championship by defeating heavily favoured host team France 1–0 in the Final, thanks to a goal from Eder in the 109th minute. Cristiano Ronaldo, Portugal&#x27;s world-renowned striker, came out of the game due to injury in the 25th minute. This was the first time Portugal won a major tournament.

For the 2020 tournament, three bids were proposed, including a bid from Turkey, a joint bid from the Republic of Ireland, Scotland and Wales, and a joint bid from Georgia and Azerbaijan. In December 2012, however, UEFA announced that the 2020 tournament would be hosted in several cities in various countries across Europe, with the semi-finals and final being played in London. The venues were selected and announced by UEFA on 19 September 2014. However, Brussels was removed as a host city on 7 December 2017 due to delays with the building of the Eurostadium. On 17 March 2020, UEFA announced that Euro 2020 would be delayed by a year due to the COVID-19 pandemic in Europe, and proposed it take place from 11 June to 11 July 2021. The competition was postponed in order to reduce pressure on the public services in affected countries and to provide space in the calendar for the completion of domestic leagues that had been suspended. Before the Euro 2020, Dublin was also removed as one of the host cities due to its inability to guarantee spectators to the stadium, while Bilbao was replaced by Seville for the same reason. In the Final, Italy defeated maiden finalists England 3–2 on penalties, after the game was tied 1–1 after extra time, to win their second European Championship.

==Trophy==

The Henri Delaunay Trophy, which is awarded to the winner of the European Championship, is named in honour of Henri Delaunay, the first General Secretary of UEFA, who came up with the idea of a European championship but died five years before the first tournament in 1960. His son Pierre was in charge of creating the trophy. Since the first tournament it has been awarded to the winning team for them to keep for four years, until the next tournament. This trophy bore the words &quot;Coupe d&#x27;Europe&quot; (&quot;European Cup&quot;), &quot;Coupe Henri Delaunay&quot; (&quot;Henri Delaunay Cup&quot;), and &quot;Championnat d&#x27;Europe&quot; (&quot;European Championship&quot;) on the front and a juggling boy on the back.

For the 2008 tournament, the Henri Delaunay Trophy was remodelled to make it larger, as the old trophy was overshadowed by UEFA&#x27;s other trophies such as the new European Champion Clubs&#x27; Cup. The new trophy, which is made of sterling silver, now weighs and is tall, being heavier and longer than the old one. The marble plinth that was serving as base was removed. The new silver base of the trophy had to be enlarged to make it stable. The names of the winning countries that had appeared on the plaques glued to the plinth are now engraved on the back of the trophy, under the word &quot;Coupe Henri Delaunay&quot; and are written in English rather than French its predecessor had. Since 2016, the juggling boy was returned on the trophy&#x27;s back.

The players and coaches of the winning team and the runner-up team are awarded gold and silver medals, respectively. Each association that competes in the final tournament receives a commemorative plaque. Each time the team losing semi-finalist, as well as each finalist, receive a dedicated plaque. Though there is no longer a third place play-off, UEFA decided in the 2008 edition to award the semi-final losers (Turkey and Russia) bronze medals for the first time, and did the same in the 2012 edition when Germany and Portugal received bronze medals. However, UEFA decided that losing semi-finalists would no longer receive medals from the 2016 edition onwards. Bronze medals were previously awarded for winners of the third place play-off, the last of which was held in 1980.

==Format==
===The competition===
Before 1980, only four teams qualified for the final tournament. From 1980, eight teams competed. In 1996 the tournament expanded to 16 teams, since it was easier for European nations to qualify for the World Cup than their own continental championship; 14 of the 24 teams at the 1982, 1986 and 1990 World Cups had been European, whereas the European Championship finals still involved only eight teams.

In 2007, there was much discussion about an expansion of the tournament to 24 teams, started by Scotland and the Republic of Ireland, due to the increased number of football associations in Europe after the break-ups of Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and the inclusion of Israel and Kazakhstan. The new president of UEFA, Michel Platini, was reported to be in favour of expansion which proved an accurate assumption. Whilst on 17 April 2007, UEFA&#x27;s executive committee formally decided against expansion in 2012, Platini indicated in June 2008 that UEFA will increase participation from 16 to 24 teams in future tournaments, starting from 2016. On 25 September, it was announced by Franz Beckenbauer that an agreement had been reached, and the expansion to 24 teams would be officially announced the next day.

The competing teams are chosen by a series of qualifying games: in 1960 and 1964 through home and away play-offs; from 1968 through a combination of both qualifying groups and play-off games. The host country was selected from the four finalists after they were determined through qualifying.

Since the expansion of the final tournament starting from 1980, the host country, or countries, have been chosen beforehand and qualify automatically.

In most tournaments, the tournament consists of a round-robin group stage followed by a single-elimination knockout stage.

Up to 1968 draws were to be broken via a coin toss in all matches but the final, draw in final match was resolved via a replay.

No third place play-off has been played since 1980.

===Qualifying===

To qualify, a team must finish in one of the direct qualifying spots or win a play-off. After this, a team proceeds to the finals round in the host country, although hosts qualify for the tournament automatically.

The groups for qualification are drawn by a UEFA committee using seeding. Seeded teams include reigning champions and other teams based on their performance in the preceding FIFA World Cup qualifying and the last European Championship qualifying. To obtain an accurate view of the teams&#x27; abilities, a ranking is produced. This is calculated by taking the total number of points won by a particular team and dividing it by the number of games played, i.e. points per game. In the case of a team having hosted one of the two previous competitions and therefore having qualified automatically, only the results from the single most recent qualifying competition are used. If two teams have equal points per game, the committee then bases their positions in the rankings on:

# Coefficient from the matches played in its most recent qualifying competition.
# Average goal difference.
# Average number of goals scored.
# Average number of away goals scored.
# Drawing of lots.

The qualifying phase is played in a group format, the composition of the groups is determined through means of a draw of teams from pre-defined seeded bowls. The draw takes place after the preceding World Cup&#x27;s qualifying competition. For UEFA Euro 2020, the group qualifying phase consisted of ten groups; five of six teams and the remainder of five teams each.

Each group is played in a league format with teams playing each other home and away. The top two teams then qualified for the final tournament, with remaining places decided by playoffs depending on their ranking in the UEFA Nations League. As with most leagues, the points are awarded as three for a win, one for a draw, and none for a loss. In the eventuality of one or more teams having equal points after all matches have been played, the following criteria are used to distinguish the sides:

# Higher number of points obtained in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Superior goal difference from the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Higher number of goals scored away from home in the group matches played among the teams in question.
# Results of all group matches:
## Superior goal difference
## Higher number of goals scored
## Higher number of goals scored away from home
## Fair play conduct.
# Drawing of lots.

===Final tournament===

Sixteen teams progressed to the final tournament for the 2012 tournament. They were joint hosts Poland and Ukraine, the winners and the highest ranked second-placed team from the nine qualifying groups as well as the winners of four play-off matches between the runners-up of the other groups. These sixteen teams were divided equally into four groups, A, B, C and D, each consisting of four teams. The groups were drawn up by the UEFA administration, again using seeding. The seeded teams being the host nations, the reigning champions, should they qualify, and those with the best points per game coefficients over the qualifying phase of the tournament and the previous World Cup qualifying. Other finalists were assigned to by means of a draw, using coefficients as a basis.

For the 2016 tournament, the expansion to 24 teams means that the teams will be drawn into six groups of four, with the six group winners, six group runners-up and the four best third-placed teams advancing to the round of 16 when it becomes a knockout competition.

The groups are again played in a league format, where a team plays its opponents once each. The same points system is used (three points for a win, one point for a draw, no points for a defeat). A schedule for the group matches will be drawn up, but the last two matches in a group must kick off simultaneously. The winner and runner-up of each group progress to the next round, where a knockout system is used (the two teams play each other once, the winner progresses), this is used in all subsequent rounds as well. The winners of the quarter-finals matches progress to the semi-finals, where the winners play in the final. If in any of the knockout rounds, the scores are still equal after normal playing time, extra time and penalties are employed to separate the two teams. Unlike the FIFA World Cup, this tournament no longer has a third place playoff.

<doc id="249511" wikidata="Q1785279" url="?curid=249511" title="M3 motorway (Great Britain)">
<text>The M3 is a motorway in England, from Sunbury-on-Thames, Surrey, to Eastleigh, Hampshire; a distance of approximately . The route includes the Aldershot Urban Area, Basingstoke, Winchester, and Southampton.

It was constructed as a dual three-lane motorway except for its two-lane section between junction 8 (A303) and junction 9. The motorway was opened in phases, ranging from Lightwater/Bagshot to Popham in 1971 to Winchester to Otterbourne Hill in 1995. The latter stages attracted opposition from environmental campaigns across Britain due to its large cutting through wooded Twyford Down; numerous road protests were held which delayed its opening. Similar protests were avoided on the near-parallel A3 by the construction of the Hindhead Tunnel. Since completion, the motorway has been an artery to the west and midsections of the South Coast and Isle of Wight including for tourism. The major settlements nearest to the motorway are served by a railway also used for commuting but are relatively dispersed. Traffic on the M3 sees delays and congestion on its busiest sections near commuting hotspots and during holiday periods. From Chertsey to Fleet the road was in 2017 converted to a Smart Motorway, turning the hard shoulder into a permanent fourth lane with emergency refuge lay-bys.

==History==

The motorway was originally approved as the &quot;London to Basingstoke Motorway&quot; with delays over funding for an extension to Southampton the road was built to relieve two single carriageway trunk roads that were congested.

In 1967, sections of the A33 from Popham, Hampshire, to a northeastern point of the Winchester Bypass were widened to dual carriageways; this only partially alleviated growing congestion, especially in Winchester, which led to the southern phase gaining approval.

===Eastern section===
The eastern section, from Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey to Popham near Basingstoke opened in sections: first the Hampshire section in 1971, and then the Surrey section in 1974. The cost for this first phase was £46m. The completed road acts were as a continuation of the A316 Country Way, an express three-lane road from Apex Corner, Hanworth, in Greater London to Sunbury-on-Thames.

The section is one of five routes into the southern half of London which reach Inner London with at least a dual-carriageway - or dual-direction - road, the others being the A3 (M), the A30/A4, the M20 and A2. However approximately one mile before reaching Inner London it combines with the routes of the A30 and M4 approaches.

===Southern section===
A first public inquiry for the &quot;M3 London to Basingstoke Motorway: Popham to Compton extension&quot; centred on the section passing Winchester, and was held in 1971, after which the ministry was instructed to reconsider and reconsult on the proposals. A second public inquiry was held in 1976–77. The earlier decision to route the motorway through or alongside the water meadows between St Catherine&#x27;s Hill and the compact cathedral city was reopened, and during the year-long inquiry the headmaster of Winchester College was forcibly ejected along with others for causing a disturbance.

The scope of the M3 extension was reduced to defer the difficult decision about the section around Winchester and it was built in two sections (from &#x27;Popham to Bridget&#x27;s Farm&#x27; and from &#x27;Bridget&#x27;s Farm to Bar End&#x27;) in 1985. When this opened, the temporary junction to the A33 parallel route was removed.

The section of the M3 from near Junction 12 (Eastleigh and Chandler&#x27;s Ford) to the last, Junction 14 for the M27 replaced part of the A33, which was upgraded to motorway standard and opened in 1991.

In 2008, the busiest section of the motorway, at Chandler&#x27;s Ford, carried a daily average of around 130,000 vehicles.

The southern section starts as a continuation of a single-lane avenue, Bassett Avenue and The Avenue in the City of Southampton as the M27 provides alternative routes from other parts of the city, particularly its waterfront and downtown peak-hour accessway, the M271 motorway and Mountbatten Way providing dual to three lane highways starting at the northwest of the city.

===Abandoned/suspended proposals===
A service station was envisaged at Basingstoke upon the motorway&#x27;s completion but not built – superseded by one just north of Fleet and another north of Winchester.
Plans for a Basingstoke Services were again published in November 2017

===Additions===
An additional junction, numbered 4A, was opened in April 1992 for Fleet.

==Detailed route==
The M3 starts at Sunbury-on-Thames in Surrey on the edge of South West London as the continuation of the A316 which has three lanes each way from Hanworth in the London Borough of Hounslow, and two from Chiswick. The motorway after its start turns more west-southwest, crosses the River Thames on the M3 Chertsey Bridge to the north of Chertsey and then has its second junction, at the M25 motorway, before continuing through the gorse, bogs and heather of the Surrey Heath. Its third junction is for Camberley, Bagshot, Bracknell, Ascot and Worplesdon. From Junction 4 it bisects the northern Blackwater Valley conurbation then has its latest junction for Fleet and nearby early 21st century expanded/new villages, it crosses the South West Main Line, before skirting Old Basing and Basingstoke to its north. Turning south west again, it passes Popham and, just before reaching Junction 8, where one lane becomes the A303 which leads to Exeter and South West England. From here the motorway continues as a dual two lane road through open countryside and Micheldever Wood until it reaches the north of Winchester.

Taking over the &quot;Winchester Bypass&quot; the M3 resumes to three lanes each way at Junction 9, continues directly south and then takes a small curve around the east of the city running through a deep cutting in Twyford Down and then proceeding south west again, crossing the South West Main Line a second time alongside the River Itchen and through the Eastleigh urban-suburban area before crossing the Eastleigh to Romsey railway line and ending at the Chilworth Roundabout on the edge of Southampton.

===Road features===
*The Spitfire Bridge carries the B3404 Alresford Road from Winchester over the M3 motorway and the parallel A272 (J9-J10 spur, known as the &quot;Spitfire Link&quot;). It replaced a concrete parabolic arch bridge under which a Curtiss P-40 had been flown by George Rogers in October 1941. It was generally assumed locally that the aircraft had been a Spitfire, hence the name.

*A private exit of the northern roundabout connected to Junction 4a provides access to the former UK headquarters of Sun Microsystems. As of 2018, this is now a new housing estate, Helios Park
*The section of the M3 between J2 and J4a has been converted into a smart motorway, with full opening on 30 June 2017.

==Incidents==
*In the early morning of 25 April 1999, the drum and bass DJ and record producer Valerie Olukemi &quot;Kemi&quot; Olusanya, known as Kemistry, was killed on the M3 near Winchester by the steel body of a cat&#x27;s eye, which had been dislodged by a van and flew through the windscreen of the following car in which she was a passenger. The object hit her in the face and killed her instantly. The coroner recorded a verdict of accidental death. A question was asked in the House of Lords about the safety of cat&#x27;s eyes in light of the highly unusual incident, and the Highways Agency conducted an investigation into the &quot;long-term integrity and performance&quot; of various types of road stud.
*On 1 April 2000, a zebra crossing was illegally painted across the northbound carriageway of the M3 between Junctions 4 and 4a.
*On 23 September 2017, two firebombs were thrown from a bridge onto the motorway between junctions 9 and 11 by 17-year-old Nicholas Elger (who suffered from a psychiactric illness) leading to an 11-hour closure costing the economy an estimated £40million. The attacker was identified after being linked to a bottle of Voss water used to transport the fuel. Elger told police he wished he had killed somebody and entered guilty pleas to two counts of arson recklessly endangering life.

Alabama is divided into 67 counties and contains 461 municipalities consisting of 174 cities and 287 towns. These cities and towns cover only of the state&#x27;s land mass but are home to of its population.

The Code of Alabama 1975 defines the legal use of the terms &quot;town&quot; and &quot;city&quot; based on population. A municipality with a population of 2,000 or more is a city, while less than 2,000 is a town. For legislative purposes, municipalities are divided into eight classes based on the municipality&#x27;s population, as certified by the 1970 federal decennial census. The class of a municipality does not change if its population increases or decreases since the population figures refer to the 1970 federal census. Any municipality incorporated after June 28, 1979, is placed in a class according to the population of the municipality at the time of its incorporation. Class 1 is defined as all cities with a population of at least 300,000, as of the 1970 census. Birmingham is the state&#x27;s only Class 1 municipality. Class 2 are cities between 175,000 and 299,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Mobile is the state&#x27;s only Class 2 municipality. Montgomery and Huntsville are Class 3 municipalities. Class 3 cities are those with populations between 100,000 and 174,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Tuscaloosa and Gadsden are Class 4 cities with between 50,000 and 99,999 inhabitants, as of the 1970 census. Class 5 are cities with a population greater than 25,000 and less than 49,999. Class 6 are those with between 12,000 and 24,999 inhabitants, and Class 7 are cities with a population from 6,000 to 11,999 inhabitants. Class 8 includes all towns, plus all remaining cities with populations of less than 6,000.

<doc id="249524" wikidata="Q1540642" url="?curid=249524" title="Harrowing of Hell">
<text>In Christian theology, the Harrowing of Hell (, &quot;the descent of Christ into Hell&quot; or Hades) is the period of time between the Crucifixion of Jesus and his resurrection. In triumphant descent, Christ brought salvation to the souls held captive there since the beginning of the world.

Christ&#x27;s descent into the world of the dead is referred to in the Apostles&#x27; Creed and the Athanasian Creed (), which state that he &quot;descended into the underworld&quot; (), although neither mention that he liberated the dead. His descent to the underworld is alluded to in the New Testament in 1 Peter 4:6, which states that the &quot;good tidings were proclaimed to the dead&quot;. The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; notes Ephesians 4:9, which states that &quot;[Christ] descended into the lower parts of the earth&quot;, as also supporting this interpretation. These passages in the New Testament have given rise to differing interpretations. The Harrowing of Hell is commemorated in the liturgical calendar on Holy Saturday.

According to &quot;The Catholic Encyclopedia&quot;, the story first appears clearly in the Gospel of Nicodemus in the section called the Acts of Pilate, which also appears separately at earlier dates within the Acts of Peter and Paul. The descent into Hell had been related in Old English poems connected with the names of Cædmon (e.g. &quot;Christ and Satan&quot;) and Cynewulf. It is subsequently repeated in Ælfric of Eynsham&#x27;s homilies , which is the first known inclusion of the word &quot;harrowing&quot;. Middle English dramatic literature contains the fullest and most dramatic development of the subject.

As a subject in Christian art, it is also known as the (Greek for &quot;resurrection&quot;), considered a creation of Byzantine culture and first appearing in the West in the early 8th century.

==Background==
The Old Testament view of the afterlife was that all people when they died, whether righteous or unrighteous, went to Sheol, a dark, still place. Several works from the Second Temple period elaborate the concept of Sheol, dividing it into sections based on the righteousness or unrighteousness of those who have died.

The New Testament maintains a distinction between Sheol, the common &quot;place of the dead&quot;, and the eternal destiny of those condemned at the Final Judgment, variously described as Gehenna, &quot;the outer darkness&quot;, or a lake of eternal fire.

== Terminology ==
The Greek wording in the Apostles&#x27; Creed is (), and in Latin is . The Greek (, &quot;the lowest&quot;) and the Latin (&quot;those below&quot;) may also be translated as &quot;underworld&quot;, &quot;netherworld&quot;, or &quot;abode of the dead&quot;.

The realm into which Jesus descended is called Hell, in long-established English usage, but is also called Sheol or Limbo by some Christian theologians to distinguish it from the Hell of the damned. In Classical mythology, Hades is the underworld inhabited by departed souls, and the god Pluto is its ruler. Some New Testament translations use the term &quot;Hades&quot; to refer to the abode or state of the dead to represent a neutral place where the dead awaited the death, burial, and resurrection of Jesus.

The word &quot;harrow&quot; originally comes from the Old English meaning &quot;to harry or despoil&quot;, and is seen in the homilies of Aelfric, . The term &#x27;Harrowing of Hell&#x27; refers not merely to the idea that Jesus descended into Hell, as in the Creed, but to the rich tradition that developed later, asserting that he triumphed over , releasing Hell&#x27;s captives, particularly Adam and Eve, and the righteous men and women of the Old Testament period.

==Scripture==
The Harrowing of Hell is mentioned or suggested by several verses in the New Testament:
*Matthew 12:40: &quot;For just as Jonah was three days and three nights in the belly of the sea monster, so for three days and three nights the Son of Man will be in the heart of the earth.&quot;
*Matthew 27:50–54: &quot;And Jesus cried out again with a loud voice, and yielded up His spirit. Then, behold, the veil of the temple was torn in two from top to bottom; and the earth quaked, and the rocks were split, and the graves were opened; and many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised; and coming out of the graves after His resurrection, they went into the holy city and appeared to many. So when the centurion and those with him, who were guarding Jesus, saw the earthquake and the things that had happened, they feared greatly, saying, &#x27;Truly this was the Son of God!
*Acts 2:24: &quot;But God raised him up, having freed him from death, because it was impossible for him to be held in its power.&quot;
*Acts 2:31: &quot;Foreseeing this, David spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah, saying, &#x27;He was not abandoned to Hades, nor did his flesh experience corruption&#x27;.&quot;
*Ephesians 4:9: &quot;In saying, &#x27;he ascended&#x27;, what does it mean but that he had also descended into the lower regions, the earth?&quot;
*Colossians 1:18: &quot;He is the head of the body, the church; he is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, so that he might come to have first place in everything.&quot;
*1 Peter 3:18–19: &quot;For Christ also suffered for sins once for all, the righteous for the unrighteous, in order to bring you to God. He was put to death in the flesh, but made alive in the spirit, in which also he went and made a proclamation to the spirits in prison, ...&quot;
*1 Peter 4:6: &quot;For this is the reason the gospel was proclaimed even to the dead, so that, though they had been judged in the flesh as everyone is judged, they might live in the spirit as God does.&quot;

Theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar sees parallels with Mark 3:24: &quot;If a kingdom is divided against itself, that kingdom cannot stand. And if a house is divided against itself, that house will not be able to stand. And if Satan has risen up against himself and is divided, he cannot stand, but his end has come. But no one can enter a strong man’s house and plunder his property without first tying up the strong man; then indeed the house can be plundered.&quot; That and Matthew 16:18 (&quot;And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.&quot;) speak to Jesus&#x27;s power and the impotence of Satan.

== Early Christian teaching ==

The Harrowing of Hell was taught by theologians of the early church: St Melito of Sardis (died c. 180) in his &quot;Homily on the Passover&quot; and more explicitly in his &quot;Homily for Holy Saturday,&quot; Tertullian (&quot;A Treatise on the Soul&quot;, 55, though he himself disagrees with the idea), Hippolytus (&quot;Treatise on Christ and Anti-Christ&quot;), Origen (&quot;Against Celsus&quot;, 2:43), and, later, Ambrose (died 397) all wrote of the Harrowing of Hell. The early heretic Marcion and his followers also discussed the Harrowing of Hell, as mentioned by Tertullian, Irenaeus, and Epiphanius. The 6th-century sect called the Christolytes, as recorded by John of Damascus, believed that Jesus left his soul and body in Hell, and only rose with his divinity to Heaven.

The Gospel of Matthew relates that immediately after Christ died, the earth shook, there was darkness, the veil in the Second Temple was torn in two, and many people rose from the dead, and after the resurrection (Matthew 27:53) walked about in Jerusalem and were seen by many people there. Balthasar says this is a &quot;visionary and imaginistic&quot; description of Jesus vanquishing death itself.

According to the apocryphal Gospel of Nicodemus, the Harrowing of Hell was foreshadowed by Christ&#x27;s raising of Lazarus from the dead prior to his own crucifixion.

In the Acts of Pilate – usually incorporated with the widely-read medieval Gospel of Nicodemus – texts built around an original that might have been as old as the 3rd century AD with many improvements and embroidered interpolations, chapters 17 to 27 are called the &quot;Decensus Christi ad Inferos&quot;. They contain a dramatic dialogue between Hades and Prince Satan, and the entry of the King of Glory, imagined as from within Tartarus. 

==Interpretations of the doctrine==
===Orthodoxy===
John Chrysostom&#x27;s Paschal Homily also addresses the Harrowing of Hades, and is typically read during the Paschal Vigil, the climactic service of the Orthodox celebration of Pascha (Easter).

In the Eastern Orthodox Church, the Harrowing of Hades is celebrated annually on Holy and Great Saturday during the Vesperal Divine Liturgy of Saint Basil, as is normative for the Byzantine Rite. At the beginning of the service, the hangings in the church and the vestments worn by the clergy are all somber Lenten colours (usually purple or black). Then, just before the Gospel reading, the liturgical colors are changed to white and the deacon performs a censing, and the priest strews laurel leaves around the church, symbolizing the broken gates of Hell; this is done in celebration of the harrowing of Hades then taking place, and in anticipation of Christ&#x27;s imminent resurrection.

====Icon====
The Harrowing of Hades is generally more common and prominent in Orthodox iconography compared to the Western tradition. It is the traditional icon for Holy Saturday, and is used during the Paschal season and on Sundays throughout the year.

The traditional Orthodox icon of the Resurrection of Jesus, partially inspired by the apocryphal Acts of Pilate (4th c.), does not depict simply the physical act of Christ coming out of the Tomb, but rather it reveals what Orthodox Christians believe to be the spiritual reality of what his Death and Resurrection accomplished. The icon depicts Jesus, vested in white and gold to symbolize his divine majesty, standing on the brazen gates of Hades (also called the &quot;Doors of Death&quot;), which are broken and have fallen in the form of a cross, illustrating the belief that by his death on the cross, Jesus &quot;trampled down death by death&quot; (see Paschal troparion). He is holding Adam and Eve and pulling them up out of Hades. Traditionally, he is not shown holding them by the hands but by their wrists, to illustrate the theological teaching that mankind could not pull himself out of his Original sin, but that it could come about only by the work (&quot;energia&quot;) of God. Jesus is surrounded by various righteous figures from the Old Testament (Abraham, David, etc.); the bottom of the icon depicts Hades as a chasm of darkness, often with various pieces of broken locks and chains strewn about. Quite frequently, one or two figures are shown in the darkness, bound in chains, who are generally identified as personifications of Death or the devil.

===Catholicism===
There is an ancient homily on the subject, of unknown authorship, usually entitled &quot;The Lord&#x27;s Descent into Hell&quot; that is the second reading at the Office of Readings on Holy Saturday in the Roman Catholic Church.

The &quot;Catechism of the Catholic Church&quot; states: &quot;By the expression &#x27;He descended into Hell&#x27;, the Apostles&#x27; Creed confesses that Jesus did really die and through his death for us conquered death and the devil &#x27;who has the power of death&#x27; (Hebrews 2:14). In his human soul united to his divine person, the dead Christ went down to the realm of the dead. He opened Heaven&#x27;s gates for the just who had gone before him.&quot;

As the Catechism says, the word &quot;Hell&quot;—from the Norse, &quot;Hel&quot;; in Latin, ; in Greek, (Hades); in Hebrew, (Sheol)—is used in Scripture and the Apostles&#x27; Creed to refer to the abode of all the dead, whether righteous or evil, unless or until they are admitted to Heaven (CCC 633). This abode of the dead is the &quot;Hell&quot; into which the Creed says Christ descended. His death freed from exclusion from Heaven the just who had gone before him: &quot;It is precisely these holy souls who awaited their Savior in Abraham&#x27;s bosom whom Christ the Lord delivered when he descended into Hell&quot;, the Catechism states (CCC 633), echoing the words of the Roman Catechism, 1, 6, 3. His death was of no avail to the damned.

Conceptualization of the abode of the dead as a place, though possible and customary, is not obligatory (Church documents, such as catechisms, speak of a &quot;state or place&quot;). Some maintain that Christ did not go to the place of the damned, which is what is generally understood today by the word &quot;Hell&quot;. For instance, Thomas Aquinas taught that Christ did not descend into the &quot;Hell of the lost&quot; in his essence, but only by the effect of his death, through which &quot;he put them to shame for their unbelief and wickedness: but to them who were detained in Purgatory he gave hope of attaining to glory: while upon the holy Fathers detained in Hell solely on account of original sin, he shed the light of glory everlasting.&quot;

While some maintain that Christ merely descended into the &quot;limbo of the fathers&quot;, others, notably theologian Hans Urs von Balthasar (inspired by the visions of Adrienne von Speyr), maintain that it was more than this and that the descent involved suffering by Jesus. Some maintain that this is a matter on which differences and theological speculation are permissible without transgressing the limits of orthodoxy. However, Balthasar&#x27;s point here has been forcefully condemned by conservative Catholic outlets.

===Lutheranism===
Martin Luther, in a sermon delivered in Torgau in 1533, stated that Christ descended into Hell.

The Formula of Concord (a Lutheran confession) states, &quot;we believe simply that the entire person, God and human being, descended to Hell after his burial, conquered the devil, destroyed the power of Hell, and took from the devil all his power&quot; (Solid Declaration, Art. IX).

Many attempts were made following Luther&#x27;s death to systematize his theology of the descensus, whether Christ descended in victory or humiliation. For Luther, however, the defeat or &quot;humiliation&quot; of Christ is never fully separable from His victorious glorification. Luther himself, when pressed to elaborate on the question of whether Christ descended to Hell in humiliation or victory responded, &quot;It is enough to preach the article to the laypeople as they have learned to know it in the past from the stained glass and other sources.&quot;

===Anglicanism===
&quot;Anglican orthodoxy, without protest, has allowed high authorities to teach that there is an intermediate state, Hades, including both Gehenna and Paradise, but with an impassable gulf between the two.&quot; The traditional language of the Apostles&#x27; Creed affirms that Jesus &quot;descended into hell&quot;; the contemporary &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; says that Jesus &quot;descended to the dead&quot; (BCP, pp. 53, 96).

===Calvinism===
John Calvin expressed his concern that many Christians &quot;have never earnestly considered what it is or means that we have been redeemed from God&#x27;s judgment. Yet this is our wisdom: duly to feel how much our salvation cost the Son of God.&quot;

Calvin&#x27;s conclusion is that &quot;If any persons have scruples about admitting this article into the Creed, it will soon be made plain how important it is to the sum of our redemption: if it is left out, much of the benefit of Christ’s death will be lost.&quot; Calvin strongly opposed the notion that Christ freed prisoners, as opposed to traveling to Hell as part of completing his sufferings.

The Reformed interpret the phrase &quot;he descended into Hell&quot; as referring to Christ&#x27;s pain and humiliation &quot;prior&quot; to his death, and that this humiliation had a spiritual dimension as part of God&#x27;s judgement upon the sin which he bore on behalf of Christians. The doctrine of Christ&#x27;s humiliation is also meant to assure believers that Christ has redeemed them from the pain and suffering of God&#x27;s judgment on sin.

===The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints===

The Harrowing of Hell has been a unique and important doctrine among members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints since its founding in 1830 by Joseph Smith, although members of the church (known as &quot;Mormons&quot;) usually call it by other terms, such as &quot;Christ&#x27;s visit to the spirit world&quot;. Like Christian exegetes distinguishing between Sheol and Gehenna, Latter-day Saints distinguish between the realm of departed spirits (the &quot;spirit world&quot;) and the portion (or state) of the wicked (&quot;spirit prison&quot;). The portion or state of the righteous is often referred to as &quot;paradise&quot;.

Perhaps the most notable aspect of Latter-day Saint beliefs regarding the Harrowing of Hell is their view on the purpose of it, both for the just and the wicked. Joseph F. Smith, the sixth president of the Church, explained in what is now a canonized revelation, that when Christ died, &quot;there were gathered together in one place an innumerable company of the spirits of the just, ... rejoicing together because the day of their deliverance was at hand. They were assembled awaiting the advent of the Son of God into the spirit world, to declare their redemption from the bands of death&quot;.

In the Latter-day Saint view, while Christ announced freedom from physical death to the just, he had another purpose in descending to Hell regarding the wicked. &quot;The Lord went not in person among the wicked and the disobedient who had rejected the truth, to teach them; but behold, from among the righteous, he organized his forces ... and commissioned them to go forth and carry the light of the gospel to them that were in darkness, even to all the spirits of men; and thus was the gospel preached to the dead, ... to those who had died in their sins, without a knowledge of the truth, or in transgression, having rejected the prophets&quot;. From the Latter-day Saint viewpoint, the rescue of spirits was not a one-time event but an ongoing process that still continues. This concept goes hand-in-hand with the doctrine of baptism for the dead, which is based on the Latter-day Saint belief that those who choose to accept the gospel in the spirit world must still receive the saving ordinances in order to dwell in the kingdom of God. These baptisms and other ordinances are performed in Latter-day Saint temples, wherein a church member is baptized vicariously, or in behalf of, those who died without being baptized by proper authority. The recipients in the spirit world then have the opportunity to accept or reject this baptism.

==Rejection of the doctrine==
Although the Harrowing of Hell is taught by the Lutheran, Catholic, Reformed, and Orthodox traditions, a number of Christians reject the doctrine of the &quot;harrowing of hell&quot;, claiming that &quot;there is scant scriptural evidence for [it], and that Jesus&#x27;s own words contradict it.&quot; John Piper, for example, says &quot;there is no textual [i.e. Biblical] basis for believing that Christ descended into hell&quot;, and, therefore, Piper does not recite the &quot;he descended into hell&quot; phrase when saying the Apostles&#x27; Creed. Wayne Grudem also skips the phrase when reciting the Creed; he says that the &quot;single argument in ... favor [of the &quot;harrowing of hell&quot; clause in the Creed] seems to be that it has been around so long. ... But an old mistake is still a mistake.&quot; In his book &quot;Raised with Christ&quot;, Pentecostal Adrian Warnock agrees with Grudem, commenting, &quot;Despite some translations of an ancient creed [i.e. the Apostles&#x27; Creed], which suggest that Jesus ... &#x27;descended into hell&#x27;, there is no biblical evidence to suggest that he actually did so.&quot;

Augustine, in his 99th epistle, confesses that this text is replete with difficulties. This he declares is clear, beyond all doubt, that Jesus Christ descended in soul after his death into the regions below, and concludes with these words: &quot;Quis ergo nisi infidelis negaverit fuisse apud inferos Christum?&quot; (&quot;Who, then, but an unbeliever, has denied that Christ was in hell?&quot;) In this prison souls would not be detained unless they were indebted to divine justice, nor would salvation be preached to them unless they were in a state that was capable of receiving salvation.

===Christian mortalism===
The above views share the traditional Christian belief in the immortality of the soul. The mortalist view of the intermediate state requires an alternative view of the and , taking a view of the New Testament use of Hell as equivalent to use of Hades in the Septuagint and therefore to Sheol in the Old Testament. William Tyndale and Martin Bucer of Strassburg argued that Hades in Acts 2 was merely a metaphor for the grave. Other reformers Christopher Carlisle and Walter Deloenus in London, argued for the article to be dropped from the creed. The Harrowing of Hell was a major scene in traditional depictions of Christ&#x27;s life avoided by John Milton due to his mortalist views. Mortalist interpretations of the Acts 2 statements of Christ being in Hades are also found among later Anglicans such as E. W. Bullinger.

While those holding mortalist views on the soul would agree on the &quot;harrowing of hell&quot; concerning souls, that there were no conscious dead for Christ to literally visit, the question of whether Christ himself was also dead, unconscious, brings different answers:
* To most Protestant advocates of &quot;soul sleep&quot; such as Martin Luther, Christ himself was not in the same condition as the dead, and while his body was in Hades, Christ, as second person of the Trinity, was conscious in heaven.
* To Christian mortalists who are also non-Trinitarian, such as Socinians and Christadelphians, the maxim &quot;the dead know nothing&quot; includes also Christ during the three days.

Of the three days, Christ says &quot;I was dead&quot; (Greek &quot;egenomen nekros&quot; ἐγενόμην νεκρὸς, Latin ).

== In culture ==

===Drama===
The richest, most circumstantial accounts of the Harrowing of Hell are found in medieval dramatic literature, such as the four great cycles of English Mystery plays which each devote a separate scene to depict it. Christ was portrayed as conquering Satan, and then victoriously leading out Adam and Eve, the prophets, and the patriarchs. The earliest surviving Christian drama probably intended to be performed is the &quot;Harrowing of Hell&quot; found in the 8th-century &quot;Book of Cerne&quot;.

The subject is found also in the Cornish Mystery plays and the York and Wakefield cycles. These medieval versions of the story derive from scripture, but the details come from the Gospel of Nicodemus.

=== Literature ===

==== Middle Ages ====

In Dante&#x27;s &quot;Inferno&quot; the Harrowing of Hell is mentioned in Canto IV by the pilgrim&#x27;s guide Virgil. Virgil was in Limbo (the first circle of Hell) in the first place because he was not exposed to Christianity in his lifetime, and therefore he describes Christ in generic terms as a &quot;mighty one&quot; who rescued the Hebrew forefathers of Christianity, but left him and other virtuous pagans behind in the very same circle. It is clear that Virgil does not fully understand the significance of the event as Dante does.

An incomplete Middle English telling of the Harrowing of Hell is found in the Auchinleck manuscript.

Although the Orfeo legend has its origin in pagan antiquity, the medieval romance of &quot;Sir Orfeo&quot; has often been interpreted as drawing parallels between the Greek hero and Jesus freeing souls from Hell, with the explication of Orpheus&#x27; descent and return from the Underworld as an allegory for Christ&#x27;s as early as the &quot;Ovide Moralisé&quot; (1340).

==== Modern ====

The Catholic philologist and fantasy author J. R. R. Tolkien echoes the Harrowing of Hell theme in multiple places in &quot;The Silmarillion&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; (1954–55). Identified instances include the tale &quot;Of Beren and Lúthien&quot; in which Beren is rescued from Sauron&#x27;s dark dungeons, and Gandalf&#x27;s freeing of King Théoden of Rohan from the dark insinuations of the traitorous Wormtongue.

In Stephen Lawhead&#x27;s novel &quot;Byzantium&quot; (1997), a young Irish monk is asked to explain Jesus Christ&#x27;s life to a group of Vikings, who were particularly impressed with his &quot;descent to the underworld&quot; &quot;(Helreið)&quot;.

Parallels in Jewish literature refer to legends of Enoch and Abraham&#x27;s harrowings of the Underworld, unrelated to Christian themes. These have been updated in Isaac Leib Peretz&#x27;s short story &quot;Neilah in Gehenna&quot;, in which a Jewish hazzan descends to Hell and uses his unique voice to bring about the repentance and liberation of the souls imprisoned there.

===Music===
* The Harrowing of Hell is the subject of baroque oratorios including Salieri&#x27;s &quot;Gesù al Limbo&quot; (1803) to a text by Luigi Prividali.

===Art===
* A follower of Hieronymus Bosch depicts &quot;Christ in Limbo&quot; in a vivid composition, now owned by the Indianapolis Museum of Art.

=== Television ===

* The harrowing is mentioned in the eponymous episode of the British dark comedy anthology series &quot;Inside No. 9&quot;.
* In &quot;Supernatural&quot;, the seraph Castiel is said to have earned the respect of other angels during the harrowing due to his military prowess.

<doc id="249526" wikidata="Q907689" url="?curid=249526" title="Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense System">
<text>The Aegis ballistic missile defense system (Aegis BMD or ABMD), also known as &quot;Sea-Based Midcourse&quot;, is a Missile Defense Agency program under the United States Department of Defense developed to provide missile defense against short and intermediate-range ballistic missiles. The program is part of the United States national missile defense strategy and European NATO missile defense system.

Aegis BMD is an expansion of the Aegis combat system deployed on warships, designed to intercept ballistic missiles in mid-course phase (i.e., after the rocket burn has completed but prior to reentry into the atmosphere). Aegis BMD-equipped vessels can engage potential threats using the Standard Missile 3 mid-course interceptors and the Standard Missile 2 and Standard Missile 6 terminal-phase interceptors.

==History and technical development==

===Origins===

The current effort to deploy Aegis ballistic missile defense (ABMD) was begun during the mid-1980s as part of President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI). The SDI plan was initially for a space-based railgun system. However, technological constraints caused the system to be transformed into a surface-based system known as the Lightweight Exo-Atmospheric Projectile (LEAP). The original testing of the LEAP was done as part of the Army LEAP program.

Later, SDIO worked with the Navy to test the LEAP on the Terrier missile. The Terrier LEAP demonstration program lasted from 1991 into 1995 and consisted of four flight tests. Two of these were intercept tests in early 1995; both failed to intercept—the first had a software error in the second-stage booster, the second had a squib (pyrotechnic switch to connect power) in the kinetic kill vehicle that was mounted backwards and failed to fire.

===Program history and development===
During the late 1990s, the U.S. Navy was tasked to provide a weapon system for exploratory testing of LEAP. This phase was designated the Aegis LEAP Intercept (ALI) program. The program was for two successful intercepts in five attempts. On June 13, 2002, the second successful ALI intercept occurred during the FM-3 flight test mission. Initial Aegis BMD success may have contributed to President George W. Bush&#x27;s decision to deploy an emergency ballistic missile capability by late 2004.

Upon the completion of the ALI program, Aegis BMD was transitioned to the production phase. The first Block I production SM-3 was delivered in October 2004, and the Aegis 3.0 update was delivered in 2005.

This system was given major new importance by President Obama in September 2009, when he announced plans to scrap the plans for a missile defense site in Poland, in favor of missile defense systems located on U.S. Navy warships. On 18 September 2009, Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin welcomed Obama&#x27;s plans for missile defense which may include stationing American Aegis armed warships in the Black Sea, as these are likely to be less effective against Russia&#x27;s missile attacks. In 2009 several U.S. Navy ships were fitted with SM-3 missiles to serve this function, which complements the Patriot systems already deployed by American units. Warships of Japan and Australia also have been given weapons and technology to enable them to participate as well.

Current Aegis BMD hardware includes the SM-3 Block-1a missile and other improvements to the Aegis Weapons System. Future development of the Aegis BMD system includes Launch on Remote capability, upgraded SM-3 avionics and hardware, and an upgraded Aegis Weapon System. In 2012 Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense will merge with Aegis Open Architecture and deliver the benefits of both platforms. The Launch on Remote capability involves the use of off-board sensors, such as the Space Tracking and Surveillance System to provide a targeting solution for a SM-3 launch.

As of 2022, variations of the Aegis BMD system currently in service are the 4.x, 5.x and 6.x. The improved versions are equipped with advanced processors and software, as well as upgraded variants of the SM-3 interceptor missile. BMD capable ships can have their BMD capabilities upgraded from earlier versions to later versions. BMD version 6.x comes with AN/SPY-6 radar in Flight III and Flight IIA destroyers.

US Army Integrated Air and Missile Defense Battle Command System (IBCS) program will integrate MIM-104 Patriot, NASAMS, AN/TPY-2 and F-35 Lightning II radars with Aegis radars to create a plug and fight network of land, sea, and air-based sensors and aid surface-to-air Patriot and THAAD launchers in anti-ballistic missile capabilities.

===SM-3, SM-2 Block IV, SM-6 and GPI interceptors===

The Aegis BMD uses the RIM-161 Standard Missile 3 mid-course interceptors and the RIM-156 Standard Extended Range Block IV (SM-2ER Block IV) terminal-phase interceptors developed by Raytheon. The Standard Missile 3 is a development of the SM2-ER Block IV, capable of intercepting ballistic missiles above the atmosphere (i.e., exo-atmospheric intercept) during the midcourse phase of a hostile ballistic missile&#x27;s flight. The missile is launched from the Mk 41 Vertical Launching System (VLS) of the warships. It receives in-flight target updates from the ship. The kinetic warhead (KW) is designed to destroy a ballistic missile&#x27;s warhead with more than 130 megajoules of kinetic energy by colliding with it. The existing SM-3 Block IA version will be upgraded to SM-3 Block IB, SM-3 Block IIA and SM-3 Block IIB to counter future ballistic missile threats.

The SM-2ER Block IV can engage the ballistic missiles within the atmosphere (i.e., endoatmospheric intercept) in the terminal phase of a missile&#x27;s trajectory. The missile carries a blast fragmentation warhead. The SM-2ER Block IV was further developed in a new extended range active missile, RIM-174 Standard ERAM (Standard Missile 6), which adds an active radar homing seeker. SM-6 is a dual-capability missile that can be used for either air defense (i.e., countering aircraft and anti-ship cruise missiles) or terminal ballistic missile defense; it is not meant to replace the SM-2 series of missiles, but will serve alongside and provide extended range and increased firepower. In January 2018 the Navy approved plans to develop a Dual Thrust Rocket Motor for the SM-6, with a larger 21-inch diameter to replace the current 13.5-inch propulsion package. The new rocket motor would sit atop the current 21-inch booster, producing a new variant of the missile: the SM-6 Block IB.

In March 2018 the MDA announced it &quot;is evaluating the technical feasibility of the capability of the SM-3 Block IIA missile, currently under development, against an ICBM-class target. If proven to be effective against an ICBM, this missile could add a layer of protection, augmenting the currently deployed GMD system.&quot; The MDA plans to conduct a demonstration of the SM-3 Block IIA against an ICBM-like target by the end of 2020. On November 17, 2020, an SM-3 Block IIA missile successfully intercepted a threat-representative Intercontinental Ballistic Missile (ICBM) target in its mid-course phase of flight, reaffirming the capability to intercept non-separating, simple separating, and complex-separating ballistic missiles.

Glide Phase Interceptor (GPI) will provide defense against hypersonic weapons. Glide Phase Interceptor will be integrated with modified Baseline 9 Aegis Weapon System.

In 2024, the Patriot PAC-3 was successfully tested with the Aegis system.

===Aegis Ashore===
As of the 2014 NATO Wales summit a land-based component, Aegis Ashore, was being developed. The first site to be declared operational was Deveselu, Romania in 2016. This consists of equipment commonly used by the Navy being deployed in land-based facilities. This includes SPY-1 radars and a battery of Standard Missile-3s. The Obama administration&#x27;s plans call for two sites: the first in Romania at Deveselu that was opened in May 2015 and the second in Redzikowo, Poland (originally planned for 2018, opened in summer 2024). In 2020, both will get the latest versions of the Aegis BMD software and the latest version of the SM-3. Some radar facilities will be placed in Turkey at a future date.

On 21 May 2014, U.S. DOD headlined, &quot;Standard Missile Completes First Test Launch from Aegis Ashore Test Site,&quot; and reported that: &quot;The Missile Defense Agency, the U.S. Navy, and sailors at the Aegis Ashore Missile Defense Test Complex and Pacific Missile Range Facility (PMRF), successfully conducted the first flight test involving components of the Aegis Ashore system. During the test, a simulated ballistic missile target was acquired, tracked, and engaged by the Aegis Weapon System. At approximately 7:35 p.m. Hawaii Standard Time, May 20 (1:35 a.m. EDT, May 21), the Aegis Weapon System fired a Standard Missile (SM)-3 Block IB guided missile from the Vertical Launch System. Several fire control and engagement functions were exercised during the test. A live target missile launch was not planned for this flight test.&quot;

On 19 December 2017, the Cabinet of Japan approved a plan to purchase two Aegis Ashore systems equipped with the AN/SPY-7(V)1, based on Lockheed Martin&#x27;s LRDR to increase Japan&#x27;s self-defence capability against North Korea, using SM-3 Block IIA missiles, and also could work with SM-6 interceptors capable of shooting down cruise missiles. The installation sites are at a Ground Self-Defense Force training area in Araya District, Akita Prefecture and the Mutsumi training area in Hagi, Yamaguchi Prefecture.

On 15 June 2020, Japanese Defense Minister Taro Kono announced that work had been halted on the deployment of the system because additional costs would be needed to ensure that residential buildings would not be hit by rocket boosters used to launch the missiles. Later in the month Japan&#x27;s National Security Council confirmed the cancellation of the plan. On 23 September 2020, Lockheed Martin commented that it would be expensive to potentially convert the AA system for maritime use since a revamp in the design is required.

In July 2020 Admiral Philip S. Davidson, the head of United States Indo-Pacific Command advised that he sought funding to construct an Aegis Ashore system in Guam by 2026 both to defend existing U.S. military facilities on Guam and to provide offensive &quot;long-range precision strike capability into the First Island Chain&quot; dominated by China. Speaking in March 2021 Davidson said that the &quot;Guam Defense System&quot; of an Aegis Ashore Facility would free up three &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers for service elsewhere. Davidson said that Chinese submarines and surface ships together with its ballistic missiles pose &quot;a 360-degree threat&quot; to Guam beyond the capabilities of the existing Terminal High Altitude Area Defense system on Guam.

===Developers and Contractors===
Notable subcontractors and technical experts include Boeing Defense, Space &amp; Security, Alliant Techsystems (ATK), Honeywell, Engility, Naval Surface Warfare Center, SPAWAR Systems Center, Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory (JHU/APL), and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Lincoln Laboratory (Lincoln Lab).

==Deployment==
===Aegis Ashore===
The U.S., Romania and Poland have deployed the land based Aegis BMD. Test installation was built at the US Pacific Missile Range Facility in Hawaii in 2000s. A site in Deveselu, Romania has been operational since 2016, while a site at Redzikowo, Poland has been operational since the summer of 2024. Though Japan intended to deploy two sites which would use an AN/SPY-7 AESA radar, these plans were cancelled in 2020. Possible deployments of Aegis Ashore include US Naval Base Guam.

===U.S. Navy Aegis BMD vessels===
As of October 2017, there were 5 s and 28 &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers (DDGs 51–78) of the US Navy&#x27;s &quot;Arleigh Burke&quot;-class destroyers equipped with BMD in the U.S. Navy. Of the 33 ships, 17 are assigned to the Pacific Fleet and 16 to the Atlantic Fleet. The Navy&#x27;s FY2015 30-year (FY2015-FY2043) shipbuilding plan projects that the total number of Aegis cruisers and destroyers will be between 80 and 97 during the 30-year period.

, , and were upgraded in fiscal year 2012, while , and were upgraded in fiscal year 2013.

===Japanese Aegis BMD vessels===

The JMSDF has equipped four ships of the &quot;Kongo&quot;-class destroyers for LRST and engagement: , , , and the (in 2010) (&quot;See table below&quot;). Japan&#x27;s foreign minister, Hirofumi Nakasone and South Korea&#x27;s Minister of Foreign Affairs, Yu Myung-hwan, agreed that early April 5, 2009, launch of the North Korean Unha-2 satellite violated UN resolutions 1695 and 1718 of July 2006. Japan&#x27;s cabinet examined approval of a JMSDF AEGIS BMD engagement in the event of a failure of the Taepondong launch. The Japanese government also noted that it could bypass cabinet for an interception under Article 82, Section 2, Paragraph 3 of the Self-Defence Forces law. In total, five AEGIS destroyers were deployed at that time. Supplemental to SM-3 capability the Japanese system incorporates an airborne component. Together discrimination between platform tests and satellite launches is possible by analyzing the angle of ascent.

On August 31, 2022, the Japan Ministry of Defense announced that JMSDF will operate two &quot;Aegis system equipped ships&quot; (イージス・システム搭載艦 in Japanese) (&quot;pictured&quot;) to replace its earlier cancellation of the Aegis Ashore program, commissioning one ship by the end of fiscal year 2027, and the other by the end of FY2028. The budget for design and other related expenses are to be submitted in the form of &quot;item requests&quot;, without specific amounts, and the initial procurement of the lead items are expected to clear legislation by FY2023. Construction is to begin in the following year of FY2024. When completed, at each, the two warships will be the largest surface combatant ships operated by Japan.

On 6 October 2022, five warships from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held a multilateral ballistic missile defense exercise in the Sea of Japan (&quot;pictured&quot;) as part of the military response to ongoing North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile tests over the Japanese home islands.

On 16 November 2022, the guided-missile destroyer fired an SM-3 Block IIA missile, successfully intercepting the target outside the atmosphere in the first launch of the missile from a Japanese warship. On 18 November 2022, the likewise fired an SM-3 Block IB missile with a successful hit outside the atmosphere (&quot;pictured&quot;). Both test firings were conducted at the U.S. Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai Island, Hawaii, in cooperation with the U.S. Navy and U.S. Missile Defense Agency. This was the first time the two ships conducted SM-3 firings in the same time period, and the tests validated the ballistic missile defense capabilities of Japan&#x27;s newest s.

On 23 December 2022, the Japanese Ministry of Defense&#x27;s 2023 budget and program guidance illustrated examples of operation (運用の一例) for the Aegis-equipped naval forces of the Japanese Maritime Self Defense Force (MSDF). The two ASEV warship would be exclusively tasked for dedicated ballistic missile defense (BDM) missions (BMD等) and operate off the Korean peninsula in the Sea of Japan, allowing the other Aegis guided-missile destroyers to meet other contingencies (侵攻阻止) while operating independently to keeping the sea lines of communication (SLOC) open in the East China Sea southwest of the Japanese home islands.

===Joint BMD patrols===
In early October 2022, five warships from the United States, Japan, and South Korea held a ballistic missile defense exercise (&quot;pictured&quot;) in the Sea of Japan as part of the ongoing military response to ongoing North Korean intermediate-range ballistic missile tests over the Japanese home islands.

==Political debate==
Tom Laliberty of Raytheon said that President Barack Obama was forced to shift from a land based missile defense system to a sea based one because of the difficulties of coordinating with partner nations. Also, the U.S. Defense Department has said it would be just one component of a wider defense which might also include ground-based facilities. 

A Navy panel headed by retired Vice Adm. Phillip Balisle has asserted that since the late 1990s there has been an over-emphasis on saving money, including cuts in crews and streamlined training and maintenance, which has led to a drastic decline in readiness, and has left Aegis combat systems in low state of readiness. And in spite of a reduction in the objective for the number of Aegis armed warships to field, the U.S. Navy will still fall short of this reduced objective under the fiscal year for 2012 shipbuilding plan for the next 30 years.

==International reaction==

The Russian government has claimed that the system is &quot;fueling a new arms race&quot;, and is constructed &quot;on ridiculous fabricated pretexts&quot; of protection against non-existent threats of the so-called rogue states. Dmitry Rogozin, the Deputy Prime Minister of the Russian government, said in 2012 that the country would &quot;react in the sharpest manner&quot; to any American ships armed with the system found near their shores.

==Other capabilities==

The Aegis BMD system, coupled with the RIM-161 Standard missile (SM-3), has also demonstrated a limited capability as an anti-satellite weapon against satellites in the lower portion of low Earth orbit. On February 20, 2008, USA 193 was destroyed by a group of Aegis ships in the Pacific; the stated reason was concern that satellite&#x27;s hydrazine payload might contaminate land area upon re-entry from an uncontrolled orbit. The launching vessel was , and one SM-3 missile was used. Interception was at an altitude of 133 nautical miles (247 kilometers).

==Target for simulating endo-atmospheric flight of DF-21 ASBM==

According to a Congressional Research Service report dated July 31, 2014, the lack of a test target simulating the Chinese DF-21 ASBM is highlighted.

A threat representative Anti-Ship Ballistic Missile (ASBM) target for operational open-air testing has become an immediate test resource need. China is fielding the DF-21D ASBM, which threatens U.S. and allied surface warships in the Western Pacific. While the Missile Defense Agency has exo-atmospheric targets in development, no program currently exists for an endo-atmospheric target. The endo-atmospheric ASBM target is the Navy&#x27;s responsibility, but it is not currently budgeted. The Missile Defense Agency estimates the non-recurring expense to develop the exo-atmospheric target was $30 million with each target costing an additional $30 million; the endo-atmospheric target will be more expensive to produce according to missile defense analysts. Numerous Navy acquisition programs will require an ASBM surrogate in the coming years, although a limited number of targets (3-5) may be sufficient to validate analytical models
The December 2012 report from DOT&amp;E (i.e., DOT&amp;E&#x27;s annual report for FY2012) did not further discuss this issue; a January 21, 2013, press report stated that this is because the details of the issue are classified.

The U.S. arsenal has a &quot;variety of potential countermeasures&quot; and the &quot;kill chain&quot; of for example a potential DF-21D attack would be so &quot;complicated&quot; that it would provide a &quot;number of opportunities to defeat the attack&quot;. He also stated that unless one country integrates an &quot;entire system of systems&quot; to make this work, the missile itself would be pretty &quot;useless&quot;.
&quot;Some countries might buy them just to impress their neighbors, but their combat effectiveness would be negligible unless the country also invested in the needed detection, data processing, and communications systems&quot;. - Roger Cliff

A December 16, 2016, press report states the following:
The Missile Defense Agency (MDA) said its new Sea Based Terminal (SBT) system achieved its second ballistic missile intercept during a Dec. 14 test over the Pacific Ocean.
During the test, the USS John Paul Jones (DDG-53)... fired a salvo of two Raytheon [RTN] Standard Missile-6 (SM-6) interceptors in immediate succession against a medium-range ballistic missile target launched from the Pacific Missile Range Facility on Kauai, Hawaii. The first interceptor was not armed and was designed to collect test data, MDA said. The second interceptor, which carried an explosive warhead, intercepted the Lockheed Martin-built target….

MDA called the target &quot;complex&quot; but declined to elaborate. However, according to the Missile Defense Advocacy Alliance, the target emulated China&#x27;s Dong-Feng 21 (DF-21), a ballistic missile equipped with a maneuverable re-entry vehicle and designed to destroy U.S., aircraft carriers. The event, designated Flight Test Standard Missile-27 (FTM-27), was SBT&#x27;s first salvo test and its second intercept in as many tries.

In March 2020, Mike Griffin, the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, revealed that SM-6 missile was being considered for hypersonic defense and that there are plans to test it against an actual hypersonic boost-glide vehicle in the 2023 Fiscal Year.

An April 14, 2021 press report stated:
The Missile Defense Agency, together with the U.S. Navy, plan to test an SM-6 missile against an &quot;advanced maneuvering threat,&quot; a term that has been used in relation to unpowered hypersonic boost-glide vehicles, later this year. The Pentagon says that unspecified versions of the SM-6 have already demonstrated some degree of capability against these types of weapons, examples of which Russia and China have already begun putting to service. A new variant of the SM-6, the Block IB, is already under development and will itself be able to reach hypersonic speeds. Barbara McQuiston, a senior U.S. official currently performing the duties of the Under Secretary of Defense for Research and Engineering, including mention of the scheduled SM-6 test in her testimony before the Senate Appropriations Committee&#x27;s Subcommittee on Defense yesterday…. 

==Flight tests to date==
As of April 2024, Aegis BMDS has performed 45 successful intercepts in 54 attempts against ballistic missile targets.

<text>This is a geographical list of [[rock (geology)|natural stone]] used for decorative purposes in construction and monumental sculpture produced in various countries.

The dimension-stone industry classifies stone based on appearance and hardness as either &quot;granite&quot;, &quot;marble&quot; or &quot;slate&quot;.

The granite of the dimension-stone industry along with truly granitic rock also includes gneiss, gabbro, anorthosite and even some sedimentary rocks.

Natural stone is used as architectural stone (construction, flooring, cladding, counter tops, curbing, etc.) and as raw block and monument stone for the funerary trade. Natural stone is also used in custom stone engraving. The engraved stone can be either decorative or functional. Natural memorial stones are used as natural burial markers.

<text>The plains zebra (Equus quagga, formerly &quot;Equus burchellii&quot;) is the most common and geographically widespread species of zebra. Its range is fragmented, but spans much of southern and eastern Africa south of the Sahara. Six or seven subspecies have been recognised, including the quagga which was thought to be a separate species. More recent research supports variations in zebra populations being clines rather than subspecies.

Plains zebras are intermediate in size between the larger Grévy&#x27;s zebra and the smaller mountain zebra and tend to have broader stripes than both. Great variation in coat patterns exists between clines and individuals. The plains zebra&#x27;s habitat is generally, but not exclusively, treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, both tropical and temperate. They generally avoid desert, dense rainforest and permanent wetlands. Zebras are preyed upon by lions and spotted hyenas, Nile crocodiles and, to a lesser extent, leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs.

Plains zebras are a highly social species, forming harems with a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring; bachelor groups also form. Groups may come together to form herds. The animals keep watch for predators; they bark or snort when they see a predator and the harem stallion attacks predators to defend his harem.

The plains zebra remains common in game reserves, but is threatened by human activities, such as hunting for its meat and hide, as well as competition with livestock and encroachment by farming on much of its habitat. The loss of open grasslands due to woody plant encroachment increases predation risk and therewith habitat. Plains zebra are listed as near threatened by the IUCN as of 2016. The species population is stable and not endangered, though populations in most countries have declined sharply.

==Taxonomy==
The plains zebra was formally classified by British zoologist John Edward Gray in 1824 as &quot;Equus burchellii&quot;. After the quagga, described by Pieter Boddaert in 1785, was found to be the same species in the 21st century, the plains zebra was reclassified as &quot;Equus quagga&quot; due to the principle of priority. The plains zebra and mountain zebra were traditionally placed in the subgenus &quot;Hippotigris&quot;, in contrast to Grévy&#x27;s zebra, which was considered the sole species of the subgenus &quot;Dolichohippus&quot;; however, recent (2013) phylogenetic evidence finds that plains zebras are more closely related to Grévy&#x27;s zebras than mountain zebras. Groves and Bell (2004) place all three species in the subgenus &quot;Hippotigris&quot;, and zebras appear to be a monophyletic lineage. In areas where plains zebras are sympatric with Grévy&#x27;s zebras, finding them in the same herds is not unusual, and fertile hybrids occur.

===Subspecies===
In their 2004 study of cranial and pelage differences between specimens, Groves and Bell found support for the division of the plains zebra into six subspecies:

*Sometimes a seventh subspecies is recognised.

Burchell&#x27;s zebra was thought to have been hunted to extinction. However, Groves and Bell concluded that &quot;the extinct true Burchell&#x27;s zebra is a phantom&quot;. Careful study of the original zebra populations in Zululand and Eswatini and of skins harvested on game farms in Zululand and Natal has revealed that a certain small proportion shows similarity to what now is regarded as typical &quot;burchellii&quot;. The type localities of the subspecies &quot;Equus quagga burchellii&quot; and &quot;Equus quagga antiquorum&quot; are so close to each other that the two are in fact one and that, therefore, the older of the two names should take precedence over the younger. They suggested that the correct name for the subspecies must be &quot;burchellii&quot;, not &quot;antiquorum&quot;.

A 2005 genetic study confirmed the quagga being the same species as the plains zebra. It showed that the quagga had little genetic diversity and that it diverged from the other plains zebra subspecies only 120,000–290,000 years ago, during the Pleistocene and, possibly, the penultimate glacial maximum. Its distinct coat pattern may have evolved rapidly because of geographical isolation and/or adaptation to a drier environment. In addition, plains zebra subspecies tend to have less striping the further south they live, and the quagga was the most southern-living of them all.

The simplified cladogram below is based on the 2005 analysis (some taxa shared haplotypes and could therefore not be differentiated):
A 2018 DNA study found no evidence for a subspecies structure in plains zebras but, instead, observed a north–south genetic continuum. Modern plains zebra populations appear to have originated from Southern Africa around 370,000 years ago with plains zebras in Uganda, the most northern population, being the most distinct.

==Physical description==

The plains zebra stands at a height of with a head-body length of and a tail length of . Males weigh while females weigh . The species is intermediate in size between the larger Grévy&#x27;s zebra and the smaller mountain zebra. It is dumpy bodied with relatively short legs and a skull with a convex forehead and a somewhat concave nose profile. The neck is thicker in males than in females. The ears are upright and have rounded tips. They are shorter than in the mountain zebra and narrower than in Grévy&#x27;s zebra. As with all wild equids, the plains zebra has an erect mane along the neck and a tuft of hair at the end of the tail. The body hair of a zebra is , shorter than in other African ungulates.
Like all zebras, they are boldly striped in black and white and no two individuals look exactly alike. Compared to other species, the plains zebra has broader stripes. The stripes are vertical on the fore part of the body, and tend towards the horizontal on the hindquarters. Northern zebra populations have narrower and more defined striping; southern populations have varied but lesser amounts of striping on the under parts, the legs and the hindquarters. Southern populations also have brown &quot;shadow&quot; stripes between the black and white colouring. These are absent or poorly expressed in northern zebras. The natal coat of a foal is brown and white and the brown darkens with age.

Various abnormalities of the patterns have been documented in plains zebras. Melanistic zebras have high concentrations of dark stripes on the torso but low concentrations on the legs. &quot;Spotted&quot; individuals display interruptions in black striping patterns. There have even been morphs with white spots on dark backgrounds. Striping abnormalities have been linked to inbreeding. Albino zebras have been recorded in the forests of Mount Kenya, with the dark stripes being blonde. The quagga had brown and white stripes on the head and neck, brown upper parts and a white belly, tail and legs.

==Ecology==

===Range and habitat===

The plains zebra&#x27;s range stops short of the Sahara from South Sudan and southern Ethiopia extending south along eastern Africa, as far as Zambia, Mozambique, and Malawi, before spreading into most southern African countries. They may have lived in Algeria in the Neolithic era. Plains zebras generally live in treeless grasslands and savanna woodlands, but can be found in a variety of habitats, both tropical and temperate. However, they are generally absent from deserts, dense rainforests, and permanent wetlands. They generally prefer Acacieae woodlands over &quot;Commiphora&quot;. They are water-dependent and live in more mesic environments than other African equids. They seldom wander from a water source. Zebras also live in elevations from sea level to on Mount Kenya.

Depending on the population, zebra herds may be sedentary, being highly dense with small ranges, or migratory, being less populated with separate, extensive dry and wet home ranges. When migrating, zebras appear to rely on some memory of the locations where foraging conditions were best and may predict conditions months before their arrival.

The loss of open grasslands due to woody plant encroachment increases predation risk and therewith habitat.

===Diet and predation===
Plains zebras primarily feed on grass; preferred species being &quot;Themeda triandra&quot;, &quot;Cynodon dactylon&quot;, &quot;Eragrostis superba&quot; and &quot;Cenchrus ciliaris&quot;. Zebra sometimes browse or dig for corms and rhizomes during the dry season. They appear to partial to eating scorched &quot;Colophospermum mopane&quot; and &quot;Pterocarpus rotundifolius&quot;, consuming both the leaves and twigs.

Plains zebras are adapted for grazing on both long, tough grass stems and newly emerging short grass. In some areas, it rarely feeds below to ground level. It ranges more widely than many other species, even into woodlands, and it is often the first grazing species to appear in a well-vegetated area. The flexible upper lip allows them to push plant material between the incisors to cut. Zebras have a less efficient digestive system than ruminants but food passage is twice as fast. Thus, zebras are less selective in foraging, but they do spend much time eating. The zebra is a pioneer grazer and prepares the way for more specialised grazers such as blue wildebeests and Thomson&#x27;s gazelles.
The plains zebra&#x27;s major predators are lions and spotted hyenas. Lions are most successful when targeting lone individuals, usually an old male while hyenas chase and isolate an individual from the group, usually a female or foal. Nile crocodiles also prey on zebras when they are near water. Less common predators include leopards, cheetahs and African wild dogs, which mostly hunt foals. When in the presence of a lion, zebras remain alert and stand in a semi-circle at as much as and no less than . Stallions sometimes try to drive lions away with bluff charges. By contrast, zebras may approach cheetahs and wild dogs and a single hyena is allowed to come within a few metres. To escape from predators, an adult zebra can run at . When being hunted by hyenas or wild dogs, a zebra harem stays close together and cooperates to protect threatened members, particularly the young. The harem stallion goes on the offensive and attacks the dogs or hyenas.

==Behaviour==
Plains zebras are nomadic and non-territorial, home ranges vary from to , depending on the area and if the population is migratory. They are more active during the day and spend most of their time feeding. Other activities include dust bathing, rubbing, drinking and intermittent resting which is very brief. At night, zebra activity is subdued except when threatened by predators. They may rest or sleep laying down, while one individual keeps guard.

===Social structure===

The plains zebra is highly social and usually forms small family groups called harems, which consist of a single stallion, several mares and their recent offspring. The adult membership of a harem is highly stable, typically remaining together for months to years. Groups of all-male &quot;bachelors&quot; also exist. These are stable groups of up to 15 males with an age-based hierarchy, led by a young male. These males stay in their groups until they are ready to start a harem. The bachelors prepare for their adult roles with play fights and greeting/challenge rituals, which take up most of their activities.

Multiple harems and bachelor groups come together to form larger herds of hundreds of animals, especially during migrations. Plains zebras are unusual among harem-holding species in forming these groups. In addition, pairs of harems may create temporarily stable subgroups within a herd, allowing individuals to interact with those outside their group. Among harem-holding species, this has only been observed in primates such as the gelada and the hamadryas baboon. Bachelor groups tend to be at the periphery of herds and when the herd moves, the bachelors trail behind.

Stallions form and expand their harems by abducting young mares from their natal harems. When a mare reaches sexual maturity and has her first oestrous cycle, she attracts the attention of nearby stallions, both bachelors and harem leaders. Her family stallion (likely her father) chases off or fights stallions attempting to abduct her. Even after a young mare is isolated from her natal harem, the fight over her continues until her oestrous cycle is over and it starts again with the next oestrous cycle. It is rare that the mare&#x27;s original abductor keeps her for long. When the mare finally ovulates, the male that impregnates her keeps her for good. Thus, the mare becomes a permanent member of a new harem. Oestrus in a female becomes less noticeable to outside males as she gets older, hence competition for older females is virtually nonexistent.
Mares exist in a hierarchy, with the alpha female being the first to mate with the harem stallion and being the one to lead the group. When new mares are added to the group, they are met with hostility by the other mares. Thus, the harem stallion must shield the new mares until the aggression subsides. The most recently added females rank lowest. Females that become unfit or weak may drop in their rank, though. The female membership of a harem stays intact, even if a new stallion takes over. During herd gatherings, family stallions may be cordial towards each other, while the mares are less tolerant.

A stallion defends his harem from other males. When challenged, the stallion issues a warning to the invader by rubbing nose or shoulder with him. If the warning is not heeded, a fight breaks out. Zebra fights often become very violent, with the animals biting at each other&#x27;s necks, heads, or legs, wrestling to the ground and occasional kicking. Sometimes, a stallion lies still on the ground as if surrendering, but once the other male lets up, he strikes and continues the fight. Most fighting occurs over young mares in oestrus and as long as a harem stallion is healthy, he usually is not challenged. Only unhealthy stallions have their harems taken over and even then, the new stallion gradually takes over, pushing the old one out without a fight.

===Communication===

At least six different calls have been documented for the plains zebra. One is its distinctive, high-pitched, contact call (commonly called &quot;barking&quot;) heard as &quot;a-&quot;ha&quot;, a-&quot;ha&quot;, a-&quot;ha&quot;&quot; or &quot;kwa-ha, kaw-ha, ha, ha&quot; also transcribed as &quot;kwahaah&quot;, or &quot;oug-ga&quot;. The species name &quot;quagga&quot; is derived from the Khoikhoi word for &quot;zebra&quot; and is onomatopoeic for its call. When a predator is sighted, a zebra makes a two-syllable alarm call. A loud snort is made when moving in cover of potential danger. When in contentment, a zebra makes a more drawn-out snort. Males make a short, high-pitched squeal when hurt, and foals emit a drawn-out wail when in distress.

Two main facial expressions are made by zebras; the greeting and threat. In both cases, the lips are pulled back and chewing motions are made. Greeting involves the ears sticking up and directing forward; while the threat involves the ears down. Zebras strengthen their social bonds with grooming. Members of a harem nip and scrape along the neck, withers, and back with their teeth and lips. Mothers and foals groom the most often, followed by siblings. Grooming shows social status and eases aggressive behaviour.

===Reproduction and parenting===

The stallion mates with all his mares. Males exhibit the flehmen response to test for female receptivity, which involves the upper lip curling back to smell for urine (via the vomeronasal organ). The female signals her readiness for copulation by straddling her legs and raising her tail. The gestation period lasts around a year, and a single young is produced. Mares may give birth to one foal every twelve months. The birthing peak is during the rainy season. A mare gives birth within the vicinity of her group and while lying down on her side. The newborn foal weighs and the afterbirth is rarely consumed.

A newborn is capable of standing almost immediately and starts to eat grass within a week. Early on, a mother zebra keeps any other zebra away from her foal, including the stallion, the other mares, and even her previous offspring. Later, though, they all bond. Within the group, a foal has the same rank as its mother. The stallion is generally intolerant of foals that are not his, and zebras may practice infanticide and feticide.

Mortality for foals is high in their first year of life and is usually caused by predation. However, zebra young are afforded more protection than those of species like wildebeest and hartebeest. A foal is usually weaned at around eleven months, but may suckle for longer. Females reach puberty before three years, and males after five or six. Young male zebras eventually leave their family groups as the relationship with their mothers fades after the birth of a sibling. The young stallion then seeks out other young stallions for company. Young females may stay in the harem until they are abducted by another stallion. Plains zebras have an average lifespan of 25 years in the wild.

===Conservation===

In 2016, the plains zebra was classified as near threatened by the IUCN. As of that year, the total population is estimated to be around 500,000 individuals. The species remains common throughout its range but has experienced population declines in 10 of the 17 countries where it is native. They are stable in Ethiopia, Malawi, and South Africa and possibly Angola; stable or increasing in Mozambique, Namibia and Eswatini; and decreasing in Botswana, DR Congo, Kenya, Rwanda, Somalia, South Sudan, Tanzania, Uganda, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. They are extinct in Burundi, Lesotho and possibly Somalia.

Zebras are threatened by hunting for their hide and meat, and habitat change from farming. They also compete with livestock for food, and fencing blocks migration routes. Civil wars in some countries have also caused declines in zebra populations. The zebra can be found in numerous protected areas across its range, including the Serengeti National Park in Tanzania, Tsavo and Masai Mara in Kenya, Hwange National Park in Zimbabwe, Etosha National Park in Namibia, and Kruger National Park in South Africa. Some stable populations live in unprotected areas.

The quagga was hunted by early Dutch settlers and later by Afrikaners to provide meat or for their skins. The skins were traded or used locally. The quagga was probably vulnerable to extinction due to its limited distribution, and it may have competed with domestic livestock for forage. The last known wild quagga died in 1878. The last captive quagga, a female in Amsterdam&#x27;s Natura Artis Magistra zoo, lived there from 9 May 1867 until it died on 12 August 1883, but its origin and cause of death are unclear. In 1984, the quagga was the first extinct animal to have its DNA analysed, and the Quagga Project is trying to recreate the phenotype of hair coat pattern and related characteristics by selectively breeding Burchell&#x27;s zebras.

===In popular culture===

Zebras have been featured in African art and culture for millennia. They have been depicted in rock art in Southern Africa (modern Botswana, Namibia and South Africa) dating from 20,000–28,000 years ago, though not as commonly as antelope species like eland. How the zebra got its stripes has been the subject of folk tales, some of which involve it being scorched by fire. The San people associated zebra stripes with water, rain and lighting due to its dazzling pattern.
The plains zebra is the national animal of the Republic of Botswana and its stripes are depicted on the country&#x27;s flag. The flag stripes also represent racial harmony in the country. The zebra has also been associated with beauty and the women of various societies would paint much of their bodies in stripes. For the Shona people of Zimbabwe, the zebra is a totem animal, along with the eland, buffalo, lion and monkey. The zebra is praised in a poem as an &quot;iridescent and glittering creature&quot;. Its stripes have symbolised the joining of male and female and at Great Zimbabwe, zebra stripes decorate what is believed to be a &quot;domba&quot;, a premarital school meant to initiate women into adulthood. In the Shona language, the name &quot;madhuve&quot; means &quot;woman/women of the zebra totem&quot; and is a given name for girls in Zimbabwe.

Zebras have also been represented in Western culture. They have been thought of as a more exotic alternative to horse; the comic book character Sheena, Queen of the Jungle is depicted riding a zebra. The film &quot;Racing Stripes&quot; features a captive zebra ostracised from the horses and end up being ridden by a rebellious girl. In the film &quot;Fantasia&quot;, two centaurs are depicted being half human and half zebra, instead of the typical half human and half horse. Zebras have been featured as characters in other animated films like &quot;Khumba&quot;, &quot;The Lion King&quot; and the &quot;Madagascar&quot; films.

<doc id="249550" wikidata="Q725344" url="?curid=249550" title="John Braine">
<text>John Gerard Braine (13 April 1922 – 28 October 1986) was an English novelist. Braine is usually listed among the angry young men, a loosely defined group of English writers who emerged on the literary scene in the 1950s.

==Early life==

John Braine was born in the Westgate area of central Bradford, West Riding of Yorkshire. The family later moved to the suburb of Thackley on the northern edge of the city. Braine left St. Bede&#x27;s Grammar School at 16 and worked in a shop, a laboratory and a factory before becoming, after the war, a librarian in Bingley, a small town up the Aire Valley and at Darton in 1954 where locals put his inattention down to his spending his time writing his first novel.

==Works==
Although he wrote 12 works of fiction, Braine is chiefly remembered today for his first novel, &quot;Room at the Top&quot; (1957). The novel was conceived when he was being treated for tuberculosis in a hospital near the Yorkshire Dales town of Grassington. He stated that his favourite author was Guy de Maupassant and that &quot;Room at the Top&quot; was based on &quot;Bel Ami&quot;, but that &quot;the critics didn&#x27;t pick it up&quot;. &quot;Room at the Top&quot; was turned into a successful 1959 film, with Laurence Harvey as Joe Lampton and featuring an Oscar–winning performance by Simone Signoret. In September 2012, BBC television broadcast a two-part dramatisation that had been delayed because of a dispute over copyright. Matthew McNulty was in the lead role.

After achieving literary success, Braine moved to the south of England, living from 1966 until his death in Woking. He wrote several more novels, including &quot;Life at the Top&quot;, a sequel to &quot;Room at the Top&quot;. His 1968 novel &quot;The Crying Game&quot; is set in London and captures some of the atmosphere of the &#x27;Swinging Sixties&#x27; (it is not related to the 1992 film of the same name). His 1974 book, &quot;Writing a Novel&quot;, was a guide for aspiring novelists.

==Political views==
Braine was mildly left-wing in his youth, but, like his contemporaries (and fellow &quot;angry young men&quot;) Kingsley Amis and John Wain, he later moved to the political right and supported America&#x27;s involvement in the Vietnam War. In 1967, Braine, Robert Conquest, Amis and several others signed a controversial letter to &quot;The Times&quot; titled &quot;Backing for U.S. Policies in Vietnam&quot;, supporting the US government in Vietnam.

==Personal life==
Braine was married to Helen Wood and had four children. They separated in the early 1980s, and Helen moved to Shropshire with the two youngest children. He died from a gastric haemorrhage in 1986 at the age of 64.

<doc id="249552" wikidata="Q241386" url="?curid=249552" title="Antigonus II Gonatas">
<text>Antigonus II Gonatas (, ; – 239 BC) was a Macedonian Greek ruler who solidified the position of the Antigonid dynasty in Macedon after a long period defined by anarchy and chaos and acquired fame for his victory over the Gauls who had invaded the Balkans.

==Birth and family==
Antigonus Gonatas was born around 320 BC. The origin of the Hellenistic nickname Gonatas is unknown. He was descended from the Diadochi (the successors of Alexander the Great) on both his father&#x27;s and mother&#x27;s side. His father was Demetrius Poliorcetes, himself the son of Antigonus I Monophthalmus, who then controlled much of Asia. His mother was Phila, the daughter of Antipater, who had controlled Macedonia and the rest of Greece since 334 BC and was recognized as regent of the empire, which in theory remained united. Cassander, Antipater&#x27;s oldest son who would become King of Macedon in 305 BC, was his uncle. The year of Antigonus Gonatas&#x27; birth, however, Antipater died, leading to further struggles for territory and dominance.

The careers of Antigonus&#x27;s grandfather Antigonus Monophthalmus and father showed great swings in fortune. After coming closer than anyone to reuniting the empire of Alexander, Antigonus Monophthalmus was defeated and killed in the great Battle of Ipsus in 301 BC and the territory he formerly controlled was divided among his enemies, Cassander, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Seleucus.

==Demetrius’ general==
The fate of Antigonus Gonatas, now 18, was closely tied with that of his father Demetrius, who escaped from the battle with 9,000 troops. Jealousy among the victors eventually allowed Demetrius to regain part of the power his father had lost. He conquered Athens and in 294 BC he seized the throne of Macedonia from Alexander, the son of Cassander.

Because Antigonus Gonatas was the grandson of Antipater and the nephew of Cassander through his mother, his presence helped to reconcile the supporters of these former kings to the rule of his father.

In 292 BC, while Demetrius was campaigning in Boeotia, he received news that Lysimachus, the ruler of Thrace and the enemy of his father, had been taken prisoner by Dromichaetes, a ruler of the Getae. Hoping to seize Lysimachus&#x27; territories in Thrace and Asia, Demetrius delegated command of his forces in Boeotia to Antigonus and immediately marched north. While he was away, the Boeotians rose in rebellion, but were defeated by Antigonus, who bottled them up in Thebes.

After the failure of his expedition to Thrace, Demetrius joined his son at the Siege of Thebes. As the Thebans defended their city stubbornly, Demetrius often forced his men to attack the city at great cost, even though there was little hope of capturing it. It is said that, distressed by the heavy losses, Antigonus asked his father: &quot;Why, father, do we allow these lives to be thrown away so unnecessarily?&quot; Demetrius appears to have shown his contempt for the lives of his soldiers by replying: &quot;We don&#x27;t have to find rations for the dead.&quot; But he also showed a similar disregard for his own life and was badly wounded at the siege by a bolt through the neck.

In 291 BC, Demetrius finally took the city after using siege engines to demolish its walls. But control of Macedonia and most of Greece was merely a stepping stone to his plans for further conquest. He aimed at nothing less than the revival of Alexander&#x27;s empire and started making preparations on a grand scale, ordering the construction of a fleet of 500 ships, many of them of unprecedented size.

Such preparations and the obvious intent behind them, naturally alarmed the other kings, Seleucus, Ptolemy, Lysimachus, and Pyrrhus, who immediately formed an alliance. In the spring of 288 BC Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet appeared off Greece, inciting the cities to revolt. At the same time, Lysimachus attacked Macedonia from the east while Pyrrhus did so from the west. Demetrius left Antigonus in control of the rest of Greece, while he hurried to Macedonia.

By now the Macedonians had come to resent the extravagance and arrogance of Demetrius, and were not prepared to fight a difficult campaign for him. In 287 BC, Pyrrhus took the Macedonian city of Beroea and Demetrius&#x27;s army promptly deserted and went over to the enemy who was much admired by the Macedonians for his bravery. At this change of fortune, Phila, the mother of Antigonus, killed herself with poison. Meanwhile, Athens revolted. Demetrius therefore returned and besieged the city, but he soon grew impatient and decided on a more dramatic course. Leaving Antigonus in charge of the war in Greece, he assembled all his ships and embarked with 11,000 infantry and all his cavalry to attack Caria and Lydia, provinces of Lysimachus.

As Demetrius was chased across Asia Minor to the Taurus Mountains by the armies of Lysimachus and Seleucus, Antigonus attained success in Greece. Ptolemy&#x27;s fleet was driven off and Athens surrendered.

==In the wilderness==
In 285 BC, Demetrius, worn down by his fruitless campaign, surrendered to Seleucus. At this point, he wrote to his son and to his commanders in Athens and Corinth telling them to henceforth consider him a dead man and to ignore any letters they might receive written under his seal. Macedonia, meanwhile, had been divided between Pyrrhus and Lysimachus, but, &quot;like two wolves sharing a piece of meat&quot;, they soon fought over it with the result that Lysimachus drove Pyrrhus out and took over the whole kingdom.

Following the capture of his father, Antigonus proved himself a dutiful son. He wrote to all the kings, especially Seleucus, offering to surrender all the territory he controlled and proposing himself as a hostage for his father&#x27;s release, but to no avail. In 283 BC, at the age of 55, Demetrius died in captivity in Syria. When Antigonus heard that his father&#x27;s remains were being brought to him, he put to sea with his entire fleet, met Seleucus&#x27;s ships near the Cyclades, and took the relics to Corinth with great ceremony. After this, the remains were interred at the town of Demetrias that his father had founded in Thessaly.

In 282 BC, Seleucus declared war on Lysimachus and the next year defeated and killed him at the Battle of Corupedium in Lydia. He then crossed to Europe to claim Thrace and Macedonia, but Ptolemy Keraunos, the son of Ptolemy, murdered Seleucus and seized the Macedonian throne. Antigonus decided the time was ripe to take back his father&#x27;s kingdom, but when he marched north, Ptolemy Keraunos defeated his army.

Ptolemy&#x27;s success, however, was short-lived. In the winter of 279 BC, a great horde of Gauls under their leader Brennus descended on Macedonia from the north, crushed Ptolemy&#x27;s army and killed him in battle, starting two years of complete anarchy in the kingdom. After plundering Macedonia, the Gauls invaded further regions of Greece, moving southwards. Antigonus cooperated in the defence of Greece against the barbarians, but the Aetolians took the lead in defeating the Gauls. In 278 BC a Greek army with a large Aetolian contingent checked the Gauls at Thermopylae and Delphi, inflicting heavy casualties and forcing them to retreat.

The next year (277 BC), Antigonus sailed to the Hellespont, landing near Lysimachia at the neck of the Thracian Chersonese. When an army of Gauls under the command of Cerethrius appeared, Antigonus laid an ambush. He abandoned his camp and beached his ships, then concealed his men. The Gauls looted the camp, but when they started to attack the ships, Antigonus&#x27;s army appeared, trapping them with the sea to their rear. In this way Antigonus resoundingly won the Battle of Lysimachia strengthening his claim to the Macedonian throne. Around this time, under these favourable omens, Antigonus&#x27;s niece-wife Phila gave birth to his son and successor, Demetrius II Aetolicus.

==Conquering the Macedonian throne==

Sosthenes, a Macedonian nobleman, had managed to check the Celts to a certain extent, but it was Antigonus who finally defeated them at Lysimachia and freed the Macedonians from years of terror, hardship and anarchy. As a son of Demetrius, who had ruled Macedon for several years, Antigonus had a legitimate claim to the Macedonian throne and now he was also seen as its savior.

After his victory over the Celts, Antigonus marched towards Macedon and had to fight his way into the country for others were still contending for the throne. First Antigonus defeated Antipater Etesias, a nephew of Cassander, he then drove Ptolemy Epigonos, a son of Lysimachus and Arsinoe, from the country. There were other pretenders, an Alexander and an Arrhidaeus, who might have been the same person. After defeating these, the final problem facing Antigonus was Apollodorus the tyrant of Cassandreia.

Antigonus besieged Cassandreia for ten months, but was unable to dislodge Appolodorus and his men. Antigonus then resorted to trickery, he retreated his army and sent one of his mercenary commanders, Ameinias the Phocian, to negotiate with Apollodorus. During the negotiations Ameinias had 2,000 of his men launch a surprise attack on the city with specially prepared ladders of the right height, they gained possession of the walls and summoned Antigonus. By the end of 276 BC Antigonus had gained control of most of Macedon.

==King of Macedonia==

===Antigonus against Pyrrhus===
Pyrrhus, king of Epirus, Macedonia&#x27;s western neighbour, was a general of mercurial ability, widely renowned for his bravery, but he did not apply his talents sensibly and often snatched after vain hopes, so that Antigonus used to compare him to a dice player, who had excellent throws, but did not know how to use them. When the Gauls defeated Ptolemy Ceraunus and the Macedonian throne became vacant, Pyrrhus was occupied in his campaigns overseas. Hoping to conquer first Italy and then Africa, he got involved in wars against Rome and Carthage, the two most powerful states in the western Mediterranean. He then lost the support of the Greek cities in Italy and Sicily by his haughty behaviour. Needing reinforcements, he wrote to Antigonus as a fellow Greek king, asking him for troops and money, but Antigonus politely refused. In 275 BC, the Romans fought Pyrrhus at the Battle of Beneventum which ended inconclusively, although many modern sources wrongly state that Pyrrhus lost the battle. Pyrrhus had been drained by his recent wars in Sicily, and by the earlier &quot;Pyrrhic victories&quot; over the Romans, and thus decided to end his campaign in Italy and return to Epirus.

Pyrrhus&#x27;s retreat from Italy, however, proved very unlucky for Antigonus. Returning to Epirus with an army of eight thousand foot and five hundred horse, he was in need of money to pay them. This encouraged him to look for another war, so the next year, after adding a force of Gallic mercenaries to his army, he invaded Macedonia with the intention of filling his coffers with plunder. The campaign, however, went better than expected. Making himself master of several towns and being joined by two thousand deserters, his hopes started to grow and he went in search of Antigonus, attacking his army in a narrow pass and throwing it into disorder at the Battle of the Aous River. Antigonus&#x27;s Macedonian troops retreated, but his own body of Gallic mercenaries, who had charge of his elephants, stood firm until Pyrrhus&#x27;s troops surrounded them, whereupon they surrendered both themselves and the elephants. Pyrrhus now chased after the rest of Antigonus&#x27;s army which, demoralised by its earlier defeat, declined to fight. As the two armies faced each other, Pyrrhus called out to the various officers by name and persuaded the whole body of infantry to desert. Antigonus escaped by concealing his identity. Pyrrhus now took control of upper Macedonia and Thessaly, while Antigonus held on to the coastal towns.

But Pyrrhus now wasted his victory. Taking possession of Aegae, the ancient capital of Macedonia, he installed a garrison of Gauls, who greatly offended the Macedonians by digging up the tombs of their kings and leaving the bones scattered about as they searched for gold. He also neglected to finish off his enemy. Leaving him in control of the coastal cities, he contented himself with insults. He called Antigonus a shameless man for still wearing the purple, but he did little to destroy the remnants of his power.

Before this campaign was finished, Pyrrhus had embarked upon a new one. In 272 BC, Cleonymus, an important Spartan, invited him to invade Laconia. Gathering an army of twenty-five thousand foot, two thousand horse, and twenty-four elephants, he crossed over to the Peloponnese and occupied Megalopolis in Arcadia. Antigonus, after reoccupying part of Macedonia, gathered what forces he could and sailed to Greece to oppose him. As a large part of the Spartan army led by king Areus was in Crete at the time, Pyrrhus besieged Sparta with great hopes of taking the city easily, but the citizens organized stout resistance, allowing one of Antigonus&#x27;s commanders, Aminias the Phocian, to reach the city with a force of mercenaries from Corinth. Soon after this, the Spartan king, Areus, returned from Crete with 2,000 men. These reinforcements stiffened resistance, and Pyrrhus, finding that he was losing men to desertion every day, broke off the attack and started to plunder the country.

The most important Peloponnesian city after Sparta was Argos. The two chief men, Aristippus and Aristeas, were keen rivals. As Aristippus was an ally of Antigonus, Aristeas invited Pyrrhus to come to Argos to help him take over the city. Antigonus, aware that Pyrrhus was advancing on Argos, marched his army there as well, taking up a strong position on some high ground near the city. When Pyrrhus learned this, he encamped about Nauplia and the next day dispatched a herald to Antigonus, calling him a coward and challenging him to come down and fight on the plain. Antigonus replied that he would choose his own moment to fight and that if Pyrrhus was weary of life, he could find many ways to die.

The Argives, fearing that their territory would become a war zone, sent deputations to the two kings begging them to go elsewhere and allow their city to remain neutral. Both kings agreed, but Antigonus won over the trust of the Argives by surrendering his son as a hostage for his pledge. Pyrrhus, who had recently lost a son in the retreat from Sparta, did not. Indeed, with the help of Aristeas, he was plotting to seize the city. In the middle of the night, he marched his army up to the city walls and entered through a gate that Aristeas had opened. His Gallic troops seized the market place, but he had difficulty getting his elephants into the city through the small gates. This gave the Argives time to rally. They occupied strong points and sent messengers asking Antigonus for help.

When Antigonus heard that Pyrrhus had treacherously attacked the city, he advanced to the walls and sent a strong force inside to help the Argives. At the same time Areus arrived with a force of 1,000 Cretans and light-armed Spartans. These forces attacked the Gauls in the market place. Pyrrhus, realising that his Gallic troops were hard pressed, now advanced into the city with more troops, but in the narrow streets this soon led to confusion as men got lost and wandered around. The two forces now paused and waited for daylight. When the sun rose, Pyrrhus saw how strong the opposition was and decided the best thing was to retreat. Fearing that the gates would be too narrow for his troops to easily exit the city, he sent a message to his son, Helenus, who was outside with the main body of the army, asking him to break down a section of the walls. The messenger, however, failed to convey his instructions clearly. Misunderstanding what was required, Helenus took the rest of the elephants and some picked troops and advanced into the city to help his father.

With some of his troops trying to get out of the city and others trying to get in, Pyrrhus&#x27;s army was now thrown into confusion. This was made worse by the elephants. The largest one had fallen across the gateway and was blocking the way, while another elephant, called Nicon, was trying to find its rider. This beast surged against the tide of fugitives, crushing friend and foe alike, until it found its dead master, whereupon it picked him up, placed him on its tusks, and went on the rampage. In this chaos Pyrrhus was struck down by a tile thrown by an old woman and killed by Zopyrus, a soldier of Antigonus.

Halcyoneus, one of Antigonus&#x27;s sons, heard that Pyrrhus had been killed. Taking the head, which had been cut off by Zopyrus, he rode to where his father was and threw it at his feet. Far from being delighted, Antigonus was angry with his son and struck him, calling him a barbarian and drove him away. He then covered his face with his cloak and burst into tears. The fate of Pyrrhus reminded him all too clearly of the tragic fates of his own grandfather and his father who had suffered similar swings of fortune. He then had Pyrrhus&#x27;s body cremated with great ceremony.

After the death of Pyrrhus, his whole army and camp surrendered to Antigonus, greatly increasing his power. Later, Halcyoneus discovered Helenus, Pyrrhus&#x27;s son, disguised in threadbare clothes. He treated him kindly and brought him to his father who was more pleased with his behaviour. &quot;This is better than what you did before, my son,&quot; he said, &quot;but why leave him in these clothes which are a disgrace to us now that we know ourselves the victors?&quot; Greeting him courteously, Antigonus treated Helenus as an honoured guest and sent him back to Epirus.

This was not the end of Antigonus&#x27; problems with Epirus: shortly after Alexander II, the son of Pyrrhus and his successor as king of Epirus, repeated his father&#x27;s adventure by conquering Macedonia. However, only a few years later, Alexander was not only expelled from Macedonia by Antigonus&#x27; son Demetrius, but he also lost Epirus and had to go into exile in Acarnania. His exile didn&#x27;t last long, as the Macedonians had to abandon Epirus eventually under pressure from Alexander&#x27;s allies, the Acarnanians and the Aetolians. Alexander seems to have died about 242 BC, leaving his country under the regency of his wife Olympias who proved anxious to have good relations with Epirus&#x27; powerful neighbour, as was sanctioned by the marriage between the regent&#x27;s daughter Phthia and Antigonus&#x27; son and heir Demetrius.

===Chremonidean War===
With the restoration of the territories captured by Pyrrhus, and with grateful allies in Sparta and Argos, and garrisons in Corinth and other cities, Antigonus securely controlled Macedonia and Greece. The careful way he guarded his power shows that he wished to avoid the vicissitudes of fortune that had characterized the careers of his father and grandfather. Aware that the Greeks loved freedom and autonomy, he was careful to grant a semblance of this in as much as it did not clash with his own power. Also, he tried to avoid the odium that direct rule brings by controlling the Greeks through intermediaries. It is for this reason that Polybius says, &quot;No man ever set up more absolute rulers in Greece than Antigonus.&quot; The tyrants installed or maintained by Gonatas include: Cleon (Sicyon, c. 300–280 BC), Euthydemus and Timocleidas (Sicyon c. 280–270 BC), Iseas (Keryneia, resigned 275 BC), Aristotimus (Elis, assassinated 272 BC), Aristippus the Elder (Argos, from 272 BC), Abantidas (Sicyon, 264–252 BC), Aristodemus the Good (Megalopolis, assassinated 252 BC), Paseas (Sicyon, 252–251 BC), Nicocles (Sicyon, 251 BC), Aristomachus (Argos, assassinated 240 BC), Lydiadas, (Megalopolis, c. 245–235 BC), and Aristippus (Argos, 240–235 BC).

The next stage of Antigonus&#x27;s career is not documented and what we know has been patched together from a few historical fragments: Antigonus seems to have been on very good terms with Antiochus, the Seleucid ruler of Asia, whose love for Stratonice, the sister of Antigonus, is very famous. Such an alliance naturally threatened the third successor state, Ptolemaic Egypt. In Greece, Athens and Sparta, once the dominant states, naturally resented the domination of Antigonus. The pride, which in the past had made these cities mortal enemies, now served to unite them. In 267 BC, probably with encouragement from Egypt, an Athenian by the name of Chremonides persuaded the Athenians to join the Spartans in declaring war on Antigonus (see Chremonidean War).

The Macedonian king responded by ravaging the territory of Athens with an army while blockading them by sea. In this campaign he also destroyed the grove and temple of Poseidon that stood at the entrance to Attica near the border with Megara. To support the Athenians and prevent the power of Antigonus from growing too much, Ptolemy II Philadelphus, the king of Egypt, sent a fleet to break the blockade. The Egyptian admiral, Patroclus, landed on a small uninhabited island near Laurium and fortified it as a base for naval operations.

The Seleucid Empire had signed a peace treaty with Egypt, but Antiochus&#x27;s son-in-law, Magas, king of Cyrene, persuaded Antiochus to take advantage of the war in Greece to attack Egypt. To counter this, Ptolemy dispatched a force of pirates and freebooters to raid and attack the lands and provinces of Antiochus, while his army fought a defensive campaign, holding back the stronger Seleucid army. Although successfully defending Egypt, Ptolemy II was unable to save Athens from Antigonus. In 263/2 or 262/1 BC, the Athenians and Spartans, worn down by several years of war and the devastation of their lands, made peace with Antigonus, who thus retained his hold on Greece.

Ptolemy II continued to interfere in the affairs of Greece and this led to war in 261. After two years in which little changed, Antiochus II Theos, the new Seleucid king, made a military agreement with Antigonus, and the Second Syrian War began. Under the combined attack, Egypt lost ground in Anatolia and Phoenicia, and the city of Miletus, held by its ally, Timarchus, was seized by Antiochus II. In 255 BC, Ptolemy made peace, ceding lands to the Seleucids and confirming Antigonus in his mastery of Greece.

Two years later, however, the Egyptian interfered again, inducing with his subsidies the Macedonian governor of Corinth and Euboea, Alexander, son of Craterus, to challenge his king, seeking independence as a tyrant. Alexander&#x27;s revolt was
the most serious threat to the Macedonian hegemony in Greece, and since Antigonus&#x27; military efforts were unsuccessful, he probably resolved to poison the traitor in 247 BC. By offering a marriage with his heir Demetrius II Aetolicus Antigonus took in his widow Nicaea and regained control of Corinth in the winter of 245/44 BC.

=== Antigonus against Aratus ===

Having successfully repelled the external threat to his control of Greece, the main danger to the power of Antigonus lay in the Greek love of liberty. In 251 BC, Aratus, a young nobleman in the city of Sicyon, expelled the tyrant Nicocles, who had ruled with the acquiescence of Antigonus, freed the people, and recalled the exiles. This led to confusion and division within the city. Fearing that Antigonus would exploit these divisions to attack the city, Aratus applied for the city to join the Achaean League, a league of a few small Achaean towns in the Peloponnese.

Preferring to use guile rather than military power, Antigonus sought to regain control over Sicyon through winning the young man over to his side. Accordingly, he sent him a gift of 25 talents, but, Aratus, instead of being corrupted by this wealth, immediately gave it away to his fellow citizens. With this money and another sum he received from Ptolemy II Philadelphus, he was able to reconcile the different parties in Sicyon and unite the city.

Antigonus was troubled by the rising power and popularity of Aratus. If he were to receive extensive military and financial support from Ptolemy, Aratus would be able to threaten his position. He decided therefore to either win him over to his side or at least discredit him with Ptolemy. In order to do this, he showed him great marks of favour. When he was sacrificing to the gods in Corinth, he sent portions of the meat to Aratus at Sicyon, and complimented Aratus in front of his guests: &quot;I thought this Sicyonian youth was only a lover of liberty and of his fellow-citizens, but now I look upon him as a good judge of the manners and actions of kings. For formerly he despised us, and, placing his hopes further off, admired the Egyptians, hearing much of their elephants, fleets, and palaces. But after seeing all these at a nearer distance, and perceiving them to be but mere stage props and pageantry, he has now come over to us. And for my part I willingly receive him, and, resolving to make great use of him myself, command you to look upon him as a friend.&quot; These words were readily believed by many, and when they were reported to Ptolemy, he half believed them.

But Aratus was far from becoming a friend of Antigonus, whom he regarded as the oppressor of his city&#x27;s freedom. In 243 BC, in an attack by night, he seized the Acrocorinth, the strategically important fort by which Antigonus controlled the Isthmus of Corinth and thus the Peloponnese. When news of this success reached Corinth, the Corinthians rose in rebellion, overthrew Antigonus&#x27; party, and joined the Achaean League. Next Aratus took the port of Lechaeum and captured 25 of Antigonus&#x27;s ships.

This setback for Antigonus sparked a general uprising against Macedonian power. The Megarians revolted and together with the Troezenians and Epidaurians enrolled in the Achaean League. With this increased strength, Aratus invaded the territory of Athens and plundered Salamis. Every Athenian freeman he captured was sent back to the Athenians without ransom to encourage them to join the rebellion. The Macedonians, however, retained their hold on Athens and the rest of Greece.

==Relationship with philosophers==
Antigonus surrounded himself at court with a circle of notable intellectuals and philosophers. He was mentioned several times by Diogenes Laertius in &quot;The Lives and Opinions of Eminent Philosophers&quot;, in relation to various philosophers, particularly those linked with the Megarian, Pyrrhonist, Cynic, and Stoic schools. We&#x27;re told that &quot;many persons courted Antigonus and went to meet him whenever he came to Athens&quot; and that after an unnamed sea battle, many Athenians went to see Antigonus or wrote him flattering letters.

The Megarian philosopher Euphantus taught Antigonus &quot;and dedicated to him a work &quot;On Kingship&quot; which was very popular&quot;. We&#x27;re also told that Antigonus consulted Menedemus of Eretria, a distinguished member of Phaedo&#x27;s school of philosophy, about whether to attend a drinking party. Antigonus also knew the Pyrrhonist philosopher Timon of Phlius. Menedemus and Timon had both previously studied with the Megarian school. When the eclectic philosopher Bion of Borysthenes, who was best known as resembling the Cynics, fell ill, Antigonus sent two servants to act as nurses to him, and Antigonus himself reputedly later visited him.

Ultimately, though, Antigonus became most associated with the Stoics. Zeno of Citium studied under both the Megarians and Cynics before founding the Stoic school and he became particularly associated with Antigonus. We&#x27;re told &quot;Antigonus (Gonatas) also favoured him [Zeno], and whenever he came to Athens would hear him lecture and often invited him to come to his court.&quot;. Diogenes Laertius reproduces a brief series of letters between Zeno and Antigonus, in which he asked the Stoic to attend his court and help guide him in virtue, for the benefit of the Macedonian people. Zeno at this time was too sickly and frail to travel so instead he sent two of his best students Persaeus and Philonides the Theban, who subsequently lived with Antigonus.

While Persaeus was at Antigonus&#x27; court, Antigonus once, wishing to make trial of him, caused some false news to be brought to him that his estate had been ravaged by the enemy, and as his countenance fell, &quot;Do you see,&quot; said he, &quot;that wealth is not a matter of indifference?&quot; Persaeus subsequently became an important figure at the Macedonian court. After Antigonus captured Corinth around 244 BC, he put Persaeus in control of the city as Archon. Persaeus died in 243 BC defending the city against the attack led by Aratus of Sicyon.

After Zeno&#x27;s death, Antigonus reputedly exclaimed &quot;What an audience I have lost!&quot;. Antigonus subsequently made a gift of three thousand drachmas to Cleanthes, Zeno&#x27;s successor as head of the Stoa, whose lectures he also attended. The poet Aratus, who had also studied Stoicism under Zeno, lived at the court of Antigonus.

==Relations with India==
Antigonus is mentioned in the Edicts of Ashoka as one of the recipients of the Indian Emperor Ashoka&#x27;s Buddhist proselytism.

==Death and appraisal==
In 239 BC, Antigonus died at the age of 80 and left his kingdom to his son Demetrius II, who was to reign for the next 10 years. Except for a short period when he defeated the Gauls, Antigonus was not a heroic or successful military leader. His skills were mainly political. He preferred to rely on cunning, patience, and persistence to achieve his goals. While more brilliant leaders, like his father Demetrius and his neighbour Pyrrhus, aimed higher and fell lower, Antigonus achieved a measure of security. It is also said of him that he gained the affection of his subjects by his honesty and his cultivation of the arts, which he accomplished by gathering round him distinguished literary men, in particular philosophers, poets, and historians. A tomb in Vergina is suggested to be his own.

==Reception==
The life of Antigonus is the basis of the story line of the libretto &quot;Antigono&quot; by Pietro Metastasio, first set to music by Johann Adolph Hasse in 1744. As with most of Metastasio&#x27;s librettos, &quot;Antigono&quot; was set by a number of other 18th-century composers, among them the Bohemians Christoph Willibald Gluck in 1756 and Josef Mysliveček in 1780.

<doc id="249553" wikidata="Q1638759" url="?curid=249553" title="Four Hitokiri of the Bakumatsu">
<text>The was a term given to four samurai during the Bakumatsu era in Japanese history. The four men were Kawakami Gensai, Kirino Toshiaki (also known as Nakamura Hanjirō), Tanaka Shinbei, and Okada Izō. They opposed the Tokugawa shogunate (and later, supported the Meiji Emperor). These four samurai were warrior elite and widely considered undefeatable by normal people. The word &quot;hitokiri&quot; literally means &quot;manslayer&quot; or &quot;man cutter,&quot; as the kanji 人 means person, while 斬 can alternatively mean slay or cut.

==In fiction==
* &quot;Hitokiri&quot; is a 1969 film directed by Hideo Gosha and starring Shintaro Katsu as Okada Izo and Yukio Mishima as Tanaka Shinbei.
* The manga and anime series &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot; is about a former hitokiri named Himura Kenshin, who is based loosely on Kawakami Gensai. Kenshin is also known as Hitokiri Battosai (人斬り抜刀斎), or &quot;Sword-drawing Manslayer&quot;.
* Hideaki Sorachi&#x27;s manga &quot;Gintama&quot; involves fictionalized versions of two of the four &quot;hitokiri&quot; (particularly Okada and Kawakami), set in an alternate version of Bakumatsu-era Japan.
* The Hitokiri is a playable character in the video game &quot;For Honor&quot;, serving as a heavy hero of the Samurai faction and fighting with a two-handed axe.
* The 2014 video game &quot;Ryū ga Gotoku Ishin!&quot; features Okada Izo as one of the main antagonists. The 2023 remake version, &quot;Like a Dragon: Ishin!&quot;, also features Kawakami Gensai, Tanaka Shinbei and Nakamura Hanjiro as minor antagonists appearing in side missions.

<text>James Norwich Arbuthnot, Baron Arbuthnot of Edrom, (born 4 August 1952), is a British Conservative Party politician. He was Member of Parliament (MP) for Wanstead and Woodford from 1987 to 1997, and then MP for North East Hampshire from 1997 to 2015.

Arbuthnot served as chairman of the Defence Select Committee from 2005 to 2014, before being nominated as a life peer in the Dissolution Peerages List 2015 of August 2015. Created Baron Arbuthnot of Edrom, of Edrom in the County of Berwick, on 1 October 2015, he sits on the Conservative benches in the House of Lords.

==Early life==

Arbuthnot was born at Deal, Kent, the second son of Sir John Arbuthnot, 1st Baronet, MP for Dover between 1950 and 1964, and Margaret Jean Duff. He was educated at Wellesley House School in Broadstairs and Eton College, where he was captain of School, before going up to Trinity College, Cambridge, where he graduated with a degree in Law (BA) in 1974.

Arbuthnot was called to the Bar at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in 1975 and became a practising barrister. An active member of the Chelsea Conservative Association, he was elected a councillor of the Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea in 1978, and remained a councillor until he was elected to the House of Commons in 1987. In 1980 he became the vice-chairman of the Chelsea Conservative Association.

Arbuthnot contested the Cynon Valley seat, in the Labour heartland of industrial South Wales, at the 1983 general election and was defeated by Ioan Evans. A year later in 1984, Evans died and Arbuthnot fought the resulting by-election, but he was again defeated by the Labour candidate, Ann Clwyd.

==Member of Parliament==

===In Government (1988–1997)===
In the 1987 general election, Arbuthnot was selected to contest the safe Conservative seat of Wanstead and Woodford, as the sitting MP, Patrick Jenkin, was standing down. Arbuthnot won the seat and increased the Conservative majority by over 2,000 to 16,412.

In 1988 he became the Parliamentary Private Secretary (PPS) to Archie Hamilton at the Ministry of Defence, and in 1990 became the PPS to the Secretary of State for Trade and Industry, Peter Lilley. He entered the John Major government after the 1992 general election when he was made an Assistant Government Whip. He was promoted in 1994 as the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State at the Department of Social Security. The following year he was promoted to Minister for Defence Procurement, where he remained until the end of the Major government in 1997.

Arbuthnot stated that one of his most pleasing parliamentary achievements was &quot;organising an all-party meeting with the Prime Minister for the exoneration of the pilots of the Chinook that crashed on the Mull of Kintyre in 1994&quot;.

===In Opposition (1997–2010)===
Arbuthnot&#x27;s seat of Wanstead and Woodford was abolished at the 1997 general election, when he was selected for the new seat of North East Hampshire. In Opposition, he was a member of William Hague&#x27;s Shadow Cabinet as the Conservative Party&#x27;s Chief Whip until the 2001 general election when he returned to the backbenches. He was sworn of the Privy Council in 1998.

Arbuthnot returned to the Shadow Cabinet under Michael Howard as Shadow Trade Secretary in 2003, but stood down after the 2005 general election. Since that election he served as the chairman of the influential Defence Select Committee and was Chair of the Special Select Committee set up to scrutinise the Bill that became the Armed Forces Act 2011. He is a Senior Associate Fellow of the Royal United Services Institute.

Arbuthnot was the parliamentary chairman of the Conservative Friends of Israel. He was also a member of the Top Level Group of UK Parliamentarians for Multilateral Nuclear Disarmament and Non-proliferation, established in October 2009.

In the 2009 expenses scandal, Arbuthnot apologised and repaid the public money he had claimed for his swimming pool to be cleaned. Later that year, he was further criticised in the press for £15,000 of expenses he claimed for upkeep at his second home, including tree surgery and painting his summer house.

===In Government (2010–2015)===
In June 2011, Arbuthnot announced that he would not contest the next general election. On 16 January 2015, he publicly declared his atheism, stating &quot;the pressure on a Conservative politician, particularly of keeping quiet about not being religious, is very similar to the pressure that there has been about keeping quiet about being gay&quot;; he later clarified that he is not gay.

Arbuthnot has played a pivotal role in helping the subpostmasters affected by the British Post Office scandal to seek justice after the Post Office wronglyand, it has been alleged, knowinglysought and obtained convictions for theft, fraud and false accounting against a large number of them. In September 2023, he supported the £600,000 &quot;take it or leave it&quot; Government compensation for those wrongly convicted saying on &quot;The World Tonight&quot; on BBC Radio 4, it was &quot;a choice&quot;, and that &quot;for some it will be a good way of putting this behind them and getting on with their lives&quot;. Arbuthnot was portrayed by Alex Jennings in &quot;Mr Bates vs The Post Office&quot;, an ITV dramatisation of the scandal.

==Personal life==
On 6 September 1984, Arbuthnot married Emma Louise Broadbent, daughter of Michael Broadbent, Wine Director of Christie&#x27;s. Since 2020 she has been a High Court judge, having previously served as the Senior District Judge (Chief Magistrate) for England and Wales.

Arbuthnot is the chairman of the advisory board of the UK division of multinational defence and security systems manufacturer Thales. He is a Senior Associate Fellow of the defence and security think tank Royal United Services Institute for Defence and Security Studies.

He is a descendant of James V of Scotland. His middle name is after his great-great-grandfather, Norwich Duff (1792–1862). He is also a distant cousin of Gerald Arbuthnot, the former MP for Burnley.

The Arbuthnots have four children.

<doc id="249564" wikidata="Q3068100" url="?curid=249564" title="Probainognathidae">
<text>Probainognathidae is an extinct family of insectivorous cynodonts which lived in what is now South America during the Middle to Late Triassic. The family was established by Alfred Romer in 1973 and includes two genera, &quot;Probainognathus&quot; from the Chañares Formation of Argentina and &quot;Bonacynodon&quot; from the &quot;Dinodontosaurus&quot; Assemblage Zone of Brazil. Probainognathids were closely related to the clade Prozostrodontia, which includes mammals and their close relatives.

== Description ==
Members of Probainognathidae were relatively small-bodied animals, with skull lengths of around . The temporal region (area behind the eye sockets) was rather wide, and longer than the snout. The secondary palate was well-developed compared to earlier cynodonts, and the portion made up by the maxilla was larger than the part made from the palatine bone. The dentary, the tooth-bearing bone of the lower jaw, was quite tall when seen from the side. The mandibular symphysis (the joint between the two halves of the dentary) was fused in &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, but unfused in &quot;Bonacynodon&quot;. In addition to the ancestral quadrate-articular jaw joint found in most non-mammalian cynodonts, probainognathids also had an incipient contact between the squamosal and surangular bones. The canine teeth were large and labio-lingually compressed, and in &quot;Bonacynodon&quot; they bore a serrated edge. The postcanines had a typical &quot;triconodont&quot; shape, with four main cusps placed in a straight line. Unlike in other basal probainognathians like &quot;Chiniquodon&quot;, the cusps were not recurved. The lower postcanines bore a discontinuous cingulum which was restricted to the mesiolingual and distolingual sides of the teeth. The shape of the postcanines indicates that probainognathids most likely were insectivorous.

Based on the shape of the maxillary canal, a 2020 paper by Benoit &quot;et al.&quot; suggested that &quot;Probainognathus&quot; was among the first cynodonts to possess a mobile rhinarium with whiskers.

== Classification ==
Probainognathidae was erected in a 1973 paper by the American palaeontologist Alfred Romer to contain &quot;Probainognathus&quot;, a cynodont from the Carnian-aged Chañares Formation of Argentina, which Romer had removed from the family Chiniquodontidae. The family remained monotypic for a long time, until the genus &quot;Bonacynodon&quot;, from the Ladinian-early Carnian &quot;Dinodontosaurus&quot; Assemblage Zone of Brazil, was named in a 2016 paper by Martinelli &quot;et al.&quot; This paper also provided a phylogenetic definition of Probainognathidae, as &quot;the clade including the most recent common ancestor of &quot;Probainognathus jenseni&quot; and &quot;Bonacynodon schultzi&quot;, and all its descendants&quot;.

Phylogenetic analyses have generally found probainognathids to be relatively early-diverging members of Probainognathia, a clade that includes all cynodonts closer to mammals than to Cynognathia. The exact placement of probainognathids relative to other basal probainognathians varies between analyses. Some analyses find probainognathids to be very close relatives of Prozostrodontia, a group of advanced probainognathians that includes mammals and their close relatives. Some analyses alternatively find Ecteniniidae, a group of large predatory cynodonts, to be closer to prozostrodontians than the probainognathids.

<text>Dezső Lauber (23 May 1879 – 5 September 1966) was a Hungarian all-round sportsman and architect. He was born in Pécs and died in Budapest.

== Career ==
Lauber was an all-round champion athlete in the late 19th and early 20th century, competing in (among others) bobsleigh, ice skating, golf, cycling, and tennis. In that last sport, he competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics in London but lost his first match and was eliminated.

He was an architect by profession and a close associate of 1896 Olympic swimming champion Alfréd Hajós. Together with Hajós, he entered a design for a stadium in the art competitions held during the 1924 Summer Olympics. The jury did not award a gold medal in this competition, but Hajós and Lauber received a silver medal for their design.

Lauber was also secretary of the Hungarian Olympic Committee.

<text>Portland Admiralty Roach is a kind of stone from the Isle of Portland used to construct &quot;The Cobb&quot;, the well-known seawall at Lyme Regis in Dorset.
The stone is rich in fossils (known as shells to local masons) often consisting of almost fifty percent fossilized remains with an average size of approximately 35 mm. The stone, which was quarried by Albion Stone, has a maximum bed height of 2 metres. The stone is renowned for being highly frost resistant and being able to withstand the chemical effects of seawater.
The stone is an open textured oolitic limestone from the Portlandian formation formed during the Tithonian age, (152.1 ± 4 Ma to 145.0 ± 4 Ma (million years ago)) of the Late Jurassic epoch. It is formed from ooliths in a micrite (fine grained calcium carbonate) matrix. There are many voids in the stone, caused by percolating rainwater dissolving all or parts of its many shell fossils, mainly bivalves and gastropods.

<doc id="249583" wikidata="Q2935976" url="?curid=249583" title="Basingstoke Canal">
<text>The Basingstoke Canal is an English canal, completed in 1794, built to connect Basingstoke with the River Thames at Weybridge via the Wey Navigation.

From Basingstoke, the canal passes through or near Greywell, North Warnborough, Odiham, Dogmersfield, Fleet, Farnborough Airfield, Aldershot, Mytchett, Brookwood, Knaphill and Woking. Its eastern end is at Byfleet, where it connects to the Wey Navigation. This, in turn, leads to the River Thames at Weybridge. Its intended purpose was to allow boats to travel from the docks in East London to Basingstoke.

It was never a commercial success and, starting in 1950, a lack of maintenance allowed the canal to become increasingly derelict. After many years of neglect, restoration commenced in 1977 and on 10 May 1991 the canal was reopened as a fully navigable waterway from the River Wey to almost as far as the Greywell Tunnel. However its usage is currently still limited by low water supply and conservation issues.

==History==


The canal was originally conceived as a way to stimulate agricultural development in Hampshire. It was authorised by the (18 Geo. 3. c. 75), the company being allowed to raise () by issuing shares, and an additional () if required.

The original proposed route was about long, running from Basingstoke to join the Wey and Godalming Navigations near Weybridge, with a large loop running to the north to pass around Greywell Hill. The loop cut through the grounds of Tylney Hall, owned by Earl Tylney, and he objected to the route. Due to this objection, difficulties in raising capital funding, and the American Revolutionary War being in progress, no construction took place for some time.

Nearly ten years later, a favourable forecast of expected traffic was published in 1787, and the canal committee took action. John Smeaton was appointed engineer, together with Benjamin Henry Latrobe, and William Jessop was appointed as assistant engineer and made a survey. To avoid Tylney Hall the route was changed, with the original long contour-following route which had been surveyed around Greywell Hill being replaced by a tunnel through it, shortening the canal by nearly .

The contract for construction was awarded to John Pinkerton, part of a family of contractors who had often worked with Jessop, in August 1788. Construction started in October 1788.

The construction of Greywell Tunnel had been initially subcontracted to Charles Jones, although he had been dismissed by the Thames and Severn Canal company in 1788 after failing to complete the Sapperton Tunnel project, not entirely at his own fault. Jones was again dismissed in 1789 after the quality of the tunnel work was criticised.

The canal was opened on 4 September 1794, but two sections of the bank collapsed shortly afterwards, and parts of it were closed until the summer of 1795.

One of the main cargoes carried from Basingstoke was timber, along with agricultural products destined for London. A significant amount of traffic took place in the 1850s, carrying materials for the building of Aldershot Garrison, but this ended within a few years. The Up Nately brickworks, to which a long arm of the canal was built for access, opened in 1898 and in the following year produced 2 million bricks which were mostly transported on the canal. However, there were problems with the quality of the bricks and the brickworks went into liquidation in 1901 and closed in 1908.

Otherwise, trade on the canal was never as intensive as had been predicted, and several companies attempted to run it, but each ended up bankrupt. The canal had started to fall into disuse even before the construction of the London and South Western Railway, which runs parallel to the canal along much of its length. In 1831, when plans for the railway were being developed, the canal company suggested instead that a link be built between the canal and the Itchen Navigation. The suggestion was rejected and the canal company agreed not to oppose the construction of the railway. Commercial traffic on the canal mostly ended in 1910, although a low level of use would continue until the last cargo of timber to Woking in 1949.

In the winter of 1913, Alec (&quot;A J&quot;) Harmsworth attempted to navigate the canal in the narrowboat &quot;Basingstoke&quot;, carrying a cargo of sand. The intention of this trip was to prove, at the request of the then owner of the canal, that it was still navigable and so avoid the possibility of closure under the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854. Under that act, if the canal were not used for five years then the land the canal was built on could be returned to the original owners.

It turned out not to be possible to navigate the entire length of the canal, but the boat did successfully pass through the Greywell Tunnel and was left at Basing Wharf over Christmas 1913. In January 1914 the boat finally reached Basing House where it was turned and returned to Basing Wharf to unload its cargo. Although it proved to be not possible to reach the end of the canal at Basingstoke Wharf, a legal appeal taking place at the same time established that the canal was private freehold property and therefore not subject to the Railway and Canal Traffic Act 1854. The &quot;Basingstoke&quot; returned to its base at Ash Wharf, the last successful boat passage through the tunnel.

During World War I the Royal Engineers took over the running of the canal and used it to transport supplies from Woolwich to the barracks at Aldershot, Crookham and Deepcut. The canal was also used to train soldiers in boat handling.

Harmsworth, the last trader working on the canal, purchased the canal in 1923, but only used the lower section (from the Wey as far as Woking) for limited commercial carrying and pleasure cruising. After part of the Greywell Tunnel collapsed in 1932, the canal to the west of that, including Basingstoke Wharf, was sold.

The canal was not nationalised when the British Transport Commission was formed by the Transport Act 1947. After Harmsworth&#x27;s death in the same year the canal was offered for sale again, and some interested enthusiasts and Inland Waterways Association members attempted to form a &quot;Basingstoke Canal Committee&quot;. At the auction in 1949 they were under the impression that Joan Marshall of Fleet, who had offered to bid on their behalf, had secured the canal for them. However, it turned out that she had instead bought the canal for () on behalf of the &quot;New Basingstoke Canal Company&quot;, with the purchase having been financed by Mr S. E. Cooke, inventor of the Duracast fishing reel.

This company (with Cooke as Managing Director and Joan Marshall as General Manager) attempted to continue maintaining the canal, including keeping the locks in working order. They tried to raise extra income from fishing and houseboat moorings as well as water supply. Unfortunately there was serious damage to Lock 22 in 1957, when some troops blew up the lock and drained the pound above, and a major breach above Ash Lock caused by flooding in 1968. By the late 1960s the canal was essentially derelict, despite volunteer efforts to improve the situation.

==Restoration==

In 1966 the &quot;Surrey and Hampshire Canal Society&quot; (now renamed the &quot;Basingstoke Canal Society&quot;) was formed by a group of local enthusiasts, with a view to reopening the derelict canal. They particularly campaigned to oppose proposals from the canal company in 1967 which would have retained only those sections of the canal useful for amenity and conservation purposes, culverting the water between them so that the land could be used for development. This would therefore have ended any possibility of through
navigation.

As a result of their campaigning, Surrey and Hampshire county councils began negotiations in 1970 to purchase the canal. However, those negotiations initially broke down which resulted in both of them announcing in February 1972 that they would apply to take over the canal via compulsory purchase orders. The orders were confirmed
in February 1975 but did not need to be used, as Hampshire County Council had been able to take possession of their (western) part of the canal in November 1973 and Surrey County Council acquired their (eastern) part after negotiations in March 1976.

In February 1977 a job creation project started with the aim of carrying out restoration work on the Deepcut flight of locks. The work was coordinated with the work of the canal society who organised work parties at weekends while the job creation team worked on weekdays.

After about 18 years of restoration, of the canal were formally re-opened on 10 May 1991. The western section from North Warnborough to Basingstoke remains un-navigable from the point at which it enters the Greywell Tunnel. The tunnel partially collapsed in 1932 where it passes from chalk into clay geology, and is now inhabited by a protected bat colony making it unlikely that the tunnel will ever be restored. Some of the former canal basin at the western end has also been lost to modern development in and around Basingstoke.

The canal is now managed by the Basingstoke Canal Authority and is open to navigation throughout the year. Lock opening times are restricted due to the very limited water supply in an attempt to postpone summer closures which have plagued the canal since construction. Boat numbers are also limited to 1,300 per year due to the fact that most of the canal has been designated a Site of Special Scientific Interest.

==Site of Special Scientific Interest==

Two sections of the canal totalling are a Site of Special Scientific Interest and Nature Conservation Review site. These are the main length between Greywell and Brookwood Lye, and a short stretch between Monument Bridge and Scotland Bridge in Woking. It is the most botanically-rich aquatic area in England and flora include the nationally scarce hairlike pondweed and the nationally scarce tasteless water-pepper. The site is also nationally important for its invertebrates. There are 24 species of dragonfly and other species include two nationally rare Red Data Book insects.

Eastwards from the mid point of the canal, it is surrounded by large areas of heathland. These are habitats for reptilian species, such as vipers and lizards, and birds such as nightjars, woodlarks and Dartford warblers. Much of this heath survives today due to its use since the late 19th century as military training areas.

==Lost sections of the canal==
The canal originally started from the centre of Basingstoke, but the first of route have now been lost. This section of the canal fell into disuse after the closure of the Greywell Tunnel, due to a lack of boat traffic, general neglect and a lack of water.

There were no locks on the canal after Ash, so the route generally followed the contours of the land with occasional cuttings, tunnels and embankments. The route can be partly determined by noting that the canal falls between the 75m and 80m contours on Ordnance Survey maps, and can be traced on historical map overlays as available at the
National Library of Scotland.

The canal started at a basin, roughly where the present day Basingstoke Bus Station is located. From there it ran eastwards parallel to the River Loddon following Eastrop Way, before passing under the A339 Ringway East. It then made a long loop southwards and then eastwards again, partly on an embankment, passing over small streams and water meadows. The furthest visible sign of the canal today is the buried Red Bridge, which can be seen where Redbridge Lane turns northwards west of the Basing House ruins.

From here the canal route passed to the north of Basing House and through Old Basing village. Some remaining cuttings, which may contain water in wet weather, can be found just off Milkingpen Lane and behind the Belle View Road/Cavalier Road estate. There was then another southwards loop, crossing the routes of the present day A30 and M3 and then across the Lyde River at Hatch. From here the canal ran eastwards across fields, on an embankment towards Mapledurwell to then cross over another branch of the Lyde River. There was a short tunnel under Andwell Drove, and then the now demolished Penny Bridge leading under Greywell Road towards Up Nately.

From this point eastwards the canal is still in water and is maintained as a nature reserve, with the towpath as a public footpath leading to the western end of the Greywell Tunnel. Footpaths over the hill lead to the eastern end of the tunnel, in the centre of Greywell village, and the towing path continues onwards to the present day limit of navigation about to the east.

The Basingstoke Canal Heritage Footpath roughly follows the canal route for
 from Festival Place to Basing House.

The main source of water for the western end of the canal appears to have been the natural springs within the Greywell Tunnel. Along the Basingstoke town section the River Loddon ran parallel with but not into the canal (the present day Eastrop Way, the former route of the canal, can be seen to be well above the river level)
and there was also no connection with the River Lyde either at Huish Farm near Hatch (the river can be seen today to flow under the former canal bed just north of the M3) or at Mapledurwell. There are, however, small streams flowing into the canal at Fleet and Aldershot.

In order to alleviate the lack of water in the western part of the canal, a stop lock was built just to the east of the Greywell Tunnel to raise the water level by about . However this was a long section of canal with many embankments and it is likely that this was a cheap short term measure, instead of improving the water supply or properly fixing leaks.

==Plans==
There have been proposals to reconnect Basingstoke with the surviving section of the canal several times in the past, and this remains a long term aim of the Basingstoke Canal Society.
However, the bat population now established in the Greywell Tunnel makes it unlikely that the tunnel will ever be able to be reopened.

Another possible idea that has been considered in the past, and is still a long term ambition today, is to connect the remaining canal to the Kennet and Avon Navigation
via a new Berks and Hants Canal. This link was proposed three times between 1793 and 1810, and a route was even surveyed by John Rennie in 1824, but following opposition from landowners was eventually rejected by Parliament in 1824 and 1826.
This route would allow the tunnel to remain undisturbed.

==The Basingstoke Canal Authority==

The canal is owned by both Hampshire County Council and Surrey County Council, with each authority owning the land within their jurisdiction. Until 1990, the two councils managed their own sections separately. It was decided that a central body should manage the entire waterway and the Basingstoke Canal Authority was formed.

In 1993, the canal visitor centre at Mytchett was opened which now also acts as the central offices of the canal authority.

The canal authority staff are employed, administered and supported by Hampshire County Council; however, the centre belongs to Surrey County Council. Each county council allocates revenue money to the canal authority, as well as the six riparian district/borough authorities through which the canal passes. The canal authority partnership is governed by the Basingstoke Canal Joint Management Committee – a joint committee of Surrey County Council formed of council members from each of the local authority partners.

The structure of the canal authority was last reviewed in 2011, with the two county councils allocating client officers from their Countryside teams to lead the strategic direction for the canal, taking on part of the former Canal Director&#x27;s role. The canal authority is now formed of one canal manager, a senior administration officer and assistant, visitor services manager and visitor services officer. The canal is maintained by a team of five canal rangers and one senior ranger, supported by a part-time seasonal lock keeper.

==Architectural features==

A notable feature of the canal is the large number of concrete bunkers known as pillboxes still visible along its length; these were built during World War II as part of the GHQ Line to defend against an expected German invasion.

Odiham Castle is situated at the Greywell (Basingstoke) end of the canal. The canal runs through part of the castle&#x27;s bailey.

The Greywell Tunnel (now disused), at long, was the 12th longest canal tunnel in Great Britain.

<doc id="249584" wikidata="Q4908061" url="?curid=249584" title="Bill Bauer (poet)">
<text>William Alfred Bauer (May 10, 1932 - June 12, 2010) was an American-Canadian writer. Born in Portland, Maine and raised in Auburn, Bauer was educated at Amherst College, Wesleyan University and the University of North Carolina. He married writer Nancy Bauer in 1956, and they had three children: Ernie, Grace and John. In 1965 he moved to New Brunswick to accept a professorship at the University of New Brunswick, and five years later he completed his PhD dissertation (University of North Carolina) on 18th-century letter-writing. 

==Career==
For many years Bauer was a regular member of the Ice House (a.k.a. McCord Hall, or Tuesday Night) community writers&#x27; workshop, and he served as both poetry and fiction editor at various times for &quot;The Fiddlehead&quot;, as well as writing many reviews for the magazine. Before his retirement in 1994, he taught courses in 18th-Century British Literature, Shakespeare, Canadian literature, Maritime literature and Creative Writing. His byline names included W. A. Bauer, William A. Bauer, William Bauer, and Bill Bauer. He published several chapbooks and collections of poetry, including &quot;Cornet Music for Plupy Shute&quot; (1968), &quot;Everett Coogler&quot; (1971), &quot;The Terrible Word&quot; (1978) and &quot;Unsnarling String&quot; (1983), as well as a short-story collection, &quot;Family Album&quot; (1979).

“…. a poet who can get his wild sense of humour into poems that are linguistically subtle and open in form. Bauer cares about language, and loves it. The comedy is his way of exploring the large questions of life as process rather than stasis. &quot;The Terrible Word&quot; is both damn good and damn entertaining.”—Douglas Barbour, &quot;The Dalhousie Review&quot;

“A gentleman—rather than a vulgarian—satirist, Bauer does not often find vice in his fellow man, but perhaps that is so because the people in his poems are liable to be more confused than destructive…. But laugher almost always wins out over despair.”—Michael Brian Oliver, &quot;The Fiddlehead&quot;

“One of Bauer’s chief strengths in &quot;A Family Album&quot; is a strikingly inventive imagination. We are urged to share his delight in life’s absurdities, even while recognizing that the foibles he describes in others are too frequently our own.”—Roger MacDonald, &quot;Canadian Book Review Annual&quot;

“These stories are specific in capturing a recognizable region: the slow-paced, tradition-bound Eastern Seaboard. It is an idyllic world from certain angles and in certain seasons, but change the perspective, come two steps closer, and it darkens into a place betrayed and deserted by time…. For those interested in the art of narration, these stories are a pleasure to read. One savours the rich and varied vocabulary, and the experimentation with language and structure.”—Carrie MacMillan, &quot;Quill and Quire&quot;

“&quot;Unsnarling String&quot; combines humour and down-to-earth philosophy, commonplace experience and delightful eccentricities. Bauer writes about simple things in life that become ridiculously tangled, and about how people reduce life’s complications to simple formulas for survival….. Poems to be read aloud to family and friends.” Richard Lemm, &quot;The Atlantic Provinces Book Review&quot;

<doc id="249591" wikidata="Q7867426" url="?curid=249591" title="USS Arnold J. Isbell">
<text>USS &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; (DD-869), a , was the only ship of the United States Navy to be named for Arnold J. Isbell, an aircraft carrier captain during World War II. The ship was laid down on 14 March 1945 at Staten Island, New York, by Bethlehem Mariners Harbor, launched on 6 August 1945 and commissioned on 5 January 1946. Constructed too late to see action in World War II, the vessel initially served as a training ship with the United States Atlantic Fleet, before transferring to the Pacific and deploying to Korea during the Korean War and off the Vietnam coast during the Vietnam War. In 1972 &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; was made part of the reserve training fleet and in 1974, sold to Greece where the ship was renamed Satchouris and served with the Hellenic Navy until being sold for scrap in 2002.

==Construction and US career==
Her keel was laid down on 14 March 1945 at Staten Island, New York, by Bethlehem Mariners Harbor. She was launched on 6 August 1945 sponsored by Mrs. Arnold J. Isbell, the widow of Captain Isbell; and commissioned on 5 January 1946. She joined the Atlantic Fleet and operated off the east coast.

Following a shakedown cruise to Guantánamo Bay, Cuba, the destroyer joined the Atlantic Fleet and operated off the East Coast through the end of the year. In January 1947, she was transferred to the Pacific Fleet and homeported at San Diego, California. In May, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; departed California on her first western Pacific (WestPac) cruise. She visited Tsingtao and Shanghai, China, Hong Kong, Tokyo, and Yokosuka, Japan, Okinawa; and Apra Harbor, Guam, before returning to San Diego in December.

During 1948, the warship engaged in hunter/killer training and served as a training ship for Naval Reserve personnel. In February 1949, she sailed to Bremerton, Washington, for two months of upkeep. Following this work, she departed San Diego in April, bound for the Far East. The destroyer was in port at Shanghai and at Tsingtao, China, when each of these cities fell to Communist forces. She evacuated the American consul and his family from Tsingtao. She returned to San Diego in December.

===Korean War===
&quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; was operating out of San Diego when Communist forces invaded South Korea on 27 June 1950 and the Korean War began. She began preparations for an active role in the conflict. She joined Destroyer Division (DesDiv) 52 and sailed for Korean waters on 6 November. Some of her duties in the combat zone included acting in the screen of Task Force (TF) 77 visiting Taiwan as part of the United States Seventh Fleet, and escorting the troop transports that brought the 45th Infantry Division to Hokkaidō, Japan. In May 1951, the destroyer was reassigned to Task Force 95 and participated in the bombardment of enemy troop concentrations on highways and railroads at Songjin, Chongjin, and Wonsan before returning to San Diego in August for repairs and training exercises along the west coast.

In January 1952, the ship again got underway for Korean action. Between 19 February and 10 August, she acted as a unit of TF 77, the Seventh Fleet striking force. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; also operated with TF 95 and took part in hunter/killer operations. For a short time, she was a member of the Taiwan Strait patrol and joined the cruiser in bombarding Songjin before she returned to the United States in August. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; then began a three-month overhaul at Bremerton, Washington, in the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard.

The destroyer sailed on 21 July 1953 for more operations off the embattled Korean peninsula. Upon her arrival there, she joined TF 95 for patrols along the Korean coast. A highlight of the cruise was her escorting the battleship into Pusan harbor, where President Syngman Rhee presented the Seventh Fleet with a unit citation from the Republic of Korea. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; also served a brief stint as a training ship for the Nationalist Chinese Navy at Kaohsiung, Taiwan. Returning to the Korean coast, she acted as a rescue and communications ship at Pusan during a major fire. In January 1954, the ship and her sister members of DesDiv 112 (Destroyer Squadron 11) escorted released Nationalist Chinese prisoners of war to Keelung, Taiwan.

===Post Korean War===
February found &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; back in the United States and being overhauled by the Mare Island Naval Shipyard, Mare Island, California. Her next six and one-half months were devoted to yard work and refresher training. In September, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; returned to the Far East. She again served as a training ship for Nationalist Chinese naval forces and then steamed with the fast carrier task force in Philippine waters. The destroyer played a key role in the evacuation of the Tachen Islands in January 1955 as Nationalist forces shortened their lines of defense. She sailed from the area on 25 February for San Diego, arriving in her home port on 13 March. Following repairs and training, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; sailed on 27 September for the Far East. The destroyer visited various ports in Japan and Taiwan, and served on the Taiwan Strait patrol. During this tour, she also participated in successful search and rescue operations for a downed Navy patrol plane. Elmo Zumwalt took command of the ship in July 1955. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; concluded her duties and arrived back in San Diego on 11 March 1956.

After completing repairs at Mare Island in July, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; resumed operations with DesDiv 112 off the coast of California. On 25 September, she sailed, via Pearl Harbor, for her eighth WestPac deployment. Heading south from Hawaii the destroyer crossed the equator on 3 October, bound for Samoa. Upon leaving Pago Pago, her next stop was Wellington, New Zealand, en route to Manus in the Admiralty Islands. Following a brief visit to Guam, she finally reached Yokosuka, Japan. There, the ship joined TF 77 for operations in the area between Hong Kong and Japan. She stopped in the Philippines before returning via Midway Atoll and Pearl Harbor, to San Diego where she arrived in March 1957. The warship had a brief availability period and then took part in a fleet training exercise. She later operated with the Navy&#x27;s first nuclear-powered submarine, . &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; also visited Portland, Oregon, for that city&#x27;s Rose Festival celebration. An 18-day nonstop voyage from San Diego to Brisbane, Australia, initiated the destroyer&#x27;s ninth Far Eastern cruise. She made stops at the Admiralty Islands, Guam, the Philippines, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Okinawa, and Japan before returning to California in June 1958. The destroyer received an overhaul at Mare Island from June until September and then conducted refresher training and prepared for her 10th WestPac cruise.

&quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; got underway on 18 December for WestPac. She operated with the Taiwan Strait patrol and took part in training exercises off Guam, Taiwan, Japan, and Okinawa before returning to San Diego on 29 May 1959 for operations in the southern California area. The vessel participated in numerous fleet exercises and, from 27 June to 15 August, held a midshipman training cruise. The ship once again sailed for the Far East on 6 February 1960 and made stops at Pearl Harbor, Yokosuka, Kaohsiung, Hong Kong, and Subic Bay. At midnight on 20 April, she received orders to steam toward a sinking merchant vessel in the South China Sea. After reaching the scene of the disaster, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; was able to rescue 104 people. After delivering the survivors to Subic Bay, she proceeded to Hong Kong for three weeks as station ship at that port. A final stop at Yokosuka preceded her sailing for San Diego, where she arrived in June. The destroyer spent the next 12 months in local operations.

In June 1961, her home port was changed to Bremerton, Washington, where she entered the Puget Sound Naval Shipyard for a fleet rehabilitation and modernization (FRAM) overhaul. During the FRAM refit all secondary armament was removed, as well as No. 2 five-inch turret, which was replaced by two Mk32 triple torpedo tube launchers. The superstructure was extensively rebuilt of aluminum, the bridge enclosed and a new CIC (Combat Information Center) built between the pilothouse and the forward funnel. An Antisubmarine Rocket (ASROC) launcher was fitted between the funnels. A hangar and ASROC reload facility was constructed aft of the rear funnel.

&quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; emerged from the yard with her new configuration on 4 May 1962. On 7 June, she reported to her new home port of Long Beach, California, and commenced refresher training. In October, the ship sailed with Destroyer Squadron 11 for the Far East. During this deployment, she took part in Operation &quot;Red Wheel,&quot; &quot;Glass Door,&quot; and &quot;Sea Serpent.&quot; The destroyer also served as a unit of the Seventh Fleet hunter/killer groups. Upon returning to Long Beach in June 1963, she participated in another fleet exercise, Operation &quot;Saddle Soap&quot;. In January 1964, the warship left Long Beach for her 12th tour in Far Eastern waters. During this deployment, she operated with a carrier force and later joined the Taiwan Strait patrol. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; visited Pearl Harbor, Subic Bay, Philippines, Hong Kong; and Sasebo, Japan, before returning to Long Beach in May. She began a regular overhaul at the Long Beach Naval Shipyard in August. Upon completing her yard work in November, the destroyer proceeded to San Diego for six weeks of extensive underway training. Shortly after finishing her underway training, the ship took part in Operation &quot;Silverlance.&quot; In March 1965, she received a drone antisubmarine helicopter (DASH) system and held trials of her new equipment off San Clemente Island. A midshipman training cruise occupied a large part of her summer. The destroyer sailed on 19 October for the Western Pacific. Following stops at Pearl Harbor and Subic Bay, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; relieved the destroyer on 30 December on the northern search and rescue (SAR) station in the Gulf of Tonkin and began her first duty in the combat zone off the coast of Vietnam. The warship then became a unit of TF 77.

Search and rescue duties occupied the vessel until she was relieved on 31 March 1966 and sailed to Hong Kong for four days of rest and relaxation. On 12 April, she got underway to return to the United States. After fuel stops at Midway and Pearl Harbor, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; reached Long Beach on 28 April and commenced a leave and upkeep period. She returned to sea on 11 June with a midshipman training cruise to Hawaii and several fleet exercises. The destroyer unloaded her ammunition at Seal Beach, California, on 29 July and entered the Mare Island Naval Shipyard on 31 July for overhaul. Refurbished, the ship began a training period on 16 September and spent the remainder of the year in exercises along the southern California coast and in upkeep during the Christmas holidays. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; held refresher training out of San Diego in March 1968 and then conducted local operations until getting underway for the western Pacific on 15 July. She arrived on station off the Vietnamese coast on 12 August and carried out duties as a gunfire support ship. Her routine was broken only by brief periods in port for repairs and liberty for the crew. The destroyer spent the Christmas holidays patrolling off Vietnam and then visited Subic Bay, and Yokosuka.

On 20 January, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; headed home. Upon her arrival at Long Beach on 31 January, she commenced a three-month period of leave and availability. She got underway again on 21 April for brief cruise to Acapulco and Manzanillo, Mexico, but was back in home port on 5 May. The vessel joined Task Group 10.1 on 9 June for a midshipman training cruise. Ports visited during this assignment included San Francisco, Seattle, Washington, and Pearl Harbor. This cruise terminated on 31 July, and she returned to Long Beach. A tender availability alongside the destroyer tender ensued, and the destroyer then took part in Exercise &quot;Bell Express&quot; from 16 to 22 September. Her next underway period lasted from 17 September to 21 November while she took part in Computex 31–69. She was also involved in gunfire support, antisubmarine warfare, and electronic warfare exercises before ending the year 1969 in port at Long Beach.

===Vietnam War===
The destroyer sailed on 13 February 1970 for the Far East. While in the combat zone, she performed SAR duty on Yankee Station in the Gulf of Tonkin, provided gunfire support, and served as escort for five aircraft carriers. She made four port calls to Subic Bay, visited Hong Kong for two weeks, and spent four days in Singapore. En route back to the United States, the ship paid goodwill visits to Sydney, Australia, and Auckland, New Zealand. A one-day stopover at Pago Pago was also included in the voyage to Pearl Harbor. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; finally arrived in home port on 29 August and spent the rest of 1970 in local operations out of Long Beach. From February to May 1971, &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; went through an extensive yard period in the Long Beach Naval Shipyard. Six weeks of rigorous refresher training followed, and, on 9 September, she began what proved to be her final WestPac deployment. During this deployment, the vessel acted as a carrier escort and a naval gunfire support ship in Vietnamese waters. The destroyer also paid a visit to Devonport, Tasmania. On 7 April 1972, she dropped anchor at San Diego.

Then preparations to place the destroyer in the reserve training fleet were carried out. &quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; began her training duties on 16 June by sailing for Hawaii. She returned to California on 17 July and began operations off the West Coast. A trip to Mazatlán, Mexico varied her routine in early November.

==Greek service==

In 1972 &quot;Isbell&quot; became part of the Reserve Training Fleet until early 1974 when she was decommissioned and struck from the Naval Vessel Register. She was then transferred to the government of Greece and entered the Greek Navy as &quot;Sachtouris&quot; (D214). She continued serving Greece into the 1980s and was reportedly scrapped in Turkey in 2002.

==Awards and honors==
&quot;Arnold J. Isbell&quot; made 16 tours of the Far East and earned six battle stars for Korean War service and two for Vietnam War action.

<text>Portland stone is a limestone geological formation (formally named the Portland Stone Formation) dating to the Tithonian age of the Late Jurassic that is quarried on the Isle of Portland in Dorset, England. The quarries are cut in beds of white-grey limestone separated by chert beds. It has been used extensively as a building stone throughout the British Isles, notably in major public buildings in London such as St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and Buckingham Palace. Portland stone is also exported to many countries, being used for example at the United Nations headquarters in New York City.

==Geology==
Portland stone formed in a marine environment, on the floor of a shallow, warm, sub-tropical sea probably near land (as evidenced by fossilised driftwood, which is not uncommon). When seawater is warmed by the sun, its capacity to hold dissolved gas is reduced; consequently, dissolved carbon dioxide (CO2) is released into the atmosphere as a gas. Calcium and bicarbonate ions within the water are then able to combine, to form calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as a precipitate. The process of limescale build up in a kettle in hard-water areas is similar. Calcium carbonate is the principal constituent of most limestones. Billions of minute crystals of precipitated calcium carbonate (called calcite) accumulated forming lime mud (called micrite) which covered the sea floor. Small particles of sand or organic detritus, such as shell fragments, formed a nucleus, which became coated with layers of calcite as they were rolled around in the muddy micrite. Portland stone measures 3.5 on the Mohs scale of mineral hardness.

The calcite gradually accumulated (by accretion) around the fragments of shell in concentric layers, forming small balls (of less than 0.5 mm diameter). This process is similar to the way in which a snowball grows in size as it is rolled around in the snow. Over time, countless billions of these balls, known as &quot;ooids&quot; or &quot;ooliths&quot; (from the Greek for &quot;egg-shaped&quot; or &quot;egg-stone&quot;), became partially cemented together (or lithified) by more calcite, to form the oolitic limestone that is called Portland stone. The degree of cementation in Portland stone is such that the stone is sufficiently well cemented to allow it to resist weathering, but not so well cemented that it cannot be readily worked (cut and carved) by masons. This is one of the reasons why Portland stone is so favoured as a monumental and architectural stone. Geoff Townson conducted three years doctoral research on the Portlandian, being the first to describe the patch-reef facies and Dorset-wide sedimentation details. Ian West of the School of Ocean and Earth Sciences at Southampton University completed a detailed geological survey of Withies Croft Quarry before the Portland Beds were quarried by Albion Stone plc.

==History of use==
Stone has been quarried on Portland since Roman times and was being shipped to London in the 14th century. Extraction as an industry began in the early 17th century, with shipments to London for Inigo Jones&#x27; Banqueting House. Wren&#x27;s choice of Portland for the new St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral was a great boost for the quarries and established Portland as London&#x27;s choice of building stone. The island was connected by railway to the rest of the country from 1865. Albion Stone PLC has been quarrying and mining Portland stone since 1984. Portland Stone Firms Ltd have been quarrying Portland stone since 1994.

==Quarries and mines==

Jordans is part of the Inmosthay Quarry in the centre of the island, which also includes Fancy Beach. The quarry has been worked since the late 19th century. Albion Stone leases the southern section from The Crown Estate and purchased the northern part of the site in 2006. The majority of the southern reserves lie under the grounds of the local cricket club. To avoid disturbing the site at surface level, the company has applied and received permission to extract the stone using mining rather than quarrying techniques. The reserves to the north will be quarried using the diamond bladed cutting machines, hydro bags and wire saws to shape the blocks. This process avoids the use of dusty and noisy blasting as the primary extraction method, thereby protecting the surrounding environment, which has been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI). Albion Stone PLC now extract all their stone through mining which dramatically reduces the impact on the environment and local residents. Jordan&#x27;s Mine is currently the biggest mine on Portland.
Bowers Quarry has been operational since the late 18th century. It has been leased from The Crown Estate since 1979, and in 2002 it became the site of the first Portland stone mine by Albion Stone PLC. Extraction from this site is now completely underground, with the original Bowers Mine in the extreme southern end of the quarry and the High Wall Extraction on the eastern and south east boundaries. High Wall Extraction is a series of small mines that extract otherwise wasted stone that sits between the final faces of the quarry and the actual boundary of the site.

Stonehills Mine is the first completely new mine on Portland (not a mine as an extension from an existing quarry). Albion Stone Plc began the process to open this mine in 2015 and reserves are estimated to last for 50 years (2066).

Independent Quarry and Admiralty Quarry are both owned by The Crown Estate and have been leased since 1982. These quarries have been worked since the mid-19th century with the final dimension stones coming out of Independent in 2006, although some stocks of Portland stone block still remain.

Coombefield Quarry, located near Southwell has been open cast quarried over the last 80 years and is one of three privately owned quarries by Portland Stone Firms Ltd, the largest landholder on the island. The quarry is nearing the end of its life and will be regenerated as a holiday caravan park to boost local tourism on the island.

Perryfield Quarry is found towards the middle of the island and being actively open cast quarried. There are over 20 years of reserves left which is privately owned by Portland Stone Firms. Open cast quarrying provides quicker extraction of raw block dimension stone whilst maintaining its integrity. The majority of buildings in London today use Portland which has been quarried using the same methods over the last 60 years.

Broadcroft Quarry is located on the eastern side of the island and is a part of the open cast quarries used for St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. Privately owned by Portland Stone Firms Limited there are over 20 years of reserves left and still being actively quarried.

The coastal strip toward the southern tip of the island has permission to be worked by Portland Stone Firms and will provide in excess of 30 years of reserves. Permission has been granted for this to be open cast quarried.

Once quarries have been worked they are then restored. The Portland Sculpture and Quarry Trust was formed in 1983 and is dedicated to preserving a knowledge and understanding of stone and the landscape from which it comes. The main non-working quarry remains Tout Quarry in which the trust is based, where a workshop is held every year. Tout Quarry has been donated to the Portland Sculpture and Quarry Trust by Portland Stone Firms Limited.

===Quarrying methods===
Traditionally small diameter holes (35 mm) were drilled horizontally under each rock and charged with a small quantity of gunpowder, chosen because of its relative non-shattering properties. When fired the gunpowder produced a &quot;heave&quot; which dislodged the rock from its natural bed, hopefully undamaged. Stone was cut using plugs and feathers, where a series of short, small diameter (typically 30 mm) holes are drilled in a line where a cut is to be made. One plug and two feathers were inserted into each hole and each plug is hit in turn with a sledgehammer until the stone yields to the extreme tensile stresses produced. Most stone is many times weaker in tension than in compression, plugs and feathers utilise this fact. It is also worth noting that stone tends to split much more easily parallel to bedding planes (called graining) than perpendicular to them (called cutting).

In 1999, Italian stone cutting equipment, originally designed for use in Tuscany&#x27;s marble quarries was imported by Albion Stone and applied to the extraction of Portland stone. This new technology eliminated the need for blasting, significantly improved the quarries&#x27; environmental performance and removed the potential for any possible damage to the stone being quarried through shock. Full account of the local jointing pattern is made when deciding the position and orientation of cuts. Once the quarry faces have been cut, the stone is gently displaced hydraulically. This is done using &quot;hydro-bags&quot;, which are thin, flat, steel bags or envelopes that when inflated with water under moderate pressure, are capable of producing the forces necessary to loosen the stone to the point where it can be easily removed using large wheeled loaders. Splitting stone, using pneumatic drills is arduous work and so wire-saws have been introduced into the quarries, replacing much of the plug and feather cutting.

===Mining===

Mining in Portland is done by using a room and pillar method. The mine is advanced by extracting the stone using an abrasive tool chain cutter mounted on a machine. Slots are cut into the top, bottom, sides and middle of the stone. A flat steel pillow is inserted into the middle cut and slowly inflated with water. The stones are gently broken off at the back without placing any stress on the resulting blocks. This method of extraction is significantly more expensive than blasting, but results in a higher yield thereby saving valuable reserves for future generations. The environmental benefits are substantial as mining significantly reduces the impact on wildlife and the local community with reduced noise and dust.

==Portland stone buildings==

Portland&#x27;s freestone has almost certainly been used as a building material since Roman times. The many well crafted Roman sarcophagi (stone coffins and matching lids, hewn from single large blocks of Portland stone) that have been unearthed locally over the years, testify to the skill of their makers.

The earliest known building to be constructed using Portland stone is Rufus Castle at Church Ope Cove, Portland. The original structure was probably built around 1080, rebuilt around 1259 and rebuilt yet again around 1450, which is the likely date of the walls seen today. The first known Portland stone quarries were situated on the northeastern coast of the Isle, close to Rufus Castle, where huge landslips made the stone more easily accessible, and the proximity of the sea allowed the quarried stone blocks to be moved over relatively large distances by barge.

Portland stone was used to build the Palace of Westminster in 1347, the Tower of London in 1349 and the first stone London Bridge in 1350. Exeter Cathedral and Christchurch Priory, also constructed during the 14th Century, are built of Portland stone. Its superb characteristics have ensured a popularity amongst masons and architects that has endured ever since. The East side of Buckingham Palace, the official London residence of King Charles III, including the balcony, was faced with Portland stone, first in 1854 and again in 1913. The Victoria Memorial (unveiled 1911) is also made of it.

Inigo Jones (1573–1652) used Portland stone to build the Banqueting Hall in Whitehall in 1620. Sir Christopher Wren used nearly one million cubic feet to rebuild St. Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and many other minor churches after the Great Fire of London in 1666.

All of the stone used by Wren was transported by sailing barge from Portland to the centre of London via the sea and then up the Thames. Wren&#x27;s widespread use of Portland stone firmly established it as London&#x27;s &quot;local stone&quot; and as one of the best-loved British building stones. Other famous London buildings constructed of Portland stone are The British Museum (1753) with the new WCEC extension in Portland Roach which was short-listed for the Stirling Prize in 2017, Somerset House (1792), the General Post Office (1829), the Bank of England, the Mansion House and the National Gallery. Tower Bridge is partly clad in Portland stone (along with Cornish granite). Portland stone was used in 1923 to build the supporting pillar of the Grace Gates at Lord&#x27;s Cricket Ground.
Recently, Portland stone has been used in the building of Chelsea Barracks, Wilkins Terrace at UCL University College London, St James&#x27;s Market Haymarket, London and Green Park tube station.

Portland stone is prevalent in Manchester despite the historical preferred use of hard-wearing materials, such as Burmantofts and sandstone to resist the harsh industrial environment. Portland stone was mostly used in Manchester during the 1930s. Manchester buildings with Portland stone exterior include 100 King Street (1935), Arkwright House (1937), St. James Buildings (1912), Manchester Central Library (1934), Kendal Milne (1939) and Sunlight House (1932).

Two of Liverpool&#x27;s &quot;Three Graces&quot;, the Cunard Building and the Port of Liverpool Building, are clad in Portland stone which surrounds their reinforced concrete frames.

The Nottingham Council House, completed in 1929, is also built with Portland stone, as are the public buildings in Cardiff&#x27;s civic centre. Architect Charles Holden significantly used the stone in his major commissions of the 1920s and 1930s, including Senate House and 55 Broadway, the home of the London Underground. The 1929 steel framed building (one of the first erected in the United Kingdom) of the London School of Hygiene &amp; Tropical Medicine, based in Keppel Street, has a Portland stone façade to complete its stripped Classical design. After the Second World War (1939–1945), the bombed out centres of many English towns and cities, such as Plymouth, Bristol, Coventry and London were reconstructed using vast facades of Portland stone.

Many of the buildings surrounding the flagship Parkinson Building at the University of Leeds are clad in Portland stone, including the Michael Sadler Building, the Chemistry and Engineering buildings and the new Laidlaw Library.

Oxford typically uses oolitic limestone in its buildings, and the Ashmolean Museum has been refurbished using a large amount of Portland stone.

Portland stone has also been used across the world. Examples include the UN building in New York, the Casino Kursaal in Belgium and the Auckland War Memorial Museum. Most of the important civic and administrative buildings which survive from 18th and 19th century Dublin, Ireland, known then as &quot;the second city of the Empire&quot;, are of Portland stone, including City Hall (1779), the Houses of Parliament (1767), the Custom House (1791), the National Gallery (1864) and the General Post Office (1818). More recent projects include the BBC Broadcasting House in London, which won the &quot;New Build (Modern Non-Load-bearing Stone) Award&quot; in the 2006 Natural Stone Awards.

Portland stone has been designated by the International Union of Geological Sciences as a Global Heritage Stone Resource.

==Memorials==
Following the First World War, Sir Edwin Lutyens used Portland stone (quarried from the bottom of Wakeham) to construct the Cenotaph in London&#x27;s Whitehall. Erected in 1920, The Cenotaph commemorates the millions of people killed in this and subsequent conflicts.
The RAF Bomber Command Memorial in London&#x27;s Green Park commemorates the 55,573 crew members of the RAF&#x27;s Bomber Command who were killed between 1939 and 1945.

The gravestones for British personnel killed in the First and Second World Wars were made out of Portland stone. The Commonwealth War Graves Commission use Portland Limestone supplier Albion Stone&#x27;s Portland Basebed.

Portland stone was used for the Armed Forces Memorial in Staffordshire, England. Designed by Liam O&#x27;Connor Architects and Planning Consultants, it was completed in 2007 at a cost of over £6 million and bears the names of over 16,000 service personnel of the British Armed Forces killed since the Second World War.

==Substitution==
Portland stone is recognised to be of a high quality, but is somewhat expensive. In the case of the refurbishment of the British Museum&#x27;s central court, the planned Portland stone was controversially substituted with Anstrude Roche Claire stone from France, another similar (but cheaper) oolitic limestone.

==Cement==

The term, &quot;Portland cement&quot;, was coined by Joseph Aspdin who in 1824 patented a hydraulic binder created by burning a mixture of limestone and clay, resembling the previously existing Roman cement and presenting a material which he hoped looked like the famous Portland building stone.

<text>Henry Eric Beissel (12 April 1929 – 9 January 2025) was a Canadian writer and editor who published 24 volumes of poetry, six books of plays, a non-fiction book on Canada, two anthologies of plays intended for use in high schools, and numerous essays and pieces of short fiction.

==Life and career==
Henry Beissel was born in Cologne, Germany, and survived the Second World War as a youth. He came to Canada in 1951.

He first came to national attention with the controversial literary/political journal &quot;Edge&quot; (Edmonton 1963 – Montreal 1969).

Beissel&#x27;s internationally successful &quot;Inuk and the Sun&quot; (&quot;a mythic masterpiece&quot;, Sherrill Grace) premiered at the Stratford Festival of Canada in 1973. This was followed by a U.S. premiere in 1977 at The Other Theatre in Chicago&#x27;s Bernard Horwich Jewish Community Center with a musical score by Douglas L. Lieberman. The Other Theatre also commissioned &quot;Under Coyote&#x27;s Eye&quot; and performed it at the Field Museum of Natural History. Beissel&#x27;s work has been translated into many languages.

Beissel had a long teaching career in English literature, and later in creative writing, which started as a teaching fellow at the University of Toronto. He taught at the University of Munich (1960–62), the University of Alberta (1962–64) and Concordia University (Montreal) (1966–96), from which he retired as distinguished emeritus professor of English.

Beissel lived with his wife, Arlette Francière, in Ottawa. He died on 9 January 2025, at the age of 95.

==Awards==
Beissel received several awards, including the Walter-Bauer Literaturpreis, Merseburg (Germany), 1994. The first was the Norma Epstein Award for Creative Writing in 1958 at University of Toronto, and the last was the Ottawa Book Award, fiction category, in 2020 for his poetry collection Footprints of Dark Energy.

<text>Qu You (, 1341–1427), courtesy name Zongji (宗吉) and self-nicknamed Cunzhai (存齋, &quot;Reading Studio of Existence&quot;), was a Chinese novelist who lived in the Ming dynasty, and whose works inspired a new genre fantasy works with political subtext of the Qing dynasty.

Born in Qiantang (錢塘, now Hangzhou), Qu You was famous as an adolescent poet. He became a teacher-official (教諭) in Lin&#x27;an (臨安), then promoted to be the Head of Secretary (長史) of the Zhou (周) Kingdom. But at the height of his career, he became implicated in a dispute between the Hongwu Emperor and Zhu Su and was jailed in 1408.

After his release in 1425, he worked as a tutor in the household of Lord of Ying State (英國公). He was reinstated as an official, but he resigned shortly, never returning to the world of politics again, in action. His works, though entertaining, have undertone that expresses concerns and discontent that he had with the Zhu family and politics of the Ming dynasty.

<text>The Isle of Portland is a tied island, long by wide, in the English Channel. The southern tip, Portland Bill, lies south of the resort of Weymouth, forming the southernmost point of the county of Dorset, England. A barrier beach called Chesil Beach joins Portland with mainland England. The A354 road passes down the Portland end of the beach and then over the Fleet Lagoon by bridge to the mainland. The population of Portland is 13,417.

Portland is a central part of the Jurassic Coast, a World Heritage Site on the Dorset and east Devon coast, important for its geology and landforms. Portland stone, a limestone famous for its use in British and world architecture, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the United Nations Headquarters, continues to be quarried here.

Portland Harbour, in between Portland and Weymouth, is one of the largest man-made harbours in the world. The harbour was made by the building of stone breakwaters between 1848 and 1905. From its inception it was a Royal Navy base, and played prominent roles during the First and Second World Wars; ships of the Royal Navy and NATO countries worked up and exercised in its waters until 1995. The harbour is now a civilian port and popular recreation area, and was used for the 2012 Olympic Games.

The name Portland is used for one of the British Sea Areas, and has been exported as the name of several North American and Australian towns, such as Portland, Victoria, and Portland, Oregon; the latter of which was named after the city in Maine, which named itself after the isle. The name is also used for a popular street in Kowloon, Hong Kong, and a parish in Jamaica.

== History ==

Portland has been inhabited since at least the Mesolithic period (the Middle Stone Age)—there is archaeological evidence of Mesolithic inhabitants at the Culverwell Mesolithic Site, near Portland Bill, and of habitation since then. The Romans occupied Portland, reputedly calling it &quot;Vindelis&quot;.

Although the beginning of the Viking Age in England is dated to their raid in 793, when they destroyed the abbey on Lindisfarne, their first documented landing occurred in Portland four years earlier, in 789, as recorded in the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;. Three lost Viking ships from Hordaland (the district around Hardanger fjord in west Norway) landed at Portland Bill. The king&#x27;s reeve tried to collect taxes from them, but they killed him and sailed on.

A castle on the site of the present Rufus Castle, standing over Church Ope Cove, may have been built for William II of England (also known as William Rufus) soon after the conquest of England by his father William the Conqueror. None of that castle remains; the existing castle probably dates from the 15th century.
In 1539 King Henry VIII ordered the construction of Portland Castle for defence against attacks by the French; the castle cost £4,964 (equivalent to £ in 2025). It is one of the best preserved castles from this period, and is opened to the public by the custodians English Heritage.

In the 17th century, chief architect and Surveyor-General to James I, Inigo Jones, surveyed the area and introduced the local Portland stone to London, using it in his Banqueting House, Whitehall, and for repairs on Old St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral. His successor, Sir Christopher Wren, an architect and the Member of Parliament for nearby Weymouth, used six million tons of white Portland limestone to rebuild destroyed parts of the capital after the Great Fire of London of 1666. Well-known buildings in the capital, including St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral and the eastern front of Buckingham Palace feature the stone. After the First World War, a quarry was opened by The Crown Estate to provide stone for the Cenotaph in Whitehall and half a million gravestones for war cemeteries, and after the Second World War hundreds of thousands of gravestones were hewn for soldiers who had fallen on the Western Front. Portland cement has nothing to do with Portland; it was so named due to its similar colour to Portland stone when mixed with lime and sand.
There have been railways in Portland since the early 19th century. The Merchant&#x27;s Railway was the earliest—it opened in 1826 (one year after the Stockton and Darlington railway) and ran from the quarries at the north of Tophill to a pier at Castletown, from where the Portland stone was shipped around the country. The Weymouth and Portland Railway was laid in 1865, and ran from a station in Melcombe Regis, across the Fleet and along the low isthmus behind Chesil Beach to a station at Victoria Square in Chiswell. At the end of the 19th century the line was extended to the top of the island as the Easton and Church Ope Railway, running through Castletown and ascending the cliffs at East Weares, to loop back north to a station in Easton. The line closed to passengers in 1952, and the final goods train (and two passenger &#x27;specials&#x27;) ran in April 1965.

The Royal National Institution for the Preservation of Life from Shipwreck stationed a lifeboat at Portland in 1826, which was withdrawn in 1851. Coastal flooding has affected Portland&#x27;s residents and transport for centuries—the only way off the island by land is along the causeway in the lee of Chesil Beach. At times of extreme floods (about every 10 years) this road link is cut by floods. The low-lying village of Chiswell used to flood on average every 5 years. Chesil Beach occasionally faces severe storms and massive waves, which have a fetch across the Atlantic Ocean. Following two severe flood events in the 1970s, Weymouth and Portland Borough Council and Wessex Water decided to investigate the structure of the beach, and coastal management schemes that could be built to protect Chiswell and the beach road. In the 1980s it was agreed that a scheme to provide storm protection with a 20% annual exceedance probability to reduce flood depth and duration in more severe storms. Hard engineering techniques were employed in the scheme, including a gabion running to the north of Chiswell, an extended sea wall in Chesil Cove, and a culvert running from inside the beach, underneath the beach road and into Portland Harbour, to divert flood water away from low-lying areas.

At the start of the First World War, HMS &quot;Hood&quot; was sunk in the passage between the southern breakwaters to protect the harbour from torpedo and submarine attack. Portland Harbour was formed (1848–1905) by the construction of breakwaters, but before that the natural anchorage had hosted ships of the Royal Navy for more than 500 years. It was &quot;the home of the Asdics,&quot; a centre for Admiralty research into asdic submarine detection and underwater weapons from 1917 to 1998; the shore base HMS Serepta was renamed HMS Osprey in 1927. During the Second World War Portland was the target of 48 air raids and a total of 532 bombs, although most warships had moved north as Portland was within enemy striking range across the Channel. Mulberry Harbour Phoenix Units can be seen at Black Barge beach, near Portland Castle. Portland was a major embarkation point for Allied forces on D-Day in 1944. Early helicopters were stationed at Portland in 1946–1948, and in 1959 a shallow tidal flat, The Mere, was infilled, and sports fields taken to form a heliport. The station was formally commissioned as HMS Osprey, which then became the largest and busiest military helicopter station in Europe. The base was gradually improved with additional landing areas and one of England&#x27;s shortest runways, at .

The naval base closed after the end of the Cold War in 1995, and the Royal Naval Air Station closed in 1999, although the runway remained in use for Her Majesty&#x27;s Coastguard Search and Rescue flights as MRCC Portland until 2014. MRCC Portland&#x27;s area of responsibility extended midway across the English Channel, and from Start Point in Devon to the Dorset/Hampshire border, covering an area of around . The 12 Search and Rescue teams in the Portland area dealt with almost 1000 incidents in 2005. Portland lends its name to one of the BBC&#x27;s Shipping Forecast regions.

There are still two prisons on Portland: HMP The Verne, which until 1949 was a Victorian military fortress, and a Young Offenders&#x27; Institution (HMYOI) on the Grove clifftop. This was the original prison (HM Prison Portland) built for convicts who quarried stone for the Portland Breakwaters from 1848. For a few years until 2005 Britain&#x27;s only prison ship, HMP &quot;The Weare&quot;, was berthed in the harbour.

== Governance ==

There are two tiers of local government covering Portland, at parish (town) and unitary authority level: Portland Town Council and Dorset Council. The town council is based at the Portland Community Venue, a converted school in Fortuneswell.

Since the 2019 structural changes to local government, Portland is in the Dorset unitary authority, administered by Dorset Council. The whole island forms Portland ward which is one of the 52 wards and elects three members to the council.

Portland is an ancient royal manor, and until the 19th century was a separate liberty, with certain judicial functions for the isle held separately from the rest of Dorset. The whole isle was also an ancient parish; the original parish church was St Andrew&#x27;s at Church Ope Cove on the east side of the island, which was replaced by St George&#x27;s Church in the eighteenth century after St Andrew&#x27;s was damaged by landslips. The isle was gradually divided into smaller ecclesiastical parishes, but remained a single civil parish.
The parish was made a local government district in 1867, governed by an elected local board. Such districts were reconstituted as urban districts in 1894. In 1933/1934, Portland Urban District Council built itself a new headquarters at 3 Fortuneswell.

Portland Urban District was abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972 to become part of the borough of Weymouth and Portland. A successor parish was created for the former urban district, with its council taking the name Portland Town Council. The town council continued to be based at the old urban district council&#x27;s building at Fortuneswell until 2016.

In 2019, the borough of Weymouth and Portland was abolished when Dorset moved to a unitary authority structure of local government.

Portland forms part of the South Dorset parliamentary constituency, created in 1885. The constituency elects one Member of Parliament; the current MP is Lloyd Hatton (Labour).

Weymouth and Portland have been twinned with the town of Holzwickede in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany since 1986, and the French town of Louviers, in the department of Eure in Normandy, since 1959. The borough and nearby Chickerell have been a Fairtrade Zone since 2007.

== Geography ==
The Isle of Portland lies in the English Channel, south of Wyke Regis, and west-southwest of London, at (50.55, −2.44). Portland is situated approximately halfway along the UNESCO Jurassic Coast World Heritage Site; the site includes of the Dorset and east Devon coast that is important for its geology and landforms. The South West Coast Path runs around the coast; it is the United Kingdom&#x27;s longest national trail at . Portland is unusual as it is connected to the mainland at Abbotsbury by Chesil Beach, a tombolo which runs north-west to West Bay. Portland is sometimes defined incorrectly as a tombolo—in fact Portland is a tied island, and Chesil Beach is the tombolo (a spit joined to land at both ends).

There are eight settlements on Portland, the largest being Fortuneswell in Underhill and Easton on Tophill. Castletown and Chiswell are the other villages in Underhill, and Weston, Southwell, Wakeham and the Grove are on the Tophill plateau. Many old buildings are built out of Portland Stone; several parts have been designated Conservation Areas to preserve the unique character the older settlements which date back hundreds of years.

The Isle of Portland has been designated by Natural England as National Character Area 137. It is adjoined by the Weymouth Lowlands to the north.

=== Geology ===
Geologically, Portland is separated into two areas; the steeply sloping land at its north end called Underhill, and the larger, gently sloping land to the south, called Tophill. Portland stone lies under Tophill; the strata decline at a shallow angle of around 1.5 degrees, from a height of near the Verne in the north, to just above sea level at Portland Bill. The geology of Underhill is different to Tophill; Underhill lies on a steep escarpment composed of Portland Sand, lying above a thicker layer of Kimmeridge Clay, which extends to Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour. This Kimmeridge Clay has resulted in a series of landslides, forming West Weares and East Weares.

 underneath south Dorset lies a layer of Triassic rock salt, and Portland is one of four locations in the United Kingdom where the salt is thick enough to create stable cavities. Portland Gas applied to excavate 14 caverns to store of natural gas, which is one per cent of the UK&#x27;s total annual demand. It was proposed that the caverns should be connected to the National gas grid at Mappowder via a pipeline. Plans had it that the surface facilities should be complete to store the first gas in 2011, and the entire cavern space available for storage in winter 2013. As part of the £350 million scheme, the Grade II listed former Old Engine Shed would be converted into a £1.5 million educational centre with a café and an exhibition space about the geology of Portland.

=== Portland Bill ===
Portland Bill is the southern tip of the island of Portland. The Bill has three lighthouse towers. The Higher Lighthouse is now a dwelling and holiday apartments whilst the Lower Lighthouse is now a bird observatory and field centre providing records of bird migration and accommodation for visitors, which opened in 1961. The white and red lighthouse on Bill Point replaced the Higher and Lower Lighthouses in 1906. It is a prominent and much photographed feature; an important landmark for ships passing the headland and its tidal race. The current lighthouse was refurbished in 1996 and became remotely controlled. It now contains a visitors&#x27; centre giving information and guided tours of the lighthouse.

===Portland Ledge and Portland Race===
Portland Ledge is an underwater extension of Portland Stone into the English Channel at a place where the depth of Channel is 20 to 40 metres (about 10 to 20 fathoms). Tidal flow is disrupted by the feature; at 10 metres (about 5 fathoms) deep and long, it causes a tidal race to the south of Portland Bill, the so-called Portland Race. The current only stops for brief periods during the -hour tidal cycle and can reach at the spring tide of .

=== Ecology ===

Due to its isolated coastal location, the Isle of Portland has an extensive range of flora and fauna; the coastline and disused quarries are designated as Sites of Special Scientific Interest. The Isle of Portland SSSI encompasses , and includes 17 monitored features ranging from Jurassic fossils, calcareous grassland, rock sea-lavender and nationally scarce butterflies. Sea and migratory birds occupy the cliffs in different seasons, sometimes these include rare species which draw ornithologists from around the country. Rare visitors to the surrounding seas include dolphins, seals and basking sharks. Chesil Beach is one of only two sites in Britain where the scaly cricket can be found; unlike any other cricket it is wingless and does not sing or hop. Ten British Primitive goats were introduced to the East Weares part of the island to control scrub in 2007.

The comparatively warm and sunny climate allows species of plants to thrive which do not on the mainland. The limestone soil has low nutrient levels; hence smaller species of wild flowers and grasses are able to grow in the absence of larger species. Portland sea lavender can be found on the higher sea cliffs; unique to Portland, it is one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s rarest plants. The wild flowers and plants make an excellent habitat for butterflies; over half of the British Isles&#x27; 57 butterfly species can be seen on Portland, including varieties that migrate from mainland Europe. Species live on Portland that are rare in the United Kingdom, including the limestone race of the silver-studded blue.

=== Climate ===

The mild seas which almost surround the tied island produce a temperate climate (Köppen climate classification &quot;Cfb&quot;) with a small variation in daily and annual temperatures. The average annual mean temperature from 1991 to 2020 was . The warmest month is August, which has an average temperature range of , and the coolest is February, which has a range of . Mean winter temperatures are amongst the highest in the British Isles, and by far warmer than the United Kingdom average. However, due to the island&#x27;s proximity to the sea, summers are cooler than the national average, with temperatures rarely climbing to the extremes seen in in-land areas further north. As a result of its coastal extremity and mild winter minimum temperatures, Portland is suitable for plants with the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s hardiness rating H2. Mean sea surface temperatures range from in February to in August; the annual mean is .

The mild seas that surround Portland act to keep night-time temperatures above freezing, making air frost rare: on average 6.3 days per year — this is far below the United Kingdom&#x27;s average annual total of 55.6 days of frost. Days with snow lying are equally rare: on average zero to five days per year; almost all winters have no more than one day with snow lying. It may snow or sleet in winter, yet it almost never settles on the ground—coastal areas in South West England such as Portland generally experience the mildest winters in the UK. Portland is less affected by the Atlantic storms that Devon and Cornwall experience. The growing season lasts for more than 310 days per year, and the borough is in Hardiness zone 9.

Weymouth and Portland, and the rest of the south coast, has the sunniest climate in the United Kingdom. Portland averaged 1822.6 hours of sunshine annually between 1991 and 2020, which is 42% of the maximum possible, and 36% above the United Kingdom average of 1402.7 hours. December is the cloudiest month (62.2 hours of sunshine), November the wettest ( of rain) and July is the sunniest and driest month (237.4 hours of sunshine, of rain). Sunshine totals in all months are well above the United Kingdom average, and monthly rainfall totals throughout the year are less than the UK average, particularly in summer; this summer minimum of rainfall is not experienced away from the south coast of England. The average annual rainfall of is well below the UK average of .

== Demography ==


The population of Portland in 2021 was 13,417; this figure has remained around twelve to thirteen thousand since the 1970s. In 2011 there were 6,312 dwellings in an area of , with a population density of 1112 people per km2. The population is almost entirely native to the United Kingdom and 93.9 per cent of residents are of white British ethnicity, well above the England and Wales average of 80.5 per cent. The average price of a detached house on Portland in 2010 was £194,200; terraced houses are cheaper, at £149,727, and a flat or maisonette costs £110,500.

Crime rates are below average—there were 5.4 burglaries per 1000 households in 2009 and 2010; which is lower than South West England (7.6 per 1000) and significantly lower than England and Wales (11.6 per 1000). Unemployment levels are very low, at 1.9 per cent in July 2011, compared to the British average of 7.7 per cent. The most common religious identity in Weymouth and Portland is Christianity, at 61.0 per cent, which is slightly above the England and Wales average of 59.3 per cent. The next-largest sector is those with no religion, at 29.3 per cent, also slightly above the average of 25.1 per cent.

== Transport ==

The A354 road is the only land access to Portland, via Ferry Bridge, connecting to Weymouth and to the wider road network at the A35 trunk road in Dorchester. It runs from Easton, splitting into a northbound section through Chiswell and a southbound section through Fortuneswell, then along Chesil Beach and across a bridge to the mainland in Wyke Regis. Formerly the Portland Branch Railway also crossed to the island. The corridor is now a traffic-free walking and cycle path.

Local buses are run by FirstGroup, with services to Weymouth. Weymouth is the hub for south Dorset bus routes, with services to Dorchester and local villages. Weymouth is connected to towns and villages along the Jurassic Coast by the Jurassic Coast Bus service, which runs for from Exeter to Poole, through Sidford, Beer, Seaton, Lyme Regis, Charmouth, Bridport, Abbotsbury, Weymouth, Wool, and Wareham. Trains run from Weymouth to London, Southampton, Bristol and Gloucester but ferries no longer transport passengers to the French port of St Malo and the Channel Islands of Guernsey and Jersey.

== Education ==
St George&#x27;s Community Primary School is located in Easton. The only other school on Portland is the Atlantic Academy, an all-through school for pupils aged 3 to 19 based at two different sites. Formerly known as the Isle of Portland Aldridge Community Academy, it formed in 2012 by merging four primary schools and one secondary school.

Some students commute to Weymouth or Dorchester to study A-Levels, or to attend other secondary schools nearby. Weymouth College in Melcombe Regis is the nearest further education college, which has around 7,500 students from south west England and overseas, about 1500 studying A-Level courses.

== Culture ==

=== Sport and recreation ===

In 2000, the Weymouth and Portland National Sailing Academy was built in Osprey Quay in Underhill as a centre for sailing in the United Kingdom. Weymouth and Portland&#x27;s waters were credited by the Royal Yachting Association as the best in Northern Europe. Weymouth and Portland regularly host local, national and international sailing events in their waters; these include the J/24 World Championships in 2005, trials for the 2004 Athens Olympics, the ISAF World Championship 2006, the BUSA Fleet Racing Championships, and the RYA Youth National Championships.

In 2005, the WPNSA was selected to host sailing events at the 2012 Olympic Games—mainly because the academy had recently been built, so no new venue would have to be provided. However, as part of the South West of England Regional Development Agency&#x27;s plans to redevelop Osprey Quay, a new 600-berth marina and an extension with more on-site facilities were built. Construction was scheduled between October 2007 and the end of 2008, and with its completion and formal opening on 11 June 2009, the venue became the first of the 2012 Olympic Games to be completed.

Weymouth Bay and Portland Harbour are used for other water sports – the reliable wind is favourable for wind and kite-surfing. Chesil Beach and Portland Harbour are used regularly for angling, scuba diving to shipwrecks, snorkelling, canoeing, and swimming. The limestone cliffs and quarries are used for rock climbing; Portland has areas for bouldering and deep water soloing, however sport climbing with bolt protection is the most common style. Since June 2003 the South West Coast Path National Trail has included of coastal walking around the Isle of Portland, including following the A354 Portland Beach Road twice.

Isle of Portland has a Non-League football club Portland United F.C. who play at Grove Corner. They also have a youth set up called Portland United youth football Club.

=== Rabbits ===

Rabbits have long been associated with bad luck on Portland. Use of the name is still taboo—the creatures are often referred to as &quot;underground mutton&quot;, &quot;long-eared furry things&quot; or just &quot;bunnies&quot;. The origin of this superstition is obscure (there is no record of it before the 1920s) but it is believed to derive from quarry workers. They would see rabbits emerging from their burrows immediately before a rock fall and blame them for increasing the risk of dangerous, sometimes deadly, landslides. If a rabbit was seen in a quarry, the workers would go home for the day, until the safety of the area had been assured.

As of 2006, older Portland residents were said to be &#x27;offended&#x27; (sometimes for the benefit of tourists) by the mention of rabbits; this superstition came to national attention in October 2005 when a special batch of advertisement posters were made for the Wallace and Gromit film, &quot;The Curse of the Were-Rabbit&quot;. Out of respect for local beliefs the adverts omitted the word &#x27;rabbit&#x27; and replaced the film&#x27;s title with the phrase &quot;Something bunny is going on&quot;.

=== Religion ===
=== Literature ===
Thomas Hardy described Portland as &quot;the peninsula carved by Time out of a single stone&quot;, and named it the &quot;Isle of Slingers&quot; and &quot;Isle of the Race&quot; in his Wessex novels; it was the main setting of &quot;The Well-Beloved&quot; (1897), and was featured in &quot;The Trumpet-Major&quot; (1880). The cottage that now houses Portland Museum was the inspiration for the heroine&#x27;s house in &quot;The Well-Beloved&quot;. Portlanders were expert stone-throwers in the defence of their land, and Hardy&#x27;s &quot;Isle of Slingers&quot; is heavily based on Portland; the &quot;Street of Wells&quot; representing Fortuneswell and &quot;The Beal&quot; Portland Bill. Hardy also called Portland the &quot;Gibraltar of the North&quot;, with reference to its similarities with Gibraltar; its physical geography, isolation, comparatively mild climate, and Underhill&#x27;s winding streets.

A. E. Housman wrote of the place in his poem, &quot;The Isle of Portland&quot;, from &quot;A Shropshire Lad&quot;.

Hilaire Belloc&#x27;s book &quot;The Cruise of the &quot;Nona&quot;&quot; is about sailing near Portland, and the reflections it occasions. He describes Portland Race as &quot;the master terror of our world&quot;, and says &quot;... if you were to make a list of all the things which Portland Race has swallowed up, it would rival Orcus&quot;.

In &quot;Museums Without Walls&quot;, Jonathan Meades declares that &quot;Portland is a bulky chunk of geological, social, topographical and demographic weirdness. It is the obverse of a beauty spot. &#x27;Beauty&#x27; in this construction implies the picturesque. Portland is gloriously bereft of this quality. It is awesome. There is nothing pretty about it.&quot;

In &quot;The Warlord Chronicles&quot; (1995–97), Bernard Cornwell makes Portland the Isle of the Dead, a place of internal exile, where the causeway was guarded to keep the &#x27;dead&#x27; (people suffering insanity) from crossing the Fleet and returning to the mainland. No historical evidence exists to support this idea.

The Portland Chronicles series of four children&#x27;s books, set on and around Portland and Weymouth and written by local author Carol Hunt, draw on local history to explore a seventeenth century world of smuggling, witchcraft, piracy and local intrigue.

In the Louis L&#x27;Amour novel &quot;To the Far Blue Mountains&quot; the novel&#x27;s main character, Barnabas Sackett, hides in Cave Hole at the Bill of Portland before meeting a sailing ship in an attempt to escape from England.

&quot;Pink Pippos of Portland&quot;, a children&#x27;s storybook about nearby Chesil Beach was written by Portland author Sandra Fretwell.

<text>Six Flags Entertainment Corporation, formerly Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc., was an American amusement park corporation, headquartered in Arlington, Texas. At its height, Six Flags owned more theme parks and waterparks than any other company: 42 properties in the United States, Canada, and Mexico, including theme parks, amusement parks, water parks, and a family entertainment center. In 2019, Six Flags properties hosted 32.8 million customers, the seventh-highest attendance in the world.

Founded in the 1960s and named for its first theme park, Six Flags Over Texas, the company was known first as Six Flags, Corp., and later Six Flags, Inc. The company maintained a corporate office in Midtown Manhattan, and headquarters in Arlington, Texas. On June 13, 2009, the corporation filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, which it exited after corporate restructuring on May 3, 2010.

On July 1, 2024, Six Flags merged with rival Cedar Fair in an $8 billion deal; the merged company, also called Six Flags and based in Charlotte, operates 51 properties, including 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks, and nine resorts.

== History ==
=== Origin ===

In 1957, real estate businessman Angus G. Wynne and other investors created The Great Southwest Corporation, which in 1960 began building its first theme park in Arlington, Texas, between Dallas and Fort Worth. They named it Six Flags Over Texas, a reference to the six nations that have governed Texas: Spain, France, Mexico, the Republic of Texas, the United States of America, and the Confederate States of America. The park opened the following year for a short, 45-day season.

Six Flags Over Texas initially featured a Native American village, a gondola ride, a railroad, some Wild West shows, a stagecoach ride and &quot;Skull Island&quot;, a pirate-themed adventure attraction. There was also &quot;LaSalle&#x27;s River Adventure&quot;, inspired by the late-1600s La Salle Expeditions, that carried customers on French riverboats through a wilderness of animated puppets. Over the years, all of those attractions, except the railroad, were replaced by others, such as roller coasters, swing rides, log flumes and shoot-the-chute rides, as well as an observation tower.

=== Growth and acquisitions ===
In 1964, Angus Wynne&#x27;s uncle Toddie Lee Wynne announced he would sell his stake in the Great Southwest Corporation, a sale valued around $6 million. The Pennsylvania Railroad purchased 500,000 shares of the company, a controlling interest, as part of its effort to diversify its revenue sources.

The railroad merged with the New York Central Railroad to form Penn Central in 1968 and went bankrupt two years later; still it bankrolled geographic expansion and additions for its Six Flags parks. The company opened Six Flags Over Georgia in 1967 and Six Flags Over Mid-America in 1971. Those were the last two parks built by Six Flags, which continued to grow by acquiring independent parks. Six Flags purchased AstroWorld in Houston, Texas, in 1975; Great Adventure in Jackson, New Jersey, in 1977; and Magic Mountain in Valencia, California, in 1979.

In 1982, Penn Central—which had sold its railroad assets to Conrail and now consisted largely of its diversified sub-firms—sold the company to Bally Manufacturing.

In 1984, Six Flags bought the Great America theme park in Gurnee, Illinois, from the Marriott hotel chain. That deal also included the rights to use Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; animated characters in Six Flags properties.

In 1987, Bally surrendered control of the chain to Wesray Capital Corporation in a 1987 leveraged buyout. Time Warner quickly began to gain more company stock, gaining a 19.5% stake in Six Flags in 1990 and then 50% in 1991, with the remaining shares of the company being split by Blackstone Group and Wertheim Schroder &amp; Company. Time Warner purchased the remaining stake in Six Flags in 1993, changing the company&#x27;s name from &quot;Six Flags Corp&quot;. to &quot;Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc&quot;. In 1995, to reduce its debt, Time Warner sold 51% of Six Flags for $200 million in cash to an investment group led by Boston Ventures, shifting $800 million in debt to Six Flags.

In 1996, Six Flags began to manage Fiesta Texas theme park in San Antonio, Texas, with a ten-year option to buy. 

=== Premier Parks ===
Premier Parks, Inc. was an amusement park operator based in Oklahoma City, Oklahoma. They were founded in 1971 as Tierco Group, Inc., and initially operated as a real estate company. They entered the amusement park market in 1982, acquiring Frontier City for $1.2 million although the company was not interested in entering that route. Company officials described Frontier City as &quot;beat up&quot; and &quot;run down&quot; and had plans to demolish the park and build a shopping center in its place, but the oil bust in Oklahoma scuttled those plans. Instead, Tierco decided to touch up the park grounds, and in 1984 they hired Gary Story as general manager of Frontier City and spent about $13 million to improve the park. As the new head of Frontier City, he quadrupled the park&#x27;s attendance and revenues. Under his leadership, two rides, a ticket booth, a sales office, and a petting zoo were added to the park. Food service improved. By 1988, Tierco had fully shifted its strategic direction to the amusement parks market and eventually exited the real estate market, and in 1991 they had acquired the White Water water park from Silver Dollar City, Inc. and renamed it as White Water Bay. Tierco realized the key to boosting a park&#x27;s attendance was to add new and exciting rides and make it family-friendly.

In 1992, Tierco added its second amusement park to its portfolio by acquiring the financially troubled Wild World in Largo, Maryland and spent $500,000 to remodel the park. Tierco treated the park&#x27;s renovation similarly to Frontier City, where the park&#x27;s buildings were remodeled and the park&#x27;s children&#x27;s ride selection was expanded. The park also saw a name change to Adventure World, having a tropical look and feel. Afterward, Gary Story was promoted to executive vice president of the two parks, and by 1994 he had become president and chief operating officer (COO). Within that year, Adventure World saw two additional roller coasters and more flat rides. Tierco then changed its name to Premier Parks, Inc. afterwards, under Kieran E. Burke, chairman and chief executive officer.

During the second half of the 1990s, Premier Parks underwent a massive &quot;Growth through Acquisition&quot; phase. On August 16, 1995, they acquired Geauga Lake near Cleveland, Ohio, Wyandot Lake in Powell, Ohio and Darien Lake near Buffalo, New York from Funtime, Inc. for $60 million. While Lake Compounce was also included in the purchase, Premier Parks eventually sold it to Kennywood Entertainment Company. Aside from theme park acquisitions, Premier also saw plans to expand their water park offerings by opening water parks for the parks that didn&#x27;t have one.

In June 1996, Premier Parks went public and raised nearly $70 million through an initial offering at $18 per share. The company planned to use the money to expand its parks and acquire others. They began their acquisitions for the year by announcing the purchase of The Great Escape &amp; Splashwater Kingdom in Queensbury, New York for an undisclosed amount on August 27, to close the deal by December. This was followed up with the acquisition of Elitch Gardens in Denver, Colorado on September 25, the Waterworld USA waterparks in Sacramento and Concord, California, as well as Paradise Island Family Fun Park (next to Waterworld USA Sacramento) from FRE Inc. on October 25 and Riverside Park in Agawam, Massachusetts in December.

Premier began operating the Marine World theme park near San Francisco during the Mid-1997 season. On September 26, Kentucky Kingdom (located in Louisville) owner Paul Hart announced that he would sell the park&#x27;s operation lease to Premier Parks for $64 million, of which the deal would close on November 7. On October 11, Premier became the managing partner for Texas Flags, Ltd., the owners of the Six Flags Over Texas park, and took over its operations. In December, Premier announced that they would enter the European market by purchasing a controlling 94 percent interest in the Walibi Group in Wavre, Belgium. The company owned six park operations - Walibi Wavre/Aqualibi and Bellewaerde Park in Belgium, Walibi Flevo in Holland, and Walibi Aquitaine, Walibi Schtroumpf, and Walibi Rhône-Alpes in France. The purchase was made for Premier to compete with Disneyland Paris and would close in March 1998. Within the 1997 year alone, almost 11 million people visited parks owned by Premier.

=== Sale of Six Flags to Premier Parks ===
On February 10, 1998, Time Warner Entertainment and the investment group announced the sale of their stakes in Six Flags Theme Parks, Inc. to Premier Parks, Inc. for $1.86 billion, forming Premier&#x27;s largest purchase. The deal closed on April 1. Shortly afterwards in June, Kentucky Kingdom became the first of Premier&#x27;s owned parks to rebrand under the Six Flags moniker, effectively renamed as Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom. In October, Premier announced that an additional four parks would rebrand under the Six Flags moniker; Elitch Gardens, Darien Lake, The New Marine World and Adventure World. The former three would keep their names alongside the Six Flags suffix, while Adventure World would be completely reinvented and refurbished as Six Flags America. These additions also saw the addition of the Warner Bros. IPs to the respective parks and brought the number of Six Flags branded parks to seventeen. On November 18, 1998, Premier announced that they had fully purchased Six Flags Fiesta Texas from USAA, putting the park under their full control.

Aside from that, Premier Parks added additional parks to their portfolio. They purchased Reino Aventura in Mexico City, Mexico for an estimated $59 million in March, White Water Atlanta and its sister park American Adventures in Marietta, Georgia from Silver Dollar City, Inc. on May 5 for an undisclosed amount and SplashTown USA in Spring, Texas on May 17. On October 6, Premier announced the expansion of its North American licensing agreement with Warner Bros. to include rights to the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot;, Hanna-Barbera, Cartoon Network, and DC Comics characters and franchises in Europe, Latin and South America as well. The deal also allowed Premier to open more theme parks under the Warner Bros. Movie World brand theme parks in these territories. The deal also included the purchase of Warner Bros. Movie World Germany from the company and an agreement to hold a minority stake and manage the upcoming Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid theme park, which was scheduled to open in 2002. The deal did not include the original Warner Bros. Movie World on the Gold Coast, Australia, as that was under completely different ownership.

===Rebranding of Premier Parks under Six Flags name===
In their 1999 annual report, Premier Parks announced that they would rebrand under the &quot;Six Flags, Inc.&quot; name. The company also announced an additional four parks (two in the United States, and two international parks) would rebrand under the Six Flags brand - Geauga Lake becoming Six Flags Ohio, Riverside Park becoming Six Flags New England, Walibi Flevo becoming Six Flags Holland and Reino Aventura becoming Six Flags Mexico. The rebrands of all four parks coincided with the addition of Warner Bros. properties. In December 2000, Wild Waves and Enchanted Village in Federal Way, Washington was added to the Six Flags family when its owner Jeff Stock sold his shares of the park for $19.3 million.

On January 10, 2001, Six Flags announced that they had reached an agreement with Anheuser-Busch to purchase SeaWorld Ohio for $110 million. The deal would allow Six Flags to merge the former park with Six Flags Ohio alongside its campground properties and nearby hotels to form a massive entertainment complex. After the purchase was completed, the entire complex was rebranded under the name of &quot;Six Flags Worlds of Adventure&quot;, and was positioned to compete against northern Ohio&#x27;s Cedar Point. On January 15, Six Flags European Parks announced that they would rebrand Walibi Wavre as Six Flags Belgium for the 2001 season with the addition of the Warner Bros. properties. The rebranding would not apply to water park Aqualibi, which would keep its name. In May 2001, Six Flags expanded to the Canadian market by negotiating a deal with the city of Montreal to operate La Ronde in Montreal, Quebec, Canada. Six Flags acquired the assets of the park and has a long-term contract to lease the land from the city.

In April 2002, Warner Bros. Movie World Madrid opened to the public, adding another park to the Six Flags portfolio. The park was constructed as a joint venture between Six Flags, Warner Bros., and the City of Madrid, with Six Flags holding a minority stake and park operations. In August 2002, Six Flags purchased the lease operations to Jazzland in New Orleans for $22 million and rebranded it as Six Flags New Orleans for the 2003 season with the addition of the Warner Bros. properties. For 2003, Walibi Schtroumpf would see a name change to Walibi Lorraine after the contract to use &quot;The Smurfs&quot; characters was not renewed.

=== Asset sales and shareholder revolt ===
In 2004, Six Flags began the process of closing and selling properties to reduce the company&#x27;s growing debt. On March 10, Six Flags made two major theme park sales. They first announced the sale of Six Flags Worlds of Adventure to Cedar Fair for $145 million, with the deal planned to close before the start of the 2004 operating season. The deal would include the theme park, wildlife, and water park sections, as well as the adjacent hotel and campground while the animals would be relocated to other Six Flags parks, while branding that Cedar Fair didn&#x27;t own licensing rights to like &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and DC Comics, would be removed. Cedar Fair confirmed that the park would revert to its original name of Geauga Lake and that they would remove the wildlife section of the park in to focus on other facilities. The other was the sale of the Six Flags European Parks division to an undisclosed partner which was later confirmed to be Palmon Capital Partners. This deal was closed on June 24 with Palmon rebranding the company as StarParks. The Six Flags branded parks in Belgium and Holland reverted to the &quot;Walibi&quot; brand for the 2005 season while Warner Bros. Movie World Germany was rebranded as Movie Park Germany as the Warner Bros. license was not included in the sale.both sales raised $345 million. On November 23, 2004, Six Flags completely left the European market altogether when Warner Bros. Park Madrid&#x27;s management firms terminated their 99-year operation lease and stake. The park&#x27;s management took over operations of the park in-house while Warner Bros. acquired Six Flags&#x27; minority stake.
In 2005, Six Flags endured even more turmoil. Some of the company&#x27;s largest investors, notably Bill Gates&#x27;s Cascade Investments (which then owned about 11% of Six Flags) and Daniel Snyder&#x27;s Red Zone, LLC (which owned 12%), demanded change. On August 17, 2005, Red Zone began a proxy battle to gain control of Six Flags&#x27; board of directors. On August 29, 2005, Six Flags New Orleans was severely damaged by Hurricane Katrina, and has since sat abandoned. On September 12, Six Flags Chief Executive Officer Kieran Burke announced that Six Flags AstroWorld would be closed and demolished at the end of the 2005 season. The company cited issues such as the park&#x27;s performance, and parking issues involving the Houston Texans football team, Reliant Stadium, and the Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo, leveraged with the estimated value of the property which included the park. Company executives were expecting to receive upwards of $150 million for the real estate but ended up receiving $77 million when the bare property (which cost $20 million to clear) was sold to a development corporation in 2006. On November 22, 2005, Red Zone announced it had gained control of the board. Kieran Burke was removed on December 14 and was replaced by former executive vice president of ESPN programming and Red Zone CEO Mark Shapiro. Six Flags then named former Representative Jack Kemp, Miramax co-founder Harvey Weinstein and former president of the Interpublic Group of Companies Incorporated Michael Kassan, to their new board of directors.

Even with the new management team, the sell-offs would continue into 2006. On January 27, the company announced its exit from Oklahoma City by relocating its offices to New York City and putting Frontier City and White Water Bay up for sale. On April 13, they announced that they would terminate their lease to operate Wyandot Lake after the 2006 season and sell the lease back to the neighboring Columbus Zoo and Aquarium. On April 18, Six Flags announced that they would also terminate their lease with the Cal Expo to operate Waterworld Sacramento after the 2006 season. On June 23, they announced to either sell, reduce or close seven additional parks - Six Flags Elitch Gardens, Six Flags Darien Lake, Six Flags Waterworld, Six Flags Splashtown, Wild Waves and Enchanted Village and most notably, Six Flags Magic Mountain. 

On January 11, 2007, Six Flags announced that PARC Management would purchase the selection of parks previously put up for sale aside from Six Flags Magic Mountain for $312 million: $275 million cash and a note for $37 million. PARC subsequently sold the parks to CNL Lifestyle Properties in a deal that would allow PARC to manage the parks under a multi-year lease. Parks which had the Six Flags suffix in their name had it removed.

In June 2008, Six Flags leased operations of American Adventures to an independent company - Zuma Holdings LLC.

=== Bankruptcy ===
The company&#x27;s cash flow had decreased by over $120 million annually during the Shapiro years. In October 2008, Six Flags was warned its stock value had fallen below the required minimums to remain listed on the New York Stock Exchange. With the financial crisis of 2007–2008 weighing both on consumer spending and the ability to access credit facilities, Six Flags was believed to be unable to make a payment to preferred stockholders due in August 2009. Management saw the business as a sound one, noting that attendance across the company&#x27;s parks increased slightly in 2008 compared to 2007. Six Flags CEO Mark Shapiro said that the company&#x27;s problem was the declining attendance and cash flow created by his new management initiatives. If not resolved, the company warned in its 2008 annual report that the situation might require a Chapter 11 bankruptcy filing, with Six Flags already retaining counsel should that occur. The company stated at the time that it expected business to continue as normal in the event of such a filing, although one analyst believed attendance at the company&#x27;s parks would decrease by six percent, suggesting parents would be leery of letting their children ride a roller coaster operated by a bankrupt company. In April 2009, the New York Stock Exchange announced it would delist Six Flags&#x27; stock on April 20, a decision that the company did not intend to appeal. On June 1, 2009, Six Flags announced it would delay its $15 million debt payment further using a 30-day grace period. Less than two weeks later, on June 13, the firm filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection, but issued a statement that the parks would continue to operate normally while the company restructured. On August 21, 2009, Six Flags&#x27; Chapter 11 restructuring plan was announced in which lenders would control 92% of the company in exchange for canceling $1.13 billion in debt.
One component of the restructuring was negotiating a new lease agreement with the Kentucky State Fair Board, which owned much of the land and attractions for Six Flags Kentucky Kingdom. Six Flags had asked to forgo rent payments for the remaining nine years of its current lease agreement in exchange for profit-sharing from the park&#x27;s operations. When it appeared that the offer had been rejected, Six Flags announced in February 2010 that it would not re-open the park. However, the Kentucky State Fair Board stated at the time that they were still open to negotiating a revised lease agreement. The park later reopened under different management.

On April 28, 2010, the company&#x27;s bondholders reached an agreement on a reorganization plan. Junior note holders, including hedge funds Stark Investments and Pentwater Capital Management, assumed control of the company, while senior note holders were paid in cash. Despite objections from some parties who stood to gain nothing, the bankruptcy judge approved the plan on April 30, 2010. As part of the settlement, chairman of the board Dan Snyder was removed, while chief executive officer Mark Shapiro briefly remained in his post.

=== Emergence from bankruptcy ===
Six Flags officially emerged from bankruptcy protection as Six Flags Entertainment Corp. on May 3, 2010, and announced plans to issue new stock on the New York Stock Exchange. Amid suspected disagreements regarding the future of the company with the board, Shapiro left the company and Al Weber Jr. was brought in as interim president and CEO. The company announced that several corporate positions as well as the corporate headquarters would be relocated from New York City to Grand Prairie, Texas. The building that served as the new headquarters, was located in the Great Southwest Industrial District and was a converted warehouse that had been in use by Six Flags for office space as well as a corporate operations center. Six Flags kept a portion of the Midtown Manhattan office and currently maintains a presence in New York City at that same location.

=== Post-bankruptcy ===
Six Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson would replace Weber and become chairman, president and chief executive officer (CEO) on August 13, 2010. John Duffey also joined the company in 2010, taking the role of chief financial officer (CFO). As of October 1, 2012, Al Weber Jr. had retired as chief operating officer (COO) with no immediate successor.

In late 2010, Six Flags announced as part of their post-bankruptcy cost-cutting measures they would terminate non-Warner Bros. licenses from the parks, leading to attractions and areas based on Thomas the Tank Engine, The Wiggles, Tony Hawk, Evel Knievel, and &quot;Terminator&quot; being debranded.

On April 10, 2014, Six Flags announced a strategic partnership with Meraas Leisure and Entertainment (now known as DXB Entertainments) to build a Six Flags-branded theme park in Dubai, reviving the project. On June 23, 2014, Six Flags also announced a strategic partnership with Riverside Investment Group to build multiple Six Flags-branded theme parks in China over the decade.

On February 18, 2016, Six Flags announced that Jim Reid-Anderson had been promoted as executive chairman and John M. Duffey succeeded him as president and CEO. On January 11, 2016, Six Flags announced Six Flags Zhejiang, then named Six Flags Haiyan, in China. On the same day, a website was created along with concept art for the property. A month later on February 2, 2016. Six Flags announced Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Oaxtepec. The water park, originally named Parque Acuatico Oaxtepec, is a 76-acre park located in Morelos, Mexico that went bankrupt in 2011. On March 21, 2016, Six Flags announced a partnership with NaVi Entertainment to build a Six Flags-branded theme park and a Six Flags Hurricane Harbor-branded water park in Vietnam. On March 29, 2016, Six Flags announced the revival of its previously canceled Six Flags Dubai. As part of the second phase of the Dubai Parks and Resorts project in Jebel Ali, the park was expected to open in 2019. On July 20, 2016, Six Flags announced an agreement with Riverside Investment Group Co. Ltd. for the development of a second Six Flags-branded theme park in China together with a water park. The two parks will be located in Bishan District, a district of Chongqing.

On April 27, 2017, the company announced it would take over operations of Waterworld California in Concord, California, making it Six Flags&#x27; 20th property. On July 18, 2017, Six Flags announced that president and CEO John M. Duffey had retired from the company and Jim Reid-Anderson had re-assumed the roles of chairman, president and CEO. On May 18, 2017, Six Flags and Riverside Group signed an agreement with Paws, Inc. to use Garfield in children&#x27;s areas in Six Flags-branded theme parks in China.

On March 22, 2018, Six Flags and Riverside Group announced a partnership with Turner Asia Pacific to bring Tuzki and other Turner-owned IPs to its theme parks in China. On May 22, 2018, Six Flags announced the purchase of operating leases for five parks owned by EPR Properties. The parks are Darien Lake, Frontier City, Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild Phoenix, Wet&#x27;n&#x27;Wild SplashTown and White Water Bay, which were properties Six Flags formerly owned prior to 2007. On October 9, 2018, Six Flags and Rockford Park District announced a lease agreement allowing Six Flags to operate Magic Waters Waterpark beginning Spring 2019. On October 24, 2018, Six Flags announced that the future of its Six Flags Dubai theme park was &quot;uncertain&quot; following losses at the company and its partner DXB Entertainments.

On April 24, 2019, DXB Entertainments canceled Six Flags Dubai, stating that the development and establishment of a Six Flags theme park was not in the best interest of the company or its shareholders. Plans were made to direct the available proceeds to enhance the existing theme parks of Motiongate and Bollywood Parks. On October 2, 2019, Reuters reported that Six Flags Entertainment Corporation had approached competitor Cedar Fair with an acquisition offer. Sources said that Cedar Fair was considering Six Flags&#x27; cash-and-stock offer, but there was no certainty that a deal would be reached. On October 4, 2019, Cedar Fair rejected Six Flags&#x27; offer to purchase. On October 24, 2019, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced that Jim Reid-Anderson would retire and Mike Spanos would be president and CEO of the company on November 18, 2019.
On January 10, 2020, Six Flags indicated that its projects in China have not progressed as expected and could be canceled due to debt problems with its partner Riverside Investment Group. In January 2020, Six Flags finalized plans to move its corporate headquarters to the Centerfield Office Building at Globe Life Park in Arlington, Texas. The offices were remodeled over the summer and Six Flags personnel moved in during the last few months of the year. On March 13, 2020, with only a few parks already opened for the 2020 season, Six Flags announced that all its properties would suspend operations due to the COVID-19 pandemic. During the closure, parks donated supplies and food to their local communities.

As of August 2020, some Six Flags operations were still suspended. On May 13, Six Flags announced that when the parks reopen guests will be required to reserve their place online to enter the park, including purchasing their tickets to the park and parking. Six Flags Great Adventure opened its drive-through safari to the public on May 30. Frontier City became the first park of the company to reopen on June 5, with new health and safety protocols. Soon after Frontier City&#x27;s announcement, several other parks in the company announced their reopening dates. Starting on February 19, 2021, Six Flags had started gradually re-opening their amusement parks to the public for the upcoming season due to reduced COVID-19 restrictions, and by May of that year, all parks had successfully re-opened to the public.

On March 22, 2021, Six Flags announced that Six Flags Great America&#x27;s Hurricane Harbor park would be converted into a separate park, becoming Six Flags Hurricane Harbor Chicago. Since its opening in 2005, the park was a part of Great America, but in recent years had started charging a one-day ticket upgrade to access the park. The change into a separate park meant that Hurricane Harbor Chicago would become the 27th Six Flags park in the chain. On November 15, 2021, Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced that Mike Spanos had stepped down and Selim Bassoul, the former chairman of the board, would become president and CEO of the company effective immediately. Ben Baldanza, a former airlines industry executive, was elected to replace Bassoul as the chairman of the board.

=== Merger with Cedar Fair ===

On November 2, 2023, Cedar Fair and Six Flags Entertainment Corporation announced that they would merge; the combined company, worth an estimated $8 billion, will become the largest regional amusement park company in the world. Described as a &quot;merger of equals&quot;, the combined company will have 27 amusement parks, 15 water parks, and 9 resort properties in its portfolio, and it will operate under the Six Flags name. Despite the name, Cedar Fair will be the majority owners, with unitholders owning a 51% stake in the new company. President and CEO of Cedar Fair, Richard Zimmerman, will serve as president and CEO of the new combined company, while Selim Bassoul, President and CEO of Six Flags, will become the executive chairman of the company&#x27;s board of directors. The combined company&#x27;s new headquarters will be located in Charlotte, North Carolina, with significant administrative and finance operations being located at Cedar Fair&#x27;s former headquarters in Sandusky, Ohio. The merger was completed on July 1, 2024.

== Marketing efforts ==

=== TV commercials ===
In June 2003, Ackerman McQueen, who&#x27;d been handling advertising for Six Flags since 1994, lost the account to the Doner Company.

In 2004, although DC Comics and &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; as well as &quot;Scooby-Doo&quot; still had a major presence at the parks, Six Flags began a new series of commercials for the parks. The commercials introduced a new mascot, conceived by the Doner Company, &quot;Mr. Six&quot;, a seemingly feeble old man in a tuxedo and red bow tie. In many of the commercials, Mr. Six would slowly exit a multi-colored bus, only to start frenetically dancing to the Vengaboys&#x27; &quot;We Like to Party&quot;. The commercials were an immediate hit and Mr. Six almost instantly became the de facto mascot, and his presence was felt for years after the character was retired. These ads have become widely parodied on the Internet, with faces from other Internet memes being superimposed over Mr. Six&#x27;s face.

From 2008 to 2010, Six Flags&#x27; TV ads consisted of a &quot;Fun-O-Meter&quot; in which the beginning of the ad showed something boring or embarrassing, leading to a man&#x27;s face popping up judging it to be &quot;One Flag!&quot; or &quot;Oh! Two Flags!&quot;. Then roller coasters and attractions of Six Flags are shown and says &quot;Six Flags! More Flags, More Fun!&quot; for Six Flags parks. The thick accent of the Asian man in the original commercials drew criticism for being an offensive caricature. In 2009, the Mr. Six character came back from retirement and replaced the Asian man in Six Flags&#x27; ads, still using the Fun-O-Meter. In 2011, Six Flags&#x27; TV ads got a brand-new slogan &quot;Go Big! Go Six Flags!&quot; for its theme parks.

As part of Six Flags&#x27; effort to reopen theme parks in 2021 following the COVID-19 pandemic, Six Flags brought in a new slogan for both its social media and TV ads, &quot;The Thrill is Calling&quot;.

=== Licensing with other brands and companies ===
Six Flags has licensed its name and its theme park creations to other companies, who have used these assets to create licensed products. One notable example is the theme park simulation game &quot;Roller Coaster Tycoon 2&quot;, which featured recreations of Six Flags parks and rides that could be expanded and operated at the player&#x27;s discretion.

Six Flags has approximately 24 known current and past partners. These partners include Dole, Armitron, TCBY, Mrs. Fields, Famous Famiglia, Mike and Ike, Barcel, Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s, Good Humor, Nathan&#x27;s Famous, Coca-Cola, Icee, Ortega, Cold Stone Creamery, J&amp;J Snack Foods, Red Gold, Coppertone, Papa John&#x27;s, Panda Express, Johnny Rockets, Samsung, Dasani, Mars and Tyson Foods. These businesses help the park generate more income. Most importantly, it provides more jobs for prospective employees. For example, Barcel USA expanded its partnership in 2013. This helps to import food and beverages to increase sponsorships within the United States.

In 2008, Six Flags partnered with Brash Entertainment to create a video game based on the Six Flags parks named &quot;Six Flags Fun Park&quot;. The game was first released on the Nintendo DS on October 28, 2008. The Wii version was delayed while the PC and PlayStation 2 versions were canceled after Brash Entertainment went out of business. On February 24, 2009, the rights to the Wii version were taken over by Ubisoft, who released it on March 3, 2009. The game allows players to explore the themed areas and mini-games representative of a visit to a Six Flags park. In the game, players are tasked with quests that encourage them to explore the park&#x27;s universe. After creating a unique custom character, Six Flags Fun Park patrons can win prizes and compete with other players in 40 mini-games. Although the video game is called &quot;Six Flags Fun Park&quot;, it lacks any major reference of Six Flags outside of the names of the different areas. This caused some to speculate that the video game was created separately, then the rights to the name of the game were sold as a way to pay for the game&#x27;s development. The game was released as simply &quot;Fun Park&quot; and &quot;Fun Park Party&quot; in Europe on the DS and Wii respectively. When the game was released, it eventually ended up getting abysmal ratings across the board. IGN gave the Wii version a 4.5 out of 10, saying &quot;The quests are uninteresting and the game&#x27;s &#x27;40 Thrilling Games&#x27; (as touted by the box) are far from entertaining.&quot;

=== Other assets ===
On June 19, 2007, Six Flags announced it had purchased 40% of Dick Clark Productions, which owns rights to &quot;American Bandstand&quot; and other shows and productions. On September 28, 2012, Six Flags sold its stake in Dick Clark Productions. Additionally, Six Flags owns many other shares in various companies, like Nestle, Google, Mars Candy, and Coca-Cola.

==The Flash Pass==
The Flash Pass is an optional, pay-per-person virtual queue system offered at Six Flags amusement parks. The system, named after DC Comics character The Flash, allows guests to reserve places in line at participating attractions, and access must be purchased for a nominal fee in addition to the general park admission price. The first iteration, called Q-bot, was designed by Lo-Q and was first implemented at Six Flags Over Georgia in 2001. Guests are given handheld devices, which are then used to make reservations and receive notifications when it is their turn to ride. Another iteration is where guests can scan a QR code on in-park signs or through the mobile app, and guests can buy individual Flash Passes per ride or use their season pass or membership Flash Pass. This feature was adopted in 2021.

A water park version of the virtual system called Q-band was first tested at Six Flags White Water in 2011. Guests wear waterproof RFID wristbands that can be scanned at kiosks near participating water park attractions.

<text>The Tulu language (,Tigalari script: , Kannada script: , Malayalam script: ; ) is a Dravidian language whose speakers are concentrated in Dakshina Kannada and in the southern part of Udupi of Karnataka in south-western India and also in the northern parts of the Kasaragod district of Kerala. The native speakers of Tulu are referred to as &quot;Tuluva&quot; or Tulu people and the geographical area is unofficially called Tulu Nadu.

The Indian census report of 2011 reported a total of 1,846,427 native Tulu speakers in India. The 2001 census had reported a total of 1,722,768 native speakers. There is some difficulty in counting Tulu speakers who have migrated from their native region as they are often counted as Kannada speakers in Indian census reports.

Separated early from Proto-South Dravidian, Tulu has several features not found in Tamil–Kannada. For example, it has the pluperfect and the future perfect, like French or Spanish, but formed without an auxiliary verb.

Tulu is the primary spoken language in Tulu Nadu, consisting of the Dakshina Kannada and Udupi districts in the western part of Karnataka and the northern part of Kasaragod district of Kerala. A significant number of native Tulu speakers are found in Kalasa and Mudigere taluks of Chikkamagaluru district and Tirthahalli, Hosanagar of Shimoga district. Non-native speakers of Tulu include those who are residents in the Tulunadu region but who speak the Beary language, the Havyaka language and also Konkani and Koraga as their mother tongues. Apart from Tulu Nadu, a significant emigrant population of Tulu speakers are found in Maharashtra, Bangalore, Chennai, the English-speaking world, and the Gulf countries.

The various medieval inscriptions of Tulu from the 15th century are in the Tulu script. Two Tulu epics named &quot;Sri Bhagavato&quot; and &quot;Kaveri&quot; from the 17th century were also written in the same script. The Tulu language is known for its oral literature in the form of epic poems called &quot;pardana&quot;. The &quot;Epic of Siri&quot; and the legend of Koti and Chennayya belong to this category of Tulu literature.

==Classification==

Tulu belongs to the southern branch of the family of Dravidian languages. It was the first branch to split from Proto-South Dravidian, which in turn descends from Proto-Dravidian. Tulu shares many features with the central Dravidian languages. Therefore, in earlier branchings, Tulu was sometimes grouped with them; later, it was confirmed that it is from South Dravidian and that it was the first to split from it.

==Etymology==
The etymology of the word Tulu remains uncertain. Linguist P. Gururaja Bhat mentions in the book &quot;Tulunadu&quot;, that originated from the word (), where means &#x27;cow&#x27; and refers to the place dominated by the or cowherd () . 
Linguist () has suggested that the word means &#x27;that which is connected with water&#x27;. (jackfruit) means &#x27;watery&#x27; in Tulu. Other water-related words in Tulu include , , , , , and . In Kannada, there are words such as meaning &#x27;that which has characteristics of water&#x27; and .

== Official status ==
Tulu is not an official language of India or any other country. Efforts are being made to include Tulu in the 8th Schedule of the Constitution. In December 2009, during the First Vishwa Tulu Sammelan organized at Ujire-Dharmastala, then Karnataka Chief Minister B. S. Yediyurappa promised to send a fresh proposal on including the Tulu language in the eighth schedule of the constitution. In August 2017, an online campaign was organized to include Tulu in 8th schedule of constitution In October 2017, when prime minister Narendra Modi, visited Dharmasthala Temple the same demand was presented in front of him. Similarly, in 2018, a Member of Parliament from the Kasargod constituency, P. Karunakaran, also raised the same demand for inclusion of Tulu language in the 8th schedule of the constitution. On 19 February 2020, Vedavyas Kamath who is a member of the Mangaluru (south) segment of the Legislative Assembly, submitted a memorandum to chief minister B. S. Yediyurappa and to the minister for tourism, Kannada and culture, C. T. Ravi, seeking official status for the Tulu language. In February 2020, another MLA from Moodbidri Umanath Kotian urged the state government to put pressure on the union government to add the Tulu language to the eighth schedule during the assembly session. In July 2021, members of the three main parties in Karnataka politics: BJP, Congress and Janata Dal (Secular), lent their support to the idea.

==History==
The oldest available inscriptions in Tulu are from the period between 7th and 8th century AD. These inscriptions are in the Tulu script and are found in areas in and around Barkur which was the capital of Tulu Nadu during the Vijayanagar period. Another group of inscriptions is found in the &quot;Ullur&quot; &quot;Subrahmanya&quot; Temple near Kundapura. Many linguists like S.U. Panniyadi and L. V. Ramaswami Iyer as well as P.S. Subrahmanya suggested that Tulu is among the oldest languages in the Dravidian family which branched independently from its Proto-Dravidian roots nearly 2500 years ago. This assertion is based on the fact that Tulu still preserves many aspects of the Proto-Dravidian language.

This dating of Tulu is also based on the fact that the region where Tulu is natively spoken was known to the ancient Tamils as Tulu Nadu. Also, the Tamil poet Mamular who belongs to the Sangam Age (200 BCE) describes Tulu Nadu and its dancing beauties in one of his poems. In the poetical work &quot;Akananuru,&quot; belonging to the Sangam literature (circa 300 BCE), there is a mention of Tulunad in its 15th poem. This indicates that the Tulu language is at least around 2,300 years old. In the Kannada Halmidi inscriptions, one finds mention of the Tulu country as the kingdom of the Alupas. The region was also known to the Greeks of the 2nd century as &quot;Tolokoyra&quot; (Tulu Country). The Charition mime, a Greek play belonging to the 2nd century BC, has its plot centered around the coastal Karnataka, where Tulu is mainly spoken. The play is mostly in Greek, but the Indian characters in the play are seen speaking a language different from Greek. There is considerable ambiguity regarding the Indian language in the play, though all scholars agree the Indian language is Dravidian, there is considerable dispute over which form of it. Noted German Indologist E. Hultzsch (1857–1927) was the first to suggest that the language was Dravidian. The dispute regarding the language in the play is yet to be settled, but scholars agree that the dispute arises from the fact that Old Kannada, Old Tamil, and Tulu during the time when the play was written were perhaps dialectical variations of the same , and that over the years they evolved into their present forms as separate languages.

=== Status ===
Found largely in Karnataka, it is spoken primarily within the Indian state. Dating back several hundred years, the language has developed numerous defining qualities. The Tulu people follow a saying which promotes leaving negative situations and finding newer, more positive ones. The language, however, is not as popular as others which means it could become endangered and extinct very soon. The influence of other mainstream languages is a present danger for the Tulu language. Today, it is spoken by nearly 1.8 million people around the globe. Large parts of the language are altered and changed constantly because it is commonly passed down through oral tradition. Oral traditions within Tulu have meant that certain phrases have not always maintained the same meaning or importance.

==Geographic distribution==

According to Malayalam works like the Keralolpathi, the region stretching from the Chandragiri river, now part of the Kasaragod district, Kerala, to Gokarna, now part of Uttara Kannada district of Karnataka, was ruled by the Alupas and was known as Alva Kheda. This kingdom was the homeland of the Tulu-speaking people. 
However, the present-day Tulu linguistic majority area is confined to the region of Tulu Nadu, which comprises the districts of part of Dakshina Kannada and Udupi in the Indian state of Karnataka and the northern part of Kasaragod district of Kerala up to the river Payaswani, also known as Chandragiri. The cities of Mangalore, Udupi and Kasaragod are the centres of Tulu culture.

Even today Tulu is widely spoken in the Dakshina Kannada, partially in Udupi district of Karnataka state and to some extent in Kasaragod of Kerala. Efforts are also being made to include Tulu in the list of official languages of India. As a whole, Tulu is largely contained to the southern part of India. The Indian state of Karnataka is where the language seems to thrive in the present day. Some of the major cities within the Tulu culture include Mangalore and Kasaragod.

==Writing system==
The various historical inscriptions of Tulu found around Barkur and Kundapura are in the Tigalari script. Historically, Brahmins of Tulu Nadu and Havyaka Brahmins used the Tigalari script to write Vedas and other Sanskrit works. The Tulu script is descended from the Brahmi through the Grantha script. It is a sister script of the Malayalam script. However, very few works written in vernacular languages like Kannada and Tulu are available. Hence, the Tulu script was employed by Tulu Brahmins to write Tulu and Kannada languages apart from the Kannada script. The National Mission for Manuscripts has conducted several workshops on this script with the help of a scholar, Keladi Gunda Jois. In the 18th century, the use of the Kannada script for writing Tulu and non-availability of print in the Tulu script contributed to the marginalization of the Ruling Tulu script. The script is studied by few scholars and manuscriptologists for research and religious purposes. The Kannada script has become the contemporary script for the Tulu language gradually. All contemporary works and literature are done in the Kannada script.

The Tulu characterset is approved by Central Institute of Indian Languages in 2021. 

The Tulu alphabet resembles the Malayalam script. They are from the same region in the state of Karnataka. The Tulu and Kannada alphabets include a stress on vowels with &quot;a&quot; and &quot;o&quot; sounds. Other vowels include sounds such as &quot;au&quot; &quot;am&quot; and &quot;ah&quot;. Numerous consonants have their own origin from the Dravidian languages like &quot;kha&quot; &quot;gha&quot; &quot;dha&quot; and &quot;jha&quot;. These are derived from the Tulu alphabet.

==Dialects==
Tulu language has four dialects:

;Common Tulu
:Spoken by the majority includes the Bunts, Billava,Vishwakarma, Mogaveera, Tulu Madivala (Madialnakl), Tulu Gowda, Kulala, Devadiga, Jogi, Padmashali communities and others. This is the dialect of commerce, trade and entertainment and is mainly used for inter-community communication. It is further subdivided into eight groups:
:#Northwest Tulu: spoken in Udupi
:#Central Tulu: spoken in Mangalore
:#Northeast Tulu: spoken in Karkala and Belthangady
:#Northern Tulu: spoken in Kundapura, also known as KundaTulu because of Kundagannada dialect influence
:#Southwest Tulu: spoken in Manjeshwar and Kasaragod, known as Kasaragod Tulu influencing Malayalam
:#Southcentral Tulu: spoken in Bantwal
:#Southeast Tulu: Spoken in Puttur Sullia and in some villages/Taluks of Coorg (Kodagu). 
:#Southern Tulu: spoken in South of Kasaragod and Payaswini (Chandragiri) river influencing Malayalam known as Thenkaayi Tulu
;Brahmin Tulu
:Spoken by the Tulu Brahmins who are subdivided into Shivalli Brahmins, Sthanika Brahmins and Tuluva Hebbars. It is more influenced by Sanskrit.
;Jain dialect
:Spoken by the Tulu Jains. It is a dialect where the initial letters &#x27;T&#x27; and &#x27;S&#x27; have been replaced by the letter &#x27;H&#x27;. For example, the word is pronounced as , is pronounced as .
;Adivasi dialect
:Spoken by the Koraga, Mansa, and other tribals of Tulu Nadu

==Phonology==
=== Vowels ===
Five short and five long vowels (&quot;a&quot;, &quot;ā&quot;, &quot;e&quot;, &quot;ē&quot;, &quot;u&quot;, &quot;ū&quot;, &quot;i&quot;, &quot;ī&quot;, &quot;o&quot;, &quot;ō&quot;) are common in Dravidian languages. Like Kodava Takk (and also like Konkani and Sinhala), Tulu also has an like vowel, generally occurring word-finally which is from the old ai. The Kannada script does not have a symbol to specifically represent this vowel, which is often written as a normal &quot;e&quot;. For example, the first person singular form and the third person singular masculine of a verb are spelled identically in all tenses, both ending in &quot;e&quot;, but are pronounced differently: the terminating &quot;e&quot; in the former sounds nearly like ‘a’ in the English word ‘man’ ( , &quot;I make&quot;), while that in the latter like ‘e’ in ‘men’ ( , &quot;he makes&quot;).

In his grammar of 1932, S. U. Paniyadi used a special vowel sign to denote Tulu /ɛ/ in the Kannada script: according to Bhat, he used two s for this purpose (usually, a means the crest that a Kannada character like has), and the same convention was adopted by Upadhyaya in his 1988 Tulu Lexicon. The long counterpart of this vowel occurs in some words. In all dialects, the pair /e/ and /ɛ/ contrasts.

Additionally, like Kodava Takk and Toda, and like Malayalam and Tamil , Tulu has an -like vowel (or schwa ) as a phoneme, which is romanized as &quot;ŭ&quot; (ISO), &quot;ɯ&quot;, or &quot;u̥&quot;. Both J. Brigel and A. Männer say that it is pronounced like &quot;e&quot; in the French &quot;je&quot;. Bhat describes this phoneme as /ɯ/. However, if it is like Malayalam &quot;half-u&quot;, or may be a better description. /ɛ/ formed from previous ai and previous /u/ split into modern /u, ɯ/; long versions of /ɛ, ɯ/ are extremely restricted. In the Kannada script, Brigel and Männer used a virama (halant) () to denote /ɯ/ like in Malayalam. Bhat says a is used for this purpose, but apparently he too means a virama.

Tulu is characterized by its rounding of front vowels when between a labial and a retroflex consonant, e.g., PD. &quot;∗peṇ&quot; &gt; Tamil &quot;peṇ&quot;, Kannada &quot;heṇṇu&quot;, Tulu &quot;poṇṇu&quot;, this feature also occurs in Kodava and Spoken Tamil e.g. Kodava , Spoken Tamil &quot;poṇṇï&quot;, exceptions include &quot;{tū, sū}, buttu, pili,&quot; Tamil &quot;tī, vittu, puli.&quot;

=== Consonants ===
The following are consonant phonemes in Tulu:
The contrast between and is preserved in the South Common dialect and in the Brahmin dialect, but is lost in several dialects. Additionally, the Brahmin dialect has and . Aspirated consonants are sometimes used in the Brahmin dialect, but are not phonemic. In the Koraga and Holeya dialects, &quot;s&quot; and &quot;ś&quot; merge with &quot;c&quot; (the Koraga dialect of the Tulu language is different from the Koraga language). Word-initial consonant clusters are rare and occur mainly in Sanskrit loanwords.

Tulu is characterized by its r/l and s/c/t alternation, for e.g. &quot;sarɛ, tarɛ&quot; across Tulu dialects compare with Kannada &quot;tale&quot;. The alveolar ṯ, ṯṯ, nṯ became post alveolar or dental, the singular ones usually becomes a trill in other Dravidian languages, e.g. Tamil &quot;oṉṟu, āṟu, nāṟu, nāṟṟam, muṟi, kīṟu;&quot; Tulu &quot;oñji, āji, nāduni, nāta, {mudipuni, muyipuni}, {kīruni, gīcuni}.&quot; The retroflex approximant mostly became a /ɾ/ and also /ɭ, ɖ/, e.g. Tamil &quot;ēẓu, puẓu,&quot; Tulu &quot;{ēḷŭ, ēlŭ, ēḍŭ}, puru.&quot;

== Grammar ==
===Morphology===
Tulu has five parts of speech: nouns (substantives and adjectives), pronouns, numerals, verbs, and particles.

Substantives have three grammatical genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter), two numbers (singular and plural), and eight cases (nominative, genitive, dative, accusative, locative, ablative or instrumental, communicative, and vocative). According to Bhat, Tulu has two distinct locative cases. The communicative case is used with verbs like &quot;tell&quot;, &quot;speak&quot;, &quot;ask&quot;, &quot;beseech&quot;, &quot;inquire&quot;, and denotes at whom a message, an inquiry, or a request is aimed, as in &quot;I told &quot;him&quot;.&quot; or &quot;I speak &quot;to them&quot;.&quot; It is also used to denote the relationship with whom it is about, in a context like &quot;I am on good terms &quot;with him&quot;.&quot; or &quot;I have nothing &quot;against him&quot;.&quot; Bhat calls it the sociative case. It is somewhat similar to the comitative case, but different in that it denotes communication or relationship, not physical companionship. The plural suffix is &quot;-rŭ&quot;, &quot;-ḷu&quot;, &quot;-kuḷu&quot;, or &quot;-āḍḷu&quot;; as in (&#x27;table&#x27;), (&#x27;tables&#x27;). The nominative case is unmarked, while the remaining cases are expressed by different suffixes.

The following table shows the declension of a noun, based on Brigel and Bhat (&quot;u̥&quot; used by Brigel and &quot;ɯ&quot; used by Bhat are both shown as &quot;ŭ&quot; for clarity): when two forms are given, the one in parentheses is by Bhat, and the other is by Brigel. Some of these differences may be dialectal variations.

The personal pronouns are irregularly inflected: &#x27;I&#x27; becomes &quot;yen-&quot; in oblique cases. Tulu makes the distinction between the inclusive and exclusive &quot;we&quot; (see &quot;Clusivity: Dravidian languages&quot;): &#x27;we (including you)&#x27; as opposed to &#x27;we (not including you)&#x27;. For verbs, this distinction does not exist. The personal pronouns of the second person are (oblique: ) &#x27;you (singular)&#x27; and &#x27;you (plural)&#x27;. Three genders are distinguished in the third person, as well as proximate and remote forms. For example, &#x27;he (proximate)&#x27;, &#x27;he (remote)&#x27;. The suffix &quot;-rŭ&quot; makes a polite form of personal pronouns, as in &#x27;you (respectfully)&#x27;, &#x27;he (remote; respectfully)&#x27;.
Postpositions are used usually with a noun in the genitive case, as in &#x27;on the hill&#x27;.

Tulu verbs have three forms: active, causative, and reflexive (or middle voice).
They conjugate for person, number, gender, tense (present, past, pluperfect, future, and future perfect), mood (indicative, imperative, conditional, infinitive, potential, and subjunctive), and polarity (positive and negative).

=== Syntax ===
Each sentence is composed of a subject and a predicate and every sentence is a full speech or thought in words. There is both singular and plural while being expressed in first through third person. There are several exceptions to each of these depending on the instance. For example: the verb has to be in a plural style if there are numerous nominatives within a sentence or of different genders that agree with the previous sentence. The verb may also be omitted in some sentences. Present tense and past tense may change and their perception.

==Written literature==
The written literature of Tulu is not as large as the literature of other literary Dravidian languages . Nevertheless, Tulu is one of only five literary Dravidian languages, the other four being Tamil, Telugu, Kannada and Malayalam. The earliest available Tulu literature that survives to this date is the Tulu translation of the great Sanskrit epic of Mahabharata called (). It was written by &quot;Arunabja&quot; (1657 AD), a poet who lived in Kodavur near Udupi around the late 14th to early 15th century AD.
Other important literary works in Tulu are:
* Devi Mahatmyam&#x27;s () 1200 AD – Tulu translation
* Sri Bhagavata () 1626 AD – written by Vishnu Tunga
* Kaveri (1391 AD)

This script was mainly used to write religious and literary works in Sanskrit. Even today the official script of the eight Tulu monasteries (Ashta Mathas of Udupi) founded by Madhvacharya in Udupi is Tulu. The pontiffs of the monasteries write their names using this script when they are appointed.

Modern-day Tulu literature is written using the Kannada script. &quot;Mandara Ramayana&quot; is the most notable piece of modern Tulu literature. Written by Mandara Keshava Bhatt, it received the Sahitya Akademi Award for best poetry. &quot;Madipu&quot;, &quot;Mogaveera&quot;, &quot;Saphala&quot; and &quot;Samparka&quot; are popular Tulu periodicals published from Mangalore. The Tulu Sahitya Academy, established by the state government of Karnataka in 1994, as also the Kerala Tulu Academy established by the Indian State Government of Kerala in Manjeshwaram in 2007, are important governmental organisations that promote Tulu literature. Nevertheless, there are numerous organisations spread all over the world with significant Tulu-migrated populations that contribute to Tulu literature. Some notable contributors to Tulu literature are Kayyar Kinhanna Rai, M. K. Seetharam Kulal, Amruta Someshwara, B. A. Viveka Rai, Kedambadi Jattappa Rai, Venkataraja Puninchathaya, Paltadi Ramakrishna Achar, Dr. Sunitha M. Shetty, Dr. Vamana Nandavara, Sri. Balakrishna Shetty Polali.
==Oral traditions==
The oral traditions of Tulu are one of the major traditions that greatly show the finer aspects of the language. The following are various forms of Tulu oral tradition and literature.

*Paddanas: A form of oral epic poem sung in a highly stylised manner during the Hindu rituals of Bhuta Kola and Nagaradhane, which are peculiar to the Tulu people. These Paddanas are mostly legends about gods or historical personalities among the people. The longest of them being Siri Paddana, which is about a woman called Siri who shows strength and integrity during adverse times and in turn attains divinity. The Paddana greatly depicts the independent nature of the Tulu womenfolk. The entire Paddana was written down by Finnish scholar Lauri Honko of the University of Turku and it falls four lines short of Homer&#x27;s Iliad.
*Riddles: They are another important aspect of Tulu oral traditions. These riddles are largely tongue twisting and mostly deal with kinship and agriculture.
*Bhajans: Bhajans sung in numerous temples across the Tulu region are varied and are dedicated to various gods and goddesses. Most of these are of the Hindu tradition, others being Jain. They are sung in both the Carnatic style as well a style similar to what is used in Yakshagana.
*Kabitol: Songs sung during the cultivation of crops, the traditional occupation of the people. O Bele is considered the finest among them.

==Theatre==

Theatre in the form of the traditional Yakshagana, prevalent in coastal Karnataka and northern Kerala has greatly preserved the finer aspects of the Tulu language. Yakshagana which is conducted in Tulu is very popular among the Tuluva people. It can also be seen as a form of temple art, as there are many Yakshagana groups that are attached to temples, for example that of Kateel Durga Parameshwari Temple as also the Udupi Krishna Temple.

Presently, eight professional Yakshagana troupes perform Tulu-language Yakshagana not only during the Yakshagana season but also during the off-season in various places in Karnataka and outside. In Mumbai, Tulu Yakshagana is very popular among the Tulu audiences. More than 2,000 Yakshagana artistes take part in the performance in various places in Mumbai annually. Notable performers include Kalladi Koraga Shetty, Pundur Venkataraja Puninchathaya, Guru Bannanje Sanjiva Suvarna and Pathala Venkatramana Bhat.

Tulu plays are among the major entertainment for admirers of art and culture in Tulu Nadu. Tulu plays, generally centered on the comic genre, are very popular in Mumbai and Bangalore outside Tulu Nadu.

==Tulu cinema==

The Tulu cinema industry is fairly small; it produces around five films annually. The first film, &quot;Enna Thangadi&quot;, was released in 1971. Usually these films are released in theatres across the Tulu Nadu region and on DVD. The critically acclaimed film &quot;Suddha&quot; won the award for Best Indian Film at the Osian&#x27;s Cinefan Festival of Asian and Arab Cinema in New Delhi in 2006. As of 2015, &quot;Oriyardori Asal&quot; (2011) has been the most commercially successful Tulu film. Chaali Polilu is the longest-running film in Tulu film history, as well as the highest-grossing film in the Tulu film industry. It has successfully completed 470 days at PVR Cinemas in Mangalore. The 2014 film &quot;Madime&quot; was reported to be remade in Marathi, thereby becoming the first Tulu film to be remade in another language. &quot;Shutterdulai&quot; was the first remake in Tulu cinema. &quot;Eregla Panodchi&quot; is the second remake in Tulu cinemas. A suit for damages of Rs. 25 lakh was filed against the makers of the Telugu film &quot;Brahmotsavam&quot; for copying the first 36 seconds of the song by Dr. Vamana Nandaavara found in the &quot;Deepanalike&quot; CD composed for the Siri channel. &quot;Prajavani&quot; reported that with its dubbing rights sold to Hindi for Rs. 21 lakh, the 2018 movie &quot;Umil&quot; became the first Tulu movie to achieve the feat. Ashwini Kotiyan (Chaya Harsha) became the first female director in the Tulu industry after directing and releasing her first movie &quot;Namma Kudla&quot;. &quot;Brahmashree Narayana Guruswamy&quot; released on 2 May 2014 was the 50th Tulu film. &quot;Panoda Bodcha&quot; marked the 75th release anniversary of a Tulu film. The 100th Tulu movie &quot;Karne&quot; was released on 16 November 2018.

Guddada Bhootha, a television series aired in 1990, was one of the successful ventures of Tulu entertainment. This mini-series has a suspense storyline based on a Tulu drama, showing the country life of Tulu Nadu region of India. It was one of the popular TV series of that time. This series has a very famous title song &quot;Dennana Dennana&quot; sung by B. R. Chaya. This song along with the music were used in Rangitaranga, a Kannada movie.

==Centres of Tulu study and research==

Tulu as a language continues to thrive in coastal Karnataka and Kasaragod in Kerala. Karnataka Tulu Sahitya Academy, an institute established by the state government of Karnataka in 1994, has introduced Tulu as a language in schools around coastal Karnataka, including Alva&#x27;s High School, Moodbidri; Dattanjaneya High School, Odiyoor; Ramakunjeshwara English-medium High School, Ramakunja; and Vani Composite Pre-University College, Belthangady. Initially started in 16 schools, the language is now taught in over 33 schools, of which 30 are in Dakshina Kannada district. More than 1500 students have opted to study this language.

The Government of Kerala established the Kerala Tulu Academy in 2007. The academy focuses on the retrieval and propagation of Tulu language and culture in Kerala through various activities such as organising seminars and publishing Tulu periodicals, etc. The academy is based in Hosangadi, Manjeshwar in Kasaragod.
Tulu is also taught as a language at the post-graduate level in Mangalore University, and there is a dedicated department for Tulu studies, translation and research at Dravidian University in Kuppam Andhra Pradesh.The Government Degree College at Kasaragod in Kerala also introduced a certificate course in Tulu for the academic year 2009–2010. It has also introduced Tulu as an optional subject in its Kannada post-graduation course. It has adopted syllabi from the books published by the Tulu Sahitya Academy.

German missionaries Kammerer and Männer were the first people to conduct research on the language. Kammerer collected about 3,000 words and their meanings before his death. Later his work was carried on by Männer, who completed the research and published the first dictionary of the Tulu language in 1886 with the help of the then-Madras government. The effort was incomplete, as it did not cover all aspects of the language. The Govinda Pai Research Centre at MGM College, Udupi started an 18-year Tulu lexicon project in the year 1979.

Different dialects, special vocabularies used for different occupational activities, rituals, and folk literature in the forms of Paād-danāas were included in this project. The Centre has also released a six-volume, trilingual, modestly priced Tulu-Kannada-English lexicon. The Tulu lexicon was awarded the Gundert Award for the best dictionary in the country in 1996. In September 2011, the Academic Council of Mangalore University accepted a proposal, to allow the university and the colleges affiliated to it to offer certificates, diplomas and postgraduate diploma courses in Tulu, both in regular and correspondence modes.

<text>Increase Allen Lapham (c. 1811 – September 14, 1875) was an American writer, scientist, and naturalist, whose work focused primarily on the what is now the U.S. state of Wisconsin. He made maps of the area and published numerous books on the archaeology, biology, and geology of the region, and discovered both the Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound and Milwaukee Formation. He founded the Wisconsin Natural History Association, and served as the state&#x27;s Chief Geologist for two years. He also lobbied Congress and the Smithsonian Institution to establish an agency to predict the weather around the Great Lakes and this became the National Weather Service.

==Biography==

Born in Palmyra, New York, his family moved to Pennsylvania, back to New York, to Ohio then to Louisville, Kentucky (1827–1830) then back to Ohio while his father, Seneca Lapham, worked on the canals in various locations. Lapham was of entirely English ancestry, all of which had been in what is now the United States since the early 1600s. His ancestors were among the first English colonists to establish Rhode Island. He displayed a talent for scientific observation early on while working on the canals and their locks, producing drawings that he could sell at the age of thirteen.

In July 1836, Lapham moved to Kilbourntown (which soon incorporated into the city of Milwaukee, Wisconsin) and worked closely with Byron Kilbourn in his business and development endeavors. The two had worked together previously on the Miami Canal and Lapham considered him a loyal friend and mentor. Before the end of the year, Lapham had published a &quot;Catalogue of Plants and Shells, Found in the vicinity of Milwaukee, on the West Side of Lake Michigan&quot;, perhaps the first scientific work published west of the Great Lakes.
In 1848, Lapham founded the Wisconsin Natural History Association, a predecessor of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters, of which he also was a charter member. 

Many of his works and early maps were used for various civil projects such as canal and railroad development. In 1844 Lapham published the first substantial book on the geography of the Wisconsin Territory. His first map of Wisconsin was made in 1846. He published many more papers and books through his life, particularly on geology, archaeology and history, and flora and fauna of Wisconsin, including publication by the Smithsonian Institution.

In 1850, he discovered the Panther Intaglio Effigy Mound, which is now listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Lapham was elected a member of the American Antiquarian Society in 1853, and he was Chief Geologist of the State of Wisconsin from 1873 to 1875. He was elected as a member to the American Philosophical Society in 1874.

Lapham was one of the first people to recognize the cement potential of certain rock strata seen along the banks of the Milwaukee River. Those strata, now known as belonging to the Milwaukee Formation, were later mined for high quality natural hydraulic cement. Milwaukee thus went on to become the country&#x27;s leading producer of natural hydraulic cement from 1876 to 1910.

==Honors==
Lapham is considered &quot;Wisconsin&#x27;s first great scientist&quot; and the &quot;Father of the U.S Weather Service,&quot; based upon his lobbying to Congress and the Smithsonian Institution to create such an agency to forecast storms on the Great Lakes and both coasts. When the agency was created through the U.S. Secretary of War, Lapham made the first such accurate Great Lakes storm warning from Chicago.

Since his death, numerous landmarks throughout the southeastern Wisconsin area have been named after him, including Lapham Peak, the highest point in Waukesha County, Wisconsin, a major University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee building, and streets. In Madison, Wisconsin, he currently has an elementary school named after him.

A genus of North American plants, &quot;Laphamia&quot;, was named for him by Asa Gray. Several species of invertebrates from the Paleozoic rocks of Wisconsin, such as &quot;Nuculites laphami&quot; (Cleland, 1911) and &quot;Ekwanoscutellum laphami&quot; (Whitfield, 1877), were also named in honor of him. Certain markings found on iron meteors were designated by J. Lawrence Smith as &quot;Laphamite markings&quot;. A formerly existing glacial lake was provisionally named &quot;Lake Lapham&quot;. The Wisconsin Archeological Society awards the Lapham Research Medal, first doing so in 1926. The U.S. Navy named a ship SS Increase A. Lapham during World War II. The University of Wisconsin has an Increase A. Lapham Professorship. Lapham was inducted in 1992 into the Wisconsin Conservation Hall of Fame and in 2003 into the Wisconsin Forestry Hall of Fame.

The centennial of Lapham&#x27;s birth was celebrated in 1911. In 2011, celebration of the bicentennial was planned, including an Increase A. Lapham Day at Aztalan State Park.

Lapham Junction () in Knapp, Jackson County, Wisconsin, is now defunct railroad junction on the Goodyear branch of the Milwaukee Road which branch ran to Zeda, where lumbering operations took place, and was named for Lapham.

<text>Same-sex marriage has been legal in the Netherlands since 1 April 2001. A bill for the legalisation of same-sex marriage was passed in the House of Representatives by 109 votes to 33 on 12 September 2000 and by the Senate by 49 votes to 26 on 19 December 2000. The law received royal assent by Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands on 21 December 2000 and took effect on 1 April 2001. The Netherlands was the first country in the world to legalize same-sex marriage. Polling suggests that a significant majority of Dutch people support the legal recognition of same-sex marriage.

Same-sex marriage has been legal in Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, special municipalities of the Netherlands, since 10 October 2012, and in the constituent countries of Aruba and Curaçao since 12 July 2024. The other constituent country of the Kingdom of the Netherlands, Sint Maarten, does not perform or fully recognize same-sex marriages.

==Unregistered partnerships==
Unregistered partnerships or informal cohabitation () occur when a same-sex or opposite-sex couple cohabits but chooses to keep the legal status of their relationship unregistered or informal. This means all worldwide assets that belong to a single party remain the sole property of the party with no legal entitlement by the other party, whether owned before or acquired during the relationship. The couple can record a contract () with a notary to receive some limited financial benefits, including for tax and pension purposes. However, the benefits are limited, e.g. the father or non-biological mother is not automatically recognized as a parent after the birth of a child, and upon the death of one of the partners, the other partner is not considered an heir. This legal status of unregistered partnerships is respected by Dutch courts.

The Netherlands was one of the first countries in the world to recognise cohabiting same-sex couples by law. The first law recognising the cohabitation of same-sex couples was passed in 1979 for the purposes of rent law. Further legislation was passed in 1981 to recognise cohabiting couples for the purposes of inheritance tax.

==Registered partnerships==
On 1 January 1998, registered partnerships (, ) were introduced in Dutch law. The partnerships were meant for same-sex couples as an alternative to marriage, though they can also be entered into by opposite-sex couples, and in fact about one third of the registered partnerships between 1999 and 2001 were of opposite-sex couples. In law, registered partnerships and marriage convey the same rights and duties, especially after some laws were changed to remedy inequalities with respect to inheritance and some other issues.

Partnerships have become particularly common among Dutch couples, with about 18,000 new partnerships registered every year.

==Same-sex marriage==

===Legislative action===
As early as the mid 1980s, a group of gay rights activists, headed by Henk Krol – then editor-in-chief of the &quot;Gay Krant&quot; – asked the government to allow same-sex couples to marry. By 1995, about 100 municipalities had opened an alternative &quot;marriage register&quot;, into which some 300 same-sex couples had inscribed. That year, the municipality of Rheden said that if government did not legalize same-sex marriage it would proceed with conducting same-sex weddings. Haarlem declared it would do the same or stop issuing marriage licenses altogether. The States General of the Netherlands decided in 1995 to create a special commission to investigate the possibility of recognizing same-sex marriages. At that time, the Christian Democratic Appeal was not part of the ruling coalition for the first time since the introduction of full democracy. The special commission finished its work in 1997 and concluded that civil marriage should be extended to include same-sex couples. After the 1998 general election, the Second Kok Cabinet promised to tackle the issue. In September 2000, the legislation was debated in the Dutch Parliament.

The marriage bill passed the House of Representatives by 109 votes to 33 on 12 September 2000.

The Senate approved the bill on 19 December 2000 by 49 to 26 votes. Only the Christian parties, which held 26 of the 75 seats at the time, voted against the bill. Although the Christian Democratic Appeal would form the next government, they did not indicate any intention to repeal the law.

Queen Beatrix of the Netherlands gave her royal assent to the legislation on 21 December 2000. The main article of the law changed article 1:30 of the Civil Code to read as follows:

:(&quot;A marriage can be entered into by two persons of different or the same sex&quot;)

The law came into effect on 1 April 2001, and on that day four same-sex couples were married by the Mayor of Amsterdam, Job Cohen, who became a registrar specifically to officiate at the weddings. A few months earlier, Mayor Cohen had been junior Minister of Justice of the Netherlands and was responsible for putting the new marriage and adoption laws through Parliament.

In Dutch, same-sex marriage is known as or more commonly as ().

===Requirements and rights===

Dutch law requires that either partner have Dutch nationality or have residency in the Netherlands. The marriageable age in the Netherlands is 18. The law is only valid in the European territory of the Netherlands and on the Caribbean islands of Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba, but does not apply to the other constituent countries of the Kingdom of the Netherlands.

The single legal difference between same-sex marriages and heterosexual marriages was that, in the former case, parentage by both partners was not automatic. The legal mother of a child is its biological mother (article 1:198 of the civil law) and the father is (in principle) the man she is married to or in a registered partnership with when the child is born. Moreover, the father must be a man (article 1:199). The other partner could thus become a legal mother only through adoption. Only in the case when a biological father did not become a parent (e.g. in case of artificial insemination by lesbian couples) would both female spouses obtain parental authority automatically (article 1:253sa). In December 2013, the Dutch Parliament changed this and allowed automatic parenthood for lesbian couples. The new law, which came into effect on 1 April 2014, allows the co-mother who is married to or in a registered partnership with the biological mother to be automatically recognized as a legal mother if the sperm donor was initially anonymous. In the case of a known donor, the biological mother decides whether the donor or the co-mother is the child&#x27;s second legal parent.

On 6 April 2016, Minister of Foreign Affairs Bert Koenders and Minister of Security and Justice Ard van der Steur confirmed the Dutch position that, like other couples, same-sex couples who are not Dutch residents or nationals cannot marry in the country. The ministers argued that it might lead to &quot;practical and legal problems&quot; and could even be &quot;dangerous&quot; to some participants. The move came after the Liberal Democratic Party had asked the ministers to look into allowing non-resident foreigners to take advantage of the Netherlands&#x27; same-sex marriage law.

===Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten===
Aruba, Curaçao and Sint Maarten have separate civil codes from the Netherlands proper, and thus same-sex marriage was not automatically legalised in these constituent countries by the 2001 law. It only became possible to perform same-sex marriages in Aruba and Curaçao on 12 July 2024 in accordance with a Supreme Court ruling. This makes Sint Maarten the only constituent country where same-sex marriages cannot be performed, though Dutch marriages are recognized there to some degree.

On 12 July 2024, the Supreme Court of the Netherlands upheld a lower court ruling that the same-sex marriage bans in Aruba and Curaçao were discriminatory, effectively legalising same-sex marriages in those two constituent countries. Additionally, all territories of the Kingdom of the Netherlands register same-sex marriages performed in the Netherlands proper as a result of a Supreme Court ruling. In 2007, the Supreme Court ruled that all vital records recorded in the Kingdom of the Netherlands are valid throughout the Kingdom; this was based on its interpretation of the Charter for the Kingdom of the Netherlands. However, subsequent rulings have established that same-sex marriages are not automatically entitled to the same privileges (e.g. social security) extended to married couples of the opposite sex.

Aruba has also recognised registered partnerships offering several of the rights and benefits of marriage for same-sex and opposite-sex couples since September 2021. Curaçao and Sint Maarten do not perform registered partnerships.

===Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba===
Same-sex marriage became legal in the Caribbean Netherlands—Bonaire, Sint Eustatius and Saba—following the entry into force of a law enabling same-sex couples to marry on 10 October 2012.

===Opposition===
In 2007, controversy arose when the new Fourth Balkenende Cabinet announced in its policy statement that officials who object to same-sex marriage on principle may refuse to marry such couples. Some Labour and GroenLinks dominated municipal councils opposed this policy, claiming that the job of a registrar is to marry all couples, not only opposite-sex couples. The opposition parties stated that if a registrar opposed same-sex marriages, they should not hold that post. The municipality of Amsterdam announced that they would not comply with this policy, and that registrars there would still be obliged to marry same-sex couples. In reaction to this, many other municipalities announced their rejection of this proposal as well. The cabinet claimed that this issue lay solely within the remit of the central government. In practice, municipalities could decide whether or not to hire registrars who object to marrying same-sex couples.

Before 2014, civil servants could refuse to marry same-sex couples as long as the municipality ensured that other civil servants were available to solemnize the marriage. In 2014, a law was passed that made it illegal for all marriage officiants to refuse their services to same-sex couples.

===Royal same-sex weddings===
In October 2021, Prime Minister Mark Rutte confirmed that members of the Dutch royal family may enter into a same-sex marriage without having to forfeit the crown or lose their royal title and privileges or their place in the line of succession. Previously, the government had held that if an heir wanted to marry a partner of the same sex, they would have to forfeit their right to the throne.

===Impact===
A 2021 study by economists Shuai Chen and Jan van Ours showed that from 2001 onwards levels of anxiety and depression fell drastically among individuals in same-sex relationships and largely converged to those of heterosexuals. Chen and van Ours found that the legalisation of same-sex marriage, as well as supportive societal attitudes, significantly improved the mental health of LGBT people. They concluded, &quot;We find a significant improvement in the mental health of sexual minorities following the legislation. We also find that marriage itself was only partially responsible for the amelioration of mental health among sexual minorities. More importantly, the legal recognition of same-sex marriage improved mental health for both male and female sexual minorities irrespective of their own marital status.&quot;

===Statistics===

According to provisional figures from Statistics Netherlands, for the first six months, same-sex marriages made up 3.6% of the total number of marriages: a peak of around 6% in the first month followed by around 3% in the remaining months, about 1,339 male couples and 1,075 female couples in total. By June 2004, more than 6,000 same-sex marriages had been performed in the Netherlands.

In March 2006, Statistics Netherlands released estimates on the number of same-sex marriages performed each year: 2,500 in 2001, 1,800 in 2002, 1,200 in 2004, and 1,100 in 2005. 14,813 same-sex marriages were performed in the Netherlands from 2001 to 2011; 7,522 between two women and 7,291 between two men. In the same period, there were 761,010 heterosexual marriages. There were also 1,078 same-sex divorces. By 2015, approximately 21,330 same-sex couples had married in the Netherlands; 11,195 female couples and 10,135 male couples.

On 1 April 2021, 20 years after same-sex marriage was legalized in the Netherlands, Statistics Netherlands reported that over 28,000 same-sex couples had married in the country by that time. Roughly 20,000 of these couples were still together; the remaining having divorced, moved abroad or one or both of the spouses died. Female couples were more likely to divorce, at around 26%, than heterosexual couples at 16%, and male couples at 14%.

===Religious performance===
Since the mid-1960s, religious solemnizations of same-sex relationships have taken place in some Dutch churches. The Remonstrants were Europe&#x27;s first Christian denomination to officially allow such solemnizations in 1986. The first Remonstrant church marriage for two men was performed at Vrijburg in Amsterdam on 31 January 1987. The Mennonite Church in the Netherlands also allows solemnizations of same-sex marriages, while the Old Catholic Church of the Netherlands has allowed its ministers to perform same-sex marriages in its places of worship since 2006.

The Protestant Church in the Netherlands, the largest Protestant denomination in the Netherlands, has allowed its congregations to perform same-sex marriages as &quot;a union of love and faith before God&quot; since 2004, and in practice many churches now conduct such ceremonies. The Protestant Church was formed in 2004 by the merger of three Calvinist and Lutheran churches. The Evangelich Lutheran Church, one of these three churches, officially stated in 1995 that &quot;there are no theological arguments against blessing same-sex couples&quot;, and many Lutheran congregations performed blessings of same-sex unions. In March 1979, a priest of the Dutch Reformed Church performed a &quot;special but public church service&quot; in Groningen in which two men &quot;express[ed] the profound significance of their relationship, promise[d] fidelity to each other, and pray[ed] for their friendship&quot;. Conservative Protestants protested the decision.

The Catholic Church opposes same-sex marriage and does not allow its priests to officiate at such marriages. In 1983, the union of two Protestant women, Harmanna Kalsbeek and Ria Bultena, was blessed at St. Joseph Cathedral in Groningen. While the blessing was meant to be secret, it was leaked to the media. The priest issued a public apology. In December 2023, the Holy See published &quot;Fiducia supplicans&quot;, a declaration allowing Catholic priests to bless couples who are not considered to be married according to church teaching, including the blessing of same-sex couples. Several bishops welcomed the declaration. The Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Netherlands also expressed its support, stating that the church is &quot;a welcoming church which will not deny anyone the support and succour of God&quot;, but emphasised its views that marriage is &quot;only possible between a man and a woman&quot;.

==Public opinion==
According to an Ifop poll conducted in May 2013, 85% of Dutch people supported allowing same-sex couples to marry and adopt children.

The 2015 Eurobarometer found that 91% of the Dutch population thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 7% were opposed. A Pew Research Center poll, conducted between April and August 2017 and published in May 2018, showed that 86% of Dutch people supported same-sex marriage, 10% were opposed and 4% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by religion, 95% of religiously unaffiliated people, 90% of non-practicing Christians and 60% of church-attending Christians supported same-sex marriage. Opposition was also 10% among 18–34-year-olds.

The 2019 Eurobarometer found that 92% of Dutch people thought same-sex marriage should be allowed throughout Europe, while 8% were opposed. A Pew Research Center poll conducted between February and May 2023 showed that 89% of Dutch people supported same-sex marriage, 10% were opposed and 1% did not know or had refused to answer. When divided by political affiliation, support was highest among those on the left of the political spectrum at 94%, followed by those at the center at 92% and those on the right at 85%. Women (92%) were also more likely to support same-sex marriage than men (86%). The 2023 Eurobarometer found that support had increased to 94%, while 5% were opposed. The survey also showed that 94% of Dutch people thought that &quot;there is nothing wrong in a sexual relationship between two persons of the same sex&quot;, while 6% disagreed.
