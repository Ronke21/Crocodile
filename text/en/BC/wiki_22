<text>In mathematics, homogeneous coordinates or projective coordinates, introduced by August Ferdinand MÃ¶bius in his 1827 work , are a system of coordinates used in projective geometry, just as Cartesian coordinates are used in Euclidean geometry. They have the advantage that the coordinates of points, including points at infinity, can be represented using finite coordinates. Formulas involving homogeneous coordinates are often simpler and more symmetric than their Cartesian counterparts. Homogeneous coordinates have a range of applications, including computer graphics and 3D computer vision, where they allow affine transformations and, in general, projective transformations to be easily represented by a matrix. They are also used in fundamental elliptic curve cryptography algorithms.

If homogeneous coordinates of a point are multiplied by a non-zero scalar then the resulting coordinates represent the same point. Since homogeneous coordinates are also given to points at infinity, the number of coordinates required to allow this extension is one more than the dimension of the projective space being considered. For example, two homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point on the projective line and three homogeneous coordinates are required to specify a point in the projective plane.
==Introduction==
The real projective plane can be thought of as the Euclidean plane with additional points added, which are called points at infinity, and are considered to lie on a new line, the line at infinity. There is a point at infinity corresponding to each direction (numerically given by the slope of a line), informally defined as the limit of a point that moves in that direction away from the origin. Parallel lines in the Euclidean plane are said to intersect at a point at infinity corresponding to their common direction. Given a point on the Euclidean plane, for any non-zero real number formula_1, the triple is called a set of homogeneous coordinates for the point. By this definition, multiplying the three homogeneous coordinates by a common, non-zero factor gives a new set of homogeneous coordinates for the same point. In particular, is such a system of homogeneous coordinates for the point .
For example, the Cartesian point can be represented in homogeneous coordinates as or . The original Cartesian coordinates are recovered by dividing the first two positions by the third. Thus unlike Cartesian coordinates, a single point can be represented by infinitely many homogeneous coordinates.

The equation of a line through the origin may be written where formula_2 and formula_3 are not both formula_4. In parametric form this can be written formula_5. Let formula_6, so the coordinates of a point on the line may be written . In homogeneous coordinates this becomes . In the limit, as formula_7 approaches infinity, in other words, as the point moves away from the origin, formula_1 approaches formula_4 and the homogeneous coordinates of the point become . Thus we define as the homogeneous coordinates of the point at infinity corresponding to the direction of the line . As any line of the Euclidean plane is parallel to a line passing through the origin, and since parallel lines have the same point at infinity, the infinite point on every line of the Euclidean plane has been given homogeneous coordinates.

To summarize:
*Any point in the projective plane is represented by a triple , called &#x27;homogeneous coordinates&#x27; or &#x27;projective coordinates&#x27; of the point, where formula_10, formula_11 and formula_1 are not all formula_4. 
*The point represented by a given set of homogeneous coordinates is unchanged if the coordinates are multiplied by a common factor.
*Conversely, two sets of homogeneous coordinates represent the same point if and only if one is obtained from the other by multiplying all the coordinates by the same non-zero constant.
*When formula_1 is not formula_4 the point represented is the point in the Euclidean plane.
*When formula_1 is formula_4 the point represented is a point at infinity.
The triple is omitted and does not represent any point. The origin of the Euclidean plane is represented by .

===Notation===
Some authors use different notations for homogeneous coordinates which help distinguish them from Cartesian coordinates. The use of colons instead of commas, for example formula_18 instead of , emphasizes that the coordinates are to be considered ratios. Square brackets, as in emphasize that multiple sets of coordinates are associated with a single point. Some authors use a combination of colons and square brackets, as in formula_19.

==Other dimensions==
The discussion in the preceding section applies analogously to projective spaces other than the plane. So the points on the projective line may be represented by pairs of coordinates , not both zero. In this case, the point at infinity is . Similarly the points in projective formula_2-space are represented by formula_21-tuples.

==Other projective spaces==
The use of real numbers gives homogeneous coordinates of points in the classical case of the real projective spaces, however any field may be used, in particular, the complex numbers may be used for complex projective space. For example, the complex projective line uses two homogeneous complex coordinates and is known as the Riemann sphere. Other fields, including finite fields, can be used.

Homogeneous coordinates for projective spaces can also be created with elements from a division ring (a skew field). However, in this case, care must be taken to account for the fact that multiplication may not be commutative.

For the general ring &quot;A&quot;, a projective line over &quot;A&quot; can be defined with homogeneous factors acting on the left and the projective linear group acting on the right.

==Alternative definition==
Another definition of the real projective plane can be given in terms of equivalence classes. For non-zero elements
of formula_22, define to mean there is a
non-zero formula_23 so that . Then formula_24 is an equivalence relation and the projective plane can be defined as the
equivalence classes of If is
one of the elements of the equivalence class formula_25 then these are taken to be homogeneous coordinates of formula_25.

Lines in this space are defined to be sets of solutions of equations of the form where not all of formula_27, formula_28 and formula_29 are zero. Satisfaction of the condition depends only on the equivalence class of so the equation defines a set
of points in the projective plane. The mapping defines an inclusion from the
Euclidean plane to the projective plane and the complement of the image is the set of points with . The equation is an equation of a line in the projective plane
(see definition of a line in the projective plane), and is
called the line at infinity.

The equivalence classes, formula_25, are the lines through the origin with the origin removed. The origin does not really play an
essential part in the previous discussion so it can be added back in without changing the properties of the projective
plane. This produces a variation on the definition, namely the projective plane is defined as the set of lines in
formula_22 that pass through the origin and the coordinates of a non-zero element 
of a line are taken to be homogeneous coordinates of the line. These lines are now interpreted as points in the
projective plane.

Again, this discussion applies analogously to other dimensions. So the projective space of dimension n can be defined as
the set of lines through the origin in formula_32.

==Homogeneity==
Homogeneous coordinates are not uniquely determined by a point, so a function defined on the coordinates, say
, does not determine a function defined on points as with Cartesian coordinates.
But a condition defined on the coordinates, as might be used to describe a
curve, determines a condition on points if the function is homogeneous. Specifically, suppose
there is a formula_33 such that

formula_34

If a set of coordinates represents the same point as then it can be written
 for some non-zero value of formula_23 . Then

formula_36

A polynomial of degree formula_33 can be turned into a homogeneous polynomial by
replacing formula_38 with formula_39, formula_40 with formula_41 and multiplying by formula_42, in other words by
defining

formula_43

The resulting function formula_44 is a polynomial, so it makes sense to extend its domain to triples where . The process can be reversed by setting , or

formula_45

The equation can then be thought of as the homogeneous form of
 and it defines the same curve when restricted to the Euclidean plane. For example,
the homogeneous form of the equation of the line is 

==Line coordinates and duality==

The equation of a line in the projective plane may be given as where formula_46,
formula_7 and formula_48 are constants. Each triple determines a line, the line determined is
unchanged if it is multiplied by a non-zero scalar, and at least one of formula_46, formula_7 and formula_48 must be non-zero. So the
triple may be taken to be homogeneous coordinates of a line in the projective plane,
that is line coordinates as opposed to point coordinates. If in formula_52 the letters formula_46, formula_7 and formula_48 are taken as variables and
formula_38, formula_40 and formula_58 are taken as constants then the equation becomes an equation of a set of lines in the space of
all lines in the plane. Geometrically it represents the set of lines that pass through the point and may be interpreted as the equation of the point in line-coordinates. In the same way, planes in 3-space may
be given sets of four homogeneous coordinates, and so on for higher dimensions.

The same relation, , may be regarded as either the equation of a line or the
equation of a point. In general, there is no difference either algebraically or logically between homogeneous
coordinates of points and lines. So plane geometry with points as the fundamental elements and plane geometry with lines
as the fundamental elements are equivalent except for interpretation. This leads to the concept of duality in
projective geometry, the principle that the roles of points and lines can be interchanged in a theorem in projective
geometry and the result will also be a theorem. Analogously, the theory of points in projective 3-space is dual to the
theory of planes in projective 3-space, and so on for higher dimensions.

==PlÃ¼cker coordinates==

Assigning coordinates to lines in projective 3-space is more complicated since it would seem that a total of 8
coordinates, either the coordinates of two points which lie on the line or two planes whose intersection is the line,
are required. A useful method, due to Julius PlÃ¼cker, creates a set of six coordinates as the determinants
 from the homogeneous coordinates of two points and on the line. The PlÃ¼cker embedding is the generalization of this to create homogeneous coordinates of elements of any dimension formula_3 in a projective space of dimension formula_2.

==Circular points==

The homogeneous form for the equation of a circle in the real or complex projective plane is
. The intersection of
this curve with the line at infinity can be found by setting . This produces the equation
 which has two solutions over the complex numbers, giving rise to
the points with homogeneous coordinates and in the complex projective
plane. These points are called the circular points at infinity and can be regarded as the common points of
intersection of all circles. This can be generalized to curves of higher order as circular algebraic curves.

==Change of coordinate systems==
Just as the selection of axes in the Cartesian coordinate system is somewhat arbitrary, the selection of a single system of homogeneous coordinates out of all possible systems is somewhat arbitrary. Therefore, it is useful to know how the different systems are related to each other.

Let be homogeneous coordinates of a point in the projective plane. A fixed matrix
formula_61
with nonzero determinant, defines a new system of coordinates by the equation
formula_62
Multiplication of by a scalar results in the multiplication of by the same scalar, and formula_10, formula_11 and formula_1 cannot be all formula_4 unless formula_38, formula_40 and formula_58 are all zero since formula_70 is nonsingular. So are a new system of homogeneous coordinates for the same point of the projective plane.

==Barycentric coordinates==

MÃ¶bius&#x27;s original formulation of homogeneous coordinates specified the position of a point as the center of mass (or barycenter) of a system of three point masses placed at the vertices of a fixed triangle. Points within the triangle are represented by positive masses and points outside the triangle are represented by allowing negative masses. Multiplying the masses in the system by a scalar does not affect the center of mass, so this is a special case of a system of homogeneous coordinates.

==Trilinear coordinates==

Let formula_71, formula_3 and formula_2 be three lines in the plane and define a set of coordinatesformula_10, formula_11 and formula_1 of a point
formula_25 as the signed distances from formula_25 to these three lines. These are called the &quot;trilinear coordinates&quot; of formula_25 
with respect to the triangle whose vertices are the pairwise intersections of the lines. Strictly speaking these are not
homogeneous, since the values of formula_10, formula_11 and formula_1 are determined exactly, not just up to proportionality. There is
a linear relationship between them however, so these coordinates can be made homogeneous by allowing multiples of
 to represent the same point. More generally, formula_10, formula_11 and formula_1 can be defined as
constants formula_25, formula_87 and formula_88 times the distances to formula_71, formula_3 and formula_2, resulting in a different system of
homogeneous coordinates with the same triangle of reference. This is, in fact, the most general type of system of
homogeneous coordinates for points in the plane if none of the lines is the line at infinity.

==Use in computer graphics and computer vision==
Homogeneous coordinates are ubiquitous in computer graphics because they allow common vector operations such as translation, rotation, scaling and perspective projection to be represented as a matrix by which the vector is multiplied. By the chain rule, any sequence of such operations can be multiplied out into a single matrix, allowing simple and efficient processing. By contrast, using Cartesian coordinates, translations and perspective projection cannot be expressed as matrix multiplications, though other operations can. Modern OpenGL and Direct3D graphics cards take advantage of homogeneous coordinates to implement a vertex shader efficiently using vector processors with 4-element registers.

For example, in perspective projection, a position in space is associated with the line from it to a fixed point called
the &quot;center of projection&quot;. The point is then mapped to a plane by finding the point of intersection of that plane and
the line. This produces an accurate representation of how a three-dimensional object appears to the eye. In the simplest
situation, the center of projection is the origin and points are mapped to the plane , working for
the moment in Cartesian coordinates. For a given point in space, , the point where the
line and the plane intersect is . Dropping the now superfluous formula_58 coordinate,
this becomes . In homogeneous coordinates, the point is represented by and the point it maps to on the plane is
represented by , so projection can be represented in matrix form as
formula_93
Matrices representing other geometric transformations can be combined with this and each other by matrix multiplication.
As a result, any perspective projection of space can be represented as a single matrix.

<text>KTM is an Austrian motorcycle, bicycle and motorsports brand which is co-owned by Indian manufacturer Bajaj Auto and Austrian manufacturer Pierer Mobility AG. It traces its foundation to 1934 as Kronreif &amp; Trunkenpolz Mattighofen. Today, Pierer Mobility AG operates as the manufacturer of KTM branded motorcycles, and KTM Fahrrad AG operates as the manufacturer of KTM branded bicycles.

KTM is known for its off-road motorcycles (enduro, motocross and supermoto). Since the late 1990s, it has expanded into street motorcycle production and developing sports cars â namely the X-Bow. In 2015, KTM sold almost as many street as off-road bikes.

== History ==
=== Early years ===
In 1934, Austrian engineer Johann (Hans) Trunkenpolz (1909â1962) set up a fitter&#x27;s and car repair shop in Mattighofen. In 1937, he started selling DKW motorcycles, and Opel cars the following year. His shop was known as &quot;Kraftfahrzeug Trunkenpolz Mattighofen&quot;, but the name was unregistered. During the Second World War, his wife took care of the business which was thriving mainly on account of diesel engine repairs.

After the war, demand for repair works fell sharply and Trunkenpolz started thinking about producing his own motorcycles. The prototype of his first motorcycle, the R100, was built in 1951. The components of the motorcycle were produced in house, except for the Rotax engines which were made by Fichtel &amp; Sachs. Serial production of the &quot;R100&quot; started in 1953. With just 20 employees, motorcycles were built at a rate of three per day.

=== KTM 1953â1991 ===
In 1953, businessman Ernst Kronreif became a major shareholder of the company, which was renamed and registered as &quot;Kronreif &amp; Trunkenpolz Mattighofen&quot;. In 1954, the &quot;R125 Tourist&quot; was introduced, followed by the Grand Tourist and the scooter Mirabell in 1955.

The company secured its first racing title in the 1954 Austrian 125cc national championship. In 1956, KTM made its appearance at the International Six Days Trials, where Egon Dornauer won a gold medal on a KTM machine.

In 1957, KTM built its first sports motorcycle, the &quot;Trophy 125cc&quot;. KTM&#x27;s first moped, named &quot;Mecky&quot;, was launched in 1957, followed by &quot;Ponny I&quot; in 1960 and &quot;Ponny II&quot; in 1962 and &quot;Comet&quot; in 1963. The 1960s also saw the beginning of bicycle production in Mattighofen.

Ernst Kronreif died in 1960. Two years later in 1962, Hans Trunkenpolz also died of a heart attack. His son &quot;Erich Trunkenpolz&quot; took charge of the company&#x27;s management.

As the company continued to expand, the workforce totalled 400 in 1971, and forty years after it was founded, KTM was offering 42 different models. Additionally, KTM was able to produce motorcycles for the racing industry. During the 1970s and 80s, KTM also started to develop and produce engines and radiators. Radiators sold to European car manufacturers constituted a sizable part of the company&#x27;s business in the 1980s.

In 1978, US subsidiary &quot;KTM North America Inc.&quot; was founded in Lorain, Ohio.

In 1980, the company was renamed &quot;KTM Motor-Fahrzeugbau KG&quot;. One year later, KTM had about 700 employees and a turnover of 750m. Schilling (about 54.5m. euros). International business then amounted to 76% of the company&#x27;s turnover.

However, scooter and moped turnover sank rapidly, and production had to be halted in 1988. Erich Trunkenpolz died in 1989. Takeover of a 51% interest in the company by the Austrian investment trust GIT Trust Holding controlled by Austrian politician Josef Taus in 1989 was followed by unsuccessful attempts to turn the indebted company around, and in 1991, management of KTM was transferred to a consortium of creditor banks.

=== KTM after 1991 ===
In 1991, the company was split into four new entities: KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH (motorcycles division), KTM Fahrrad GmbH (bicycles division), KTM KÃ¼hler GmbH (radiators division) and KTM Werkzeugbau GmbH (tooling division).

Now owned by &quot;KTM Motorradholding GmbH&quot;, which was formed by &quot;Cross Holding&quot; (a &quot;Cross Industries&quot; daughter), and other investors, &quot;KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH&quot; started operation in 1992 and later took over the sibling tooling division KTM Werkzeugbau. In the following years, while steadily increasing production and turnover, investing in new production and R&amp;D facilities, introducing new models and successfully sponsoring and taking part in various sports racing events, the company underwent a series of restructurings and stakeholder changes guided by KTM&#x27;s managing director and &quot;Cross Industries&quot; owner Stefan Pierer. 
In 1994, KTM started production of the &quot;Duke&quot; series of road motorcycles, in 1996, KTM motocross machines were first decked out in KTM&#x27;s signature orange color, and 1997 saw the introduction of liquid-cooled two-cylinder &quot;Supermoto&quot; and &quot;Adventure&quot; motorcycles. In 2007, the company debuted the KTM X-Bow sports car.

In 1995, KTM Motorradholding GmbH acquired Swedish motorcycle maker &quot;Husaberg AB&quot; and took control of the Dutch company &quot;White Power Suspension&quot;.

In 2007, Indian motorcycle manufacturer &quot;Bajaj Auto&quot; bought a 14.5% stake in &quot;KTM Power Sports AG&quot;. By 2013, Bajaj Auto held a 47.97% interest in the company.

In 2013, KTM acquired the formerly Swedish motorcycle maker &quot;Husqvarna Motorcycles&quot; from its prior owner &quot;BMW Motorrad AG&quot;. The same year, KTM re-integrated the brand &quot;Husaberg&quot; into &quot;Husqvarna Motorcycles&quot; from which it had spun off in the 1990s when Husqvarna was sold to the Italian company Cagiva.

As the final result of the restructuring process, &quot;KTM Motorradholding GmbH&quot; had become &quot;KTM AG&quot; in 2012. In 2015, KTM generated a turnover of over 1 billion Euro and employed 2515 people by the end of that year. Of the four separate companies left after the 1992 split, three were now again part of the KTM Group: &quot;KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH&quot;, &quot;KTM Werkzeugbau GmbH&quot; and &quot;KTM KÃ¼hler GmbH&quot; (today &quot;WP Radiators&quot;). &quot;KTM Fahrrad GmbH (KTM Bike Industries)&quot; remains an independent company and is owned by Chinese investors. KTM-Group today contains the brands KTM, Husqvarna Motorcycles and GasGas Motorcycles.

In 2021 Bajaj Auto sold 46.5% of KTM&#x27;s shares to Pierer Mobility AG in exchange for 49% shares in the latter company and thus became an indirect stakeholder in KTM.

== Operations ==

At present, KTM brand is operated by two corporate houses-

* Pierer Mobility â AG motorcycles &amp; affiliated businesses via KTM AG
* KTM Fahrrad GmbH â bicycles &amp; related businesses

=== KTM Motorcycles ===
In September 2021, KTM AG went though a corporate restructuring through a complex share swap deal between Pierer Group and Bajaj Auto Limited. As of November 2023, the apex holding company for KTM in motorcycles and affiliated business was Pierer Industrie AG, which owns 50.1% stake in Pierer Bajaj AG, wherein Bajaj Auto Limited holds the remaining 49.9% stake. Pierer Bajaj AG holds 78.16% stake in Pierer Mobility AG, which in turn holds 100% stake in KTM AG.

==== Affiliated Businesses ====

Under the Pierer Mobility umbrella, the following companies use the KTM brand-

* KTM AG â manufacturing motorcycles
* KTM Forschungs &amp; Entwicklungs GmbH â research &amp; development
* KTM Informatics GmbH â information technology
* KTM Racing GmbH â motorsports
Pierer Mobility also has stakes in the following motorcycle companies, making them a sister concern of KTM AG-

* Husqvarna Motorcycles GmbH [100%]
* GASGAS Motorcycles GmbH [100%]
* MV Agusta Motor S.p.A. [50.1%]

Furthermore, KTM Sportmotorcycle GmbH and Husqvarna Motorcycles GmbH operate 24 and 8 distribution subsidiaries worldwide, respectively, most of them in European and Asian countries and in the US.

==== Joint ventures ====
KTM started exporting their GS model to the US in 1968 through an American importer, John Penton under the &quot;Penton&quot; brand. This joint venture lasted until KTM established &quot;KTM America Inc.&quot; in Ohio in 1978.

In 2005, KTM-Sportmotocycle began a partnership with ATV manufacturer Polaris Industries with the goal of shared research, and more importantly shared distribution networks. This partnership was a two-year trial arrangement, at the end of which both parties had the option of merging the two companies into one. In 2006, KTM announced that the partnership with Polaris had been downgraded, and would instead only supply their 450cc and 510cc RFS engines to Polaris.

In January 2008, Bajaj announced that it would jointly develop two new 125cc and 200cc bikes for Europe and the Far East. The bikes would be badged &quot;KTM&quot;. In January 2012, Bajaj launched the Duke 200 model in India.

In November 2022 KTM acquired a 25,1 % stake in the Italian motorcycle manufacturer MV Agusta.

=== KTM Bikes ===

KTM as a brand is also used by KTM Fahrrad GmbH, which, as the exclusive licensee, manufactures bicycles and bicycle accessories. This company originated by the spin-off of KTM in 1991 and shares the same history and heritage as that of KTM Motorcycles.

== Motorsports ==

KTM entered motorsports competing in motocross racing. KTM won its first championship in 1974 when Gennady Moiseyev claimed the 250cc Motocross World Championship. By the end of 2016, KTM had won more than 260 world championship titles, making the company one of the most successful brands in motorsports. KTM has claimed 96 MXGP, MX1 and MX2 world titles since 1974 and 114 E1, E2, E3 and Super Enduro world titles since 1990. With Ryan Dungey&#x27;s 2015, 2016 and 2017 victories in the supercross world championship, KTM gained a successful presence in supercross racing as well. In 1994, a KTM factory team debuted at the Dakar Rally. In 1998, KTM riders won second to twelfth place. With consecutive wins from 2001 to 2019, the manufacturer has dominated the rally for 18 years now. KTM teams successfully compete in other rally raid events like the Atlas Rally or the Rallye du Maroc. KTM has won 37 cross country rallies world titles since 2003 and has won the FIM Cross-Country Rallies World Championship 15 times, most recently in 2015.

In 2003, KTM started sponsoring and supporting road racing in various capacities, with the most successful results stemming from their supermoto efforts. From 2003 to 2009, a KTM factory team competed in the 125Â cc class of the motorcycle Grands Prix, and between 2005 and 2008 in the 250Â cc class. Notable successes in the 125Â cc class were the second and third place in the overall ranking scored in 2005 by KTM riders Mika Kallio and GÃ¡bor TalmÃ¡csi, the second place in 2006 by Mika Kallio, the third place in 2007 by Tomoyoshi Koyama and the 2005 KTM victory in the 125Â cc constructor&#x27;s championship. In the 250Â cc class, Mika Kallio won third place in 2008. Since the first Rookies Cup season in 2007, KTM has supplied the bike for the Red Bull MotoGP Rookies Cup.

===Grand Prix motorcycle racing===
In 2009, KTM announced their withdrawal from Grand Prix motorcycle racing in all classes, and did not return until 2012 in the new Moto3 class.

In 2012, KTM won the Moto3 manufacturers&#x27; championship. During the next season, KTM riders prevailed in every race of the Moto3 class and won the world title as well as second and third place, making KTM the obvious victor of the manufacturers&#x27; standing. KTM won the manufacturer title in the 2014 and 2016 as well as the world title in 2016 in the Moto3 class. Starting in 2017, KTM fields bikes in both MotoGP and Moto2 classes as well. The main class team features Jack Miller and Brad Binder as full-season riders, Mika Kallio as wildcard rider, and Dani Pedrosa as test/development rider. The Moto2 KTM Ajo team features Pedro Acosta and Albert Arenas.
Steadfastly independent and confident of their company&#x27;s abilities, KTM chose to use a steel trellis frame where all other manufacturers used aluminum. In addition, KTM insisted on developing their own racing suspension through their WP subsidiary (all other manufacturers used Ãhlins). KTM demonstrated their prowess in doing things their own way by winning their first Moto GP premier class race on August 9, 2020, with rookie Brad Binder crossing the finish line in first place.

From 2009 to 2011, KTM teams competed in the IDM, the Superbike International German Championships. There were speculations about a possible KTM foray into the superbike world championship. Due to the company&#x27;s focus shifting away from the RC8 and generally superbike design, these plans are off the table for the foreseeable future.

KTM&#x27;s official company/team colours are orange, black and silver. To create a strong brand identity, all competition-ready KTMs come from the factory with bright orange plastic with &quot;KTM&quot; emblazoned on the side of the radiator shrouds. All KTM bikes also come from the factory with a Motorex sticker on the outside of the motor. All first fills of oil come from Motorex as well. Some official KTM teams use different colors for their bikes, most noticeably in the Dakar Rally.

== Products ==
=== Off-road motorcycles ===
KTM manufactures a wide range of off-road motorcycles. Not all of their models are available in every country. The following section lists bikes that are sold in the US.

Motocross â The current Motocross line designated by SX includes 50, 65, 85, 105, 125, 150, 250 and 300Â cc single-cylinder two-stroke models (the 50 SX, 65 SX and 85 SX models are kids&#x27; and youth bikes), and 250, 350 and 450Â cc single-cylinder four-stroke models (SX-F). In 2005 KTM released the new 250SX-F to the general public. Since 2007, the SX-F&#x27;s have been KTM&#x27;s new racing motocross range. Current versions of the KTM SX-F line have a dual overhead camshaft engine dubbed the âRC4â.

Cross-Country â The current cross-country line designated by XC includes 150, 250 and 300Â cc two-stroke models and 250, 350 and 450Â cc four-stroke models. The two-stroke XC machines except the 150Â cc model are available with either wide-ratio or close-ratio transmission (when switching gears, there is a more or less pronounced rpm change). The four-stroke models are fitted with a semi-close ratio gearbox. Most models are equipped with an electric starter.

The very lightweight XC bikes are competition bikes only; they do not meet homologation regulations.

Enduro â The street-legal EXC enduro versions of KTM&#x27;s XC cross-country bikes are supplied with plusher non-linkage suspensions, a wider-ratio gear box and lights.

The current line available in the US consists of 250, 350, 450 and 500 (actually 510 cc) four-stroke EXC models and the 690Â cc Enduro R dual-sport motorcycle.

Free Ride â A KTM original class of off-road motorcycle that could be described as a cross between Enduro and trials bikes. The Freeride 250R is powered by a lighter, modified version of the 250 EXC Enduro engine and has a specially developed six-speed gearbox with close transmission ratios in the lower gears and a wide ratio for the sixth gear. A four-stroke 350Â cc free ride model with similar characteristics, and the all-electric single-speed models Freeride E-SX, Freeride E-XC as well as their street version Freeride E-SM are available in Europe.

=== Two-stroke development ===
In the 1990s, AMA rule changes put the cheaper, simpler two-stroke machines at a disadvantage to four-stroke bikes in motocross competitions by limiting two-stroke displacement at 125Â cc for the 250Â cc class and 250Â cc for the 450Â cc class. While other manufacturers have decided to discontinue their two-stroke models, KTM has continued with creating and improving their two-stroke engines and has consequently taken up a very high proportion of the two-stroke bike market.

New European emission laws have increased the pressure on two-stroke bikes, as their engines are less fuel efficient and produce more pollution than four-stroke engines. However, with newer advances in technology, two-strokes have begun to burn cleaner and pass stricter environmental standards. Starting in 2017, all newly registered motorcycles must conform with the Euro 4 regulations for emissions management. In May 2017, KTM unveiled a new two-stroke engine with direct fuel injection. By pressure-injecting an electronically controlled amount of fuel into the transfer port of the cylinder, the new TPI (transfer port injection) engines will be more fuel efficient and cleaner than classic carburetor two-stroke engines, albeit more complex and expensive. By 2018, 250 and 300 EXC TPI enduro models will be powered by the new engine.

=== Street bikes ===

The first KTM street bike was the Duke 620 in 1994.
Supermoto â KTM was the first manufacturer to offer a competition-ready supermoto bike to the public. However, the company stopped supermoto production in 2016 to focus on stock 690 SMC R machines. For the 2019 Model year, the 690 SMC R model was completely renewed. The bike now has the latest version of the single cylinder LC4 power unit, introduced for the MY2016 Duke. The previous supermoto models included the 625 SMC and the race version 560 SMR. The 141Â kg light 690 SMC R model has a 48Â kW liquid-cooled one-cylinder four-stroke motor (LC4) and a hydraulically actuated APTC slipper clutch.

Adventure tourers â KTM currently produces the 1090 Adventure, 790 Adventure, 390 Adventure, and 1290 Super Adventure dual-sport adventure bikes in versions with different seat height, wheels and suspensions that endow the machines with a road (S), off-road (R â for rally) or touring (T) bias. Not all versions are available on the US market.

The 1090 Adventure and 1290 Super Adventure bikes are powered by 75 degree V-twin four-stroke motors (LC8). The 790 Adventure is powered by the new LC8c parallel twin four-stroke motor. All 3 feature a slipper clutch, electronically controlled riding modes (sport, street and rain) with the 1290 and 790 featuring a TFT display and the 1090 featuring a twin (analog plus LCD) display.

Sports tourer â The KTM sports tourer 1290 Superduke GT (Gran Turismo) is a version of the 1290 Superduke R naked bike that has been modified for more touring comfort with a longer and more robust frame, modified handlebar, larger fuel tank and modified 75 degree V-twin four-stroke LC8 motor. Like the 1290 Super Adventure, the 1290 Superduke GT features three electronically controlled riding modes.

Naked bikes â With the Duke and Superduke models, KTM currently offers naked bikes with 125, 200, 250, 390, 690, 790, 890 and 1290Â cc displacement. The 125 (not available in the US), 200, 250, 390 and 690 and 690 R Duke models have a single-cylinder four-stroke LC4 motor. The 790, 890 Duke use a new twin-parallel engine. The 1290 R Superduke model is equipped with a 75 degree V-twin four-stroke motor (LC8).

200, 250 and 390 Duke models are currently produced by Bajaj Auto in Pune, India. The 250 is only available in Asia, with only the Duke 390 and Duke 200 being exported to European countries and North America. The Duke 200 2020 model is now available in the United States and has a new redesigned 200 cc displacement engine.

Supersport â KTM sport bikes currently offered in the supersport category include the RC 125 (not available in the US) and the RC 390. Both are street-legal versions of bikes that compete in street races. With the RC16, KTM has presented a 1000Â cc sport bike that will race in the MotoGP class of the 2017 Road Racing World Championship Grand Prix. Whether there will be a street-legal production version of the RC16 at a later point in time is yet unclear.

In Asia, KTM also markets RC 200 and RC 250 street bikes. KTM is also planning to introduced a new 150cc bike in its RC lineup in the Asian countries. This would be the KTC RC 150, that will powered by a 149cc, single-cylinder engine and 6-speed gearbox. This will be launched at a more affordable price, so everyone can opt for it.

Superbike â Currently, KTM has retired from superbike production and competitions. From 2008 to 2015, the company produced the 1190 RC8 superbike, a light, powerful homologated (street-legal) bike for superbike competitions with an LC8 motor and without any of the electronic driving aids that the otherwise comparable Superduke and Super Adventure models offer.

=== Design ===
Since 2016, KTM motorcycles have been designed by KISKA, a Salzburg-based design firm. KISKA also designed four versions of the X-Bow and is responsible for the overall branding for KTM and Husqvarna.

=== Parts and Wear ===
Under the Powerparts label, KTM sells tuning and styling parts for its street and off-road motorcycles and the X-Bow. The Powerwear label offers race gear and equipment, clothing, accessories and merchandise articles.

== X-Bow ==

The KTM X-Bow (pronounced cross-bow) is a series of lightweight, two-seater sports cars known as the X-Bow R, the X-Bow RR, the X-Bow GT and the X-BOW GT4. The R and GT versions of the X-Bow are street-legal in Europe, North America, China and Australia. It uses an Audi engine and a carbon fibre chassis developed in cooperation with Italian racing car manufacturer Dallara, making it the world&#x27;s first street-legal car with a full carbon fibre monocoque.

<doc id="243321" wikidata="Q223903" url="?curid=243321" title="Oculomotor nerve">
<text>The oculomotor nerve, also known as the third cranial nerve, cranial nerve III, or simply CN III, is a cranial nerve that enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and innervates extraocular muscles that enable most movements of the eye and that raise the eyelid. The nerve also contains fibers that innervate the intrinsic eye muscles that enable pupillary constriction and accommodation (ability to focus on near objects as in reading). The oculomotor nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain. Cranial nerves IV and VI also participate in control of eye movement.

==Structure==
The oculomotor nerve originates from the third nerve nucleus at the level of the superior colliculus in the midbrain. The third nerve nucleus is located ventral to the cerebral aqueduct, on the pre-aqueductal grey matter. The fibers from the two third nerve nuclei located laterally on either side of the cerebral aqueduct then pass through the red nucleus. From the red nucleus fibers then pass via the substantia nigra to emerge from the substance of the brainstem at the oculomotor sulcus (a groove on the lateral wall of the interpeduncular fossa).

On emerging from the brainstem, the nerve is invested with a sheath of pia mater, and enclosed in a prolongation from the arachnoid. It passes between the superior cerebellar (below) and posterior cerebral arteries (above), and then pierces the dura mater anterior and lateral to the posterior clinoid process, passing between the free and attached borders of the tentorium cerebelli.

It traverses the cavernous sinus, above the other orbital nerves receiving in its course one or two filaments from the cavernous plexus of the sympathetic nervous system, and a communicating branch from the ophthalmic division of the trigeminal nerve. As the oculomotor nerve enters the orbit via the superior orbital fissure it then divides into a superior and an inferior branch.

===Superior branch===
The &quot;superior branch&quot; of the oculomotor nerve or the &quot;superior division&quot;, the smaller, passes medially over the optic nerve. It supplies the superior rectus and levator palpebrae superioris.

===Inferior branch===
The &quot;inferior branch&quot; of the oculomotor nerve or the &quot;inferior division&quot;, the larger, divides into three branches.
* One passes beneath the optic nerve to the medial rectus.
* Another, to the inferior rectus.
* The third and longest runs forward between the inferior recti and lateralis to the inferior oblique. 
*From the third one, a short thick branch is given off to the lower part of the ciliary ganglion, and forms its short root.

All these branches enter the muscles on their ocular surfaces, with the exception of the nerve to the inferior oblique, which enters the muscle at its posterior border.

===Nuclei===
The oculomotor nerve (CN III) arises from the anterior aspect of the mesencephalon (midbrain). There are two nuclei for the oculomotor nerve:
* The oculomotor nucleus originates at the level of the superior colliculus. The muscles it controls are the striated muscle in levator palpebrae superioris and other extraocular muscles except for the superior oblique muscle and the lateral rectus muscle.
* The Edinger-Westphal nucleus supplies parasympathetic fibers to the eye via the ciliary ganglion, and thus controls the sphincter pupillae muscle (affecting pupil constriction) and the ciliary muscle (affecting accommodation).

Sympathetic postganglionic fibres also join the nerve from the plexus on the internal carotid artery in the wall of the cavernous sinus and are distributed through the nerve, e.g., to the smooth muscle of superior tarsal (Mueller&#x27;s) muscle.

==Function==
The oculomotor nerve includes axons of type GSE, general somatic efferent, which innervate skeletal muscle of the levator palpebrae superioris, superior rectus, medial rectus, inferior rectus, and inferior oblique muscles. (Innervates all the extrinsic muscles except superior oblique and lateral rectus.)

The nerve also includes axons of type GVE, general visceral efferent, which provide preganglionic parasympathetics to the ciliary ganglion. From the ciliary ganglion postganglionic fibers pass through the short ciliary nerve to the constrictor pupillae of the iris and the ciliary muscles.

==Clinical significance==

===Disease===
Paralysis of the oculomotor nerve, i.e., oculomotor nerve palsy, can arise due to:
*direct trauma,
*demyelinating diseases (e.g., multiple sclerosis),
*increased intracranial pressure (leading to uncal herniation)
**due to a space-occupying lesion (e.g., brain cancer) or a
**spontaneous subarachnoid haemorrhage (e.g., berry aneurysm), and
*microvascular disease, e.g., diabetes.

In people with diabetes and older than 50 years of age, an oculomotor nerve palsy, in the classical sense, occurs with sparing (or preservation) of the pupillary reflex. This is thought to arise due to the anatomical arrangement of the nerve fibers in the oculomotor nerve; fibers controlling the pupillary function are superficial and spared from ischemic injuries typical of diabetes. On the converse, an aneurysm which leads to compression of the oculomotor nerve affects the superficial fibers and manifests as a third nerve palsy with loss of the pupillary reflex (in fact, this third nerve finding is considered to represent an aneurysmâuntil proven otherwiseâand should be investigated).

===Examination===
====Eye muscles====
Cranial nerves III, IV, and VI are usually tested together as part of the cranial nerve examination. The examiner typically instructs the patient to hold his head still and follow only with the eyes a finger or penlight that circumscribes a large &quot;H&quot; in front of the patient. By observing the eye movement and eyelids, the examiner is able to obtain more information about the extraocular muscles, the levator palpebrae superioris muscle, and cranial nerves III, IV, and VI. Loss of function of any of the eye muscles results in ophthalmoparesis.

Since the oculomotor nerve controls most of the eye muscles, it may be easier to detect damage to it. Damage to this nerve, termed oculomotor nerve palsy, is known by its &quot;down and out&quot; symptoms, because of the position of the affected eye (lateral, downward deviation of gaze).

====Pupillary reflex====

The oculomotor nerve also controls the constriction of the pupils and thickening of the lens of the eye. This can be tested in two main ways. By moving a finger toward a person&#x27;s face to induce accommodation, their pupils should constrict.

Shining a light into one eye should result in equal constriction of the other eye. Fibers from the optic nerves cross over in the optic chiasm with some fibers passing to the contralateral optic nerve tract. This is the basis of the &quot;swinging-flashlight test&quot;.

Loss of accommodation and continued pupillary dilation can indicate the presence of a lesion on the oculomotor nerve.

<doc id="243323" wikidata="Q319584" url="?curid=243323" title="Trochlear nerve">
<text>The trochlear nerve (), (lit. &quot;pulley-like&quot; nerve) also known as the fourth cranial nerve, cranial nerve IV, or CN IV, is a cranial nerve that innervates a single muscle - the superior oblique muscle of the eye (which operates through the pulley-like trochlea). Unlike most other cranial nerves, the trochlear nerve is exclusively a motor nerve (somatic efferent nerve). 

The trochlear nerve is unique among the cranial nerves in several respects:
* It is the &quot;smallest&quot; nerve in terms of the number of axons it contains. 
* It has the greatest intracranial length. 
* It is the only cranial nerve that exits from the dorsal (rear) aspect of the brainstem.
* It innervates a muscle, the superior oblique muscle, on the opposite side (contralateral) from its nucleus. The trochlear nerve decussates within the brainstem before emerging on the contralateral side of the brainstem (at the level of the inferior colliculus). An injury to the trochlear nucleus in the brainstem will result in an contralateral superior oblique muscle palsy, whereas an injury to the trochlear nerve (after it has emerged from the brainstem) results in an ipsilateral superior oblique muscle palsy.

The superior oblique muscle which the trochlear nerve innervates ends in a tendon that passes through a fibrous loop, the trochlea, located anteriorly on the medial aspect of the orbit. &quot;Trochlea&quot; means âpulleyâ in Latin; the fourth nerve is thus also named after this structure. The words &quot;trochlea&quot; and &quot;trochlear&quot; (, ) come from Ancient Greek &quot;trokhilÃ©a&quot;, âpulley; block-and-tackle equipmentâ.

==Structure==
The trochlear nerve provides motor innervation to the superior oblique muscle of the eye, a skeletal muscle; the trochlear nerve thus carries axons of general somatic efferent type.

=== Course ===
Each trochlear nerve originates from a trochlear nucleus in the medial midbrain. From their respective nuclei, the two trochlear nerves then travel dorsal-ward through the substance of the midbrain surrounded by the periaqueductal gray, crossing over (decussating) within the midbrain before emerging from the dorsal midbrain just inferior to the inferior colliculus. Each trochlear nerve thus comes to course on the contralateral side, first passing laterally (to the side) and then anteriorly around the pons, then running forward toward the eye in the subarachnoid space. It passes between the posterior cerebral artery and the superior cerebellar artery. It then pierces the dura just under free margin of the tentorium cerebelli, close to the crossing of the attached margin of the tentorium and within millimeters of the posterior clinoid process. It runs on the outer wall of the cavernous sinus. Finally, it enters the orbit through the superior orbital fissure and to innervate the superior oblique muscle.

=== Development ===
The human trochlear nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic midbrain.

==Clinical significance==
===Vertical diplopia===
Injury to the trochlear nerve cause weakness of downward eye movement with consequent vertical diplopia (double vision). The affected eye drifts upward relative to the normal eye, due to the unopposed actions of the remaining extraocular muscles. The patient sees two visual fields (one from each eye), separated vertically. To compensate for this, patients learn to tilt the head forward (tuck the chin in) in order to bring the fields back togetherâto fuse the two images into a single visual field. This accounts for the âdejectedâ appearance of patients with âpathetic nerveâ palsies.

===Torsional diplopia===
Trochlear nerve palsy also affects torsion (rotation of the eyeball in the plane of the face). Torsion is a normal response to tilting the head sideways. The eyes automatically rotate in an equal and opposite direction, so that the orientation of the environment remains unchangedâvertical things remain vertical.

Weakness of intorsion results in torsional diplopia, in which two different visual fields, tilted with respect to each other, are seen at the same time. To compensate for this, patients with trochlear nerve palsies tilt their heads to the opposite side, in order to fuse the two images into a single visual field.

The characteristic appearance of patients with fourth nerve palsies (head tilted to one side, chin tucked in) suggests the diagnosis, but other causes must be ruled out. For example, torticollis can produce a similar appearance.

===Causes===
The clinical syndromes can originate from both peripheral and central lesions.

====Peripheral lesion====
A peripheral lesion is damage to the bundle of nerves, in contrast to a central lesion, which is damage to the trochlear nucleus. Acute symptoms are probably a result of trauma or disease, while chronic symptoms probably are congenital.

=====Acute palsy=====
The most common cause of &quot;acute&quot; fourth nerve palsy is head trauma. Even relatively minor trauma can transiently stretch the fourth nerve (by transiently displacing the brainstem relative to the posterior clinoid process). Patients with minor damage to the fourth nerve will complain of âblurryâ vision. Patients with more extensive damage will notice frank diplopia and rotational (torsional) disturbances of the visual fields. The usual clinical course is complete recovery within weeks to months.

Isolated injury to the fourth nerve can be caused by any process that stretches or compresses the nerve. A generalized increase in intracranial pressureâhydrocephalus, pseudotumor cerebri, hemorrhage, edemaâwill affect the fourth nerve, but the abducens nerve (VI) is usually affected first (producing horizontal diplopia, not vertical diplopia). Infections (meningitis, herpes zoster), demyelination (multiple sclerosis), diabetic neuropathy and cavernous sinus disease can affect the fourth nerve, as can orbital tumors and TolosaâHunt syndrome. In general, these diseases affect other cranial nerves as well. Isolated damage to the fourth nerve is uncommon in these settings.

=====Chronic palsy=====

The most common cause of &quot;chronic&quot; fourth nerve palsy is a congenital defect, in which the development of the fourth nerve (or its nucleus) is abnormal or incomplete. Congenital defects may be noticed in childhood, but minor defects may not become evident until adult life, when compensatory mechanisms begin to fail. Congenital fourth nerve palsies are amenable to surgical treatment.

====Central lesion====
Central damage is damage to the trochlear nucleus. It affects the &quot;contralateral&quot; eye. The nuclei of other cranial nerves generally affect &quot;ipsilateral&quot; structures (for example, the optic nerves - cranial nerves II - innervate both eyes).

The trochlear nucleus and its axons within the brainstem can be damaged by infarctions, hemorrhage, arteriovenous malformations, tumors and demyelination. Collateral damage to other structures will usually dominate the clinical picture.

The fourth nerve is one of the final common pathways for cortical systems that control eye movement in general. Cortical control of eye movement (saccades, smooth pursuit, accommodation) involves conjugate gaze, not unilateral eye movement.

===Clinical assessment===
The trochlear nerve is tested by examining the action of its muscle, the superior oblique. When acting on its own this muscle depresses and abducts the eyeball. However, movements of the eye by the extraocular muscles are synergistic (working together). Therefore, the trochlear nerve is tested by asking the patient to look &#x27;down and in&#x27; as the contribution of the superior oblique is greatest in this motion. Common activities requiring this type of convergent gaze are reading the newspaper and walking down stairs. Diplopia associated with these activities may be the initial symptom of a fourth nerve palsy.

Alfred Bielschowsky&#x27;s head tilt test is a test for palsy of the superior oblique muscle caused by damage to cranial nerve IV (trochlear nerve).

== Other animals ==
Homologous trochlear nerves are found in all jawed vertebrates. The unique features of the trochlear nerve, including its dorsal exit from the brainstem and its contralateral innervation, are seen in the primitive brains of sharks.

<text>In neuroanatomy, the trigeminal nerve (lit. &quot;triplet&quot; nerve), also known as the fifth cranial nerve, cranial nerve V, or simply CN V, is a cranial nerve responsible for sensation in the face and motor functions such as biting and chewing; it is the most complex of the cranial nerves. Its name (&quot;trigeminal&quot;, ) derives from each of the two nerves (one on each side of the pons) having three major branches: the ophthalmic nerve (V), the maxillary nerve (V), and the mandibular nerve (V). The ophthalmic and maxillary nerves are purely sensory, whereas the mandibular nerve supplies motor as well as sensory (or &quot;cutaneous&quot;) functions. Adding to the complexity of this nerve is that autonomic nerve fibers as well as special sensory fibers (taste) are contained within it.

The motor division of the trigeminal nerve derives from the basal plate of the embryonic pons, and the sensory division originates in the cranial neural crest. Sensory information from the face and body is processed by parallel pathways in the central nervous system.

== Structure ==

=== Origin ===
From the trigeminal ganglion, a single, large sensory root enters the brainstem at the level of the pons. Immediately adjacent to the sensory root, a smaller motor root emerges from the pons slightly rostrally and medially to the sensory root.

Motor fibers pass through the trigeminal ganglion without synapsing on their way to peripheral muscles, their cell bodies being located in the nucleus of the fifth nerve, deep within the pons.

=== Trigeminal ganglion ===
The three major branches of the trigeminal nerveâthe ophthalmic nerve (V1), the maxillary nerve (V2) and the mandibular nerve (V3)âconverge on the trigeminal ganglion (also called the semilunar ganglion or gasserian ganglion), located within Meckel&#x27;s cave and containing the cell bodies of incoming sensory-nerve fibers. The trigeminal ganglion is analogous to the dorsal root ganglia of the spinal cord, which contain the cell bodies of incoming sensory fibers from the rest of the body.

===Sensory branches===

The ophthalmic, maxillary and mandibular branches leave the skull through three separate foramina: the superior orbital fissure, the foramen rotundum and the foramen ovale, respectively. The ophthalmic nerve (V1) carries sensory information from the scalp and forehead, the upper eyelid, the conjunctiva and cornea of the eye, the nose (including the tip of the nose, except alae nasi), the nasal mucosa, the frontal sinuses and parts of the meninges (the dura and blood vessels). The maxillary nerve (V2) carries sensory information from the lower eyelid and cheek, the nares and upper lip, the upper teeth and gums, the nasal mucosa, the palate and roof of the pharynx, the maxillary, ethmoid and sphenoid sinuses and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve (V3) carries sensory information from the lower lip, the lower teeth and gums, the chin and jaw (except the angle of the jaw, which is supplied by C2-C3), parts of the external ear and parts of the meninges. The mandibular nerve carries touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the mouth. Although it does not carry taste sensation (the chorda tympani is responsible for taste), one of its branchesâthe lingual nerveâcarries sensation from the tongue.

The peripheral processes of mesencephalic nucleus of V neurons run in the motor root of the trigeminal nerve and terminate in the muscle spindles in the muscles of mastication. They are proprioceptive fibers, conveying information regarding the location of the masticatory muscles. The central processes of mesencephalic V neurons synapse in the motor nucleus V.

=== Dermatomes ===
The areas of cutaneous distribution (dermatomes) of the three sensory branches of the trigeminal nerve have sharp borders with relatively little overlap (unlike dermatomes in the rest of the body, which have considerable overlap). The injection of a local anesthetic, such as lidocaine, results in the complete loss of sensation from well-defined areas of the face and mouth. For example, teeth on one side of the jaw can be numbed by injecting the mandibular nerve. Occasionally, injury or disease processes may affect two (or all three) branches of the trigeminal nerve; in these cases, the involved branches may be termed:
* V1/V2 distribution â Referring to the ophthalmic and maxillary branches
* V2/V3 distribution â Referring to the maxillary and mandibular branches
* V1-V3 distribution â Referring to all three branches

Nerves on the left side of the jaw slightly outnumber the nerves on the right side of the jaw.

== Function ==
The sensory function of the trigeminal nerve is to provide tactile, proprioceptive, and nociceptive afference to the face and mouth. Its motor function activates the muscles of mastication, the tensor tympani, tensor veli palatini, mylohyoid and the anterior belly of the digastric.

The trigeminal nerve carries general somatic afferent fibers (GSA), which innervate the skin of the face via ophthalmic (V1), maxillary (V2) and mandibular (V3) divisions. The trigeminal nerve also carries special visceral efferent (SVE) axons, which innervate the muscles of mastication via the mandibular (V3) division.

===Muscles===
The motor component of the mandibular division (V3) of the trigeminal nerve controls the movement of eight muscles, including the four muscles of mastication: the masseter, the temporal muscle, and the medial and lateral pterygoids. The other four muscles are the tensor veli palatini, the mylohyoid, the anterior belly of the digastric and the tensor tympani. 

With the exception of the tensor tympani, all these muscles are involved in biting, chewing and swallowing and all have bilateral cortical representation. A unilateral central lesion (for example, a stroke), no matter how large, is unlikely to produce an observable deficit. Injury to a peripheral nerve can cause paralysis of muscles on one side of the jaw, with the jaw deviating towards the paralyzed side when it opens. This direction of the mandible is due to the action of the functioning pterygoids on the opposite side.

===Sensation===

The two basic types of sensation are touch-position and pain-temperature. Touch-position input comes to attention immediately, but pain-temperature input reaches the level of consciousness after a delay; when a person steps on a pin, the awareness of stepping on something is immediate but the pain associated with it is delayed.

Touch-position information is generally carried by myelinated (fast-conducting) nerve fibers, and pain-temperature information by unmyelinated (slow-conducting) fibers. The primary sensory receptors for touch-position (Meissner&#x27;s corpuscles, Merkel&#x27;s receptors, Pacinian corpuscles, Ruffini&#x27;s corpuscles, hair receptors, muscle spindle organs and Golgi tendon organs) are structurally more complex than those for pain-temperature, which are nerve endings.

Sensation in this context refers to the conscious perception of touch-position and pain-temperature information, rather than the special senses (smell, sight, taste, hearing and balance) processed by different cranial nerves and sent to the cerebral cortex through different pathways. The perception of magnetic fields, electrical fields, low-frequency vibrations and infrared radiation by some nonhuman vertebrates is processed by their equivalent of the fifth cranial nerve.

Touch in this context refers to the perception of detailed, localized tactile information, such as two-point discrimination (the difference between touching one point and two closely spaced points) or the difference between coarse, medium or fine sandpaper. People without touch-position perception can feel the surface of their bodies and perceive touch in a broad sense, but they lack perceptual detail.

Position, in this context, refers to conscious proprioception. Proprioceptors (muscle spindle and Golgi tendon organs) provide information about joint position and muscle movement. Although much of this information is processed at an unconscious level (primarily by the cerebellum and the vestibular nuclei), some is available at a conscious level.

Touch-position and pain-temperature sensations are processed by different pathways in the central nervous system. This hard-wired distinction is maintained up to the cerebral cortex. Within the cerebral cortex, sensations are linked with other cortical areas.

===Sensory pathways===
Sensory pathways from the periphery to the cortex are separate for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations. All sensory information is sent to specific nuclei in the thalamus. Thalamic nuclei, in turn, send information to specific areas in the cerebral cortex. Each pathway consists of three bundles of nerve fibers connected in series:
The secondary neurons in each pathway decussate (cross the spinal cord or brainstem), because the spinal cord develops in segments. Decussated fibers later reach and connect these segments with the higher centers. The optic chiasm is the primary cause of decussation; nasal fibers of the optic nerve cross (so each cerebral hemisphere receives contralateralâoppositeâvision) to keep the interneuronal connections responsible for processing information short. All sensory and motor pathways converge and diverge to the contralateral hemisphere.

Although sensory pathways are often depicted as chains of individual neurons connected in series, this is an oversimplification. Sensory information is processed and modified at each level in the chain by interneurons and input from other areas of the nervous system. For example, cells in the main trigeminal nucleus (Main V in the diagram below) receive input from the reticular formation and cerebellar cortex. This information contributes to the final output of the cells in Main V to the thalamus.

Touch-position information from the body is carried to the thalamus by the medial lemniscus, and from the face by the trigeminal lemniscus (both the anterior and posterior trigeminothalamic tracts). Pain-temperature information from the body is carried to the thalamus by the spinothalamic tract, and from the face by the anterior division of the trigeminal lemniscus (also called the anterior trigeminothalamic tract).

Pathways for touch-position and pain-temperature sensations from the face and body merge in the brainstem, and touch-position and pain-temperature sensory maps of the entire body are projected onto the thalamus. From the thalamus, touch-position and pain-temperature information is projected onto the cerebral cortex.

===Summary===
The complex processing of pain-temperature information in the thalamus and cerebral cortex (as opposed to the relatively simple, straightforward processing of touch-position information) reflects a phylogenetically older, more primitive sensory system. The detailed information received from peripheral touch-position receptors is superimposed on a background of awareness, memory and emotions partially set by peripheral pain-temperature receptors.

Although thresholds for touch-position perception are relatively easy to measure, those for pain-temperature perception are difficult to define and measure. &quot;Touch&quot; is an objective sensation, but &quot;pain&quot; is an individualized sensation which varies among different people and is conditioned by memory and emotion. Anatomical differences between the pathways for touch-position perception and pain-temperature sensation help explain why pain, especially chronic pain, is difficult to manage.

==Trigeminal nuclei==

All sensory information from the face, both touch-position and pain-temperature, is sent to the trigeminal nucleus. In classical anatomy most sensory information from the face is carried by the fifth nerve, but sensation from parts of the mouth, parts of the ear and parts of the meninges is carried by general somatic afferent fibers in cranial nerves VII (the facial nerve), IX (the glossopharyngeal nerve) and X (the vagus nerve).

All sensory fibers from these nerves terminate in the trigeminal nucleus. On entering the brainstem, sensory fibers from V, VII, IX and X are sorted and sent to the trigeminal nucleus (which contains a sensory map of the face and mouth). The spinal counterparts of the trigeminal nucleus (cells in the dorsal horn and dorsal column nuclei of the spinal cord) contain a sensory map of the rest of the body.

The trigeminal nucleus extends throughout the brainstem, from the midbrain to the medulla, continuing into the cervical cord (where it merges with the dorsal horn cells of the spinal cord). The nucleus is divided into three parts, visible in microscopic sections of the brainstem. From caudal to rostral (ascending from the medulla to the midbrain), they are the spinal trigeminal, the principal sensory and the mesencephalic nuclei. The parts of the trigeminal nucleus receive different types of sensory information; the spinal trigeminal nucleus receives pain-temperature fibers, the principal sensory nucleus receives touch-position fibers and the mesencephalic nucleus receives proprioceptor and mechanoreceptor fibers from the jaws and teeth.

===Spinal trigeminal nucleus===
The spinal trigeminal nucleus represents pain-temperature sensation from the face. Pain-temperature fibers from peripheral nociceptors are carried in cranial nerves V, VII, IX and X. On entering the brainstem, sensory fibers are grouped and sent to the spinal trigeminal nucleus. This bundle of incoming fibers can be identified in cross-sections of the pons and medulla as the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus, which parallels the spinal trigeminal nucleus. The spinal tract of V is analogous to, and continuous with, Lissauer&#x27;s tract in the spinal cord.

The spinal trigeminal nucleus contains a pain-temperature sensory map of the face and mouth. From the spinal trigeminal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the trigeminothalamic (quintothalamic) tract to the contralateral thalamus. Pain-temperature fibers are sent to multiple thalamic nuclei. The central processing of pain-temperature information differs from the processing of touch-position information.

====Somatotopic representation====

Exactly how pain-temperature fibers from the face are distributed to the spinal trigeminal nucleus is disputed. The present general understanding is that pain-temperature information from all areas of the human body is represented in the spinal cord and brainstem in an ascending, caudal-to-rostral fashion. Information from the lower extremities is represented in the lumbar cord, and that from the upper extremities in the thoracic cord. Information from the neck and the back of the head is represented in the cervical cord, and that from the face and mouth in the spinal trigeminal nucleus.

Within the spinal trigeminal nucleus, information is represented in a layered, or &quot;onion-skin&quot; fashion. The lowest levels of the nucleus (in the upper cervical cord and lower medulla) represent peripheral areas of the face (the scalp, ears and chin). Higher levels (in the upper medulla) represent central areas (nose, cheeks and lips). The highest levels (in the pons) represent the mouth, teeth and pharyngeal cavity. 

The onion skin distribution differs from the dermatome distribution of the peripheral branches of the fifth nerve. Lesions which destroy lower areas of the spinal trigeminal nucleus (but spare higher areas) preserve pain-temperature sensation in the nose (V1), upper lip (V2) and mouth (V3) and remove pain-temperature sensation from the forehead (V1), cheeks (V2) and chin (V3). Although analgesia in this distribution is &quot;nonphysiologic&quot; in the traditional sense (because it crosses several dermatomes), this analgesia is found in humans after surgical sectioning of the spinal tract of the trigeminal nucleus.

The spinal trigeminal nucleus sends pain-temperature information to the thalamus and sends information to the mesencephalon and the reticular formation of the brainstem. The latter pathways are analogous to the spinomesencephalic and spinoreticular tracts of the spinal cord, which send pain-temperature information from the rest of the body to the same areas. The mesencephalon modulates painful input before it reaches the level of consciousness. The reticular formation is responsible for the automatic (unconscious) orientation of the body to painful stimuli. Incidentally, Sulfur-containing compounds found in plants in the onion family stimulate receptors found in trigeminal ganglia, bypassing the olfactory system.

===Principal nucleus===
The principal nucleus represents touch-pressure sensation from the face. It is located in the pons, near the entrance for the fifth nerve. Fibers carrying touch-position information from the face and mouth via cranial nerves V, VII, IX, and X are sent to this nucleus when they enter the brainstem.

The principal nucleus contains a touch-position sensory map of the face and mouth, just as the spinal trigeminal nucleus contains a complete pain-temperature map. This nucleus is analogous to the dorsal column nuclei (the gracile and cuneate nuclei) of the spinal cord, which contain a touch-position map of the rest of the body.

From the principal nucleus, secondary fibers cross the midline and ascend in the ventral trigeminothalamic tract to the contralateral thalamus. The ventral trigeminothalamic tract runs parallel to the medial lemniscus, which carries touch-position information from the rest of the body to the thalamus.

Some sensory information from the teeth and jaws is sent from the principal nucleus to the ipsilateral thalamus via the small dorsal trigeminal tract. Touch-position information from the teeth and jaws of one side of the face is represented bilaterally in the thalamus and cortex.

===Mesencephalic nucleus===
The mesencephalic nucleus is not a true nucleus; it is a sensory ganglion (like the trigeminal ganglion) embedded in the brainstem and the sole exception to the rule that sensory information passes through peripheral sensory ganglia before entering the central nervous system. It has been found in all vertebrates except lampreys and hagfishes. They are the only vertebrates without jaws and have specific cells in their brainstems. These &quot;internal ganglion&quot; cells were discovered in the late 19th century by medical student Sigmund Freud.

Two types of sensory fibers have cell bodies in the mesencephalic nucleus: proprioceptor fibers from the jaw and mechanoreceptor fibers from the teeth. Some of these incoming fibers go to the motor nucleus of the trigeminal nerve (V), bypassing the pathways for conscious perception. The jaw jerk reflex is an example; tapping the jaw elicits a reflex closure of the jaw in the same way that tapping the knee elicits a reflex kick of the lower leg. Other incoming fibers from the teeth and jaws go to the main nucleus of V. This information is projected bilaterally to the thalamus and available for conscious perception.

Activities such as biting, chewing and swallowing require symmetrical, simultaneous coordination of both sides of the body. They are automatic activities, requiring little conscious attention and involving a sensory component (feedback about touch-position) processed at the unconscious level in the mesencephalic nucleus.

===Pathways to the thalamus and cortex===
Sensation has been defined as the conscious perception of touch-position and pain-temperature information. With the exception of smell, all sensory input (touch-position, pain-temperature, sight, taste, hearing and balance) is sent to the thalamus and then the cortex. The thalamus is anatomically subdivided into nuclei.

===Touch-position sensation===

Touch-position information from the body is sent to the ventral posterolateral nucleus (VPL) of the thalamus. Touch-position information from the face is sent to the ventral posteromedial nucleus (VPM) of the thalamus. From the VPL and VPM, information is projected to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) in the parietal lobe.

The representation of sensory information in the postcentral gyrus is organized somatotopically. Adjacent areas of the body are represented by adjacent areas in the cortex. When body parts are drawn in proportion to the density of their innervation, the result is a &quot;little man&quot;: the cortical homunculus.

Many textbooks have reproduced the outdated Penfield-Rasmussen diagram [ref?], with the toes and genitals on the mesial surface of the cortex when they are actually represented on the convexity. The classic diagram implies a single primary sensory map of the body, when there are multiple primary maps. At least four separate, anatomically distinct sensory homunculi have been identified in the postcentral gyrus. They represent combinations of input from surface and deep receptors and rapidly and slowly adapting peripheral receptors; smooth objects will activate certain cells, and rough objects will activate other cells.

Information from all four maps in SI is sent to the secondary sensory cortex (SII) in the parietal lobe. SII contains two more sensory homunculi. Information from one side of the body is generally represented on the opposite side in SI, but on both sides in SII. Functional MRI imaging of a defined stimulus (for example, stroking the skin with a toothbrush) &quot;lights up&quot; a single focus in SI and two foci in SII.

===Pain-temperature sensation===
Pain-temperature information is sent to the VPL (body) and VPM (face) of the thalamus (the same nuclei which receive touch-position information). From the thalamus, pain-temperature and touch-position information is projected onto SI.

Unlike touch-position information, however, pain-temperature information is also sent to other thalamic nuclei and projected onto additional areas of the cerebral cortex. Some pain-temperature fibers are sent to the medial dorsal thalamic nucleus (MD), which projects to the anterior cingulate cortex. Other fibers are sent to the ventromedial (VM) nucleus of the thalamus, which projects to the insular cortex. Finally, some fibers are sent to the intralaminar nucleus (IL) of the thalamus via the reticular formation. The IL projects diffusely to all parts of the cerebral cortex.

The insular and cingulate cortices are parts of the brain which represent touch-position and pain-temperature in the context of other simultaneous perceptions (sight, smell, taste, hearing and balance) in the context of memory and emotional state. Peripheral pain-temperature information is channeled directly to the brain at a deep level, without prior processing. Touch-position information is handled differently. Diffuse thalamic projections from the IL and other thalamic nuclei are responsible for a given level of consciousness, with the thalamus and reticular formation &quot;activating&quot; the brain; peripheral pain-temperature information also feeds directly into this system.

==Clinical significance==
*Trigeminal neuralgia
*Cluster headache
*Migraine
===Lateral medullary syndrome===

Lateral medullary syndrome (Wallenberg syndrome) is a clinical demonstration of the anatomy of the trigeminal nerve, summarizing how it processes sensory information. A stroke usually affects only one side of the body; loss of sensation due to a stroke will be lateralized to the right or the left side of the body. The only exceptions to this rule are certain spinal-cord lesions and the medullary syndromes, of which Wallenberg syndrome is the best-known example. In this syndrome, a stroke causes a loss of pain-temperature sensation from one side of the face and the other side of the body.

This is explained by the anatomy of the brainstem. In the medulla, the ascending spinothalamic tract (which carries pain-temperature information from the opposite side of the body) is adjacent to the ascending spinal tract of the trigeminal nerve (which carries pain-temperature information from the same side of the face). A stroke which cuts off the blood supply to this area (for example, a clot in the posterior inferior cerebellar artery) destroys both tracts simultaneously. The result is a loss of pain-temperature (but not touch-position) sensation in a &quot;checkerboard&quot; pattern (ipsilateral face, contralateral body), facilitating diagnosis.

===Sensory neuronopathy===
Sensory neuronopathy (also known as sensory ganglionopathy) is a type of peripheral neuropathy in which sensory nerve cell bodies in the dorsal root ganglia, commonly including the trigeminal ganglion of the trigeminal nerve, are damaged due to a variety of mechanisms leading to sensory symptoms such as parasthesias, dysesthesias, or hyperalgesia in the affected nerve distribution including the distribution of the trigeminal nerve.

<doc id="243326" wikidata="Q319317" url="?curid=243326" title="Vestibulocochlear nerve">
<text>The vestibulocochlear nerve or auditory vestibular nerve, also known as the eighth cranial nerve, cranial nerve VIII, or simply CN VIII, is a cranial nerve that transmits sound and equilibrium (balance) information from the inner ear to the brain. Through olivocochlear fibers, it also transmits motor and modulatory information from the superior olivary complex in the brainstem to the cochlea.

==Structure==
The vestibulocochlear nerve consists mostly of bipolar neurons and splits into two large divisions: the cochlear nerve and the vestibular nerve.

Cranial nerve 8, the vestibulocochlear nerve, goes to the middle portion of the brainstem called the pons (which then is largely composed of fibers going to the cerebellum). 
The 8th cranial nerve runs between the base of the pons and medulla oblongata (the lower portion of the brainstem). This junction between the pons, medulla, and cerebellum that contains the 8th nerve is called the cerebellopontine angle.
The vestibulocochlear nerve is accompanied by the labyrinthine artery, which usually branches off from the anterior inferior cerebellar artery at the cerebellopontine angle, and then goes with the 7th nerve through the internal acoustic meatus to the internal ear.

The cochlear nerve travels away from the cochlea of the inner ear where it starts as the spiral ganglia. Processes from the organ of Corti conduct afferent transmission to the spiral ganglia. It is the inner hair cells of the organ of Corti that are responsible for activation of afferent receptors in response to pressure waves reaching the basilar membrane through the transduction of sound. The exact mechanism by which sound is transmitted by the neurons of the cochlear nerve is uncertain; the two competing theories are place theory and temporal theory.

The vestibular nerve travels from the vestibular system of the inner ear. The vestibular ganglion houses the cell bodies of the bipolar neurons and extends processes to five sensory organs. Three of these are the cristae located in the ampullae of the semicircular canals. Hair cells of the cristae activate afferent receptors in response to rotational acceleration. The other two sensory organs supplied by the vestibular neurons are the maculae of the saccule and utricle. Hair cells of the maculae in the utricle activate afferent receptors in response to linear acceleration, while hair cells of the maculae in the saccule respond to vertically directed linear force.

===Development===
The vestibulocochlear nerve is derived from the embryonic otic placode.

==Function==
This is the nerve along which the sensory cells (the hair cells) of the inner ear transmit information to the brain. It consists of the cochlear nerve, carrying details about hearing, and the vestibular nerve, carrying information about balance and spatial orientation.
It emerges from the pontomedullary junction and exits the inner skull via the internal acoustic meatus in the temporal bone.

The vestibulocochlear nerve carries axons of type special somatic afferent.

==Clinical significance==

===Symptoms of damage===
Damage to the vestibulocochlear nerve may cause the following symptoms:
*hearing loss
*vertigo
*false sense of motion
*loss of equilibrium (in dark places)
*nystagmus
*motion sickness
*gaze-evoked tinnitus.

===Examination===
Examinations that can be done include the Rinne and Weber tests.

Rinne&#x27;s test involves Rinne&#x27;s Right and Left Test, since auditory acuity is equal in both ears. If bone conduction (BC) is more than air conduction (AC) (BC&gt;AC) indicates Rinne Test is negative or abnormal. If AC&gt;BC Rinne test is normal or positive. If BC&gt;AC and Weber&#x27;s test lateralizes to abnormal side then it is Conductive hearing loss. If AC&gt;BC and Weber&#x27;s test lateralizes to normal side then it concludes Sensorineural hearing loss.

After pure-tone testing, if the AC and BC responses at all frequencies 500â8000Â Hz are better than 25Â dB HL, meaning 0-24Â dB HL, the results are considered normal hearing sensitivity. If the AC and BC are worse than 25Â dB HL at any one or more frequency between 500 and 8000Â Hz, meaning 25+, and there is a no bigger difference between AC and BC beyond 10Â dB at any frequency, there is a sensori-neural hearing loss present. If the BC responses are normal, 0-24Â dB HL, and the AC are worse than 25Â dB HL, as well as a 10Â dB gap between the air and bone responses, a conductive hearing loss is present.
{updated March 2019}

The modified HughsonâWestlake method is used by many audiologists during testing. A battery of (1) otoscopy, to view the ear canal and tympanic membrane, (2) tympanometry, to assess the immittance of the tympanic membrane and how well it moves, (3) otoacoustic emissions, to measure the response of the outer hair cells located in the cochlea, (4) audiobooth pure-tone testing, to obtain thresholds to determine the type, severity, and pathology of the hearing loss present, and (5) speech tests, to measure the patients recognition and ability to repeat the speech heard, is all taken into consideration when diagnosing the pathology of the patient.

==History==

===Etymology===
Some older texts call the nerve the &quot;acoustic&quot; or &quot;auditory nerve&quot;, but these terms have fallen out of widespread use because they fail to recognize the nerve&#x27;s role in the vestibular system. &quot;Vestibulocochlear nerve&quot; is therefore preferred by most.

<text>The glossopharyngeal nerve (), also known as the ninth cranial nerve, cranial nerve IX, or simply CN IX, is a cranial nerve that exits the brainstem from the sides of the upper medulla, just anterior (closer to the nose) to the vagus nerve. Being a mixed nerve (sensorimotor), it carries afferent sensory and efferent motor information. The motor division of the glossopharyngeal nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata, whereas the sensory division originates from the cranial neural crest.

==Structure==
From the anterior portion of the medulla oblongata, the glossopharyngeal nerve passes laterally across or below the flocculus, and leaves the skull through the central part of the jugular foramen. From the superior and inferior ganglia in jugular foramen, it has its own sheath of dura mater. The inferior ganglion on the inferior surface of petrous part of temporal is related with a triangular depression into which the aqueduct of cochlea opens. On the inferior side, the glossopharyngeal nerve is lateral and anterior to the vagus nerve and accessory nerve.

In its passage through the foramen (with X and XI), the glossopharyngeal nerve passes between the internal jugular vein and internal carotid artery. It descends in front of the latter vessel and beneath the styloid process and the muscles connected with it, to the posterior lower border of the stylopharyngeus muscle. It then curves forward, forming an arch on the side of the neck and lying upon the stylopharyngeus and middle pharyngeal constrictor muscle. From there, it passes under cover of the hyoglossus muscle and is finally distributed to the palatine tonsil, the mucous membrane of the fauces and base of the tongue, and the serous glands of the mouth.

=== Branches ===
* tympanic nerve
* stylopharyngeal nerve
* tonsillar nerve
*carotid sinus nerve
* Branches to the posterior third of tongue
* lingual branches
* A communicating branch to the vagus nerve

Note: The glossopharyngeal nerve contributes in the formation of the pharyngeal plexus along with the vagus nerve.

The glossopharyngeal nerve has five distinct general functions:

#Branchial motor (special visceral efferent)supplies the stylopharyngeus muscle. 
#Visceral motor (general visceral efferent)provides parasympathetic innervation of the parotid gland via the otic ganglion
#Visceral sensory (general visceral afferent)carries visceral sensory information from the carotid sinus and carotid body. 
#General sensory (general somatic afferent)provides general sensory information from inner surface of the tympanic membrane, upper pharynx (GVA), and the posterior one-third of the tongue. 
#Visceral afferent (special visceral afferent)provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue, including circumvallate papillae.

The glossopharyngeal nerve as noted above is a mixed nerve consisting of both sensory and motor nerve fibers. The sensory fibers&#x27; origin include the pharynx, middle ear, posterior one-third of the tongue (including taste buds); and the carotid body and sinus. These fibers terminate at the medulla oblongata. The motor fibers&#x27; origin is the medulla oblongata, and they terminate at the parotid salivary gland, the glands of the posterior tongue, and the stylopharyngeus muscle (which dilates the pharynx during swallowing).

===Overview of branchial motor component===

The branchial motor component of CN IX provides voluntary control of the stylopharyngeus muscle, which elevates the pharynx during swallowing and speech.

Origin and central course

The branchial motor component originates from the nucleus ambiguus in the reticular formation of the rostral medulla. Fibers leaving the nucleus ambiguus travel anteriorly and laterally to exit the medulla, along with the other components of CN IX, between the olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle.

Intracranial course

Upon emerging from the lateral aspect of the medulla the branchial motor component joins the other components of CN IX to exit the skull via the jugular foramen. The glossopharyngeal fibers travel just anterior to the cranial nerves X and XI, which also exit the skull via the jugular foramen.

Extra-cranial course and final innervation

Upon exiting the skull the branchial motor fibers descend deep to the temporal styloid process and wrap around the posterior border of the stylopharyngeus muscle before innervating it.

Voluntary control of the stylopharyngeus muscle

Signals for the voluntary movement of stylopharyngeus muscle originate in the pre-motor and motor cortex (in association with other cortical areas) and pass via the corticobulbar tract in the genu of the internal capsule to synapse bilaterally on the ambiguus nuclei in the medulla.

===Overview of visceral motor component===

Parasympathetic component of the glossopharyngeal nerve that innervates the ipsilateral parotid gland.

Origin and central course

The preganglionic nerve fibers originate in the inferior salivatory nucleus of the rostral medulla and travel anteriorly and laterally to exit the brainstem between the medullary olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle with the other components of CN IX. Note: These neurons do not form a distinct nucleus visible on cross-section of the brainstem. The position indicated on the diagram is representative of the location of the cell bodies of these fibers.

Intracranial course

Upon emerging from the lateral aspect of the medulla, the visceral motor fibers join the other components of CN IX to enter the jugular foramen. Within the jugular foramen, there are two glossopharyngeal ganglia that contain nerve cell bodies that mediate general, visceral, and special sensation. The visceral motor fibers pass through both ganglia without synapsing and exit the inferior ganglion with CN IX general sensory fibers as the tympanic nerve. Before exiting the jugular foramen, the tympanic nerve enters the petrous portion of the temporal bone and ascends via the inferior tympanic canaliculus to the tympanic cavity. Within the tympanic cavity the tympanic nerve forms a plexus on the surface of the promontory of the middle ear to provide general sensation. The visceral motor fibers pass through this plexus and merge to become the lesser petrosal nerve. The lesser petrosal nerve re-enters and travels through the temporal bone to emerge in the middle cranial fossa just lateral to the greater petrosal nerve. It then proceeds anteriorly to exit the skull via the foramen ovale along with the mandibular nerve component of CN V (V3).

Extra-cranial course and final innervations

Upon exiting the skull, the lesser petrosal nerve synapses in the otic ganglion, which is suspended from the mandibular nerve immediately below the foramen ovale. Postganglionic fibers from the otic ganglion travel with the auriculotemporal branch of CN V3 to enter the substance of the parotid gland.

Hypothalamic Influence

Fibers from the hypothalamus and olfactory system project via the dorsal longitudinal fasciculus to influence the output of the inferior salivatory nucleus. Examples include: 1) dry mouth in response to fear (mediated by the hypothalamus); 2) salivation in response to smelling food (mediated by the olfactory system)

===Overview of visceral sensory component===

This component of CN IX innervates the baroreceptors of the carotid sinus and chemoreceptors of the carotid body.
;Peripheral and intracranial course.
:Sensory fibers arise from the carotid sinus and carotid body at the common carotid artery bifurcation, ascend in the carotid sinus nerve, and join the other components of CN IX at the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion. The cell bodies of these neurons reside in the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion. The central processes of these neurons enter the skull via the jugular foramen.
;Central course â visceral sensory component
:Once inside the skull, the visceral sensory fibers enter the lateral medulla between the olive and the inferior cerebellar peduncle and descend in the solitary tract to synapse in the caudal solitary nucleus. From the solitary nucleus, connections are made with several areas in the reticular formation and hypothalamus to mediate cardiovascular and respiratory reflex responses to changes in blood pressure, and serum concentrations of CO2 and O2.

Clinical correlation 
The visceral sensory fibers of CN IX mediate the afferent limb of the pharyngeal reflex in which touching the back of the pharynx stimulates the patient to gag (i.e., the gag reflex). The efferent signal to the musculature of the pharynx is carried by the branchial motor fibers of the vagus nerve. 

===Overview of somatic sensory component===

This component of CN IX carries general sensory information (pain, temperature, and touch) from the skin of the external ear, internal surface of the tympanic membrane, the walls of the upper pharynx, and the posterior one-third of the tongue, anterior surface of the epiglottis, vallecula.
;Peripheral course
:Sensory fibers from the skin of the external ear initially travel with the auricular branch of CN X, while those from the middle ear travel in the tympanic nerve as discussed above (CN IX visceral motor section). General sensory information from the upper pharynx and posterior one-third of the tongue travel via the pharyngeal branches of CN IX. These peripheral processes have their cell body in either the superior or inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion.
;Central course
:The central processes of the general sensory neurons exit the glossopharyngeal ganglia and pass through the jugular foramen to enter the brainstem at the level of the medulla. Upon entering the medulla these fibers descend in the spinal trigeminal tract and synapse in the caudal spinal nucleus of the trigeminal.

===Overview of special sensory component===

The special sensory component of CN IX provides taste sensation from the posterior one-third of the tongue. 
;Peripheral course
:Special sensory fibers from the posterior one-third of the tongue travel via the pharyngeal branches of CN IX to the inferior glossopharyngeal ganglion where their cell bodies reside.
;Central course â special sensory component
:The central processes of these neurons exit the inferior ganglion and pass through the jugular foramen to enter the brainstem at the level of the rostral medulla between the olive and inferior cerebellar peduncle. Upon entering the medulla, these fibers ascend in the tractus solitarius and synapse in the gustatory part of nucleus solitarius. Taste fibers from CN VII and X also ascend and synapse here. Ascending secondary neurons originating in nucleus solitarius project bilaterally to the ventral posteromedial (VPM) nuclei of the thalamus via the central tegmental tract. Tertiary neurons from the thalamus project via the posterior limb of the internal capsule to the inferior one-third of the primary sensory cortex (the gustatory cortex of the parietal lobe).

===Associated brainstem nuclei===

* Solitary nucleus: taste from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue and information from carotid sinus baroreceptors and carotid body chemoreceptors
* Spinal nucleus of the trigeminal nerve: Somatic sensory fibers from the internal surface of the tympanic membrane, middle ear, upper part of the pharynx, soft palate and posterior 1/3 of the tongue
* Nucleus ambiguus: lower motor neurons for the stylopharyngeus muscle
* Inferior salivatory nucleus: preganglionic parasympathetic neurons to the otic ganglion and then to the parotid gland

==Functions==
* It receives general somatic sensory fibers (ventral trigeminothalamic tract) from the tonsils, the pharynx, the middle ear and the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.
* It receives special visceral sensory fibers (taste) from the posterior 1/3 of the tongue.
* It receives visceral sensory fibers from the carotid bodies, carotid sinus.
* It supplies parasympathetic fibers to the parotid gland via the otic ganglion.
* It supplies motor fibers to stylopharyngeus muscle, the only motor component of this cranial nerve.
* It contributes to the pharyngeal plexus.

==Clinical significance==
===Damage===
Damage to the glossopharyngeal nerve can result in loss of taste sensation to the posterior one third of the tongue, and impaired swallowing.

===Examination===
The clinical tests used to determine if the glossopharyngeal nerve has been damaged include testing the gag reflex of the mouth, asking the patient to swallow or cough, and evaluating for speech impediments. The clinician may also test the posterior one-third of the tongue with bitter and sour substances to evaluate for impairment of taste.

The integrity of the glossopharyngeal nerve may be evaluated by testing the patient&#x27;s general sensation and that of taste on the posterior third of the tongue. The gag reflex can also be used to evaluate the glossopharyngeal nerve.

<text>In marketing, the whole product concept is the third iteration of a model originally developed by Philip Kotler, a professor at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University.

In his book entitled âMarketing Managementâ Kotler drew attention to the fact that consumers purchase more than the core product itself. And understanding the perception of value from the customerâs point of view, can help salespeople meet customer expectations.

Kotlerâs Five Product Levels Model outlines a hierarchy of product features, starting with the core product and progressing through expected features, augmented features, and potential future enhancements.

Following the insights provided by Philip Kotler, Ted Levitt, a professor at Harvard Business School, elaborated on the fact that consumers purchase more than core features and functions. Rather, they purchase the core product combined with complimentary attributes, the majority of which are intangible.

The total product was Levittâs vision of how intangible elements could be added to a physical product, transforming it into an offering that was often more valuable than the physical attributes alone.

The total product concept was also refined by Tom Peters. In a 1986 publication entitled &quot;The Eye of the Beholder&quot;, Peters proposed an extension to Levittâs total product concept that describes the discrepancy between insider and customer perceptions in three different types of industries.

Following the insights provided by Philip Kotler, Ted Levitt and later Tom Peters, Regis McKenna renamed the total product concept, calling it the &quot;whole product&quot; which he defined as a generic or core product, augmented by everything that is needed for the customer to have a compelling reason to buy.

A fourth iteration has been suggested by Warren Schirtzinger called the Low Risk Recipe. Schirtzinger organizes intangible product attributes into three groups that surround the core innovation, and act to lower the end user&#x27;s perception of risk and encourage the adoption of a new innovation;

* End User Harmony - &quot;closeness and understanding that allows the supplier to see the world from the customerâs point of view, and create a product that fits them so well, that it sells itself.&quot;
* Reliability and Commitment - &quot;the supplier performs consistently well and in a trustworthy manner, which demonstrates the characteristics of an ideal partner with the required domain expertise&quot;
* Safety in Numbers - &quot;an independent ecosystem that increases the buyerâs confidence, provides unbiased support and reduces the perception of risk&quot;

Working together with Warren Schirtzinger, Jose Bermejo suggested new intangible attributes that apply specifically to software products. Jose&#x27;s angle sees the intangible elements of the Schirtzinger&#x27;s Low Risk Reinvention as a way to build a brand beyond a core product and named his refined approach for software-based products The Brand Development Wheelâ¢. He also separates the tangible dimensions of product and technology to differentiate what is required by innovators versus what is required by early adopters.

<text>The accessory nerve, also known as the eleventh cranial nerve, cranial nerve XI, or simply CN XI, is a cranial nerve that supplies the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. It is classified as the eleventh of twelve pairs of cranial nerves because part of it was formerly believed to originate in the brain. The sternocleidomastoid muscle tilts and rotates the head, whereas the trapezius muscle, connecting to the scapula, acts to shrug the shoulder.

Traditional descriptions of the accessory nerve divide it into a spinal part and a cranial part. The cranial component rapidly joins the vagus nerve, and there is ongoing debate about whether the cranial part should be considered part of the accessory nerve proper. Consequently, the term &quot;accessory nerve&quot; usually refers only to nerve supplying the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles, also called the spinal accessory nerve.

Strength testing of these muscles can be measured during a neurological examination to assess function of the spinal accessory nerve. Poor strength or limited movement are suggestive of damage, which can result from a variety of causes. Injury to the spinal accessory nerve is most commonly caused by medical procedures that involve the head and neck. Injury can cause wasting of the shoulder muscles, winging of the scapula, and weakness of shoulder abduction and external rotation.

The accessory nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1âC6.

==Structure==

The fibres of the spinal accessory nerve originate solely in neurons situated in the upper spinal cord, from where the spinal cord begins at the junction with the medulla oblongata, to the level of about C6. These fibres join to form rootlets, roots, and finally the spinal accessory nerve itself. The formed nerve enters the skull through the foramen magnum, the large opening at the skull&#x27;s base. The nerve travels along the inner wall of the skull towards the jugular foramen. Leaving the skull, the nerve travels through the jugular foramen with the glossopharyngeal and vagus nerves. The spinal accessory nerve is notable for being the only cranial nerve to both enter and exit the skull. This is due to it being unique among the cranial nerves in having neurons in the spinal cord.

After leaving the skull, the cranial component detaches from the spinal component. The spinal accessory nerve continues alone and heads backwards and downwards. In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around the level of the posterior belly of digastric muscle. As it courses downwards, the nerve pierces through the sternocleidomastoid muscle (approximately 1Â cm above Erb&#x27;s point) while sending it motor branches, then continues down until it reaches the trapezius muscle (entering at the junction of the middle and lower third of the anterior border of the trapezius) to provide motor innervation to its upper part.

===Nucleus===
The fibres that form the spinal accessory nerve are formed by lower motor neurons located in the upper segments of the spinal cord. This cluster of neurons, called the spinal accessory nucleus, is located in the lateral aspect of the anterior horn of the spinal cord, and stretches from where the spinal cord begins (at the junction with the medulla) through to the level of about C6. The lateral horn of high cervical segments appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla oblongata, from which the cranial component of the accessory nerve is derived.

=== Variation ===
In the neck, the accessory nerve crosses the internal jugular vein around the level of the posterior belly of digastric muscle, in front of the vein in about 80% of people, and behind it in about 20%, and in one reported case, piercing the vein.

Traditionally, the accessory nerve is described as having a small cranial component that descends from the medulla and briefly connects with the spinal accessory component before branching off of the nerve to join the vagus nerve. A study, published in 2007, of twelve subjects suggests that in the majority of individuals, this cranial component does not make any distinct connection to the spinal component; the roots of these distinct components were separated by a fibrous sheath in all but one subject.

===Development===
The accessory nerve is derived from the basal plate of the embryonic spinal segments C1âC6.

==Function==

The spinal component of the accessory nerve provides motor control of the sternocleidomastoid and trapezius muscles. The trapezius muscle controls the action of shrugging the shoulders, and the sternocleidomastoid the action of turning the head. Like most muscles, control of the trapezius muscle arises from the opposite side of the brain. Contraction of the upper part of the trapezius muscle elevates the scapula. The nerve fibres supplying sternocleidomastoid, however, are thought to change sides () twice. This means that the sternocleidomastoid is controlled by the brain on the same side of the body. Contraction of the stenocleidomastoid fibres turns the head to the opposite side, the net effect meaning that the head is turned to the side of the brain receiving visual information from that area. The cranial component of the accessory nerve, on the other hand, provides motor control to the muscles of the soft palate, larynx and pharynx.

===Classification===
Among researchers there is disagreement regarding the terminology used to describe the type of information carried by the accessory nerve. As the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles are derived from the pharyngeal arches, some researchers believe the spinal accessory nerve that innervates them must carry specific special visceral efferent (SVE) information. This is in line with the observation that the spinal accessory nucleus appears to be continuous with the nucleus ambiguus of the medulla. Others consider the spinal accessory nerve to carry general somatic efferent (GSE) information. Still others believe it is reasonable to conclude that the spinal accessory nerve contains both SVE and GSE components.

==Clinical significance==
===Examination===
The accessory nerve is tested by evaluating the function of the trapezius and sternocleidomastoid muscles. The trapezius muscle is tested by asking the patient to shrug their shoulders with and without resistance. The sternocleidomastoid muscle is tested by asking the patient to turn their head to the left or right against resistance.

One-sided weakness of the trapezius may indicate injury to the nerve on the same side of an injury to the spinal accessory nerve on the same side () of the body being assessed. Weakness in head-turning suggests injury to the contralateral spinal accessory nerve: a weak leftward turn is indicative of a weak right sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus right spinal accessory nerve injury), while a weak rightward turn is indicative of a weak left sternocleidomastoid muscle (and thus left spinal accessory nerve).

Hence, weakness of shrug on one side and head-turning on the other side may indicate damage to the accessory nerve on the side of the shrug weakness, or damage along the nerve pathway at the other side of the brain. Causes of damage may include trauma, surgery, tumours, and compression at the jugular foramen. Weakness in both muscles may point to a more general disease process such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, GuillainâBarrÃ© syndrome or poliomyelitis.

=== Injury ===

Injury to the spinal accessory nerve commonly occurs during neck surgery, including neck dissection and lymph node excision. It can also occur as a result of blunt or penetrating trauma, and in some causes spontaneously. Damage at any point along the nerve&#x27;s course will affect the function of the nerve. The nerve is intentionally removed in &quot;radical&quot; neck dissections, which are attempts at exploring the neck surgically for the presence and extent of cancer. Attempts are made to spare it in other forms of less aggressive dissection.

Injury to the accessory nerve can result in neck pain and weakness of the trapezius muscle. Symptoms will depend on at what point along its length the nerve was severed. Injury to the nerve can result in shoulder girdle depression, atrophy, abnormal movement, a protruding scapula, and weakened abduction. Weakness of the shoulder girdle can lead to traction injury of the brachial plexus. Because diagnosis is difficult, electromyogram or nerve conduction studies may be needed to confirm a suspected injury. Outcomes with surgical treatment appear to be better than conservative management, which entails physiotherapy and pain relief. Surgical management includes neurolysis, nerve end-to-end suturing, and surgical replacement of affected trapezius muscle segments with other muscle groups, such as the Eden-Lange procedure.

Damage to the nerve can cause torticollis.

==History==
English anatomist Thomas Willis in 1664 first described the accessory nerve, choosing to use &quot;accessory&quot; (described in Latin as &quot;nervus accessorius&quot;) meaning in association with the vagus nerve.

In 1848, Jones Quain described the nerve as the &quot;spinal nerve accessory to the vagus&quot;, recognizing that while a minor component of the nerve joins with the larger vagus nerve, the majority of accessory nerve fibres originate in the spinal cord. In 1893 it was recognised that the heretofore named nerve fibres &quot;accessory&quot; to the vagus originated from the same nucleus in the medulla oblongata, and it came to pass that these fibres were increasingly viewed as part of the vagus nerve itself. Consequently, the term &quot;accessory nerve&quot; was and is increasingly used to denote only fibres from the spinal cord; the fact that only the spinal portion could be tested clinically lent weight to this opinion.

<text>The hypoglossal nerve, also known as the twelfth cranial nerve, cranial nerve XII, or simply CN XII, is a cranial nerve that innervates all the extrinsic and intrinsic muscles of the tongue except for the palatoglossus, which is innervated by the vagus nerve. 

CN XII is a nerve with a sole motor function. The nerve arises from the hypoglossal nucleus in the medulla as a number of small rootlets, pass through the hypoglossal canal and down through the neck, and eventually passes up again over the tongue muscles it supplies into the tongue.

The nerve is involved in controlling tongue movements required for speech and swallowing, including sticking out the tongue and moving it from side to side. Damage to the nerve or the neural pathways which control it can affect the ability of the tongue to move and its appearance, with the most common sources of damage being injury from trauma or surgery, and motor neuron disease. The first recorded description of the nerve was by Herophilos in the third century BC. The name hypoglossus springs from the fact that its passage is below the tongue, from &quot;hypo&quot; () and &quot;glossa&quot; ().

==Structure==
The hypoglossal nerve arises as a number of small rootlets from the front of the medulla, the bottom part of the brainstem, in the anterolateral sulcus which separates the olive and the pyramid. The nerve passes through the subarachnoid space and pierces the dura mater near the hypoglossal canal, an opening in the occipital bone of the skull.

After emerging from the hypoglossal canal, the hypoglossal nerve gives off a meningeal branch and picks up a branch from the anterior ramus of C1. It then travels close to the vagus nerve and spinal division of the accessory nerve, spirals downwards behind the vagus nerve and passes between the internal carotid artery and internal jugular vein lying on the carotid sheath.

At a point at the level of the angle of the mandible, the hypoglossal nerve emerges from behind the posterior belly of the digastric muscle. It then loops around a branch of the occipital artery and travels forward into the region beneath the mandible. The hypoglossal nerve moves forward lateral to the hyoglossus and medial to the stylohyoid muscles and lingual nerve. It continues deep to the genioglossus muscle and continues forward to the tip of the tongue. It distributes branches to the intrinsic and extrinsic muscle of the tongue innervates as it passes in this direction, and supplies several muscles (hyoglossus, genioglossus and styloglossus) that it passes.

The rootlets of the hypoglossal nerve arise from the hypoglossal nucleus near the bottom of the brain stem. The hypoglossal nucleus receives input from both the motor cortices but the contralateral input is dominant; innervation of the tongue is essentially lateralized. Signals from muscle spindles on the tongue travel through the hypoglossal nerve, moving onto the lingual nerve which synapses on the trigeminal mesencephalic nucleus.

===Development===
Neurons of the hypoglossal nucleus are derived from the basal plate of the embryonic medulla oblongata. The musculature they supply develops as the hypoglossal cord from the myotomes of the first four pairs of occipital somites. The nerve is first visible as a series of roots in the fourth week of development, which have formed a single nerve and link to the tongue by the fifth week.

==Function==

The hypoglossal nerve provides motor control of the extrinsic muscles of the tongue: genioglossus, hyoglossus, styloglossus, and the intrinsic muscles of the tongue. These represent all muscles of the tongue except the palatoglossus muscle, which is innervated by the vagus nerve. The hypoglossal nerve is of a general somatic efferent (GSE) type.

These muscles are involved in moving and manipulating the tongue. The left and right genioglossus muscles in particular are responsible for protruding the tongue. The muscles, attached to the underside of the top and back parts of the tongue, cause the tongue to protrude and deviate towards the opposite side. The hypoglossal nerve also supplies movements including clearing the mouth of saliva and other involuntary activities. The hypoglossal nucleus interacts with the reticular formation, involved in the control of several reflexive or automatic motions, and several corticonuclear originating fibers supply innervation aiding in unconscious movements relating to speech and articulation.

==Clinical significance==

===Damage===

Reports of damage to the hypoglossal nerve are rare. The most common causes of injury in one case series were compression by tumours and gunshot wounds. A wide variety of other causes can lead to damage of the nerve. These include surgical damage, medullary stroke, multiple sclerosis, Guillain-Barre syndrome, infection, sarcoidosis, and presence of an ectatic vessel in the hypoglossal canal. Damage can be on one or both sides, which will affect symptoms that the damage causes. Because of the close proximity of the nerve to other structures including nerves, arteries, and veins, it is rare for the nerve to be damaged in isolation. For example, damage to the left and right hypoglossal nerves may occur with damage to the facial and trigeminal nerves as a result of damage from a clot following arteriosclerosis of the vertebrobasilar artery. Such a stroke may result in tight oral musculature, and difficulty speaking, eating and chewing.

Progressive bulbar palsy, a form of motor neuron disease, is associated with combined lesions of the hypoglossal nucleus and nucleus ambiguus with wasting (atrophy) of the motor nerves of the pons and medulla. This may cause difficulty with tongue movements, speech, chewing and swallowing caused by dysfunction of several cranial nerve nuclei. Motor neuron disease is the most common disease affecting the hypoglossal nerve.

===Examination===
 
The hypoglossal nerve is tested by examining the tongue and its movements. At rest, if the nerve is injured a tongue may appear to have the appearance of a &quot;bag of worms&quot; (fasciculations) or wasting (atrophy). The nerve is then tested by sticking the tongue out. If there is damage to the nerve or its pathways, the tongue will usually but not always deviate to one side, due to the genioglossus muscle receiving nerve signals on one side but not the other. When the nerve is damaged, the tongue may feel &quot;thick,&quot; &quot;heavy,&quot; or &quot;clumsy.&quot; Weakness of tongue muscles can result in slurred speech, affecting sounds particularly dependent on the tongue for generation (i.e., lateral approximants, dental stops, alveolar stops, velar nasals, rhotic consonants etc.). Tongue strength may be tested by poking the tongue against the inside of their cheek, while an examiner feels or presses from the cheek.

The hypoglossal nerve carries lower motor neurons that synapse with upper motor neurons at the hypoglossal nucleus. Symptoms related to damage will depend on the position of damage in this pathway. If the damage is to the nerve itself (a lower motor neuron lesion), the tongue will curve toward the damaged side, owing to weakness of the genioglossus muscle of affected side which action is to deviate the tongue in the contralateral side . If the damage is to the nerve pathway (an upper motor neuron lesion) the tongue will curve away from the side of damage, due to action of the affected genioglossus muscle, and will occur without fasciculations or wasting, with speech difficulties more evident. Damage to the hypoglossal nucleus will lead to wasting of muscles of the tongue and deviation towards the affected side when it is stuck out. This is because of the weaker genioglossal muscle.

===Use in nerve repair===
The hypoglossal nerve may be connected (anastomosed) to the facial nerve to attempt to restore function when the facial nerve is damaged. Attempts at repair by either wholly or partially connecting nerve fibres from the hypoglossal nerve to the facial nerve may be used when there is focal facial nerve damage (for example, from trauma or cancer).

=== Hypoglossal nerve stimulator implant ===
The hypoglossal nerve has also been clinically implicated in the treatment of obstructive sleep apnea. Certain patients with obstructive sleep apnea who are deemed eligible candidates (e.g., failed continuous positive airway pressure therapy, underwent appropriate testing with drug induced sleep endoscopy, and meet other criteria as outlined by the FDA) may be offered the hypoglossal nerve stimulator as an alternative. The purpose of the hypoglossal nerve stimulator is to relieve tongue base obstruction during sleep by stimulating the tongue to protrude during inspiration (i.e., inhale).

In this procedure, an electrical stimulator lead is placed around branches of the hypoglossal nerve that control tongue protrusion (e.g., genioglossus) via an incision in the neck. A sensor lead is then placed in the chest between the ribs in the layer between the internal intercostal muscles and external intercostal muscles. The stimulator and sensory lead are then connected via a tunneled wire to an implantable pulse generator. When turned on during sleep, the sensory lead in the chest detects the respiratory cycle. During inspiration (i.e., inhale), an electrical signal is fired via the stimulator lead in the neck, stimulating the hypoglossal nerve, and causing the tongue to protrude, thereby alleviating obstruction.

==History==
The first recorded description of the hypoglossal nerve was by Herophilos (335â280 BC), although it was not named at the time. The first use of the name &quot;hypoglossal&quot; in Latin as &quot;nervi hypoglossi externa&quot; was used by Winslow in 1733. This was followed though by several different namings including &quot;nervi indeterminati&quot;, &quot;par lingual&quot;, &quot;par gustatorium&quot;, &quot;great sub-lingual&quot; by different authors, and &quot;gustatory nerve&quot; and &quot;lingual nerve&quot; (by Winslow). It was listed in 1778 as &quot;nerve hypoglossum magnum&quot; by Soemmering. It was then named as the &quot;great hypoglossal nerve&quot; by Cuvier in 1800 as a translation of Winslow and finally named in English by Knox in 1832.

== Other animals ==
The hypoglossal nerve is one of twelve cranial nerves found in amniotes including reptiles, mammals and birds. As with humans, damage to the nerve or nerve pathway will result in difficulties moving the tongue or lapping water, decreased tongue strength, and generally cause deviation away from the affected side initially, and then to the affected side as contractures develop. The evolutionary origins of the nerve have been explored through studies of the nerve in rodents and reptiles. The nerve is regarded as arising evolutionarily from nerves of the cervical spine, which has been incorporated into a separate nerve over the course of evolution.

The size of the hypoglossal nerve, as measured by the size of the hypoglossal canal, has been hypothesised to be associated with the progress of evolution of primates, with reasoning that larger nerves would be associated with improvements in speech associated with evolutionary changes. This hypothesis has been refuted.

<doc id="243334" wikidata="Q321237" url="?curid=243334" title="Green's theorem">
<text>In vector calculus, Green&#x27;s theorem relates a line integral around a simple closed curve to a double integral over the plane region (surface in formula_1) bounded by . It is the two-dimensional special case of Stokes&#x27; theorem (surface in formula_2). In one dimension, it is equivalent to the fundamental theorem of calculus. In three dimensions, it is equivalent to the divergence theorem.

==Theorem==
Let be a positively oriented, piecewise smooth, simple closed curve in a plane, and let be the region bounded by . If and are functions of defined on an open region containing and have continuous partial derivatives there, then

formula_3

where the path of integration along is counterclockwise.

==Application==

In physics, Green&#x27;s theorem finds many applications. One is solving two-dimensional flow integrals, stating that the sum of fluid outflowing from a volume is equal to the total outflow summed about an enclosing area. In plane geometry, and in particular, area surveying, Green&#x27;s theorem can be used to determine the area and centroid of plane figures solely by integrating over the perimeter.

==Proof when &quot;D&quot; is a simple region==
The following is a proof of half of the theorem for the simplified area &quot;D&quot;, a type I region where &quot;C&quot;1 and &quot;C&quot;3 are curves connected by vertical lines (possibly of zero length). A similar proof exists for the other half of the theorem when &quot;D&quot; is a type II region where &quot;C&quot;2 and &quot;C&quot;4 are curves connected by horizontal lines (again, possibly of zero length). Putting these two parts together, the theorem is thus proven for regions of type III (defined as regions which are both type I and type II). The general case can then be deduced from this special case by decomposing &quot;D&quot; into a set of type III regions.

If it can be shown that

and

are true, then Green&#x27;s theorem follows immediately for the region D. We can prove () easily for regions of type I, and () for regions of type II. Green&#x27;s theorem then follows for regions of type III.

Assume region &quot;D&quot; is a type I region and can thus be characterized, as pictured on the right, by
formula_4
where &quot;g&quot;1 and &quot;g&quot;2 are continuous functions on . Compute the double integral in ():

Now compute the line integral in (). &quot;C&quot; can be rewritten as the union of four curves: &quot;C&quot;1, &quot;C&quot;2, &quot;C&quot;3, &quot;C&quot;4.

With &quot;C&quot;1, use the parametric equations: &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;g&quot;1(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;a&quot; â¤ &quot;x&quot; â¤ &quot;b&quot;. Then
formula_5

With &quot;C&quot;3, use the parametric equations: &quot;x&quot; = &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; = &quot;g&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;), &quot;a&quot; â¤ &quot;x&quot; â¤ &quot;b&quot;. Then
formula_6

The integral over &quot;C&quot;3 is negated because it goes in the negative direction from &quot;b&quot; to &quot;a&quot;, as &quot;C&quot; is oriented positively (anticlockwise). On &quot;C&quot;2 and &quot;C&quot;4, &quot;x&quot; remains constant, meaning
formula_7

Therefore,

Combining () with (), we get () for regions of type I. A similar treatment yields () for regions of type II. Putting the two together, we get the result for regions of type III.

== Proof for rectifiable Jordan curves ==
We are going to prove the following

We need the following lemmas whose proofs can be found in:


Now we are in position to prove the theorem:

Proof of Theorem. Let formula_8 be an arbitrary positive real number. By continuity of formula_9, formula_10 and compactness of formula_11, given formula_12, there exists formula_13 such that whenever two points of formula_11 are less than formula_15 apart, their images under formula_16 are less than formula_8 apart. For this formula_18, consider the decomposition given by the previous Lemma. We have
formula_19

Put formula_20.

For each formula_21, the curve formula_22 is a positively oriented square, for which Green&#x27;s formula holds. Hence
formula_23

Every point of a border region is at a distance no greater than formula_15 from formula_25. Thus, if formula_26 is the union of all border regions, then formula_27; hence formula_28, by Lemma 2. Notice that
formula_29
This yields
formula_30

We may as well choose formula_18 so that the RHS of the last inequality is formula_32

The remark in the beginning of this proof implies that the oscillations of formula_9 and formula_10 on every border region is at most formula_8. We have
formula_36

By Lemma 1(iii),
formula_37

Combining these, we finally get
formula_38
for some formula_39. Since this is true for every formula_40, we are done.

== Validity under different hypotheses ==
The hypothesis of the last theorem are not the only ones under which Green&#x27;s formula is true. Another common set of conditions is the following:

The functions formula_41 are still assumed to be continuous. However, we now require them to be FrÃ©chet-differentiable at every point of formula_42. This implies the existence of all directional derivatives, in particular formula_43, where, as usual, formula_44 is the canonical ordered basis of formula_1. In addition, we require the function formula_46 to be Riemann-integrable over formula_42.

As a corollary of this, we get the Cauchy Integral Theorem for rectifiable Jordan curves:

== Multiply-connected regions ==
Theorem. Let formula_48 be positively oriented rectifiable Jordan curves in formula_49 satisfying
formula_50
where formula_51 is the inner region of formula_22. Let
formula_53

Suppose formula_54 and formula_55 are continuous functions whose restriction to formula_56 is FrÃ©chet-differentiable. If the function
formula_57
is Riemann-integrable over formula_56, then
formula_59

==Relationship to Stokes&#x27; theorem==
Green&#x27;s theorem is a special case of the KelvinâStokes theorem, when applied to a region in the formula_60-plane.

We can augment the two-dimensional field into a three-dimensional field with a &quot;z&quot; component that is always 0. Write F for the vector-valued function formula_61. Start with the left side of Green&#x27;s theorem:
formula_62

The KelvinâStokes theorem:
formula_63

The surface formula_64 is just the region in the plane formula_56, with the unit normal formula_66 defined (by convention) to have a positive z component in order to match the &quot;positive orientation&quot; definitions for both theorems.

The expression inside the integral becomes
formula_67

Thus we get the right side of Green&#x27;s theorem
formula_68

Green&#x27;s theorem is also a straightforward result of the general Stokes&#x27; theorem using differential forms and exterior derivatives:
formula_69

==Relationship to the divergence theorem==
Considering only two-dimensional vector fields, Green&#x27;s theorem is equivalent to the two-dimensional version of the divergence theorem:

:formula_70

where formula_71 is the divergence on the two-dimensional vector field formula_72, and formula_66 is the outward-pointing unit normal vector on the boundary.

To see this, consider the unit normal formula_66 in the right side of the equation. Since in Green&#x27;s theorem formula_75 is a vector pointing tangential along the curve, and the curve &quot;C&quot; is the positively oriented (i.e. anticlockwise) curve along the boundary, an outward normal would be a vector which points 90Â° to the right of this; one choice would be formula_76. The length of this vector is formula_77 So formula_78

Start with the left side of Green&#x27;s theorem:
formula_79
Applying the two-dimensional divergence theorem with formula_80, we get the right side of Green&#x27;s theorem:
formula_81

==Area calculation==
Green&#x27;s theorem can be used to compute area by line integral. The area of a planar region formula_56 is given by
formula_83

Choose formula_84 and formula_85 such that formula_86, the area is given by
formula_87

Possible formulas for the area of formula_56 include
formula_89

== History ==
It is named after George Green, who stated a similar result in an 1828 paper titled &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;. In 1846, Augustin-Louis Cauchy published a paper stating Green&#x27;s theorem as the penultimate sentence. This is in fact the first printed version of Green&#x27;s theorem in the form appearing in modern textbooks. George Green, &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot; (Nottingham, England: T. Wheelhouse, 1828). Green did not actually derive the form of &quot;Green&#x27;s theorem&quot; which appears in this article; rather, he derived a form of the &quot;divergence theorem&quot;, which appears on pages 10â12 of his &quot;Essay&quot;.
In 1846, the form of &quot;Green&#x27;s theorem&quot; which appears in this article was first published, without proof, in an article by Augustin Cauchy: A. Cauchy (1846) &quot;Sur les intÃ©grales qui s&#x27;Ã©tendent Ã  tous les points d&#x27;une courbe fermÃ©e&quot; (On integrals that extend over all of the points of a closed curve), &quot;Comptes rendus&quot;, 23: 251â255. (The equation appears at the bottom of page 254, where (&quot;S&quot;) denotes the line integral of a function &quot;k&quot; along the curve &quot;s&quot; that encloses the area &quot;S&quot;.)
A proof of the theorem was finally provided in 1851 by Bernhard Riemann in his inaugural dissertation: Bernhard Riemann (1851) &quot;Grundlagen fÃ¼r eine allgemeine Theorie der Functionen einer verÃ¤nderlichen complexen GrÃ¶sse&quot; (Basis for a general theory of functions of a variable complex quantity), (GÃ¶ttingen, (Germany): Adalbert Rente, 1867); see pages 8â9.

<text>George Green (14 July 1793 â 31 May 1841) was a British mathematical physicist who wrote &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot; in 1828. The essay introduced several important concepts, among them a theorem similar to the modern Green&#x27;s theorem, the idea of potential functions as currently used in physics, and the concept of what are now called Green&#x27;s functions. Green was the first person to create a mathematical theory of electricity and magnetism and his theory formed the foundation for the work of other scientists such as James Clerk Maxwell, William Thomson, and others. His work on potential theory ran parallel to that of Carl Friedrich Gauss.

Green&#x27;s life story is remarkable in that he was almost entirely self-taught. He received only about one year of formal schooling as a child, between the ages of 8 and 9.

== Early life ==

Green was born and lived for most of his life in the English town of Sneinton, Nottinghamshire, now part of the city of Nottingham. His father, also named George, was a baker who had built and owned a brick windmill used to grind grain.

In his youth, Green was described as having a frail constitution and a dislike for doing work in his father&#x27;s bakery. He had no choice in the matter, however, and as was common for the time he likely began working daily to earn his living at the age of five.

=== Robert Goodacre&#x27;s Academy ===
During this era it was common for only 25â50% of children in Nottingham to receive any schooling. The majority of schools were Sunday schools, run by the Church, and children would typically attend for one or two years only.
Recognizing the young Green&#x27;s above average intellect, and being in a strong financial situation due to his successful bakery, his father enrolled him in March 1801 at Robert Goodacre&#x27;s Academy in Upper Parliament Street. Robert Goodacre was a well-known science populariser and educator of the time. He published &quot;Essay on the Education of Youth&quot;, in which he wrote that he did not &quot;study the interest of the boy but the embryo Man&quot;. To a non-specialist, he would have seemed deeply knowledgeable in science and mathematics, but a close inspection of his essay and curriculum revealed that the extent of his mathematical teachings was limited to algebra, trigonometry and logarithms. Thus, Green&#x27;s later mathematical contributions, which exhibited knowledge of very modern developments in mathematics, could not have resulted from his tenure at the Robert Goodacre Academy. He stayed for only four terms (one school year), and it was speculated by his contemporaries that he had exhausted all they had to teach him.

=== Move from Nottingham to Sneinton ===
In 1773 George&#x27;s father moved to Nottingham, which at the time had a reputation for being a pleasant town with open spaces and wide roads. By 1831, however, the population had increased nearly five times, in part due to the budding Industrial Revolution, and the city became known as one of the worst slums in England. There were frequent riots by starving workers, often associated with special hostility towards bakers and millers on the suspicion that they were hiding grain to drive up food prices.

For these reasons, in 1807, George Green senior bought a plot of land in Sneinton. On this plot of land he built a &quot;brick wind corn mill&quot;, now referred to as Green&#x27;s Windmill. It was technologically impressive for its time, but required nearly twenty-four-hour maintenance, which was to become Green&#x27;s burden for the next twenty years.

== Adult life ==

=== Miller ===
Just as with baking, Green found the responsibilities of operating the mill annoying and tedious. Grain from the fields was arriving continuously at the mill&#x27;s doorstep, and the sails of the windmill had to be constantly adjusted to the windspeed, both to prevent damage in high winds, and to maximise rotational speed in low winds. The millstones that would continuously grind against each other, could wear down or cause a fire if they ran out of grain to grind. Every month the stones, which weighed over a ton, would have to be replaced or repaired.

=== Family life ===
In 1823 Green formed a relationship with Jane Smith, the daughter of William Smith, hired by Green Senior as mill manager. Although Green and Jane Smith never married, Jane eventually became known as Jane Green and the couple had seven children together; all but the first had Green as a baptismal name. The youngest child was born 13 months before Green&#x27;s death. Green provided for his (so-called) common-law wife and children in his will.

=== Nottingham Subscription Library ===
When Green was thirty, he became a member of the Nottingham Subscription Library. This library exists today, and was likely the main source of Green&#x27;s advanced mathematical knowledge. Unlike more conventional libraries, the subscription library was exclusive to a hundred or so subscribers, and the first on the list of subscribers was the Duke of Newcastle. This library catered to requests for specialised books and journals that satisfied the particular interests of their subscribers.

=== 1828 essay ===
In 1828, Green published &quot;An Essay on the Application of Mathematical Analysis to the Theories of Electricity and Magnetism&quot;, which is the essay he is most famous for today. It was published privately at the author&#x27;s expense, because he thought it would be presumptuous for a person like himself, with no formal education in mathematics, to submit the paper to an established journal. When Green published his &quot;Essay&quot;, it was sold on a subscription basis to 51 people, most of whom were friends who probably could not understand it.

The wealthy landowner and mathematician Sir Edward Bromhead bought a copy and encouraged Green to do further work in mathematics. Not believing the offer was sincere, Green did not contact Bromhead for two years.

== Mathematician ==
By the time Green&#x27;s father died in 1829, the senior Green had become one of the gentry due to his considerable accumulated wealth and land owned, roughly half of which he left to his son and the other half to his daughter. The young Green, now thirty-six years old, consequently was able to use this wealth to abandon his miller duties and pursue mathematical studies.

=== Cambridge ===
Members of the Nottingham Subscription Library who knew Green repeatedly insisted that he obtain a proper University education. In particular, one of the library&#x27;s most prestigious subscribers was Sir Edward Bromhead, with whom Green shared many correspondences; he insisted that Green go to Cambridge.

In 1832, aged nearly forty, Green was admitted as an undergraduate at Gonville and Caius College, Cambridge. He was particularly insecure about his lack of knowledge of Greek and Latin, which were prerequisites, but it turned out not to be as hard for him to learn these as he had envisaged, as the degree of mastery required was not as high as he had expected. In the mathematics examinations, he won the first-year mathematical prize. He graduated with a BA in 1838 as a 4th Wrangler (the 4th highest scoring student in his graduating class, coming after James Joseph Sylvester who scored 2nd).

=== College fellow ===
Following his graduation, Green was elected a fellow of the Cambridge Philosophical Society. Even without his stellar academic standing, the Society had already read and made note of his Essay and three other publications, so Green was welcomed.

The next two years provided an unparalleled opportunity for Green to read, write, and discuss his scientific ideas. In this short time he published an additional six publications with applications to hydrodynamics, sound, and optics.

== Final years and posthumous fame ==
In his final years at Cambridge, Green became rather ill, and in 1840 he returned to Sneinton, only to die a year later. There are rumours that at Cambridge, Green had &quot;succumbed to alcohol&quot;, and some of his earlier supporters, such as Sir Edward Bromhead, tried to distance themselves from him.


Green&#x27;s work was not well known in the mathematical community during his lifetime. Besides Green himself, the first mathematician to quote his 1828 work was the Briton Robert Murphy (1806â1843) in his 1833 work. In 1845, four years after Green&#x27;s death, Green&#x27;s work was rediscovered by the young William Thomson (then aged 21), later known as Lord Kelvin, who popularised it for future mathematicians. According to the book &quot;George Green&quot; by D.M. Cannell, William Thomson noticed Murphy&#x27;s citation of Green&#x27;s 1828 essay but found it difficult to locate Green&#x27;s 1828 work; he finally got some copies of Green&#x27;s 1828 work from William Hopkins in 1845.

In 1871 N. M. Ferrers assembled &quot;The Mathematical Papers of the late George Green&quot; for publication.

Green&#x27;s work on the motion of waves in a canal (resulting in what is known as Green&#x27;s law) anticipates the WKB approximation of quantum mechanics, while his research on light-waves and the properties of the Aether produced what is now known as the Cauchy-Green tensor. Green&#x27;s theorem and functions were important tools in classical mechanics, and were revised by Schwinger&#x27;s 1948 work on electrodynamics that led to his 1965 Nobel prize (shared with Feynman and Tomonaga). Green&#x27;s functions later also proved useful in analysing superconductivity. On a visit to Nottingham in 1930, Albert Einstein commented that Green had been 20 years ahead of his time. The theoretical physicist Julian Schwinger, who used Green&#x27;s functions in his ground-breaking works, published a tribute entitled &quot;The Greening of Quantum Field Theory: George and I&quot; in 1993.

The George Green Library at the University of Nottingham is named after him, and houses the majority of the university&#x27;s science and engineering Collection. &quot;The George Green Institute for Electromagnetics Research&quot;, a research group in the University of Nottingham engineering department, is also named after him. In 1986, Green&#x27;s Mill, Sneinton in Nottingham was restored to working order. It now serves both as a working example of a 19th-century windmill and as a museum and science centre dedicated to Green.

Westminster Abbey has a memorial stone for Green in the nave adjoining the graves of Sir Isaac Newton and Lord Kelvin.

His work and influence on 19th-century applied physics had been largely forgotten until the publication of his biography by Mary Cannell in 1993.

== Source of knowledge ==
Recent historical research suggests that the pivotal figure in Green&#x27;s mathematical education was John Toplis (c1774-1857), who graduated in mathematics from Cambridge as 11th Wrangler before becoming headmaster of the forerunner of Nottingham High School 1806â1819, and lived in the same neighbourhood as Green and his family. Toplis was an advocate of the continental school of mathematics, and fluent in French, having translated Laplace&#x27;s celebrated work on celestial mechanics. 
The possibility that Toplis played a role in Green&#x27;s mathematical education would resolve several long-standing questions about the sources of Green&#x27;s mathematical knowledge. For example, Green made use of &quot;the Mathematical Analysis&quot;, a form of calculus derived from Leibniz which was virtually unheard of, or even actively discouraged, in England at the time (due to Leibniz being a contemporary of Newton, who had his own methods that were championed in England). This form of calculus, and the developments of mathematicians such as the French mathematicians Laplace, Lacroix and Poisson, were not taught even at Cambridge, let alone Nottingham, and yet Green not only had heard of these developments, but improved upon them.

<text>The Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library () is the rare book library and literary archive of the Yale University Library in New Haven, Connecticut. It is one of the largest buildings in the world dedicated to rare books and manuscripts and is one of the largest collections of such texts. Established by a gift of the Beinecke family and given its own financial endowment, the library is financially independent from the university and is co-governed by the University Library and Yale Corporation.

Situated on Yale University&#x27;s Hewitt Quadrangle, the building was designed by Gordon Bunshaft of Skidmore, Owings &amp; Merrill and completed in 1963. From 2015 to 2016 the library building was closed for 18 months for major renovations, which included replacing the building&#x27;s HVAC system and expanding teaching and exhibition capabilities.

==Architecture==
The Beinecke Library is an International Style building. Its six-story above-ground glass-enclosed tower of book stacks is encased by a windowless faÃ§ade, supported by four monolithic piers at the corners of the building. The exterior shell is structurally supported by a steel frame with pylons embedded to bedrock at each corner pier, and the faÃ§ade is constructed of translucent veined marble and granite. The marble was quarried from Danby, Vermont, and milled to a thickness of in order to allow filtered daylight to permeate the interior in a subtle golden amber glow. Gordon Bunshaft attributed the inspiration for this effect to &quot;what I thought was onyx in a Renaissance-type palace in Istanbul,&quot; referring to the alabaster used in the DolmabahÃ§e Palace hammam. 

These panels are framed by a hexagonal grid of Vermont Woodbury granite veneer, fastened to a structural steel frame. The outside dimensions have Platonic mathematical proportions of 1:2:3 (height: width: length). The building has been called a &quot;jewel box&quot;, &quot;treasure casket&quot; (by Bunshaft himself), and a &quot;laboratory for the humanities&quot;. It contains furniture designed by Florence Knoll and Marcel Breuer.

An elevated public exhibition mezzanine surrounds the glass stack tower, and displays among other things, one of the 48 extant copies of the Gutenberg Bible. Two basement floors extend under much of Hewitt Quadrangle. The first sub-grade level, the &quot;Court&quot; level, centers on a sunken courtyard in front of the Beinecke, which features &quot;The Garden (Pyramid, Sun, and Cube)&quot;. These are abstract allegorical sculptures by Isamu Noguchi that are said to represent time (the pyramid), sun (the disc), and chance (the cube). This level also features a secure reading room for visiting researchers, administrative offices, and book storage areas. The level of the building two floors below ground has movable-aisle high-density shelving for books and archives.

The Beinecke is one of the larger buildings in America devoted entirely to rare books and manuscripts. The library has room in the central tower for 180,000 volumes and room for over 1 million volumes in the underground book stacks. The library&#x27;s collection, which is housed both in the library&#x27;s main building and at Yale University&#x27;s Library Shelving Facility in Hamden, Connecticut, totals roughly 1 million volumes and several million manuscripts.

During the 1960s, the Claes Oldenburg sculpture &quot;Lipstick (Ascending) on Caterpillar Tracks&quot; was displayed in Hewitt Quadrangle. The sculpture has since been moved to the courtyard of Morse College, one of the university&#x27;s residential dormitories.

The design of the Beinecke Library later inspired the glass-walled structure that protects and displays the original core collection (the books given by King George III and referred to as the King&#x27;s Library) within the British Library building in Euston, London.

==History==

In the late 19th century, rare and valuable books of the Library of Yale College were placed on special shelving at the College Library, now known as Dwight Hall. When the university received a multimillion-dollar bequest from John W. Sterling for the construction of Sterling Memorial Library in 1918, the university decided to create a dedicated reading room for its rare books, which became the building&#x27;s Rare Book Room when the building opened in 1930. Because the bequest did not contain an allowance for books or materials, Yale English professor Chauncey Brewster Tinker petitioned Yale alumni to donate materials that would give the university a collection as monumental as its new building. By the time Sterling opened, Tinker&#x27;s appeal garnered an impressive collection of rare books, including a Gutenberg Bible from Anna M. Harkness and several major collections from the Beinecke family, most notably its collection on the American West.

By 1958, the library owned more than 130,000 rare volumes and many more manuscripts. The amassed collection proved too large for Sterling&#x27;s reading room, and the reading room unsuited to their preservation. Having already given significant collections to Yale, Edwin and Frederick W. Beineckeâas well as Johanna Weigle, widow of their brother Walterâgave funds to build a dedicated rare books library building. When the Beinecke Library opened on October 14, 1963, it became the home of the volumes from Rare Book Room, and three special collections: the Collection of American Literature, the Collection of Western Americana, and the Collection of German Literature. Shortly afterward, they were joined by the James Marshall and Marie-Louise Osborn Collection.

Beinecke Library became the repository for books in the Yale collection printed anywhere before 1800, books printed in Latin America before 1751, books printed in North America before 1821, newspapers and broadsides printed in the United States before 1851, European tracts and pamphlets printed before 1801, and Slavic, East European, Near and Middle Eastern books through the eighteenth century, as well as special books outside these categories.

Now, the collection spans through to the present day, including such modern works as limited-edition poetry and artists&#x27; books. The library also contains thousands of linear feet of archival material, ranging from ancient papyri and medieval manuscripts to the archived personal papers of modern writers.

==Special collections==
The library is open to all Yale University students and faculty, and to visiting researchers whose work requires use of its special collections. In order to access materials, there are a few forms and policies that users must read.

The Beinecke Library also hold several hundred items from special collections institution Pequot Library. The collection consists largely of correspondence and documents from the colonial, revolutionary, Federal, and antebellum periods, extending well into the postbellum era.

==Exhibitions==

In addition to items on permanent display such as the Gutenberg Bible, the Beinecke offers a year-round program of temporary exhibits drawn from its collections. For example, in 2006 the library presented &quot;Breaking the Binding: Printing and the Third Dimension&quot;, a show of flap books, pop-ups, perspective books, panoramas, and peep-shows in printed form. Display cases are located on the mezzanine level and at the ground floor entry level, and may be freely viewed by the general public whenever the library is open.

The Library celebrated its 50th anniversary in 2013. There were two full-year exhibitions that explored the library&#x27;s architecture and people as well as a series of showcases of rarely seen manuscripts, printed works, and visual objects from across all curatorial areas.

==Security==
The Beinecke collection does not circulate; all materials are to be consulted in the reading room. The library hosts almost 10,000 research visits annually, almost half of which are with scholars having no formal affiliation to Yale University.

Security measures were significantly increased after the well-known antiques dealer Edward Forbes Smiley III was caught cutting maps from rare books with an X-acto blade in 2005. Smiley&#x27;s scheme was discovered when he dropped his concealed tool in the reading room, and he subsequently served several years in prison for thefts of rare documents valued in millions of dollars from the Beinecke and other libraries. The library operates under a closed stack system, and rigorous security rules now allow carefully controlled access to materials under video surveillance.

The glass-enclosed central stacks (not accessible to the public) can be flooded with a mix of Halon 1301 and Inergen fire suppressant gas if fire detectors are triggered. A previous system using carbon dioxide was removed for personnel safety reasons.

After an infestation of the death watch beetle was discovered in 1977, the Beinecke Library helped pioneer the non-toxic method of controlling paper-eating pests by freezing books and documents at for three days. All new acquisitions are given this treatment as a precaution, and the deep freeze method is now widely accepted for pest control in special collections libraries.

==In popular culture==
* In &quot;Uncommon Carriers,&quot; John McPhee admires a restaurant&#x27;s display of &quot;a glass tower of recumbent wines that may have been an architectural reference to the glass column of visible books in the Beinecke Library at Yale&quot;.
* In &quot;The Once and Future Spy&quot; by Robert Littell, an assassination attempt is made on a CIA analyst at the Beinecke Library.
* In &quot;The Ninth House&quot;, the Beinecke Library is made a site for cult practice by Manuscript Society.

<doc id="243349" wikidata="Q849484" url="?curid=243349" title="RayleighâJeans law">
<text>In physics, the RayleighâJeans law is an approximation to the spectral radiance of electromagnetic radiation as a function of wavelength from a black body at a given temperature through classical arguments. For wavelength &quot;Î»&quot;, it is
formula_1
where formula_2 is the spectral radiance (the power emitted per unit emitting area, per steradian, per unit wavelength), formula_3 is the speed of light, formula_4 is the Boltzmann constant, and formula_5 is the temperature in kelvins. For frequency formula_6, the expression is instead
formula_7

The RayleighâJeans law agrees with experimental results at large wavelengths (low frequencies) but strongly disagrees at short wavelengths (high frequencies). This inconsistency between observations and the predictions of classical physics is commonly known as the ultraviolet catastrophe. Planck&#x27;s law, which gives the correct radiation at all frequencies, has the RayleighâJeans law as its low-frequency limit.

== Historical development ==

In 1900, the British physicist Lord Rayleigh derived the &quot;Î»&quot;â4 dependence of the RayleighâJeans law based on classical physical arguments, relying upon the equipartition theorem. This law predicted an energy output that diverges towards infinity as wavelength approaches zero (as frequency tends to infinity). Measurements of the spectral emission of actual black bodies revealed that the emission agreed with Rayleigh&#x27;s calculation at low frequencies but diverged at high frequencies, reaching a maximum and then falling with frequency, so the total energy emitted is finite. Rayleigh recognized the unphysical behavior of his formula at high frequencies and introduced an &quot;ad hoc&quot; cutoff to correct it, but experimentalists found that his cutoff did not agree with data. Hendrik Lorentz also presented a derivation of the wavelength dependence in 1903. More complete derivations, which included the proportionality constant, were presented in 1905 by Rayleigh and Sir James Jeans and independently by Albert Einstein. Rayleigh believed that this discrepancy could be resolved by the equipartition theorem failing to be valid for high-frequency vibrations, while Jeans argued that the underlying cause was matter and luminiferous aether not being in thermal equilibrium.

Rayleigh published his first derivation of the frequency dependence in June 1900. Planck discovered the curve now known as Planck&#x27;s law in October of that year and presented it in December. Planck&#x27;s original intent was to find a satisfactory derivation of Wien&#x27;s expression for the blackbody radiation curve, which accurately described the data at high frequencies. Planck found Wien&#x27;s original derivation inadequate and devised his own. Then, after learning that the most recent experimental results disagreed with his predictions for low frequencies, Planck revised his calculation, obtaining what is now called Planck&#x27;s law.

== Comparison to Planck&#x27;s law ==

In 1900 Max Planck empirically obtained an expression for black-body radiation expressed in terms of wavelength (Planck&#x27;s law):
formula_8
where &quot;h&quot; is the Planck constant, and is the Boltzmann constant. Planck&#x27;s law does not suffer from an ultraviolet catastrophe and agrees well with the experimental data, but its full significance (which ultimately led to quantum theory) was only appreciated several years later. Since
formula_9
then in the limit of high temperatures or long wavelengths, the term in the exponential becomes small, and the exponential is well approximated with the Taylor polynomial&#x27;s first-order term:
formula_10

So
formula_11

This results in Planck&#x27;s blackbody formula reducing to
formula_12
which is identical to the classically derived RayleighâJeans expression.

The same argument can be applied to the blackbody radiation expressed in terms of frequency . In the limit of small frequencies, that is formula_13,
formula_14

This last expression is the RayleighâJeans law in the limit of small frequencies.

== Consistency of frequency- and wavelength-dependent expressions ==

When comparing the frequency- and wavelength-dependent expressions of the RayleighâJeans law, it is important to remember that
formula_15
and
formula_16
Note that these two expressions then have different units, as a step formula_17 in wavelength is not equivalent to a step formula_18 in frequency. Therefore, 
formula_19
even after substituting the value formula_20, because formula_21 has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, &quot;per unit wavelength&quot;, whereas formula_22 has units of energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, &quot;per unit frequency&quot;. To be consistent, we must use the equality
formula_23
where both sides now have units of power (energy emitted per unit time) per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle.

Starting with the RayleighâJeans law in terms of wavelength, we get
formula_24
where
formula_25
This leads to
formula_26

== Other forms of RayleighâJeans law ==

Depending on the application, the Planck function can be expressed in 3 different forms. The first involves energy emitted per unit time per unit area of emitting surface, per unit solid angle, per spectral unit. In this form, the Planck function and associated RayleighâJeans limits are given by
formula_27
or
formula_28

Alternatively, Planck&#x27;s law can be written as an expression formula_29 for emitted power integrated over all solid angles. In this form, the Planck function and associated RayleighâJeans limits are given by
formula_30
or
formula_31

In other cases, Planck&#x27;s law is written as
formula_32
for energy per unit volume (energy density). In this form, the Planck function and associated RayleighâJeans limits are given by
formula_33
or
formula_34

<doc id="243351" wikidata="Q2896028" url="?curid=243351" title="Benjamin Chew">
<text>Benjamin Chew (November 19, 1722 â January 20, 1810) was an American lawyer and judge who served as the chief justice of the Supreme Court of the Province of Pennsylvania and later the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania. Born into a Quaker family, Chew was known for precision and brevity in his legal arguments and his excellent memory, judgment, and knowledge of statutory law. His primary allegiance was to the supremacy of law and the constitution.

Trained in law at an early age by Andrew Hamilton, Chew inherited his mentor&#x27;s clients, the descendants of William Penn, including Thomas Penn and his brother Richard Penn Sr., and their sons, Governor John Penn, Richard Penn Jr., and John Penn. The Penn family was the basis of his private practice, and he represented them for six decades. He was also a slave owner.

Chew had a lifelong personal friendship with George Washington, who is said to have treated Chew&#x27;s children &quot;as if they were his own.&quot; Chew lived and practiced law in Center City Philadelphia, four blocks from the Pennsylvania State House, later renamed Independence Hall, and provided &quot;pro bono&quot; legal counsel on substantive law to America&#x27;s Founding Fathers during their creation of the United States Constitution and Bill of Rights.

==Early life and education==

Chew was born the son of Samuel Chew, a physician and first Chief Justice of Delaware Colony, and Mary Galloway Chew. He was born in Anne Arundel County, Maryland, at his father&#x27;s plantation, Maidstone. Benjamin Chew&#x27;s great-great-grandfather, John Chew (1587â1668), a successful merchant, arrived in Jamestown in 1622 on the ship &quot;Charitie&quot;; he was granted of land in York County, Virginia. 

The young Chew took an interest in the field of law at an early age. In 1736, when he was 15 years old, he began to read law in the Philadelphia offices of the former Attorney General of Pennsylvania Andrew Hamilton, who was then the speaker of the Pennsylvania House of Representatives. The year before, Hamilton won a landmark case in American jurisprudence by his eloquent &quot;pro bono&quot; defense of publisher Peter Zenger. It established the precedent of truth as an absolute defense against charges of libel.

Chew was strongly influenced by Hamilton&#x27;s ideas about a free press, and also the reading materials that Hamilton provided him, especially Sir Francis Bacon&#x27;s &quot;Lawtracts.&quot; His understanding of English legal history, and especially the Charter of Liberties, enhanced by his later studies at London&#x27;s Middle Temple, fostered Chew&#x27;s enduring commitment to the civil liberties that are guaranteed in the U.S. Constitution&#x27;s First Amendment, especially the right to free speech.

After Hamilton&#x27;s death in August 1741, Chew sailed to London to study law at the Honourable Society of the Middle Temple, one of four Inns of Court. He began attending London theatre and read what friends recommended; his journal during these years shows his process of adopting aspects of English refinement expected of gentlemen, which he continued after his return to the American colonies. Following his father&#x27;s death, Chew returned to Pennsylvania in 1744, and began practicing law in Dover, Delaware, while supporting his siblings and stepmother.

Chew was raised in a Quaker family, but he broke with Quaker tradition in 1741, when he agreed with his father, who had instructed a grand jury in New Castle, Delaware on the lawfulness of resistance to an armed force. In 1747, at age 25, Chew also went against Quaker tradition when he took the Oath of Attorney in Pennsylvania.

==Career==
===Philadelphia attorney===

In 1754, Chew moved to Philadelphia, where he continued his legal responsibilities in both Delaware Colony and the Province of Pennsylvania for the rest of his life. After early appointments in the Quaker-dominated government following his second marriage, he entered private practice in 1757; the following year joined the Anglican Church, and began a path to influence outside the Quaker elite.

Mentored by Andrew Hamilton from an early age, Chew was highly effective in defending civil liberties and settling boundary disputes; he represented William Penn&#x27;s descendants and their proprietorships as the largest landholders in the Province of Pennsylvania, for over 60 years. 

In 1757, Chew entered private practice. He derived most of his income from that, managing his second wife&#x27;s considerable estate, and collecting quit-rents from his various properties. Chew continued the family practice of investing in land in the Thirteen Colonies until the end of his life, expanding their holdings in the colonial-era Province of Pennsylvania, Province of Maryland, Delaware Colony, and Province of New Jersey.

In his early career, Chew often met with other ambitious young Philadelphia men at the London Coffee House. In 1766, they organized the Gloucester Fox Hunting Club, the first in the United States. This adoption of an English sport was part of their becoming gentlemen; they committed to hunting together in the country a couple of times a week.

Chew was Speaker of the Lower House for the Delaware counties (1753â1758); Attorney General and member of the Council of Pennsylvania (1754â1769); Recorder of Philadelphia City (1755â1774); Master of Rolls (1755â1774; analogous to the Master of the Rolls role in England and Wales); and Provincial Councillor of Pennsylvania (1755).

In 1757, he also was elected a trustee of the Academy and College of Philadelphia, which later became the University of Pennsylvania, and continued as such until 1791. He also taught numerous law students. Foremost among Benjamin Chew&#x27;s law students were Brigade Major Edward Tilghman and Judge William Tilghman. &quot;These Tilghmans were so successful in the law that they were both offered the post of State Chief Justice in 1805.&quot;

He was selected as a Philadelphia commissioner (1761); appointed as Register-General of Wills (1765â1777); and as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania (1774â1777). During the American Revolutionary War, the Executive Council governing the new state removed him from office in 1777 and kept him in preventive detention in New Jersey until after the British forces left the Philadelphia region.

After the Revolutionary War, Chew resumed a position of influence in the new society and, eventually, its government. He was appointed a judge and president of the Pennsylvania High Court of Errors and Appeals (1791â1808), the court of last resort in the Commonwealth.

===MasonâDixon line===

By the time he was 29 years old, Chew held a number of offices, both elected and appointed, in the Delaware and Pennsylvanian colonial governments. Appointed as Secretary of the Boundary Commission in 1750, Chew successfully represented the Penn family for the following eighteen years in their boundary dispute with first Charles Calvert, 5th Baron Baltimore and then Frederick Calvert, 6th Baron Baltimore of Maryland. The dispute was finally resolved in 1768, when the Boundary Commission oversaw the development and completion of the MasonâDixon line between Pennsylvania and Maryland.

===Albany Conference===

On June 19, 1754, the Albany Congress was held in Albany, New York. Twenty-one representatives of New York, Pennsylvania, Maryland, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and New Hampshire attended the Congress. Secretaries of each colony represented also attended, including Benjamin Chew of the Pennsylvania delegation. These secretaries helped formulate the plan to unite the colonies as a unified force at the time of threat from France during the Seven Years&#x27; War, known in North America as the French and Indian War, which began that year. The Albany Plan of Union was one of the first attempts to unite the British colonies. Benjamin Franklin proposed the plan but, as it greatly exceeded the scope of the congress, it was strongly debated by attendees. Six months later, Chew, aged 32, was appointed as Attorney General of the colony of Pennsylvania.

===Easton Conference===
In October 1758, The Easton Conference was held in Easton, Pennsylvania, to resolve conflicts created by The Walking Purchase of 1737, which had lasting effects on the relationships between Native Americans and the colonists. As Attorney General of Pennsylvania, Chew attended the negotiations for the Treaty of Easton and documented the proceedings in his &quot;Journal of a Journey to Easton.&quot; The conference concluded on October 26, and in November, Governor Denny announced to the Pennsylvania Assembly that &quot;a general peace was secured at Easton.&quot;

===Attorney General===
&quot;From 1755 to 1769 Chew served as Attorney General of Pennsylvania and as the Recorder of Philadelphia, earning a reputation that was second to none.&quot; In a letter warning the Crown against enacting the Stamp Act, Attorney General Benjamin Chew described the mood in America: &quot;â¦it is impossible to say to what length their irritated and turbulent Spirits may carry them.&quot; The Stamp Act was repealed two months later.

In 1768, Chew was elected to the revived American Philosophical Society.

===Supreme Court Chief Justice===
&quot;Chew&#x27;s political views were at all times close to those of his predecessor, William Allen. He supported the Proprietary interests, opposed the Stamp Act and other English abuses, but opposed independence.&quot; &quot;The Chew court...was without a question the most professional and formally trained high court to date.&quot; &quot;Chew&#x27;s pro-American views and actions were not enough to save him, but he was not persecuted in the way that some pacifists were, as his record of speaking out against British abuses was well known. It was not until the following year that his liberty was restricted&quot; by the Executive Council of

When he was finally paroled and sent to New Jersey for preventive detention as a suspected Loyalist, &quot;Chew refused to take the action of the Council seriously at first, and thoroughly intimidated the young soldiers from the City Troop who were sent to pick him up. Eventually realizing his predicament he signed a parole...although he insisted that there was no charge against him except that he had held office under the Proprietor.&quot;

===President of the High Court===
After the state and national governments had been formed, in 1791, Chew was appointed by Thomas Mifflin, Pennsylvania&#x27;s first Governor and the former President of the Continental Congress, to preside as the President over Pennsylvania&#x27;s first High Court of Errors and Appeals. He held the position until he retired in 1808.
Pennsylvania at first made no provision for any appeal from its Supreme Court, but in February 1780 legislation established the Pennsylvania High Court of Errors and Appeals. It was empowered to hear appeals from the Supreme Court and also from the Court of Admiralty and the Register&#x27;s Courts. Chew received the highest compliment Pennsylvania could pay him: he was appointed by Governor Thomas Mifflin as President of the High Court, despite the fact that he was by then close to seventy.

==Political influence==

Prior to the American Revolution, Chew was friends with both George Washington and John Adams, and was a strong advocate for the colonies. As a lifelong pacifist, however, Chew believed that protest and reform were necessary to resolve the ongoing American conflicts with the British Parliament. Having been born and reared as a Quaker, he did not support active revolution. He maintained that position although he had left the Quakers and joined the Anglican Church in 1758. Early in the conflict, both the British and colonial sides claimed his allegiance since Chew had such a visible position in the colony and played so many important roles.

Chew was undecided about the correct course to take. &quot;I have stated that an opposition of force of arms to the lawful authority of the king or his ministriesâ¦is &quot;high treason&quot;, but in the moment when the king or his ministries shall exceed the constitutional authority vested in them â¦ submission to their mandates becomes &quot;treason&quot;.&quot; -Benjamin Chew, Chief Justice of Pennsylvania, in an address to the last provincial grand jury, April 10, 1776

On August 4, 1777, when General Howe and the British army were nearing Philadelphia, the Executive Council of the new government &quot;issued a warrant for (Chew&#x27;s) arrest on grounds of protecting the public safety. When the warrant was served two days later at his home in Philadelphia, Chew demanded to know &#x27;by what authority and for what cause&#x27; he was charged.&quot; &quot;As a lawyer, [Chew] believed that the warrant infringed on his rights as a free man; moreover, it violated the first principle of justice by prejudging him unheard. This, as he later recorded in notes concerning his arrest, &#x27;struck at the liberties of everyone in the community and [he believed] it was his duty to oppose it and check it, if possible, in its infancy.&#x27;&quot;

The Executive Council of the Continental Congress decided at the last minute against allowing Chew to remain at Cliveden. For his own safety, they decided to allow both Chew and the Governor John Penn to be paroled at his wife Elizabeth Chew&#x27;s house, &quot;Solitude,&quot; at the Union Forge Ironworks in High Bridge, New Jersey. Six months later, after the British forces left the region, both men returned to Philadelphia on May 15, 1778.

After the Revolution, Benjamin Chew&#x27;s broad social circles continued to include representatives of many faiths, as well as friends and politicians with many disparate points of view. Chew continued to participate in the meetings of the Tammany Society, to honor Tamanend, the Lenni-Lenape chief who first negotiated peace agreements with William Penn. &quot;Although Benjamin Chew was not a participant in the Constitutional Convention of 1787...he and his family were part of the city&#x27;s new social circle that included the Washingtons, the John Adams, the William Binghams, and the Robert Morrises...In large measure this was because Chew&#x27;s legal perspicacity offered expertise needed by the new government.&quot;

==Residences==
===Third Street House===
In 1771, Chew purchased the former house of his client, Governor John Penn, on South Third Street in Philadelphia; Penn returned to England to settle his father Richard Penn Sr.&#x27;s estate. For almost five decades, the household on Third Street was filled by Benjamin and Elizabeth Chew, their son Benjamin, and their daughters Anna Marie, Elizabeth, Sarah, Margaret (Peggy), Juliana, Henrietta, Sophia, Maria, Harriet, and Catherine, all of whom were actively engaged in the social, civic, and cultural life of the nation&#x27;s first capital. Three of the daughters retained ownership of the house until 1828.

The Chews entertained many visiting dignitaries, such as John Penn, Tench Francis Jr., Robert, Thomas, and Samuel Wharton, Thomas Willing, John Cadwalader, Chief Justice William Allen and his wife Margaret, daughter of Andrew Hamilton, Dr. William Smith, Provost of the College of Philadelphia, botanist John Bartram, Edward Shippen III, Edward Shippen IV, and Peggy Shippen, Thomas Mifflin, later to become Governor of Pennsylvania, and Brigadier General Henry Bouquet, hero of the French and Indian War.

Abigail Adams referred to Chews&#x27; daughters as part of a &quot;constellation of beauties&quot; in Philadelphia. Margaret Chew (1760â1824) married Maryland Governor John Eager Howard in 1787. Sophia (1769â1841) was invited to attend Martha Washington&#x27;s first public event in Philadelphia. Harriet (1775â1861) was asked to entertain George Washington while his portrait was being painted. In 1800, she married the only son of Charles Carroll of Carrollton, signer of the Declaration of Independence, who built Homewood for them as a wedding gift. Throughout the Revolutionary War, George Washington aided the transfer of letters between Mr. and Mrs. Chew, during months when they were forced to live apart.

The Chew family&#x27;s house on Third Street was situated between Spruce and Walnut Streets, next to the house of Samuel Powel, mayor of Philadelphia, and his wife, Elizabeth Willing Powel, who was one of George Washington&#x27;s closest confidantes. &quot;Led by Mrs. Washington, Mrs. Morris, and &#x27;the dazzling Mrs. Bingham,&#x27; as Abigail Adams called her, the city embarked on a lavish program of public and private entertainment patterned on English and French models.&quot; Mrs. Adams reports being pleasantly surprised by &quot;an agreeable society and friendliness kept up with all the principal families, who appear to live in great harmony, and we are met at all the parties [with] nearly the same company.&quot; After the death of their parents, Henrietta, Maria, and Catherine Chew vacated their house on South Third Street, and moved to a family-owned property on Walnut Street. In 1828, they sold the house on South Third Street, and in 1830, the building was razed.

===Cliveden===

To protect his family from the diseases that plagued Philadelphia, Chew chose Mennonite master builder, Jacob Knor, to build a summer retreat in Germantown, which he called Cliveden; the house later came to be known as the Chew house. Knor went on to construct several other buildings in Germantown, including the nearby Johnson House in 1768.

On August 4, 1777, when the Executive Committee of the Continental Congress decided to place Chew in preventive detention in New Jersey, his wife and children vacated Cliveden and returned to their Third Street home. With Cliveden vacant, General Howe, the British Commander-in-Chief, quickly seized the house. Protected by its strong walls, he won the Battle of Germantown on October 4.

After Chew was released from parole in May 1778, he decided to move his family to Whitehall, their estate in Delaware, to buffer them from the political turbulence of Philadelphia. Chew sold Cliveden to Blair McClenahan because he was unable to afford the extensive repairs necessary after the Battle of Germantown. While in Delaware, the Chews rented their house on Third Street to Don Juan de Miralles (the Spanish representative to the American government); the Marquis de Chastellux (principal liaison officer between the French Commander-in-Chief and George Washington); and to George and Martha Washington, from November 1781 to March 1782, during the Second Continental Congress.

By 1783, the Chews concluded that the political situation was safe enough for their family to return to Philadelphia. They lived full-time in the house on South Third Street during the formation of the United States: the Constitutional Convention; the Congress of the Confederation; and in 1792, the official adoption of the Bill of Rights by the First United States Congress.

In 1797, Chew bought back Cliveden. It remained under family ownership for another five generations. Cannonballs from the Battle of Germantown were embedded in its walls until 1972, when Chew&#x27;s descendants donated the house to the National Trust for Historic Preservation. During restoration, most of the cannonballs were removed.

==Personal life==

Chew wed Mary Galloway, his first cousin, on June 13, 1747, at West River, Maryland. They had five daughters before Mary died. From 1754 to 1771, Chew and his family lived on Front Street in Philadelphia. 
He married again on September 12, 1757, to Elizabeth Oswald (1732â1819), daughter of James and Mary (Turner) Oswald. Elizabeth was the niece and heir to the estate of Captain Joseph Turner.

Benjamin and Elizabeth had seven more daughters, including Margaret &quot;Peggy&quot;, and two sons.

In 1758, Chew left the Quakers permanently and joined the Church of England; he and his wife had their son Benjamin baptized that year at Christ Church. They worshipped there with their growing family, and later at St. Peter&#x27;s Church when they moved out to Germantown. This was part of a process of Anglicization that had begun when he was studying law at the Middle Temple in London.

Chew greatly increased both his wealth and property holdings when he married Elizabeth Oswald. They held numerous slaves to care for the properties and cultivate their commodity crops. In 1760, on the Chew&#x27;s property &quot;Whitehall&quot; in Delaware, Richard Allen, was born into slavery. In 1768, recognizing the boy&#x27;s early genius, Chew sold Allen, then eight years old, and all members of his immediate family to Stokley Sturgis, a known abolitionist and owner of a neighboring property in Delaware. Richard Allen later became a preacher in the Methodist Church in Philadelphia, co-founder of the Free African Society, and the founder and first bishop of the African Methodist Episcopal Church, the first African American denomination in the United States.

==Death==
After an extended illness, Chew died at Cliveden on January 13 or 20, 1810. He is buried at St. Peter&#x27;s Churchyard in Philadelphia.

<text>Germantown () is an area in Northwest Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Founded by Palatine, Quaker, and Mennonite families in 1683 as an independent borough, it was absorbed into Philadelphia in 1854. The area, which is about six miles northwest from the city center, now consists of two neighborhoods: &#x27;Germantown&#x27; and &#x27;East Germantown&#x27;.

Germantown has played a significant role in American history; it was the birthplace of the American antislavery movement, the site of a Revolutionary War battle, the temporary residence of George Washington, the location of the first bank of the United States, and the residence of many notable politicians, scholars, artists, and social activists.

Today, the area remains rich in historic sites and buildings from the colonial era, some of which are open to the public.

==Boundaries==

Germantown stretches for about two miles along Germantown Avenue northwest from Windrim and Roberts Avenues. Germantown has been consistently bounded on the southwest by Wissahickon Avenue, on the southeast by Roberts Avenue, and on the east by Wister Street and Stenton Avenue, but its northwest border has expanded and contracted over the years. When first incorporated as a borough in 1689, Germantown was separated from the rural Germantown Township by Washington Lane; later, the border was expanded to Carpenter and East Gorgas Lanes; it was then rolled back to Washington Lane in 1846, and remained there until the borough was absorbed into the city of Philadelphia in 1854.
Today, the western part of the former borough is the neighborhood known simply as &#x27;Germantown&#x27; (though is sometimes called &#x27;West Germantown&#x27;) and the eastern part is the neighborhood of &#x27;East Germantown&#x27;. While the boundary between the two neighborhoods is not well-defined and has varied over time, these days &#x27;Germantown&#x27; usually refers to the part of the former borough that lies west of Germantown Avenue, up through West Johnson Street, and &#x27;East Germantown&#x27; to the part that lies east of Germantown Avenue, up through East Upsal Street.

The neighborhood of Mount Airy lies to the northwest, Ogontz and West Oak Lane to the northeast, Logan to the east, NicetownâTioga to the south, and East Falls to the southwest.
The majority of Germantown is covered by the 19144 zip code, but the area north of Chew Avenue falls in the 19138 zip code.

==History and demographics==


Although the arrival by ship of the Original 13, the later founders of Germantown in Philadelphia on October 6, 1683, was later to provide the date for German-American Day, a holiday in the United States, historical research has shown that nearly all of the first thirteen Quaker and Mennonite families were in fact Dutch rather than Germans. These families, which were mainly Dutch but also included some Swiss, had relocated to Krefeld (near the Dutch border) and Kriegsheim (in Rhineland-Palatinate) some years prior to their emigration to America to avoid persecution of their Mennonite beliefs in the Dutch Republic and Swiss Confederacy. The town was named Germantown by the group&#x27;s leader Franz Pastorius, a German preacher from Sommerhausen. The town&#x27;s population remained largely Dutch-speaking until 1709, after which a number of the Dutch families set out west and a series of major German emigrations reached Germantown and Pennsylvania as a whole. Their initial leader, Pastorius, later aligned himself with newer German arrivals and as the only university-trained and legal and literary man among the early settlers, chronicled and stressed the town&#x27;s German origins. Adding to the assimilating of Dutch culture was the fact that the direct vicinity of the settlement was already inhabited by fifty-four German families who had accompanied Johan Printz to the Swedish settlement on the Delaware several years before 1683 and had resettled themselves. Pastorius was the first bailiff. Jacob Telner, Derick Isacks op den Graeff and his brother Abraham Isacks op den Graeff, Reynier Tyson, and Tennis Coender (Thones Kunders) were burgesses, besides six committeemen. They had authority to hold &quot;the general court of the corporation of Germantowne&quot;, to make laws for the government of the settlement, and to hold a court of record. This court went into operation in 1690, and continued its services for sixteen years.

In 1688, five years after its founding, Germantown became the birthplace of the anti-slavery movement in America. Pastorius, Gerret Hendericks and the brothers Derick and Abraham op den Graeff gathered at Thones Kunders&#x27;s house and wrote a two-page condemnation of slavery and sent it to the governing bodies of their Quaker church, the Society of Friends. The petition was mainly based upon the Bible&#x27;s Golden Rule, &quot;Do unto others as you would have them do unto you.&quot; Though the Quaker establishment took no immediate action, the 1688 Germantown Quaker Petition Against Slavery was a clear and forceful argument against slavery and initiated the process of banning slavery in the Society of Friends (1776) and Pennsylvania (1780).

In 1723, Germantown became the site of the first congregation of Schwarzenau Brethren in the New World. The Church of the Brethren - among other churches - have their roots in the Schwarzenau Brethren.

When Philadelphia was occupied by the British during the American Revolutionary War, British units were housed in Germantown. In the Battle of Germantown, on October 4, 1777, the Continental Army attacked the garrison. During the battle, a group of civilians fired on the British troops as they marched up the avenue, mortally wounding British officer James Agnew. The Americans withdrew after firing on one another in the confusion of the battle, which resulted in the battle becoming a British victory. The American losses amounted to 673 men and the British losses consisted of 575 men, but along with the American victory at Saratoga on October 17 when John Burgoyne surrendered, the battle led to the official recognition of the Americans by France, which formed an alliance with the Americans afterward.

During his presidency, George Washington and his family lodged at the Deshler-Morris House in Germantown to escape the city and the yellow fever epidemic of 1793. The first bank of the United States was also located here during his administration.

Germantown proper, and the adjacent German Township, were incorporated into the City of Philadelphia in 1854 by the Act of Consolidation.

Italians began settling Germantown in 1880, and comprised an active and vibrant part of the community.

The significant changes that occurred in Philadelphia&#x27;s demographics at the start of the 20th century caused major shifts in Germantown&#x27;s ethnic makeup as well. When the first wave of the Great Migration brought more than 140,000 African Americans to the city from the South, long-established Philadelphians started to move to the outskirts. During this time, many German, Scots-Irish, and Irish families moved to Germantown.

During the 1940s, a second mass migration of African Americans from the south to Philadelphia occurred. While the majority of middle-class African American newcomers first settled in North Philadelphia, the housing shortages in this area that followed the end of World War II caused later arrivals to move instead to the Northwest. This led to a wave of new housing construction. To meet the housing needs of the growing numbers of African American families moving into southern Germantown, the Philadelphia Redevelopment Authority allocated $10.6 million for the creation of public housing.

Between 1954 and 1956, Germantown experienced an influx of lower-income African Americans, resulting in a decline in property values and triggering a &quot;white flight&quot; of the majority of white residents to the suburbs. The demographic shift caused a slow but steady decline in central Germantown&#x27;s upscale shopping district, with the last department store, a J. C. Penney branch, closing in the early 1980s.

The current demographics of Germantown reflects this shift. As of the 2010 US Census, Germantown proper is 77% black, 15% white, 3% non-white Hispanic, and 2% Asian, and East Germantown is 92% black, 3% white, 2% non-white Hispanic, and 2% Asian.

Eugene Stackhouse, a retired former president of the Germantown Historical Society says that the demographic transition of Germantown into a predominantly black neighborhood was the result of the now illegal practice of blockbusting. &quot;It was a great disgrace. Cheap houses would be sold to a black family, then the realtors would go around and tell the neighbors that the blacks are invading&quot;, said Stackhouse. The practice was used to trigger panic selling.

Nicknamed &quot;Old Ironsides&quot;, it eventually reached a peak speed of 28Â mph.

<doc id="243360" wikidata="Q797892" url="?curid=243360" title="Emmanuel College, Cambridge">
<text>Emmanuel College is a constituent college of the University of Cambridge. The college was founded in 1584 by Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer to Elizabeth I. The site on which the college sits was once a priory for Dominican monks, and the College Hall is built on the foundations of the monastery&#x27;s nave. Emmanuel is one of the 16 &quot;old colleges&quot;, which were founded before the 17th century.

Emmanuel today is one of the larger Cambridge colleges; it has around 500 undergraduates, reading almost every subject taught within the University, and around 200 postgraduates. Among Emmanuel&#x27;s notable alumni are Thomas Young, John Harvard, Graham Chapman and Sebastian Faulks. Three members of Emmanuel College have received Nobel Prizes: Ronald Norrish, George Porter (both Chemistry, 1967) and Frederick Hopkins (Medicine, 1929).

In every year from 1998 until 2016, Emmanuel was among the top five colleges in the Tompkins Table, which ranks colleges according to end-of-year examination results. Emmanuel topped the table five times (2003, 2004, 2006, 2007 and 2010) and placed second six times (2001, 2002, 2008, 2009, 2011 and 2012). Its mean score for 1997â2018 inclusive places it as the second-highest-ranking college after Trinity.

The college was founded in 1584 by Sir Walter Mildmay, Chancellor of the Exchequer to Elizabeth I. The site had been occupied by a Dominican friary until the Dissolution of the Monasteries 45 years earlier, after which the Vice-Chancellor petitioned that the place be given over to the University; his request was refused. After passing through several hands, the former monastery was purchased for Â£550 to be the site of the new college in June 1583 by Laurence Chaderton, the Master-elect, and his brother-in-law, Richard Culverwell, acting on behalf of Mildmay, to whom they conveyed the property on 23 November 1582. Mildmay&#x27;s foundation made use of the existing buildings. The architect was Ralph Symons, and in 1588 the new building was opened with a dedication festival, which Mildmay attended.

Mildmay, a Puritan, intended Emmanuel to be a centre for the training of Anglican preachers. According to Thomas Fuller, Mildmay, on coming to court after the college was opened, was addressed by the Queen with the words: &quot;Sir Walter, I hear you have erected a puritan foundation&quot;, to which Mildmay replied: &quot;No, madam; far be it from me to countenance anything contrary to your established laws; but I have set an acorn, which when it becomes an oak, God alone knows what will be the fruit thereof&quot;.

Like all the older Cambridge colleges, Emmanuel originally took only male students. It first admitted female students in 1979.

==Buildings and grounds==
Under Mildmay&#x27;s instructions the chapel of the original Dominican Friary was converted into the College&#x27;s dining hall and the friars&#x27; dining hall became a chapel. In the late 17th century the College commissioned a new chapel, one of the three buildings in Cambridge designed by Christopher Wren (1677). After Wren&#x27;s construction was opened the old chapel became the College library until it outgrew the space. The library moved to its present space in 1930, occupying a large building in South Court completed in 1911 and initially used as lecture rooms. The library was extended in 1974.

There is a large fish pond in the grounds, part of the legacy of the friary. The pond is home to a colony of ducks.

The Fellows&#x27; Garden contains a swimming pool that was the friars&#x27; bathing pool, making it one of the oldest bathing pools in Europe and allegedly the oldest outdoor pool in continuous use in the UK. The Garden also contains an Oriental plane tree that is reputed to have lived far longer than is typical for the species.

It has been claimed that the college has the only privately owned subway (underpass) in the UK, connecting the main site to North Court, but in fact Oriel College, Oxford, has its own tunnel beneath Oriel Street linking the Island Site with the main college buildings. The Bodleian Library in Oxford also has its own tunnel beneath Broad Street.

===Queen&#x27;s Building===
The Queen&#x27;s Building encompasses a 150-seat theatre, reception and seminar rooms, and facilities for music practice. The theatre inside the Queen&#x27;s Building is frequently utilized by the College for various purposes, such as lectures, Music Society concerts, admissions open day talks, and is a conference venue. Designed by the architects Sir Michael and Patty Hopkins, the Queen&#x27;s Building is constructed using Ketton stone. The architectural design combines the robustness of the stone exterior walls with the spanning capabilities and mass of concrete for the floors. The limestone exterior is load bearing, and is the first building to use post-tensioned stone with internal cables. The roof is adorned with lead, and American white oak is extensively incorporated into the roof and panelling. The building was inaugurated in 1995.

==Student life==

The Emmanuel College Students Union (ECSU) is the society of all undergraduate students at Emmanuel College. It provides a shop, a bar, a common room, and funding for sports and other societies. ECSU&#x27;s Executive Committee is elected at the end of Michaelmas Term each year. The ECSU committee is staffed by undergraduates and holds such positions as President, Welfare Officer, and Ents Officer amongst others.

The Emmanuel College Middle Combination Room (Emma MCR) is the society of all postgraduate students at Emmanuel College. The Room itself is a comfortable and well-equipped space in Furness Lodge. The MCR committee organises regular social events for graduate students, including well-attended formal dinners in hall every few weeks.

===Sports and societies===
There are numerous student societies and sports clubs at Emmanuel College. Sports clubs include tennis, badminton, cricket, squash, rugby, football, hockey and netball. Societies include the Emmanuel College Music Society (ECMS), the Christian Union, the Mountaineering Society, the Emmanuel Vegan Society, the Politics and Economics Society, ROAR (the college satirical newspaper), and the Emmanuel College Board Games Society. Funding for societies comes from the Emmanuel College Students Union (ECSU).

==People associated with Emmanuel==
===Former students===

Emmanuel graduates were prominently involved in the settling of British colonies in North America. Of the first 100 university graduates in New England, one third were graduates of Emmanuel. Harvard University, the first college in the United States, was organised on the model of Emmanuel as it was then run. Harvard is named for John Harvard (BA, 1632), an Emmanuel graduate. Emmanuel and Harvard maintain relations via student exchanges such as the Herchel Smith scholarships, the Harvard Scholarship, the Paul Williams Scholarship, and the Gomes lecture and dinner held each February at Emmanuel in honour of Peter Gomes, erstwhile minister at Harvard&#x27;s Memorial Church.

Early Emmanuel graduates included several translators of the 1611 Authorised Version of the Bible, for example Laurence Chaderton and William Branthwaite.

Fictional characters who have been said to have gone to Emmanuel include Jonathan Swift&#x27;s Lemuel Gulliver. It is implied that Sebastian Faulks&#x27;s eponymous Engleby and Thomas Richardson also matriculated at Emmanuel. The protagonist in Samuel Butler&#x27;s novel &quot;The Way of All Flesh&quot; also went to Emmanuel. The uncompleted Doctor Who serial &quot;Shada&quot; was partly filmed in the college, with the character Professor Chronotis having rooms in New Court.

<doc id="243361" wikidata="Q265617" url="?curid=243361" title="Trapezium (bone)">
<text>The trapezium bone (greater multangular bone) is a carpal bone in the hand. It forms the radial border of the carpal tunnel.

==Structure==
The trapezium is distinguished by a deep groove on its anterior surface. It is situated at the radial side of the carpus, between the scaphoid and the first metacarpal bone (the metacarpal bone of the thumb). It is homologous with the first distal carpal of reptiles and amphibians.

===Surfaces===
The trapezium is an irregular-shaped carpal bone found within the hand. The trapezium is found within the distal row of carpal bones, and is directly adjacent to the metacarpal bone of the thumb. On its ulnar surface are found the trapezoid and scaphoid bones.

The &quot;superior surface&quot; is directed upward and medialward; medially it is smooth, and articulates with the scaphoid; laterally it is rough and continuous with the lateral surface.

The &quot;inferior surface&quot; is oval, concave from side to side, convex from before backward, so as to form a saddle-shaped surface for articulation with the base of the first metacarpal bone. This saddle-shaped articulation is partially responsible for the thumb&#x27;s opposable motion.

The &quot;dorsal surface&quot; is smooth.

The &quot;palmar surface&quot; is narrow and rough. At its upper part is a deep groove, running from above obliquely downward and medialward; it transmits the tendon of the Flexor carpi radialis, and is bounded laterally by an oblique ridge. This surface gives origin to the Opponens pollicis and to the Abductor and Flexor pollicis brevis; it also affords attachment to the transverse carpal ligament.

The &quot;lateral surface&quot; is broad and rough, for the attachment of ligaments.

The &quot;medial surface&quot; presents two facets; the upper, large and concave, articulates with the trapezoid bone; the lower, small and oval, with the base of the second metacarpal.

===Tubercle of trapezium===
The tubercle of trapezium is a tubercle found on the anterior surface of the bone. It is where sometimes abductor pollicis brevis muscle attaches.

==Function==
The carpal bones function as a unit to provide a bony superstructure for the hand. The trapezium is the most radial of the bones surrounding the carpal tunnel. It is important in thumb movement.

==Clinical relevance==
The trapezium is susceptible to arthritis at the joint with the metacarpal bone of the thumb, due to overuse.

==History==
The etymology derives from the Greek &quot;trapezion&quot; which means &quot;a little table&quot;, from &quot;trapeza&quot; meaning &quot;table&quot;, itself from &quot;(te)tra-&quot; &quot;four&quot; and &quot;pod-&quot; &quot;foot&quot;. The name was first documented in 1840.

<doc id="243368" wikidata="Q486103" url="?curid=243368" title="Lara Flynn Boyle">
<text>Lara Flynn Boyle (born March 24, 1970) is an American actress. She is known for playing Donna Hayward in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990â1991). After appearing in Penelope Spheeris&#x27;s comedy &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot; (1992), Boyle had a lead role in John Dahl&#x27;s neo-noir film &quot;Red Rock West&quot; (1993), and in the psychological thriller &quot;The Temp&quot; (1993), followed by roles in &quot;Threesome&quot; (1994), &quot;Cafe Society&quot; (1995), &quot;Happiness&quot; (1998), and the villainous Serleena in &quot;Men in Black II&quot; (2002). From 1997 to 2003, she starred in the ABC series &quot;The Practice&quot;, for which she received a Primetime Emmy Award nomination.

==Early life==
Boyle was born in Davenport, Iowa, the daughter of Sally Flynn, a clerical worker, assistant, and manager, and Michael L. Boyle. Her paternal grandfather was U.S. Representative Charles A. Boyle. She has Irish, German, and Italian ancestry. She is named after a character in Boris Pasternak&#x27;s novel &quot;Doctor Zhivago&quot;. Her father left when she was six, causing her and her mother to move to smaller quarters. Around this time, she was diagnosed with dyslexia. She was raised in Chicago, Illinois, and Wisconsin, and graduated from The Chicago Academy for the Arts.

==Career==
 In 1986, Boyle landed a small part in John Hughes&#x27;s teen comedy film &quot;Ferris Bueller&#x27;s Day Off&quot;, which earned her a SAG card, though her scenes were deleted from the final cut of the film. Subsequently, Boyle had a supporting role as Jackie Bradford in the television miniseries &quot;Amerika&quot; (1987), followed by guest appearances on episodes of the series &quot;Jack and Mike&quot; (1987) and &quot;Sable&quot; (1987).

After a string of supporting roles, Boyle landed a lead role in the Gary Sherman horror film &quot;Poltergeist III&quot; (1988), which was distributed by the media company MGM. Although she was cast as Ginny Danburry in Peter Weir&#x27;s drama film &quot;Dead Poets Society&quot; (1989), her scenes were ultimately deleted from the final cut.

In 1989, Boyle rose to international prominence when David Lynch cast her as Donna Hayward in the television series &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; (1990â1991). The series focused on the murder of the high school Homecoming Queen Laura Palmer, with Boyle portraying Laura&#x27;s best friend. Her main storyline focused on her trying to solve the mystery of who killed Laura.

The series premiered April 8, 1990, on ABC and subsequently became one of the top-rated series of 1990, but a decline in ratings ultimately led to its cancellation after its second season in 1991. Boyle appeared in all 30 episodes.

When discussing Lynch&#x27;s direction, Boyle stated, &quot;I remember, in the pilot, I did a very long scene that we had to shoot 30 or 40 times. David came up to me and said quietly, in my ear: &#x27;Think of how gently a deer has to move in the snowâ¦&#x27; It was strange direction. But that&#x27;s what I thought of, and it worked. We were at the helm of a piece of heaven on Twin Peaks and we just went where David Lynch told us. That might sound very obscure but it really is true. How he sees the world is how we should all see the world.&quot;

In October 1990, while promoting &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Boyle was featured on the cover of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine along with her co-stars MÃ¤dchen Amick and Sherilyn Fenn. While starring on &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, Boyle portrayed Sarah in Clint Eastwood&#x27;s action film &quot;The Rookie&quot; (1990), Rosarita in Adam Rifkin&#x27;s satirical comedy film &quot;The Dark Backward&quot; (1991), Mara Motes in Michael Karbelnikoff&#x27;s crime film &quot;Mobsters&quot; (1991), and Sandra Gladstone in the romantic thriller &quot;Eye of the Storm&quot; (1991).

Boyle also appeared in the television films &quot;Terror on Highway 91&quot; (1989), &quot;The Preppie Murder&quot; (1989), as well as episodes of &quot;The Hidden Room&quot; and &quot;May Wine&quot;.

Shortly after the cancellation of &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;, plans were being made for a feature film adaptation. Boyle was asked by Lynch to reprise her role as Donna Hayward in the psychological horror film &quot;Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me&quot; (1992) but she was unable to commit to the project due to scheduling conflicts with her roles as Heather in Marc Rocco&#x27;s drama film &quot;Where the Day Takes You&quot; (alongside her &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; co-star Kyle MacLachlan), Stacy in Penelope Spheeris&#x27;s comedy &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, and Beverly Franks in Alan Rudolph&#x27;s crime drama &quot;Equinox&quot;. This led to her being replaced by actress Moira Kelly. In 1993, Boyle starred as Kris Bolin in the thriller film &quot;The Temp&quot; and portrayed the temptress Suzanne Brown in the neo-noir film &quot;Red Rock West&quot; alongside Nicolas Cage and Dennis Hopper.

In 1994, Boyle was cast as Alex in the comedy &quot;Threesome&quot;, Laraine Cotwell in &quot;Baby&#x27;s Day Out&quot;, and Ida Muntz in &quot;The Road to Wellville&quot;. The same year, Boyle appeared in the television films &quot;Past Tense&quot; and &quot;Jacob&quot;. In 1995, she was cast as Pat Ward in the mystery film &quot;Cafe Society&quot;. In 1997, she portrayed Marianne Byron in the film &quot;Afterglow&quot;. Boyle auditioned for the title role in David E. Kelley&#x27;s &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;. Although she lost out to Calista Flockhart, Boyle impressed Kelley enough to cast her the role of Assistant District Attorney Helen Gamble in his other 1997 series, &quot;The Practice&quot;. The following year, Boyle portrayed Helen Jordan in Todd Solondzâs controversial comedy-drama film &quot;Happiness&quot;.

She starred on &quot;The Practice&quot; until 2003, when, in a dramatic attempt to revamp the show and cut costs, she was dismissed along with most of the cast. For her performance as Helen Gamble, she received an Emmy nomination as well as several Screen Actors Guild ensemble cast nominations. Boyle also made a crossover appearance in the role of Helen Gamble in an episode of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, and an uncredited guest appearance on the same show in its final season.

In 2002, Boyle played a lead role in the blockbuster feature film &quot;Men in Black II&quot;, as the villainous shapeshifting alien Serleena. She also guest-starred on one of the last episodes of &quot;Ally McBeal&quot;, this time as Tally Cupp, and had a recurring role on several episodes of &quot;Huff&quot;.

In 2005, Boyle joined the cast of &quot;Las Vegas&quot; for a seven-episode stint as Monica Mancuso, a new hotel owner. She played Barbara Amiel in the television film &quot;Shades of Black&quot;, about Amiel and her husband, Lord Black. Boyle also guest-starred as an ambitious reporter involved with the suspects in a possible murder in the &quot;Law &amp; Order&quot; 2008 episode &quot;Submission&quot;.
In 2009, Boyle portrayed Mary in &quot;Baby on Board&quot;. The same year, Boyle was cast as Betty McBain in the independent film &quot;Life Is Hot in Cracktown&quot;. In 2010, she starred as Kathy in &quot;Cougar Hunting&quot;. In 2013, Boyle portrayed Witch Agnes in the horror comedy film &quot;Hansel &amp; Gretel Get Baked&quot;. In 2015, she portrayed Ms. Donley in the film &quot;Lucky Dog&quot;.

In 2020, after a five-year break, she returned to acting to star as Grace in the film &quot;Death in Texas&quot; alongside Stephen Lang.

==Personal life==
Boyle was in a relationship with &quot;Twin Peaks&quot; co-star Kyle MacLachlan from 1990 to 1992. Boyle has been married twice. Her first husband was John Patrick Dee III, whom she married on August 11, 1996, and divorced two years later. Boyle dated actor David Spade, and later dated Jack Nicholson after he asked Boyle out in front of Spade while they were smoking marijuana. Spade later found out they were together after Nicholson and Boyle were involved in a car crash, covered by paparazzi. They went public with their romance at the 1999 Emmys, and reportedly remained together until the end of 2000. Her second husband is Donald Ray Thomas II, a real estate investor, whom she married on December 18, 2006, in San Antonio, Texas.

<text>Archytas (; ; 435/410â360/350 BC) was an Ancient Greek mathematician, music theorist, statesman, and strategist from the ancient city of Taras (Tarentum) in Southern Italy. He was a scientist and philosopher affiliated with the Pythagorean school and famous for being the reputed founder of mathematical mechanics and a friend of Plato.

As a Pythagorean, Archytas believed that arithmetic (logistic), rather than geometry, provided the basis for satisfactory proofs, and developed the most famous argument for the infinity of the universe in antiquity.

==Life ==
Archytas was born in Tarentum, a Greek city in the Italian Peninsula that was part of Magna Graecia, and was the son of Hestiaeus. He was presumably taught by Philolaus, and taught mathematics to Eudoxus of Cnidus and to Eudoxus&#x27; student, Menaechmus.

Politically and militarily, Archytas appears to have been the dominant figure in Tarentum in his generation, somewhat comparable to Pericles in Athens a half-century earlier. The Tarentines elected him &quot;strategos&quot; (&quot;general&quot;) seven years in a row, a step that required them to violate their own rule against successive appointments. Archytas was allegedly undefeated as a general in Tarentine campaigns against their southern Italian neighbors.

In his public career, Archytas had a reputation for virtue as well as efficacy. The &quot;Seventh Letter&quot;, traditionally attributed to Plato, asserts that Archytas attempted to rescue Plato during his difficulties with Dionysius II of Syracuse. Some scholars have argued that Archytas may have served as one model for Plato&#x27;s philosopher king, and that he influenced Plato&#x27;s political philosophy as expressed in &quot;The Republic&quot; and other works.

==Works==
Archytas is said to be the first ancient Greek to have spoken of the sciences of arithmetic (logistic), geometry, astronomy, and harmonics as kin, which later became the medieval quadrivium. He is thought to have written a great number of works in the sciences, but only four fragments are generally believed to be authentic.

According to Eutocius, Archytas was the first to solve the problem of doubling the cube (the so-called &quot;Delian problem&quot;) with an ingenious geometric construction. Before this, Hippocrates of Chios had reduced this problem to the finding of two mean proportionals, equivalent to the extraction of cube roots. Archytas&#x27; demonstration uses lines generated by moving figures to construct the two proportionals between magnitudes and was, according to Diogenes LaÃ«rtius, the first in which mechanical motions entered geometry. The topic of proportions, which Archytas seems to have worked on extensively, is treated in Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Elements&quot;, where the construction for two proportional means can also be found.

Archytas named the harmonic mean, important much later in projective geometry and number theory, though he did not discover it. He proved that &quot;supernummerary ratios&quot; cannot be divided by a mean proportional â an important result in ancient harmonics. Ptolemy considered Archytas the most sophisticated Pythagorean music theorist, and scholars believe Archytas gave a mathematical account of the musical scales used by practicing musicians of his day.

Later tradition regarded Archytas as the founder of mathematical mechanics. Vitruvius includes him in a list of twelve authors who wrote works on mechanics. T.N. Winter presents evidence that the pseudo-Aristotelian &quot;Mechanical Problems&quot; might have been authored by Archytas and later mis-attributed to Aristotle. Tradition also has it that Archytas built a mechanical flying dove. The sole mention of this from antiquity comes some five centuries after Archytas, when Aulus Gellius discusses a report by his mentor Favorinus:

Aulus Gellius views the reporting of the tradition as problematic, since it spreads implausible beliefs even if accompanied by skepticism.

<text>Dale Jonathan Winton (22 May 1955 â 18 April 2018) was an English radio DJ and television presenter. He presented the shows &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; from 1993 until 2001 and again in 2007, the National Lottery game show &quot;In It to Win It&quot; between 2002 and 2016 and the 2008 series of &quot;Hole in the Wall&quot;. Winton also presented &quot;Pets Win Prizes&quot; (1995â96) and &quot;The Other Half&quot; (1997â2002).

==Early life==
Winton was born on 22 May 1955 to a Jewish father, Gary Winton, and actress Sheree Winton, a Jewish convert. Winton&#x27;s father died on the day of his bar mitzvah and so he was brought up by his mother. Winton&#x27;s mother died by suicide in 1976 while suffering from depression.

==Career==

===Radio===
Winton started DJing in clubs in Richmond in 1972, where he met Steve Allen, the LBC radio presenter. The two remained friends thereafter, and lived together for a period as well as going on holiday together. From there he had a selection of jobs including selling timeshares. In 1982, Winton moved to London and began his entertainment career on the London club circuit, where he DJ&#x27;d at weekends. This led him to the United Biscuits Radio Network where he did a variety of jobs working for Adrian Love, before getting his own morning show. From here he joined Radio Trent in Nottingham, where he presented a weekend show, moving to the weekday mid-morning show, before leaving in 1985, and going on to work at a number of other local radio stations including Chiltern Radio, Beacon Radio (in Wolverhampton, for 3 years) as well as Blue Danube Radio in Vienna, Austria.

In 2000, Winton took over from Alan Freeman to present &quot;Pick of the Pops&quot; on BBC Radio 2, and hosted the show until 30 October 2010, when Tony Blackburn replaced him. Winton sat in for Steve Wright and Liza Tarbuck on BBC Radio 2, covering the latter&#x27;s Saturday show in September 2013 and November/December 2016.

===Television===
Winton began his television career in 1986 on &quot;Pet Watch&quot;, before working for Channel 4, Lifestyle Channel and ITV. From 1993 to 2000, he hosted &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; during the daytime TV period on ITV. In 2007, &quot;Supermarket Sweep&quot; was revived after a -year absence. Winton portrayed himself as an irritating game show presenter in Danny Boyle&#x27;s 1996 film &quot;Trainspotting&quot;.

In 1995â96, Winton presented BBC&#x27;s Saturday night game show &quot;Pets Win Prizes&quot;. In 1997, he presented the final of &quot;The Great British Song Contest&quot;, the UK&#x27;s national selection for the Eurovision Song Contest, due to a tie-in with the lottery programme. Between that year and 2002, he also presented a dating show called &quot;The Other Half&quot;. In 1999, he appeared on the sitcom &quot;Gimme Gimme Gimme&quot; with Kathy Burke in the episode &quot;Do They Take Sugar?&quot;

In 2000 he presented &quot;Barbara Windsor â Hall Of Fame 2000 TV Special&quot;, the induction of Barbara Windsor as the first artist to be inducted into the newly created BBC Hall of Fame.

He was the subject of &quot;This Is Your Life&quot; in 2000 when he was surprised by Michael Aspel. In 2001, he presented Channel 5&#x27;s endurance show &quot;Touch the Truck&quot;. In 2002, Winton began presenting the National Lottery game show &quot;In It to Win It&quot;. In 2003, he appeared in the BBC Three mockumentary, &quot;Dale&#x27;s Wedding&quot;, in which he supposedly married the UK celebrity Nell McAndrew.

From 2003 to 2004, he hosted two series of &quot;Stars Reunited&quot; where the casts of popular British television series were reunited after many years. Between 2004 and 2006, he presented three series of the celebrity weight loss &quot;boot camp&quot; programme, &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; on ITV.

Winton presented BBC One&#x27;s Saturday night entertainment programme &quot;Hole In The Wall&quot; in 2008, based on the Japanese original, where contestants in skin-tight lycra costumes contorted themselves to fit through oddly-shaped holes in a moving wall. The show returned for a second series in 2009 but Anton Du Beke replaced Winton as host. Winton began appearing in television advertisements for cashmygold.co.uk in 2010. Winton appeared on Matt Lucas and David Walliams&#x27; BBC comedy series &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot;. He appeared in the last episode of the series, playing himself. In 2012, he hosted one-off ITV game show &quot;Dale&#x27;s Great Getaway&quot; and in February 2018, Winton hosted travelogue series &quot;Dale Winton&#x27;s Florida Fly Drive&quot; aired on Channel 5.

==Personal life==
In 2002, Winton released his autobiography in which he wrote about his rise to fame and his actress mother&#x27;s suicide, and came out as homosexual. In a 2016 op-ed for the Conservative Woman website, he revealed his interest in American politics, expressing his disappointment over Mitt Romney&#x27;s loss of the 2012 US presidential election. He described Donald Trump&#x27;s candidacy announcement for the 2016 US presidential election as &quot;car crash TV&quot;, but added that Trump was &quot;truly authentic&quot;.

== Death ==
On 18 April 2018, Jan Kennedy, Winton&#x27;s long-term agent, announced that he had died at his home. On 19 April, a spokesman for Scotland Yard said that police were treating the death as &quot;unexplained&quot;, but did not believe it to be suspicious. According to his friend Gloria Hunniford: &quot;Dale had a lot of things going wrong, he had pain with arthritis, he had a heart complaint, he had a chest infection, and we all know how the winter affected that. He had asthma as well.&quot; The coroner concluded that Winton died of natural causes. 

He had recently moved from a Â£2.9 million apartment in Regent&#x27;s Park to a property in Whetstone, North London. His friends celebrated his life with a non-religious humanist funeral ceremony by Humanists UK on 22 May 2018, his birthday. His eulogy was preserved as part of a public historical archive of humanist funerals.

<doc id="243373" wikidata="Q15376278" url="?curid=243373" title="Leidang">
<text>The institution known as leiÃ°angr (Old Norse), leidang (Norwegian), &quot;leding&quot; (Danish), &quot;ledung&quot; (Swedish), &quot;expeditio&quot; (Latin) or sometimes lething (English), was a form of conscription (mass levy) to organize coastal fleets for seasonal excursions and in defense of the realm typical for medieval Scandinavians and, later, a public levy of free farmers. In Anglo-Saxon England, a different system was used to achieve similar ends, and was known as the fyrd.

The first recorded instance of a Norse lething is disputed among scholars. There is considerable evidence that substantiates its existence in the late 12th century. However, there are also written sources and archeological evidence which indicate that the lething system was introduced as early as the tenth century, if not earlier.

==Origins==
The age of the lething is disputed among scholars. The Icelandic sagas link the introduction of the lething to King Haakon I (The Good) of Norway in the tenth century.

The first known lethings are found during the ninth and tenth centuries when Sea Kings could be elected. These rulers were given provisional authority over men who had to assemble for an allotted time to achieve certain limited and pre-agreed goals. The temporary kingships of early Viking society had no power of enforcement over their men as they exercised authority only by consent.

The &quot;leidangr&quot; of Norway is first mentioned in 985 AD by the Skaldic courtly poets of Jarl Haakon of Western Norway and his son Erik. In each poem, the princes are praised for summoning the ships of the &quot;leidangr&quot; to the Battle of HjÃ¶rungavÃ¡gr against a Danish fleet. The King of Norway, Harald Hardrada, is later praised by two court Skalds for summoning the &quot;leidangr&quot; to attack Denmark. Harald is also called &quot;king of the leidangr&quot; and the latter is termed &quot;almenningr&quot;, &quot;the duty and right of all men&quot;. During the 11th century Danish naval forces, though not termed &quot;leidangr&quot;, are sporadically praised as led by Danish kings (as Knut in his conquest of England). A Danish royal charter from 1085 stipulates that certain people on the lands of the canons of Lund are liable to pay fines for neglecting &quot;expeditio&quot;.

According to historian Niels Lund, there was no real leiÃ°angr in Denmark until 1170. Historian Sverre Bagge has disputed Lund&#x27;s interpretation, pointing to earlier references to a leiÃ°angr, saga mentions of leiÃ°angr, and archeological evidence that indicates the presence of considerable military mobilization.

Finland also had some form of ledung system after its conquest by Sweden. It was also used in Denmark as well as in Norway.

==Structure==
The &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; was a system organizing a coastal fleet with the aim of defence, coerced trade, plunderings, and aggressive wars. The leidangs were centered upon a ship. The organizational unit was the ship itself with the men providing their own equipment and provisions for the journey. The ship&#x27;s company agreed to serve for a certain period of time, normally, the fleet levy was on expeditions for two or three summer months. It was composed of free men who owned farms. The &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; differed from conventional feudalism in that the expeditions gathered around leaders based on military merit, rather than noble status.

All free men were obliged to take part in or contribute to the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot;. All of the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; were called to arms when invading forces threatened the land. Only a fraction of the ships called to the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; would take part in the expeditions, but as they were often profitable, many prominent magnates and chieftains would vy for the opportunity to join.

At its most basic level, the system relied on each hemman or farm supplying one-armed man. The leidang divided the land into districts, ship&#x27;s crews or ship communities, &quot;skipreiÃ°a&quot; (Old Norse), &quot;skipÃ¦n&quot; (Danish), &quot;skeppslag&quot; or &quot;roslag&quot; and also &quot;hundaland&quot; (Swedish, mainly east coast), &quot;skipreide&quot; or &quot;skibrede&quot; (modern Norwegian, this division/system is applied mainly to Norway and western Sweden, which in turn adhered under Norwegian rule at the time), and required every skipreide to deliver one ship and crew. These skipreide were administrative areas in which residents were assigned to outfit a ship for military use. They were collectively responsible to build, maintain, equip and staff a leidangsskip (coastal defense ship), fully provisioned for two or three months. Skipreide were mainly on the coast, but also extended quite far inland along fjords and deep waterways (âas far inland as the salmon runsâ), to safeguard the procurement of timber for building of the warships. In the 1200s, each Skipreide consisted of 40 lid, and each lid of 4 farms/hemman; meaning that it took about 160 hemman to supply a ship and a crew. If enemy forces attacked the country, fires (signal beacons) built on high hills would mobilize the farmers to the skipreide. The number of farms in an area determined the size of a skipreide. It did not usually include the entire parish, nor was it confined to a parish; it could include farms from several parishes.

The farmers of each district had to build and equip a rowed sailing ship. The size of the ships was defined as a standardized number of oars, initially 40 oars, later 24 oars. In Norway, there were 279 such districts in 1277, in Denmark two-three times as many. The head of a district was called &quot;styrimaÃ°r&quot; or &quot;styrÃ¦smand&quot;, steersman, and he functioned as captain of the ship. The smallest unit was the crew of peasants who had to arm and provide for one oarsman (&quot;hafnÃ¦&quot; in Danish, &quot;hamna&quot; in Swedish, &quot;manngerÃ°&quot; in Old Norse).

In Sweden a &quot;hamna&quot; was made up of two &quot;attung&quot;, which was &quot;two eighth parts of a village&quot;. One attung seems to have been equal to the land area it took to feed an ordinary family (around 12 acres, see Hide (unit), Virgate and Oxgang for English equivalents). Each attung also regard as having a &quot;share&quot; in the raid, so one who owned two attung had twice as much chance to go on the raid as one who owned only one. Those who owned less than an attung had to team up with others to form a unit of one attung and share the burdens as well as the profit.

According to the Law of Uppland, the hundreds of Uppland, all in all 22 hundreds (Tiundaland; providing 10 hundreds, Attundaland; providing 8 hundreds and FjÃ¤rdhundaland; providing 4 hundreds) each of which providing four ships (four ships, each with 24 crewmen and a steersman, each equals 100 men). Also, those of VÃ¤stmanland two ships and those of Roslagen one ship (the name indicate that this was seen as just one ship&#x27;s crew but they were not part of a hundred and might have had the same rights/function of whole hundred only fewer people).

The older laws regulating the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; (the Norwegian &quot;Older Law of the Gulating&quot; dates to the 11th or 12th century) require every man to, as a minimum, arm himself with an axe or a sword in addition to spear and shield, and for every rowbench (typically of two men) to have a bow and 24 arrows. Later 12th-13th century changes to this law code list more extensive equipment for the more affluent freemen, with helmet, mail hauberk, shield, spear and sword being what the well-to-do farmer or burgher must bring to war.

In 12th-13th-century sources detailing the 11th century, jarls are mentioned as the chieftain of the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot;. In the 12th century, a bishop could also be head of the fleet levy, although typically nobles led levies in the 12th to 14th centuries.

== During the Baltic Crusades ==
According to historical register, majority of early Baltic Crusaders in the 12th century were well-armed. During the 13th and 14th, mounted troops were raised from amongst the aristocracies of the crusading nations, but foot soldiers formed the core of armies raised by the ledung system. Each &quot;hundare&quot; district should have been able to muster up 100 men and four ships and formed a part of a larger region called Svealand, the core of the Swedish Kingdom and able to muster as 2200 warriors. The vessel, called &quot;snÃ¤cka&quot;, was a technological descendant of the Viking age warship. Ledung allows organizing an army to campaign outside its territory, useful for Baltic crusading.

==Equipment==
During the Early Medieval Period, the majority of the leidang would have been unarmored. Some of the wealthier men may have worn gambesons and spangenhelms, while the wealthiest might wear mail. As the Viking Age began, the leidang slowly began to improve in terms of armor as their areas became richer. By the ninth century, most members of a Leidang would have had helmets either of the spangenhelm or Nasal Helm design. Drengrs would have worn mail, while wealthier freemen may have worn padded cloth/gambesons. Spears were common to all men, and many would have had short hand axes. Nobles and wealthy freemen would have had swords. Shields were used by all, and were usually round and of wood and leather construction, sometimes with leather or iron binding around the rim. By the 12th century, helmets and padded gambesons were very common, the Kettle hat type of helmet now being used alongside the earlier Nasal Helm and Spangenhelm types. Padded armour and mail were also more common among ordinary men.

==Evolution==
In parts of the Scandinavian countries, the &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; evolved to a tax in the 12th century to 13th century, paid by all (free) farmers until the 19th century, although the ship-levy was frequently called out and used in the 13thâ15th centuries, with the Norwegian &quot;leiÃ°angr&quot; fleet going as far as Scotland in the 1260s. The use of the levy-tax as opposed to the use of maritime forces was more prevalent in Denmark and Sweden than Norway, since the Norwegian kingdom always depended heavily on fleet-based forces rather than land-based ones.

Skipreide, originally a defense system, later assumed other powers, such as to legal authority to pass laws and financial authority to levy taxes. Towards the end of the 13th century, they only existed for these purposes. In about 1660, skipreide were converted into tinglags, court districts that included a bygdeting (community court) or a byting (city court).

==England==
In Anglo-Saxon times, defences were based on the &quot;fyrd&quot;. It was a militia called up from the districts threatened with attack. Service in the fyrd was usually of short duration and participants were expected to provide their own arms and provisions. The origins of the &quot;fyrd&quot; can be traced back to at least the seventh century, and it is likely that the obligation of Englishmen to serve in the fyrd dates from before its earliest appearance in written records.

Alfred the Great is credited with the development of the &quot;fyrd&quot; system together with the building of &quot;burhs&quot;, the development of a cavalry force, and the building of a fleet. Each element of the system was meant to remedy defects in the West Saxon military establishment exposed by the Viking invasions. If, under the existing system, he could not assemble forces quickly enough to intercept mobile Viking raiders, the obvious answer was to have a standing field force. If this entailed transforming the West Saxon fyrd from a sporadic levy of king&#x27;s men and their retinues into a mounted standing army, so be it. If his kingdom lacked strongpoints to impede the progress of an enemy army, he would build them. If the enemy struck from the sea, he would counter them with his own naval power. Characteristically, all of Alfred&#x27;s innovations were firmly rooted in traditional West Saxon practice, drawing as they did on the three so-called âcommon burdens&#x27; of bridge work, fortress repair and service on the king&#x27;s campaigns that all holders of bookland and royal loanland owed the Crown. Where Alfred revealed his genius was in designing the field force and burhs to be parts of a coherent military system. Neither Alfred&#x27;s reformed fyrd nor his burhs alone would have afforded a sufficient defence against the Vikings; together, however, they robbed the Vikings of their major strategic advantages: surprise and mobility.

The &quot;fyrd&quot; was used heavily by King Harold in 1066, for example in resisting invasion by Harald Hardrada and William of Normandy.

The historian David Sturdy has cautioned about regarding the &quot;fyrd&quot; as a precursor to a modern national army composed of all ranks of society, describing it as a &quot;ridiculous fantasy&quot;:The persistent old belief that peasants and small farmers gathered to form a national army or &quot;fyrd&quot; is a strange delusion dreamt up by antiquarians in the late eighteenth or early nineteenth centuries to justify universal military conscription.

Henry I of England, the Anglo-Norman king who promised at his coronation to restore the laws of Edward the Confessor and who married a Scottish princess with West Saxon royal forebears, called up the &quot;fyrd&quot; to supplement his feudal levies, as an army of all England, as Orderic Vitalis reports, to counter the abortive invasions of his brother Robert Curthose, both in the summer of 1101 and in autumn 1102.

<text>In finance, a forward contract, or simply a forward, is a non-standardized contract between two parties to buy or sell an asset at a specified future time at a price agreed on in the contract, making it a type of derivative instrument. The party agreeing to buy the underlying asset in the future assumes a long position, and the party agreeing to sell the asset in the future assumes a short position. The price agreed upon is called the &quot;delivery price&quot;, which is equal to the forward price at the time the contract is entered into.

The price of the underlying instrument, in whatever form, is paid before control of the instrument changes. This is one of the many forms of buy/sell orders where the time and date of trade is not the same as the value date where the securities themselves are exchanged. Forwards, like other derivative securities, can be used to hedge risk (typically currency or exchange rate risk), as a means of speculation, or to allow a party to take advantage of a quality of the underlying instrument which is time-sensitive.

==Payoffs==
The value of a forward position &quot;at maturity&quot; depends on the relationship between the delivery price (formula_1) and the underlying price (formula_2) at that time.
* For a long position this payoff is: formula_3
* For a short position, it is: formula_4
Since the final value (at maturity) of a forward position depends on the spot price which will then be prevailing, this contract can be viewed, from a purely financial point of view, as &quot;a bet on the future spot price&quot;


==How a forward contract works==
Suppose that Bob wants to buy a house a year from now. At the same time, suppose that Alice currently owns a house that she wishes to sell a year from now. Both parties could enter into a forward contract with each other. Suppose that they both agree on the sale price in one year&#x27;s time of (more below on why the sale price should be this amount). Alice and Bob have entered into a forward contract. Bob, because he is buying the underlying, is said to have entered a long forward contract. Conversely, Alice will have the short forward contract.

At the end of one year, suppose that the current market valuation of Alice&#x27;s house is . Then, because Alice is obliged to sell to Bob for only , Bob will make a profit of . To see why this is so, one needs only to recognize that Bob can buy from Alice for and immediately sell to the market for . Bob has made the difference in profit. In contrast, Alice has made a potential loss of , and an actual profit of .

The similar situation works among currency forwards, in which one party opens a forward contract to buy or sell a currency (e.g. a contract to buy Canadian dollars) to expire/settle at a future date, as they do not wish to be exposed to exchange rate/currency risk over a period of time. As the exchange rate between U.S. dollars and Canadian dollars fluctuates between the trade date and the earlier of the date at which the contract is closed or the expiration date, one party gains and the counterparty loses as one currency strengthens against the other. Sometimes, the buy forward is opened because the investor will actually need Canadian dollars at a future date such as to pay a debt owed that is denominated in Canadian dollars. Other times, the party opening a forward does so, not because they need Canadian dollars nor because they are hedging currency risk, but because they are speculating on the currency, expecting the exchange rate to move favorably to generate a gain on closing the contract.

In a currency forward, the notional amounts of currencies are specified (ex: a contract to buy million Canadian dollars equivalent to, say at the current rateâthese two amounts are called the notional amount(s)). While the notional amount or reference amount may be a large number, the cost or margin requirement to command or open such a contract is considerably less than that amount, which refers to the leverage created, which is typical in derivative contracts.

==Example of how forward prices should be agreed upon==
Continuing on the example above, suppose now that the initial price of Alice&#x27;s house is and that Bob enters into a forward contract to buy the house one year from today. But since Alice knows that she can immediately sell for and place the proceeds in the bank, she wants to be compensated for the delayed sale. Suppose that the risk free rate of return R (the bank rate) for one year is 4%. Then the money in the bank would grow to , risk free. So Alice would want at least one year from now for the contract to be worthwhile for her â the opportunity cost will be covered.

==Spotâforward parity==

For liquid assets (&quot;tradeables&quot;), spotâforward parity provides the link between the spot market and the forward market. It describes the relationship between the spot and forward price of the underlying asset in a forward contract. While the overall effect can be described as the &quot;cost of carry&quot;, this effect can be broken down into different components, specifically whether the asset:
* pays income, and if so whether this is on a discrete or continuous basis
* incurs storage costs
* is regarded as
** an &quot;investment asset&quot;, i.e. an asset held primarily for investment purposes (e.g. gold, financial securities);
** or a &quot;consumption asset&quot;, i.e. an asset held primarily for consumption (e.g. oil, iron ore etc.)

===Investment assets===
For an asset that provides no income, the relationship between the current forward (formula_5) and spot (formula_6) prices is

:formula_7

where formula_8 is the continuously compounded risk free rate of return, and &quot;T&quot; is the time to maturity. The intuition behind this result is that given you want to own the asset at time &quot;T&quot;, there should be no difference in a perfect capital market between buying the asset today and holding it and buying the forward contract and taking delivery. Thus, both approaches must cost the same in present value terms. For an arbitrage proof of why this is the case, see Rational pricing below.

For an asset that pays known income, the relationship becomes:

* Discrete: formula_9
* Continuous: formula_10

where formula_11 the present value of the discrete income at time formula_12, and formula_13 is the continuously compounded dividend yield over the life of the contract. The intuition is that when an asset pays income, there is a benefit to holding the asset rather than the forward because you get to receive this income. Hence the income (formula_14 or formula_15) must be subtracted to reflect this benefit. An example of an asset which pays discrete income might be a stock, and an example of an asset which pays a continuous yield might be a foreign currency or a stock index.

For investment assets which are commodities, such as gold and silver, storage costs must also be considered. Storage costs can be treated as &#x27;negative income&#x27;, and like income can be discrete or continuous. Hence with storage costs, the relationship becomes:

* Discrete: formula_16
* Continuous: formula_17

where formula_18 the present value of the discrete storage cost at time formula_12, and formula_20 is the continuously compounded storage cost where it is proportional to the price of the commodity, and is hence a &#x27;negative yield&#x27;. The intuition here is that because storage costs make the final price higher, we have to add them to the spot price.

===Consumption assets===
Consumption assets are typically raw material commodities which are used as a source of energy or in a production process, for example crude oil or iron ore. Users of these consumption commodities may feel that there is a benefit from physically holding the asset in inventory as opposed to holding a forward on the asset. These benefits include the ability to &quot;profit from&quot; (hedge against) temporary shortages and the ability to keep a production process running, and are referred to as the &quot;convenience yield&quot;. Thus, for consumption assets, the spot-forward relationship is:

* Discrete storage costs: formula_21
* Continuous storage costs: formula_22

where formula_23 is the convenience yield over the life of the contract. Since the convenience yield provides a benefit to the holder of the asset but not the holder of the forward, it can be modelled as a type of &#x27;dividend yield&#x27;. However, it is important to note that the convenience yield is a non cash item, but rather reflects the market&#x27;s expectations concerning future availability of the commodity. If users have low inventories of the commodity, this implies a greater chance of shortage, which means a higher convenience yield. The opposite is true when high inventories exist.

===Cost of carry===
The relationship between the spot and forward price of an asset reflects the net cost of holding (or carrying) that asset relative to holding the forward. Thus, all of the costs and benefits above can be summarised as the &quot;cost of carry&quot;, formula_24. Hence,

* Discrete: formula_25
* Continuous: formula_26

==Relationship between the forward price and the expected future spot price==

The market&#x27;s opinion about what the spot price of an asset will be in the future is the &quot;expected future spot price&quot;. Hence, a key question is whether or not the current forward price actually predicts the respective spot price in the future. There are a number of different hypotheses which try to explain the relationship between the current forward price, formula_27 and the expected future spot price, formula_28.

The economists John Maynard Keynes and John Hicks argued that in general, the natural hedgers of a commodity are those who wish to sell the commodity at a future point in time. Thus, hedgers will collectively hold a net short position in the forward market. The other side of these contracts are held by speculators, who must therefore hold a net long position. Hedgers are interested in reducing risk, and thus will accept losing money on their forward contracts. Speculators on the other hand, are interested in making a profit, and will hence only enter the contracts if they &quot;expect&quot; to make money. Thus, if speculators are holding a net long position, it must be the case that the expected future spot price is greater than the forward price.

In other words, the expected payoff to the speculator at maturity is:
:formula_29, where formula_1 is the delivery price at maturity

Thus, if the speculators expect to profit,
:formula_31
:formula_32
:formula_33, as formula_34 when they enter the contract

This market situation, where formula_33, is referred to as normal backwardation. Forward/futures prices converge with the spot price at maturity, as can be seen from the previous relationships by letting T go to 0 (see also basis); then normal backwardation implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are increasing over time. The opposite situation, where formula_36, is referred to as contango. Likewise, contango implies that futures prices for a certain maturity are falling over time.

==Futures versus Forwards==

Forward contracts are very similar to futures contracts, except they are not exchange-traded, or defined on standardized assets. Forwards also typically have no interim partial settlements or &quot;true-ups&quot; in margin requirements like futures, that is the parties do not exchange additional property securing the party at gain and the entire unrealized gain or loss builds up while the contract is open. Therefore, forward contracts have a significant counterparty risk which is also the reason why they are not readily available to retail investors. However, being traded over the counter (OTC), forward contracts specification can be customized and may include mark-to-market and daily margin calls.

Having no upfront cashflows is one of the advantages of a forward contract compared to its futures counterpart. Especially when the forward contract is denominated in a foreign currency, not having to post (or receive) daily settlements simplifies cashflow management.

Compared to the futures markets it is very difficult to close out one&#x27;s position, that is to rescind the forward contract. For instance while being long in a forward contract, entering short into another forward contract might cancel out delivery obligations but adds to credit risk exposure as there are now three parties involved. Closing out a contract almost always involves reaching out to the counterparty.

Compared to their futures counterparts, forwards (especially Forward Rate Agreements) need convexity adjustments, that is a drift term that accounts for future rate changes. In futures contracts, this risk remains constant whereas a forward contract&#x27;s risk changes when rates change.

==Outright versus Premium==

Outright prices, as opposed to premium points or forward points, are quoted in absolute price units. Outrights are used in markets where there is no (unitary) spot price or rate for reference, or where the spot price (rate) is not easily accessible.

Conversely, in markets with easily accessible spot prices or basis rates, in particular the Foreign exchange market and OIS market, forwards are usually quoted using premium points or forward points. That is using the spot price or basis rate as reference forwards are quoted as the difference in pips between the outright price and the spot price for FX, or the difference in basis points between the forward rate and the basis rate for interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements.

Note: The term &quot;outright&quot; is used in the futures markets in a similar way but is contrasted with futures spreads instead of premium points, which is more than just a quoting convention, and in particular involves the simultaneous transaction in two outright futures.

==Rational pricing==

If formula_37 is the spot price of an asset at time formula_38, and formula_8 is the continuously compounded rate, then the forward price at a future time formula_40 must satisfy formula_41.

To prove this, suppose not. Then we have two possible cases.

Case 1: Suppose that formula_42. Then an investor can execute the following trades at time formula_38:

# go to the bank and get a loan with amount formula_44 at the continuously compounded rate r;
# with this money from the bank, buy one unit of asset for formula_44;
# enter into one short forward contract costing 0. A short forward contract means that the investor owes the counterparty the asset at time formula_40.

The initial cost of the trades at the initial time sum to zero.

At time formula_40 the investor can reverse the trades that were executed at time formula_38. Specifically, and mirroring the trades 1., 2. and 3. the investor

#&#x27; repays the loan to the bank. The inflow to the investor is formula_49;
#&#x27; settles the short forward contract by selling the asset for formula_50. The cash inflow to the investor is now formula_50 because the buyer receives formula_2 from the investor.

The sum of the inflows in 1.&#x27; and 2.&#x27; equals formula_53, which by hypothesis, is positive. This is an arbitrage profit. Consequently, and assuming that the non-arbitrage condition holds, we have a contradiction. This is called a cash and carry arbitrage because you &quot;carry&quot; the asset until maturity.

Case 2: Suppose that formula_54. Then an investor can do the reverse of what he has done above in case 1. This means selling one unit of the asset, investing this money into a bank account and entering a long forward contract costing 0.

Note: if you look at the convenience yield page, you will see that if there are finite assets/inventory, the reverse cash and carry arbitrage is not always possible. It would depend on the elasticity of demand for forward contracts and such like.

===Extensions to the forward pricing formula===

Suppose that formula_55 is the time value of cash flows &quot;X&quot; at the contract expiration time formula_40. The forward price is then given by the formula:

:formula_57

The cash flows can be in the form of dividends from the asset, or costs of maintaining the asset.

If these price relationships do not hold, there is an arbitrage opportunity for a riskless profit similar to that discussed above. One implication of this is that the presence of a forward market will force spot prices to reflect current expectations of future prices. As a result, the forward price for nonperishable commodities, securities or currency is no more a predictor of future price than the spot price is - the relationship between forward and spot prices is driven by interest rates. For perishable commodities, arbitrage does not have this

The above forward pricing formula can also be written as:

:formula_58

Where formula_59 is the time &quot;t&quot; value of all cash flows over the life of the contract.

For more details about pricing, see forward price.

==Theories of why a forward contract exists==
Allaz and Vila (1993) suggest that there is also a strategic reason (in an imperfect competitive environment) for the existence of forward trading, that is, forward trading can be used even in a world without uncertainty. This is due to firms having Stackelberg incentives to anticipate their production through forward contracts.

<text>In mathematics, the Erlangen program is a method of characterizing geometries based on group theory and projective geometry. It was published by Felix Klein in 1872 as &quot;Vergleichende Betrachtungen Ã¼ber neuere geometrische Forschungen.&quot; It is named after the University Erlangen-NÃ¼rnberg, where Klein worked.

By 1872, non-Euclidean geometries had emerged, but without a way to determine their hierarchy and relationships. Klein&#x27;s method was fundamentally innovative in three ways:

:* Projective geometry was emphasized as the unifying frame for all other geometries considered by him. In particular, Euclidean geometry was more restrictive than affine geometry, which in turn is more restrictive than projective geometry.

:* Klein proposed that group theory, a branch of mathematics that uses algebraic methods to abstract the idea of symmetry, was the most useful way of organizing geometrical knowledge; at the time it had already been introduced into the theory of equations in the form of Galois theory.

:* Klein made much more explicit the idea that each geometrical language had its own, appropriate concepts, thus for example projective geometry rightly talked about conic sections, but not about circles or angles because those notions were not invariant under projective transformations (something familiar in geometrical perspective). The way the multiple languages of geometry then came back together could be explained by the way subgroups of a symmetry group related to each other.

Later, Ãlie Cartan generalized Klein&#x27;s homogeneous model spaces to Cartan connections on certain principal bundles, which generalized Riemannian geometry.

==The problems of nineteenth century geometry==

Since Euclid, geometry had meant the geometry of Euclidean space of two dimensions (plane geometry) or of three dimensions (solid geometry). In the first half of the nineteenth century there had been several developments complicating the picture. Mathematical applications required geometry of four or more dimensions; the close scrutiny of the foundations of the traditional Euclidean geometry had revealed the independence of the parallel postulate from the others, and non-Euclidean geometry had been born. Klein proposed an idea that all these new geometries are just special cases of the projective geometry, as already developed by Poncelet, MÃ¶bius, Cayley and others. Klein also strongly suggested to mathematical &quot;physicists&quot; that even a moderate cultivation of the projective purview might bring substantial benefits to them.

With every geometry, Klein associated an underlying group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically represented as a hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved with respect to the Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in projective geometry. Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of projective geometry, any notion invariant in projective geometry is &quot;a priori&quot; meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you remove required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).

==Homogeneous spaces==

In other words, the &quot;traditional spaces&quot; are homogeneous spaces; but not for a uniquely determined group. Changing the group changes the appropriate geometric language.

In today&#x27;s language, the groups concerned in classical geometry are all very well known as Lie groups: the classical groups. The specific relationships are quite simply described, using technical language.

===Examples===

For example, the group of projective geometry in &quot;n&quot; real-valued dimensions is the symmetry group of &quot;n&quot;-dimensional real projective space (the general linear group of degree , quotiented by scalar matrices). The affine group will be the subgroup respecting (mapping to itself, not fixing pointwise) the chosen hyperplane at infinity. This subgroup has a known structure (semidirect product of the general linear group of degree &quot;n&quot; with the subgroup of translations). This description then tells us which properties are &#x27;affine&#x27;. In Euclidean plane geometry terms, being a parallelogram is affine since affine transformations always take one parallelogram to another one. Being a circle is not affine since an affine shear will take a circle into an ellipse.

To explain accurately the relationship between affine and Euclidean geometry, we now need to pin down the group of Euclidean geometry within the affine group. The Euclidean group is in fact (using the previous description of the affine group) the semi-direct product of the orthogonal (rotation and reflection) group with the translations. (See Klein geometry for more details.)

==Influence on later work==

The long-term effects of the Erlangen program can be seen all over pure mathematics (see tacit use at congruence (geometry), for example); and the idea of transformations and of synthesis using groups of symmetry has become standard in physics.

When topology is routinely described in terms of properties invariant under homeomorphism, one can see the underlying idea in operation. The groups involved will be infinite-dimensional in almost all cases â and not Lie groups â but the philosophy is the same. Of course this mostly speaks to the pedagogical influence of Klein. Books such as those by H.S.M. Coxeter routinely used the Erlangen program approach to help &#x27;place&#x27; geometries. In pedagogic terms, the program became transformation geometry, a mixed blessing in the sense that it builds on stronger intuitions than the style of Euclid, but is less easily converted into a logical system.

In his book &quot;Structuralism&quot; (1970) Jean Piaget says, &quot;In the eyes of contemporary structuralist mathematicians, like Bourbaki, the Erlangen program amounts to only a partial victory for structuralism, since they want to subordinate all mathematics, not just geometry, to the idea of structure.&quot;

For a geometry and its group, an element of the group is sometimes called a motion of the geometry. For example, one can learn about the PoincarÃ© half-plane model of hyperbolic geometry through a development based on hyperbolic motions. Such a development enables one to methodically prove the ultraparallel theorem by successive motions.

==Abstract returns from the Erlangen program==
Quite often, it appears there are two or more distinct geometries with isomorphic automorphism groups. There arises the question of reading the Erlangen program from the &quot;abstract&quot; group, to the geometry.

One example: oriented (i.e., reflections not included) elliptic geometry (i.e., the surface of an &quot;n&quot;-sphere with opposite points identified) and oriented spherical geometry (the same non-Euclidean geometry, but with opposite points not identified) have isomorphic automorphism group, SO(&quot;n&quot;+1) for even &quot;n&quot;. These may appear to be distinct. It turns out, however, that the geometries are very closely related, in a way that can be made precise.

To take another example, elliptic geometries with different radii of curvature have isomorphic automorphism groups. That does not really count as a critique as all such geometries are isomorphic. General Riemannian geometry falls outside the boundaries of the program.

Complex, dual and double (also known as split-complex) numbers appear as homogeneous spaces SL(2,R)/H for the group SL(2,R) and its subgroups H=A, N, K. The group SL(2,R) acts on these homogeneous spaces by linear fractional transformations and a large portion of the respective geometries can be obtained in a uniform way from the Erlangen program.

Some further notable examples have come up in physics.

Firstly, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional hyperbolic geometry, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional de Sitter space and (&quot;n&quot;â1)-dimensional inversive geometry all have isomorphic automorphism groups,

:formula_1

the orthochronous Lorentz group, for . But these are apparently distinct geometries. Here some interesting results enter, from the physics. It has been shown that physics models in each of the three geometries are &quot;dual&quot; for some models.

Again, &quot;n&quot;-dimensional anti-de Sitter space and (&quot;n&quot;â1)-dimensional conformal space with &quot;Lorentzian&quot; signature (in contrast with conformal space with &quot;Euclidean&quot; signature, which is identical to inversive geometry, for three dimensions or greater) have isomorphic automorphism groups, but are distinct geometries. Once again, there are models in physics with &quot;dualities&quot; between both spaces. See AdS/CFT for more details.

The covering group of SU(2,2) is isomorphic to the covering group of SO(4,2), which is the symmetry group of a 4D conformal Minkowski space and a 5D anti-de Sitter space and a complex four-dimensional twistor space.

The Erlangen program can therefore still be considered fertile, in relation with dualities in physics.

In the seminal paper which introduced categories, Saunders Mac Lane and Samuel Eilenberg stated: &quot;This may be regarded as a continuation of the Klein Erlanger Programm, in the sense that a geometrical space with its group of transformations is generalized to a category with its algebra of mappings.&quot;

Relations of the Erlangen program with work of Charles Ehresmann on groupoids in geometry is considered in the article below by Pradines.

In mathematical logic, the Erlangen program also served as an inspiration for Alfred Tarski in his analysis of logical notions.

<text>Disulfiram is a medication used to support the treatment of chronic alcoholism by producing an acute sensitivity to ethanol (drinking alcohol). Disulfiram works by inhibiting the enzyme aldehyde dehydrogenase (specifically the ALDH2 enzyme), causing many of the effects of a hangover to be felt immediately following alcohol consumption. Disulfiram plus alcohol, even small amounts, produces flushing, throbbing in the head and neck, a throbbing headache, respiratory difficulty, nausea, copious vomiting, sweating, thirst, chest pain, palpitation, shortness of breath, hyperventilation, fast heart rate, low blood pressure, fainting, marked uneasiness, weakness, vertigo, blurred vision, and confusion. In severe reactions there may be respiratory depression, cardiovascular collapse, abnormal heart rhythms, heart attack, acute congestive heart failure, unconsciousness, convulsions, and death.

In the body, alcohol is converted to acetaldehyde, which is then broken down by acetaldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH2). When the dehydrogenase enzyme is inhibited, acetaldehyde builds up, causing unpleasant side effects . The clinical use of disulfiram mimics the genetic predisposition to alcohol intolerance that is found in East Asian populations due to the mutation of the ALDH2 gene. 

== Medical uses ==
Disulfiram is used as a second-line treatment, behind acamprosate and naltrexone, for alcohol dependence.

Under normal metabolism, alcohol is broken down in the liver by the enzyme alcohol dehydrogenase to acetaldehyde, which is then converted by the enzyme acetaldehyde dehydrogenase to a harmless acetic acid derivative (acetyl coenzyme A). Disulfiram blocks this reaction at the intermediate stage by blocking acetaldehyde dehydrogenase. After alcohol intake under the influence of disulfiram, the concentration of acetaldehyde in the blood may be five to 10 times higher than that found during metabolism of the same amount of alcohol alone. As acetaldehyde is one of the major causes of the symptoms of a hangover, this produces immediate and severe negative reaction to alcohol intake. About 5 to 10 minutes after alcohol intake, the patient may experience the effects of a severe hangover for a period of 30 minutes up to several hours. Symptoms usually include flushing of the skin, accelerated heart rate, low blood pressure, nausea, and vomiting. Uncommon adverse events include shortness of breath, throbbing headache, visual disturbance, mental confusion, postural syncope, and circulatory collapse.

Disulfiram should not be taken if alcohol has been consumed in the last 12 hours. There is no tolerance to disulfiram: the longer it is taken, the stronger its effects. As disulfiram is absorbed slowly through the digestive tract and eliminated slowly by the body, the effects may last for up to two weeks after the initial intake; consequently, medical ethics dictate that patients must be fully informed about the disulfiram-alcohol reaction.

Disulfiram does not reduce alcohol cravings, so a major problem associated with this drug is extremely poor compliance. Methods to improve compliance include subdermal implants, which release the drug continuously over a period of up to 12 weeks, and supervised administration practices, for example, having the drug regularly administered by one&#x27;s spouse.

Although disulfiram remained the most common pharmaceutical treatment of alcohol abuse until the end of the 20th century, today it is often replaced or accompanied with newer drugs, primarily the combination of naltrexone and acamprosate, which directly attempt to address physiological processes in the brain associated with alcohol abuse.

== Side effects ==
The most common side effects in the absence of alcohol are headache, and a metallic or garlic taste in the mouth, though more severe side effects may occur. Tryptophol, a chemical compound that induces sleep in humans, is formed in the liver after disulfiram treatment. Less common side effects include decrease in libido, liver problems, skin rash, and nerve inflammation. Liver toxicity is an uncommon but potentially serious side effect, and risk groups e.g. those with already impaired liver function should be monitored closely. That said, the rate of disulfiram-induced hepatitis are estimated to be in between 1 per 25,000 to 1 in 30,000, and rarely the primary cause for treatment cessation.

Cases of disulfiram neurotoxicity have also occurred, causing extrapyramidal and other symptoms. Disulfiram can produce neuropathy in daily doses of less than the usually recommended 500Â mg. Nerve biopsies showed axonal degeneration and the neuropathy is difficult to distinguish from that associated with ethanol abuse. Disulfiram neuropathy occurs after a variable latent period (mean 5 to 6 months) and progresses steadily. Slow improvement may occur when the drug&#x27;s use is stopped; often there is complete recovery eventually.

Disulfiram disrupts metabolism of several other compounds, including paracetamol (acetaminophen), theophylline and caffeine. Disulfiram is a potent CYP2E1 inhibitor, explaining how it reduces the metabolism of several other medicines.

==Similarly acting substances==
In medicine, the term &quot;disulfiram effect&quot; refers to an adverse effect of a particular medication in causing an unpleasant hypersensitivity to alcohol, similar to the effect caused by disulfiram administration.

Examples:

* Antibiotics (nitroimidazoles), e.g., metronidazole
* First-generation sulfonylureas, e.g., tolbutamide and chlorpropamide
* Several cephalosporin drugs, including cefoperazone, cefamandole and cefotetan, that have a N-methylthio-tetrazole moiety
* Griseofulvin, an oral antifungal drug
* Procarbazine
* Temposil, or citrated calcium carbimide, has the same function as disulfiram, but is weaker and safer.
* Coprine, which metabolizes to 1-aminocyclopropanol, a chemical having the same metabolic effects as disulfiram. It occurs naturally in the otherwise edible common ink cap mushroom (&quot;Coprinopsis atramentaria&quot;), hence its colloquial name &quot;tippler&#x27;s bane&quot;. Similar reactions have been recorded with &quot;Clitocybe clavipes&quot; and &quot;Suillellus luridus&quot;, although the agent in those species is unknown.

==Pharmacology==
===Pharmacodynamics===
Disulfiram acts as an irreversible aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH) inhibitor. ALDH is an enzyme that catalyze the oxidation of aldehydes. It is known to inactivate acetaldehyde, a toxic metabolite of alcohol. By inhibiting ALDH, disulfiram prevents the inactivation and detoxification of acetaldehyde and thereby induces a variety of unpleasant symptoms when alcohol is consumed.

Besides inhibiting ALDH, disulfiram is a dopamine Î²-hydroxylase (DBH) inhibitor. DBH is an enzyme that converts the monoamine neurotransmitter dopamine into norepinephrine. By inhibiting DBH, disulfiram may increase dopamine levels in the brain and periphery but decrease levels of norepinephrine and its metabolite epinephrine in the brain and periphery. However, it is also possible that disulfiram may actually decrease brain dopamine levels. DBH inhibition by disulfiram may explain its possible therapeutic benefits in cocaine dependence as well as cases of psychosis and mania associated with the drug. There are also cases of disulfiram producing stimulant psychosis in combination with the psychostimulants methylphenidate and amphetamine. DBH inhibition by disulfiram might also explain the hypotension side effect when alcohol is ingested in people taking disulfiram.

Disulfiram is also known to inhibit the cytochrome P450 enzymes CYP2E1 and CYP1A2.

==History==
The synthesis of disulfiram, originally known as tetraethylthiuram disulfide, was first reported in 1881. By around 1900, it was introduced to the industrial process of sulfur vulcanization of rubber and became widely used. In 1937, a plant physician in the American rubber industry described adverse reactions to alcohol in workers exposed to tetramethylthiuram monosulfide and disulfide, and proposed that this effect of disulfiram and related compounds might lead to âthe cure for alcoholismâ; the effect was also noticed in workers at a Swedish rubber boot factory.

In the early 1940s it had been tested as a treatment for scabies, a parasitic skin infection, as well as intestinal worms.

Around that time, during the German occupation of Denmark, Erik Jacobsen and Jens Hald at the Danish drug company Medicinalco picked up on that research and began exploring the use of disulfiram to treat intestinal parasites. The company had a group of enthusiastic self-experimenters that called itself the &quot;Death Battalion&quot;, and in the course of testing the drug on themselves, accidentally discovered that drinking alcohol while the drug was still in their bodies made them mildly sick.

They made that discovery in 1945, and did nothing with it until two years later, when Jacobsen gave an impromptu talk and mentioned that work, which was discussed afterwards in newspapers at the time, leading them to further explore the use of the drug for that purpose. That work included small clinical trials with Oluf Martensen-Larsen, a doctor who worked with alcoholics. They published their work starting in 1948.

The chemists at Medicinalco discovered a new form of disulfiram while trying to purify a batch that had been contaminated with copper. This form turned out to have better pharmacological properties, and the company patented it and used that form for the product that was introduced as Antabus (later anglicized to Antabuse).

This work led to renewed study of the human metabolism of ethanol. It was already known that ethanol was mostly metabolized in the liver, with it being converted first to acetaldehyde and then acetaldehyde to acetic acid and carbon dioxide, but the enzymes involved were not known. By 1950 the work led to the knowledge that ethanol is oxidized to acetaldehyde by alcohol dehydrogenase and acetaldehyde is oxidized to acetic acid by aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and that disulfiram works by inhibiting ALDH, leading to a buildup of acetaldehyde, which is what causes the negative effects in the body.

The drug was first marketed in Denmark and as of 2008, Denmark is the country where it is most widely prescribed. It was approved by the FDA in 1951. The FDA later approved other drugs for treatment of alcoholism, namely naltrexone in 1994 and acamprosate in 2004.

== Society and culture ==
Though the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) in the US has not set a permissible exposure limit (PEL) for disulfiram in the workplace, the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has set a recommended exposure limit (REL) of 2Â mg/m3 and recommended that workers avoid concurrent exposure to ethylene dibromide.

== Research ==
Disulfiram has been studied as a possible treatment for cancer, parasitic infections, anxiety disorder, obesity and latent HIV infection.

=== Cancer ===
When disulfiram creates complexes with metals (dithiocarbamate complexes), it is a proteasome inhibitor and as of 2016 it had been studied in &quot;in vitro&quot; experiments, model animals, and small clinical trials as a possible treatment for liver metastasis, metastatic melanoma, glioblastoma, non-small cell lung cancer, and prostate cancer.

=== Parasitic infections ===
In the body, disulfiram is metabolized to diethyldithiocarbamate (ditiocarb), which binds to metal ions such as zinc or copper to form zinc or copper diethyldithiocarbamate (zinc or copper ditiocarb). The zinc diethyldithiocarbamate (zinc-ditiocarb) metabolite of disulfiram is extremely potent against the diarrhea and liver abscess-causing parasite &quot;Entamoeba histolytica&quot; and might be active against other deadly parasites.

=== HIV ===
Disulfiram has also been identified by systematic high-throughput screening as a potential HIV latency reversing agent (LRA). Reactivation of latent HIV infection in patients is part of an investigational strategy known as &quot;shock and kill&quot; which may be able to reduce or eliminate the HIV reservoir. Recent phase II dose-escalation studies in patients with HIV who are controlled on antiretroviral therapy have observed an increase in cell-associated unspliced HIV RNA with increasing exposure to disulfiram and its metabolites. Disulfiram is also being investigated in combination with vorinostat, another investigational latency reversing agent, to treat HIV.

<text>The Charlotte Hornets are an American professional basketball team based in Charlotte, North Carolina. The Hornets compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the Southeast Division of the Eastern Conference. The team plays its home games at the Spectrum Center.

The original Charlotte Hornets franchise was established in 1988 as an expansion team owned by George Shinn. In 2002, Shinn moved the franchise to New Orleans. The team continued to play as the Hornets until 2013, when its name was changed to the New Orleans Pelicans.

As part of an agreement with the NBA, a new team known as the Charlotte Bobcats began competing in the 2004â05 NBA season. On June 15, 2006, Michael Jordan, a former NBA player and member of the Naismith Basketball Hall of Fame, acquired a minority stake in the franchise and became its managing member of basketball operations. On February 17, 2010, an ownership group led by Jordan purchased a majority share of the franchise. In 2013, the Bobcats announced they would begin playing under the Charlotte Hornets name in the 2014â15 season. On the day the name change became official, the franchise reclaimed the history and records of the original Hornets. The Hornets are now retroactively considered as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are now considered a 2002 expansion team.

In August 2023, Jordan sold his majority stake in the Hornets to a group of investors led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall. He retained a minority share in the ownership of the team.

==History==

===1985â1988: Creation of the Hornets===
In 1985, the NBA was planning to expand by three teams by the 1988â89 season, later modified to include a total of four expansion teams. George Shinn, an entrepreneur from Kannapolis, wanted to bring an NBA team to the Charlotte area, and he assembled a group of prominent local businessmen to head the prospective franchise. The Charlotte area had long been a hotbed for college basketball. Charlotte was also one of the fastest-growing cities in the United States, and was previously one of the three in-state regional homes to the American Basketball Association&#x27;s (ABA) Carolina Cougars from 1969 to 1974.

Despite doubt from critics, Shinn&#x27;s ace in the hole was the Charlotte Coliseum, a state-of-the-art arena that would seat almost 24,000 spectators, the largest basketball-specific arena ever to serve as a full-time home for an NBA team. On April 5, 1987, then-NBA Commissioner David Stern called Shinn to tell him his group had been awarded the 24th NBA franchise, to begin play in 1988. Franchises were also granted to Miami, MinneapolisâSaint Paul, and Orlando.

Originally, the new team was going to be called the &quot;Charlotte Spirit&quot;, but a name-the-team contest yielded &quot;Hornets&quot; as the winning choice. The name originates from British General Cornwallis, who allegedly described the city as &quot;a hornet&#x27;s nest of rebellion&quot; following the Battle of Charlotte in 1780, though it was first attested in 1819. The team received further attention when it chose teal as its primary color, setting off a sports fashion craze in the late 1980s and early 1990s. The team&#x27;s uniforms, designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian, featured a first for NBA uniforms: pin stripes. Similar designs by other teams followed, as they became a hit.

Shinn hired Carl Scheer as the team&#x27;s first President and General Manager. Scheer preferred a roster of veteran players, hoping to put together a competitive team as soon as possible. Former college coach and veteran NBA assistant Dick Harter was hired as the team&#x27;s first head coach. In 1988, the Hornets and the Miami Heat were part of the 1988 NBA Expansion Draft. Unlike many expansion franchises that invest in the future with a team composed entirely of young players, Charlotte stocked its inaugural roster with several veterans in hopes of putting a competitive lineup on the court right away. The team also had three draft picks at the 1988 NBA draft.

===1988â1992: Early seasons===

The Hornets&#x27; first NBA game took place on November 4, 1988, at the Charlotte Coliseum, losing 133â93 to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Four days later, the team notched its first-ever victory over the Los Angeles Clippers, 117â105. On December 23, 1988, the Hornets beat Michael Jordan and the Chicago Bulls 103â101 in Jordan&#x27;s first return to North Carolina as a professional. The Hornets finished their inaugural season with a record of 20â62. Scheer left prior to the 1989â90 season.

Despite initial concerns that the Coliseum was too big, the Hornets were a runaway hit, leading the NBA in attendance, a feat they would achieve seven more times in Charlotte. Eventually, the Hornets would sell out 364 consecutive games.

The Hornets&#x27; second season was a struggle from start to finish. Members of the team rebelled against Dick Harter&#x27;s defense-oriented style, and he was replaced mid-season by assistant Gene Littles following an 8â32 start. Despite the change, the team continued to struggle, finishing the season with a disappointing 19â63 record.

The team showed improvement during the following season. They won eight of their first fifteen games, including a 120â105 victory over the Washington Bullets. However, the team went cold, losing their next eleven games. The Hornets, who hosted the 1991 NBA All-Star Game, finished with a 26â56 record. Despite the team&#x27;s seven-game improvement over the previous season, Gene Littles was fired at the end of the season and replaced by general manager Allan Bristow.

With the first pick in the 1991 NBA draft, the Hornets drafted power forward Larry Johnson from the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Johnson had an impact season, finishing among the league leaders in points and rebounds, and winning the 1992 NBA Rookie of the Year Award. Additionally, Guard Kendall Gill led the club in scoring, averaging over 20 points per game. The team stayed in contention for a playoff spot until March, but finished the year with a 31â51 record.

===1992â1995: The Larry Johnson/Alonzo Mourning era===
The Hornets were in the lottery again in 1992 and won the second overall pick in the draft, using it to select Georgetown center Alonzo Mourning. Charlotte now had two 20â10 threats in Johnson and Mourning, who with Kendall Gill, formed perhaps the league&#x27;s top young trio. The team finished their fifth season at 44â38, their first-ever winning record and good enough for the first playoff berth in franchise history. Finishing fifth in the Eastern Conference, the Hornets upset the Boston Celtics in the first round, with Mourning winning the series with a 20-footer in game four. However, the Hornets lacked the experience and depth to defeat the New York Knicks, falling in five games in the second round.

The Hornets finished the 1993â94 season with a 41â41 record, narrowly missing the playoffs. Despite injuries to both Johnson and Mourning, the two led the team in points-per-game.

In the 1994â95 season, the Hornets finished with a 50â32 record, returning to the playoffs. Johnson and Mourning again led the team in points-per-game, while also leading the club in rebounding. However, Charlotte was bounced from the playoffs in the first round, falling to the Chicago Bulls in four games. Following the season, the Hornets traded Mourning to the Miami Heat for forward Glen Rice, center Matt Geiger, and guard Khalid Reeves.

===1995â1998: The Glen Rice era===
Glen Rice would make an immediate impact after joining the Hornets, leading the team in scoring and points-per-game during the 1995â96 season. While Rice and Johnson provided high-powered scoring, Geiger tied with Johnson for the team lead in rebounds, and All-Star guard Kenny Anderson ran the point for the injured Muggsy Bogues. The Hornets were competitive but failed to qualify for the playoffs, again finishing with a 41â41 record. Allan Bristow resigned at the end of the season, and was replaced by Dave Cowens.

The 1996 off-season was again marked by vast changes: Anderson declined to re-sign, Johnson was shipped to the Knicks for power forward Anthony Mason, and the team made a trade on draft day 1996, acquiring center Vlade Divac from the Los Angeles Lakers in exchange for the rights to rookie and future Hall of Famer Kobe Bryant, whom the Hornets picked 13th overall. The new-look Hornets were successful, with Divac and Geiger providing the center combination, Mason averaging a double-double, Bogues back at the point, and Rice having the finest season of his career. The team achieved the best season in its history at the time, finishing 54â28, and making it back to the playoffs. Despite the success during the regular season, the Hornets went down rather meekly to the Knicks in three games.

The 1997â98 season was also successful. Muggsy Bogues was traded two games into the season, and the team picked up point guard David Wesley and shooting guard Bobby Phills. With Wesley, Phills, Rice, Mason, and Divac, the Hornets romped through the regular season, finishing with a 51â31 record. The Hornets made it to back-to-back playoffs for the first time in franchise history, advancing to the second round, only to be stopped by the Bulls.

===1998â2002: Final years of original personnel===

The 1998â99 season was shortened. The season did not start until February, as the lockout shortened the regular season to only 50 games. Additionally, Glen Rice was traded to the Lakers for Eddie Jones and Elden Campbell, and Dave Cowens resigned midway through the season. He was replaced by former Celtics teammate Paul Silas, who became the team&#x27;s fifth head coach. The team finished with a 26â24 record, but failed to qualify for the playoffs.

The next three seasons (1999â2000, 2000â01 and 2001â02) saw the Hornets in the playoffs each year, reaching the conference semifinals twice. Before the Hornets were eliminated from the 2002 playoffs, the NBA approved a deal for the team to move to New Orleans following the 2002â03 season. The move came mainly because attendance tailed off dramatically, reportedly due to Shinn&#x27;s declining popularity in the city.

===2004â2014: Charlotte Bobcats===
Shortly after the relocation of the team to New Orleans, as part of the deal with the city of Charlotte, as well as to avoid a Cleveland Brownsâlike lawsuit, the NBA opened itself to the possibility of adding a replacement team in Charlotte for the 2004â05 season, provided that an arena deal could be reached. Several ownership groups, including one led by former Boston Celtics star Larry Bird, made bids for the franchise. On December 18, 2002, a group led by BET founder Robert L. Johnson was awarded the franchise, allowing him to become the first African American majority owner in U.S. major professional sports since the Negro leagues. The franchise with Johnson as its owner was approved by the NBA Board of Governors on January 10, 2003. Hip-hop artist Nelly became a notable co-owner. The owners paid a $300 million expansion fee to enter the league.

In June 2003, the team name was officially announced as the Bobcats. The Charlotte Regional Sports Commission aided the naming process with a &quot;Help Name The Team&quot; effort that drew over 1,250 suggestions, with &#x27;Flight&#x27; being the winner. However, it was discarded by Johnson and the team involved in creating the team&#x27;s identity, being considered abstract and reminiscent of the then-current Iraq War aerial strikes. Given Charlotte was already home to a cat-named team, the Carolina Panthers of the National Football League, designer Chris Weiller made sure to create a logo that would not be similar to the Panthers logo. It has also been speculated that Johnson chose the name &quot;Bobcats&quot; in reference to his own name.

The Bobcats hired Bernie Bickerstaff as the first head coach and general manager in franchise history. A new arena to host the Bobcats in uptown Charlotte began construction in July 2003. The team would play its home games at the Coliseum until the new building was ready.

====2004â2010: Return to Charlotte====

The Bobcats held their expansion draft on June 22, 2004, picking up youngsters such as Gerald Wallace, PrimoÅ¾ Brezec, and Jason Kapono. Shortly after, they traded with the Los Angeles Clippers to acquire the second pick in the 2004 NBA draft, which they used to select center Emeka Okafor from Connecticut. The Bobcats&#x27; inaugural game, and the first of their 2004â05 season took place on November 4 at the Charlotte Coliseum, and was a 103â96 loss to the Washington Wizards. Two days later, they won their first game in franchise history over the Orlando Magic, 111â100. On December 14, the Bobcats beat the New Orleans Hornets in overtime in the team&#x27;s first trip to Charlotte since relocating. The Bobcats finished their inaugural season 18â64. Emeka Okafor, however, won the 2004â05 NBA Rookie of the Year Award.

In the 2005 NBA draft, the Bobcats drafted Raymond Felton and Sean May from North Carolina. In their second season, the Bobcats opened Charlotte Bobcats Arena with an overtime victory over the Celtics. Despite struggling for most of the year, they managed to close out the season with four straight wins to finish with a record of 26â56, an eight-game improvement from the previous season. After the season, the Bobcats announced that NBA legend and North Carolina native Michael Jordan had bought a minority stake in the team. As part of the deal, he became head of basketball operations, though Bickerstaff remained general manager.

The Bobcats showed some improvement during the 2006â07 season, posting a playoff-hopeful record of 22â33 late in February 2007. However, the team went through an eight-game losing streak and dropped their record to 22â41 by early March 2007. Following the slump, Jordan announced that Bickerstaff would not return to coach the following season, but would finish coaching the remainder of the 2006â07 season. The Bobcats won 11 of their last 19 games of Bickerstaff&#x27;s tenure to finish their third season 33â49. On June 3, 2007, Charlotte Coliseum was demolished, marking a bitter end to the original Hornets era as it was the home of Charlotte&#x27;s original NBA franchise. The arena was only 19 years old, owned by the city of Charlotte, but was already considered outdated because of a lack of luxury boxes and suites. The arena was designed for college basketball as part of Charlotte&#x27;s push to maintain their presence in the ACC basketball tournament rotation.

Front office and coaching were key focuses for the Bobcats during the 2007 off-season. Rod Higgins was hired as general manager, and Sam Vincent was hired as the second head coach in franchise history. In the 2007 NBA draft, Brandan Wright was selected by the Bobcats with the eighth pick; he was subsequently traded to Golden State for Jason Richardson. The Bobcats were unable to capitalize on off-season moves, finishing the 2007â08 season with a 32â50 record. The team struggled amid rumors of players clashing with the coach. After a year, during which he struggled with personnel decisions, Sam Vincent was fired in April 2008.
On April 29, 2008, the Bobcats reached an agreement to hire Basketball Hall of Famer Larry Brown as the third head coach in franchise history. In the 2008 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected D. J. Augustin from Texas ninth overall. On December 10, 2008, a little over a month into the season, the Bobcats obtained Boris Diaw and Raja Bell in a trade with Phoenix. The trade turned out to be successful as the team came close to reaching the franchise&#x27;s first playoff berth, but finished four games out of eighth place with a record of 35â47. Following the season, majority owner Bob Johnson announced he was putting the team up for sale.

During the off-season, the team picked Gerald Henderson from Duke 12th overall in the 2009 NBA draft. The Bobcats traded Emeka Okafor for New Orleans Hornets&#x27; center Tyson Chandler, and through more trades acquired Stephen Jackson and Acie Law from the Golden State Warriors. On February 27, 2010, it was announced that Johnson had decided to sell the team to Jordan, allowing Jordan to become the first former NBA player to become majority owner of a franchise.

On April 9, 2010, the Bobcats clinched their first playoff berth since 2002 with a 104â103 road win over the New Orleans Hornets, finishing the 2009â10 season with an overall record of 44â38, their first-ever winning season. Gerald Wallace was a huge factor in the playoff run as he became the Bobcats&#x27; first and only NBA All-Star. However, the Bobcats were swept by the Orlando Magic in four games.

====2010â2014: Final years of the Bobcats====
Despite the departures of Raymond Felton and Tyson Chandler, the Bobcats hoped to make the playoffs for a second straight season. Following a dismal 9â19 start, Jordan announced that Larry Brown had stepped down as head coach. Paul Silas was hired as their new head coach the same day. The Bobcats sent Wallace to the Portland Trail Blazers and received two first-round draft picks, Joel Przybilla, Sean Marks, and Dante Cunningham, also acquiring D. J. White and Morris Peterson in a trade with the Thunder. Going down the stretch, injuries to both Stephen Jackson and Tyrus Thomas derailed any chances of Charlotte trying to catch the Indiana Pacers for the eighth spot in the east. In the end, the Bobcats finished the season with a 34â48 record overall, finishing 25â29 under Silas.
On June 13, 2011, the Bobcats made some changes to their front office by hiring former Trail Blazers general manager Rich Cho to the same position and promoting Rod Higgins to President of Basketball Operations. During the 2011 NBA draft the Bobcats sent Jackson, Shaun Livingston, and the 19th pick to Milwaukee and received Corey Maggette and the 7th pick in return. The Bobcats used that pick to draft Bismack Biyombo and with their 9th pick drafted Connecticut&#x27;s Kemba Walker, the NCAA basketball tournament Most Outstanding Player.

In the lockout-shortened 2011â12 season, Charlotte lost often, including their last 23 games. During their season finale against the New York Knicks, the Bobcats recorded yet another loss as their win percentage dropped to .106, setting a new record for the worst season ever by an NBA team (as this season was shortened by the lockout, the 1972â73 Philadelphia 76ers still hold the record for most losses in a season with 73). Overall, the team&#x27;s record was 7â59. On April 30, 2012, the Bobcats announced that Silas would not return as head coach. St. John&#x27;s assistant Mike Dunlap was named as his successor.

Despite finishing the season with the worst record in NBA history, the Bobcats received the second overall pick. With the second pick in the 2012 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected Michael Kidd-Gilchrist and selected Jeffery Taylor with the 31st pick. They also added Ben Gordon, Ramon Sessions and Brendan Haywood in free agency. The Bobcats won their first game against the Pacers, snapping their 23-game losing streak. The team seemed to rebound with a 7â5 start to the season. However, they promptly went on an 18-game losing streak from which they never recovered, snapping the streak with a win at Chicago. Charlotte finished 21â61, the second-worst record in the league. Dunlap was fired on April 23, reportedly because the players were turned off by his heavy-handed coaching style. He would be replaced by former Los Angeles Lakers assistant head coach Steve Clifford.

During the 2013 NBA draft, the Bobcats selected power forward/center Cody Zeller 4th overall. The Bobcats would also obtain former Utah Jazz center Al Jefferson in free agency. In February 2014, the team received Gary Neal and Luke Ridnour in a trade with the Bucks. The new players and coaching staff worked as the Bobcats clinched a playoff berth for the second time in franchise history by beating Cleveland on the road. Charlotte finished the regular season 43â39. However, the Bobcats were swept in four games by defending champion Miami in the first round.

===2014â2020: Rise of Kemba Walker===

====Return of the Hornets====
On May 21, 2013, Jordan officially announced the organization had submitted an application to change the name of the franchise to the Charlotte Hornets for the 2014â15 NBA season, pending a majority vote for approval by the NBA Board of Governors at a meeting in Las Vegas on July 18, 2013. The NBA announced, on July 18, 2013, that it had unanimously approved the rebranding, which would begin upon the conclusion of the 2013â14 season.

The Bobcats announced on November 22, they would adopt a modified version of the original Hornets&#x27; teal-purple-white color palette, with black, gray and Carolina blue as accents. The team officially unveiled its future logo and identity scheme during halftime of their December 21 game against the Jazz. The team also started the &quot;Buzz City&quot; campaign to hype up the Hornets return. On January 16, 2014, the Bobcats revealed new Hornets shirts, hats and gear.

On May 20, 2014, the Bobcats officially became the second incarnation of the Charlotte Hornets. At a press conference regarding the change, team officials also announced that as part of a deal with the NBA and the renamed New Orleans Pelicans, Charlotte acquired the history and records of the 1988â2002 Hornets (in a move similar to that of the National Football League&#x27;s Cleveland Browns return to the league in 1999), while all of the Hornets&#x27; records during their time in New Orleans from 2002 to 2013 remained with the Pelicans. The Hornets are now retconned as having suspended operations from 2002 to 2004, while the Pelicans are considered a 2002 expansion team. Charlotte had already been using past footage of the original Hornets as part of the &quot;Buzz City&quot; campaign.

====2014â2019: Playoffs and struggles====
In the 2014 NBA draft, the Hornets had the 9th overall pick from an earlier trade with the Detroit Pistons, which they used to select Noah Vonleh from Indiana. In the same draft they acquired UConn Husky Shabazz Napier, Dwight Powell from Stanford, and Semaj Christon from Xavier in the second round. They later traded Napier to the Heat for P. J. Hairston (formerly from UNC), the rights to the 55th pick, Miami&#x27;s 2019 second-round pick and cash considerations. The team also picked up Scotty Hopson (whom they would trade to New Orleans) and cash considerations in free agency.

During their first year of free agency as the Hornets, the team signed former Pacers shooting guard Lance Stephenson. The Hornets also signed former Jazz and Atlanta Hawks forward Marvin Williams to a two-year deal. A mostly difficult year led to a 33â49 record overall and a 4th-place finish in the division. Stephenson was traded to the Los Angeles Clippers for Spencer Hawes and Matt Barnes who was later traded to the Memphis Grizzlies for Courtney Lee.

The following year, the team improved to 48â34 overall, following the acquisition of players such as Nicolas Batum, Jeremy Lamb, and Jeremy Lin. It was the best season in franchise history since the original Hornets era. Charlotte returned to the playoffs, where they lost to the Heat in seven games in the first round. Along the way, they defeated the Heat twice at Time Warner Cable Arena, the franchise&#x27;s first playoff wins since the original Hornets era.

In the off-season, Jeremy Lin would go to sign with the Brooklyn Nets, Al Jefferson to the Indiana Pacers, and Courtney Lee to the New York Knicks, but the Hornets were able to re-sign Nicolas Batum and Marvin Williams, as well as bring in former All-star Roy Hibbert, Marco Belinelli and Ramon Sessions for a second stint. Hibbert would be traded mid-season to the Milwaukee Bucks with Spencer Hawes for center Miles Plumlee. Kemba Walker was named an Eastern Conference All-star as a reserve, the first all-star game of his career. The Hornets would finish the season with a 36â46 record, missing out on the playoffs.

The Hornets had a successful 2017 off-season. They shipped Plumlee and Belinelli and the 41st pick in the 2017 NBA draft to the Atlanta Hawks for former All-star Dwight Howard and the 31st pick in the 2017 draft. The trade reunited Howard with head coach Steve Clifford, both of whom worked together during Howard&#x27;s time in Orlando and Los Angeles. In the draft, Charlotte selected Malik Monk with the 11th overall pick, as well as Frank Jackson with the 31st pick. They then sent Jackson to New Orleans for cash considerations and swing-man Dwayne Bacon who was drafted 40th overall. Sessions signed with the New York Knicks, and, to replace the backup guard, they brought in former rookie of the year Michael Carter-Williams from the Chicago Bulls.

In the 2017â18 season Kemba Walker was selected for his second NBA All-Star appearance and passed Dell Curry for most three-pointers and the all-time leading scorer. At the end of the 2017â18 season, the Hornets did not renew the contract of general manager Rich Cho. In April 2018, Mitch Kupchak was named as the new president of basketball operations and general manager. On April 13, 2018, the Hornets fired head coach Steve Clifford after five seasons, who coached the team to a 196â214 record total, and named James Borrego as his replacement on May 10.

On July 23, 2018, Tony Parker, who spent the previous 17 years of his career with the San Antonio Spurs, signed with the Hornets. In January 2019 Kemba Walker was named an All-Star Game starter for the Eastern Conference, his first starting role in an All-Star Game, and matched only Glen Rice for his third All-Star Game appearance in his Hornets career. During the 2018â19 season, Charlotte finished the season with a 39â43 record finishing 2nd in the division and 9th in the Eastern Conference.

On June 20, 2019, the Hornets selected P. J. Washington with the twelfth overall pick in the 2019 NBA draft.

On July 6, 2019, Kemba Walker joined the Boston Celtics through a sign-and-trade deal with the Hornets.

===2020âpresent: The LaMelo Ball era===

On November 18, 2020, the Hornets selected LaMelo Ball with the third overall pick. The Hornets also drafted Vernon Carey Jr. and Grant Riller in the second round of the 2020 NBA draft. On November 29, 2020, the Hornets would acquire Gordon Hayward in a sign-and-trade deal with the Boston Celtics. The Hornets finished the 2020â21 season 10th in the East with a 33â39 overall record. On June 16, 2021, Ball was named 2020â21 NBA Rookie of the Year, becoming the third player in franchise history to win the award.

On February 7, 2022, Ball was named to his first NBA All-Star Game as an injury replacement for Kevin Durant. The Hornets would clinch a spot in the play-in tournament for the second consecutive time although losing to fellow Southeast division foe the Atlanta Hawks 132â103. On April 22, 2022, the Hornets fired head coach James Borrego after four seasons with the team. The team finished the 2021â2022 season with a 43â39 overall record.

On June 24, 2022, the Hornets named Steve Clifford as new head coach marking his second stint as the team&#x27;s head coach. During the off-season, notable additions included drafting Duke center Mark Williams with the 15th pick of the 2022 NBA draft and the free agent signing of point guard and North Carolina native Dennis Smith Jr.

During the 2022â23 NBA season, the Hornets endured injuries to a majority of the roster, leading to a poor season which ended with a 27â55 record, the fourth worst in the league. Lamelo Ball only played 36 games. However, Mark Williams proved his immense potential.

Courtesy of their poor finish, the Hornets won the second overall pick which they used to select Brandon Miller in the 2023 NBA draft.

On June 16, 2023, Jordan announced he was selling his majority stake in the team to a group led by Gabe Plotkin and Rick Schnall. The transaction, sold at $3 billion, was approved by the NBA on July 23, 2023.

On April 3, 2024 Steve Clifford announced he would step into an advisor role following a 21â61 season. He finished as the Hornets all time win leader. On May 9, 2024, Celtics assistant Charles Lee was announced as his successor, receiving a 4-year deal.

Brandon Miller had a successful rookie season, averaging 17 points per game and finishing third in Rookie of the Year voting despite a strong rookie class. Lamelo Ball once again struggled with injury, only playing 22 games. Mark Williams also only played 19 games on the season.Terry Rozier was dealt to Miami at the trade deadline for a pick and veteran guard Kyle Lowry. Another addition was Grant Williams from the Dallas Mavericks, acquired in a trade for PJ Washington. Gordon Hayward was also dealt away. After the season, former player Kemba Walker was hired to be a player enhancement coach. 

==Logos and uniforms==
===Logos===
The Hornets&#x27; first logo was a teal and purple anthropomorphic hornet wearing white shoes and gloves dribbling an orange basketball. The words &#x27;Charlotte Hornets&#x27; were in teal and curved across the top and bottom of the logo. An alternate logo, used only for the 1988â89 season, featured a large teal letter &#x27;C&#x27;, with &#x27;Charlotte&#x27; in black letters curved upwards underneath. Inside the &#x27;C&#x27; was a smaller white letter &#x27;H&#x27; outlined in teal, with a black-colored hornet holding a basketball from birds-eye view placed in the center.

The Bobcats&#x27; primary logo from 2004 to 2012 consisted of a snarling orange bobcat facing to the right with the indented name &#x27;Bobcats&#x27; above in silver on a blue background, with &#x27;Charlotte&#x27; (also indented) appearing above it in the same blue color. A change to a less vibrant orange and blue, while retaining the same look, was made in 2007. Further color changes in 2012 made the bobcat gray, extended the blue background up to the &#x27;Charlotte&#x27; name, which changed from blue to orange. A Carolina blue outline around the entire logo was also added. In 2007 the Bobcats unveiled a secondary logo, consisting of a snarling bobcat head facing forward with one side shaded orange, and the other blue. A silver basketball was placed behind the right of the head, all encased in an orange-blue-gray circle. During the 2012 rebranding, the colors were changed, with gray and Carolina blue replacing orange on the head and circle outline, respectively, and the basketball changing to orange. This logo would become prominent in the team&#x27;s marketing and be featured at center court from 2007â08 until 2013â14.

Charlotte&#x27;s second Hornets logo features a teal and purple forward-facing hornet with the words &#x27;Charlotte Hornets&#x27; on its torso. Wings sprout up above the head on both left and right, with teal and purple details. The hornet&#x27;s stinger is prominently featured; a basketball pattern is above the stinger. Gray fully outlines the logo.
Among the team&#x27;s different secondary logos includes a hornet facing to the side, its teal and purple body arched in a &#x27;C&#x27; shape representing the city of Charlotte, and a modified version of the Hornets original logo (sans the basketball) as the official mascot logo.

===Uniforms===

====Original Hornets====
The original Hornets uniforms were designed by international designer and North Carolina native Alexander Julian. The team chose teal and purple as its primary colors and featured a first for NBA uniformsâpinstripes. While most teams feature team names on home jerseys and their home city on away jerseys, the Hornets&#x27; uniforms had &quot;Charlotte&quot; on both home and away jerseys. Home uniforms were white with pinstripes in teal, green, blue and purple, while the away jerseys were teal with pinstripes in white, green, blue and purple.

In 1994, the Hornets unveiled a purple alternate uniform, with pinstripes in white, green, blue and teal. Likewise, Hugo was featured in the beltline.

From 1997 to 2002, the Hornets made slight changes to their uniforms. Hugo was moved from the beltline to the left leg, while side stripes with pinstripes were added, in purple (away) and teal (home) colors. A tricolor featuring teal, purple and blue was featured on the beltline and the piping.

====Bobcats====

The Bobcats&#x27; first home jerseys were white, reading &quot;Bobcats&quot; in orange with blue and black trimming. The primary away jersey was orange reading &quot;Charlotte&quot; in white with blue and black trimming. In the 2006 off-season, the Bobcats announced a new alternate away jersey which debuted during the 2006â07 season. The alternate jersey is blue, with the name &quot;Bobcats&quot; in white with black, orange and white trimming. Racing Day blue alternates (with an arched &#x27;Charlotte&#x27;, checkered flag side stripes, and centered numbers) were used to honor Charlotte&#x27;s NASCAR fanbase.

For the 2009â10 season, the Bobcats sported redesigned uniforms, having a mixture of characteristics from both Hornets and Bobcats uniforms. The home uniforms were white and featured an arched &quot;Bobcats&quot; in blue with orange and white trim. Road uniforms were blue and featured an arched &quot;Charlotte&quot; in white with blue and orange trim. Both designs featured silver pinstripes, similar to what the Hornets wore. The NASCAR uniform was also updated to include the pinstripes. For the 2011â12 season, however, the Bobcats wore their home uniforms on NASCAR night, complete with a racing flag patch.

The Bobcats unveiled Hardwood Classics uniforms honoring the American Basketball Association (ABA)&#x27;s Carolina Cougars, which the team wore for select games in 2012.

The Bobcats unveiled new uniforms on June 19, 2012, their second and final change in five years. Overall, they featured less emphasis on orange. The white home uniforms sported the shorter nickname &#x27;Cats&#x27; in navy and Carolina blue trim, while the numbers were in Carolina blue and navy trim, with navy side stripes. The navy away uniforms featured &#x27;Charlotte&#x27; in white and Carolina blue trim, with the numbers featured the same trim as the city name, with Carolina blue side stripes. In both uniforms, the pinstripes were relegated to the sides. The uniforms bore a close resemblance to the Dallas Mavericks uniforms. The addition of Carolina blue was seen as way to connect owner Michael Jordan&#x27;s collegiate roots, while the formal adoption of &#x27;Cats&#x27; for marketing purposes reflected a popular nickname.
====Revived Hornets====
The newly renamed Hornets unveiled the team&#x27;s uniforms on June 19, 2014, consisting of white home and purple road uniforms with the &quot;Hornets&quot; wordmark across the chest. The team also unveiled a teal alternate uniform with the &quot;Charlotte&quot; wordmark across the chest. The teal uniform is planned to be used as an alternate uniform for either home or road games and worn a total of 16â20 times per season.

On June 25, 2015, the Hornets unveiled a black sleeved alternate uniform, featuring their &quot;Buzz City&quot; nickname in front. The team wore the uniform for as many as six games during the 2015â16 NBA season. It was also worn during select games of the 2016 NBA playoffs.

For the 2017â18 season and beyond, the Hornets have been outfitted by Nike&#x27;s Air Jordan brand endorsed by franchise owner Michael Jordan. The white &quot;Association&quot; uniform and the teal &quot;Icon&quot; uniform feature the &quot;Hornets&quot; wordmark in front and the silhouetted hornet on the waistband. The purple &quot;Statement&quot; uniform is similar to the &quot;Icon&quot; and &quot;Association&quot; uniforms, but feature the &quot;Charlotte&quot; wordmark in front.

The Hornets revamped their purple &quot;Statement&quot; uniforms prior to the 2019â20 season. The front of the uniform featured the &quot;CHA&quot; acronym in bold white letters with teal trim, while teal &quot;stinger&quot; stripes accentuate the sides. The silhouetted Hornets logo was moved to the sides of the shorts while the partial logo was placed on the beltline.

On August 31, 2020, the Hornets unveiled new uniforms that include double pinstriped jerseys that pay homage to the jerseys worn from 1997 until 2002. These are the first Hornets regular jerseys to include pinstripes since they wore them as the Bobcats from 2009 to 2012.

Before the 2022â23 season, the Hornets again made slight changes to the purple &quot;Statement&quot; uniform. The uniform brought back the &quot;Hornets&quot; wordmark in front along with white numbers and teal cell accents on each side. The &quot;C&quot; alternate logo was added on the beltline and the alternate &quot;curled hornet&quot; logo was placed below the teal cells on the shorts.

The Hornets&#x27; &quot;City&quot; uniforms were slight updates of Adidas&#x27; sleeved &quot;Buzz City&quot; uniforms. The 2017â18 version featured black letters with white trim on a black base and the sides featured a wing pattern of a hornet. The 2018â19 version was slightly tweaked to feature teal lettering and a new logo reminiscent of the original Air Jordan &quot;Wings&quot; logo.

The &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2019â20 season moved away from the &quot;Buzz City&quot; concept and went with a cool grey base, purple, teal and black piping, &quot;CHA&quot; acronym in purple and white numbers with purple trim. A cell pattern adorned the sides.

Charlotte&#x27;s &quot;City&quot; uniform for the 2020â21 season paid homage to the city&#x27;s history as the first to house a U.S. Branch Mint and the Carolina Gold Rush. The base color is mint and letters and numbers are in granite black with metallic gold trim. Pinstripes are in gold. It also brought back the &quot;Buzz City&quot; crest in front. This theme was then revisited in their 2022â23 &quot;City&quot; uniform, this in granite black with &quot;CLT&quot; (Charlotte&#x27;s main abbreviation) in gold with mint trim. Pinstripes alternate between gold and mint.

For the 2021â22 season, the Hornets&#x27; &quot;City&quot; uniform visually mixed various elements from previous identities. The cursive &quot;Charlotte&quot; wordmark was inspired by the banners displayed during the franchise&#x27;s 1988 uniform unveiling. The number placement on the left chest was reminiscent of the Bobcats&#x27; original uniforms. The purple cells recalled the court design used at the Charlotte Coliseum, and the teal gradient contained pinstripes, reminiscent of the uniforms worn from 1988 to 1997. The original &quot;Hugo&quot; logo was placed on the left leg, and the script &quot;Hornets&quot; wordmark was added to the right leg. Along the jock tag the Hornets added the &quot;EST. 1988&quot; sign acknowledging the team&#x27;s inaugural year.

In the 2023â24 season, the Hornets mixed both the &quot;Buzz City&quot; and Charlotte Mint themes for their &quot;City&quot; uniform. The design is a teal base with gold trim and mint side panels, with &quot;Buzz City&quot; in white with gold trim emblazoned in front. The mint theme was revisited anew in the 2024â25 &quot;City&quot; uniform, this time using the white &quot;Association&quot; uniform as the basis of the design.

The &quot;Classic&quot; edition featured a revival of the original Hornets pinstriped uniforms in the current Nike template. The teal version was used in the 2017â18 season, followed by a white version in 2018â19, complete with an alternate court marking the 30th anniversary of NBA basketball in Charlotte. For 2019â20, the Hornets wore purple versions of the pinstriped uniforms to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the uniform&#x27;s unveiling. For the 35th anniversary season in 2023â24, the Hornets wore the throwback double pinstriped teal uniforms with purple side stripes, which they wore from 1997 to 2002. However, the Classic Edition court was not used with the uniform.

==Arenas==
* Charlotte Coliseum (1988â2002, 2004â2005)
* Spectrum Center (2005âpresent) 

The Hornets played their first 15 seasons at the Charlotte Coliseum, which was called &quot;The Hive&quot; by fans. With over 23,000 seats, it was (and still remains) the largest basketball-specific venue in the league by seating capacity. The Coliseum hosted 371 consecutive NBA sell-outs (including seven playoff games) from December 1988 to November 1997. The Hornets would go on to lead the NBA in attendance in eight of its first nine seasons. When Charlotte returned to the NBA as the Bobcats, they temporarily played in the Coliseum in the 2004â05 season while their new arena (the Charlotte Bobcats Arena) was being built. After its completion, the city closed the old Coliseum in the 2005 off-season and opened the new arena with a Rolling Stones concert.
In April 2008, the Bobcats reached a naming rights deal with Time Warner Cable, North Carolina&#x27;s largest cable television provider. In exchange for the naming rights, Time Warner agreed to tear up the cable television deal that had limited the Bobcats&#x27; exposure over the team&#x27;s first four years (see below). When the Hornets returned to Charlotte, &quot;The Hive&quot; nickname also returned to the arena. In August 2016, the arena was renamed the Spectrum Center after Time Warner&#x27;s merger with Charter Communications and its Spectrum consumer/business branding.

The Hornets practice at the Novant Health Training Center, located within the Spectrum Center. Previously the team practiced at the Grady Cole Center in the Elizabeth neighborhood before moving to a purpose-built facility in Fort Mill, South Carolina located beside Knights Castle; this facility is now known as The Pointe Arts and Recreation Center.

===Basketball Hall of Famers===
===FIBA Hall of Famers===
==Mascot and cheerleaders==

Hugo The Hornet is the current mascot of the franchise. Shortly after the news that Charlotte would get the Hornets name back, at halftime of a December 21, 2013, game between Charlotte and the Utah Jazz, Hugo was announced to return as the Charlotte Hornets&#x27; new mascot for the 2014â15 NBA season.

From 2004 to 2014, Rufus D. Lynx was the mascot of the Bobcats. He first appeared on November 1, 2003, according to his official bio on the Bobcats&#x27; website. The name comes from the scientific name of the bobcat, which is &quot;Lynx rufus&quot;. During the 2012 NBA All-Star Jam Session, Rufus D. Lynx broke a world record along with Coyote, Grizz, Hooper, and Sly the Silver Fox for most &quot;between the legs&quot; basketball dunks. Bleacher Report ranked Rufus as the 8th best mascot in the NBA. Rufus D. Lynx is featured in &quot;NBA Jam 2010&quot;. Rufus D. Lynx was officially retired following the conclusion of the 2013â14 NBA season, and the Hornets made him a farewell video in May 2014. The updated Hugo was unveiled on an around the city tour on June 5, 2014.

The Hornets have an official cheerleading squad known as the Charlotte Honey Bees. The Honey Bees perform sideline dances as well as center-court dances during games. They also represent the Hornets brand as ambassadors to the community and are involved in community service activities and charity functions. When the team was known as the Bobcats, the cheerleaders were called the Lady Cats.

==Media coverage==

From 1988 to 1992, the Hornets aired most road games, and occasional home games, on a network of stations in North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia fronted by WCCB in Charlotte. WCCB&#x27;s longtime owner, Cy Bahakel, was a minority partner in the Hornets&#x27; original ownership group. Starting with the 1990â91 season, several games also aired on the original SportSouth, forerunner of Bally Sports South, for customers in North and South Carolina. WJZY became the Hornets&#x27; over-the-air flagship in 1992, and remained as such until 1998. From 1995 to 1998, some games aired on WJZY&#x27;s sister station, WFVT-TV (now WMYT-TV). WAXN-TV became the flagship for the 1998â99 season, and remained as such until the original team departed in 2002. Generally, most home games slated for telecast aired on SportSouth/Fox Sports South.

When the team returned as the Bobcats in 2004, Johnson partnered with Time Warner to create Carolinas Sports Entertainment Television (C-SET), a regional sports network. It aired 60 Bobcats games that also aired on Comporium Cable in the South Carolina portion of the Charlotte market. However, Time Warner placed C-SET on its digital package as an incentive to try to get customers to switch to its digital service, leaving analog customers in the dark. It also refused to allow DirecTV or Dish Network to pick up C-SET on their local feeds. As a result, Time Warner customers without digital cable, as well as western North Carolina and most of South Carolina, were left to rely on radio coverage.

C-SET folded on the day of the 2005 NBA draft, and most games then moved to News 14 Carolina, a cable news channel available on Time Warner Cable&#x27;s systems in Charlotte, the Triad and the Triangle. However, this still left viewers in most of South Carolina (except for the South Carolina side of the Charlotte area, which saw games on Comporium) as well as eastern and western North Carolina, out in the cold. News 14 was also not available on satellite.

As part of the Time Warner Cable Arena deal, the Bobcats signed over broadcasting rights to Fox Sports South. Starting with the last five games of the 2007â08 season, about 70 games per season were shown on Fox Sports Carolinas (Fox Sports South&#x27;s new regional feed, now reintegrated to Bally Sports South) and sister network Sportsouth (renamed Fox Sports Southeast in 2015 and later Bally Sports Southeast in 2021) in North and South Carolina. The deal is believed to be the first simultaneous naming rights and broadcast rights deal in the history of North American professional sports. As of the 2020â21 season, Hornets games are carried by Bally Sports Southeast with Eric Collins and Dell Curry, along with in-game reporter and &quot;Hornets Live&quot; host Shannon Spake. Former personnel include: Stephanie Ready, who worked as a sideline reporter and in-game analyst for the Hornets for a decade before moving to Turner Sports in 2018, and long time Hornets broadcaster Steve Martin, who retired after the 2017â18 season.

For the team&#x27;s first four seasons after their return to the league, select games also aired on a network of over-the-air stations across North Carolina, South Carolina and Virginia, fronted by WJZY from 2004 to 2006 and WMYT from 2006 to 2008.

The team&#x27;s radio flagship is all-sports station WFNZ-FM. Before 2010, games had aired on WOLS. WOLS switched its non-sports programming from oldies to Spanish language on January 1, 2009, making Bobcats and Duke basketball the station&#x27;s only non-Spanish language programming. WBT was the Hornets&#x27; radio flagship during the original franchise&#x27;s entire run.

<text>In social psychology, propinquity (; from Latin &quot;propinquitas&quot;, &quot;nearness&quot;) is one of the main factors leading to interpersonal attraction.

It refers to the physical or psychological proximity between people. Propinquity can mean physical proximity, a kinship between people, or a similarity in nature between things (&quot;like-attracts-like&quot;). Two people living on the same floor of a building, for example, have a higher propinquity than those living on different floors, just as two people with similar political beliefs possess a higher propinquity than those whose beliefs strongly differ. &quot;Propinquity&quot; is also one of the factors, set out by Jeremy Bentham, used to measure the amount of (utilitarian) pleasure in a method known as felicific calculus.
==Propinquity effect==
The propinquity effect is the tendency for people to form friendships or romantic relationships with those whom they encounter often, forming a bond between subject and friend. Workplace interactions are frequent and this frequent interaction is often a key indicator as to why close relationships can readily form in this type of environment. In other words, relationships tend to form between those who have a high propinquity. It was first theorized by psychologists Leon Festinger, Stanley Schachter, and Kurt Back in what came to be called the &quot;Westgate studies&quot; conducted at MIT (1950). The typical Euler diagram used to represent the propinquity effect is shown below where U = universe, A = set A, B = set B, and S = similarity:
The sets are basically any relevant subject matter about a person, persons, or non-persons, depending on the context. Propinquity can be more than just physical distance. Residents of an apartment building living near one of the building&#x27;s stairways, for example, tend to have more friends from other floors than those living further from the stairway. The propinquity effect is usually explained by the mere exposure effect, which holds that the more exposure a stimulus gets, the more likeable it becomes. There is a requirement for the mere exposure effect to influence the propinquity effect, and that is that the exposure is positive. If the resident has repeatedly negative experiences with a person then the propinquity effect has a far less chance of happening (Norton, Frost, &amp; Ariely, 2007).

In a study on interpersonal attraction (Piercey and Piercey, 1972), 23 graduate psychology students, all from the same class, underwent 9 hours of sensitivity training in two groups. Students were given pre- and post-tests to rate their positive and negative attitudes toward each class member. Members of the same sensitivity training group rated each other higher in the post-test than they rated members of the other group in both the pre- and post-test, and members of their own group in the pre-test. The results indicated that the 9 hours of sensitivity training increased the exposure of students in the same group to each other, and thus they became more likeable to each other.

Propinquity is one of the effects used to study group dynamics. For example, there was a British study done on immigrant Irish women to observe how they interacted with their new environments (Ryan, 2007). This study showed that there were certain people with whom these women became friends much more easily than others, such as classmates, workplace colleagues, and neighbours as a result of shared interests, common situations, and constant interaction. For women who still felt out of place when they began life in a new place, giving birth to children allowed for different ties to be formed, ones with other mothers. Having slightly older children participating in activities such as school clubs and teams also allowed social networks to widen, giving the women a stronger support base, emotional or otherwise.

==Types==
Various types of propinquity exist: &quot;industry/occupational propinquity&quot;, in which similar people working in the same field or job tend to be attracted to one another; &quot;residential propinquity&quot;, in which people living in the same area or within neighborhoods of each other tend to come together; and &quot;acquaintance propinquity&quot;, a form of proximity in existence when friends tend to have a special bond of interpersonal attraction. Many studies have been performed in assessing various propinquities and their effect on marriage.

==Virtual propinquity==
The introduction of instant messaging and video conferencing has reduced the effects of propinquity. Online interactions have facilitated instant and close interactions with people despite a lack of material presence. This allows a notional &quot;virtual propinquity&quot; to work on virtual relationships where people are connected virtually. However, research that came after the development of the internet and email has shown that physical distance is still a powerful predictor of contact, interaction, friendship, and influence.

==In popular culture==
William Shakespeare&#x27;s 
&quot;King Lear&quot;, Act 1 Scene 1 Page 5 
&lt;poem&gt;LEAR:
&#x27;Let it be so. Thy truth then be thy dower.
For by the sacred radiance of the sun,
The mysteries of Hecate and the night,
By all the operation of the orbs
From whom we do exist and cease to beâ
Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
Propinquity, and property of blood,
And as a stranger to my heart and me
Hold thee from this for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
Or he that makes his generation messes
To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
Be as well neighbored, pitied, and relieved
As thou my sometime daughter.&#x27;&lt;/poem&gt;

&quot;Love is a Science&quot;, a 1959 short story by humorist Max Shulman, features a girl named Zelda Gilroy assuring her science lab tablemate, Dobie Gillis, that he would eventually come to love her through the influence of propinquity, as their similar last names would put them in proximity throughout school. &quot;Love is a Science&quot; was adapted into a 1959 episode of the Shulman-created TV sitcom &quot;The Many Loves of Dobie Gillis&quot;, featuring Dobie as its main character and Zelda as a semi-regular, and a 1988 made-for-TV movie based on the series, &quot;Bring Me the Head of Dobie Gillis&quot;, portrayed Dobie and Zelda as being married.

&quot;Propinquity (I&#x27;ve Just Begun To Care)&quot; is a song by Mike Nesmith. It was first recorded by Nesmith in 1968 while he was with The Monkees, though this version was not released until the 1990s. The first released version was by the Nitty Gritty Dirt Band on their album Uncle Charlie &amp; His Dog Teddy, and Nesmith released a new version on his solo album Nevada Fighter.

On page 478 of Jonathan Franzen&#x27;s 2010 novel &quot;Freedom&quot;, Walter attributes his inability to stop having sex with Lalitha to their &quot;daily propinquity&quot;.

On page 150 in Michael Ondaatje&#x27;s novel &quot;The English Patient&quot;, &quot;He said later it was propinquity. Propinquity in the desert. It does that here, he said. He loved the word â the propinquity of water, the propinquity of two or three bodies in a car driving the Sand Sea for six hours.&quot; 

In Ian Fleming&#x27;s 1957 James Bond novel &quot;Diamonds Are Forever&quot;, Felix Leiter tells Bond &quot;Nothing propinks like propinquity.&quot;

In William Faulkner&#x27;s 1936 novel &quot;Absalom, Absalom!&quot;, Rosa, in explaining to Quentin why she agreed to marry Sutpen, states, &quot;I don&#x27;t plead propinquity: the fact that I, a woman young and at the age for marrying and in a time when most of the young men whom I would have known ordinarily were dead on lost battlefields, that I lived for two years under the same roof with him.&quot;

In Ryan North&#x27;s webcomic &quot;Dinosaur Comics&quot;, T-Rex discusses propinquity.

In the P. G. Wodehouse novel &quot;Right Ho, Jeeves&quot;, Bertie asks, &quot;What do you call it when two people of opposite sexes are bunged together in close association in a secluded spot meeting each other every day and seeing a lot of each other?&quot; to which Jeeves replies, &quot;Is &#x27;propinquity&#x27; the word you wish, sir?&quot; Bertie: &quot;It is. I stake everything on propinquity, Jeeves.&quot;

In Ernest Thompson Seton&#x27;s short story &quot;Arnaux: the Chronicle of a Homing Pigeon,&quot; published in &quot;Animal Heroes&quot; (1905): &quot;Pigeon marriages are arranged somewhat like those of mankind. Propinquity is the first thing: force the pair together for a time and let nature take its course.&quot;

<doc id="243391" wikidata="Q9081" url="?curid=243391" title="Knowledge">
<text>Knowledge is an awareness of facts, a familiarity with individuals and situations, or a practical skill. Knowledge of facts, also called propositional knowledge, is often characterized as true belief that is distinct from opinion or guesswork by virtue of justification. While there is wide agreement among philosophers that propositional knowledge is a form of true belief, many controversies focus on justification. This includes questions like how to understand justification, whether it is needed at all, and whether something else besides it is needed. These controversies intensified in the latter half of the 20th century due to a series of thought experiments called &quot;Gettier cases&quot; that provoked alternative definitions.

Knowledge can be produced in many ways. The main source of empirical knowledge is perception, which involves the usage of the senses to learn about the external world. Introspection allows people to learn about their internal mental states and processes. Other sources of knowledge include memory, rational intuition, inference, and testimony. According to foundationalism, some of these sources are basic in that they can justify beliefs, without depending on other mental states. Coherentists reject this claim and contend that a sufficient degree of coherence among all the mental states of the believer is necessary for knowledge. According to infinitism, an infinite chain of beliefs is needed.

The main discipline investigating knowledge is epistemology, which studies what people know, how they come to know it, and what it means to know something. It discusses the value of knowledge and the thesis of philosophical skepticism, which questions the possibility of knowledge. Knowledge is relevant to many fields like the sciences, which aim to acquire knowledge using the scientific method based on repeatable experimentation, observation, and measurement. Various religions hold that humans should seek knowledge and that God or the divine is the source of knowledge. The anthropology of knowledge studies how knowledge is acquired, stored, retrieved, and communicated in different cultures. The sociology of knowledge examines under what sociohistorical circumstances knowledge arises, and what sociological consequences it has. The history of knowledge investigates how knowledge in different fields has developed, and evolved, in the course of history.

== Definitions ==
Knowledge is a form of familiarity, awareness, understanding, or acquaintance. It often involves the possession of information learned through experience and can be understood as a cognitive success or an epistemic contact with reality, like making a discovery. Many academic definitions focus on propositional knowledge in the form of believing certain facts, as in &quot;I know that Dave is at home&quot;. Other types of knowledge include knowledge-how in the form of practical competence, as in &quot;she knows how to swim&quot;, and knowledge by acquaintance as a familiarity with the known object based on previous direct experience, like knowing someone personally.

Knowledge is often understood as a state of an individual person, but it can also refer to a characteristic of a group of people as group knowledge, social knowledge, or collective knowledge. Some social sciences understand knowledge as a broad social phenomenon that is similar to culture. The term may further denote knowledge stored in documents like the &quot;knowledge housed in the library&quot; or the knowledge base of an expert system. Knowledge is closely related to intelligence, but intelligence is more about the ability to acquire, process, and apply information, while knowledge concerns information and skills that a person already possesses.

The word &quot;knowledge&quot; has its roots in the 12th-century Old English word , which comes from the Old High German word . The English word includes various meanings that some other languages distinguish using several words. In ancient Greek, for example, four important terms for knowledge were used: &quot;epistÄmÄ&quot; (unchanging theoretical knowledge), &quot;technÄ&quot; (expert technical knowledge), &quot;mÄtis&quot; (strategic knowledge), and &quot;gnÅsis&quot; (personal intellectual knowledge). The main discipline studying knowledge is called epistemology or the theory of knowledge. It examines the nature of knowledge and justification, how knowledge arises, and what value it has. Further topics include the different types of knowledge and the limits of what can be known.

Despite agreements about the general characteristics of knowledge, its exact definition is disputed. Some definitions only focus on the most salient features of knowledge to give a practically useful characterization. Another approach, termed &quot;analysis of knowledge&quot;, tries to provide a theoretically precise definition by listing the conditions that are individually necessary and jointly sufficient, similar to how chemists analyze a sample by seeking a list of all the chemical elements composing it. According to a different view, knowledge is a unique state that cannot be analyzed in terms of other phenomena. Some scholars base their definition on abstract intuitions while others focus on concrete cases or rely on how the term is used in ordinary language. There is also disagreement about whether knowledge is a rare phenomenon that requires high standards or a common phenomenon found in many everyday situations.

=== Analysis of knowledge ===
An often-discussed definition characterizes knowledge as justified true belief. This definition identifies three essential features: it is (1) a belief that is (2) true and (3) justified. Truth is a widely accepted feature of knowledge. It implies that, while it may be possible to believe something false, one cannot know something false. That knowledge is a form of belief implies that one cannot know something if one does not believe it. Some everyday expressions seem to violate this principle, like the claim that &quot;I do not believe it, I know it!&quot; But the point of such expressions is usually to emphasize one&#x27;s confidence rather than denying that a belief is involved.

The main controversy surrounding this definition concerns its third feature: justification. This component is often included because of the impression that some true beliefs are not forms of knowledge, such as beliefs based on superstition, lucky guesses, or erroneous reasoning. For example, a person who guesses that a coin flip will land heads usually does not know that even if their belief turns out to be true. This indicates that there is more to knowledge than just being right about something. These cases are excluded by requiring that beliefs have justification for them to count as knowledge. Some philosophers hold that a belief is justified if it is based on evidence, which can take the form of mental states like experience, memory, and other beliefs. Others state that beliefs are justified if they are produced by reliable processes, like sensory perception or logical reasoning.
The definition of knowledge as justified true belief came under severe criticism in the 20th century, when epistemologist Edmund Gettier formulated a series of counterexamples. They purport to present concrete cases of justified true beliefs that fail to constitute knowledge. The reason for their failure is usually a form of epistemic luck: the beliefs are justified but their justification is not relevant to the truth. In a well-known example, someone drives along a country road with many barn facades and only one real barn. The person is not aware of this, stops in front of the real barn by a lucky coincidence, and forms the justified true belief that they are in front of a barn. This example aims to establish that the person does not know that they are in front of a real barn, since they would not have been able to tell the difference. This means that it is a lucky coincidence that this justified belief is also true.

According to some philosophers, these counterexamples show that justification is not required for knowledge and that knowledge should instead be characterized in terms of reliability or the manifestation of cognitive virtues. Another approach defines knowledge in regard to the function it plays in cognitive processes as that which provides reasons for thinking or doing something. A different response accepts justification as an aspect of knowledge and include additional criteria. Many candidates have been suggested, like the requirements that the justified true belief does not depend on any false beliefs, that no defeaters are present, or that the person would not have the belief if it was false. Another view states that beliefs have to be infallible to amount to knowledge. A further approach, associated with pragmatism, focuses on the aspect of inquiry and characterizes knowledge in terms of what works as a practice that aims to produce habits of action. There is still very little consensus in the academic discourse as to which of the proposed modifications or reconceptualizations is correct, and there are various alternative definitions of knowledge.

== Types ==
A common distinction among types of knowledge is between propositional knowledge, or knowledge-that, and non-propositional knowledge in the form of practical skills or acquaintance. Other distinctions focus on how the knowledge is acquired and on the content of the known information.

=== Propositional ===

Propositional knowledge, also referred to as declarative and descriptive knowledge, is a form of theoretical knowledge about facts, like knowing that &quot;2 + 2 = 4&quot;. It is the paradigmatic type of knowledge in analytic philosophy. Propositional knowledge is &quot;propositional&quot; in the sense that it involves a relation to a proposition. Since propositions are often expressed through that-clauses, it is also referred to as &quot;knowledge-that&quot;, as in &quot;Akari knows that kangaroos hop&quot;. In this case, Akari stands in the relation of knowing to the proposition &quot;kangaroos hop&quot;. Closely related types of knowledge are &quot;know-wh&quot;, for example, &quot;knowing who&quot; is coming to dinner and &quot;knowing why&quot; they are coming. These expressions are normally understood as types of propositional knowledge since they can be paraphrased using a that-clause.

Propositional knowledge takes the form of mental representations involving concepts, ideas, theories, and general rules. These representations connect the knower to certain parts of reality by showing what they are like. They are often context-independent, meaning that they are not restricted to a specific use or purpose. Propositional knowledge encompasses both knowledge of specific facts, like that the atomic mass of gold is 196.97 u, and generalities, like that the color of leaves of some trees changes in autumn. Because of the dependence on mental representations, it is often held that the capacity for propositional knowledge is exclusive to relatively sophisticated creatures, such as humans. This is based on the claim that advanced intellectual capacities are needed to believe a proposition that expresses what the world is like.

=== Non-propositional ===

Non-propositional knowledge is knowledge in which no essential relation to a proposition is involved. The two most well-known forms are knowledge-how (know-how or procedural knowledge) and knowledge by acquaintance. To possess knowledge-how means to have some form of practical ability, skill, or competence, like knowing how to ride a bicycle or knowing how to swim. Some of the abilities responsible for knowledge-how involve forms of knowledge-that, as in knowing how to prove a mathematical theorem, but this is not generally the case. Some types of knowledge-how do not require a highly developed mind, in contrast to propositional knowledge, and are more common in the animal kingdom. For example, an ant knows how to walk even though it presumably lacks a mind sufficiently developed to represent the corresponding proposition.

Knowledge by acquaintance is familiarity with something that results from direct experiential contact. The object of knowledge can be a person, a thing, or a place. For example, by eating chocolate, one becomes acquainted with the taste of chocolate, and visiting Lake TaupÅ leads to the formation of knowledge by acquaintance of Lake TaupÅ. In these cases, the person forms non-inferential knowledge based on first-hand experience without necessarily acquiring factual information about the object. By contrast, it is also possible to indirectly learn a lot of propositional knowledge about chocolate or Lake TaupÅ by reading books without having the direct experiential contact required for knowledge by acquaintance. The concept of knowledge by acquaintance was first introduced by Bertrand Russell. He holds that knowledge by acquaintance is more basic than propositional knowledge since to understand a proposition, one has to be acquainted with its constituents.

=== &quot;A priori&quot; and &quot;a posteriori&quot; ===

The distinction between &quot;a priori&quot; and &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge depends on the role of experience in the processes of formation and justification. To know something &quot;a posteriori&quot; means to know it based on experience. For example, by seeing that it rains outside or hearing that the baby is crying, one acquires &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge of these facts. &quot;A priori&quot; knowledge is possible without any experience to justify or support the known proposition. Mathematical knowledge, such as that 2 + 2 = 4, is traditionally taken to be &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge since no empirical investigation is necessary to confirm this fact. In this regard, &quot;a posteriori&quot; knowledge is empirical knowledge while &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge is non-empirical knowledge.

The relevant experience in question is primarily identified with sensory experience. Some non-sensory experiences, like memory and introspection, are often included as well. Some conscious phenomena are excluded from the relevant experience, like rational insight. For example, conscious thought processes may be required to arrive at &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge regarding the solution of mathematical problems, like when performing mental arithmetic to multiply two numbers. The same is the case for the experience needed to learn the words through which the claim is expressed. For example, knowing that &quot;all bachelors are unmarried&quot; is &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge because no sensory experience is necessary to confirm this fact even though experience was needed to learn the meanings of the words &quot;bachelor&quot; and &quot;unmarried&quot;.

It is difficult to explain how &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge is possible and some empiricists deny it exists. It is usually seen as unproblematic that one can come to know things through experience, but it is not clear how knowledge is possible without experience. One of the earliest solutions to this problem comes from Plato, who argues that the soul already possesses the knowledge and just needs to recollect, or remember, it to access it again. A similar explanation is given by Descartes, who holds that &quot;a priori&quot; knowledge exists as innate knowledge present in the mind of each human. A further approach posits a special mental faculty responsible for this type of knowledge, often referred to as rational intuition or rational insight.

=== Others ===
Various other types of knowledge are discussed in the academic literature. In philosophy, &quot;self-knowledge&quot; refers to a person&#x27;s knowledge of their own sensations, thoughts, beliefs, and other mental states. A common view is that self-knowledge is more direct than knowledge of the external world, which relies on the interpretation of sense data. Because of this, it is traditionally claimed that self-knowledge is indubitable, like the claim that a person cannot be wrong about whether they are in pain. However, this position is not universally accepted in the contemporary discourse and an alternative view states that self-knowledge also depends on interpretations that could be false. In a slightly different sense, self-knowledge can also refer to knowledge of the self as a persisting entity with certain personality traits, preferences, physical attributes, relationships, goals, and social identities.

Metaknowledge is knowledge about knowledge. It can arise in the form of self-knowledge but includes other types as well, such as knowing what someone else knows or what information is contained in a scientific article. Other aspects of metaknowledge include knowing how knowledge can be acquired, stored, distributed, and used.

Common knowledge is knowledge that is publicly known and shared by most individuals within a community. It establishes a common ground for communication, understanding, social cohesion, and cooperation. General knowledge encompasses common knowledge but also includes knowledge that many people have been exposed to but may not be able to immediately recall. Common knowledge contrasts with domain knowledge or specialized knowledge, which belongs to a specific domain and is only possessed by experts.
Situated knowledge is knowledge specific to a particular situation. It is closely related to practical or tacit knowledge, which is learned and applied in specific circumstances. This especially concerns certain forms of acquiring knowledge, such as trial and error or learning from experience. In this regard, situated knowledge usually lacks a more explicit structure and is not articulated in terms of universal ideas. The term is often used in feminism and postmodernism to argue that many forms of knowledge are not absolute but depend on the concrete historical, cultural, and linguistic context.

Explicit knowledge is knowledge that can be fully articulated, shared, and explained, like the knowledge of historical dates and mathematical formulas. It can be acquired through traditional learning methods, such as reading books and attending lectures. It contrasts with tacit knowledge, which is not easily articulated or explained to others, like the ability to recognize someone&#x27;s face and the practical expertise of a master craftsman. Tacit knowledge is often learned through first-hand experience or direct practice.

Cognitive load theory distinguishes between biologically primary and secondary knowledge. Biologically primary knowledge is knowledge that humans have as part of their evolutionary heritage, such as knowing how to recognize faces and speech and many general problem-solving capacities. Biologically secondary knowledge is knowledge acquired because of specific social and cultural circumstances, such as knowing how to read and write.

Knowledge can be occurrent or dispositional. Occurrent knowledge is knowledge that is actively involved in cognitive processes. Dispositional knowledge, by contrast, lies dormant in the back of a person&#x27;s mind and is given by the mere ability to access the relevant information. For example, if a person knows that cats have whiskers then this knowledge is dispositional most of the time and becomes occurrent while they are thinking about it.

Many forms of Eastern spirituality and religion distinguish between higher and lower knowledge. They are also referred to as para vidya and apara vidya in Hinduism or the two truths doctrine in Buddhism. Lower knowledge is based on the senses and the intellect. It encompasses both mundane or conventional truths as well as discoveries of the empirical sciences. Higher knowledge is understood as knowledge of God, the absolute, the true self, or the ultimate reality. It belongs neither to the external world of physical objects nor to the internal world of the experience of emotions and concepts. Many spiritual teachings stress the importance of higher knowledge to progress on the spiritual path and to see reality as it truly is beyond the veil of appearances.

== Sources ==
Sources of knowledge are ways in which people come to know things. They can be understood as cognitive capacities that are exercised when a person acquires new knowledge. Various sources of knowledge are discussed in the academic literature, often in terms of the mental faculties responsible. They include perception, introspection, memory, inference, and testimony. However, not everyone agrees that all of them actually lead to knowledge. Usually, perception or observation, i.e. using one of the senses, is identified as the most important source of empirical knowledge. Knowing that a baby is sleeping is observational knowledge if it was caused by a perception of the snoring baby. However, this would not be the case if one learned about this fact through a telephone conversation with one&#x27;s spouse. Perception comes in different modalities, including vision, sound, touch, smell, and taste, which correspond to different physical stimuli. It is an active process in which sensory signals are selected, organized, and interpreted to form a representation of the environment. This leads in some cases to illusions that misrepresent certain aspects of reality, like the MÃ¼ller-Lyer illusion and the Ponzo illusion.

Introspection is often seen in analogy to perception as a source of knowledge, not of external physical objects, but of internal mental states. A traditionally common view is that introspection has a special epistemic status by being infallible. According to this position, it is not possible to be mistaken about introspective facts, like whether one is in pain, because there is no difference between appearance and reality. However, this claim has been contested in the contemporary discourse and critics argue that it may be possible, for example, to mistake an unpleasant itch for a pain or to confuse the experience of a slight ellipse for the experience of a circle. Perceptual and introspective knowledge often act as a form of fundamental or basic knowledge. According to some empiricists, they are the only sources of basic knowledge and provide the foundation for all other knowledge.

Memory differs from perception and introspection in that it is not as independent or basic as they are since it depends on other previous experiences. The faculty of memory retains knowledge acquired in the past and makes it accessible in the present, as when remembering a past event or a friend&#x27;s phone number. It is generally seen as a reliable source of knowledge. However, it can be deceptive at times nonetheless, either because the original experience was unreliable or because the memory degraded and does not accurately represent the original experience anymore.

Knowledge based on perception, introspection, and memory may give rise to inferential knowledge, which comes about when reasoning is applied to draw inferences from other known facts. For example, the perceptual knowledge of a Czech stamp on a postcard may give rise to the inferential knowledge that one&#x27;s friend is visiting the Czech Republic. This type of knowledge depends on other sources of knowledge responsible for the premises. Some rationalists argue for rational intuition as a further source of knowledge that does not rely on observation and introspection. They hold for example that some beliefs, like the mathematical belief that 2 + 2 = 4, are justified through pure reason alone.
Testimony is often included as an additional source of knowledge that, unlike the other sources, is not tied to one specific cognitive faculty. Instead, it is based on the idea that one person can come to know a fact because another person talks about this fact. Testimony can happen in numerous ways, like regular speech, a letter, a newspaper, or a blog. The problem of testimony consists in clarifying why and under what circumstances testimony can lead to knowledge. A common response is that it depends on the reliability of the person pronouncing the testimony: only testimony from reliable sources can lead to knowledge.

== Limits ==
The problem of the limits of knowledge concerns the question of which facts are unknowable. These limits constitute a form of inevitable ignorance that can affect both what is knowable about the external world as well as what one can know about oneself and about what is good. Some limits of knowledge only apply to particular people in specific situations while others pertain to humanity at large. A fact is unknowable to a person if this person lacks access to the relevant information, like facts in the past that did not leave any significant traces. For example, it may be unknowable to people today what Caesar&#x27;s breakfast was the day he was assassinated but it was knowable to him and some contemporaries. Another factor restricting knowledge is given by the limitations of the human cognitive faculties. Some people may lack the cognitive ability to understand highly abstract mathematical truths and some facts cannot be known by any human because they are too complex for the human mind to conceive. A further limit of knowledge arises due to certain logical paradoxes. For instance, there are some ideas that will never occur to anyone. It is not possible to know them because if a person knew about such an idea then this idea would have occurred at least to them.

There are many disputes about what can or cannot be known in certain fields. Religious skepticism is the view that beliefs about God or other religious doctrines do not amount to knowledge. Moral skepticism encompasses a variety of views, including the claim that moral knowledge is impossible, meaning that one cannot know what is morally good or whether a certain behavior is morally right. An influential theory about the limits of metaphysical knowledge was proposed by Immanuel Kant. For him, knowledge is restricted to the field of appearances and does not reach the things in themselves, which exist independently of humans and lie beyond the realm of appearances. Based on the observation that metaphysics aims to characterize the things in themselves, he concludes that no metaphysical knowledge is possible, like knowing whether the world has a beginning or is infinite.

There are also limits to knowledge in the empirical sciences, such as the uncertainty principle, which states that it is impossible to know the exact magnitudes of certain certain pairs of physical properties, like the position and momentum of a particle, at the same time. Other examples are physical systems studied by chaos theory, for which it is not practically possible to predict how they will behave since they are so sensitive to initial conditions that even the slightest of variations may produce a completely different behavior. This phenomenon is known as the butterfly effect.

The strongest position about the limits of knowledge is radical or global skepticism, which holds that humans lack any form of knowledge or that knowledge is impossible. For example, the dream argument states that perceptual experience is not a source of knowledge since dreaming provides unreliable information and a person could be dreaming without knowing it. Because of this inability to discriminate between dream and perception, it is argued that there is no perceptual knowledge of the external world. This thought experiment is based on the problem of underdetermination, which arises when the available evidence is not sufficient to make a rational decision between competing theories. In such cases, a person is not justified in believing one theory rather than the other. If this is always the case then global skepticism follows. Another skeptical argument assumes that knowledge requires absolute certainty and aims to show that all human cognition is fallible since it fails to meet this standard.

An influential argument against radical skepticism states that radical skepticism is self-contradictory since denying the existence of knowledge is itself a knowledge-claim. Other arguments rely on common sense or deny that infallibility is required for knowledge. Very few philosophers have explicitly defended radical skepticism but this position has been influential nonetheless, usually in a negative sense: many see it as a serious challenge to any epistemological theory and often try to show how their preferred theory overcomes it. Another form of philosophical skepticism advocates the suspension of judgment as a form of attaining tranquility while remaining humble and open-minded.

A less radical limit of knowledge is identified by fallibilists, who argue that the possibility of error can never be fully excluded. This means that even the best-researched scientific theories and the most fundamental common-sense views could still be subject to error. Further research may reduce the possibility of being wrong, but it can never fully exclude it. Some fallibilists reach the skeptical conclusion from this observation that there is no knowledge but the more common view is that knowledge exists but is fallible. Pragmatists argue that one consequence of fallibilism is that inquiry should not aim for truth or absolute certainty but for well-supported and justified beliefs while remaining open to the possibility that one&#x27;s beliefs may need to be revised later.

== Structure ==
The structure of knowledge is the way in which the mental states of a person need to be related to each other for knowledge to arise. A common view is that a person has to have good reasons for holding a belief if this belief is to amount to knowledge. When the belief is challenged, the person may justify it by referring to their reason for holding it. In many cases, this reason depends itself on another belief that may as well be challenged. An example is a person who believes that Ford cars are cheaper than BMWs. When their belief is challenged, they may justify it by claiming that they heard it from a reliable source. This justification depends on the assumption that their source is reliable, which may itself be challenged. The same may apply to any subsequent reason they cite. This threatens to lead to an infinite regress since the epistemic status at each step depends on the epistemic status of the previous step. Theories of the structure of knowledge offer responses for how to solve this problem.

Three traditional theories are foundationalism, coherentism, and infinitism. Foundationalists and coherentists deny the existence of an infinite regress, in contrast to infinitists. According to foundationalists, some basic reasons have their epistemic status independent of other reasons and thereby constitute the endpoint of the regress. Some foundationalists hold that certain sources of knowledge, like perception, provide basic reasons. Another view is that this role is played by certain self-evident truths, like the knowledge of one&#x27;s own existence and the content of one&#x27;s ideas. The view that basic reasons exist is not universally accepted. One criticism states that there should be a reason why some reasons are basic while others are not. According to this view, the putative basic reasons are not actually basic since their status would depend on other reasons. Another criticism is based on hermeneutics and argues that all understanding is circular and requires interpretation, which implies that knowledge does not need a secure foundation.

Coherentists and infinitists avoid these problems by denying the contrast between basic and non-basic reasons. Coherentists argue that there is only a finite number of reasons, which mutually support and justify one another. This is based on the intuition that beliefs do not exist in isolation but form a complex web of interconnected ideas that is justified by its coherence rather than by a few privileged foundational beliefs. One difficulty for this view is how to demonstrate that it does not involve the fallacy of circular reasoning. If two beliefs mutually support each other then a person has a reason for accepting one belief if they already have the other. However, mutual support alone is not a good reason for newly accepting both beliefs at once. A closely related issue is that there can be distinct sets of coherent beliefs. Coherentists face the problem of explaining why someone should accept one coherent set rather than another. For infinitists, in contrast to foundationalists and coherentists, there is an infinite number of reasons. This view embraces the idea that there is a regress since each reason depends on another reason. One difficulty for this view is that the human mind is limited and may not be able to possess an infinite number of reasons. This raises the question of whether, according to infinitism, human knowledge is possible at all.

== Value ==

Knowledge may be valuable either because it is useful or because it is good in itself. Knowledge can be useful by helping a person achieve their goals. For example, if one knows the answers to questions in an exam one is able to pass that exam or by knowing which horse is the fastest, one can earn money from bets. In these cases, knowledge has instrumental value. Not all forms of knowledge are useful and many beliefs about trivial matters have no instrumental value. This concerns, for example, knowing how many grains of sand are on a specific beach or memorizing phone numbers one never intends to call. In a few cases, knowledge may even have a negative value. For example, if a person&#x27;s life depends on gathering the courage to jump over a ravine, then having a true belief about the involved dangers may hinder them from doing so.
Besides having instrumental value, knowledge may also have intrinsic value. This means that some forms of knowledge are good in themselves even if they do not provide any practical benefits. According to philosopher Duncan Pritchard, this applies to forms of knowledge linked to wisdom. It is controversial whether all knowledge has intrinsic value, including knowledge about trivial facts like knowing whether the biggest apple tree had an even number of leaves yesterday morning. One view in favor of the intrinsic value of knowledge states that having no belief about a matter is a neutral state and knowledge is always better than this neutral state, even if the value difference is only minimal.

A more specific issue in epistemology concerns the question of whether or why knowledge is more valuable than mere true belief. There is wide agreement that knowledge is usually good in some sense but the thesis that knowledge is better than true belief is controversial. An early discussion of this problem is found in Plato&#x27;s &quot;Meno&quot; in relation to the claim that both knowledge and true belief can successfully guide action and, therefore, have apparently the same value. For example, it seems that mere true belief is as effective as knowledge when trying to find the way to Larissa. According to Plato, knowledge is better because it is more stable. Another suggestion is that knowledge gets its additional value from justification. One difficulty for this view is that while justification makes it more probable that a belief is true, it is not clear what additional value it provides in comparison to an unjustified belief that is already true.

The problem of the value of knowledge is often discussed in relation to reliabilism and virtue epistemology. Reliabilism can be defined as the thesis that knowledge is reliably formed true belief. This view has difficulties in explaining why knowledge is valuable or how a reliable belief-forming process adds additional value. According to an analogy by philosopher Linda Zagzebski, a cup of coffee made by a reliable coffee machine has the same value as an equally good cup of coffee made by an unreliable coffee machine. This difficulty in solving the value problem is sometimes used as an argument against reliabilism. Virtue epistemology, by contrast, offers a unique solution to the value problem. Virtue epistemologists see knowledge as the manifestation of cognitive virtues. They hold that knowledge has additional value due to its association with virtue. This is based on the idea that cognitive success in the form of the manifestation of virtues is inherently valuable independent of whether the resulting states are instrumentally useful.

Acquiring and transmitting knowledge often comes with certain costs, such as the material resources required to obtain new information and the time and energy needed to understand it. For this reason, an awareness of the value of knowledge is crucial to many fields that have to make decisions about whether to seek knowledge about a specific matter. On a political level, this concerns the problem of identifying the most promising research programs to allocate funds. Similar concerns affect businesses, where stakeholders have to decide whether the cost of acquiring knowledge is justified by the economic benefits that this knowledge may provide, and the military, which relies on intelligence to identify and prevent threats. In the field of education, the value of knowledge can be used to choose which knowledge should be passed on to the students.

== Science ==

The scientific approach is usually regarded as an exemplary process of how to gain knowledge about empirical facts. Scientific knowledge includes mundane knowledge about easily observable facts, for example, chemical knowledge that certain reactants become hot when mixed together. It also encompasses knowledge of less tangible issues, like claims about the behavior of genes, neutrinos, and black holes.

A key aspect of most forms of science is that they seek natural laws that explain empirical observations. Scientific knowledge is discovered and tested using the scientific method. This method aims to arrive at reliable knowledge by formulating the problem in a clear way and by ensuring that the evidence used to support or refute a specific theory is public, reliable, and replicable. This way, other researchers can repeat the experiments and observations in the initial study to confirm or disconfirm it. The scientific method is often analyzed as a series of steps that begins with regular observation and data collection. Based on these insights, scientists then try to find a hypothesis that explains the observations. The hypothesis is then tested using a controlled experiment to compare whether predictions based on the hypothesis match the observed results. As a last step, the results are interpreted and a conclusion is reached whether and to what degree the findings confirm or disconfirm the hypothesis.

The empirical sciences are usually divided into natural and social sciences. The natural sciences, like physics, biology, and chemistry, focus on quantitative research methods to arrive at knowledge about natural phenomena. Quantitative research happens by making precise numerical measurements and the natural sciences often rely on advanced technological instruments to perform these measurements and to setup experiments. Another common feature of their approach is to use mathematical tools to analyze the measured data and formulate exact and general laws to describe the observed phenomena.

The social sciences, like sociology, anthropology, and communication studies, examine social phenomena on the level of human behavior, relationships, and society at large. While they also make use of quantitative research, they usually give more emphasis to qualitative methods. Qualitative research gathers non-numerical data, often with the goal of arriving at a deeper understanding of the meaning and interpretation of social phenomena from the perspective of those involved. This approach can take various forms, such as interviews, focus groups, and case studies. Mixed-method research combines quantitative and qualitative methods to explore the same phenomena from a variety of perspectives to get a more comprehensive understanding.

The progress of scientific knowledge is traditionally seen as a gradual and continuous process in which the existing body of knowledge is increased at each step. This view has been challenged by some philosophers of science, such as Thomas Kuhn, who holds that between phases of incremental progress, there are so-called scientific revolutions in which a paradigm shift occurs. According to this view, some basic assumptions are changed due to the paradigm shift, resulting in a radically new perspective on the body of scientific knowledge that is incommensurable with the previous outlook.

Scientism refers to a group of views that privilege the sciences and the scientific method over other forms of inquiry and knowledge acquisition. In its strongest formulation, it is the claim that there is no other knowledge besides scientific knowledge. A common critique of scientism, made by philosophers such as Hans-Georg Gadamer and Paul Feyerabend, is that the fixed requirement of following the scientific method is too rigid and results in a misleading picture of reality by excluding various relevant phenomena from the scope of knowledge.

== History ==
The history of knowledge is the field of inquiry that studies how knowledge in different fields has developed and evolved in the course of history. It is closely related to the history of science, but covers a wider area that includes knowledge from fields like philosophy, mathematics, education, literature, art, and religion. It further covers practical knowledge of specific crafts, medicine, and everyday practices. It investigates not only how knowledge is created and employed, but also how it is disseminated and preserved.

Before the ancient period, knowledge about social conduct and survival skills was passed down orally and in the form of customs from one generation to the next. The ancient period saw the rise of major civilizations starting about 3000 BCE in Mesopotamia, Egypt, India, and China. The invention of writing in this period significantly increased the amount of stable knowledge within society since it could be stored and shared without being limited by imperfect human memory. During this time, the first developments in scientific fields like mathematics, astronomy, and medicine were made. They were later formalized and greatly expanded by the ancient Greeks starting in the 6th century BCE. Other ancient advancements concerned knowledge in the fields of agriculture, law, and politics.

In the medieval period, religious knowledge was a central concern, and religious institutions, like the Catholic Church in Europe, influenced intellectual activity. Jewish communities set up yeshivas as centers for studying religious texts and Jewish law. In the Muslim world, madrasa schools were established and focused on Islamic law and Islamic philosophy. Many intellectual achievements of the ancient period were preserved, refined, and expanded during the Islamic Golden Age from the 8th to 13th centuries. Centers of higher learning were established in this period in various regions, like Al-Qarawiyyin University in Morocco, the Al-Azhar University in Egypt, the House of Wisdom in Iraq, and the first universities in Europe. This period also saw the formation of guilds, which preserved and advanced technical and craft knowledge.

In the Renaissance period, starting in the 14th century, there was a renewed interest in the humanities and sciences. The printing press was invented in the 15th century and significantly increased the availability of written media and general literacy of the population. These developments served as the foundation of the Scientific Revolution in the Age of Enlightenment starting in the 16th and 17th centuries. It led to an explosion of knowledge in fields such as physics, chemistry, biology, and the social sciences. The technological advancements that accompanied this development made possible the Industrial Revolution in the 18th and 19th centuries. In the 20th century, the development of computers and the Internet led to a vast expansion of knowledge by revolutionizing how knowledge is stored, shared, and created.

== In various disciplines ==
=== Religion ===

Knowledge plays a central role in many religions. Knowledge claims about the existence of God or religious doctrines about how each one should live their lives are found in almost every culture. However, such knowledge claims are often controversial and are commonly rejected by religious skeptics and atheists. The epistemology of religion is the field of inquiry studying whether belief in God and in other religious doctrines is rational and amounts to knowledge. One important view in this field is evidentialism, which states that belief in religious doctrines is justified if it is supported by sufficient evidence. Suggested examples of evidence for religious doctrines include religious experiences such as direct contact with the divine or inner testimony when hearing God&#x27;s voice. Evidentialists often reject that belief in religious doctrines amounts to knowledge based on the claim that there is not sufficient evidence. A famous saying in this regard is due to Bertrand Russell. When asked how he would justify his lack of belief in God when facing his judgment after death, he replied &quot;Not enough evidence, God! Not enough evidence.&quot;

However, religious teachings about the existence and nature of God are not always seen as knowledge claims by their defenders. Some explicitly state that the proper attitude towards such doctrines is not knowledge but faith. This is often combined with the assumption that these doctrines are true but cannot be fully understood by reason or verified through rational inquiry. For this reason, it is claimed that one should accept them even though they do not amount to knowledge. Such a view is reflected in a famous saying by Immanuel Kant where he claims that he &quot;had to deny knowledge in order to make room for faith.&quot;

Distinct religions often differ from each other concerning the doctrines they proclaim as well as their understanding of the role of knowledge in religious practice. In both the Jewish and the Christian traditions, knowledge plays a role in the fall of man, in which Adam and Eve were expelled from the Garden of Eden. Responsible for this fall was that they ignored God&#x27;s command and ate from the tree of knowledge, which gave them the knowledge of good and evil. This is seen as a rebellion against God since this knowledge belongs to God and it is not for humans to decide what is right or wrong. In the Christian literature, knowledge is seen as one of the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit. In Islam, &quot;the Knowing&quot; (&quot;al-Ê¿AlÄ«m&quot;) is one of the 99 names reflecting distinct attributes of God. The Qur&#x27;an asserts that knowledge comes from Allah and the acquisition of knowledge is encouraged in the teachings of Muhammad.
In Buddhism, knowledge that leads to liberation is called &quot;vijjÄ&quot;. It contrasts with &quot;avijjÄ&quot; or ignorance, which is understood as the root of all suffering. This is often explained in relation to the claim that humans suffer because they crave things that are impermanent. The ignorance of the impermanent nature of things is seen as the factor responsible for this craving. The central goal of Buddhist practice is to stop suffering. This aim is to be achieved by understanding and practicing the teaching known as the Four Noble Truths and thereby overcoming ignorance. Knowledge plays a key role in the classical path of Hinduism known as &quot;jÃ±Äna yoga&quot; or &quot;path of knowledge&quot;. It aims to achieve oneness with the divine by fostering an understanding of the self and its relation to Brahman or ultimate reality.

=== Anthropology ===
The &quot;anthropology of knowledge&quot; is a multi-disciplinary field of inquiry. It studies how knowledge is acquired, stored, retrieved, and communicated. Special interest is given to how knowledge is reproduced and changes in relation to social and cultural circumstances. In this context, the term &quot;knowledge&quot; is used in a very broad sense, roughly equivalent to terms like &quot;understanding&quot; and &quot;culture&quot;. This means that the forms and reproduction of understanding are studied irrespective of their truth value. In epistemology, by contrast, knowledge is usually restricted to forms of true belief. The main focus in anthropology is on empirical observations of how people ascribe truth values to meaning contents, like when affirming an assertion, even if these contents are false. This also includes practical components: knowledge is what is employed when interpreting and acting on the world and involves diverse phenomena, such as feelings, embodied skills, information, and concepts. It is used to understand and anticipate events to prepare and react accordingly.

The reproduction of knowledge and its changes often happen through some form of communication used to transfer knowledge. This includes face-to-face discussions and online communications as well as seminars and rituals. An important role in this context falls to institutions, like university departments or scientific journals in the academic context. Anthropologists of knowledge understand traditions as knowledge that has been reproduced within a society or geographic region over several generations. They are interested in how this reproduction is affected by external influences. For example, societies tend to interpret knowledge claims found in other societies and incorporate them in a modified form.

Within a society, people belonging to the same social group usually understand things and organize knowledge in similar ways to one another. In this regard, social identities play a significant role: people who associate themselves with similar identities, like age-influenced, professional, religious, and ethnic identities, tend to embody similar forms of knowledge. Such identities concern both how a person sees themselves, for example, in terms of the ideals they pursue, as well as how other people see them, such as the expectations they have toward the person.

=== Sociology ===

The sociology of knowledge is the subfield of sociology that studies how thought and society are related to each other. Like the anthropology of knowledge, it understands &quot;knowledge&quot; in a wide sense that encompasses philosophical and political ideas, religious and ideological doctrines, folklore, law, and technology. The sociology of knowledge studies in what sociohistorical circumstances knowledge arises, what consequences it has, and on what existential conditions it depends. The examined conditions include physical, demographic, economic, and sociocultural factors. For instance, philosopher Karl Marx claimed that the dominant ideology in a society is a product of and changes with the underlying socioeconomic conditions. Another example is found in forms of decolonial scholarship that claim that colonial powers are responsible for the hegemony of Western knowledge systems. They seek a decolonization of knowledge to undermine this hegemony. A related issue concerns the link between knowledge and power, in particular, the extent to which knowledge is power. The philosopher Michel Foucault explored this issue and examined how knowledge and the institutions responsible for it control people through what he termed biopower by shaping societal norms, values, and regulatory mechanisms in fields like psychiatry, medicine, and the penal system.

A central subfield is the sociology of scientific knowledge, which investigates the social factors involved in the production and validation of scientific knowledge. This encompasses examining the impact of the distribution of resources and rewards on the scientific process, which leads some areas of research to flourish while others languish. Further topics focus on selection processes, such as how academic journals decide whether to publish an article and how academic institutions recruit researchers, and the general values and norms characteristic of the scientific profession.

=== Others ===
Formal epistemology studies knowledge using formal tools found in mathematics and logic. An important issue in this field concerns the epistemic principles of knowledge. These are rules governing how knowledge and related states behave and in what relations they stand to each other. The transparency principle, also referred to as the &quot;luminosity of knowledge&quot;, states that it is impossible for someone to know something without knowing that they know it. According to the conjunction principle, if a person has justified beliefs in two separate propositions, then they are also justified in believing the conjunction of these two propositions. In this regard, if Bob has a justified belief that dogs are animals and another justified belief that cats are animals, then he is justified to believe the conjunction that both dogs and cats are animals. Other commonly discussed principles are the closure principle and the evidence transfer principle.

Knowledge management is the process of creating, gathering, storing, and sharing knowledge. It involves the management of information assets that can take the form of documents, databases, policies, and procedures. It is of particular interest in the field of business and organizational development, as it directly impacts decision-making and strategic planning. Knowledge management efforts are often employed to increase operational efficiency in attempts to gain a competitive advantage. Key processes in the field of knowledge management are knowledge creation, knowledge storage, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application. Knowledge creation is the first step and involves the production of new information. Knowledge storage can happen through media like books, audio recordings, film, and digital databases. Secure storage facilitates knowledge sharing, which involves the transmission of information from one person to another. For the knowledge to be beneficial, it has to be put into practice, meaning that its insights should be used to either improve existing practices or implement new ones.

Knowledge representation is the process of storing organized information, which may happen using various forms of media and also includes information stored in the mind. It plays a key role in the artificial intelligence, where the term is used for the field of inquiry that studies how computer systems can efficiently represent information. This field investigates how different data structures and interpretative procedures can be combined to achieve this goal and which formal languages can be used to express knowledge items. Some efforts in this field are directed at developing general languages and systems that can be employed in a great variety of domains while others focus on an optimized representation method within one specific domain. Knowledge representation is closely linked to automatic reasoning because the purpose of knowledge representation formalisms is usually to construct a knowledge base from which inferences are drawn. Influential knowledge base formalisms include logic-based systems, rule-based systems, semantic networks, and frames. Logic-based systems rely on formal languages employed in logic to represent knowledge. They use linguistic devices like individual terms, predicates, and quantifiers. For rule-based systems, each unit of information is expressed using a conditional production rule of the form &quot;if A then B&quot;. Semantic nets model knowledge as a graph consisting of vertices to represent facts or concepts and edges to represent the relations between them. Frames provide complex taxonomies to group items into classes, subclasses, and instances.

Pedagogy is the study of teaching methods or the art of teaching. It explores how learning takes place and which techniques teachers may employ to transmit knowledge to students and improve their learning experience while keeping them motivated. There is a great variety of teaching methods and the most effective approach often depends on factors like the subject matter and the age and proficiency level of the learner. In teacher-centered education, the teacher acts as the authority figure imparting information and directing the learning process. Student-centered approaches give a more active role to students with the teacher acting as a coach to facilitate the process. Further methodological considerations encompass the difference between group work and individual learning and the use of instructional media and other forms of educational technology.

<text>In the case of uncertainty, expectation is what is considered the most likely to happen. An expectation, which is a belief that is centered on the future, may or may not be realistic. A less advantageous result gives rise to the emotion of disappointment. If something happens that is not at all expected, it is a surprise. An expectation about the behavior or performance of another person, expressed to that person, may have the nature of a strong request, or an order; this kind of expectation is called a social norm. The degree to which something is expected to be true can be expressed using fuzzy logic. Anticipation is the emotion corresponding to expectation.

==Expectations of well-being==
Richard Lazarus asserts that people become accustomed to positive or negative life experiences which lead to favorable or unfavorable expectations of their present and near-future circumstances. Lazarus notes the widely accepted philosophical principle that &quot;happiness depends on the background psychological status of the person...and cannot be well predicted without reference to one&#x27;s expectations.&quot;

With regard to happiness or unhappiness, Lazarus notes that &quot;people whose objective conditions of life are those of hardship and deprivation often make a positive assessment of their well-being,&quot; while &quot;people who are objectively well off...often make a negative assessment of their well-being.&quot; Lazarus argues that &quot;the most sensible explanation of this apparent paradox is that people...develop favorable or unfavorable &quot;expectations&quot;&quot; that guide such assessments.

===Response-Expectancies===
Irving Kirsch, a renowned psychological researcher, writes about &quot;response-expectancies&quot; which are: expectations about non-volitional responses. For example, science commonly takes into account &quot;placebo-effects&quot; when testing for new drugs, against subjects expectations of those drugs: for example, if you expect to receive a drug that may help with depression, and you feel better after taking it, but the drug is just a salt-tablet (better known as a placebo), then the benefit of feeling better (i.e. your non-volitional response), would be based on your expectations rather than any properties of the placebo (i.e. the salt-tablet).

==Expectations impact on beliefs==
Sociologist Robert K. Merton wrote that a person&#x27;s expectation is directly linked to self-fulfilling prophecy. Whether or not such an expectation is truthful or not, has little or no effect on the outcome. If a person believes what they are told or convinces himself/herself of the fact, chances are this person will see the expectation to its inevitable conclusion. There is an inherent danger in this kind of labeling especially for the educator. Since children are easily convinced of certain tenets especially when told to them by an authority figure like a parent or teacher, they may believe whatever is taught to them even if what is taught has no factual basis. If the student or child were to act on false information, certain positive or negative unintended consequences could result. If overly positive or elevated expectations were used to describe or manipulate a person&#x27;s self-image and execution falls short, the results could be a total reversal of that person&#x27;s self-confidence. If thought of in terms of causality or cause and effect, the higher a person&#x27;s expectation and the lower the execution, the higher the frustration level may become. This in turn could cause a total cessation of effort and motivate the person to quit.

== Expectations elicitation ==
Expectations are a central part of value calculations in economics. For example, calculating the Subjective expected utility of an outcome requires knowing both the value of an outcome and the probability that it will occur. Researchers who elicit (or measure) the expectations of individuals can input these beliefs into the model in place of standard probabilities. The strategy of eliciting individual expectations is now incorporated into many international surveys, including the Health and Retirement Study in the United States.

Expectations elicitation is used in many domains, including survival and educational outcomes, but may be most prominent in financial realms. Expectations are theoretically important for models such as the Efficient-market hypothesis which suggest that all information should be incorporated into the market, as well as for Modern portfolio theory which suggests that investors must be compensated for higher levels of risk through higher (expected) returns. Following these models, empirical research has found that consumers with more optimistic stock market expectations are more likely to hold riskier assets, and acquire stocks in the near future. Given these promising findings, more recent research in psychology has begun to explore what factors drive consumers&#x27; expectations by exploring what factors come to mind when forming stock market expectations.

<text>Infosys Limited is an Indian multinational technology company that offers business consulting, information technology, and outsourcing services. Founded in 1981, the company is headquartered in Bengaluru.

On 24 August 2021, Infosys became the fourth Indian company to achieve a market capitalization of billion. As of 2024, Infosys is the second-largest Indian Big Tech company by revenue and market capitalization.

Infosys has also attracted controversies due to allegations of visa and tax fraud in the United States and for creating malfunctioning government websites.

==History==
Infosys was founded by seven engineers in Pune, with an initial capital of $250. It was registered as Infosys Consultants Private Limited on 2 July 1981. In 1983, it relocated to Bangalore.

The company changed its name to Infosys Technologies Private Limited in April 1992 and became Infosys Technologies Limited when it became a public limited company in June 1992.

In February 1993, Infosys launched its initial public offering (IPO) with an offer price of 95 per share, compared to a book value of 20 per share. The IPO was initially undersubscribed but was &quot;bailed out&quot; by US investment bank Morgan Stanley, which acquired a 13% equity stake at the offer price. When trading began in June 1993, the share price opened at 145 per share.

Infosys shares were listed on the Nasdaq stock exchange in 1999 as American depositary receipts (ADRs), making it the first Indian company to be listed on Nasdaq. The share price rose to 8,100 by 1999, making it the most expensive share on the market at the time. Infosys was then among the top 20 companies by market capitalization on the Nasdaq. The ADR listing was later transferred from Nasdaq to NYSE Euronext to provide European investors with better access to the company&#x27;s shares.

In July 2010, then-British Prime Minister David Cameron visited Infosys headquarters in Bangalore and addressed the company&#x27;s employees. In June 2011, the company was renamed Infosys Limited.
In 2012, Infosys announced the opening of a new office in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, to serve Harley-Davidson. In 2011, Infosys hired 1,200 U.S. employees, and by 2012, it had expanded its workforce by an additional 2,000 employees.

In July 2014, Infosys launched a product subsidiary named EdgeVerve Systems, focusing on enterprise software products for business operations, customer service, procurement, and commerce network domains. In August 2015, Infosys transferred assets of Finacle to EdgeVerve Systems.

Infosys surpassed US$10 million in annual revenue in FY 1995, US$100 million in FY 1999, US$1 billion in FY 2004, and US$10 billion in FY 2017. In FY 2023, its revenue stood at US$18 billion.

Infosys announced the launch of Aster in June 2024, an AI-powered platform designed to improve marketing efficiency through the use of artificial intelligence.

==Services and products== 
Infosys offers software development, maintenance, and independent validation services across industries such as finance, insurance, manufacturing, among others. Through its subsidiary Infosys Consulting, it provides consulting services in digital experience, cloud, data analytics, artificial intelligence, engineering, and sustainability. Its subsidiary Infosys BPM provides outsourcing services for business processes such as finance, procurement, customer service, and HR.

Infosys offers digital products and platforms for digital transformation, including Finacle, Panaya, Infosys Equinox, Infosys Meridian, EdgeVerve and Infosys Cortex. Finacle is a banking solution that supports financial institutions in improving their customer service capabilities. Panaya is a platform that assists organizations in accelerating application delivery and innovation. Infosys Equinox is a digital commerce platform designed for facilitating user-friendly and personalized shopping experiences. Infosys Meridian is a workplace platform for increased productivity in remote and hybrid work environments.

==Acquisitions==

==Listing and shareholding pattern==
In India, Infosys shares are listed on the BSE, where it is a part of the BSE SENSEX, and on the NSE, where it is included in the NIFTY 50 index. Infosys also trades its shares through American depositary receipts (ADRs) on the New York Stock Exchange.

Over the years, the shareholding of Infosys&#x27;s promoters has steadily decreased. This trend began in June 1993, when Infosys first listed its shares. The promoter holdings further declined when Infosys became the first Indian-registered company to list Employee Stock Options Schemes and ADRs on NASDAQ on 11 March 1999.

==Operations==
===Geographical presence===

As of 31 March 2024, Infosys operates 94 sales and marketing offices and 139 development centers globally. The company&#x27;s operations are spread across key regions, including India, the United States, Canada, China, Australia, Japan, the Middle East, and Europe.

In the fiscal year 2023-2024, Infosys generated approximately 61% of its revenue from North America, 25% from Europe, 3% from India, and 11% from other regions, including the Middle East, Australia, and Japan.

Infosys faced scrutiny following the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February 2022. The company clarified that it had no active relationships with Russian firms. By November 2022, only administrative staff remained, handling the transfer of contracts to other contractors.

===Employees===
As of 31 March 2024, Infosys employed a total of 343,234 people, commonly referred to as &quot;Infoscions,&quot; with 40.1% of them being women. Of this workforce, 302,850 are software professionals, while the remaining 40,384 are engaged in support and sales roles. In 2023, 85% of Infosys&#x27; employees were located in India.

=== Training centre in Mysore ===

As the world&#x27;s largest corporate university, the Infosys Global Education Centre, located on a 337-acre campus, features 400 instructors and over 200 classrooms, adhering to international benchmarks. Established in 2002, it had trained approximately 125,000 engineering graduates by June 2015. The centre can accommodate and train up to 14,000 employees at any given time across various technologies.

The Infosys Leadership Institute (ILI), located in Mysore, features 196 rooms and trains approximately 4,000 trainees annually. Its primary objective is to cultivate and develop senior leaders within Infosys, preparing them for both current and future executive roles.

Additionally, the Infosys Training Centre in Mysore offers a range of extracurricular facilities, including tennis courts, badminton and basketball courts, a swimming pool, a gym, and a bowling alley. The campus also features an international-standard cricket ground, approved by the BCCI.

=== CEOs ===
From its establishment in 1981 until 2014, Infosys&#x27; CEOs were its founders, with N. R. Narayana Murthy leading the company for the initial 21 years. Dr. Vishal Sikka was the first external CEO, serving for approximately three years. Sikka resigned in August 2017. Following his departure, UB Pravin Rao was appointed as Interim CEO and Managing Director of the company. Infosys appointed Salil Parekh as Chief Executive Officer (CEO) and Managing Director (MD), effective from 2 January 2018.

== Controversies ==
=== Settlement of tax fraud in the US ===

In December 2019, Infosys reached an $800,000 settlement with the State of California in a visa and tax fraud case. Between 2006 and 2017, nearly 500 Infosys employees were found to be working in the state on Infosys-sponsored B-1 visas instead of the required H-1B visas, enabling the company to avoid paying California payroll taxes, including unemployment insurance, disability insurance, and employment training taxes.

=== Accusation of visa fraud in the US ===

In 2011, Infosys was accused of visa fraud for using B-1 (visitor) visas for work that required H-1B (work) visas. The allegations originated from an internal complaint by an American employee of Infosys, who subsequently filed a lawsuit against the company, claiming harassment and marginalization after raising the issue. Although the lawsuit was dismissed, along with another similar case, these allegations were brought to the attention of U.S. authorities, leading to investigations by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and a federal grand jury.

In October 2013, Infosys agreed to settle the civil suit with U.S. authorities by paying $34 million. While the company did not admit guilt, it stated that it settled to avoid the complications of &quot;prolonged litigation&quot;. Infosys asserted that, &quot;As reflected in the settlement, Infosys denies and disputes any claims of systemic visa fraud, misuse of visas for competitive advantage, or immigration abuse. Those claims are untrue and are assertions that remain unproven.&quot;

=== Malfunctioning government portals ===

In 2013, technical issues emerged after Infosys took over the MCA21 portal from Tata Consultancy Services. Similar problems arose in 2016 after a system migration and version update.

In 2020, the finance ministry identified glitches in the GSTN portal, leading to a summons for Infosys executives. In 2022, chartered accountants and tax professionals raised concerns over technical issues with the GSTN portal.

In 2021, the newly launched Income Tax portal, developed by Infosys, encountered multiple glitches. Despite a summons for Infosys CEO Salil Parekh, the issues remained unresolved for months, forcing an extension of the tax filing deadline. In 2022, users continued to report malfunctions and issues on the first anniversary of the portal&#x27;s launch.

<doc id="243402" wikidata="Q7318651" url="?curid=243402" title="Revolution (software platform)">
<text>Revolution is a software development environment/multimedia authoring software in the tradition of HyperCard and is based on the MetaCard engine. Its primary focus is on providing a relatively accessible development tool set and scripting language that enable the creation of software programs that run across multiple platforms with little or no code modifications. The Integrated Development Environment (IDE) included with Revolution is built partly on the models created by Bill Atkinson and the original HyperCard team at Apple and subsequently followed by many other software development products, such as Microsoft&#x27;s Visual Basic. Revolution includes an English language-like scripting language called Transcript, a full programming language superset of the HyperCard&#x27;s scripting language, HyperTalk.

The higher-grade versions (see Versions, below), allow applications to be compiled to run on more than one platform, including Macintosh (Classic or Mac OS 9, and Mac OS X), Windows and Unix-like systems including Linux. It can also import HyperCard stacks, which require little or no modification unless they use external functions, which generally do not work in Revolution.

Revolution is designed to be an environment where non-programmers feel at ease and programmers feel not too uncomfortable (after getting used to &quot;non-traditional&quot; programming syntax). Like any programming language or development environment, opinions as to the degree to which those aims have been achieved vary greatly.

== Versions ==
Before Revolution 2, the &quot;Starter Kit&quot; version was available. This was freeware and imposed restrictions on the user, such as not allowing scripts longer than ten lines to be compiled. However, this has since been discontinued and is no longer available for download. The &quot;Dreamcard&quot; version is intended for home users/hobbyists. Applications (called &quot;stacks&quot;) built using it require either the &quot;Dreamcard Player&quot; or a full copy of Revolution to run because Dreamcard does not include the Revolution compiler. The &quot;Studio&quot; version is more powerful, and is useful in creating professional binary applications. The Enterprise version is probably too expensive for casual users, but when compared to other similar products such as Borland Delphi or Kylix, is priced competitively. If one wishes to develop programs on non-Microsoft platforms for cross-platform deployment, Revolution is one of a small handful of commercially supported options.

== Compatibility ==
Revolution is derived from MetaCard&#x27;s engine, so MetaCard stacks are 100% compatible with Revolution. However, the other way around is not necessarily true. HyperCard stacks can be run, but externals will only run on Macs. SuperCard stacks must be run through a converter to be upgraded to Revolution/MetaCard format.

== Platforms ==
Revolution runs on Mac Classic, Mac OS X, Windows 9x/NT/2000/XP, and the following UNIX variants:
*FreeBSD or BSD/OS 
*HP-UX 10.20 or later 
*SGI IRIX 5.3 or later 
*Linux Intel 1.2.13 ELF or later 
*AIX 3.2.3 or later 
*Solaris (2.5 or later for SPARC and x86; 2.3 and 2.4 SPARC only)
*SunOS 4.1.x or later

Standalone applications written in Revolution can run on the above, as well as Windows 3.1 (with limitations).

As of March 2005, the Dreamcard Player runs only on Windows, Mac OS (Classic or X), and Linux.

== Interface ==
On Linux, the user&#x27;s GNOME/Xfce/GTK+ theme will be used if GTK+ is installed, otherwise, a Motif look will be used. On the Mac, Appearance Manager will be used if available, otherwise the Platinum look will be used. On Windows, the XP theme or standard widgets will be used. Users can preview the Motif, Platinum, and Windows appearance on any platform.

== Revolution community ==
There are many companies and groups which use the Revolution engine. It is mainly used by freelance programmers to make small widgets or libraries, but as one example is used exclusively by the Christa McAuliffe Space Education Center.

<text>Main-Tauber-Kreis is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the northeast of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from northwest clockwise) Miltenberg, Main-Spessart, WÃ¼rzburg, Neustadt (Aisch)-Bad Windsheim and Ansbach (all in Bavaria), and the districts of SchwÃ¤bisch Hall, Hohenlohe and Neckar-Odenwald.

== History ==
Traces of human population in the area were found to go back as early as 5500 B.C.

Throughout the 18th and 19th century, during the so&quot;-&quot;called &quot;Kleinstaaterei&quot;, southern parts of today&#x27;s district were part of the free imperial city of Rothenburg ob der Tauber, the Principality of Ansbach, while the city of Weikersheim played a major role in the history of the Hohenlohe dynasty and temporarily was one of its seats. Later, the biggest part of the district was part of the Bishopric of WÃ¼rzburg until 1803.

Bad Mergentheim belonged to the Teutonic order and Tauberbischofsheim, the districts capitcal, was part of Kurmainz from 1237 to 1803.

=== Coat of arms and flag ===
Historical affiliations of the territory reflect in the coat of arms. They show the symbols of the three of the historical states to which the area of the district belonged. The Bishopric of WÃ¼rzburg is represented by the red and white field divided by a line with three peaks, which was originally the coat of arms of Franconia. The wheel is the symbol of the Archbishopric of Mainz; the cross is the symbol of the Teutonic Order.

The coat of arms are officially recognized by the state of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg since 19 March 1974. The corresponding flag was authorized by the on 28 November 1989.

=== District in modern Germany ===
The district originated in 1973 with the merging of the districts of Bad Mergentheim, Tauberbischofsheim and parts of the district of Buchen. At first called the district of Tauber, it took its current name, the district of Main-Tauber, in 1974. The name comes from the two primary rivers in the district, the Main and the Tauber.

== Geography ==

The Main forms the northern border of the district, while its affluent Tauber flows through the district from southeast to north. The north of the district covers part of the Odenwald mountains, while the southern area is called Bauland.

=== Area ===
The Main-Tauber Kreis has a total area of 1304.1kmÂ², that is distributed as follows:

* Settlement and traffic area: 136,3 kmÂ² (10,4%)
* Recreational area: 5,9 kmÂ² (0,5%)
* Agricultural area: 765,4 kmÂ² (58,7%)
* Forest: 386,2 kmÂ² (29,6%)
* Water: 10,5 kmÂ² (0,8%)

== Cities and municipalities ==


== Demographics ==
As of 31 December 2022, 134,745 people live in the district, which corresponds to 1.19% of Baden-WÃ¼rttemberg&#x27;s total population. Foreign born residents make up 12 percent of the population and people aged 65 or older make up 23 percent.

== Infrastructure ==

=== Roads ===
The total length of the road network in the district is about 909 kilometres, of which about half (463 km) are county roads (KreisstraÃen), just over a third (347 km) are state roads (LandesstraÃen), and about 10 per cent (99 km) are federal highways (BundestraÃen).

=== Public transport ===
Around 110 public transport buses are operated by the VGMT (Verkehrsgesellschaft Main-Tauber) in the district. The VGMT was founded 1997 and serves around 900 to 1000 stations today.

== International relations ==
Comparable with the concept of twin towns, the &quot;Kreis&quot; has partnerships with:

* Tolna County, Hungary
* Bautzen District, Saxony
* Zabkowice Slaskie, Poland
* , formal partnership with a part of the German Army Aviation Corps.

<doc id="243406" wikidata="Q1364584" url="?curid=243406" title="River Ness">
<text>The River Ness () is a short river in the Great Glen of Scotland. It begins at Loch Dochfour, at the northern end of Loch Ness, and flows northeast towards the city of Inverness, where it empties into the Moray Firth. It runs parallel to the Caledonian Canal for the first half of its course, which is long in total.

At Inverness, the river contains a group of wooded islets known as the Ness Islands, some of which are linked to the shore by footbridges. 

==Bridges==
There has been a bridge over the Ness at Inverness since at least the 15th century. The bridge was originally made of timber, but it was rebuilt in stone in 1685. The 1685 bridge endured until 1849, when it was swept away in a flood. J. M. W. Turner painted it before its destruction. The suspension bridge built to replace the bridge of 1685 was itself replaced in 1961 by the present Ness Bridge, a concrete structure. Other noteworthy bridges over the Ness are the Greig Street Bridge and the Infirmary Bridge, two Victorian suspension bridges.

==Legends==
The first claimed sighting of the Loch Ness Monster was in the River Ness in AD 565, when Saint Columba is said to have banished a &quot;water monster&quot; back into the river after it tried to attack one of his disciples who was swimming across the river.

According to AdomnÃ¡n, when Columba visited King Bridei I of Pictland at his house on the River Ness, he met a wizard named Broichan who had an Irish slave-girl that he refused to release even though Columba pleaded with him. Columba went out of Bridei&#x27;s house and picked up a white pebble from the river. He said that the pebble would be used to heal many sick people in Pictland, and that Broichan was suffering for his sins at that very moment. After he had finished speaking, two messengers came to tell them that Broichan had a seizure and they wanted Columba to help them. Columba gave them the stone and said to dip it in water to give to Broichan, if he agreed to release the slave-girl. He agreed to do so, and the stone was put in water and it floated on it; the wizard drank from the water and was healed. This stone was kept by King Bridei in the royal treasury for the rest of his life, and anyone who came there for healing would be given water with the stone floating in it, and they would be healed.

<doc id="243407" wikidata="Q909073" url="?curid=243407" title="Caledonian Canal">
<text>The Caledonian Canal connects the Scottish east coast at Inverness with the west coast at Corpach near Fort William in Scotland. The canal was constructed in the early nineteenth century by Scottish engineer Thomas Telford.

==Route==
The canal runs some from northeast to southwest and reaches above sea level. Only one third of the entire length is man-made, the rest being formed by Loch Dochfour, Loch Ness, Loch Oich, and Loch Lochy. These lochs are located in the Great Glen, on a geological fault in the Earth&#x27;s crust. There are 29Â locks (including eight at Neptune&#x27;s Staircase, Banavie), four aqueducts and 10Â bridges in the course of the canal.

===Northern section===
The canal starts at its north-eastern end at Clachnaharry Sea Lock, built at the end of a man-made peninsula to ensure that boats could always reach the deep water of the Beauly Firth. Because the peninsula is built with mud foundations, it has required regular maintenance ever since. Next to the lock is the former lock-keeper&#x27;s house, a two-storey building with a single-storey bothy at its western end and an enclosed garden. At an unknown date, the house was divided into two, and in 2005 the eastern half became offices for Scottish Canals. The building is a category C listed structure. At the opposite end of the peninsula to the sea lock, a swing bridge carries the Far North railway line across the canal. The first bridge at the site was designed by Joseph Mitchell for the Inverness and Ross-shire Railway, and was constructed of wrought iron in 1862. This was replaced by a similar structure in 1909, made of steel, which is long. The bridge, together with the adjacent signal box, designed by Mackenzie and Holland for the Highland Railway in 1890, is a category B listed structure.

Clachnaharry lock is next to the swing bridge, and is bordered by a smiddy and workshops, dating from the canal&#x27;s construction in 1810, and extended in 1840â50. The smiddy still contains two hearths for forging metal. Muirtown Basin provides moorings at the eastern end of the canal, which takes a right-angled turn at the far end to pass under a swing bridge carrying the A862 road to reach the flight of four Muirtown Locks. From the top of the flight, the canal continues southwards to Tomnahurich swing bridge, which carries the A82 road over the canal. The original timber bridge was replaced by a steel structure in 1938, designed by Crouch and Hogg, which included a control box, as levels of traffic on the road and canal were increasing. Nearby is the former bridge keeper&#x27;s cottage, built in the 1820s. It was no longer needed to house a bridge keeper after 1965, and after being empty for some years, was converted into self-catering accommodation. A short distance to the south a second swing bridge was opened in June 2021, as part of the Inverness West Link project. A new control building was built between the two bridges, so that both could be controlled from a single location. The concept behind the second bridge was that traffic could be diverted to use one of the bridges while the other was open for canal traffic.

The canal from Muirtown Locks to Dochgarroch Lock is a scheduled monument, as is Dochgarroch Lock, which was designed to protect the canal from flooding caused by fluctuating levels in the River Ness, which flows over a weir to the south of the lock. A two-storey lock keeper&#x27;s cottage and barn dating from the 1850s overlooks the lock. The final section of canal to Loch Dochfour is also scheduled, and the designated area includes the weir for the River Ness, and the west bank of Loch Dochfour as far as Loch Ness. At its southern end is Bona Lighthouse, built as a house by Thomas Telford in 1815, and altered around 1848 to act as a lighthouse. The building is octagonal, with two storeys, and is a rare example of an inland light. There was once a ferry across the Bona channel at this point. In 1844, the channel was made deeper and wider when barges pulled by horses were replaced by steam tugs, and there is evidence that the building once included four stables. The canal section from Clachnaharry Sea Lock to Bona is long, and from there it is over along Loch Ness to the next canal section at Fort Augustus.

===Middle section===
At the foot of Loch Ness, the Caledonian Canal leaves the west bank of the loch, with the River Oich to the north and the River Tarff to the south. The A82 road crosses the canal on a swing bridge, at the foot of the five locks that rise through the centre of the village of Fort Augustus. In 1975 only the locks were included in the scheduled monument designation, but that was subsequently extended to include all of the canal between them and Loch Ness, including the lighthouse at the entrance to this section of canal. At the top of the locks, a road beside the canal is spanned by a railway bridge, which was constructed to carry an intended line from Fort Augustus to Inverness. The bridge was in use from 1903 to 1906, when the railway project was abandoned. As well as the bridge, some piers built to carry the line over the River Oich can also be seen, although these are in a poor state of repair. The canal to Kytra Lock and the lock itself are both scheduled monuments. The canal continues to Cullochy Lock, where to the north of the structure there is a single storey lock keeper&#x27;s cottage on the west bank which dates from the building of the canal, and a pair of two-storey houses for the lock keepers, dating from around 1830, on the east bank. On the east side of the lock is a single-storey storehouse dating from 1815 to 1820, which has three bays and internally is divided into a store and an office for the lock keeper.

The final part of the canal on this section runs from the lock to Loch Oich, and includes the abutments of a small swing bridge which formerly provided an accommodation crossing over the canal. The more modern Aberchalder swing bridge carries the A82 over the canal. A single-storey three bay cottage designed by Telford once provided housing for the bridge keeper. Nearby is the old bridge that carried the road over the River Oich, which was probably designed by James Dredge in the 1850s. It is a chain suspension bridge, and a long dry stone causeway provides access from the east. The A82 crosses the river on a three-arched concrete bridge designed by Mears and Carus-Wilson and constructed in 1932. Loch Oich is the summit of the canal, at above sea level, and despite its relatively small size compared to Loch Ness and Loch Lochy, it provides most of the of water that is required each day to keep the canal operating.

The short section of canal between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy is crossed by a plate girder swing bridge carrying the A82 road at its northern end, and ends at a pair of locks at its southern end. Two jetties project out into Loch Lochy, and much of the structure is built on reclaimed land. A single-storey store with basement stands to the east of the locks, which was probably used to store materials and to provide stabling for horses while the canal was being constructed. On the west bank is Glenjade Cottage, dating from 1840 to 1860, which was once a pair of cottages but was converted into a single dwelling in the late 20th century. Ivy Cottage was also built for lock keepers, but was completed for the opening of the canal, and so is older than Glenjade cottages.

===Southern section===
Loch Lochy is about long, and the next canal section starts at its southern end. Its entrance is marked by a small lighthouse, while to the east of the canal is the Mucomir Cut, which delivers water from the loch to Mucomir hydroelectric station and the River Lochy. There are two locks at Gairlochy, the upper one being the only lock which was not built for the opening of the canal. It was added in 1844, and was constructed by Jackson and Bean. Between the locks is Telford House, a large lock keeper&#x27;s house built in 1811â13, and much larger than most of the other houses built along the canal. The B8084 road crosses the canal on a swing bridge at the upstream end of Gairlochy lower lock, but it is unclear whether it is part of the scheduled monument, since it is not specifically mentioned in the listing, whereas most bridges are either included or excluded. About further downstream is Moy Swing Bridge, an original accommodation bridge. It consists of two halves, and the lock keeper from Gairlochy opens the eastern half by operating a capstan, and then crosses the canal by punt to perform a similar action on the western half. A three-bay single-storey cottage, dating from around 1820, survives on the eastern bank of the canal next to the bridge.

The section below Moy Bridge includes four aqueducts which carry the canal over local rivers. These are the Loy aqueduct, the Muirshearlich aqueduct, the Sheangain aqueduct and the Mount Alexander aqueduct. The Loy aqueduct consists of three parallel arches, long, with the River Loy passing through the centre arch, and the side arches used for pedestrians and animals, although they sometimes carry flood flow from the river. Torcastle aqueduct is similar but slightly shorter at , and carries the Allt Sheangain in two of the arches, with the third used as a roadway. Mount Alexander aqueduct only has two arches, one used by the Allt Mor, and the other a footpath.

Soon the canal arrives at the top of Neptunes Staircase, a flight of eight locks that drop the level of the canal by in the space of . Halfway down the flight to the west is another house similar to that at Gairlochy, but split to provide accommodation for two lock keepers. On the eastern bank is a smithy and sawpits, dating from the 1820s, and a workshop dating from 1880 to 1890. Neptunes Staircase was originally fitted with 36 capstans each of which had to be rotated 20 times to operate the lock gates and sluices, but progress through the structure was sped up in the 20th century when the flight was mechanised. At the foot of the locks, a swing bridge carries the A830 road over the canal, and a steel bow truss swing bridge, built in 1901 by Simpson and Wilson, carries the West Highland Line from to . The canal turns to the west to reach a pair of staircase locks at Corpach, which is followed by a small basin and the final sea lock to allow boats to access Loch Linnhe.

==Names==
The canal has several names in Scottish Gaelic including &quot;Amar-Uisge/SeÃ²laid a&#x27; Ghlinne MhÃ²ir&quot; (&quot;Waterway of the Great Glen&quot;), &quot;Sligh&#x27;-Uisge na h-Alba&quot; (&quot;Waterway of Scotland&quot;) and a literal translation &quot;(An) CanÃ l Cailleannach&quot;.

==History==
In 1620, a Highland prophet called the Brahan Seer predicted that full-rigged ships would one day be sailing round the back of Tomnahurich, near Inverness, at a time when the only navigable route near the location was the River Ness, on the other side of Tomnahurich.

Engineers started to look at the feasibility of a canal to connect Loch Linnhe near Fort William to the Moray Firth near Inverness in the 18thÂ century, with Captain Edward Burt rejecting the idea in 1726, as he thought the mountains would channel the wind and make navigation too precarious.

The Commissioners of Forfeited Estates had originally been set up to handle the seizure and sale of land previously owned by those who had been convicted of treason following the Jacobite rising of 1715. By 1773, they had turned their attention to helping the fishing industry, and commissioned the inventor and mechanical engineer James Watt to make a survey of the route. He published a report in 1774, which suggested that a deep canal from Fort William to Inverness, passing through Loch Lochy, Loch Oich, Loch Ness and Loch Dochfour, would require 32Â locks, and could be built for Â£164,032. He emphasised the benefits to the fishing industry, of a shorter and safer route from the east to the west coast of Scotland, and the potential for supplying the population with cheaper corn, but again, thought that winds on the lochs might be a problem.

William Fraser, when proposing his own scheme for a canal in 1793, announced that &quot;nature had finished more than half of it already&quot;. At the time, much of the Highlands were depressed as a result of the Highland Clearances, which had deprived many of their homes and jobs. Laws had been introduced which sought to eradicate the local culture, including bans on wearing tartan, playing the bagpipes, and speaking Scottish Gaelic. Many emigrated to Canada or elsewhere, or moved to the Scottish Lowlands. Crop failures in 1799 and 1800 brought distress to many, and prompted a new wave of emigrants to leave. The engineer Thomas Telford was asked to investigate the problem of emigration in 1801, and in 1802 published his report, which suggested that the main cause was landowners who had previously kept cattle creating vast sheep-farms. Realising that direct government action to confront the issue would be seen as interference, he therefore suggested that a programme of public works, involving roads, bridges, and canals, would be a way to provide jobs for people who had been displaced by the sheep farming, and to stimulate industry, fishery, and agriculture.

Telford consulted widely with shipowners, who favoured a canal instead of the hazardous journey around the north of Scotland via Cape Wrath and the Pentland Firth. He obtained advice from Captain Gwynn of the Royal Navy, who stated that Loch Ness and Loch Lochy were sufficiently deep for any size of boat, and had safe anchorages if winds proved to be a problem, but that Loch Oich would need to be made deeper, as it was shallow in places. He established that Loch Garry, to the west of Invergarry, and Loch Quoich, beyond that, would provide an adequate water supply. He estimated that a canal suitable for ships with a draught of could be built in seven years, and would cost around Â£350,000Â . An additional benefit would be the protection that the canal offered to shipping from attacks by French privateers. Telford also looked at the possibility of a canal to link Loch Eil to Loch Shiel, both to the west of Fort William, but ruled out the scheme because of the depth of cuttings that would have been required. The canal, as well as a number of projects to build roads, harbours and bridges, was the first time that public works of this sort had been funded by the government. Telford had convinced them that it was feasible, and that employing local people on it would help to stop the tide of emigration, but no one considered whether it would pay its way when it was completed.

===Planning===
On 27Â July 1803, an act of Parliament, the &#x27; (43 Geo. 3. c. 102) was passed to authorise the project, and carried the title: &quot;An Act for granting to his Majesty the Sum of Â£20,000, towards defraying the Expense of making an Inland Navigation from the western to the eastern Sea, by Inverness and Fort William; and for taking the necessary steps towards executing the same.&quot; The act appointed commissioners, to oversee the project, and some funding to enable the work to start. Less than a year later, on 29Â June 1804, the commissioners obtained a second act of Parliament, the &#x27; (44 Geo. 3. c. 62) which granted them Â£50,000 per year of government money, payable in two instalments, to fund the ongoing work.

Provision was made for private investors to buy shares in the scheme, for any amount over Â£50, and as well as building the main line of the canal, the engineers could alter Loch Garry, Loch Quoich and Loch Arkaig, to improve their function as reservoirs. Telford was asked to survey, design and build the waterway. He worked with William Jessop on the survey, and the two men oversaw the construction until Jessop died in 1814. The canal was expected to take seven years to complete, and to cost Â£474,000, to be funded by the Government, but both estimates were inadequate. Telford understood the need for competent men to be involved in such a grand project, and convinced most of those who had been involved with him on building the Ellesmere Canal and the Pontcysyllte Aqueduct to move north to Scotland. He ensured that Jessop became the consulting engineer, while Matthew Davidson, who was a stonemason from Dumfrieshire and had been Superintendent of Works on the Ellesmere project, became the resident engineer at the Clachnaharry end, near Inverness. The Corpach end, near Fort William, was managed by John Telford, who is thought not to have been related to Thomas, but was known to him from Ellesmere. At the time, Telford&#x27;s scheme for the development of the Highlands was the largest programme of works ever undertaken for a specific area in Britain.

Telford was responsible to the Caledonian Canal Commissioners in London for the canal work, and to the Commissioners for Roads and Bridges for the construction of roads. He visited the Highlands twice a year, to plan the work and inspect the progress, and was always on the move, to the extent that the Canal Commissioners allowed him to choose the dates when he would find it convenient to meet with them. In the Highlands, Telford faced a number of problems, in that the canal was to be built in an area where people lived a subsistence lifestyle, managing by keeping a few cows and paying low rents. They had virtually no knowledge of wheeled vehicles, and no construction skills, but were hardy and willing to learn. While surveying the route for the canal, Telford agreed to increase the size of the locks to accommodate 32-gun frigates for the Royal Navy, and Jessop insisted that the locks should be built of stone, rather than having turf sides, as Telford had suggested.

The highest point on the route was at Laggan, between Lock Oich and Loch Lochy. A deep cutting was required, so that the canal continued at the same level as Loch Oich. The loch would need dredging, because it was too shallow in places, but it was fed by water from Loch Garry and Loch Quoich to the west, which would provide a suitable supply for the canal. To reduce the depth of cutting between Loch Oich and Loch Lochy, a dam would be built at the south end of Loch Lochy, to raise its level by . A new channel for the River Lochy would be cut, allowing it to flow into the River Spean, so that its previous course could be used for the canal. Similarly, heading north from Loch Oich, parts of the canal would be constructed in the bed of the River Oich, which would be diverted to the east. At the northern end of Loch Ness, the channel through Loch Dochfour would have to be made deeper, and a weir was to be constructed at its northern end, to maintain the loch at the same level as Loch Ness.

Telford and Jessop had a long list of things to do, because of the lack of construction skills in the region where the canal was built. As well as the normal surveying, inspection and payment duties, they had to train local people in how to become workers. They were required to source all of the building materials, to construct workshops and settlements for the workers, design tools and waggons to be used by the workers, and in some cases, ensure they had supplies of food and drink. All of the money provided by Parliament passed through Telford&#x27;s personal bank account. Because of the remoteness of the location, construction was started at both ends, so that completed sections could be used to bring in the materials for the middle sections. In order to help the Highlanders to learn the habits of paid employment, Telford appointed organisers and pace-setters, who would impart skill and activity to the other workers, and wherever possible, the work was done by piecework, so that earthworks were paid at 6 pence (2.5p) per cubic yard, cutting rock in Corpach Basin was paid at two shillings (10p) per cubic yard, and rubble masonry work was paid at 11 shillings (55p) per cubic yard, for example. The number of men employed fluctuated widely, not least because many would take time off to attend to peat cutting, herring fishing or harvesting. John Telford was upset because many of his men did not return after the harvest, but they were not used to working during the winter months. Many saw working on the canal as a way to supplement their meagre income, not as a way to escape from their subsistence livelihood.

===Construction===
At Clachnaharry, to the west of Inverness, Davidson was overseeing the construction. Clachnaharry Lock was the first to be constructed at the eastern end of the canal, being completed in 1807 by Simpson and Cargill. Simpson was another of Telford&#x27;s recruits from the Ellesmere project. Muirtown Basin was also completed in the same year. It was , and construction was aided by the fact that its bottom was above the level of low tides, and so it was relatively easy to keep the works dry. The road from the basin into Inverness was renamed Telford Street, and Simpson and Cargill built a row of houses for overseers and contractors to live in, including themselves. To build the sea lock, two banks were built out into the Beauly Firth across mud which was deep. Two tramways with a gauge of were constructed along the banks, to bring rubble and earth to extend the banks. By the time the banks were completed, the price of foreign timber to construct a coffer dam had risen so much that work was postponed. The four Muirtown locks were finished in 1909. During this time, Davidson noticed that the sea banks were settling into the mud, and the idea of turning the two banks into a peninsula and then excavating the lock into it was formulated. It is unclear whether the concept was Telford&#x27;s, Jessop&#x27;s or Davidson&#x27;s, but it saved the expense of building a coffer dam. The peninsula was allowed to settle for six months before excavation began, and a Boulton and Watt steam engine was used to keep the lock pit dry during the work. The structure was completed in 1812, three years later than Davidson&#x27;s original estimate.

At Corpach, near Fort William, John Telford faced a number of problems. The entrance lock and the basin were built on rock, and this entailed excavating rock below the level of Loch Linnhe. A steam engine was ordered from Boulton and Watt at Birmingham, to keep the work area dry, and an embankment was built beyond the sea lock, which served as a quay for incoming materials until the lock was constructed. Masons built several buildings at Corpach, but then moved on to building the aqueducts to carry the canal over rivers, since the lower canal needed to be completed to enable materials to be brought to the great flight of locks at Banavie. The work was to prove a serious challenge to John Telford&#x27;s health and he died in 1807, to be replaced by Alexander Easton. He was buried in Kilmallie churchyard, where his ornate grave, now in dilapidated condition, can still be seen.

At Banavie, two houses for lock keepers were built by Simpson and Wilson before work on the locks started, which were occupied by masons during the estimated four years that it would take to finish the flight. The stonework was largely completed by 1811, three and a half years after work started. By early 1810, the steam engine at Corpach was ready, and the coffer dam to enable the sea lock to be built was completed by mid-1810, after considerable difficulty. Completing the lock was a priority, because the steam engine had to be kept running until the gates could hold back the sea, and it was the first lock to become operational, being completed just before the sea lock at Clachnaharry. By 1816, the canal was complete as far as Loch Lochy, but could not be used until the level of the loch was raised, and that depended on work further along the canal being completed.
The ground through which the canal was cut was variable, and further difficulties were experienced with the construction of the locks, the largest ever built at the time. There were also problems with the labour force, with high levels of absence, particularly during and after the potato harvest and the peat cutting season. This led to Telford bringing in Irish navvies to manage the shortfall, which led to further criticism, since one of the main aims of the project was to reduce unemployment in the Highlands. The canal finally opened in 1822, having taken an extra 12Â years to complete, and cost Â£910,000. Over 3,000Â local people had been employed in its construction, but the draught had been reduced from in an effort to save costs. In the meantime, shipbuilding had advanced, with the introduction of steam-powered iron-hulled ships, many of which were by that time too big to use the canal. The Royal Navy did not need to use the canal either, as Napoleon had been defeated at Waterloo in 1815, and the perceived threat to shipping when the canal was started was now gone.

==Operation==
Before long, defects in some of the materials used became apparent, and part of Corpach double lock collapsed in 1843. This led to a decision to close the canal to allow repairs to be carried out, and the depth was increased to at the same time. The work was designed by Telford&#x27;s associate James Walker, carried out by Jackson and Bean of Aston, Birmingham and completed between 1843 and 1847 at a cost of Â£136,089. However, not all of the traffic expected to return to using the canal did so. Commercially, the venture was not a success, but the dramatic scenery through which it passes led to it becoming a tourist attraction. Queen Victoria took a trip along it in 1873, and the publicity surrounding the trip resulted in a large increase in visitors to the region and the canal. The arrival of the railways at Fort William, Fort Augustus and Inverness did little to harm the canal, as trains were scheduled to connect with steamboat services.

There was an upsurge in commercial traffic during the First World War, when components for the construction of mines were shipped through the canal on their way from America to âU.S. Naval Base 18â (Muirtown Basin, Inverness), and fishing boats used it to avoid possible enemy action on the longer route around the north of Scotland. During this period there was 24-hour operation, facilitated by buoyage and lighting throughout its length. Ownership passed to the Ministry of Transport in 1920, and then to British Waterways in 1962. Improvements were made, with the locks being mechanised between 1964 and 1969. By 1990, the canal was in obvious need of restoration, with lock walls bulging, and it was estimated that repairs would cost Â£60Â million. With no prospect of the Government funding this, British Waterways devised a repair plan, and between 1995 and 2005, sections of the canal were drained each winter. Stainless steel rods were used to tie the double-skinned lock walls together, and over 25,000Â tonnes of grout were injected into the lock structures. All of the lock gates were replaced, and the result was a canal whose structures were probably in a better condition than they had ever been. In 1993, British Waterways and Parks Canada agreed to twin the canal with the Rideau Canal in Ontario, Canada.

The canal is now a scheduled monument, and attracts over 500,000Â visitors each year. British Waterways, who work with the Highland Council and Forestry and Land Scotland through the Great Glen Ways Initiative, were hoping to increase this number to over 1Â million by 2012. There are many ways for tourists to enjoy the canal, such as taking part in the Great Glen Rally, cycling along the tow-paths, or cruising on hotel barges.

<text>uname (short for &quot;unix name&quot;) is a computer program in Unix and Unix-like computer operating systems that prints the name, version and other details about the current machine and the operating system running on it.

==History==
The codice_1 system call and command appeared for the first time in PWB/UNIX. Both are specified by POSIX. The GNU version of uname is included in the &quot;sh-utils&quot; or &quot;coreutils&quot; packages. codice_1 itself is not available as a standalone program. The version of codice_1 bundled in GNU coreutils was written by David MacKenzie. The command is available as a separate package for Microsoft Windows as part of the GnuWin32 project and the UnxUtils collection of native Win32 ports of common GNU Unix-like utilities.

==Related and similar commands==
* Some Unix variants, such as AT&amp;T UNIX System V Release 3.0, include the related codice_4 program, used to change the values that uname reports.
* The codice_5 command found in operating systems such as DOS, OS/2 and Microsoft Windows is similar to the codice_1 command.
* The bash shell provides the special variables codice_7 and codice_8 whose values are similar to those of codice_9 and codice_10 respectively.

==Examples==
On a system running Darwin, the output from running codice_1 with the codice_12 command-line argument might look like the text below:

$ uname -a
Darwin Roadrunner.local 10.3.0 Darwin Kernel Version 10.3.0: Fri Feb 26 11:58:09 PST 2010; root:xnu-1504.3.12~1/RELEASE_I386 i386
The following table contains examples from various versions of codice_1 on various platforms.

<text>Nan (, ; Northern Thai: ) is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces (&quot;changwat&quot;), and lies in upper northern Thailand. Neighboring provinces are (from south clockwise): Uttaradit, Phrae, and Phayao. To the north and east it borders Sainyabuli of Laos.

==Geography==
The province is in the remote Nan River valley, surrounded by forested mountains, the Phlueng Range in the western part and the Luang Prabang Range in the east. The highest mountain is the 2,079 meter high &quot;Phu Khe&quot; in Bo Kluea District, northeast of the city of Nan towards the border with Laos. The total forest area is or 61.3 percent of provincial area.

===National parks===
There are seven national parks, along with three other national parks, make up region 13 (Phrae) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Doi Phu Kha National Parks, 
* Si Nan National Park, 
* Mae Charim National Park, 
* Nanthaburi National Park, 
* Khun Sathan National Park, 
* Tham Sakoen National Park, 
* Khun Nan National Park, 

==Climate==
Nan province has a tropical savanna climate (KÃ¶ppen climate classification &quot;Aw&quot;). Winters are quite dry and very warm. Temperatures rise until April, which is very hot with the average daily maximum at . The monsoon season runs from late April through October, with heavy rain and somewhat cooler temperatures during the day, although nights remain warm.

==History==
For centuries Nan was an independent kingdom but, due to its remoteness, had few connections to the other kingdoms. The first kingdom around the city &quot;Mueang Pua&quot; (also known as &quot;Woranakorn&quot;) was created in the late-13th century. Its rulers, the Phukha Dynasty, were related to the founders of Vientiane, however it became associated with the Sukhothai Kingdom as it was easier to reach from the south than from the east or west. In the 14th century the capital was moved to its present location at Nan.

In the 15th century, when Sukhothai declined in power, it became vassal of the kingdom of Lannathai. In 1443 King Inthakanthao of Nan Kingdom plotted to capture neighboring Phayao by asking King Tilokaraj to help him fight against Vietnamese troops attacking Nan, even though there was no such threat. King Inthakanthao killed the king of Phayao, however the troops of Tilokaraj then attacked Nan itself, and captured it in 1449.

Between 1560-1785, Nan was colonized by Burma many times. Nan was also the abandoned city without people twice: first from 1704-1706, and later in 1778â1801.

When Lannathai was under Burmese rule, Nan tried to liberate itself many times without success, which finally led to Burmese rule of Nan in 1714. In 1788 the Burmese rulers were finally driven out. Nan had to then accept new rulers from Siam. In 1893 after the Paknam crisis Siam had to give a big part of eastern Nan to French Indochina. In 1899 &quot;mueang&quot; Nan became part of the circle (Monthon) &quot;Tawan Tok Chiang Nuea&quot; (northwestern circle). In 1916 the northwestern circle was split and Nan was assigned to the circle &quot;Maharat&quot;. When the circles were abolished in 1932, the provinces including Nan became top-level subdivisions of Siam.

Before the early-1980s, bandits as well as People&#x27;s Liberation Army of Thailand (PLAT) guerrillas were a big problem in the province, usually destroying highway construction overnight. With the help of the army and the more stable political system the province improved significantly, but is still a very rural and remote area.

In August 2024, many provinces in the north experienced flooding. For Nan, it was considered the worst flooding in 100 years.

==Economy==
Agriculture is the province&#x27;s main industry, but tourism in 2016 contributed an estimated 30% to the provincial GDP. The number of hotel rooms in Nan has doubled to 4,000 in 2016. The Tourism Department says arrivals to Nan rose by 19% to 1.76 million in 2015, of which Thais numbered 1.44 million. Tourism revenue rose by 14% to 4.43 billion baht. The Tourism Authority of Thailand (TAT) expects tourist arrivals to Nan will rise by 10% to 1.94 million in 2016 as tourism revenue grows by 10% to 4.88 billion baht. &quot;We want only quality tourists, not a big volume&quot;, said a spokesman. In 2018 some 939,240 tourists visited Nan, up 4.4% year-on-year, contributing 2.6 billion baht in tourism income, a gain of 8.3%. Most visitorsâ97%âare Thais, of whom 62% were repeat visitors. Just 3% were foreign tourists from the US, France, China, Japan, and Laos. In the first eight months of 2019 Nan welcomed 643,129 tourists, up 0.2% year-on-year, generating 1.94 billion baht in income, up 2.1%. 
According to the &quot;Bangkok Post&quot;, the top two attractions in Nan province are Doi Samer Dao and Wat Phumin, a temple with many &quot;local art masterpieces&quot;.

==Environmental issues==
Nan and government forestry officials are concerned about deforestation after hill tribes turned 1.5 million rai of forest land into cornfields. Nan Governor, Mr Suwat, says officials have attempted to persuade hill tribes to grow perennial plants such as cashew nuts and bamboo in the forest legally. &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to solve the deforestation problem without involving the hill tribes,&quot; he says. &quot;We must give them a solution to live in the forest and protect nature at the same time.&quot;

==Symbols==

The provincial seal shows a Usuparatch bull carrying the stupa of Phrathat Chae Haeng. The buffalo dates back to a legend that the rulers of Nan and Phrae were brothers, and met at a mountain to decide about the boundary between their lands. The ruler of Nan went there on a buffalo, while the ruler of Phrae went there on a horse.

The provincial tree and provincial flower is the Orchid Tree (&quot;Bauhinia variegata&quot;). &quot;Hypsibarbus vernayi&quot; is the provincial aquatic life, what with they swim upstream to spawns in the water source in the forestland of Bo Kluea district. An unseen natural phenomenon that occurs only once a year during the Buddhist holy days of March.

==Demographics==
Hill tribes constitute 10.5 percent of the population. Inhabitants known as the T&#x27;in or Mal people speak a Northern Mon-Khmer or Khmuic language, T&#x27;in, an unknown language when GÃ©rard Diffloth&#x27;s classifications were widely cited in a 1974 EncyclopÃ¦dia Britannica article.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 15 districts
(&quot;amphoe&quot;). These are further divided into 99 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 848 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Nan Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 19 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Nan has town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 18 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 80 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations â SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="243412" wikidata="Q192068" url="?curid=243412" title="Eclecticism">
<text>Eclecticism is a conceptual approach that does not hold rigidly to a single paradigm or set of assumptions, but instead draws upon multiple theories, styles, or ideas to gain complementary insights into a subject, or applies different theories in particular cases. However, this is often without conventions or rules dictating how or which theories were combined.

Eclecticism in ethics, philosophy, politics, and religion is often compared to syncretism, but the two concepts differ in their approach to combining elements from different traditions. While syncretism in religion involves the merging or assimilation of several distinct traditions into a new, unified system, eclecticism adopts elements from various systems without necessarily integrating them into a single cohesive framework. This distinction allows for a broader, more inclusive approach in eclecticism, where the selection is based on individual merit or preference rather than an attempt to create a new unified tradition.

==Origin==
Eclecticism was first recorded to have been practiced by a group of ancient Greek and Roman philosophers who attached themselves to no real system, but selected from existing philosophical beliefs those doctrines that seemed most reasonable to them. Out of this collected material they constructed their new system of philosophy. The term comes from the Greek (&quot;eklektikos&quot;), literally &quot;choosing the best&quot;, and that from (&quot;eklektos&quot;), &quot;picked out, select&quot;. Well known eclectics in Greek philosophy were the Stoics Panaetius and Posidonius, and the New Academics Carneades and Philo of Larissa. Among the Romans, Cicero was thoroughly eclectic, as he united the Peripatetic, Stoic, and New Academic doctrines. Philo&#x27;s successor and Cicero&#x27;s teacher Antiochus of Ascalon is credited with influencing the Academy so that it finally transitioned from Skepticism to Eclecticism. Other eclectics included Varro and Seneca the Younger.

According to RoÅ¡ker and Suhadolnik, however, even though eclecticism had a Greek origin, the term was rarely used and it was even given a negative connotation by historians of Greek thought, associating it with the description for impure and unoriginal thinking. Scholars such as Clement of Alexandria maintained that eclecticism had a long history in Greek philosophy and it is underpinned by a deeper metaphysical and theological conviction concerning the absolute/God as the source of all noble thoughts and that all parts of the truth can be found among the various philosophical systems.

==Usage==

===Architecture and art===

The term eclecticism is used to describe the combination, in a single work, of elements from different historical styles, chiefly in architecture and, by implication, in the fine and decorative arts. The term is sometimes also loosely applied to the general stylistic variety of 19th-century architecture after neoclassicism (), although the revivals of styles in that period have, since the 1970s, generally been referred to as aspects of historicism.

Eclecticism plays an important role in critical discussions and evaluations but is somehow distant from the actual forms of the artifacts to which it is applied, and its meaning is thus rather indistinct. The simplest definition of the termâthat every work of art represents the combination of a variety of influencesâis so basic as to be of little use. In some ways Eclecticism is reminiscent of Mannerism in that the term was used pejoratively for much of the period of its currency, although, unlike Mannerism, Eclecticism never amounted to a movement or constituted a specific style: it is characterized precisely by the fact that it was not a particular style.

===Martial arts===

Some martial arts can be described as eclectic in the sense that they borrow techniques from a wide variety of other martial arts.

===Philology===
In textual criticism, eclecticism is the practice of examining a wide number of text witnesses and selecting the variant that seems best. The result of the process is a text with readings drawn from many witnesses. In a purely eclectic approach, no single witness is theoretically favored. Instead, the critic forms opinions about individual witnesses, relying on both external and internal evidence.

Since the mid-19th century, eclecticism, in which there is no &quot;a priori&quot; bias to a single manuscript, has been the dominant method of editing the Greek text of the New Testament (currently, the United Bible Society, 4th ed. and Nestle-Ãland, 27th ed.). Even so, the oldest manuscripts, being of the Alexandrian text-type, are the most favored, and the critical text has an Alexandrian disposition.

===In Western philosophy===
In Hellenistic philosophy, the Eclectics used elements from multiple philosophies, texts, life experiences, and their own philosophical ideas. These ideas include life as connected with existence, knowledge, values, reason, mind, and language. This movement is closely associated with Middle Platonism. Eclectic thinkers thrived during the Roman Empire. According to the Catholic Encyclopedia, eclecticism &quot;aims at constructing a system broad and vague enough to include, or not to exclude, the principles of the divers schools, though giving at times more importance to those of one school&quot;. Roman Empire eclectic figures could belong to a specific philosophical schools while remaining eclectic and drawing on different traditions. Key figures include Asclepiades of Bithynia, Boethius, Panetius of Rhodes, Posidonius, Demetrius the Cynic, Demonax, Philo of Larissa, Antiochus of Ascalon, Andronicus of Rhodes, Aristocles, Alexander of Aphrodisias, Porphyry and Simplicius. 

Antiochus of Ascalon () was the pupil of Philo of Larissa, and the teacher of Cicero. Through his influence, Platonism transitioned from the Academic Skepticism of the New Academy to Eclecticism. Whereas Philo had adhered to the doctrine that there is nothing absolutely certain, Antiochus abandoned this to support dogmatism. Among his objections to skepticism was the consideration that without firm convictions no rational content of life is possible. Antiochus pointed out that it is a contradiction to assert that nothing can be asserted or to prove that nothing can be proved; that we cannot speak of false ideas and at the same time deny the distinction between false and true. He expounded the Academic, Peripatetic, and Stoic systems in such a way as to show that these three schools deviated from one another only in minor points. Antiochus was chiefly interested in ethics, in which he tried to find a middle way between Zeno of Citium, Aristotle, and Plato. For instance, he said that virtue suffices for eudaimonia, but for the highest grade of happiness, bodily and external goods are necessary as well.

This eclectic tendency was enabled by the fact that most of Plato&#x27;s works were non-dogmatic. Middle Platonism was promoted by the necessity of considering the main theories of the post-Platonic schools of philosophy, such as the Aristotelian logic and the Stoic psychology and ethics (theory of goods and emotions). On the one hand the Middle Platonists were engaged like the later Peripatetics in scholarly activities such as the exposition of Plato&#x27;s doctrines and the explanation of his dialogues; on the other hand they attempted to develop the Platonic theories systematically. In so far as it was subject in this to the influence of Neopythagoreanism, it was of considerable importance in preparing the way for Neoplatonism.

In modern philosophy, Victor Cousin was the founder of modern Eclecticism.

===Psychology===

Eclecticism is recognized in approaches to psychology that see many factors influencing behavior and cognition or psyche. In the 1970s, psychologists started using whichever approaches and techniques that they deemed appropriate for their client. They take multiple perspectives into consideration while identifying, explaining, and changing the behavior of the client.

=== In Asian thought and religion ===
Indian religions and philosophies are often eclectic, in the sense of drawing upon ideas and practices from diverse philosophical and religious traditions. Indian thought included a diversity of traditions, each with its own distinct teachings and practices, such as VedÄnta, SÄá¹khya, NyÄya, and Buddhism. These traditions have shown a remarkable ability to assimilate and adapt elements from one another. This tendency goes back to the Upaniá¹£ads, which incorporate and synthesize a wide array of ideas about the nature of reality, the self (Ätman), and the ultimate principle (Brahman). The Upaniá¹£ads do not represent a single, uniform doctrine but rather various perspectives.

Medieval India saw the rise of bhakti movements, which were also characterized by their eclectic use of varying philosophical ideas and religious practices, including VedÄnta, Tantra, and local folk practices. Similarly, the Sikh tradition exemplifies eclecticism by combining elements of bhakti Hinduism and Islam. Modern Hinduism is also the result of an eclectic process that brought together numerous philosophical and religious influences (Unifying Hinduism). Modern Hindu figures like Swami Vivekananda and Mahatma Gandhi continued this tradition of eclecticism. Vivekananda drew upon VedÄnta, SÄá¹khya-Yoga, and Western philosophy to present a universalist view of religion. Gandhi, influenced by Jain, Hindu, and Christian ideas, developed a unique philosophy of nonviolence (ahimsa) and social activism.

Indian Buddhism, especially the MahÄyÄna tradition is also notable for its openness to a wide range of philosophical ideas and practices. MahÄyÄna absorbed and reinterpreted concepts from earlier Buddhist schools while also integrating elements and deities from non-Buddhist traditions. The later Vajrayana Buddhist movement also drew on numerous Mahayana streams of thought as well as on Shaiva Tantra to develop its systems of thought and practice.

In a similar fashion, Chinese thought can also tend towards the harmonization of diverse philosophical and religious traditions, allowing for the coexistence and mutual influence of Confucianism, Daoism, Buddhism, and other indigenous beliefs. The three major Chinese religious and philosophical traditions - Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism - have been coexisting and interacting with one another for over two millennia. The synthesis of the &quot;Three Teachings&quot; (Confucianism, Daoism, and Buddhism) became increasingly pronounced in later periods of Chinese history. The Song dynasty (960â1279 CE) witnessed the rise of Neo-Confucianism, a movement that sought to revitalize Confucian thought in response to the growing influence of Buddhism and Daoism. Neo-Confucian thinkers such as Zhu Xi and Wang Yangming developed more systematic and metaphysical systems which drew upon other systems of thought, including Buddhism. In the modern era, intellectuals of the late Qing dynasty and the Republican period, such as Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, sought to integrate Western philosophical ideas with traditional Chinese thought. In contemporary China, there is a renewed interest in Confucianism, often blended with elements of modernity and other philosophical systems to address current social and ethical issues.

<doc id="243413" wikidata="Q104813448" url="?curid=243413" title="Social class in the United States">
<text>Social class in the United States refers to the idea of grouping Americans by some measure of social status, typically by economic status. However, it could also refer to social status and/or location. The idea that American society can be divided into social classes is disputed, and there are many competing class systems.

Many Americans believe in a social class system that has three different groups or classes: the American rich (upper class), the American middle class, and the American poor. More complex models propose as many as a dozen class levels, including levels such as high upper class, upper class, upper middle class, middle class, lower middle class, working class, and lower class, while others disagree with the American construct of social class completely. Most definitions of a class structure group its members according to wealth, income, education, type of occupation, and membership within a hierarchy, specific subculture, or social network. Most concepts of American social class do not focus on race or ethnicity as a characteristic within the stratification system, although these factors are closely related.

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, Joseph Hickey, and James Henslin have proposed class systems with six distinct social classes. These class models feature an upper or capitalist class consisting of the rich and powerful, an upper middle class consisting of highly educated and affluent professionals, a middle class consisting of college-educated individuals employed in white-collar industries, a lower middle class composed of semi-professionals with typically some college education, a working class constituted by clerical and blue collar workers, whose work is highly routinized, and a lower class, divided between the working poor and the unemployed underclass.

==Markers==

Some definitions of class look only at numerical measures, such as wealth or income. Others take into account qualitative factors, such as education, culture, and social status. There is no consensus on which of these variables is essential and which are merely common correlates.

Social class is sometimes presented as a description of how members of the society have sorted themselves along a continuum of positions varying in importance, influence, prestige, and compensation. It is disputed whether sharp lines can be drawn for social classes. One point of view in the debate is:

===Social status===

In some models, certain occupations are considered to be desirable and influential, while others are considered to be menial, repetitive, and unpleasant. (In some cases, non-occupational roles such as a parent or volunteer mentor, are also considered.) Generally, the higher the ranking on such a scale, the higher the skill and education levels required to perform it.

Some sociologists consider the higher income and prestige of higher ranked jobs to simply be incentives to encourage members of society to obtain the skills necessary to perform important work. This is an important mechanism in the economic theory of capitalism and is compatible with the notion that class is mutable and determined by a combination of choices and opportunities.

In other cases, class or status is inherited. For example, being the son or daughter of a wealthy individual, may carry a higher status and different cultural connotations than being a member of nouveau riche (&quot;new money&quot;) or have a planned path of positive freedom. Those taking the functionalist approach to sociology and economics view social classes as components essential for the survival of complex societies, such as American society.

Assortative mating in humans has been widely observed and studied. It includes the tendency of humans to prefer to mate within their socio-economic peers, that is, those with similar social standing, job prestige, educational attainment, or economic background as they themselves. This tendency has always been present in society: there was no historical area when most of the individuals preferred to sort, and had actually sorted, negatively into couples or matched, randomly, along these traits. This trend is evidenced by the search criteria of online dating site users.

A 2022 study suggested that factors that contribute to low levels of intergenerational mobility in the United States include a disparity in returns to human capital, low levels of public investment in the human capital of low-income children, high levels of socioeconomic residential segregation, and low levels of progressiveness in the tax-and-transfer system.

===Income===
Income in the United States is most commonly measured by United States Census Bureau in terms of either household or individual and remains one of the most prominent indicators of class status. As 82% of all households, 16% of those in the top quintiles, had two income earners the discrepancy between household and personal income is quite considerable. while the median personal income (including only those above the age of 25) was $32,140.

Per capita household income, the income a household is able to allocate to each member of the household is also an important variable in determining a given household&#x27;s standard of living. A high household income may be offset by a large household size; thus, resulting in a low per capita household income.

In the passage above, Davis and Moore argue that income is one of the most prominent features of social class; it is not one of its causes. In other words, income does not determine the status of an individual or household but rather reflects on that status. Some say that income and prestige are the incentives provided by society in order to fill needed positions with the most qualified and motivated personnel possible.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; has used income quintiles to define class. It has assigned the quintiles from lowest to highest as lower class, lower middle class, middle class, upper middle class, and upper class. These definitions equate class with income, permitting people to move from class to class as their income changes.

====Dual income controversy====
Income is one of the most commonly used attributes of a household to determine its class status. The relationship between income, which mostly arises from the scarcity of a certain skill, may however, prove to be more complex than initially perceived. While the idea is that income reflects status, household income may just be the product of two or more incomes.

In 2005, 42% of American households had two or more income earners. The vast majority (77%) of households in the top quintile had two or more income earners. This means that the majority of household income in the top quintile are the result of two income earners pooling their resources, establishing a close link between perceived affluence and the number of income earners in a given household. This raises the question of whether or not the combination of incomes results in higher social status. Of course, there is no definite answer as class is a vague sociological concept.

Sociologist Dennis Gilbert states that it is possible for households to out-earn other households over higher class standing through increasing their number of income earners. He furthermore states that household size also played an essential role, as the standard of living for two persons living off one upper middle class personal income may very well be higher than that of a household with four members living off two working class personal incomes.

The combination of two or more incomes allows for households to increase their income substantially without moving higher on the occupational ladder or attaining higher educational degrees. The favorable economic position of households in the top two quintiles is in some cases the result of combined income, rather than demand for a single worker.

===Education===


Tertiary education (or &quot;higher education&quot;) is required for many middle-class professions, depending on how the term middle class is to be defined. Tertiary education is rarely free, but the costs vary, widely. Tuition at elite private colleges often exceeds $200,000 for a four-year program, although financial aid may be significant. On the other hand, public colleges and universities typically charge much less, particularly for state residents.

Also, scholarships offered by universities and government do exist, and low-interest loans are available. Still, the average cost of education, by all accounts, is increasing. The attainment of post-secondary and graduate degrees is, perhaps, the most important feature of a middle and upper middle class person, with the university being regarded as the most essential institution and gatekeeper of the professional middle class. Educational attainment is also directly linked to income. Per the table below in this section, as of 2018 less than 40% of American adults over the age of 25 had a Bachelor&#x27;s degree or higher.

Although 90% of the population has graduated from high school, the average American does not have a college degree but has likely attended college for some time. Overall, educational attainment serves, perhaps, as the most essential class feature of most Americans, being directly linked to income and occupation.

==Culture==

Broadly speaking, the United States aspires to be an egalitarian country with social mobility; the American Dream includes the idea from the Declaration of Independence that &quot;all men are created equal&quot; and have the &quot;unalienable right&quot; to &quot;Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness&quot;. The phrase &quot;second-class citizen&quot; has a strong negative connotation in national politics.

In practice, socioeconomic mobility in the United States is relatively low, compared to Nordic countries and Canada, and income inequality in the United States is relatively high. Educational attainment and income are strongly correlated, but relatively low funding for K-12 schools in poor neighborhoods raises concerns about a cycle of poverty. These apparent contradictions lead to divergent views on whether American society is divided into distinct classes or should be analyzed that way.

According to a 2021 study, in the United States, 50% of a father&#x27;s income position is inherited by his son. In contrast, the amount in Norway and Canada is less than 20%. Moreover, in the U.S. 8% of children raised in the bottom 20% of the income distribution are able to climb to the top 20% as adults, while the figure in Denmark is nearly double at 15%. According to an academic study on why Americans overestimate class mobility, &quot;research indicates that errors in social perception are driven by both informational factorsâsuch as the lack of awareness of statistical information relevant to actual mobility trendsâand motivational factorsâthe desire to believe that society is meritocratic.&quot; Americans are more inclined to believe in meritocracy out of the prospect that they will one day join the elite or upper class. Scholars have paralleled this belief to John Steinbeck&#x27;s notable quote that &quot;the poor see themselves not as an exploited proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires.â

Explanations for the relatively low level of social mobility in the US include: the better access of affluent children to superior schools and preparation for schools, which is important in an economy where pay is tilted toward educated workers; high levels of immigration of unskilled laborers and low rate of unionization, which leads to lower wages among the least skilled; public health problems, such as obesity and diabetes, which can limit education and employment; the sheer size of the income gap between the rich which makes it harder to climb the proverbial income ladder when the rungs are farther apart; and poverty, since those with low income have significantly lower rates of mobility than middle and higher income individuals.

===Studies===

In 2012, Charles Murray described what he saw as the economic divide and social bifurcation of Americans that has occurred since 1960 in his book, &quot;Coming Apart: The State of White America, 1960â2010&quot;. Murray described diverging trends between upper and lower class white Americans in the half century, after the death of John F. Kennedy. He focused on white Americans to argue that economic decline in that period was not experienced solely by minorities, whom he brings into his argument in the last few chapters of the book. He argued that class strain had cleaved white Americans into two distinct, highly segregated strata: &quot;an upper class, defined by educational attainment, and a new lower class, characterized by the lack of it.&quot; Much of his argument is centered on a notion of self-selective sorting that began in the 1960s and 1970s, when people overwhelmingly began marrying and living in areas surrounded largely by people of similar socioeconomic characteristics, leading to not only an exacerbation of existing economic divides, but an unprecedented socio-cultural divide that had not existed before in America.

French economist Thomas Piketty specializes in economic inequality by taking a historic and statistical approach. Piketty&#x27;s 2019 book &quot;Capital and Ideology&quot; argues that inequality is a social phenomenon, driven by human institutions. Institutional change, in turn, reflects the ideology that dominates society: &quot;Inequality is neither economic nor technological; it is ideological and political.&quot; In one example, Piketty highlights how during the Belle Ãpoque (1871-1914) in the French Third Republic, economic inequality was just as high as during the Ancien rÃ©gime before the French Revolution, despite the monarchy being abolished and France industrializing. It was only after the world wars that France adopted a welfare state.

In 2019, Daniel Markovits published the book &quot;The Meritocracy Trap&quot;, in which he argued that meritocracy was the center of rising economic inequality and social and political dysfunction. Markovits argued that &quot;meritocracy excludes people outside of the elite, excludes middle class people and working class people from schooling, from good jobs, and from status and income, and then insults them by saying that the reason theyâre excluded is that they donât measure up, rather than that thereâs a structural block to their inclusion.&quot; Furthermore, Markovits explicitly denounces the myth of the purported &quot;American meritocracy&quot;, which for him &quot;has become precisely what it was invented to combat: a mechanism for the dynastic transmission of wealth and privilege across generations.&quot; The minority of individuals who manage to overcome structural conditions and achieve upward class mobility are used as examples to support the idea that meritocracy exists, which is an example of survival bias.

===Social norms===
Once defined, social classes can be considered to feature their own sub-cultures, including different ways of socializing children. Social classes form social groups so large that they feature considerable diversity within and any statement regarding a given social class&#x27; culture needs to be seen as a broad generalization. Parental views are, perhaps, the most essential factor in determining the socialization process which shapes new members of society. The values and standards used in child rearing are commonly closely related to the parent&#x27;s occupational status.

The strongest cultural differences seem to run along the professional middle class-working class divide. A recent increase in residential class segregation and the overall tendency of individual to associate mostly with those of equal standing as themselves has further strengthened class differences.

Parents from the professional class tend to raise their children to become curious, independent thinkers, while working-class parents raise their children to have a more communal perspective, with a strong respect for authority. Middle-class parents tend to emphasize internal standards and values, while working-class parents emphasize external values.

Sociologist Dennis Gilbert uses a list of values identified by Melvin Kohn to be typical of the professional middle and working class. Middle-class parents&#x27; values for their children and themselves included: &quot;Consideration of Others, Self-Control, Curiosity, Happiness, Honesty, Tolerance of , Open to Innovation, Self-Direction.&quot; This contrasted with surveyed working class individuals, who reported: &quot;Manners, Obedience, Neatness, Cleanliness, Strong Punishment of Deviant Behavior, Stock to Old Ways, People not Trustworthy, Strict Leadership&quot; as values for themselves and their children. There is a strong correlation between these values and the occupational activities of the respondents. The job characteristics of middle class respondents included: &quot;Work Independently, Varied Tasks, Work with People or Data,&quot; versus working-class parents of reported &quot;Close Supervision and Repetitive Work.&quot;

Gender roles are also viewed differently by those in the higher and lower social classes. Middle class individuals, who were more open towards &quot;nonconformity&quot; and emphasized individual self-direction as well as critical thinking, were also less stringent in their application of gender roles. Working class individuals, on the other hand, emphasized gender roles. While working-class people have more and more assimilated to middle class culture regarding their view and application of gender roles, differences remain. Professional class people are more likely to have an egalitarian distribution of work in their household with both spouses being equals in heterosexual marriages. According to Dennis Gilbert, &quot;College life, generally a prologue to upper-middle class careers, delays marriage and encourages informal, relatively egalitarian association between men and women.&quot;

==Academic models==
In a 2018 Gallup poll, 2% of Americans self-identified as upper class, 16% as upper-middle class, 43% as middle class, 30% as working class, and 9% as lower class. According to &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot;, the top 10% of earners were responsible for half of all spending in 2025.

===Gilbert model (2018)===

The six social classes that provide the basis for the Gilbert model are determined based on the assumption of how class structure develops out of the economic system. They are delineated by household income, and characterized by factors such as workplace autonomy and educational attainment. Although the social hierarchy is most obvious at the extremes, the differences between classes begin to become blurred when moving away from one of the extremes and towards the centre to where the lower middle and working classes are. Gilbert instead argues that the cleavage of the top two &quot;privileged classes&quot; from the bottom four classes is the most important division.

====Capitalist class (Top 1%)====

&quot;(Typical income: $1.5 million, mostly from assets)&quot;
These include heirs, top executives of large corporations, and owners of large, privately held companies. They primarily earn income from assets that they directly control, such as by being on the board of directors of their businesses.

Even though the capitalist class is a very small class of super-rich capitalists at the top of the hierarchy, its impact on the economy and society is far beyond their numbers. These people contribute their money to political parties and are often owners of newspapers or television stations. They have investments that affect millions of people in the labour force. They tend to only associate with other people from their own class, rarely interacting with people with below-average incomes. Even their children are usually segregated, attending only the most elite preparatory schools and universities.

====Upper middle class (Next 14%)====

&quot;(Typical income $200,000; for Working rich $500,000)&quot;
Gilbert describes the growing segment of the &quot;working rich&quot; as still part of the upper middle class, consisting of affluent professionals (i.e. law and medicine) and highly successful small business owners. These are the next 14%, and are not considered part of the capitalist class because they still primarily earn income from employment in their jobs, or partnership and self-employment in their businesses, not asset ownership.

The upper middle class is the group in society most shaped by higher education. A bachelor&#x27;s degree is usually required, and graduate studies and professional degrees are becoming increasingly required. People in this class include professionals, managers, officials, and small business owners. Children in high school strive to prepare themselves for upper-middle-class jobs because these types of jobs are symbols of success. Upper-middle-class people are able to purchase status symbols such as spacious homes. They are convinced that they deserve what they have achieved and are mostly satisfied that they have achieved a proper share of the American dream.

====Lower middle class (Next 30%)====
&quot;(Typical income $85,000)&quot;
Almost all in the middle class have attended an institute of tertiary education, though some didn&#x27;t graduate with degrees. The most educated will become semi-professionals (i.e. teachers), or have low-level managerial jobs. Skilled technicians and tradespeople are also included in this social class. Their jobs require significant skill, are somewhat supervised, and are fairly well paid. Gilbert estimates that about a third of the population is lower middle class.

====Working class (Next 25%)====
&quot;(Typical income $40,000)&quot;
The core of the working class is made up of semi-skilled machine operators, low-paid craftsmen, clerical workers, and retail salespeople. These include both blue-collar and pink-collar jobs. A high school diploma is usually required, and some attended but did not graduate from college. Their tasks are habitual and mechanized, with brief on-the-job training, and are closely supervised. It is estimated that this class includes roughly one-fourth of the population.

====Working-poor class (Next 15%)====
&quot;(Typical Income: $25,000)&quot;
The working poor class includes unskilled labourers, many pink-collar jobs, and lower-paid factory workers. Income depends on the number of workers in the family and the number of weeks that they work. Some have not finished high school. Unable to save money and when retired the working poor depend heavily on their social security pensions to live.

====Underclass (Bottom 15%)====
&quot;(Typical Income $15,000)&quot;
These people are under-employed. They suffer from low education, low employability, and/or low income. Some can not work because of their age or disability. Hard times might be magnified because they belong to a minority group who suffers discrimination in the workforce.

===Older models (2000s)===
The following are reported income-, education-, and occupation-based terms for specific classes commonly used by sociologists. Note that income levels are from the 2000s, and not adjusted for inflation.



==Upper class==

The term upper class is applied to a wide array of elite groups existing in the United States of America. Because there is no defined lower threshold for the upper class it is difficult, if not outright impossible, to determine the exact number or percentage of American households that could be identified as being members of the upper-class(es). Most sociologists use the richest 1% of the population, but others use different benchmarks and characteristics.

Income and wealth statistics may serve as a helpful guideline as they can be measured in a more objective manner. Members of the upper class control and own significant portions of corporate America, and may exercise indirect power through the investment of capital. The high salaries and the potential for amassing great wealth through stock options have greatly increased the power and visibility of the &quot;corporate elite&quot;.

===Sources of wealth===
====Inherited wealth====
Yet another important feature of the upper class is that of inherited privilege. While most Americans, including those in the upper-middle class, need to actively maintain their status, some upper class persons do not need to work in order to maintain their status. Status tends to be passed on from generation to generation without each generation having to re-certify its status. Overall, the upper class is financially the best compensated and one of the most influential socio-economic classes in American society.

====Private companies====
The upper class also includes owners of large private companies, including private equity companies. Privately held companies generally have fewer or less comprehensive reporting requirements and obligations for transparency than publicly traded companies do, thus making information about the income and wealth of their owners less well-known.

====Corporate elite====
The high salaries and, especially, the potential wealth through stock options, has supported the term &quot;corporate elite&quot; or corporate class. Top executives, including Chief Executive Officers, are among the financially best compensated occupations in the United States.

Top corporate executives of publicly traded companies receive most of their compensation by owning shares and stock options in their companies, on top of their substantial salaries. They are also on the board of directors with direct influence over their companies, not merely retail investors.

===Categories of wealth===
Wealth is commonly measured in terms of net worth, which is the sum of all assets minus all liabilities. Homeownership can contribute to wealth, but high-net worth individuals have their net worth primarily concentrated in illiquid assets such as bonds, real estate, and shares of corporations whose valuations are estimates.

Individuals with considerable net worth are described in the financial services industry as high-net-worth individuals, very-high-net-worth individuals, and ultra high-net-worth individuals:
*High-net-worth individuals (HNWI) are defined as holding financial assets (excluding their primary residence) valued over US$1 million.
* A very-high-net-worth individual (VHNWI) refers to someone with a net worth of at least US$5 million. 
* An ultra-high-net-worth individual (UHNWI), holds US$30 million in investible assets.

The two charts in this section show the average net worth of individuals in the top 1%, top 10%, 50th to 90th percentile, and bottom half of the population from 1962 to 2021. As of 2021, the average person in the top 10% is a HNWI, while the average person in the top 1% is a VHNWI.

===Upper class versus rich===
In some academic models, the rich are considered to constitute 5% of U.S. households, and their wealth is largely in the form of financial assets, such as stocks, bonds, real estate, and private businesses. Sociologist Dennis Gilbert calls them the &quot;working rich&quot;, and argues that this group is not part of the upper class but rather part of the upper middle class, as its standard of living is largely derived from occupation-generated income and its affluence falls far short of that attained by the top 1%.

Sociologist Leonard Beeghley considers total wealth to be the only significant distinguishing feature of this class and refers to the upper class simply as &quot;the rich.&quot; Beeghley divides the rich into two sub-groups: the rich and the super-rich. The super-rich, according to Beeghley, are those able to live off their wealth without depending on occupation-derived income. This demographic constitutes roughly 1% of American households. Beeghley&#x27;s definition of the super-rich is congruent with the definition of upper class used by most other sociologists.

==Main classes==
===Upper middle class===

The upper middle class consists of highly educated salaried professionals and small business owners whose work is largely self-directed. Many have advanced graduate degrees, and members of this class commonly value higher education. They are often involved with personal and professional networks, including professional organizations. The upper middle class tends to have great influence over the course of society.

Occupations which require high educational attainment are usually well compensated and held in high public esteem. Physicians, lawyers, accountants, engineers, scientists and professors are largely considered to be upper middle class. The very well educated are seen as trendsetters; the anti-smoking, pro-fitness, and organic food movements, as well as environmentalism, are largely indigenous to this socio-economic grouping. Education serves as perhaps the most important value and also the most dominant entry barrier of the upper middle class.

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, Willam Thompson, and Joseph Hickey estimate the upper middle class to constitute roughly 15% of the population (or roughly three in every twenty persons). The hallmark of this class is its high educational attainment.

===Middle class===

The middle class is perhaps the most vaguely defined of the social classes. The term can be used either to describe a relative elite of professionals and managers â also called the upper middle class â or it can be used to describe those in-between the extremes of wealth, disregarding considerable differences in income, culture, educational attainment, influence, and occupation.

As with all social classes in the United States, there are no definite answers as to what is and what is not middle class. Sociologists such as Dennis Gilbert, James Henslin, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey have brought forth class models in which the middle class is divided into two sections that combined constitute 47% to 49% of the population. The upper middle or professional class constitutes the upper end of the middle class which consists of highly educated, well-paid professionals with considerable work autonomy. The lower end of the middle class â called either lower middle class or just middle class â consists of semi-professionals, craftsmen, office staff, and sales employees who often have college degrees and are very loosely supervised.
Everyone wants to believe they are middle class. For people on the bottom and the top of the wage scale the phrase connotes a certain Regular Joe cachet. But this eagerness to be part of the group has led the definition to be stretched like a bungee cord.

â Dante Chinni, the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot;
====Traditional middle class====

Those households more or less at the center of society may be referred to as being part of the American middle or middle-middle class in vernacular language use. In the academic models featured in this article, however, the middle class does not constitute a strong majority of the population. Those in the middle of the socio-economic strataâthe proverbial Average Joeâare commonly in the area where the working and lower middle class overlap.

The most prominent academic models split the middle class into two sections. Yet, it remains common for the term middle class to be applied for anyone in between either extreme of the socio-economic strata. The middle class is then often sub-divided into an upper-middle, middle-middle, and lower-middle class. In colloquial descriptions of the class system the middle-middle class may be described as consisting of those in the middle of the social strata.

Politicians and television personalities such as Lou Dobbs have used the term middle class in this manner, especially when discussing the middle-class squeeze. The wide discrepancy between the academic models and public opinions that lump highly educated professionals together in the same class with secretaries may lead to the conclusion that public opinion on the subject has become largely ambiguous.

====Lower middle class====
The lower middle class is, as the name implies, generally defined as those who occupy the lower portion of the middle class. People in this class commonly work in supporting occupations that are closely supervised but require significant training, such as tradespeople, sales agents, and semiprofessionals. 
:The terms &quot;skilled worker,&quot; &quot;craftsman,&quot; &quot;artisan,&quot; and &quot;tradesman&quot; were used in senses that overlap. All describe people with specialized training in the skills needed for a particular kind of work. ... Skilled workers in the building trades (e.g. carpenters, masons, plumbers, painters, plasterers, glaziers) were also referred to by one or another of these terms.

Sociologists Dennis Gilbert, William Thompson, and Joseph Hickey, however, only divide the middle class into two groups. In their class modes the middle class only consists of an upper and lower middle class. The upper middle class, as described above, constitutes roughly 15% of the population with highly educated white collar professionals. Semi-professionals and tradespeople with some college degrees constitute the lower middle class. Their class models show the lower middle class positioned slightly above the middle of the socio-economic strata.

===Working class and lower class===
Definitions of the term &quot;working class&quot; vary greatly. Michael Zweig, an economist for Stony Brook University, argued in 2001 that the working class constitutes the majority of the population. Economists and pollsters in the United States generally define working class adults as those lacking tertiary education degrees. This is an oxymoron when applied to those lacking degrees but are unemployed or retired, and therefore not working. According to Frank Newport, &quot;for some, working class is a more literal label; namely, an indication that one is working.&quot; Generally, those in blue-collar and pink-collar occupations are referred to as working class in the class models referred to in this article.

Dennis Gilbert places 13% of households among the &quot;working poor&quot; with 12% being in the &quot;underclass&quot;. Thompson &amp; Hickey place roughly 17% to 20% of households in the lower classes. The lower classes constituting roughly a fifth to a quarter of American society consists mainly of low-rung retail and service workers as well as the frequently unemployed and those not able to work. Overall, 13% of the population fall below the poverty threshold. Hunger and food insecurity were present in the lives of 3.9% of American households, while roughly twenty-five million Americans (ca. 9%) participated in the food stamp program.

==Occupations==
Some sociologists attempt to draw a distinction between laborers, tradespeople, and professionals, when creating class systems.
* &quot;Laborers&quot; such as bus drivers, truck drivers, cleaning laborers, and landscapers &quot;rely heavily on physical exertion,&quot; while those in the skilled trades rely on and are known for &quot;specific knowledge, skills, and abilities.&quot; 
* &quot;Tradespeople&quot; usually gain their skills through work experience, on-the-job training, an apprenticeship program, and certification. 
* &quot;Professionals&quot; require substantial education, typically at least a bachelor&#x27;s degree and often graduate degrees, and have a higher duty of care. They routinely make decisions &quot;on the basis of expertise and ability in complex situations, where there may be no, or little, previous history.&quot;

===Examples of laborers===
Unskilled blue-collar labor includes warehousing, mining, excavation, custodial work, farming, fishing, logging, landscaping, pest control, food processing, oil field work, waste collection and disposal, recycling, construction, maintenance, shipping, driving, and trucking.

Unskilled pink-collar labor includes the hairstylists, cosmetology, waiting staff, domestic workers, receptionist, social work, secretarial work, and child care.

===Examples of trades===
* Carpentry - woodworking, framing, doors/windows, drywall, insulation, flooring, siding, finishing work, cabinetry, furniture.
* Plumbing - plumbing fixtures, piping and plumbing fitting, water heater, steamfitter, GreenPlumbers, and drain cleaner.
* Electrician - wiring, light fixture/major appliance, solar power installation, electric motor/generator technician, electronics technician.
* Welding - MIG, TIG, stick, welding joints, welding symbols, and metalworking.
* Masonry - concrete work, bricks/blocks/stones, troweling, and tiling.
* HVAC - heating, ventilation, air conditioning, and duct work.
* Painting - staining, wallpaper, paint mixing, plasterwork, and spackling paste.
* Roofing - shingles, standing seam metal roof, corrugated metal roof, solar roofs, rubber shingles, rain gutters.
* Mechanic - auto mechanic/restoration/scrapping, refrigeration/air conditioning, boiler, millwright/industrial mechanic.
* Metal fabrication - machinist, lathes, milling, drilling, grinding, and CNC machining.
* Sewing - machine sewing, hand stitching, embroidery, tailor, quilting, fashion design, costume design, 3D clothes modeling, upholstery, knitting, tapestry, crochet.
* Culinary chef - baker, meat cutter\fishmonger, deli, cheesemonger, sushi itamae, and cook.

===Examples of professions===
Highly educated white collar professionals include physicians, dentists, lawyers, accountants, engineers, military officers, economists, business analysis, urban planners, university professors, architects, stockbrokers, psychologists, scientists, actuaries, optometrists, statistician, speech-language pathologist, occupational therapist, physical therapists, pharmacists, veterinarians, high-level civil servants, architects, and the intelligentsia.

==Class and health==

Income also has a significant impact on health as those with higher incomes have better access to healthcare facilities, higher life expectancy, lower infant mortality rate and increased health consciousness. In 2006, Harvard researchers divided the United States into &quot;eight Americas.&quot; A 2024 study from University of Washington researchers added two more segments to make it &quot;ten Americas&quot;.

Life expectancy ranges from 84.9 years for Asian Americans who had an average per capita income of $21,566, to 71.1 years for urban African-Americans with an average per capita income of $14,800.

Furthermore, like other post-industrial nations, the United States saw increased health consciousness among persons of higher social status. Persons of higher status are less likely to smoke, more likely to exercise regularly, and be more conscious of their diet. Additionally, poorer Americans are more likely to consume lower quality, processed foods. One can therefore conclude that low socio-economic status contributes to a person&#x27;s likelihood of being obese.

==Class and politics==

Many politically powerful people make money before coming to office, but in general the political power elite have official incomes in the $150,000 to $185,000 range; members of Congress are paid $174,000, and are effectively required to have a residence in their district as well as one in Washington.

The relationship between class and politics is less about partisan affiliation and more about the level of political influence. Those in the upper class and upper middle class have the greatest influence. According to Pew Research, nearly all members of the 118th Congress had a Bachelor&#x27;s degree, specifically 94% in the House and 99% in the Senate. This was far higher than the 38% of American adults age 25+ with a Bachelor&#x27;s degree in 2023. Using the Gilbert Model described earlier, as well as the fact the congressional salary is $174,000 a year, members of the United States Congress can classified as members of the upper middle class and upper class.

==Existence of distinct class groupings==
Some academics consider American society sociologically and economically fragmented in such a manner that no clear class distinctions can be made. This means that there are no pronounced breaks in socioeconomic strata, which makes class division highly subjective and disputable. Others, such as sociologist Dennis Gilbert, dispute the concept of a well-mixed society, and claim that distinct social networks can be identified for each class. W. Lloyd Warner also asserts the existence of class markers:

Warner asserts that social class is as old as civilization itself and has been present in nearly every society from before the Roman Empire, through medieval times, and to the modern-day United States. He believes that complex societies such as the United States need an equally complex social hierarchy.

<text>John Len Chatman (September 3, 1915 â February 24, 1988), known professionally as Memphis Slim, was an American blues pianist, singer, and composer. He led a series of bands that, reflecting the popular appeal of jump blues, included saxophones, bass, drums, and piano. A song he first cut in 1947, &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues&quot;, has become a blues standard, recorded by many other artists. He made over 500 recordings.

He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1989.

==Biography==

Memphis Slim was born John Len Chatman, in Memphis, Tennessee. For his first recordings, for Okeh Records in 1940, he used the name of his father, Peter Chatman (who sang, played piano and guitar, and operated juke joints); it is commonly believed that he did so to honor his father. He started performing under the name &quot;Memphis Slim&quot; later that year but continued to publish songs under the name Peter Chatman.

He spent most of the 1930s performing in honky-tonks, dance halls, and gambling joints in West Memphis, Arkansas, and southeast Missouri. He settled in Chicago in 1939 and began teaming with the guitarist and singer Big Bill Broonzy in clubs soon afterwards. In 1940 and 1941, he recorded two songs for Bluebird Records that became part of his repertoire for decades, &quot;Beer Drinking Woman&quot; and &quot;Grinder Man Blues&quot;. These were released under the name &quot;Memphis Slim,&quot; given to him by Bluebird&#x27;s producer, Lester Melrose. Slim became a regular session musician for Bluebird, and his piano talents supported established stars such as John Lee &quot;Sonny Boy&quot; Williamson, Washboard Sam, and Jazz Gillum. Many of Slim&#x27;s recordings and performances until the mid-1940s were with Broonzy, who had recruited Slim to be his piano player after the death of his accompanist Joshua Altheimer in 1940.

After World War II, Slim began leading bands that generally included saxophones, bass, drums, and piano, reflecting the popular appeal of jump blues. With the decline of blues recording by the major labels, Slim worked with emerging independent labels. Starting in late 1945, he recorded with trios for the small Chicago-based Hy-Tone Records. With a lineup of alto saxophone, tenor sax, piano, and string bass (Willie Dixon played the instrument on the first session), he signed with the Miracle label in the fall of 1946. One of the songs recorded at the first session was the ebullient boogie &quot;Rockin&#x27; the House,&quot; from which his band would take its name. Slim and the House Rockers recorded mainly for Miracle through 1949, with some commercial success. Among the songs they recorded were &quot;Messin&#x27; Around&quot; (which reached number one on the R&amp;B charts in 1948) and &quot;Harlem Bound&quot;. In 1947, the day after producing a concert by Slim, Broonzy, and Williamson at New York City&#x27;s Town Hall, the folklorist Alan Lomax brought the three musicians to the Decca Records studios and recorded with Slim on vocal and piano. Lomax presented sections of this recording on BBC Radio in the early 1950s as a documentary, &quot;The Art of the Negro&quot;, and later released an expanded version as the LP &quot;Blues in the Mississippi Night&quot;. In 1949, Slim expanded his combo to a quintet by adding a drummer; the group was now spending most of its time on tour, leading to off-contract recording sessions for King Records in Cincinnati and Peacock Records in Houston.

One of Slim&#x27;s 1947 recordings for Miracle, released in 1949, was originally titled &quot;Nobody Loves Me&quot;. It has become famous as &quot;Every Day I Have the Blues.&quot; The song was recorded in 1950 by Lowell Fulson and subsequently by numerous other artists, including B. B. King, Elmore James, T-Bone Walker, Ray Charles, Eric Clapton, Natalie Cole, Ella Fitzgerald, Jimi Hendrix, Mahalia Jackson, Sarah Vaughan, Carlos Santana, John Mayer and Lou Rawls. Joe Williams recorded it in 1952 for Checker Records; his remake from 1956 (included on the album &quot;Count Basie Swings, Joe Williams Sings&quot;) was inducted into the Grammy Hall of Fame in 1992.

Early in 1950, Miracle succumbed to financial troubles, but its owners regrouped to form the Premium label, and Slim remained on board until the successor company faltered in the summer of 1951. His February 1951 session for Premium saw two changes in the House Rockers&#x27; lineup: Slim started using two tenor saxophones instead of the alto and tenor combination, and he made a trial of adding the guitarist Ike Perkins. His last session for Premium kept the two-tenor lineup but dispensed with the guitar. During his time with Premium, Slim first recorded his song &quot;Mother Earth&quot;.

Slim made just one session for King, but the company bought his Hy-Tone sides in 1948 and acquired his Miracle masters after that company failed in 1950. He was never a Chess artist, but Leonard Chess bought most of the Premium masters after the demise of Premium.

After a year with Mercury Records, Slim signed with United Records in Chicago; the A&amp;R man, Lew Simpkins, knew him from Miracle and Premium. The timing was propitious, because he had just added the guitarist Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy to his group. He remained with United through the end of 1954, when the company began to cut back on blues recording.

After 1954, Slim did not have a steady relationship with a record company until 1958, when he signed with Vee-Jay Records. In 1959 his band, still featuring Murphy, recorded the album &quot;Memphis Slim at the Gate of the Horn&quot;, which featured a lineup of his best-known songs, including &quot;Mother Earth&quot;, &quot;Gotta Find My Baby&quot;, &quot;Rockin&#x27; the Blues&quot;, &quot;Steppin&#x27; Out&quot;, and &quot;Slim&#x27;s Blues&quot;. In December 1959, Willie Dixon&#x27;s debut album, &quot;Willie&#x27;s Blues&quot;, was released. Memphis Slim was given almost equal credit on the album as Dixon&#x27;s piano accompanist. Memphis Slim played on all of the tracks, and wrote the two numbers that were not penned by Dixon.

Slim first appeared outside the United States in 1960, touring with Willie Dixon, with whom he returned to Europe in 1962 as a featured artist in the first of the series of American Folk Festival concerts organized by Dixon, which brought many notable blues artists to Europe in the 1960s and 1970s. The duo released several albums together on Folkways Records, including &quot;Memphis Slim and Willie Dixon at the Village Gate with Pete Seeger&quot; (1962).

In 1962, Slim moved permanently to Paris, and his engaging personality and well-honed presentation of playing, singing, and storytelling about the blues secured his position as one of the most prominent blues artists for nearly three decades. He appeared on television in numerous European countries, acted in several French films and wrote the score for &quot;Ã nous deux France&quot; (1970), and performed regularly in Paris, throughout Europe, and on return visits to the United States. In the last years of his life, he teamed up with the respected jazz drummer George Collier. The two toured Europe together and became friends. After Collier died in August 1987, Slim rarely appeared in public, although he reunited with Matt &quot;Guitar&quot; Murphy for a gig at Antone&#x27;s in Austin, Texas, in 1987.

Two years before his death, Slim was named a Commander in the Ordre des Arts et des Lettres by the Ministry of Culture of the Republic of France. In addition, the U.S. Senate honored Slim with the title of Ambassador-at-Large of Good Will. 

Memphis Slim died of renal failure on February 24, 1988, in Paris, at the age of 72. He is buried at Galilee Memorial Gardens in Memphis, Tennessee.

He was posthumously inducted into the Blues Hall of Fame in 1989. He was inducted into the Memphis Music Hall of Fame in 2015.

<doc id="243420" wikidata="Q175898" url="?curid=243420" title="Avalanche diode">
<text>In electronics, an avalanche diode is a diode (made from silicon or other semiconductor) that is designed to experience avalanche breakdown at a specified reverse bias voltage. The junction of an avalanche diode is designed to prevent current concentration and resulting hot spots, so that the diode is undamaged by the breakdown. The avalanche breakdown is due to minority carriers accelerated enough to create ionization in the crystal lattice, producing more carriers, which in turn create more ionization. Because the avalanche breakdown is uniform across the whole junction, the breakdown voltage is nearly constant with changing current when compared to a non-avalanche diode.

The Zener diode exhibits an apparently similar effect in addition to Zener breakdown. Both effects are present in any such diode, but one usually dominates the other. Avalanche diodes are optimized for avalanche effect, so they exhibit small but significant voltage drop under breakdown conditions, unlike Zener diodes that always maintain a voltage higher than breakdown.
This feature provides better surge protection than a simple Zener diode and acts more like a gas-discharge tube replacement. Avalanche diodes have a small positive temperature coefficient of voltage, whereas diodes relying on the Zener effect have a negative temperature coefficient.

==Uses==
===Voltage reference===
The voltage after breakdown varies only slightly with changing current. This makes the avalanche diode useful as a type of voltage reference. Voltage reference diodes rated more than about 6â8Â volts are generally avalanche diodes.

===Protection===

A common application is to protect electronic circuits against damaging high voltages. The avalanche diode is connected to the circuit so that it is reverse-biased. In other words, its cathode is positive with respect to its anode. In this configuration, the diode is non-conducting and does not interfere with the circuit. If the voltage increases beyond the design limit, the diode goes into avalanche breakdown, causing the harmful voltage to be conducted to ground. When used in this fashion, they are often referred to as clamping diodes or transient-voltage suppressors because they fix or &quot;clamp&quot; the maximum voltage to a predetermined level. Avalanche diodes are normally specified for this role by their clamping voltage &quot;V&quot;BR and the maximum amount of transient energy they can absorb, specified by either energy (in joules) or formula_1. Avalanche breakdown is not destructive as long as the diode is prevented from overheating.

===Radio-frequency noise generation===
Avalanche diodes generate radio-frequency noise. They are commonly used as noise sources in radio equipment and hardware random number generators. For instance, they are often used as a source of RF for antenna analyzer bridges. Avalanche diodes can also be used as white noise generators.

===Microwave-frequency generation===
If placed into a resonant circuit, avalanche diodes can act as negative-resistance devices. The IMPATT diode is an avalanche diode optimized for frequency generation.

===Single-photon avalanche detector===
These are made from doped silicon and depend on the avalanche breakdown effect to detect even single photons. The silicon avalanche photodiode is a high-gain photon detector. They are &quot;ideal for use in high-speed, low-light-level applications&quot;. The avalanche photodiode is operated with a reverse bias voltage of up to hundreds of volts, slightly below its breakdown voltage. In this regime, electronâhole pairs generated by the incident photons take a large amount of energy from the electric field, which creates more secondary charge carriers. The photocurrent of just one photon can be registered with these electronic devices.

<doc id="243421" wikidata="Q2537632" url="?curid=243421" title="Eclecticism in art">
<text>Eclecticism is a kind of mixed style in the fine arts: &quot;the borrowing of a variety of styles from different sources and combining them&quot; . Significantly, Eclecticism hardly ever constituted a specific style in art: it is characterized by the fact that it was not a particular style. In general, the term describes the combination in a single work of a variety of influencesâmainly of elements from different historical styles in architecture, painting, and the graphic and decorative arts. In music the term used may be either eclecticism or polystylism.

==In the visual arts==
The term eclectic was first used by Johann Joachim Winckelmann to characterize the art of the Carracci, who incorporated in their paintings elements from the Renaissance and classical traditions. Indeed, Agostino, Annibale and Lodovico Carracci had tried to combine in their art Michelangelo&#x27;s line, Titian&#x27;s color, Correggio&#x27;s chiaroscuro, and Raphael&#x27;s symmetry and .

In the 18th century, Sir Joshua Reynolds, head of the Royal Academy of Arts in London, was one of the most influential advocates of eclecticism. In the sixth of his famous academical &quot;Discourses&quot; (1774), he wrote that the painter may use the work of the ancients as a &quot;magazine of common property, always open to the public, whence every man has a right to take what materials he pleases&quot; .

==Western architecture==

Early examples of eclectic architecture were built in the Kingdom of the Two Sicilies, particularly in the Palazzina Cinese in Palermo..
Eclecticism &quot;was an important concept in Western architecture during the mid- and late 19th century, and it reappeared in a new guise in the latter part of the 20th century&quot; .

<text>Earl of Longford is a title that has been created twice in the Peerage of Ireland.

==History==
The title was first bestowed upon Francis Aungier, 3rd Baron Aungier of Longford, in 1677, with remainder to his younger brother Ambrose. He had previously represented Surrey in the House of Commons and had already been created Viscount Longford in the Peerage of Ireland in 1675, with similar remainder. He was succeeded according to the special remainder (and, normally, in the barony) by his brother Ambrose, the second Earl. On his death in 1706 all the titles became extinct. The title of Baron Aungier of Longford was created in the Peerage of Ireland in 1621 for the first Earl&#x27;s grandfather Sir Francis Aungier, Master of the Rolls in Ireland. The latter was succeeded by his eldest son Gerald, the second Baron, who in his turn was succeeded by his nephew, the aforementioned third Baron and first Earl of Longford, the eldest son of Ambrose Aungier, Chancellor of St Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral, second son of the first Baron. Gerald Aungier, brother of the first Earl, was Governor of Bombay.

Alice Aungier, sister of the first and second Earl of Longford, married Sir James Cuffe, Member of Parliament for County Mayo. Their son Francis Cuffe also represented County Mayo in the Irish Parliament. Francis&#x27;s son Michael Cuffe sat as Member of Parliament for County Mayo and Longford Borough. Michael&#x27;s daughter Elizabeth Cuffe married Thomas Pakenham, of Pakenham Hall, just outside Castlepollard, County Westmeath, in 1739. Thomas represented Longford Borough in the Irish House of Commons. In 1756 the Longford title held by his wife&#x27;s ancestors was revived when he was raised to the Peerage of Ireland as Baron Longford, in the County of Longford. In 1785 the earldom was also revived when Elizabeth was created Countess of Longford in her own right in the Peerage of Ireland. Lord Longford was succeeded by his eldest son, the second Baron. He represented County Longford in the Irish Parliament. He died aged only 49 and was succeeded by his son, the third Baron. In 1794 the third baron also succeeded his grandmother as second Earl of Longford. Lord Longford sat in the British House of Lords as one of the 28 original Irish representative peer. In 1821 he was created Baron Silchester, of Silchester in the County of Southampton, in the Peerage of the United Kingdom, which gave him and his descendants an automatic seat in the House of Lords.

He was succeeded by his eldest son, the third Earl. He died unmarried and was succeeded by his younger brother, the fourth Earl. He was a Conservative politician and served under the Earl of Derby and Benjamin Disraeli as Under-Secretary of State for War from 1866 to 1868. His son, the fifth Earl, was Lord-Lieutenant of County Longford from 1887 to 1915. Lord Longford was killed in action at Gallipoli in 1915. He was succeeded by his eldest son, the sixth Earl. He was a minor playwright and poet and also sat as a member of Seanad Ãireann between 1946 and 1948.

He died childless and was succeeded by his younger brother, the seventh Earl. He was a prominent Labour politician and social activist. In 1945, sixteen years before he succeeded his elder brother, he was raised to the Peerage of the United Kingdom in his own right as Baron Pakenham, of Cowley in the City of Oxford. Lord Longford served in the Labour administrations of Clement Attlee and Harold Wilson as Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, First Lord of the Admiralty, Lord Privy Seal, Leader of the House of Lords and Secretary of State for the Colonies. In 1999, at the age of 94 and after the House of Lords Act 1999 removed the automatic right of hereditary peers to sit in the House of Lords, Lord Longford was created a life peer as Baron Pakenham of Cowley, of Cowley in the County of Oxfordshire. He was therefore able to remain a member of the House of Lords until his death in 2001.

 the titles (other than that of Baron Pakenham of Cowley, which as a life peerage became extinct in 2001) are held by his eldest son, the eighth Earl. He does not use his title and did not use his courtesy title of Lord Silchester which he was entitled to from 1961 to 2001. Known simply as Thomas Pakenham, he is a writer and historian.

Several other members of the Pakenham family have also gained distinction. Henry Pakenham, great-grandfather of the first Baron, represented Navan in the Irish House of Commons. His son Sir Thomas Pakenham, grandfather of the first Baron, sat as Member of Parliament for Augher. Sir Thomas&#x27;s son Edward Pakenham, father of the first Baron, represented County Westmeath in the Irish Parliament. The Honourable Sir Thomas Pakenham, third son of the first Baron and the Countess of Longford, was an admiral in the Royal Navy. His fourth son Sir John Pakenham was also an admiral in the Royal Navy while his fifth son Sir Richard Pakenham was a noted diplomat and served as Envoy Extraordinary and Minister Plenipotentiary to the United States from 1843 to 1847. The Honourable Sir Edward Pakenham, second son of the second Baron, was a major-general in the army. He served in the Peninsular Wars under his brother-in-law, General Arthur Wellesey, who married his sister Kitty Pakenham in 1806. Sir Edward Pakenham was killed at the Battle of New Orleans in 1815.

The Honourable Sir Hercules Pakenham (1781â1850), third son of the second Baron, was a lieutenant-general in the army and Member of Parliament for Westmeath. He was the father of 1) Edward Pakenham, MP for Antrim, and 2) Sir Thomas Pakenham, also a lieutenant-general. The latter&#x27;s eldest son Hercules Pakenham was an Ulster Unionist Party member of the Senate of Northern Ireland. The Honourable Thomas Alexander Pakenham (1820â1889), third son of the second Earl, was a rear-admiral in the Royal Navy. His second son Sir William Pakenham was an admiral in the Royal Navy. The Honourable Sir Francis Pakenham, seventh son of the second Earl, was a diplomat and notably served as Ambassador to Sweden. Lady Violet Pakenham, daughter of the fifth Earl, was a writer and critic and the wife of the author Anthony Powell. Elizabeth Pakenham (born Harman), Countess of Longford, wife of the seventh Earl, was a writer and social activist. Lady Antonia Fraser and Rachel Billington, daughters of the seventh Earl, are both prominent authors. Lady Judith Kazantzis, daughter of the seventh Earl, is a poet. The Honourable Sir Michael Pakenham, third son of the seventh Earl, is a diplomat.

The ancestral seat of the Pakenham family is Tullynally Castle, County Westmeath. Previously known as Pakenham Hall, it was renamed by the current owner, Thomas Pakenham and North Aston Hall near North Aston, Oxfordshire

Not to be confused with Baron Longford, a minor British Peerage title (1747) of the current Earl of Radnor.

<text>Henry Frank Phillips (June 4, 1889 â April 13, 1958) was an American businessman from Portland, Oregon. The Phillips-head (&quot;crosshead&quot;) screw and screwdriver are named after him.

The importance of the crosshead screw design lies in its self-centering property, useful on automated production lines that use powered screwdrivers. Phillips&#x27; major contribution was in driving the crosshead concept forward to the point where it was adopted by screwmakers and automobile companies. The credited inventor of the Phillips screw was John P. Thompson who, in 1932, patented (#1,908,080) a recessed cruciform screw and in 1933, a screwdriver for it.

==Biography==
After failing to interest manufacturers, Thompson sold his self-centering design to Phillips in 1935. Phillips formed the Phillips Screw Company in 1934. After refining the design (U.S. Patent #2,046,343, U.S. Patents #2,046,837 to 2,046,840) for the American Screw Company of Providence, Rhode Island, Phillips succeeded in bringing the design to industrial manufacturing and promoting its rapid adoption as a machine screw standard. American Screw then spent $500,000 originating a method of manufacture. One of the first customers was General Motors who used the innovative design in 1936 for its Cadillac assembly-lines. By 1940, 85% of U.S. screw manufacturers had a license for the design.

Due to failing health, Phillips retired in 1945. He lost his patent in 1949. He died in 1958.

<text>Trevor Joseph Goddard (14 October 1962 â 7 June 2003) was an English actor. He was best known for playing Kano in the martial arts film &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;, a live action adaptation of the popular video game series. Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby in the television series &quot;JAG&quot; and main villain Keefer in the action film &quot;Men of War&quot; (with Dolph Lundgren and &quot;JAG&quot; co-star Catherine Bell).

==Early life==
Goddard was born in Croydon, London, England, in 1962. Between 1974 and 1979, he attended Ravensbourne School, Hayes Lane, Bromley, London. A punk in 1977, he helped form a band at school called The Belsen Horrors (the name of which came from a Sex Pistols track). First a drummer, then the lead singer, he and his band lasted until 1978. Later, sometime between 1979 and 1980, he was the drummer in another Bromley punk band called The Vamp. This group was led by Wayne Cregan, who was one of the first members of X-Ray Spex. Bromley was closely linked with the early punk movement â first through the Bromley Contingent (the first fans of the Sex Pistols), and three famous punk singers who came from this town: Poly Styrene (X-Ray Spex), Siouxsie Sioux (of Siouxsie and the Banshees) and Billy Idol â who like Trevor, attended Ravensbourne School for Boys.

For much of his career, he claimed to be of Australian descent and often played Australian characters.

==Career==
He appeared in cameo roles in many television shows prior to 1995. That same year, Goddard played Kano in the film adaptation of &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. His performance as Kano became the source of the character&#x27;s evolution in the video games. However his accent in the film was mistakenly interpreted as Australian, which led to Kano being portrayed as an Australian in future installments.

He would go on to act in other films such as &quot;Gone in Sixty Seconds&quot;, &quot;Men of War&quot; (with Dolph Lundgren and future &quot;JAG&quot; co-star Catherine Bell) and &quot;Hollywood Vampyr&quot;. He played a short-tempered mercenary in the 1998 film &quot;Deep Rising&quot; with Treat Williams and Famke Janssen. Goddard played in the television drama series &quot;JAG&quot; as Lieutenant Commander Mic Brumby and was featured in TV commercials for the Hoover FloorMate.

He made his last on-screen appearance in the 2003 film &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean: The Curse of the Black Pearl&quot;.

==Death==
On 8 June 2003, Goddard was found dead in his home in North Hollywood, Los Angeles, California. He was 40 years old. Initial reports indicated that Goddard was in the process of getting a divorce and that suicide was suspected. An autopsy later showed that Goddard died from an accidental drug overdose of heroin, cocaine, temazepam and vicodin.
