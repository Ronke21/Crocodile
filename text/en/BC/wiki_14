<text>The history of Berlin starts with its foundation in the 12th century. It became the capital of the Margraviate of Brandenburg in 1237, and later of Brandenburg-Prussia, and the Kingdom of Prussia. Prussia grew about rapidly in the 18th and 19th centuries and formed the basis of the German Empire in 1871. The empire would survive until 1918 when it was defeated in World War I.

After 1900 Berlin became a major world city, known for its leadership roles in science, the humanities, music, museums, higher education, government, diplomacy and military affairs. It also had a role in manufacturing and finance.

During World War II, bombing, artillery, and ferocious street-by-street fighting destroyed large parts of Berlin. Berlin was subsequently divided among the four major Allied powers and for over four decades it encapsulated the Cold War confrontation between West and East. With the reunification of Germany in 1990, Berlin was restored as the capital and as a major world city.

== Etymology ==
The name &quot;Berlin&quot; is of Slavic origin, formed from a root &quot;*berl-/*brl-&quot;, enlarged by a suffix &quot;-in&quot; which is still common in modern Slavic languages. The meaning of the root is somewhat obscure, lacking clear cognates in other languages, but is usually interpreted as &quot;bog, swamp&quot;, due to similar and obviously Slavic toponyms in Eastern Germany. As early sources mention the name with a definite article (&quot;der Berlin&quot;), it appears to have referred originally to a specific piece of land. Similar to other Slavic-derived German toponyms ending in &quot;-in&quot;, the name is consistently stressed on this suffix.

The name of the city&#x27;s other historic kernel, &quot;Kölln&quot;, is likely derived from Cologne, called &quot;Köln&quot; in German, whose name ultimately stems from the Latin &quot;colonia&quot; &quot;colony, new planned settlement&quot;. The prominent role of merchants from the Lower Rhine in the earliest days of the city makes this likely. A derivation from Slavic &quot;kol&#x27;no&quot;, related to a word meaning &quot;stake, pale, post&quot;, cannot be completely excluded.

Contrary to folk etymology, the name is not related to bears (German sg. &quot;Bär&quot;), even though the city was allegedly founded by Albert the Bear, the first Margrave of Brandenburg. A relationship between Albert and the coat-of-arms (showing a bear) has not been reliably proven.

== Prehistory ==
The oldest human traces, mainly arrowheads, in the area of later Berlin are dating to the 9th millennium BC. During Neolithic times a large number of villages existed in the area. During the Bronze Age it belonged to the Lusatian culture. For the time around 500 BC the presence of Germanic tribes can be evidenced for the first time in form of a number of villages in the higher situated areas of today&#x27;s Berlin. After the Semnones left around 200 AD, the Burgundians followed. A large part of the Germanic tribes left the region around 500 AD.

In the 7th century Slavic tribes, the later known Hevelli and Sprevane, reached the region. Today their traces can mainly be found at plateaus or next to waters. Their main settlements were today&#x27;s Spandau and Köpenick. No Slavic traces could be found in the city center of Berlin. 

== Emerging city (1100–1400) ==

In the 12th century the region came under German rule as part of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, founded by Albert the Bear in 1157. At the end of the 12th century German merchants founded the first settlements in today&#x27;s city center, called Berlin around modern Nikolaiviertel and Cölln, on the island in the Spree now known as the Spreeinsel or Museum Island. It is not clear which settlement is older and when they got German town rights. Berlin is mentioned as a town for the first time in 1251 and Cölln in 1261. 

The year 1237 was later taken as the year of founding as the first recorded mention of Cölln is from that year. The first mention of Berlin dates to 1244 The two settlements formally merged into the town of Berlin-Cölln in 1432. Albert the Bear also bequeathed to Berlin the emblem of the bear, which has appeared on its coat of arms ever since. Between 1373 and 1415, it was part of the Bohemian Crown Lands. By the year 1400 Berlin and Cölln had 8,000 inhabitants. A great town center fire in 1380 damaged most written records of those early years, as did the great devastation of the Thirty Years&#x27; War 1618–1648.

== Margraviate of Brandenburg (1400–1700) ==


In 1415, Frederick I became the elector of the Margraviate of Brandenburg, which he ruled until 1440. Subsequent members of the Hohenzollern family ruled until 1918 in Berlin, first as electors of Brandenburg, then as kings of Prussia, and finally as German emperors. When Berlin became the residence of the Hohenzollerns, it had to give up its Hanseatic League free city status. Its main economical activity changed from trade to the production of luxurious goods for the court.

*1443 to 1451: The first Berliner Stadtschloss was built on the embankment of the river Spree.
**At that time Berlin-Cölln had about 8,000 inhabitants. Population figures rose fast, leading to poverty.
*1448: The inhabitants of Berlin rebelled in the &quot;Berlin Indignation&quot; against the construction of a new royal palace by Elector Frederick II Irontooth. This protest was not successful, however, and the citizenry lost many of its political and economic privileges.
*1451: Berlin became the royal residence of the Brandenburg electors, and Berlin had to give up its status as a free Hanseatic city.
*In 1510: 100 Jews were accused of stealing and desecrating hosts. 38 of them were burned to death; others were banished, losing their possessions, only to be returned by later margraves.
*1530: The Tiergarten park began when Elector Joachim I donated the property for use as a royal game preserve; it was opened to the public in the mid-17th century; it ceased being a hunting park in 1740 when the job of redesigning it in the English landscape style began.
*1539: The electors and Berlin officially became Lutheran.
*1540: Joachim II introduced the Protestant Reformation in Brandenburg and secularized church possessions. He used the money to pay for his projects, like building an avenue, the Kurfürstendamm, between his hunting castle Grunewald and his palace, the Berliner Stadtschloss.
*1576, Bubonic plague killed about 6,000 people in the city.
*Around 1600: Berlin-Cölln had 12,000 inhabitants.
*1618 to 1648: The Thirty Years&#x27; War had devastating consequences for Berlin. A third of the houses were damaged, and the city lost half of its population.
*1640: Frederick William, known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;, succeeded his father George William as Elector of Brandenburg. Later he initiated a policy of promoting immigration and religious toleration. Over the following decades, Berlin expanded greatly in area and population with the founding of the new suburbs of Friedrichswerder and Dorotheenstadt. During his government Berlin reached 20,000 inhabitants and became significant among the cities in Central Europe for the first time. He also developed a standing army.
*1647: The boulevard Unter den Linden with six rows of trees was laid down between the &quot;Tiergarten&quot; park and the Palace.
*1671: Fifty Jewish families from Austria were given a home in Berlin. With the Edict of Potsdam in 1685, Frederick William invited the French Calvinist Huguenots to Brandenburg. More than 15,000 Huguenots came, of whom 6,000 settled in Berlin. By 1687 they comprise 20% of the population, and many were bankers, industrialists and investors.
*1674 and after: The &quot;Dorotheenstadt&quot; was built in a bow of the river Spree, north-west of the Spreeinsel (Spree Island), where the Palace was situated.
*1688 and after: The &quot;Friedrichstadt&quot; was built and settled.
*Around 1700: Many refugees from Bohemia, Poland, and Salzburg had arrived.

== Kingdom of Prussia (1701–1871) ==

In 1701, Elector Frederick III (1688–1701) crowned himself as Frederick I (1701–1713), King in Prussia. He was mostly interested in decorum: he ordered the building of the castle Charlottenburg in the west of the city. He made Berlin the capital of the new kingdom of Prussia.
*1709: Berlin counted 55,000 inhabitants, of whom 5,000 served in the Prussian Army. Cölln and Berlin were finally unified under the name of Berlin, including the suburbs of Friedrichswerder, Dorotheenstadt, and Friedrichstadt, with 60,000 inhabitants. Berlin and Cölln are on both sides of the river Spree, in today&#x27;s Mitte borough.
On 1 January 1710, the cities of Berlin, Cölln, Friedrichswerder, Dorotheenstadt, and Friedrichstadt were united as the &quot;Royal Capital and Residence of Berlin&quot;.

=== Prussian capital ===
As Prussia grew, so too did Berlin, and the kings made it the centerpiece of culture and the arts, as well as the Army. Under King Friedrich Wilhelm I (reigned 1713–40), Berlin&#x27;s growth was encouraged by his determination to build a great military power. More men were needed, so he promoted immigration of Protestants from across Germany as well as France and Switzerland. He introduced universal primary education so that his soldiers could read and write. In 1720 he built the city&#x27;s first major hospital and medical school, the Charité, now the largest teaching hospital in Europe. The city was now mainly a garrison and an armoury, for the crown heavily subsidised arms manufacturers in the capital, laying the foundations for the mechanics, engineers, technicians, and entrepreneurs who were to turn Berlin into an industrial powerhouse. The old defensive walls and moats were now useless, so they were torn down. A new customs wall (the Zoll- und Akzisemauer) was built further out, punctuated by 14 ornate gates. Inside the gates were parade grounds for Friedrich Wilhelm&#x27;s soldiers: the Karree at the Brandenburg gate (now Pariserplatz), the Oktagon at the Potsdam gate (now Leipzigerplatz), the Wilhelmplatz on Wilhelmstrasse (abolished in the 1980s) and several others.

In 1740, Frederick the Great (Frederick II) began his 46-year reign. He was an enlightened monarch, who patronized Enlightenment thinkers like Moses Mendelssohn. By 1755 the population reached 100,000, including 26,000 soldiers.
Stagnation followed under the rule of Frederick William II, 1786–97. He had no use for the Enlightenment, but did develop innovative techniques of censorship and repression of political enemies.
*1806: French troops marched into Berlin. Berlin was granted self-government and a far reaching military reform was started.
*1809: The first elections for the Berlin parliament took place, in which only the well-to-do could vote.
*1810: The Berlin University (now the Humboldt University) was founded. Its first rector was the philosopher Johann Gottlieb Fichte.
*1812: Jews were allowed to practice all occupations.
*1814: The French were defeated in the Sixth Coalition. Economically the city was in good shape. The population grew from 200,000 to 400,000 in the first half of the 19th century, making Berlin the fourth-largest city in Europe.
*1815: Battle of Waterloo with Prussian troops from Potsdam and Berlin participating. Berlin becomes part of the Province of Brandenburg.
*1827: Berlin is the capital of the Province of Brandenburg from 1827 to 1843.
*1848: As in other European cities, 1848 was a revolutionary year in Berlin. Frederick William IV (1840–1861) managed to suppress the revolution. One of his reactions was to raise the income condition to partake in the elections, with the result that only 5% of the citizens could vote. This system would stay in place until 1918.
*1861: German Emperor Wilhelm I (1861–1888) became the new king. In the beginning of his reign there was hope for liberalization. He appointed liberal ministers and built the city hall, Das Rote Rathaus. The appointment of Otto von Bismarck ended these hopes.

=== Economic growth ===
Prussian mercantilist policies supported manufacturing enterprises and Berlin had numerous small workshops. Lacking waterpower, Berlin entrepreneurs were early pioneers in the use of steam engines after 1815. Textiles, clothing, farm equipment, railway gear, chemicals and machinery were especially important; electrical machinery became important after 1880.

Berlin&#x27;s central position after 1850 in the fast-growing German railway network facilitated the supply of raw materials and distribution of manufactures. As the administrative role of the Prussian state grew, so did the highly efficient, well-trained civil service. The bureaucracy and military expanded even faster when Berlin became the capital of unified Germany in 1871. the population grew rapidly, from 172,000 in 1800, to 826,000 in 1870. In 1861, outlying industrial suburbs such as Wedding, Moabit, and several others were incorporated into the city.

=== Religion ===
By 1900 about 85% of the people were classified as Protestants, 10% as Roman Catholics and 5% as Jews. Berlin&#x27;s middle and upper classes were generally devout Protestants. The working classes increasingly became secularized. When workers moved to Berlin the Protestants among them largely abandoned the religious practices of their old villages. The labor unions promoted anticlericalism, and denounced the Protestant churches as aloof from the needs of the working class. However, the Catholic workers remained somewhat closer to their traditional churches, which featured liturgies that were more appealing to workers than wordy intellectual sermons at the Protestant churches. Adult attendance at Sunday church services in the early 20th century was 6% in Berlin, compared to 22% in London and 37% in New York.

=== Berlin Romanticism ===
The phase of German Romanticism after Jena Romanticism is often called Berlin Romanticism (see also Heidelberg Romanticism). Notable representatives of the movement include Friedrich Schleiermacher, Wilhelm von Humboldt and Alexander von Humboldt.

== German Empire (1871–1918) ==
=== Imperial capital ===

After the quick victory of an alliance of German states over France in the 1870 war, the German Empire was established in 1871. Bismarck had fought and succeeded in leaving out Austria, Prussia&#x27;s long standing competitor, and Prussia became the largest and by far most influential state in the new German Empire, and in turn Germany became the most powerful nation in Europe. Wilhelm I became emperor (&quot;Kaiser&quot;). Bismarck became Chancellor and made Berlin the center of European power politics. The imperial government and the military establishment expanded dramatically, bringing together the landed junker nobility, the rich bankers and industrialists, and the most talented scientists and scholars. In 1884 came the parliament building, the Reichstag. Municipal government was handled in two parts. The ministry of police reported to the Prussian government and took control of crime, markets, and fire fighting. The civil government had a mayor appointed by the city council. It comprised 144 members elected in 48 wards by universal manhood suffrage. It handled the water supply and sanitation, streets, hospitals and charitable operations and schools.

In 1870, the sanitary conditions in Berlin were among the worst in Europe. August Bebel recalled conditions before a modern sewer system was built in the late 1870s:
:&quot;Waste-water from the houses collected in the gutters running alongside the curbs and emitted a truly fearsome smell. There were no public toilets in the streets or squares. Visitors, especially women, often became desperate when nature called. In the public buildings the sanitary facilities were unbelievably primitive...As a metropolis, Berlin did not emerge from a state of barbarism into civilization until after 1870.&quot;

The primitive conditions were intolerable for a world national capital, and the Imperial government brought in its scientists, engineers and urban planners to not only solve the deficiencies but to forge the world&#x27;s model city. A British expert in 1906 concluded that Berlin represented &quot;the most complete application of science, order and method of public life,&quot; adding &quot;it is a marvel of civic administration, the most modern and most perfectly organized city that there is.&quot;

In the meantime, Berlin had become an industrial city with 800,000 inhabitants. Improvements to the infrastructure were needed; in 1896 the construction of the subway (&quot;U-Bahn&quot;) began and was completed in 1902. The neighborhoods around the city center (including Kreuzberg, Prenzlauer Berg, Friedrichshain and Wedding) were filled with tenement blocks. The surroundings saw extensive development of industrial areas East of Berlin and wealthy residential areas in the South-West.

In terms of high culture, museums were being built and enlarged, and Berlin was on the verge of becoming a major musical city. Berlin dominated the German theater scene, with the government-supported Opernhaus and Schauspielhaus, as well as numerous private playhouses included the Lessing and the Deutsches theatres. They featured the modern plays of Ernst von Wildenbruch, Hermann Sudermann, and Gerhart Hauptmann. who managed to work around the puritanical censorship imposed by the Berlin police.

=== Labour unions ===
Berlin, with its large numbers of industrial workers by 1871 became the headquarters for most of the national labor organizations, and the favorite meeting place for labor intellectuals. Inside the city, the unions had a turbulent history. The conservative aftermath of the Revolution of 1848 drained their strength, and internal bickering was characteristic of the 1850s and 1860s. Many locals were under the control of reformist, bourgeois leaders who competed with each other and had a negative view of Marxism and socialist internationalism. They concentrated on wages, hours and control of the workplace, and gave little support to national organizations such as the Allgemeine Deutsche Arbeiterverein (ADAV) founded in 1863. By the 1870s, however, the Lassallean ADAV finally gained strength; it joined together with the Social Democratic Worker&#x27;s Party (SDAP) in 1874. Henceforth the city&#x27;s labor movement supported radical socialism and gained preeminence within the German labor movement. Germany had universal manhood suffrage after 1871, but the government was controlled by hostile forces, and Chancellor Otto von Bismarck tried to undermine or destroy the union movement.

=== First World War ===
The &quot;spirit of 1914&quot; was the enthusiastic support of many of the educated middle- and upper-class elements of the population for the war when it first broke out in 1914. In the Reichstag, the vote for war credits was unanimous, with all the Social Democrats joining in. One professor testified to a &quot;great single feeling of moral elevation of soaring of religious sentiment, in short, the ascent of a whole people to the heights.&quot; At the same time, there was a level of anxiety; most commentators predicted the short victorious war – but that hope was dashed in a matter of weeks, as the invasion of Belgium bogged down and the French Army held in front of Paris. The Western Front became a killing machine, as neither army moved more than a ten thousand yards at a time. There had been no preparations before the war, and no stockpiles of essential goods. Industry was in chaos, unemployment soared while it took months to reconvert to munitions productions. In 1916, the Hindenburg Program called for the mobilization of all economic resources to produce artillery, shells, and machine guns. Church bells and copper roofs were ripped out and melted down.

Conditions on the homefront worsened month by month, for the British blockade of Germany cut off supplies of essential raw materials and foodstuffs, while the conscription of so many farmers (and horses) reduced the food supply. Likewise, the drafting of miners reduced the main energy source, coal. The textile factories produced Army uniforms, and warm clothing for civilians ran short. The device of using replacement materials, such as paper and cardboard for cloth and leather proved unsatisfactory. Soap was in short supply, as was hot water.

Morale of both civilians and soldiers continued to sink but using the slogan of &quot;sharing scarcity&quot; the Berlin bureaucracy ran an efficient rationing system nevertheless. The food supply increasingly focused on potatoes and bread as it was harder and harder to buy meat. Rationing was installed, and soup kitchens were opened. The meat ration in late 1916 was only 31% of peacetime, and it fell to 12% in late 1918. The fish ration was 51% in 1916, and none at all by late 1917. The rations for cheese, butter, rice, cereals, eggs and lard were less than 20% of peacetime levels. In 1917 the harvest was poor, and the potato supply ran short, and Germans substituted almost inedible turnips; the &quot;turnip winter&quot; of 1917–18 was remembered with bitter distaste for generations.

German women were not employed in the Army, but large numbers took paid employment in industry and factories, and even larger numbers engaged in volunteer services. Housewives were taught how to cook without milk, eggs or fat; agencies helped widows find work. Banks, insurance companies and government offices for the first time hired women for clerical positions. Factories hired them for unskilled labor – by December 1917, half the workers in chemicals, metals, and machine tools were women. Laws protecting women in the workplace were relaxed, and factories set up canteens to provide food for their workers, lest their productivity fall off. The food situation in 1918 was better, because the harvest was better, but serious shortages continued, with high prices, and a complete lack of condiments and fresh fruit. Many migrants had flocked into Berlin to work in industry and the government ministries, which made for overcrowded housing. Reduced coal supplies left everyone in the cold. Daily life involved long working hours, poor health, and little or no recreation, as well as increasing anxiety for the safety of loved ones in the Army and in prisoner of war camps. The men who returned from the front were those who had been permanently crippled; wounded soldiers who recovered were sent back to the trenches.

== Weimar Republic (1918–1933) ==

At the end of World War I, monarchy and aristocracy were overthrown and Germany became a republic, known as the Weimar Republic. Berlin remained the capital but faced a series of threats from the far left and far right.

In late 1918 politicians inspired by the Communist Revolution in Russia founded the Communist Party of Germany (&quot;Kommunistische Partei Deutschlands&quot;, KPD). In January 1919 it tried to seize power in the Spartacist revolt. The coup failed and at the end of the month right-wing &quot;Freikorps&quot; forces killed the Communist leaders Rosa Luxemburg and Karl Liebknecht.

In March 1920 Wolfgang Kapp, founder of the right-wing German Fatherland Party (&quot;Deutsche Vaterlands-Partei&quot;), tried to bring down the government. The Berlin garrison chose his side, and the government buildings were occupied (the government had already left Berlin). A general strike stopped the putsch being successful.

On October 1, 1920: The Greater Berlin Act created &quot;Greater Berlin&quot; (&quot;Groß-Berlin&quot;) by incorporating several neighboring towns and villages like Charlottenburg, Köpenick or Spandau from the Province of Brandenburg into the city; Berlin&#x27;s population doubled overnight from about 2 to nearly 4 million inhabitants.

In 1922: The foreign minister Walther Rathenau was assassinated in Berlin, and half a million people attended his funeral.

The economic situation was bad. Germany owed reparation money after the Treaty of Versailles. The sums were reduced and paid using loans from New York banks. In response to French occupation, the government reacted by printing so much money that inflation was enormous. Especially pensioners lost their savings; everyone else lost their debts. At the worst point of the inflation, one dollar was worth about 4.2 trillion marks. From 1924 onwards the situation became better because of newly arranged agreements with the allied forces, American help, and a sounder fiscal policy. The heyday of Berlin began. It became the largest industrial city on the continent. People like the architect Walter Gropius, physicist Albert Einstein, painter George Grosz and writers Arnold Zweig, Bertolt Brecht and Kurt Tucholsky made Berlin one of the major cultural centers of Europe. Brecht spent productive years in Weimar-era Berlin (1930–1933) working with his ‘collective’ on the Lehrstücke. Nightlife bloomed in 1920s Berlin.

In 1922 the railway system that connected Berlin to its neighboring cities and villages was electrified and transformed into the S-Bahn, and a year later Tempelhof airport was opened. Berlin was the second biggest inland harbor in the country. All this infrastructure was needed to transport and feed the over 4 million Berliners.

Before the 1929 crash, 450,000 people were unemployed. In the same year, the Nazi Party won its first seats in the city parliament. Nazi Propaganda chief Joseph Goebbels became Gauleiter (party district leader) of Berlin in 1926. On July 20, 1932, the Prussian government under Otto Braun in Berlin was dismissed by presidential decree. The republic was nearing its breakdown, under attack by extreme forces from the right and the left. On January 30, 1933, Hitler was appointed Chancellor of Germany.

== Nazi Germany (1933–1945) ==

By 1931, the Great Depression had severely damaged the city&#x27;s economy. Politics were in chaos, as militias controlled by the Nazis and the Communists fought for control of the streets. President Hindenburg appointed Hitler chancellor in January 1933, and the Nazis quickly moved to take complete control of the entire nation. On February 27, 1933, a left-wing radical was alleged to have set afire the Reichstag building (a fire which was later believed to have been set by the Nazis themselves); the fire gave Hitler the opportunity to set aside the constitution. Tens of thousands of political opponents fled into exile or were imprisoned. All civic organizations, except the churches, came under Nazi control.

Around 1933, some 160,000 Jews were living in Berlin: one third of all German Jews, 4% of the Berlin population. A third of them were poor immigrants from Eastern Europe, who lived mainly in the &quot;Scheunenviertel&quot; near Alexanderplatz. The Jews were persecuted from the beginning of the Nazi regime. In March, all Jewish doctors had to leave the Charité hospital. In the first week of April, Nazi officials ordered the German population not to buy from Jewish shops.

The 1936 Summer Olympics were held in Berlin and used as a showcase for Nazi Germany (though the Games had been given to Germany before 1933). In order to not alienate the foreign visitors, the &quot;forbidden for Jews&quot; signs were temporarily removed.

Nazi rule destroyed Berlin&#x27;s Jewish community, which numbered 160,000 before the Nazis came to power. After the pogrom of Kristallnacht in 1938, thousands of the city&#x27;s Jews were imprisoned. Around 1939, there were still 75,000 Jews living in Berlin. The majority of German Jews in Berlin were taken to the Grunewald railway station in early 1943 and shipped in stock cars to death camps such as the Auschwitz, where most were murdered in the Holocaust. Only some 1200 Jews survived in Berlin by hiding. Approximately 800 Jews survived in Berlin&#x27;s Jewish Hospital. Causes for their survival include bureaucratic infighting, hospital director Dr. Walter Lustig&#x27;s relationship with Adolf Eichmann, the Nazis&#x27; bizarre system for classifying persons of partly Jewish ancestry, German leader Adolf Hitler&#x27;s ambivalence about how to handle Jews of German descent, and the fact that the Nazis needed a place to treat Jews.

Thirty kilometers () northwest of Berlin, near Oranienburg, was Sachsenhausen concentration camp, where mainly political opponents, Jews, Poles, Russian prisoners of war, etc. were incarcerated. Tens of thousands died there. In Berlin, Sachsenhausen had 17 subcamps for men and women, including teenagers, near industries, where the prisoners had to work. The prisoners were of various nationalities, including Polish, Jewish, French, Belgian, Czechoslovak, Russian, Ukrainian, Romani, Dutch, Greek, Norwegian, Spanish, Luxembourgish, German, Austrian, Italian, Yugoslavian, Bulgarian, Hungarian. There was also a camp for Sinti and Romani people (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;), and the Stalag III-D prisoner-of-war camp for Allied POWs of various nationalities.

=== Nazi plans ===
In the late 1930s Hitler and his architect Albert Speer made plans for the new Berlin—a world city or &quot;Welthauptstadt Germania&quot;. All the projects were to be of gigantic size. Adjacent to the Reichstag, Speer planned to construct the &quot;Volkshalle&quot; (The People&#x27;s Hall), 250 m high, with an enormous copper dome. It would be large enough to hold 170,000 people. From the People&#x27;s Hall, a southbound avenue was planned, the Avenue of Victory, 23 m wide and long. At the other end there would have been the new railway station, and next to it Tempelhof Airport. Halfway down the avenue there would have been a huge arch 117 m high, commemorating those fallen during the world wars. With the completion of these projects (planned for 1950), Berlin was to be renamed &quot;Germania.&quot;

The war postponed all construction, as the city instead built giant concrete towers as bases for anti-aircraft guns. Today only a few structures remain from the Nazi era, such as the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; (National Ministry of Aviation), Tempelhof International Airport, and Olympiastadion. Hitler&#x27;s Reich Chancellery was demolished by Soviet occupation authorities.

=== Second World War ===

Initially Berlin was at the extreme range of British bombers and attacks had to be made in clear skies during summer, increasing the risk to the attackers. Better bombers came into service in 1942 but most of the British bombing effort that year was spent in support of the Battle of the Atlantic against German submarines.

*1940: A token British air-raid on Berlin on 25 August 1940; Hitler responds by ordering the Blitz on London.
*1943: Polish resistance group &quot;Zagra-Lin&quot; successfully carries out a series of small bomb attacks.
*1943: The USAAF strategic bombing force began operations against Berlin. The RAF focused their strategic bombing efforts on Berlin in their &quot;Battle of Berlin&quot; from November. It was halted at the end of March 1944, after 16 mass bombing raids on the capital, due to unacceptable losses of aircraft and crew. By that point about half a million had been made homeless but morale and production was unaffected. About a quarter of the city&#x27;s population was evacuated. Raids on major German cities grew in scope and raids of over 1,000 4-engined bombers were not uncommon by 1944. (On March 18, 1945 alone, for example, 1,250 American bombers attacked the city).
*1944: USAAF bombing switched to forcing encounters with the German air force so that it could be defeated by the bombers&#x27; fighter escorts. Attacks on Berlin ensured a response from the Luftwaffe, drawing it into a battle where their losses could not be replaced at the same rate as the Allies. RAF focus switched to preparations for the invasion of France but Berlin was still subjected to regular nuisance and diversionary raids by the RAF.
*March 1945: The RAF begins 36 consecutive nights of bombing by its fast de Havilland Mosquito medium bombers (from around 40 to 80 each night). British bombers dropped 46,000 tons of bombs; the Americans dropped 23,000 tons. By May 1945, 1.7 million people (40%) had fled.
*April 1945: Berlin was the main objective for Allied armies. The Race to Berlin refers to the competition of Allied generals during the final months of World War II to enter Berlin first. U.S. General Dwight D. Eisenhower halted Anglo-American troops on the Elbe River, primarily because the Soviets made their capture of the city a high national priority in terms of prestige and revenge. The Red Army converged on Berlin with several Fronts (Army Groups). Hitler remained in supreme command and imagined that rescue armies were on the way; he refused to consider surrender.
The Battle of Berlin itself has been well chronicled.

*April 30, 1945: Hitler committed suicide in the &quot;Führerbunker&quot; underneath the Reich Chancellery. Resistance continued, though most of the city was in Soviet hands by that point.
*May 2, 1945: Berlin finally capitulated.
* Hundreds of thousands of women were subjected to rape by Soviet soldiers.

Destruction of buildings and infrastructure was nearly total in parts of the inner city business and residential sectors. The outlying sections suffered relatively little damage. This averages to one fifth of all buildings, and 50% in the inner city.

== West and East Germany (1945–1990) ==
By war&#x27;s end up to a third of Berlin had been destroyed by concerted Allied air raids, Soviet artillery, and street fighting. The so-called &quot;Stunde Null&quot;—zero hour—marked a new beginning for the city. Greater Berlin was divided into four sectors by the Allies under the London Protocol of 1944, as follows:
* the American sector (210.8 km2), consisting of the boroughs of Neukölln, Kreuzberg, Tempelhof, Schöneberg, Steglitz, and Zehlendorf; (see: commandants of Berlin American Sector)
* the British sector (165.5 km2), consisting of the boroughs of Tiergarten, Charlottenburg, Wilmersdorf, and Spandau; (see: commandants of Berlin British Sector)
* the French sector (110.8 km2), consisting of the boroughs of Wedding and Reinickendorf; (See: commandants of Berlin French Sector)
* the Soviet sector (402.8 km2)), consisting of the boroughs of Mitte, Prenzlauer Berg, Pankow, Weißensee, Friedrichshain, Lichtenberg, Treptow, and Köpenick; (see: commandants of Berlin Soviet Sector).

The Soviet victors of the Battle of Berlin immediately occupied all of Berlin. They handed the American, British and French sectors (later known as West Berlin) to the American and British Forces in July 1945: the French occupied their sector later. Berlin remained divided until reunification in 1990.

The Soviets used the period from May 1945 to July 1945 to dismantle industry, transport and other facilities in West Berlin, including removing railway tracks, as reparations for German war damage in the Soviet Union. This practice continued in East Berlin and the Soviet occupation zone after 1945. Conditions were harsh, and hundreds of thousands of refugees from the east kept pouring in. Residents depended heavily on the black market for food and other necessities.

Berlin&#x27;s unique situation as a city half-controlled by Western forces in the middle of the Soviet Occupation Zone of Germany made it a natural focal point in the Cold War after 1947. Though the city was initially governed by a Four Power Allied Control Council with a leadership that rotated monthly, the Soviets withdrew from the council as east–west relations deteriorated and began governing their sector independently. The council continued to govern West Berlin, with the same rotating leadership policy, though now involving only France, the United Kingdom, and the United States.

East Germany chose East Berlin as its capital when the country was formed out of the Soviet occupation zone in October 1949; however, this was rejected by Western allies, who continued to regard Berlin as an occupied city that was not legally part of any German state. In practice, the government of East Germany treated East Berlin as an integral part of the nation. Although half the size and population of West Berlin, it included most of the historic center.

By the establishment of the Oder-Neisse line and the complete expulsion of the German inhabitants east of this line, Berlin lost its traditional hinterlands of Farther Pomerania and Lower Silesia.

West Germany, formed on 23 May 1949 from the American, British, and French zones, had its seat of government and &quot;de facto&quot; capital in Bonn, although Berlin was symbolically named the &quot;de jure&quot; West German capital in West German Basic Law (Grundgesetz).

West Berlin &quot;de jure&quot; remained under the rule of the Western Allies, but for most practical purposes was treated as a part of West Germany; however, the residents did not hold West German passports.

=== Blockade and airlift ===
In response to Allied efforts to fuse the American, French, and British sectors of western Germany into a federal state, and to a currency reform undertaken by Western powers without Soviet approval, the Soviets blocked ground access to West Berlin on 26 June 1948, in what became known as the &quot;Berlin Blockade&quot;. The Soviet goal was to gain control of the whole of Berlin. The American and British air forces engaged in a massive logistical effort to supply the western sectors of the city through the Berlin Airlift, known by West Berliners as &quot;die Luftbrücke&quot; (the Air Bridge). The blockade lasted almost a year, ending when the Soviets once again allowed ground access to West Berlin on 11 May 1949.

As part of this project, US Army engineers expanded Tempelhof Airport. Because sometimes the deliveries contained sweets and candy for children, the planes were also nicknamed &quot;Candy Bombers&quot;.

=== The June 17 Uprising ===

With Stalin dead, the KGB chief Lavrenti Beria jockeyed for power in the Kremlin, putting forth the goal of German reunification. His plan was to set up a workers&#x27; demonstration that would allow the Kremlin to remove hardliner Walter Ulbricht and begin a program of economic concessions to the workers. The plan failed when the demonstrations assumed a mass character. The strike against poor wages and working conditions overnight became a workers&#x27; revolution for democratic rights. On 17 June, the Soviets used their tanks to restore order. This failure delayed German unification and contributed to the fall of Beria. It started when 60 construction workers building the showpiece Stalin-Allee in East Berlin went on strike on 16 June 1953, to demand a reduction in recent work-quota increases. They called for a general strike the next day, 17 June. The general strike and protest marches turned into rioting and spread throughout East Germany. The East German police failed to quell the unrest. It was forcibly suppressed by Soviet troops, who encountered stiff resistance from angry crowds across East Germany, and responded with live ammunition. At least 153 people were killed in the suppression of the uprising.

The continuation of the street &quot;Unter den Linden&quot; on the western side of the Brandenburg Gate was renamed &quot;Straße des 17. Juni&quot; in honor of the uprising, and 17 June was proclaimed a national holiday in West Germany. The 50th anniversary of 17 June 1953 in 2003 was marked by reflection on the role of memory in creating a national identity for a unified Germany.

=== Berlin Wall ===


Loshitzky depicts the role of the Berlin Wall as a symbol of the Cold War, détente, and the collapse of the Communist regimes in Eastern Europe. She divides the history of the Wall into six major stages: the erection of the Wall (1961); the period of the &quot;geography of fear&quot; from the Cold War; the period of détente; the short period of glasnost and perestroika; the fall of the Wall (1989); and after the Wall.

On August 13, 1961, the Communist East German government started to build a wall, physically separating West Berlin from East Berlin and the rest of East Germany, as a response to massive numbers of East German citizens fleeing into West Berlin as a way to escape. The wall was built overnight with no warning. This separated families for as long as the wall was up. The East German government called the Wall the &quot;anti-fascist protection wall&quot;. The tensions between East and West were exacerbated by a tank standoff at Checkpoint Charlie on 27 October 1961. West Berlin was now a de facto part of West Germany, but with a unique legal status, while East Berlin remained part of East Germany.

The western sectors of Berlin were now completely separated from the surrounding territory of East Berlin and East Germany. It was possible for Westerners to pass from one to the other only through strictly controlled checkpoints. For most Easterners, travel to West Berlin or West Germany was no longer possible. During the Wall&#x27;s existence there were around 5,000 successful escapes into West Berlin; 136 people were officially killed trying to cross (see &quot;List of deaths at the Berlin Wall&quot;) and around 200 were seriously injured. The sandy soil under the Wall was both a blessing and a curse for those who attempted to tunnel their way to West Berlin and freedom. Although it was easy to dig through quickly, it was also more prone to collapse.

When the first stone blocks were laid down at Potsdamer Platz in the early hours of August 13, US troops stood ready with ammunition and watched the wall being built, stone by stone. The US military with West Berlin police kept Berliners 300 meters away from the border. President John F. Kennedy and the United States Congress decided not to interfere and risk armed conflict. They conveyed their protest to Moscow, and Kennedy sent his vice president, Lyndon B. Johnson, together with Lucius D. Clay, the hero of the Airlift to the city. Massive demonstrations took place in West Berlin.

Almost two years later, on June 26, 1963, John F. Kennedy visited West Berlin and gave a much-acclaimed speech in front of the Schöneberg City Hall in which he said, &quot;Ich bin ein Berliner&quot;– &quot;I am a Berliner&quot;. This was meant to demonstrate America&#x27;s lasting solidarity with the city as a Western island in Soviet satellite territory.

Much Cold War espionage and counter-espionage took place in Berlin, against a backdrop of potential superpower confrontation in which both sides had nuclear weapons set for a range that could hit Germany. In 1971, the Four-Power Agreement on Berlin was signed. While the Soviet Union applied the oversight of the four powers only to West Berlin, the Western Allies emphasized in a 1975 note to the United Nations their position that four-power oversight applied to Berlin as a whole. The agreement guaranteed access across East Germany to West Berlin and ended the potential for harassment or closure of the routes.

As many businesses did not want to operate in West Berlin due to its physical and economic isolation from the outside, the West German government subsidized any businesses that did operate in West Berlin.

=== Student movement ===
In the 1960s, West Berlin became one of the centers of the German student movement. West Berlin was especially popular with young German left-wing radicals, as young men living in West Berlin were exempted from the obligatory military service required in West Germany proper: the Kreuzberg district became especially well known for its high concentration of young radicals.

The Wall afforded unique opportunities for social gatherings. The physical wall was set some distance behind the actual sector border, up to several meters behind in some places. The West Berlin police were not legally allowed to enter the space between the border and the wall, as it was technically in East Berlin and outside their jurisdiction: many people took the opportunity to throw loud parties in this space, with the West Berlin authorities powerless to intervene. In 1968 and after, West Berlin became one of the centers of the student revolt; in particular, the Kreuzberg borough was the center of many riots.

=== 750th anniversary ===
== Federal Republic of Germany (1990–today) ==
=== Reunification ===
The Fall of the Berlin Wall in November 1989 ended the 28-year-long division of Berlin. On the morning of 9 November 1989, SED member Günter Schabowski announced at a press conference that border restrictions would be lifted between East and West Berlin. Although the conditions of the press release had been intended to be only temporary, Schabowski gave the impression that all restrictions would be lifted immediately, leading to large crowds forming on the eastern side of the border. Overwhelmed by the unexpected pressure, at 11:30 PM, border guards eventually allowed crowds from East Berlin to cross the frontier at the Bornholmer Strasse crossing. People of East and West Berlin climbed up and danced on the wall at the Brandenburg Gate in scenes of celebration broadcast worldwide. The checkpoints never closed again, and was soon on its way to demolition, with countless Berliners and tourists wielding hammers and chisels to secure souvenir chunks.

=== Capital ===
After the fall of Communism in Europe, on 3 October 1990 Germany and Berlin were both reunited. By then the Wall had been almost completely demolished, with only small sections remaining. Various impacts of partition on Berlin were removed in subsequent months – the ghost stations of Berlin U-Bahn were reopened and the Berlin S-Bahn which had been operated by the east German Deutsche Reichsbahn also in the west (until 1984) and consequently boycotted and neglected in the west was refurbished and traffic on the Berlin ring railway resumed along its full length in 2002. Still, many S-Bahn lines shut down during partition are not yet rebuilt as of 2020.

In June 1991 the German Parliament, the Bundestag, voted to move the (West) German capital back from Bonn to Berlin. The decision was reached after 10 hours of debate. In the voting Berlin won by a narrow margin: 338 for, 320 against. Berlin once more became the capital of a unified Germany.

In 1999 federal ministries and government offices moved back from Bonn to Berlin, but most employees in the ministries still work in Bonn. Also in 1999, about 20 government authorities moved from Bonn to Berlin, as planned in the compensation agreement of 1994, the Berlin/Bonn Act.

Berlin has been targeted by terrorists on several occasions; the most severe incident being a vehicle-ramming attack in 2016 that killed 13 and injured 55.

The number of Arabic speakers in Berlin could be higher than 150,000. There are at least 40,000 Berliners with Syrian citizenship, third only behind Turkish and Polish citizens. The 2015 refugee crisis made Berlin Europe&#x27;s capital of Arab culture. However, Berlin has the largest Turkish community outside of Turkey, resulting from immigration from Turkey in the 1950s, 1960s and 1970s.

In 2022, Berlin&#x27;s former Tegel airport was re-opened as a refugee center. Berlin is among the cities in Germany that have received the biggest amount of refugees after the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine. As of November 2022, estimated 85,000 Ukrainian refugees were registered in Berlin, making Berlin the most popular destination of Ukrainian refugees in Germany.

In April 2023, Berlin got its first conservative mayor, Kai Wegner of CDU, in more than two decades.

Today, Berlin has become a global city for international affairs, young business founders, creative industries, higher education services, corporate research, popular media and diverse cultural tourism. Population-wise, Berlin became one of the most rapidly growing urban centers in Europe after 2010, much of which has been due to immigration.

=== Land Changes of Berlin ===
While the status of west Berlin was &quot;de facto&quot; that of a &quot;Bundesland&quot; of west Germany, the &quot;de jure&quot; situation remained unclear until reunification made it a moot point. In the 1990s there was an attempt to merge the &quot;Land&quot; with the adjacent State of Brandenburg which failed in a referendum due to opposition in Brandenburg. The Berlin banking scandal of 2001 led to the Berlin&#x27;s worst financial crisis since the second world war and strained state finances and caused austerity measures under then senator of finances Thilo Sarrazin. After the breakdown of Eberhard Diepgen&#x27;s grand coalition over the banking scandal the snap 2001 Berlin state election produced the first German state government led by an openly homosexual man, Klaus Wowereit.
Potsdamer Platz which had been a central traffic and commerce hub in the 1920s but heavily impacted by the wall during partition became one of Europe&#x27;s biggest building sites and is now once again one of Berlin&#x27;s most representative addresses. The museums on Museum Island were renovated and are once again museums of world renown. The Palast der Republik, the former seat of East Germany&#x27;s parliament was torn down to make way for the Humboldt Forum, a reconstruction of the former Stadtschloss (City Palace) on that site. The traffic infrastructure of Berlin became another post unification priority, leading to the shutdown of Tempelhof Airport in 2008, the opening of a new Berlin Hauptbahnhof in 2006, and finally the long delayed opening of Berlin Brandenburg Airport in 2020 accompanied by the shutdown of Tegel Airport. The Central bus station ZOB Berlin which opened in the 1960s has undergone renovations which began in 2016. The renovation was expected to last until September 2022.

<text>Baroreceptors (or archaically, pressoreceptors) are stretch receptors that sense blood pressure. Thus, increases in the pressure of blood vessel triggers increased action potential generation rates and provides information to the central nervous system. This sensory information is used primarily in autonomic reflexes that in turn influence the heart cardiac output and vascular smooth muscle to influence vascular resistance. Baroreceptors act immediately as part of a negative feedback system called the baroreflex as soon as there is a change from the usual mean arterial blood pressure, returning the pressure toward a normal level. These reflexes help regulate short-term blood pressure. The solitary nucleus in the medulla oblongata of the brain recognizes changes in the firing rate of action potentials from the baroreceptors, and influences cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.

Baroreceptors can be divided into two categories based on the type of blood vessel in which they are located: high-pressure arterial baroreceptors and low-pressure baroreceptors (also known as cardiopulmonary or volume receptors).

==Arterial baroreceptors==

Arterial baroreceptors are located in the carotid sinus (at the bifurcation of common carotid artery into external and internal carotids) and in the aortic arch. The baroreceptors can identify the changes in both the average blood pressure or the rate of change in pressure with each arterial pulse. Action potentials triggered in the baroreceptor ending are then directly conducted to the brainstem where central terminations (synapses) transmit this information to neurons within the solitary nucleus which lies in the medulla. Reflex responses from such baroreceptor activity can trigger increases or decreases in the heart rate. Arterial baroreceptor sensory endings are simple, splayed nerve endings that lie in the tunica adventitia of the artery. An increase in the mean arterial pressure increases depolarization of these sensory endings, which results in action potentials. These action potentials are conducted to the solitary nucleus in the central nervous system by axons and have a reflex effect on the cardiovascular system through autonomic neurons. Hormone secretions that target the heart and blood vessels are affected by the stimulation of baroreceptors.

At normal resting blood pressures, baroreceptors discharge with each heart beat. If blood pressure falls, such as on orthostatic hypotension or in hypovolaemic shock, baroreceptor firing rate decreases and baroreceptor reflexes act to help restore blood pressure by increasing heart rate. Signals from the carotid baroreceptors are sent via the glossopharyngeal nerve (cranial nerve IX). Signals from the aortic baroreceptors travel through the vagus nerve (cranial nerve X). Carotid sinus baroreceptors are responsive to both increases or decreases in arterial pressure, while aortic arch baroreceptors are only responsive to increases in arterial pressure. Arterial baroreceptors inform reflexes about arterial blood pressure but other stretch receptors in the large veins and right atrium convey information about the low pressure parts of the circulatory system.

Baroreceptors respond very quickly to maintain a stable blood pressure, but their responses diminish with time and thus are most effective for conveying short term changes in blood pressure. In people with essential hypertension the baroreceptors and their reflexes change and function to maintain the elevated blood pressure as if normal. The receptors then become less sensitive to change.

Electrical stimulation of baroreceptors has been found to activate the baroreflex, reducing sympathetic tone throughout the body and thereby reducing blood pressure in patients with resistant hypertension.

==Low-pressure baroreceptors==

The low-pressure baroreceptors are found in large systemic veins, in pulmonary vessels, and in the walls of the right atrium and ventricles of the heart (the atrial volume receptors). The low-pressure baroreceptors are involved with the regulation of blood volume. The blood volume determines the mean pressure throughout the system, in particular in the venous side where most of the blood is held.

The low-pressure baroreceptors have both circulatory and renal effects; they produce changes in hormone secretion, resulting in profound effects on the retention of salt and water; they also influence intake of salt and water. The renal effects allow the receptors to change the long-term mean pressure in the system.

==Baroreceptor dysfunction==
Baroreceptors are integral to the body&#x27;s function, as pressure changes in the blood vessels would not be detected as quickly in the absence of baroreceptors. When baroreceptors are not working, blood pressure continues to increase, but within an hour, the blood pressure returns to normal as other blood pressure regulatory systems take over.

Baroreceptors can also become oversensitive in some people (usually the carotid baroreceptors in older males). This can lead to bradycardia, dizziness and fainting (syncope) from touching the neck (often whilst shaving). This is an important cause to exclude in men having pre-syncope or syncope symptoms.

<doc id="242101" wikidata="Q921945" url="?curid=242101" title="John Williams (actor)">
<text>Hugh Ernest Leo Williams (15 April 1903 – 5 May 1983), known professionally as John Williams, was an English stage, film and television actor. He is remembered for his role as Chief Inspector Hubbard in Alfred Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;, as the chauffeur in Billy Wilder&#x27;s &quot;Sabrina&quot; (both 1954), as Mr. Brogan-Moore in &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957) and as the second &quot;Mr. French&quot; on TV&#x27;s &quot;Family Affair&quot; in its first season (1967).

==Life and work==
Born in Chalfont St Giles in Buckinghamshire, England, in 1903, Williams was educated at Lancing College. He began his acting career on the English stage in 1916, appearing in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Peter Pan,&quot; Frances Nordstrom&#x27;s &quot;The Ruined Lady&quot;, and Frederick Lonsdale&#x27;s &quot;The Fake.&quot; 

In 1924 Williams moved to New York, where he was cast in a series of successful Broadway productions. He would appear in over 30 Broadway plays over the next four decades, performing on stage with performers such as Claudette Colbert in Clifford Grey&#x27;s &quot;A Kiss in the Taxi&quot; in 1925, Helen Hayes in J. M. Barrie&#x27;s &quot;Alice Sit-by-the-Fire&quot; and Gertrude Lawrence in George Bernard Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Pygmalion&quot; in 1946. In 1953, Williams won a Tony Award for Actor, Supporting or Featured (Dramatic) for his role as Chief Inspector Hubbard in Frederick Knott&#x27;s &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot; on Broadway. Soon afterwards, when Alfred Hitchcock adapted the play to a film version released in 1954, he cast Williams in the same role.

Williams&#x27; first appearance in a Hollywood film was in director Mack Sennett&#x27;s short &quot;The Chumps&quot; (1930). He ultimately appeared in more than 40 films, including two other Hitchcock films: &quot;The Paradine Case&quot; (1947) starring Gregory Peck, in which Williams held a minor role as a barrister, and &quot;To Catch a Thief&quot; (1955) with Cary Grant and Grace Kelly, in which Williams portrayed a major character—a Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance representative. In the 1960 thriller &quot;Midnight Lace&quot;, starring Doris Day, Williams played a London police inspector much like his character in &quot;Dial M for Murder&quot;.

He also made more than 40 guest appearances on television shows. He played in several episodes of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; including: &quot;The Long Shot&quot; (1955), &quot;Back for Christmas&quot; (1956), &quot;Whodunit&quot; (1956), &quot;Wet Saturday&quot; (1956), &quot;The Rose Garden&quot; (1956), the three-part episode &quot;I Killed the Count&quot; (1957), &quot;The Three Dreams of Mr. Findlater&quot; (1957), and &quot;Banquo’s Chair&quot; (1959). Three of these episodes, &quot;Back for Christmas&quot;, &quot;Wet Saturday&quot;, and &quot;Banquo’s Chair&quot;, were directed by Hitchcock himself.

Williams played William Shakespeare in &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; episode &quot;The Bard&quot; (1963) and guest-starred on the sitcom &quot;My Three Sons&quot; (also 1963), portraying a stuffy, very precise English butler. In the latter role he was clean shaven, not sporting his customary mustache. Later, he was briefly part of the regular cast of the family comedy &quot;Family Affair&quot; (1967). He appeared as well on &quot;Night Gallery&quot; in the series&#x27; episode &quot;The Doll&quot; (1971). One of Williams&#x27; last performances was in 1979, playing alongside fellow actor Lorne Greene in a two-part episode of &quot;Battlestar Galactica&quot; titled &quot;War of the Gods&quot;.

Williams gained notice too as the star of a frequently telecast commercial for &quot;120 Music Masterpieces&quot;, a four-LP set of classical music excerpts from Columbia House. This became the longest-running nationally seen commercial in U.S. television history, for 13 years from 1971 to 1984. The commercial began with a brief selection of orchestral music being played. Williams then began the sales promotion with the following: 

In addition to his longstanding association with Hitchcock, Williams appeared in three Billy Wilder films over the course of his career: &quot;Sabrina&quot; (1954), &quot;Witness for the Prosecution&quot; (1957), and &quot;The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes&quot; (1970). In &quot;Holmes&quot;, however, his scenes were among the 60 to 75 minutes cut by the studio prior to the film&#x27;s release, when the studio decided not to release it in its intended roadshow format. Williams&#x27; scenes, along with the majority of the cut material, have not been recovered.

==Death==
Williams died at the age of 80 on 5 May 1983, in La Jolla, San Diego, California. It was reported at the time of his death that he had been suffering from a heart condition. He was cremated, and there was no funeral.

<text>John Williams (March 14, 1731 – October 10, 1799), born in Surry County, North Carolina, was a Founding Father of the United States and signer of its Articles of Confederation. He was one of the founders of the University of North Carolina. During the American Revolutionary War, Williams was a colonel in the North Carolina militia. In 1777 and 1778, he was a member of the North Carolina House of Commons and served as speaker of the House. Williams was a member of the Continental Congress in 1778 and 1779. 

Willams served as a superior court judge both during the colonial era and after the new state of North Carolina was established in 1776. Sitting alongside other superior court judges as part of a Court of Conference (forerunner to the North Carolina Supreme Court), Williams heard the landmark case, &quot;Bayard v. Singleton&quot;, which announced the principle of judicial review on the state level before &quot;Marbury v. Madison&quot; did so on the federal level.

Both men participated in the Battle of Moore&#x27;s Creek Bridge on February 27, 1776. All minutemen regiments were disbanded on April 10, 1776. He was a colonel and commandant of the 9th North Carolina Regiment of the North Carolina Line from 1776 to 1778.

==Death and legacy==
Williams died on October 10, 1799. The town of Williamsboro, North Carolina, for which he donated the land, is named for Williams. Williams was a first cousin and law partner of Judge Richard Henderson.

<doc id="242103" wikidata="Q1241783" url="?curid=242103" title="John Williams (missionary)">
<text>John Williams (29 June 1796 – 20 November 1839) was an English missionary, active in the South Pacific.

==Early life==
He was born in Tottenham, near London, to Welsh parents. In 1810 the family moved to north London and there he served as a clerk to an iron foundry. He also took some interest in smithing. There his employer&#x27;s wife first took him to church and he was immediately drawn to this, and the pastor, Rev Nathan Wilks, enrolled him in a class to prepare for the ministry. However, his heart quickly became set on missionary work.

In September 1816, the London Missionary Society (LMS) commissioned him as a missionary in a service held at Surrey Chapel, London.

==South Pacific missionary==

On 17 November 1816, John Williams and his wife, Mary Chawner Williams, set sail from London to voyage to the Society Islands, a group of islands that included Tahiti, accompanied by William Ellis and his wife. Travelling via Sydney in Australia they initially only reached as far as Eimeo, west of Tahiti. He then spent at least 6 months there helping to build a boat before eventually reaching Tahiti in the autumn of 1817.

John and Mary established their first missionary post on the island of Raiatea. From there, they visited a number of the Polynesian island chains, sometimes with Mr and Mrs Ellis and other London Missionary Society representatives. Landing on Aitutaki in 1821, they used Tahitian converts to carry their message to the Cook islanders. One island in this group, Rarotonga (Captain John Dibbs of the colonial schooner &quot;Endeavour&quot; in August 1823 was the first European to sight the islands, with Rev. Williams on board), rises out of the sea as jungle-covered mountains of orange soil ringed by coral reef and turquoise lagoon; Williams became fascinated by it. John and Mary had ten children, but only three survived to adulthood. The Williamses became the first missionary family to visit Samoa.

In 1827 Williams had heard of other heathen islands in the vicinity and in order to expand his ministry he built a ship from local materials, &quot;Messenger of Peace&quot;, in fifteen weeks. He set sail by November 1827 for the &quot;Society Islands&quot;, not returning till February 1828, when he then removed his family to Raiatea.

John Williams arrived in Samoa in 1830, among his crew, a Samoan couple, Fauea and his wife Puaseisei, who joined them on their voyage and proved pivotal in the mission in Samoa. They set foot on the island of Savaii at Puaseisei&#x27;s village of Safune, before arriving at Sapapalii on the 24th of August, 1830, to meet with Malietoa Vaiinuupo who had sole power over Samoa following the death of his rival Tamafaiga. Williams&#x27; meeting with Malietoa proved a success, as Malietoa accepted Christianity immediately.

The Williamses returned in 1834 to Britain, where John supervised the printing of his translation of the New Testament into the Rarotongan language. They brought back a native of Samoa named Leota, who came to live as a Christian in London. At the end of his days, Leota was buried in Abney Park Cemetery with a dignified headstone paid for by the London Missionary Society, recording his adventure from the South Seas island of his birth. Whilst back in London, John Williams published a &quot;Narrative of Missionary Enterprises in the South Sea Islands&quot;, making a contribution to English understanding and popularity of the region, before returning to the Polynesian islands in 1837 on the ship &quot;Camden&quot; under the command of Captain Robert Clark Morgan.

==Death==
Most of the Williamses&#x27; missionary work, and his delivery of a cultural message, were very successful and he became famed in Congregational circles. However, in November 1839, while visiting a part of the New Hebrides where John Williams was unknown, he and fellow missionary James Harris were killed and eaten by cannibals on the island of Erromango during an attempt to bring them the Gospel.

A memorial stone was erected on the island of Rarotonga in 1839 and is still there. Mrs. Williams died in June 1852. She is buried with their son Rev Samuel Tamatoa Williams, who was born in the New Hebrides, at the old Cedar Circle in London&#x27;s Abney Park Cemetery; the name of her husband and the record of his death were placed on the most prominent side of the stone monument. John Williams&#x27; remains (bones) were shipped and are buried in Apia, Samoa. A monument was erected in front of the LMS church of Apia, and the six-storey headquarters of the Congregational Church of Samoa is named after John Williams, commemorating his work in the Samoan islands.

==Legacy==

The LMS successively operated seven missionary ships in the Pacific which were named after John Williams. They were funded by donations from children. The first, &quot;John Williams&quot;, was launched in 1844, and the last, &quot;John Williams VII&quot;, was decommissioned in 1968.

In December 2009 descendants of John and Mary Williams travelled to Erromango to accept the apologies of descendants of the cannibals in a ceremony of reconciliation. To mark the occasion, Dillons Bay was renamed Williams Bay.

The film premiered on February 17, 1983. It received critical acclaim, and holds a 100% rating on Rotten Tomatoes. At the 37th British Academy Film Awards, the film was nominated for seven BAFTA Awards and won Best Direction for Forsyth. In 1999, the British Film Institute ranked the film as one of the Top 100 British films of the 20th century.

A stage musical adaptation of the same name, written by Forsyth and Knopfler, premiered in 2019.

==Plot==
&quot;Mac&quot; MacIntyre is an aspiring executive working for Knox Oil and Gas in Houston, Texas. Felix Happer, the company&#x27;s eccentric owner, chooses Mac because of his Scottish sounding surname to acquire Ferness, a village in the Scottish Highlands, to make way for a refinery. Mac, actually of Hungarian extraction, is apprehensive about the assignment, complaining to a co-worker that he would rather handle business over the phone and via telex. Happer, an avid amateur astronomer, tells Mac to watch the sky and to notify him immediately if he sees anything unusual. 

Arriving in Scotland, Mac teams up with local Knox representative Danny Oldsen. When they visit a Knox research facility in Aberdeen, Dr Geddes explains the plan to replace Ferness with the refinery. They also meet marine researcher Marina. 

Mac spends several days in Ferness, gradually adapting to the slower-paced life and getting to know the residents, most notably hotel owner and accountant Gordon Urquhart and his wife Stella. Mac becomes more and more conflicted as he presses to close the deal that will demolish the village he has come to love. The villagers, however, are tired of their hard life and are more than eager to sell, though they feign indifference to induce a larger offer. Mac receives encouragement from an unlikely source: Victor, a capitalistic Soviet fishing boat captain who periodically visits his friends in Ferness and checks on his investment portfolio, managed by Gordon. 

Meanwhile, Danny befriends Marina, who is under the impression that the company is planning to build a research centre at Ferness. During a date, he discovers that Marina, who seems more at home in the water than on land, has webbed toes. While watching some grey seals, Danny mentions that sailors used to believe they were mermaids. Marina tells him the sailors were wrong.

As the deal nears completion, Gordon discovers that Ben Knox, an old beachcomber who lives in a driftwood shack on the shore, owns the beach through a grant from the Lord of the Isles to his ancestor. MacIntyre tries everything to entice Ben to sell, even offering enough money to buy any other beach in the world, but the owner is content with what he has. Ben picks up some sand and offers to sell for the same number of pound notes as he has grains of sand in his hand. A suspicious MacIntyre declines, only to be told there could not have been more than ten thousand grains.

Happer finally arrives on site, just in time to unknowingly forestall a potential confrontation between some of the villagers and Ben. When Mac informs him of the snag in the proceedings, he decides to negotiate personally with Ben and, in the process, discovers a kindred spirit. Happer opts to relocate the refinery offshore and set up an astronomical observatory instead. He sends MacIntyre home to implement the changes. Danny brings up Marina&#x27;s dream of an oceanographic research facility and suggests combining the two into the &quot;Happer Institute&quot;, an idea that Happer likes. A sombre MacIntyre returns to his apartment in Houston. He pulls from his pocket pebbles and shells and spreads them out on the work surface. The local phone box in Ferness starts ringing.

==Cast==
==Production==
===Development===
Warner Bros. and Goldcrest Films originally declined to fund &quot;Local Hero&quot;. However, when Puttnam won a BAFTA for &quot;Chariots of Fire&quot; in 1982, Goldcrest agreed to finance the entire film. Warner Bros. agreed to pay $1.5 million for US rights.

===Casting===
Puttnam always wanted Burt Lancaster to play Happer but the casting proved problematic because the Hollywood star wanted his $2 million salary, which was almost a third of the film&#x27;s entire budget. Upon learning of Lancaster&#x27;s potential involvement in the project, Warner Bros. offered Puttnam a US distribution deal and provided the additional funding to secure Lancaster. After negotiations, Puttnam ended up having an additional $200,000 in the film&#x27;s budget. He later remarked in an interview that &quot;big stars are not a liability, they are an asset!&quot;.

Michael Douglas and Henry Winkler were both actively pursued by Bill Forsyth for the role of MacIntyre (which ultimately went to Peter Riegert).

===Filming===
&quot;Local Hero&quot; was filmed in several locations around Scotland. Most of the Ferness village scenes were filmed in Pennan on the Aberdeenshire coast, and most of the beach scenes at Morar and Arisaig on the west coast.

===Soundtrack===
The film&#x27;s soundtrack was written and produced by Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits. This has led to the popularity of the film with fans of the band. Knopfler has since performed an arrangement of &quot;Going Home (Theme of the Local Hero)&quot; as an encore at many of his concerts. This tune borrows some melodic riffs from traditional songs. In his review of the album for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann wrote:

Knopfler re-recorded the theme with fellow guitarists including Bruce Springsteen, Brian May and Jeff Beck (credited as &#x27;Mark Knopfler&#x27;s Guitar Heroes&#x27;) in aid of Teenage Cancer Trust in March 2024. The track peaked at #18 on the UK singles chart.

Gerry Rafferty provided the vocals for &quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot; on the soundtrack. The album was certified a BPI silver record.

==Critical response==
In his &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot; review, Roger Ebert gave the film his highest four stars, calling it &quot;a small film to treasure&quot;. He gave particular praise to writer-director Bill Forsyth for his abilities as a storyteller.

James Berardinelli gave the film three and a half stars out of four, calling it &quot;a fragment of cinematic whimsy—a genial dramatic comedy that defies both our expectations and those of the characters&quot;. Berardinelli also focused on Forsyth&#x27;s abilities as a storyteller, noting that the director &quot;finds the perfect tone for this not-quite-a-fairy-tale set in a quaint seaside Scottish village named Ferness. By injecting a little (but not too much) magical realism into the mix, Forsyth leavens his pro-environmental message to the point that those not looking for it might not be conscious of its presence.&quot; Berardinelli concluded that &quot;Local Hero&quot; represents &quot;the best kind of light fare: a motion picture that offers a helping of substance to go along with an otherwise frothy and undemanding main course&quot;.

&quot;The New York Times&quot; critic Janet Maslin wrote, &quot;Genuine fairy tales are rare; so is film-making that is thoroughly original in an unobtrusive way. Bill Forsyth&#x27;s quirky disarming &quot;Local Hero&quot; is both.&quot; Maslin concluded:
In &quot;Variety&quot; magazine, film critic Todd McCarthy wrote, &quot;After making the grade internationally with the sleeper hit, &quot;Gregory&#x27;s Girl&quot;, Scottish writer-director Bill Forsyth has broken the sophomore sesh jinx the only way he could, by making an even better film ... Given a larger canvas, director Forsyth has in no way attempted to overreach himself or the material, keeping things modest and intimate throughout, but displaying a very acute sense of comic insight.&quot;

Almar Haflidason called &quot;Local Hero&quot; &quot;a wry film that slowly slips under the skin to surprising effect&quot; in &quot;BBC Home&quot;. Haflidason concludes, &quot;Once over, the mood of the film hits home and a longing develops to visit once again the characters of this warm and deceptively slight comedy.&quot;

For &quot;Movie Gazette&quot;, Gary Panton described the film as a &quot;magical, intelligent comedy&quot;. Panton praised the cinematography as &quot;little short of amazing&quot; and that &quot;Local Hero&quot; was &quot;Bill Forsyth&#x27;s finest work of all, this is a perfect film.&quot;

During his 2000 campaign for the presidency, U.S. Vice President Al Gore told Oprah Winfrey in an interview that &quot;Local Hero&quot; was his favorite film.

On Rotten Tomatoes, the film received a 100% rating based on 40 reviews, with an average rating of 8.80/10. The site&#x27;s consensus reads: &quot;A charmingly low-key character study brought to life by a tremendously talented cast, &quot;Local Hero&quot; is as humorous as it is heartwarming&quot;. On Metacritic, the film has a score of 84 out of 100, based on reviews from 16 critics.

Some Scottish critics were less enthusiastic about the film, pointing out that it repeated and reinforced long-established cinematic representations of Scotland and the Scots and perpetuated a comforting but misleading narrative about Scotland&#x27;s relationship with international capitalism. The Glasgow Women and Film Collective questioned what it saw as the film&#x27;s male-oriented narrative about innocence and power and the marginal roles it accorded to women.

==Box office==
&quot;Local Hero&quot; earned $5,895,761 in total gross sales in the United States. It earned distributors gross of £487,437 in the UK.

Goldcrest Films invested £2,551,000 in the film and received £3,290,000, earning them a profit of £739,000.

==Accolades==
==Legacy==
The minor planet 7345 Happer is named after Lancaster&#x27;s character in the film and his quest to have a comet named after him.

== Stage musical adaptation ==

A stage musical based on the film premiered at the Royal Lyceum Theatre, Edinburgh in 2019. The musical featured music and lyrics by Mark Knopfler (writer of the film soundtrack) and a book by Bill Forsyth (original film screenwriter and director) and David Greig, and was directed by John Crowley.

<text>Newport Rugby Football Club () is a Welsh rugby union club based in the city of Newport, Wales. They presently play in the Super Rygbi Cymru. Until 2021 Newport RFC were based at Rodney Parade situated on the east bank of the River Usk.

Every major rugby union touring team to visit Wales has played at Rodney Parade, and all of them were beaten at least once in the twentieth century by a side who, in 1951, played in the match at Cardiff RFC that attracted what was, a world-record crowd of 48,500 for a rugby union match between two clubs.

In addition to matches against all the major national sides a highlight of the Newport season was the annual match against the Barbarians, ensuring that the Newport fans enjoyed watching world-class players to supplement the Welsh internationals who were a common feature of the &#x27;Black and Ambers&#x27;.

Newport supplied over 150 players to the Wales national team and international players to England, Scotland, Ireland, South Africa, Czech Republic, Canada and Fiji as well as over 80 Barbarians.

Following the regionalisation of Welsh rugby in 2003, Newport RFC are now a feeder club to the Dragons regional team.

In March 2017, sale of Rodney Parade to the Welsh Rugby Union was agreed following a vote of Newport RFC shareholders. The takeover was completed on 27 June 2017 and work started to install a hybrid grass pitch for the 2017–18 rugby and football season.

In October 2021 Newport RFC relocated their home matches to Newport Stadium whilst agreeing with the WRU to play two matches per season at Rodney Parade.

==History==

===1874–1914===

Newport RFC were formed in 1874 under the financial backing of the Phillips brewing family, and the playing talents of former pupils of Monmouth School, a public school which had adopted rugby union in 1873. Newport was originally intended as an association football club, but was unable to find any opponents, but they managed to organise a rugby match against Cardiff RFC, and in 1875 played Cardiff in both clubs&#x27; first-ever game.

Newport&#x27;s early success was remarkable, winning every match in their first four seasons between 1875 and 1879. They were also successful in other tournaments winning the first two South Wales Cup competitions. The club&#x27;s strength was reflected at international level, providing more players to the Welsh national team than any other club in the nineteenth century, including four captains. In 1881 Newport was one of the eleven clubs present at the forming of the Welsh Rugby Football Union, and provided six players in the first Welsh international match, more than any other club.
Partially due to their geographical location Newport also played against more established clubs from England and in 1878 a game was arranged against Manchester Athletic followed by games against Birmingham, Clifton, Gloucester and Swindon. Their dominance led Newport&#x27;s club secretary, Richard Mulloch to arrange a match against the English domestic champions Blackheath Rugby Club. With a record attendance of 5,000 spectators Newport were out-classed by their opponents, losing four goals and eight tries to nil. However, Newport had played two games in the previous five days and Blackheath brought in outside players to bolster their squad.

In October 1879 Newport played Cardiff RFC in a floodlit game at Rodney Parade; the first ground to have floodlights installed in Wales.

In 1887, Newport player Charlie Newman was given the captaincy of the Welsh national team, he was the first Newport player to achieve this honour. In 1887 Newport player Tom Clapp was given the Wales captaincy and in 1888 he led the first Welsh side to beat Scotland, a team that included Newport players Powell and Gould. During the 1891–92 season, under captain Tom Graham Newport went unbeaten, winning 29 games and drawing four. Graham brought a new professional attitude to the team, introducing weekly gym training and an avoidance of alcohol.

In 1912 Newport hosted the touring South Africa national team, and beat them 9 points to 3.

===1919–1939===
*Invincible in 1922–23
*Welsh Club Champions 1920,1923.
*Provided 5 Welsh, 1 English and 1 Irish captains.
*Provided 6 British Lions.

*Introduced squad systems / players playing on rota in Wales.
*Won Welsh Cup twice, R/U 3 times.
*Welsh Premier League winners and R/U – twice.

In 1963 Newport, captained by Brian Price, claimed perhaps their greatest victory by defeating New Zealand led by Wilson Whineray 3–0. This turned out to be the All Blacks&#x27; only defeat on their 1963 tour. The club was granted Freedom of the City of Newport on the 50th anniversary of this victory.

After rugby turned professional in 1995, Newport initially struggled, being relegated after finishing bottom of the eight-team Welsh Premier Division in 1998, only to be reinstated after Cardiff and Swansea 1998–99 Welsh rugby union rebel season over a dispute with the WRU. After staying up, Newport then moved to full-time professionalism for the 1999–2000 season with the help of benefactor Tony Brown, who financed marquee signings including former South Africa captain Gary Teichmann. The first game of the season against Cardiff drew a crowd of almost 7,000, the biggest since the visit of the All Blacks in 1989. This was accompanied by a rise in season ticket sales from 700 the previous season to 3,300, with a further increase to 4,000 expected the following year.

In 2003, Newport merged with Ebbw Vale to form the Gwent Dragons side (soon renamed Newport Gwent Dragons) as part of the Introduction of regional rugby union teams in Wales. Newport RFC continued to compete as an amateur side, later semi-professional, in the Welsh club league.

===2003–Present===
Newport finished the 2021–22 Indigo Group Premiership in second place, having sat the top of table of most of the season. They did, however, win the Premiership Cup with a 25–21 victory over Aberavon at the Millennium Stadium.

<doc id="242110" wikidata="Q596579" url="?curid=242110" title="Cardiac output">
<text>In cardiac physiology, cardiac output (CO), also known as heart output and often denoted by the symbols formula_1, formula_2, or formula_3, is the volumetric flow rate of the heart&#x27;s pumping output: that is, the volume of blood being pumped by a single ventricle of the heart, per unit time (usually measured per minute). Cardiac output (CO) is the product of the heart rate (HR), i.e. the number of heartbeats per minute (bpm), and the stroke volume (SV), which is the volume of blood pumped from the left ventricle per beat; thus giving the formula:
:formula_4
Values for cardiac output are usually denoted as L/min. For a healthy individual weighing 70 kg, the cardiac output at rest averages about 5 L/min; assuming a heart rate of 70 beats/min, the stroke volume would be approximately 70 mL.

Because cardiac output is related to the quantity of blood delivered to various parts of the body, it is an important component of how efficiently the heart can meet the body&#x27;s demands for the maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion. Body tissues require continuous oxygen delivery which requires the sustained transport of oxygen to the tissues by systemic circulation of oxygenated blood at an adequate pressure from the left ventricle of the heart via the aorta and arteries. Oxygen delivery (DO2 mL/min) is the resultant of blood flow (cardiac output CO) times the blood oxygen content (CaO2). Mathematically this is calculated as follows: oxygen delivery = cardiac output × arterial oxygen content, giving the formula:
:formula_5
With a resting cardiac output of 5 L/min, a &#x27;normal&#x27; oxygen delivery is around 1 L/min. The amount/percentage of the circulated oxygen consumed (VO2) per minute through metabolism varies depending on the activity level but at rest is circa 25% of the DO2. Physical exercise requires a higher than resting-level of oxygen consumption to support increased muscle activity. Regular aerobic exercise can induce physiological adaptations such as improved stroke volume and myocardial efficiency that increase cardiac output. In the case of heart failure, actual CO may be insufficient to support even simple activities of daily living; nor can it increase sufficiently to meet the higher metabolic demands stemming from even moderate exercise.

Cardiac output is a global blood flow parameter of interest in hemodynamics, the study of the flow of blood. The factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate also affect cardiac output. The figure at the right margin illustrates this dependency and lists some of these factors. A detailed hierarchical illustration is provided in a subsequent figure.

There are many methods of measuring CO, both invasively and non-invasively; each has advantages and drawbacks as described below.

==Definition==
The function of the heart is to drive blood through the circulatory system in a cycle that delivers oxygen, nutrients and chemicals to the body&#x27;s cells and removes cellular waste. Because it pumps out whatever blood comes back into it from the venous system, the quantity of blood returning to the heart effectively determines the quantity of blood the heart pumps out – its cardiac output, &quot;Q&quot;. Cardiac output is classically defined alongside stroke volume (SV) and the heart rate (HR) as:
In standardizing what CO values are considered to be within normal range independent of the size of the subject&#x27;s body, the accepted convention is to further index equation () using body surface area (BSA), giving rise to the Cardiac index (CI). This is detailed in equation () below.

== Measurement ==
There are a number of clinical methods to measure cardiac output, ranging from direct intracardiac catheterization to non-invasive measurement of the arterial pulse. Each method has advantages and drawbacks. Relative comparison is limited by the absence of a widely accepted &quot;gold standard&quot; measurement. Cardiac output can also be affected significantly by the phase of respiration – intra-thoracic pressure changes influence diastolic filling and therefore cardiac output. This is especially important during mechanical ventilation, in which cardiac output can vary by up to 50% across a single respiratory cycle. Cardiac output should therefore be measured at evenly spaced points over a single cycle or averaged over several cycles.

Invasive methods are well accepted, but there is increasing evidence that these methods are neither accurate nor effective in guiding therapy. Consequently, the focus on development of non-invasive methods is growing.

===Doppler ultrasound===
This method uses ultrasound and the Doppler effect to measure cardiac output. The blood velocity through the heart causes a Doppler shift in the frequency of the returning ultrasound waves. This shift can then be used to calculate flow velocity and volume, and effectively cardiac output, using the following equations:
* formula_6
* formula_7
* formula_8
where:
* CSA is the valve orifice cross sectional area,
* r is the valve radius, and,
* VTI is the velocity time integral of the trace of the Doppler flow profile.

Being non-invasive, accurate and inexpensive, Doppler ultrasound is a routine part of clinical ultrasound; it has high levels of reliability and reproducibility, and has been in clinical use since the 1960s.

====Echocardiography====
Echocardiography is a non-invasive method of quantifying cardiac output using ultrasound. Two-dimensional (2D) ultrasound and Doppler measurements are used together to calculate cardiac output. 2D measurement of the diameter (d) of the aortic annulus allows calculation of the flow cross-sectional area (CSA), which is then multiplied by the VTI of the Doppler flow profile across the aortic valve to determine the flow volume per beat (stroke volume, SV). The result is then multiplied by the heart rate (HR) to obtain cardiac output. Although used in clinical medicine, it has a wide test-retest variability. It is said to require extensive training and skill, but the exact steps needed to achieve clinically adequate precision have never been disclosed. 2D measurement of the aortic valve diameter is one source of noise; others are beat-to-beat variation in stroke volume and subtle differences in probe position. An alternative that is not necessarily more reproducible is the measurement of the pulmonary valve to calculate right-sided CO. Although it is in wide general use, the technique is time-consuming and is limited by the reproducibility of its component elements. In the manner used in clinical practice, precision of SV and CO is of the order of ±20%.

====Transcutaneous====
Ultrasonic Cardiac Output Monitor (USCOM) uses continuous wave Doppler to measure the Doppler flow profile VTI. It uses anthropometry to calculate aortic and pulmonary valve diameters and CSAs, allowing right-sided and left-sided &quot;Q&quot; measurements. In comparison to the echocardiographic method, USCOM significantly improves reproducibility and increases sensitivity of the detection of changes in flow. Real-time, automatic tracing of the Doppler flow profile allows beat-to-beat right-sided and left-sided &quot;Q&quot; measurements, simplifying operation and reducing the time of acquisition compared to conventional echocardiography. USCOM has been validated from 0.12 L/min to 18.7 L/min in new-born babies, children and adults. The method can be applied with equal accuracy to patients of all ages for the development of physiologically rational haemodynamic protocols. USCOM is the only method of cardiac output measurement to have achieved equivalent accuracy to the implantable flow probe. This accuracy has ensured high levels of clinical use in conditions including sepsis, heart failure and hypertension.

====Transoesophageal====
The Transoesophageal Doppler includes two main technologies; transoesophageal echocardiogram—which is primarily used for diagnostic purposes, and oesophageal Doppler monitoring—which is primarily used for the clinical monitoring of cardiac output. The latter uses continuous wave Doppler to measure blood velocity in the descending thoracic aorta. An ultrasound probe is inserted either orally or nasally into the oesophagus to mid-thoracic level, at which point the oesophagus lies alongside the descending thoracic aorta. Because the transducer is close to the blood flow, the signal is clear. The probe may require re-focussing to ensure an optimal signal. This method has good validation, is widely used for fluid management during surgery with evidence for improved patient outcome, and has been recommended by the UK&#x27;s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE). Oesophageal Doppler monitoring measures the velocity of blood and not true &quot;Q&quot;, therefore relies on a nomogram based on patient age, height and weight to convert the measured velocity into stroke volume and cardiac output. This method generally requires patient sedation and is accepted for use in both adults and children.

===Pulse pressure methods===
Pulse pressure (PP) methods measure the pressure in an artery over time to derive a waveform and use this information to calculate cardiac performance. However, any measure from the artery includes changes in pressure associated with changes in arterial function, for example compliance and impedance. Physiological or therapeutic changes in vessel diameter are assumed to reflect changes in &quot;Q&quot;. PP methods measure the combined performance of the heart and the blood vessels, thus limiting their application for measurement of &quot;Q&quot;. This can be partially compensated for by intermittent calibration of the waveform to another &quot;Q&quot; measurement method then monitoring the PP waveform. Ideally, the PP waveform should be calibrated on a beat-to-beat basis. There are invasive and non-invasive methods of measuring PP.

==== Finapres methodology ====

In 1967, the Czech physiologist Jan Peňáz invented and patented the volume clamp method of measuring continuous blood pressure. The principle of the volume clamp method is to dynamically provide equal pressures, on either side of an artery wall. By clamping the artery to a certain volume, inside pressure—intra-arterial pressure—balances outside pressure—finger cuff pressure. Peñáz decided the finger was the optimal site to apply this volume clamp method. The use of finger cuffs excludes the device from application in patients without vasoconstriction, such as in sepsis or in patients on vasopressors.

In 1978, scientists at BMI-TNO, the research unit of Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research at the University of Amsterdam, invented and patented a series of additional key elements that make the volume clamp work in clinical practice. These methods include the use of modulated infrared light in the optical system inside the sensor, the lightweight, easy-to-wrap finger cuff with velcro fixation, a new pneumatic proportional control valve principle, and a set point strategy for the determining and tracking the correct volume at which to clamp the finger arteries—the Physiocal system. An acronym for physiological calibration of the finger arteries, this Physiocal tracker was found to be accurate, robust and reliable.

The Finapres methodology was developed to use this information to calculate arterial pressure from finger cuff pressure data. A generalised algorithm to correct for the pressure level difference between the finger and brachial sites in patients was developed. This correction worked under all of the circumstances it was tested in—even when it was not designed for it—because it applied general physiological principles. This innovative brachial pressure waveform reconstruction method was first implemented in the Finometer, the successor of Finapres that BMI-TNO introduced to the market in 2000.

The availability of a continuous, high-fidelity, calibrated blood pressure waveform opened up the perspective of beat-to-beat computation of integrated haemodynamics, based on two notions: pressure and flow are inter-related at each site in the arterial system by their so-called characteristic impedance. At the proximal aortic site, the 3-element Windkessel model of this impedance can be modelled with sufficient accuracy in an individual patient with known age, gender, height and weight. According to comparisons of non-invasive peripheral vascular monitors, modest clinical utility is restricted to patients with normal and invariant circulation.

====Invasive====
Invasive PP monitoring involves inserting a manometer pressure sensor into an artery—usually the radial or femoral artery—and continuously measuring the PP waveform. This is generally done by connecting the catheter to a signal processing device with a display. The PP waveform can then be analysed to provide measurements of cardiovascular performance. Changes in vascular function, the position of the catheter tip or damping of the pressure waveform signal will affect the accuracy of the readings. Invasive PP measurements can be calibrated or uncalibrated.

=====Calibrated PP – PiCCO, LiDCO=====
 (PULSION Medical Systems AG, Munich, Germany) and PulseCO (LiDCO Ltd, London, England) generate continuous &quot;Q&quot; by analysing the arterial PP waveform. In both cases, an independent technique is required to provide calibration of continuous &quot;Q&quot; analysis because arterial PP analysis cannot account for unmeasured variables such as the changing compliance of the vascular bed. Recalibration is recommended after changes in patient position, therapy or condition.

In PiCCO, transpulmonary thermodilution, which uses the Stewart-Hamilton principle but measures temperatures changes from central venous line to a central arterial line, i.e., the femoral or axillary arterial line, is used as the calibrating technique. The &quot;Q&quot; value derived from cold-saline thermodilution is used to calibrate the arterial PP contour, which can then provide continuous &quot;Q&quot; monitoring. The PiCCO algorithm is dependent on blood pressure waveform morphology (mathematical analysis of the PP waveform), and it calculates continuous &quot;Q&quot; as described by Wesseling and colleagues. Transpulmonary thermodilution spans right heart, pulmonary circulation and left heart, allowing further mathematical analysis of the thermodilution curve and giving measurements of cardiac filling volumes (), intrathoracic blood volume and extravascular lung water. Transpulmonary thermodilution allows for less invasive &quot;Q&quot; calibration but is less accurate than PA thermodilution and requires a central venous and arterial line with the accompanied infection risks.

In LiDCO, the independent calibration technique is lithium chloride dilution using the Stewart-Hamilton principle. Lithium chloride dilution uses a peripheral vein and a peripheral arterial line. Like PiCCO, frequent calibration is recommended when there is a change in Q. Calibration events are limited in frequency because they involve the injection of lithium chloride and can be subject to errors in the presence of certain muscle relaxants. The PulseCO algorithm used by LiDCO is based on pulse power derivation and is not dependent on waveform morphology.

=====Statistical analysis of arterial pressure – FloTrac/Vigileo=====

FloTrac/Vigileo (Edwards Lifesciences) is an uncalibrated, haemodynamic monitor based on pulse contour analysis. It estimates cardiac output (&quot;Q&quot;) using a standard arterial catheter with a manometer located in the femoral or radial artery. The device consists of a high-fidelity pressure transducer, which, when used with a supporting monitor (Vigileo or EV1000 monitor), derives left-sided cardiac output (&quot;Q&quot;) from a sample of arterial pulsations. The device uses an algorithm based on the Frank–Starling law of the heart, which states pulse pressure (PP) is proportional to stroke volume (SV). The algorithm calculates the product of the standard deviation of the arterial pressure (AP) wave over a sampled period of 20 seconds and a vascular tone factor (Khi, or χ) to generate stroke volume. The equation in simplified form is: formula_9, or, formula_10. Khi is designed to reflect arterial resistance; compliance is a multivariate polynomial equation that continuously quantifies arterial compliance and vascular resistance. Khi does this by analyzing the morphological changes of arterial pressure waveforms on a bit-by-bit basis, based on the principle that changes in compliance or resistance affect the shape of the arterial pressure waveform. By analyzing the shape of said waveforms, the effect of vascular tone is assessed, allowing the calculation of SV. &quot;Q&quot; is then derived using equation (). Only perfused beats that generate an arterial waveform are counted for in HR.

This system estimates Q using an existing arterial catheter with variable accuracy. These arterial monitors do not require intracardiac catheterisation from a pulmonary artery catheter. They require an arterial line and are therefore invasive. As with other arterial waveform systems, the short set-up and data acquisition times are benefits of this technology. Disadvantages include its inability to provide data regarding right-sided heart pressures or mixed venous oxygen saturation. The measurement of Stroke Volume Variation (SVV), which predicts volume responsiveness is intrinsic to all arterial waveform technologies. It is used for managing fluid optimisation in high-risk surgical or critically ill patients. A physiologic optimization program based on haemodynamic principles that incorporates the data pairs SV and SVV has been published.

Arterial monitoring systems are unable to predict changes in vascular tone; they estimate changes in vascular compliance. The measurement of pressure in the artery to calculate the flow in the heart is physiologically irrational and of questionable accuracy, and of unproven benefit. Arterial pressure monitoring is limited in patients off-ventilation, in atrial fibrillation, in patients on vasopressors, and in those with a dynamic autonomic system such as those with sepsis.

===== Uncalibrated, pre-estimated demographic data-free – PRAM =====
Pressure Recording Analytical Method (PRAM), estimates &quot;Q&quot; from the analysis of the pressure wave profile obtained from an arterial catheter—radial or femoral access. This PP waveform can then be used to determine &quot;Q&quot;. As the waveform is sampled at 1000 Hz, the detected pressure curve can be measured to calculate the actual beat-to-beat stroke volume. Unlike FloTrac, neither constant values of impedance from external calibration, nor form pre-estimated in vivo or in vitro data, are needed.

PRAM has been validated against the considered gold standard methods in stable condition and in various haemodynamic states. It can be used to monitor pediatric and mechanically supported patients.

Generally monitored haemodynamic values, fluid responsiveness parameters and an exclusive reference are provided by PRAM: Cardiac Cycle Efficiency (CCE). It is expressed by a pure number ranging from 1 (best) to -1 (worst) and it indicates the overall heart-vascular response coupling. The ratio between heart performance and consumed energy, represented as CCE &quot;stress index&quot;, can be of paramount importance in understanding the patient&#x27;s present and future courses.

===Impedance cardiography===

Impedance cardiography (often abbreviated as ICG, or Thoracic Electrical Bioimpedance (TEB)) measures changes in electrical impedance across the thoracic region over the cardiac cycle. Lower impedance indicates greater intrathoracic fluid volume and blood flow. By synchronizing fluid volume changes with the heartbeat, the change in impedance can be used to calculate stroke volume, cardiac output and systemic vascular resistance.

Both invasive and non-invasive approaches are used. The reliability and validity of the non-invasive approach has gained some acceptance, although there is not complete agreement on this point. The clinical use of this approach in the diagnosis, prognosis and therapy of a variety of diseases continues.

Non-invasive ICG equipment includes the Bio-Z Dx, the Niccomo, and TEBCO products by BoMed.

=== Ultrasound dilution ===
Ultrasound dilution (UD) uses body-temperature normal saline (NS) as an indicator introduced into an extracorporeal loop to create an atrioventricular (AV) circulation with an ultrasound sensor, which is used to measure the dilution then to calculate cardiac output using a proprietary algorithm. A number of other haemodynamic variables, such as total end-diastole volume (TEDV), central blood volume (CBV) and active circulation volume (ACVI) can be calculated using this method.

The UD method was firstly introduced in 1995. It was extensively used to measure flow and volumes with extracorporeal circuit conditions, such as ECMO and Haemodialysis, leading more than 150 peer reviewed publications. UD has now been adapted to intensive care units (ICU) as the COstatus device.

The UD method is based on ultrasound indicator dilution. Blood ultrasound velocity (1560–1585 m/s) is a function of total blood protein concentration—sums of proteins in plasma and in red blood red cells—and temperature. Injection of body-temperature normal saline (ultrasound velocity of saline is 1533 m/s) into a unique AV loop decreases blood ultrasound velocity, and produces dilution curves.

UD requires the establishment of an extracorporeal circulation through its unique AV loop with two pre-existing arterial and central venous lines in ICU patients. When the saline indicator is injected into the AV loop, it is detected by the venous clamp-on sensor on the loop before it enters the patient&#x27;s heart&#x27;s right atrium. After the indicator traverses the heart and lung, the concentration curve in the arterial line is recorded and displayed on the COstatus HCM101 Monitor. Cardiac output is calculated from the area of the concentration curve using the Stewart-Hamilton equation. UD is a non-invasive procedure, requiring only a connection to the AV loop and two lines from a patient. UD has been specialised for application in pediatric ICU patients and has been demonstrated to be relatively safe although invasive and reproducible.

===Electrical cardiometry===
Electrical cardiometry is a non-invasive method similar to Impedance cardiography; both methods measure thoracic electrical bioimpedance (TEB). The underlying model differs between the two methods; Electrical cardiometry attributes the steep increase of TEB beat-to-beat to the change in orientation of red blood cells. Four standard ECG electrodes are required for measurement of cardiac output. Electrical Cardiometry is a method trademarked by Cardiotronic, Inc., and shows promising results in a wide range of patients. It is currently approved in the US for use in adults, children and babies. Electrical cardiometry monitors have shown promise in postoperative cardiac surgical patients, in both haemodynamically stable and unstable cases.

===Magnetic resonance imaging===
Velocity-encoded phase contrast Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the most accurate technique for measuring flow in large vessels in mammals. MRI flow measurements have been shown to be highly accurate compared to measurements made with a beaker and timer, and less variable than the Fick principle and thermodilution.

Velocity-encoded MRI is based on the detection of changes in the phase of proton precession. These changes are proportional to the velocity of the protons&#x27; movement through a magnetic field with a known gradient. When using velocity-encoded MRI, the result is two sets of images, one for each time point in the cardiac cycle. One is an anatomical image and the other is an image in which the signal intensity in each pixel is directly proportional to the through-plane velocity. The average velocity in a vessel, i.e., the aorta or the pulmonary artery, is quantified by measuring the average signal intensity of the pixels in the cross-section of the vessel then multiplying by a known constant. The flow is calculated by multiplying the mean velocity by the cross-sectional area of the vessel. This flow data can be used in a flow-versus-time graph. The area under the flow-versus-time curve for one cardiac cycle is the stroke volume. The length of the cardiac cycle is known and determines heart rate; &quot;Q&quot; can be calculated using equation (). MRI is typically used to quantify the flow over one cardiac cycle as the average of several heart beats. It is also possible to quantify the stroke volume in real-time on a beat-for-beat basis.

While MRI is an important research tool for accurately measuring &quot;Q&quot;, it is currently not clinically used for haemodynamic monitoring in emergency or intensive care settings. , cardiac output measurement by MRI is routinely used in clinical cardiac MRI examinations.

=== Dye dilution method ===
The dye dilution method is done by rapidly injecting a dye, indocyanine green, into the right atrium of the heart. The dye flows with the blood into the aorta. A probe is inserted into the aorta to measure the concentration of the dye leaving the heart at equal time intervals [0, &quot;T&quot;] until the dye has cleared. Let &quot;c&quot;(&quot;t)&quot; be the concentration of the dye at time &quot;t&quot;. By dividing the time intervals from [0, &quot;T&quot;] into subintervals Δ&quot;t&quot;, the amount of dye that flows past the measuring point during the subinterval from formula_11 to formula_12 is:

formula_13

where formula_14 is the rate of flow that is being calculated. The total amount of dye is:

formula_15

and, letting formula_16, the amount of dye is:

formula_17

Thus, the cardiac output is given by:

formula_18

where the amount of dye injected formula_19 is known, and the integral can be determined using the concentration readings.

The dye dilution method is one of the most accurate methods of determining cardiac output during exercise. The error of a single calculation of cardiac output values at rest and during exercise is less than 5%. This method does not allow measurement of &#x27;beat to beat&#x27; changes, and requires a cardiac output that is stable for approximately 10 s during exercise and 30 s at rest.

==Factors influencing cardiac output==


Cardiac output is primarily controlled by the oxygen requirement of tissues in the body. In contrast to other pump systems, the heart is a demand pump that does not regulate its own output. When the body has a high metabolic oxygen demand, the metabolically controlled flow through the tissues is increased, leading to a greater flow of blood back to the heart, leading to higher cardiac output.

The capacitance, also known as compliance, of the arterio-vascular channels that carry the blood also controls cardiac output. As the body&#x27;s blood vessels actively expand and contract, the resistance to blood flow decreases and increases respectively. Thin-walled veins have about eighteen times the capacitance of thick-walled arteries because they are able to carry more blood by virtue of being more distensible.

From this formula, it is clear the factors affecting stroke volume and heart rate also affect cardiac output. The figure to the right illustrates this dependency and lists a few of these factors. A more detailed hierarchical illustration is provided in a subsequent figure.

Equation () reveals HR and SV to be the primary determinants of cardiac output Q. A detailed representation of these factors is illustrated in the figure to the right. The primary factors that influence HR are autonomic innervation plus endocrine control. Environmental factors, such as electrolytes, metabolic products, and temperature are not shown. The determinants of SV during the cardiac cycle are the contractility of the heart muscle, the degree of preload of myocardial distention prior to shortening and the afterload during ejection. Other factors such as electrolytes may be classified as either positive or negative inotropic agents.

=== Cardiac response ===
== Clinical significance ==
When &quot;Q&quot; increases in a healthy but untrained individual, most of the increase can be attributed to an increase in heart rate (HR). Change of posture, increased sympathetic nervous system activity, and decreased parasympathetic nervous system activity can also increase cardiac output. HR can vary by a factor of approximately 3—between 60 and 180 beats per minute—while stroke volume (SV) can vary between , a factor of only 1.7.

Diseases of the cardiovascular system are often associated with changes in &quot;Q&quot;, particularly the pandemic diseases hypertension and heart failure. Increased &quot;Q&quot; can be associated with cardiovascular disease that can occur during infection and sepsis. Decreased &quot;Q&quot; can be associated with cardiomyopathy and heart failure. Sometimes, in the presence of ventricular disease associated with dilatation, EDV may vary. An increase in EDV could counterbalance LV dilatation and impaired contraction. From equation (), the resulting cardiac output Q may remain constant. The ability to accurately measure &quot;Q&quot; is important in clinical medicine because it provides for improved diagnosis of abnormalities and can be used to guide appropriate management.

==Example values==
==Related measurements==

===Ejection fraction===
Ejection fraction (EF) is a parameter related to SV. EF is the fraction of blood ejected by the left ventricle (LV) during the contraction or ejection phase of the cardiac cycle or systole. Prior to the start of systole, during the filling phase (diastole), the LV is filled with blood to the capacity known as end diastolic volume (EDV). During systole, the LV contracts and ejects blood until it reaches its minimum capacity known as end systolic volume (ESV). It does not completely empty. The following equations help translate the effect of EF and EDV on cardiac output Q, via SV.
===Cardiac input===
Cardiac input (CI) is the inverse operation of cardiac output. As cardiac output implies the volumetric expression of ejection fraction, cardiac input implies the volumetric injection fraction (IF).

IF = end diastolic volume (EDV) / end systolic volume (ESV)

=== Cardiac index ===

In all resting mammals of normal mass, CO value is a linear function of body mass with a slope of 0.1 L/(min kg). Fat has about 65% of oxygen demand per mass in comparison to other lean body tissues. As a result, the calculation of normal CO value in an obese subject is more complex; a single, common &quot;normal&quot; value of SV and CO for adults cannot exist. All blood flow parameters have to be indexed. It is accepted convention to index them by the body surface area, BSA [m2], by DuBois &amp; DuBois Formula, a function of height and weight:

formula_20

The resulting indexed parameters are stroke index (SI) and cardiac index (CI). Stroke index, measured in mL/beat/m2, is defined as

formula_21

Cardiac index, measured in L/(min m2), is defined asformula_22

The CO equation () for indexed parameters then changes to the following.The normal range for these indexed blood flow parameters are between 35 and 65 mL/beat/m2 for SI and between 2.5 and 4 L/(min m2) for CI.

===Combined cardiac output===
Combined cardiac output is the sum of the outputs of the right and left sides of the heart. It is a useful measurement in fetal circulation, where cardiac outputs from both sides of the heart work partly in parallel by the foramen ovale and ductus arteriosus, which directly supply the systemic circulation.

==Historical methods==

===Fick principle===

The Fick principle, first described by Adolf Eugen Fick in 1870, assumes the rate of oxygen consumption is a function of the rate of blood flow and the rate of oxygen picked up by the red blood cells. Application of the Fick principle involves calculating the oxygen consumed over time by measuring the oxygen concentration of venous blood and arterial blood. &quot;Q&quot; is calculated from these measurements as follows:
* &quot;V&quot;O2 consumption per minute using a spirometer (with the subject re-breathing air) and a CO2 absorber
* the oxygen content of blood taken from the pulmonary artery (representing mixed venous blood)
* the oxygen content of blood from a cannula in a peripheral artery (representing arterial blood)

From these values, we know that:

:formula_23

where
* &quot;C&quot;A is the oxygen content of arterial blood, and,
* &quot;C&quot;V is the oxygen content of venous blood.
This allows us to say

:formula_24

and therefore calculate &quot;Q&quot;. (&quot;CA&quot; – &quot;CV&quot;) is also known as the arteriovenous oxygen difference.

While considered to be the most accurate method of measuring &quot;Q&quot;, the Fick method is invasive and requires time for sample analysis, and accurate oxygen consumption samples are difficult to acquire. There have been modifications to the Fick method where respiratory oxygen content is measured as part of a closed system and the consumed oxygen is calculated using an assumed oxygen consumption index, which is then used to calculate &quot;Q&quot;. Other variations use inert gases as tracers and measure the change in inspired and expired gas concentrations to calculate &quot;Q&quot; (Innocor, Innovision A/S, Denmark).

The calculation of the arterial and venous oxygen content of the blood is a straightforward process. Almost all oxygen in the blood is bound to hæmoglobin molecules in the red blood cells. Measuring the content of hæmoglobin in the blood and the percentage of saturation of hæmoglobin—the oxygen saturation of the blood—is a simple process and is readily available to physicians. Each gram of haemoglobin can carry 1.34 mL of O2; the oxygen content of the blood—either arterial or venous—can be estimated using the following formula:

:formula_25

===Pulmonary artery thermodilution (trans-right-heart thermodilution)===
The indicator method was further developed by replacing the indicator dye with heated or cooled fluid. Temperature changes rather than dye concentration are measured at sites in the circulation; this method is known as thermodilution. The pulmonary artery catheter (PAC) introduced to clinical practice in 1970, also known as the Swan-Ganz catheter, provides direct access to the right heart for thermodilution measurements. Continuous, invasive, cardiac monitoring in intensive care units has been mostly phased out. The PAC remains useful in right-heart study done in cardiac catheterisation laboratories.

The PAC is balloon tipped and is inflated, which helps &quot;sail&quot; the catheter balloon through the right ventricle to occlude a small branch of the pulmonary artery system. The balloon is then deflated. The PAC thermodilution method involves the injection of a small amount (10 mL) of cold glucose at a known temperature into the pulmonary artery and measuring the temperature a known distance away using the same catheter with temperature sensors set apart at a known distance.

The historically significant Swan-Ganz multi-lumen catheter allows reproducible calculation of cardiac output from a measured time-temperature curve, also known as the thermodilution curve. Thermistor technology enabled the observations that low CO registers temperature change slowly and high CO registers temperature change rapidly. The degree of temperature change is directly proportional to the cardiac output. In this unique method, three or four repeated measurements or passes are usually averaged to improve accuracy. Modern catheters are fitted with heating filaments that intermittently heat up and measure the thermodilution curve, providing serial &quot;Q&quot; measurements. These instruments average measurements over 2–9 minutes depending on the stability of the circulation, and thus do not provide continuous monitoring.

PAC use can be complicated by arrhythmias, infection, pulmonary artery rupture and damage to the right heart valve. Recent studies in patients with critical illnesses, sepsis, acute respiratory failure and heart failure suggest that use of the PAC does not improve patient outcomes. This clinical ineffectiveness may relate to its poor accuracy and sensitivity, which have been demonstrated by comparison with flow probes across a sixfold range of &quot;Q&quot; values. Use of PAC is in decline as clinicians move to less invasive and more accurate technologies for monitoring hæmodynamics.

<doc id="242118" wikidata="Q2596171" url="?curid=242118" title="John Henry (folklore)">
<text>John Henry is an American folk hero. An African American freedman, he is said to have worked as a &quot;steel-driving man&quot;—a man tasked with hammering a steel drill into a rock to make holes for explosives to blast the rock in constructing a railroad tunnel.

The story of John Henry is told in a classic blues folk song about his duel against a drilling machine, which exists in many versions, and has been the subject of numerous stories, plays, books, and novels.

== Legend ==
According to legend, John Henry&#x27;s prowess as a steel driver was measured in a race against a steam-powered rock drill, a race that he won only to die in victory with a hammer in hand as his heart gave out from stress. Various locations, including Big Bend Tunnel in West Virginia, Lewis Tunnel in Virginia, and Coosa Mountain Tunnel in Alabama, have been suggested as the site of the contest.

The contest involved John Henry as the hammerman working in partnership with a shaker, who would hold a chisel-like drill against mountain rock, while the hammerman struck a blow with a hammer. Then the shaker would begin rocking and rolling: wiggling and rotating the drill to optimize its bite. The steam drill machine could drill but it could not shake the chippings away, so its bit could not drill further and frequently broke down.

==History==
The historical accuracy of many of the aspects of the John Henry legend are subject to debate. According to researcher Scott Reynolds Nelson, the actual John Henry was born in 1848 in New Jersey and died of silicosis, a complication of his workplace, and not due to proper exhaustion of work.

Several locations have been put forth for the tunnel on which John Henry died.

===Big Bend Tunnel===

Sociologist Guy B. Johnson investigated the legend of John Henry in the late 1920s. He concluded that John Henry might have worked on the Chesapeake and Ohio Railway&#x27;s (C&amp;O Railway) Big Bend Tunnel but that &quot;one can make out a case either for or against&quot; it. That tunnel was built near Talcott, West Virginia, from 1870 to 1872 (according to Johnson&#x27;s dating), and named for the big bend in the Greenbrier River nearby.

Some versions of the song refer to the location of John Henry&#x27;s death as &quot;The Big Bend Tunnel on the C. &amp; O.&quot; In 1927, Johnson visited the area and found one man who said he had seen it.

When Johnson contacted Chief Engineer C. W. Johns of the C&amp;O Railroad regarding Big Bend Tunnel, Johns replied that &quot;no steam drills were ever used in this tunnel.&quot; When asked about documentation from the period, Johns replied that &quot;all such papers have been destroyed by fire.&quot;

Talcott holds a yearly festival named for Henry, and a statue and memorial plaque have been placed in John Henry Historical Park at the eastern end of the tunnel.

===Lewis Tunnel===

In the 2006 book &quot;Steel Drivin&#x27; Man: John Henry, the Untold Story of an American Legend&quot;, historian Scott Reynolds Nelson detailed his discovering documentation of a 19-year-old African-American man alternately referred to as John Henry, John W. Henry, or John William Henry in previously unexplored prison records of the Virginia Penitentiary. At the time, penitentiary inmates were hired out as laborers to various contractors, and this John Henry was notated as having headed the first group of prisoners to be assigned tunnel work. Nelson also discovered the C&amp;O&#x27;s tunneling records, which the company believed had been destroyed by fire. Henry, like many African Americans, might have come to Virginia to work on the clean-up of the battlefields after the American Civil War. Arrested and tried for burglary, John Henry was in the first group of convicts released by the warden to work as leased labor on the C&amp;O Railway.

According to Nelson, objectionable conditions at the Virginia prison led the warden to believe that the prisoners, many of whom had been arrested on trivial charges, would be better clothed and fed if they were released as laborers to private contractors (he subsequently changed his mind about this and became an opponent of the convict labor system). In the C&amp;O&#x27;s tunneling records, Nelson found no evidence of a steam drill used in Big Bend Tunnel.

The records Nelson found indicate that the contest took place away at the Lewis Tunnel, between Talcott and Millboro, Virginia, where prisoners did indeed work beside steam drills night and day. Nelson also argues that the verses of the ballad about John Henry being buried near &quot;the white house,&quot; &quot;in the sand,&quot; somewhere that locomotives roar, mean that Henry&#x27;s body was buried in a ditch behind the so-called white house of the Virginia State Penitentiary, which photos from that time indicate was painted white, and where numerous unmarked graves have been found.

Prison records for John William Henry stopped in 1873, suggesting that he was kept on the record books until it was clear that he was not coming back and had died. Nelson stresses that John Henry would have been representative of the many hundreds of convict laborers who were killed in unknown circumstances tunneling through the mountains or who died shortly afterwards of silicosis from dust created by the drills and blasting.

==In popular culture==

The tale of John Henry has been used as a symbol in many cultural movements, including labor movements and the Civil Rights Movement. Philosopher Jeanette Bickell said of the John Henry legend:

===Film===
* In 1995, John Henry was portrayed in the movie &quot;Tall Tale&quot; by Roger Aaron Brown. A former slave, John Henry appears to a runaway farmer&#x27;s son named Daniel to both protect him from ruffians (alongside fellow folk hero figures Daniel&#x27;s father told his son about, Pecos Bill and Paul Bunyan) and impart life lesson wisdom to him.
* In 2018, a film centered around characters from classic American folklore titled &quot;John Henry and the Statesmen&quot; was announced to be in development. Intended to be the start of a new film franchise, it includes Dwayne Johnson cast to portray John Henry. Jake Kasdan will serve as director, based on the original story by Tom Wheeler and Hiram Garcia. Johnson, Garcia, Kasdan, and Beau Flynn will serve as producers. The project will be a joint-venture production between Seven Bucks Productions, Netflix Original Films, and Flynn Picture Company; and distributed by Netflix as a streaming exclusive movie. In November 2021, producer Hiram Garcia stated that development on the project continues, while confirming that the most recent draft of the script had been completed while it requires additional work.
* In 2020, Terry Crews played a modern-day adaptation of the character in &quot;John Henry&quot;. The plot centers around a former gang member who takes in two young teens who are on the run from the leader of his past. The film was released by Saban Films.

====Animation====
* In 1946, animator George Pal adapted the tale of John Henry into a short film titled &quot;John Henry and the Inky-Poo&quot; as part of his theatrical stop-motion &quot;Puppetoons&quot; series. The short is considered a milestone in American cinema as one of the first films to have a positive view of African-American folklore.
* In 1974, Nick Bosustow and David Adams co-produced an 11-minute animated short, &quot;The Legend of John Henry&quot;, for Paramount Pictures.
* The character appears in a Walt Disney Feature Animation short film, &quot;John Henry&quot; (2000). Directed by Mark Henn, plans for theatrical releases in 2000 and 2001 fell through after the short had a limited Academy Award qualifying run in Los Angeles; a shorter version was released as the only new entry in the direct-to-video release &quot;Disney&#x27;s American Legends&quot; (2001). It was eventually released in its original format as an interstitial on the Disney Channel, and later as part of the home video compilation &quot;Walt Disney Animation Studios Short Films Collection&quot; in 2015.

===Television===

* &quot;The Grim Adventures of Billy &amp; Mandy&quot; Season 6 episode &quot;Short Tall Tales&quot; shows a parody of John Henry&#x27;s tale with Irwin in the role.

* John Henry appears in a segment of the short-lived &quot;Bill &amp; Ted&#x27;s Excellent Adventures&quot; TV series. In an episode titled &quot;Pocket Watch Full of Miracles&quot;, which aired in November 1990, John Henry is portrayed as having the mannerisms of Muhammad Ali. He challenges and beats a steam-powered hammer driven by his boss. His prize is an antique pocket watch owned by Queen Victoria. The watch is given to the titular Bill and Ted, only to be immediately destroyed by a runaway train.
* Danny Glover played the character in the series, &quot;Shelley Duvall&#x27;s Tall Tales &amp; Legends&quot; from 1985 to 1987. Shelley Duvall served as the series&#x27; creator, presenter, narrator, and executive producer. The show aired on Showtime Network as well as Disney Channel, and received a Primetime Emmy Award.

* On the Adult Swim series, &quot;Saul of the Mole Men&quot;, John Henry (voiced by Tommy &quot;Tiny&quot; Lister) has been living at the centre of the Earth since his victory over the steam drill, having become a cyborg at sometime in the intervening centuries. He befriends and later sacrifices himself to save protagonist Saul Malone.
* In the season 5, episode 15, &quot;Mr. Monk and the Really, Really Dead Guy&quot; of &quot;Monk&quot;, Dr. Kroger sings a couple of stanzas to Monk during Monk&#x27;s therapy session to remind him that Monk never needed technology before as he became a phenomenal detective.

===Radio===
&quot;Destination Freedom&quot;, a 1950s American old time radio series written by Richard Durham, featured John Henry in a July 1949 episode.

===Music===
The story of John Henry is traditionally told through two types of songs: ballads, commonly called &quot;The Ballad of John Henry&quot;, and &quot;hammer songs&quot; (a type of work song), each with wide-ranging and varying lyrics. Some songs, and some early folk historian research, conflate the songs about John Henry with those of John Hardy, a West Virginian outlaw. Ballads about John Henry&#x27;s life typically contain four major components: a premonition by John Henry as a child that steel-driving would lead to his death, the lead-up to and the results of the legendary race against the steam hammer, Henry&#x27;s death and burial, and the reaction of his wife.

The well-known narrative ballad of &quot;John Henry&quot; is usually sung in an upbeat tempo. Hammer songs associated with the &quot;John Henry&quot; ballad, however, are not. Sung more slowly and deliberately, often with a pulsating beat suggestive of swinging the hammer, these songs usually contain the lines &quot;This old hammer killed John Henry / but it won&#x27;t kill me.&quot; Nelson explains that:

... workers managed their labor by setting a &quot;stint,&quot; or pace, for it. Men who violated the stint were shunned ... Here was a song that told you what happened to men who worked too fast: they died ugly deaths; their entrails fell on the ground. You sang the song slowly, you worked slowly, you guarded your life, or you died.

There is some controversy among scholars over which came first, the ballad or the hammer songs. Some scholars have suggested that the &quot;John Henry&quot; ballad grew out of the hammer songs, while others believe that the two were always entirely separate.

Songs featuring the story of John Henry have been recorded by many musical artists and bands of different ethnic backgrounds. These include:
* The Williamson Brothers &amp; Curry
:&quot;Gonna Die With My Hammer in My Hand&quot;, recorded in 1927 and compiled in the &quot;Anthology of American Folk Music&quot; (1952)

The story also inspired the Aaron Copland&#x27;s orchestral composition &quot;John Henry&quot; (1940, revised 1952), the 1994 chamber music piece &quot;Come Down Heavy&quot; by Evan Chambers and the 2009 chamber music piece &quot;Steel Hammer&quot; by the composer Julia Wolfe.
They Might Be Giants named their fifth studio album after John Henry as an allusion to their usage of a full band on this album rather than the drum machine that they had employed previously.

The American cowpunk band Nine Pound Hammer is named after the traditional description of the hammer John Henry wielded.

Bengalee singer-songwriter and musician Hemanga Biswas (1912–1987), considered as the Father of the Indian People&#x27;s Theater Association Movement in Assam inspired by &#x27;John Henry&#x27;, the American ballad translated the song in Bengali as well as the Assamese language and also composed its music for which he was well recognized among the masses. Bangladeshi mass singer Fakir Alamgir later covered Biswas&#x27; version of the song.

===Literature===
* Henry is the subject of the 1931 Roark Bradford novel &quot;John Henry&quot;, illustrated by noted woodcut artist J. J. Lankes. The novel was adapted into a stage musical in 1940, starring Paul Robeson in the title role. According to Steven Carl Tracy, Bradford&#x27;s works were influential in broadly popularizing the John Henry legend beyond railroad and mining communities and outside of African American oral histories.
* In a 1933 article published in &quot;The Journal of Negro Education&quot;, Bradford&#x27;s John Henry was criticized for &quot;making over a folk-hero into a clown.&quot; A 1948 obituary for Bradford described &quot;John Henry&quot; as &quot;a better piece of native folklore than Paul Bunyan.&quot;

<text>John Henry (March 9, 1975 – October 8, 2007) was an American champion Thoroughbred racehorse. He was sired by Ole Bob Bowers (by Prince Blessed) out of Once Double (by Double Jay). John Henry had 39 wins with $6,591,860 in earnings, was twice voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year, and was listed as #23 on &quot;Blood Horse&quot; magazine&#x27;s Top 100 U.S. Racehorses of the 20th Century.

==Background==
The horse was named after the folk hero John Henry. As a colt, John Henry had a habit of tearing steel water and feed buckets off stall walls and stomping them flat. This reminded his owners of the legendary John Henry, who was known as a &quot;steel-drivin&#x27; man&quot;. He was gelded both for his temperament as well as his lack of good breeding, which meant that he would have been unlikely to be in much demand as a breeding stallion. John Henry was a Golden Chance Farm foal. His sire, Ole Bob Bowers, was sired by Prince Blessed and his dam, Once Double, was sired by Double Jay, a graded stakes race winner.

John Henry was back at the knee (a flaw in conformation that generally makes a long racing career unlikely), undersized, and plainly bred. He was sold as a yearling for $1,100 at the Keeneland January Mixed sale to John Callaway who is credited with giving John Henry his name.

==Racing record==
John Henry had a series of trainers, and earned money in minor stakes, allowance races, and mid-level claiming races. In 1978, New York City businessman Sam Rubin and his wife Dorothy paid $25,000 sight-unseen for the three-year-old John Henry. Racing under the Rubins&#x27; Dotsam Stable banner, he was first conditioned by trainer Robert Donato. Under him, John Henry won 6 of 19 starts and $120,000, starting the year as a cheap claimer and getting his first graded stakes win in the Round Table Handicap at Arlington Park.

In 1979, John Henry was given to a new trainer, Lefty Nickerson. Under him, John Henry won 4 of 11 races in 1979. When the grass season was over in New York, Rubin decided to send the horse to California under trainer Ron McAnally. Under McAnally, John Henry won six stakes races in a row.

Racing through the age of nine, John Henry won the 1981 Santa Anita Handicap and repeated in 1982 after Perrault was disqualified. He is one of only three horses with back-to-back victories in the race&#x27;s 72-year history. He also won the Arlington Million Stakes twice and won three renewals of both the Hollywood Invitational Handicap and the Oak Tree Invitational Stakes, two Grade I turf stakes in Southern California. He won one of America&#x27;s most important races for older horses, the 1981 Jockey Club Gold Cup at Belmont Park, at on the dirt. This victory clinched his first Horse of the Year title, and as noted on the CBS telecast of that race (October 10, 1981, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DHexkk8Xhl0), becoming the sport&#x27;s all-time leading money earner.

A bronze statue called &quot;Against All Odds&quot;, created by Edwin Bogucki, stands on a balcony overlooking the paddock at Arlington Park. It commemorates one of John Henry&#x27;s most famous finishes; in 1981, at the inaugural Arlington Million, John Henry won over 5-year-old The Bart in a photo finish.

On December 11, 1983, John Henry became the first racehorse to surpass $4 million in career earnings when he won the Hollywood Turf Cup Stakes with jockey Chris McCarron at Hollywood Park Racetrack.

John Henry&#x27;s last race was the 1984 Ballantine Scotch Classic at the Meadowlands. As he took the lead in the stretch, Meadowlands track announcer Dave Johnson exclaimed, &quot;And down the stretch they come! The old man, John Henry, takes command!&quot; He pulled away to his 39th career victory and his second Horse of the Year title. The final time of 2:13 equaled the track record for .

John Henry was a late entry into the Inaugural Breeders Cup in 1984 but a strained ligament in his left foreleg caused him to be withdrawn from the race and retired.

John Henry&#x27;s final race record stood at 83 starts, 39 wins, 15 seconds, and 9 thirds with $6,591,860 in earnings. He was twice voted the Eclipse Award for Horse of the Year in 1981 and 1984; 1981 being the first unanimous election of the winner. That feat was not repeated until 2015 when Triple Crown winner American Pharoah was also elected unanimously.

==Retirement==

After retirement, Rubin sent John Henry to the Hall of Champions at Kentucky Horse Park in Lexington. He joined three time Horse of the Year Forego, as well as Standardbred Rambling Willie, and Throroughbreds Rossi Gold and A Letter To Harry. The Hall Of Champions would in time become home to retired Thoroughbred champions Cigar, Da Hoss and Funny Cide.

Regular rider Chris McCarron often described John Henry as very smart, commenting: &quot;I&#x27;m just along for the ride.&quot; John Henry, in the view of many followers of thoroughbred racing, was one of the best come-from-behind horses (or &quot;closers&quot;) in recent history. In &quot;The Blood-Horse&quot; ranking of the top 100 U.S. thoroughbred champions of the 20th Century, he was ranked #23. John Henry was inducted into the National Museum of Racing and Hall of Fame in Saratoga Springs, New York in 1990.

==Death==
John Henry was euthanized at 7:05 pm EDT (2305 UTC) on October 8, 2007, at the age of 32. He developed serious kidney problems and stopped responding to veterinary treatment, so the decision was made to put him down. He was buried on the night of his death in front of the Hall of Champions at a spot in front of his paddock. A memorial service was held at the park on October 19.

<text>John Henry (November 1750December 16, 1798) was the eighth Governor of Maryland and member of the United States Senate. He was born at his family&#x27;s estate (&quot;Weston&quot;), located near Vienna in Dorchester County.

==Early life==
John Henry was born in November 1750. He was the son of Dorothy Rider and Col. John Henry and the grandson of Rev. John Henry, a Presbyterian minister who came to America in the early 1700s. His grandmother, Mary King, has been claimed without proof to be the daughter of an Irish baronet. His mother was a descendant of one of the early settlers of Dorchester County.

Henry attended West Nottingham Academy in Cecil County, Maryland and graduated from the College of New Jersey (later Princeton University) in 1769; he then studied law at the Middle Temple (one of the Inns of Court where English barristers are trained) in London. He returned to the United States in 1775 and practiced law in Dorchester County.

==Career==
He was a member of the Episcopal Church and the United States Democratic-Republican Party. Originally, he was a member of the Federalist Party.

Henry served as a member of Maryland House of Delegates from 1777 to 1780 and a member of the Maryland State Senate from 1780 to 1790. During that time he was chosen as a delegate to the Continental Congress from Maryland from 1778 to 1780 and from 1785 to 1786; during his service, he was a member of the committee that prepared the ordinance for the government of the Northwest Territory. He was elected as an inaugural Senator from Maryland, serving 1789 as a Federalist till his resignation on December 10, 1797, to assume the Governorship.

In the 1796 election, Henry received two electoral votes for President of the United States. He served as Governor of Maryland from 1797 to 1798. In this capacity, he exchanged letters with then Vice-President, Thomas Jefferson.

==Personal life==
On March 6, 1787, Henry was married to Margaret Campbell (1769–1789), the daughter of John and Elizabeth (née Goldsborough) Campbell of Caroline County. Her sister married Philip Francis and was the grandmother of Gov. Philip Francis Thomas. Margaret died, aged 20, shortly after the birth of their second son. Their two sons were:

* John Campbell Henry (1787–1857), who married Mary Nevett Steele (1789–1873), the daughter of James Steele (1760–1816) and a sister of U.S. Rep. John Nevett Steele and Isaac Nevett Steele, a Baltimore lawyer.
* Francis Jenkins Henry (b. 1789), who died unmarried soon after becoming of age.

He died in Dorchester County, at &quot;Weston&quot;, the same estate where he had been born. Henry is buried in Christ Episcopal Church Cemetery in Cambridge.

===Descendants===
Henry was a grandfather to John and Mary&#x27;s eight children, John Francis Henry (1813–1847), Dr. James Winfield Henry (1815–1889), Francis Jenkins Henry (1816–1902), Catherine Henry Lloyd (1818–1886), Daniel Maynadier Henry (1823–1899), Isabella Elizabeth Henry Steele (1825–1912), Mary Henry Goldsborough (1828–1911), Rider Henry (1828–1900), and Charlotte Augusta Page Henry Goldsborough (1834–1908).

<doc id="242123" wikidata="Q864150" url="?curid=242123" title="The Diary of a Nobody">
<text>The Diary of a Nobody is an 1892 English comic novel written by the brothers George and Weedon Grossmith, with illustrations by the latter. It originated as an intermittent serial in &quot;Punch&quot; magazine in 1888–89 and first appeared in book form, with extended text and added illustrations, in 1892. The &quot;Diary&quot; records the daily events in the lives of a London clerk, Charles Pooter, his wife Carrie, his son William Lupin, and numerous friends and acquaintances over a period of 15 months.

Before their collaboration on the &quot;Diary&quot;, the brothers each pursued successful careers on the stage. George originated nine of the principal comedian roles in Gilbert and Sullivan operas over 12 years from 1877 to 1889. He also established a national reputation as a piano sketch entertainer and wrote a large number of songs and comic pieces. Before embarking on his stage career, Weedon had worked as an artist and illustrator. The &quot;Diary&quot; was the brothers&#x27; only mature collaboration. Most of its humour derives from Charles Pooter&#x27;s unconscious and unwarranted sense of his own importance, and the frequency with which this delusion is punctured by gaffes and minor social humiliations. In an era of rising expectations within the lower-middle classes, the daily routines and modest ambitions described in the &quot;Diary&quot; were instantly recognised by its contemporary readers, and provided later generations with a glimpse of the past that it became fashionable to imitate.

Although its initial public reception was muted, the &quot;Diary&quot; came to be recognised by critics as a classic work of humour, and it has never been out of print. It helped to establish a genre of humorous popular fiction based on lower or lower-middle class aspirations, and was the forerunner of numerous fictitious diary novels in the later 20th century. The &quot;Diary&quot; has been the subject of several stage and screen adaptations, including Ken Russell&#x27;s &quot;silent film&quot; treatment of 1964, a four-part TV film scripted by Andrew Davies in 2007, and a widely praised stage version in 2011, in which an all-male cast of three played all the parts.

==Authorship and origin==

&quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; was the work of George Grossmith and his brother Weedon Grossmith, the sons of a court reporter and part-time stage entertainer, also named George. The younger George followed his father, first as a reporter and later on the stage; the 7-years-younger Weedon studied at the West London School of Art and had some success as a portrait painter before becoming a comic actor. The brothers were fascinated with the stage at an early age. In 1864, at 17 and 10, they hosted a complex programme of musical and dramatic entertainment in their parents&#x27; garden at Haverstock Hill. This included a 20-minute burlesque version of &quot;Hamlet&quot;, in which George played the title role; Weedon was Ophelia.

By 1877 the younger George Grossmith had established himself as a comic piano sketch entertainer in provincial institutes and literary societies. In that year he was seen by Arthur Sullivan and, separately, by W. S. Gilbert, in performances of their one-act comic opera &quot;Trial by Jury&quot;. Impressed, they engaged him to play the comic lead in their new, full-length work, &quot;The Sorcerer&quot;. Thereafter, Grossmith created the leading comic role in each of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s long-running comic operas until &quot;The Yeomen of the Guard&quot;, which closed in 1889. While appearing in the operas, Grossmith continued his piano entertainment career at private parties and matinees, writing and composing his own material. He became the most successful comic entertainer of his day, writing numerous operettas, around 100 piano sketches, some 600 songs and short piano pieces, and three books. For &quot;Punch&quot; magazine in 1884 he provided a series of short sketches based on his experiences as a court reporter at Bow Street Magistrates&#x27; Court. In 1889, Grossmith ended his connection with Gilbert and Sullivan to pursue his piano sketch career full-time and continued to perform until 1908. He died in 1912.

As an artist Weedon Grossmith exhibited at the Royal Academy and at the Grosvenor Gallery. He also contributed illustrations to &quot;Punch&quot; and the prestigious &quot;Art Journal&quot;. He was nevertheless dissatisfied with his financial prospects as an artist, and by 1885 was pursuing an alternative career as an actor. He continued his career on the stage with considerable success until 1918, making his name playing roles he described as &quot;cowards, cads and snobs&quot;, and as browbeaten small men under the thumb of authority. He wrote several plays, of which &quot;The Night of the Party&quot; (1901) was his most successful, and from 1894 was engaged in the management of two West End theatres. He died in 1919. The literary scholar Peter Morton, who published an annotated edition of the &quot;Diary&quot; in 2009, suggests that many of the events depicted in it were drawn from the brothers&#x27; own home experiences, and that Weedon, &quot;something of a scapegrace compared with his perfectionist brother&quot;, was the model for Lupin.

==Synopsis==

The diary begins on 3 April of an unstated year, and runs for approximately 15 months. In a short prologue, readers are informed that Charles Pooter and his wife Caroline (Carrie) have just moved to a new home at &quot;The Laurels&quot;, Brickfield Terrace, Holloway. Mr Pooter works as a clerk in the City firm of Perkupp&#x27;s. The couple&#x27;s 20-year-old son William works as a bank clerk in Oldham. The first entries describe the Pooters&#x27; daily lives and introduce their particular friends, such as their neighbour Gowing, the enthusiastic bicyclist Cummings, and the Jameses from Sutton. From the beginning a pattern is set whereby the small vexations of the Pooters&#x27; daily lives are recounted, many of them arising from Pooter&#x27;s unconscious self-importance and pomposity. Trouble with servants, tradesmen, and office juniors occur regularly, along with minor social embarrassments and humiliations.

The rare formal social events in the Pooters&#x27; lives are particular magnets for misfortune. They receive an invitation from the Lord Mayor of London to attend a ball at the Mansion House for &quot;Representatives of Trade and Commerce&quot;. After days of keen anticipation they are dismayed, when they arrive, to find that the gathering is undistinguished. Pooter is snobbishly upset to be greeted familiarly by his local ironmonger, even more so when this tradesman appears to be on social terms with some of the more important guests. Pooter overindulges in champagne and humiliates Carrie by collapsing on the dance floor.

In the summer their son arrives from Oldham and informs his parents that he wishes henceforth to be called by his middle name, &quot;Lupin&quot;. He has been dismissed from his bank post for idleness; although dismayed, Pooter sees this as a chance to get his son into Perkupp&#x27;s. Lupin joins the couple for their annual holiday week in Broadstairs, but relationships are strained by Lupin&#x27;s &quot;fast&quot; habits. On their return, Pooter&#x27;s efforts to find Lupin a job at first prove fruitless. The boy is interested in amateur dramatics and joins an organisation called the &quot;Holloway Comedians&quot;. With the help of Pooter&#x27;s employer Mr. Perkupp, Lupin finally secures a clerical position with a firm of stockbrokers in November. He then shocks his parents by announcing his engagement.

Lupin&#x27;s fiancée, Daisy Mutlar, is the sister of one of his theatrical friends and is, he says, &quot;the nicest, prettiest, and most accomplished girl he ever met&quot;. Pooter is disappointed when he meets her: &quot;She is a big young woman... at least eight years older than Lupin. I did not even think her good-looking&quot;. Nevertheless, in her honour the Pooters give a large dinner-party, to which Pooter invites Mr Perkupp. The party becomes boisterous; Mr Perkupp arrives at a particularly raucous moment, and decides not to stay. Pooter believes the party has failed, and is despondent, although Carrie deems it a great success. However, within a few days, Lupin informs them that the engagement is off.

In the following weeks Lupin often brings the Holloway troupe back to &quot;The Laurels&quot;. These occasions are graced with the unexplained presence of a complete stranger, Mr Padge, who regularly occupies the best chair as if by right. Lupin opts out of the family&#x27;s Christmas celebrations, and then announces, to everyone&#x27;s astonishment, that the engagement to Daisy is back on. Christmas passes happily enough, despite a supper party which degenerates into a food fight instigated by Daisy.

In the New Year, Pooter is promoted to senior clerk at Perkupp&#x27;s, and his salary raised by £100 a year, but his achievement is overshadowed by Lupin&#x27;s announcement that he has just profited by £200 through a timely shares speculation. Lupin persuades his father, and Gowing and Cummings, to invest small sums in Parachikka Chlorates, the source of his gains. The Pooters meet a new friend of Lupin&#x27;s, Mr Murray Posh, who Pooter thinks is somewhat over-familiar with Daisy and might, he warns Lupin, be a rival for her hand. Lupin pooh-poohs this notion. Later, Pooter learns that he and his friends have lost their investment; indeed, Lupin&#x27;s stockbroking firm has collapsed entirely and its principal has fled. Lupin is thus unemployed; worse, that same day the engagement of Daisy Mutlar to Murray Posh is announced. Lupin&#x27;s only consolation, he tells his father, is that he persuaded Posh to invest £600 in Parachikka Chlorates. However, in Pooter&#x27;s eyes the situation is redeemed when Mr Perkupp offers Lupin a clerkship.

April begins with another social disaster. The Pooters receive an invitation to a ball given by the East Acton Rifle Brigade, which they imagine will be a glittering occasion. It turns out to be shabby and down-at-heel; furthermore, having liberally supplied fellow-guests—among them Mr Padge—with food and drink which he thinks is free, Pooter is presented at the end with a large bill that he can barely afford to pay. Other social events also turn sour: a lunch party with Mr Finsworth, the father of an old friend, is marred by some unfortunate comments by Pooter on the Finsworth family portraits. On another occasion they meet a loud and over-opinionated American, Mr Hardfur Huttle, who, Pooter realises, is like a mature version of Lupin.

Lupin is sacked from Perkupp&#x27;s for persuading their top client, Mr Crowbillon, to take his business to another firm. Pooter is mortified, but the new firm rewards Lupin with a £25 commission and a job at £200 a year. Lupin resumes his friendship with Murray Posh and Daisy, who is now Mrs Posh. Lupin moves to lodgings in Bayswater, where Pooter and Carrie are invited to dine and where they meet Murray&#x27;s sister, known as &quot;Lillie Girl&quot;, a woman of around 30. Pooter learns that Murray Posh has settled £10,000 on both Daisy and &quot;Lillie Girl&quot;.

Pooter is summoned to meet Hardfur Huttle, who offers Perkupp&#x27;s a new client to replace Mr Crowbillon. Perkupp is so grateful to Pooter for this introduction that he buys up the freehold of &quot;The Laurels&quot; and presents the deeds to Pooter. As the couple celebrate, a letter arrives from Lupin announcing his engagement to &quot;Lillie Girl&quot;: &quot;We shall be married in August, and among our guests we hope to see your old friends Gowing and Cummings&quot;.

==Publication and reception history==
The &quot;Diary&quot; made its initial appearance as an intermittent serial in the satirical weekly magazine &quot;Punch&quot;. The first of the 26 instalments was announced in the issue of 26 May 1888 with a brief editorial note: &quot;As everybody who is anybody is publishing Reminiscences, Diaries, Notes, Autobiographies, and Recollections, we are sincerely grateful to &#x27;A Nobody&#x27; for permitting us to add to the historic collection&quot;. The diary entry dates are several weeks behind the dates on which they appear in &quot;Punch&quot;.
The &quot;Punch&quot; serialisation ended in May 1889 with the diary entry for 21 March, which records the Pooters and their friends celebrating the minor triumph of Lupin&#x27;s appointment as a clerk at Perkupp&#x27;s. That was the intended end of the diary; however, when the writers were preparing the manuscript for publication as a book, they added a further four months&#x27; entries to the text, and included 26 illustrations by Weedon Grossmith.

In June 1892 J.W. Arrowsmith Ltd published the &quot;Diary&quot; in book form, although its critical and popular success was not evident until the third edition appeared in October 1910. After the First World War the book&#x27;s popularity continued to grow; regular reprintings and new editions ensured that thereafter the book was never out of print. Audiobook versions have been available since 1982. The writer Robert McCrum, in a personal list of &quot;The 100 greatest novels of all time&quot; published in &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper, listed the &quot;Diary&quot; at number 35.

===Early indifference===

The &quot;Punch&quot; serialisation attracted little critical comment; &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;″s literary critic thought the series &quot;may have escaped unnoticed amid better jokes&quot;. When the &quot;Diary&quot; was published as a book, &quot;Punch&quot; heralded it in its issue of 23 July 1892 as &quot;very funny&quot;, adding: &quot;not without a touch of pathos&quot;. However, apart from a warmly approving report in &quot;The Saturday Review&quot;, the book&#x27;s initial critical reception was lukewarm. The &quot;Review&quot;″s critic thought the book &quot;admirable, and in some of its touches [it] goes close to genius&quot;, with a natural and irresistible appeal: &quot;The &quot;Diary&quot; has amused us from cover to cover&quot;. This contrasted with the negative judgement of &quot;The Athenaeum&quot;, which opined that &quot;the book has no merit to compensate for its hopeless vulgarity, not even that of being amusing&quot;. It questioned the tastefulness of jokes aimed almost exclusively at the poverty of underpaid city clerks, and concluded: &quot;Besides, it is all so dull&quot;. &quot;The Speaker&quot;″s critic thought the book &quot;a study in vulgarity&quot;, while &quot;The New York Times&quot;, reviewing the first American edition, found the work largely incomprehensible: &quot;There is that kind of quiet, commonplace, everyday joking in it which we are to suppose is highly satisfactory to our cousins across the water ... Our way of manufacturing fun is different&quot;. Although details of sales figures are not given, Arrowsmiths later acknowledged that the early editions of the book did not have a wide public impact.

===Growing reputation===

By 1910 the &quot;Diary&quot; was beginning to achieve a reputation in London&#x27;s literary and political circles. In his essay &quot;On People in Books&quot;, published earlier that year, the writer and humourist Hilaire Belloc hailed the &quot;Diary&quot; as &quot;one of the half-dozen immortal achievements of our time ... a glory for us all&quot;. Among others who recorded their appreciation of the work were Lord Rosebery, the former prime minister, who told Arrowsmiths that he thought he had &quot;purchased and given away more copies than any living man ... I regard any bedroom I occupy as unfurnished without a copy of it&quot;. Another essayist-cum-politician who added his tribute was Augustine Birrell, who in 1910 occupied the cabinet post of Chief Secretary for Ireland. Birrell wrote that he ranked Charles Pooter alongside Don Quixote as a comic literary figure, and added a note of personal pride that one of the characters in the book—&quot;an illiterate charwoman, it is true&quot;—carried his name. Arrowsmiths printed these appreciations as prefaces in the 1910 and subsequent issues. The 1910 edition proved immediately popular with the reading public, and was followed by numerous reprintings. In its review of this edition &quot;The Bookman&quot; critic wrote of Charles Pooter: &quot;You laugh at him—at his small absurdities, his droll mishaps, his well-meaning fussiness; but he wins upon you and obtains your affection, and even your admiration, he is so transparently honest, so delightfully and ridiculously human&quot;.

In its review of the book&#x27;s fourth edition, published in 1919, &quot;The Bookman&quot; observed that the book was now a firm favourite with the public. &quot;It has had many imitators ... but not one of them has rivalled the original, and they have all faded away&quot;. The reviewer recommended the book&#x27;s &quot;quaint drollery, its whimsical satire and delightfully quiet irony&quot;. In Canada, &quot;Queen&#x27;s Quarterly&quot; magazine&#x27;s sympathetic reception of the book contrasted with that of &quot;The New York Times&quot; nearly 30 years previously. It praises the understated but lovable self-portrait of Pooter, and adds that &quot;It is not till the second or third reading—and you are bound to reread it—that the really consummate art of this artless book becomes apparent&quot;. The literary critic D. B. Wyndham Lewis summarised the Pooters as &quot;warm, living, breathing, futile, half-baked, incredibly alive and endearing boneheads&quot;.

===Acclaim===

The novelist Evelyn Waugh had been familiar with the &quot;Diary&quot; since his childhood. It was a great favourite of his parents—Arthur Waugh used to read passages aloud to his family, and Evelyn&#x27;s biographer Selina Hastings has drawn attention to the distinctly Pooterish elements in the Waugh household. Evelyn Waugh was initially contemptuous of the book, but grew to admire it, to the extent of writing in his 1930 essay &quot;One Way to Immortality&quot; that it was &quot;the funniest book in the world&quot;. He added: &quot;Nobody wants to read other people&#x27;s reflections on life and religion and politics, but the routine of their day, properly recorded, is always interesting, and will become more so as conditions change with the years&quot;. Morton posits that several of the leading characters in Waugh&#x27;s early novels, though socially far removed from the Pooters, share the bafflement of Charles and Carrie with the problems of a changing world. In his 1945 novel &quot;Brideshead Revisited&quot;, Waugh has Lady Marchmain comforting her family by reading aloud from the &quot;Diary&quot; &quot;with her beautiful voice and great humour of expression&quot;. Morton suggests that one of the work&#x27;s attractions to Waugh was his personal identification with Lupin, and the way in which the disapproved son (as Waugh saw himself) repeatedly manages to turn adverse circumstances to his ultimate advantage.

At about the time that Waugh was discovering his affection for the &quot;Diary&quot; another writer, J. B. Priestley, was extolling it as an exemplar of English humour; Jerome K. Jerome, Priestley asserted, never wrote anything as good: &quot;[P]oor Mr Pooter, with his simplicity, his timidity, his goodness of heart, is not simply a figure of fun but one of those innocent, lovable fools who are dear to the heart&quot;. In a 1943 essay, George Orwell considered the book an accurate account of English life in the 1880s. In describing Pooter he revived the Don Quixote analogy but saw this English equivalent as a sentimentalised version of the original, one who &quot;constantly suffers disasters brought upon him by his own folly&quot;. In the years after the Second World War the book&#x27;s stock remained high; Osbert Lancaster deemed it &quot;a great work of art&quot;, and similar enthusiasm was expressed by a new generation of writers and social historians. Gillian Tindall, writing in 1970, thought the &quot;Diary&quot; &quot;the best comic novel in the language&quot;, and lauded Pooter as &quot;the presiding shade&quot; of his era. This accolade was echoed a further generation on by A. N. Wilson, who wrote in his study of the Victorian era: &quot;Who is to say that Oscar Wilde and Aubrey Beardsley are more typical of the [1890s] than the lower-middle class Charles and Carrie Pooter?&quot; Wilson also observed the extent to which the Pooters had become recognised as &quot;arbiters of the greatest good taste&quot;, as the late 20th-century English middle classes sought to acquire or preserve authentic Victorian features in their carefully crafted &quot;period&quot; homes. A &quot;Spectator&quot; article of 2008 remarks on how such houses as &quot;The Laurels&quot;, the humble habitats of 1890s City clerks, had by the 21st century become desirable £1 million-plus homes in what it terms &quot;banker land&quot;.

==Literary and cultural influence==

Peter Bailey, in his study &quot;White Collars, Gray Lives&quot; (1999), traces the beginnings of literary interest in the lower-middle classes to the &quot;disquieting irruption of a new breed of petty bourgeois shop and office workers&quot; that faced Victorian writers in the last quarter of the 19th century. The Grossmiths&#x27; &quot;Diary&quot; was a typical satire of its time; it probed the lower-middle class lives of the Pooters and poked fun at their pretensions and petty concerns. Tony Joseph calls the &quot;Diary&quot; &quot;a sharp analysis of social insecurity&quot;. Although many writers had themselves come from humble backgrounds, they often sought to disguise their origins through scorn: &quot;putting the boot in on the lower middle classes&quot;, says Bailey, &quot;has long been the intellectual&#x27;s blood sport&quot;. However, the quarter-century following the publication of &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot; saw a tendency to mix mockery with sympathy, even approval. In the works of writers such as George Gissing, H. G. Wells, Arnold Bennett and E. M. Forster, characters emerged who, despite the recognisably Pooterish aspects of their lives, were by no means entirely absurd. Bennett and Wells could poke fun at figures such as &quot;Denry Machin&quot;, &quot;Mr Polly&quot; or &quot;Mr Lewisham&quot;, while at the same time celebrating their fortitude, energy and determination to look for better things. In cases such as these, writes Bailey, &quot;disdain could change to admiration and national self-identification, as the Little Man ... was transposed into Everyman, a model of cheerful resilience in times of crisis.&quot;

During the past century, the fictitious diary has developed as an accepted means of comedic expression; the original has, says Morton, &quot;been fertile ground which has germinated many seeds&quot;. An early example is Anita Loos&#x27;s novel of 1925: &quot;Gentlemen Prefer Blondes: The Illuminating Diary of a Professional Lady&quot; in which the protagonist, Lorelei Lee, records her flirtatious adventure in prose that &quot;follows the mannerisms of colloquial speech&quot; and suggests innocence or ignorance yet, the critic Elyse Graham observes, &quot;burlesques, in excoriating detail, the vernacular of the American middle class&quot;. The diary genre became particularly popular in the late 20th century. In 1978–81 Christopher Matthew produced three volumes of diaries recording the daily life of &quot;Simon Crisp&quot;, a bachelor would-be man-about town of the era. The title of the first, &quot;The Diary of a Somebody&quot;, is a direct reference to the Grossmith original. Reviewing this volume in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, Benny Green points out several parallels with the original, in both character and event. Matthew&#x27;s book, says Green, is amusing, but the Grossmiths&#x27; book is superior; it is &quot;affecting as well as comical, in a way that the Matthew pastiche is not&quot;. In 1982 came the first appearance of Sue Townsend&#x27;s teenage creation, Adrian Mole, whose passage into young manhood and early middle age is charted in a long series of diaries. The more middle-aged he becomes, says Morton, the more he resembles Pooter.

Keith Waterhouse&#x27;s &quot;Mrs Pooter&#x27;s Diary&quot; of 1983 is an adaptation of the Grossmith original that shifts the narrative voice to Carrie Pooter. In 1996 Helen Fielding used the imaginary diary format for &quot;Bridget Jones&#x27;s Diary&quot;, which records the daily paraphernalia of a single woman&#x27;s life. &quot;The New York Times&quot; critic wrote that it &quot;captures neatly the way modern women teeter between &#x27;I am woman&#x27; independence and a pathetic girlie desire to be all things to all men.&quot; This diary began as a weekly column in &quot;The Independent&quot;. In the 1990s the satirical magazine &quot;Private Eye&quot; lampooned John Major, British prime minister 1990–97, in &quot;The Secret Diary of John Major aged 47&quot;, a hybrid of the Adrian Mole diaries with &quot;The Diary of a Nobody&quot;, which made much fun of Major&#x27;s lower-middle class origins.

The social historian James Hammerton defines &quot;Pooterism&quot; as &quot;the dependent weakness and inflated social pretension of white-collar workers, constructed in the workplace but expressed just as powerfully at home&quot;. Jon Wilde of &quot;The Guardian&quot; observes this characteristic in a number of British TV comedy creations of the late 20th and early 21st centuries: Captain Mainwaring, Victor Meldrew, and &quot;Peep Show&quot;″s Mark Corrigan are all examples of characters &quot;whose blinkered view of themselves is forever in sharp contrast to how they are perceived by the world&quot;. Charles Pooter, says Hammerton, was a metaphor for lower middle-class pretension, pomposity and self-importance, set up for mockery by the &quot;elites&quot;. However, by the mid-20th century changes in the perception of masculine roles in lower middle-class society had stifled the mockery, as men increasingly embraced domesticity. Hammerton remarks that the Grossmiths &quot;would surely appreciate the irony in seeing features of the lower middle-class existence they mocked so mercilessly becoming the more universal model for 20th century family life&quot;. Bailey remarks on how the poet John Betjeman presented the Pooters &quot;not as objects of ridicule but of envy, snug and secure in their suburban retreat&quot;.

==Adaptations==
In September 1954 a stage version of the &quot;Diary&quot;, by Basil Dean and Richard Blake, was presented at London&#x27;s Arts Theatre with a cast that included George Benson and Dulcie Gray as the Pooters and Leslie Phillips as Lupin. Anthony Hartley, writing in &quot;The Spectator&quot;, classed this production as &quot;fair-to-middling&quot;, with sympathetic performances from the principals: &quot;[I]t is a precondition of this kind of play that everybody concerned should have a heart of gold: only in the case of Mr. Pooter&#x27;s employer, Mr. Perkupp, do we actually hear the metal chinking.&quot;

In 1986 Waterhouse presented an adaptation of his &quot;Mrs Pooter&quot; text at the Garrick Theatre, with Judi Dench and Michael Williams. This version was revived in 1993 at the Greenwich Theatre in a production by Matthew Francis. Clive Swift and Patricia Routledge played Charles and Carrie, in what Paul Taylor in &quot;The Independent&quot; described as &quot;essentially a two-hander ... in which all the other folk (including Lupin Pooter, the uppish, worrying son) are either imagined characters or, at times, impersonated by the Pooters&quot;.

In March 2011 the &quot;Diary&quot; was the subject of an even less orthodox production at the Royal &amp; Derngate Theatre, Northampton. Adapted by Hugh Osborne, with an all-male cast led by Robert Daws, this supposes that Pooter has arranged for his diaries to be performed by amateur actors. Lyn Gardner in &quot;The Guardian&quot; found it &quot;a show of some charm – though one that, like Pooter himself, does not quite have the credentials to be quite so pleased with itself&quot;. 
In 2014 a production of the &quot;Diary&quot; was staged in London by Rough Haired Pointer at the White Bear Theatre and later transferred to the King&#x27;s Head Theatre. This production was revived at the King&#x27;s Head in 2017; &quot;Time Out&quot; said of it: &quot;It captures the original’s sharp subtext, frivolous wit and heavy irony, while also being very, very silly&quot;.

The first adaptation for screen was Ken Russell&#x27;s short (40-minute) film for the BBC film unit in 1964. Russell shot this in the style of the silent films of Buster Keaton and Charlie Chaplin, with the text narrated in a voice-over. The BBC screened two subsequent adaptations: in 1979 a version dramatised by Basil Boothroyd, and in 2007 a four-part dramatisation by Andrew Davies, directed by Susanna White and first shown on BBC Four as part of the channel&#x27;s Edwardian season. &quot;The Guardian&quot;″s critic wrote of the latter that Hugh Bonneville was &quot;immaculate as the ignored kerfuffler [Pooter].&quot;

BBC Radio 4 has broadcast several dramatisations of the &quot;Diary&quot;. These include Stephen Tompkinson and Annette Badland in a 2004 adaptation by Kelvin Segger, and Johnny Vegas and Katherine Parkinson in Andrew Lynch&#x27;s 2012 adaptation. In May 1990, the BBC World Service broadcast a radio version of the 1986 Keith Waterhouse adaptation, starring Judi Dench and Michael Williams; this production was later re-broadcast on 24 December 1991 on BBC Radio 4.

<text>Prince Caspian (originally published as Prince Caspian: The Return to Narnia) is a high fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis and published by Geoffrey Bles in 1951. It was the second published of seven novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956), and Lewis had finished writing it in 1949, before the first book was out. It is volume four in recent editions of the series, sequenced according to the internal chronology of the books. Like the others, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes and her work has been retained in many later editions.

&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; features a &quot;return to Narnia&quot; by the four Pevensie children of the first novel, about a year later in England but 1300 years later in Narnia. It is the only book of &quot;The Chronicles&quot; with men dominating Narnia. The talking animals and mythical beings are oppressed, and some may be endangered. The English siblings, legendary , are magically recalled, once again children, by the refugee Prince Caspian.

Macmillan US published an American edition within the calendar year.

&quot;Prince Caspian&quot; has been adapted and filmed as two episodes of BBC television series in 1989 and as a feature film in 2008.

==Plot summary==
Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are magically whisked away from a British railway station to a beach near an old and ruined castle. They determine the ruin is Cair Paravel, where they once ruled as the kings and queens of Narnia. They discover the treasure vault where Peter&#x27;s sword and shield, Susan&#x27;s bow and arrows, and Lucy&#x27;s dagger and bottle of magical cordial are stored. Susan&#x27;s horn for summoning help is missing, as she left it in the woods the day they returned to England after their prior visit to Narnia. Although only a year has passed in England, 1300 years have passed in Narnia.

The children rescue Trumpkin the dwarf from soldiers who are about to drown him. Trumpkin tells the children Narnia&#x27;s history since their disappearance: Telmarines conquered Narnia, which is now ruled by King Miraz and his wife, Queen Prunaprismia. Miraz usurped the throne by killing his brother, King Caspian IX, the father of Prince Caspian. Miraz tolerated the rightful heir, Prince Caspian, until his own son was born. Caspian escaped from Miraz&#x27;s castle with the aid of his tutor Doctor Cornelius, who schooled him in the lore of Old Narnia, and gave him Queen Susan&#x27;s horn. Caspian fled into the forest but was knocked unconscious when his horse bolted. He awoke in the den of a talking badger, Trufflehunter, and two dwarfs, Nikabrik and Trumpkin, who accepted Caspian as their king.

The badger and dwarves took Caspian to meet many creatures of Old Narnia. During a midnight council, Doctor Cornelius arrived to warn them of the approach of King Miraz and his army; he urged them to flee to Aslan&#x27;s How in the great woods near Cair Paravel. The Telmarines followed the Narnians to the How, and after several skirmishes the Narnians appeared close to defeat. At a second war council, they decided to wind Queen Susan&#x27;s horn in the hopes that it would bring help.

Trumpkin and the Pevensies make their way to Caspian. The trek proves difficult, but Aslan appears to Lucy and instructs her to guide the others behind him. Aslan sends Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin ahead to deal with treachery brewing there, and follows with Susan and Lucy.

Peter, Edmund, and Trumpkin arrive and drive out or kill the creatures threatening Caspian. Peter challenges Miraz to single combat: the army of the victor in this duel would be considered the victor in the war. Miraz accepts the challenge, goaded by lords Glozelle and Sopespian. Miraz loses the combat, but Glozelle and Sopespian declare that the Narnians have cheated. The lords command the Telmarine army to attack, and in the commotion that follows, Glozelle stabs Miraz in the back. Aslan, accompanied by Lucy and Susan, summons the gods Bacchus and Silenus, and with their help brings the woods to life. The gods and awakened trees turn the tide of battle and send the Telmarines fleeing. Discovering themselves trapped at the Great River, where their bridge has been destroyed by Bacchus, the Telmarines surrender.

Aslan gives the Telmarines a choice of staying in Narnia under Caspian or returning to Earth, their original home. After one volunteer disappears through the magic door created by Aslan, the Pevensies go through to reassure the other Telmarines, though Peter and Susan reveal to Edmund and Lucy that they are too old to return to Narnia. The Pevensies find themselves back at the railway station.

==Characters==

*Lucy Pevensie, the youngest Pevensie child and the first to see Aslan again.
*Edmund Pevensie, the third Pevensie child. Unlike his older siblings, he trusts Lucy&#x27;s sighting of Aslan, pointing out that in their first adventure she turned out to be right and he ended up looking silly.
*Peter Pevensie, the oldest of the Pevensie siblings and High King of Narnia.
*Susan Pevensie, the second oldest of the Pevensie children. She uses a bow and arrow.
*Prince Caspian, the rightful Telmarine King, who becomes King of Narnia. He reappears in the next two books in the series: &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot; and &quot;The Silver Chair&quot;, and makes a brief appearance in the end of &quot;The Last Battle&quot;.
*Aslan, the Great Lion, who created Narnia.
*Miraz, Caspian&#x27;s uncle, who usurped the throne of the Telmarines. So long as Miraz has no son, he tolerates Caspian as heir, but when a son is born he moves to eliminate Caspian. He fights the Old Narnians, who support Caspian, and accepts a challenge to single combat with Peter to settle the matter; but he is killed treacherously by Lord Glozelle after the duel.
*Trumpkin, a Red Dwarf who helps Caspian defeat Miraz. When he is captured by Miraz&#x27;s soldiers and taken to Cair Paravel to be drowned, he is freed by the Pevensie children and leads them to Caspian. At the beginning of the novel he is entirely sceptical about the existence of Aslan and the ancient Kings and Queens, but learns better in the course of the story.
*Doctor Cornelius, half-dwarf and half-human, is tutor to Caspian and aids in the Narnians&#x27; defeat of the Telmarines.
*Reepicheep, a Talking Mouse (descended from the non-talking mice who freed Aslan from his bonds in the previous book, and were thus given the gift of speech), is a fearless swordsman and a staunch supporter of Aslan and Caspian.
*Nikabrik, a Black Dwarf in Caspian&#x27;s army, who fights alongside Caspian. Together with a Hag and a Wer-Wolf, he plots to resurrect the White Witch against the Telmarines through black magic, but all three are killed by Caspian and his allies.
*Trufflehunter, a Talking Badger, who holds faith with Aslan and Old Narnia, and aids Prince Caspian in his struggle against Miraz.
*Bacchus and Silenus, Narnian forest gods (borrowed from Ancient Greece).
* Lord Sopespian and Lord Glozelle, lords of Telmar. After being insulted by Miraz they manipulate him into accepting Peter&#x27;s challenge. They cry treachery when Miraz falls, and Glozelle secretly stabs him in the back. Sopespian is beheaded by Peter as the all-out battle begins, but Lewis does not mention the fate of Glozelle.

==Themes==

The two major themes of the story are courage and chivalry and, as Lewis himself said in a letter to an American girl, &quot;the restoration of the true religion after a corruption&quot;.

The Telmarine conquest of Narnia, as depicted in the book, is in many ways similar to the historical Norman Conquest of England. Though there is no precise parallel in actual English history to the specific events of this book, the end result – &quot;Old Narnians&quot; and Telmarines becoming a single people and living together in harmony – is similar to the historical process of Saxons and Normans eventually fusing into a single English people.

==Adaptations==
The BBC adapted &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; in two episodes of the 1989 series of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot;.

The second in the series of films from Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media, titled &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot;, was released in the US on 16 May 2008. The UK release date was 26 June 2008.

The book was the inspiration for a song of the same name on the Phish album &quot;Billy Breathes&quot;.

The script for a stage adaptation was written by Erina Caradus and first performed in 2007.

<doc id="242130" wikidata="Q485093" url="?curid=242130" title="The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe">
<text>The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe is a portal fantasy novel written by British author C. S. Lewis, published by Geoffrey Bles in 1950. It is the first published and best known of seven novels in &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; (1950–1956). Among all the author&#x27;s books, it is also the most widely held in libraries. It was the first of &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia&quot; to be written and published, but is marked as volume two in recent editions that are sequenced according the stories&#x27; internal chronology. Like the other &quot;Chronicles&quot;, it was illustrated by Pauline Baynes, and her work has been retained in many later editions.

Most of the novel is set in Narnia, a land of talking animals and mythical creatures that is ruled by the evil White Witch. In the frame story, four English children are relocated to a large, old country house following a wartime evacuation. The youngest, Lucy, visits Narnia three times via the magic of a wardrobe in a spare room. Lucy&#x27;s three siblings are with her on her third visit to Narnia. In Narnia, the siblings seem fit to fulfil an old prophecy and find themselves adventuring to save Narnia and their own lives. The lion Aslan gives his life to save one of the children; he later rises from the dead, vanquishes the White Witch, and crowns the children Kings and Queens of Narnia.

Lewis wrote the book for (and dedicated it to) his goddaughter, Lucy Barfield. She was the daughter of Owen Barfield, Lewis&#x27;s friend, teacher, adviser and trustee. In 2003, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was ranked ninth on the BBC&#x27;s The Big Read poll. &quot;Time&quot; magazine included the novel in its list of the 100 Best Young-Adult Books of All Time, as well as its list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923.

==Plot==
Peter, Susan, Edmund and Lucy Pevensie are evacuated from London in 1940, to escape the Blitz, and sent to live with Professor Digory Kirke at a large house in the English countryside. While exploring the house, Lucy enters a wardrobe and discovers the magical world of Narnia. Here, she meets the faun named Tumnus, whom she addresses as &quot;&quot;Mr&quot; Tumnus&quot;. Tumnus invites her to his cave for tea and admits that he had intended to report Lucy to the White Witch, the false ruler of Narnia who has kept the land in perpetual winter, but he repents and guides her back home. Although Lucy&#x27;s siblings initially disbelieve her story of Narnia, Edmund follows her into the wardrobe, finds himself in a separate area of Narnia and meets the White Witch, who calls herself the Queen of Narnia. The Witch plies Edmund with Turkish delight and persuades him to bring his siblings to her with the promise of being made a prince. Edmund reunites with Lucy and they return home. However, Edmund denies Narnia&#x27;s existence to Peter and Susan after learning of the White Witch&#x27;s identity from Lucy.

Soon afterwards, all four children enter Narnia together, but find that Tumnus has been arrested for treason. The children are befriended by Mr and Mrs Beaver, who tell them of a prophecy that the White Witch&#x27;s rule will end when &quot;two Sons of Adam and two Daughters of Eve&quot; sit on the four thrones of Cair Paravel, and that Narnia&#x27;s true ruler – a great lion named Aslan – is returning after several years of absence, and will go to the Stone Table. Edmund slips away to the White Witch&#x27;s castle, where he finds a courtyard filled with the Witch&#x27;s enemies turned into stone statues. Edmund reports Aslan&#x27;s return to the White Witch, who begins her movement towards the Stone Table with Edmund in tow, and orders the execution of Edmund&#x27;s siblings and the Beavers. Meanwhile, the Beavers realise where Edmund has gone, and lead the children to meet Aslan at the Stone Table. On the way they meet Father Christmas, who had been kept out of Narnia by the Witch&#x27;s magic, and he leaves the group with magical gifts, including weapons. 

Meanwhile, the White Witch and her party realise that the snow is melting, and they have to abandon the sledge. 

The children and the Beavers reach the Stone Table and meet Aslan and his army. The White Witch&#x27;s wolf captain Maugrim approaches the camp and attacks Susan, but is killed by Peter. The White Witch arrives and parleys with Aslan, invoking the &quot;Deep Magic from the Dawn of Time&quot; which gives her the right to kill Edmund for his treason. Aslan then speaks to the Witch alone, and on his return he announces that the Witch has renounced her claim on Edmund&#x27;s life. Aslan and his followers then move the encampment into the nearby forest. That evening, Susan and Lucy secretly follow Aslan to the Stone Table. They watch from a distance as the Witch puts Aslan to death, as they had agreed in their pact to spare Edmund. The next morning, Aslan is resurrected by the &quot;Deeper Magic from before the Dawn of Time&quot;, which has the power to reverse death if a willing victim takes the place of a traitor. Aslan takes the girls to the Witch&#x27;s castle and revives the Narnians that the Witch had turned to stone. They join the Narnian forces battling the Witch&#x27;s army. The Narnian army prevails, and Aslan kills the Witch. The Pevensie children are then crowned kings and queens of Narnia at Cair Paravel.

After a long and happy reign, the Pevensies, now adults, go on a hunt for the White Stag who is said to grant the wishes of those who catch it. The four arrive at the lamp-post marking Narnia&#x27;s entrance and, having forgotten about it, unintentionally pass through the wardrobe and return to England; they are children again, with no time having passed since their departure. They tell the story to the Professor, who believes them and reassures the children that they will return to Narnia one day when they least expect it.

==Main characters==
*Lucy is the youngest of four siblings. In some respects, she is the primary character of the story. She is the first to discover the land of Narnia, which she enters inadvertently when she steps into a wardrobe while exploring the Professor&#x27;s house. When Lucy tells her three siblings about Narnia, they do not believe her: Peter and Susan think she is just playing a game, while Edmund persistently ridicules her. In Narnia, she is crowned Queen Lucy the Valiant.
*Edmund is the second-youngest of four siblings. He has a bad relationship with his brother and sisters. Edmund is known to be a liar, and often harasses Lucy. Lured by the White Witch&#x27;s promise of power and an unlimited supply of magical treats, Edmund betrays his siblings. He later repents and helps defeat the White Witch. He is eventually crowned King Edmund the Just.
*Susan is the second-oldest sibling. She does not believe in Narnia until she actually goes there. She and Lucy accompany Aslan on the journey to the Stone Table, where he allows the Witch to take his life in place of Edmund&#x27;s. Tending to Aslan&#x27;s carcass, she removes a muzzle from him to restore his dignity and oversees a horde of mice who gnaw away his bonds. She then shares the joy of his resurrection and the endeavour to bring reinforcements to a critical battle. Susan is crowned Queen Susan the Gentle.
*Peter is the eldest sibling. He judiciously settles disputes between his younger brother and sisters, often rebuking Edmund for his attitude. Peter also disbelieves Lucy&#x27;s stories about Narnia until he sees it for himself. He is hailed as a hero for the slaying of Maugrim and for his command in the battle to overthrow the White Witch. He is crowned High King of Narnia and dubbed King Peter the Magnificent.
*Aslan, a lion, is the rightful King of Narnia and other magic countries. He sacrifices himself to save Edmund, but is resurrected in time to aid the denizens of Narnia and the Pevensie children against the White Witch and her minions. As the &quot;son of the Emperor-beyond-the-Sea&quot; (an allusion to God the Father), Aslan is the all-powerful creator of Narnia. Lewis revealed that he wrote Aslan as a portrait, although not an allegorical portrait, of Christ.
*The White Witch is the land&#x27;s self-proclaimed queen and the primary antagonist of the story. Her reign in Narnia has made winter persist for a hundred years with no end in sight. When provoked, she turns creatures to stone with her wand. She fears the fulfilment of a prophecy that &quot;two sons of Adam and two daughters of Eve&quot; (meaning two male humans and two female humans) will supplant her. She is usually referred to as &quot;the White Witch&quot;, or just &quot;the Witch&quot;. Her actual name, Jadis, appears once in the notice left on Tumnus&#x27;s door after his arrest. Lewis later wrote a prequel to include her back story and account for her presence in the Narnian world.
*The Professor is a kindly old gentleman who takes the children in when they are evacuated from London. He is the first to believe that Lucy did indeed visit a land called Narnia. He tries to convince the others logically that she did not make it up. After the children return from Narnia, he assures them that they will return one day. The book hints that he knows more of Narnia than he lets on (hints expanded upon in later books of the series).
*Tumnus, a faun, is the first individual Lucy (who calls him &quot;Mr Tumnus&quot;) meets in Narnia. Tumnus befriends Lucy, despite the White Witch&#x27;s standing order to turn in any human he finds. He initially plans to obey the order but, after getting to like Lucy, he cannot bear to alert the Witch&#x27;s forces. He instead escorts her back towards the safety of her own country. His good deed is later given away to the Witch by Edmund. The witch orders Tumnus arrested and turns him to stone, but he is later restored to life by Aslan.
*Mr and Mrs Beaver, two beavers, are friends of Tumnus. They play host to Peter, Susan and Lucy and lead them to Aslan.

==Writing==
Lewis described the origin of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; in an essay titled &quot;It All Began with a Picture&quot;:
:The &quot;Lion&quot; all began with a picture of a Faun carrying an umbrella and parcels in a snowy wood. This picture had been in my mind since I was about 16. Then one day, when I was about 40, I said to myself: &#x27;Let&#x27;s try to make a story about it.&#x27;

At the beginning of the Second World War, many British children were evacuated from London and other cities to the countryside to escape bombing attacks by Nazi Germany. On 2 September 1939, three schoolgirls, Margaret, Mary and Katherine, came to live at The Kilns in Risinghurst, Lewis&#x27;s home east of Oxford city centre. Lewis later suggested that the experience gave him a new appreciation of children, and in late September he began a children&#x27;s story on an odd sheet that has survived as part of another manuscript:

:This book is about four children whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter, who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, who was in the Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some kind of war work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother&#x27;s who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.

How much more of the story Lewis then wrote is uncertain. Roger Lancelyn Green thinks that he might even have completed it. In September 1947, Lewis wrote in a letter about stories for children: &quot;I have tried one myself, but it was, by the unanimous verdict of my friends, so bad that I destroyed it.&quot;

The plot element of entering a new world through the back of a wardrobe had certainly entered Lewis&#x27;s mind by 1946, when he used it to describe his first encounter with really good poetry:
:I did not in the least feel that I was getting in more quantity or better quality a pleasure I had already known. It was more as if a cupboard which one had hitherto valued as a place for hanging coats proved one day, when you opened the door, to lead to the garden of the Hesperides ...

In August 1948, during a visit by an American writer, Chad Walsh, Lewis talked vaguely about completing a children&#x27;s book he had begun &quot;in the tradition of E. Nesbit&quot;. After this conversation, not much happened until the beginning of the next year. Then everything changed. In his essay &quot;It All Began With a Picture&quot;, Lewis continues: &quot;At first I had very little idea how the story would go. But then suddenly Aslan came bounding into it. I think I had been having a good many dreams of lions about that time. Apart from that, I don&#x27;t know where the Lion came from or why he came. But once he was there, he pulled the whole story together, and soon he pulled the six other Narnian stories in after him.&quot;

The major ideas of the book echo lines Lewis had written 14 years earlier in his alliterative poem &quot;The Planets&quot;:
:... Of wrath ended
:And woes mended, of winter passed
:And guilt forgiven, and good fortune
:J is master; and of jocund revel,
:Laughter of ladies. The lion-hearted
:... are Jove&#x27;s children.

This resonance is a central component of the case, promoted chiefly by Oxford University scholar Michael Ward, for the seven &quot;Chronicles&quot; having been modelled upon the seven classical astrological planets, &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; being based on Jupiter.

On 10 March 1949, Roger Lancelyn Green dined with Lewis at Magdalen College. After the meal, Lewis read two chapters from his new children&#x27;s story to Green. Lewis asked Green&#x27;s opinion of the tale, and Green said that he thought it was good. The manuscript of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was complete by the end of March 1949. Lucy Barfield received it by the end of May. When on 16 October 1950 Geoffrey Bles in London published the first edition, three new &quot;chronicles&quot;, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, &quot;The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, and &quot;The Horse and His Boy&quot;, had also been completed.

==Illustrations==
Lewis&#x27;s publisher, Geoffrey Bles, allowed him to choose the illustrator for the novel and the &quot;Narnia&quot; series. Lewis chose Pauline Baynes, possibly on J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s recommendation. In December 1949, Bles showed Lewis the first drawings for the novel, and Lewis sent Baynes a note congratulating her, particularly on the level of detail. Lewis&#x27;s appreciation of the illustrations is evident in a letter he wrote to Baynes after &quot;The Last Battle&quot; won the Carnegie Medal for best children&#x27;s book of 1956: &quot;is it not rather &#x27;our&#x27; medal? I&#x27;m sure the illustrations were taken into account, as well as the text&quot;.

The British edition of the novel had 43 illustrations; American editions generally had fewer . The popular U.S. paperback edition published by Collier between 1970 and 1994, which sold many millions, had only 17 illustrations, many of them severely cropped from the originals, giving many readers in that country a very different experience when reading the novel . All the illustrations were restored for the 1994 worldwide HarperCollins edition, although these illustrations lacked the clarity of early printings.

==Reception==
Lewis very much enjoyed writing &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; and embarked on the sequel &quot;Prince Caspian&quot; soon after finishing the first novel. He completed the sequel by the end of 1949, less than a year after finishing the initial book. &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; had few readers during 1949 and was not published until late 1950, so his initial enthusiasm did not stem from favourable reception by the public.

While Lewis is known today on the strength of the Narnia stories as a highly successful children&#x27;s writer, the initial critical response was muted. At the time, children&#x27;s stories being realistic was fashionable; fantasy and fairy tales were seen as indulgent, appropriate only for very young readers and potentially harmful to older children, even hindering their ability to relate to everyday life. Some reviewers considered the tale overly moralistic, or the Christian elements overstated attempts to indoctrinate children. Others were concerned that the many violent incidents might frighten children.

Lewis&#x27;s publisher, Geoffrey Bles, feared that the Narnia tales would not sell, and might damage Lewis&#x27;s reputation and affect sales of his other books. Nevertheless, the novel and its successors were highly popular with young readers, and Lewis&#x27;s publisher was soon eager to release further Narnia stories.

A 2004 U.S. study found that &quot;The Lion&quot; was a common read-aloud book for seventh graders in schools in San Diego County, California. In 2005, it was included in &quot;Time&quot; unranked list of the 100 best English-language novels published since 1923. On the basis of a 2007 online poll, the U.S. National Education Association listed it as one of its &quot;Teachers&#x27; Top 100 Books for Children&quot;. In 2012, it was ranked number five among all-time children&#x27;s novels in a survey published by &quot;School Library Journal&quot;, a monthly with a primarily U.S. readership.

A 2012 survey by the University of Worcester determined that it was the second most common book that UK adults had read as children, after &quot;Alice&#x27;s Adventures in Wonderland&quot;. (Adults, perhaps limited to parents, ranked &quot;Alice&quot; and &quot;The Lion&quot; fifth and sixth as books the next generation should read, or their children should read during their lifetimes.)

&quot;TIME&quot; included the novel in its &quot;All-TIME 100 Novels&quot; (best English-language novels from 1923 to 2005). In 2003, the novel was listed at number 9 on the BBC&#x27;s survey The Big Read. It has also been published in 47 foreign languages.

==Reading order==
The matter of the reading order of the Narnia series, in the context of the change in their publication order—from its original (beginning with &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot;) to the later-adopted, now pervasive chronology-of-events order (beginning with &quot;The Magician&#x27;s Nephew&quot;)—has been a matter of extensive discussion for many years. &quot;The Lion...&quot; was originally published as the first book in the Chronicles, and most reprintings of the novels reflected that order, until departure with the Collins &quot;Fontana Lions&quot; edition in 1980. Change, however, had begun earlier—the listing of the books in the English Puffins editions as early as 1974 presented a list as a suggested reading order that placed &quot;Magician&#x27;s&quot; first—and with the Collins edition the move to the chronological order, and the series opening with &quot;Magician&#x27;s&quot;, was formalised. Walter Hooper, for one, was pleased with this, stating that the books could now be read in the order that Lewis himself &quot;said they should&quot;. When HarperCollins presented its uniform, worldwide edition of the series in 1994, it also used this sequence, going so far as to state that its &quot;editions of the Chronicles ... have been numbered in compliance with the original wishes of the author, C.S. Lewis.&quot;

In a work of literary criticism, &quot;Imagination and the Arts in C. S. Lewis,&quot; scholar Peter J. Schakel calls into question the clarity and simplicity of these conclusions, citing a variety of evidence that opposes a singular view of a correct viewing order, pieces of evidence that include Lewis&#x27;s own words. Laurence Krieg, a young fan, wrote to Lewis, asking him to adjudicate between views of the correct sequence of reading the novels; he held to reading &quot;The Magician&#x27;s...&quot; first, while his mother thought &quot;The Lion...&quot; should be read first. Lewis wrote back, stating support for the younger Krieg&#x27;s views, but called rigid conclusions into question, stating: &quot;I think I agree with your order ... [but] perhaps it does not matter very much in which order anyone reads them.&quot;

Schakel&#x27;s writings go on to pointedly question the revised order in literary-critical analyses that recognise the view of Hooper, documents such as the Krieg letter, as well as the commercial inclinations behind the creation of later editions of works in a unique order, but nevertheless argue strenuously with regard to the change in the &quot;imaginative reading experience&quot; in the later revised arrangement, the key difference being that, in the original publication order, the land of Narnia is carefully introduced in &quot;The Lion...&quot; (e.g., the children hearing the term and having to have it explained), whereas &quot;The Magician&#x27;s...&quot; has Narnia mentioned on the first page, without explanation; a similar disconnection is noted with regard to how the central character Aslan is experienced in the two reading orders. Schakel argues the matter through repeated further examples (e.g., the appearances of the lamp-post, the delineation of the characters of the White Witch and Jadis), concluding that &quot;the &#x27;new&#x27; arrangement may well be less desirable that the original&quot;. Writer Paul Ford likewise cites several scholars who have weighed in against the decision of HarperCollins to present the books in the order of their internal chronology, and continues, &quot;most scholars disagree with this decision and find it the least faithful to Lewis&#x27;s deepest intentions&quot;.

Critically, the reissue of the Puffin series in England, which was proceeding at the time of Lewis&#x27;s death in 1963 (with three volumes, beginning with &quot;The Lion...&quot;, already out, and the remaining four due soon) maintained the original order, with contemporary comments ascribed to Lewis—made to Kaye Webb, the editor of that imprint—suggesting he intended &quot;to re-edit the books ... [to] connect the things that didn&#x27;t tie up&quot;. Regardless, as at January 2022, the publication order placing &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; second in the series continues—in accord with Walter Hooper&#x27;s perception of Lewis&#x27;s intent, whether intended with or without further series changes—so that it remains the production design for the series as it is distributed worldwide.

==Allusions==
Lewis wrote, &quot;The Narnian books are not as much allegory as supposal. Suppose there were a Narnian world and it, like ours, needed redemption. What kind of incarnation and Passion might Christ be supposed to undergo &quot;there&quot;?&quot;

The main story is an allegory of Christ&#x27;s crucifixion: Aslan sacrifices himself for Edmund, a traitor who may deserve death, in the same way that Christians believe Jesus sacrificed himself for sinners. Aslan is killed on the Stone Table, symbolising Mosaic Law, which breaks when he is resurrected, symbolising the replacement of the strict justice of Old Testament law with redeeming grace and forgiveness granted on the basis of substitutionary atonement, according to Christian theology.

The character of the Professor is based on W. T. Kirkpatrick, who tutored a 16-year-old Lewis. &quot;Kirk&quot;, as he was sometimes called, taught the young Lewis much about thinking and communicating clearly, skills that would be invaluable to him later.

Narnia is caught in endless winter that has lasted a century when the children first enter. Norse tradition mythologises a &quot;great winter&quot;, known as the &quot;Fimbulwinter&quot;, said to precede Ragnarök. The trapping of Edmund by the White Witch is reminiscent of the seduction and imprisonment of Kai by the Snow Queen in Hans Christian Andersen&#x27;s novella of that name.

Several parallels are seen between the White Witch and the immortal white queen, Ayesha, of H. Rider Haggard&#x27;s &quot;She&quot;, a novel greatly admired by Lewis.

Edith Nesbit&#x27;s short story &quot;The Aunt and Amabel&quot; includes the motif of a girl entering a wardrobe to gain access to a magical place.

The freeing of Aslan&#x27;s body from the Stone Table is reminiscent of a scene from Edgar Allan Poe&#x27;s story &quot;The Pit and the Pendulum&quot;, in which a prisoner is freed when rats gnaw through his bonds. In a later book, &quot;Prince Caspian&quot;, as reward for their actions, mice gained the same intelligence and speech as other Narnian animals.

== Religious themes ==
One of the most significant themes seen in C. S. Lewis&#x27;s &quot;The Lion, The Witch and The Wardrobe&quot; is Christianity. Various aspects of characters and events in the novel reflect biblical ideas from Christianity. The lion Aslan is one of the clearest examples, as his death is very similar to that of Jesus Christ. While many readers made this connection, Lewis denied that the themes of Christianity were intentional, saying that his writing began by picturing images of characters, and the rest just came about through the writing process. While Lewis denied intentionally making the story a strictly Christian theological novel, he did admit that it could help young children accept Christianity into their lives when they were older.

After the children enter the world of Narnia through the wardrobe, Edmund finds himself in trouble under the service of the White Witch, as she tempts him with Turkish delight. When Edmund is threatened with death, Aslan offers to sacrifice himself as an atonement for the boy&#x27;s betrayal. Aslan is shaved of his fur, and stabbed on an altar of stone. This is similar to how Jesus was publicly beaten, humiliated and crucified. After his sacrifice, Aslan comes back to life, and he continues to help the children save Narnia. While this sequence of events is comparable to the death of Jesus, it is not identical to it. A few differences exist, such as the fact that Aslan did not allow himself to be killed to save the entirety of Narnia, but only to save Edmund. Aslan is also only dead for one night, while Jesus returned on the third day. Despite these differences, the image of Aslan and the event of his death and rebirth reflect those of the biblical account of Jesus&#x27;s death and resurrection, adding to the theme of Christianity throughout the novel.

==Differences between editions==
Because of labour union rules, the text of &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; was reset for the publication of the first American edition by Macmillan US in 1950. Lewis took that opportunity to make these changes to the original British edition published by Geoffrey Bles earlier that same year:

*In chapter one of the American edition, the animals in which Edmund and Susan express interest are snakes and foxes rather than the foxes and rabbits of the British edition.
*In chapter six of the American edition, the name of the White Witch&#x27;s chief of police is changed to &quot;Fenris Ulf&quot; from &quot;Maugrim&quot; in the British.
*In chapter 13 of the American edition, &quot;the trunk of the World Ash Tree&quot; takes the place of &quot;the fire-stones of the Secret Hill&quot;.

When HarperCollins took over publication of the series in 1994, they began using the original British edition for all subsequent English editions worldwide. The current U.S. edition published by Scholastic has 36,135 words.

==Adaptations==

===Television===

The story has been adapted for television three times. The first was a 10-part serial produced by ABC Weekend Television for ITV and broadcast in 1967. This version was adapted by Trevor Preston and directed by Helen Standage. 

In 1979, an animated TV miniseries, directed by &quot;Peanuts&quot; director Bill Melendez, was broadcast and won the first Emmy Award for Outstanding Animated Program. 

A third television adaptation was produced in 1988 by the BBC using a combination of live actors, animatronic puppets, and animation. The 1988 adaptation was the first of a series of four Narnia adaptations over three seasons. The programme was nominated for an Emmy Award and won a BAFTA.

===Theatre===
Stage adaptations include a 1984 version staged at London&#x27;s Westminster Theatre, produced by Vanessa Ford Productions. The play, adapted by Glyn Robbins, was directed by Richard Williams and designed by Marty Flood. Jules Tasca, Ted Drachman, and Thomas Tierney collaborated on a musical adaptation published in 1986.

A one-act stage adaptation was written by Le Clanché du Rand and published in 1989. The play has been produced several times in the United States.

In 1997, Trumpets Inc., a Filipino Christian theatre and musical production company, produced a musical rendition that Douglas Gresham, Lewis&#x27;s stepson (and co-producer of the Walden Media film adaptations), has openly declared that he feels is the closest to Lewis&#x27;s intention. It starred among others popular young Filipino singer Sam Concepcion as Edmund Pevensie.

In 1998, the Royal Shakespeare Company performed an adaptation by Adrian Mitchell, for which the acting edition has been published. In January 2009, Mitchell&#x27;s play was performed by Antic Disposition St Stephen&#x27;s Church in Belsize Park, London. The Stratford Festival in Canada mounted a new production of Mitchell&#x27;s work in June 2016.

In 2002, an Australian commercial musical production by Malcolm Cooke Productions toured the country, using both life-sized puppets and human actors. It was directed by notable film director Nadia Tass, and starred Amanda Muggleton, Dennis Olsen, Meaghan Davies, and Yolande Brown. The libretto was written by Tass&#x27;s husband and creative partner, David Parker, and the musical earned nominations in the Helpmann Awards for the Best Direction in a Musical as well as Best Presentation for Children awards in April 2003.

In August 2009 WendyBird Productions put on a show at Edinburgh Fringe. In December 2009, Theresa Heskins produced and directed a new version at the New Vic Theatre in Newcastle-under-Lyme, England.

In 2012, Michael Fentiman with Rupert Goold co-directed &quot;The Lion, the Witch and the Wardrobe&quot; at a Threesixty &quot;tented production&quot; in Kensington Gardens, London. It received a &quot;Guardian&quot; three-star review.

A new stage adaptation debuted at Leeds Playhouse in 2017. The production then transferred to London&#x27;s Bridge Theatre in 2019. In November 2021, the show began a tour across the U.K. and transferred to the West End&#x27;s Gillian Lynne Theatre for an engagement lasting from 28 July (previews from 18 July) 2022 to 8 January 2023. Directed by Michael Fentiman, the production stars Samantha Womack as the White Witch; Ammar Duffus, Robyn Sinclair, Shaka Kalokoh, and Delainey Hayles as the Pevensie siblings; and Chris Jared as Aslan.

===Film===
In 2005, the story was adapted for a theatrical film, co-produced by Walt Disney Pictures and Walden Media. It was followed by two more films: &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: Prince Caspian&quot; and &quot;The Chronicles of Narnia: The Voyage of the Dawn Treader&quot;, the latter of which was produced by 20th Century Fox instead of Disney.

<doc id="242133" wikidata="Q2495119" url="?curid=242133" title="Unite (English coin)">
<text>The unite was the second English gold coin first produced during the reign of King James I. It was named after the legends on the coin indicating the king&#x27;s intention of uniting his two kingdoms of England and Scotland. The unite was valued at twenty shillings until 1612 when the increase in the value of gold throughout Europe caused it to be raised to twenty-two shillings. The coin was produced during James I&#x27;s second coinage (1604–1619), and it was replaced in the third coinage by the Laurel worth twenty shillings. All the coins were produced at the Tower Mint in London.

Several busts of the king were used for this denomination, who is shown looking to the right of the coin and is holding the orb and sceptre; the style of the king&#x27;s beard varies during the issue. The legend on the obverse reads (Iacobus Dei Gratia Magnae Britanniae Franciae et Hiberniae Rex) – &quot;James by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows a crowned shield which shows the arms of the four countries separating the letters – &quot;Iacobus Rex&quot;, King James, and the legend (&quot;I will make them one nation&quot;, from Ezekiel 37:22).

Numerous issues of gold unites valued at twenty shillings were produced at the Tower Mint throughout the reign of King Charles I (1625–1649), both when the mint was under the king&#x27;s control and under Parliament&#x27;s control. They depict the crowned bust of the king on the obverse, looking left, with the value &quot;XX&quot; appearing behind the king&#x27;s head, and the legend – &quot;Charles by the grace of God King of Great Britain France and Ireland&quot;. The reverse shows a crown over a shield bearing the royal arms and the legend – &quot;Through concord kingdoms flourish&quot;. During the Civil War, provincial mints produced very rare unites to pay the troops, at Chester, Oxford, Bristol, Exeter, Worcester and Shrewsbury – some of these unites are today unique coins.

Gold unites were issued during the Commonwealth, this time bearing a legend exclusively in English: on the obverse and on the reverse. This was due to an association of Latin with Catholicism.

They were also issued during a period when hammered coins were issued under King Charles II (i.e. 1660–62), showing a left-facing bust of the king wearing a laurel and the legend – there were two issues, the second indicating the value &quot;XX&quot; behind the king&#x27;s head. The reverse shows a crown over the shield with the royal arms dividing the letters &quot;CR&quot; and the legend . The gold unite was replaced by the milled gold Guinea in 1663, and a twenty shilling coin did not reappear until the Sovereign of 1817.

<doc id="242135" wikidata="Q877775" url="?curid=242135" title="Projective space">
<text>In mathematics, the concept of a projective space originated from the visual effect of perspective, where parallel lines seem to meet &quot;at infinity&quot;. A projective space may thus be viewed as the extension of a Euclidean space, or, more generally, an affine space with points at infinity, in such a way that there is one point at infinity of each direction of parallel lines.

This definition of a projective space has the disadvantage of not being isotropic, having two different sorts of points, which must be considered separately in proofs. Therefore, other definitions are generally preferred. There are two classes of definitions. In synthetic geometry, &quot;point&quot; and &quot;line&quot; are primitive entities that are related by the incidence relation &quot;a point is on a line&quot; or &quot;a line passes through a point&quot;, which is subject to the axioms of projective geometry. For some such set of axioms, the projective spaces that are defined have been shown to be equivalent to those resulting from the following definition, which is more often encountered in modern textbooks.

Using linear algebra, a projective space of dimension is defined as the set of the vector lines (that is, vector subspaces of dimension one) in a vector space of dimension . Equivalently, it is the quotient set of by the equivalence relation &quot;being on the same vector line&quot;. As a vector line intersects the unit sphere of in two antipodal points, projective spaces can be equivalently defined as spheres in which antipodal points are identified. A projective space of dimension 1 is a projective line, and a projective space of dimension 2 is a projective plane.

Projective spaces are widely used in geometry, allowing for simpler statements and simpler proofs. For example, in affine geometry, two distinct lines in a plane intersect in at most one point, while, in projective geometry, they intersect in exactly one point. Also, there is only one class of conic sections, which can be distinguished only by their intersections with the line at infinity: two intersection points for hyperbolas; one for the parabola, which is tangent to the line at infinity; and no real intersection point of ellipses.

In topology, and more specifically in manifold theory, projective spaces play a fundamental role, being typical examples of non-orientable manifolds.

As outlined above, projective spaces were introduced for formalizing statements like &quot;two coplanar lines intersect in exactly one point, and this point is at infinity if the lines are parallel&quot;. Such statements are suggested by the study of perspective, which may be considered as a central projection of the three dimensional space onto a plane (see &quot;Pinhole camera model&quot;). More precisely, the entrance pupil of a camera or of the eye of an observer is the &quot;center of projection&quot;, and the image is formed on the &quot;projection plane&quot;.

Mathematically, the center of projection is a point of the space (the intersection of the axes in the figure); the projection plane (, in blue on the figure) is a plane not passing through , which is often chosen to be the plane of equation , when Cartesian coordinates are considered. Then, the central projection maps a point to the intersection of the line with the projection plane. Such an intersection exists if and only if the point does not belong to the plane (, in green on the figure) that passes through and is parallel to .

It follows that the lines passing through split in two disjoint subsets: the lines that are not contained in , which are in one to one correspondence with the points of , and those contained in , which are in one to one correspondence with the directions of parallel lines in . This suggests to define the &quot;points&quot; (called here &quot;projective points&quot; for clarity) of the projective plane as the lines passing through . A &quot;projective line&quot; in this plane consists of all projective points (which are lines) contained in a plane passing through . As the intersection of two planes passing through is a line passing through , the intersection of two distinct projective lines consists of a single projective point. The plane 
defines a projective line which is called the &quot;line at infinity&quot; of . By identifying each point of with the corresponding projective point, one can thus say that the projective plane is the disjoint union of and the (projective) line at infinity.

As an affine space with a distinguished point may be identified with its associated vector space (see &quot;&quot;), the preceding construction is generally done by starting from a vector space and is called projectivization. Also, the construction can be done by starting with a vector space of any positive dimension.

So, a projective space of dimension can be defined as the set of vector lines (vector subspaces of dimension one) in a vector space of dimension . A projective space can also be defined as the elements of any set that is in natural correspondence with this set of vector lines.

This set can be the set of equivalence classes under the equivalence relation between vectors defined by &quot;one vector is the product of the other by a nonzero scalar&quot;. In other words, this amounts to defining a projective space as the set of vector lines in which the zero vector has been removed.

A third equivalent definition is to define a projective space of dimension as the set of pairs of antipodal points in a sphere of dimension (in a space of dimension ).

== Definition ==
Given a vector space over a field , the &quot;projective space&quot; is the set of equivalence classes of under the equivalence relation defined by if there is a nonzero element of such that . If is a topological vector space, the quotient space is a topological space, endowed with the quotient topology of the subspace topology of . This is the case when is the field of the real numbers or the field of the complex numbers. If is finite dimensional, the &quot;dimension&quot; of is the dimension of minus one.

In the common case where , the projective space is denoted (as well as or , although this notation may be confused with exponentiation). The space is often called &quot;the&quot; projective space of dimension over , or &quot;the projective -space&quot;, since all projective spaces of dimension are isomorphic to it (because every vector space of dimension is isomorphic to ).

The elements of a projective space are commonly called &quot;points&quot;. If a basis of has been chosen, and, in particular if , the projective coordinates of a point &quot;P&quot; are the coordinates on the basis of any element of the corresponding equivalence class. These coordinates are commonly denoted , the colons and the brackets being used for distinguishing from usual coordinates, and emphasizing that this is an equivalence class, which is defined up to the multiplication by a non zero constant. That is, if are projective coordinates of a point, then are also projective coordinates of the same point, for any nonzero in . Also, the above definition implies that are projective coordinates of a point if and only if at least one of the coordinates is nonzero.

If is the field of real or complex numbers, a projective space is called a real projective space or a complex projective space, respectively. If is one or two, a projective space of dimension is called a projective line or a projective plane, respectively. The complex projective line is also called the Riemann sphere.

All these definitions extend naturally to the case where is a division ring; see, for example, &quot;Quaternionic projective space&quot;. The notation is sometimes used for . If is a finite field with elements, is often denoted (see &quot;PG(3,2)&quot;).

=== Subspace ===
Let be a projective space, where is a vector space over a field , and 
formula_1
be the &quot;canonical map&quot; that maps a nonzero vector to its equivalence class, which is the vector line containing with the zero vector removed.

Every linear subspace of is a union of lines. It follows that is a projective space, which can be identified with .

A &quot;projective subspace&quot; is thus a projective space that is obtained by restricting to a linear subspace the equivalence relation that defines .

If and are two different points of , the vectors and are linearly independent. It follows that:
* There is exactly one projective line that passes through two different points of , and 
* A subset of is a projective subspace if and only if, given any two different points, it contains the whole projective line passing through these points.

In synthetic geometry, where projective lines are primitive objects, the first property is an axiom, and the second one is the definition of a projective subspace.

=== Span ===
Every intersection of projective subspaces is a projective subspace. It follows that for every subset of a projective space, there is a smallest projective subspace containing , the intersection of all projective subspaces containing . This projective subspace is called the &quot;projective span&quot; of , and is a spanning set for it.

A set of points is &quot;projectively independent&quot; if its span is not the span of any proper subset of . If is a spanning set of a projective space , then there is a subset of that spans and is projectively independent (this results from the similar theorem for vector spaces). If the dimension of is , such an independent spanning set has elements.

Contrarily to the cases of vector spaces and affine spaces, an independent spanning set does not suffice for defining coordinates. One needs one more point, see next section.

=== Frame ===
A &quot;projective frame&quot; or &quot;projective basis&quot; is an ordered set of points in a projective space that allows defining coordinates. More precisely, in an -dimensional projective space, a projective frame is a tuple of points such that any of them are independent; that is, they are not contained in a hyperplane.

If is an -dimensional vector space, and is the canonical projection from to , then is a projective frame if and only if is a basis of and the coefficients of on this basis are all nonzero. By rescaling the first vectors, any frame can be rewritten as such that ; this representation is unique up to the multiplication of all with a common nonzero factor.

The &quot;projective coordinates&quot; or &quot;homogeneous coordinates&quot; of a point on a frame with are the coordinates of on the basis . They are only defined up to scaling with a common nonzero factor.

The &quot;canonical frame&quot; of the projective space consists of images by of the elements of the canonical basis of (that is, the tuples with only one nonzero entry, equal to 1), and the image by of their sum.

== Topology ==
A projective space is a topological space, as endowed with the quotient topology of the topology of a finite dimensional real vector space.

Let be the unit sphere in a normed vector space , and consider the function
formula_2
that maps a point of to the vector line passing through it. This function is continuous and surjective. The inverse image of every point of consist of two antipodal points. As spheres are compact spaces, it follows that: 
For every point of , the restriction of to a neighborhood of is a homeomorphism onto its image, provided that the neighborhood is small enough for not containing any pair of antipodal points. This shows that a projective space is a manifold. A simple atlas can be provided, as follows.

As soon as a basis has been chosen for , any vector can be identified with its coordinates on the basis, and any point of may be identified with its homogeneous coordinates. For , the set
formula_3
is an open subset of , and 
formula_4
since every point of has at least one nonzero coordinate.

To each is associated a chart, which is the homeomorphisms
formula_5
such that 
formula_6
where hats means that the corresponding term is missing.
These charts form an atlas, and, as the transition maps are analytic functions, it results that projective spaces are analytic manifolds.

For example, in the case of , that is of a projective line, there are only two , which can each be identified to a copy of the real line. In both lines, the intersection of the two charts is the set of nonzero real numbers, and the transition map is 
formula_7
in both directions. The image represents the projective line as a circle where antipodal points are identified, and shows the two homeomorphisms of a real line to the projective line; as antipodal points are identified, the image of each line is represented as an open half circle, which can be identified with the projective line with a single point removed.

=== CW complex structure ===
Real projective spaces have a simple CW complex structure, as can be obtained from by attaching an -cell with the quotient projection as the attaching map.

== Algebraic geometry ==
Originally, algebraic geometry was the study of common zeros of sets of multivariate polynomials. These common zeros, called algebraic varieties belong to an affine space. It appeared soon, that in the case of real coefficients, one must consider all the complex zeros for having accurate results. For example, the fundamental theorem of algebra asserts that a univariate square-free polynomial of degree has exactly complex roots. In the multivariate case, the consideration of complex zeros is also needed, but not sufficient: one must also consider &quot;zeros at infinity&quot;. For example, Bézout&#x27;s theorem asserts that the intersection of two plane algebraic curves of respective degrees and consists of exactly points if one consider complex points in the projective plane, and if one counts the points with their multiplicity. Another example is the genus–degree formula that allows computing the genus of a plane algebraic curve from its singularities in the &quot;complex projective plane&quot;.

So a projective variety is the set of points in a projective space, whose homogeneous coordinates are common zeros of a set of homogeneous polynomials.

Any affine variety can be &quot;completed&quot;, in a unique way, into a projective variety by adding its points at infinity, which consists of homogenizing the defining polynomials, and removing the components that are contained in the hyperplane at infinity, by saturating with respect to the homogenizing variable.

An important property of projective spaces and projective varieties is that the image of a projective variety under a morphism of algebraic varieties is closed for Zariski topology (that is, it is an algebraic set). This is a generalization to every ground field of the compactness of the real and complex projective space.

A projective space is itself a projective variety, being the set of zeros of the zero polynomial.

=== Scheme theory ===
Scheme theory, introduced by Alexander Grothendieck during the second half of 20th century, allows defining a generalization of algebraic varieties, called schemes, by gluing together smaller pieces called affine schemes, similarly as manifolds can be built by gluing together open sets of . The Proj construction is the construction of the scheme of a projective space, and, more generally of any projective variety, by gluing together affine schemes. In the case of projective spaces, one can take for these affine schemes the affine schemes associated to the charts (affine spaces) of the above description of a projective space as a manifold.
== Synthetic geometry ==
In synthetic geometry, a projective space can be defined axiomatically as a set (the set of points), together with a set of subsets of (the set of lines), satisfying these axioms:
* Each two distinct points and are in exactly one line.
* Veblen&#x27;s axiom: If , , , are distinct points and the lines through and meet, then so do the lines through and .
* Any line has at least 3 points on it.

The last axiom eliminates reducible cases that can be written as a disjoint union of projective spaces together with 2-point lines joining any two points in distinct projective spaces. More abstractly, it can be defined as an incidence structure consisting of a set of points, a set of lines, and an incidence relation that states which points lie on which lines.

The structures defined by these axioms are more general than those obtained from the vector space construction given above. If the (projective) dimension is at least three then, by the Veblen–Young theorem, there is no difference. However, for dimension two, there are examples that satisfy these axioms that can not be constructed from vector spaces (or even modules over division rings). These examples do not satisfy the theorem of Desargues and are known as non-Desarguesian planes. In dimension one, any set with at least three elements satisfies the axioms, so it is usual to assume additional structure for projective lines defined axiomatically.

It is possible to avoid the troublesome cases in low dimensions by adding or modifying axioms that define a projective space. gives such an extension due to Bachmann. To ensure that the dimension is at least two, replace the three point per line axiom above by:
* There exist four points, no three of which are collinear.
To avoid the non-Desarguesian planes, include Pappus&#x27;s theorem as an axiom;
* If the six vertices of a hexagon lie alternately on two lines, the three points of intersection of pairs of opposite sides are collinear.
And, to ensure that the vector space is defined over a field that does not have even characteristic include &quot;Fano&#x27;s axiom&quot;;
* The three diagonal points of a complete quadrangle are never collinear.

A subspace of the projective space is a subset , such that any line containing two points of is a subset of (that is, completely contained in ). The full space and the empty space are always subspaces.

The geometric dimension of the space is said to be if that is the largest number for which there is a strictly ascending chain of subspaces of this form:
formula_8

A subspace in such a chain is said to have (geometric) dimension . Subspaces of dimension 0 are called &quot;points&quot;, those of dimension 1 are called &quot;lines&quot; and so on. If the full space has dimension then any subspace of dimension is called a hyperplane.

Projective spaces admit an equivalent formulation in terms of lattice theory. There is a bijective correspondence between projective spaces and geomodular lattices, namely, subdirectly irreducible, compactly generated, complemented, modular lattices.

=== Classification ===
* Dimension 0 (no lines): The space is a single point.
* Dimension 1 (exactly one line): All points lie on the unique line.
* Dimension 2: There are at least 2 lines, and any two lines meet. A projective space for is equivalent to a projective plane. These are much harder to classify, as not all of them are isomorphic with a . The Desarguesian planes (those that are isomorphic with a satisfy Desargues&#x27;s theorem and are projective planes over division rings, but there are many non-Desarguesian planes.
* Dimension at least 3: Two non-intersecting lines exist. proved the Veblen–Young theorem, to the effect that every projective space of dimension is isomorphic with a , the -dimensional projective space over some division ring .

=== Finite projective spaces and planes ===


A &quot;finite projective space&quot; is a projective space where is a finite set of points. In any finite projective space, each line contains the same number of points and the &quot;order&quot; of the space is defined as one less than this common number. For finite projective spaces of dimension at least three, Wedderburn&#x27;s theorem implies that the division ring over which the projective space is defined must be a finite field, , whose order (that is, number of elements) is (a prime power). A finite projective space defined over such a finite field has points on a line, so the two concepts of order coincide. Notationally, is usually written as .

All finite fields of the same order are isomorphic, so, up to isomorphism, there is only one finite projective space for each dimension greater than or equal to three, over a given finite field. However, in dimension two there are non-Desarguesian planes. Up to isomorphism there are

finite projective planes of orders 2, 3, 4, ..., 10, respectively. The numbers beyond this are very difficult to calculate and are not determined except for some zero values due to the Bruck–Ryser theorem.

The smallest projective plane is the Fano plane, with 7 points and 7 lines. The smallest 3-dimensional projective space is , with 15 points, 35 lines and 15 planes.

== Morphisms ==
Injective linear maps between two vector spaces and over the same field  induce mappings of the corresponding projective spaces via:

where is a non-zero element of and [...] denotes the equivalence classes of a vector under the defining identification of the respective projective spaces. Since members of the equivalence class differ by a scalar factor, and linear maps preserve scalar factors, this induced map is well-defined. (If is not injective, it has a null space larger than ; in this case the meaning of the class of is problematic if is non-zero and in the null space. In this case one obtains a so-called rational map, see also &quot;Birational geometry&quot;.)

Two linear maps and in induce the same map between and if and only if they differ by a scalar multiple, that is if for some . Thus if one identifies the scalar multiples of the identity map with the underlying field , the set of -linear morphisms from to is simply .

The automorphisms can be described more concretely. (We deal only with automorphisms preserving the base field ). Using the notion of sheaves generated by global sections, it can be shown that any algebraic (not necessarily linear) automorphism must be linear, i.e., coming from a (linear) automorphism of the vector space . The latter form the group . By identifying maps that differ by a scalar, one concludes that
the quotient group of modulo the matrices that are scalar multiples of the identity. (These matrices form the center of .) The groups are called projective linear groups. The automorphisms of the complex projective line are called Möbius transformations.

== Dual projective space ==
When the construction above is applied to the dual space rather than , one obtains the dual projective space, which can be canonically identified with the space of hyperplanes through the origin of . That is, if is -dimensional, then is the Grassmannian of planes in .

In algebraic geometry, this construction allows for greater flexibility in the construction of projective bundles. One would like to be able to associate a projective space to &quot;every&quot; quasi-coherent sheaf over a scheme , not just the locally free ones. See EGAII, Chap. II, par. 4 for more details.

== Generalizations ==
; dimension : The projective space, being the &quot;space&quot; of all one-dimensional linear subspaces of a given vector space is generalized to Grassmannian manifold, which is parametrizing higher-dimensional subspaces (of some fixed dimension) of .
; sequence of subspaces : More generally flag manifold is the space of flags, i.e., chains of linear subspaces of .
; other subvarieties : Even more generally, moduli spaces parametrize objects such as elliptic curves of a given kind.
; other rings : Generalizing to associative rings (rather than only fields) yields, for example, the projective line over a ring.
; patching : Patching projective spaces together yields projective space bundles.

Severi–Brauer varieties are algebraic varieties over a field , which become isomorphic to projective spaces after an extension of the base field .

Another generalization of projective spaces are weighted projective spaces; these are themselves special cases of toric varieties.

<text>The left and right brachiocephalic veins (previously called innominate veins) are major veins in the upper chest, formed by the union of the ipsilateral internal jugular vein and subclavian vein (the so-called venous angle) behind the sternoclavicular joint. The left brachiocephalic vein is more than twice the length of the right brachiocephalic vein.

These veins merge to form the superior vena cava, a great vessel, posterior to the junction of the first costal cartilage with the manubrium of the sternum.

The brachiocephalic veins are the major veins returning blood to the superior vena cava.

==Left and right veins==

===Left brachiocephalic vein===
The left brachiocephalic vein is about 6cm, more than twice the length of the right brachiocephalic vein. and is formed by the confluence of the left subclavian and left internal jugular veins. In addition the left vein receives drainage from the following tributaries:
* The left vertebral vein, internal thoracic vein, inferior thyroid veins, superior intercostal veins, the thymic veins and the pericardial veins

===Right brachiocephalic vein===
The right brachiocephalic vein is about 2.5cm long. The right vein is formed by the confluence of the right subclavian vein and the right internal jugular vein. It receives the following tributaries:
* The right vertebral vein, the internal thoracic vein, and the thyroid veins, and occasionally from the first right posterior intercostal veins.

==Embryological origin==
The left brachiocephalic vein develops from the anastomosis between the left and right anterior cardinal veins when the caudal segment of the left anterior cardinal vein degenerates.

<doc id="242140" wikidata="Q736995" url="?curid=242140" title="Superior vena cava">
<text>The superior vena cava (SVC) is the superior of the two venae cavae, the great venous trunks that return deoxygenated blood from the systemic circulation to the right atrium of the heart. It is a large-diameter (24 mm) short length vein that receives venous return from the upper half of the body, above the diaphragm. Venous return from the lower half, below the diaphragm, flows through the inferior vena cava. The SVC is located in the anterior right superior mediastinum. It is the typical site of central venous access via a central venous catheter or a peripherally inserted central catheter. Mentions of &quot;the cava&quot; without further specification usually refer to the SVC.

==Structure==
The superior vena cava is formed by the left and right brachiocephalic veins, which receive blood from the upper limbs, head and neck, behind the lower border of the first right costal cartilage. It passes vertically downwards behind the first intercostal space and receives the azygos vein just before it pierces the fibrous pericardium opposite the right second costal cartilage and its lower part is intrapericardial. It then terminates in the upper and posterior part of the sinus venarum of the right atrium, at the upper right front portion of the heart. It is also known as the cranial vena cava in other animals. No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium.

The superior vena cava is made up of three layers, starting with the innermost endothelial tunica intima. The middle layer is the tunica media, composed of smooth muscle tissue, and the outermost and thickest layer is the tunica adventitia, composed of collagen and elastic connective tissue that allow for flexibility. The tunica adventitia contains three zones, with the middle zone consisting of few smooth muscle fibers; this differs from the longitudinal bundles of smooth muscle found in the same zone of the inferior vena cava. 

=== Anatomical variation ===
The most common anatomical variation is a persistent left superior vena cava. In persons with a persistent left superior vena cava, the right superior vena cava may be normal, small or absent, with or without an anterior communicating vein. This variation is present in less than 0.5% of the general population, but in up to 10% in patients with congenital heart disease.

==Clinical significance==
Superior vena cava obstruction refers to a partial or complete obstruction of the superior vena cava, typically in the context of cancer such as a cancer of the lung, metastatic cancer, or lymphoma. Obstruction can lead to enlarged veins in the head and neck, and may also cause breathlessness, cough, chest pain, and difficulty swallowing. Pemberton&#x27;s sign may be positive. Tumours causing obstruction may be treated with chemotherapy and/or radiotherapy to reduce their effects, and corticosteroids may also be given.

In tricuspid valve regurgitation, these pulsations are very strong. 

No valve divides the superior vena cava from the right atrium. As a result, the (right) atrial and (right) ventricular contractions are conducted up into the internal jugular vein and, through the sternocleidomastoid muscle, can be seen as the jugular venous pressure.

<text>The inferior vena cava is a large vein that carries the deoxygenated blood from the lower and middle body into the right atrium of the heart. It is formed by the joining of the right and the left common iliac veins, usually at the level of the fifth lumbar vertebra.

The inferior vena cava is the lower (&quot;inferior&quot;) of the two venae cavae, the two large veins that carry deoxygenated blood from the body to the right atrium of the heart: the inferior vena cava carries blood from the lower half of the body whilst the superior vena cava carries blood from the upper half of the body. Together, the venae cavae (in addition to the coronary sinus, which carries blood from the muscle of the heart itself) form the venous counterparts of the aorta.

It is a large retroperitoneal vein that lies posterior to the abdominal cavity and runs along the right side of the vertebral column. It enters the right auricle at the lower right, back side of the heart. The name derives from .

==Structure==
The IVC is formed by the joining of the left and right common iliac veins and brings collected blood into the right atrium of the heart. It also joins with the azygos vein (which runs on the right side of the vertebral column) and venous plexuses next to the spinal cord. 

The inferior vena cava begins as the left and right common iliac veins behind the abdomen unite, at about the level of L5. It passes through the thoracic diaphragm at the caval opening at the level of T8 - T9. It passes to the right of the descending aorta.

===Tributaries===
The specific levels of the tributaries are as follows:

Because the inferior vena cava is located to the right of the midline, drainage of the tributaries is not always symmetrical. On the right, the gonadal veins and suprarenal veins drain into the inferior vena cava directly. On the left, they drain into the renal vein which in turn drains into the inferior vena cava. By contrast, all the lumbar veins and hepatic veins usually drain directly into the inferior vena cava.

===Development===
In the embryo, the inferior vena cava and right auricle are separated by the valve of the inferior vena cava, also known as the &quot;Eustachian valve&quot;. In the adult, this valve typically has totally regressed or remains as a small fold of endocardium.

===Anatomy variations===
The anatomy of the IVC can exhibit abnormalities in approximately 8.7% of the global population. These variations may arise during its development, specifically between the 4th and 8th weeks of gestation, due to the intricate process of vessel formation. The IVC is composed of four segments formed from the anastomoses of various vessels: hepatic, suprarenal, renal, and infrarenal. The hepatic segment originates from the vitelline vein, while the suprarenal segment includes a portion of the right subcardinal vein that does not regress. The renal segment is created through the anastomoses of the right suprasubcardinal and postsubcardinal veins, and the infrarenal segment derives from the right supracardinal vein. The subcardinal and supracardinal veins gradually replace the postcardinal veins, which persist as the common iliac veins within the pelvis.

The formation of the IVC is a complex process that can result in anomalies. These anomalies are more frequently observed in individuals with other cardiovascular defects. The most common variants are the duplicated IVC and left IVC. In a duplicated IVC, both supracardinal veins persist, a rare variant affecting 0.2–3% of the population. Most of these anatomical variations are asymptomatic, but their identification is crucial for the accurate planning of complex surgeries to avoid complications. Ultrasound (US) systems are typically used to identify these variations; however, other techniques such as computed tomography (CT), which involves ionizing radiation, or magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which is more costly, are often preferred due to the user-dependent nature of US analysis.

In between 0.2% to 0.3% of people, the inferior vena cava may be duplicated beneath the level of the renal veins.

==Function==
The inferior vena cava is a vein. It carries deoxygenated blood from the lower half of the body to the right atrium of the heart.

The corresponding vein that carries deoxygenated blood from the upper half of the body is the superior vena cava.

== Diameter evaluation of IVC ==
Various image-processing methods have been applied to US scans of the IVC. The number of algorithms is slightly larger for the analysis of transverse than longitudinal view. This may stem from the fact that it is easier to segment a closed cross-section than an open long-axis portion of the IVC, as the latter requires careful tracking of the region of interest. In recent years, deep learning approaches are gaining more importance, so that further developments are expected in the future in such a direction.

==Clinical significance==
Health problems attributed to the IVC are most often associated with it being compressed (ruptures are rare because it has a low intraluminal pressure). Typical sources of external pressure are an enlarged aorta (abdominal aortic aneurysm), the gravid uterus (aortocaval compression syndrome) and abdominal malignancies, such as colorectal cancer, renal cell carcinoma and ovarian cancer. Since the inferior vena cava is primarily a right-sided structure, unconscious pregnant women should be turned on to their left side (the recovery position), to relieve pressure on it and facilitate venous return. In rare cases, straining associated with defecation can lead to restricted blood flow through the IVC and result in syncope (fainting).

Blockage of the inferior vena cava is rare and is treated urgently as a life-threatening condition. It is associated with deep vein thrombosis, IVC filters, liver transplantation and surgical procedures such as the insertion of a catheter in the femoral vein in the groin.

Trauma to the vena cava is usually fatal as unstoppable excessive blood loss occurs.

<text>Ubon Ratchathani (, ; , ), often shortened to Ubon (), is one of Thailand&#x27;s seventy-six provinces lies in lower northeastern Thailand also called Isan. Ubon is about from Bangkok. Neighboring provinces are (from west clockwise) Sisaket, Yasothon, and Amnat Charoen. To the north and east it borders Salavan and Champasak of Laos, to the south Preah Vihear of Cambodia.

==Geography==
At Khong Chiam the Mun River, the biggest river of the Khorat Plateau, joins the Mekong, which forms the northeastern boundary of Thailand with Laos. It is called &quot;Maenam Song Si&quot; or the &quot;Mun River alluvium&quot; because the brown water from Mekong River mixes with the blue water of the Mun. It is about from Ubon Ratchathani city centre.

The area in the Dângrêk Mountains where the borders of the three countries, Thailand, Laos, and Cambodia meet is promoted as the &quot;Emerald Triangle&quot;, in contrast to the &quot;Golden Triangle&quot; in the north of Thailand. &quot;Emerald&quot; refers to the largely intact monsoon forests there. The total forest area is or 18 percent of provincial area.

==History==
The city was founded in the late 18th century by Thao Kham Phong, descendant of Phra Wo and Phra Ta, who escaped from King Siribunsan of Vientiane into Siam Kingdom during the reign of King Taksin the Great. Later Thao Kham Phong was appointed to be &quot;Phra Pathum Wongsa&quot; The first ruler of Ubon Ratchathani. In 1792, Ubon Ratchathani became a province, and was also the administrative center of the monthon Isan. 

Until 1972, Ubon Ratchathani was the largest province of Thailand by area. Yasothon was split off from Ubon Ratchathani in 1972, followed by Amnat Charoen in 1993.

Before it became a province. Ubon Ratchathani was the administrative center of the monthon Isan, of which monthon Ubon was split off. In 1925 it became part of monthon Nakhon Ratchasima, with the abolishment of the monthon in 1933 the province became a first level subdivision of the country.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows a lotus flower in a pond. This alludes to the meaning of the name of the province, which translates to &#x27;royal city of the lotus flower&#x27;. The provincial flower is the lotus (&quot;Nymphaea lotus&quot;). The provincial tree is the Yang-na (&quot;Dipterocarpus alatus&quot;). Black-eared catfish (&quot;Pangasius larnaudii&quot;) is the provincial aquatic animal.

==Economy==
Ubon Ratchathani is the nation&#x27;s leading rice-producing province. It earns more than 10 billion baht a year from rice sales.

Ubonratchathani has many coffee cafes around the city in both downtown and in the rural area. This business runs the city lively. People tend to hang out on the weekend.

==National parks==

Ubon Ratchathani boasts the following national parks:
* Phu Chong–Na Yoi National Park is in the mountainous southern region of the province.
* Kaeng Tana National Park is in Khong Chiam District.
* Pha Taem National Park, plateaus and hills dominate the park landscape. The sheer cliffs here are a result of earthquakes. The interesting places in the national park are Pha Taem and Pha Kham. On the cliffs surfaces are numerous prehistoric cave paintings from 3,000 to 4,000 years ago. These paintings depict scenes of fishing, rice farming, figures of people, animals, hands and geometric designs that depict life during the pre-historic time and reflect the ancient lifestyle of the people who lived there.
There are four national parks, along with two other national parks, make up region 9 (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Phu Chong–Na Yoi National Park, 
* Pha Taem National Park, 
* Khao Phra Wihan National Park, 
* Kaeng Tana National Park, 

==Wildlife sanctuaries==
There are two wildlife sanctuaries, along with four other wildlife sanctuaries, make up region 9 (Ubon Ratchathani) of Thailand&#x27;s protected areas.
* Buntharik–Yot Mon Wildlife Sanctuary, 
* Yot Dom Wildlife Sanctuary, 

== Health ==
The main hospital of Ubon Ratchathani province is Sunpasitthiprasong Hospital.

== Transportation ==
===Air===
Ubon Ratchathani is served by Ubon Ratchathani Airport.

===Rail===
Ubon Ratchathani Railway Station is the main railway station in Ubon Ratchathani.

==Education==
Ubon Ratchathani province is the home of Ubon Ratchathani University.

==Administrative divisions==
===Provincial government===
The province is divided into 25 districts (&quot;amphoe&quot;). The districts are further divided into 219 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 2,469 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).
===Municipalities===
===Local government===
As of 26 November 2019 there are: one Ubon Ratchathani Provincial Administration Organisation (&quot;&quot;) and 60 municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. Ubon Ratchathani has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Chaeramae, Det Udom, Phibun Mangsahan and Warin Chamrap have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status. Further 54 subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;). The non-municipal areas are administered by 179 Subdistrict Administrative Organisations – SAO (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering all the eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<text>John Douglas &quot;Jon&quot; Lord (9 June 194116 July 2012) was an English keyboardist and composer. In 1968, Lord co-founded the hard rock band Deep Purple. Lord performed on most of the band&#x27;s most popular songs; he and drummer Ian Paice were the only continuous members in the band between 1968 and 1976, and also from its revival in 1984 until his retirement in 2002. He also played for the bands Whitesnake, Paice Ashton Lord, the Artwoods, the Flower Pot Men and Santa Barbara Machine Head. 

Lord became known for his pioneering work in fusing rock with classical or baroque forms, especially with Deep Purple. His distinctive organ playing during Deep Purple&#x27;s hard rock period was essential to the band&#x27;s signature heavy sound and contributed to the early development of heavy metal. On 11 November 2010, he was inducted as an Honorary Fellow of Stevenson College in Edinburgh, Scotland. On 15 July 2011, he was awarded an honorary Doctor of Music degree at De Montfort Hall by the University of Leicester. Lord was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame on 8 April 2016 as a member of Deep Purple.

==Early life==

===Growing up in Leicester===
Lord was born in Leicester on 9 June 1941 to Miriam (1912–1995; née Hudson) and Reginald Lord, and lived in the city until he was 20. His father was an amateur saxophonist and encouraged Lord to play music from an early age. He studied classical piano from the age of five, with a local teacher, Frederick Allt, and this focus on a classical grounding to his material was a recurring trademark in his work, both in composition, arranging and his instrumental solos on piano, organ and electronic keyboards. In particular his influences ranged from Johann Sebastian Bach (a constant reference in his music and in his keyboard improvisation) to Medieval popular music and the English tradition of Edward Elgar. He attended Wyggeston Grammar School for Boys between 1952 and 1958 where he gained O Level passes in French, music and mathematics, participated in amateur dramatics and the school choir alongside his organ and piano studies, and then worked as a clerk in a solicitor&#x27;s office for two years.

Lord absorbed the blues sounds that played a key part in his rock career, principally the raw sounds of the great American jazz and blues organists, such as Wild Bill Davis, Jimmy Smith, Jimmy McGriff and &quot;Brother&quot; Jack McDuff (&quot;Rock Candy&quot;), as well as the stage showmanship of Jerry Lee Lewis and performers like Buddy Holly, whom he saw perform at the De Montfort Hall in Leicester in March 1958. The jazz-blues organ style of black R&amp;B organ players in the 1950s and 1960s, using the trademark blues-organ sound of the Hammond organ (B3 and C3 models) and combining it with the Leslie speaker system (the well-known Hammond-Leslie speaker combination), were seminal influences on Lord. Lord also stated that he was heavily influenced by the organ-based progressive rock played by Vanilla Fudge after seeing that band perform in Great Britain in 1967, and earlier by the personal direction he received from British organ pioneer Graham Bond.

===Move to London===

Lord moved to London in 1959–60, intent on an acting career and enrolling at the Central School of Speech and Drama, in London&#x27;s Swiss Cottage. Following a celebrated student rebellion he became a founder of Drama Centre London, from where he graduated in 1964. Small acting parts followed, including in the British TV series, Emergency - Ward 10, and Lord continued playing the piano and the organ in nightclubs and as a session musician to earn a living. He started his band career in London in 1960 with the jazz ensemble The Bill Ashton Combo. Ashton became a key figure in jazz education in Britain, creating what later became the National Youth Jazz Orchestra. Between 1960 and 1963, Lord and Ashton both moved on to Red Bludd&#x27;s Bluesicians (also known as The Don Wilson Quartet), the latter of which featured the singer Arthur &quot;Art&quot; Wood, brother of guitarist Ronnie Wood. Wood had previously sung with Alexis Korner&#x27;s Blues Incorporated and was a junior figure in the British blues movement. Somewhere around this time, Lord altered his first name spelling from &quot;John&quot; to the perhaps more contemporary &quot;Jon&quot;. In this period, Lord&#x27;s session credits included playing the keyboards in the number one song &quot;You Really Got Me&quot; by The Kinks&#x27;, released in 1964; however in a &quot;Guitar World&quot; interview, Kinks frontman Ray Davies stated it was actually Arthur Greenslade playing piano on that particular track.

Following the break-up of Redd Bludd&#x27;s Bluesicians in late 1963, Wood, Lord, and the drummer Red Dunnage put together a new band, The Art Wood Combo. This also included Derek Griffiths (guitar) and Malcolm Pool (bass guitar). Dunnage left in December 1964 to be replaced by Keef Hartley, who had previously replaced Ringo Starr in Rory Storm and the Hurricanes. This band, later known as &quot;The Artwoods&quot;, focused on the organ as the bluesy, rhythmic core of their sound, in common with the contemporary bands The Spencer Davis Group (Steve Winwood on organ) and The Animals (with Alan Price). They made appearances on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Club&quot; radio show and on such TV programs as &quot;Ready Steady Go!&quot;. It also performed abroad, and it appeared on the first &quot;Ready Steady Goes Live&quot;, promoting its first single the Lead Belly song &quot;Sweet Mary&quot; — but significant commercial success eluded it. Its only charting single was &quot;I Take What I Want&quot;, which reached number 28 on 8 May 1966.

This band regrouped in 1967 as the &quot;St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre&quot;. This was an attempt to cash in on the 1930s gangster craze set off by the American film &quot;Bonnie and Clyde&quot;. Hartley left the band in 1967 to join John Mayall &amp; the Bluesbreakers. Lord next founded the blues-influenced Santa Barbara Machine Head, featuring Art&#x27;s brother, Ronnie Wood, writing and recording three powerful keyboard-driven instrumental tracks, giving a preview of the future style of Deep Purple. Soon thereafter, Lord went on to cover for the keyboard player Billy Day in The Flower Pot Men, where he met the bass guitarist Nick Simper along with drummer Carlo Little and guitarist Ged Peck. Lord and Simper then toured with this band in 1967 to promote its hit single &quot;Let&#x27;s Go to San Francisco&quot;, but the two men never recorded with this band.

===Formation of Deep Purple===
In early 1967, through his roommate Chris Curtis of the Searchers, Lord met businessman Tony Edwards who was looking to invest in the music business alongside partners Ron Hire and John Coletta (HEC Enterprises). Session guitarist Ritchie Blackmore was called in and he met Lord for the first time, but Chris Curtis&#x27;s erratic behaviour led the trio nowhere. Edwards was impressed enough by Jon Lord to ask him to form a band after Curtis faded out. Said Edwards, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t really cope with [Curtis] but I had a great rapport with Jon Lord; here was somebody sensible, somebody I could communicate with on my level.&quot; Simper was contacted, and Blackmore was recalled from Hamburg. Although top British player Bobbie Clarke was the first choice as drummer, during the auditions for a singer, Rod Evans of &quot;The Maze&quot; came in with his own drummer, Ian Paice. Blackmore, who had been impressed by Paice&#x27;s drumming when he met him in 1967, set up an audition for Paice as well. The band was called the &quot;Roundabout&quot; at first and began rehearsals at Deeves Hall in Hertfordshire. In March 1968, this became the &quot;Mark 1&quot; line-up of &quot;Deep Purple&quot;: Lord, Simper, Blackmore, Paice, and Evans.

Lord also did session work in the late 1960s with the band &quot;Boz&quot;, along with Blackmore (guitar) and Paice (drums), given that Boz was being produced by Derek Lawrence who produced Deep Purple&#x27;s first three albums. Boz was led by Boz Burrell (vocals/guitar, later bassist for King Crimson and Bad Company) and also included Chas Hodges (bass guitar).

==Deep Purple (1968-1976/1984-2002)==

===1968–1970===
It was in these three years that Lord&#x27;s trademark keyboard sound emerged. Ignoring the emergence of the Moog synthesizer, as pioneered in rock by such players as Keith Emerson, Lord began experimenting with a keyboard sound produced by driving the Hammond organ through Marshall amplifiers in an effort to match the attack and volume of Blackmore&#x27;s guitar. Lord&#x27;s version was heavier than a blues sound, and it often featured distortion and a far harder, industrial type sound that became the trademark Jon Lord organ sound. Both Emerson and Rick Wakeman publicly expressed admiration for Lord&#x27;s mould-breaking work on the organ. This delivered a rhythmic foundation to complement Blackmore&#x27;s speed and virtuosity on lead guitar. Lord also loved the sound of an RMI 368 Electra-Piano and Harpsichord, which he used on such songs as &quot;Demon&#x27;s Eye&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;.

In 1973, Lord&#x27;s original Hammond C3 gave out and he bought another from Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Also around this time, Lord and his keyboard technician, Mike Phillips, combined his Hammond C3 Organ with the RMI. Lord kept this particular Hammond C3 until his retirement from the band in 2002, when he passed it to successor Don Airey. That instrument was retired from stage use a few years later, as it had become &quot;pretty knackered&quot; according to Airey.

By pushing the Hammond-Leslie sound through Marshall amplification, Lord created a growling, heavy, mechanical sound which allowed him to compete with Blackmore as a soloist, with an organ that sounded as prominent as the lead guitar. Said one reviewer, &quot;many have tried to imitate [Lord&#x27;s] style, and all failed.&quot; Said Lord himself, &quot;There&#x27;s a way of playing a Hammond [that&#x27;s] different. A lot of people make the mistake of thinking that you can play a Hammond with a piano technique. Well, you can, but it &quot;sounds&quot; like you are playing a Hammond with a piano technique. Really, you have to learn how to play an organ. It&#x27;s a legato technique; it&#x27;s a technique to achieve legato on a non-legato instrument.&quot;

In early Deep Purple recordings, Lord had appeared to be the leader of the band. Despite the cover songs &quot;Hush&quot; and &quot;Kentucky Woman&quot; becoming hits in North America, Deep Purple never made chart success in the UK until the &quot;Concerto for Group and Orchestra&quot; album dented the UK charts in early 1970. Lord&#x27;s willingness later to play many of the key rhythm parts gave Blackmore the freedom to let loose both live and on record.

On Deep Purple&#x27;s second and third albums, Lord began indulging his ambition to fuse rock with classical music. An early example of this is the song &quot;Anthem&quot; from the album &quot;The Book of Taliesyn&quot; (1968), but a more prominent example is the song &quot;April&quot; from the band&#x27;s self-titled third album (1969). The song is recorded in three parts: (1) Lord and Blackmore only, on keyboards and acoustic guitar, respectively; (2) an orchestral arrangement complete with strings; and (3) the full rock band with vocals. Lord&#x27;s ambition enhanced his reputation among fellow musicians, but caused tension within the group. Simper later said, &quot;The reason the music lacked direction was Jon Lord fucked everything up with his classical ideas.&quot; Blackmore agreed to go along with Lord&#x27;s experimentation, provided he was given his head on the next band album.

The resulting Lord-composed &quot;Concerto For Group and Orchestra&quot; was one of rock&#x27;s earliest attempts to fuse two distinct musical idioms. Performed live at the Royal Albert Hall on 24 September 1969 (with new band members Ian Gillan and Roger Glover, Evans and Simper having been fired), it was recorded by the BBC and later released as an album in December 1969. &quot;Concerto&quot; gave Deep Purple their first highly publicised taste of mainstream fame and gave Lord the confidence to believe that his experiment and his compositional skill had a future, as well as giving Lord the opportunity to work with established classical figures, such as conductor Sir Malcolm Arnold, who brought his skills to bear by helping Lord realise the work and to protect him from the inevitable disdain of the older members of the orchestra.

===1970–1976===

Purple began work on &quot;Deep Purple in Rock,&quot; released by their new label Harvest in 1970 and now recognised as one of hard rock&#x27;s key early works. Lord and Blackmore competed to out-dazzle each other, often in classical-style, midsection &#x27;call and answer&#x27; improvisation (on tracks like &quot;Speed King&quot; and &quot;Bloodsucker&quot;), something they employed to great effect live. Ian Gillan said that Lord provided the idea on the main organ riff for &quot;Child in Time&quot; although the riff was also based on It&#x27;s a Beautiful Day&#x27;s 1969 psychedelic hit song &quot;Bombay Calling&quot;. Lord&#x27;s experimental solo on &quot;Hard Lovin&#x27; Man&quot; (complete with police-siren interpolation) from this album was his personal favourite among his Deep Purple studio performances.

Deep Purple released another six studio albums between 1971 (&quot;Fireball&quot;) and 1975 (&quot;Come Taste the Band&quot;). Gillan and Glover left in 1973 and Blackmore in 1975, and the band disintegrated in 1976. The highlights of Lord&#x27;s Purple work in the period include the 1972 album &quot;Machine Head&quot; (featuring his rhythmic underpinnings on &quot;Smoke on the Water&quot; and &quot;Space Truckin&#x27;&quot;, plus the organ solos on &quot;Highway Star&quot;, &quot;Pictures of Home&quot; and &quot;Lazy&quot;), the sonic bombast of the &quot;Made in Japan&quot; live album (1972), an extended, effect-laden solo on &quot;Rat Bat Blue&quot; from the &quot;Who Do We Think We Are&quot; album (1973), and his overall playing on the &quot;Burn&quot; album from 1974.

Roger Glover would later describe Lord as a true &quot;Zen-archer soloist&quot;, someone whose best keyboard improvisation often came at the first attempt. Lord&#x27;s strict reliance on the Hammond C3 organ sound, as opposed to the synthesizer experimentation of his contemporaries, places him firmly in the jazz-blues category as a band musician and far from the progressive-rock sound of Keith Emerson and Rick Wakeman. Lord rarely ventured into the synthesizer territory on Purple albums, often limiting his experimentation to the use of the ring modulator with the Hammond, to give live performances on tracks like Space Truckin&#x27; a distinctive &#x27;spacey&#x27; sound. Instances of his Deep Purple synthesizer use (he became an endorser of the ARP Odyssey) include &quot;&#x27;A&#x27; 200&quot;, the final track from &quot;Burn&quot;, and &quot;Love Child&quot; on the &quot;Come Taste the Band&quot; album.

In early 1973 Lord stated: &quot;We&#x27;re as valid as anything by Beethoven.&quot;

==As a composer==
Lord continued to focus on his classical aspirations alongside his Deep Purple career. The BBC, buoyed by the success of the Concerto, commissioned him to write another piece and the resulting &quot;Gemini Suite&quot; was performed by Deep Purple and the Light Music Society under Malcolm Arnold at the Royal Festival Hall in September 1970, and then in Munich with the Kammerorchester conducted by Eberhard Schoener in January 1972. It then became the basis for Lord&#x27;s first solo album, &quot;Gemini Suite&quot;, released in November 1972, with vocals by Yvonne Elliman and Tony Ashton and with the London Symphony Orchestra backing a band that included Albert Lee on guitar.

Lord&#x27;s collaboration with the highly experimental and supportive Schoener resulted in a second live performance of the Suite in late 1973 and a new Lord album with Schoener, entitled &quot;Windows&quot;, in 1974. It proved to be Lord&#x27;s most experimental work and was released to mixed reactions. However, the dalliances with Bach on &quot;Windows&quot; and the pleasure of collaborating with Schoener resulted in perhaps Lord&#x27;s most confident solo work and perhaps his strongest orchestral album, &quot;Sarabande&quot;, recorded in Germany in September 1975 with the Philharmonia Hungarica conducted by Schoener. Composed of eight pieces (from the opening sweep of Fantasia to the Finale), at least five pieces form the typical construction of a baroque dance suite. The key pieces (Sarabande, Gigue, Bouree, Pavane and Caprice) feature rich orchestration complemented sometimes by the interpolation of rock themes, played by a session band comprising Pete York, Mark Nauseef and Andy Summers, with organ and synthesizers played by Lord.

In March 1974, Lord and Paice had collaborated with friend Tony Ashton on &quot;First of the Big Bands&quot;, credited to &#x27;Tony Ashton &amp; Jon Lord&#x27; and featuring a rich array of session talent, including Carmine Appice, Ian Paice, Peter Frampton and Pink Floyd saxophonist/sessioner, Dick Parry. They performed much of the set live at the London Palladium in September 1974.

This formed the basis of Lord&#x27;s first post-Deep Purple project Paice Ashton Lord, which lasted only a year and spawned a single album, &quot;Malice in Wonderland&quot; in 1977, recorded at Musicland Studios at the Arabella Hotel in Munich. A second album was begun but subsequently abandoned. He created an informal group of friends and collaborators including Ashton, Paice, Bernie Marsden, Boz Burrell and later, Bad Company&#x27;s Mick Ralphs, Simon Kirke and others. Over the same period, Lord guested on albums by Maggie Bell, Nazareth and even folk artist Richard Digance. 

Lord also guested as one of several keyboard players on the live performance of David Bedford&#x27;s &quot;The Odyssey&quot;. The composer and musician (&quot;The Orchestral Tubular Bells&quot; (1975), &quot;Star&#x27;s End&quot; (1974), &quot;The Rime Of The Ancient Mariner&quot; (1975)), performed a live concert of a musical version of Homer&#x27;s play, at the Royal Albert Hall on 25 January 1977. Andy Summers, who found fame in The Police played guitar on The Odyssey studio recording and asked Lord to be one of the keyboard players for this concert. The set began with a cut down live version of &quot;Sarabande&quot;, on which Summers had played on the studio recording session in September 1975. 

Eager to pay off a huge tax bill upon his return the UK in the late-1970s (Purple&#x27;s excesses included their own tour jet and a home Lord rented in Malibu from actress Ann-Margret and where he wrote the &quot;Sarabande&quot; album), Lord joined former Deep Purple band member David Coverdale&#x27;s new band, Whitesnake in August 1978 (Ian Paice joined them in 1980 and stayed until 1982).

==Whitesnake, 1978–1984==

Lord&#x27;s job in Whitesnake was largely limited to adding colour (or, in his own words, a &#x27;halo&#x27;) to round out a blues-rock sound that already accommodated two lead guitarists, Bernie Marsden and Micky Moody. He added a Yamaha CP-70 electric piano to his set-up and finally a huge bank of synthesizers onstage courtesy of Moog (Minimoog, Opus, Polymoog) so he could play the 12-bar blues the band often required and recreate string section and other effects. Such varied work is evident on tracks like &quot;Here I Go Again&quot;, &quot;Wine, Women and Song&quot;, &quot;She&#x27;s a Woman&quot; and &quot;Till the Day I Die&quot;. A number of singles entered the UK chart, taking the now 30-something Lord onto &quot;Top of the Pops&quot; with regularity between 1980 and 1983. He later expressed frustration that he was a poorly paid hired-hand, but fans saw little of this discord and Whitesnake&#x27;s commercial success kept him at the forefront of readers&#x27; polls as heavy rock&#x27;s foremost keyboard maestro. His dissatisfaction (and Coverdale&#x27;s eagerness to revamp the band&#x27;s line-up and lower the average age to help crack the US market) smoothed the way for the reformation of Deep Purple Mk II in 1984.

Jon Lord&#x27;s last Whitesnake concert took place in the Swedish TV programme &quot;Måndagsbörsen&quot; on 16 April 1984.

During his tenure in Whitesnake, Lord had the opportunity to record two distinctly different solo albums. 1982s &quot;Before I Forget&quot; featured a largely conventional eight-song line-up, no orchestra and with the bulk of the songs being either mainstream rock tracks (&quot;Hollywood Rock And Roll&quot;, &quot;Chance on a Feeling&quot;), or – specifically on side two – a series of English classical piano ballads sung by the mother and daughter duo Vicki Brown and Sam Brown (wife and daughter of entertainer Joe Brown) and vocalist Elmer Gantry as well as piano and synthesiser instrumentals such as &quot;Burntwood&quot;, named after Lord&#x27;s stately Oxfordshire home at the time. The album also boasted the cream of British rock talent, including the session drummer (and National Youth Jazz Orchestra alumnus) Simon Phillips, Cozy Powell, Neil Murray, Simon Kirke, Boz Burrell and Mick Ralphs.

Additionally, Lord was commissioned by producer Patrick Gamble for Central Television to write the soundtrack for their 1984 TV series, &quot;Country Diary of an Edwardian Lady&quot;, based on the book by Edith Holden, with an orchestra conducted by Alfred Ralston and with a distinctly gentle, pastoral series of themes composed by Lord. Lord became firmly established as a member of UK rock&#x27;s &quot;Oxfordshire mansion aristocracy&quot; – with a home, Burntwood Hall, set in at Goring-on-Thames, complete with its own cricket pitch and a hand-painted Challen baby grand piano, previously owned by Shirley Bassey. He was asked to guest on albums by friends George Harrison (&quot;Gone Troppo&quot; from 1982) and Pink Floyd&#x27;s David Gilmour (1984&#x27;s &quot;About Face&quot;), Cozy Powell (&quot;Octopuss&quot; in 1983) and to play on an adaptation of Kenneth Grahame&#x27;s 1908 classic, &quot;The Wind in the Willows&quot;. He composed and produced the score for &quot;White Fire&quot; (1984), which consisted largely of two songs performed by Limelight. In 1985 he made a brief appearance as a member of The Singing Rebel&#x27;s band (which also featured Eric Clapton, George Harrison and Ringo Starr) in the Dick Clement and Ian La Frenais-scripted film &quot;Water&quot; (1985) (Handmade Films).

In the 1980s he was also a member of an all-star band called Olympic Rock &amp; Blues Circus fronted by Pete York and featuring a rotating line-up of Miller Anderson, Tony Ashton, Brian Auger, Zoot Money, Colin Hodgkinson, Chris Farlowe and many others. Olympic Rock &amp; Blues Circus toured primarily in Germany between 1981 and 1989. Some musicians, including Lord, took part in York&#x27;s TV musical extravaganza &quot;Superdrumming&quot; between 1987 and 1989.

==Later work, 1984–2006==

Lord&#x27;s re-emergence with Deep Purple in 1984 resulted in huge audiences for the reformed Mk II line-up, including 1985&#x27;s second largest grossing tour in the US and an appearance in front of 80,000 rain-soaked fans headlining Knebworth on 22 June 1985, all to support the &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; album. Playing with a rejuvenated Mk. II Purple line-up (including spells at a health farm to get the band including Lord into shape) and being onstage and in the studio with Blackmore, gave Lord the chance to push himself once again. His &#x27;rubato&#x27; classical opening sequence to the album&#x27;s opener, &quot;Knocking at Your Back Door&quot; (complete with F-Minor to G polychordal harmony sequence), gave Lord the chance to do his most powerful work for years, including the song &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot;. Further Deep Purple albums followed, often of varying quality, and by the late-1990s, Lord was clearly keen to explore new avenues for his musical career.
In 1997, he created perhaps his most personal work to date, &quot;Pictured Within&quot;, released in 1998 with a European tour to support it. Lord&#x27;s mother Miriam had died in August 1995 and the album is inflected at all stages by Lord&#x27;s sense of grief. Recorded largely in Lord&#x27;s home-away-from-home, the city of Cologne, the album&#x27;s themes are Elgarian and alpine in equal measure. Lord signed to Virgin Classics to release it, and perhaps saw it as the first stage in his eventual departure from Purple to embark on a low-key and altogether more gentle solo career. One song from &quot;Pictured Within&quot;, entitled &quot;Wait A While&quot; was later covered by Norwegian singer Sissel Kyrkjebø on her 2003/2004 album &quot;My Heart&quot;.

Lord finally retired from Deep Purple amicably after their UK tour in February 2002, preceded by a knee injury that eventually resolved itself without surgery and which brought keyboardist Don Airey into the band, initially as his temporary replacement. He said subsequently, &quot;Leaving Deep Purple was just as traumatic as I had always suspected it would be and more so – if you see what I mean&quot;. He even dedicated a song to it on 2004&#x27;s solo effort, &quot;Beyond the Notes&quot;, called &quot;De Profundis&quot;. The album was recorded in Bonn with producer between June and July 2004.
&quot;Pictured Within&quot; and &quot;Beyond the Notes&quot; provide the most personal work by Lord. He collaborated with former ABBA superstar and family friend Frida (Anni-Frid Lyngstad) on the 2004 track, &quot;The Sun Will Shine Again&quot; (with lyrics by Sam Brown), and performed with her across Europe. He subsequently also performed European concerts to première the 2007-scheduled orchestral piece &quot;Boom of the Tingling Strings&quot;.

In 2003 he also returned to his beloved R&amp;B and blues heritage to record an album of standards in Sydney, with Australia&#x27;s Jimmy Barnes, entitled &quot;Live in the Basement&quot;, by Jon Lord and the Hoochie Coochie Men. Lord was also happy to support the Sam Buxton Sunflower Jam Healing Trust and in September 2006, performed at a star-studded event to support the charity led by Ian Paice&#x27;s wife, Jacky (twin sister of Lord&#x27;s wife Vicky). Featured artists on stage with Lord included Paul Weller, Robert Plant, Phil Manzanera, Ian Paice and Bernie Marsden.

==Final work, after 2006==
Two Lord compositions, &quot;Boom of the Tingling Strings&quot; and &quot;Disguises (Suite for String Orchestra)&quot;, were recorded in Denmark in 2006 and released in April 2008 on EMI Classics. Both featured the Odense orchestra, conducted by Paul Mann. Additionally, a second Hoochie Coochie Men album was recorded in July 2006 in London. This album, &quot;Danger – White Men Dancing&quot;, was released in October 2007. His &quot;Durham Concerto&quot;, commissioned by Durham University for its 175th anniversary celebrations, received its world premiere on 20 October 2007 in Durham Cathedral by the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, and featured soloists Lord on Hammond Organ, Kathryn Tickell on Northumbrian pipes, Matthew Barley on cello and Ruth Palmer on violin. It became a hit in Classic FM&#x27;s &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;, alongside his piano concerto &quot;Boom of the Tingling Strings&quot;.

Lord played piano on George Harrison&#x27;s posthumously released &quot;Brainwashed&quot; album (2002) and became an important member of Harrison&#x27;s social circle at Friar Park in Oxfordshire (Lord by now living first at Yewden Lodge in Hambleden and then at the time of his death at Hill House, in Fawley, Henley-On-Thames), the two having first met at Abbey Road studios in the early 1970s. He was also a close friend of Sir John Mortimer, the English barrister, dramatist, screenwriter, author and creator of British television series &quot;Rumpole of the Bailey&quot;, whom he had accompanied on many occasions during Mortimer&#x27;s performances of &quot;Mortimer Miscellany.&quot; In 2007, Lord joined Derek Griffiths, Colin Martin and Malcolm Pool at an Artwoods reunion at the ART Tribute night, at York House in Twickenham. Ali Mackenzie took over Art Wood&#x27;s role on vocals, and Chris Hunt played drums. They were joined on stage by guitarist Ronnie Wood and vocalist Geno Washington. Lord released his solo album &quot;To Notice Such Things&quot; on 29 March 2010. Titled after the main work—a six movement suite for solo flute, piano and string orchestra—the album was inspired by, and was dedicated to the memory of Sir John Mortimer, who died in January 2009. On its first day of release, the album entered Amazon&#x27;s Movers And Shakers index, reaching No. 12 at the end of the day. Six days later it entered the UK&#x27;s official classical chart at No. 4. Lord had been commissioned to compose a concerto for Hammond organ and orchestra with special parts for tympani. The piece was to be premiered with the Oslo Philharmonic Orchestra with Tom Vissgren on tympani in Oslo, Norway in Spring 2012. With Vladimir Ashkenazy and Josef Suk, Lord was one of three artistic sponsors of Toccata Classics.

In July 2011, Lord performed his final live concert appearance, the Sunflower Jam at the Royal Albert Hall, where he premiered his joint composition, &quot;It&#x27;s not as big as it was&quot;, with Rick Wakeman. At that point, they had begun informal discussion on recording an album together. Up until 2011, Lord had also been working on material with recently formed rock supergroup WhoCares, also featuring singer Ian Gillan from Deep Purple, guitarist Tony Iommi from Black Sabbath, second guitarist Mikko Lindström from HIM, bassist Jason Newsted formerly from Metallica and drummer Nicko McBrain from Iron Maiden, specifically the composition &quot;Out of My Mind,&quot; in addition to new compositions with Steve Balsamo and a Hammond Organ concerto. Lord subsequently cancelled a performance of his &quot;Durham Concerto&quot; in Hagen, Germany, for what his website said was a continuation of his medical treatment (the concert, scheduled for 6 July 2012, would have been his return to live performance after treatment).

Lord&#x27;s Concerto for Group and Orchestra was effectively recommissioned by him, recorded in Liverpool and at Abbey Road Studios across 2011 and under post-production in 2012 with the Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra performing, conducted by long-time collaborator, conductor Paul Mann. The recording was at completion at the time of Lord&#x27;s death, with Lord having been able to review the final master recordings. The album and DVD were subsequently released in 2012.

==Personal life==
Lord has a younger brother, Stephen. Lord&#x27;s first marriage, from 1969 to 1975, was to Judith Feldman, with whom he had one daughter, Sara. Lord&#x27;s second wife, Victoria Frances Gibbs, was a former girlfriend of Purple bandmate Glenn Hughes and twin sister of Ian Paice&#x27;s wife, Jacqueline Paice (founder of the charity Sunflower Jam). The sisters&#x27; father was Frank Gibbs, owner of the Oakley House Country Club in Brewood, South Staffordshire. Jon and Vicky also had one daughter, Amy.

==Illness and death==
In July 2011, Lord was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer. After treatment in both England and in Israel, he died on 16 July 2012 at the London Clinic following a pulmonary embolism. His interment was at the new churchyard of Saint Mary the Virgin Church in Hambleden.

==Influence and legacy==
Lars Ulrich, founding member and drummer in Metallica commented, &quot;Ever since my father took me to see them in 1973 in Copenhagen, at the impressionable age of 9, Deep Purple has been the most constant, continuous and inspiring musical presence in my life. They have meant more to me than any other band in existence, and have had an enormous part in shaping who I am. We can all be guilty of lightly throwing adjectives like &#x27;unique,&#x27; &#x27;one-of-a-kind&#x27; and &#x27;pioneering&#x27; around when we want to describe our heroes and the people who&#x27;ve moved us, but there are no more fitting words than those right now and there simply was no musician like Jon Lord in the history of hard rock. Nobody. Period. There was nobody that played like him. There was nobody that sounded like him. There was nobody that wrote like him. There was nobody that looked like him. There was nobody more articulate, gentlemanly, warm, or fucking cooler that ever played keyboards or got anywhere near a keyboard. What he did was all his own.&quot;

Interviewed in 2012 for Blabbermouth.net, Motörhead frontman Lemmy said: &quot;It&#x27;s just a shame, because Jon Lord was, to a large extent, responsible for me being in rock and roll. He was in a band called the Artwoods years ago, with Ronnie Wood&#x27;s brother Arthur. They were sort of a jazz-blues band, I guess. They played at the place in Wales where I was living, this dingy little boozer, and I was talking to Jon and, like an idiot, he gave me his address in London. So, of course, I went down there and he wasn&#x27;t there, but he was living at Art&#x27;s mother&#x27;s house where Ronnie Wood who was in a band called The Birds was living and they let me crash on the couch... I saw him late last year in a hotel in Germany in Cologne. He was over there doing some orchestral stuff, and we talked in the bar for awhile... I&#x27;m glad I saw him, since he&#x27;s since departed.&quot;

Also in 2012, music critic Terence Towles Canote wrote shortly after Lord&#x27;s death: &quot;While many of his contemporaries would turn to the Moog synthesiser, Jon Lord continued to rely primarily on the Hammond organ. Of course, it must be pointed out that Jon Lord could make a Hammond organ do things that other keyboardists could only dream about. Jon Lord&#x27;s playing not only stood out from the pack, it also held up over time. As a youth in the Eighties I could listen to old Deep Purple songs and they would not sound dated at all. It is an incredible achievement for any artist to create works that are essentially timeless, and that is precisely what Jon Lord did.&quot;

Former keyboard player of the rock band Yes, Rick Wakeman, who was a friend of Lord&#x27;s, said he was &quot;a great fan&quot; and added &quot;We were going to write and record an album before he became ill. His contribution to music and to classic rock was immeasurable and I will miss him terribly.&quot; In mid-2013, Wakeman presented a BBC One East Midlands-produced TV programme about Lord and his connection to the town of his birth.

Vocalist Anni-Frid Lyngstad of Abba described Jon Lord as her &quot;dearest friend&quot; and paid him tribute at the 2013 Zermatt Unplugged music festival, an annual event for which she and Lord served as patrons. &quot;He was graceful, intelligent, polite, with a strong integrity,&quot; she said. &quot;(He) had a strong empathy and a great deal of humour for his own and other people&#x27;s weaknesses.&quot;

Keyboardist Keith Emerson said of Lord&#x27;s death, &quot;Jon left us now but his music and inspiration will live forever. I am deeply saddened by his departure.&quot; In a later interview in November 2013, he added, &quot;In the early years I remember being quite jealous of Jon Lord – may he rest in peace. In September 1969 I heard he was debuting his &quot;Concerto For Group &amp; Orchestra&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall, with none other than Malcolm Arnold conducting. Wow! I had to go along and see that. Jon and I ribbed each other, we were pretty much pals, but I walked away and thought: &#x27;Shit, in a couple of weeks&#x27; time I&#x27;m going to be recording The Nice&#x27;s &quot;Five Bridges Suite&quot; ... not at the Albert Hall but at the Fairfield Halls, Croydon!&#x27; A much more prosaic venue. Later, Jon wanted me to play on his solo album, &quot;Gemini Suite&quot;, but that was around the time ELP were breaking big and we were touring. He was a lovely guy, a real gentleman.&quot;

A tribute concert to Lord took place on 4 April 2014 at the Royal Albert Hall. Performers and presenters included Deep Purple, Bob Harris, Paul Weller, Bruce Dickinson, Alfie Boe, Jeremy Irons, Rick Wakeman, Joe Brown, Glenn Hughes, Kasia Laska, Miller Anderson and Steve Balsamo. Musical Director of the event was Paul Wix Wickens and the performance featured the Orion Orchestra conducted by Paul Mann.

In December 2012 the Mayor of Leicester, Sir Peter Soulsby, joined the campaign to honour Lord with a blue plaque at his childhood home at 120 Averill Road, where he lived until he was 20 years old, saying it would be &quot;an important reminder of the city&#x27;s contribution to the world of contemporary music.&quot;

Lord was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of Deep Purple in April 2016.

In May 2019 Lord was posthumously awarded an Ivor Novello Award for International Achievement along with the surviving members of the Deep Purple MK II line up, at a ceremony at the Grosvenor House Hotel in London.

The Concerto For Group and Orchestra is toured regularly with Paul Mann conducting. Most recently in March and April 2023, a European and Brazilian tour took place across 11 dates in cities including Bucharest, Sofia, Zagreb and Sao Paolo featuring Bruce Dickinson performing the vocal parts. Members of Orquestra Sinfônica do Estado de São Paulo featured alongside Kaitner Z Doka on guitar, Bernhard Welz on drums, John O&#x27;Hara (Jethro Tull) on keyboards, Tanya O&#x27;Callaghan (Whitesnake) on bass and Mario Argandoña on percussion.

<doc id="242151" wikidata="Q1375680" url="?curid=242151" title="Mervyn King, Baron King of Lothbury">
<text>Mervyn Allister King, Baron King of Lothbury (born 30 March 1948) is a British economist and public servant who served as the Governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013. He is a School Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics. He is also the Chairman of the Philharmonia.

Born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, King attended Wolverhampton Grammar School and studied economics at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge, St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and Harvard University. He then worked as a researcher on the Cambridge Growth Project, taught at the University of Birmingham, Harvard and MIT, and became a professor of economics at the London School of Economics. He joined the Bank of England in 1990 as a non-executive director, and became the chief economist in 1991. In 1998, he became a deputy governor of the bank and a member of the Group of Thirty.

King was appointed as governor of the Bank of England in 2003, succeeding Edward George. Most notably, he oversaw the bank during the 2008 financial crisis and the Great Recession. King retired from his office as governor in June 2013, and was succeeded by Mark Carney. He was appointed a life peer and entered the House of Lords as a crossbencher in July 2013. Since September 2014 he has served as a professor of economics and law with a joint appointment at New York University&#x27;s Stern School of Business and School of Law.

==Early life and career==
Mervyn King is a son of Eric King, a railway porter who retrained as a geography teacher after the war, and Kathleen (née Passingham). He was born in Chesham Bois, Buckinghamshire, and studied at Warstones Junior School Wolverhampton and then at Wolverhampton Grammar School. He matriculated at King&#x27;s College, Cambridge (gaining a first-class degree in economics in 1969; MA); St John&#x27;s College, Cambridge; and, as a Kennedy Scholar, Harvard University. Whilst at Cambridge, King was treasurer of the Cambridge University Liberal Club in 1968. While at Harvard, King&#x27;s academic advisor and mentor was American economist Martin Feldstein who he described as &quot;a very important influence.&quot;

After graduation, he worked as a researcher on the Cambridge Growth Project with future Nobel Laureate Richard Stone and Terry Barker at the University of Cambridge. He then taught at the University of Birmingham and was a visiting professor at Harvard and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) where he shared an office with then-assistant-professor Ben Bernanke. King says that while at Birmingham, he was influenced by the Austrian School of Economics. From October 1984 he was Professor of Economics at the London School of Economics where he founded the Financial Markets Group. In 1981, he was one of the 364 university economists who signed a letter to &quot;The Times&quot; condemning Geoffrey Howe&#x27;s 1981 Budget.

==Bank of England==
King joined the bank in March 1991 as chief economist and executive director, after being a non-executive director from 1990 to 1991. He was appointed Deputy Governor in 1997, taking up his post on 1 June 1998. In the same year, King became a member of the Group of Thirty. An ex-officio member of the bank&#x27;s interest-rate setting Monetary Policy Committee since its inception in 1997, King took part in its monthly meetings. He succeeded Sir Edward George as governor on 1 July 2003, and was also the first incumbent governor of the Bank of England to be received in audience with Queen Elizabeth II.

While Governor, King was responsible for putting Matthew Boulton and James Watt on the £50 note, Adam Smith on the £20 note, and Winston Churchill on the £5 note.

=== The financial crisis in the late 2000s ===
After becoming Bank governor, King explained that Bank of England policy was &quot;similar to that of the Federal Reserve&quot; under Alan Greenspan. Greenspan described his approach as &quot;mitigat[ing] the fallout [from the bursting of a bubble] when it occurs&quot;. King agreed with Alan Greenspan that, &quot;It is hard to identify asset price &#x27;bubbles&#x27;.&quot;

Other warnings about the UK housing market followed, including from the National Institute of Economic and Social Research in 2004 and the OECD in 2005. King noted the &quot;unusually large&quot; difference between the RPIX and CPI at the beginning of 2004 (the latter does not include house prices as part of its inflation measure, whilst the former does), and, six months later, that UK house prices had risen &quot;to levels which are well above what most people would regard as sustainable in the longer term&quot;, having increased by more than 20% over the preceding year and more than 100% over the preceding five.

In 2005, &quot;The Economist&quot; described the run-up in UK house prices as forming part of &quot;the biggest bubble in history&quot;, and, by October 2007—when the UK housing bubble was at its peak — the IMF was reporting that the UK housing market was &quot;overpriced by up to 40 per cent&quot;. As noted by the OECD, house-price volatility &quot;can raise systemic risks as the banking and mortgage sectors are vulnerable to fluctuations in house prices due to their exposure to the housing market.&quot;

Dean Baker in The American Prospect said the failure by Greenspan and King to tackle the bubbles in their respective countries&#x27; housing markets resulted in catastrophic &quot;fallout&quot; when the bubbles burst, resulting in the worst recessions in both countries since the Great Depression. UK–US inaction may be compared to action taken by China and Australia.

Another result of the financial crisis was King&#x27;s rejection of the bank&#x27;s devout focus on price stability, or inflation targeting, a policy that was instituted after Black Wednesday in 1992 and that was continued by King after becoming governor in 2003. One of the two early lessons King drew from crisis were that &quot;price stability does not guarantee stability of the economy as a whole&quot; and that &quot;the instruments used to pursue financial stability are in need of sharpening and refining.&quot;

The 2012 Financial Services Bill, in transferring the majority of macroprudential regulatory powers from the FSA to the bank, will grant the Financial Policy Committee (chaired by King) the power to curb lending in booms, including placing limits on the public&#x27;s access to mortgages. A former, senior BoE official summed up the bank&#x27;s pre-crisis performance: &quot;How can you look back with the benefit of hindsight and see it as a success? We were responsible for financial stability and we utterly failed to take any avoiding action against the greatest financial crisis in our lifetimes&quot;. David Blanchflower said that, even as late as the summer of 2008, King did not even see the financial crisis coming.

In its review of Bank of England accountability, one of the major complaints of the Treasury Select Committee was the bank&#x27;s refusal to undertake an internal review of its performance during the financial crisis. Such a review would pose difficulties since evidence on how its most senior policymakers arrived at their decisions was destroyed as a matter of course. By contrast, the United States publishes the Federal Reserve&#x27;s deliberations with a five-year lag, which have provided &quot;the most detailed picture yet of how top officials at the central bank didn&#x27;t anticipate the storm about to hit the U.S. economy and the global financial system.&quot; As in the UK, the US central bank&#x27;s failure led to a new regulatory framework, the 2010 Dodd–Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

====Response to crisis====
King argued that when the financial crisis and bank meltdown hit in autumn 2008, he and other Western central bankers &quot;prevented a Great Depression&quot;, in part by cutting interest rates to virtually zero. &quot;The Economist&quot; agreed, saying that he &quot;has a point&quot;. A 2012 review of actions taken by Western central banks in the face of the crisis also supported King&#x27;s claim. The bank has faced criticism, however, for the pace of the rate cuts, which took five months from the beginning of October 2008 to get down from 5.0% to 0.5%, where they remained for several years.

After becoming only the second Bank of England governor to speak to the TUC in its 142-year history, King conceded that people were &quot;entitled to be angry&quot; about unemployment and the bank bailout.

King has been scathing about the banking sector since it crashed, especially its &quot;breathtaking&quot; £1 trillion bailout and its continuation of bonus awards in 2009, calling for a serious review of banking&#x27;s structure and regulation.

In a &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; interview in March 2011, King said banks had &quot;put profits before people&quot;, that failure to reform the sector could result in another financial crisis, and that traditional manufacturing industries have a more &quot;moral&quot; way of operating. In an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; in March 2012, he said that the banks are still in denial about the &quot;very real and wholly understandable&quot; anger that is felt at their behaviour, Bankers have not been happy with his excoriating views and insistence on avoiding moral hazard, but King insists that &quot;[m]arket discipline can&#x27;t apply to everyone except banks&quot;, pinpointing the banks&#x27; sense of grievance on their finding it &quot;very, very difficult to face up to the failure of their banking model&quot;.

With King&#x27;s term as governor ending in 2013, top UK banks have warned that unless a less &quot;hostile&quot; figure is found as a successor, they may feel it necessary to move abroad. On 26 November 2012, Mark Carney was named as King&#x27;s successor.

King had faced accusations of refusing funding to the Northern Rock Bank, precipitating a run on that bank, a situation not seen in the UK since 1914. King later said that it had been the chancellor, Alistair Darling, not he, who had the final word on refusing the necessary help to Northern Rock. In his review of King&#x27;s tenure as governor, &quot;Times&quot; journalist David Wighton wrote:

In his memoirs, Alistair Darling was critical of King for emphasising moral hazard—the doctrine of not saving the banks from the consequences of their own mistakes—instead of rescuing the banks by pumping money into them as the banking-system meltdown occurred in autumn 2008. Despite his refusal to give funding to the retail banks, he retained his job, and submitted in defence to a Treasury Select Committee (New York Times/Financial Times, 20 September 2007) that his actions were on the basis that the Bank of England was the &quot;lender of last resort&quot; but subsequently supported moves to provide funding to those banks which had been nationalised or partly nationalised.

===Political interventions===
It has been alleged that King&#x27;s Mansion House speech for 2009 helped to bolster the Conservatives during the approach to the general election by issuing high-profile criticisms. King called for the break-up of the country&#x27;s biggest banks, as well as arguing that, unless the bank was given more active, interventionist powers to ensure financial stability, it would be like a church: able to &quot;do no more than issue sermons or organise burials.&quot; King later advised a rebalancing of the economy, increased saving, and an &quot;elimination of the structural deficit&quot;. In November 2009, he told MPs that the then Labour government&#x27;s intention of halving the deficit over the next five years was insufficient. In May 2010, just days after the Coalition government was formed, King said he had spoken to Chancellor George Osborne and supported his plans to cut spending by a further £6 billion within the 2010–11 fiscal year. The Liberal Democrats did not need to be talked around to agreeing to the severity of the cuts.

In November 2010, it was revealed that some senior staff at the Bank of England (one of them was David Blanchflower) were uncomfortable with King&#x27;s endorsement of the government&#x27;s public spending cuts, accusing him of overstepping the boundary between monetary and fiscal policy. King&#x27;s support for the government&#x27;s cuts was in spite of concerns within the bank that cutting spending so rapidly could derail the UK&#x27;s nascent economic-recovery. These revelations led to accusations of King being a &quot;coalition courtier&quot; and of making &quot;excessively political&quot; interventions with regard to UK economic policy.

The accusations were given greater weight after the December 2010 WikiLeaks Cablegate. As a result of the WikiLeaks disclosures and David Laws&#x27; account of the Tory-Lib-Dem coalition-talks, King was asked by the Political and Constitutional Reform Select Committee to explain why he was seemingly cited in the talks as backing Tory plans to introduce spending cuts this year. King insisted to the committee that &quot;at no stage did I offer any advice on the composition of any measures designed to reduce the government deficit&quot;; the committee implicitly accepted King&#x27;s explanation of events as he is not even mentioned, let alone criticised, in their final report.

According to George Osborne, Gus O&#x27;Donnell made an offer to have King brief the Tories and Lib Dems during the Coalition&#x27;s formative talks; however, the parties suspected they &quot;knew what he was going to say and . . . also thought it was more appropriate for our Treasury spokesmen to talk to him&quot;.

King was criticised again in May 2012 on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s Today programme, on the day before an election, after he expressed approval of Coalition austerity measures.

In a speech to the European Parliament in Brussels in May 2011, King commented that the Bank of England was more concerned with the broader stability of the economy and banking sector than with inflation figures: &quot;The economic consequences of high-level indebtedness now would become more severe if rates were to rise. It is the main reason why interest rates are so low.&quot; With regard to Project Merlin, King was critical of Chancellor Osborne&#x27;s misleading figures, and correctly predicted in a &quot;light plausibility check&quot; that Merlin would be a failure. In March 2009, King said any plan for a second fiscal stimulus by the UK Government had to be done with caution.

In his Mansion House speech in June 2009, King criticised Chancellor Alistair Darling for resisting significant changes to the allocation of regulatory responsibilities between the FSA, the Treasury and the bank, which would have given the bank greater power to fulfil its role of ensuring economic stability.

In January 2012, King received a letter from the government&#x27;s former chief scientific adviser Sir David King, Zac Goldsmith, former environment minister John Gummer (and 17 others) warning of the possibility of a carbon bubble. King agreed to an evaluation of the matter.

The BoE&#x27;s Financial Policy Committee, established to identify emerging bubbles in the financial system, agreed in March 2012 to ask Parliament for new policy tools to be used to prevent another financial crisis. King said that the FPC narrowed its choice of instruments to three—the power to ensure banks have countercyclical capital buffers, the ability to force banks to hold more capital against exposure to specific sectors judged risky, and the power to set leverage ratios—because it will be important to explain to parliament and the wider public why it is or is not using them.

Late March 2019, he argued that the UK should leave without a deal in the wake of the UK&#x27;s decision to leave the European Union, arguing that the economic consequences would be limited, and that the UK was well-prepared after six months of preparations.

<text>Voluntaryism (, ; sometimes voluntarism ) is used to describe the philosophy of Auberon Herbert, and later that of the authors and supporters of &quot;The Voluntaryist&quot; magazine, which supports a voluntary-funded state (i.e. &quot;the Voluntary State&quot;), meaning a lack of coercion and force in matters such as taxation.

This is conventionally completed through a strict adherence to pacifism, civil rights, and either arbitration or some other mutually-agreed-upon court system between individuals.

As a term, &quot;voluntaryism&quot; was coined in this usage by Auberon Herbert in the 19th century and gained renewed use since the late 20th century, especially within libertarianism in the United States. Voluntaryist principal beliefs stem from the idea of natural rights, equality, non-coercion, and non-aggression. Despite his association with 20th century anarcho-capitalism Herbert rejected the idea of anarchy, hence its support for the state to enforce the law.

== History ==
=== Movements identifying as voluntaryist ===

==== 17th century ====

Precursors to the voluntaryist movement had a long tradition in the English-speaking world, at least as far back as the Leveller movement of mid-seventeenth century England. The Leveller spokesmen John Lilburne and Richard Overton who &quot;clashed with the Presbyterian puritans, who wanted to preserve a state-church with coercive powers and to deny liberty of worship to the puritan sects&quot;.

The Levellers were nonconformist in religion and advocated for the separation of church and state. The church to their way of thinking was a voluntary associating of equals, and furnished a theoretical and practical model for the civil state. If it was proper for their church congregations to be based on consent, then it was proper to apply the same principle of consent to its secular counterpart. For example, the Leveller &#x27;Large&#x27; Petition of 1647 contained a proposal &quot;that tythes and all other inforced maintenances, may be for ever abolished, and nothing in place thereof imposed, but that all Ministers may be paid only by those who voluntarily choose them, and contract with them for their labours.&quot; The Levellers also held to the idea of self-proprietorship.

==== 19th century ====
The &quot;educational voluntaryists&quot; wanted free trade in education, just as they supported free trade in corn or cotton. Their concern for &quot;liberty can scarcely be exaggerated&quot;. They believed that &quot;government would employ education for its own ends&quot; (teaching habits of obedience and indoctrination), and that government-controlled schools would ultimately teach children to rely on the State for all things. Baines, for example, noted that &quot;[w]e cannot violate the principles of liberty in regard to education without furnishing at once a precedent and inducement to violate them in regard to other matters&quot;. Baines conceded that the then current system of education (both private and charitable) had deficiencies, but he argued that freedom should not be abridged on that account. In asking whether freedom of the press should be compromised because we have bad newspapers, Baines replied that &quot;I maintain that Liberty is the chief cause of excellence; but it would cease to be Liberty if you proscribed everything inferior&quot;. The Congregational Board of Education and the Baptist Voluntary Education Society are usually given pride of place among the Voluntaryists.

In southern Africa, voluntaryism in religious matters was an important part of the liberal &quot;Responsible Government&quot; movement of the mid-19th century, along with support for multi-racial democracy and an opposition to British imperial control. The movement was driven by powerful local leaders such as Saul Solomon and John Molteno. When it briefly gained power, it disestablished the state-supported churches in 1875.

==== In the United States ====

There were at least two well-known Americans who espoused voluntaryist causes during the mid-19th century. Henry David Thoreau&#x27;s first brush with the law in his home state of Massachusetts came in 1838, when he turned twenty-one. The state demanded that he pay the one dollar ministerial tax in support of a clergyman, &quot;whose preaching my father attended but never I myself&quot;. When Thoreau refused to pay the tax, it was probably paid by one of his aunts. In order to avoid the ministerial tax in the future, Thoreau had to sign an affidavit attesting he was not a member of the church.

Thoreau&#x27;s overnight imprisonment for his failure to pay another municipal tax, the poll tax, to the town of Concord was recorded in his essay &quot;Resistance to Civil Government&quot;, first published in 1849. It is often referred to as &quot;On the Duty of Civil Disobedience&quot; because in it he concluded that government was dependent on the cooperation of its citizens. While he was not a thoroughly consistent voluntaryist, he did write that he wished never to &quot;rely on the protection of the state&quot; and that he refused to tender it his allegiance so long as it supported slavery. He distinguished himself from &quot;those who call[ed] themselves no-government men&quot;, writing that &quot;I ask for, not at once no government, but at once a better government&quot;. This has been interpreted as a gradualist, rather than minarchist, stance, given that he also opened his essay by stating his belief that &quot;government is best which governs not at all&quot;, a point that all voluntaryists heartily embrace.

Another one was Charles Lane. He was friendly with Amos Bronson Alcott, Ralph Waldo Emerson and Thoreau. Between January and June 1843, a series of nine letters he penned were published in such abolitionist&#x27;s papers as &quot;The Liberator&quot; and &quot;The Herald of Freedom&quot;. The title under which they were published was &quot;A Voluntary Political Government&quot; in which Lane described the state in terms of institutionalized violence and referred to its &quot;club law, its mere brigand right of a strong arm, [supported] by guns and bayonets&quot;. He saw the coercive state on par with &quot;forced&quot; Christianity, arguing: &quot;Everyone can see that the church is wrong when it comes to men with the [B]ible in one hand, and the sword in the other. Is it not equally diabolical for the state to do so?&quot; Lane believed that governmental rule was only tolerated by public opinion because the fact was not yet recognized that all the true purposes of the state could be carried out on the voluntary principle, just as churches could be sustained voluntarily. Reliance on the voluntary principle could only come about through &quot;kind, orderly, and moral means&quot; that were consistent with the totally voluntary society he was advocating, adding: &quot;Let us have a voluntary State as well as a voluntary Church, and we may possibly then have some claim to the appeallation of free men&quot;.

=== Modern-era voluntaryists ===

Although use of the label &quot;voluntaryist&quot; waned after the death of Auberon Herbert in 1906, its use was renewed in 1982, when George H. Smith, Wendy McElroy and Carl Watner began publishing &quot;The Voluntaryist&quot; magazine. Smith suggested use of the term to identify those libertarians who believed that political action and political parties (especially the Libertarian Party) were antithetical to their ideas. In their &quot;Statement of Purpose&quot; in &quot;Neither Bullets nor Ballots: Essays on Voluntaryism&quot; (1983), Watner, Smith and McElroy explained that voluntaryists were advocates of non-political strategies to achieve a free society, and effectively appropriated the term on behalf of right-libertarianism. They rejected electoral politics &quot;in theory and practice as incompatible with libertarian goals&quot; and argued that political methods invariably strengthen the legitimacy of coercive governments. In concluding their &quot;Statement of Purpose&quot;, they wrote: &quot;Voluntaryists seek instead to delegitimize the State through education, and we advocate the withdrawal of the cooperation and tacit consent on which state power ultimately depends&quot;.

<text>The following outline is provided as an overview of and topical guide to organic gardening and farming:

[[Organic farming]] – alternative agricultural system that relies on fertilizers of organic origin such as compost, manure, green manure, and bone meal and places emphasis on techniques such as crop rotation and companion planting. Biological pest control, mixed cropping and the fostering of insect predators are encouraged. Organic standards, in general, are intended to enable the use of naturally occurring compounds while restricting or strongly limiting the use of manufactured substances.

=== Principles of organic gardening and farming ===

* Principles of Organic Agriculture
*# &quot;The Principle of Health&quot; – &quot;Organic agriculture should sustain and enhance the health of soil, plant, animal and human as one and indivisible.&quot;
*# &quot;The Principle of Ecology&quot; – &quot;Organic agriculture should be based on living ecological systems and cycles, work with them, emulate them and help sustain them.&quot;
*# &quot;The Principle of Fairness&quot; – &quot;Organic agriculture should build on relationships that ensure fairness with regard to the common environment and life opportunities.&quot;
*# &quot;The Principle of Care&quot; – &quot;Organic agriculture should be managed in a precautionary and responsible manner to protect the health and well being of current and future generations and the environment.&quot;

<text>Taja Kramberger (born 11 September 1970, Ljubljana, Slovenia) is a Slovenian poet, translator, essayist and historical anthropologist from Slovenia. She lives in France.

== Biography ==

=== Early life and education ===
Kramberger was born in Ljubljana, Slovenia. Kramberger spent her childhood (between the ages of four and eleven) in the seaside bilingual old-Venetian town of Koper near Trieste. She finished four years of primary school there (Pinko Tomažič Primary School), and then moved with her family to Ljubljana. There she completed primary and secondary school at Bežigrad Grammar School. 

Kramberger completed undergraduate studies in history at the University of Ljubljana. She obtained her PhD in 2009 in history/historical anthropology at the University of Primorska with the thesis &quot;Memory and Remembrance. Historical Anthropology of the Canonized Reception&quot;.

=== Academic career ===
Kramberger took a position as a postgraduate researcher at the Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis (ISH) in Ljubljana. There she founded the anthropological journal &quot;Monitor ISH&quot;. She moved to Koper-Capodistria and was involved in establishing the historical anthropology program from undergraduate to postgraduate level in the Department of Anthropology at the University of Primorska.

Besides in literature and historical anthropology, Kramberger continues to be engaged in civil actions, and confrontations against clientelism and corruption in the scientific domain in Slovenia. In May 2000, together with Sabina Mihelj, she co-directed a large public manifestation with a cultural program in Ljubljana against the corrupted politics of the Ministry of Science and Technology. In 2004, she fought against the illegal takeover of the institution ISH. She insisted on publishing all crucial documents, personal testimonies of the takeover, and reflections of the events from the perspective of the people who finally left the ISH from indignation with their ex-colleagues. In 2010 she again was an active militant against the total neoliberalization, venalization, and degradation of the university as an autonomous institution and against the decomposition of its fundamental scientific disciplines at the Faculty of Human Sciences Koper, University of Primorska.

The same regressive social changes occurred simultaneously also in the literary field in Slovenia. In 2004 writer and translator Iztok Osojnik, as a director of the Vilenica International Literary Festival, was ousted from the position of Vilenica&#x27;s director of the Slovene Writers&#x27; Association (SWA). She was among the tiny minority who supported him against mostly state-implemented and state-maintained elite and all-regime-supported writers and authors. Meanwhile the majority of writers remained quiet – also around two then ardently debated subjects of growing nationalism and humiliation of women writers and translators in the frames of the SWA. After that Kramberger distanced herself from the SWA network. She writes and translates literature by her own vocation and ethical standards.

Since living in France (from 2012) she also stepped out of the SWA with an open letter in December 2014 (denied by all Slovene mass-media and suppressed by the president of the SWA) representing only herself and her &quot;apatrid chair&quot; in Paris. As she writes in one of her poems: &quot;Nothing remains./ But life is still here,/ and it speaks the guerrilla alphabet. (...) I am without home,/ I belong to / the invisible community of the banished./ Remove the ethnic adjective / from my name.&quot;

She was an initiator and for ten years editor-in-chief of &quot;Monitor ISH-Review of Humanities and Social Sciences&quot; (2001–2003), in 2004 renamed to &quot;Monitor ZSA-Review for Historical, Social and Other Anthropologies&quot; (2004–2010). Between 2004 and 2007 she was president of the TROPOS-Association for Historical, Social and Other Anthropologies and for Cultural Activities (Ljubljana, Slovenia).

She publishes monographs in the areas of epistemology of social sciences and historiography, history and historical anthropology of various subjects for the period from the 18th to mid-20th centuries. She is also an internationally acclaimed writer. Kramberger writes literary books, literary studies and essays. She translates texts from all these fields from English, French, Italian, and Spanish into Slovenian.

Kramberger earned scientific and literary fellowships abroad at the École des hautes études en sciences sociales and in Paris, at in Budapest, from in Ottensheim, Austria, from in Canada. She also publishes scientific and literary articles, essays and translations. She participates in international scientific and literary conferences, research projects, and is a member of professional associations and organizations. Kramberger has helped to organize international conferences, for example &quot;Territorial and Imaginary Frontiers and Identities from Antiquity until Today&quot;, &quot;accent on Balkans&quot; (2002 in Ljubljana) and the international scientific conference of the Francophonie (AUF) titled &quot;/History of Oblivion&quot; (2008 in Koper).

Her research fields are: epistemology of historiography and social sciences, historical anthropology, contemporary history from the Enlightenment to the mid-20th century, transmission and politics of memory/oblivion, intellectual history and cultural transfers in Europe, anti-intellectualism, dimensions and representations of the Dreyfus Affair in Slovenian social space and in Trieste, mechanisms of social exclusion, extermination, genocide and Shoah/Holocaust studies, anthropology of sex and gender, constitution of (national and transnational) literary fields in Europe in the 19th and 20th centuries, studies of province and provincialism as a specific socio-historical phenomenon.

Since October 2012 she has lived in France together with her husband Drago Braco Rotar, professor of sociology, historical anthropology, translator and a renowned public intellectual in Slovenia and Yugoslavia – who during the 1980s and early 1900s established many key institutions in Slovenia and led them for years, including the now classical &quot;green&quot; translation edition Studia humanitatis, the first private postgraduate school ISH-Institutum Studiorum Humanitatis, Faculty of Graduate Studies in Human Sciences, where he designed and launched the program of historical anthropology).

== History, historical anthropology ==

=== Conceptualization of the collective memory and its distinctions from remembrance and history ===

Kramberger introduced collective memory studies based on the into Slovenian universities. 

In 2000–2001, she wrote an extensive introduction to Maurice Halbwachs&#x27; Slovenian translation of . In this introduction, she pointed out the conceptual difference between &quot;memory&quot; () and &quot;remembrance&quot; (). The editorial board of the Slovene Halbwachs translation had unilaterally, despite both the translator (Rotar) and the introductory writer (Kramberger) protesting, decided to translate both and into , &quot;which means remembrance&quot;. Despite this, some researchers, including Marija Jurič Pahor and Samuel Friškič, were able to grasp this difference, which was also related &quot;memory&quot; and &quot;history&quot;.

=== Critical reflexivity of the Slovenian historiography ===
Kramberger has also started with the extensive categorical critical reflexivity in the field of history in Slovenia, and has released many angry reactions in the history field, but mostly she left the historians – unable to confront their own shadows from the past – silenced. Although polemic, which would definitely clarify the discipline&#x27;s past erratic wanderings and amnesias and an almost total theoretic oblivion in the field of history in Slovenia, is not a usual tool of scientific communication in these regions, it is nevertheless clear that Kramberger has opened (among some other researchers, such as Drago Braco Rotar, Rastko Močnik, Maja Breznik, Lev Centrih, Primož Krašovec, in a small, theoretically much less pertinent part also Marta Verginella and Oto Luthar) an important segment of future debates, which are needed to elucidate some of the neglected and spontaneously transmitted chapters of the Slovenian (distinctly ethnocentric and Sonderweg) history.

=== Representations and aspects of the Dreyfus Affair in the Slovenophone World ===

Kramberger was also the first Slovenian historian to write about various dimensions and echoes of the Dreyfus Affair in the Slovenian social space during the affair and later. She has opened up a complex theme of anti-Semitism neglected and only partially elucidated in the Slovene history. She connected this exclusive phenomenon to the categories and imaginary and specific discursive practices. Introducing a research seminar at the undergraduate level, she exposed how anti-Semitic discursive formations can mobilize people and public opinion in countries with few Jewish people. She demonstrated how, even in social spaces with a scarce population of Jews, strong mechanisms of social exclusion nonetheless operate smoothly – often even more aggressively and viscerally than in bigger countries. In the framework of this theme she directed – together with her students in 2007–2008 and 2008–2009 – an ample exhibition on the Dreyfus Affair (1894–1906), showing its entangled and differentiated European , its highly important civic extensions, and its specific reception in the continental Centro-European spaces of Slovenia and Trieste. The latter two were mostly based on spontaneous, normalized and career-promising anti-Semitism, though not at all innocuous. The exhibitions were set up and shown to the public in Koper (2008), Trieste (2009), Maribor (2010) and Murska Sobota (2011).

Kramberger has written numerous critical articles on various aspects of Slovenian history and cultural life, but also on broader European history and culture, e.g. the Spanish Civil War, different models of the Enlightenment in Europe and the recurrent Enlightenment features in the works of Anton Tomaž Linhart, epistemic divergence between the Enlightenment&#x27;s and Historismus&#x27;s paradigms of historiography, anthropology of translation, the history of university and the formation of university habitus Habitus, literary and cultural fields Pierre Bourdieu ( in the 1930s in Slovenia (by then partially covered by the administrative unit of Dravska Banovina) and on the role of women in the constitution of these fields, etc. For years lecturing a course on social and anthropological aspects of women&#x27;s history and gender constructions, she translated Michelle Perrot&#x27;s classic work &quot;Women or the Silences of History&quot; into Slovenian.

=== Bourdieuian studies in the frames of Slovenia ===

She is partly connected to the Bourdieuian perspective and apparatus in social sciences. She has written about Pierre Bourdieu and Loïc Wacquant, translated some of their texts (as a guest editor of the journal Družboslovne razprave, no. 43, 2003), and in 2006 edited a monograph titled &quot;Principles of Reflexive Social Science and for a Critical Investigation of Symbolic Dominations&quot; () (in Slovenian, together with Drago Braco Rotar). She held lectures – among other subjects – on Bourdieuian approach, instrumentarium and methodology at the University of Primorska in Koper.

== Literature ==

=== Poetry ===

She has published eight books of poetry. Her poems have been translated in more than twenty-five languages and published in different literary journals, anthologies in Slovenia and abroad. Book selections of her poetry came out in Hungarian (, , Pécs, , 2008, ) and Croatian (, Naklada Lara, Zagreb, 2008, tr. Ksenija Premur, ). She has been an invited guest of around 100 international literary meetings and festivals in Europe (Belgium, England, Lithuania, Portugal, Croatia, Latvia, France, Hungary, Italy, Austria, Germany, Croatia, North Macedonia, France, Lithuania, Finland, Ireland, etc.) and Canada (Quebec and Ontario).

Kramberger, received the Veronika Award (2007) for the best poetry collection of 2006.

=== Translations, organizations of cultural events ===
Next to numerous translated poems and some prose texts of other writers published in journals, she translated into Slovene a poetry book by Italian poet Michele Obit (, ZTT EST, Trieste, 2001, ), a selection of poetry by Argentinian poet Roberto Juarroz for the book (&quot;Vertical Poetry&quot; – with her introduction, ŠZ, Ljubljana, 2006, ), a book by Gao Xingjian (/&quot;Buying a Fishing Rod for My Grandfather&quot;, 1986–1990, from French together with Drago Braco Rotar) (Didakta, Radovljica, 2001, ), a book of poetry written by Lithuanian poet Neringa Abrutyte (, CSK, Aleph, Ljubljana, 2004, ) and a book of fairy tales for kids by Lucy Coats (/&quot;Atticus the Storyteller&quot;, 2004; MK, Ljubljana, 2004, reprinted in 2009, ).

In 2002, Kramberger directed and coordinated an international project of poets and translators (22 from 10 countries), / &quot;Different Languages&quot; / / , in the seaside town of Ankaran near Koper in Slovenia. The project established a series of translation workshops between 1999 and 2004 in Central Europe (Bulgaria, Hungary, Slovenia, Italy and Austria). In 2004 the publication &quot;/&quot; &quot;/ Different Languages /&quot; in 10 languages came out of the project. It was published by the Edition Libris Koper and edited by Kramberger and Gašper Malej. Anne Talvaz, a French writer and translator, and Bulgarian translator Stefka Hrusanova have broadened the scope of the workshop and organized presentations in Spain (Barcelona) and Italy (Milan) in 2008 and 2010.

Another large international project Kramberger conducted in 2006 was a Slovenian segment of the international project &quot;Sealines&quot; / / , which through one-month literary residences in six European bilingual ports (Cardiff, Galway, Helsinki, Koper, Riga, and Valletta) connected writers from six European states. The project was supported by the program Culture 2000 of the European Union, and was led by the LAF – Literature Across Frontiers office in UK, Manchester. In Slovenia it was executed by the Association Tropos and its then-president Kramberger.

From 2007 to 2009, Kramberger was a president of the Collegium artium (CA) – an association of teachers and students at the Faculty of Human Sciences Koper, University of Primorska, aimed at organizing different cultural and social events at the faculty (literary readings, music concerts, theater and film performances, round tables, conferences, commemorations, exhibitions of figurative arts, other specialized exhibitions etc.). In the frames of the institution CA more than 150 cultural events took place in less than two years.

<doc id="242165" wikidata="Q436659" url="?curid=242165" title="Tony Hart">
<text>Norman Antony Hart (15 October 1925 – 18 January 2009) was an English artist best known for his work in educating children in art through his role as a children&#x27;s television presenter.

Hart initially served as an officer in a Gurkha regiment until the start of Indian independence. After this he became involved in children&#x27;s television from the 1950s, working on the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Blue Peter&quot; for a few years before fronting a series of children&#x27;s art programmes, including &quot;Vision On&quot;, &quot;Take Hart&quot; and &quot;Hartbeat&quot;.

Hart&#x27;s contributions to children&#x27;s television include the design of the ship logo used by &quot;Blue Peter&quot; and the show&#x27;s badges, and the animated character of Morph, who appeared beside him on his programmes following his introduction in the 1970s.

==Early life==
Tony Hart was born in Hastings Road, Maidstone in Kent. He was interested in drawing from an early age. He attended All Saints, Margaret Street Resident Choir School and then Clayesmore School in Iwerne Minster, Dorset, where art was his best subject.

==Military service==
Hart left school in 1943 and wanted to join the Royal Air Force, but as he would have been unable to fly owing to slightly deficient eyesight, he followed in his father’s footsteps and joined the British Indian Army instead where he gained an officers&#x27; commission in the 1st Gurkha Rifles, serving from 1943 to 1947. His military career was cut short, however, when he was told that lower-ranked British officers would be replaced by Indian officers following Indian independence, so he decided to return to civilian life. The outbreak of the Korean War (25 June 1950) saw him being re-commissioned in the Territorial Army, attached to the Royal Artillery, from 23 November 1948 to 1 July 1950.

==Career==

After being demobilised, Hart decided to become a professional artist and studied at Maidstone College of Art, which later became Kent Institute of Art &amp; Design (and is now the Maidstone campus of the University for the Creative Arts). He graduated in 1950 and, after working as a display artist in a London store, became a freelance artist.

Hart&#x27;s break into broadcast television came in 1952, after his brother persuaded him to attend a party where he met a BBC children&#x27;s television producer. After an interview in which Hart drew a fish on a napkin while the producer was looking for paper, Hart became resident artist on the &quot;Saturday Special&quot; programme. Subsequent television shows included &quot;Playbox&quot; (1954–59), &quot;Tich and Quackers&quot; (1963-), &quot;Vision On&quot; (1964–76), &quot;Take Hart&quot; (1977–83), &quot;Hartbeat&quot; (1984–93), &quot;Artbox Bunch&quot; (1995–96) and &quot;Smart Hart&quot; (1999–2000). From the 1970s, he often appeared alongside the animated Plasticine stop-motion character Morph, created by Peter Lord of Aardman Animations.

Hart was a regular face on the BBC children&#x27;s programme &quot;Blue Peter&quot; in the 1950s and presented a number of programmes in 1959. Richard Marson&#x27;s book &quot;Blue Peter: Inside the Archives&quot; lists Hart as a presenter in November 1959 but he is not officially listed as a host. As well as demonstrating small-scale projects (the type that viewers might be able to do) Hart also created large-scale artworks on the television studio floor, and even used beaches and other open spaces as &#x27;canvases&#x27;.

A regular feature of Hart&#x27;s programmes was The Gallery, which displayed artworks (paintings, drawings and collages) sent in by young viewers. One of the pieces of easy-listening vibraphone music accompanying this feature—&quot;Left Bank Two&quot;, composed by Wayne Hill and performed by The Noveltones—has passed into British TV theme lore. This was first introduced in the show &quot;Vision On&quot;.

Hart also created the original design for the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; badge, also used as the programme&#x27;s logo. He originally asked for his fee to be paid as a royalty of 1d (one pre-decimalisation penny) for each badge made, but was offered a flat fee of £100 (equivalent to £3,061.58 at January 2020 rates). The badges are famous throughout the United Kingdom and have been coveted by successive generations of &quot;Blue Peter&quot; viewers. The ink and watercolour galleon, believed to be the inspiration for the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; logo and badge, was originally drawn by Hart for &quot;Hooray for Humpty-Dumpty&quot; on &quot;Saturday Special&quot;, in 1952.

Hart received two BAFTA awards. His first, for Best Children&#x27;s Educational Programme, came in 1984 for &quot;Take Hart&quot;, and he was given a Lifetime Achievement Award in 1998. He retired from regular TV work in 2001.

==Personal life==
Hart met his wife, Jean Skingle, while working in television; they married in 1953. They were married for fifty years until she died in 2003. They had a daughter together.

==Death==
On 28 December 2006, it was announced during the reunion programme &quot;It Started with Swap Shop&quot; that Hart was in poor health, though this was not elaborated upon until an interview with &quot;The Times&quot; published on 30 September 2008, revealing that two strokes had robbed him of the use of his hands and left him unable to draw. He described this as &quot;the greatest cross I have to bear&quot;. Hart died peacefully on 18 January 2009 at the age of 83.

Hart&#x27;s funeral took place in the village of Shamley Green, where he had lived for more than forty years and he was buried in the churchyard of Christ Church.

===Tributes===
On 1 March 2009 a flash mob, organised through Facebook, paid tribute to Hart with around two hundred Morph figures displayed outside the Tate Modern art gallery. Hart&#x27;s daughter, Carolyn Ross, attended and judged the &quot;Best Morph in Show&quot;.

A memorial plaque is displayed in Hart&#x27;s birthplace, the town of Maidstone, where he studied art at the town&#x27;s art college. The plaque was unveiled by his daughter in May 2009 at the Hazlitt Arts Centre.

In September 2010 &quot;Tony Hart: A Portrait of My Dad&quot;, an affectionate biography of Hart by his daughter Carolyn, was published by John Blake Publishing.

In February 2015 a wave of tributes (followed by corrections) appeared on social media sites over a period of two days, when an individual mistakenly read a 2009 report of Hart&#x27;s death and, missing the dateline, published it as news on Facebook, from which it was later transferred to Twitter. Many social media posters hyperlinked to an article in &quot;The Guardian&quot;. The newspaper published a graph of the number of readers referred to its article for the period. Aardman Animations used its Twitter account, in the name of Morph, to point to a tribute to Hart (a portrait of him being hung on a wall) that was included in the last episode of its forthcoming new set of episodes for the &quot;Morph&quot; television series.

In August 2021, a mural at Maidstone bus station was created, featuring Tony Hart and his sidekick Morph.

==Legacy==
In 2021 a collection of Hart&#x27;s drawings from the estate of his agent were put up for auction. The collection, which included a sketch of a galleon, created for the 1952 &quot;Humpty Dumpty&quot; story and subsequently used by Hart as the basis for the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; logo, was thought likely to sell for around £20,000. The 65-lot auction took place on 29 January.

<text>Joseph Kessel (10 February 1898 – 23 July 1979), also known as &quot;Jef&quot;, was a French journalist and novelist. He was a member of the Académie française and Grand Officer of the Legion of Honour.

==Biography==
Kessel was born to a Jewish family in Villa Clara, Entre Ríos, Argentina, because of the constant journeys of his father, a Litvak physician. From 1905 to 1908, Joseph Kessel lived the first years of his childhood in Orenburg, Russia, before the family moved to France in 1908. He studied in &quot;lycée Masséna&quot;, Nice and lycée Louis-le-Grand, Paris and took part in the First World War as an aviator. He was also an aviator during the Second World War, in the Free French (342 Squadron RAF) with RAF Bomber Command, with Romain Gary, who was also a talented French novelist.

Kessel wrote several novels and books that were later represented in the cinema, notably &quot;Belle de Jour&quot; (by Luis Buñuel in 1967) and &quot;L&#x27;armée des ombres&quot; (Army of Shadows) (by Jean-Pierre Melville in 1969). In 1943 he and his nephew Maurice Druon translated Anna Marly&#x27;s song &quot;Chant des Partisans&quot; into French from its original Russian. The song became one of the anthems of Free French Forces during the Second World War.

Kessel was elected to the &quot;Académie française&quot; in 1962 and died on 23 July 1979 in Avernes, Val-d&#x27;Oise of a ruptured aneurysm. He is buried in Paris in the Cimetière du Montparnasse. The Joseph-Kessel Prize (Prix Joseph Kessel) is a prestigious prize in French language literature, given to &quot;a book of a high literary value written in French&quot;. The jury counts or has counted among its members Tahar Ben Jelloun, Jean-Marie Drot, Michèle Kahn, Pierre Haski, Gilles Lapouge, Michel Le Bris, Érik Orsenna, Patrick Rambaud, Jean-Christophe Rufin, André Velter and Olivier Weber.

<doc id="242172" wikidata="Q1141751" url="?curid=242172" title="Crown (British coin)">
<text>The crown was a denomination of sterling coinage worth a quarter of one pound (fiveshillings, or 60 (old) pence). The crown was first issued during the reign of Edward VI, as part of the coinage of the Kingdom of England.

Always a heavy silver coin weighing around one ounce, during the 19th and 20th centuries the crown declined from being a real means of exchange to being a coin rarely spent, and minted for commemorative purposes only. Unlike in some territories of the British Empire (such as Jamaica), in the UK the crown was never replaced as circulating currency by a five-shilling banknote.

&quot;Decimal&quot; crowns were minted a few times after decimalisation of the British currency in 1971, initially with a nominal value of 25 (new) pence. However, commemorative crowns issued since 1990 have a face value of five pounds.

==History==
The coin&#x27;s origins lie in the English silver crown, one of many silver coins that appeared in various countries from the 16th century onwards (most famously the Spanish piece of eight), all of similar size and weight (approx 38mm diameter, 25g fine silver) and thus interchangeable in international trade. The Kingdom of England also minted gold Crowns until early in the reign of Charles II.

The dies for all gold and silver coins of Queen Anne and King George I were engraved by John Croker, a migrant originally from Dresden in the Duchy of Saxony.

The British silver crown was always a large coin, and from the 19th century it did not circulate well. However, crowns were usually struck in a new monarch&#x27;s coronation year, from George IV to Elizabeth II in 1953, with the exceptions of George V and Edward VIII.
The King George V &quot;wreath&quot; crowns struck from 1927 until 1936 (excluding 1935 when the more common &quot;rocking horse&quot; crown was minted to commemorate the King&#x27;s Silver Jubilee) depict a wreath on the reverse of the coin and were struck in very low numbers. Generally struck late in the year and intended to be purchased as Christmas gifts, they were generally kept rather than circulated. The 1927 &quot;wreath&quot; crowns were struck as proofs only (15,030 minted) and the 1934 coin had a mintage of just 932.

With their large size, many of the later coins were primarily commemoratives. The 1951 issue was for the Festival of Britain, and was only struck in proof condition. The 1953 crown was issued to celebrate the Coronation of Queen Elizabeth II, while the 1960 issue (which carried the same reverse design as the previous crown in 1953) commemorated the British Exhibition in New York. The 1965 issue carried the image of Winston Churchill on the reverse. According to the Standard Catalogue of coins, 19,640,000 of this coin were minted, although intended as collectable pieces the large mintage and lack of precious metal content means these coins are effectively worthless today. Production of the Churchill crown began on 11 October 1965, and stopped in the summer of 1966.

The crown coin was nicknamed the &quot;dollar&quot;. In 1940, an agreement with the US pegged the Pound sterling to the US dollar at a rate of £1 = US$4.03. This meaning of &quot;dollar&quot; is not to be confused with the British trade dollar that circulated in East Asia.

In 2014, a new world record price was achieved for a milled silver crown. The coin was unique, issued as a pattern by engraver Thomas Simon in 1663 and nicknamed the &quot;Reddite Crown&quot;. It was presented to Charles II as the new crown piece, but ultimately rejected in favour of the Roettiers Brothers&#x27; design. Auctioneers Spink &amp; Son of London sold the coin on 27 March 2014 for £396,000 including commission.

All pre-decimal crowns from 1818 on remain legal tender with a face value of 25p.

===Decimal crowns===
After decimalisation on 15 February 1971, the 25-pence coin was introduced as a replacement for the crown as a commemorative coin. These were legal tender and were made with large mintages.

Further issues continued to be minted, initially with a value of twenty-five pence (with no face value shown). From 1990, the face value of new crown coins was raised to five pounds.


==Changing values==
The legal tender value of the crown remained as five shillings from 1544 to 1965. However, for most of this period there was no denominational designation or &quot;face value&quot; &quot;mark&quot; of value displayed on the coin. From 1927 to 1939, the word &quot;CROWN&quot; appears, and from 1951 to 1960 this was changed to &quot;FIVE SHILLINGS&quot;. Coins minted since 1818 remain legal tender with a face value of 25 pence.

Although all &quot;normal&quot; issues since 1951 have been composed of cupro-nickel, special proof versions have been produced for sale to collectors, and as gift items, in silver, gold, and occasionally platinum.

The fact that gold £5 crowns are now produced means that there are two different strains of five pound gold coins, namely crowns and what are now termed &quot;quintuple sovereigns&quot; for want of a more concise term.

Numismatically, the term &quot;crown-sized&quot; is used generically to describe large silver or cupro-nickel coins of about 40 mm in diameter. Most Commonwealth countries still issue crown-sized coins for sale to collectors.

New Zealand&#x27;s original fifty-cent pieces, and Australia&#x27;s previously round but now dodecagonal fifty-cent piece, although valued at five shillings in predecimal accounting, are all smaller than the standard silver crown pieces issued by those countries (and the UK). They were in fact similarly sized to the predecimal half crown (worth two shillings and sixpence).

==Composition==
For silver crowns, the grade of silver adhered to the long-standing standard (established in the 12th century by Henry II) – the Sterling Silver standard of 92.5% silver and 7.5% copper. This was a harder-wearing alloy, yet it was still a rather high grade of silver. It went some way towards discouraging the practice of &quot;clipping&quot;, though this practice was further discouraged and largely eliminated with the introduction of the milled edge seen on coins today.

In a debasement process which took effect in 1920, the silver content of all British coins was reduced from 92.5% to 50%, with a portion of the remainder consisting of manganese, which caused the coins to tarnish to a very dark colour after they had been in circulation for a significant period. Silver was eliminated altogether in 1947, with the move to a composition of cupro-nickel – except for proof issues, which returned to the pre-1920 92.5% silver composition.

Since the Great Recoinage of 1816, a crown has, as a general rule, had a diameter of , and weighed 28.276 grams (defined as  troy ounce).

==Modern mintages==
*The specifications for composition refer to the standard circulation versions. Proof versions continue to be minted in Sterling silver.

==Quarter sovereign==
In 1853, the Royal Mint had produced two patterns for a gold 5-shilling coin for circulation use, one denominated as five shillings and the other as a quarter sovereign, but this coin never went into production, in part due to concerns about the small size of the coin and likely wear in circulation. The quarter sovereign was introduced in 2009 as a bullion coin.

<text>The Museum Island () is a museum complex on the northern part of Spree Island in the historic heart of Berlin, Germany. It is one of the capital&#x27;s most visited sights and one of the most important museum sites in Europe. Originally built from 1830 to 1930, initially by order of the Prussian Kings, according to plans by five architects, the Museum Island was designated a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999 because of its testimony to the architectural and cultural development of museums in the 19th and 20th centuries. It consists of the Altes Museum, the Neues Museum, the Alte Nationalgalerie, the Bode-Museum and the Pergamonmuseum. As the Museum Island designation includes all of Spree Island north of the Karl Liebknecht Boulevard, the historic Berlin Cathedral is also located there, next to the open Lustgarten park. To the south of Liebknecht Boulevard, the reconstructed Berlin Palace houses the Humboldt Forum museum and opened in 2020. Also adjacent, across the west branch of the Spree is the German Historical Museum. Since German reunification, the Museum Island has been rebuilt and extended according to a master plan. In 2019, a new visitor center and art gallery, the James Simon Gallery (by a sixth architect), was opened within the Museum Island heritage site.

==Overview==
The Museum Island is so-called for the complex of internationally significant museums, all part of the Berlin State Museums, that occupy the Spree island&#x27;s northern part. In 1999, the museum complex was added to the UNESCO list of World Heritage Sites because of its unique testimony to the evolution of museums as a social and cultural phenomena and the corresponding development of museum architecture.

*The Altes Museum (Old Museum) named as the &quot;Königliches Museum&quot; when it was built on 3 August 1830, until it was renamed in 1841. The museum was completed on the orders of Karl Friedrich Schinkel.
*The Neues Museum (New Museum) finished in 1859 according to plans by Friedrich August Stüler, a student of Schinkel. Destroyed in World War II, it was rebuilt under the direction of David Chipperfield for the Egyptian Museum of Berlin and re-opened in 2009.
*The Alte Nationalgalerie (Old National Gallery) completed in 1876, also according to designs by Friedrich August Stüler, to host a collection of 19th-century art donated by banker Joachim H. W. Wagener
*The Bode Museum on the island&#x27;s northern tip, opened in 1904 and then called &quot;Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum&quot;. It exhibits the sculpture collections and late Antique and Byzantine art.
*The Pergamon Museum, constructed from 1910 to 1930, contains multiple reconstructed immense and historically significant buildings such as the Pergamon Altar and the Ishtar Gate of Babylon.
*The Berliner Dom while not itself a museum is an historically important church, which contains the dynastic crypt of the House of Hohenzollern
*The Lustgarten park
*The James Simon Gallery, visitors center, opened 2019, was erected on the site of the former 19th century &quot;Packhof&quot; (service building wearhouse) a Schinkel designed structure which had been demolished in 1938.

Nearby:
*The Humboldt Forum opened in late 2020 in the reconstructed Berlin Palace opposite the Berliner Dom and Lustgarten park, and incorporated the Ethnological Museum of Berlin and the Museum of Asian Art; both are successor institutions of the Ancient Prussian Art Chamber, which was also located in the Berlin Palace and which was established in the mid 16th century. In late 2022, the opening of the eastern wing, the last section of the Humboldt Forum museum, meant the Humboldt Forum museum was finally completed.
*German Historical Museum, in the historic Zeughaus, and including an extension by I. M. Pei, is located opposite Lustgarten park, just off the Island, along the Unter den Linden.

==History==
A first exhibition hall was erected in 1797 at the suggestion of the archaeologist Aloys Hirt. In 1822, Schinkel designed the plans for the Altes Museum to house the royal Antikensammlung, the arrangement of the collection was overseen by Wilhelm von Humboldt. The island, originally a residential area, was dedicated to &quot;art and science&quot; by King Frederick William IV of Prussia in 1841. Further extended under succeeding Prussian kings, the museum&#x27;s collections of art and archeology were turned into a public foundation after 1918. They are today maintained by the Berlin State Museums branch of the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation.

Museum Island further comprises the Lustgarten park and the Berlin Cathedral. Between the Bode and Pergamon Museums it is crossed by the Stadtbahn railway viaduct. The adjacent territory to the south is the site of the former royal and imperial Berlin Palace and the Palace of the Republic.

The Prussian collections became separated during the Cold War during the division of the city, but were reunited after German reunification, with the exception of some art and artifacts removed after World War II by Allied troops. These include the Priam&#x27;s Treasure, also called &quot;the gold of Troy&quot;, excavated by Heinrich Schliemann in 1873, then smuggled out of Turkey to Berlin and smuggled out of Germany to Moscow. Today it is kept at the Pushkin Museum in Moscow.

As for the city&#x27;s major museums, it took much of the 1990s for a consensus to emerge that Museum Island&#x27;s buildings should be restored and modernized, with General Director Wolf-Dieter Dube&#x27;s cautious plan for their use finally approved in January 1999. Then, six months later, Peter-Klaus Schuster took over and set in motion a far more ambitious program intended to turn Museum Island into a &quot;Louvre on the Spree&quot;. The federal government pledged $20 million a year through 2010 for projects to enhance Berlin&#x27;s prestige and UNESCO declared the island a World Heritage Site.

The contents of the museums were decided on as follows: The Pergamon, with the Greek altar that gives it its name, retained much of its collection and was defined as a museum of ancient architecture. The Neues Museum presented archaeological objects as well as Egyptian and Etruscan sculptures, including the renowned bust of Queen Nefertiti. The Altes Museum, the oldest on the island, displayed Greek and Roman art objects on its first floor and hold exhibitions on its second floor. The Bode Museum&#x27;s paintings went from Late Byzantine to 1800. And, as now, the Alte Nationalgalerie will cover the 19th century. Once this process is completed, perhaps by 2020, the Gemäldegalerie&#x27;s painting collection will be transferred to the Bode, and a new annex, and Museum Island will present all art from the ancient civilizations to 1900. The James Simon Gallery, a $157 million visitors&#x27; center designed by the British architect David Chipperfield, completed construction in 2019 and is located beside the Neues Museum. It is linked to the Neues, Altes, Pergamon and Bode Museums by an underground passageway decorated with archaeological objects.

Once the Museum Island Master Plan is completed, the so-called Archaeological Promenade will connect four of the five museums on the Museum Island. The Promenade will begin at the Old Museum in the south, lead through the New Museum and the Pergamon Museum and end at the Bode Museum, located at the northern tip of the Island. Before World War II, these museums were connected by bridge passages above ground; they were destroyed due to the effects of the war. There have never been plans to rebuild them; instead, the central courts of individual museums will be lowered, which has already been done in the Bode Museum and in the New Museum. They will be connected by subterranean galleries. In a way, this archaeological promenade can be regarded as the sixth museum in the Island, because it is devised not only as a connecting corridor but also as a strung-out exhibition room for interdisciplinary presentations. The Archaeological Promenade may be characterized as a cross-total of the collections that are shown separately (in accordance with cultural regions, epochs, and art genres) in the individual museums of the Island. The Archaeological Promenade will address multi-focus topics that have occupied the human mind irrespective of time and cultural region, be it a question of life after death or issues of beauty and other topics.

Museum Island is referenced in the song &quot;On the Museum Island&quot; by folk artist Emmy the Great.

The southern section of the island, south of Gertraudenstraße, is commonly referred to as Fischerinsel (Fisher Island) and is the site of a high-rise apartment development built when Mitte was part of East Berlin.

<doc id="242178" wikidata="Q164699" url="?curid=242178" title="Adolf von Harnack">
<text>Carl Gustav Adolf von Harnack (born Harnack; 7 May 1851 – 10 June 1930) was a Baltic German Lutheran theologian and prominent Church historian. He produced many religious publications from 1873 to 1912 (in which he is sometimes credited as Adolf Harnack). He was ennobled (with the addition of von to his name) in 1914.

Harnack traced the influence of Hellenistic philosophy on early Christian writings and called on Christians to question the authenticity of doctrines that arose in the early Christian church. He rejected the historicity of the Gospel of John in favor of the Synoptic Gospels, criticized the Apostles&#x27; Creed, and promoted the Social Gospel.

In the 19th century, higher criticism flourished in Germany, establishing the historical-critical method as an academic standard for interpreting the Bible and understanding the historical Jesus . Harnack&#x27;s work is part of a reaction to Tübingen, and represents a reappraisal of tradition.

Besides his theological activities, Harnack was a distinguished organizer of sciences. He played an important role in the foundation of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft and became its first president.

==Biography==
He was born at Dorpat (today Tartu) in Livonia (then a province of Russia, now in Estonia) where his father, Theodosius Harnack, held a professorship of pastoral theology.

He married Amalie Thiersch on 27 December 1879. Their daughter Agnes von Zahn-Harnack became an activist in the Women&#x27;s movement.

Harnack studied at the local Imperial University of Dorpat (1869–72) and at the University of Leipzig, where he took his degree; soon afterwards, in 1874, he began lecturing as a &quot;Privatdozent&quot;. These lectures, which dealt with such special subjects as Gnosticism and the Apocalypse, attracted considerable attention, and in 1876 he was appointed &quot;professor extraordinarius&quot;. In the same year he began the publication, in conjunction with Oscar Leopold von Gebhardt and Theodor Zahn, of an edition of the works of the Apostolic Fathers, &quot;Patrum apostolicorum opera&quot;, a smaller edition of which appeared in 1877.

In 1879 he was called to the University of Giessen as &quot;professor ordinarius&quot; of church history. There he collaborated with Gebhardt in &quot;Texte und Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchristlichen Litteratur&quot; (1882 sqq.), an irregular periodical, containing only essays in New Testament and patristic fields. In 1881 he published a work on monasticism, &quot;Das Mönchtum – seine Ideale und seine Geschichte&quot; (5th ed., 1900; English translation, 1901), and became joint editor with Emil Schürer of the &quot;Theologische Literaturzeitung&quot;.

In 1885 he published the first volume of his &quot;Lehrbuch der Dogmengeschichte&quot; (3rd ed. in three volumes, 1894–1898; English translation in seven volumes, 1894–1899). In this work Harnack traced the rise of dogma, which he understood as the authoritative doctrinal system of the church and its development from the 4th century down to the Protestant Reformation. He considered that from its earliest origins, Christian faith and Greek philosophy were so closely intermingled that the resultant system included many beliefs and practices that were not authentically Christian. Therefore, Protestants are not only free, but bound, to criticize it; Protestantism could be understood as a rejection of this dogma and a return to the pure faith that characterized the original church. An abridgment of this appeared in 1889 with the title &quot;Grundriss der Dogmengeschichte&quot; (3rd ed., 1898).

In 1886 Harnack was called to the University of Marburg and in 1888, in spite of violent opposition from the conservative church authorities, to Berlin. In 1890 he became a member of the Academy of Sciences. In Berlin, somewhat against his will, he was drawn into a controversy on the Apostles&#x27; Creed, in which the partisan antagonisms within the Prussian Church had found expression. Harnack&#x27;s view was that the creed contains both too much and too little to be a satisfactory test for candidates for ordination; he preferred a briefer declaration of faith which could be rigorously applied to all (cf. his &quot;Das Apostolische Glaubensbekenntnis. Ein geschichtlicher Bericht nebst einer Einleitung und einem Nachwort&quot;, 1892).

In Berlin, Harnack continued writing. In 1893 he published a history of early Christian literature down to Eusebius of Caesarea, &quot;Geschichte der altkirchlichen Literatur bis Eusebius&quot; (part 2 of vol. 5., 1897); and in his popular lectures, &quot;Das Wesen des Christentums&quot; appeared in 1900 (5th ed., 1901; English translation, &quot;What is Christianity?&quot; 1901). One of his later historical works, &quot;Die Mission und Ausbreitung des Christentums in den ersten drei Jahrhunderten&quot; (1902; English translation, &quot;The Mission and Expansion of Christianity in the First Three Centuries&quot;, in two volumes, 1904–1905), was followed by some important New Testament studies (&quot;Beitrage zur Einleitung in das neue Testament&quot;, 1906 sqq.; Engl. trans.: &quot;Luke the Physician&quot;, 1907; &quot;The Sayings of Jesus&quot;, 1908).
Harnack was one of the most prolific and stimulating of modern critical scholars, and brought up in his &quot;Seminar&quot; a whole generation of teachers who carried his ideas and methods throughout the whole of Germany and beyond.

From 1905 to 1921, Harnack was the General Director of the Royal Library at Berlin (from 1918 called the Prussian State Library).

Like many liberal professors in Germany, Harnack welcomed World War I in 1914, and signed a public statement endorsing Germany&#x27;s war-aims (the Manifesto of the Ninety-Three). It was this statement, with his teacher Harnack&#x27;s signature on it, that Karl Barth cited as a major impetus for his rejection of liberal theology.

Harnack was one of the moving spirits in the foundation, in 1911, of the Kaiser Wilhelm Gesellschaft (KWG), and became its first President. The Society&#x27;s activities were much constrained by the First World War, but in the Weimar Republic period Harnack guided it to be a major vehicle for overcoming the isolation of German academics felt as a result of the war and its aftermath. The society&#x27;s flagship conference centre in Berlin, the Harnack House, which opened in 1929, was named in his honour. After a long period in U.S. Army hands after World War II it has now resumed the role Harnack envisaged, as a centre for international intellectual life in the German capital, under the management of the KWG&#x27;s successor organisation, the Max Planck Gesellschaft.

==Biblical Criticism and Theology==

Among the distinctive characteristics of Harnack&#x27;s work were his insistence on absolute freedom in the study of church history and the New Testament (i.e. there were no taboo areas of research that could not be critically examined); his distrust of speculative theology, whether orthodox or liberal; and his interest in practical Christianity as a religious life and not a system of theology. Some of his addresses on social matters were published under the heading &quot;Essays on the Social Gospel&quot; (1907).

Harnack regarded all four gospels to be &quot;not altogether useless as sources of history&quot;, but still, &quot;not written with the simple object of giving the facts as they were; they are books composed for the work of evangelisation.&quot;

Harnack&#x27;s suggested view on Biblical miracles was nuanced, and distinguished between certain types thusly: 

&quot;In the fourth place, and lastly, although the order of Nature be inviolable, we are not yet by any means acquainted with all the forces working in it and acting reciprocally with other forces. Our acquaintance even with the forces inherent in matter, and with the field of their action, is incomplete; while of psychic forces we know very much less. We see that a strong will and a firm faith exert an influence upon the life of the body, and produce phenomena which strike us as marvellous. Who is there up to now that has set any sure bounds to the province of the possible and the actual? No one. Who can say how far the influence of soul upon soul and of soul upon body reaches ? No one. Who can still maintain that any extraordinary phenomenon that may appear in this domain is entifely based on error and delusion ? Miracles, it is true, do not happen; but of the marvellous and the inexplicable there is plenty. In our present state of knowledge we have become more careful, more hesitating in our judgment, in regard to the stories of the miraculous which we have received from antiquity. That the earth in its course stood still; that a she-ass spoke; that a storm was quieted by a word, we do not believe, and we shall never again believe; but that the lame walked, the blind saw, and the deaf heard, will not be so summarily dismissed as an illusion.&quot;

<text>The Pergamon Museum (; ) is a listed building on the Museum Island in the historic centre of Berlin, Germany. It was built from 1910 to 1930 by order of Emperor Wilhelm II and according to plans by Alfred Messel and Ludwig Hoffmann in Stripped Classicism style. As part of the Museum Island complex, the Pergamon Museum was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1999 because of its architecture and testimony to the evolution of museums as architectural and social phenomena.

Prior to its closing in 2023, the Pergamon Museum was home to the &quot;&quot;, including the famous Pergamon Altar, the and the . 

In October 2023, the museum was completely closed for visitors, and is expected to remain mostly closed for 14 to 20 years – until 2037 to 2043 – for the execution of comprehensive renovation works. Its North Wing is expected to reopen in 2027.

== Origin ==

By the time the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum on Museum Island (today the Bodemuseum) had opened in 1904, it was clear that the edifice was not large enough to host all of the art and archaeological treasures being excavated under German supervision. Excavations were underway in the areas of ancient Babylon, Uruk, Assur, Miletus, Priene and ancient Egypt, and objects from these sites could not be properly displayed within the existing German museum system. Wilhelm von Bode, director of the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum, initiated plans to build a new museum nearby to accommodate ancient architecture, German post-antiquity art, and Middle Eastern and Islamic art.

Alfred Messel began a design for the large three-wing building in 1906. After his death in 1909 his friend Ludwig Hoffman took charge of the project and construction began in 1910, continuing during the First World War (1918) and the great inflation of the 1920s. The completed building was opened in 1930.

The Pergamon Museum was severely damaged during the air attacks on Berlin at the end of the Second World War. Many of the display objects had been stored in safe places, and some of the large exhibits were walled in for protection. In 1945, the Red Army collected all of the loose museum items, either as war booty or to steal them while the fires were raging in Berlin. Not until 1958 were most of the objects returned to East Germany. Significant parts of the collection remain in Russia. Some are currently stored in the Pushkin Museum in Moscow and the Hermitage Museum in Saint Petersburg. The return of these items has been arranged in a treaty between Germany and Russia but, as of June 2003, is blocked by Russian restitution laws.

== Exhibition ==
Among the pieces the museum displays are:
* The Pergamon Altar
* The Market Gate of Miletus
* The Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way, Babylon
* The Mshatta Facade
* The Meissner fragment from the Epic of Gilgamesh

===Antiquity Collection &quot;(Antikensammlung)&quot;===
The collection goes back to the prince-electors of Brandenburg, who collected objects from antiquity; the collection began with an acquisition by a Roman archaeologist in 1698. It first became accessible (in part) to the public in 1830, when the Altes Museum was opened. The collection expanded greatly with excavations in Olympia, Samos, Pergamon, Miletus, Priene, Magnesia, Cyprus, and Didyma.

This collection is divided between the Pergamon Museum and the Altes Museum.

The collection contains sculpture from the archaic to Hellenistic ages as well as artwork from Classical antiquity: architecture, sculptures, inscriptions, mosaics, bronzes, jewelry and pottery.

The main exhibits are the Pergamon Altar from the 2nd century BC, with a long sculptural frieze depicting the struggle of the gods and the giants, and the Gate of Miletus from Roman antiquity.

As Germany was divided following the Second World War, so was the collection. The Pergamon Museum was reopened in 1959 in East Berlin, while what remained in West Berlin was displayed in Schloss Charlottenburg.

=== Islamic Art Museum &quot;(Museum für Islamische Kunst)&quot; ===
The Islamic Department was part of the Kaiser-Friedrich-Museum which opened in 1904. In the newly built Pergamon Museum, the museum moved into the upper floor of the south wing and was opened there in 1932.

===The Middle East Museum (&quot;Vorderasiatisches Museum&quot;)===

The Middle East Museum exhibition displays objects found by German archeologists and others from the areas of Assyrian, Sumerian, and Babylonian culture. Additionally there are historical buildings, reliefs and lesser cultural objects and jewelry.

The main display is the Ishtar Gate and the Processional Way of Babylon along with the throne room facade of Nebuchadnezzar II.

The Vorderasiatisches Museum also displays the Meissner fragment from the Epic of Gilgamesh.

== Plans ==

The comprehensive plan for Museum Island includes an expansion of the Pergamon Museum, with connections to the Neues Museum, Bodemuseum, Alte Nationalgalerie and a new visitor centre, the James Simon Gallery.

An architectural competition in 2000 was won by Oswald Mathias Ungers from Cologne. The Pergamon Museum will be redeveloped according to his plan, which controversially proposes large alterations to buildings unchanged since 1930. The current entrance building in the Court of Honor will be replaced with a fourth wing, and an underground walk (&quot;Archäologische Promenade&quot;, archeologic walk) will connect four of the five museums.

From September 2014 up to October 2023, the museum was partially closed for renovation. The hall containing Pergamon Altar will remain closed to the general public. Initially the reopening was scheduled for 2019. In November 2016, it was revealed that the estimated project costs would almost double to 477 million euros. Two pump houses built in the ground during the initial construction between 1910 and 1930 had been discovered causing rising costs and delays. At least 60 million euros of the increased costs are directly due to the fact that construction costs had risen since the original estimate 10 years ago. The Pergamon altar hall was not expected to reopen until at least 2025.

In 2018 a temporary exhibition space just outside Museum Island and a short distance from Pergamon Museum was opened, housing a panorama of the ancient city by the Berlin-based artist Yadegar Asisi, a 3D reconstruction of the famous Pergamon altar by the Fraunhofer Institute for Computer Graphics Research and parts of the altar including the Telephos Frieze.

As part of the Museum Island Master Plan, the Pergamon Museum underwent renovation in October 2023. It will remain closed for 14 to 20 years, with a partial reopening in 2027.

<text>Toronto ( ) is a lakeside suburb within the City of Lake Macquarie, Greater Newcastle in New South Wales, Australia, approximately from Newcastle&#x27;s central business district and is a commercial hub for the sprawling suburbs on the western shore of the lake. It is one of the major centres in the City of Lake Macquarie.

==History==
The Aboriginal people, in this area, the Awabakal, were the first people of this land.

The area was originally the site of an Aboriginal mission called Ebenezer, established in 1829 by Reverend Threlkeld. Threlkeld is reported to have begun construction of his chimney with a local black stone which he later realised was coal. Coal Point, just to the south, is named after this discovery. The development of several coal mines in the region, proximity to the nearby city of Newcastle, and its position by the lake led to gradual development and population increases. The mission closed in 1841.

In 1885, the Excelsior Land, Investment and Building Co. and Bank Ltd acquired a portion of Threlkelds&#x27; original 1,280 acre grant from McMahon and Whiting plus the 100 ft waterfront reserve from the Crown for £13,722 and subdivided it in 1887.

Ebenezer was then renamed after Toronto, Ontario, Canada, in honour of Edward Hanlan, a Canadian world-champion sculler who visited Australia in 1884. The area&#x27;s subdividers, the Excelsior Company, named the land in honour of Hanlan&#x27;s visit, which coincided with the opening of the subdivision. The Canadian city&#x27;s name is said to have come from the Mohawk language tkaronto, meaning “&quot;where there are trees standing in the water&quot;&quot;.

This subdivision also coincided with the opening of the Great Northern Railway and became the basis of the future town of Toronto. The Prince of Wales, later Edward VIII, visited Toronto by train on the Toronto railway line on 24 June 1920.

==Population==
At the 2021 census, there were 5,973 people in Toronto.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 8.3% of the population.
* 82.4% of people were born in Australia. The next most common country of birth was England at 3.5%.
* 89.3% of people spoke only English at home. 
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.7%, Anglican 16.6% and Catholic 15.3%.

==Services==
Toronto has three public schools: Toronto High School, Toronto Primary School, and Biraban Public School. It also has three private schools, Charlton Christian College, St. Joseph&#x27;s Primary School and Toronto Adventist Primary School.

Toronto has a polyclinic and a private hospital. There is now a new healthcare centre called the Alec Rice Centre on the Boulevarde.

Toronto has an ambulance station, police station, Fire Brigade and a Court House that serve the Western Lake Macquarie area.

==The Boulevarde==
Toronto has a high street called The Boulevarde. This road starts at the foreshore, forming a junction with Victory Parade. This road stretches westwards for 1.2 kilometres, and is the commercial hub for Toronto and its surrounding areas.

The section of the road between the foreshore and Cary Street is the main retail area for Toronto. There are many boutique shops on this strip.

Over the years, the streetscape has degraded and in 2013, Lake Macquarie City Council decided to start renewing the streetscape. This process began by cutting down the famous figs that line the street, and then replacing the walkways and planting more controllable trees. Work will continue into 2018.

==Victory Parade==
;The War Memorial – Unveiled by Lt. Col. BURNAGE, 30 September 1922

Soon after its unveiling in Victory Parade, the Monument was found to be a traffic hazard, so it was moved closer to the footpath (at the entrance to the pedestrian bridge over the railway line). In 1959 it was moved to Edward Gain Park, near Wharf Street. Then in the 1964, when there was a proposal to take some of this park for a road, the Monument was moved to Goffet Park. However, no matter where it has been located, the Monument has always been the focal point for the Anzac Day and Remembrance Day services in Toronto.

;Victory Theatre

NMH 2.2.1921:7 – Toronto is to have a Picture Theatre by wide – Mr J Chapman has contract. Located in Victory Parade, Toronto opposite the Railway Station.
Commenced screening on Wednesday 19 July 1922 by Mr George W Goffett. After having several owners, it was bought by Mr &amp; Mrs P Crethary around 1951. CinemaScope was installed about the mid 1950s, it was the first theatre outside Newcastle to have it. 
The theatre closed on Saturday 12 August 1961. The last films screened were &quot;The Angry Silence&quot; and &quot;The Gunslinger&quot;.
The building was used by a variety of businesses including Inskip Motorcycles until 1984.
The building no longer exists, as it was destroyed by fire in the early 1990s.

;Hotel Toronto

Built in 1887 from locally-made bricks, the Toronto Hotel has been the best-known landmark throughout the entire history of the township.

The Excelsior Company enthusiastically promoted it as &quot;a pleasant and commodious brick building, containing about thirty bedrooms, besides parlors, bar, dining and billiard rooms, &amp;c. Standing on one of the prettiest spots upon the shores of the Lake, in its own grounds of some twenty acres, the hotel commands a fine view of a splendid reach of water extending to the little village of Belmont. The extensive pleasure grounds are laid out with croquet lawns, lawn tennis court, bowling greens, &amp;c. A spacious dancing pavilion has been erected for devotees of Terpsichore, while the lovers of the green cloth are provided with an excellent billiard table.&quot;

Now on the Register of the National Estate, the hotel has undergone numerous alterations and renovations throughout its lifetime. It no longer dominates the skyline as it did in years gone by. Healthy and vigorous trees growing in Regatta Walk render the Hotel barely visible from Toronto&#x27;s public baths and private jetties.

==Religion==
There are multiple churches in Toronto. These are:
* The Foursquare Church of Australia &#x27;New Day Christian Church&#x27; on Day Street
* Christ the King Anglican Church on Brighton Avenue 
* The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints on Bandalong Street
* Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses Church on Excelsior Parade
* Goodlife Church Toronto held at Charlton Christian College
* Pentecostal &#x27;Living Word Lakeside&#x27; Church held at Toronto Primary School on Bay Street
* St. Joseph&#x27;s Catholic Church on Wangi Road 
* Toronto Seventh-Day Adventist Church on Parkside Parade 
* Toronto Uniting Church on The Boulevarde 
* Toronto Baptist Church on the corner of The Boulevarde and Jindalee Street
* Westlakes Independent Baptist Church on Ridge Road, Kilaben Bay.

==Transport==
Toronto is considered to be the hub for public transport on the western side of Lake Macquarie. The area is served by a privately operated bus service; &#x27;Hunter Valley Buses&#x27;, which services the areas to the west, south and north of the town.
Toronto was served by train services on the Toronto railway line until March 1990, when the NSW Government closed the line because of low passenger levels. The train service was replaced by a bus service which connects Toronto with Fassifern railway station. Train services operating from Fassifern include services to Sydney and Newcastle as well as the XPT service to Brisbane. Toronto is well served by road links to Newcastle and Sydney and is approximately 8 minutes from the Sydney-Newcastle Freeway (M1).

The Toronto centre serves the local communities of Kilaben Bay, Coal Point, Carey Bay, Rathmines and Wangi Wangi to the south and Teralba, Booragul, Woodrising, Fennell Bay, Bolton Point, Fassifern and Blackalls Park to the north.

==Sports==
Many Toronto residents are involved in water sports. The shore near the town has the Royal Motor Yacht Club and the Toronto Amateur Sailing Club. Yachts and cruisers are moored on the lake and smaller craft are pulled up onto private land at the waters edge.

Toronto is represented by three sports teams in Newcastle competitions. The Toronto Awaba Stags FC in the Northern NSW Football competition; the Macquarie Scorpions in the Newcastle Rugby League and also the Toronto Workers Kookaburras in the Newcastle cricket competition.

Toronto Netball Club plays at Westlakes Netball Association.

Nathan Outteridge, Olympic gold medal winner for sailing, sailed at the Toronto Amateur Sailing club in his youth.

Nathan Green, winner of the 2009 RBC Canadian Open, was born when his family lived at Toronto.

Toronto is also represented in Swimming by Macquarie Shores Swimming club, many Macquarie Shores swimmers compete at Regional and State level.

<text>Josh Taylor (born September 25, 1943) is an American television actor. He is known for playing Chris Kositchek and Roman Brady on the American dramatic serial &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;, Jack McKay on the teen drama &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; and as Michael Hogan, the father on the situation comedy &quot;The Hogan Family&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Born in Princeton, Illinois as Tommy Tim Taylor and known as &quot;Timmy&quot;, Taylor moved with his family to Chillicothe, Illinois when he was two years old. They lived in Shore acres with a swimming pool. His dad became athletic director of Chillicothe Township High School (now Illinois Valley Central High School) as well as a respected football coach, and both Josh and older brother Ron played quarterback under him. He was tutored in algebra in high school by Elizabeth Marie Starr (she a freshman, he a sophomore). Heavily recruited for his football skills, Josh chose Dartmouth College, where he was a member of two Ivy Championship teams and the Phi Delta Alpha fraternity, graduating with an A.B. degree in sociology in 1965. He then received a full scholarship to the University of Denver law school, where he earned his Juris Doctor degree in 1969. After law school, he moved to the West Coast.

==Career==
After earning his Juris Doctor, he decided to take a year off and work on the Alaska Pipeline. On the way to Alaska he stopped in Los Angeles to visit friends and was offered a job as manager of the Westwood Village Bratskeller. He spent a year and a half at the restaurant which catered to celebrities and, surrounded by actors and producers, decided to give up a future in law to pursue acting. After the Bratskeller closed, he worked as a bartender at the Riverside Lounge in Santa Monica until he snagged his first acting role playing a contemporary cowboy on an episode of &quot;Barnaby Jones&quot; in 1976. This was quickly followed with roles on &quot;The Six Million Dollar Man&quot; and &quot;The Hardy Boys&quot;.

In 1977, he took the role of bartender Chris Kositchek on the soap opera &quot;Days of Our Lives&quot;. His notoriety heightened as he became an integral part of the fictional landscape of Salem, the setting of the soap, and this eventually led to primetime starring tryouts. In 1981, Taylor went to CBS and had his own short-lived detective series, &quot;Riker&quot;. His role on &quot;Days&quot; continued uninterrupted.

In 1985, producers Tom Miller and Bob Boyett were casting the husband role for Valerie Harper on her new NBC series &quot;Close to Home&quot;, which was retitled &quot;Valerie&quot; before its premiere. Harper&#x27;s on-screen husband, Michael Hogan, was an airline pilot who was seldom around. Taylor was called in for the part, among many other actors who were willing to settle for part-time status on the show, and earned the role. &quot;Valerie&quot; premiered in March 1986 to moderate ratings but critical success and, as the series was picked up for a second season, Taylor successfully balanced his work on the sitcom with his long-running role on &quot;Days&quot;.

In 1987, behind-the-scenes events on &quot;Valerie&quot; would cause Taylor to leave &quot;Days of our Lives&quot;. Valerie Harper was fired by Lorimar-Telepictures, the series&#x27; parent studio, during that year&#x27;s filming hiatus (between seasons two and three) following a contract dispute. Both her dismissal and her character&#x27;s being written off as having died were controversial at the time, since the show was named after its star and lead character. Sandy Duncan was named as Harper&#x27;s replacement, and Taylor felt that, to ensure the continued success of the show, he would leave &quot;Days&quot; in order expand his sitcom role. Seeing this as a foothold to a lasting role in primetime, Taylor only thought it appropriate that the Michael Hogan character would be home more often for his family, both in the wake of his wife&#x27;s death and in order to help his sister (Duncan) settle into the household. The series was retitled &quot;Valerie&#x27;s Family: The Hogans&quot; in September 1987, later becoming &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; (which all seasons of the show became known as in syndication) in June 1988.

Meanwhile, Taylor was preparing to make his last appearance as Chris Kositchek on &quot;Days.&quot; In the fall of 1987, after a ten-year run, the character had passed the bar exam and become a lawyer, serving the residents of Salem, if only for a brief period.

In 1988, Taylor starred opposite Barbara Eden in the made-for-television movie, &quot;The Secret Life of Kathy McCormick&quot;, and guest starred on series including &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot;, &quot;Matlock&quot;, and &quot;L.A. Law&quot;. &quot;The Hogan Family&quot; moved to CBS for its sixth season in 1990, but was canceled by the end of 1990-91 season. Taylor followed this with the pilot of the television version of &quot;North Dallas Forty&quot;. He played Jack McKay, Dylan&#x27;s father, on &quot;Beverly Hills, 90210&quot; on and off between 1991 and 1993, with occasional appearances in later seasons.

In 1997, he returned to &quot;Days&quot;, this time playing the character of Roman Brady. In 2004, Roman was murdered by the Salem Stalker (who turned out to be his ex-wife, Marlena) during his and Kate&#x27;s wedding reception. A few months later, it was revealed that Roman didn&#x27;t die but was alive on a tropical island called Melaswen (New Salem backwards). He is still appearing on the show.

==Personal life==
Taylor is a son of George Gail Taylor and Ragnhild &quot;Rena&quot; (Christensen) Taylor. His mother died from pregnancy related causes. His father married Dorothy Gubbins on November 23, 1946, in Bradford, Illinois. Their daughter Vicki was born around 1948. Taylor&#x27;s older brother Ron died in 2014.

<text>Hugo Junkers (3 February 1859 – 3 February 1935) was a German aircraft engineer and aircraft designer who pioneered the design of all-metal airplanes and flying wings. His company, Junkers Flugzeug- und Motorenwerke AG (Junkers Aircraft and Motor Works), was one of the mainstays of the German aircraft industry in the years between World War I and World War II. His multi-engined, all-metal passenger- and freight planes helped establish airlines in Germany and around the world.

In addition to aircraft, Junkers also built both diesel and petrol engines and held various thermodynamic and metallurgical patents. He was also one of the main sponsors of the Bauhaus movement and facilitated the move of the Bauhaus from Weimar to Dessau (where his factory was situated) in 1925.

Amongst the highlights of his career were the Junkers J 1 of 1915, the world&#x27;s first practical all-metal aircraft, incorporating a cantilever wing design with virtually no external bracing, the Junkers F 13 of 1919 (the world&#x27;s first all-metal passenger aircraft), the Junkers W 33 (which made the first successful heavier-than-air east-to-west crossing of the Atlantic Ocean), the Junkers G.38 &quot;flying wing&quot;, and the Junkers Ju 52, affectionately nicknamed &quot;Tante Ju&quot;, one of the most famous airliners of the 1930s.

When the Nazis came into power in 1933, they requested Junkers and his businesses aid in the German re-armament. When Junkers declined, the Nazis placed him under house arrest in 1934 and eventually seized control of his patents and company. He died the following year. Under Nazi control, his company produced some of the most successful German warplanes of the Second World War.

==Biography==
Junkers was born in Rheydt in the Prussian Rhine Province, the son of a wealthy industrialist. After taking his &quot;Abitur&quot; exams in 1878, he attended the Technische Hochschulen in Charlottenburg (now Technische Universität Berlin) and Aachen (now RWTH Aachen), where he completed his engineering studies in 1883.

At first, he returned to Rheydt to work in his father&#x27;s company, but soon attended further lectures on electromagnetism and thermodynamics held by Adolf Slaby in Charlottenburg. Slaby placed him with the Continental-Gasgesellschaft in Dessau, where he worked on the development of the first opposed-piston engine. To measure heating value, Junkers patented a calorimeter and founded a manufacturing company in 1892. Junkers personally introduced the calorimeter at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition in Chicago, where it was awarded a gold medal. The next year, he patented a gas-fired bath boiler, which he refined as a tankless heater. In 1895, he founded Junkers &amp; Co. to utilize his inventions.

From 1897, he was offered a professorship of mechanical engineering at Aachen, where he lectured until 1912. Working as an engineer at the same time, Junkers taking substantial gains of Junkers &amp; Co. devised, patented, and exploited calorimeters, domestic appliances (gas stoves), pressure regulators, gas oil engines, fan heaters, and other inventions.

===Aeronautical work===
Junkers&#x27; aeronautical work began in earnest at age 50 when he worked with engineer Hans Reissner in Aachen. Reissner had developed an all-metal aircraft, on which work first started in 1909 at the Brand Heath, equipped with corrugated iron wings built by Junkers &amp; Co. in Dessau. The iron wings were patented one year later. Junkers had a wind tunnel built and invented a hydraulic brake.

He had far-sighted ideas of metal aeroplanes and flying wings, but the necessities of the war held him back. During World War I, the government forced him to focus on aircraft production. In 1915, he developed the world&#x27;s first practical all-metal aircraft design, the Junkers J 1 &quot;Blechesel&quot; (Sheetmetal Donkey), which survived on display at the Deutsches Museum in Munich until WWII. His firm&#x27;s first military production design in 1916–17 was the armored-fuselage, two-seat, all-metal sesquiplane known by its &quot;IdFlieg&quot; designation, the Junkers J.I, considered the best German ground attack aircraft of the war. During this time, the German government&#x27;s &quot;IdFlieg&quot; military aviation inspectorate forced him to merge his firm with Anthony Fokker&#x27;s to form the &quot;Junkers-Fokker Aktiengesellschaft&quot; on 20 October 1917. The J.I&#x27;s pattern of an armored fuselage that protected the nose-mounted engine, pilot, and observer in a unitized metal &quot;bathtub&quot; was the possible inspiration for Sergey Ilyushin&#x27;s later Il-2 &quot;Shturmovik&quot; (conceivably appropriate as Junkers did have a manufacturing plant in Fili, a suburb of Moscow, in the Soviet Union in the 1920s) with a similar armored fuselage design. As this design philosophy for such combat aircraft had proven to be a good idea, it was once again broadly reused for the 1970s-premiered American Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II &quot;Warthog&quot; twin-turbofan powered attack aircraft, also having its pilot enveloped in an armoured titanium bathtub. By 1918, Junkers&#x27; firm, with its previously demonstrated preference for monoplane-pattern airframe designs, had created the world&#x27;s first production low-winged, single-seat monoplane all-metal fighter aircraft, the Junkers D.I, which pioneered the use of Alfred Wilm&#x27;s 1906 invention of duralumin throughout a production airframe. The D.I did not enter production until 1918. He also produced a two-seat monoplane fighter, the Junkers CL.I. Both postwar Soviet aviation pioneer Andrei Tupolev and American aviation designer William Bushnell Stout owed much to Hugo Junkers in the designs of their earlier aircraft, which benefited from Junkers&#x27; corrugated, light-metal construction technique.

The Junkers F.13 of 1919 was the first of several successful civil aircraft designs produced by &quot;Junkers Flugzeugwerke&quot;: later designs include the Junkers Ju 52/3m from 1932. Through a variety of business initiatives, Junkers was active in founding and developing airlines around the globe, initially intending to sell them aircraft. Airlines where Junkers played a pivotal role in early phases of their development include Deutsche Luft Hansa and Lloyd Aéreo Boliviano. Several business ventures failed from wider economic or political problems that hampered sound engineering plans. Junkers always had more ideas: the massive four-engined G.38, nicknamed &quot;Der Grosse Dessauer&quot;, delivered to Luft Hansa, made no commercial trips for many months as he repeatedly recalled it to the factory for improvements.

When the Nazis gained control of the German government in 1933, Junkers opposed their goal of re-armament. They responded by demanding ownership of all patents and market shares from his remaining companies, under threat of imprisonment on the charge of high treason. He was placed under house arrest in 1934 and died on 3 February 1935.

==Legacy==
Hugo Junkers is mainly known in connection with aircraft bearing his name. These include some he reluctantly developed for the German Empire during World War I, later in minor association with Anthony Fokker, as well as civil aircraft designs during the &quot;interwar period&quot; produced by &quot;Junkers Flugzeugwerke&quot; (Junkers Aircraft Works). Junkers died in 1935, on his 76th birthday.

The earliest all-metal post-World War I aircraft designs of both Andrei Tupolev — with his Tupolev ANT-2 two-passenger small aircraft of 1924 — and William Bushnell Stout&#x27;s initial all-metal design, the Stout ST twin-engine torpedo bomber of 1922, were both based directly on the pioneering work of Junkers, with each engineer (one Soviet, one American) separately developing examples of aircraft like Tupolev&#x27;s enormous, 63 meter wingspan, eight-engined &quot;Maksim Gorki&quot; — the largest aircraft built anywhere in the world in the early 1930s — and Stout&#x27;s popular Ford Trimotor airliner.

In 1976, Junkers was inducted into the International Air &amp; Space Hall of Fame.

Junkers was featured in the 2013 semi-fictional movie &quot;&quot;The Wind Rises&quot;&quot; by Japanese director Hayao Miyazaki.

<doc id="242189" wikidata="Q6691991" url="?curid=242189" title="Pervasive developmental disorder">
<text>The diagnostic category pervasive developmental disorders (PDD), as opposed to specific developmental disorders (SDD), was a group of disorders characterized by delays in the development of multiple basic functions including socialization and communication. It was defined by the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) (from 1980 to 2013), and the International Classification of Diseases (ICD) (until 2022).

The pervasive developmental disorders included autism, Asperger syndrome, pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD), overactive disorder associated with mental retardation and stereotyped movements, and Rett syndrome. The first four of these disorders are commonly called the autism spectrum disorders; the last disorder is much rarer, and is sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.

There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD. Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS. Others diagnose the general category label of PDD because they are hesitant to diagnose very young children with a specific type of PDD, such as autism. Both approaches contribute to confusion about the term, because the term PDD is intended by its coiners and major bodies to refer to a category of disorders and not be used as a diagnostic label.

The terminology PDD and ASD is often used interchangeably and varies depending on location.

The onset of pervasive developmental disorders occurs during infancy, but the condition is usually not identified until the child is around three years old. Parents may begin to question the health of their child when developmental milestones are not met, including age appropriate motor movement and speech production.

The fifth edition of the DSM removed PDD as a category of diagnoses, and largely replaced it with ASD and a measure of the relative severity of the condition. The eleventh edition of the ICD also removed the category.

==Signs and symptoms==
Symptoms of PDD may include behavioral and communication problems such as:
* Difficulty using and understanding language
* Difficulty relating to people, objects, and events; for example, lack of eye contact, pointing behavior, and lack of facial responses
* Unusual play with toys and other objects.
* Paranoia, a characteristic form of social anxiety, derealization, transient psychosis, and unconventional beliefs if environment or routine are changed without notice
* Repetitive body movements or behavior patterns, such as hand flapping, hair twirling, foot tapping, or more complex movements
* Difficulty regulating behaviors and emotions, which may result in temper tantrums, anxiety, and aggression
* Emotional breakdowns
* Delusional or unconventional perception of the world
* Maladaptive daydreaming

===Degrees===
Children with PDD vary widely in abilities, intelligence, and behaviors. Some children do not speak at all, others speak in limited phrases or conversations, and some have relatively normal language development. Repetitive play skills and limited social skills are generally evident. Unusual responses to sensory information—loud noises, lights—are common.

==Diagnosis==
Diagnosis is usually made during early childhood. Individuals who received diagnoses based on the DSM-IV maintain their diagnosis under the autism spectrum disorders. However, an editorial published in the October 2012 issue of &quot;American Journal of Psychiatry&quot; notes that, while some doctors argue that there is insufficient evidence to support the diagnostic distinction between ASD and PDD, multiple literature reviews found that studies showing significant differences between the two disorders significantly outnumbered those that found no difference.

The World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases, 10th edition (ICD-10) categorized PDD into five distinct subtypes, each with their own diagnostic criteria. The five subtypes, childhood autism, atypical autism, Rett syndrome, Asperger syndrome and childhood disintegrative disorder, are characterized by abnormalities in social interactions and communication.

The disorders were primarily diagnosed based on behavioral features, although the presence of any other medical conditions is important, it is not taken into account when making a diagnosis.

Before the release of the DSM-5, some clinicians used PDD-NOS as a &quot;temporary&quot; diagnosis for children under the age of five when, for whatever reason, they are reluctant to diagnose autism. There are several justifications for this. Very young children have limited social interaction and communication skills to begin with, so it can be difficult to correctly diagnose milder cases of autism in toddlers. The unspoken assumption is that by the age of five, unusual behaviors will either resolve or develop into diagnosable autism. However, some parents view the PDD label as no more than a euphemism for autism spectrum disorders, while the PDD label makes it more difficult to receive aid for early childhood intervention.

===Classification===
The pervasive developmental disorders were:
* Pervasive developmental disorder not otherwise specified (PDD-NOS), which includes atypical autism, and is the most common (47% of autism diagnoses);
* Typical autism, the best-known;
* Asperger syndrome (9% of autism diagnoses);
* Rett syndrome; and
* Childhood disintegrative disorder (CDD).
The first three of these disorders are commonly called the autism spectrum disorders; the last two disorders are much rarer, and are sometimes placed in the autism spectrum and sometimes not.

In May 2013, the &quot;Diagnostic and Statistical Manual–5th Edition&quot; (&quot;DSM-5&quot;) was released, updating the classification for pervasive developmental disorders. The grouping of disorders, including PDD-NOS, autism, Asperger syndrome, Rett syndrome, and CDD, has been removed and replaced with the general term of autism spectrum disorders (ASDs). The American Psychiatric Association has concluded that using the general diagnosis of ASD supports more accurate diagnoses. The grouping of these disorders into ASD also reflects that autism is characterized by common symptoms and should therefore bear a single diagnostic term. In order to distinguish between the different disorders, the DSM-5 employs severity levels. The severity levels take into account required support, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and deficits in social communication.

===PDD and PDD-NOS===
There is a division among doctors on the use of the term PDD. Many use the term PDD as a short way of saying PDD-NOS. Others use the general category because the term PDD actually refers to a category of disorders and is not a diagnostic label.

PDD is not itself a diagnosis, while PDD-NOS is a diagnosis. To further complicate the issue, PDD-NOS can also be referred to as &quot;atypical personality development&quot;, &quot;atypical PDD&quot;, or &quot;atypical autism&quot;.

==Treatment==

Medications are used to address certain behavioral problems; therapy for children with PDD should be specialized according to the child&#x27;s specific needs.

Some children with PDD benefit from specialized classrooms in which the class size is small and instruction is given on a one-to-one basis. Others function well in standard special education classes or regular classes with support. Early intervention, including appropriate and specialized educational programs and support services, play a critical role in improving the outcome of individuals with PDD.

<text>Landkreis Ludwigsburg is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the middle of Baden-Württemberg, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from north clockwise) Heilbronn, Rems-Murr-Kreis, the district-free city Stuttgart, and the districts Böblingen and Enz-Kreis.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Oberamt Ludwigsburg&quot;, which was created by the dukedom Württemberg in the beginning of the 19th century. After several small changes during the century, it was converted into a district in 1938. Several municipalities of the dissolved &quot;Oberämter&quot; Besigheim, Marbach and Waiblingen were added to the newly formed district.

As a result of the communal reform of 1973, the district gained about half of the dissolved district Vaihingen, and some few municipalities from the districts Backnang and Leonberg.

==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Neckar, which divides the district into a big western part and a smaller eastern part.

==Partnerships==
Starting in 1990 the district has a partnership with the district Chemnitzer Land (now part of the district of Zwickau) in Saxony. Even older is the partnership with the region Upper Galilee in Israel.
Since 1992 the district has a partnership with the Hungarian Komitat Pest, however the official signing of the partnership contract took place in 2002. A friendship exists with the city Yichang in the province Hubei, China.

==Coat of arms==
The imperial eagle in the coat of arms is taken from the arms of the city Markgröningen, which was an imperial city. It was later adopted by the city Ludwigsburg as well. The deer antler above the eagle is the symbol of Württemberg.

<text>The Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People (SOC) is an international clinical protocol by the World Professional Association for Transgender Health (WPATH) outlining the recommended assessment and treatment for transgender and gender-diverse individuals across the lifespan including social, hormonal, or surgical transition. It often influences clinicians&#x27; decisions regarding patients&#x27; treatment. While other standards, protocols, and guidelines existespecially outside the United Statesthe WPATH SOC is the most widespread protocol used by professionals working with transgender or gender-variant people.

Version 8 of the WPATH SOC, the latest version, was released online on September 15, 2022.

==History and development==
Prior to the advent of the first SOC, there was no semblance of consensus on psychiatric, psychological, medical, and surgical requirements or procedures. Before the 1960s, few countries offered safe, legal medical options and many criminalized cross-gender behaviors or mandated unproven psychiatric treatments. In response to this problem, the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association (now known as the World Professional Association for Transgender Health) authored one of the earliest sets of clinical guidelines for the express purpose of ensuring &quot;lasting personal comfort with the gendered self in order to maximize overall psychological well-being and self-fulfillment.&quot;

The WPATH SOC are periodically updated and revised. The eighth and latest version was released on September 15, 2022. Previous versions were released in 1979 (1st), 1980 (2nd), 1981 (3rd), 1990 (4th), 1998 (5th), 2001 (6th), and 2012 (7th).

===Versions 1 to 4===
The first four versions of the &quot;Standards of Care&quot; were titled &quot;Standards of Care: The Hormonal and Surgical Sex Reassignment of Gender Dysphoric Persons&quot;. The first version was released in 1979 and revisions were made in 1980, 1981, and 1990. These revisions were relatively minor, with the text staying mostly the same between versions. These versions of the SOC followed the gatekeeping model laid out by Harry Benjamin, where clinicians set strict eligibility requirements, requiring evaluations from separate mental health professionals and compulsory psychotherapy. 

The first four versions of the &quot;Standards of Care&quot; were published as standalone documents by the Harry Benjamin International Gender Dysphoria Association. However, the third version was also published as a 1985 reprint in the journal &quot;Archives of Sexual Behavior&quot;.

===Version 5===
In the 1990&#x27;s, WPATH was struggling to operate due to criticisms of their SOC in the trans community such as the requirement of the real life test, where patients had to socially transition for up to a year prior to hormones. These critiques developed into a trans-led Advocacy and Liaison committee, marking the first time trans people were officially and actively consulted regarding their treatment. The 5th version, published in 1998, was titled the &quot;Standards of Care for Gender Identity Disorders&quot; to be consistent with the DSM-III. It recommended but did not require psychotherapy and stated that while GID was a mental disorder, that was not a license for stigma.

===Version 6===
The sixth version was published in 2001 and offered more flexibility and individualized care but continued to use the phrase &quot;gender identity disorder&quot;. At the same time transgender people increasingly complained of having to &quot;jump through hoops&quot;. SOC 6 also did not include significant changes to the tasks mental health professionals were required to take or in the general recommendations for content of the letters of readiness. An important change in the eligibility criteria for GAH allowed providers to prescribe hormones even if patients had not undergone the &quot;Real Life Test&quot; or psychotherapy if it was for harm reduction purposes. A notable change in version six separated the eligibility and readiness criteria for top and bottom surgery allowing some patients, particularly individuals assigned female at birth, to receive a mastectomy.

===Version 7===
The seventh version, titled &quot;Standards of Care for the Health of Transsexual, Transgender, and Gender Nonconforming People&quot;, was published in 2012 both in the &quot;International Journal of Transgenderism&quot; and as a standalone document. Included in the guidelines are sections on purpose and use of the WPATH SOC, the global applicability of the WPATH SOC, the difference between gender nonconformity and gender dysphoria, epidemiology, treatment of children, adolescents and adults, mental health, hormone replacement therapy (masculinizing or feminizing; HRT), reproductive health, voice and communication therapy, gender-affirming surgery, lifelong preventive and primary care, applicability of the WPATH SOC to people living in institutional environments, and applicability of the WPATH SOC to people with disorders of sex development.

The seventh version also includes acknowledgements of the ever-evolving language used to describe and treat transsexual, transgender, and gender non-conforming individuals. There is an emphasis placed on the idea that identifying with these labels does not inherently qualify someone as disordered, and that treatment should be focused on the alleviation of any suffering caused by gender dysphoria. They make a stance against the &quot;deprivation of civil and human rights&quot; on the grounds of someone&#x27;s gender identity. This version, much like its predecessor requires referrals for surgical procedures based on set criteria, but notes the importance of informed consent and listening to the wishes of the patient.

The seventh version includes a section distinguishing between cases of gender dysphoria and non-conformity for children and adolescents, as well as recommended treatment paths for each.

A systematic review into international guidelines for management of gender dysphoria and gender incongruence in children and adolescents published as part of the Cass Review in 2024 stated WPATH SOC 7 lacked &quot;developmental rigour and transparency&quot;.

===Version 8===
The eighth version, titled &quot;Standards of Care for the Health of Transgender and Gender Diverse People&quot;, was published in 2022. It gives recommendations for health professionals in eighteen chapters. The guidelines were developed by a multidisciplinary committee of experts, building on previous versions and using the Delphi method. Version 8 is the first one to include a chapter on adolescent care separate from that on the care of children. This version of the protocol gives no specific age limits for treatments, emphasizing the need to decide individually for each patient. It was criticized for suggesting that young people may come to believe they are transgender through social influence.

An earlier draft was criticized by transgender advocates and healthcare providers for including requirements that adolescents evidence &quot;several years&quot; of gender incongruence and that they must undergo comprehensive diagnostic assessments, which was regarded as pathologizing and gatekeeping. The final draft maintained the requirement of an assessment but changed &quot;several years&quot; to &quot;marked and sustained over time&quot;. The draft also lowered recommended age minimums to 14 for hormone treatments, 15 for mastectomies, 16 for breast augmentation and facial surgeries, and 17 for genital surgeries and hysterectomies. Assistant Secretary Levine of the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) recommended removing the age limits, which WPATH declined. WPATH removed the age limits from the final draft after the American Academy of Pediatrics said they&#x27;d withdraw support of the guidelines if they didn&#x27;t.

In August 2024, the Republican chairwoman Lisa McClain of the U.S. Congress Subcommittee on Health Care and Financial Services opened a probe into alleged &quot;political interference&quot; with WPATH&#x27;s guidelines from the HHS. The guidelines became a focus of controversy during the debate over the Scottish government&#x27;s Gender Recognition Reform Bill in 2022. Opponents of the bill highlighted the chapter on eunuchs, which proposes eunuch be considered a gender identity, and criticised NHS Scotland&#x27;s association with WPATH. NHS England commissioned the Cass Review to create guidelines for transgender people in England. A systematic review into international guidelines published as part of the review was published in 2024 and stated that WPATH SOC 8 lacked &quot;developmental rigour and transparency&quot;. NHS England in March 2024 updated their guidelines and stated that for children and adolescents they do not follow WPATH 8.

==Populations==
Issues specific to certain demographics, including adults, children, and adolescents, are described in chapters 5–11 of version 8.

===Adults===
===Adolescents===
In a departure from previous versions, Version 8 draws a conceptual distinction between Adolescents and Children with separate chapters. 

Continued care and careful assessment of cognitive maturity by qualified mental health professionals is recommended. In contrast to previous versions, there are no absolute requirements for duration of assessments or age to access gender-affirming treatments; rather, individual psychosocial and physical development should be taken into account.

Additionally, Chapter 12 and 13 and Appendix D contain further recommendations regarding hormone therapy and surgical treatments in adolescents. 

===Children===
Pertaining to prepubescent children only, chapter 7 makes recommendations regarding the support of children and their families throughout gender exploration and potential social transitions.

===Non-binary===
Non-binary individuals are included for the first time in chapter 8. The guidelines recommend that medical treatment and social support be made available to non-binary people in individualized combinations, for example providing medical interventions without social transition or gender-affirming surgery without hormone therapy. The chapter additionally notes unique experiences of discrimination, minority stress, and difficulty accessing gender-affirming medical treatment among non-binary people, which healthcare providers should take into consideration.

==Treatments==
Recommendations for treatments, including medical and social aspects of gender transition as well as mental health, as are given in Chapters 12–18.

<doc id="242203" wikidata="Q234811" url="?curid=242203" title="Emma, Lady Hamilton">
<text>Dame Emma Hamilton (born Amy Lyon; 26 April 176515 January 1815), known upon moving to London as Emma Hart, and upon marriage as Lady Hamilton, was an English maid, model, dancer and actress. She began her career in London&#x27;s demi-monde, becoming the mistress of a series of wealthy men, culminating in the naval hero Lord Nelson, and was the favourite model and muse of the portraitist George Romney.

In 1791, at the age of 26, she married Sir William Hamilton, British ambassador to the Kingdom of Naples, where she was a success at court, befriending the queen who was a sister of Marie Antoinette, and meeting Nelson.

==Early life==
She was born Amy Lyon in Ness near Neston, Cheshire, England, the daughter of Henry Lyon, a blacksmith who died when she was two months old. She was baptised on 12 May 1765. She was raised by her mother, Mary Kidd (later Cadogan), and grandmother, Sarah Kidd, at Hawarden, and received no formal education. She later went by the name of Emma Hart.

With her grandmother struggling to make ends meet at the age of 60, and after Mary went to London in 1777, Emma began work, aged 12, as a maid at the Hawarden home of Honoratus Leigh Thomas, a surgeon working in Chester.

Only a few months later she was unemployed again and moved to London in the autumn of 1777. She started to work for the Budd family in Chatham Place, Blackfriars, London, and began acting at the Drury Lane theatre in Covent Garden. She worked as a maid for actresses, including Mary Robinson. Emma next worked as a model and dancer at the &quot;Goddess of Health&quot; for James Graham, a Scottish &quot;quack&quot; doctor.At 15, Emma met Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh, who hired her for several months as hostess and entertainer at a lengthy stag party at his Uppark country estate in the South Downs. She is said to have danced nude on his dining room table. Fetherstonhaugh took Emma there as a mistress, but frequently ignored her in favour of drinking and hunting with his friends. Emma soon befriended the Honourable Charles Francis Greville (1749–1809). It was about this time (late June-early July 1781) that she conceived a child by Fetherstonhaugh.Greville took her in as his mistress on condition that the child was fostered out. Once the child (Emma Carew) was born, she was removed to be raised by her great-grandmother at Hawarden for her first three years, and subsequently (after a short spell in London with her mother) deposited with Mr John Blackburn, schoolmaster, and his wife in Manchester. As a young woman, Emma&#x27;s daughter saw her mother frequently, but later when Emma fell into debt, her daughter worked abroad as a companion or governess.

Greville kept Emma in a small house at Edgware Row, Paddington Green, London, at this time a village on the rural outskirts of London. At Greville&#x27;s request, she changed her name to &quot;Mrs Emma Hart&quot;, dressed in modest outfits in subdued colours and eschewed a social life. He arranged for Emma&#x27;s mother to live with her as housekeeper and chaperone. Greville also taught Emma to enunciate more elegantly, and after a while, started to invite some of his friends to meet her.

Seeing an opportunity to make some money by taking a cut of sales, Greville sent her to sit for his friend, the painter George Romney, who was looking for a new model and muse. It was then that Emma became the subject of many of Romney&#x27;s most famous portraits, and soon became London&#x27;s biggest celebrity. So began Romney&#x27;s lifelong obsession with her, sketching her nude and clothed in many poses that he later used to create paintings in her absence. Through the popularity of Romney&#x27;s work and particularly of his striking-looking young model, Emma became well known in society circles, under the name of &quot;Emma Hart&quot;. She was witty, intelligent, a quick learner, elegant and, as paintings of her attest, extremely beautiful. Romney was fascinated by her looks and ability to adapt to the ideals of the age. Romney and other artists painted her in many guises, foreshadowing her later &quot;attitudes&quot;.

In 1783, Greville needed to find a rich wife to replenish his finances, and found a fit in the form of eighteen-year-old heiress Henrietta Middleton. Emma would be a problem, as he disliked being known as her lover (this having become apparent to all through her fame in Romney&#x27;s artworks), and his prospective wife would not accept him as a suitor if he lived openly with Emma Hart.
To be rid of Emma, Greville persuaded his uncle, younger brother of his mother, Sir William Hamilton, British Envoy to Naples, to take her off his hands.

Greville&#x27;s marriage would prove useful to Sir William, as it relieved him of having Greville as a poor relation. To promote his plan, Greville suggested to Sir William that Emma would make a very pleasing mistress, assuring him that, once married to Henrietta Middleton, he would come and fetch Emma back. Sir William, then 55 and newly widowed, had arrived back in London for the first time in over five years. Emma&#x27;s famous beauty was by then well known to Sir William, so much so that he even agreed to pay the expenses for her journey to ensure her speedy arrival. He had long been happily married until the death of his wife in 1782, and he liked female companionship. His home in Naples was well known all over the world for hospitality and refinement. He needed a hostess for his salon, and from what he knew about Emma, he thought she would be the perfect choice.

Greville did not inform Emma of his plan, but instead in 1785 suggested the trip as a prolonged holiday in Naples while he (Greville) was away in Scotland on business, not long after Emma&#x27;s mother had suffered a stroke. Emma was thus sent to Naples, supposedly for six to eight months, little realising that she was going as the mistress of her host. Emma set off for Naples with her mother and Gavin Hamilton on 13 March 1786 overland in an old coach, and arrived in Naples on her 21st birthday on 26 April.

==Marriage to Sir William Hamilton==
After about six months of living in apartments in the Palazzo Sessa with her mother (separately from Sir William) and begging Greville to come and fetch her, Emma came to understand that he had cast her off. She was furious when she realised what Greville had planned for her, but eventually started to enjoy life in Naples and responded to Sir William&#x27;s intense courtship just before Christmas in 1786. They fell in love, Sir William forgot about his plan to take her on as a temporary mistress, and Emma moved into his apartments, leaving her mother downstairs in the ground floor rooms. Emma was unable to attend Court yet, but Sir William took her to every other party, assembly and outing.
They were married on 6 September 1791 at St Marylebone Parish Church, then a plain small building, having returned to England for the purpose and Sir William having gained the King&#x27;s consent. She was twenty-six and he was sixty. Although she was obliged to use her legal name of Amy Lyon on the marriage register, the wedding gave her the title Lady Hamilton which she would use for the rest of her life. Hamilton&#x27;s public career was now at its height and during their visit he was inducted into the Privy Council. Shortly after the ceremony, Romney painted his last portrait of Emma from life, &quot;The Ambassadress&quot;, after which he plunged into a deep depression and drew a series of frenzied sketches of Emma.

The newly married couple returned to Naples after two days. After the marriage, Greville transferred the cost of Emma Carew&#x27;s upkeep to Sir William, and suggested that he might move her to an establishment befitting the stepdaughter of an envoy. However, Sir William preferred to forget about her for a while.

The marriage was not favorable to Sir William&#x27;s family and relations, to the point that Sir William wrote to Thomas Graham, the husband of his niece Mary Graham (another great beauty of the Georgian Period), defending his marriage to Emma. Emma also wrote seeking approval from Graham and other family relations.

==Life in Naples and the &quot;Attitudes&quot;==

She lived for some time in a house in Caserta rented by Sir William. Lady Hamilton became a close friend of Queen Maria Carolina, sister of Marie Antoinette and wife of Ferdinand I of Naples, and soon acquired fluency in both French and Italian. She was also a talented amateur singer. She sang one of the solo parts of Joseph Haydn&#x27;s Nelson Mass and entertained guests at her home. At one point, the Royal Opera in Madrid tried to engage her for a season, in competition with their star, Angelica Catalani, but this offer was turned down. Sir William commissioned many portraits of Emma, although not for their sentimental value; he almost always sold them for a profit, usually in England. M. de Talleyrand, the youngest son of the ambassador at Naples, responded to a remark about Sir William&#x27;s interest in the arts by saying &quot;Rather, it is the arts that look out for Sir William&#x27;s interests&quot;.

Emma&#x27;s vulgar toilette, unaristocratic mannerisms and drinking sometimes raised eyebrows by her company, the Duc de Bourbon remarked during a dinner in Naples at the manner in which Emma drinks port, which must have been a &#x27;habit of hers as she did not become drunk after finishing two or three bottles&#x27;.
Sharing Sir William Hamilton&#x27;s enthusiasm for classical antiquities and art, she developed what she called her &quot;Attitudes&quot;—tableaux vivants in which she portrayed sculptures and paintings before British visitors. Emma developed the attitudes, also known as mimoplastic art, by using Romney&#x27;s idea of combining classical poses with modern allure as the basis for her act. Emma had her dressmaker make dresses modelled on those worn by peasant islanders in the Bay of Naples, and the loose-fitting garments she often wore when modelling for Romney. She would pair these tunics with a few large shawls or veils, draping herself in folds of cloth and posing in such a way as to evoke popular images from Greco-Roman mythology. This cross between postures, dance and acting was first revealed to guests in the spring of 1787 by Sir William at his home in Naples. It formed a sort of charade, with the audience guessing the names of the classical characters and scenes Emma portrayed.
With the aid of her shawls, Emma posed as various classical figures from Medea to Queen Cleopatra, and her performances charmed aristocrats, artists such as Élisabeth-Louise Vigée-Le Brun, writers—including the great Johann Wolfgang von Goethe—and kings and queens alike, setting off new dance trends across Europe and starting a fashion for a draped Grecian style of dress.

&quot;Attitudes&quot; were taken up by several other (female) artists, among them Ida Brun from Denmark, who became Emma&#x27;s successor in the new art form. The famed sculptor Bertel Thorvaldsen admired her art.

==Meeting with Nelson==
As wife of the British Envoy, Emma welcomed Nelson (who had been married to Fanny Nisbet for about six years at that point) after his arrival in Naples on 10 September 1793, when he came to gather reinforcements against the French. She is described in 1797 in the diary of 18-year-old Elizabeth Wynne as &quot;a charming woman, beautiful and exceedingly good humoured and amiable.&quot; When he set sail for Sardinia on 15 September after only five days in Naples, it was clear that he had already fallen a little in love.

After four years of marriage, Emma had despaired of having children with Sir William, although she wrote of him as &quot;the best husband and friend&quot;. It seems likely that he was sterile. She once again tried to persuade him to allow her daughter to come and live with them in the Palazzo Sessa as her mother Mrs Cadogan&#x27;s niece, but he refused this as well as her request to make enquiries in England about suitors for the young Emma.

Nelson returned to Naples five years later, on 22 September 1798 a living legend, after his victory at the Battle of the Nile in Aboukir, with his step-son Josiah Nisbet, then 18 years old. By this time, Nelson&#x27;s adventures had prematurely aged him; he had lost an arm and most of his teeth, and was afflicted by coughing spells. Before his arrival, Emma had written a letter passionately expressing her admiration for him. Nelson even wrote effusively of Emma to his increasingly estranged wife. Emma and Sir William escorted Nelson to their home, the Palazzo Sessa.
Emma nursed Nelson under her husband&#x27;s roof and arranged a party with 1,800 guests to celebrate his 40th birthday on 29 September. After the party, Emma became Nelson&#x27;s secretary, translator and political facilitator. They soon fell in love and began an affair. Hamilton showed admiration and respect for Nelson, and vice versa; the affair was tolerated. By November, gossip from Naples about their affair reached the English newspapers. Emma Hamilton and Horatio Nelson were famous.

Emma had by then become not only a close personal friend of Queen Maria Carolina, but had developed into an important political influence. She advised the queen on how to react to the threats from the French Revolution. Maria Carolina&#x27;s sister Marie Antoinette had fallen a victim to the Revolution.

In 1799, Naples was the scene of a strange revolution led by members of the aristocracy; the common people did not agree with the revolution. The French troops were not welcome, but the royal family fled to Sicily. From here, Nelson tried to help the royal family put down the revolutionaries. He had no support from the British government. He even allowed one of the leaders of the revolution, Admiral Francesco Caracciolo, to be executed for treason. Emma played an important role in helping to put an end to the revolution when she arrived near Naples with Nelson&#x27;s fleet on 24 June 1799. She acted as a go-between, conveying messages from the queen to Nelson and from Nelson to the queen.

==Life in London and at Merton==
Nelson&#x27;s recall to Britain shortly afterwards coincided with the government finally granting Hamilton&#x27;s request for relief from his post in Naples. Emma must have become pregnant around April 1800. Nelson, Emma, her mother and William travelled together—taking the longest possible route back to Britain via Central Europe (hearing the &quot;Missa in Angustiis&quot; by Joseph Haydn, now known as the &quot;Nelson Mass&quot;, in Vienna in 1800 and meeting the composer as well in the Esterhazy palace in Eisenstadt). They eventually arrived in Yarmouth to a hero&#x27;s welcome on 6 November 1800.

Upon arrival in London on 8 November, the three of them took suites at Nerot&#x27;s Hotel after a missed communication from Nelson to his wife about receiving the party at their home, Roundwood. Lady Nelson and Nelson&#x27;s father arrived and they all dined at the hotel. Nelson&#x27;s wife Fanny was deeply unhappy to see Emma pregnant. The affair soon became public knowledge and, much to the delight of the newspapers, Fanny did not accept the affair as placidly as Sir William. Emma was winning the media war at that point, and every fine lady was experimenting with her &quot;look.&quot; Nelson himself contributed to his wife Fanny&#x27;s misery by being cruel to her when not in Emma&#x27;s company. Emma&#x27;s husband, Sir William, was mercilessly lampooned in the press. However, his sister observed that he doted on Emma and she was very attached to him.

The Hamiltons moved into William Beckford&#x27;s mansion at 22 Grosvenor Square, and Nelson and Fanny took an expensive furnished house at 17 Dover Street, a comfortable walking distance away, until December, when Sir William rented a home at 23 Piccadilly, opposite Green Park. On 1 January, Nelson&#x27;s promotion to vice admiral was confirmed and he prepared to go to sea on the same night. After his departure on 13 January, he sent Fanny a few brief and hostile letters (many of which she burned) before finally cutting her off in March. He never saw her again after being hustled out of town by an agent. While he was at sea, Nelson and Emma exchanged many letters, using a secret code to discuss Emma&#x27;s condition. Emma kept her first daughter Emma Carew&#x27;s existence a secret from Nelson, and Sir William continued to provide for her.

===Birth of Horatia===
On 29 January 1801 at 23 Piccadilly, Emma gave birth to Nelson&#x27;s daughter Horatia, who was taken soon afterwards to a Mrs Gibson for care and hire of a wet nurse. On 1 February, Emma made a spectacular appearance at a concert at the house of the Duke of Norfolk in St James&#x27; Square, and Emma worked hard to keep the press onside.

Soon after this, the Prince of Wales (later King George IV) became infatuated with Emma, leading Nelson to be consumed by jealousy, and inspiring a remarkable letter by Sir William to Nelson, assuring him that she was being faithful. In late February, Nelson returned to London and met his daughter at Mrs Gibson&#x27;s. Nelson&#x27;s family were aware of the pregnancy, and his clergyman brother Rev. William Nelson wrote to Emma praising her virtue and goodness. Nelson and Emma continued to write letters to each other when he was away at sea, all of which she kept. While he was away too, she arranged for her mother to visit the Kidds in Hawarden and her daughter in Manchester.

By the autumn of the same year, upon Emma&#x27;s advice, Nelson bought Merton Place, a small ramshackle house at Merton, near Wimbledon, for £9,000, borrowing money from his friend Davison. He gave her free rein with spending to improve the property, and her vision was to transform the house into a celebration of his genius. There they lived together openly, with Sir William and Emma&#x27;s mother, in a ménage à trois that fascinated the public. Emma turned herself to winning over Nelson&#x27;s family, nursing his 80-year-old father Edmund for 10 days at Merton, who loved her and thought of moving into the home with them, but he could not bear to leave his beloved Norfolk. Emma also made herself useful to Nelson&#x27;s sisters Kitty (Catherine), married to George Matcham, and Susanna, married to Thomas Bolton, by helping to raise their children and to make ends meet. Nelson&#x27;s sister-in-law Sarah (married to William), also pressed him for assistance and favours, including the payment of their son Horatio&#x27;s school fees at Eton. Around this time, Emma finally told Nelson about her daughter Emma Carew, now known as Emma Hartley, and found that she had had nothing to worry about; he invited her to stay at Merton and soon grew fond of &quot;Emma&#x27;s relative&quot;. An unpublished letter shows that Nelson assumed responsibility for upkeep of young Emma at this time. Emma continued to display her attitudes to audiences, and at this point of her life grew obese and her drinking intensified. In April 13, Joseph Farington wrote in his diary;

After the Treaty of Amiens on 25 March 1802, Nelson was released from active service, but wanted to keep his new-found position in society by maintaining an aura of wealth, and Emma worked hard to live up to this dream. Nelson&#x27;s father became seriously ill in April, but Nelson did not visit him in Norfolk, staying home to celebrate Emma&#x27;s 37th birthday on the very day Edmund died; the son did not attend his father&#x27;s funeral.

===Death of Sir William===
The newspapers reported on their every move, including trips to Wales to inspect Sir William&#x27;s estates and a holiday to Ramsgate intended to give him some peace and quiet, looking to Emma to set fashions in dress, home decoration and even dinner party menus. By the autumn of 1803, Sir William&#x27;s health was declining, at the same time that the peace with France was disintegrating. A &quot;Children&#x27;s Ball&quot; was thrown after New Year, in honour of Horatia, and a concert for 100 guests staged in February.

Soon afterwards, Sir William collapsed at 23 Piccadilly and on 6 April died in Emma&#x27;s arms. Charles Greville was the executor of the estate and he instructed her to leave 23 Piccadilly, but for the sake of respectability, she had to keep an address separate from Nelson&#x27;s and so moved into 11 Clarges Street, not far away, a couple of months later. The artist Le Brun, who visited Emma in 1802, remarked that Emma did not seem convincingly moved by her husband&#x27;s death, and had &#x27;grown horribly fat&#x27; in this point of time (the last time they had met was in Naples, when Nelson was courting Emma).

Nelson had been offered the position of commander-in-chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, and they rushed to have Horatia christened at Marylebone Parish Church before he left. On her baptism record, her name was recorded as Horatia Nelson Thompson, and her date of birth falsely recorded as 29 October 1800 in order to continue the pretence that she had been born in Naples and was godchild of Emma and Nelson, according to Kate Williams and based on an unpublished letter; however the only publicly available transcription of the record shows 29 October 1801. Nelson later wrote a letter explaining that the child was an orphan &quot;left to his care and protection&quot; in Naples.

Emma planned, paid for and hosted the wedding of Nelson&#x27;s niece Kitty Bolton (daughter of Susanna) and her cousin Captain Sir William Bolton (Nelson&#x27;s sister Susanna&#x27;s husband&#x27;s brother&#x27;s son) at 23 Piccadilly on 18 May 1803, the same day as Nelson&#x27;s early morning departure to fight in the Napoleonic Wars, leaving Emma pregnant with their second child (although neither knew it at this time). The marriage was witnessed by Charlotte Mary Nelson (the daughter of Nelson&#x27;s brother William) and Emma Hartley (Emma&#x27;s daughter Emma Carew).

===Nelson at sea again===

She was desperately lonely, preoccupied with attempting to turn Merton Place into the grand home Nelson desired, suffering from several ailments and frantic for his return. The child, a girl (reportedly named Emma), died about 6 weeks after her birth in early 1804, and Horatia became ill at her home with Mrs Gibson on Titchfield Street. Emma kept the infant&#x27;s death a secret from the press (her burial is unrecorded), kept her deep grief from Nelson&#x27;s family and found it increasingly difficult to cope alone. She reportedly distracted herself by gambling, and succumbed to binges of heavy drinking and eating and spending lavishly.

Emma received several marriage proposals during 1804, all wealthy men, but she was still in love with Nelson and believed that he would become wealthy with prize money and leave her rich in his will, and she refused them all. She continued to entertain and help Nelson&#x27;s relatives, especially William and Sarah&#x27;s &quot;obstreperous son Horace&quot; and their daughter Charlotte, who was referred to as Emma&#x27;s &quot;foster daughter&quot; in a letter. Nelson urged her to keep Horatia at Merton, and when his return seemed imminent in 1804, Emma ran up bills on furnishing and decorating Merton. Five-year-old Horatia came to live at Merton in May 1805. There were reports that she took holidays with Emma Carew.

But there still remained one problem: Fanny. As long as Fanny lived Emma could not marry Nelson. This increasingly got on Emma&#x27;s nerves and on on July 24, 1804 she wrote Davison:

On October 30, that same year she signed one of her letters off to Davison, &quot;I am ever your affectionate Emma. I would say N. but I am afraid such happiness and honour is not in store for me for She will never burst.&quot;

After a brief visit to England in August 1805, Nelson once again had to return to service. Emma received letters from him on 1, 7 and 13 October. On the ship, he wrote a note intended as a codicil to his will requesting that, in return for his legacy to King and Country that they should give Emma &quot;ample provision to maintain her rank in life&quot;, and that his &quot;adopted daughter, Horatia Nelson Thompson...use in future the name of Nelson only&quot;.

===Nelson&#x27;s death===
On 21 October 1805, Nelson&#x27;s fleet defeated a joint Franco-Spanish naval force at the Battle of Trafalgar. Nelson was seriously wounded during the battle and died three hours later. When the news of his death arrived in London, a messenger was sent to Merton Place to bring the news to Lady Hamilton. She later recalled, They brought me word, Mr Whitby from the Admiralty. &#x27;Show him in directly,&#x27; I said. He came in, and with a pale countenance and faint voice, said, &#x27;We have gained a great Victory.&#x27; – &#x27;Never mind your Victory,&#x27; I said. &#x27;My letters – give me my letters&#x27; – Captain Whitby was unable to speak – tears in his eyes and a deathly paleness over his face made me comprehend him. I believe I gave a scream and fell back, and for ten hours I could neither speak nor shed a tear.

Emma lay in bed prostrate with grief for many weeks, often receiving visitors in tears. It was some weeks before she heard that Nelson&#x27;s last words were of her and that he had begged the nation to take care of her and Horatia. After Nelson&#x27;s brother William and his wife Sarah distanced themselves from her (William being elated upon hearing that Nelson had not changed his will), she relied on Nelson&#x27;s sisters (Kitty Matcham and Susanna Bolton) for moral support and company. Like her, the Boltons and Matchams had spent lavishly in expectation of Nelson&#x27;s victorious return, and Emma gave them and other of his friends and relations money.

==Final years==

Nelson&#x27;s will was read in November; William inherited his entire estate (including Bronte) except for Merton, as well as his bank accounts and possessions. The government had made William an Earl and his son Horatio (also known as Horace) a Viscount – the titles Nelson had aspired to – and now he was also Duke of Bronte. Emma received £2000, Merton, and £500 per annum from the Bronte estate – much less than she had when Nelson was alive, and not enough to maintain Merton. In spite of Nelson&#x27;s status as a national hero, the instructions he left to the government to provide for Emma and Horatia were ignored; they also ignored his wishes that she should sing at his funeral.

The funeral was lavish, costing the state £14,000, but Emma was excluded. Only the men of the Bolton and Matcham family were invited, and Emma spent the day with her family and the women. She gave both families dinner and breakfast and accommodated the Boltons.

After the funeral, the begging letters began. William would not help, so everybody turned to Emma. Lord Grenville sent the codicil to Nelson&#x27;s will to his solicitor with a note saying that nothing could be done; instead, the Boltons and Matchams received £10,000 each (but still left their adolescent daughters with Emma to educate), while William was awarded £100,000 to buy an estate called Trafalgar as well as £5000 for life.

Relations between William and Emma became strained, and he refused to give her the £500 pension due to her. Emma was especially hurt by Lady Charlotte&#x27;s rebuff, partly because she had spent about £2000 paying for her education, clothes, presents and holidays and because she had grown fond of her.

She spent 1806 to 1808 keeping up the act, continuing to spend on parties and alterations to Merton to make it a monument to Nelson. Goods that Nelson had ordered arrived and had to be paid for. The annual annuity of £800 from Sir William&#x27;s estate was not enough to pay off the debts and keep up the lifestyle, and Emma fell deeply into debt.

She moved from Clarges Street to a cheaper home at 136 Bond Street, but could not bring herself to relinquish Merton. Her brother, William, blackmailed her into giving him money, and Mrs Cadogan&#x27;s sister&#x27;s family, the Connors, were expecting handouts. Emma Carew came for a short summer visit in late June 1806, at which point Sir Harry Fetherstonhaugh sent £500 for the benefit of mother and daughter. Emma hosted and employed James Harrison for six months to write a two-volume &quot;Life of Nelson&quot;, which made it clear that Horatia was his child. She continued to entertain at Merton, including the prince of Wales and the dukes of Sussex and Clarence, but no favours were returned by the royals.

Within three years, Emma was more than £15,000 in debt. In June 1808, Merton failed to sell at auction. She was not completely without friends; her neighbours had rallied, and Sir John Perring hosted a group of influential financiers to help organise her finances and sell Merton. It was eventually sold in April 1809. However, her lavish spending continued, and a combination of this and the steady depletion of funds due to people fleecing her meant that she remained in debt, although unbeknownst to most people. Her mother, Mrs Cadogan, died in January 1810. For most of 1811 and 1812 she was in a virtual debtors&#x27; prison, and in December 1812 either chose to commit herself (her name does not appear in the record books) or was sentenced to a prison sentence at the King&#x27;s Bench Prison in Southwark, although she was not kept in a cell but allowed to live in rooms nearby with Horatia, per the system whereby genteel prisoners could buy the rights to live &quot;within the Rules&quot;, a three-square-mile area around the prison.

In early 1813, she petitioned the prince of Wales, the government and friends, but all of her requests failed, and she was obliged to have an auction of many of her possessions, including many Nelson relics, at low prices. However she continued to borrow money to maintain appearances. Public opinion turned against her after the &quot;Letters of Lord Nelson to Lady Hamilton&quot; were published in April 1814.

Emma was anxious to leave the country, but owing to the risk of arrest if she travelled on a normal ferry, she and Horatia hid from her creditors for a week before boarding a private vessel bound for Calais on 1 July 1814, with £50 in her purse. Initially taking apartments at the expensive Dessein&#x27;s Hotel, she initially maintained a social life and fine dining by relying on creditors. Her old housekeeper, Dame Francis, came to run the household and hired other servants. However soon she was deeply in debt and suffered from longstanding health problems, including stomach pains, nausea and diarrhoea. She turned to the Roman Catholic church and joined the St Pierre congregation.

==Death==
In November, they moved into a cheap flat at 27 Rue Française; Emma started drinking heavily and taking laudanum. She died on 15 January 1815, aged 49. Emma was buried in Calais on 21 January in public ground outside the town, with her friend Joshua Smith paying for a modest funeral at the local Catholic church. Her grave was subsequently lost due to wartime destruction, but in 1994 a dedicated group unveiled the memorial which stands today in the Parc Richelieu in her honour.

Lady Hamilton&#x27;s death incentivized her creditors to submit an application to Robert Fulke Greville, the trustee of her annuity and the person she sought for financial assistance. To enable the creditor to collect his reward, Greville got a copy of the death certificate from the Calais Mairie. Colonel &quot;Wellbred&quot; as he was called finally closed all his former aunt in law&#x27;s debts.

Henry Cadogan cared for the 14-year-old Horatia in the aftermath of Emma&#x27;s death and paid for her travel to Dover. The Matchams took her in to care for their younger children until she was sent to live with the Boltons two years later, Susanna having died in 1813. Horatia subsequently married the Rev. Philip Ward, had 10 children (the first of whom was named Horatio Nelson), and lived until 1881. Horatia never publicly acknowledged that she was the daughter of Emma Hamilton.

Jason M. Kelly summarized her: &quot;In a world of aristocratic privilege and powerful men, her common birth and gender ultimately circumscribed her options&quot;.

==Honours and heraldry==
Emma Hamilton is generally known by the courtesy title of Lady Hamilton, to which she was entitled from 1791 as the wife and then widow of Sir William Hamilton. In 1800, she became &quot;Dame Emma Hamilton&quot;, a title she held in her own right as a female member of the Order of Malta. This was an unusual honour, awarded to Lady Hamilton by the then Grand Master of the Order, Tsar Paul, in recognition of her role in the defence of the island of Malta against the French.

Subsequently, she used her new title in formal circumstances, and was acknowledged as Dame Emma Hamilton in official British contexts; most notably, this was the title under which she was formally granted her own coat of arms by the English College of Arms in 1806, &quot;Per pale Or and Argent, three Lions rampant Gules, on a chief Sable, a Cross of eight points of the second&quot;. The lions evidently refer to her maiden surname of Lyons, and the addition of the Maltese Cross, which has puzzled heraldic scholars unaware of her connection to the Order.

<text>Publius Quinctilius Varus (Cremona, 46 BC – near Kalkriese, AD 9) was a Roman general and politician under the first Roman emperor Augustus. Varus is generally remembered for having lost three Roman legions when ambushed by a coalition of Germanic tribes led by Arminius, the chieftain of the Cherusci tribe in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest, where he committed suicide to avoid capture and shameful reproach.

==Background and early career==
Although he was a patrician by birth, his family, the Quinctilii Vari, had long been impoverished and was unimportant; Ronald Syme notes, &quot;The sole and last consul of that family&quot;, Sextus Quinctilius, &quot;had been two years antecedent to the Decemvirs&quot; (i.e. 453 BC). His father, Sextus Quinctilius Varus, was a senator who had served as a quaestor in 49 BC. This Sextus aligned with the Senatorial Party in the civil war against Julius Caesar. Although Sextus survived the defeat, it is unknown whether he was involved in the assassination of Julius Caesar. Sextus killed himself after the Battle of Philippi in 42 BC. The mother of Varus is unknown; Syme notes that &quot;no relatives on either side of the family can be discovered or surmised.&quot;

Varus had three sisters, all named Quinctilia. They were probably all younger based on when they started having children, so it seems likely he was born at least four years before his father&#x27;s suicide. The fact that they had advantageous marriages indicates someone was involved in their upbringing. One sister married Publius Cornelius Dolabella, consul of 35 BC; another married Sextus Appuleius, consul of 29 BC; and the third married Lucius Nonius Asprenas, son of the consul of 36 BC.

Despite his father&#x27;s political allegiances, Varus became a supporter of Julius Caesar&#x27;s heir, Octavian. Varus accompanied Augustus on a three-year tour of the eastern provinces between 22 BC and 19 BC, winning public acknowledgement while he was there. Around 15 BC, Varus spent a year or more serving as the legate of the 19th Legion while it was stationed at Dangstetten, as evidenced by a luggage-tag bearing his name and position excavated from the site. When Marcus Vipsanius Agrippa died in early 12 BC, Varus delivered the funeral eulogy alongside the future emperor Tiberius. With his political career thus boosted, he was elected consul in 13 BC as the colleague of Tiberius.

==Marriages and children==
Varus married Vipsania, daughter of Agrippa, at an unknown date before 13 BC. Varus became a personal friend to Marcus Agrippa and Tiberius. The historian Josephus says (in a section of his &quot;Antiquities&quot; whose manuscript tradition Walther John believed to be corrupt) that the son of Varus, also named &quot;Publius Quinctilius Varus&quot;, served under him during his command in Syria. If true, that son would have to be a son by a prior marriage and not the son by his last wife, Claudia Pulchra. It is possible that this son might have instead been an older son, Sextus Nonius Quinctilianus, who might have ended up adopted by his sister&#x27;s husband after Varus and Vipsania died. That would explain why a son of Lucius Nonius Asprenas was named &quot;Quinctilianus&quot;, which implied adoption.

Vipsania disappears from history. It is unknown whether she died or was divorced. Varus then married Claudia Pulchra. She was a daughter of Claudia Marcella Minor and the Roman consul of 12 BC, Marcus Valerius Messalla Appianus. Her maternal grandmother was Octavia the Younger, sister of Augustus. Hence she was a grand-niece of Augustus. His marriage to Pulchra shows that Varus still enjoyed political favor. Pulchra bore Varus a son, also called Publius Quinctilius Varus. Through their son, they may have had further descendants.

==Political career==

In 8–7 BC, Varus governed the province of Africa. Later he went to govern Syria and Judaea in the Levant from 7–6 BC until 4 BC with four legions under his command, where he was known for his harsh rule and high taxes. The Roman-Jewish historian Josephus mentions the swift action of Varus against a messianic revolt after the death of the Roman client king, Herod the Great in 4 BC. After occupying Jerusalem, he crucified 2000 Judeans, making him one of the prime objects of popular resentment against Rome in Judaea .

Per archeological evidence, the people of Judaea begun &quot;en masse&quot; a popular full-scale boycott of Roman pottery (red slip ware), in protest of Varus&#x27; cruelty. Following the massacre, Varus returned to Antioch. Between 10 BC and 6 AD Tiberius, his brother Drusus, Lucius Domitius Ahenobarbus, and Germanicus conducted long campaigns in Germania, the area north of the Upper Danube and east of the Rhine, in an attempt at achieving a further major expansion of the Roman Empire together with a shortening of its frontier line. They subdued several Germanic tribes, such as the Cherusci. In 6 AD, Tiberius declared Germania pacified, and Varus was appointed to govern it. Tiberius, who would later rule as emperor, left the region to suppress the Great Illyrian Revolt. Augustus made Publius Quinctilius Varus the first &quot;officially appointed&quot; governor of the newly created Roman province of Germania in 7 AD.

==Battle of the Teutoburg Forest and death==
In September 9 AD Varus was preparing to leave his summer headquarters in Vetera (today Xanten) and march three legions – the Seventeenth, Eighteenth, and Nineteenth – with him to Moguntiacum (modern-day Mainz), when news arrived from the Germanic prince Arminius (a Roman citizen and leader of an auxiliary cavalry unit) of a growing revolt in the Rhine area to the West. Ignoring a warning from Segestes not to trust Arminius, Varus marched his forces behind the latter&#x27;s lead.

Not only was Varus&#x27; trust in Arminius a terrible misjudgement, but Varus compounded it by placing his legions in a position where their fighting strengths would be minimized and those of the Germanic tribesmen maximized – because he expected no ambush and very little trouble in intimidating the rebels. Arminius and the Cherusci tribe along with other allies, had skillfully laid an ambush, and in the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest in September at Kalkriese (East of modern Osnabrück), the Romans marched right into it.

The heavily forested, swampy terrain made the infantry manoeuvres of the legions impossible to execute and allowed the Germans to defeat the legions in detail. On the third day of fighting, the Germans overwhelmed the Romans at Kalkriese Hill, north of Osnabrück. Accounts of the defeat are scarce, due to the totality of the defeat, but Velleius Paterculus testifies that some Roman cavalrymen abandoned the infantry and fled towards the Rhine, but they were intercepted by the German tribesmen and killed. Varus himself, upon seeing all hope was lost, took his own life by falling on his sword. Arminius cut off his head and sent it to Bohemia as a present to King Marbod of the Marcomanni, the other most important Germanic leader, whom Arminius hoped to coax into an anti-Roman military alliance, but Marbod declined the offer and sent the head on to Rome for burial.

Some captured Romans were caged and burned alive; others were enslaved or ransomed. Tacitus and Florus report that the victorious Germanic tribes tortured and sacrificed captive officers to their gods on altars that could still be seen years later. The Roman army later recovered the lost legions&#x27; eagles, one each under Germanicus in 15 AD, 16 AD and 42 AD.

==Aftermath==
Due to the shame and the ill luck thought to be created by the Roman defeat, the XVII, XVIII and XIX legions never again appeared in the Roman Army&#x27;s order of battle. The loss at the Teutoburg Forest was keenly felt by Augustus in his remaining years. According to the biographer Suetonius, upon hearing the news, Augustus tore his clothes, refused to cut his hair for months and, for years afterwards, was heard, upon occasion, to yell, &quot;Quinctilius Varus, give me back my legions!&quot; (). Roman historians referred to the battle as the &quot;clades Variana&quot; (&quot;Varian disaster&quot;).

Gibbon describes Augustus&#x27; reaction to the defeat as one of the few times the normally stoic ruler lost his composure. Varus&#x27; political legacy in Rome was destroyed and the government blamed him for the defeat. His son&#x27;s (the younger Varus) chances for a political career were ruined. Tiberius himself fell under severe criticism for recommending Varus as the governor of Germania. Tiberius, according to Gaius Stern, was forced to sacrifice his friend and former brother-in-law to save his career. Furthermore, Varus himself had been one of the figures on the Ara Pacis, but the figure is lost today.

Stern has proposed that common citizens vandalized the Ara Pacis by damaging Varus in anger over their lost loved ones, leaving the regime, which had blamed Varus, uncertain as to whether or not to fix the damage. Approximately 40 years after Varus&#x27; death, a general under Claudius, Pomponius Secundus, raided Germany and by chance rescued a few POWs from Varus&#x27; army. Claudius welcomed them home after their long captivity, their stories arousing much pity.

==Cultural depictions==

*&quot;I, Claudius&quot; (1934) by Robert Graves, a novelization of the reigns of the first four emperors. Varus does not actually appear in the novel, but his defeat by the Germans is an important event.
*&quot;The Iron Hand of Mars&quot; (1994) by Lindsey Davis; fourth book of the mystery series set during the reign of Vespasian, a portion of the novel occurs in the Teutoburger Wald.
*&quot;Give Me Back My Legions!&quot; (2009) by Harry Turtledove, which details the events leading up to the battle, including a great deal of background information on Varus himself.
*&quot;Undying Mercenaries&quot; (2014) by B. V. Larson, a series set in 2099, in which the main character fights with the Earth Mercenary Legion Varus. Much of the legion&#x27;s culture and structure sources from Roman history and general Varus&#x27;s life.
*&quot;Schlammschlacht&quot; (2015) by Heilung, track four on their first album &quot;Ofnir&quot;. The poem describes the Battle of the Teutoburg Forest from the Cherusci point of view.
*Varus is played by Gaetano Aronica in the 2020 Netflix series &quot;Barbarians&quot;.

<text>&quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; is a poem written in 1917 by Wilfred Owen. It incorporates the theme of the horror of war.

==Style==
Like a traditional Petrarchan sonnet, the poem is divided into an octave and sestet. However, its rhyme scheme is neither that of a Petrarchan nor English sonnet, but irregular: ABABCDCD:EFFEGG. Even its indentations are irregular, not following its own rhyme scheme.

Much of the second half of the poem is dedicated to funeral rituals suffered by those families deeply affected by the First World War. The poem does this by following the sorrow of common soldiers in trench warfare, perhaps the battle of the Somme, or Passchendaele. Written between September and October 1917, when Owen was a patient at Craiglockhart War Hospital in Edinburgh recovering from shell shock, the poem is a lament for young soldiers who died in the European War. The poem is also a comment on Owen&#x27;s rejection of his religion in 1915.

==Composition==
While in the hospital, Owen met and became close friends with another poet, Siegfried Sassoon. Owen asked for his assistance in refining his poems&#x27; rough drafts. It was Sassoon who named the start of the poem &quot;anthem&quot;, and who also substituted &quot;dead&quot;, on the original article, with &quot;doomed&quot;; the famous epithet of &quot;patient minds&quot; is also a correction of his. The amended manuscript copy, in both men&#x27;s handwriting, still exists and may be found at the Wilfred Owen Manuscript Archive on the World Wide Web. The revision process for the poem was fictionalized by Pat Barker in her novel &quot;Regeneration&quot;.

It is possible that Owen chose the expression &#x27;passing bells&#x27; as a way of reply to the following anonymous prefatory note of the 1916 volume of &quot;Poems of Today&quot;, which was in his possession: &quot;This book has been compiled in order that boys and girls, already perhaps familiar with the great classics of the English speech, may also know something of the newer poetry of their own day. Most of the writers are living, and the rest are still vivid memories among us, while one of the youngest, almost as these words are written, has gone singing to lay down his life for his country&#x27;s cause... There is no arbitrary isolation of one theme from another; they mingle and interpenetrate throughout, to the music of Pan&#x27;s flute, and of Love&#x27;s viol, and the bugle-call of Endeavour, and the passing-bells of Death.&quot;

==Legacy==
The poem is among those set in the &quot;War Requiem&quot; of Benjamin Britten.

During live performances of the song &quot;Paschendale&quot;, Iron Maiden singer Bruce Dickinson often recites the first half of the poem.

The title of BBC WW1 drama &quot;The Passing Bells&quot; derives from the first line of the poem: &quot;What passing-bells for these who die as cattle?&quot;

The third album by British band The Libertines is named &quot;Anthems for Doomed Youth&quot;, and features a song of the same name.

American composer Stephen Whitehead included an orchestral setting of &quot;Anthem for Doomed Youth&quot; as a movement in his orchestral piece &quot;Three Laments on the Great War&quot; for soloists and orchestra. The piece is scored as a duet for mezzo-soprano and bass/baritone with orchestra.

<text>The Napoleonic era is a period in the history of France and Europe. It is generally classified as including the fourth and final stage of the French Revolution, the first being the National Assembly, the second being the Legislative Assembly, and the third being the French Directory. The Napoleonic era begins roughly with Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s &quot;coup d&#x27;état&quot; on 18 Brumaire, overthrowing the Directory (9 November 1799), establishing the French Consulate, and ends during the Hundred Days and his defeat at the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815).

The Congress of Vienna soon set out to restore Europe to pre-French Revolution days. Napoleon brought political stability to a land torn by revolution and war. He made peace with the Catholic Church and reversed the most radical religious policies of the National Convention. In 1804, Napoleon promulgated the Civil Code, a revised body of civil law, which also helped stabilize French society. The Civil Code affirmed the political and legal equality of all adult men and established a merit-based society in which individuals advanced in education and employment because of talent rather than birth or social standing. The Civil Code confirmed many of the moderate revolutionary policies of the National Assembly but retracted measures passed by the more radical Convention. The Civil Code restored patriarchal authority in the family, for example by making women and children subservient to male heads of households.

Whilst working to stabilise France, Napoleon sought to extend his authority throughout Europe. Napoleon&#x27;s armies conquered the Iberian and Italian peninsulas, occupied lands, and he forced Austria, Prussia, and Russia to ally with him and respect French hegemony in Europe. The United Kingdom refused to recognize French hegemony and continued the war throughout.

The First French Empire began to unravel in 1812, when he decided to invade Russia. Napoleon underestimated the difficulties his army would have to face whilst occupying Russia. Convinced that the Tsar was conspiring with his British enemies, Napoleon led an army of 600,000 soldiers to Moscow. He defeated the Russian army at Borodino before capturing Moscow, but the Tsar withdrew and Moscow was set ablaze, leaving Napoleon&#x27;s vast army without adequate shelter or supplies. Napoleon ordered a retreat, but the bitter Russian winter and repeated Russian attacks whittled down his army, and only a battered remnant of 30,000 soldiers managed to limp back to French territory. The allies then continued a united effort against Napoleon until they had seized Paris forcing his abdication in 1814. His return to power the next year was resisted by all the allies and his army was defeated by a Prussian and Anglo-Allied force at Waterloo.

<text>A sex show is a form of live performance that features one or more performers engaging in some form of sexual activity on stage for the entertainment or sexual gratification of spectators. Performers are paid either by the spectators or by the organisers of the show.

==Content==

A performance can include actual or simulated autoerotic acts and/or sexual activity with another performer. The performance can be in a theater style, or it can be in a peep show style. An increasingly popular form of sex show is a webcam performance in which the viewer is able to view and interact with webcam models in real time.

Sex shows are distinguished from entertainment such as striptease, pole dancing and lap dance, which do not involve sexual activity other than undressing and dancing nude or semi-nude. Sexual activity at sex shows is also distinguished from regular prostitution in that the performers usually engage in sex acts only with other performers and not with spectators or paying customers. Sex shows can overlap with other sectors of the sex industry. For example, a strip club may also offer live sex performances, and a prostitute may offer to perform sex acts with another prostitute for the gratification of a patron.

==Locations==

In Havana, Cuba, in the 1950s, during the second presidency of Fulgencio Batista, there were semi-legal sex shows and live pornographic theaters, such as the Shanghai Theater and the Tokyo Cabaret. The English novelist Graham Greene, writing in his autobiography &quot;Ways of Escape&quot;, described &quot;the Shanghai Theatre where for one dollar and twenty-five cents one could see a nude cabaret of extreme obscenity with the bluest of blue films in the intervals&quot;.

During the 1960s and 1970s, the Laotian capital Vientiane was famous for sex shows at ping pong show bars during the Vietnam War. Travel writer Paul Theroux described a bar in 1973 Vientiane thus: “Your eyes get accustomed to the dark and you see the waitress is naked. Without warning she jumps on the chair, pokes a cigarette into her vagina and lights it, puffing it by contracting her uterine lungs.&quot; British journalist Christopher Robbins wrote that &quot;The White Rose&quot;, a famous Vientiane bar during the war, featured floor shows in which women used their vaginas to smoke cigarettes and fling ping pong balls.

Around the Reeperbahn, the red-light district of Hamburg, several sex theatres (&quot;Salambo&quot;, &quot;Regina&quot;, &quot;Colibri&quot;, &quot;Safari&quot;) were once located in the &quot;&quot; (&quot;Great Freedom&quot;) street. They showed live sex acts on stage, but by 2007, the &quot;Safari&quot; was the only live sex theatre left in Germany, and that closed in 2013.

In the red light district of De Wallen in Amsterdam there are three main venues for sex shows: a hostess bar called the &quot;Bananen Bar&quot;, and the &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and &quot;Casa Rosso&quot; theatres, which feature on-stage sex acts and variations on the ping-pong show. &quot;Casa Rosso&quot; puts on 90-minute sex shows which are made up of nine different performances. The acts include a woman smoking a cigar using her vagina, a dominatrix who humiliates a volunteer from the audience, and a couple having sex on a rotating stage. 

In Thailand, locations like Patpong in Bangkok, Walking Street, Pattaya, Bangla Road in Phuket and Ta Pae Gate in Chiang Mai have numerous venues hosting ping-pong shows. The expression &quot;going to Bangkok&quot; sometimes serves as a euphemism in the West for &quot;going to a live sex show&quot;.

==Legality==
Sex shows are subject to varying laws such as licensing requirements and locations are subject to local zoning regulations. Some jurisdictions regard a sex show as prostitution. The content of a sex show may also be subject to national and local obscenity and other laws. Some areas allow striptease, but no sexual activity, others may allow only simulated sexual activity or autoerotic activity, while others allow anything that is legal in recorded pornography to be performed live. Generally, as of 2010, autoerotic activity is the most common legally-available kind of live sexual activity. In some cities and countries throughout the world, live sexual activity between multiple performers is legal. Webcam performances are largely unregulated.

<text>Seminyak is a mixed tourist residential area on the west coast of Bali in Indonesia, just north of Kuta and Legian.

Originally a separate township, this is now another suburb of Kuta. This area is very popular with resident expatriates; land and accommodation prices are amongst the highest in Bali. Plenty of luxury spas and hotels abound. Owing to its high density of high-end shopping, combined with the clustering of many fine eating establishments, it has rapidly become one of the most well-known tourist areas on the island.

In addition to a few commercial strips with popular and lively restaurants, bars, villas, and good crafts/furniture shops there is at least one hotel.

Jalan Raya Seminyak (more often referred to as Jalan Legian), runs parallel with the beach, bisecting the district and acts as its main road artery.

<doc id="242224" wikidata="Q1434222" url="?curid=242224" title="River Medway">
<text>The River Medway is a river in South East England. It rises in the High Weald, West Sussex and flows through Tonbridge, Maidstone and the Medway conurbation in Kent, before emptying into the Thames Estuary near Sheerness, a total distance of . About of the river lies in East Sussex, with the remainder being in Kent.

The Medway has a catchment area of , the second largest in southern England after the Thames. The map opposite shows only the major tributaries: a more detailed map shows the extensive network of smaller streams feeding into the main river. Those tributaries rise from points along the North Downs, the Weald and Ashdown Forest.

==Tributaries==
The major tributaries are:

* River Eden
* River Bourne, known in the past as the Shode or Busty
* River Teise, major sub-tributary River Bewl
* River Beult
* Loose Stream
* River Len

Minor tributaries include:
* Wateringbury Stream
* East Malling Stream
*River Grom

Former minor tributaries include the Old Bourne River, which flowed through the Brook, Chatham (not to be confused with the main tributary River Bourne).

The river and its tributaries flow through largely rural areas, Tonbridge, Maidstone and Medway being the exceptions. The Medway itself initially flows in a west–east direction south of the North Downs; at the confluence of the River Beult, however, it turns north and breaks through the North Downs at the Medway Gap, a steep and narrow valley near Rochester, before its final section to the sea.

Until 1746, the river was not navigable above Maidstone. Below that point each village on the river had its wharf or wharves: at Halling, Snodland, New Hythe and Aylesford. Cargoes included corn, fodder, fruit, stone and timber.

In 1746, improvements to the channel meant that barges of could reach East Farleigh, Yalding and even Tonbridge. In 1828, the channel was further improved up to Leigh. There are eleven locks on the river. The lowest, opened in 1792, is at Allington, and is the tidal limit. The others are at East Farleigh, Teston, Hampstead Lane, Stoneham Old Lock (disused), Sluice Weir Lock, Oak Weir Lock, East Lock, Porter&#x27;s, Eldridge&#x27;s and Town Lock in Tonbridge. The locks will take craft up to by , and vessels with a draft of can navigate the river. The shallowest point is just below Sluice Weir Lock, which is prone to silting after heavy rain.

Small craft such as canoes can sometimes travel as far as Penshurst. The stretch from Leigh to Allington is known as the Medway Navigation, and is in length. The Environment Agency is the navigation authority.

== Estuary ==

Downstream of the Medway bridges (M2, HS1) the river comprises a sequence of tidal reaches:

* Wickham Reach
* Tower Reach
* Bridge Reach
* Limehouse Reach
* Chatham Reach
* Upnor Reach
* Short Reach
* Gillingham Reach
* Pinup Reach
* Long Reach
* Kethole Reach
* Saltpan Reach

===Stangate Creek===

One of the channels on the southern side of the estuary, Stangate Creek, is the subject of a painting by William Turner. In a location described as &quot;opposite the Isle of Grain, Sharpfleet Creek, and the lower-end of the Hope&quot;, a quarantine site for ships was proclaimed on 16 September 1709, during an outbreak of the plague. The area had been leased to oyster fisherman, so compensation was paid to them. Nearly 150 ships quarantined there in the first six months of 1712, and the site was again used between 1721 and 1743.

In 1918 to 1920, damages were sought for damage done to an oyster fishery in Stangate Creek.

==River crossings==

Until recently the lowest public crossing of the Medway was at Rochester, where there has been a bridge since Roman times. In the 14th century the Wardens and Commonalty of Rochester Bridge were instituted by Sir John de Cobham to pay for the rebuilding and upkeep of the bridge. Until 1963 the nearest crossing to Rochester Bridge was the 14th-century bridge at Aylesford, upstream. Since then the following additional crossings have come into use:
* 1963: A viaduct over the river was built south of Rochester to carry the first section of the M2 motorway. In 2003 this was widened to two separate spans.
* Between 1963 and 1996 the M20 was built, with a bridge over the Medway south of Aylesford.
* 1996: The Medway Tunnel became the river&#x27;s lowest public crossing, connecting Gillingham to Strood. The four-lane tunnel was constructed using the immersed tube method, and was partially paid for by Rochester Bridge Trust, the successor to the Wardens and Commonalty.
* 2003: A railway bridge long, with a central span of , was constructed for High Speed 1. The railway bridge lies parallel to the M2 motorway bridges.
* 2017: A new road bridge from the A228 between Holborough and Halling across to Hall Road, Wouldham, to facilitate the development of Peters Village.
Three other major crossings are at Tonbridge, where bridges carry the A227 road and a rail link over the river; there is also a two-span viaduct which takes the A21 over the Medway Valley near Haysden.

The lowest crossing of the Medway are two cable tunnels between the Isle of Grain and Chetney marshes. These were built between 1973 and 1976 in anticipation of the commissioning of Grain power station. The tunnels are 1700 m long, 2.54 m in diameter and between 34 and 47 m below ordnance datum; each carries a 400kV electricity circuit. There is no public access.

==Flooding==
The middle section of the Medway above Tonbridge, partly because of the various tributaries entering the river in this stretch – in particular the River Eden – has always been subject to extensive flooding. Tonbridge has suffered frequent flooding over the centuries, so much so that the higher part of the town to the north is called &quot;Dryhill&quot;. Flood protection measures have therefore been taken. In 1981, a flood barrier was constructed downstream from Leigh to protect Tonbridge, which had been severely affected by the flooding of 1968. During periods of high flow, the flow is controlled by impounding the water and allowing up to of farmland upstream of the barrier to flood. However, this did not prevent significant flooding in Tonbridge in winter 2013–14. In recent years the village of Yalding, about 12 km downstream at the confluence with the River Beult, has been more prone to flooding than Tonbridge.

==Footpaths==
The Medway Valley Walk follows the river from Rochester to Tonbridge along the bank most of the way above Allington. It starts on the Saxon Shore Way at Rochester. The North Downs Way crosses the river using the Medway Viaduct or motorway bridge. The Greensand Way crosses the river at Yalding. At West Peckham, it is joined by the Wealdway which continues through Tonbridge, thus linking with the Eden Valley Walk. Maidstone Millennium River Park is a walk from Teston Country Park to the Museum of Kent Life at Sandling. The park, built between 1998 and 2001, has transformed of wasteland and three new footbridges have been built over the river.

==History==
Ancient sites abound throughout the length of the River Medway. The area around Aylesford is a notable Stone Age site where the Medway megaliths are a group of Neolithic chamber tombs including the Coldrum Stones and Kit&#x27;s Coty House. Bronze Age ornaments and beakers have been found along the river; other burial sites and finds come from the pre-Roman Iron Age. The Romans left evidence of many villas in the lower Medway Valley; later Jutish burial sites have also been found.

The Domesday Book records many manors in the Medway valley. Castles became a feature of the landscape, including Rochester, Allington, Leeds (near Maidstone), and West Malling.

Two military actions are named after the river: the Battle of the Medway (43 CE, during the Roman invasion of Britain); and the Raid on the Medway, in 1667 during the Second Anglo-Dutch War.

In the 18th century Samuel Ireland published an illustrated book about a journey up the river, to the River Bewl at Bayham Abbey. The book&#x27;s map shows some of the tributaries (unnamed). The illustrations include the castles at Queenborough, Upnor, Leybourne, Tonbridge and Hever; Penshurst Place; and the bridges at Teston, Maidstone, Aylesford, East Farleigh, Barming, Branbridges and Tonbridge. The hop fields in the vicinity of the latter are also described; and the easterly River Len, which then supplied Maidstone with its piped water. The book states that &quot;Within about two miles of Tunbridge the Medway branches out into several small streams, five of which unite at the town ... having each its stone bridge&quot;.
The Thames and Medway Canal, duplicatively linking the estuary at Strood to Gravesend for adverse tides and weather was completed in 1824 but was not a commercial success; by 1849 the South Eastern Railway had taken over its tunnel through a hillside. The western part of the canal remained in use until 1934.

The Hartlake disaster of 1853 saw the deaths of 30 hop-pickers when a wagon carrying them crashed through the side of a rotten wooden bridge at Golden Green near Hadlow, throwing its passengers into the flood-swollen river.

In 1914 HMS &quot;Bulwark&quot; exploded while moored at Kethole Reach near Sheerness, killing 741 men with only 12 survivors. The following year exploded in Saltpan Reach with the loss of 352 lives.

In 1942 the world&#x27;s first test of a submarine oil pipeline was conducted with one laid across the Medway in Operation Pluto.

==Culture==
The Medway&#x27;s &#x27;marriage&#x27; to the Thames is given extensive treatment by Edmund Spenser&#x27;s &quot;The Faerie Queene&quot; in the 16th century (Book IV, Canto xi). Joseph Conrad describes the view up the Medway from the Thames Estuary in (1906).

For the 1999 film &quot;The Mummy&quot; the river was filmed at Chatham Dockyard, in an imitation of a &quot;port at Cairo&quot;. The scene is brief but involves the main protagonists departing on their mission to the city of the dead.

The Maidstone River Festival, to celebrate the River Medway, running annually since 1980, is held on the last Saturday of July. It features events on and around the river and attracts thousands to Kent&#x27;s county town. The festival was cancelled in 2012 due to the London Olympics, but returned in 2013. However, the 2013 event did not include a funfair or a fireworks display as in previous years, and lasted just one day instead of two.

&quot;Medway Flows Softly&quot; is a song by local man George Gilbert; it was written in the mid-1960s and is often played in local folk clubs and at festivals in Kent.

The River Medway is featured at Maidstone in the studio backdrop of the ITV1 regional news programme &quot;Meridian Tonight&quot;.

At 7.15 p.m. on 1 May each year, local Morris dancers Kettle Bridge Clogs dance across Barming Bridge (otherwise known as the Kettle Bridge) to mark the start of their Morris dancing season.

Recreationally the river is used by many. For example, individuals and many clubs have paddling trips along many different parts of the Medway (e.g. Bewl Canoe Club). Individuals and club members paddling on the Medway and most other rivers should be members of British Canoeing.

===&quot;Kentish Men&quot; and &quot;Men of Kent&quot;===
The Medway is said to divide the county of Kent into two parts: this may allude to the two dioceses into which Kent has been divided since the year 604: Canterbury and Rochester. The tradition has grown up, and is kept alive by the &quot;Association of Men of Kent and Kentish Men&quot;, that those born in West Kent – the area north of the river, but including Maidstone, Gillingham (other than Rainham), Rochester and Chatham – are labelled &quot;Kentish Men&quot; (or &quot;Maids&quot;); while those born in East Kent are &quot;Men&quot; (or &quot;Maids&quot;) &quot;of Kent&quot;. This labelling applies equally to those born in those parts of the traditional county absorbed into London since the 1880s.

==Watermills==
The power of the Medway has been harnessed for a millennium or more. Waterwheels and turbines powered by the waters of the Medway and its tributaries have been used to mill corn, make paper, make cloth, smelt iron, pump water and generate electricity. There are over 200 sites on the Medway where such usage is known. Today, only one mill is working for a commercial trade.

See Medway watermills, and Medway watermills on the upper tributaries, the middle tributaries and the lower tributaries for more details.

<text>The Language Instinct: How the Mind Creates Language is a 1994 book by Steven Pinker, written for a general audience. Pinker argues that humans are born with an innate capacity for language. He deals sympathetically with Noam Chomsky&#x27;s claim that all human language shows evidence of a universal grammar, but dissents from Chomsky&#x27;s skepticism that evolutionary theory can explain the human language instinct.

==Thesis==

Pinker criticizes a number of common ideas about language, for example that children must be taught to use it, that most people&#x27;s grammar is poor, that the quality of language is steadily declining, that the kind of linguistic facilities that a language provides (for example, some languages have words to describe light and dark, but no words for colors) has a heavy influence on a person&#x27;s possible range of thoughts (the Sapir–Whorf hypothesis), and that nonhuman animals have been taught language (see Great ape language). Pinker sees language as an ability unique to humans, produced by evolution to solve the specific problem of communication among social hunter-gatherers. He compares language to other species&#x27; specialized adaptations such as spiders&#x27; web-weaving or beavers&#x27; dam-building behavior, calling all three &quot;instincts&quot;.

By calling language an instinct, Pinker means that it is not a human invention in the sense that metalworking and even writing are. While only some human cultures possess these technologies, all cultures possess language. As further evidence for the universality of language, Pinker—mainly relying on the work of Derek Bickerton—notes that children spontaneously invent a consistent grammatical speech (a creole) even if they grow up among a mixed-culture population speaking an informal trade pidgin with no consistent rules. Deaf babies &quot;babble&quot; with their hands as others normally do with voice, and spontaneously invent sign languages with true grammar rather than a crude &quot;me Tarzan, you Jane&quot; pointing system. Language (speech) also develops in the absence of formal instruction or active attempts by parents to correct children&#x27;s grammar. These signs suggest that rather than being a human invention, language is an innate human ability. Pinker also distinguishes language from humans&#x27; general reasoning ability, emphasizing that it is not simply a mark of advanced intelligence but rather a specialized &quot;mental module&quot;. He distinguishes the linguist&#x27;s notion of grammar, such as the placement of adjectives, from formal rules such as those in the American English writing style guide. He argues that because rules like &quot;a preposition is not a proper word to end a sentence with&quot; must be explicitly taught, they are irrelevant to actual communication and should be ignored. 

Pinker attempts to trace the outlines of the language instinct by citing his own studies of language acquisition in children, and the works of many other linguists and psychologists in multiple fields, as well as numerous examples from popular culture. He notes, for instance, that specific types of brain damage cause specific impairments of language such as Broca&#x27;s aphasia or Wernicke&#x27;s aphasia, that specific types of grammatical construction are especially hard to understand, and that there seems to be a critical period in childhood for language development just as there is a critical period for vision development in cats. Much of the book refers to Chomsky&#x27;s concept of a universal grammar, a meta-grammar into which all human languages fit. Pinker explains that a universal grammar represents specific structures in the human brain that recognize the general rules of other humans&#x27; speech, such as whether the local language places adjectives before or after nouns, and begin a specialized and very rapid learning process not explainable as reasoning from first principles or pure logic. This learning machinery exists only during a specific critical period of childhood and is then disassembled for thrift, freeing resources in an energy-hungry brain.

==Reception==
Pinker&#x27;s assumptions about the innateness of language have been challenged; English linguist Geoffrey Sampson argues that there is no such thing as a language instinct; however, he acknowledges that Pinker represents a widely held view of language acquisition.

Richard Webster, writes in &quot;Why Freud Was Wrong&quot; (1995), and concludes that Pinker argues cogently that the human capacity for language is part of the genetic endowment associated with the evolution through natural selection of specialised neural networks within the brain, and that its attack on the &#x27;standard social science model&#x27; of human nature is effective. Webster accepts Pinker&#x27;s argument that, for ideological motives, twentieth-century social scientists have minimized the extent to which human nature is influenced by genetics. However, Webster finds Pinker&#x27;s speculation about other specialized neural networks that may have evolved within the human brain—such as &quot;intuitive mechanics&quot; and &quot;intuitive biology&quot;—to be questionable, and believes that there is a danger that they will be treated by others as science. Webster believes that such speculations strengthen supporters of extreme genetic determinism.

<text>Not About Heroes is a drama by Stephen MacDonald about the real-life relationship between the poets Wilfred Owen and Siegfried Sassoon first performed in 1982 at the Edinburgh Festival in Edinburgh, Scotland.

The play has only two characters: Owen and Sassoon. The story of their friendship is told in a series of flashbacks, narrated by Sassoon who survived World War I (in which Owen was killed). Most of the scenes take place during their time as fellow-patients at Craiglockhart War Hospital near Edinburgh in 1917.

The title is a quotation from the preface Wilfred Owen wrote in preparation for the publication of his collected poems:

==Synopsis==
The action is replayed through the eyes of an older Siegfried Sassoon, as he recalls his relationship with Wilfred Owen, beginning some fourteen years earlier. Owen introduces himself hesitantly to Sassoon when the latter arrives at Craiglockhart in 1917, having been diagnosed as suffering from &quot;war neurosis&quot; as a result of his protest against the war. The course of their friendship is shown through extracts from the real diaries and letters of the two men, right up to their last meeting at the Chelsea Physic Garden, when Sassoon was recovering from a head wound that would end his military career while Owen waited to return to the Western Front, where he would be killed shortly afterwards.

==Past productions==
&quot;Not About Heroes&quot; had its première at the Edinburgh Festival in 1982 and won a Fringe First award. Directed by Eric Standidge, Sassoon was played by the author and Owen by David Learner. It toured and came to the King&#x27;s Head, was adapted for Yorkshire TV and BBC Radio 4, and was published by Faber and Faber, all in 1983. A new production at the Royal National Theatre in 1986 celebrated the centenary of Sassoon&#x27;s birth with the author again playing Sassoon and Simon Dutton playing Owen. A national tour took place the following year with Paul Shelley as Siegfried Sassoon and Stephen McGann as Wilfred Owen. In 1992, the author directed a revised text for the Citizen&#x27;s, Glasgow – a production which afterwards was seen in Shrewsbury as part of the celebrations marking the centenary of Owen&#x27;s birth.

A production by Dianne Wiest at the Williamstown Theatre Festival transferred to New York City in 1985. Edward Herrmann and Dylan Baker both won OBIE awards. The 1987 Stratford Ontario production, with Nicholas Pennell and Henry Czerny, was revived the following year. &quot;Not About Heroes&quot; was also performed in the early 1990s at The Round House Theatre in the Maryland suburbs of Washington, D.C.

Stephen McGann played Owen in a production at the Oxford Playhouse in 1987, opposite Paul Shelley as Sassoon. Jonas Armstrong played Owen in a 2000 production at the Edinburgh Fringe.

In October/November 2008, Rowan Tree Theatre Co. in the Scottish Borders, mounted a production of the play to mark the 90th anniversary of the end of the Great War and in celebration of the company&#x27;s twenty-first birthday. One performance was given in Craiglockhart Hospital, the site of the actual meeting of the two poets. Sassoon was played by Oliver Bisset, and Owen by Matthew Burgess. The play was directed by John Haswell and produced by Judy Steel.

Notable productions of &quot;Not About Heroes&quot; in recent years have included a version mounted for the 2002 Hay-on-Wye literary festival, starring Roger Moss and Owen Sheers. It was directed by Cathy Gill and produced by the novelist, Louis de Bernières. The following year, Peter Dickson and Andrew Butterworth starred in a production at the Crescent Theatre, Birmingham. In 2005 MADHouse Productions staged a poignant version in the intimate surroundings of the Barons Court Theatre in west London. This production starred Dov Citron as Sassoon and Martin Scully as Owen and was directed by Ian Flintoff. In 2006, Feelgood Theatre Productions premiered a site specific production in the setting of the Imperial War Museum North starring Dan Willis and Sam Ellis. Directed by Caroline Clegg, this production went on to be the first theatre company to perform in the Cabinet War Rooms (Churchill&#x27;s bunker), followed by a national tour and short sell-out season at Trafalgar Studios, Whitehall, London. Inspired by &quot;Not About Heroes&quot; at Trafalgar Feelgood created Eloquent Protest a peace event using poetry, song and textas &quot;an artists response to war&quot;. Hosted by retired politician and peace campaigner Tony Benn this became a pivotal event for four years, with stars such as Janie Dee, Johnnie Fiori, Sam West, Robert Powell, Jason Isaacs, Roy Bailey, Julian Littman, Clive Rowe, Peter Straker, Jane Milligan and David Harsent. RGP Productions produced the play in Sydney, followed by a season at the Australian War Memorial in Canberra in 2007, starring Roger Gimblett as Sassoon and Patrick Magee as Owen, with direction by Carla Moore. To mark the centenary of the declaration of World War One RGP Productions remounted their 2007 production of the play at the Sydney Opera House in August 2014. The play was broadcast on BBC Radio 7 in November 2007 and November 2008.
